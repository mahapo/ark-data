After the completion of myJewish Education and Society in the High Middle Ages, which focused primarily onthe societal and curricular structures of education and rabbinic learning inmedieval Ashkenaz, I began, mainly for a change of pace, to reread and toexplore further kabbalistic and other mystical literature that appeared inProvence and Spain during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. I was struckearly on by the fact that a number of these texts mentioned or alluded toAshkenazic rabbinic figures, including German Pietists and apparently sometosafists as well.To be sure, these names were sometimes jumbled or misconstrued.Nonetheless, mindful of the illuminating studies by Israel Ta-Shma on theabsorption and adoption of Ashkenazic customs and practices by the Zohar,and by a number of recent studies that successfully trace Provengal andSpanish kabbalistic themes directly back to Hasidei Ashkenaz, I set about tryingto ascertain whether these Ashkenazic scholars were merely being co-opted bykabbalists in order to lend their kabbalistic material additional significance andcontext, or whether the Ashkenazic rabbinic figures mentioned were actuallyinvolved in some type of mystical studies, of which the kabbalists might havebeen aware.The results of that initial inquiry were published under the title \"RabbinicFigures in Castilian Kabbalistic Pseudepigraphy: R. Yehudah he-Hasid andR. Elhanan of Corbeil,\" as part of a special issue of the Journal of Jewish Thoughtand Philosophy.l In the documentation for that study, I pointed to evidence bothjournal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy 3 [Studies in Jewish Mysticism,Esotericism, and Hasidism] (1993):77-109."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"PREFACEfrom manuscript sources and from published medieval rabbinic texts whichsuggests that tosafists such as R. Jacob of Corbeil, R. Isaac of Corbeil, andR. Meir of Rothenburg, among others, were indeed familiar with various typesof mystical teachings. These results, in addition to other related findings,indicated that a larger study of additional manuscript texts and publishedworks was worth undertaking, in order to evaluate properly the extent towhich tosafists were involved in aspects of mysticism. The book now beforeyou is a presentation and discussion of those findings.The tosafists flourished in northern France and Germany (and, to a lesserextent, in Austria, Italy, and England) during the twelfth and thirteenthcenturies. They revolutionized the study of the Talmud, following thepioneering efforts of their ancestor and teacher Rashi. The claim that anumber of tosafists were familiar with mystical doctrines is rather new, andperhaps even startling. In previous studies, I have followed the dominant viewin modern scholarship—which will be reviewed below in the introduction—that the tosafists were decidedly talmudocentric. This view assumes thatdespite the very full library of earlier Jewish literature which they had at theirdisposal, the tosafists concentrated their efforts and training on the mastery ofthe talmudic text and on the surrounding halakhic and rabbinic literature, withthe possible exception of biblical studies. But even the study of the Bible wasundertaken, for the most part, through the prism of the talmudic corpus.2There was no overt interest in or concern with extra-talmudic pietism, let alonewith issues of theology and theosophy. Only Hasidti Ashkenaz—led by R. Judahhe-Hasid and his devoted student, R. Eleazar of Worms, and reflecting interestsof the pre-Crusade period—were involved in these disciplines and practices; atthe same time, they critiqued aspects of tosafist dialectic and Ashkenazicreligious life in general, including prevalent prayer customs and liturgical texts.A few words about the structure of the presentation are in order.Chapters 1 and 2 will identify the varieties of ascetic and pietistic practices thatcan be found among northern French and German tosafists. There wascertainly no formal pietistic movement among the tosafists, and a number oftosafists were categorically against ascetic practices that can be labeled asperishut. Nonetheless, forms of self-denial, hasidut, and even tiqqund teshuvah(which have been associated heretofore only with the Hasidti Ashkenaz), can betraced in tosafist writings.3 Possible connections between the tosafists who2See my \"On the Role of Biblical Studies in Medieval Ashkenaz,\" The Frank TalmageMemorial Volume, ed.

We shall see that many of those tosafists who were associatedwith hasidut and perishut were also involved with mystical teachings. Thesecond chapter will conclude with a brief discussion about the relationshipbetween pietism and mysticism in medieval Ashkenaz.Chapters 3 through 5 will offer a detailed chronological survey andcharacterization of mystical studies within the rabbinic culture of Ashkenaz,from the pre-Crusade period through the end of the thirteenth century. Severaldistinct types of mystical and magical or theurgic teachings and practices,known to Ashkenazic scholars in the pre-Crusade period at the academy ofMainz in particular, can be identified. These include the interpretation ofDivine Names and an awareness of their uses (e.g., for protection, forprophylactic techniques and procedures, or for oracular and quasi-propheticprognostications, including various forms of she^elat halom), and an under-standing of the powers and roles of various angels and other heavenly beings.These interests were not shared, however, by early tosafist leaders such asRashbam, Rabbenu Tarn, and Raban, despite their familiarity with some ofthem. Several explanations for this change in attitude will be suggested. It isclear that this posture affected many subsequent tosafists who displayed noinclination toward mystical teachings. This may also account, in part, for theprevailing perception of the tosafist period, and for the tendency in earlierscholarship to ignore or downplay interest in these areas during this period.At the same time, however, in the second half of the twelfth century,several leading students of Rabbenu Tarn do show signs of interest, whichintensify throughout the remainder of the tosafist period. We shall see that themajor areas of interest within the tosafist period correspond precisely to thoseof the pre-Crusade period. It is likely that a number of thirteenth-centurytosafists and other rabbinic scholars, especially those hailing from Germany,were influenced by the German Pietists. But there is also evidence withinnorthern France for mysticism and pietism of the type found amongst theHasidei Ashkenaz, for which the question of influence is less easily resolved.The presence within Ashkenazic rabbinic culture of elements of pietismand mysticism that had heretofore been associated only with the German\"Ha-Megammah ha-Datit/ha-Hevratit shel 'Sefer Hasidim,'\" Zion 3 (1937): 1-50 [sectionsthree through seven: \"TOrr ,DTittn mDt^j <,XWT\\ tprr'p iro^n mnbnn ^7K Dmn ;TonnnmU7n nu^n ;\"Ol]. This is not the case, however, with regard to the social issues thatBaer identifies.11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"PREFACEPietists requires a restatement, in narrower terms, of the extent of the Pietists'uniqueness within Ashkenaz itself and throughout the medieval Jewish world.Spanish kabbalists cited tosafists as well as German Pietists as repositories oftorat ha-sod material, as 1 have indicated. Moreover, the interest in penances,pietistic prayer practices, and magic among Ashkenazic rabbinic scholarsduring the late medieval and early modern periods cannot be attributed solelyto the impact of Hasidei Ashkenaz. The German Pietists remain, however, theonly Ashkenazic figures who expressed a strong interest in theosophy andproduced a substantial, if not systematic, corpus in this area.1 am not suggesting that the tosafists were outright mystics, nor that theyattempted to invest their talmudic or halakhic interpretations with mysticalsignificance. To be sure, the absence of esoteric teachings in medieval talmudiccommentaries and halakhic works generally may be due primarily to the natureof these genres and the relationship between them.4 There is hardly anyreference to kabbalistic material in Nahmanides' vast talmudic corpus, despitehis prominent stature as an active kabbalistic thinker.5 Nonetheless, a numberof tosafists did acquire, perhaps from their ancestors as well as from theGerman Pietists, interest in areas that can certainly be termed mystical. Indeed,these tosafists must be added to the list of medieval rabbinic scholars whopursued spiritual disciplines outside the confines of pure legalism and talmudicstudies. The inclusion of tosafists in this group constitutes a significant shift inour view of medieval Jewish intellectual history.4See, e.g., Jacob Katz, \"Halakhah ve-Kabbalah: Maggacim Rishonim,\" [reprinted inhis] Halakhah ve-Qabbalah (Jerusalem, 1986), 28-33; idem, \"Halakhah ve-Qabbalahke-NosDei Limmud Mitharim,\" Halakhah ve-Qabbalah, 76-77; Isadore Twersky, Rabad ofPosquieres (Philadelphia, 19802), 299-300; Moshe Idel, \"We have No KabbalisticTradition on This,\" in Rabbi Moses Nahmanides: Explorations in His Religious and LiteraryVirtuosity, ed.

To be sure, Sefer Roqeah ismore in the spirit of sifrut de-Vei Rashi than other tosafist halakhic works of thethirteenth century. Nonetheless, R. Eleazar's halakhic rulings and writtenopinions were accorded great authority by a number of German tosafists. Atthe outset of his treatment, however, Urbach writes that R. Eleazar of Worms'sintegration of exoteric and esoteric teachings had no followers amongsubsequent tosafists and Ashkenazic posqim, although R. Eleazar had somedegree of influence on later scholars. This is apparently a reference toR. Eleazar's small group of students, especially R. Abraham b. Azriel ofBohemia, to whom Urbach refers several times in his discussion of R. Eleazar.3Toward the end of this discussion, Urbach suggests that R. Eleazar'sinfluence in promulgating Torah study that would lead to hasidut was notrestricted to Eleazar's colleagues and students in Germany, but reachednorthern France and even Spain. As proof, Urbach cites Nahmanides'well-known letter of 1232 to rabbanei Zarefat in conjunction with theMaimonidean controversy (nw ^K mVK mu) in which Nahmanides assertsthat one of Eleazar's treatises on sod ha-yihud had reached him in Spain and wasalso to be found in northern France. Urbach next notes the impact thatR. Eleazar's torat ha-sod had on kabbalistic circles in Provence. He concludesthat R. Eleazar's works \"were available in northern France, as per Nahmanides'testimony, although his name is not mentioned explicitly very often.\" Urbachgoes on to suggest, without pointing to any specific examples, that R. Eleazar'shalakhic writings contributed to the conception of piety in Ashkenaz thatincluded \"abiding devoutness, love of Torah study and the performance of itsprecepts while preserving the minute details of custom, and a desire tocomprehend the inner meaning and secrets of the world and its existence.\"4Urbach refers to R. Eleazar's Pietist teacher, R. Judah he-Hasid, only inpassing, principally because R. Judah wrote next to nothing in the realm ofhalakhah or talmudic commentary. Indeed, Urbach notes that even theresponsa of R. Judah that have survived deal almost exclusively with issues of3See E. E. Urbach, Bcfalei ha-Tosafot (Jerusalem, 19804), 1:388-411. Urbach alsopublished a three-volume critical edition of R. Abraham b. Azriel's massive liturgical andpiyyut commentary, cArugat ha-Bosem. In his introduction (vol. 4; Jerusalem, 1963),Urbach painstakingly locates cArugat ha-Bosem within its genre in medieval Ashkenaz. Inthis work as well, Urbach conveys the impression (in a number of instances) thatR. Eleazar of Worms and his student R. Abraham, who had an abiding interest inesoteric teachings and interpretations, were part of a relatively isolated circle that hadlittle in common with recognized tosafists in these and related matters. Cf. below, n. 12.Urbach, Bcfalei ha-Tosafot, 1:408-9.20"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Perceptions of Tosafist Spiritualitycustom and hasidut, rather than with talmudic interpretation or halakhicreasoning. Urbach also highlights the very different approaches to the sameritual question, as well as the differing methods of argumentation, taken byR. Judah and the tosafist R. Isaac Or Zarucf5The scattered references in Urbach's Bcfalei ha-Tosafot to torat ha-sod andkabbalah appear, for the most part, with regard to German Pietists and theirassociates or students.6 Even in the few instances where Urbach acknowledgesthat hasidut or torat ha-sod considerations appear to have had an impact on atosafist, he tends to portray them as uneventful.7 The implication of Urbach'swork is that tosafists had no abiding interest (or training) in torat ha-sod, oreven in quasi-mystical areas such as magic.8 This characterization accords fullywith Urbach's views regarding the (small) extent to which rabbinic scholars ofthe talmudic period were involved in these disciplines, and especially with his5Bacalei ha-Tosafot, 1:390-92. This comparison is rendered even more significantby the fact, noted elsewhere by Urbach, that R. Isaac studied \"issues of hasidut inparticular\" with R. Judah he-Hasid (and with R. Eleazar of Worms). See Bacaleiha-Tosafot, 1:437-39, and below, ch. 1, n. 16. See also Bacalei ha-Tosafot, 1:412-13, forR. Simhah of Spires's response to a question asked of him by R. Judah. This incident isdescribed by Urbach as \"another example of the difference between the decisor whorules leniently based on halakhic grounds, and the hasid who is concerned and isstringent not for halakhic reasons but because of considerations of piety (yir^ah).\" Cf.below, ch. 2, n. 16. Urbach has a brief discussion of R. Judah's father, R. Samuel he-Hasid(1:192-95), in the context of the rabbinic leadership of Spires during the first half of thetwelfth century.6There are eleven entries for the terms hasidut/hasidim in the index (in addition to aseparate listing forHasidei Ashkenaz, which has seventeen entries). Many of these alsorefer, however, to the German Pietists, with no implication for the tosafists. The termkabbalah (the entry under sod says \"see kabbalah\") has only fourteen index entries, againseveral times in connection with the Pietists. Cf. Bacalei ha-Tosafot, 2:586, n. 2. Urbachwas, of course, fully aware of the esoteric teachings found in the prayer and piyyutcommentaries of the German Pietists. See cArugat ha-Bosem, ed. Urbach, 4:73-111.7See, e.g., Bacalei ha-Tosafot, 1:150-51, regarding R. Jacob of Corbeil; 1:161,regarding R. Eliezer of Metz; 1:387-88, regarding Rabiah; and 2:522, 547, 564,regarding R. Meir of Rothenburg. Urbach deals with Ri's extensive sod and hasidutproclivities in fewer than two pages (1:237-39). See also 1:199 (and cf. cArugatha-Bosem, 4:99-100, n. 75), regarding R. Isaac b. Mordekhai of Regensburg; and below,ch. 4, nn. 23, 29.8One or two of the entries under kabbalah deal with magic. There is only onelisting under kishuf, one listing under mazzalot, one under Shem ha-Meforash (whichdescribes a magical usage), one on shedim, and three under mehashvei ha-qez (althoughone of these refers to a calculation that was arrived at through neither mystical normagical means). Cf. Teshuvot u-Fesaqim, ed.

Although Yizhak Baer makes reference, in his lengthy study ofSefer Hasidim and hasidut Ashkenaz, to Ashkenazic talmudism,11 until the 1970sIn his review of Urbach's corpus, Yaacov Sussmann stresses the need to recognizeand evaluate more accurately the overall impact of German Pietism on the intellectualhistory of medieval Ashkenaz.

Among the Pietists'demands were an uncompromising insistence on certain textual variants anddistinctive practices in prayer, the cultivation of liturgical poetry and itsinterpretation, the expansion of biblical studies, and the primacy of talmudiclearning that would be geared more toward reaching practical halakhicconclusions and less toward unbridled dialectical exercises. Nonetheless, evenin these studies, the Pietists remained fundamentally outside tosafist circles andvice versa, with both groups portrayed as somewhat at odds with each other.12In addition, the interest expressed in the study of sod by certainAshkenazic rabbinic scholars in the pre-Crusade period was believed to havebypassed the rabbinic legalists in twelfth-century northern France whochanged the face of talmudic studies following the First Crusade. Scholars haveassumed that this interest was retained only by the German Pietists, who wereconsciously driven to return to earlier patterns or models of spirituality.(Indeed, the influence of a number of pre-Crusade rabbinic values can also beseen in the Pietist critique, just described, with regard to exoteric areas ofstudy.) Moreover, R. Judah he-Hasid was a direct descendant of theQalonymides, a leading pre-Crusade family whose knowledge of sod has beendocumented. The sentiments expressed in the writings of Hasidei Ashkenazconcerning the importance of good lineage (yihus) in marriage and in othersocietal contexts undoubtedly stemmed from the fact that the Pietists werethemselves German blue bloods.1312H.

Identifying adherents of Pietistteachers such as R. Samuel he-Hasid, R. Judah he-Hasid, and R. Eleazar ofWorms—who did not themselves represent a monolithic approach—is not aneasy task. Sefer Hasidim, the main exoteric work of hasidut Ashkenaz, suggeststhat the number of hasidim in any particular locale was small.14 Although theQalonymides and Hasidei Ashkenaz that highlights their involvement with sod—fostersthe impression that these groups of scholars were fundamentally separate. It must benoted, however, that R. Solomon, by his own indication, reports his information fromtwo distinct sources with different foci. The first (about which R. Solomon says pTiVKpny\\n TIK^BW HE \"f?) is a late thirteenth- or early fourteenth-century treatise that isfound also, with variants, in ms. Bodl. 847, fols. 36r-36v. [My thanks to Dr. AvrahamDavid for providing me with a copy of his transcription of the ms. passage. Cf. Urbach,BaQalei ha-Tosafot, 1:253, n. 4*; 321, n. 17. On the dating of this text, see Y. N. Epstein,\"Liqqutim,\" Ha-Qedem 1 (1907-8): 129-30, who attributes the version cited byMaharshal to a student of R. Meir of Rothenburg, arguably R. Asher b. YehiDel. The ms.Bodl. version (of which Epstein was unaware) does not contain the reference toMaharam noted by Epstein. See also Grossman, Hakhmei Ashkenaz ha-Rishonim, 46-47,n. 68.] This treatise compiles a list of medieval halakhists—beginning with R. Sherira,R. Hai, Rif, and R. Hanan3el—which then gives way to the naming of many tosafists.Included in this list are R. Eleazar of Worms, R. Judah he-Hasid (possibly of Regensburg,although the reference is unclear; these two names are found only in the version inTeshuvot Maharshal), and other tosafist figures whose pietistic affinities are noted, suchas R. Elijah he-Hasid of Paris (see below, ch. 3, n. 95) and R. Ezra ha-Navi (ofMoncontour; see below, ch. 5, n. 67). Cf. David Kaufmann, \"Liste de Rabbins Dresseepar Azriel Trabotto, RE] 4 (1882):208-25, and Eric Zimmer, \"Seder ha-Posqimle-R. Azriel Trabot,\" Sinai 77 (1975):237-52.R. Solomon Luria then adds a Qalonymide family chain of tradition, which hereports having found (TiK^n X\\\\u). The bulk of this material—minus someembellishment; see, e.g., Sefer Hasidim—Ms. Parma H3280, ed.

Eleazar of Worms maintained there was no one towhom he could transmit Pietist esoteric lore {torat ha-sod)\\ however, recentresearch indicates that he did have students in this realm, despite hisstatements to the contrary17In looking for disciples of hasidut Ashkenaz, a distinction should be madebetween those who followed certain Pietist teachings or doctrines and thosewho were full-fledged members of the Pietist movement. Another usefuldistinction that has already been drawn contrasts the sectarian approachfavored by R. Judah he-Hasid, which entailed more radical forms of atonementand pietism, with the personalist program advocated by R. Eleazar of Worms(author not only of the oft-cited Sefer Roqeah but also a signatory on TaqqanotShum), which was more compatible with existing societal customs andinstitutions.18 Ostensibly, R. Eleazar's pietistic and penitential regimens wouldhave been easier to follow than those of R. Judah.In any case, aspects of the foregoing analysis suggest that disciples andfollowers of the Pietists would be found primarily, if not exclusively, inGermany. Indeed, small circles of rabbinic scholars who followed aspects of theteachings of Hasidei Ashkenaz have been identified near where R. Judah15See R.

Both Urbach and Jacob Katz suggested (approximately fortyyears ago) that R. Moses of Coucy was influenced by the German Pietists withregard to procedures for repentance and penance, as well as in his attitudestoward non-Jews. To be sure, R. Moses' unique role as a traveling preacher mayhave contributed to his interest in these areas, but this role also reflects theinfluence of Hasidei Ashhenaz20More recently, the tosafist academy at Evreux—headed by the brothersR. Moses, R. Samuel, and R. Isaac b. Shne^ur—has been identified as one thatespoused several key doctrines and teachings of the German Pietists, eventhough there is scant evidence for any direct contact between them.21 Someexamples of affinity include the downplaying of tosafist dialectic, the study ofthose areas of the talmudic and rabbinic corpus that were often neglected inmedieval Europe, the development of proper intention in prayer, and theproduction of liturgical commentaries and handbooks, as well as piyyutim.19See Yaacov Sussmann, \"Massoret Limmud u-Massoret Nosah shel TalmudYerushalmi,\" Mehqarim be-Sifrut ha-Talmudit le-Regel Melot Shemonim Shanah le-ShaWLieberman (Jerusalem, 1983), 14, n. 11, 34-35; idem, \"Mifcalo ha-Maddaci,\" 51-52, n.87; Urbach, Bcfalti ha-Tosafot, 1:207, 222, 375-76, 420; Israel Ta-Shma, \"Le-Toledotha-Yehudim be-Polin ba-MeDot ha-Yod Bet/ha-Yod Gimmel,\" lion 53 (1988):347-69,and Zion 54 (1989):205-8; and my Jewish Education and Society, 75-76 [to 174, n. 62,add SeferHasidim, ed.

He was notfamiliar with many manuscript passages involving both twelfth- andthirteenth-century tosafists, as well as German Pietists, that have an importantbearing on the topics in which he was interested.24 Nor did he know the fullextent of the Pietists' rich theosophical literature (and the impact which thatliterature had on Spanish kabbalah).

Since the German Pietists recorded and were involved withmany aspects of magic, and since their mystical teachings were (inTrachtenberg's view) markedly less sophisticated than those of their Spanishand Provengal counterparts, Trachtenberg was inclined to study this magicfrom the popular level up rather than from the mystical level down.27 In fact,however, the nature of much of the magic itself—as well as the parallels toHekhalot literature and the involvement of both the German Pietists and certaintosafists in studies that are decidedly mystical—suggests how Ashkenazicmagic derived its status in the eyes of rabbinic scholars as a discipline related tomysticism rather than as a transformation of folk custom.

The association ofmagic with kabbalah during a period in which kabbalah was prominentenhanced the status of magical practices for these rabbinic scholars.29Evidence for the correlation between mysticism and magic held byrabbinic scholars in medieval Ashkenaz, primarily in manuscript passages, willbe seen throughout the course of this study For now, two brief statementsabout the overarching relationship between these two disciplines will suffice.Moshe Idel has argued that Jewish magic—which he defines as \"a series of actsand beliefs that presume the possibility of achieving (beneficial) physical resultsthrough the use of techniques not subject to empirical explanation\"—andJewish mysticism ought to be studied and classified together, as forms ofreligious expression that are virtually intertwined. The soundness of thisapproach has already been demonstrated by the greater emphasis in recentscholarship on the interplay between mysticism and magic in Hekhalotliterature, hasidut Ashkenaz, and Hasidism. To be sure, magic is a \"lower\" formof religious expression than mysticism, since magic seeks to effect a lowerstratum of existence. Yet Jewish magic, no less than torat ha-sod, is based onreliable traditions and teachers.30 Idel also compares and contrasts the mysticalstudy or contemplation of Divine Names and their powers with the magicalactivation and use of these powers.3129I.

The perishutreferred to in this document has specific parallels to material in Sefer Hasidim, and inother texts of the German Pietists.

Although it istrue that Sefer Hasidim advocates a full marital life, which is one of the proofs offered byBen-Artzi (see also Soloveitchik, \"Three Themes,\" 329, n. 51), his argument concerningascetic practices is flawed in several respects. First, while asserting that SHP presents asomewhat different view, Ben-Artzi restricts himself to an analysis of SHB. Moreover, hemisses a significant nuance within this text. He stresses that SHB advises that one shouldnot fast all the time (tamid) or that one whose services are needed by others should notweaken himself through fasting (52, 617; note also 527). But at the same time,unnoticed by Ben-Artzi, SHB reports (97, 225; see also the end of 617, and the parallelpassages in SHP) that a number of hasidim instructed their children to fast at regularintervals, lest they become too immersed in worldly pleasures. Clearly, SHB isadvocating a level of asceticism that, at the same time, would not incapacitate a personand thereby defeat its purpose. [Cf. R. Eleazar of Worms, Sefer Roqeah, sec. 209,regarding fasting on Mondays and Thursdays; Arbacah Turim, Orah Hayyim, 134; andGedalyahu Alon, \"Le-Yishuvah shel Baraita Ahat,\" Tarbiz 4 (1933): 285-91.]Finally, Ben-Artzi seems to misinterpret SHB 12. He reads this passage assuggesting that one may enjoy pleasurable foods (macadanim) that are not beingconsumed merely to sustain oneself, as long as one does not eat so much as to satiatehimself completely. A reading of the full passage, which begins with the phrase umw'n n*rp nan nan nx nmri n*on i^ib mxrin mwm ma1' rimon, yields a differentconclusion. SHB maintains that a measure of hasidut is achieved when a person wishesto enjoy something but he refuses it as a sign of yir^at ha-Shem—not because he is underany external pressure or even because of fear of sin, but simply as a means ofdemonstrating his complete love for and awe of the Almighty Refusing certain foods isan excellent vehicle for reaching this state, since indulgence in culinary pleasures canlead to bad thoughts. If a person has the opportunity to eat fish or meat or otherpleasant foods, he should resist eating them only because of his yirDat ha-Shem (and notbecause of other considerations), and he should not allow himself to become satiated tothe full extent of his desire. See also Reuven Margoliot's notes, ad loc, and cf. SHP 1017.In this instance as well, SHB is advocating controlled asceticism as a means of expressinggenuine dedication and devotion.

Those (few) who ruled this way were characterized by Rashi'sstudents as \"benei Dadam... perushim\" who were \"exceedingly strict\" inseparating themselves. This ruling was also espoused by R. Jacob's student,R. Solomon b. Samson. R. Solomon issued a number of stringent rulings incritical ritual matters and argued consistently against the implementation ofnewly issued halakhic rulings that conflicted with established customs andpractices.13A second teacher of Rashi's in Mainz, R. Isaac b. Judah, is also describedin the sifrut de-Vex Rashi as a parush. He earned this sobriquet by eating only asingle egg for the final meal before the fast of Tishcah be-Av.14 R. Isaac'sintention was to eat as little before the fast as possible, thereby rendering thefast, which was viewed as a vehicle for repentance, more arduous.15Rashi's teacher at Worms, R. Isaac ha-Levi, fasted two days in observanceof Yom ha-Kippurim. Although R. Isaac adopted this position based on hisunderstanding of the requirements of talmudic law, the motivation of personalpiety is apparent, since he did not require others to do it. Moreover, the onlyGerman authorities who followed this practice in the tosafist period were13Grossman, Hakhmei Ashhenaz ha-Rishonim, 334-38.

But, as has been noted, the association ofthese rabbinic scholars with other rulings and characteristics of perishut and pietismsuggests that perishut, as an extra-halakhic value, played a role in this instance as well.Indeed, the stringency which treated dam tohar as dam niddah was later espoused almostexclusively by members of Hasidei Ashkenaz and other rabbinic scholars connected withthem.

To be sure, the entirephenomenon of medieval Ashkenazic martyrdom presumes a pietistic orientation, eventhough the degree to which martyrdom during the Crusades had a specific impact onthe development of Hasidei Ashkenaz is a matter of contention.

R. Simeon ha-Gadol ofMainz was a member of the Abun family, which originated in Le Mans innorthern France. Indeed, while it is possible that R. Simeons grandfather,R. Abun (d.c.970), had already emigrated to the Rhineland, it is probable thatR. Simeon was still in Le Mans for part of his student days. In any event, therabbinic leaders of the Le Mans community in the generation after R. Abunwere R. Menahem and his sons, R. Elijah and R. Isaac.23At the time of his death, R. Menahem was characterized by his son,R. Elijah, as a holy and devout person who consecrated his body throughouthis lifetime by afflicting it via fasting and denial.24 The second son ofR. Menahem, R. Isaac, is described as being one of those perushim who, like22See Grossman, Hakhmei Ashkenaz ha-Rishonim, 177, 243-45 (regarding R. Jacobb. Yaqar), 326, and above, n. 13. Cf. Gartner, Gilgulei Minhag, 31-39. Although all threeof Rashi's teachers were associated with ascetic or pietistic practices (see above at nn. 11,14, 17), Rashi did not, for the most part, affect these behaviors. Thus, for example, hechided perushim (D^ttrnan ])2 W1) who fasted for tcfanit Esther on both Thursday andFriday when Purim occurred on Sunday (see Mahzor Vitry, see 245, ed. Simon Hurwitz[Nuremberg, 1923], 210; the variants in Shibbolei ha-Leqet, ed. Buber, sec. 194; andSefer ha-Pardes ha-Gadol, sec. 204). He also criticized those who fasted two days for YomKippur (see Sperber, Minhagei Yisra^el, 4 [Jerusalem, 1995], 207, n. 6). Nonetheless,Rashi's great humility, his stringent personal conduct in situations where he had grantedlatitude to others, his striking position on minimizing prayer during times of illnessbecause of the difficulty in maintaining proper kavvanah, and even his concern aboutovereating with regard to sezudah shelishit may be the result of this training.

Judah of Mainz, ate a minimal amount of food prior to the fast of theninth of Av.25The Evidence from Twelfth-Century Tosafist Texts andRelated LiteratureIn the twelfth century there were groups of people as well as individualswho pursued forms of perishut or asceticism. Rabbenu Jacob Tarn, the leadingtosafist of the day, encountered this phenomenon but appears not to havesupported it. He was asked to respond to a report that \"many devout Jews whohave embraced purity and perishut (mnm D^unanEn tPn^-K miy im *o^KWO rnttmam) do not wish to feed their young children on Yom Kippur,even though these children have not yet reached the age when they are to betrained [to fast]. And those who do feed [their young children] are told thatthey have violated a commandment, since adults are required to preventchildren from committing overt sins.\" Without offering an assessment of theirmotives or their ideological position, Rabbenu Tarn ruled simply that feedingthese children was completely permissible.26 It should be noted that thetendency toward perishut in this case (as in a number of the other instancesmentioned above) may have had its roots in earlier Palestinian custom.Although the precise age of the youngsters who were urged to fast is tied tovariant readings in Palestinian rabbinic texts, the tendency itself, which findsno support in the Babylonian Talmud, was quite pronounced.2725Grossman, Hakhmei Zarefat ha-Rishonim, 84. R. Isaac b. Menahem ate only saltedbread and water, without any vegetable or relish. Cf. above, n. 14.

See Urbach, Bacalei ha-Tosafot, 1:91. The use of the term in this context,however, is based on a talmudic passage concerning the Pharisees (Sotah 22b), althoughit may also be indicative of Rabbenu Tarn's understanding of this term in general.

Isaac b.

Since,however, a decree that cannot be upheld by the general public ought not bepromulgated, this practice could not actually be required. According to thistext, Ri did, however, fast for two days.30R. Isaac b. Asher ha-Levi (Riba) of Spires was an older tosafistcontemporary of Rabbenu Tarn. He had studied in Mainz prior to the FirstCrusade and with Rashi in Troyes. An account recorded in a fourteenth-century work, Pisqei Reqanati, details the circumstances under which Riba diedc. 1133. He was seriously ill prior to Yom Kippur. His doctors advised him thatif he fasted on Yom Kippur he would surely die, but that even if he ate, hemight still die. Riba decided that the possibility of his dying did not outweighhis obligation to fast. He did not eat that day and subsequently passed away3130Pisqei ha-Tosafot li-Menahot #201, cited by Urbach, Bacalei ha-Tosafot, 1:238.

Ri's reasoning was that a fast for repentance on Rosh ha-Shanah would notbe any worse than a tacanit halom, which is permitted on Rosh ha-Shanah.

By immersing themselves prior toYom Kippur and remaining on their feet throughout the night (during theevening service, or perhaps literally the entire night) and day of Yom Kippur,these perushim, according to Rabiah, sought to imitate the behavior of theangels.32The perushim to whom Rabiah refers may have been pious individualswho were not formally associated with each other or with any organized groupor movement. But since Rabiah flourished in Germany at precisely the sametime as R. Judah he-Hasid and his student, R. Eleazar of Worms, it is temptingto suggest that these perushim were connected in some way to Hasidei Ashkenazand their leaders. Indeed, two late thirteenth-century Italian works thatfollowed the teachings of the German Pietists also mention these (or related)customs. The author of Sefer Tanya Rabbati writes that he had heard of placeswhere they did not leave the synagogue on the night of Yom Kippur butremained awake reciting penitential prayers (selihot ve-tahanunimu-vidduyim)33 Sefer Mirihag Tov recommends that one stand the entire nighton Yom Kippur in the synagogue, not sleeping at all, and reciting Shir ha-Yihudand other yihudim and baqqashot until daybreak, when the congregationalprayers begin.34 The practice of standing all night and all day on Yom Kippur32See Sefer Rabiah, 2:185, 190; and see also above, n. 19.33Sefer Tanya Rabbati, ed.

The force of R.

Perhaps this development was also a factor in the use of the termperushim by R. Yom Tov of Joigny, although we cannot be absolutely certain that he wasaware of the German position. Three of the most prominent supporters of the Germanposition—R. Simhah of Spires, R. Avigdor Kohen Zedeq, and R. Isaac b. Moses OrZarucf—were also closely connected to Hasidei Ashkenaz, as we shall see below.[Ta-Shma counters effectively Katz's contention that Rabiah held the lenient position. Healso demonstrates that the stringent German position (once again) follows Palestinianhalakhah—which was based on several passages in the Talmud Yerushalmi—while thelenient northern French position was based primarily on Rabbenu Tarn's interpretationof the Bavli.]Similar to R. Yom Tov of Joigny, R. Joseph of Orleans [Bekhor Shor], who was also astudent of Rabbenu Tarn, employs the term perushim to describe individuals whofollowed carefully an established Ashkenazic custom of splitting the second meal intotwo; this would ensure that a third, separate meal could be eaten on the Sabbath. In thisparticular case, however, R. Joseph considers the perushim to be foolhardy (HTOttnnw), since their observance of this custom may lead them to overeat (HDA n^DX), andthis would undermine the legitimacy of the third meal. See Ta-Shma, Minhag AshkenazQadmon (Jerusalem, 1992), 210-12. In all likelihood, the reference in Sefer ha-Orah, ed.Solomon Buber (repr. Jerusalem, 1967), 89, to hasidim who postponed baking mazotuntil as close to Passover as possible connotes individuals who conducted themselvesstringently (according to the German practice, instead of the more lenient Frenchpractice), rather than an organized group of hasidim. Indeed, R. Yehudah he-Hasidhimself agreed with the French position in this instance.

In outlining theproper conduct or form a person must display during the cAmidah prayer inparticular, R.

Given thatR. Abraham b.

If the variants in the JTS manuscript are seen as possible scribalembellishments and ignored (as Raphael did in establishing the main text of Seferha-Manhig), what emerges is that all northern French tosafists called ha-Qadosh by Seferha-Manhig had a pietistic or mystical bent.

Do examples ofPietist-like behavior in northern France and Germany at this time suggest thatGerman Pietists had followers in tosafist circles—aside from those who residedin close geographic proximity—or was this pietism an aspect of the broaderAshkenazic rabbinic culture? To put it differently, thirteenth-century tosafistswho displayed these types of behavior may have received them as traditionsthat originated in the pre-Crusade period, just as the German Pietiststhemselves did. Or they may have been introduced to them by the Pietistsdirectly or through their works.

Moses of CoucySpecific teachings and more general goals of the German Pietists do seemto have had an impact on tosafists in northern France during the thirteenthcentury.71 As we have noted, a school of tosafists in northern France during thefirst half of the thirteenth century—the academy of the brothers R. Moses b.ShneDur and R. Samuel b. ShneDur of Evreux—appears to have internalized anumber of Pietist teachings concerning talmudic study and interpretation.72 Itis helpful to summarize briefly some of the documentation for thatphenomenon, in order to appreciate the extent to which Pietist doctrinesand practices permeated tosafist circles.Many of the Tosafot texts that emerged from this beit midrash—includingthe standard Tosafot to Qiddushin, Nazir, cArakhin, and lemur ah, TosafotR. Samson of Sens to Sotah, and the so-called Tosafot Rashba to Menahot—emphasize simple, straightforward interpretation of the talmudic text. TheseTosafot also seek to clarify and explain Rashi's comments, often reproducingRashi's comments in full, and they contain much less comparative dialecticthan is normally found in Tosafot texts.73 As Haym Soloveitchik and IsraelTa-Shma have demonstrated, the German Pietists were gravely concernedabout the overuse of dialectic and the development of dialectical hiddushim byunqualified students. They wished to promote a talmudic studies that woulddirect the student more clearly in matters of halakhah and allow him to masterthe talmudic text at hand.74 The unusual Tosafot just described would make amajor contribution toward achieving this aim. It is therefore likely that the71Many of the lecazim in SHB are French, and there is a (shortened) northernFrench version of Sefer Hasidim (called \"Sefer Hasiduf) in ms.

Moses of Evreux'streatise, Devarim ha-MevVim Lidei Yir^at ha-Het, referred to above, are found inpassages that stress the need to eliminate haughtiness and replace this tendencywith constant striving for modesty and humility. The demands of extremepersonal humility common to both works include not walking at one's fullestheight or stature, not looking directly into the face of another, and the need toalways remember that every thought a person has and every act he performs isdone before the Almighty and must be for the sake of Heaven.87 Moreover, asignificant number of manuscript copyists transcribed Sejer ha-Yifdh (which[Ritba, c. 1300, recorded by R.

Shokek, Ha-Teshuvah be-Sifrut ha-Musarha-cIvrit, 77-88. This formulation is similar to a passage in Rabbenu Yonah's (Ye-)Sodha-Teshuvah: A person should continue to afflict himself over prior sins that he hasalready overcome. If a person is not strong enough to withstand harsh afflictions andfasts, he should at least resist his desires. He should not allow his desires to be fulfilledregarding food and drink. As Rabad said, a significant means of restraint concerns thewithholding of food. This does not mean a person should give up meat and wineentirely Rather, when a person eats and still has the desire to eat more, he shouldabstain in honor of the Creator and not satiate fully his desires. This behavior will keepa person from sin and remind him of the precept to love the Creator more effectivelythan fasting once a week. Each day, as he eats and drinks, he should deny his desires inhonor of his Creator. [On Rabad and asceticism, see above, n. 6.]91See Shcfarei Teshuvah, 3:82, and cf. Saperstein, \"Christians and Christianity in theSermons of Jacob Anatoli,\" (above, n. 55). Rabbenu Perez, in a gloss to Sefer MizvotQatan, sec. 175, cites a version of this formulation in the name of Rabbenu Yonah:While it is inappropriate to tear one's clothing more than is required or destroy one'sproperty as a sign of mourning over a death, and while it is also inappropriate to abuseor weaken one's body, e.g., by fasting, as a reaction to one's troubles or to mourn a loss,one who grieves and fasts for his sins is considered commendable.

But it must also be noted that the academy of Evreux was alsocharacterized by a fair degree of openness. The brothers of Evreux producedTosafot texts that adhered to the classic style of tosafist dialectic,95 and theyallowed younger students to decide matters of religious law and open theirown study halls in ways that would seem antithetical to the teachings of hasidutAshkenaz96 Although the voice of German Pietism, or at least its spirit, appearsto have called out to the study hall at Evreux, Pietist teachings were notfollowed blindly or even completely.Similar problems of classification and transmission arise with respect toR.

Moses was a direct heirof the leading tosafists of the twelfth century—Rabbenu Tarn and Ri—andsome of his Tosafot have survived.98 But R. Moses is best known for two relatedactivities that were not undertaken by these earlier tosafists. He composed afull-fledged halakhic code, Sefer Mizvot Gadol (Semag). And he preached inAshkenazic locales, but especially in Spain, about precepts that were beingneglected out of confusion, ignorance, or lack of interest.99 Indeed, R. Mosesindicates that his preaching experiences led him, in part, to compose Semag.100The image of Hasidei Ashkenazcan be seen in both these enterprises. AsIsrael Ta-Shma has noted, the spate of halakhic works spawned by tosafists inthe last part of the twelfth century and throughout the first half of thethirteenth century—works such as R.

Andyet, other affinities or connections between R. Moses of Coucy and hasidutAshkenaz have been identified. Jacob Katz linked the approach taken byR. Moses of Coucy in preaching and writing about Jewish-Gentile relations tohasidut Ashkenaz. Like Sefer Hasidim, R. Moses employed moral considerationsbeyond the letter of talmudic law, ruling more stringently than other tosafistson certain forms of Jewish-Gentile contact and urging his fellow Jews toespouse a high standard of moral perfection in order to justify theirredemption, even in the eyes of the Gentiles.107There are also several significant similarities between R. Moses andR. Yonah of Gerona that lead back to Hasidei Ashkenaz. Unique among leadingmedieval talmudists, both men publicly preached derashot and offeredadmonition on similar issues, utilizing similar styles.

Ta-Shma is inclined to think the sermon was from R. Moses ofCoucy, based on parallel passages in Semag and the feeling of closeness to theredemption that R. Moses affected—which also explains partially the great success heenjoyed (by his own account) in getting thousands of Spanish Jews to repent and returnto fuller observances. The letter, which may have been from R. Moses to the people ofhis hometown or region in northern France, comes from a Torah scholar who traveledto a faraway land to preach and arrived in a particular city where he achieved greatsuccess, especially in the realm of communal Torah study. He decided to stay a littlewhile longer there, to address certain difficulties that had arisen. While the overall thrustand circumstances of the letter accord more with the career of R. Moses, R. Jonah alsotraveled a great deal, stressing Torah study and ethical teachings in addition toestablishing yeshivot. Indeed, the language of the letter and the details of its authors ownscholarly writings accord more with Rabbenu Yonah. In any event, Ta-Shma's admittedinability to draw any definitive conclusions on the question of authorship demonstrateseffectively the pronounced similarities between Rabbenu Yonah and R. Moses of Coucyin terms of career, religious orientation, and expression. Note also the significant parallelbetween Semag, mizyat caseh 3 and R.

This position is held also by Semag (and Semaq).Rabbenu Yonah's position appears to have been closer to that of R.

While a person is asleep,he is in effect shackled, since he has no control over his body. Uponawakening, he must therefore offer a blessing for each of his limbs \"that hadbeen bound, but has now been released, so that you may use them for yourbenefit (Dm ^njpn nwvb)\" This passage further relates the actions of a hasidwho blessed his various limbs and prayed that each of them would be faithfulto their Creator and not be the cause of sin.114 A passage in Semag has all3Semag, caseh 16 (fol. 69a). Galinsky, \"Rabbenu Mosheh mi-Coucy ke-Hasid,\"29-30, argues that Semag is referring here to the first supplication described in thepreceding note (Bodl. 1118). While Galinsky notes some suggestive parallels betweenthis first text and other passages in R. Moses' corpus, in his view the second text (Bodl.554) appears to reflect concepts that were more central to hasidut Ashkenaz. One of themain distinctions between the two texts that Galinsky suggests, however—that ofbaqqashah versus tefillah—cannot be maintained throughout the manuscript variants.Thus, for example, the version of the first text found in Bodl. 1114 (see the precedingnote) is entitled lYipn TXum \"in rten (rather than baqqashah). Moreover, the manuscriptjuxtaposition described in the preceding note indicates similarities between writings ofthe German Pietists and the first text as well. Finally, the requirement of bowing duringthe supplication expressed in Semag appears specifically in the second text. See also Y.D. Gilat, \"Tiqqunei ha-Guf bi-Shecat Tefillah (hecarah),\" Sidra 7 (1991):159. Urbach,BaQalei ha-Tosafot, 1:469-70, describes this passage in caseh 16—together with severalthat precede it and others found in nearby sections—as reflecting the intense penitentialstyle of the German Pietists without the aspect of teshuvat ha-mishqal (in which thepenitent must afflict himself physically in a manner judged to Ite commensurate orproportional to the pleasure he received from his sin).

Solomon Buber,124a-b), whose Ashkenazic manuscript versions are replete with passages reflectingdistinctly Ashkenazic customs and traditions (see below, ch. 3, n. 13), lists the names ofthe limbs and the precepts they are suited to perform. Both the Midrash Tehillim passageand the SHB passage cite the verse that was also used by Sefer Hasidim to support thepietistic practice of swaying during prayer; see above, n. 59. Malachi Beit-Arie, \"Birkatha-Evarim,\" Tarbiz 56 (1987):265-72, cogently suggests that a series of actual blessingscollected in a listing entitled \"blessings of the limbs\" (found in ms. Bodl. 1105, fols.436v-438v) was composed by a member of the German Pietists as a reflection of theinstruction in Sefer Hasidim.

Although this passage is based almost verbatim on aformulation in R.

By recognizing this, the human being will serve the Almighty withgreat love and will strive to do as many mizvot as possible, since he knows hecannot repay the Almighty's kindness in full. Semags approach to hovatha-Devarim is consonant with the material in Sefer Hasidim. It should also benoted that Hasidei Ashhenaz were familiar with Sefer Hakhmoni and wereinfluenced by it in a number of contexts.116Judah Galinsky has recently sought to portray R. Moses of Coucy as anorthern French hasid, a tosafist deeply interested in promoting thedevelopment of ethical behavior and proper character traits, rather than assomeone under the direct influence of the German Pietists. Galinskydemonstrates that while R. Moses' formulations with regard to the primacyof truthfulness in all dealings and forums seem to draw both conceptually andlinguistically upon Sefer Hasidim, his formulations with respect to humility andanger do not. To be sure, these two character traits are also discussedextensively in Sefer Hasidim, and the ideological positions found in SeferHasidim are close to those taken by Semag. Nonetheless, a pattern of directinfluence is not evident with regard to these issues. Rather, it appears thatR. Moses based his positions on those of Rashi.117In addition, Galinsky notes that R.

Moses attached no importance to fasting or other forms ofself-denial. R. Moses' hasidut expresses itself through dedicated Torah study,unquestioning service of the Creator, and especially through intereaction withothers. By being particularly humble, slow to anger, and steadfastly honest, thehasid serves his Maker as well, and indeed, truly comes to know Him.Concerns expressed by R. Moses about the need to control one's impulses mayhave been derived as much from Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, upon whichSemag was based, as from the writings of the German Pietists. In Galinsky'sview, the (northern French) pietism represented by R. Moses of Coucy wasinterested neither in philosophical teachings nor in mystical studies orpractices as means of perceiving the Divine realm. The northern French hasid,R. Moses of Coucy, was able to address certain issues in Jewish thought withoutrecourse to the German Pietists and their esotericism.118Galinsky also questions Ta-Shma's focus on the influence of HasideiAshkenaz in R. Moses' attempt at halakhic codification. He suggests there werea number of other motives that propelled R. Moses to write his work, includingthe requests of individuals and the importance of adjusting the Mishneh Torahfrom an Ashkenazic perspective. Moreover, R. Moses wished to provide aproper vehicle for Torah study Had he merely wished to give practical halakhicguidance to the masses, he could have written a much more compact, basicwork. In addition, R. Moses refers to the dream he had in which he wasinstructed to compose the work he did.119As we have noted, however, R. Moses of Coucy had significant affinitieswith Hasidei Ashkenaz, many of which are acknowledged by Galinsky. EvenR. Moses' concern with and treatment of humility and anger is similar to theapproaches of the Pietists, as well as to those of R. Moses of Evreux andRabbenu Yonah.120 Moreover, the special supplications for one seekingpenance, common to both Hasidei Ashkenaz and R. Moses of Coucy, represent ashared view121—even if R.

The German Pietists, however, recognized theimportance of Bible study as a separate discipline in both the exoteric andesoteric realms, and their commentaries reflect this view. R. Moses' affinity withthe German Pietists and his role as a darshan, which is also consistent withPietist thought as we have seen, may explain his unique efforts at Torahcommentary.123Semag fits the profile of a halakhic work that is consonant with theapproach of hasidut Ashkenaz, regardless of any other expressed motivations.Giving practical halakhic guidance was precisely the aim of the directives inSefer Hasidim12^ R. Moses' stated reliance on a dream that directed him tocompose Semag,125 and his acknowledgment of another dream that dictatedthe inclusion of \"Vp^K \"n nK mti/n K1? as a mizvat lo tcfaseh despite the fact that122Urbach, Bacalei ha-Tosajot, 1:478-79.123See my Jewish Education and Society, 75-90, and my \"The Role of Bible Study inMedieval Ashkenaz,\" The Frank Talmage Memorial Volume, ed.

AsGalinsky notes (\"R. Mosheh mi-Coucy ke-Hasid,\" 6, n. 6), considerations ofJewish-Christian polemic may have also played a role in R. Moses' commentary.Among tosafists, R. Isaiah di Trani also composed a systematic Torah commentary, afuller version of which has been discovered only recently. He too had connections withthe German Pietists, via his German tosafist teachers. See, e.g., ms. Moscow-Guenzberg303, fols. 63r, 68v, 65r, 87v, 97r; Israel Ta-Shma, \"Sefer 'Nimmuqei Humash'le-R.

Moses' planned literary endeavor,raise certain questions. Were they inspired through mystical means or conjuredmagically, or were they agitated by R. Moses' deep convictions and spirituality,without any form of magical or mystical manipulation?128R. Moses refers to an unidentified heavenly reason (D^tt/n ]12 m^u) thatimpelled him to travel to various locales preaching the observance of thecommandments.129 While this term need not reflect an actual mysticalexperience on the part of R. Moses,130 the messianism which he espoused—and which may have been part of his (heavenly) reason for wanting to bringothers to a higher level of observance—was linked to forms of propheticdreams and expressions that existed in Ashkenaz in his day131 As we shall see,R. Judah he-Hasid and his father, R. Samuel, were involved in propheticmessianism, as were other thirteenth-century tosafists engaged in mysticalactivities.132 A manuscript passage contains R.

Moses of Coucy was amongthose (northern French) tosafists who were significantly involved with mysticalstudies. His strong manifestations of pietistic leanings are, however, without134question.It is entirely possible, as Galinsky has proposed, that there was anorthern French version of hasidut, with R. Moses of Coucy as one of its primeexemplars. Like the brothers of Evreux, R. Moses remained a dedicated tosafistand continued to pursue tosafist methods and intellectual values. It should notbe expected that he would espouse a hasidut completely identical to that of theGerman Pietists.The establishment of this phenomenon, however, begs several questions.Where and with whom did it originate, and how did R. Moses acquire pieces ofmaterial that are quite similar to Pietist teachings? In light of the affinities thathave been noted, it is difficult to imagine that this branch of hasidut had acompletely separate development from hasidut Ashkenaz- Indeed, even if Rashiwere one of the sources for French Pietism, we shall see that he too was familiarwith several aspects of pre-Crusade torat ha~sod135 Based on all the material Ihave presented thus far—including the pre-Crusade manifestations of pietyand character development, and the practices attributed to Hasidei Zarefat bySefer ha-Manhig—the most likely possibility is that both the northern Frenchand German forms of hasidut emerged from common aspects of the rabbinicculture of early Ashkenaz. Thus, R. Moses of Coucy may have received certainpietistic teachings from sources within Hasidei Ashkenaz, and he may havederived others from either pre-Crusade traditions or twelfth-century northernFrench predecessors.136134Cf. Galinsky, \"R. Mosheh mi-Coucy ke-Hasid,\" 59-61, and idem, \"Da Det E-loheiAvikha ve-cAvdehu,\" 59-64. Although I agree with Galinsky that R. Moses was notphilosophically inclined (cf. above, introduction, at n. 1), his contention that R. Moseswished to suppress esotericism in the same manner as Rashbam (cf. below, ch. 3, nn.67-69) has not been amply demonstrated. Cf. also below, n. 156.135See below, ch. 3, sec. 2. Rashi was not inclined, however, toward asceticism orperishut; see above, n. 22.136Sefer Yere^im by R. Eliezer of Metz (whose affinities with Hasidei Ashkenaz havebeen noted [above, n. 105]) had a significant influence on Semag. See, e.g., Urbach,Bacalei ha-Tosafot, 1:474, and Galinsky, \"Rabbenu Mosheh mi-Coucy ke-Hasid,\" 11-12.In theory, the same two paths were open to Rabbenu Yonah at Evreux, although hisrelationship with German Pietism in particular appears to have been highly developed.[Regarding R.

A number of medievalrabbinic sources record customs concerning the positioning of the handsduring the cAmidah. No discussion of how to position the hands is found,however, in the writings of any German authorities, including HasideiAshkenaz. Indeed, the issue was hardly even mentioned in German rabbinicliterature. Rabiah and Sefer Or Zarucf cite a talmudic passage that sometimesserved as the basis for one practice, but they offer no discussion or direction.137On the other hand, both Sefer ha-Yir^ah and Semag offer practical instructions.Rabbenu Yonah discusses how to hold one's hands while praying (the rightabove the left) and where to place them while sitting or standing duringprayer.138 R. Moses of Coucy notes that one ought to \"stretch his handsheavenward\" while reciting the confessional (yiddui) to atone for one's sins.139Thus, two northern French hasidim, R. Jonah and R. Moses of Coucy, dealtwith these forms of pietistic practice, while the German Pietists werecompletely silent about them.140Pietism and the pre-Crusade period have been firmly established; see my JewishEducation and Society, 86-91, and above, introduction, n. 13.137See Eric Zimmer, \"Tiqqunei ha-Guf bi-Shecat ha-Tefillah,\" Sidra 5 (1989): 101[=c0lam ke-Minhago Noheg, 84].138See Zimmer, \"Tiqqunei ha-Guf,\" 102. Zimmer regards R. Yonah as a Sefardicrabbinic scholar in this context, rather than as a student of northern France, despite theappearance of the passage in Sefer ha-Yir^ah; cf. above, at n. 84. Zimmer further suggeststhat material from R. Aharon ha-Kohen of Lunel's Orhot Hayyim may have had an impactupon R. Jonah (DHH K^fc). This suggested pattern of transmission is difficult to accept,however. Orhot Hayyim was composed after R. Jonah's works and cites R. Jonah by nameon a number of occasions, once specifically in conjunction with Sefer ha-Yir^ah; see my\"Rabbinic Figures in Castilian Kabbalistic Pseudepigraphy,\" 92, n. 52, and above, n. 85.[Views similar to that of R. Jonah concerning the positioning of the hands during prayerare also found in the pietistic Sefer Minhag Tov (see above, n. 34) and later in the biblicalcommentary of the kabbalist Rabbenu Bahya b. Asher. For the possible impact ofChristian ritual on this aspect of Jewish prayer practice, cf. Daniel Sperber, MinhageiYisraW 3 (Jerusalem, 1994), 88-91; 4:71-74; and H. Soloveitchik in AJS Review 23(1998): 225.]139See Semag, caseh 16, and Gilat (above, n. 113).140This development is somewhat curious, in light of the fact that Hasidei Ashkenazwere generally quite interested in various kinds of movement during prayer, as we haveseen. This practice is not mentioned in Sefer ha-Manhig, either. On the other hand, asnoted by Zimmer (\"Tiqqunei ha-Guf,\" 99-100), Ramban, the Zohar, and othermystically inclined sources of the period endorse it. Cf. Marcus, \"Prayer Gestures inGerman Hasidism\" (above, n. 60).80"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Asceticism, Pietism, and PerishutThe small number of full-fledged students who have been associatedwith the Pietists (not to mention the absence of any Pietist communities orsettlements) belies the extent to which certain of their values were broadlyheld—especially those values that were part of Ashkenazic rabbinic culture inthe pre-Crusade period. Whether or not the German Pietists were the source,we have been able to discover various forms of hasidut and perishut withinrabbinic circles in both northern France and Germany. As we shall now see, thepresence of these phenomena continued and even intensified in the second halfof the thirteenth century, perhaps under more direct Pietist influence.The Case of R. Isaac of CorbeilR. Isaac b. Joseph of Corbeil (d.c.1280) was a northern French tosafist.Like R. Moses of Coucy, he authored a halakhic code, known as cAmmudeiGolah or Sefer Mizvot Qatan. Indeed, R. Isaacs work owes much to R. Moses'Sefer Mizvot Gadol in terms of content and approach, even as it employs asomewhat different style of presentation.141 In addition, it appears that R. Isaacshared a number of more overtly pietistic affinities with R. Judah he-Hasid andwith his student, R. Eleazar of Worms, reflecting a significant measure ofinfluence.R. Isaac recorded all four modes of penance that were the hallmarks ofthe penitential programs of both R. Judah and R. Eleazar. These includeteshuvat ha-mishqal and teshuvat ha-katuv, which often required the penitent toundergo harsh physical afflictions.142 This inclusion is rendered even moresuggestive by the fact that R. Abraham b. Azriel—a devoted Pietist student of141See Israel Ta-Shma, \"Isaac ben Joseph of Corbeil,\" Encyclopaedia Judaica vol. 9,21-22, and idem, \"Hasidut Ashkenaz bi-Sefarad,\" 168, n. 8.142cAmmudei Golah (=Sefer Mizvot Qatan [Semaq], Kapust, 1820), sec. 53: wn \"inmnn raitem byvmn ranpn mron \"iwn -mn nmurn :nn mi^n.

Eleazar of Worms at the beginning of its treatment of prayer. Thematerial on prayer begins with a discussion of the need for proper kavvanah.Semaq defines kavvanah as thinking about the meaning of each word andmaking sure that not one word is skipped, taking the same care one uses whencounting coins. German Pietists underscored the importance of not skipping orchanging a word or even a single letter of prayer, since this would disturb theinternal harmony and overall efficacy of the prayers. Indeed, they counted andanalyzed the number of words and letters in many prayers, as a means ofarriving at each prayer's inner meaning. They believed that reciting the liturgyslowly and accurately unlocks the esoteric meanings of the prayers and, at thesame time, faithfully preserves ancient rabbinic formulae.152R. Isaac writes that if one cannot have proper kavvanah throughout allthe blessings of the Shemoneh cEsreh, one should at least try to maintainkavannah during the first three blessings (the unit entitled Avot) and during theblessing of Modim:And R.

Isaac cites R. Judah he-Hasid by name just once in Sefer Mizyot Qatan,but the context and location give the citation prominence. In delineating theextent to which one must be prepared to give up his life to sanctify the DivineName (cal qiddush ha-Shem), R. Isaac, like other medieval Ashkenazichalakhists, extends some of the basic parameters found in talmudicliterature.155 He notes that while, strictly speaking, a Jew whose life isthreatened by a non-Jew may transgress all prohibitions (with the exceptions ofadultery, murder or idolatry) in order to save himself, it is a middat hasidut—acommendable act of unusual piety—not to transgress any prohibition evenunder the penalty of death. R. Isaac includes this discussion at the verybeginning of his work (in the third precept discussed), as part of the precept todemonstrate love for the Almighty Qahavat ha-Shem).The second of two anecdotal proofs that R. Isaac presents in support ofhis position involves R. Judah he-Hasid. Semaq recounts an incident in whichRabbi Judah instructed his students not to travel to attend a wedding becausearmed robbers frequented the road they would have to take.

Judah he-Hasid, ispresented in Sefer Orhot Hayyim as the explanation of R. Isaac of Corbeil.\"R. Isaac of Corbeil (Ha-Ri mi-Corbeil) wrote: I heard that Joshua instituted it[cAleynu] at the time that he conquered the land [of Israel] and he inscribedhis name of humility [shem qatnuto (his original name), Hosheac] in reverse[tpp^K Kin =n ^y-ro utrulKi =1 Mpbn u\\u *6t? =u/ ,mwb why =y].[Therefore,] One who says [DWD] umK ^nK errs [since the vav of Hosheacwould be supplanted by Dalef, the first letter of ^IK].\"161Two extant traditions from R. Judah he-Hasid concern Joshua's author-ship of cAleynu. One is that the prayer contains 152 words, which is thegematria (numerical) equivalent of his father's name, pJ p (bin Nun). Thesecond is that Joshua composed this prayer when the Jewish people enteredthe land of Israel and began to capture various cities and regions. \"Joshua sawthe many man-made idols which were being destroyed and authored thishymn of praise to God. He inscribed his name in it backward, at the beginningof each verse, for reasons of modesty, so that not all would understand that hehad composed it.\" The letters and their related phrases are then spelled out toform Hosheac, exactly as they are in the Orhot Hayyim passage attributed toR.

These include materialon nehush and siman (symbolic devination),163 tokekhah (admonition andrebuke),164 monetary compensation for the teaching or study of Torah,165 andthe extent of a woman's obligation to study Torah.166 R. Isaac's relationshipwith Hasidei Ashkenaz also helps to account for a recurring pattern inmanuscript collections. Copyists from the late thirteenth and early fourteenthcenturies and beyond juxtaposed Semaq with works of Hasidei Ashkenaz,suggesting that a perception developed quickly that these works were related.162Ms. Kaufmann A399, fol. 50r, cited in ^Arugat ha-Bosem, ed.

He proposes theyear 1212 for the redemption, in the name of another scholar (Goldmintz, 190). Thiswould suggest he is definitely not the tosafist R. Avigdor b. Elijah Katz of Vienna, whowas a student of R. Simhah of Spires and died c.1275 (see below, at n. 28, and cf.

Although there are a number ofcommon methodologies and even some exact parallels between Bodl. 2273 and thebiblical commentary from the school of R. Avigdor b. Elijah (see above, n. 6), these areneither sufficiently weighty nor numerous enough to overcome the large chronologicaldisparity. (Perhaps R. Avigdor b. Elijah had the commentary of the other R.

Samuel of Bamberg demonstrate hisfamiliarity not only with the liturgical interpretations of the German Pietists,but also with their insistence that particular nushcfot be preserved precisely, inorder to retain their internal structure and harmony. Only in this way could thefull effects of these prayers be realized, in both exoteric and esoteric realms.Moreover, R. Samuel of Bamberg offered a scriptural derivation of asignificant aspect of hasidut Ashkenaz, which was cited elsewhere in the name ofR. Judah he-Hasid. Part of the German Pietists' search for the larger Divine Willentailed emphasizing the thoughts and feelings that lay behind an act, as wellas the notion that the intellectual ability to discern, rather than the fixed age oflegal adulthood alone, determined responsibility for one's deeds. This principlewas derived, in two passages in Sefer Hasidim, from the case of Er and Onan(following the approach of one version of Midrash Tanhuma that they wereeight or nine years old), and from instances involving other biblical figures.The derivation is also cited in R. Judah he-Hasid's biblical commentary [whichwas compiled by his son R. Moses Zal(t)man] and in R. Judah he-Hasid's namein several collections of so-called tosafist biblical interpretations.2221See Joseph Perles, \"Die Berner Handschrift des Kleinen Arukh,\" Jubelschrift zumsiebzigten Geburstage des Prof. Dr. H.

Munich 423, 55a [=Bodl. 1102, fol. 21].According to Ta-Shma, \"Quntresei Sodot ha-Tefillah\" (above, n. 15), which seeks tomodify significantly the earlier conclusions of Joseph Dan concerning R. Judahhe-Hasid's disdain for the inaccuracy of northern French prayer texts in particular,R. Asher received material on the sodot ha-teflllah of Hasidei Ashkenaz in the form of atreatise compiled by the brother-in-law of R. Judah he-Hasids brother, R. Abraham.R. Asher edited, embellished, and distributed this treatise. Indeed, it was he (and notR. Judah he-Hasid or R. Eleazar of Worms) who incorporated the anti-French animusthat has been associated with German Pietists. Emanuel, \"Ha-Polmos cal Nosahha-Tefillah,\" construes the process of transmission somewhat differently, concluding thatthe treatise under discussion was composed by an unknown student of R. SamuelBamberg (although like Ta-Shma, Emanuel also removes R. Judah he-Hasid, andprobably R. Eleazar of Worms as well, from any passages which express a particularanti-French bias). Emanuel demonstrates conclusively that R. Judah and his immediatestudents were concerned about any version, be it French or German, that deviated fromtheir own precisely formulated liturgical readings. Cf. cArugat ha-Bosem, ed.

If a minoris as perspicacious as a twenty-year-old, then he is punished. And proof may bebrought from Samuel [the prophet], whom Eli wanted to punish for issuing ahalakhic ruling in his presence, even though he [Samuel] was only two yearsold.\" This passage is cited elsewhere, in shorter form but with exact linguisticparallels, in the name of R. Samuel of Bamberg.23On the basis of parallel passages in Yerushalmi Pe^ah (8:8) and Sheqalim(5:4), Sefer Hasidim instructs that funds which an individual has available forcharity are best given to righteous scholars involved in the study of Torah forits own sake (le-yir^ei ha-Shem ha-cosqin be-Torah lishmah), rather than towardthe building of (additional) houses of worship. R. Samuel of Bamberg is citedas adducing one of these Yerushalmi passages to prove that it is preferable togive charity to teach young men (onw TittD*]^), rather than to give charity tothe synagogue.24R. Samuel's affinities with the liturgical teachings and commentaries ofthe German Pietists may have come to him through his father, R. Barukh b.Samuel of Mainz. R. Barukh was a payyetan and tosafist halakhist whoauthored the voluminous and oft-cited, but no longer extant, Seferha-Hokhmah. According to E. E. Urbach, it was R. Barukh who asked23Ms. B. M., Or. 9931 [=Gaster 730 (Ashkenaz, fourteenth century)], fol. 16r. (Cf.Nimmuqei Humash le-R. Yeshayah, ed. C. B. Chavel, 28.) The formulation of R. Samuel ofBamberg was preserved by (a student of) R. Yedidyah b. Israel (of Nuremberg) as part ofa collection of Ashkenazic biblical comments. This compilation contains numerousinterpretations from the tosafists R. Jacob and Joseph of Orleans and R. Yom Tov ofJoigny. It also cites R. Judah he-Hasid frequently, as well as other figures who wereconnected to his teachings, such as R. Yaqar ha-Levi of Cologne (26v-27r) and R.

Judah he-Hasid about how to deal with the obligation of reciting QerVatShema in the morning, by the prescribed time, on those festivals and occasionswhere the length of the prayer service made reaching that deadline impossible.R.

R. Judah demonstrated some of his pointsusing piyyutim of R. Simeon ha-Gadol and R. Eleazar ha-Qallir. As a payyetanand interpreter of piyyutim, R. Barukh would have been most interested inR. Judah's guidance, and indeed, Urbach maintains, it is possible to see theinfluence of R. Judah in R. Barukh's work.25This influence can also be found in the work of R. Barukh's seniorcolleague on the Mainz rabbinical court, R. Ephraim b. Jacob of Bonn.26 Recent25See cArugat ha-Bosemy ed. Urbach, 4:94-96. Cf.

Barukh studied with R. Judah b.Qalonymus b. Meir in Spires, with R. Eliezer of Metz, and with R. Moses b. Solomonha-Kohen of Mainz, whom he replaced on the rabbinical court of Mainz.

Barukh, was aprolific commentator on piyyut and liturgy, in addition to authoring responsa andhiddushim to a number of tractates. See zArugat ha-Bosem, ed. Urbach, 4:39-51. He wasin contact with R. Judah he-Hasid (who appears to have been slightly younger thanR. Ephraim), with R. Judah's brother R. Abraham, and with Rivaq of Spires, and he mayhave received material from R. Samuel he-Hasid. Like Hasidei Ashkenaz, he countedcarefully the number of words in various prayers and offered interpretations based onthose numbers. Cf. Mahzor Vitry, 519, and cArugat ha-Bosem, 4:110, n. 30. R.

The problem of fasting on Roshha-Shanah serves as an illustration. Although it was not discussed explicitly ineither the Babylonian or Palestinian Talmud, by the early geonic period aPalestinian custom had developed to fast on Rosh ha-Shanah as an additionalmeasure of repentance. Leading Babylonian Geonim were aware of this customand condemned it; Rosh ha-Shanah was a festival, and special meals weretherefore required. Although R. Nissim Gaon of Kairwan offered some supportfor fasting, the medieval Sefardic orbit followed the position of the BabylonianGeonim. Moreover, Rabiah, Rizba, R. Eleazar of Worms, R. Simhah of Spires,and Shibbolei ha-Leqet all prohibited fasting, despite the awareness on the partof some that there were still individuals in Ashkenaz who did fast—and thatthis practice extended back to early Ashkenaz. Not surprisingly, among thosewho fasted was R. Judah he-Hasid36In the mid-thirteenth century, a new series of discussions on this matterwas initiated by colleagues, students, and followers of R. Judah he-Hasid. Mostsignificant about these discussions was not only the position taken by some tofast, but also their argumentation. All of the earlier rabbinic discussionsrevolved around halakhic constructs, such as the nature of Rosh ha-Shanah as ayom tov (should it be considered akin to the shalosh regalim) or the controversybetween the Tannaim R. Joshua and R. Eliezer as to whether a yom tov shouldbe celebrated primarily through festive meals or through Torah study (in whichcase fasting might be permissible).In one of these newer exchanges, it was reported that R. Abraham Haldiqof Bohemia, a halakhic decisor connected to Hasidei Ashkenaz,37 fasted on Roshha-Shanah. His proof was a somewhat unusual kal va-homer from a fast thatwas permitted on the Sabbath, the tdranit halom, which was undertaken as the36For a fully-documented discussion of this issue, see Yaakov Gartner, GilguleiMinhag be-cOlam ha-Halakhah (Jerusalem, 1995), 74-96.

Abraham reasoned that if a tcfanit halom waspermitted on the Sabbath—even though it is unclear if the dream was broughton by an angel (in which case its contents are genuine) or by a demon (inwhich case the contents are contrived)—one may certainly fast on Roshha-Shanah when all are being judged by the Almighty (in order to avoid a harshjudgment).R. Abraham b. Azriel, the well-known Pietist student of R. Eleazar ofWorms, disagreed with this reasoning. In the case of a negative dream, if in factit was transmitted by an angel, a person must fast, and it is for this reason (inorder that he fast and repent) that Heaven revealed the dream to him. But as forRosh ha-Shanah, it is possible that the person is due to receive a positivejudgment, so there is no need for him to fast. And if a person knows that hehas sinned, let him fast prior to Rosh ha-Shanah. A R. Yizhaq, however, assertedin the name of ha-R. Abraham (Haldiq?) that one must fast so that \"your tableshouldn't be full while the Almighty's is empty\" The explanation given for thisphrase is that while the number of bullocks offered on all other festivals is atleast two, on Rosh ha-Shanah only one is offered, and the portion which theAlmighty receives is therefore diminished. R. [Abraham b.] Azriel respondedthat if this is so, one would also have to fast on Shemini cAzeret, because onlyone bullock was offered then as well. Additional proofs to prohibit fasting onRosh ha-Shanah were apparently offered, but they were not reproduced in thisversion of the exchange.38E. E. Urbach thought originally that the R. Yizhaq who cited R. AbrahamHaldiq was R. Yizhaq Or Zaruac.39 But in Sefer Or Zaruac itself the samediscussion is recorded between scholars from Prague and Regensburg, onegeneration earlier. \"My teacher R. Isaac b.

What is striking here is that all of the rabbinic scholars involvedare from Regensburg, Austria, and Bohemia—locations which have recentlybeen shown to have had a fairly high degree of fealty to R. Judah he-Hasid.Indeed, Israel Ta-Shma has explained that R. Judah he-Hasid's move from Spiresto Regensburg was an attempt to be closer to his students and followers incentral and eastern Europe.41In a related development, Eric Zimmer has demonstrated that minhagAustreikh (Osterreich), which tended to follow the halakhic rulings andpositions of R. Judah he-Hasid, is generally more stringent than minhag Reinus(Rhineland), where R. Judah's teachings were less accepted. In a number ofcases (e.g., the status of dam tohar and the counting of shivcah neqiyyim), themore stringent position was also found in northern France in the pre-Crusadeperiod or in the early twelfth century, suggesting that R. Judah favored olderFrench customs over Rhineland practices.42 Zimmer sees additional supportfor his claim in the finding of Y. M. Pelles, that the customs of R. HayyimPalti^el and R. Abraham Haldiq, which reflect minhag Austreikh on the whole aswell as the customs of Magdeburg in particular, were based on minhagim ofsifrut de-Vei Rashi*3 This thesis yields two conclusions.

Ta-Shma hasidentified a number of central and eastern European rabbinic scholars who werecommitted followers (in terms of halakhic rulings) of R. Judah he-Hasid. His research isbased in large measure on manuscripts, including three related ones that containhalakhic and other material from the German Pietists and from Regensburg (Cambr. Or.786 [see above, n. 18], Bodl. 696 [Ashkenaz, fourteenth/fifteenth centuries], and Bodl.1150 [Ashkenaz, fourteenth century]). Included in this group of scholars, aside fromR. Abraham Haldiq, are such names as R. Moses Fuller, R. Jacob b. Nahman ofMagdeburg, R. Jacob ha-Kohen of Cracow, and R. Moses Taku. On R. Jacob ha-Kohen,see also Sefer Gematrv'ot le-R.

Judah he-Hasidhad a fairly significant impact on Ashkenazic minhagi'm, at least in central andeastern Europe.44 Thus, R. Judah's own proclivities toward fasting, even onRosh ha-Shanah (and on the Sabbath as well), undoubtedly played a role inengendering the discussion about the appropriateness of fasting on Roshha-Shanah*5Moreover, the mode of this discussion is almost meta-halakhic. Neitherapproach deals with the halakhic status of Rosh ha-Shanah as a festival. The firstapproach deals with the nature of dreams and the roles of angels and demons.The response to it does not question the existence of these aspects, but onlytheir impact. The second approach works with a talmudic formulation (Bezah20b, Hagigah 7a), but applies it in a manner that the Talmud does not. TheTalmud uses this concept (in both sugyot) to suggest that those aspects of thesacrificial service and the offerings on a festival that are directed primarily tothe Almighty must be on a par with what is offered on the festival by anindividual for his own consumption. In this case, however, the reasoning isextended and applied to suggest that God must be given more than a personreceives and that one must deny his own needs in order to provide properly forGod. The direction of the argumentation may be explained by the fact that this44See also Zimmer, cOlam ke-Minhago Noheg, 271, 277. Indeed, Zimmer claims(281-83, 286) that R. Judah he-Hasid himself preferred the old mirihag Zarefat, againstRhineland custom, in one instance (concerning the baking of mazot only on cerev Pesahafter hazot or on Pesah itself when the festival began on Saturday night). It remainsunclear, however, whether this is true for R. Eleazar of Worms as well, despitesimilarities between Sefer Roqeah and the sijrut de-Vei Rashi. Cf. Ta-Shma, MinhagAshkenaz ha-Qa&mon, 245-48, and Soloveitchik, \"Three Themes,\" 348-49. For anotherpotential example regarding R. Judah he-Hasid, note that minhag Austreikh was toexempt rashei yeshivah from taxes, while minhag Reinus did not; see Terumat ha-Deshen,#342. Sefer Hasidim was more lenient than the rest of Ashkenaz when it came to taxexemptions; see my Jewish Education and Society, 45-46, 91-95. The difficulty here,however, is that the lenient position of Sefer Hasidim, which perhaps gave rise to minhagAustreikh, appears to have been sui generis. To this point, there is no evidence that theearlier French practice was similar. See also below, n. 86. On the interaction betweenR.

Cf. Yehudah Levi, \"Humrot118"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Pietistic Tendencies in Prayer and RitualRather than advocating one position or the other, R. Meir oftenconcluded that both sides of a halakhic controversy should be represented byor even incorporated into his final ruling. Thus, Maharam ruled that a newfruit or garment should be procured to enable one to make the she-heheyanublessing on the second day of Rosh ha-Shanah. This ruling skirted theunresolved dilemma, stemming from the days of Rashi and his teachers, ofwhether the two days of Rosh ha-Shanah are to be considered one elongatedday or viewed as two separate festival days—in which case the she-heheyanublessing for the festival itself would have to be repeated.56 Similarly, R. Meirruled that a non-Jew should dig the grave and fabricate the coffin and shroudsfor a Jew who was to be buried on the second day of a festival (yom tov shenishel galuyyot), while Jews should carry the coffin. This decision effectivelybridged the opposing positions of R. Isaac Or Zaruac (who held with theSheDiltot that a Jew should not be involved at all in the burial of his dead on yomtov sheni unless no Gentiles were available) and Rabiah (who not only rejectedthe position of the SheDiltot vis-a-vis the second day of yom tov, but alsorequired that Jews carry the coffin if the burial took place on the first day of thefestival.)57 In essence, R. Meir felt that the demands of both opposing halakhicpositions must be satisfied.SeferHasidim, aside from displaying a general tendency toward humra,58offers the following guideline in a section entitled mu/nai rnnu nwrw Tjy(matters of ritual slaughter, purity, and asceticism): \"In all situations whererabbinic scholars argue but there is no issue of monetary loss or damage toothers, and one position is lenient and the other is strict, even if the law isaccording to the lenient view, it is better to follow the stricter view in a situationwhere the two positions do not contradict each other.\"59 This pietistic notionappears to be behind Maharam's legal reasoning, although there were otherAshkenazic decisors who employed a similar strategy before him. A series oftosafists—including R. Barukh of Worms, R. Moses of Coucy R. Samuel ofEvreux, R. Isaac of Corbeil, and finally R. Meir of Rothenburg (and his studentsR. Asher b. Yehiel and R. Mordekhai b.

Anolder Italian pre-Crusade tradition, preserved in Sefer ha-Pardes and ratified by R. Judahhe-Hasid and R. Simhah of Spires (as recorded in Sefer Or Zaruac), and by R. Eleazar ofWorms, R. Eliezer of Metz, and R. Judah b. Qalonymus, recommended making oneblessing on the tefillin shel yad and a second on the tefillin shel rosh. In his talmudiccommentary, Rashi takes the position, held by a number of Spanish authorities, thatonly one blessing should be made for both; Rabbenu Tarn suggests that the one blessingbe made only after both tefillin have been put on. R. Asher b. Yehiel, citing his brother,notes a ruling of R. Samuel of Evreux that since there is a controversy in this matter, it ispreferable to make only one blessing and not make a second about which there is somedoubt. R. Asher himself made only one blessing in his youth but was ultimatelyconvinced that two blessings should be made, as was the widespread practicethroughout northern France and Germany. In this case, the Evreux position, rather thanthe one espoused by Hasidei Ashhenaz, appears to reflect the more conservative view ofhalakhic decision-making. It should be noted, however, that the German Pietists weredefending an older Ashkenazic (Italian) position against the incursion of a newertalmudic interpretation. Indeed, this battle was already under way in the eleventhcentury, as the passage in Sefer Or Zaruac indicates. For all the relevant primary sources,see Ta-Shma, Ha-Nigleh shebe-Nistar, 53-58.61Despite his association with Worms, R. Barukh was a devoted tosafist student ofRi, and his Sefer ha-Terumah reflects the dialectical enterprise in northern France; seeabove, ch. 1, n. 102; Urbach, BaQalei ha-Tosafot, 1:349-50, and esp. n. 27; and my \"ThecAliyah of 'Three Hundred Rabbis' in 1211,\" 202-4, 211-12.

The latter is describedby the author of the commentary as his teacher; he is cited primarily about spiritualissues, such as the nature of miracles and the Shekhinah. Urbach observes that\"R.

These behavioral modes were thought to be part ofthe mystical experience, as they were in the kabbalistic schools of Gerona72 andin the mystical circles of sixteenth-century Safed.73Similarly, Moshe Rosman has argued recently that there was an existing\"mystic-ascetic-hasidic tradition\" in seventeenth- and eighteenth-centuryGermany and Poland that preceded the rise of Hasidism. Rabbinic scholarswho pursued this outlook undertook additional fasts and other physicalpenances, prayed with intense devotion that included both crying and ecstaticmovements, and studied kabbalistic literature, in addition to their regimen ofregular Torah study. Rosman suggests that this tradition was generated in partby a renewed commitment to ideals and practices of Hasidei Ashkenaz,especially with regard to teshuvah7* The pietism and asceticism that underliethe magical and mystical rituals in Hekhalot literature represent furthersuggestive examples of this kind of correlation.75Chapters 1 and 2 have identified a range of pietistic and ascetic behaviorsand outlooks among tosafists and rabbinic figures in medieval Ashkenaz.

Ivan Marcus, mindful of GershomScholem's characterization of hasidut Ashkenaz as \"mystical moralism,\" hasargued that the emphasis placed by R. Eleazar of Worms—in the HilkhotHasidut preamble to his Sefer Roqeah—on the religious perfection of theindividual through personal pietism had as its ultimate goal the preparation ofthe individual for mystical experiences in prayer. R. Eleazar's focus on thedevelopment of spiritual inwardness reaches its climax in the twelfth section ofhis hilkhot hasidut (called shoresh qedushat ha-yihud u-Shemo u-Merkavahve-sodotav), which is, in essence, a mystical tract of contemplation and analysisconcerning yihud ha-Shem.76Peter Schafer has established conceptual and even linguistic parallelsbetween typical ascetic and pietistic practices of hasidut Ashkenaz, andinstructions contained in Hekhalot literature for the one seeking to enter theHeavenly palaces (yored Merkavah). He suggests that this body of earlier Jewishliterature (with which the German Pietists were very familiar, since they servedas its transmitters and editors) was the source of these practices of HasideiAshkenaz—rather than Christian asceticism or other temporal stimuli, such asthe trauma of the Crusades and other intense persecutions.7776See above, ch. 1, n. 5, and cf. K. E. Grozinger, \"Between Magic and Religion—Ashkenazi Hasidic Piety,\" Mysticism, Magic and Kabbalah in Ashkenazi Judaism (Berlin,1995), 28-42. (Marcus also writes [Piety and Society, 85] that even as most followers ofhasidut Ashkenaz were initiated into a life of pietism, they were not initiated \"into themysteries of the esoteric tradition about God.\" At the same time, \"they received guidanceand counsel from [Pietist] Sages who did have such knowledge.\") See also Dan, Toratha-Sod shel Hasidut Ashkenaz, 71-73, and idem, \"Sifrut ha-Yihud shel HasideiAshkenaz,\" Qiryat Sefer 41 (1966):533-44. Although Dan maintains that the area ofsifrut ha-yihud is one of the more exoteric within the thought of Hasidei Ashkenaz (cf.Urbach, Bacalei ha-Tosafot, 1:408-9), he notes that the twelfth section of R. Eleazar'sethical introduction to Sefer Roqeah is a departure from what precedes it. It appears to bean opening into the world of sod for those who studied R. Eleazar's halakhic and pietisticmaterial; see esp. 537 (sec. 7). There are intimations of mystical experience in theopening section of R. Eleazar's hilkhot hasidut and in his discussion of kavvanah in prayer.In the sections on pietism and the study of Torah, however, sod refers to the deep(exoteric) knowledge that Torah scholars acquire through their study of Torah andmusar. These aspects of R. Eleazar's introduction are similar to the program propoundedby Midrash Mishlei. Proper participation in a regular regimen of Torah study can leadultimately to the study of sod.

Nonetheless, thefollowing formulation suggests that he envisions the linkage between hasidutAshkenaz and Hekhalot literature as reflecting a very similar, even commonlyheld, approach to the relationship between pietism and mysticism.Both traditions clearly assume that their adepts, the Hasid and theesoteric of early Jewish mysticism, are capable of wisdom andspecial cognition. Indeed, this confidence in the ability of theirfellows to enjoy a special, deeper insight was perhaps the elementwhich cemented the sense of group solidarity evidenced by thePietists and the Yorede Merkavah.78The tosafists based some of the examples of pietistic and ascetic practicesdescribed in chapters 1 and 2 on Hekhalot practices. In the following chapters,we shall encounter an even wider array of magical and mystical techniques andconcepts (with many based on Hekhalot literature as well) expressed in mostinstances by the same tosafists. The correlation between pietism and mysticismin Hasidei Ashkenaz and, indeed, in Hekhalot literature itself, suggests that thiscorrelation in the tosafist realm cannot be coincidental. As has been noted,tosafists did not pursue the study of theosophy as the Pietists did, and theycannot be properly classified as mystics. Nonetheless, the findings in chapters 1and 2 regarding pietism, asceticism, stringency, and perishut serve as a kind offoundation for the magical and mystical dimensions which can be discernedamong certain tosafists.It is appropriate to close this chapter with an example of how pietismand perishut may directly reflect magical and mystical concerns as well.

Earlytosafists—such as Raban, whose goal was to harmonize accepted practice withthe talmudic corpus—undertook to evaluate these stringencies in light oftalmudic law. This effort produced a rationalistic or legalistic interpretation forthese harhaqot (as a function of ritual impurity) that contributed to theirmitigation.81R. Isaac b. Moses Or Zarucf, however, continued to support many ofthese harhaqot (hoi mah she-yahholDadorn le-hahmir ba-niddah yahmir), becauseof considerations of \"danger\" (ya^ani shamati mi-tacam sakhanah). In doing so,R. Isaac b. Moses of Vienna was perhaps following R. Eleazar of Worms, wholocated their presence in the eleventh-century Ma^aseh ha-Geonim, as a meansof stressing the authentic (and binding) nature of the stringencies. The dangerassociated with the menstruant by R. Isaac—noted also by Nahmanides in hisTorah commentary (in uvm rrtt/W 1*0* \"pbvn pM m ,pm ]byn)—derivesfrom the Baraita de-Massekhet Niddah, in which the menstruant is described aspossessing the ability not only to transmit impurity but also to (magically)impart certain diseases or afflictions, such as boils, leprosy, and physicaldisabilities. Both R. Isaac Or Zaruac and Ramban mention the Baraita in theirformulations.8280See Lieberman, SheqiHn, 22; Zimmer, cOlam ke-Minhago Noheg, 222, and theliterature cited in n. 7; Swartz, Scholastic Mage, 164-65, 214-15; Israel Ta-Shma,'\"Miqdash Mecat'—Ha-Semel veha-Mamashut,\" Knesset Ezra, ed.

Ta-Shma argues that diminutions of the harhaqot had already been advocatedby Rashi. Among tosafists who accepted the diminished levels were R. Eliezer of Metzand Rabiah. Note that while Raban tried to explain away a problematic talmudic passagein order to justify the Ashkenazic custom that a niddah made the blessing following herimmersion (rather than prior to the act, as is normally mandated for the recitation of ablessing), Rabbenu Tarn (and his brother-in-law, R. Samson of Falaise) railed against thiscustom—which is found in the Baraita de-Niddah—in very strong terms. Ri, on theother hand, held that the custom was valid, without accepting Raban's exegesis.Interestingly, these developments form an excellent model or paradigm for the positionstaken by twelfth-century tosafists regarding the efficacy of magic and sod; see the nextchapter, and cf.

The slightest trace of impurity could lead to immediaterecall from a mystical vision.84 Similarly, accounts about Hasidei Ashkenaz andothers who were aware of the mystical and magical powers of Shemot describetheir attempts to keep menstruants far away from Holy Names and rituals thatinvolved them, lest the niddot unwittingly wreak havoc with the Names by theirvery presence.85 Although other tosafist halakhists were aware of the Baraitade-Niddah and were prepared to retain some of its stringencies as bona fidehalakhic humrot—if not demonstrations of piety—R.

For Zimmer, these humrot reflect,for the most part, the pietistic impact and influence of R. Judah he-Hasid, especially (assuggested almost explicitly by R. Meir of Rothenburg) on his followers in the \"outlying\"areas of central and eastern Europe, and thereby on minhag Austreikh in general. Seeabove, n. 44. This pattern of influence is also evident with regard to the ability of a bazalqeri to pray and lead the prayers in the synagogue, and to pronounce the priestlyblessing; see Eric Zimmer, \"Mocadei NesiDat Kappayim,\" Sinai 100 (1987):455-57[=c0lam ke-Minhago Noheg, 135-40; cf. above, n. 51]; and cf.

See Zimmer, cOlam ke-Minhago Noheg, 136; 229-30, nn.37-38; 242, n. 14; 245-48.] Ta-Shma suggests that Ashkenazic rabbinic culture,following the Palestinian tradition, invested the holiness and sanctity of the synagoguewith particular significance and stringency (note, e.g., Sefer YereHm, sec. 104).

Eleazar of Worms, of repeatedly dipping a finger in the cup of wine andreleasing sixteen drops, as the various plague listings are recited during theSeder. According to R. Eleazar, this practice was transmitted by R. Eliezerha-Gadol and his household to subsequent Qalonymides. Some who had notreceived this tradition were apparently unsure of its authenticity and purpose.It was understood by the Qalonymides, however, as a means of summoning orconjuring the sixteen-sided avenging sword of the Almighty. This Divine swordcould diminish the powers of pestilence and other maziqin that wererepresented by the sixteen times the word dever is mentioned in the book ofJeremiah. In addition, the sword could grant meaningful life.

The young initiate then imitated what he heard; heate these foods and the verses on them. One version of this ceremony containsa magical incantation against Potah, the prince of forgetfulness, which wasintended to ensure that the child would succeed in his studies and rememberwhat he learned. Divine Names were invoked to activate this adjuration.18 Inaddition, all the German versions of this ceremony place it on the festival ofShavucot. According to Sax ha-Torah and other Hekhalot magical texts, Shavucotwas the most propitious time to draw down Torah knowledge using magicaltechniques, for it was then that adepts would conjure the Sax ha-Torah.19Ivan Marcus, in his analysis of the initiation ceremony, cites formulationsfrom R. Eleazar ha-Qallir, R. Sacadyah Gaon, and Sefer Razi^el (a work thatoften reflects geonic and other early medieval traditions) as models of magicaltechniques for \"acquiring wisdom\" or petihat ha-lev that involved the eating ofcakes or eggs.20 The procedure for achieving petihat ha-lev through the eatingof the magical egg, as outlined in ms.

Thus, although Rashi was aware of the esoteric approach to thecreation of the world, he interpreted the biblical Creation story and othersections of the Torah as being interested primarily in imparting a didacticmessage that would mold man's behavior, rather than in transmittingtheological constructs.42 Nonetheless, great care must be exercised whendrawing conclusions from the fact that Rashi does not appear to utilize Hekhalotmaterial in a particular context, as the following analysis serves to illustrate.In a brief article entitled \"Rashi and the Merkavah,\" Joseph Dan presentstwo examples which suggest to him, at least tentatively, that Rashi \"either didnot have, or chose not to use, Hekhalot traditions,\" and that he \"did notintegrate Hekhalot material into his literary structure.\"43 The second exampleadduced by Dan emerges from Rashi's commentary to Ezekiel. Rashi declines todiscuss the esoteric meaning of the term hashmal in his commentary to Ezekiel,explanation is the same one referred to in both Hekhalot and Pietist materials; see above,ch. 1, nn. 58-60.] It was suggested early on that the commentary on Chroniclesattributed to Rashi was not written by him, because it contains torat ha-sod material andpietistic concepts and techniques not usually found in Rashi. Indeed, Y. N. Epsteinargued (REJ 58 [1909]: 189-99) that it was authored by R. Samuel he-Hasid.The dates for the coming of the Messiah found in Rashi's commentary to Daniel8:14, (1352) and to Sanhedrin 97b (1478) were primarily the result of exegeticalconsiderations (see Gershon Cohen, \"Messianic Postures of Ashkenazim andSephardim,\" Studies of the Leo Baeck Institute, ed.

There is nothing in Rashi'sinterpretations to suggest an awareness of Hekhalot texts or ideas. Moreover,Dan maintains that Rashi's refusal to disclose the so-called esotericinterpretation, which was predicated on one version of a talmudic dictum,does not prove that he was actually aware of Hekhalot material. Rather, Rashi'sconcern may have been a theological or anthropomorphic one, having to dowith the danger of interpreting bftiun as relating to the figure of God. DespiteDan's best efforts, however, this example as an indication that Rashi did not useor have Hekhalot material remains an argument from silence.Dan's first example comes from Rashi's commentary to Hagigah 14b. Asomewhat mysterious formulation attributed to R. Aqiva, which was linked tohis entrance and that of his colleagues into Pardes, states that \"when you arriveat stones of pure marble, do not say 'water, water.'\" The Talmud does notexplain this prohibition. Only in Hekhalot texts of the Merkavah tradition do wefind that the mistaking of marble for water is an indication that the mystic hasfailed a test and may not enter into the sixth palace.According to Dan, Rashi's comment, ^ \"pK -|*o ttn D^ wn, takentogether with the prior portion of the talmudic passage, nnKn ^K, \"do not say,\"is diametrically opposed to the Hekhalot approach. In Dan's view, Rashi'sinterpretation of R. Aqiva's warning is that one who sees water should not say,in defeat, that it cannot be crossed (literally, how can we go on?)—that hisquest has ended. R. Aqiva is offering encouragement rather than a sternwarning. The mystic should not hesitate, because these waters are an imaginaryobstacle. Rather, he should proceed further in his quest, against the guidelinesin the Hekhalot literature.David Halperin, in his study of early Jewish responses to the vision ofEzekiel that appeared several years before Dan's article, understands thecomment of Rashi very differently. He considers it evidence of Rashi'sawareness of Hekhalot material. In Halperin's view, Rashi's comment, D^E •''tt^71 -pK l*o ur», is a paraphrase of R. Aqiva's warning: \"There is water, waterhere; how can we go further?\" According to Rashi, and parallel to the Hekhalotmaterial, the sight of water does stop the mystic from proceeding further.Indeed, Halperin suggests that Rashi is intimating that the mystic in this casemay feel like the children of Israel at the Red Sea, who found their way blockedby water and could not proceed.Moreover, Rashi glosses the phrase \"pure marble\" (when you arrive atstones of pure marble) with the words \"p^y D\">ttD j?TQ)3 (shining like clearwater). Halperin notes that the word rvb^ appears in a related Hekhalot textin conjunction with the marble stones, and he suggests that Rashi perhaps150"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Mysticism and Magicderived his interpretation of \"pure marble\" from a Hekhalot source. In short,not only is Rashi's interpretation of this passage fully consonant with Hekhalotliterature, it may well have been drawn from it.44In both his biblical and talmudic commentaries,45 Rashi was influencedby the mystical midrash Otiyyot de-R.

In one instance in his talmudiccommentary to Hullin, which is parallel to a passage in his commentary toEzekiel, he interprets that demut or parzuf Yacaqov represents the male aspectwithin the Godhead.46 As Elliot Wolfson has demonstrated, this mysticalformulation was espoused later by both R.

At the same time, Rashi'sawareness of the various sod dimensions that were studied in pre-CrusadeMainz should not be overstated.

This dating schema supportsMarcus's thesis that the reaffirmation of this ceremony was a significant step in a largereffort by the German Pietists and German Jews more generally to preserve earlierAshkenazic culture—which was more custom-oriented and contained magicalcomponents—in the face of tosafist dialectical incursions that were causing thesecultural aspects to fade. The ceremony was found initially in the work of a GermanPietist, who claimed it was a venerable custom, while its first appearance in a northernFrench text (where it may not have been actually observed) was only later.

As such, the Mahzor Vitry version of theceremony is not necessarily any later than the one found in Sefer Roqeah. In addition,Marcus's suggestion (32, 114) that the ceremony was perhaps not in vogue in northernFrance has not been amply demonstrated.Nonetheless, it is possible to preserve the overall thrust of Marcus's theory in lightof the present study.

Jacob b. Samson, a student of Rashi. The disposition of pre-Crusadewas not simply a case of German Pietists or German Jews versus tosafists. As we shallsee, a number of northern French tosafists also wished to retain these aspects of earlyAshkenazic rabbinic culture. Indeed, as we have already seen, Mahzor Vitry containsother magical practices and elements as well, even if its version of the initiationceremony is not identical to the one found in Sefer Roqeah. Thus, the presence of thisceremony in both Germany and northern France, although not universally held, testifiesto the relative strength of the more traditional position in Ashkenazic rabbinic circlesgenerally, despite the advance of the tosafist innovations and changes that Marcusdescribes.

Hezekiah writes that one bows before a Torah scroll not because ofany inherent Godliness in the Torah itself, but rather because the Shekhinahdwells within the Holy Ark. A mystical tradition embraced and expanded uponby the German Pietists identified the Torah with the Divine glory, the Kavod.The Torah scroll is described as the Divine footstool. According to thistradition, one bows to the Torah because it is in fact a manifestation of theDivine. In their formulation, Hezekiah and Raban wished to offset this view75Hamburg 153. According to ms. Hamburg (cited by Urbach and reproduced byHallamish, 214), Raban held that the word barukh was meant to appear thirteen times inthe Barukh she-^amar prayer. (Interestingly, while R. Eleazar of Worms agreed with thisnumber, his reasons are different and tend to be more theologically based than thoseoffered by Raban, which are completely exoteric.) But Hallamish notes that on p. 21 ofHershler's siddur, the number given is ten; this casts some doubt on Grossman'sidentification. What Hallamish failed to notice, however, is that this material comesfrom a section of the siddur manuscript labeled by Hershler (on p. 19) as siddur HasideiAshkenaz (based, for the most part, on ms. Munich 393), not from the body of the largersiddur published by Hershler. [The number ten is primarily the view of kabbalists,including R. Judah b.

Nathan's French origins—see my \"Rabbinic Figures inCastilian Kabbalistic Pseudepigraphy,\" Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy 3(1993):97, n. 73. R.

AsWolfson notes, R. Eleazar of Worms cites this formulation in the body of his halakhicwork, Sejer Roqeah, despite the fact that both he and R. Judah he-Hasid espoused themore mystical view in esoteric and pietistic texts. See also Sejer Raban, massekhetBerakhot, sec. 127. R. HananDel interpreted the talmudic passage (Berakhot 6a) that theAlmighty dons tejillin to mean not that God has a visible body which can be seen, butthat certain human beings may perceive Him through re^iyat ha-lev—loosely translatedas imagination. Cf. Wolfson, Through a Speculum That Shines, 147-48; Sejer Gematr?otle-R. Yehudah he-Hasid, introduction, 10-11; and below, ch. 4, n. 2. Thus when theTorah states that Moses saw God's back, it refers to this process of reHyat ha-lev.Similarly, when R. Yishmael Kohen Gadol in the Holy of Holies saw AkatrPel seated calkisse ram ve-nissa (Berakhot 7a), it was through the powers of reHyat ha-lev. WhenR. Isaac b. Moses Or ZaruaQ, a student of Hasidei Ashkenaz, cites R. Hanan3el (Sejer OrZaruac, hilkhot qerv'at shema, sees. 7-8), he adds that R. HananDel, in offering theinterpretation involving reDiyat ha-lev, supports the interpretation that AkatrPel was notmerely an angel but a manifestation of the Divine Kavod (which could not be physicallyseen by man), a notion associated with Hasidei Ashkenaz. This is also included byR. Judah b. Qalonymus of Spires, an associate of R.

He initially permitted wine that had come intocontact with a particular utensil that had been used for libation wine (yaynnesekh). After issuing this ruling, Raban went to sleep and dreamed that histeacher (and father-in-law) was reading a verse that Raban then interpreted, inthe dream, as referring to those who drink yayn nesekh and eat pork. WhenRaban awoke, he understood from this dream that he had incorrectly permittedthe wine. Raban then reviewed a key factor in his lenient ruling and discovered,after a time, that his main assumption had been incorrect. At that point, bothhe and those who drank the wine, at his instruction, fasted for two days.77Two related experiences help to put Raban's dream in perspective.R. Ephraim of Regensburg, a contemporary of Raban, ate a fish called barbuta,believing it to be from a kosher species. That night an elderly man with flowinghair and a lengthy beard appeared to him in a dream with a plate full of insects(sherazinn), bidding R. Ephraim to eat them. When R. Ephraim protested, theold man suggested that these sherazim \"are as permitted as those that you atetoday.\" When R.

Joel ha-Levi, a grandson of Raban, was burned to death as amartyr in 1216. R. Mordekhai b. Eliezer composed a selihah to commemorateR. Uri. A manuscript that records the selihah indicates that R. Uri himself wasits author. He transmitted the text of the selihah to R. Mordekhai in a dream,along with the liturgical tune (nigguri) to which it should be chanted.80 Thenature of the communication during this dream, which is reminiscent of adream that R. Simeon ha-Gadol had,81 further suggests that Raban's dream wasnot primarily a mystical experience. Although Raban's dream testifies to hisdeep spirituality, it entails neither magical techniques nor mystical perspec-tives.82Har-Shoshanim, vol. 2 [Jerusalem, 1977], 293, n. 135), it was R. Judah he-Hasid whoinitially recounted the dream of R. Ephraim of Regensburg, suggesting somerelationship between R. Ephraim and Hasidei Ashkenaz. Cf. Urbach, Bcfalei ha-Tosafot,1:204; and Tamar Alexander, \"Rabbi Judah the Pious as a Legendary Figure,\" Mysticism,Magic and Kabbalah in Ashkenazi Hasidism, 135-36. Similar regimens of tiqqunei teshuvahfor a penitent murderer were prescribed by R. Judah he-Hasid and R. Ephraim ofRegensburg. See ms. Parma 1237, fol. 36v. See also above, ch. 2, n. 40. In discusssingthe reliability of dreams in halakhic contexts, R. Samuel, the son of R. Ezekiel Landau,raises the issue of verification; see Noda Bi-Yehudah, Yoreh Decah (mahadura tiny ana),#30. In R. Samuel's view, R. Ephraim's piety caused him to prohibit the barbuta becauseof his dream, despite the fact that Rabbenu Tarn and other tosafists (who were notgranted a dream by the \"bacal ha-halom\") permitted this fish because they believed it hadscales.

In the early part of theMiddle Ages, magic was considered a practical science or skill. From themid-eleventh century through the mid-thirteenth century, however, magic wasdenigrated generally, and associated with heretics and Jews. Secret knowledgewas feared, and penances were prescribed for those who resorted to the use ofmagic.83 But these penances were directed only at those who invoked demonsor prescribed charms and amulets. According to John of Salisbury (d.1180)and other contemporary masters, the manipulation of demonic powers (blackmagic) was to be eschewed. Other magical arts, such as divination—whichrelied on natural objects or the initiation of quasi-prophetic or dream-likestates—were still considered acceptable.84 In Christian Europe also, the twelfthcentury witnessed a move away from the supernatural and toward the rational,which further limited the role that magic could play85IVRabbenu Tarn, the greatest of the early tosafists, has been characterized asa rationalist.86 Like Rashbam, Rabbenu Tarn interpreted talmudic passages inways that eliminated the roles of superstition and shedim, which had been left83See Edward Peters, The Magician, the Witch and the Law (Philadelphia, 1978), 47,56, 66-67, 70-80, 160-61.84Benedicta Ward, Miracles and the Medieval Mind (Philadelphia, 19892), 10-13;Valerie Flint, The Rise of Magic in Early Medieval Europe (Princeton, 1991), 6-7, 29-35,66-68, 87-92, 146-57; and Lynn Thorndike, A History of Magic and ExperimentalScience, 2:7-8 (Peter Abelard), 13-15 (Hugh of St. Victor), 137-54 (Hildegard ofBingen), 155-70 (John of Salisbury), 341-60 (William of Auvergne).85See, e.g., Peter Brown, \"Society and the Supernatural: A Medieval Change,\"Daedalus 104 (1975): 133-51; John Baldwin, \"The Intellectual Preparation for theCanon of 1215 Against Ordeals,\" Speculum 36 (1961):611-36; C.

As we have noted, however, there were extant Ashkenazic traditionsabout Divine Names (and mystical speculation) that Rashbam had mentioned.Moreover, this particular tradition (which had apparently not yet reachedAshkenaz by Rashi's day, but was later expanded upon by both R. Eleazar ofWorms and the Zohar) was also cited in the name of R. Hai Gaon.89 In two ofthe places where sod or magic is involved, Rabbenu Tarn cites the material ashaving been transmitted by his father, R. Meir, in the name of Hakhmei/GeoneiLothaire of the pre-Crusade period. Rabbenu Tarn makes no attempt to explainor analyse these instances; he simply accepts them as earlier traditions orperceptions to be upheld as a matter of custom or respect.In the first instance, Rabbenu Tarn endorses the notion that one shouldnot eat after sunset on the Sabbath because of the danger from shedim/mazicpmthat had befallen those who did. As we shall see, this was not merely an issue ofpopular belief or superstition; it was related to mystical concepts.90 RabbenuTarn also reported an earlier tradition, in the context of a statement on theimportance of reciting piyyutim, which described how R. Eleazar ha-Qallirappeared when he composed piyyut(im) that referred to the angels whosurrounded the kisse or merkavah. According to this tradition, a fire lit upand burned around him (T^nt) U7K numb). It was in this context as wellBe-Orah Madda [Sefer Yovel le-Aharon Mirsky], ed.

Accordingto Rabbenu Tarn, \"the Holy One blessed be He is Himself called Metatron.\"92Some Pietist authors similarly identified Metatron with Shekhinah, the DivinePresence. Although R. Moses b. Eleazar ha-Darshan, a grandson of R. Judahhe-Hasid, was against identifying the angelic Metatron with the DivinePresence, he allowed the name Metatron to be attributed to Shekhinah. \"This[identification] is not a mistake. This is another secret that is explained in thename of Rabbenu Tarn (sod she-meforash be-shem Rabbenu Tarn).\"93Although R. Moses viewed this formulation of Rabbenu Tarn as a sod, it isfar from certain that Rabbenu Tarn did. The last part of R. Moses b. Eleazar'sstatement may mean that this identification was a secret from the perspective ofsomeone familiar with sod, which Rabbenu Tarn expressed openly orunwittingly. Indeed, it was suggested by Rabbenu Tarn to solve a problem ofexoteric scriptural exegesis. Following an older rabbinic view, Rashi identifiedthe angel in Exodus 23:20—sent by God to \"guard the way\" of the Jewishpeople following the sin of the golden calf—as Metatron. Rashi arrived at thisinterpretation by means of a gematria approach. Some had questioned thisconclusion, since the gematria that Rashi used could be wielded differently91See above, n. 9, and cf.

Indeed, a Tosafot passage cites R.

Moreover, in this instance as well, R. Tarn offered hisresolution regarding the names of Metatron with a passage from the MidrashPesiqta.9* Rabbenu Tarn was interested in clarifying the role of Metatron (andother heavenly figures) on the basis of rabbinic (rather than esoteric) texts. Oneof the positions he formulated in this endeavor may have been helpful tobacalei sod, but it cannot be demonstrated from this instance that he was a bacalsod himself.Caution must also be exercised with regard to several other passages thatmention Rabbenu Tarn's name in connection with esoteric phenomena andtechniques.

The influence of Worms, where mysticalteachings were not in evidence, was dominant at the beginning of the tosafistperiod.122Bodl. 2274, fol. 28; and cf. ms. Bodl. 781, fols. 91-95. Two other texts that make thisassociation (cited by Heschel in nn. 42, 44), Sejer Yosef Omez and Shalsheletha-Qabbalah, are significantly later works, and the distortions in both cases in regardto Rabbenu Tarn have already been noted (above, nn. 98, 102). The reference in Sejerha-Yashar to Rabbenu Tarn as a navi has been shown to have an exoteric connotation;see Shraga Abramson, \"Navi, Ro^eh ve-Hozeh,\" Sejer Yovel Muggash li-Khevod ha-RavMordekhai Kirschblum, ed.

Even Raban, whostudied in Mainz before the First Crusade, makes almost no reference topre-Crusade rabbinic material from there, probably because of the disruptiveimpact of the First Crusade.123 Israel Ta-Shma has argued that there was aconscious effort by twelfth-century tosafists (especially in northern France) toconstrict their libraries, at least with respect to earlier halakhic writings, inorder to focus without distraction on their independent approach to talmudicinterpretation. For this reason, the rabbinic literature of eleventh-centuryAshkenaz was largely ignored by the early tosafists.124 Whether by design or bycircumstance, these tosafists did not embrace the mystical, magical, andpietistic teachings and practices that had been prevalent in pre-CrusadeMainz.125Although the dialectical method and approach to talmudic interpretationpioneered by Rabbenu Tarn and his contemporaries dominated Ashkenazthrough the end of the thirteenth century, there is much evidence to suggestthat not all tosafists shared their attitude toward the disciplines of mysticismand magic, which had been a scholarly endeavor in the pre-Crusade period, aswe have noted. Indeed, we shall see that several students of Rabbenu Tarn—including Ri, R. Eleazar of Metz, and Ribam, among others—were involved inaspects of mystical studies and practices. All this activity stands in addition tothe presence of related material that has been noted in sifrut de-Vei Rashi, and inprayer texts and interpretations from the late twelfth century and beyond.Once again, the question should be raised as to whether the GermanPietists, who were coming into their own at this very point in time, wereparticularly influential in disseminating mystical and magical materials innorthern France (and Germany), or whether there was a broader stream withinrabbinic culture throughout medieval Ashkenaz that valued these disciplines—just as there was a stratum represented by Rashbam and Raban that apparentlya payyetan—(all of which calls to mind R. Simeon ha-Gadol) was R. Meir b. Isaac ]Tn(Shaliah Zibbur).

Eliezer iscited by his student, R. Eleazar of Worms, as ruling that it is appropriate tostand during the recitation of the first portion of QerVat Shema. This ruling,which has pietistic overtones, is based on (a passage in) Hekhalot literature. Allsubsequent proponents of this view in Europe during the thirteenth centurywere either German Pietists or among those associated with hasidut Ashkenaz17R. Eliezer of Metz cautioned against a person saying, even in jest, thatGod had told him something directly. This warning may be indicative ofR. Eliezer's familiarity with quasi-prophetic experiences—of the kindexperienced by Ri's student, R. Ezra ha-Navi of Moncontour, and others—that will be discussed more fully below.18 On the other hand, R. Eliezerpermitted the binding of a dying individual by oath to return after his death, totell or answer whatever he is asked (ha-mashbicf Det ha-holeh lashuv le-^aharmitah le-hagid lo ^asher yistfal 16). In R. Eliezer's view, this is not a violation ofthe prohibition against communicating with the dead (doresh 3et ha-metim),since the request was made to the individual while he was still alive.

Eliezer writes that he does notknow the origin of this custom, but he asserts that it was practiced be-qabbalah.He also heard that it was based on a midrashic interpretation of the biblicalphrase, meziz min ha-harakkim.

Jacob's full comment appears in ms. Paris 167 among a collection of tosafistinterpretations, especially those of Rabbenu Tam, that were grouped under the headingPerush ha-Torah me^et Shelomoh ha-Kohen b. Ycfaqov ha-Kohen. The manuscript wascopied in Byzantium in 1443. In the version in ms. Bodl. 1206 (see above, n. 23),R. Aaron also notes that there was a controversy between his uncle R. Jacob, ha-qadoshmi-Corbeil, and Rabbenu Jacob [Tam] of Ramerupt. His uncle adduced proofs that theShema recited at bedtime (after nightfall) was more important, while Rabbenu Tamargued that the Shema recited during the evening prayer in the synagogue (aftersundown) was more crucial. Cf. Ta-Shma, Minhag Ashkenaz ha-Qadmon, 319, n. 17, andGrossman, above, n. 23. As Urbach notes (BaQalei ha-Tosafot, 1:151, n. 48), thiscontroversy involved many more Ashkenazic (and Sefardic) rabbinic figures than thetwo R. Jacobs. Urbach indicates, however, that the only other known reference to theposition of R. Jacob of Corbeil in this matter is found at the beginning of Sefer OrZarua3, Hilkhot Qerfat Shema (sec. 1), in which R. Jacob is quoted as responding to oneof Rabbenu Tarn's questions against the position of Rashi (who held that the later Shemawas the more important). Ms. Paris 167 (fols. 92r-93v) records a lengthy version of theargument between Rabbenu Tam and R. Jacob of Corbeil, while commenting on thebiblical locus of Shema in the portion of Va-Ethanan. In this fuller version of R. Jacob ofCorbeil's position, he suggests answers to all four of the questions Rabbenu Tam hadposed against Rashi's position (as recorded in the Or Zaruac, the position with whichR. Jacob of Corbeil concurred). The essential element of R. Jacob of Corbeil's resolutionof the conflicting talmudic sources was that a scholar who recited the Shema at thepreferred time (after nightfall) did not have to recite it again at his bedside upon retiring,but others (nonscholars) who had read the Shema earlier must recite it fully (i.e., not justthe first paragraph) at their bedsides. In this regard, R. Jacob was advocating the earlierAshkenazic position, which was also held by Sefer Hasidim. Cf. Jacob Katz, \"Macarivbi-Zemanno u-Shelo bi-Zemanno,\" lion 35 (1972):39-48, and my Jewish Education andSociety, 86-99.27See DaQat Zeqenim to Deuteronomy 12:21; the so-called Perush ha-Roqeah calha-Torah, ed.

Jacob's comment andthe material found in Perush Roqeah blunts Aptowitzer's claim that the gematriainterpretation(s) in the style of Hasidei Ashkenaz offered by R. Jacob do not link himdirectly to the teachings of the German Pietists.

See below, and see also S. Emanuel, \"Ha-Polmos calNosah ha-Tefillah shel Hasidei Ashkenaz,\" Mehqerei Talmud 3 (in press), n. 25.] Prior tomaking his emendation, Urbach pointed out that Ribam was purely a talmudist whowas uninvolved in sod, except in this instance. (Note also that in Bacalei ha-Tosajot,1:389, Urbach does not list Ribam among R. Eleazar of Worms's teachers. In the firstedition of that work [1955], Urbach notes Ribam's lack of involvement in torat ha-sodbut suggests no emendation of the text.)In ms. Moscow-Guenzberg 614 (fol. 21r) the question is asked by R. Judah of\"R. Mordekhai.\" Aptowitzer, Mavo la-Rabiah, 317, n. 5a, suggests that this readingshould be corrected on the basis of Paris 772. Israel Ta-Shma, on the other hand, arguesthat this is the correct reading. See his \"Le-Toledot ha-Yehudim be-Polin ba-Me^otha-Yod Bet/ha-Yod Gimmel,\" Zion 53, (1988): 363-64. Ta-Shma points out thatalthough Ribam was from Regensburg—which was also R. Judah he-Hasid's residenceduring the latter part of his life, thus affording ample opportunity for contact betweenthe two scholars—Ribam was much older than R. Judah. Because of this age difference,it is hard to imagine that R. Eleazar of Worms was Ribam's student. At the same time,there is a R. Mordekhai of Poland who was connected with R. Judah's circle inRegensburg (see Perushei ha-Torah le-R. Yehudah he-Hasid, 94); there is also an201"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4mystical teachings to be found among other students of Rabbenu Tam, Ribam'spietistic and meta-halakhic tendencies with respect to fasting on Roshha-Shanah further support the fact that he was the source of the informationrather than the questioner.30unidentified R. Mordekhai whose name appears in a sod context in a text of the Hugha-Keruv ha-Meyuhad. (See the so-called perush le-Sefer Yezirah meyuhas le-R. ScfadyahGaon in ms. B. M. 754, fol. 124r). It is perhaps this R. Mordekhai (assuming that boththese references are to the same person) of whom R. Judah asked his question.In response to Ta-Shma's suggestion, several points should be made. First,R. Eleazar of Worms's reference to Ribam as his teacher may be purely honorific, as isthe case in countless instances involving tosafists and other rishonim. Indeed, there isalso no evidence that R. Eleazar was a student of \"R. Mordekhai.\" R. Judah he-Hasid'srelative youth lends credence to the fact that he was asking the question and not thereverse, as Urbach suggests (although there is at least one other example from Ashkenazof a teacher or senior scholar asking a student, or less venerable figure, a questionconcerning sod; see ms. B. M. 752, fol. 78r: \"IT^K >m\\ Tra^n nK TKtt Tn p\"^ tnm bx,\\pnwjn '[yfyanb tzn \"fr i\"wn .ninn yyiKni pxii n^u/n ioi>tar6 xtn ^KTI Kn^a-aa\"ID nnriK paw rptwa paw \\n \"6KI rvrTau). Moreover, the solutions proposed by bothUrbach and Ta-Shma were offered primarily because they had no other evidence linkingRibam to mystical teachings. Since we can now see that there was significant interest inthis area among R. Tarn's French students, not to mention his German ones, Ribam'sassociation with this question is appropriate, especially in light of Ribam's own pietisticproclivities that bring him even closer to R. Judah he-Hasid. See the next note, and cf.Rami Reiner, \"Rabbenu Tam: Rabbotav (Ha-Zarefatim) ve-Talmidav Benei Ashkenaz,\"(M.A. thesis, Hebrew University, 1997), 81.30See above, ch. 2, nn. 38-40. Cf. She^elot u-Teshuvot min ha-Shamayim, #86.R. Judah he-Hasid did, of course, respond to pietistic and mystical questions. See, e.g.,Ivan Marcus, \"Hibburei ha-Teshuvah shel Hasidei Ashkenaz,\" Studies in Jewish Mysticism,Philosophy and Ethical Literature Presented to R. Isaiah Tishby, ed.

Moses ofBurgos) is pseudepigraphic; see Urbach, Bacalei ha-Tosafot, 1:222. Ri ha-Lavan was not acontemporary of the other two; see Gershom Scholem in Tarbiz 3 (1924):276-77.Nonetheless, A. M. Habermann, in Yedicot ha-Makhon le-Heqer ha-Shirah ha-clvrit 3(1937):94, n. 3, suggested that the inclusion is accurate, based on the fact that R. Isaacreceived \"mnan \"[a D^ayu nyp from R. Judah b. Qalonymus, father of R. Eleazar ofWorms, who was knowledgeable in sod teachings. See ms. Bodl. 970, fols. 126r-132r,and see also Neubauer's Catalogue, 209. In light of the actual involvement of a numberof Rabbenu Tarn's students in sod, the co-opting of Ri ha-Lavan is readily understood,even if his own involvement in this area is doubtful; see my \"Rabbinic Figures inCastilian Kabbalistic Pseudepigraphy\" passim, for Spanish distortions of Ashkenazicfigures.202"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Between Tosafists and German PietistsR.

Judah b.Yaqar. See Israel Ta-Shma, \"E-l Melekh NeDeman—Gilgulo shel Minhag,\" 288-89, n. 7.R. Judah b.

Yaqar in hishalakhic writings, never actually mentions R. Judah with regard to any kabbalisticdoctrines. Nonetheless, it is clear that Nahmanides was influenced by R.

TheGerman Pietists invested commonly held beliefs in demonic and other forceswith theological meaning.

Against the view of Gad Freudenthal, thatAshkenazic Jewry was completely opposed to the study of philosophy and science,David Ruderman notes that Hasidei Ashkenaz were aware of some of the philosophicaltrends of their day and were even more strongly aware of certain scientific and naturalphenomena, despite the absence of a sustained philosophical tradition. This interest,however, was not directed toward a rationalistic investigation of science or nature per se.Rather, it was designed to marshal empirical evidence for compelling or unusual naturalphenomena in order to support a theological point concerning the powers of theAlmighty (zekher zasah le-nifle^otav). Magic as well was viewed as a function ofgodliness. There was no involvement in the study of science in Ashkenaz until the lateMiddle Ages, following significant exposure to philosophy.

It may mean that after studying the point of controversy, he wasable to reach a firm and unimpeachable conclusion.60 This possibility isstrengthened when the decisor claims that the guidance came from Elijah,whose role in deciding unsolved controversies of Jewish law is commonplacein rabbinic thought.Moreover, Rabiah presented both sides of the controversy in his SeferRabiah, along with the names of various important scholars who supportedeach position, without reaching an unequivocal decision himself. His studentsand successors in Germany, however, decided ultimately in favor of thestringent view. Rabiah also did not state in his own work that Elijah aided him.At the same time, R.

The relative absence of this material in Tosafot texts may be, however, asmuch an issue of genre as an indication of lack of involvement. Indeed,Nahmanides' talmudic commentaries are almost completely devoid ofreferences to esoteric or kabbalistic material, despite Nahmanides' obviouscommitment to the study of torat ha-sod. We should expect that tosafists whowere interested in sod and magic, no less than Nahmanides, would wish toseparate these disciplines from their talmudic commentaries and halakhicanalyses.65The material presented in this chapter suggests that interest in magic andmysticism that can be detected among a number of tosafists and rabbinicscholars in northern France and Germany during the second half of the twelfthcentury and into the first part of the thirteenth century may have developedindependently of the German Pietists. As we have seen, the Pietists expressed areticence in connection with the magical use of Shemot (despite their obviousfamiliarity with the magical techniques and their willingness to employ themunder certain circumstances) that contemporary tosafists did not express.66Several considerations, not shared by tosafists, may have motivated thePietists. As we have noted, the Pietists were highly aware of the theoreticalunderpinnings and practical manifestations of demonology and magiccommonly available in the world around them. They sought to utilize thesedisciplines as a means of achieving a deeper understanding of the Creator, who,they believed, operates not only within natural spheres, but in supernaturalways as well.

Eleazar ofWorms, Sefer ha-Shem—in which R. Eleazar interprets the Name in accordancewith torat ha-sod and describes the functions and implications of the Name inboth the higher and lower worlds—contains a ceremony in which the Name ispassed to adepts. Formal transmission of the Name was not intended so thatadepts could make use of it for magical purposes, but so they could receive thetheosophical secrets connected with it,71 or the mystical practices andrevelatory experiences related to its pronunciation.72 Because tosafists wereinvolved neither in the study of philosophy nor in the study of theosophy, theissues that confronted Hasidei Ashhenaz regarding magic and demonology neednot have troubled them.When we look at the thirteenth century, we shall see that the influence ofGerman Pietists appears to grow in matters of magic and sod, as has beendemonstrated with regard to asceticism and perishut.

Simhah of Spires (whose own affinities with hasidut Ashkenaz will bereviewed below)—that one cannot receive a more important blessing than yir^atshamayim—and another formulation on ^ahavat ha-Shem that is quite similar to apassage in an introductory section (Hilkhot Hasidut—Shoresh Ahavat ha-Shem) of SeferRoqeah (see Urbach, Bacalei ha-Tosafot, 1:420, n. 56). A biblical interpretation of R. Judahhe-Hasid is cited by R. Isaac in sec. 25. It should also be noted that the first halakhictopic that Sefer Or Zaruac addresses is hilkhot zedaqah, which contains a number ofpietistic themes (although doctrines of zedaqah unique to Sefer Hasidim are notnecessarily espoused; see, e.g., Haym Soloveitchik, \"Three Themes,\" 344, n. 104).Indeed, the entire Alfa Beta treatise is a kind of hilkhot hasidut introduction, similar in anumber of respects to the beginning sections of Sefer Roqeah (which took its cue fromRambam's Mishneh Torah; see, e.g., Dan, Torat ha-Sod shel Hasidut Ashkenaz, and IvanMarcus, Piety and Society [Leiden, 1981], 131-32); and cf. above, ch. 2, nn. 40, 83, 86.Note the Sefer Hasidim-likt critique of unbridled dialectic in sec. 23.

These were often popular stories, preserved intheir original form in order to make particular points of theology.nSee Dan, Torat ha-Sod shel Hasidut Ashkenaz, 186-88.

R. Meir was also not concerned that when children ate the cakes on the festival(ShavuQot, when the ceremony normally took place), they would be liable for erasing theletters written on the cakes when they ate them. At the same time, R. Meir asserted thatthe writing on the cakes given to the children for petihat ha-lev should not includeDivine Names (as was apparently the practice) but only angelic ones. See Marcus, Ritualsof Childhood, 115-16. R. Meir's concern was not, however, a legalistic one designed tocurtail or undercut the ceremony per se. As we have seen (above, n. 46), Maharamhimself fully understood and supported the religio-magical conception of petihat ha-lev.Rather, R. Meir's concern was similar to the one expressed by R. Judah he-Hasid (Marcus,114, with which R. Eleazar of Worms disagreed)—that biblical verses should not bewritten on the cakes (or that the cakes should not be given to the children to eat)because it was improper to excrete these verses. R. Meir was concerned about theimproper treatment of Shemot themselves, while R. Judah extended this concern to thebiblical verses in general (which contained and also represented Shemot in Ashkenazicthought; see above, n. 30). Both R. Meir and R.

He displayed a clear familiarity with the toratha-Kavod of hasidut Ashkenaz and with a form of the doctrine of the ether(referred to by R. Solomon as ^avir mujla barukh Hu u-varkukh Shemo) that wasakin to the ^avir recognized by the German Pietists. R.

As the conclusion of the passage indicates, it comes from Sefer Malmadha-Talmidim (Lyck, 1866, fol. 68a), by the Provengal rationalist R. Jacob Anatoli (wholater settled in Italy). Cf. Trachtenberg, Jewish Magic and Superstition, 243, 311, n. 23,who was unaware of R.

Barry Walfish(Haifa, 1993), 2:236, 238, n. 10, and 241, n. 34. In this passage, R. Jacob also decriesthe role of angels as mediators between man and God during prayer (and he specificallyrejects the liturgical phrase that refers to angels as makhnisei rahamim), as did R. Meir ofNarbonne and R. Isaac b. Yedayah in Provence. See Saperstein, 191-93. A number ofAshkenazic rabbinic scholars we have encountered approved of the notion of angels asmediators.

In addition, R.

Solomon, the Almighty gave man the ability to controlshedim through the aegis of two fallen angels (Shemhaza^el and Azza)53 andalso by invoking Divine Names that were known to some. Indeed, the correctrecitation of a sequence of Shemot has the capacity to bring the Messiah. At thesame time, however, use of these powers might cause men to lose sight of theirDivine origins and experience a diminution of yir^at shamayim. Moreover, thepower of Divine Names over demons is effective even when activatedbe-tum^ah, by sorcerers or those who err in their ways, because all is derivedfrom the Almighty and from the power of His six names.

Moreover,many of the tosafists who expressed interest in these disciplines also exhibiteda tendency toward perishut and pietism. While the talmudic methodologies ofRabbenu Tarn and Raban dominated the entire period, their downplaying ofother pre-Crusade disciplines, such as torat ha-sod, was not fully accepted.Indeed, later tosafists expanded their sod interests, perhaps under the influenceof the German Pietists. Although the Pietists also developed a uniquetheosophical system in which tosafists were not involved, the common level ofmystical and magical discourse among Ashkenazic talmudists was significantlyhigher than has heretofore been thought.137), Balaq (376-77), Ki-Tavo (432) and Va-Yelekh (437-38); cf. above, n. 67; ch. 4, n.37; Perush R.

Although thebcfalei ha-Tosafot were known primarily for their achievements and advance-ments in the realm of talmudic studies, many of them were familiar with boththe techniques and the theories of these other disciplines as well.We have seen that considerations of perishut and hasidut did have animpact, at times, on the talmudic interpretations and legal rulings of thesetosafists. Additional examples can undoubtedly be discovered through furtherresearch. Mystical and magical dimensions remain, however, mostly behind thescenes. They do not occupy a prominent place in tosafist writings, althoughthey become more easily recognizable by the middle of the thirteenth century.Given the esoteric nature of these disciplines, however, this pattern ofdevelopment is not unexpected. Indeed, the firm correlation that has beendocumented—between those tosafists who displayed ascetic tendencies andthose who were most familiar with esoteric teachings—is a reflection of themore general characteristics of torat ha-sod and its adherents as well.This revision of the dominant perception of tosafist spiritualityconstitutes a significant shift in the perceived balance of intellectual proclivitiesdisplayed by medieval rabbinic figures.

Isaac of Dampierre, R. Eliezer of Metz, R. Jacoband R. Isaac of Corbeil, R. Isaac and R. Avigdor of Vienna, R. Zedekiah Anav,and R. Meir of Rothenburg, among others—on the mysticism/asceticism sideof the ledger. Further research must be undertaken to ascertain whether theanti-philosophical (anti-Maimonidean) approach taken by a number of tosafistsand other Ashkenazic rabbinic figures during various phases of theMaimonidean controversy, which was linked also to a literal reading ofaggadic literature, resulted at least partially from mystical leanings—in additionto the lack of philosophical awareness and training in medieval Ashkenaz.3To be sure, no tosafists can be classified as kabbalists, since none of themformulated anything that could be construed or labeled as Kabbalah.Nonetheless, we have seen that tosafists were involved with a number ofdistinctly mystical and magical dimensions. These include analyses of Divineand angelic names and functions, various kinds of protective or prophylacticadjurations and she^elot halom (that utilized both angelic and Divine Names),2Nahmanides was also quite familiar with philosophical literature and concepts,and he made extensive use of them.

Indeed,the claim that rabbinic culture in the talmudic period, and by extension thewritings of its adherents in the medieval period, were virtually devoid of amythic substrate and of any theurgic or mystical impetus would appear to beseverely undercut by the results of this study. It should be possible, however, todefine more narrowly the parameters of mystical activity within rabbinic circlesand arrive at a more nuanced assessment of the relationship between thesedisciplines or fields.4The involvement of tosafists with mysticism and magic, and withasceticism and perishut, represents the continuation of a pattern establishedduring the pre-Crusade period in Mainz. Indeed, it was the stricttalmudocentric approach, favored by Rabbenu Tarn and other early tosafistsin twelfth-century Germany and northern France, that marks a change withinAshkenaz. While these twelfth-century tosafists may have taken their cue fromthe academy at Worms, their talmudocentricity did not dominate allsubsequent tosafist creativity, even as their dialectical method did. Interest inthe study of Talmud and halakhah alone was not necessarily the rule.Although the tosafists saw themselves as direct successors or later modelsof the Tannaim and Amoraim,5 it is important to consider how mystical andmagical material reached the tosafists (and their predecessors in thepre-Crusade period). Clearly, Hekhalot literature played a major role in thisprocess. Irrespective of the scholarly debate about whether Hekhalot literaturewas produced for and by rabbinic scholars or for less learned individuals who4For a brief overview of these issues and the positions taken by contemporaryscholars, see Elliot Ginsburg, \"The Many Faces of Kabbalah,\" Hebrew Studies 36(1995): 116-20.

Indeed, we have encountered a number of citations ofHekhalot literature in medieval Ashkenazic rabbinic texts, including passagesfrom a little-known work entitled Mazaseh Merkavah. Hekhalot texts andpractices were the sources of several widespread liturgical and ritual customs aswell. Hekhalot literature is also replete with magical techniques andincantations that, as we have seen, influenced tosafist formulations bothdirectly and indirectly.7Moreover, there is an ascetic aspect to this literature as well. Asceticpractices are designed primarily to prepare an individual to use Divine andangelic names in various adjurations, after which a number of tosafist formulaeare modeled. Nonetheless, the asceticism favored by the Hekhalot texts mayhave also been a source of the more general tendencies toward pietism andperishut that we have detected in the pre-Crusade and tosafist periods.8Peter Schafer has made a similar argument with regard to HasideiAshkenaz. He suggests that the rise of hasidut Ashkenaz ought not be explainedmainly as a response to twelfth-century stimuli (such as persecution, Christianasceticism, or the rise of tosafist dialectic). There are, in fact, roots in Hekhalotliterature for many of the ascetic and self-effacing behaviors affected by HasideiAshkenaz. Self-perfection, especially through physical restraint, was consideredby Hekhalot writers to be a significant means of achieving a closer relationship6See the summary and analysis in Elliot Wolfson, Through a Speculum That Shines(Princeton, 1994), 74-80, 111-17.

Nonetheless, this tendency among tosafistsas well (which includes not only regular fasting and a diminution in thepleasures of food and drink, but also strictures against gazing at women andtheir clothing, looking into the face of a wicked person, and taking walks forpleasure) may have been inspired, in part, by Hekhalot literature and relatedtexts, such as the Baraita de-Massekhet Niddah.At the same time, the fact that certain tosafists recognized the legitimacyof the full program of tiqqunei teshuvah associated with the German Pietists, theappropriateness of confessing one's sins to a rav (which some Pietistsadvocated), and the value of reciting lengthy and sometimes physicallydemanding confessionals (yidduyim) helps to explain why these aspects of thePietists' program were accepted by a significant number of Ashkenazic rabbinicauthorities in the late Middle Ages and beyond.10 Indeed, the interest displayedin magical and mystical concepts by Ashkenazic talmudists and halakhists inthe late medieval and early modern periods and beyond also needs to bereevaluated in light of the tosafist period—although, to be sure, the number ofnon-Ashkenazic influences grows as the centuries unfold.11 The seriousinterest in these concepts during the tosafist period also helps to explain why9See Peter Schafer, \"The Ideal of Piety and Ashkenazi Hasidim and Its Roots inJewish Tradition,\" Jewish History 4 (1990):9-23.

Indeed, I have wrestledthroughout this work with the question of whether the Pietists were the sourceof a particular phenomenon espoused by certain tosafists, or whether thesetosafists received this material from pre-Crusade Ashkenazic rabbinic cultureor from tosafist predecessors. This question is particularly acute with regard todevelopments in northern France through the first quarter of the thirteenthcentury. For the remainder of the thirteenth century, it is possible to concludethat while northern French rabbinic creativity was dominant with respect totalmudic commentary and study, in the realms of prayer and piyyut and theirinterpretation—including their mystical components—German rabbinicscholars led the way.14To be sure, significant differences between Pietists and tosafists remain.Sefer Hasidim contains passages that frame, at least in theory, an elite pietistmovement or community that wished to separate itself from the mainstream inAshkenaz in order to pursue a life of hasidut to the fullest extent. Thesepassages are in addition to the peculiar forms of necromancy and thesystematic interest in shedim found throughout Sefer Hasidim, the morepronounced pietistic and ascetic tendencies that have been noted (includingthe search for the hidden Divine Will), and the strong concerns expressed withregard to the use of dialectic and contentious talmudic study. With regard totorat ha-sod, only the German Pietists (and their associates, such as the Hugha-Keruv ha-Meyuhad in northern France) were significantly engaged in thestudy of theosophy, developing a system of se/irot-like hypostases and othertheosophical concepts—especially the Kavod—that had an impact onsubsequent developments in Spanish Kabbalah.15 The sustained interest in12See my \"Rabbinic Figures in Castilian Kabbalistic Pseudepigraphy: The Case ofR.

Even the Hebrewparaphrase of R. Sacadayah Gaon's Emunot ve-Decot is cited almost exclusivelyin Pietist texts. The philosophical leanings of the Pietists account, in part, fortheir preference in studying the esoteric properties and characteristics of theDivine Names, rather than adjuring them for personal needs or other moremundane purposes.Recently, there has been much discussion about whether Hehhalot textsand procedures reflect an approach that was fundamentally esoteric orexoteric.17 This issue can also be raised concerning certain geonic and otherearly medieval formulations (such as those of R. Hai and R. HananDel onvisionary experiences).18 Even the mystical study and manipulation of DivineNames within the kabbalistic framework can be divided into theosophical andmore experiential components.19With these kinds of distinctions in mind, it is clear that the tosafistshighlighted in this study were not mystics who approached Judaism from theperspective of esotericism, just as they were not trying to form a separatepietistic movement. They were rabbinic scholars who received, as part of theintellectual culture of medieval Ashkenaz, an awareness of and interest inpietistic and mystical teachings and practices.20 Although some tosafistsignored or downplayed these impulses, others acknowledged and adoptedthem in a moderate or partial way, and still others cultivated them more fullyand developed them further.16Overall, references by tosafists to Pietist conceptions of torat ha-Kavod are fewand far between. At least one of the tosafists who refers to this material, R. Isaac b.Moses Or Zarucf, was part of the Pietists' circle in thirteenth-century Ashkenaz and wasdirectly influenced by them—as were R.
