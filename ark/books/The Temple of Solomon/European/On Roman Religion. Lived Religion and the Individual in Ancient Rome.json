It is regarded, that is, as the religions of political units (usually city-states) that are part and parcel of civic identity. Given the local roots and immobility of such public political religion, the mov-able elements were conceptualized on the patterns of modern religions, but termed “cult” for their organizational deficits and openness to plural-ism. These cults were centered on a deity, whose “essence” (in German, Wesen), “nature,” or “personality” defined the character and function of the cult on a transregional scale. Much of twentieth-century scholarship on ancient religion was invested in locating, identifying, and classifying the evidence for such cults, and there was a clear focus on the supposed dis-tinguishing mark of many “other” religions, that is, the plurality of vener-ated gods. “Idolatry” and, more recently, “polytheism” were terms central to this procedure.1 These cults were seen as being coordinated within a 1.

Within this framework, individual religious competence would be the ability to address the most relevant deity in the most appropriate way, to properly formulate names and epithets.5 Modern historians of religion carefully distinguished between gods and goddesses that were venerated in proper cults and those that were merely the inventions of poets. This may make use of Varro’s distinction between theologia poetarum and theologia civilis,6 but it certainly distorts it.The ontological model implied in such analyses gives priority to the gods, and it is still gods that form the grammatical and logical subject of many statements about the history of religion. They develop, move, ar-rive, demand cult, and reveal themselves. Monographs on individual gods or their veneration are still a genre current in the historical study of religion—presupposing that there is a coherent “idea” or “experience” (to enlarge the list given above) behind the use of a single specific name to address a divine entity in different contexts. Where names are not at-tested, iconographical identifications made by the modern observer easily fill the gap.A growing strand in scholarship has resisted this framework without opting to describe ancient religion as a belief system on the blueprint of Christian dogmatics; that is, these works are not mustering theology, an-thropology, cosmology, eschatology, and eliminating “religious practices” (those that were official as well as those deemed “popular” as an indication that they do not conform to dogmatic definitions and are therefore to be rightly regarded as marginal, if not irrelevant). Instead, ritual has been 2. Rüpke 2003c; more generally Rüpke 2007a, 16–17; cf. Athanassiadi and Frede 1999; Rüpke 2003c; Pongratz-Leisten 2011.3.

Sacrifices and festivals are regarded as the religious grid that was superimposed on urban and rural reality, establishing sacred time and space, religious calendars, and religious landscapes.7 Architecture (even if minimal) and fixed religious roles, frequently taking the form of priest-hoods, gave permanent visibility to these ritual structures. Time-honored traditions, occasionally even in written form (or sometimes supposed to have existed in written form), as in the case of the Roman libri sacerdotum,8 shape and preserve this type of “cold” religion. Following the lead of the introductory account of John Scheid and the two volumes of Mary Beard, John North, and the late Simon Price, I have myself published a medium-sized account of “Religion of the Romans.”9I invoke this model only to discard it along with other trends in early twenty-first-century scholarship. We have learned to see the authorial agenda and discursive quality of our literary sources as part of religion proper and to detect the situational and expressive, that is, performative, character of many rituals.10 Though it may be predominantly practice, an-cient religion is practice that is reflected in discourse, and discourse itself frequently assumes the form of religious practices. It is on that basis that Robert Parker held his Townsend lectures in 2008 “On Greek Religion,” and that I myself had edited a Companion to Roman Religion not much ear-lier.11 In 2012 I was able to publish a monograph that demonstrated how processes of rationalization shaped and modified religious, and above all ritual, practices in the period of the Roman Republic.12The invitation to the Townsend lectures in fall 2013 gave me the op-portunity, for which I am deeply grateful, to advance my previous work on ancient religion.

The concept of appropriation, fundamental to my interpretation of lived religion, is taken from Michel de Certeau and refers to individual, everyday action.13 The individual is not seen as somebody who simply acquires and reproduces established or normative ways of thinking or acting; instead, hegemonic as well as alternative op-tions are evaluated, selected, and transformed for the individual’s pur-poses. Hence, the individual’s actions are strategic, even subversive. These individual ways of living are not merely petty variations of societal norms. It is only through manifold individual appropriations that norms and tra-ditions are reproduced, hence continued and modified at the same time.14 I do not mean to deny the limited range of options available to many, in particular the nonelite people in ancient (and contemporary) societies, but this change of perspective invites us to pay more attention to individual variations in religious behavior, resistance to and rejection of certain prac-tices, and the consequences of these over time. Our interest is not in the immutability—claimed rather than proved in most historical cases—but in the fluidity of ritual and other religious traditions.Lived religiosity, “lived religion,” as reformulated by urban anthropol-ogist Meredith McGuire,15 is a concept helpful for further developing the notion of individual appropriation and reformulating it as a new paradigm in the analysis of Roman religion. Instead of inquiring into how individu-als reproduce a set of religious practices and the intellectual tenets of a faith,16 religion is to be reconstructed as everyday experiences, practices, expressions, and interactions; these in turn constantly redefine religion as practice, idea, and community. The very different, strategic, and (if nec-essary) even subversive forms of individual appropriation are analytically confronted with traditions, their normative claims, and their institutional protections. Thus the precarious state of institutions and traditions comes to the fore. These are as much means of expression and creativity for their inventors and patrons as they are the spaces and material of experience and 13.

Lived ancient religion thus offers a framework within which we can address the whole range of religious practices and conceptions, not as sets of fixed rules or beliefs, but as a per-manently changing field of individual actions, inceptive traditions, monu-mental examples, and incoherent assumptions. Lived ancient religion is as much about variation or even outright deviance17 as it is about the attempts and failures to establish or change rules and roles and to communicate these via public authorities or literary discourse. It is such roles and rules, their variations and limits, and their establishment and communication to oneself and others that constitute the material under consideration in On Roman Religion.I am quite aware that a decision to foreground “individuals” in a study of premodern religion might encounter immediate criticism. The general image of religion, Roman religion in particular, as a rigid ritual system seems not to allow for significant individual variance and even less, to stress my point, for systemic individual variance. Furthermore, the frame-work of civic religion has been reaffirmed by its principal advocate, John Scheid,18 who has greatly shaped and advanced my own thinking. Hence, in my first chapter, “Individual Appropriation of Religion,” I concentrate in a rather elementary manner on the question of individuality in religious matters. Is this a concept that is applicable to ancient societies at all? Or do I base my whole enterprise on a mistaken anachronism? I must, first of all, ensure that I have not been led to implausible historical claims by the hege-monic character of present day individualism: We ought to be individuals!Roles shape the possibilities for individual appropriation as a strategy for action.19 Thus, special attention must be paid to the appropriation of roles and role variation among religious specialists, a general term that I prefer to “priest” and “priesthoods,” which denote a much smaller range of religious roles.20 “Religious specialist” encompasses: short-term religious roles such as dedicators; annual roles such as the magistrates that were frequently responsible for the performance of the most important public 17.

Chapter 2, “Individual Decision and Social Order,” focuses on the roles of religious specialists, in particular on priestly roles in the late republican period. These are typically determined by career patterns and family prestige; individual proclivities are scarcely evidenced within the numerous different Roman priesthoods. At the same time, we do occasionally observe strange, highly individual behavior. This chapter traces these late republican cases and balances them against the social expectations—both the more and the less obvious—that informed individual actions.The following chapters will concentrate on individual ritual practice. Chapter 3, “Appropriating Images—Embodying Gods,” proposes reading a text of the Augustan poet Propertius as a reflection on dedicatory practices and individual appropriations of images. The enormous malleability of the resulting divine figure is among the most interesting results of this analysis. This chapter fundamentally questions the usual understanding of dedica-tions as primarily a means of establishing and continuing specific “cults.”Chapter 4, “Testing the Limits of Ritual Choices,” once again turns to the Propertian oeuvre, with attention to its imagination of individual magic practices and how this is informed by contemporary discourse and practice. Magic is imagined in the poems as a traditional and widely avail-able technique, a legitimate option within certain limits. At the same time, the role of the user of magic is shaped by technical considerations and the agency of objects in magical procedures.Can the practices and experiences of lived ancient religion be identified beyond those that are described and imagined in a discourse that sought to denounce certain practices as extreme? This is the opening question of chapter 5, “Reconstructing Religious Experience.” Again, I take a text from the early empire as a point of departure: in this chapter it is Ovid’s com-mentary on the Roman fasti. I search this text for traces of individual ap-propriation and the spaces within which this was possible. Ovid construed a reader who was interested not only in religious knowledge but also in the emotional registers appropriate to participation in religious performances.Evidently, writing was an important part of many Roman ritual prac-tices from the late republic onward. It offered new spaces and media for the individual appropriation of ritual, in performance and in later more"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Introduction 7reflective contexts. Chapter 6, “Dynamics of Individual Appropriation,” reviews this relationship within a number of ritual settings. Contexts for the interplay of reading and ritual performance in the late republican and early imperial periods include the taking of auspices, ritual banquets, the festivals of the Arval Brethren, and domestic rituals. The invention of rituals—fictitious rituals, that is—is also discussed.Against this background, in chapter 7 I explore the notion of “Religious Communication” more systematically, before it concentrates on the role of inscriptions accompanying dedications in communicating individual situ-ations and interests both to the gods and to a wider audience. Religious communication is special in its insistence on its vertical dimension, which at the same time allows for very specific and often highly visible horizon-tal, interhuman communication. Against the background of the enormous growth of the epigraphic habit until the early third century, this chapter treats lived religion in the imperial period.More narrowly focused, chapter 8, “Instructing Literary Practice in The Shepherd of Hermas,” considers the interplay of supply and demand in re-ligious writing as it relates to an early second-century text, The Shepherd of Hermas. It is the growth of the text itself and particular features of its con-tents and style that suggest an interest both in communal reception and in individual reading. This is confirmed by findings that illustrate the history of the text’s transmission and reception. Taken together, these observa-tions suggest that we read this as a process of long-term, reflective religious individualization.The brief conclusion concentrates on the basic agenda of this book: Roman religion not as a set of cults, one of many localized “religions,” but as a regional and temporal segment of lived religion in antiquity, serving individuals who employed religion as a resource for many a purpose, who tried to find their places in and beyond traditions, or who tried to define those very traditions for successful communication with the divine as well as with their unquestionably relevant human contemporaries."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"1Individual Appropriation of ReligionAny attempt to think about ancient Roman religion needs to start two millennia later. In religious studies it has become a matter of course to look at religion, not only from the perspective of religious communities and re-ligious traditions, but also from the viewpoint of the individual. The latter is true in two respects.1 First, religion today seems to have become primar-ily the business of individuals who shape their personal religiosity (some say “spirituality”) by selecting from a broad spectrum of religious options, whether these be in the form of religious groups and organizations, or doc-trines and practices encountered in mass media (in a book, for instance, or on the Internet). Second, the individual seems simultaneously to have be-come ever more the thematic focus of religion, not just as the bearer of ex-pectations concerning an individual afterlife, personal “well-being,” and “spiritual welfare,” but also as the practitioner of specific rituals and reli-gious training, and as the subject of spiritual experiences.1.

Meanwhile, it has become apparent that the notion of reli-gious individuality as the exclusive and superior property of the “Western world,” which privileges itself with the term “modern,” is also open to criticism.4 Such critiques have taken the form of pointing out the historical absurdity of claims to singularity, or of embracing a counterstereotype that elevates Eastern collectivity over supposed Western individuality.5The conceptual association of modernity with religious individuality has obstructed the investigation of comparable phenomena in earlier periods. Consequently, individuality has received limited consideration in the ex-amination of the dynamics of religion throughout history and in ancient, pre-Christian religion in particular. The religions of great individuals, the religions of poets and thinkers, and the role of the founders and reformers of a given religion have, of course, received much attention.6 This was and is largely due to the nature of available sources, which has favored such inter-est: it is often the literary products of single authors that are handed down in complete or extensive form, whereas verbal communication within and be-tween groups and their members lacks evidence, as is also typically the case regarding testimonials for the reception of the aforementioned texts. By and large, it is the “great individual” who has won the attention of observers, his-toriographers, and authors of letters. Yet it is precisely the deficits inherent in such access to isolated figures that have prompted much critical comment during the last fifty years or so; for all their value, a political history based on big men, a history of ideas based on geniuses only, and a history of religion that concentrates on the testimonies of these major figures have limitations that, since the turn of the twenty-first century, have become visible.72.

This is all the more astonishing because in many cultures religion represents a central instrument of individuation, by individual prayer, vows, or methods of confession. Much of the archaeological evidence for religion from Medi-terranean antiquity has been produced in the course of, or in response to, individual religious action. Religious individuality has been concretized in our very sources, in the form of durable institutionalizations and the media of religious communication.11 In this chapter I intend to highlight the possibilities and problems of an approach to the history of religion that makes use of individualization and individuality, concepts that have been and continue to be used liberally as stereotypes of auto-description and ascription.Marcus Tullius Cicero, in his accounts and discussions of Greek philo-sophical positions, coined the term individua as a translation of the Greek átoma.12 In his paraphrase of the Platonic Timaios, Cicero employed this word to distinguish between the indivisible and divisible matter used by the creator god to form the human soul (animus).13 Seneca later used indi-vidua for indivisible material connections and for indivisible goods, such as peace and liberty.14 By the end of the first century AD the application of the term had been extended to very strong bonds of friendship or love.15 Within philosophy, the dominant discussion remained fixed around the question of whether individuals regarded as first substances (Aristotle) or 8.

Unlike the discus-sions of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, ancient discourse did not the treat difference and distinction between persons as central concerns. Hence the problem of individuality in antiquity.Today, the term “individual” is so frequently employed that it is easy to overlook the difficulties involved in using it in a historical inquiry to set an individual apart from society and to draw a distinction between individual behaviors and the norms of social conformity. In short, “individual” has now become a normative concept: one should be an individual, and of course the individualism of today is the result of a process of individualization that categorically distinguishes the Western modern age from the non-Western world, as from the ancient world, geographically as well as culturally.This turn has consequences for those writing the history of religion. In regarding “Western” premodern cultures, the concept of a polis religion or a civic religion (that is, the identity of the religious practices of a politi-cal unit and their functions within the whole of religion),17 or the concept of the religious unity of medieval Europe18 is exactly the opposite of the self-description of modern societies implied by the secularization thesis: in contrast to the collective and public phenomenon that was premodern re-ligion, contemporary religion is mainly found in individual forms up to the point of being “invisible,”19 if its fundamental decline is not taken for granted anyway.2016.

Thus new and groundbreaking philosophical, aesthetic, linguistic, institutional, and religious alternatives laid open, or even organized and practiced, crit-ical distance toward traditional society.21 This entailed the renewed estab-lishment of Platonism besides and above Aristotelianism, the upgrading of everyday languages, the vernaculars, to written languages (Italian in addi-tion to Latin, for example), the foundation of academies, and the outlin-ing of ideal states. If paganism became not just an aesthetic form but also a real religious alternative,22 we could here identify a tradition of religious individualization that would be enlarged by late medieval practices of re-ligious piety. Later, in the sixteenth century, the Reformation made re-ligion definitively the object of individual choice (however sanctioned in practice) in parts of Europe (and later the Americas) and created space for the individual.The following period displayed a paradox that is characteristic of the individualization processes: the institutionalization of religious individu-ality brought about new norms and limitations, brought about deindividu-alization. The two phenomena, individualization and institutionalization, are difficult to disentangle. Down into the eighteenth century the pro-cesses of confessionalization sharply defined group limits and assured the internalization of specific denominational norms; they did not create reli-gious options freely available to any historical individual. Because of the interaction of individualization and institutionalization, the specification of religious individualization in a given period typically remains spongy for us, or it is based only on isolated textual evidence, for example, the 21.

His starting point was the as-sumption that in traditional societies individualism could appear only in a clear opposition to society. In India, this took the form of extraworldly ori-ented individuals.25 However, pace Dumont, Indian individualism did not in the long run reshape society since it did not lead to theocratic radicaliza-tion of the social order, as in Europe. Here, religious authority (church and pope) initially superseded the more worldly powers. The later religious freedom of the individual was then established within the very institutions of a posttheocratic society.Many other authors, by contrast to Dumont, have allowed their imagi-nations to be dominated by the Orientalist stereotype of Asian despotism and collective protagonists such as “castes.” This has even led to the in-sinuation that in certain non-European, contemporary, but so-called pre-modern cultures, individuals lack even the capacity for formulating any opposition of interests between “themselves” and “society.” This idea at least has been successfully criticized by anthropologists, who do not deny the phenomena of individual personhood.26 Recent work on the religion of premodern and pre-Christian antiquity, usually characterized as “collec-tive,” has produced similarly limited results.

Such a course is not, however, recommended by the very different configurations of individuality I have outlined in the preced-ing section. The polemical stamp of “individuation” and “individualiza-tion” helps steer our attention toward phenomena that have received too little attention within the usual collectivizing perspective. Of course, it is necessary to clarify these concepts along with their complex associations by differentiating forms, types, and phenomena, and by verifying such incip-ient typologies with the help of further material; examples will be given in due course. First, however, we must examine the concepts more carefully.In everyday speech, individuality is an idea that marks distinctions and differences: the differences between a human being and others, but even more so, those between a human being and the society in which she or he lives. The concept has two dimensions: first, an objective dimension. “Indi-viduality” addresses differences between individuals and between individ-uals and societies to the point of deviance and societal rejection; a deviant individual’s actions are judged to violate generally binding norms. Second, less dramatically, individuality can be understood as the perception and practice of choices. Here, the norms of a tradition and a group do not de-termine actions as “individual.” Understood as such, individuality can even be perceived within mass phenomena. Differences between individuals can even result from the fact that each individual combines different social roles and represents different intersections of different overlapping networks.At this point, we should revisit the ideas of the sociologist Georg Simmel.29 He associated the historical development and distribution of 28.

One could develop the follow-up hypothesis that phenomena of individuality can be found in towns and urban centers rather than in villages and face-to-face communi-ties. As a consequence, ancient Rome would be an especially interesting case. With regard to social hierarchy, individuality should then be most pronounced among local elites, who are embedded in supraregional com-munications. It should also appear among immigrants rather than in small stationary populations. All this without denying the banal individuality that is the genetic property of every human.This last sentence points to a fundamental problem: At what point are differences simply expressions of variability without consequences? At what point do they make a difference for the relationship of the indi-vidual to society at large? Such variations do not necessarily impede the reproduction of society or successful socialization, that is, the biographical integration of a person into society. As a consequence of this difficulty in evaluating objective differences, the criterion for individuality is frequently located in the sphere of subjectivity: thus, a significant individuality would be ascribed only if the agent, the subject, enters into a relationship to her or his Self and reflects upon his or her difference compared to the group, traditions, or the various obligatory roles. It is by contrast to all these norms and situational variations that the individual would then attain identity and coherence. Such concepts of the self can be further combined with dif-ferent concepts like “soul” (frequently employed in antiquity)30 or “inner being” (hardly employed in antiquity).31 Imagined communication with the divine or the perceived presence of the divine within or for oneself would be of great importance in the religious stabilization of such subjec-tive individuality.32 Historical sources, however, only rarely attest to such processes.A solution might seem to be provided by the contents of source mate-rial for historical inquiries, but (as I will show) this “evidence” happens to be rather problematic. One could, obviously, make the diagnosis of 30. Bremmer 1983, 2002.31. Markschies 1997.32.

Already in antiquity, starting with Plato, philosophical reflections on the Self played an important role.33 Important lines of such thought can be traced from the philosophy of the Hellenistic schools of the Stoics and Epicureans, through the biblically inspired ideas of Jewish thinkers of the Hellenistic epoch (particularly Philo of Alexandria and Flavius Josephus), into Middle and Neoplatonic philosophy (and its reception in Christianity).34 These reflec-tions, however, are frequently interested, not in a single, unique person, but rather in a generalized individual.35 What seems to be an interest in the situation of the individual turns out to be a reflection on duties that arise from clearly defined social positions.36 At the same time, apparently con-ventional behavior does not force us to assume a lack of reflexivity. Tradi-tional behavior might be a conscious choice, as fundamentalist movements demonstrate quite sufficiently. How can we solve this dilemma?Ancient reflections on the generalized individual lead to an impasse. Could autobiographical texts that offer reflections more intimate than mere narratives of events provide a solution? The late ancient bishop Augustinus has, for example, time and again been identified as the locus of the begin-ning of autobiography and individuality.37 But this criterion for a qualified individuality is also problematic. The assumption that an autobiographical reflection grants an unaltered or at least privileged access to the individual, since the object and subject of the examination are identical, is in itself a topos of the typology of modernity.38 From a literary perspective, autobiog-raphies are, furthermore, constructions of a self that are offered by the au-thor and not simple undisturbed glimpses into the psyche of the subject. The self thus produced is first and foremost a literary fiction. The only empirical datum is the fact that such fictions are composed and read—and this is in-deed an interesting characteristic of the respective epoch or discursive space.If access to past individuality via textual subjectivity therefore proves difficult, ancient discussions of objective individuality, as described above, 33.

Simple deviance is insufficient an attesta-tion of greater individuality (and hence individualization), even if it indi-cates intentional individual variation and discourses about the legitimacy and limits of socially accepted variance.39Consequences for Historical ResearchSome results from research on the present age are helpful in this situation. In an examination of religious behavior and religious convictions in the United States of America, Richard Madsen has shown that individuality is not a general feature of “modern” religion but has itself the character of an option. “Individuality” as a framework of interpretation as well as a form of behavior is primarily located among mobile members of the white mid-dle class. For these persons individuality is affirmed by their own religious commitments and the social consequences of these.40 Individuality is not an arbitrary option, though; it carries a hegemonic character. It is a lifestyle that is dominant and endowed with the claim to dominance in the eyes of the entire society.41 This insight should be taken into account whenever analyzing biographical processes in which individuals acquire “individual-ity” as full members of their society. Such a process of “individuation”—as I would term the biographical development of a single human being from a point of view that supplements the perspective of socialization—is a process of appropriation. It is dependent on ideals that are communicated and on realities experienced through these perceptual filters. It is also dependent on there being space available for individual lifestyle and experiences of differ-ence. Of course the latter in turn influence communication and perceptions.This has important consequences for the analytical use of the concept of individuality in my approach, but also generally for historical disci-plines such as classics, history, and the archaeology of religion.42 It seems less fertile to examine specific situations and persons for the existence of a religious individuality. What might be described as individuality in each 39. Rüpke 2011c.40. Madsen 2009, 1279–82.41. Ibid.42.

It is an empty claim to insist that all these phenomena are simply dif-ferent expressions of the very same feature, “individuality.” Such a claim is merely the result of a theory of modernization that demands a uniform scale of individuality as a yardstick of modernization.If, on the other hand, one understands individuality primarily as a con-cept of differences, it is necessary to analyze the space between collective and individual protagonists as well as how the individual structures this space. One might start by locating the forms and variables in processes of individuation. The description of individuality then is informed by differ-ences in individual behavior and the social necessity to justify choices that are made, or the simple existence of such justification, even if it concerns conformity or traditional actions. For example, an ancient person might pursue animal sacrifice despite philosophical criticism of this practice.43 Whether or not different forms of such individuality strengthen each other and become long-term institutions or reproducible models or discursive formations that are subject to transmission is historically contingent and can be examined under the heading of “processes of individualization.”44Again, it is an empty claim that such processes are uniform and uni-directional. Late antiquity saw reflections about individual religious al-ternatives and real choices. At the same time, the period was marked by increasing legal standardization and violent enforcement of local religious conformity. Past processes of individualization are not incipient forms or precursors of “modern” individualization, nor is modern individuality categorically different from such premodern forms of individuality. Once more, this is not a plea for renunciation of the concept. Its use enables com-parison between epochs and cultures45 and thus offers new interpretative frameworks. Such a revision is desperately needed in the study of a period characterized by a scarcity of coherent sources, a field in which the coun-terstereotype of collectivity has too often been imposed onto the evidence.43.

Domes-tic cults and the collections of statuettes at house altars comprise the first specific area of study under this heading. When viewed statistically, the results for specific places or regions are not very surprising.47 The predom-inance of certain divine signs (that is, gods) is easily explained by reference to typical functions or local traditions.48 And yet, the specific pattern, the combinations of gods and materials, and the different age and provenance of statuettes and images of any particular household show the very individ-ual character of each collection.49In antiquity, the choice was not made from a catalog. Objects handed down from older members of the family found their place beside those that were newly purchased, selected from local producers or merchants. Local public cults were very influential, but this type of formation was oc-casionally supplemented or even supplanted by knowledge derived from texts or personal travels. The archaeological finds—comparatively rare, as the easily transportable items were usually removed when the inhabitants left their place—are the synchronic image of a long biographical, perhaps transgenerational, process. These selections were, of course, influenced by the selections of others, those who had significant relationships to an indi-vidual, and even more so by publicly accessible documents of dramatized selections (that is dedications, votive offerings, and inscriptions in temples), or even by participation in such rituals.46.

As we learn from Aelius Aristides (AD 117–after 177), one could even be drawn into ritual proceedings unintentionally. Aelius was admonished by Asclepius to go into his sanctuary, offer sac-rifice, put up dedications, and distribute sacrificial shares to all present,50 certainly a nice surprise (or an expected form of dining?) for the latter. Children would learn such rituals from participating, for instance, by forming choirs to perform hymns.51 Individuation was a social process, just like socialization. To conform is as much a matter of learning as is to understand the extent of one’s personal competence and legitimate difference.Not every vow and dedication was a crisis ritual, and many “crises,” moreover, were normal and frequent, such as illness, crop failure, child-birth, or emancipation of slaves. And yet individual competence in ritual performance was universally recognized. Inscriptional details about fa-milial or occupational positioning vary widely in degree of detail, and we see the invocation of gods that were unknown locally. In order to define situations, divine help was invoked as precisely as possible; inno-vative combinations and, even more so, innovative names were created. At Carthage, for example, we find a single instance of a juxtaposition of Juno, Minerva, and Bellona with a Diana Caelestis Augusta. Dedicants might simultaneously address deities as distant as Sicilian Venus Ery-cina and the Thracian hero,52 thus attesting individual variation rather than standardized practices.53 One might call this a cult pragmatic indi-viduality. Again, however, we should not think of these as isolated ac-tions. What we find are perhaps also, at least partly, the results of priestly consultation and artisans’ knowledge. It is the very individual “confes-sional inscriptions” from Lydia and Phrygia that most clearly demon-strate the close collaboration of clients and priests within the context of a sanctuary.5450.

The space available for participants was quite limited; many altar-bearing plat-forms in front of Roman temples could accommodate only a few dozen people. Following Krautheimer, Ramsay MacMullen has suggested that there were perhaps only around 4,500 places within titular churches in late fourth-century Rome.56 As a consequence, decentralized rather than centralized rituals might have mobilized the largest number of participants.Again, phenomena of intensification can be found in two areas. Com-plex cults and religious organizations were dependent on a division of labor, including servile butchers and writers, musicians, priests, and chil-dren as assistants. Although—as in the case of the magistrate required to lead a procession—many roles were defined by their associated social prestige and political functions, and thus hardly serve as witnesses of spe-cifically religious individuality, yet we also know of a number of very peculiar appropriations of such roles, which led to conspicuous changes in lifestyle. For instance, at Rome in the late third century BC, a higher frequency in the loss of priestly offices is observable. This will be dealt with in detail in the following chapter. Changes in behavior after becom-ing a flamen or even the suspension of military operations are known from the early second century BC. Given the lack of alternatives, religious roles and honorific positions must have been even more important for women and liberti, and these often comprise the single element of characterization on the tomb inscription of such people.57 This could be termed expressive individuality. In several cases it is evidenced in the collection of historical exempla composed by Valerius Maximus in the early thirties of the first century AD. Exceptional behavior of the past becomes exemplary behavior of the present.5855. Obbink 1989; Winiarczyk 1990; Auffarth 1997.56. MacMullen 2010, 597–98.57. E.g., Rüpke 2008, no. 471; P.

However, we do not have any statistics about the frequency of their meetings. Occa-sional dramatic rituals of change of status (such as the sham execution of a mithraicist-to-be in a fresco in a Mithraeum at Santa Maria Capua Vetere)60 probably did not correspond to a high frequency of interaction within the group. Frequent meetings cannot be excluded, but sequences of votives and remnants of meals61 do not offer corroborative evidence. Furthermore, as already indicated, the verification of individual choice and subjection to be-havioral norms were two sides of the same process of institutionalization.62 Virtuosi roles, as seen among Christian monks, are scarcely paralleled in other cults, but some diviners and some philosophers prove exceptional, even as religious agents, as illustrated by Apollonius of Tyana.63Visionary IndividualityHere I point to individual revelations and the biographies of authors. Thousands of inscriptions, often in the very reduced form ex visu, “from a vision,” attest to dreams and visions in which gods appeared, spoke, and gave commands. Formulas and atypical formulations are both in evi-dence. The large number of deities thus credited is astonishing, more than a hundred according to Gil Renberg.64 Individual religious action, usu-ally dedication, is legitimized by pointing to individual communication with a deity. Such a strategy is known on a larger scale from the aforemen-tioned venerator of Asclepius, Aelius Aristides.65 In his case, far beyond in-cidental legitimization, it is the autobiography as such that results from the transmission of a divine message.66 The production of the text is a drama in itself.67 Divine intervention is made plausible by the detailed narrative 59.

John of Patmos was the first to use the term “apocalypsis” for a revelatory genre and the first au-thor of such a text, giving himself an individual face and autobiographical history. At Rome, a person addressed as Hermas in his text, The Shepherd of Hermas, followed these lines, causing his audience to witness even his sinful thoughts and the reproaches they earned from the revelatory figure. I will return to this text in the final chapter.68 Following models of Hel-lenistic authorial self-presentation, Hermas, Aristides, and later Augus-tine create their divine interlocutor and hence a dialogue in order to open a space for narrating their own individuation, their own becoming a spe-cifically religious individual.Such texts were intended for recitation in institutionalized discursive spaces, meetings of religious groups as described above. The complex in-teraction of individualization and institutionalization as two interrelated processes are visible here. But temples, the regular infrastructure of an-cient religions, should not be forgotten as places for religious individuality. Astonishingly, many texts and regulations concern individual differences if not deviances in the use of these sacred spaces and their resources (divine presence primarily in the form of divine images),69 as we will also see in a later chapter.Methodical ConsequencesCertain consequences must be accepted if one wants to use the idea of the individual (and individual appropriation of religion) and that of individu-ality in religious studies to counter the claim of uniqueness in descriptions of “modern” religiosity. These begin with the choice of the objects of re-search: the focus is on individual practices, on life-cycle rituals in their im-portance not only for the constitution of communities, as Victor Turner has emphasized,70 but also for the process of individuation. Family or in-dividual religious practices in the domestic sphere (which can encompass areas outside the house, such as burial grounds) accrue. Religious activities, 68.

As a consequence, these instances not only offer examples of individual appropriation of religion but also highlight a structural trait, that is, the complexity of processes of institutionaliza-tion, by casting new light onto another sacerdotal group, the priestesses of Vesta.Reinterpretations of Priestly RolesThe events that form the basis of my considerations3 can be organized into three groups: first, those that concern ritual mistakes by flamines maiores, members of the larger pontifical college who were individually responsi-ble for the cult of a specific deity. Second, conflicts about the question of whether these Flamines should be allowed to assume an extraurban of-fice. Third, the case of a priest who, by reinterpreting the regulations of his priesthood, justified interrupting his duties in an extraurban office.In monthly routine rituals at the Ides and in some annual rituals, a priest known as the Flamen Dialis was active at Rome. As the two other flamines maiores, namely the Flamen Martialis and the Flamen Quirinalis, this office was named after a god (in this case Jupiter, in the others, Mars and Quirinus respectively), but his duty was not restricted to the cult of the eponymous god. All the flamines maiores, but in particular the Flamen Dia-lis, were subject to various regulations. Evidence for these regulations in the antiquarian tradition is concentrated or even projected on the Flamen Dialis; the writer Aulus Gellius offers the most detailed list in his Noctes Atticae.4 The penalties for noncompliance were, without exception, harsh: the Flamen Dialis would therefore have been in permanent danger of los-ing his office. All the more astonishing, then, is the fact that the number of historically documented instances of removal from office is very low. The most comprehensive source for these is offered by a short passage in the Memorabilia of Valerius Maximus:Consimili ratione P. Cloelius Siculus, M. Cornelius Cethegus, C.

But an apex that fell down during the sacrifice snatched the same priesthood from Quintus Sulpicius.Parallel traditions for two of the four persons named by Valerius Max-imus suggest that the list is organized chronologically:6 Plutarch states that Marcus Cornelius Cethegus was forced to resign in the year 223,7 and according to Livy, Gaius Claudius, one Flamen Dialis, experienced the same fate in the year 211.8 The explanation offered by Livy (Quod exta perperam dederat “because he had offered the entrails incorrectly”) corresponds to that given by Valerius Maximus, who might have re-ferred to Livy for this information. The passage in Plutarch attests the fact that Quintus Sulpicius must be placed chronologically within this list. His forced resignation due to loss of the apex identifies Sulpicius as Flamen Dialis since it was this Flamen that was forbidden from appear-ing in public without his headdress.9 The event belongs to the same pe-riod as the withdrawal of Cethegus and must, therefore, be dated to around 223.10 Since there was only one Flamen Dialis at a time, the con-temporary Cethegus must have been Flamen Martialis or Quirinalis;11 I assume the same for his probable predecessor Publius Cloelius Siculus.12These cases, all appearing within a very short period of time, can be characterized as signs of radicalization due to external pressures; exact-ing observation of the performance rendered the office precarious.

Without doubt, competition was an important factor in both political and religious innovation during the re-publican era and later.The second set of cases, however, does not support such an interpre-tation. Already in 242 BC, we find conflict concerning a Flamen. Aulus Postumius Albinus was both Flamen Martialis and at the same time a magistrate, namely a consul, who wanted to leave Rome in order to at-tend a theater of war. The Pontifex Maximus opposed this and Albinus was forced to remain in Rome.13 Comparable cases followed. According to Livy,14 Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus “Cunctator” interrupted the consular elections of 215 when the votes of the centuria praerogativa went to—along with a fellow applicant—the Flamen Martialis, Marcus Aemilius Regillus. Fabius pointed out the difficulties that a Flamen would have performing his consular duties in warfare. He was not, however, able to have Aemilius excluded unequivocally.15This pattern of conflict continued: Gaius Valerius Flaccus initially had to argue for his right to a senate seat and magisterial offices. However, he finally occupied the offices of aedilis and the urban praetorship.16 We will return to Flaccus below. In general, the treatment of such problems showed a remarkable flexibility. Rules were easily modified to accommo-date specific personal circumstances and political situations. When, in the election to the aedileship, Gaius could not take an oath as Flamen Dialis,17 this handicap was overcome by having his brother swear the oath in his place.18 This workaround did not solve the fundamental problem of the incompatibility of this priesthood with the magistracies and their political and military duties. In 189, the newly elected praetor Quintus Fabius Pic-tor was forbidden from leaving the city and had to resign himself to the urban praetorship.19 The Pontifex Maximus and consular colleague Pub-lius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus denied the assignation of a province 13.

Gaius Valerius Flaccus was subject to such an appointment in 209, but with unexpected and even long-term success; Flaccus proved himself an excellent Flamen Dialis.23 This did not always turn out well: in 180, an attempt to appoint Lucius Cornelius Dolabella against his will to the office of Rex Sacrorum (perhaps previously occupied by his father) failed.24 An attempt to appoint an ailing member of the Cornelii Scipiones, one Publius Cornelius Scipio,25 to the office of Flamen Dialis in the year 174 seems to have had the same result.26 Likewise, it is frequently questioned whether Gaius Iulius Caesar actually was interested in the position of the Flamen Dialis, an office for which he was nominated but never occupied, and which was not filled by anybody else during his lifetime either.27The final type of individual action sheds some doubt on the gener-alizability of the political interpretation offered above.

This effort to clarify the character of public offices was also extended to religious roles, sacerdotia. But what is striking are the restrictions placed on holding var-ious offices simultaneously. Not only are these measures surprising, but they seemed to fail or to work contrary to intention.Older research in particular has stressed that the incidents we have dis-cussed are located in a field of conflict between patricians and plebeians. The relevance of this social distinction in the religious arena is illustrated by the lex Ogulnia of 300 BC. This legislation established that the large colleges should have a majority occupation of at least 50 percent plebeians while simultaneously preserving a patrician minority of nearly 50 percent. This principle was not only maintained within all the old colleges but was also applied to the staffing of the newly founded college of the Tresviri Epulones in 196.31 Publius Manlius was, presumably, a patrician alongside two tribunes of the plebs.32 It might be supposed that this put an end to the 28.

And yet it actually attests to the ongoing relevancy of the social distinction. Furthermore, certain offices remained inaccessible to one of the two orders: the curule was exclusive to plebeian aediles, and no plebe-ian could become a Flamen Dialis or a Rex Sacrorum.With regard to the cases discussed above, we should also take into ac-count the introduction (even if modified) of direct elections of the Pontifex Maximus in the second half of the third century.33 This was followed by what was presumably the first selection and direct election of a plebeian for the office of Curio Maximus in the year 209.34 From the time of the reorganization of the priesthoods under the Lex Ogulnia, if not before, the authority of the Pontifex Maximus grew constantly, so that he came to play a decisive role in virtually all pontifical and related questions. From 243 until 221, Lucius Caecilius Metellus was the first known plebeian to fill this office. It was during his period of office that the conflicts discussed above arose (241–221). The next plebeian Pontifex Maximus, for the years 213–183, was Publius Licinius Crassus Dives. It is during his priesthood that most of the remaining conflicts that I will examine occurred.We must take a step back, as the historical context of these conflicts is not without interest. First, Rome encountered the problem of the ongoing administration of provinces far from Rome. This problem was completely new for the city: it had not existed until the end of the First Punic War and, in its aftermath, the creation of the provinces of Sicilia and Sardinia. The solution to this was legislation forbidding long-term absence for the exclusively patrician priesthood of the Flamines (maiores) (and, of course, the Rex Sacrorum). This policy, put in place during the second half of the third century BC, endured despite repeated individual protests. The sec-ond area of conflict concerned the most significant characteristic of Roman priesthoods, the fact of lifelong appointment. The requirement for rigor-ous observation of ritual details as a precondition for remaining in office fundamentally endangered this conception of priesthoods. It is this topic that was picked out as a central theme in discussions from the first century 33. The election was performed in a meeting (comitia) of seventeen out of thirty-five tribus (drawn by lot; see Cic. Leg. Agr. 2.16–18).34.

When Livy talks about the fact (in the case of Gaius Valerius Flaccus) that a positive change in the character of Flamines led to a resumption of the supposedly old custom of granting this priest a senate seat, a privilege that had been lost due to the indignitas of earlier Flamines,36 then one could relate this to the events of the 220s, if one assumes historicity.When Crassus succeeded the patrician Metellus and became the second plebeian to occupy the office of the supreme pontiff, he opened another area of conflict by imposing forced appointments. It is worth examining instances of such compulsion closely. In the aforementioned case of the plebeian Gaius Valerius Flaccus in 209 BC, Livy does not emphasize the resistance of the candidate (a fact that one might, but need not, infer from the wording coacti flaminis), but rather refers to his poor reputation among his cognate relatives, possibly indicating that there was resistance to the appointment. The case of Flaccus should be viewed alongside another ap-pointment, one that remained undetermined, namely that of the Rex Sa-crorum. It is highly probable that Marcus Marcius had been appointed the first plebeian Rex Sacrorum by the first plebeian Pontifex Maximus dur-ing the late 240s or 230s. Unfortunately, there is no extant literary report of this process.37 When Marcius died in 210, the office remained unfilled, and after a vacancy of two years—pointing to conflict and debate—only patricians were appointed whenever the office again became vacant. Fi-nally inaugurated in 208, the Rex Sacrorum Gnaeus Cornelius Dolabella had only been Monetalis before; he was young and remained in the office for twenty-eight years.38 The first plebeian Curio Maximus had also been chosen in the year 209. The appointee, Gaius Mamilius Atellus, attained a praetorship soon thereafter, in 207 BC.39 His praetorship, to be precise, was 35. For example, for Sulla, see Rüpke 2005d, no. 1390 with further literature.36.

The importance of the local dimension, the tie with Rome, is illuminated by the distribution of priesthoods. Potential absence from Rome (due to a lack of frequent ritual obligations) made it acceptable that a plebeian fill such a priesthood.In the year 205, a vacancy appeared when the Flamen Martialis Marcus Aemilius Regillus40 died after attaining the consulship. In 204, a successor was found in Tiberius Veturius Philo, brother to the consul of 206 and per-haps already of advanced age, since it is probable that he was succeeded not long after the turn of the century.41 The lack of offices Philo had held, his age, the vacancy (the precise length of which cannot be determined, as the turn of the year is our only evidence)—all these conditions signal conflict about filling the office. If Philo’s successor, Publius Quinctilius Varus, was identical with the praetor of the year 203, he would have been of a very advanced age when he died as Flamen in 169 BC; it seems more reason-able to conjecture that a son of his was chosen, one who was appropriately young but attained no other office despite the possibilities afforded by his familial status.42 A routine procedure seems to be at work here, visible also when the young Scipio was appointed Flamen Dialis in the 180s or in the attempt to appoint Dolabella as Rex Sacrorum; he was, after all, the son of the deceased Rex Sacrorum. Given this pattern, Dolabella’s rejection of the office should be interpreted as idiosyncratic, hardly systemic. Like the forced resignations of the 220s, the forced appointments and the disputes over the quality of the appointees occur within a relatively short period around the year 210. Both types of activity are centered around controver-sial individuals and demonstrate a new awareness of individual qualities and differences. At the same time, in systemic terms, it was the conflict be-tween patricians and plebeians that brought these new notions of personal fitness to the fore.The practice of forced appointments should not be thought to sug-gest that the offices of the Flamínates were dreaded.

And there is much that suggests that this was not without reason: these offices must, in fact, have been sought after. Evidently, the exclusively patrician offices, the great Flaminates, the Rex, even membership in the Salii conferred significant privilege and pres-tige. These positions offered an entire lifetime of public prominence with their unusual dress (to be worn even outside larger ritual performances), with the right to a curule chair and a lictor, and with their frequent ap-pearances in public; these priests were frequently active in the political and religious center of the city. All this stands in a clear contrast to the other priesthoods—with terms of just a month or a year—that were open also to plebeians.43The sodalitas of the Salii admitted a considerable number of patricians to an early priesthood that was characterized by a short period of office. In the case of the Salii, it is likely that it had become common practice already in the late republic to leave the priesthood on achieving higher official of-fices or another priesthood that conferred great prominence in the impe-rial era. The prosopographical material offers no corroboration, and the case of Furius Bibaculus, who was already praetor and remained a Salius, even seems to speak to the contrary.44 We need not, however—against the background of the cases reviewed so far—generalize such an example, evi-dently considered worthy of individual mention in what must have been contemporary sources. Traditions of dealing with priestly offices were sub-ject to divergent individual appropriations and interpretations. Instead of a radical break and a mass eviction of priests from their Salian priesthood under Augustus (as a part of his attempt to grant access to priesthoods to large numbers of his followers), it is easier to assume that the basics of republican practice were continued into the imperial period. This hypoth-esis is supported by the twofold nature of Augustus’s course of action: he increased the number of patricians and the number of the Salii at the same time. Before the Augustan era, there is no evidence for differentiation be-tween the Salii Palatini and the Salii Collini, nor for the higher status of the former.43.

Moreover, the individual privileges described above could begin as early as two decades before consular age. Who would exchange an associated professorship directly after high school for the mere hope for a chair at the age of forty-five? We should not imagine that the importance of these priesthoods was limited to their potential to advance one’s political career.Again, these individual interests had a systemic aspect. Several questions present themselves: What (in the uniform nobility of the republic since the third century) legitimized the disproportionately large representation of patricians in high offices, particularly the consulate? What legitimized their monopoly on certain procedures, such as the interregnum? And fi-nally, what justified the Julian-Augustan expansion and promotion of the patrician order with its enormous array of distinct careers? Evidently, the special religious roles of the patrician order formed the hardest argument for these privileges (irrespective of the perennially controversial issue of the auspices),45 and the argument for the special religious role of patricians was conveyed through the few exclusively patrician priestly offices. Only the aforementioned patrician priesthoods were permanently and unmis-takably visible. The election of a priest, just as the election of consul or another magistrate, required public knowledge of the status, patrician or plebeian, of the candidates, in order to assure the correct overall composi-tion of a given priestly college.Transposing Religious Rules across GendersThe visibility and the exceptional quality of the patrician religious offices are also apparent in their inclusion of women, a practice not found in the priesthoods available to plebeians. This needs no argument in the cases of the Reginae Sacrorum and the Flaminicae, the wives of the great Flamines. For the Salii, however, we are dependent on a very weak tradition.

It is important to note that this form of marriage was also open to women of plebeian origin, who were thus made patricians.47The topic of women calls attention to an obvious gap in my presentation of the evidence thus far, and it offers a further argument for interpret-ing Roman religion as a historical phenomenon subject to constant modi-fication. There was another lifelong priesthood with high visibility: the Virgines Vestae, the vestals, persons who were excluded from all political offices on account their gender. While male priests have entered the his-torical record by virtue of their appointment, in the case of the vestals it is more often than not their removal from office—in the horrifying ritual of being buried alive—that has brought their names into the literary tra-dition. This is true from mythical times down to the late antique corpus of letters of Symmachus, in which he continues to make the detection of unchaste vestals a task of the pontifical college, one of the few remaining at the end of the fourth century.48 Hildegard Cancik-Lindemaier has shown that the threat of lawsuits on account of incestus, frequently resulting in death sentences, was a basic feature, the conditio humana so to speak, of the six-headed college of Vesta. This was a danger for which other legal privileges did not fully compensate.49The issue here is the precariousness, the vulnerability of sacerdotal sta-tus construed mainly as a consequence of (alleged) infringement of ritual prescriptions; it was this state of insecurity that Lucius Caecilius Metellus, as a plebeian Pontifex Maximus, tried in vain to introduce among the pa-trician Flamines maiores when he enforced the penalty of divestment of a priesthood for the mere loss of a headgear during a ritual. For a period of more than half a millennium this vulnerability so construed was imposed 46. Fest. 439.18 L; Glinister 2011.47. Thus Baudry, following my suggestion in Rüpke 1990.48. Symm.

Answers, I claim, are to be found not in the latest monographs,51 but in prosopography. Plebeian names, twelve (with any certainty) of the seventeen names that are known, dominate the republican period, starting with the mythical names.The temporal distribution of the exceptions is interesting. The earli-est is an Aemilia, made vestal around 205, who in 178 served as Vestalis Maxima and in a wondrous way relit the fire that a younger vestal had, in her carelessness, allowed to dwindle.52 This Aemilia53 has been considered a patrician since Friedrich Münzer identified her as the oldest daughter of the later Pontifex Maximus Marcus Aemilius Lepidus.54 The assumption that the anonymous younger delinquent vestal was also patrician55 is com-pletely unfounded. The patrician status of Claudia, the daughter (or sister, according to a less probable tradition) of the triumphator and consul of 143 BC, Appius Claudius Pulcher, is secure.56 The vestal Aemilia executed in 114 might well have been patrician;57 it would be unusual to find a plebe-ian Aemilia in such a position by the late second century. However, this argument applies in no way to the vestal Fabia, accused of incestus with Sergius Catilina but acquitted in the year 73.58 This half sister of Cicero’s wife Terentia could quite probably have been a plebeian; distinguished patrician family branches hardly offer themselves for identification in this period. If Fabia was plebeian, the only possible patrician would be removed from the circle of the Virgines Vestales, the composition of which is completely known for the late seventies: for Popillia, Perpennia, Fonteia, 50.

It might have been due to the activity of the Pontifex Maximus Crassus, already discussed above, that the first exception occurred at the end of the third century. Toward the end of the second century, perhaps with the execution of Aemilia in the year 114, we cease to find any examples of patrician vestals. This observation is corroborated by legislation from the following period. For example, the lex Papia, recorded by Gellius in the second half of the second century AD, systematically laid out rules regard-ing this priesthood. Gellius catalogs norms: at what age, from what kind of family, by what rites, ceremonies, and observances, and under what conditions a Vestal Virgin was “captured” by the Pontifex Maximus. He describes the legal privileges she was granted immediately upon being cho-sen, and he states that, according to Labeo, neither was she lawfully heir of an intestate person, nor could anyone be her heir, in the case that she died without a will. He continues:Sed Papiam legem inuenimus, qua caueretur, ut pontificis maximi arbitratu uirgines e populo uinginti legantur sortitioque in contione ex eo numero fiat et, cuius uirginis ducta erit, ut eam pontifex maximus capiat eaque Vestae fiat. sed ea sortitio ex lege Papia non necessaria nunc uideri solet. nam si quis honesto loco natus adeat pontificem maximum atque offerat ad sacerdotium filiam suam, cuius dumtaxat saluis religionum obseruationibus ratio haberi possit, gratia Papiae legis per senatum fit.60Yet there is a Papian law, which provides that twenty girls be selected from the people at the discretion of the supreme pontiff, that a choice by lot be made from that number in the assembly, and that the girl whose lot is drawn be ‘taken’ by the supreme pontiff and become Vesta’s. But that allotment in accordance with the Papian law is usually unnecessary at present. For if any man of respectable birth goes to the supreme pontiff and offers his daughter for the priesthood, provided consideration may be given to her candidacy 59. These names are known from the list of participants in the inaugural dinner of the pontifi-cal college in 70 BC (Macrob. Sat. 3.13.11).60.

The text suggests that the names of the fathers of the candidates were on the lots. The girl was then made vestal by the Pontifex Maximus’s ritual “capture.”A conflict regarding whether patrician women could be made vestals is already suggested by the nomination of the patrician Aemilia by the ple-beian chief pontiff, and if one seeks more definitive evidence for such a dispute, one could find it in a detail that, with no connection to the context, Gellius mentions shortly before his treatment of the Papian law. It was permitted to sisters of vestals as well as daughters and fiancées of different priests, to decline the office:. . . eam cuius soror ad id sacerdotium lecta est, excusationem mereri aiunt; item cuius pater Flamen aut augur aut XV uirum sacris faciundis aut VII uirum epulonum aut Salius est. sponsae quoque pontificis et tubicinis sacro-rum filiae uacatio a sacerdotio ista tribui solet.61But they say that one whose sister has been chosen to that priesthood ac-quires exemption, as well as one whose father is a Flamen or an augur, one of the Quindecimviri sacris faciundis, one of the Septemviri epulonum, or a Salian. Exemption from that priesthood is regularly permitted also to the betrothed of a pontiff and to the daughter of the tubicines sacrorum.The exemption of daughters of Flamínes or Salii implies that it was not priests per se but primarily patricians that were concerned, even if Gelli-us’s wording avoids explicit mention of this status. This concentrates the choice of vestals on plebeian families. The superiority of patricians is dem-onstrated to all ex negativo in every lawsuit against the vestals, and the 61.

We see innovative behavior not only on the part of the plebeian Pontifices Maximi; we also find among the patricians individuals who interpret a priestly role not in the traditional way (as a lifelong mag-istracy with some ritual tasks) but as a specifically religious role, as a Sa-lius for instance. Both case types demonstrate highly individual behavior. It seems that the actors intended to problematize the relationship between their priestly and political offices or to privilege a specific religious obliga-tion over a political role. In each case they did this by asserting the obliga-tion of perfect religious performance. Basic, however, to these individual attempts to further develop given roles was a shared conviction: the reli-gious framework of the Roman polity was to be provided by its patrician members in particular. Even the elite’s “civic religion” was not available in equal part to all noble citizens. In the emperors’ postconstitutional state62 this inequality was even further highlighted by the extensive ennobiliza-tion of supporters through the endowment of patrician status and by Au-gustus’s reorganization of patrician priesthoods like the Salii. With regard to the priestesses of Vesta, the combination of these trends entailed further accusations and sentences. The limitations on individual appropriations of this religious role were clearly drawn more tightly.62.

In its application to contemporary social analysis, the concept of lived religion does not address how individuals replicate within their bi-ography a set of religious practices and beliefs already institutionalized by some “official religion”—or, conversely, opt out of adhering to tradition. Of course, given the relationship of individuals to tradition, such a defini-tion of lived religion could, in principle, work for an ancient context that was religiously pluralistic, or in a mono- or oligo-confessional society. But because clearly distinct religions did not begin to be formed until late an-tiquity, as I have argued elsewhere,1 the perspective of lived ancient reli-gion focuses on the actual everyday experience, on practices, expressions, and interactions that relate to religion. As such, religion is understood as a spectrum of experiences, actions, beliefs, and communications hinging 1.

For the pur-poses of historical research, the existence of religious norms, of exemplary official practices, and of control mechanisms and enforcement should be taken into account. It is precisely such institutions and norms that tend to predominate in the surviving evidence. In analyses of the interplay be-tween the individual and tradition, the concept of “appropriation” plays a key role.4 The specific forms of religion-as-lived are barely comprehensible in the absence of distinct modes of individual appropriation (to the point of radical asceticism and martyrdom), in the absence of cultural techniques (such as the reading and interpretation of mythical or philosophical texts, rituals, pilgrimages, and prayer), and in the absence of the various media employed in the representation of deities within and outside of sanctuaries.The notion of agency implicit in the notion of appropriation (far more so than in that of “reception”) is not unproblematic, if one forgets about its structural dimension. Agency is an attribute ascribed to a subject within a context of structures, but these structures are themselves the product of (repeated or modified) individual acts.5 With respect to the normativ-ity ascribed to teachings, traditions, practices, and narratives in the field of religion, the description of how ideas are adopted and the specifics of processes of reception are of particular importance. Cultural-theoretical and historical-anthropological accounts of appropriation often clash with the models found in religious symbolic systems where transcendent enti-ties are acknowledged as norm-setting agents. Jupiter teaches Numa how to sacrifice in Roman tradition; Apollo is asked to give oracles on theo-logical and ritual matters at Claros. It is this disjunct that leads me to a text wherein a god both formulates such norms and simultaneously illus-trates their appropriation. Of course, it would be just as problematic to 2.

To make full use of the model of lived ancient religion, scat-tered evidence should be contextualized and interpreted by relating it to individual agents, their use of space and time, their formation of social co-alitions, their negotiation with religious specialists or providers, and their attempts to make sense of religion in a situational manner and thus render religion effective.First, however, I should add another preliminary observation, vital to our understanding of the claims and complaints of the god who speaks in the text: in many modern accounts of ancient gods they are accorded ontological priority, thus following a mode of thinking that is imputed to ancient agents. Representation of a god is, by this view, a secondary activ-ity, albeit one that has become the subject of increasing academic inter-est.6 According to a systemic view of ancient religion, the central concern of representation is similitude; for those interested in the cult pragmatics of lived ancient religion it raises different questions. Religious communi-cation with the unseen must first medially construe their addressees and second hide their constructed character.7 The religious actor must control the selected deity and emphasize its power and whimsy at the same time. Both tasks would be facilitated whenever the actor were able to refer to traditions of beliefs and canons of representation, but these would need to match the relevant situation, the availability of resources, the strategic aims of the agent, and all the other social and material constraints, in short, the extent and the limits of her or his agency.8 Three-dimensional statues of gods held a special position within the media available to achieve these purposes. It is the form of a human or at least partly an-thropomorphic body that gives a maximum of person-like qualities and individuality to the figure before the religious actor. It is to such statues and the practices associated with them that I will turn in the final part of this chapter.6.

Propertius won fame by pub-lishing a book of elegies on the theme of his love (or that of his male per-sona) for a fictitious Cynthia, with both characters as members of the upper echelons of society. The poems also dwell on the political context of the civil wars preceding the sole rule of Caius Iulius divi filius Caesar, called Augustus from 29 BC onward. Interspersed among the love elegies are poems that deal with the cruelties of Augustus’s subjection of Etruria and Umbria (the region of the poet’s birthplace, Assisi). During the second half of the first century BC, the cultural and political unification of Italy was an ongoing and still-painful process, invoked by all the poets dominating the literary circles of Rome, who issued from the different Italic regions.9 Propertius was a very careful observer of politics and of the society of his time, and he had access to the immediate circle around the princeps. Book 4, an addition to the earlier poems in books 1–3, brings religion center stage, from the opening poem onward.10Propertius 4.2 has held a degree of prominence in histories of Roman religion due to its references to topography and early Roman history.11 However, as far as I can see, this text, which has a god speak about him-self in the first person, has never been the subject of an analysis interested in ritual or modes of religious representation and appropriation of gods. One might read it as a contribution to the ancient controversy about the status and power of images of divinities, a controversy that has gener-ated much interest in previous decades, as noted above.12 My analysis, however, will be focused on the practices through which the image is addressed and their consequences. This is relevant for our understanding 9. See, e.g., Feichtinger 1991; Rüpke 2009d, 123–24; and Günther 2012 for the civil war context; on Assisi, see Newman 1997, 54–99 and Cairns 2006, 4–14.10.

As it turns out, my readings are extremely conservative. The text presented is much closer to the pre-twelfth-century archetype than those of all modern editions. Evidently, this poem presents a good example of a hermeneutical circle that begins with faulty expectations regarding cultural (and, in this case, specifically religious) patterns, and thus arrives at the necessity to alter a transmitted text even where it is inherently acceptable and hardly the result of misunderstandings on the part of copyists.13Our poem begins the careful sequence of interspersed aetiological and erotic elegies contained within Propertius’s relatively short fourth book. It is preceded only by a pair of programmatic elegies, which call for and subsequently criticize aetiological poetry on Roman topics (4.1 and 4.1a).14 Review of all possible contemporary references has led to a general agree-ment that the book was composed in or shortly after 16 BC. The dense network of motifs (such as unus and una puella) and the well-organized range of subjects indicate that many of the poems were composed specifi-cally for this book, and were edited or at least finished by the poet him-self.15 As a whole, they put into practice what is asserted in the very first elegy: “I will sing rituals and gods and the old toponyms.”16 In the ensuing poems, a variety of speakers are found in locations of ancient ritual in the center of Rome. They are interested in antiquarian details and provide aetiological explanations for various phenomena.17 Erotic poems appear at regular intervals. Evidently, Propertius is pursuing his initial poetological deliberations on the appropriate subject of elegy, as formulated in 4.1a and b. One might read the whole book as a metapoetic discourse. If I neglect this dimension, as my analysis is directed toward Roman religion, I do not negate it. The existence of this strand does not, however, diminish the relevancy of Propertius’s observations on religious practice. Rather, it 13.

How Italic was Roman culture? How many patriae did a Latin-speaking Italian at Rome have? Etruscans and Oscans are agents mentioned in the Vertumnus poem, while the speaker of the introductory elegy of the fourth book had defined himself both as an Umbrian and at the same time as a “Roman Callima-chus” (4.1.63–64).

Never-theless, my reading, which will be given in some detail, is interested only in the narrator’s view on lived ancient religion. On the whole the text pre-sents itself as an inscription, addressing every possible passerby. Such a communicative technique is known from many epigraphical texts. Who, however, is the speaker? My first contention is that it is the god himself. The speaker establishes a distance between himself and the statue by his speaking of a body (in . . . corpore, 1) and of a statue (signa . . . dei, 2). Thus a difference is established; the god who introduces himself by the name of Vertumnus possesses a body and a statue (or statues).24 The god is not co-extensive with the statue, as is stressed in a later passage where reference is made to an earlier wooden image (59): identity is constituted in the con-tinuity of the god, not that of the statue. Likewise, the god is not identical with or bound to his place; verses 3–4 indicate that the speaker has been in other places before Rome: he “left,” that is, was previously in, Etruria among the Volsinii. Perhaps even a third distinction is referred to. The divine subject preceded his naming; he is earlier than his name: mihi . . . nomen ab eventu patria lingua dedit (47–48). Here, we should note that “fa-therly language” is somewhat ambivalent in the mouth of an Etruscan im-migrant, as it refers to the Latin etymology made explicit in this distich. In sum, the identity of the god is the identity of a subject who is able to remember and narrate change as change encountered by himself. Under these circumstances, the fact that he knows of the change of the course of the Tiber only from hearsay (aiunt, 7)—this is the first of the poem’s ety-mologies Vert-amnis, “turned river”—implicitly questions the correctness of an etymology that is not backed by his own experience. In another pas-sage, that which refers particularly to unsuitable dedications, the assertion “I remember” (memini, 27) affirms the identity I propose.It is not etymology that defines the god, but ritual. Various agricultural products adorn the god from summer to late autumn. The variety of fruits is 24. I follow Hutchinson (2006, 89 ad loc.) in rejecting the interpretation of signa as mere in-dicators (as does Cairns 2006, 281). These lines define the topic of the poem; they do not initiate argumentation regarding ethnicity."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Appropriating Images—Embodying Gods 53stressed as much as the different seasons (11–18). Transposing these verses, as has been suggested recently by Heyworth,25 would destroy the link be-tween the immediately preceding etymology based on annus, “year,” and the elaborate description of seasonal offerings. It would also eliminate the carefully maintained distinction between agriculture here and horticulture later.26 The specific dedications that the god lists are pronouncedly indi-vidual. The grafter who harvests apples from a pear tree (17–18) is the most extreme example. Nevertheless, all these practices could be summarized as sacrum; it is recurrent ritual that is described. A generation earlier, Marcus Terentius Varro had mapped highly specialized deities onto functions or rather fields of competence in the fourteenth book of his Antiquitates rerum divinarum.27 At first, this poem also seems to suggest such areas of compe-tence. After all, the Forum Holitorium, the urban market of vegetables, was not far from the statue’s position during Propertius’s time.I follow the transmitted text in preserving Vertumni . . . sacrum (12).28 Sacrum is the aspect of cult that provides the raison d’être of the god at Rome. From a different perspective, sacra is that which is due to the god. Again, sacrum implies regularity. This regularity, however, is not a pre-cise and detailed repetition of a ritual script. Instead, it is based on habits and beliefs, the range of variation of which is described in the verses that follow. There are no written documents, no lex sacra affixed to the open sanctuary.29 The rules are rules that are presumed by visitors. The read-ing vulgus instead of rursus in verse 12 is an old conjecture, an attempt to define the subject of such assumptions and beliefs; populus is a younger proposal.30 Both miss the point of the whole poem. It is not Propertius but modern scholarship that restricts heterodox beliefs to a particular (lower) social stratum, “popular” or “folk religion.”After amply illustrating it, the god himself opposes the etymology based on annus with a forceful mendax fama, “lying rumour” (21). It is surprising 25. See, however, for example, Heyworth 2007b, 438.26. Overlooked also by Syndikus 2010, 313.27. See Rüpke 2005b and 2007a, 59–61.28. The conjecture Vertumno (dative) of Ayrmann is followed by Hutchinson (2006, 91), who argues that mere usual practice could hardly define the ritual in a sufficient manner.29. On such rules for the performance of ritual in sanctuaries in the Latin world, see, e.g., Ennabli and Scheid 2007–2008.30.

The offerings derived from commercial agriculture are very similar to what is later described as gifts supplied by gardening, by horticulture, de quo mihi maxima fama est, “what I am most famous for” (41). But Propertius’s speaker is not contrasting correct and incorrect practice. In both cases the rationale behind the offer-ings is, epistemologically speaking, a matter of fama, “rumor.” We are far from knowledge or prescripts. Any truth claim could be related only to the accuracy of the etymology itself. Ritual action and theological reflection about the god’s identity fall asunder.In a long chain of examples (23–46), the discrepancy between ritual practices and theological deliberations increasingly comes to the fore. This is hardly consistent with an idea of ancient religion wherein individuals are religious actors who carefully try to select and reproduce the most ef-fective cult from the broad public (and sometimes private) range of avail-able sanctuaries and sets of ritual practices associated with a particular god (frequently referred to as “the cult of Apollo,” “the cult of Venus,” and so forth). What is presupposed in Propertius is a basic mode of communica-tion with deities via dedications. As Marcel Mauss has pointed out in his groundbreaking reflections on giving, the gift is an element in a strategy to define addressees in terms of their status and their relationship to do-nators.31 This is relevant for the ancient practice of prayer accompanied by dedication and for that of the vow promising dedication. Within the asymmetrical communication between the hierarchically inferior mortal and the powerful god, who is visible only in mediated form, these practices were able not only to represent the initiator before an audience and attract the latter’s attention, as relevance theory suggests,32 but also to help define the elusive recipient.33 Therefore, the temporary donations arising out of situational decisions by individual agents and viewed by others momen-tarily on the one hand, and permanent attributes on the other, are thus 31. Mauss 2002, on which see Moebius and Papilloud 2006.32. For the basic tenets of relevance theory, which does refer to religion, see Sperber and Wilson 1987; Wilson and Sperber 2002, 2012.33.

It is only the later, distant observer who can draw a distinction between a contingent and temporary votive, which could be lost without any long-term effect on the one hand, and a conceptual and permanent element of an image, the loss of which might result in the end of a cult on the other. The contemporary observer would have to apply external norms to arrive at such judgments. I claim that it is the very purpose of the Propertian poem to deny the existence of such extramaterial norms.The examples given by the text are adequate to such a strong claim. The first distinction involved is a norm regarded as fundamental in Roman religion, that is, the category of gender. Whether Vertumnus is male or fe-male is subject to the dedicator’s decision. Fiam, “I shall become,” and the rhetorical question “Who would deny?” (quis neget, 23–24) illustrate the factuality of a temporary change that instantly becomes normative. The location of the statue (and hence the poem’s putative setting) in a “red-light district” of Rome34 makes this even more pointed.The strong tone is continued. In the following distich “you will swear” (iurabis, 25) is used, where a much softer wording such as crederes “one would believe” could have sufficed. The implications of these lines extend far beyond ephemeral appearances. To imagine that the statue itself could have “been cutting grass” a moment ago (26), inverts the relationship be-tween what is seen and what is merely imagined, heightening the factual-ity of the imagination; it is the immobility of the statue that seems to be deceptive. The challenge now becomes to truly believe that the figure is a motionless statue rather than to enliven it in one’s imagination. The im-movable has a moved past.The following verses problematize the credibility of such a past. The claim that the god had gloriously carried weapons needs confirmation by the god’s own memory—I have already pointed to this instance of me-mini (27). This is supplemented by the much more plausible memory of having been a harvester by virtue of receiving a basket. I need not stress here that the position of the martial reference in the hexametric line and of the peaceful memory in the pentametric line is also part of a poetological 34.

As no dedicatory objects are named, I suggest that what might be indicated here are different media of religious representation. The text perhaps refers to transportable statuettes, such as were used in domestic contexts and brought to court appearances. This might also explain the reference to Vertumnus as a charioteer and expert horse rider, expressed by the term species, “image” (35). Statuettes of the god appeared in such forms and were used on such occasions.The figures of a horseman and soldier do not cohere with any possible single “function” of the god. Propertius’s use of past tenses in 27–28 (tuli, eram) underlines how contingent and situational such configurations were. The identity implied here is not a theological proposition, but merely a remembered biographical identity.Are there limits to the definitional power of the users of the image? Hardly any! It can go so far as to mistake Vertumnus for other gods, con-fusing him with Iacchus and Phoebus (31–32). Here, however, a norm is formulated. Such confusion is characterized as illicit. Furare speciem, “I shall steal the appearance,” implies a sharp condemnation. Thus, a limit to interpretation and ritual usage is set, even if counterfactually. This limit is not argued for on the basis of some “essence” or “nature” of the god, some identity delineated by theological discourse or a body of mythical narratives. The norm that is implied addresses ritual practice and the con-sequences of practices that endanger a user’s ability to identify and dif-ferentiate between deities known through their names and iconography. Furthermore, the text itself excludes the possibility that the contents of the norm could be preserved. The following couplet (33–34), as printed here, succinctly expresses the permanent transition of divine activity and divine identity in the form of tutelage over a certain activity.35 Equipped with 35. Thus I do not follow Cairns 2006 in his understanding of the transmitted (and probably corrupt) Favor or Faunor (v. 34) as Favor (282–83, with reference to Martianus Capella), or, pace Heyworth, as Faunus (Heyworth 2007b).

Verses 35–40 offer further ex-amples that might refer to historical evidence for the veneration of Ver-tumnus while also paying tribute to literary models.36 I would like to point out that the statue “moves”; Vertumnus describes himself as a god in ac-tion. Consequently, the visible statue is but a snapshot, documenting a mo-ment in a sequence of activities. And yet the god is modeled according to his statue; his appearance is extrapolated from that of the statue and its attributes as conferred in the form of votives. The sequence of verbs like “hunting,” “catching,” “fishing,” “traveling,” “bending,” and finally “carrying amidst dust” evoke scenarios that transgress the idea of a statue caught in static poses and attitudes. Potential votives—objects such as a net, arrow, sunhat, fishing rod, tunic, crook, and basket—are the point of departure in each instance. The media to be imagined, however, are not statues and statuettes but paintings, such as might be found in private houses rather than open sanctuaries. This is, as I have to admit, a hypoth-esis built on the presupposition that Propertius refers to a real or at least plausible range of iconographies of Vertumnus that reach far beyond the average dedication.Against the backdrop of this enormous range of definitions, enacted historically (that is, ritually, by means of gifts), the most statistically im-portant construction of the god comes in an understatement: “Why, pray, should I add . . . ?” (41) Since, as I claim, Propertius is interested in the variety of appropriations of the god rather than in determining a norma-tive “essence,” this is pointed rather than ironic. It is telling that by trans-posing six verses (placing 13–18 after 44) from the beginning of the poem into this last field of competence (horticulture, detailed in 43–46), modern interpreters such as Stephen Heyworth add massive weight to what they imagine Propertius’s emphasis should be: on an agricultural deity. Our hidden models of how ancient religion functioned are far from innocent! Propertius himself makes an argument, if I might say so, for the mutual constitution of ritual activity and the supposed competence of the god in the deliberate ambivalence of verse 42, claiming “that the choicest gifts 36.

Here, what is most important is the increasing passivity of the speaker. Vertum-nus is not credited with any agency in his many transformations. Gram-matically he is merely the patient, using the passive voice vertebar (47). The god’s position shifts from center scene to the wings, from action to observation. He is bound to his location with no ability to move, and he must pray to the father of the gods—in the first and only genealogic re-mark of the text—to grant him even an interesting view ante meos . . . pedes, “before my feet for all time” (56). The addition per aevom (55) even removes the possibility of change over time. The speaker is entirely ab-sorbed within the statue. The maple stump is a “poor god” (pauper deus, 60). The separation between god and statue, carefully established in the poem’s opening, is erased in the final six verses. It is unmistakably now the statue, the object that is speaking, not the god. This too is in imitation of inscriptional convention. In his edition, Heyworth suggests that we read suberunt, “written underneath,” instead of superant, “rest,” in line 57. But above all, these lines present a sophisticated mise-en-scène of the god’s lack of agency.Appropriating ImagesIn most cases, ancient images of gods were artifacts, man-made objects (“fetishes” from Latin facticius via Portuguese feitiço).37 Reflections on this fact can be found from early Greek and Greco-Roman antiquity, from the Judaism of the Second Temple, down into late antiquity and Byzantine iconoclasm.38 The early imperial text analyzed above presupposes such dis-courses, but it is not primarily interested in the topic of adequate represen-tation. The transition from a roughly worked piece of wood to a bronze statue indicates, in a positive light, civilization and, by a negative view, pure 37. Kohl 2003.38.

In Numan Rome, as the introductory poem of the fourth book had already made clear to the reader, a “poor god” was also welcome.39 But it should be clear by now that 4.2 is not an ekphrasis; we have no idea about what the statue looked like, even after careful, repeated readings. Rather, the text is interested in an antithetical idea: the neutrality of the sign with regard to its usage (usus, 63). This is not derogatory; the statue remains an index of divinity, open to religious usage on a broad scale. Certainly, it is a sign chosen intelligently (docilem, 63).Propertius addresses the practices that appropriate such an image in individual religious activity. The votives or dedications (or, more broadly speaking, objects)40 immediately accompanying prayer are the central tools of these practices. The text concentrates on rituals involving a statue in a small, open sanctuary, but Propertius also seems to include other items: movable statuettes or paintings installed elsewhere. All these objects, whether directly placed on the statue, before it, or at another place, are instruments in the ritual communication of individuals with the divine as they actively construe the properties of the divine addressee. The text is not interested in the details of such practices. Unfortunately, we learn no details of how a statuette was used in court (ad lites, 29) (though magical papyri suggest a wide range of possibilities).41The individual ritual dealings with the image are very diverse appro-priations of that deity. For an observer (and, in the language of the text, for himself) the god is the result (cf. ab eventu, 48) of such appropriations. Synchronically as well as diachronically these vary widely. In their contra-dictions and contingencies a unifying concept or “essence” of a god or even a cult is hardly discernible; the sign “Vertumnus” does not resist differ-ent construals. There are no—though there should be—limits to sanction transgressions. When Vertumnus is mistaken for Bacchus and Apollo, the language of polytheism, based as it is on the selection and combination of recognizable signs called “gods,” is endangered. But there is nobody to enforce such limits; the conventions of representation and individual 39. This does not, however, mean that the poem deals with a mere second-rank god, as Luisi (2008, 416) claims.40.

If Vertumnus is given a plec-trum, he looks like Apollo and evidently is addressed in the terms of Apol-lo’s field of competence, even if he “is” not Apollo. Individual religious competence is guided, but not effectively limited, by traditional conven-tions. Propertius offers an image of Roman polytheism as lived ancient religion.42The poem analyzes the identity of god and image. On the one hand, the god claims an identity independent of situational appropriations and even of his image. He implicitly claims an identity within different mate-rial shapes, including statuettes and paintings. In the fiction of the speech, the god claims such an identity by remembering other and former im-ages. However, he remains subject to them; he is bound to concrete ap-propriations. Similarly, Vertumnus’s physical movements are located in the imagination of observers, where the manifestation of the “present” is extended into imagined sequences of actions. This precarious form of existence is not improved by the medium of language and the instrument of names. Clearly the text claims to be an inscription, materially present beyond the act of reading. And yet even the god’s name is open to widely different interpretations. What appears at first to be certain knowledge is later discredited as “lying rumor.” The poem does not invite its readers to search for a hidden factual or historical reference. There is no fixed system of “Etruscan” or “Roman religion” to be discovered in the ruins of fragmentary transmission, which would be able to end the game of interpretation. Instead, the text lays open the rules that bind (or rather, hardly bind) fruitful engagement with religious signs on this side of the horizon of divine. That horizon is referred to only with the phrase “father of the gods.”Propertius’s poem does not demand that we generalize its observations, but I will. The range of votives found in sanctuaries, the range of attributes and names applied to the “same” gods indicate that being “Vertumnus” was the rule rather than the exception. The text itself, at the very least, permits the following generalization: ritual action is not defined by the es-sence of the god; rather, ritual action defines that essence.42. This is not to say that Propertius protests against any reductionist public discourse, as Coutelle (2005, 571–73) claims."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Appropriating Images—Embodying Gods 61Epilogue: Embodied GodsThe argument presented above can be taken one step further. If lived an-cient religion is concerned with action and experience, we should address the question of the god’s particular experience of his own body, as Proper-tius presents it to his readers. Here, the notion of “embodiment” is of par-ticular value.Embodiment denotes the conjoining of materiality and corporeal expe-rience, and as such occupies a central position in contemporary epistemol-ogy43 and anthropology of religion. Pioneering scholarship of the twentieth century that fused phenomenology and cognitive science generated the concept of “embodied cognition” with its powerful impact on discourse on culture and religion. The concept stems from work of the French phi-losopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908–1961); his phenomenology-driven musings on embodiment advocate the crucial priority of movement and gestures over mind, and the principal role of the body in perceiving envi-ronments and structuring the world. The performance of gestures, though they do not cover the whole range of bodily experiences, contextualizes natural entities and their bodies by conveying mental dispositions and en-acting emotions, and shapes culturally informed meanings. The human body, along with the conditions of perception it entails, is what nuances subjectivity and places the individual self within culture and society, thus rendering it an “embodied self.”44 The notion of an “embodied agency” grounded in diverse somatized impulses discloses the social implications of the embodied self.45 Particularly intriguing here is the extent of alterity issuing from individual operations of embodiment, that is, the set of differ-entiating, even self-defining processes that are activated by the emotional and gestural modes of an individual’s body.46 Recent theoretical work on the anthropology of religion has gone so far as to identify in embodied alterity the “phenomenological kernel of religion,” itself a correlate of in-dividual experience, perception, and expression.4743.

The concept of embodiment has shifted the investigations of religious studies to individual involvement and meaning beyond the cognitive level, and has identified new evidence even in histori-cal studies.49 With regard to communication with invisible gods or spiri-tual beings in antiquity, ordinary religious action is much more frequently encoded in bodily movements. Given that memory is inextricably inter-twined with sensorial mechanisms, emotions produced by sensory input in diverse social contexts are embedded in bodily experience. Thus, religious experience was stimulated by and registered in the form of sensations and movements as well as in postures assumed, for instance, in prayer or in processions, and religious experience is shared by the intersubjective co-ordination of bodily movements and reactions. Religious practices in the epoch under analysis were only rarely taught through formal religious in-struction. It was much more frequently the case that knowledge of these was acquired through appropriation and imitation of movements that were stored in and enhanced by memory. Thus images of rituals or gods in cor-responding gestures could evoke embodied knowledge.50 Paraphernalia, including garments, wreaths, incense, and amulets, alter bodily status (with gender variances that demand attention) for an extended period of time.The identity of Propertius’s Vertumnus is almost totally defined by bodily experiences: from being clothed, to his memory of different actions, involving manual touch and movements, to the experience of being worked on by sickle or being cast in metal. This is significant within a larger poetic text that gives prominence to emotions, visions, bodily experience such as hunger and thirst, temperature, and colors. My final claim is that Proper-tius reflects here not only on actual religious practices but also on human experience through the lens of religion. In defining the god through the addition of dedications one must reflect upon one’s own identity, or rather, one must reflect on one’s alterity with regard to others, as defined through 48.

It is the god Vertumnus who, furthermore, also offers the possibility to reflect both on the contingency of such experience as well as on the lasting effects of certain bodily experiences, the constraints produced by them. His memory of time immemorial makes him greater than human. At the same time, in his wooden or bronze form he is much more constrained than his human observers.I must stop here; I am treading on difficult methodological ground. I might plausibly claim that Propertius does present such reflections, but I can hardly assert that these characterize the experience of every, or even any, person discharging a vow or simply praying to the statue.

We find confirmation of do-mestic or even nearly invisible religious practice in the same period of the latter half of the first century BC if, as mentioned in the previous chapter, we take into account the evidence for and the discourse on magic. Research on magic in the Greco-Roman world is a growing field, and it has become increasingly apparent that magic was not a phenomenon restricted to the social and spatial margins of the Roman Empire—to Egypt, or to the poor, for example—but that it permeated all levels of society and was fully a part of what is useful to address as “religion” in antiquity.1 This is true regard-less of the clear differences between the professional magic of Egyptian pa-pyri and the popular traditions with their individual appropriations in the (not only Latin) West.

Within the frame-work of this book my investigation does not concern the details of magic, its techniques and materials, but the position that magic occupied within the range of religious options available to individuals in the Greco-Roman world. Under what circumstances did individuals have recourse to magi-cal practices and specialists of magic? How did they frame this recourse? Did they feel a need to justify it, or did magic simply enlarge the range of options available for individual action?For the most part, my approach to these questions will be strictly philo-logical and historical. Starting from the terms and phenomena we tend to designate as “magic,” I am interested in historicizing magic, that is, in in-vestigating the theoretical concepts and pragmatics associated with magic in a specific society and period. I am interested in the “user perspective” of magic as an individual option in early Augustan Rome. As my approach is qualitative rather than quantitative, a single intelligent member of Roman society who is aware of the surrounding world will comprise sufficient material for study. Possible generalizations will be discussed toward the end of the chapter.Roman Poetry as Evidence for Ancient MagicFor evidence, I will draw on longer and more complex texts than the usual curse tablets; I again turn to Propertius and his four books of elegy. 2.

As discussed in the previous chapter, his poetic produc-tion continued until ca. 16 BC, when his last (fourth) book was finished and probably published. Thus he was a contemporary of the elegist Tibul-lus and of the epic and bucolic poet Vergil, both of whom died shortly be-fore Propertius completed his fourth book, and of the lyric and iambic poet Horace, who died shortly thereafter. The theme of magic appears in var-ious contexts in the poetry of all four of these authors. In some instances, characters in poems have quite extensive recourse to magic.Georg Luck and Anne-Marie Tupet have dealt thoroughly with the de-scriptions of magic practices in these and other texts.4 Whereas the research of the 1960s and 1970s was directed toward compiling examples of magical practices and understanding the techniques and logic of these, more recent philological treatments have concentrated on the poetic function of the passages concerned with magic—how a reference to magic, for example, may serve as a metaphor for the binding qualities of love in relationships, or how the formulation of claims and expressions of skepticism regarding magical practices are informed by the techniques of rhetoric.5 In these dis-cussions, however, the magic per se is usually heavily downplayed.6Other work on ancient magic has been engaged in historicizing the cultural techniques classified by this ancient term. There is unambigu-ous evidence from as early as the sixth century BC for practices of bind-ing (katadeín, defixiones) in different social relationships, in particular in the context of lawsuits. Likewise, examples of erotic magic can be found from the fifth century onward. Hellenistic literature offered full-fledged literary models of erotic magic and witches: Apollonius of Rhodes’s Ar-gonautica gives a detailed account of Medea in books 3 and 4, and The-ocritus’s Idyll 2 portrays a young woman engaged in magical incantations and rituals directed toward her former lover.7 Thus, from the third 4.

Agrippa had astrologers and sorcerers driven out of the city in 33 BC; Au-gustus banned the sorcerer Anaxilaos of Larissa in 28 BC.12 Against this background, the case for historic reference versus the purely literary value of poetic descriptions need not to be argued solely on the analogy of smoke and fire: much talk, therefore real magic.13 Obviously, poetic treatments constituted part of a wider public discourse that was engaged in cultivating a negative image of professional practitioners of magic.14The image of the old, drunk, and savagely cruel witch, so prominently developed in the early Augustan love poems, seems to be an innovation in the ancient discourse about magic.15 Given the growing danger of crimi-nalization, as pointed out by Richard Gordon, the poets would not have had much interest in denying the fictitious character of their magic figures.

Hope-lessness (and the cautionary advice that results from it) informs the end of the poem. This is a final commentary on the vain—as we see—appeal to unspeci-fied magic specialists in lines 19 and following. At and en agedum clearly mark addresses or exhortations,22 and these words also introduce the speech Proper-tius directs first to his friends and then to a generalized audience—addresses that do not include the gods, as should be noted.

The specialists are fully credited with having (quibus est) a trick that makes the moon appear to be forced down and with the practice of painstaking, i.e., elaborate, ritu-als (labor).24 They claim to be able to alter the movement of water and light with Colchian (likely a reference to Medea)25 formulas or songs, but this claim needs proof.

The absence of ritual detail is in keeping with the lack of any indicator regarding the status, age, or sex of the specialists invoked.Until this point I have not commented on the phrase in magicis sacra piare focis (line 20). Commentaries26 are quick to point out that sacra must be an internal accusative, meaning “to perform rituals,” “a purificatory sacrifice,”27 or to emend the phrase. But the former would be unparalleled28 and does not account for the juxtaposition of magicis and sacra at the center of the line. To expiate something always means to alter its status, either to cleanse an object or person from defilement or to undo an illegal or impi-ous action. Sacra piare is an unmitigated paradox. Semantically it implies an opposition between magic and sacred ritual,29 syntactically an alteration of sacred ritual, and pragmatically the coexistence of sacral and magical “systems.” After all, the invocation at vos . . . en agedum follows directly on Propertius’s complaint about the god Amor’s unrelentingly negative attitude. This is not, as Margaret Hubbard claims, a formal device to bal-ance the invocation of his friends,30 but signals that he is willing to employ the last resort (without providing details or implying possible criminal ac-tion), even if he is hopeless. But finally, the only source of relief is poetry, the liberty to give vent to what anger dictates (line 28).31 This conclusion is important for all of Propertius’s poetry.Agents and PatientsMore often, the speaker is not the initiator or subject of the magic but its object, not agent but patient.

What hag has not three times three pondered my dreams? (2.4.7–10, 15–16)36Again, the poison is qualified by geographical and mythical terms, not by any specific contemporary practitioners, such as those Propertius openly designates in the last verses quoted. The same observation can be made of 3.6.25–30, which describes the details of a magic attack, though the term “magic” is absent. The situation of the passage is complex:37 the speaker of the poem demands that his slave report the miseries of his (the speak-er’s) mistress and fantasizes that she complains about his infidelity. Thus he imagines her words, as she speculates on his reasons for abandoning her and as she disparages the female rival she supposes:non me moribus illa, sed herbis improba vicitstaminea rhombi ducitur ille rota.35. This correction is supportable (see also Papanghelis 1987, 33), but Tupet’s arguments for preserving the manuscript tradition with per Medeae (Tupet 1976, 358–59) are not without force. The decision has no consequences for my purposes.36. I do not follow the interposition of vv. 15–16 after 8 proposed by Birt and followed by Fedeli 2005, 165. The reasoning offered by the latter is revealing: “La trasposizione . . . appare necessaria perchè illogica sarebbe la loro collocazione in un contesto in cui non si parla più delle maghe.” His argument assumes clear borders for the field of cultural practices termed “magic.” Thus the modern observer excludes what he considers to belong to the (modern) field of medicine. Günther (1997, 49), supposing a much damaged book 2, hypothesizes that the original positions of 9–10 and 15–16 have been lost.37.

He is drawn to her by the monstrous charms of the swelling bramble-toad and by the bones she has gathered from dried serpents, by the owl-feathers found on low-lying tombs, and the woolen fillet bound about the [wax fig-ure of the] doomed man.38Here, the imagined complaint is very precise and descends even to details of ritual activities.39 The initiator of this attack is identified, but the ques-tion of whether ritual specialists are involved or not is left open. Inter-estingly enough, the term “herbs” (herbis) introduces and generalizes the nonherbal ingredients of the ritual practices. As stated above, I do not aim to contribute to the reconstruction of rites and their logic—detailed here in an interesting selection of standard practices, starting with the swirling “magic wheel.” It is clear both from the text quoted and from the follow-ing lines that these practices achieve a single end: the victim is sexually at-tracted to the woman who has instigated these practices.Funestus hints at the devastating consequences of such an attraction, but it does not activate the association of herbs with poison that is so promi-nent in the passages quoted previously. As in the case of Odysseus as vic-tim to Circe’s enchantments, the application of herbs need not have deadly consequences.40The insights gained so far can help resolve an interpretative problem in another poem, which in turn will illuminate the final passage I will 38.

Her illness is so serious that a (never-named) human addressee is exhorted to be prepared for death or for a last-minute reversal (2.28.32), and the speaker contemplates, as a final resort, the simultaneous deaths of himself and his beloved (2.28.39–42).44 Interposed is a statement about the conclusion of magical activities and the appearance of ominous sounds (35–38):deficiunt magico torti sub carmine rhombi,et tacet45 exstincto laurus adusta foco;et iam Luna negat totiens descendere caelo,nigraque funestum concinit omen avis.Now cease the wheels whirled to the magic chant, the altar fire is dead and the laurel remains quiet in the ashes. Now the moon refuses to descend so oft from heaven, and the bird of night sings ominous of death.As the immediately following verses stress the unity of the lovers, the verses quoted cannot point to the dissolution of the magic that had caused the speaker’s attraction to the beloved. Rather, it must refer to a magical rit-ual on the part of, or on behalf of, this woman in order to attract some third party.46 This would fit with the statement that now even Juno, who protects conjugal bonds, pities her (33–34).47 The pragmatic content of the verses 41.

It is, however, more or less followed by Fedeli 2005, who interprets the end of the wheel’s spinning as an omen (800).47. Verses 33–34 are frequently transposed; Günther (1997, 22–24) rightly preserves the con-tinuity of verses 33–46, but transposes them after l. 2, bringing 28a (as a separate poem) to an end with l. 32."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"76 Chapter 4would be: “Your infidelity toward me has also ceased.” This would give a new aspect to her beauty, earlier identified as rousing the gods’ envy (10). And it would also prepare the reader for the pun of the final line,48 demand-ing that the woman not only pay Isis with vigils, but also dedicate ten nights of lovemaking to the speaker as votive offering: “I’ll leave Rome, the place of sexual distractions” (as shown in 2.19 and there stressed by reference to sacrifices to Diana) “I’ll end my sexual relationship with the other man by keeping celibate vigils for Isis, and I dedicate ten nights to you.” This is the invalid’s votive formula that underlies the structure of the poem.49For our purposes, it is important to observe that there is no indication of the magical agent: Propertius evades the question of true agency by assign-ing it to inanimates (as subjects of the cessative verbs: deficient, tacet, negat descendere). Only in the final line of the excerpt is the grammatical subject identical with the pragmatic subject: the bird, whose singing illustrates the shift away from the topic of magic practices. The beloved is only implicitly responsible for this binding, but not physically harmful, magic.Piety or Poison?As a whole, the more explicit and longer treatments of magical practices are framed by references or addresses to deities. In 2.28 the plea for the be-loved’s life is framed entirely as a communication with named deities. In 3.24 and 25 (which, following Heyworth’s reconstruction of the hyparche-type Π, I take together as a single poem), the dissolution of the bonds of love could not be produced by friends or a “Thessalian witch” (saga), but only by a deity such as Bona Mens (19–20). In book 4, it is Venus whom Propertius thanks for the death of a procuress who practiced magic (4.5). As we have seen in our analysis of 1.1, there is an opposition between mag-ical and sacred ritual. Finally, in 2.28 the speaker opposes his own sacrum carmen to the magicum carmen that has ceased (43 vs. 35).

After all, Propertius had another resort: poetry.We need not dwell on the rhetorical qualities of magic in reading Prop-ertius.50 In the first poem of book 1 and the last poem of book 3, he clearly states his conviction that the creation and singing of poems is a technique superior to magic:has tibi fatalis cecinit mea pagina diras:eventum formae disce timere tuae!Such curses fraught with doom are the burden of my song for thee: learn to dread the end that awaits thy beauty! (3.25.17–18 = 3.24.37–38)These are the last two lines of book 3, and they deliberately deploy the lan-guage of curses to put an end to his love for Cynthia.51How, in conclusion, should we move from literary to historical consider-ations? Of course, the texts we have discussed offer no hard evidence of ac-tual magic practices. They are part of a contemporary discourse on magic, a discourse that addressed both transregional and local features. I propose that we reflect on the pragmatics, the application of magic as imagined by the poet within that discourse. To this end, we should first recall the delib-erately public stance of his poems, in particular those that introduce or ter-minate books.52 Magic is an important—albeit not predominant—theme.Propertius presupposes a set of techniques, characterized by their high degree of ritualization, e.g., by the use of instruments or ingredients that do not appear in common or daily praxis. These are termed “magic” and they are clearly distinguished from—and placed in semantic opposition to—the realm of the gods and such practices as are termed “sacred.” This separa-tion is not born out by the evidence, which shows that gods were invoked in spells and that the continuum of verbal and visual devices in common rit-ual use ranged from spells to amulets such as gems.53 Propertius, however, 50.

Such magical techniques as he mentions seem to have been readily available, but the group of pos-sible activities so defined is relatively limited; in the texts analyzed above, cursing is not mentioned as a magical practice, though we can compare it both with magic and with communication with the gods in the form of vows or sacrifices.In Propertius’s view, magical practices are genealogically, that is myth-ologically, related to the malicious use of poisons.54 This aspect of magic is not a part of ordinary use; it is illustrated by mythical examples and is as-sociated with far-distant mythical landscapes (Colchis, Thessaly). The use of magical herbs and instruments, unlike that of poisons, is not criminal, but confusion between the two is possible—and Propertius is always care-ful to keep this in mind. This should be interpreted as a commentary on contemporary, even legal, discourse: crimes might be punished, but this does not concern ordinary magic.Only in his last book does Propertius clearly attribute magical knowl-edge and practices to a concrete (even if fictitious) person. The procuress of 4.5 is, however, a variously qualified specialist in love, and she is not reduced to a magician only.55 In terms of agency, the status of the client or initiator and that of the specialist or contractor remains unspecified. Propertius does not participate in the creation of the Roman gothic image of the sorceress, which Daniel Ogden defines as a feature of Roman texts in general.56Much clearer is the role of the object of magic: the victim is struck pre-cisely; he or she suspects but does not know, and cannot defend himself or herself regardless of the attacker’s apparent inferiority (in terms of gender, status, and morals).Magic—as one could conclude this short review of the Propertian lit-erary representation—is potentially ubiquitous. Its presence is identified by behaviors or turns of events that are contrary to social expectation. Of course, the peripheral, even illegitimate sexual relationships, including prostitution, that are the frequent topics of Propertius’s poetry, are much 54. As clearly expressed in the term toxica (1.5.6); see Tupet 1976, 352–53.55. The accusation of verses 5–20 is not borne out by the advice Acanthis offers to the girl.

Ogden 2008."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Testing the Limits of Ritual Choices 79less effectively regulated by social sanctions and expectations. However, Propertius is not interested in creating a specific subcategory of “erotic magic” as opposed to anything else. Despite the limited nature of the evi-dence, I will attempt a summary. For Propertius, magic is neither anti-social nor the “religion of the others.” The aims of magical practices might be reached by other techniques of sacralization, but magic is as legitimately open to him as it is to others.57 However, the ingestion of potions is (accord-ing to the dominant sensualistic Roman worldview) the most plausible ex-planation for magic’s effects, and this is uncomfortably close to the crime of poisoning. One must, therefore, be wary of admitting responsibility for such magic, or of naming one’s contractors. Believing, practicing, remain-ing silent—these are exactly the conditions that are valid for all imperial practitioners and specialists of magic.58For lived ancient religion, magic is an option. Given the existence of many alternatives (good manners, prayer and votives, poetry, and curses), it has an expressive value, often taking on the character of a last resort:59 “I am fed up with how things normally work in the social and cultural patterns dominating daily life. Thus, I have recourse to the powers of na-ture and their specialists.” As a consequence, speaking about the use of magic is something that is usually done with polemical reference to others rather than in self-description. By contrast, votives and literary curses are public, or at least tend to be.60 The former, too, are highly expressive, and they were selected with a view to specific situations and circumstances, as the previous chapter has shown. Struggling with social order and con-vention, with the preferences and dislikes of others, with changing moods and circumstances, the Propertian individual tests the limits of his abil-ity to change or adapt to an ultimately uncontrollable environment. For this purpose, he needs and develops the full range of available cultural re-sources. Magic included.57. See, e.g., the list in Luck 2000, 204.58. Gordon 2013.59. Hübner 2008, 337.60.

Working with the paradigm of civic religion, scholars have been content to identify the traces of religious tradition, shared social meaning, and ritual precepts—all well-researched areas of religious practices and beliefs in the ancient circum-Mediterranean world. However, new tools in dealing with evidence of a past culture are needed if we are to investigate individual appropriation of tradition, per-sonal experiences and responses, the incoherencies of situational interpre-tation, isolated performances, and local and group-specific styles. If our interest extends beyond listing the myriad documents of individual perfor-mance consisting of votives, inscriptions, anonymous depositional remains (all of which are deeply shaped by their usually formulaic and stereotypical character), the question of evidence becomes crucial. How can we identify individual appropriation and transformation, or the creative reassembling and consequent individual selections of elements of a tradition? How can"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Reconstructing Religious Experience 81we evaluate the impact of such individual modifications on the resulting shape of seemingly stable “traditions”? How can we elucidate the interde-pendencies of the individual and the social in specific situations?1Individual religious practice is contingent on both the intellectual and the embodied availability of traditions, and on their situational salience. Religious traditions include complex belief systems as well as simple sequences of rit-ual action, and it is, therefore, necessarily the case that learning and memory are involved in processes of individual appropriation. These are processes of acquiring knowledge through formal training or repetition, through casual exchange, and through need-driven inquiry.2 Attention to these modes of ac-quisition is a necessary element of any historic reconstruction.By the late republican and early Augustan period, a small minority of Romans were literate and had access to private copies of texts and the first public libraries, or were of such means and/or status that they were invited to recitals. To these individuals there were available, from the mid-first century onward, texts on religion, rich in ritual and theological detail.3 These texts, when extant, have for centuries been used as the principal sources for the reconstruction of “Roman religion.” Occasionally (and more intensively in recent years) they have been identified as offering a glimpse into the intellectual concerns and the cognitive dimension of late republican and early imperial religion. They have come to be regarded as theological enterprises in their own right, establishing their authors as fig-ures of religio-historical importance equal to that of the holders of public priesthoods.4 Following on my analyses of Propertius’s poetic texts in the two previous chapters, I will again demonstrate that analysis of such texts can also yield solutions to the methodological problems associated with the investigation of lived ancient religion. Here, I am specifically interested in how these texts might illuminate their users rather than their producers, their usage rather than their production.1.

Reader response criticism has suggested different approaches to this task, particularly in the last third of the twentieth century.7The act of reading is a complex process. It confronts a reader’s pre-conceptions and expectations with a text that confirms or frustrates such expectations, and that offers a sequence of representations and metarepre-sentations (that is, representations of others’ representations), information, and judgments; it is only in extreme cases, such as magical papyri or Dada-ism, that the text offers little more than sounds or images. Reading per-petually forces readers—and for antiquity we must imagine hearers more often than readers—to recalibrate their appraisal of the text.8 In addition to the perhaps various voices of explicit (i.e., narrated) or implicit narra-tors, the text might also offer perspectives that serve as models or alterna-tives of reception, so-called narrated readers (or, as I stress, hearers). The text might also construe an intended audience as a person of a certain age, gender, social identity, or intellectual interest. Often, this might even be an ideal reader with all the competences necessary to fully grasp the text. The text as a whole, that is, as a sum of its challenges to connect its disparate parts and to combine its different perspectives, would, according to Wolf-gang Iser, produce an “implicit” or “implied reader.”95.

To avoid the circularity in argumentation that comes with the presumption of desired implications, my analysis will concentrate on explicitly narrated figures.

This book was largely composed between AD 2 and 8, and may have been almost complete as early as AD 4, about a gen-eration after Propertius.17 Again, the audience for this text must be sought among the Roman elite. This is true despite the diverse critical voices dis-cernible in several late republican and early Augustan texts, from Catul-lus and Vergil to Horace and Propertius. It was in the communicative and social space of the elite that such poetry was instrumental. These texts “became part of the Romans’ social equipment and came to inform their view of the world,” as Sander Goldberg has shown in his study on repub-lican Roman literature.18 Religious practices, institutions, and history also played a substantial role in this view of the world.19Ovid’s six books, covering the months of January to June, are, together with Propertius’s fourth book of elegies (to which Ovid reacts)20 the apogee of such “authoritative” poetry in the early principate. These texts are part of the cultural revolution that Andrew Wallace-Hadrill has demonstrated to be at the heart of the Augustan “restoration.”21 Accordingly, they were highly political statements.22 From a broader perspective, however, the com-position of these texts on Roman religion was also a part of the process of in-sular rationalization, which took place from the third century BC onward, and which—at least for religion—came to a halt in the Augustan era.23Ovid’s elegiac poems on an epic scale are particularly fruitful material for investigations of audience and narrator construction. The homodi-egetic narrator (Genette’s terminology for the narrator fully embedded in the principal narration)24 is not omniscient, but is himself frequently in 17.

As Joy Littlewood puts it, “Audience involvement is essential to Ovid’s Fasti narrative, which is a personal exchange with liter-ary Rome, the educated elite.” The short, self-contained units of elegiac distiches are especially suitable to “colloquial dialogue.”25 Furthermore, the elaborate dedication of the Libri fastorum to Augustus in the first ver-sion (probably transposed to the dedicatory opening of the second book, on February, in the final version)26 and the dedication to Germanicus in the second and final version (written from exile, AD 8–17) obviously call for the active appropriation of every single reader. Not only do these lines argue directly and forcefully for the importance of the poems’ contents to the individual dedicatees and their supporters, but they also demand that all readers consider their importance more generally. Time and again these “connected readers” are directly addressed. The opening of the sixth book provides an example:Hic quoque mensis habet dubias in nomine causas:quae placeat, positis omnibus ipse leges. (6.1–2)27This month, too, has dubious causes for its name.All will be listed. Pick the one you like.28The form of literary communication found in the Libri fastorum is a feature of antiquarian literature that had been developing at Rome since the second century BC. In the face of imperial expansion and rapid social and cultural change, antiquarian descriptions and systematizations of Roman ritu-als and institutions offered a way to construe a particular cultural identity beyond military dominance; it also offered a way to negotiate change and tradition. Augustus exploited this fully; innovations could, through such literature, be rooted in a vision of religious continuity and reaffirmation.29 25.

Cultural identity invested in a remote past becomes not so much a program as an alibi.”30But there is more to it. It is my contention that description and prescrip-tion went hand in hand in this discourse. By tapping into different local, social, and even ethnic traditions, antiquarianism offered not only a fuller account of a common cultural heritage, but also a broad range of religious resources, practices, and beliefs for individual appropriation. This detailed and colorful image of religion does more than serve the narrow ideologi-cal function of providing identity for contemporaries; for us, it offers a glimpse into “lived ancient religion,” even if it is difficult or even impos-sible to determine in every particular instance whether we are dealing with actual or merely imagined lived religion. In the latter case, given the com-municative and social context of this type of imagination, it is, at the very least, an imagination closely controlled by contemporaries. This holds true for the information that is supplied about religious practices as much as it does for that which is implied about a connected reader’s interest in these practices. Whereas previous research, with its interest in religious institu-tions, has concentrated on the former, this analysis, which aims to investi-gate lived religion, will concentrate on the latter.Ovid did not invent a Roman calendar of festivals. His commentary is a reaction to a series of calendar reforms that started with the technical reform of the dictator Caesar, and that changed an age-old instrument of daily use, rendering it a prominent tool of political and dynastic propa-ganda. First found in the form of a large marble calendar in the sanctuary of the reformed priesthood of the Arval Brethren shortly after the battle of Actium, publicly displayed Roman fasti were quickly produced, proliferat-ing in Rome as well as in central Italy and occasionally beyond.31 Augustus used the calendar to represent his own achievements in the form of ex-tended festival annotations, creating heightened awareness of the included rituals, an awareness that extended far beyond the actual participants. In turn, the local elites even of small villages, magistrates, and slave collegia were able both to display their loyalty by copying these calendars and to 30. Wallace-Hadrill 2008, 239.31.

Ovid em-braced this necessity as a creative challenge.33Before any further details are addressed, the implications even of the generic identification of the poem, not only as a didactic text but also as a commentary, must be pointed out. The poem functions only if the con-nected reader is using a personal copy of the calendar to actively follow the chronology. The poem assumes that the reader does this, and it is a re-quirement without which it would be hard, at times impossible, to under-stand the text.34 The locus classicus is Ov. Fast. 5.727–28: “The next place comes with four marks, which, read in order, / denote a sacred rite or the king’s flight.” The connected reader is, therefore, very active.35 The abbre-viations, brief notes, and names that are found on the calendar itself are the primary prompts for questions (and at times answers). Ovid introduced treatments of the rising and setting of constellations, thus necessitating other devices, “parapegmata,”36 and requiring an even more active reader. Here, we find implicit in Ovid’s treatment a criticism of contemporary calendars in the face of the growing popularity of astrology; according to his model, important astronomic data ought to be integrated into the fasti. This initiative was later adopted by popular forms of domestic calendars found throughout the Roman Empire.37In terms of reader construction, the Libri fastorum’s main feature is the directly apostrophized reader in the second-person singular. This was a well-known technique for involving readers (or listeners), relinquishing the magisterial authority of the omniscient narrator to exert a subtler influence over readers’ interests. In Ovid, the narrator’s questions are attributed to the narrated reader, as if the narrator’s answers are prompted by the interjections 32. Rüpke 1997a, 1997b; Wallace-Hadrill 2008, 246.33. Rüpke 1994; see also Rüpke 2009d.34. The arbitrary and incomplete introduction of some calendar indications in our editions since Rudolf Merkel’s editio maior of the nineteenth century has obscured this fact.35.

The questions raised by the narrated reader are identical to those raised by the narrator, who asks these questions and either simply answers them, or addresses them to more knowledgeable entities, sometimes human, but more often the deities concerned or the Muses.Posing such questions was normally an honorable enterprise, but it can also have its risks, as is illustrated by the example of Ino. On her arrival in Italy, Ino shows an inquisitive attitude—like the narrator of the Librorum fasti. Her inquiry into the race of the Maenads (6.505) is not very well re-ceived; Saturnian Juno stirs up the Maenads by suggesting: “She is a spy and aims to learn our sacred rites” (6.511). Clearly Juno prepares for Ino a fate parallel to that of Pentheus.38 And yet the phrasing of Ino’s questions, as well as the forcefully critical characterization of Juno as insidiosa (6.508), suggest that Ovid is well aware of parallel situations of inquiry. His read-ers, too, might have known that this inquisitive author was, by the time of the publication, himself exiled—for whatever reason. Finally, stories about Soranus, who was allegedly executed for pronouncing the secret name of the tutelary deity of Rome, might already have been in circulation.39Question and answer is the basic mode of discourse. It is usually a single narrator or reader who poses questions. The verb “to ask,” quaerere, occurs twenty-nine times, but interestingly, only five times in the plural, quaeri-tis.40 Cur, “why?” is the quintessential question, found forty-five times in the poem. Similarly inquired after are origins (origines, eleven times) and causes (causa/causae, ninety-one times). The distribution over the books is fairly even in all cases. Answers may be supplied even in the absence of explicit questions: in response to nothing more than the narrator’s tacit as-tonishment, an old woman gives the “cause” for her naked feet (6.415). In the following, I concentrate on examples taken from book 6. I aim to offer an argument that combines economy with a careful contextual reading: I will select representative examples while attending closely to the image of the connected reader as it is drawn within the framework of a typical unit of reception.38. Thus Littlewood 2006, 161.39. The incident occurred in the early first century BC; its earliest attestations are Plin. NH 3.65 and Plut. Quaest. Rom. 61.40.

Aetiological myths are woven into the exchange of questions and answers. Religion is subject to interro-gation, and it is not priestly lore but historical research that provides an-swers.41 The religious data to be explained are frequently names. These names, however, are visual data; they are suggested only by being seen in the calendar, which in itself represents visible cult. Other explananda also present themselves visually: temples are prominently seen or “looking out,”42 and occasionally statues or ritual procedures force themselves into the narrator’s field of vision.If narrator and connected reader share an interest in visual data, vision also marks a decisive difference between the two. Visual epiphanies are a privilege of the narrator. Surprisingly, this fact empowers the inscribed reader as much as it does the narrator. The narrator fully expects the reader to doubt the au-thenticity of his visions, as a few lines at the opening of book 6 make clear:facta canam? sed erunt qui me finxisse loquanturnullaque mortali numina visa putent.est deus in nobis? agitante calescimus illo; 5impetus hic sacrae semina mentis habet.fas mihi praecipue voltus vidisse deorum,vel quia sum vates, vel quia sacra cano.I will sing facts, but some will call them fictionand think no gods appear to mortal men.There is a god inside us; his movement makes us glow,His power owns the seeds of sacred thought.For me above all it’s lawful to see a god’s face,Since I’m a poet or sing sacred themes. (6.3–8)Such visions are a continuous source of knowledge. It is, however, a knowl-edge that is questionable and at times contested. The concept of “vision” is 41.

This particular form of poetic knowledge supple-ments the type of information that is generically attributed to “old annals” in two prefatory remarks.43 Occasionally (ten times throughout the poem) the narrator “remembers” (memini, commemini) what he has seen or even learned (didici) earlier, and in one passage of book 6 this knowledge is even stated to have been acquired in his “childhood years” (6.417). Knowledge in religious matters is learnable.An interest in knowledge is attributed to the connected reader: e nostro carmine certus eris—“from my song you will gain certain knowledge” is the promise made by the narrator when he talks about obscure Carna (6.104). (I again take my example from book 6, which is representative in these re-spects.) Such gods as are known with certainty constitute a discrete category in Varro’s classification of gods (di certi). Religious data could, therefore, be subject to ignorance or error; the narrator both acknowledges that this is possible (6.255, 295) and aims to protect his readers from incorrect beliefs.44In some instances, knowledge will suggest the course of future actions. For example, Ovid offers information about the character of days, whether they are better (melius) suited to marriage or warfare (6.221–22, 769), or whether they are characterized by meteorological conditions beneficial to sailing (6.715; similarly 2.453 and 4.625). With regard to religious activities, superior knowledge seems not to have had any consequences. About Semo Sancus Dius Fidius and the names to be used in his cult the narrator learns from Semo Pater that “whichever of them you choose, I’ll have the tribute” (6.215).45 The long discourse on the reason why the statue in Fortuna’s temple—identified as Servius Tullius—is covered by togas remains without consequence, as the matrons are exhorted to not touch the heap of textiles (6.621).46Such exhortations to perform cult are extremely rare. Religion as lived in Ovid is not characterized by the accurate reproduction of scripted ritu-als. The connected reader is not admonished to fulfill ritual duties, nor 43. 1.7 and 4.11: annalibus eruta priscis.44.

The very few exceptions are, rather, admonitions to adopt the appropriate emotional tone during ritual participation. The first such instance appears with Ov-id’s treatment of Feriae Sementivae (a movable feast, treated in January), where rural peoples of various vocations and their animals are addressed (1.663–96). The entire exhortation to enjoy leisure with a festive spirit is formulated as an emotionalized prayer. The Karistia or Cara Cognatio on February 22 offers the next example (2.617–38); here, Ovid encourages the boni to dedicate incense and simple meals in a harmonious domestic ritual. The language of this passage gradually shifts from description to exhor-tation. During the Vinalia of April 23, it is appropriate that prostitutes (volgares . . . puellae) venerate Venus, a deity useful for many professions (4.865–72). As befits prostitutes, they should demand the qualities neces-sary to their profession in an insistent manner; this is made clear by the repetition of poscite. In contrast, the Quirites should celebrate Mars Ultor with solemn games in the circus, not by scenic games (5.597–98). Matrons"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"92 Chapter 5should celebrate the Matralia, because it is their very special festival, with “golden cakes” (6.475–76). The Quirites should celebrate Fors Fortuna joy-fully (laeti), and drunkenness is no cause for shame (6.775–78). The plu-rals used in these passages and the explicit indication of social groups is in sharp contrast with the usual address to a singular reader.It is interesting to observe the differences between the description of the ritual of March 15, the festival of Anna Perenna, to that of the festival of Fors Fortuna. On the surface, the two seem to be similar occasions for excessive drinking on the banks of the Tiber. However, the first instance (3.523–42) is an activity of the plebs—the narrator, and others, are clearly distanced as observers.47 Veneration of Fors Fortuna on June 24 is charac-terized as originating in the plebs, but it is the Quirites (all the people) that are instructed to take part in the merrymaking by a series of three impera-tives and two jussive subjunctives.48ite, deam laeti Fortem celebrate, Quirites;in Tiberis ripa munera regis habet.pars pede, pars etiam celeri decurrite cumba,nec pudeat potos inde redire domum.ferte coronatae iuvenum convivia lintres,multaque per medias vina bibantur aquas 680Go, celebrate with joy the goddess Fors, Quirites;The Tiber’s bank has her gift from the king.Rush on down, some on foot, some in a speedy skiff,And don’t be ashamed to return home drunk.Garland yourselves, boats, and carry parties of the young,And let wine be drunk aplenty mid-stream. (6.775–80)Here, the drunkard returning home is not an object of ridicule, dragged along by his old and drunken wife, as he was during the Anna Perenna 47. 3.539: sunt spectacula volgi; 3.541 occurrit nuper (visa est mihi digna relatu) / pompa . . .48. Other references to this festival do not permit an unambiguous identification of the partic-ipants. When Cicero contrasts the joy of the Tiberina descensio with that of a victor and triumpha-tor (Cic. Fin. 5.70) one would expect that he refers to an experience that was open to his audience. The problem, however, has never been discussed. Bömer (1958, 180–81) doubts that the rites of the Anna Perenna festival are “fester Bestandteil des öffentlichen Kultus,” but does not notice the social demarcation suggested by Ovid."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Reconstructing Religious Experience 93festival in March (senem potum pota trahebat anus, 3.542). Instead, he is a fairly reliable witness:ecce suburbana rediens male sobrius aede 785ad stellas aliquis talia verba iacit;“zona latet tua nunc, et cras fortasse latebit;dehinc erit, Orion, aspicienda mihi.”Look, a man returns from the shrine near the cityUnsober, and hurls these words to the stars:“Your belt hides now, and perhaps will hide tomorrow.After that, Orion, I shall see it.” (6.785–88)Unlike the plebs, the Quirites include the connected reader.There is an interesting movement on the part of the narrator here. At the end of book 6, the connected reader might be one who is not only intellectually interested in cult but is also reminded of his or her (women are addressed in some plural exhortations) social or, rather, political sta-tus and thereby be incited to participate actively in religious merrymak-ing. And yet, the evidence remains inconclusive. First and foremost, the audience constructed by Ovid is one that witnesses the narrator’s admo-nitions directed toward various large social groups composed of other individuals.It is only at the very close of the poem, reworked in exile to end pre-cisely where it ends, after six months (half a calendar), that the role of the observer meets that of the religious performer. Ovid’s reader is, most certainly, an embedded reader, who understands what he or she is read-ing within the historical context of the poem at large.49 This reader can decipher the author’s clues and discern the incongruity that is implied as the second voice of the inscribed narrator emerges, a voice indulgent in merrymaking ritual. The implication must be spelled out: both the im-plied narrator and the connected reader are fully present at Rome. This is written by an author who was not present and made no secret of the grief his absence caused him.49. I have taken the concept of “embedded reader” from Boyd 2006, 172 (who adapts J. J. Winkler’s analysis of Apuleius’s mysteries novel to Ovid’s Metamorphoses)."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"94 Chapter 5Antiquarians’ Connected Readers and Individual Appropriation of ReligionDoes the concept of a connected reader help us analyze ancient individual appropriation of religion? I maintain that it does. To argue this, I must sys-tematize my findings and bolster them with further evidence. We observe, on the one hand, the very specific character of Ovid’s connected readers, and on the other, the coherence of this (of course) authorial construction throughout six books of epic length (and a re-edition). These two facts present of themselves adequate arguments that we are justified in seek-ing in this text a portrait of Ovid’s addressees and their concerns—as ideal readers, or even as individuals of a specific social disposition.Ovid’s commentary on the fasti addresses the local (Roman) reader and supports his (or, as I would add in the case of Ovid, her) dominant main-stream political identity. Although this is not surprising, it is also not a necessity of antiquarian literature. Callimachus did not restrict himself to Alexandrian readers in his geographically wide-ranging Aetia.50 Proper-tius problematizes identities and involves his audience in journeys outside of Rome, for instance to Lanuvium (4.8).Ovid does not presuppose a reader who is interested in ritual details for the sake of active participation or highly specific observation. Nevertheless a wide range of ritual practices are touched on, far beyond even the neces-sities of a commentary on the Roman fasti. This holds true for the complex rite performed by the old woman for dea Tacita (2.571–82)51 as well as for the otherwise unattested rites for Vacuna (6.307–8).Ovid does construe a reader who is, above all, interested in the Why and Whence. Of course, these are questions that are welcome to the nar-rator as they offer opportunities for storytelling. But even if the answers occasionally remain inconclusive or conflicting, the reader is supposed to regard such etymological or historical knowledge as something that can be “learned” and “remembered.” Religious practice and symbols invite ques-tions and can be explained. Answers are neither forbidden nor dogmatic. The narrator is quite aware that his own answers are questionable. Expla-nation is not inimical to religion, but a part of it.5250. I am grateful to Tony Bierl for this point.51. See McDonough 2004, 357–58.52.

He or she is made aware of temples and statues and temples without statues, and of the ritual use of otherwise undistinguished space. There is, however, no hint at the private usufruct of such ritual topography.In place of a systematics of religion such as modern research frequently conceptualizes on the blueprint of Varro’s Antiquitates rerum divinarum—a functionally ordered “pantheon”—gods and temples and the attributes of days are quite often shown to be the outcome of historical contingencies and decisions. This conforms to a trend visible in other contemporary au-thors.53 Here, the narrator is interested in recent changes and the latest renovation of a temple rather than in a complete chronology. Clearly, re-ligion is presented as a field of creative action for members of the political elite, the emperor in particular.The connected reader is interested not only in major public festivals but also in domestic and local cult, even if neither annotations in the text of the fasti nor public architecture point to the latter’s existence. Such domestic and local cult, too, is regulated by the course of the year and consists of disconnected events, in any of which participation was optional. Its perfor-mance on the part of the reader is not presupposed.A specific cult is an opportunity, or even a duty for a specific social, gender, or age group. The connected reader is supposed to learn these spe-cifics, and he or she is at most indirectly admonished to join in, never with-out arguments. The most forceful exhortations concern not highly specific cult practices, but events that involve many groups, if not everybody: even animals in the case of the Feriae Sementivae, even slaves in the case of Fors Fortuna. In all these instances it is most important for the audience to have a clear understanding of the emotional tone of the cult. This holds true for the organizers of the cult as well as for any participant.Finally, it is not the modern bricoleur au religion that corresponds to the connected reader crafted by Ovid. Rather, it is an informed and sympa-thetic observer or bystander, embedded in a structured society, but free to exercise his or her own choices, knowing the possible limits of individual innovation as well as the appropriate affective regulation or deregulation when participating in traditional cult activities. Such a reader will have already reached the stage of the trained reader, able “themselves to find 53. Rüpke 2014b."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"96 Chapter 5interesting matter and understand it,” as Quintilian put it (Inst. 2.5.13). For his didactic poetry Ovid would certainly have accepted the aim that Quintilian formulated in the following sentence: “For what else are we about in teaching than ensuring that our pupils will not always require to be taught?”54Surveys, interviews, and participant observation (the methods employed in research on lived religion today)55 are not available to the study of ancient religion. There is an abundance of evidence for a limited range of indi-vidual religious activities, such as votives, tomb inscriptions, and the ma-terial remains of funerary rituals. For other types of activity, we must rely on occasional anecdotal evidence as it appears in ancient historiography or in letters. In many instances, however, we see infrastructure rather than usage, texts rather than testimonies of their reception. Here, however, the instigators of architecture or the authors of texts step in, revealing the re-actions they anticipate and focusing audience attention in direct or subtle ways. Such testimonies have been used to learn from texts what one can no longer learn about authors otherwise. But it can also be used to gather ev-idence, not elsewhere attested, about the character of the audience. In this chapter, my primary interest was not in Ovid, but in the religious practices of his contemporaries, presupposing that the text contains some insights into contemporary appropriation of religion. Through the lens of the con-nected reader (who in most cases is the inscribed, narrated hearer), Ovid’s Libri fastorum is neither the script for a complex but fixed ritual system (as the text has been usually interpreted) nor an individual’s reflection on such a system (as in more recent interpretations). Instead, it documents a field of social action, shaped and reshaped by contingent individual and group ac-tion. It documents lived ancient religion.54. Translated by D. A. Russell and M.

The essence of the innovation was the redrawing of conceptual boundaries: those ancient authors that dealt with Roman religion were no longer seen merely as observers of Roman re-ligion, but as participants; ancient exegetics9 was no longer the first link in a long chain of attempts to find the “correct” interpretation of rituals (a chain that extends to current research).10 Instead, indigenous exegesis is a fea-ture of the religious system itself, and inconsistency is a permanent trace of that system. According to Beard, North, and Price, the success of so-called Roman ritualism lies precisely in the fact that largely unchanged trans-mitted rituals were open to ever new and up-to-date interpretations. They were, therefore, equally adequate within very different social situations.11Rather than simply appending literary discourse to the idea of a rather static civic religion and its rituals,12 the perspective of lived ancient reli-gion developed here is interested in such discourse in terms of its power to produce religious “traditions” and to mediate between traditions and individual appropriation.13 Thus, the reevaluation of ancient interpreta-tions can lead to a more complex understanding of rituals, overcoming the division between ritual (as traditional, stereotyped, senseless action) on one hand and exegesis (the contextually adjusted, noncommittal, and intellec-tual attribution of meaning) on the other.

Individual feelings and social expectations were communicated. Standard meanings were reproduced or modified. Writing, that is literature, might have been part of the performance. In Rome, as in Greece, it was exactly rituals that were the frame for important types of literary communication. This applies especially to the games (ludi), the number of which exploded in the third and second centuries BC. “Scenic games” (ludi scaenici) supplied a venue for drama, tragedy as well as com-edy, and integrated these forms into ongoing societal communication.15 Insofar as identifiable texts are concerned, this process marked the begin-ning of a Latin literature;16 through the evidence of images on vases we are able to discern the long prehistory of dramatic genres in ritual—especially Dionysiac—contexts, reaching at least as far back as the fourth century BC.17Both larger dramatic texts as well as prayer formulations and hymns composed for individual recital are among the most flexible and hence most communicative elements of a ritual’s performance.18 Texts, however, are not only a part of the actual performance but also a part of its context, part of the performer’s and audience’s knowledge. Communication about ritual performances can be a determining factor in the interpretation and modification of a ritual action, and an individual performance cannot be analyzed in isolation from communication about previous performances or about the norms of the ritual. The existence of a written script for the performance of the ritual is but one possible component in the commu-nicative mechanism. This is not to say that performance is a feature only of rituals; the texts associated with ritual, too, were performed, through public or private recitation.1914. See R. L. Grimes 2006.15.

Catherine Bell introduced the concept of ritualization as a means to analyze the relationship between ritual and everyday action: ritualization is con-scious modification of everyday action.20 Humphrey and Laidlaw followed her lead by demonstrating that among the West Indian Jaina, rituals are not inherently rituals but instances of individual action that become rituals only because the agent or the audience ascribes to them the quality of ritual.21 But this ascription is itself the product of the conceptual framework of the participants, a framework that is not only produced by previous ritual expe-riences but also by communication, including—even within a semiliterate society—textual communication. However, whereas Humphrey and Laid-law were interested in the contents of the communication, the resulting general attitude toward ritual, and the conceptualization of ritual, I am in-terested in the different ways tradition is communicated, innovations, and the interplay of these with individual dynamics and appropriations. That is, I am interested in the historical process of change in rituals.Dramatizing Ritual PerformanceEven the earliest preserved literary texts in Latin contain ritual descrip-tions. Ennius, for example, in one of the longest extant fragments of his historic epic the Annales, describes an auspicium performed by two augurs, the brothers Romulus and Remus, who were in competition for the lead-ership of the city yet to be founded:22Curantes magna cum cura tum cupientesregni dant operam simul auspicio augurioque.in Murco Remus auspicio sedet atque secundamsolus auem seruat. at Romulus pulcher in alto 75quaerit Aventino, seruat genus altiuolantum. 20. Bell 1992.21. Cf. Humphrey and Laidlaw 1994, where the term “ritualization” is substituted for “rit-ual,” and “ritual” is identified as a specific type of unintentional action, one for which success is defined as the realization of a supposed model for the action (Humphrey and Laidlaw 1994, 88).22.

They wait, just as when the consul is ready to give the starting signal, all eagerly look to the gates of the starting boxes, [to see] how soon he might send the cars out of the colorful mouths. In such a way the people waited with fear for the out-come on their faces, [wondering] which of the twins would be granted the victory of the great kingship.Meanwhile the moon [or “morning star”] has receded into the depths of the night. Now, shimmering daylight has appeared, struck by the beams, and at once, from very high, a magnificent and auspicious bird has flown on the left. And when golden sun rises, three times four holy bodies descend from the sky and sit down on promising and splendid places.

Here, in one of the oldest transmitted lit-erary texts of Rome, we are struck by the highly artful description: of the allegedly historical performance of a legitimizing ritual, and of a unique auspicium. The twelve vultures is a detail also found in other, less favorable variants of the narrative.24The passage is one in a long series of Roman attempts to deal with a Greek story, full of discrediting elements, about Rome’s foundation. As Jocelyn has shown,25 Ennius inserted contemporary augural practices in order to render the narrative more palatable to his Roman audience. Joc-elyn’s view is that of the literary critic, focusing on the perspective of the text’s producer. What of the perspectives of its recipients? As senators and (ex-) magistrates, they were, presumably, satisfied by this dignified story about their founders. They would also have been gratified by the liter-ary showcasing of one of their central but rather intimate practices: the practice of going out to observe birds before sunrise (infera noctis, 89) was a public, yet hardly prominent, performance.The political importance of the ritual is confirmed by the central place it holds in the story of the twins’ conflict. Emphasis, however, is placed not on structure but on performance. Personal engagement and intention are stressed: curantes magna cum cura (77), “being careful with great care” opens the passage. Jocelyn has drawn attention to the lingering obscurity of the expression auspicio se deuouet (79), a sort of magical self-sacrifice to the ritual. I use the expression “magical” deliberately: this phrase captures the utter isolation, the asocial vigil of the observer, whose political will is public, as are the technical conditions for a positive outcome of the bird watching formulated in the legum dictio,26 but not the strength of his reso-lution, which the ritual also tests. It is this feature of the ritual performance that is explicitly open to individual modification. Augury, as it is shown here, is part of the aristocratic competition that informs Roman politics and aristocratic values: certabant (82). For the listeners and readers of the 24.

Without actually asserting the presence of the citizens, all of whom are interested in the outcome (omnibus . . . viris), an audience is introduced by way of the simile: ueluti, consul cum mittere signum / uolt, omnes auidi spectant (84–85). Expecting, looking, and seeing (expectare, spectare, con-spicere) are deliberately conflated as activities of the protagonists as well as the observers, and the reader is granted a simultaneous view of both parties (stressed by the visual ore, 87). Thus the literary depiction enables the nightly auspicial certamen to be observed by a breathless multitude as if they were witnessing a race in the circus.28 The ritual practiced in solitude is transformed into a highly communicative performance.No extant sources indicate the influence of the Ennian texts on the prac-titioners of augury. However, the proliferation of the practice of tripudium, augury by chicken feeding, and its criticism (not least in the very text of Cicero that supplies our Ennius passage) demonstrate that the communi-cative aspects of the performance were central. It is by stressing the indi-vidual’s part in its performance that texts such as the Annales dramatized Roman auspicia and stabilized it against negative evaluations.Competition in the Record BookMy next example is drawn from a late ancient source, the Saturnalia of Macrobius.29 The following passage is quoted from the commentarii, the rec-ords of the priesthood of the Pontifices, and it is quite probably the most precisely identifiable quotation from priestly books: it is part of the fourth annual volume of the notes of the Pontifex Maximus Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius regarding his urban official affairs.

It seems to correspond too little to the expectations of philologists interested in the history of reli-gion.31 We find neither a close description of the inauguration nor one of the ritual constitution of the new priest performed by an augur; rather, we read of the sumptuous meal that the newly elected person offers to his col-leagues, the cena aditialis, the inaugural meal. What is happening here?The text registers those present by listing the names in a certain order. As evidenced in other texts,32 strict attention was paid to seniority, as deter-mined by the period of membership in a given college. Documenting the membership of a college and individual terms of office might have been among the most important interests of this type of text.33 Religious change and modification are not immediately apparent objects of documentation. Yet it is the instantiation of an essentially variable part of the entire ritual that is described in minute detail. The text documents a nonsynchronic, culinary competition. Priestly meals had potlatch character: they were known for ostentatious extravagance and they were the stage for such lav-ish culinary innovations as established the peacock and the moray as foods of prestige.34 Written records enabled these feasts to be publicized with a precision that rendered competition all the more fierce, and all the more worthwhile. However, the reduction of culinary luxury to the price paid for it, monetarization, so to speak, was not a desirable mode of documenta-tion; such an approach belonged not to internal communication, but rather to satirical mockery and antiquarian sensation seeking.35 To summarize my interpretation: precise documentation, especially of how the most vari-able elements of the ritual had been realized, opened an additional venue for rivalry within an aristocracy based on a competition for prestige.We know little about the use and the circulation of the commentarii of the Pontifices Maximi.36 They were not secret documents, nor were 31.

This is demonstrated by the famous tabu-lae dealbatae, the whitened wood panels, which were displayed before the house of the Pontifex Maximus. At least the abstracts of the protocols cop-ied onto these tables were addressed to a public audience, as is attested by the tradition of their supposed publication by Publius Mucius Scaevola.37 As far as the records of Metellus Pius are concerned, current or future col-leagues were also likely potential readers. (Antiquarians would constitute a further, secondary audience.) These men were at very least aware of the existence of these records. Writing raised the details of a particular ritual performance into the sphere of permanently documented ritual, which fact surely influenced the hosts of events such as cenae aditiales: competition could now be waged via a medium both more stable and more predictable than unsupported memory.The lengthy record of ritual details is exceptional in the case of the meal described above, but not isolated. Comparable examples of docu-mentation can be found for ritual performances in a very different field—performances that were, nevertheless, enacted by the same class of people. Appian’s description of the triumphal procession of Pompey closely matches the pattern of the description of the pontiffs’ meal:38 here again, it is the actual performance, the details of the procession of 63 BC that are the subject matter. By contrast, scarcely anything can be learned about what scholars usually like to conceive of as serious, invariant ritual. The similarities between the commentarii pontificum and Appian’s descrip-tion show that such a selective view of rituals was not exclusive either to antiquarian accounts or to historiography.Fictitious Rituals and Ritual PerformanceTexts do not just comment on rituals and ascribe “meaning” to them; the producers of text could also invent rituals. In doing this, they were surely di-rected by their own ritual competence39 and culturally received ideas about ritualization and the logic of ritual, but they must also have been prompted 37.

Religion, as it turns out, allowed less prominent traditional and juridical acts to be ritualized on a grand scale.The text in question is a passage in Livy’s Roman History.41 It concerns the procedure for the Roman (and, Livy imagines, typically Latin) declara-tion of war on other peoples:Legatus ubi ad fines eorum uenit unde res repetuntur, capite uelato filo— lanae uelamen est—“audi, Iuppiter” inquit; “audite, fines”—cuiuscumque gentis sunt, nominat—; “audiat fas. ego sum publicus nuntius populi Romani; iuste pieque legatus uenio, uerbisque meis fides sit.” peragit deinde postulata. inde Iouem testem facit: “si ego iniuste impieque illos homines illasque res dedier mihi exposco, tum patriae compotem me nunquam siris esse.” haec, cum fines suprascandit, haec, quicumque ei primus uir obuius fuerit, haec portam ingrediens, haec forum ingressus, paucis uerbis carminis concipiend-ique iuris iurandi mutatis, peragit. si non deduntur quos exposcit diebus tri-bus et triginta—tot enim sollemnes sunt—peractis bellum ita indicit: “audi, Iuppiter, et tu, Iane Quirine, dique omnes caelestes, uosque terrestres uosque inferni, audite; ego uos testor populum illum”—quicumque est, nominat—“iniustum esse neque ius persoluere; sed de istis rebus in patria maiores natu consulemus, quo pacto ius nostrum adipiscamur.”When the legate arrives at the frontier of those from whom restitution is de-manded, he covers his head with a fillet (the covering is of wool) and says:42 “Hear thou, Jupiter, hear ye, boundaries of ”—naming whatever nation they belong to—“let divine law hear! I am the official herald of the Roman people; I come lawfully and piously commissioned, let there be trust in my words.” Then he sets forth his demands, after which he takes Jupiter to wit-ness: “If I unjustly and impiously demand that these men and these goods be surrendered to me, then never let me be a full citizen of my fatherland.”43 He recites these words when he crosses the boundary-line, again to the first person he encounters, again when proceeding through the town-gate, and 40.

If his demands are not met, at the end of 33 days—for such is the customary number—he declares war as follows: “Hear thou, Jupiter, and thou, Janus Quirinus, and all ye heavenly gods, and ye terrestrial gods, and ye infernal gods, hear! I call you to wit-ness that this people”—naming whatever people it is—“is unjust and does not render just reparation. But regarding these matters we will consult the elders in our fatherland, how we may acquire our due.”The subsequent declaration of war (32.12–14) ends with an elaborate ritual:Fieri solitum ut fetialis hastam ferratam aut praeustam sanguineam ad fines eorum ferret et non minus tribus pueribus praesentibus diceret: “quod populi Priscorum Latinorum hominesque Prisci Latini aduersus popu-lum Romanum Quiritium fecerunt deliquerunt, quod populus Romanus Quiritium bellum cum Priscis Latinis iussit esse senatusque populi Romani Quiritium censuit consensit consciuit ut bellum cum Priscis Latinis fieret, ob eam rem ego populusque Romanus populis Priscorum Latinorum hom-inibusque Priscis Latinis bellum indico facioque.” id ubi dixisset, hastam in fines eorum emittebat. hoc tum modo ab Latinis repetitae res ac bellum in-dictum, moremque eum posteri acceperunt.The usual procedure was for the fetialis to carry to the boundary of the other nation a spear of iron or fire-hardened cornel-wood,44 and in the presence of not fewer than three adult males,45 to say: “Forasmuch as the tribes of the Ancient Latins and men of the Ancient Latins have committed act and of-fence against the Roman people, and forasmuch as the Roman people have ordained that war be declared on the Ancient Latins, and the senate of the Roman people has affirmed, agreed, and with their votes approved that there be war with the ancient Latins, I, therefore, and the Roman people, declare and make war on the tribes of the Ancient Latins and the men of the Ancient Latins.” Having said this, he would hurl the spear across their boundary.46Of course, the alleged performance of the eighth century BC is a fiction. But neither was the ritual described above ever practiced, as I have argued 44. It was considered “fact” in Augustan times that the use of iron was preceded by weapons hardened by fire.45. This was a basic rule for legitimizing witnesses in Roman legal procedures.46. Cf. Gell. NA 16.4.1 (Cincius); for the relationship between Livy and Cincius, see Rüpke 1990, 104–5."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Dynamics of Individual Appropriation 109elsewhere.47 Authorial “knowledge” of prehistory is established in the nar-rative by the integration of elements that are known from (much later) legal procedures, such as, for example, the necessary numbers of witnesses, and an intense atmosphere of ritualization is created by frequent use of repetition and symmetry.The resulting “ritual” in Livy is a fictitious one, but it did not remain in the realm of the imaginary. The dynamics of individual appropriation went far beyond literary invention. This fictitious ritual was quoted ritually, that is, it formed the basis for a remarkable historical performance: in 32 BC, Octavian in his capacity as fetial priest and by throwing a spear, declared war against the foreigner Cleopatra and thereby marked the beginning of the de-cisive phase of the civil war against his Roman rival Mark Antony.48 Ritual-ization set the tone for this conflict and its representation in the city of Rome, and it cloaked the dreadful fact of civil war in the symbolism of conflict with foreign peoples. The ritual was repeated at least one more time, in AD 178: Marcus Aurelius, in exact imitation of Augustus’s procedure, declared war on the Scythians by throwing a spear at the columna bellica near the temple of Bellona.49 The narrow time frame in which we find the earliest testimo-nies for Fetials throwing a spear—Cincius (difficult to date exactly) and Livy were both late first-century BC authors—and the Augustan ritual evince the entanglement of written text and performance. A textually circulated, fictitious ritual set the interpretive horizon for a ritual that was intended to exonerate the official war strategy of the charge of initiating civil war.The fiction in its perfection allowed for greater complexity and coher-ency than a concrete ritual. At the same time, it also radically limited the latter’s horizons of interpretation: Octavian, soon-to-be Augustus, wore a paludamentum (military cloak) when he threw the spear, thus identifying himself in fact as a soldier and situating his performance in an older tra-dition of military symbolism, which the antiquarian M. Terentius Varro had just recently presented in the treatise Calenus.50 But this “frame” 47. Rüpke 1990, 104–5. 48. Dio Cass. 50.4.4–5.49. Dio Cass. 72.33.3.

In the sanctuary complex of the priesthood of the Fratres Arvales, a few miles outside of Rome, the members of the priesthood performed their rituals alongside walls that were inscribed with the acta, the chronicles of these very rituals in previ-ous years. As I will argue, such an enormous epigraphical effort was pur-sued in this remote place in an attempt to guide individual appropriation of the priestly role.We know almost nothing about the activities or composition of the Arvales during the republican period, except that they must have existed. From this total obscuritas they emerge in the Augustan era as a high-ranking priestly group that typically seems to have counted the Augusti and their designated successors among its members.51 Nevertheless, with respect to ritual, their activities in Rome were limited to a brief sequence of games that were held annually in the city, while their regular cult was concen-trated in an area outside the town, in the grove of Dea Dia. Even today, La Magliana is the outermost border of the urban area.The complex, in operation for over three hundred years, was by no means attractive to a wider public, neither in terms of cult nor archi-tecture. It was, perhaps, even intentionally closed to the public. The construction of baths in Severan times marked the largest architectonic expansion.52 But all this is secondary to the epigraphical fact. The tran-scriptions of the records of this priesthood onto stone provide what is pos-sibly the largest coherent complex of inscriptions of the ancient Roman world.5351. Not only has John Scheid presented a new edition of the inscriptions (Scheid 1998b), but he has also made them accessible as a central source for the reconstruction of Roman religion in his monographs, prosopographies, and articles: Scheid 1990a, 1975, 1990b.

The text was produced or ed-ited directly after the event by a slave who was in charge of the records.55 At the end of each year, the entire annual record would then be transcribed onto stone. The fixing of the ritual in writing gained ritual character itself: the use of stone tools in the sanctuary—essential for producing inscriptions on marble slabs—was cause for an expiation ritual.56 Piece by piece, these texts embellished the walls of the buildings.What purpose did this serve?

Since a wide public was not expected, the necessity for a symbolic interpretation of the texts is widely agreed on.58John Scheid seeks an explanation in the ownership of the location and its architecture by the deity Dea Dia, ritually underlined by the expiation rituals (piacula), which acknowledged the presence and attention of the deity. Accordingly, Scheid regards the texts as documentation, composed for the deity’s benefit, of dutiful fulfillment of her cult.59 As such, these acta would parallel dedicatory inscriptions in other sanctuaries. However, any formula or note to this purpose is lacking. There is no documentation of success or gratitude, no praise of the goddess, no vaunting her power to new visitors as in other sanctuaries. The placement of the epigraphs, mak-ing them not part of an inner sanctuary, but a constitutive element of the ensemble, does not support this thesis either.60 The richness of detail and the exceptional abundance of the epigraphic corpus would, furthermore, remain unexplained. I would maintain, rather, that the epigraphs found not only their authors but also their primary public within the members of the priesthood itself.But to what effect would the Arvals read the inscription? From the Augustan period onward—we have no traces of earlier epigraphic culture from this site—the performance of rituals, the whole activity of the priest-hood, took place in an environment that was emphatically marked by the documentation, the scriptuality, of former performances of this ritual. The readers of the inscriptions were exactly the persons who also performed the documented acts. One cannot separate the one from the other. Once more: the records themselves are too brief to secure the invariability of rit-ual details. What they did secure was the ritual quality of new acts. These acta must have been viewed by the participants in each new ritual act, and the new act was thus defined as a repetition of strict sequences of previous 57. AA 100a. 32–38 Scheid.58.

That is, it attained the character of ritual. Thus the mere presence of the acta guaranteed a high degree of ritualization.“Repetition,” however, is valid only in a restricted way. The term needs two qualifications. First, the Acta arvalia documented different types of rituals. Each particular ritual became more narrowly defined by its differ-ences relative to other performances and became a distinct part of a com-plex and therefore demanding ritual system. Even the production of the inscription was addressed through a ritual that offered to the goddess of the grove an expiatory sacrifice to atone for the iron tools that had been brought into her domain for the purpose of chiseling letters.61The second qualification concerns exactitude of repetition. The text of the epigraph offered records of actual performances, not a timeless liturgi-cal form. Differentiation was produced by lists of names of all the partici-pants and by exact dating. Typically, it was the Arval brothers themselves that were named, but we also occasionally find minor officials listed: senato-rial boys (pueri), freedmen (kalatores) or public slaves (servi publici) of various functions, e.g., the record taker (a commentariis). It was not “the priesthood of the Arvals,” but single Arvals (or assistants) that performed the religious du-ties entrusted to this sodalitas. Only writing could preserve these distinctions over time. This interpretation is supported by the results of Mary Beard, who investigated the correlation between a decline (albeit slight) in the priest-hood’s prestige and an increase in the number of ritual details supplied; this correlation is most clearly visible in texts from the early third century.62The underlying text of the inscriptions, the commentarii of the Arvals, corresponds approximately, both in form and in institutional status, to the commentarius of the Pontifex Maximus treated above. Publication did not alter the form or content of the text, but it did have a decisive influence on its pragmatics. The formulation of individual or gentilician demands, the repetitive—that is, ritual—character of acts was not merely potentially vis-ible, but was present in the ritual space itself. No menu lists can be found in the Acta arvalia. The documentation was restricted to the presence of individuals at routine rituals and special occasions (vota) that demonstrated loyalty to the imperial dynasty. Why?61.

What is apparent instead is the affiliation with a tradition, the growth of which is measurable in terms of marble slabs covered with protocols. It is striking that over time the focus of documentation (excepting the constant details of dates and attendance) even shifts from the variable to the fixed elements of rituals. Increasingly, the extensive citation of the prayers offered on various occasions (along with the corresponding combi-nations of gods invoked and sacrificial animals) that we find from the first century gives way to the extensive and stereotypical description of ritual details of the third century AD. We can even detect more specific interests in later inscriptions. A close investigation cannot ignore, for example, the extensive treatment of purification rites in the third century, an interest that might very well have been related to other contemporary religious devel-opments.65 Despite the fact that the rituals remained constant, the written documentation reveals a shift from expressions of imperial loyalty to theur-gic concerns—and, presumably, a corresponding shift in how the partici-pants perceived their role. The quality of the performance was altered by its public documentation. Here, the slow shift in religious traditions interacted with the individual Arval’s appropriation of his religious role, while the marble letters documenting his activities guaranteed the dignity of this role. It is not fortuitous that a newly refounded, topographically marginalized priesthood produced the most extensive of all records of priestly activities.Collective Performance Replaced by Individual ReadingReading, then, informed ritual action.

This was enabled, to be exact, by the production of a graphical representation of a calendar that listed all the days of a year and organized them in a clearly structured way, in terms of months—a direct ancestor of our modern cal-endar.66 In this, Roman calendars were unique in the ancient Mediterra-nean world.The Roman calendar in the form of the fasti included a wealth of reli-gious, or, more specifically, ritual information. Days that were (by analogy to plots of land) the property of individual gods and therefore restricted for human use (feriae) were marked with names and abbreviations that could easily be associated with corresponding ceremonial rituals. Additionally, the foundation dates of temples and their anniversaries were listed, usually involving larger ceremonies in situ.67The relationship between this text and the performances needs eluci-dation. It might be surprising, but it should be remarked all the more: the relationship between the calendar and ritual is not normative. It is easy to associate the ritual, but actual ritual data form no part of the fasti. Nor should we assign to them a function comparable to that of the so-called Attic calendars of demes: the latter were simply lists of ceremonies and the particular days on which they occurred, specific to the deme concerned. They included statements of the appropriate sacrificial animals that were intended to regulate the corresponding financial duties of certain districts or persons.68 By contrast, it is the uniformity of Roman calendars that is most astonishing: the preserved inscriptions differ only in size or quality of the stone, but not in content, regardless of whether they were situated in a temple, a building of an association, or a private house. We almost never find even a hint that there was a specific cult associated with such a place.6966. For the history of the reception of the Roman calendar, see Rüpke 2006a.67. See Rüpke 2011b.

Of the approximately fifty copies that have been found (mostly in fragmentary state), almost one half are from the city of Rome, while the remainder come largely from Latium, Etruria, and Cam-pania. The only exceptions in Italy are the so-called Fasti Guidizzolenses from the region of Brixia. The southernmost example, the Fasti Tauro-menitani, belongs to the Augustan colony Tauromenium of Sicily. This is the only copy that has been found outside Italy.70We assume the primarily local character of ancient societies, yet the cer-emony list containing the fasti of Urbinum Metaurense in north Umbria is identical with the list of the fasti from Venusia. The dates mentioned are Roman dates, even in copies of obscure Italian municipalities. The inscrip-tions do not even add data regarding local or regional festivals or rituals. In all the extant copies there is only one example of such supplementation:71 Verrius Flaccus, the author of the Fasti Praenestini and an Augustan scholar, adds two local events to the list of Roman activities. This, how-ever, occurs in a calendar that is already unusual for other reasons: it is the only calendar that connects the reproduction of the Roman fasti with a continuing commentary on these fasti.The temporal distribution of the calendars is significant. The oldest Roman fasti must have been created by around 170 BC. These would have supplied the blueprint for the painted wall calendar found at Antium.72 The oldest marble version comes from the shrine of the Arvals in Rome, which might have been reorganized by Augustus around 30 BC. This calendar was created very soon after Augustus’s victory at Actium.73 Urban copies remained pre-dominant in the following period; only few calendars from Latium, Etruria, or Campania date to the Augustan period. But by the rule of Tiberius, they had spread over all of central Italy—and then proliferation ceased.The information conveyed in the calendars also parallels the expan-sion of the imperial cult.

(for instance, “this day is a day of the gods, because on this day Caesar occupied Alexandria”). Such is the pattern for many of the dates. Within a few years, this manner of registration lent the fasti a specific profile.As argued previously, such a calendar of urban, Roman dates cannot be a prescriptive text for cult in, for instance, Antium. Considering the (frequently considerable) distances between such places and Rome and the lack of precise information conveyed, it could not even have supplied use-ful information on Roman cults for travelers planning to go to Rome. The calendar is, rather, a medium for representing imperial festivities, days of victories, honors, births, and the like, irrespective of the actual location of the reader; that is to say, it is independent of performance. Reading such a text afforded awareness of a date, even on another day. In terms of the individual appropriation of an imperial and metropolitan ritual tradition by reading, it was probably not the isolated information on single days that was important, but rather, a careful or cursory reading of the complex text of the fasti in its entirety. Of course, even more significant would be the production of such a text—to pay for its engraving and to design a headline or to have further information added. This allowed individual expression of loyalty, consent, and assimilation to the Augustan system. To put it anachronistically, there was no need to participate in celebrations; it was enough to hang posters.75 The act of displaying such a calendar was the most important performance, permanently remembered by the monu-ment itself, and actualized by its reading. This opened a new perspective for imperial communication: rituals might be created in order to ensure their representation in calendars. Attempts to “occupy” and “redefine” cer-tain dates76 might have had just such a motive.74. See Herz 1978.75. See Rüpke 2011b, 124–39. For such processes of medialization, see Galinsky 1996.76.

Not only does the “record” offer us glimpses into varying contemporary views on the complexity and malleability of religious practices (as well as their in-tellectual and emotional characteristics), but the very production of text adds to this complexity: its consumption informs individuals’ appropria-tion of traditional religious practices, and perhaps incites them to modify old practices, or even invent new ones. Thus, the perspective of lived an-cient religion does not simply supplement a previous reconstruction of a ritual system; rather, it renders the description more historical and more dynamic. Those who were entitled to conduct auspicia were the same peo-ple listening to Ennius’s Annales; ambitious pontiffs were familiar with the records of the Pontifex Maximus; civil war generals read Varro and Livy or their sources; the nobles of the uppermost or upward-oriented eche-lons of society who very occasionally adopted the ritual role of an Arval were the ones who were able to read the Arval records; Italians newly de-fining their relationship to Rome and the emperors studied or produced copies of the fasti. These texts were also composed with such an audience in mind—sometimes exclusively. Text and ritual were interdependent contexts for ritual performance and for the reception of text respectively. Hence they shaped religion with a potency greater than that of mere intel-lectual attribution of sense or the preservation and transmission of knowl-edge. The coupling of ritual and exegesis in traditional scholarship did not sufficiently capture this relationship.Communication about ritual—in historical matters, specifically writ-ten communication about ritual—was an inseparable part of ritual. As a consequence, I have proposed a modification of the term “ritual,” which tends to imply a normative, repeated structure of acts, a script, or an on-tology independent of any instantiated action. The term “performance,” by contrast, lays open a perspective on the actualization of ritual, not just on individual variants, but also on interpretations and individual motivations—individual appropriations that inform ritual action and are informed by communication about ritual. For a performance to be charac-terized as ritual, it was not important that the act was repeated stereotypi-cally, but that the performers and/or observers were aware of or assumed such a character: ritualization rather than ritual.

What I take to be specific for religion in antiquity (as I describe it) is a form of communication that extends beyond the interchange of au-thors and readers. It is a communication that refers to or directly addresses agents who are frequently, but not inevitably, personalized and who are not within the circle of those who are unquestionably present or relevant to a given situation. These were superhuman agents, or perhaps formerly alive but now dead human agents. The human actor who introduced such agents and chose this mode of action, enlarged her or his own agency, ei-ther by forging an alliance with the divine or by reducing the agency of other human actors as a result of the superior capacities of the god(s) in determining a course of events. Such action, however, bears a social risk, as others might deny the relevance of the specific divine agent, or even of"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"122 Chapter 7any divine agency. It is exactly the uncertainty about whether a not un-questionably plausible agent is introduced that accounts for the potential as well as powerlessness of religion. Such action also bears a religious risk, as the divine agent might not attend to the human address. Again, it is the uncertain outcome of this move that makes it seem either dangerous and potentially powerful or simply futile.1 As in all human communica-tion, the human initiator is obliged to make his or her addressee aware of the communication and to signal to and persuade the addressee of the rel-evancy of the communicative effort and message.2 Religious communica-tion, thus, is not concerned with correctness; rather, it is concerned with success and how to achieve it. It is the individual who is obliged to iden-tify the most successful way to make the gods (to use a standard example) aware of the communicative intention and to make the contents of this communication (the message) relevant and, hence, hopefully successful. Additionally, the individual is responsible for making others—allies, ene-mies, or mere bystanders—aware that this is happening and might be suc-cessful. Originality might be a conspicuous way to make this plausible, but repeating methods that had proven successful in the past, in other words, falling back on shared cultural knowledge, on traditions, would surely be even better. In relation to the gods, it is not the isolated individual, but the individual in society, that is the subject of lived religion, even if compan-ionship with the gods is chosen over human fellowship. It is this model-ing that helps us understand the mechanism of a ritual practice that is both highly individual and, at the same time, merely an instance of mass pro-duction and seemingly uniform religiosity: vows and dedications.Why do we speak of vows and dedications? Of course, these are the practices found in our sources: a human being was in need, he or she ut-tered a wish to a deity, promised something if help or relief were given, the situation improved, and thanks were gratefully given to the god. Ancient theoreticians conceive of this process in juridical terms: after the promise, the vower is voti reus, “accused with regard to the vow,” that is, under obligation to it, and after fulfillment on the part of the god, even voti dam-natus, “penalized by the vow.”3 Fulfillment on the part of the human is 1.

Dedi-cations were also juridical actions: the very word dedico denotes a transfer of property, from the individual’s estate to that of the god. Georg Wissowa, in the chapter of his handbook Religion und Kultus der Römer titled “The Fundamentals of Sacred Law,”4 took pains to differentiate between this sort of private dedication and the transfer of public property to the gods to which he—in accordance with credible sources—ascribed the quality of consecratio. Now, all these distinctions function on the basis of the actors’ knowledge about the gods and their property rights. But from where did they obtain this knowledge? Obviously not from religious instruction in school,5 but rather from observing the procedures of others, for example, from reading tituli (the inscriptions affixed to dedicated objects). Perhaps a term like local “microtradition” might better characterize these proce-dures and serve to avoid the interpretive distortions that result from tal-lying instances of certain formulas and practices as if they were mutually independent. The distinctions of the object language are part of the reality in which they function.Is this not true for every cultural system? I will not deny that I am very sympathetic to the linguistic turn and this type of constructivist stance, but such a generalization begs the essential question. We are dealing with a specific problem of the historical religion we are analyzing (even if this problem is not restricted to the religion of the Romans). The concepts of giving and property transfer function within a framework that is not as straightforward as it might seem. Representations of the divine were themselves emphatically deemed not divine, as ancient discourse about statues demonstrates.6 To a large extent divinities were modeled on supe-rior humans, but the divine superiors were not similarly tangible; rather, they might need to be manifested through epikleisis.7 And yet, statues of the gods were clothed and combed, bound or flogged.8 Of course, as a 4.

There is no need, for example, to deal with the problem of why vowers who deprived the gods of their due were not subject to divine retribution. However, the problem of how to describe such apparent contradictions remains.Obviously, the idea of a divine associate who expects recompense and that of divine property are highly loaded with assumptions about the di-vine; these must be held conceptually distinct, from practices such as gift (donum) or prayer (preces) or simply words (verba).9 In the following analy-sis I will address these phenomena through the lens of “communication.”10 Unlike “system” or “culture” or “ius sacrum” (not an ancient concept), communication starts from the intersubjectively constituted individual. This is also true of “agency” (a concept helpful for understanding appro-priation), but communication, more so than agency, points to interaction, and to the problem of understanding and of misunderstanding. Commu-nication establishes structures and traditions, but these remain precarious, perhaps based on old or newly arising misunderstandings, and are subject to diverse individual appropriation.Unfortunately, we cannot observe ancient religious communication. The human actors are long dead (even if their gods enjoy an increasing internet presence). Sadly, most of the material remains, the sources on the basis of which ancient religion can be reconstructed, were in fact used in religious communication, were parts of acts of communication, and were loaded with intentions, meanings, and emotions, much of which is lost to us.A Model of Religious CommunicationHow, then, should we describe ancient religious communication? Es-sentially, there was a human sender and his or her divine recipient. The sender attempted to transfer a signal, intending it to be received as infor-mation or as a script for action. But how could it be determined that the 9. For the concept of “gift” in general, see still Mauss 1925; for prayer, Pulleyn 1997; Fyn-tikoglou and Voutiras 2005.10.

And how could the message be made relevant?Concentrating on Roman standard procedures, there was a vast array of strategies. The choice of location, for example, was important.11 A raised platform would improve performance, as would a sacred area or temple. Timing was also important: the calendar regulated the opening of temples, and special occasions were set aside for specific requests, such as a good har-vest, disease-free crops, or successful business ventures.12 Multichanneling was another strategy: words were enhanced by gifts. Sound was combined with smell, rising smoke with the downpour of liquids. In many instances word choice explicitly points to the agents’ reflection on the communica-tive problem: audi is a common exclamation in Latin prayers, and epêkoos, “the god who hears,” is an important Greek cult title from Hellenistic times onward.13 Representations of ears might even be offered as a gift.14 Stan-dard procedures, tested and hallowed by tradition, or just reported to be effective,15 were employed, and action was thereby ritualized.16 Occasionally ritual specialists were deployed, but their role tended to remain restricted in Roman antiquity.17 The professionalism of Egyptian magicians is in stark contrast to the do-it-yourself curse tablets of the West, as mentioned earlier.As the desired response would be delayed, checks were introduced. Divination, frequently considered an exotic and marginal feature of an-cient religions, was in fact central to many rituals.18 In a form of meta-communication, oracles were addressed to improve ritual communication. Successful transmission of the signal during animal sacrifice was regularly assessed through scrutiny of the liver or other entrails.19 Because animal 11.

Again, the risky nature of the communication is apparent:20 pains are taken to exclude disturbances and eliminate mistakes, and yet the very performance of such risk management construes the com-munication as risky. An inappropriate or incorrect utterance during the ceremony, an agent’s ominous name, a slip of tongue or foot: communica-tion could be imperiled in countless ways.21The ritual communication described so far was generically furthered by materialization and monumentalization, thus conferring prominence on the message and indicating its relevance. It was surely reassuring to use the temples and statues built by others for one’s own attempts at com-munication; this enhanced the plausibility of new communicative efforts in the eyes of both the agents and their observers.22 In accordance with the strategies mentioned above, temples could be named as locations and statues as addressees. But these were not ab initio creations: they were not simply built and dedicated, but they were themselves the products of acts of communication. Temples in Rome were built in fulfillment of vows.23 Statues and other images were the most visible signs of the presence of the gods. (Sometimes they even acknowledged a prayer by a small movement of their eyes.)24 They often were objects of thanksgiving,25 promised in a vow or added to a prayer. Thus, the production of the most visible form of the addressee is both a result of communication and the precondition for further successful, and less risky, communication. Understanding this communicative circle is important to the issue of ex post differentiation be-tween so-called cult statues and dedicated images,26 or between promised dedications and spontaneous gifts.

Such infrastructure, however, could not prevent the prolifera-tion of religious communication outside of the monumental and beautiful sanctuaries that had been financed by the political elite.

For most people, monumental expression was economically unfeasible and not part of everyday ritual praxis. And yet the less costly votives that were available, terra-cotta statues for ex-ample, followed the same communicative rules.Appropriating Religious SpaceWritten prayers, the wax tablets mentioned in some authors of the first and second centuries AD,29 prolonged the presence of a prayer, and thus the duration of the ritual. Placing the text on the legs of the statue al-lowed the supplicant to transcend the temporal restrictions on presence and performance. In this case, writing could replace repetition, some-times hinted at by exhortations on objects of dedications to repeatedly kindle lamps or replace or add coins.30 The idea of “perpetuated ac-tion” might also apply to images and their performance of a “pictorial act.”31 In cases of asocial wishes, the writing of a prayer and its secret deposition—in a fountain such as that of Anna Perenna, in a sacrificial hearth such as the one at Mayence, or in a grave—might have served to avoid the social exposure of praying aloud, but above all these actions exercise the same techniques of appropriating a special place in perpet-uated action, relying on speech as much as on graphic and representa-tional elements, from unusual or distorted letters to the treatment of the material bearers of such texts.32Without doubt, dedicatory tablets, the notices of thanksgiving that ac-companied objects, had a similar function. They permanently attested the power and beneficence of a deity, even if the laudatory section of texts was usually brief, and formulas such as ex voto or ex visu would simultaneously have referred the objects to the processes of communication. These ele-ments furthered individual acts of worship in open, public spaces; that is, they were religious communication centered on sacred areas.29. Juv. 10.56; Apul. Apol. 54; Philostr.

Frequently, self-descriptions were not restricted to a name, but also included information about status, or even a career description. An excellent example is found in a narrative from Aelius Aristides (Hieroi logoi 4.45–47) that I present in summary:After several performances of a chorus for Zeus, Aelius intended to dedicate a tripod made of silver, a “symbol of gratitude toward the god, but also as a me-morial of the choroi,” as he formulates. He produced a distich, running thus: “Poet, judge, and choreutes in one person, I dedicated this memorial to you, o lord, for the foundation of the chorus.” The following two verses named the donator and claimed the dedication to be under the tutelage of the god. In a dream, however, the god sent another text: “Not unknown to any Hel-lene, Aristides has dedicated me—Aristides, the famous dirigent of eternally streaming words and a hero.” In a discussion with the priests all participants agreed to set up the memorial in the temple of Zeus Asklepios. The tripod, adorned with three golden statues of Asklepios, Hygieia, and Telephoros, held the new inscription and a note that it was added as a consequence of a dream. In order to fulfill an older oracle, Aelius also set up another dedication for Olympian Zeus. He finished his narrative with the remark that he devoted himself to oratory, being convinced that his name would survive the centuries as the god had characterized his speech as “eternally streaming.” (4.47)The story offers a splendid illustration of the mechanisms of religious communication and the agency arrogated by religious action. In talking to the gods, people communicated with their fellow citizens, contemporary or yet to come. Motives might have been diverse, but hoping for a public honorific statue (even paid for by oneself) would have been futile for many, while the funerary cursus honorum would come too late for the more am-bitious. Here, religious communication offered an alternative; there was here no need to find somebody else to put up a votive inscription with your name on it. Women would not be as inclined to engage in such activities, as there was no position of agency for them to arrogate: of the Isis officials in the city of Rome, twenty-one sacerdotes are known. Ten males and one female are known from dedicatory inscriptions set up by themselves; nine females and one male are known from tomb inscriptions.3333.

The text of Aristides makes his diverse motives explicit, but shows that the communicative efforts were concentrated on the deity above all.34 Mary Beard, by contrasting the standard practices of open polytheistic cult in ancient cities with those of more tightly organized groups, identified the naming in dedicatory inscriptions as the functional equivalent of membership lists.35 But would signaling a stable relationship with a certain deity prevent the dedicants from addressing themselves to other deities? The many instances of multiple acts of communication and different addressees suggest that this was not the case. Aelius’s discussion with priests and temple personnel led to a change in the addressee,36 and the dedicated object itself referred to several deities. In the end, that change also induced him to produce a second memorial.Another facet is added to our interpretation of dedicatory inscriptions: if we take the problems of communication and its many risks into account, the emphasis must have been on the successful completion of communica-tion rather than on a special relationship with one god to the exclusion of others. The author presents herself or himself as a person that is capable of establishing a communicative link with a deity, of gaining an audience and receiving an answer. Far from self-evident, this is a noteworthy indi-vidual religious accomplishment, even if one’s success was surely perceived as partially attributable to familial and social status. Such a person would also be able to address other gods with similar reliability and success, and hence the inscription prepared the social environment for such new com-munications. If we accept that ancient societies were not hierarchically but heterarchically organized, on the combined criteria of social and political power, it is to be assumed that religious authority was an independent type of power.37Of course, in Aelius’s narrative about the change of the epigram, the special feature is the oracular prompt. The prophecy was addressed to an author who was obsessed by language and immediately started training 34. See Rosenberger 2013a for the importance of divination; in general C. P.

A note on Aristides’s tripod added the information ex visu, “from a vision.” This again points to an intention to make the dedication an organic part of the communication between the dedicant and the god. It is the location that eliminates any ambiguity about the addressee: the tripod is directly associated with the large temple statue. Again, it is a particular trait of Aelius’s text that the addressee is not explic-itly named. There is, rather, an explicit deliberation about the addressee and the interpretation of the location.38Aspects of the scene described by Aelius can be generalized: prayers are often addressed to the di immortales as a generic group. In many instances it is not necessary to specify a particular addressee; during public festivals there was no need to be especially concerned about each of the many dei-ties that appear in prayers or as statues. Such laxness was not admissible for occasions—and I should like to stress the difference—as specific and individual as we suppose the situations leading to dedications to have been. Admittedly, formulas like sive dea, sive deus show the ancients at pains to determine the correct deity. But what would be the range of choices? It was not a list learned by heart from teachers or parents. Temples offered the most obvious choices, and at first glance it would seem that this must have significantly limited the options available to those who were not inhabitants of larger cities. Yet a single temple might offer space for the veneration of multiple deities; the phenomenon of the synnaoi theoi was widespread.39 Dedicatory inscriptions from a given site often feature the names of deities other than the divine owner or owners of the site—which is sometimes difficult to establish given this situation. Thus, existing dedications further determined the range of plausible choices for a new communication or the identification of the divine collocutor in a successfully concluded commu-nication. At times, the more general invocation of “all gods” or the explicit refusal to name a specific not unquestionably plausible agent might have helped counter the competing claims or challenges of bystanders.The rhetorical connotations of “plausibility” seem to be very fitting. The problem is to name—that is, to construct—the divine addressee in a way that is as successful and plausible to oneself as it is to others. As an 38. Aristid. Hieroi logoi 4.45–46.39.

Hence, naming was a situational strategy, not an absolute one. There was, for example, no need to name one’s parents on a family tomb area,41 but perhaps this was a helpful reminder of the individual construction of their divine status. On the other hand, a neighboring inscription might have stressed that there is nothing to follow the life that has passed. The model of a religion restricted to a rule-based system called “cult” is not adequate to describe the cumulative outcome of such decisions.Religious metacommunication, that is, communication between hu-mans about communication between humans and gods, was not restricted to inscriptions. Narratives such as that of Aelius Aristides explored prob-lems of establishing communication and hinted at alternatives. In other instances iconography replaced words. Even treatises we would call “sys-tematic theology,” such as Varro’s handbook Antiquitates rerum diuinarum, participated in such metacommunication, the communication about ritual communication. I doubt, however, that this would have been more rel-evant to most religious actors than the inscriptions visible in temples.Success and DeclineIn the Roman Empire—and I am thinking particularly of those parts that did not have a long-standing Greek tradition of putting up inscriptions—the frequency of inscriptions increased consistently until the second half of the second century and the beginning of the third, reaching its height in the late Antonine and Severan epoch, and thereafter began a long decline. These patterns are discussed under the heading “epigraphic habit.”42 Thus, epigraphic habit has become a factor in the history of reli-gion. But is it a religious factor?Certainly, a predilection to use text was a religious factor in the period of increasing inscriptional frequency.43 For cultures lacking in widespread 40. Aristid.

Rome’s republican polythe-ism burgeoned with the dedications of new temples by victorious generals, while the polytheism of Germania inferior and superior spread through the deployment of cheap sandstone slabs on the margins of military and civilian settlements.44 On the basis of my earlier hypothesis, permanently visible gifts indicated religious competence, and religion claimed an im-portant share in visible public culture. “Being Roman”—I will vary an al-ready proverbial opening45—meant to possess the religious competence to identify one’s divine addressee among the group of those known to one’s peers, or even to plausibly address one that was new.Ancient theoreticians elaborated on this competence. In the Hermetic treatise “Asclepius” (the transmitted Latin text of which might go back to a third-century composite Greek original and even earlier parts), Hermes Trismegisthos praises human beings:“Nec inmerito miraculo dignus est, qui est omnium maximus. deorum genus omnium confessione manifestum est de mundissima parte natuare esse prog-natum signaque eorum sola quasi capita pro omnibus esse. species uero de-orum, quas conformat humanitas, ex utraque natura conformatae sunt; ex diuina, quae est purior multoque diuinior, et ex ea, quae intra homines est, id est ex materia, qua fuerint fabricatae, et non solum capitibus solis sed mem-bris omnibus totoque corpore figurantur. ita humanitas semper memor natu-rae et originis suae in illa diuinitatis imitatione perseuerat, ut, sicuti pater ac dominus, ut sui similes essent, deos fecit aeternos, ita humanitas deos suos ex sui uultus similitudine figuraret.” “Statuas dicis, o Trismegiste?”—“Statuas, o Asclepi. uidesne, quatenus tu ipse diffidas? statuas animatas sensu et spir-itu plenas tantaque facientes et talia, statuas futurorum praescias eaque sorte; uate, somniis multisque aliis rebus praedicentes, inbecillitates hominibus fa-cientes easque curantes, tristitam laetitiamque pro meritis.” (23–24)“Mankind certainly deserves admiration, as the greatest of all beings.

But the figures of gods that humans form have been formed of both natures—from the divine, which is purer and more divine by far, and from the material of which they are built, whose nature falls short of the human—and they repre-sent not only the heads but all the limbs and the whole body. Always mindful of its nature and origin, humanity persists in imitating divinity, representing its gods in semblance of its own features, just as the father and master made his gods eternal to resemble him.”—“Are you talking about statues, Tris-megistus?” [Asclepius asks.]—“Statues, Asclepius, yes. See how little trust you have. I mean statues ensouled and conscious, filled with spirit and doing great deeds; statues that foreknow the future and predict it by lots, by proph-ecy, by dreams and by many other means; statues that make people ill and cure them, bringing them pain and pleasure as each deserves.”46Such anthropological statements about all mankind are found only among the few who understand. The growing public importance of religion in the imperial period caused reflection on religion, an intellectual discourse47 among these “few” as well as a growing demand for religious specialists. Certainly, Egypt went much further in both respects, and it is probably sig-nificant that I must turn to Greek or originally Greek texts to find elabo-rate examples of a phenomenon that otherwise does not appear before the development of a Latin, largely Christian, theology.These reflections, even if implicit and less elaborate, in turn demanded representation. The relationships between the deity and the human pro-tagonist needed explanations or intermediators. Who put up the additional and explanatory note ex visu for Aelius’s tripod? We do not know. As far as the main epigram is concerned, Aelius Aristides discussed matters with the specialists but features as the sole agent (apart from Asclepius) in his text. This was not a matter of course.

The ritual was begun on May 4 and finished on the seventh of the same month, when Titus Sextius Lateranus and Lucius Cuspio Rufinus were consuls. The place [for the dedication] was given by decree of the city council.Little discursive space remains for Septicia and Optatia to advertise their religious competence in this ceremony that is sponsored and organized by the decurions mentioned at the end of the text.49 Specialists dominate the religious communication, standardizing both the constructions of address-ees and the modes of access. The growing importance of organization and intellectualization of religion50 exacted a price: dedicators were increas-ingly less willing to act on behalf of others, while specialists proved to have a specific and lasting relationship with the divine in the form of permanent religious roles as prophets, teachers, or monks. With the increase of orga-nized religion, documentation of isolated acts of religious communication by epigraphic texts might have seemed less relevant.A second factor must be addressed: monumentally written commu-nication was a matter of societies that conceived of themselves as stable. The costs of the production must have been (perceived to be) offset by the expected duration of the religious and social configuration. Hence, the spread of inscriptions took a long time to permeate provincial societies, and socially volatile societies preferred short-term investments, perfor-mances for instance. Intensification and repetition of ritual, daily cult in the extreme, might even replace action that was “perpetuated,” but also frozen. The popularity of religious narrative accompanied ritual but did not replace it.5148. CIL 13.1754 = ILS 4134.49. I am grateful to Wolfgang Spickermann for this example.50. See Cameron 1991.51.

The developments of the third and fourth centuries might rightly be described as an intensification and ex-tension of religion within society and its different “publics,” and even as simultaneously increased differentiation between and concentrated coher-ence within religious options—a sort of “confessionalization.”53 In this case, the costly act of spelling out religious communications on stone might have lost its appeal, even if thousands of objects deposited in sanctuaries and on the tombs of martyrs continued to materialize individual appropriations of shared places. Stressing the continuous relationship with a god while deny-ing the importance of a mere partial form of the divine would lead to the preference for other types of religious communication and its documenta-tion, for example membership, participation, moral conduct, a whole way of life. The famous dedications of the fourth-century pagans in the city of Rome54 or the inscribed objects commemorating taurobolia and concen-trating on priestly offices55 announced multiple memberships and compe-tences.56 And yet, even if the focus of the writing shifted and its quantity decreased, the communicative technique itself remained important and powerful.

I do not intend to examine it sentence by sentence, but rather to analyze its com-position and development and to select for special attention a few passages that I consider to be key. Chapter 1 of this book was significantly guided by the sociology of religion, while subsequent chapters took a more herme-neutical approach, as I aimed, for the most part, to reconstruct ancient ob-servers’ reflections on contemporary lived religion. I have also addressed the producers of texts as part of this religion and examined their specific appropriation of contemporary religious practices, slowly shifting from the early Augustan to the imperial period, and from poetry to mass-produced texts, that is, inscriptions. Ending here with a text from the second century AD, I will continue my twofold approach to authored text, but will then revisit the sociology of literature and religion and examine the text for ev-idence of long-term processes of individualization, as described in the in-troductory chapter. The history of the reception of The Shepherd of Hermas"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"140 Chapter 8offers at least a glimpse into long-term processes that might indicate a spe-cific type of religious individuality and its development. The text invites such an inquiry, as it explicitly asks for reception, for hearing rather than reading, and later develops a structure that, as I will claim, attests to repet-itive use. In general, The Shepherd of Hermas has usually been treated as a—more or less negligible—point in a history of dogmatics. We find it so described, for instance, in the recent Oxford Handbook of Christian Study.1 I aim to incorporate it into our view of lived ancient religion as a document that is characterized by uncoordinated, parainstitutional, and even con-trainstitutional appropriations.I will begin by sketching out the text of The Shepherd of Hermas in broad strokes, after which I will dissect the text through the concepts of mediality, authorship and genre, and contents and strategy, only in order to then reconstitute it from the perspective of “religious practice.” The author, I claim, is somebody who thinks in terms of reflective—that is, self-conscious and religious—individuality and offers others mate-rial for contemplation, inviting those who wish to follow his lead. The text, its reproduction, and its performance will be analyzed as an institu-tion that furthered individuality, hence as part of a process of religious individualization. Again, as we will see, “institution” does not imply a normative religious order, but a contingent development of lived ancient religion.The Shepherd of Hermas comes to us as a Greek text in papyrus frag-ments written from the third until the sixth century. The text (cut off at the end) was part of the Codex Sinaiticus, the fundamental Bible manuscript of the fourth century with the siglum Aleph. It is preserved completely in a fifteenth-century manuscript from Mount Athos. Medieval manuscripts supply two complete Latin translations, the so-called Vulgate, that prob-ably date to the late second century.2 Additionally, external testimonials begin to appear at the end of the second century. The canon Muratori, as we will see later, assigns the work to the brother of a Roman bishop Pius, traditionally dated to the second quarter of the second century. No further 1.

All other deductions must be based on the text itself and remain, therefore, hypothetical. The existence of a Roman “bishop,” in the middle of the sec-ond century is, however, certainly a fiction. For the sake of brevity I will treat some of the conclusions drawn from historical analysis of the text as fact, despite their hypothetical character. I have, in earlier publications, of-fered detailed arguments for my identification of the author of the text as a producer of salt, fully embedded in his culture; this portrait differs from that of the communis opinio.3Presentation of the TextA decade ago I would have introduced The Shepherd of Hermas as an early Christian but post–New Testament document, as a well-known repre-sentative of the “apostolic fathers,” which became an object of theologi-cal interest only in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, our chronological assumptions have recently become tenuous. As an extreme but thoroughly plausible example, I will briefly outline the recent conclu-sions of Markus Vinzent.4 The demanding and theologically very trenchant Pauline letters are old; they date from the middle of the first century. How-ever, they were rarely read—despite the very diverse interests betrayed by the pseudo-Pauline letters—before the Asian shipowner Marcion came to Rome in the middle of the second century. He made them the central com-ponent of a new post-biblical “canon,” which was completed by the Gospel of Luke and the same author’s “Acts.” These historical narratives, certainly built on earlier collections of sayings, quickly found imitators and rivals, leading to a larger number of Gospels, four of which achieved canonical status (earlier with some, later with other ancient theologians) and, like The Shepherd, were included in the Codex Sinaiticus. According to such a model, the Shepherd might antedate rather than postdate these Gospels.I have not myself done sufficient research to judge this hypothesis, but against such a backdrop (or similar, even earlier scenarios), we need not be surprised that no quotations of what later came to be called the New 3.

Nor need we be surprised that Hermas does not speak of “Christ followers,” of Christianoi, and that his Christology identifies Christ with “god,” the “son of god” (89), that is, Jesus Christ, who (like the logos) remains unnamed, is a “spirit,” a “name,” and a special “angel” of the father who has granted all power to his son and adviser (59, 89).5 Finally, by this hypothesis, we should not be surprised by how many authors quote The Shepherd.6 Around AD 200 Irenaeus quotes The Shepherd in Gallic Lyon, Tertullian does so in African Carthage, Clem-ens in Egyptian Alexandria, and Origen in Palestinian Caesarea. Transla-tions (beyond those in Latin) were completed in both the Sahidic and the Achmimic dialects of Coptic, in Ethiopian, and in Middle Persian. The complete lack of interest of the theologians of the fourth and fifth century seems, admittedly, at odds with this popularity. But for these writers, the text did not provide arguments pertinent to ongoing Christological debates. Nevertheless, despite these theological debates, the text continued to be read and copied throughout this period. In the fifth or sixth century it found its way, in fairly good shape, into the compilation of Pseudo-Athanasius.7I will postpone discussion of the possible reasons for the text’s popular-ity at the time of its genesis and the ensuing period to later, when I exam-ine its contents in detail. For now, I note that one would, rather, expect the text to have had limited appeal on account of its intimidating length; in today’s editions The Shepherd is well over one hundred printed pages. Thus it exceeds every other text collected in the canon of the New Testament since the end of the fourth century.The structure of the text points to a rather complex developmental pro-cess in the emergence of a written text. Five sections can be distinguished; I will argue that these are not merely layers, but indications of a process of textual growth, the duration of which cannot be precisely determined.1. A book of visions (vis 1–vis 4) of about twenty modern printed pages mark the starting point—historically as well as in the text as it is published today. Different revelatory figures converse with the first-person narrator and 5. See in general Brox 1991, 485–95; for the angelology, see Stuckenbruck 1995; Bucur 2007, 2009a, 2009b.6.

Finally, a heavenly book is dictated.2. Introduced by the fifth vision (this numbering is already ancient), twelve “commandments” (entolaí, mandata) follow, forming a second stratum consisting of about twenty-five printed pages (vis 5–mand 12), that is to say, filling an average ancient scroll of eight hundred to one thousand lines of text. The revelatory figure and interlocutor is, for the first time, the epon-ymous “shepherd,” a man dressed in goatskin, with a satchel on his back and a staff in his hand, who introduces himself as the future companion of the first-person narrator, who is now addressed as “Hermas.” The section closes with a discussion of the problem of false prophets, thus indirectly questioning the reliability of the text itself.3. In an expansion of the dialogical scene of the twelfth commandment, the revelatory figure transforms into an angel “of penitence,” of whom, till now, no mention has been made. This angel reports eight parables, a text again on a scale of almost twenty-five printed pages (mand 12– sim 8). These parables are interpreted in a dialogue between Hermas and the angel. This stratum is more politically oriented than those previous: not only does it commence with the question of belonging to the true city, of true civitas, it also reflects on specifically Roman and Italic institutions and social life, as can be seen from the metaphors and terminology used.4. Opening with the remark that the previous two passages have been writ-ten down, the angel of penitence offers a new parable, the ninth and most extensive of all (sim 9). Alone it covers almost twenty-five printed pages, another ancient book. So far as its contents are concerned, it returns to the image of a tower, already introduced in vision 3. The tower signifies the new church (ecclesia), the new community of the faithful. The text closes with the equation of the angel and the shepherd. It was probably this ap-position that prompted a later editorial adjustment introducing the same equation into the fifth vision (the opening of the second layer of text).5. The final stratum is again introduced with the remark that the previous parable has been written down. The angel speaks for the last time (sim 10). The place of revelation is Hermas’s bedroom (in which occurred the pre-lude to the third vision and the fifth vision itself, the first appearance of the shepherd). This relatively short text (only about three printed pages) is ob-viously editorial and marked the end of the redaction of The Shepherd as a whole. Here, the further support of the shepherd is promised, as well as that of the virgins, that is, those virtues of the Ecclesia, beautiful women robed in white, that had urged on the building of the tower in visio 3 and simile 9. In the latter, these women had invited Hermas to stay overnight with them."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"144 Chapter 8One could summarize The Shepherd as the text of a Roman Jew who cared for his own moral status and the moral status of his contemporary co-believers, who were already Christ-followers. He tried to convey visions of an ideal church. His audience was a steadily growing group of Jews into whose collective imagination this spirit, angel, and son had entered. Otherwise, this group appears to have been fully integrated into local Roman society, a so-ciety that held reasonable values and offered many attractions. It is within this context, judged by the author as a context of temptation, that Hermas reports his insights in the form of an apocalyptic text, as readers of the book of visions or the canon Muratori could not fail to detect. Genuine religious experiences8 are combined with a strong will to communicate them.MedialityIn speaking of religious experience and referring to the text in the singular, I have already indicated that I assume a single author rather than a later ed-itor. It is this author whom the text invites us to identify with the first-person narrator. The text is a narrative but it is dominated, indeed, overwhelmed, by direct speech from the second textual layer onward. Here, the text be-comes a dialogue punctuated by long monologues. A written revelation is reported in the very first textual layer, namely in visio 2. Merely copying the letters, however, as Hermas tells us, does not result in understanding. For this, two weeks of preparatory fasting and praying is required. Even then, an additional vision with textual supplements and further tasks is neces-sary. The medium of oral speech (fictitious orality, of course, imagined on the basis of the written text only) is, by comparison, much more flexible. Oral exchange permits requests for immediate clarification, and it even al-lows the interlocutors to “read between the lines.”A view of verbal communication as a means to interactively clarify prob-lems, deepen understanding, and overcome mistaken judgments is encoded in the written revelations of Hermas. From its earliest layer onward the text is characterized by requests for clarification, interpretation of what had already been said, and even corrections of understandings attained 8.

As I will explain presently, autobiographi-cal details play a momentous role in the generic conventions of apocalyp-tic literature. Revelatory figures are described in detail: their appearance, companions, changes of facial expression, and attire. The growth of the text suggests a broadening process of communications not only in written form (writing is a distributive medium) but also orally. The text does not merely represent verbal communication: each subsequent textual layer, perhaps ini-tially oral and later in written form, also is constrained by earlier remarks,10 employs consistent metaphorical language, and refrains from introducing large amounts of new material (as purely written communication would allow one to do). It was the written form, however, and perhaps even the publication of the different textual strata, that permitted precise reference to previous layers. It was the written form alone that allowed for a text of a length that prohibits full recitation on a single occasion; recitation of the final version in its entirety would have taken more than four hours.However, a written text offers the further advantage of communication “to all those that are chosen” (8.3),11 especially in its earliest phase of circu-lation. The organization of those Greek-speaking, Judeo-Christian Romans (this very specific designation is intended to counter common misconceptions) can be reconstructed in its basic structures from the book of visions itself:The elderly woman came and asked if I had already given the book to the presbyters. I said that I had not. “You have done well,” she said, “for I have some words to add. Then, when I complete all the words, they will be made known through you to all those who are chosen. And so, you will write two little books, sending one to Clement and the other to Grapte. Clement will send his to the foreign cities, for that is his commission. But Grapte will ad-monish the widows and orphans. And you will read yours in this city, with the presbyters who lead the church.” (8.2–3)12The first authority—and, if we like, patron, reader, and (co-) author— is the elderly lady who “adds words,” which are apparently not just marginal 9.

And yet it is Hermas’s task to see to the initial copying and distri-bution, which will then be continued through distinct channels: a certain Clement will make further copies and send the book out for the foreign trade, while Grapte will use it for the admonition of “widows and orphans,” hence a female channel for women and children in need. The college of the presbyters, therefore, holds only limited ruling powers, which are not spec-ified at all. They do not, apparently, regulate the relation between patron and author, nor do they have a say in the book’s distribution in foreign cit-ies, nor do they interfere with the instruction of women. The term “presby-ter” seems here to be used synonymously with episcopes. This staff forms the forum in which Hermas will recite the written text, which has been re-vealed to him and thus, probably, also to his patron (8.3).13 In his narrative of the first layer of the text Hermas opts for precision: the divine original is a letter, which is addressed to Hermas and which features his personal problems as a central theme. It is a letter that charges him with messages for third parties and, above all, the vituperation of a certain Maximus (7.1–4). The general meeting, perhaps referred to by the salutation “brothers,” is not described in terms of an institution that plays an organizational role, and it is not clear whether recitation before the presbyters implied a request for permission to recite the text before a larger circle under presbyterial super-vision. By virtue of being written, the text would become easier to control. But above all, the existence of the written form permitted further copying, more precisely, another two copies: the one that reached widows and or-phans via Grapte, the second to engage Clemens in the distribution of the text by letter in other municipalities, therefore to create additional copies (8.3). We might recall that John’s Apocalypsis also presented itself as a letter. However, as in all such cases it was, finally, re-oralization alone that enabled the text to become known to larger groups of people. That is, it succeeded in transcending spatial, social, or gender boundaries.Authorship and GenreIf one were to believe the canon Muratori, perhaps written, as the text itself claims, at the end of the second century (perhaps, however, much 13. See Vinzent 2014, 106–7."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Instructing Literary Practice in The Shepherd of Hermas 147later), Hermas would have been the brother of the Roman bishop Pius.14 On the other hand, the prologue to the text in the Latin Vulgate tradi-tion identifies Hermas as one of those to whom Paul sends greetings in Romans 16:14. Evidently, learned scribes attempted to locate the popular text within valued traditions. The Shepherd itself does not offer the slight-est hint that it aimed to solve its naturally questionable reliability through any such reference to the author’s genealogy or association with the let-ters of Paul. Of course, every visionary faces the problem of establishing his or her credibility.15 I do not here question the authenticity of the vi-sionary experience. Rather, I presuppose it, taking into account all the re-finements of our current understanding of the idea and even of the very concept of “experience.”16 It was a widespread conviction in Mediterra-nean antiquity that visions by day or during sleep were credible forms of communication with superhuman authorities, and such visions were pas-sively or actively appropriated in many instances. This appropriation at times included critical attitudes, tracking down the deceptions, the false or empty dreams that were like water in wine. Cicero presents the ex-treme positions in the form of two radically contradictory statements in On divination: occasional false dreams cannot discredit correct forecasts. This is the position developed in the first book.17 The second book, how-ever, offers an argument that can be summarized thus: given the large number of dreams, occasional correct forecasts must be accepted as lucky chances, as flukes, but they are no proof of the divinatory character of such dreams.18Against this critical background, Hermas chose a double strategy. First, he produced his own reliability through ruthless autobiographical self-revelation. Hence the beginning of the whole text:The one who raised me sold me to a certain woman named Rhoda, in Rome. After many years, I regained her acquaintance and began to love her as a sis-ter. When some time had passed, I saw her bathing in the Tiber river; and I gave her my hand to help her out of the river. When I observed her beauty 14. See below.15. Rüpke 2003a, 2013e.16.

(1.1–2)Hermas was a released domestic slave by birth (verna) or a foundling, who managed to establish a family of his own and had conducted business with variable success, probably trading. Only later did he come to the more hon-est activity of sea-salt extraction.19 On seeing his former owner and fellow believer Rhode emerging naked from her bath in the Tiber, he indulged in inappropriate (as he himself will point out later) erotic fantasies.20 To imagine a sexual relationship with his former mistress was probably deeply offensive to his social environment.21 At the same time, realizing this fantasy—the ultimate libertine achievement, to judge from its frequent emphasis in tomb inscriptions—would endanger his legitimate marriage.22 Hermas’s self-recrimination continues. His own children have fallen prey to corrupting influences (3.1). As an old-fashioned Roman pater familias he must also accept responsibility for their behavior before the God of Jewish tradition. The text (that is, the message) has an author, and this author is “transparent,” honest to the point of confessing his own mistakes and ad-mitting that others mistrust him. He is, therefore, credible. Thus laid bare, the author remains present not only as a narrator but also as a partner in dialogue, within which he exposes himself as fainthearted and lacking in understanding, and is again and again rebuked.This first strategy seems almost antithetical to the second. Hermas furthered his communicative efforts by combining his emphasis on oral-ity and authenticity with the conventions of the apocalyptic genre. In postexilic Judaism, particularly since the second century BC, texts were produced that presented themselves as the reports of outstanding biblical characters. These offered insights in the form of visions into the events of the last days of continuous history.23 The pseudonymous nature of such “apocalyptic” texts was predetermined by the putative narrator: a bibli-cal seer narrating in the first person was meant to be understood as the 19.

Many of the conventions and motifs of apocalyptic texts appear in The Shepherd: the rapture by a spirit and the visions of heavenly revela-tory figures, who within one vision add further visions and explanations. A command is issued to pass on the texts, either orally or by circulating the text. In a recitation of the book of visions the words apokálypsis or apo-kalýptein would have been spoken with extraordinary frequency: they ap-pear twenty-seven times in total.The combination of the two strategies described above would have changed the audience’s concept of apocalypse. Above all, it presented the heavenly hypotext as an immediate concern; it encoded a contemporary individual moral admonition, not a primarily eschatological one. This strategy was modified in the later layers of the text, but it was pursued in principle. From the second layer onward, it is not the key word “apoca-lypse,” which continued the strategy, but the address to the visionary in-dividual, the repeated imperative to create a written record. This became true to an even higher degree when, in the second vision, Hermas is pro-moted to the role of primary addressee of all revelations. This rendered the apocalyptic tone less obtrusive, but more general at the same time, as is shown by the scope of the reception.Contents and StrategyFrom the perspective of classic dogma-historical terminology, The Shep-herd of Hermas deals with the possibility of a second penitence after baptism.

Without this lens the text appears in another light.One of the distinctive features of the The Shepherd is its interest in ty-pology and classification. This is conspicuous in the discussion of virtues and sins that structures the commandments, the second layer of the text. However, the classification of members of the ekklêsia is even more strik-ing and central. They are presented as different types of stones (vis 3, sim 9) or tested with branches (sim 8). It seems to be of central importance to distinguish between different types and gradations, or even specific “per-centages,” of strong or weak belief. In parable 8 this results in twenty-eight different grades of believer. Thus, the distribution of long branches of wil-low leads to the following results:From some he received sticks that were withered and eaten up, as if by a moth. The angel commanded those who gave him these kinds of sticks to stand to one side. Others handed over withered sticks, but they were not moth-eaten; he commanded these to stand to one side as well. Oth-ers handed them over half withered. These also stood to the side. Others handed over sticks that were half withered and split. These stood to the side. Others handed over sticks that were green, but split. These stood to the side. Others handed over sticks that were half withered and half green. These stood to the side. Others brought their sticks two parts green and the third part withered. These stood to the side. Others handed over sticks that were two parts withered but the third part green. These stood to the side. Oth-ers handed over their sticks that were almost entirely green, but a little part of their sticks was withered, at the end. But they were split. These stood to the side. The sticks of others were just a little green, but the remaining parts of the sticks were withered. These stood to the side. Others came in carry-ing green sticks, as they had received them from the angel. The majority of the crowd handed over sticks like this. The angel was extremely happy with these. And they stood to the side. Others handed over sticks that were green and budding. They stood to the side, and the angel was extremely cheerful about these. Others handed over sticks that were green and budding, but their buds seemed to be bearing fruit. The men whose sticks were found like this were extremely cheerful. The angel rejoiced over them, and the shepherd was extremely cheerful with him about these. (67.6–18)Hermas was not concerned with the delineation of sharp borders. There are those within and those outside circle of fellows in religion; “peoples”"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"152 Chapter 8(ethnoi) and apostates are on the outside (4.2), and the text is not interested in these. Rather, the problem that was central for Hermas lies in the gray areas. According to him, it is easy to come to belief, and it is easy then to gradually fall out of it again. But it is difficult to know where oneself or an-other stands exactly. The Shepherd captures the problem in the parable of the trees in winter. If you regard the trees without leaves you do not know which of them still lives (sim 3): “For just as the trees that shed their leaves in the winter all look alike, with the withered indistinguishable from the living, so too in this age it is not clear who the upright are and who the sin-ners, but they all appear alike” (52.3).The same problem is expressed in the parable of the building of the tower (sim 9). The tower rapidly rises to an impressive size, but then repair becomes necessary, and “stones” must be reworked or removed—“stones” that in their different qualities represent the members of the community and their deficiencies (82.2, 83.3–5). Construction is interrupted, and the eschatological completion is delayed. What is missing here is a clarification of the community’s limits. Whosoever are in the gray area must quickly change their minds; they require metanoia.But what exactly is to be changed? Here Hermas remains astonishingly vague. In talking about marriage and separation, adultery is described as “to behave like the peoples” (29.9),25 and to seek for advice from profes-sional fortune-tellers is idolatry (43.4). But such behaviors as these could also be observed among the members of Hermas’s own group.“The deeds of the peoples” are the indicator of full apostasy (75.3), but this is not specified further either. Obviously the wealthy are foremost in occupying dangerous territory, and a simple businessman like Hermas must be classed among these. To act euergetically, to gain in prestige and thus to reap public glory, is just as reasonable as it is problematic. Hermas, I am tempted to conclude, tries to fight a traditional middle-class ethics with a new middle-class ethics.Occasionally, this leads to surprising emphases. Of course greed, extra-marital sexual relations, luxury, and splendid meals are associated with each other. But Hermas focuses on the physical results of excessive dining, on business contacts with heathens, and on uncharitably turning away beg-gars. He formulates a complex psychological model for this and illustrates 25. Ehrman (2003a, 247) translates “like the outsiders“ (toîs éthnesin)."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Instructing Literary Practice in The Shepherd of Hermas 153it with the simile of the willow branches. I quote only a portion of the relevant material from the end of the eighth parable:Those who handed over sticks that were two parts withered and the third part green are those who have been faithful, but who also have grown wealthy and maintained a high standing among the outsiders. These have clothed themselves with great arrogance and become conceited; they have abandoned the truth and do not cling to those who are upright, but live with the outsiders. And this path has become very sweet to them. Still, they have not fallen away from God, but have remained in the faith, even though they do not do the works of faith. And so many of these have repented, and their dwelling is in the tower. But others have taken up residence, once and for all, with the outsiders. These have fallen away from God by being borne along by the vanities of the outsiders and acting like them. And so these are counted among the outsiders. Some of them were doubleminded and did not hope to be saved because of what they did. Others were doubleminded and created schisms among themselves. (76.1–4)Straightforward economic problems are signs of a divine punishment for the rich; as a consequence they fall into the danger of apostasy (14.5). The angelos tryphês, the angel of luxury, is also an angel of deception; it is in-herent to the active and irritable character of the businessman. A produc-tive occupation, therefore, should be preferred to trade. Here, the social climber Hermas evidently reflects on his own situation.However, Hermas is not interested in issues of social class, but in the in-dividual and in psychology: the high-spirited (eupsychos) and the doubtful (dipsychos) emerge as important types in his analysis. “Turning around,” metanoia, is an individual biographical process. This process does not re-main abstract but neither does it become radical: the rich man should make charitable donations but should not give up his status, as is stressed in the very first parable (50). Again, the problem exists that one cannot recognize the believer by his generosity, his euergetism. Too much prayer and fasting is also harmful; it weakens the body (18.7). To fast is fine, but a moral life is better (54.3–5). One can give the savings of short-term fasting to the poor (56.7). To do more than necessary is praised as leiturgeia (56.2–3), a concept fully established in the embedding society.26 And finally, the positive role 26. Andreau, Schmitt, and Schnapp 1978; Veyne 1988."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"154 Chapter 8of knowledge remains. Ironically, Hermas is criticized again and again for his inexhaustible thirst for knowledge. Only the knowing finally knows whether “God is or not” (12.3). This is a clear religious distinction.Unfortunately, not much is so clear in everyday life. The text itself opens with the extreme example of a sin of thought. Not even Hermas himself knows that he is thinking of adultery on seeing Rhode naked. The divine revelatory figure must draw Hermas’s attention to this fact. The individual needs such a figure, needs a “shepherd,” an “angel of justice,” an “angel of penitence,” because he or she is always endangered by “angels of malice” and the like. The latter wage war within the individual, which the individual cannot win without help. The sixth commandment details this:“Hear now,” he said, “about faith. A person has two angels, one of righ-teousness and the other of wickedness.” “And how, then, Lord,” I asked, “will I know the inner workings of these, since both angels dwell with me?” “Listen,” he said, “and you will understand these things. The angel of righ-teousness is sensitive, modest, meek, and mild. And so, when he rises up in your heart, he immediately speaks with you about righteousness, pu-rity, reverence, contentment, every upright deed, and every glorious virtue. When all these things rise up in your heart, realize that the angel of righ-teousness is with you. These are the works of the angel of righteousness. Trust this one, therefore, and his works. See now also the works of the angel of wickedness. First of all, he is irascible, bitter, and senseless, and his works are wicked, bringing ruin on the slaves of God. And so, when this one rises up in your heart, recognize him from his works.” “I do not understand, Lord,” I said, “how to perceive him.” “Listen,” he replied. “When any iras-cibility or bitterness should fall on you, realize that he is in you. Then there is desire for many activities and numerous extravagant food and drinking bouts and many wild parties and various completely unnecessary luxuries, and desires for women and greed and a certain great haughtiness and ar-rogance, and everything that is closely connected to these things.” (36.1–5)This is more than an ethical message. The text also presents a strategy of communication and participates in such a strategy. The question of good and evil is not just an act of accounting and balancing, but a biographi-cal process that can be narrated. “Turning around” is not a unique, dra-matic event, but an ongoing struggle. The text illustrates and enacts this in its ever-new approaches to the same ethical problems. Just as the visionary"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Instructing Literary Practice in The Shepherd of Hermas 155stimulus was decisive for Hermas, the representation of this process, the narrated vision, could become the stimulus for Hermas’s addressees.Text as a Religious PracticeIn its biographical dimension—in its movement through rooms, through time, and through social constellations—the text describes a religious prac-tice. It formulates the mode of its reception through multiple references to distribution and writing. Writing the text is, therefore, described as part of the religious practice of the narrator and protagonist called “Hermas.” This is not about a unique action. Although we do not have any testimo-nials for how long the author worked on the text as it is transmitted, a pe-riod longer than a year is affirmed in the book of visions (5.1). The text may in fact, in its different layers, reflect the work of several years and multi-ple attempts to convey the visionary insights, primarily, in the additions and corrections necessitated by the author’s patron (but perhaps not by the presbyters—at least we do not hear of such). In subsequent layers, rework-ing is also suggested by theological modifications, the use of images, and in their interpretations.The resulting text invited its audience to engage in individual religious practice and offered itself for appropriation by any of those in situations that are not described as entirely hopeless. It is significant for its reception that the book was recommended by the canon Muratori for private read-ing, not for recitation in an official ritual setting:We receive only the apocalypses of John and Peter, though some of us are not willing that the latter be read in church. But Hermas wrote the Shep-herd very recently, in our times, in the city of Rome, while bishop Pius, his brother, was occupying the chair of the church of the city of Rome. And therefore it ought indeed to be read; but it cannot be read publicly to the people in church either among the prophets, whose number is complete, or among the apostles, for it is after [their] time.

For this work on oneself (a metonym that does not appear in The Shepherd) the text continu-ally offered new images, parables, and knowledge. The repeated reading of the text was a religious practice. Such ancient texts, as John Dagenais’s characterizes medieval manuscripts, “engage the reader, not so much in the unraveling of meaning as in a series of ethical meditations and of per-sonal ethical choices.”29 Evidently, many accepted this invitation, as my brief review of the processes of distribution and translation has shown.However, other individuals necessarily mediated between author and reader. The female patron mentioned at the beginning of the text, copy-ists and translators, book traders, and their customers and financiers. The offer made by the text was not only determined by demand but also by supply, by the readiness to copy the text so that it could be disseminated. This included adapting it to the audience, both through translation and stylistic adjustments; the text of the fourth-century Codex Sinaiticus was much more literary and less popular than that of the third-century Michi-gan Codex.30 The text itself suggested that these activities, too, should be understood as religious practice, both for one’s own benefit—such multi-pliers were also users of their texts31—and as a way to share one’s time and means with the poor but trained listeners or even readers among fellow believers.Hermas’s visions are, in short, available to us as a phenomenon of a specific textual quality.

In the expand-ing communicative space of the Hellenistic period and the principate, writ-ing was regarded as a resource of power, and copying books could express allegiance, whether this took the form of copying Epicurus in Campania, rewriting the Bible at Rome, or copying Hermas in Oxyrhynchos. The copying of these texts did not aim primarily at public reading but allowed for and called for individual practice, for which it was important to have them in an easily accessible library, if not one’s own. In terms of book cul-ture, I do not see any significant distinction between Jews and Christians, or Greeks and Romans.32 But I do think that one can detect chronological differences and developments: by the third century AD, the practices of reading and copying were much more widespread and important for re-ligion than they were in the third century BC.

In later chapters I hope I have demonstrated that lived religion and individual appropriations need not be sought at the margins of orthodox religious practices, in the niches of civic religion. These phenomena are identifiable at the heart of rituals like praying, vowing, dedicating, and reading. We have observed interesting individuals in their role as authors, but this is by no means a new approach. However, these authors, in very different ways, reflect on individual appropriation of religion among their contemporaries, and they offer these reflections to their readership or au-diences. Whereas Propertius remains in the role of the distant observer of a traditional religious role (albeit not without criticism, as 4.1 makes clear), and Ovid follows him in this, Hermas urgently pursues distribution and thereby opens up new religious roles for his recipients.

Ancient distinctions of this nature cease to be of primary importance when we focus on lived ancient religion and the individual.
