First and foremost our debts and gratitude go to our entire team of authors. Without scholars ready to analyze even the strangest issues in witch-hunt historiography this kind of book would have been impossible. Furthermore, we all have received support and advice from several fellow explorers in many countries, who assisted us in developing new approaches. We do not, however, pretend to give an account of every new aspect in the field. Writers of this work aspire to present an update on some critical developments in the writing of witch-hunt histories.Three institutions in Tampere made a major contribution to this endeavor. The School of Social Sciences and Humanities (University of Tampere) created a productive milieu for our purposes. Likewise, Profes-sor of History at the University of Tampere Pertti Haapala, the head of the Finnish Centre of Excellence in Historical Research (Academy of Finland), gave us enormous support. We have also received extremely important assistance from the Tampere-based project “Confessionalist Lutheran Orthodoxy in Seventeenth-Century Sweden” (Academy of Finland).For practical reasons we refrain from listing the long catalogue of names of those with whom we have been discussing the subject dur-ing the years of writing about witch-hunt histories, and whose remarks have been immensely beneficial. However, it should be mentioned that practical help was needed to provide the finishing touches to the work of the specialists in the genre. For the language check we are grateful to dr. Philip Line (Helsinki) and Mr. Leevi Laine (Brighton and Tampere). Furthermore, the labor demanded in editing and turning our work into the finished product would certainly have exceeded our strengths without the very adept assistance of Ms. Matleena Sopanen (Tampere) and our editors in Leiden at Brill.Finally, we are deeply grateful to our families and friends, including those outside academic circles, for all they have said and done in one way or another to buttress our mission.Tampere, February 28, 2013Marko Nenonen Raisa Maria Toivo"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"CONTRiBUTORSdr.

The panics, instigated by the new witchcraft theories in the early modern period (1450–1750), are seen at the very least as a history of social exclusion and cynical exploitation, and frequently as a phenomenon characterized by persecution, bigotry, irrational hatred and violence. What witch-hunt historiography did not acknowledge before the late twentieth century was the fact that despite the horrors of the large witch panics that occurred in Europe and in some parts of North America, such panics were relatively rare. Moreover, the number of death sentences, once believed to be in the hundreds of thousands or even mil-lions, has in more realistic studies plummeted to 40,000 to 60,000.1 In a three hundred-year period of European history, that figure is not excep-tional; higher numbers of people were sentenced to death for various other crimes. Whereas the scandalous atrocities of witchcraft trials easily attract the attention of historians and their audience, a strictly neutral standpoint is needed for the purpose of research in order to examine all sides of the phenomenon and acknowledge the subtleties and diversity of interpretations.It is not only the witch persecutions that have attracted the inter-est of succeeding generations; the secrets of magic and the mysteries of the supernatural also intrigue the modern mind, making witch-hunts, as a historians’ subject, especially fascinating. In fact, the secrets of aca-demic witch-hunt historiography are as enthralling as the phenomenon it attempts to explain. This book focuses on the history of witch-hunt his-toriography. An analytical reconsideration of the research history is an 1 Cf. Wolfgang Behringer, “Neun Millionen Hexen. Entstehung, Tradition und Kritik eines populären Mythos,” GWU 49 (1998): 664–685.

Scholars are not immune to pre-conditioned cultural and ideological assumptions, many of which, usually the most fundamental, are subconscious. Analysis of past research is a constructive tool to spark new approaches. Indeed, this book is not about to repeat what is already known about the European witch-hunts. Much has been written on the issue,2 but relatively little effort has been made to analyze how witch-hunts have been studied and explained in academic research. Approaches and explanations have varied. This book is one of the rare analytical studies on the history of witch-hunt historiography. The history of witch-hunt research fundamentally contributes not only to our understanding of a bizarre phenomenon in European history, but also allows us to better understand the cultural and academic trends which have powerfully influenced research, even when scholars have not been cognizant of the underlying premises of their own work. How the history of witch-hunts has been represented in scholarly works and textbooks illuminates the prerequisites and cultural directives which have guided research in the field. Indeed, it is possible that the trends within witch-hunt historiography reflect general developments in humanities, although this issue is only remotely touched upon here.Two approaches will be adopted in this book. Firstly, an analytical account of some historiographical issues that have been of great impor-tance within the field will be presented. Secondly, new and potentially productive aspects of the historical problem will be introduced and put forward for further discussion. This book is about challenging the current canon. Therefore, it concentrates on the themes that we think will offer the most promising avenues for further research.Naturally, there are many focal issues that we have not been able to cover. Without question there is a need for a historiographical analysis of the history of magic in general. Following Hugh R. Trevor-Roper’s lead, historians have been more interested in the panic-inspired trials than in the beliefs, let alone experiences, of witchcraft. The beliefs that have been under scrutiny have largely been those related to diabolic witchcraft, the pact with the devil and the witches’ sabbath. Starting in the 1970s, 2 Among others, see Bengt Ankarloo and Stuart Clark, The Athlone History of Witchcraft and Magic in Europe, vol. 1–6 (London: The Athlone Press, 1999–2002); Wolfgang Behringer, Witches and Witch-Hunts.

However, relatively few scholars have studied magic apart from some who have pro-duced works dedicated to medieval high magic.3 We have focused, very narrowly indeed, on the witch-hunt historiography—an extensive subject in and of itself. To broaden the theme here would have been impossible, although some possible directions for a productive understanding of the historiography of magic in general have been suggested in this volume. It seems to us that an understanding of the history and nature of witchcraft and magic is in no way a peripheral question in the intellectual and social history of Europe.As regards the focus of this work, witch-hunt historiography within the narrow geographical perspective of a conventional standpoint, has led to many false generalizations and assumptions. In the following articles the standard perspective is put in a new context. However, a much wider lens is needed to encompass the full significance of the geographical issues. People believed to be witches have been condemned practically every-where. Even though we have re-evaluated the “Eurocentric” approach—or, more precisely, the “western European paradigm”, as Marko Nenonen refers to it in his article—we regret that we have not been able to spread the net wider. Byzantine magic, the regions of eastern Europe in which the Orthodox Churches held sway (of which we cover only Russia), the Middle and Far East, Africa and South America, are barely covered in scholarly works. In our defence, the theories of diabolic witchcraft are 3 Here only to mention some classic works close to witch-hunt studies: Keith Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1988; originally pub-lished in 1971); Norman Cohn, Europe’s Inner Demons (New York: Basic Books, 1975); Richard Kieckhefer, European Witch Trials: Their Foundations in Popular and Learned Cul-ture, 1300–1500 (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1976); Gábor Klaniczay, The Uses of Supernatural Power.

This may not be an adequate defence, however, as we ourselves demonstrate that diabolic witchcraft was not wholly dominant even in Europe. In any case, understanding the concepts of witches and witch trials in all their diversity demands a broad geographical standpoint. We believe that we have exposed the diversity of witch trials in Europe, although we freely admit that that is not enough. The situation varied hugely even within Europe; how much could be writ-ten, for example, if the traditions in China, Japan, Siberia or North Africa were taken into account? We humbly hope that future research will widen the perspective still further.Our scope has also been restricted in two other ways. The extent to which scholarly trends in witch-hunt historiography reflect the approaches and prerequisites in other fields of historical research or the humanities will remain an open question. In the following articles writers present some remarks on the issue, but it is too huge to allow a thorough explo-ration here. Finally, it was not possible to give a full account of a theme"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" challenging the paradigm of witch-hunt historiography 5that is possibly the most difficult and most controversial in this context: the role of Christian religion in guiding research on the history of magic and witchcraft. This issue, too, covers the whole field of the humanities and even social sciences. We expect new openings in this field to appear alongside future research and we will be more than happy if some direc-tions suggested in the following articles are explored further.Such has been the potency of witchcraft as a phenomenon that it has drawn the attention of the public, politicians and a variety of academic scholars in different fields of discipline, from history to political science and medicine, and from anthropology and religious science to language studies and literature. It has also exerted a powerful pull in the world of the arts as the subject of literature, films and cartoons. This variety of sources of interest has ensured that different methodologies have emerged, leading to diverse conclusions. In many ways this has been advantageous: although the approaches of social and legal history have long dominated the study of witchcraft, its historiography has been truly an interdisci-plinary effort. Most works have adopted a more or less multidisciplinary standpoint, which originally started with combining the reading of court documents—typical for historians—with anthropology and religious studies in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. As a consequence, ideas and developments in various scholarly fields meet in the study of the history of witchcraft and witch-hunts, igniting new ideas, sparking collisions and creating syntheses. This alone gives a strong incentive for a historiographical analysis of witch-hunt historiography. An understanding of how European witch-hunts have been explained and how the social and cultural trends have affected the research in question will be invaluable for further research.Geographies of Witch-HuntsUp until the late twentieth century, witchcraft historiography focused mainly on the mass persecutions in the areas usually referred to collectively as western Europe.4 The panics or “witch hysteria” in German-speaking areas, mostly parts of the Holy Roman Empire, and some of the other western European regions, have come to represent the “European” phe-nomenon, a development that occurred alongside the continued political 4 More on the geographical classifications, see Marko Nenonen’s article below."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"6 marko nenonen and raisa maria toivoimportance of these regions. Dramatic witch panics have been consid-ered central to the research since the latter half of the nineteenth century. There were also several mass trials in some French-speaking areas, not to mention waves of mass panics in the Basque regions of Spain, Scotland and some areas of Sweden; however, in most regions of Europe mass pan-ics were either sporadic or non-existent.It is crucial to understand the development of the mass panics, which, as regards European witch trials in general, are no more than half the truth, at most. For a long time scholars emphasized diabolical witchcraft as explicated in the new witchcraft theories. The debate of the origin of the new witchcraft theories has been long, wide and continuous, although the present state of research seems to have determined that new witch-craft theories were created by the learned elite in the late Middle Ages or at the beginning of the early modern period. Naturally, witches were thought to fly to the witches’ sabbath. However, this was not the most frequent accusation made against the suspects, probably not even in the areas of modern-day Germany where most panics took place. It is possible that the new witchcraft theories, i.e. the heretical nature of witchcraft, was emphasized by the witch-hunt historians because they viewed some cen-tral European areas as “proper Christian Europe”. Peripheries in general were of minor interest as they were thought to be politically and cultur-ally less influential. The everyday magic and superstitions of the ordinary people—often called “low magic”—was something very different than the literati’s sophisticated analyses of the pact with the devil, apostasy and, of course, sexual activities on the witches’ sabbath. As Marko Nenonen puts it in his conclusions, later generations of witch-hunt historians followed the example of inquisitors and the learned people who chiefly wrote about new heretical witchcraft—incidentally something that they themselves created in their treatises. Witch-hunts, often understood in the sense of cumulative mass trials, were a different thing from the small-scale and sporadic trials that involved a limited number of accused persons; for one thing, discussion of witch-hunts alone conceals the fact that a consider-able number of the accused, often the majority, were acquitted.The emphasis on mass panics in some western European areas has led to the omission of many important questions from the canons of witch-craft studies. For example, experiences with religions other than Catholi-cism or Protestantism in southern and eastern Europe have been left aside. Furthermore, the question of ethnicity has also been neglected, although it is an important issue in the regions where native people met alien ruling"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" challenging the paradigm of witch-hunt historiography 7Map 1.1.

Additionally, the northern peripher-ies were long discounted because it was wrongly believed— commensurate with the popular images—that with the exception of Swedish mass pan-ics, not many witch trials took place in the remote wildernesses of north-ern Europe. Actually, it was a Finn, Antero Heikkinen, who published the first modern work on witch-hunts in 1969.5 In his study, the new approach involving social and mental history was developed. Of course, his attempt to compare his findings with other European trends failed for the sim-ple reason that there were no other modern works on the issue at that time except Hugh R. Trevor-Ropers’ essay of 1967 (1969). Alan Macfarlane (1970), Keith Thomas (1971), E. William Monter (1971, also 1976) and Bengt Ankarloo’s (1971) epoch-making volumes appeared within two years, fol-lowed by the works of H. C. Erik Midelfort (1972), Zoltán Kovács (1973) and Russell Zguta (1977).6One should not forget that among the worst witch panics were those that occurred in Vardø, in the far north of Norway (then subject to Den-mark), on the shores of the Arctic Ocean. The northern and eastern fringes of Europe have been barely considered in current research even though the conference held in Stockholm in 1984, “Centres and Peripheries”, promoted a change.7 Ethnicity and popular representations of the indig-5 Antero Heikkinen, Paholaisen liittolaiset (SHS: Helsinki, 1969).6 H.

Yet Hagen’s statistics show that only 20 percent of the accused witches in Danish Finnmark (modern Norway) were Sami; the majority were Norwe-gian women. This raises the question of whether judicial practice was the same for all people, even in the same regions. Why was Sami magic dealt with differently? The importance of a judicial system that differed from the western European one is also pointed out in Marianna Muravyeva’s article on the historiography of Russian witchcraft. In addition, Raisa Maria Toivo distinctly emphasizes northern material in her comparison of the interpretation of gender in international witchcraft studies with the material from Sweden and Finland.The areas once covered by the Russian empire (later the Soviet Union and modern-day Russia) did indeed produce witch trials and, with the exception of diabolical witchcraft, they bore all the features typical of western European witch-hunts. Furthermore, “the possessed” were still often encountered in the nineteenth century. Marianna Muravyeva dem-onstrates that the revival of the interest in witchcraft research in west-ern Europe and the USA that began in the 1990s sparked a new epoch in witchcraft studies in Russia as well. This phase has produced a new set of questions posed by the differences between Russian and western Euro-pean findings, e.g. why there is a marked presence of male witches and an absence of demonology in Russian witch trials. In many ways legal tradi-tions and jurisdiction in Russia differed from those in western European practices. It is also interesting that scholarly studies on Russian witchcraft and witch trials were already made known in the late nineteenth century, even though the case of Russia was neglected in the majority of twentieth-century research. Some scholars writing on Russian witch trials, such as Zoltán Kovács (1973), were not even mentioned in most works concerning the history of European witch trials.The rapidly increasing emphasis on Nordic witchcraft and, even more so, on the perspective of the eastern and central European areas in the international debate peculiarly coincided with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the consequent disappearance of the socialist world system in Europe, as well as the subsequent enlargement of the European Union. A question thus arises: Did the change of the angle in research take place as a result of pure and genuine scholarly logic and academic curios-ity or simply because of a change in European political and economic geography?"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"10 marko nenonen and raisa maria toivoPopular (Culture) and Academic (Discipline)—Not A One-Way InteractionWhile it is difficult to find a country or a region in Europe where abso-lutely no trials of the panic-induced variety ever took place, historians have found that different areas of Europe hosted differently conducted trials. Indeed, the majority of trials—even in western Europe—were not brought about by the panics. Many times, even during the worst panics, the onset of rumors or the work of witch finders was quickly suppressed in order to prevent the spread of hysteria.8 Interestingly, the history of witch trials has parallels with the history of legal moderation and cultural and religious toleration. The concern for human rights, for example, arose at that time and was, indeed, influenced by witch-hunt treatises.9 We feel that the strong opposition to witch-hunts, demonstrated occasionally in many locations, has received too little recognition from modern witch-hunt scholars—especially in the popular textbooks. Horror stories, which appeal greatly to the common readership, can easily be explained by the concept of the primitive mentality of yesteryear—if one chooses to ignore the fact that many of the people who supposedly had “primitive minds” strongly opposed the violation of the law and witchcraft accusations.The form that the witch trials took depended on many things. The most obvious of these were the judicial circumstances, i.e. the laws and hierar-chies of legal systems that were in place. How a trial proceeded depended on, for example, whether or not the local people had an opportunity to seek solutions to their problems without the members of the elite inter-vening in local affairs. It is clear that most suspicions never reached the courts including, according to Gunnar W. Knutsen, the denunciations received by the Inquisitions in southern Europe. Furthermore, popular beliefs differed, although it is likely that practically all individuals were 8 E.g.

The teachings of the Church were, of course, a crucial factor behind the accusations. Personal concerns and motives, on the other hand, are more difficult to assess.10 Additionally, wars and the presence of foreign troops frequently affected the jurisdiction. Another aspect worth noting—one that has received relatively little attention—is the pragmatics of religious and social life as related to witchcraft and magic. The diversity of all these issues was, indeed, huge. Although it is alluring to speak about European culture and mentality, there may not have been such a thing. What people considered as witchcraft, magic, or otherwise suspicious activity differed from area to area and, to a great extent, it changed with the passage of time. Judicial practices were con-stantly changing. Although modern research has made some ambitious attempts to summarize these differences in a concise form,11 not much has appeared in which the history of the witch-hunt historiography has been thoroughly analyzed. Why have rigorous comparisons been so few?There has been little research on the possible political, religious, or social and cultural issues that may have affected research schemes. Tunnel vision in scholarly convention has also hampered creativity. Charles Zika demonstrates that for a long time scholars thought of visual art almost exclusively as an elite expression of culture. Zika shows how the study of witchcraft images slowly spread from one German artist to famous Dutch and Flemish artists and gradually came to include more vivid material. Through this process a more methodological insight and breadth was gained. For social and legal historians who prefer written documents, pictures function simply as book decorations to please the publisher and appeal to the broader readership. As if to demonstrate this, the covers of witch history books have been rather uninventive and derivative. At best, witch-hunt historians have seen pictures as mirrors of social reality or expressions of individual fantasies. Zika and his fellow art historians have gone much deeper, as they see images of witches and witchcraft as part of the contemporary discourse on witchcraft.Themes such as ethnicity and colonialism within Europe were also relevant to popular beliefs and to the way people dealt with witchcraft. 10 Few works on this issue have appeared. See, however, Marko Nenonen, “Who Bears the Guilt for the Persecution of Witches,” Studia Neophilologica 84, supplement 1 (2012). www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00393274.2012.668072. 11 See note 2 above."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"12 marko nenonen and raisa maria toivoSometimes religious and social toleration prevailed and harsh punish-ments were avoided for practical reasons, or simply to maintain social peace. Moreover, accepted and mundane everyday magic, often ridiculed in jokes, existed side by side with the horrible and forbidden diaboli-cal witchcraft that we usually think of when witchcraft comes to mind. In addition to Rune Hagen and Gunnar W. Knutsen, who address the issues of ethnicity at the northern and southern edges of Europe, Mari-anna Muravyeva and Raisa Maria Toivo discuss the differences in judicial practices regarding different people. The western European emphasis has led scholars to concentrate almost exclusively on the western European concepts of justice. The discussion has, quite rightly, revolved around the issues of accusatorial and inquisitorial legal systems and, furthermore, has explicated the legal traditions from Canon Law to the Germanic law codes and from written laws to orally based customs which early modern Europe still fostered. However, as important as these questions are, they leave aside many other issues. In particular, cultural concepts of crimes such as witchcraft need more attention than has so far been the case. Why are some crimes and their perpetrators important at a certain time and in a particular society? As Muravyeva and Toivo explain, the legal defini-tions of, for example, witchcraft, blasphemy and rape differed according to region. European-wide comparisons would shed light on these issues and help to explain how they relate to other factors, such as wealth, reli-gion and the state, as well as trade and communications and the dispersal patterns of ideas and influences. Witch-hunts were thus not only a phe-nomenon of mass destruction, religious or social prejudice and backward mental states; many other factors were also present.Furthermore, the conventions of legal and judicial systems may have meant that certain groups of people could not be prosecuted due to their social status, their lack of legal capacities in general or their status as prop-erty owners. Paradoxically, the very same group of people may well have been considered witches, but witches that had to be dealt with outside the courts. Sometimes, therefore, trials and tractates reveal as much through their omissions as through their words. This point of view deserves more attention in witchcraft historiography, although care should be taken when drawing inferences ex silentio. In all, these factors both reflected and influenced the way people thought about and dealt with these matters. Not all witch trials took place under the model circumstances standard-ized in witch-hunt historians’ works.There were vast differences within Europe regarding what was consid-ered and judged as witchcraft and who these matters concerned. Some of"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" challenging the paradigm of witch-hunt historiography 13these differences most likely arose from variations in law and legal con-ventions. Many of the differences may appear greater than they actually were because scholars have studied them differently and with different standards. The fact that witch-hunt historians do not have many com-mon denominators in their approaches may reflect not only the great diversity of the phenomenon and the creative mind of each scholar but also the lack of discipline in research work. Clearly, horror story narratives without an analytical grip are not enough in academic research. Yet we think that there are differences in approaches that perhaps cannot to be explained in an obvious way such as deep cultural variations, patterns of social interaction, the position of women, traditions and communications and, of course, how witchcraft as well as the spiritual world in general was understood.Strikingly, these questions have received dichotomous interpretations in modern political circles—and, indeed, we find similarities between the old and new. The fact that radical right-wing feminism in the USA often advocated a total dismissal of the state is unsurprising. On the other hand, the modern social democratic women historians in the Nordic countries, despite their strong adherence to the welfare state, see the state and legal machinery of the seventeenth century as heavily oppressive—just as their right-wing sisters in the modern USA understood the nature of the state in the modern era. Furthermore, in Soviet historiography, witch trials were understood as class oppression of the poor or as persecutions of discon-tented pre-revolutionaries being attacked by the ruling class.Popular culture forms a platform on which scholars, with their findings and explanations, meet their non-academic audience. Within popular culture—fiction books, films, art, cartoons, etc.—scholarly findings will always be reinterpreted. Such a relationship between academic scholar-ship and wider society is natural. It is never a one-way interaction in the sense that the learned elite dictates what is believed and understood. Yet in witch-hunt historiography, images of popular culture were for a long time mightier than the research itself; it is evident that popular images of witch-hunts affected scholars in this academic field perhaps more than in any other. In fact, from the very beginning popular interpretations of witch-hunts highly politicized the understanding of the phenomenon con-cerning the role of religion and the Church, social and legal control, pov-erty, gender, terror and ethnicity and race. Instead of critically analyzing these popular images of witchcraft and witch-hunts, researchers tended to take the assumptions underlying them as self-evident and were guided by them until more thorough investigations into the primary documents"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"14 marko nenonen and raisa maria toivowere made in the late twentieth century. At the end of this book Ron-ald Hutton gives a provocative insight into witchcraft in popular culture today. Do we study our dreams, imagination or what? What, exactly, did a witch represent in the past, and what does the concept of a witch signify to us today?There is one field of witch-hunt studies which is likely to gain increas-ing attention in the near future, but which has so far been very difficult to handle or even to name: the question of guilt. Historians are usually, and very rightly, reluctant to blame people for their actions in history. Historians prefer to understand rather than condemn. Yet current devel-opments do not allow us to escape the issue so easily. What was the role of the individual in hysterical waves of terror? This question has always been part of investigations into the Holocaust, for example. Ethnic, reli-gious and political violence has not left people untouched even in the modern western world. In witch-hunt historiography the question of guilt instinctively follows, however much one would like to ignore it. The same, of course, has been true when researching the Holocaust, although it seems that in that case it has been much easier to find the perpetrators. In history, we believe, the role of the individual is essential; it seems very unlikely that any specific social or ideological structures can explain the wrongdoings that individuals decide to commit. Are we likely to choose a political explanation whenever it suits us? Is it easier to explain ter-rible things by neutral, structural factors when we want to hide our guilt? The subjects of fear, persecution and guilt are touched upon in the follow-ing articles. Yet the relative moderation of many trials and, moreover, the streaks of toleration that occurred every now and then even during the witch panics are worth noticing when thinking of the role of individuals in persecutions and terror.* * *We do not pretend to answer all the questions we have posed here or those that may be posed by others who read this volume. Nor do we pretend to give a full account of the history of witchcraft historiography. Rather, scholars in this work aspire to give an update on some critical developments in the writing of the history of witchcraft and witch trials. Witch-hunt historians encounter a challenge: although reading the court case records is essential, the furthering of research and the finding of new leads is required for a productive analysis of witch-hunt historiog-raphy.

At the end of the twentieth century it became clear that research into the history of the witch-hunt has been stranger still. for over a century scholars had been explaining a phenomenon that never existed.The british historian hugh redwald Trevor-roper (1914–2003), who studied and researched at oxford and cambridge universities, became known beyond the boundaries of academia for at least two things. in the 1980s, having examined the supposed Adolf hitler diaries, he declared them to be genuine, but they were shown to be a bad forgery soon afterwards.1 he was also known as the historian of the european witch-hunts, as his work, The European Witch-Craze of the 16th and 17th Centuries (1969/1967)2 was for a long time the most important, and indeed for most students, the only work used as a general source and in lecture series, so that its main features were considered sound by those who did not research the witch-hunt themselves.Trevor-roper stated in his book that the general outline of the witch persecutions was already familiar from earlier research. All that was needed was a new and up-to-date explanation. in fact, the youngest of the writers referred to in his overview, the German scholar Joseph hansen, had been born in 1862, a century before Trevor-roper returned to the matter. hansen’s works have remained classics in the field of witch-hunts, but in the mid-1970s it was found that he had accepted as genuine a col-lection of sources that told of medieval witch trials, for a long time consid-ered trustworthy but actually nineteenth-century forgeries.3 Despite this, the majority of hansen’s collections are still considered dependable.1 on h. r.

The infamous piece of work by heinrich Kramer (institoris), Malleus Maleficarum (1486 or 1487),4 which instructed in the investigation of witchcraft, is mentioned in many works on the history of the witch persecutions. however, it is clear that many of these researchers had not read Malleus Maleficarum, since it was not noted that in the origi-nal Latin text of the work almost every third witch mentioned was of the masculine gender. These references must therefore be to male witches, or male and female witches. strangest of all was that it was not scholars researching the witch-hunts that made this observation, but writers from outside the field. The problem was exposed by Lara Apps and Andrew Gow in their work, Male Witches in Early Modern Europe (2003).5 Their observation was a surprise when we note that Malleus Maleficarum had been considered the bible of misogynist churchmen.of the works written by inquisitors and theologians, Malleus Malefi-carum was not the only one that mentioned male witches and men practicing witchcraft. interestingly, in some of these works male witches are mentioned more frequently than female.6 in addition, it surely can-not have escaped attention that men as well as women were prosecuted during the era of witch trials. how is it possible that a central question in witchcraft research had been handled so badly as late as the end of the twentieth century? in much of the research the very idea of male witches in the early modern period had been considered almost a cat-egorical impossibility.7 if such a huge mistake could be made about such a 4 heinrich Kramer (institoris), Der Hexenhammer.

And this is indeed the case. The earlier gen-erally accepted picture had typically dominated almost the whole modern era of witch-hunt research, for nearly 150 years.8 Where this idea origi-nated, however, is a question that has only recently been addressed.Were the Accused Poor?The stereotypical witch is a woman who serves the devil and flies to the witches’ sabbath. yet the stereotype has other features which fit either poorly or not at all to those who were actually accused. from its very beginning another powerful stereotype of the witch persecution appeared in its historiography: those accused of witchcraft were described and explained as “different”. This is natural, as it seems only logical to argue that the accused must have been different in some way, some ending up persecuted and others not. This view suggests that the victims were guilty, but is it credible that the victims of persecution, in one way or another, always provided some reason for their accusation?Aside from being females, the most important characteristic of witches is said to have been poverty. As early as 1971, long before there had been much detailed research, Keith Thomas stated that the accused were poor and usually women.9 Poverty has also been one of the most important reasons given as an explanation for the persecutions. but what evidence has been presented to show that more often than not the accused were poor? An examination of international research on the matter shows clearly that detailed studies on the issue based on the original documen-tary sources and methodological analysis have been very rare. The matter has often been considered only in a few individual cases. however, those works in which the poverty of the accused is argued have handled the 8 The first studies in which the witch trials were explained using the methods of mod-ern source criticism appeared in the first half of the nineteenth century.

According to him, midwives and tavern-keepers were “often” accused.10 “often” is an undefined concept, especially in research, and Midelfort pro-vided no further analysis or material. it was not clear from his work how often or how reliably the social status of the accused appeared in the trial records, or what proportion of the accused were midwives and tavern-keepers. nevertheless, Midelfort emphasized that the widely held stereo-types of the accused disintegrated during the witch-hunts and resulting court cases and that those who were accused came from widely different groups of society—among them many men.in addition to Midelfort, another modern-day classic in the field of witch-hunt research, e.

The majority of those accused may also have been poor, but, given that Monter had included (in addition to widows) manual workers, craftspeople and others who did not belong to the ranked society of their locality, the assessment of what constituted poverty became too wide. he did not handle the question more closely, nor make the basis for his con-clusions clear. besides, in every second case his records say nothing of the accused person’s status.11The norwegian hans eyvind næss (1982) has long since presented the people accused in the witch-hunts as “often the poorest members of their society”.12 næss claims that economic conflict and social tension explain 10 h. c. erik Midelfort, Witch Hunting in Southwestern Germany 1562–1684 (stanford: stanford university Press, 1972), 7–8, 195.

Largely through the help of tax records, it has been possible to conclude that the social status of the accused in witchcraft and sorcery trials in the region of present-day finland did not generally diverge from that of the rest of the populace. More interesting is that the social status of the accused, informers and plaintiffs—those who did not belong to the administration—often seemed to be similar.

The sus-pect did not have to be a professional seer or a social outcast. Many magi-cal practices were general, and it was believed that anyone could have the ability to do harmful witchcraft.16it has to be noted that social status was perhaps not an important factor in giving rise to witchcraft trials. Many of the concerns related above about a past lack of detailed research also apply to the possible links between other personal matters and accusations of witchcraft. Were the accused more often married than unmarried, or more frequently young than old, or were there other factors in their circumstances that distinguished them in terms of the demand for social conformity? There has been no research done on these matters that could provide a basis for generalizations. on the basis of what has been observed in various studies, it seems that the majority of those accused were married. This in itself is an interesting observance, as at that time in western europe and in the areas where witch-trials were concentrated, there were large numbers of unmarried people.17 These considerations demolish the generally accepted mantra about the witch-hunts.The Popularity of the “Scapegoat Theory” and Its ProblemsThe view that the witch persecutions can be explained by the poverty of the accused became generally established after the second World War, although there have been other explanatory models.18 Various accounts the statistical material is left out for practical reasons. Also, according to heikkinen (Paho-laisen liittolaiset, 254–255, 388), the accused were not the poorest of all, although his infor-mation comes only from part of Pohjanmaa.16 nenonen, Noituus, taikuus, 162–163, 222. This conclusion has since been strength-ened in other studies. for instance, see robin briggs, Witches & Neighbors.

The bases for these explanations can be divided into two main groups: the first assumes that for some rea-son poor and deprived people made easy scapegoats when explanations were needed for events and phenomena which could not otherwise be explained—or for which factual explanations were not wanted or sought. According to the second model, something in the behavior or lifestyle of the accused made him or her a relatively easy object of fear and hatred. This behavior could have been, for instance, persistent begging, unper-mitted anti-christian actions, or simply a suspicious method of curing ill people.Modern witch-hunts in different countries have also been explained using the scapegoat theory. one of the best-known models is clyde Kluck-hohn’s (1905–1960) research into the accusations of witchcraft among the navajo in 1930s north America. According to Kluckhohn, social problems caused stress and disputes, which brought about the accusations. ulti-mately, the problems of the navajo arose because their way of life was being eroded by the lifestyle of the majority, and this increased distress and internal discord. belief in witchcraft and accusations of it provided an outlet for aggression and conflict, which Kluckhohn considered an impor-tant factor.19This is a functional explanatory model.20 According to this model, the belief in witchcraft has some function or purpose in society, which assists the survival of society and its individuals and the maintenance of social order, although it is partly, or in some respects wholly, disorderly or dysfunctional. Witch-hunt researchers have often discussed the model that Alan Macfarlane developed in his work Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England (1970). According to him the victims of witchcraft were more frequently from wealthier families than those who bewitched them. Macfarlane explained that the developing capitalist society and mode of 19 clyde Kluckhohn, Navaho Witchcraft (boston: beacon Press, 1944), 85, 88–90, and other pages.20 briefly, on its background in witch-hunt research, see: T.

As a consequence it was no longer possible to assist the poor as earlier, due to impoverishment—which Macfarlane assumed to have occurred.21 According to him this explained, for example, the friction that arose over begging.The originality of Macfarlane’s thesis lies in its psychological empha-sis. According to Macfarlane, witchcraft accusations arose from bad con-sciences when people knew they should help beggars but were unable or unwilling to do so. They assuaged their guilt by convincing themselves that a witch had avenged their refusal to help. in this way they suffered their punishment and the guilt for breaking a good practice was easier to carry. According to Macfarlane’s explanatory model, the accusation of witchcraft was the shifting of guilt to the weaker party.22 however, not long afterwards Alan Macfarlane rejected his own theory. in a new work, The Origins of English Individualism (1978), he concluded the opposite, with the quite natural view that individuality was no new phenomenon and that witch-hunts could not, therefore, be linked to the birth of capi-talism. on the whole, said Macfarlane, the idea of an unchanging rural society is an illusion of later generations.23The scapegoat theory was also upheld by the German historian Wolf-gang behringer. he argued that in the witch-hunts of bavaria, modern southern Germany, the persecutions intensified after the bad harvests.24 behringer placed more emphasis on general setbacks and collective expe-rience than Macfarlane, who saw the matter from the standpoint of indi-vidual decisions. The basic idea behind the scapegoat theory is that bad and especially deteriorating conditions give birth to stress and anxiety, which increase and worsen competition and conflict, which then lead to 21 Alan Macfarlane, Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England (London: routledge & Kegan Paul, 1970), 195–198, 200 ff., and on poverty, see also 150–151, 155 and 164.22 Macfarlane’s explanatory model had a powerful influence on his teacher Keith Thomas. compare Keith Thomas, “The relevance of social Anthropology to the historical study of english Witchcraft,” in Witchcraft Confessions and Accusations, ed.

Whether this theory is right or wrong is impos-sible to say here, nor is it important in this connection. There are no detailed studies to show regular links between charges of witchcraft and economic setbacks or times of crisis, and behringer’s conclusions are not unambiguous.25The chronology of witchcraft and sorcery trials alone makes one sus-picious of generalizations. Trials increased and decreased in intensity simultaneously in different parts of europe. The coincidence is especially noticeable in western europe, including the German-speaking regions and switzerland, and to some extent southwestern europe. Trials became common in the mid-fifteenth century, after which they diminished in number, whereupon the number increased again in the mid-sixteenth century, in sweden as well. There were an especially large number of trials for witchcraft and sorcery in europe at the end of the sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth centuries. subsequently there were fewer in most of western europe, but in the swedish empire (including finland), for instance, the greatest witch-hunts occurred as late as the second half of the seventeenth century. in some areas, such as russia, Poland and hungary, there were an exceptional number of trials in the eighteenth century. Also, many trials in sweden continued into the second half of the 1700s.furthermore, given that witchcraft trials were different, is it credible that economic discord and crises were behind all types of witchcraft-related events? researchers have referred to ideas of a new type of witch-craft that arose in the Middle Ages and early modern period as “diabolical witchcraft” (Hexerei), or “serving the devil”, as opposed to traditional harmful witchcraft and magic intended to do good. Diabolical witchcraft, which refers to the intention of making a pact with the devil, was a new practice and a new crime. by contrast, beliefs about methods of harmful witchcraft and well-intentioned magic were ancient. harmful witchcraft was an ancient crime, evidenced abundantly in trials from the Middle Ages. Magical practices deemed un-christian were forbidden in different parts of europe by the 1500s at the latest, although the trial methods were not in any way unified. Magical practices had possibly been punishable earlier within the church.25 behringer himself states (Witchcraft Persecutions, 388, 405, note 47) that a direct con-nection between folk beliefs, burnings at the stake and bad harvest years cannot be made. The causal connection between these things remains unclear."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"28 marko nenonenit may be that witch-hunts began in bavaria because of bad harvest years. it is equally possible that mass witch trials spread for different rea-sons than those which caused the first panics. furthermore, it could also be that in some places economic setbacks were linked to the accusations and in other places different circumstances were decisive. it is certain that most accidents and setbacks, even in bad circumstances, did not lead to witch-hunts. in addition, competition over the successful produc-tion and profits from good times might have been as severe as the battle against setbacks in bad times. it is also difficult to demonstrate that the new witchcraft theories about witches who flew to the sabbath had any connection to social discord. nor is it clear how these accusations might have increased as a result of poverty or discord, even if this might have been the case.usually witch-hunt academics describe the beginning of the early mod-ern period as a time of crisis, when impoverishment of the majority of the population, or at least its poorest section, in addition to wars, disas-ters, diseases and other tribulations, made life difficult. occasionally these images are over-dramatized to the point of imprudence. As an example, the idea that poor people as a whole became poorer during the three hun-dred years (c. 1450–1750) of witch trials is ludicrous and explains nothing. The more positive aspects of the period are not mentioned: developments in the natural sciences and technology, widening education and the growth of literature, for example, alongside the beginning of the enlight-enment, fit badly with the witch-hunts. The persecutions were at their most intense during the lifetime of Galileo Galilei (1564–1642).There is no explanation as to why suspicions of witchcraft grew and increased in the courts that is unanimously accepted by researchers, nor is it clear that there is a single explanation for the phenomenon, although scholars seek one to this day. Traditionally, in scholarly explanations it is the custom to identify necessary conditions (preconditions) and a suf-ficient condition (or a final cause) that releases a chain of events.26 The necessary conditions (preconditions) for the rise of the witch-hunts might be general social, political or ideological ones. They could involve changes in clerical thought, judicial practices or social discord. The sufficient con-dition (final reason), which sets in motion the accusations and leads to 26 see Wesley c. salmon, Causality and Explanation (oxford: oxford university Press, 1998), 34, 147–148. for a less academic treatment, see robert Audi, ed., The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy (cambridge: cambridge university Press, 1996/1995), 149."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" the dubious history of the witch-hunts 29judicial proceedings, may be regarded as the decisive factor, but what was it?originally it was thought that the main factors that caused the disputes were economic. however, once the judicial authorities felt it possible to institute proceedings for witchcraft and the pattern of witchcraft trials had been created, any factor could give rise to an individual case. Witch-craft was a vaguely defined crime, which could arise simply on the basis of an imagined event. since it was necessary to speak of injury or crime in court—otherwise the courts would not be convened—the grounds for making the accusation might have no relation to the reason for the indict-ment. This point, it seems to me, has been overlooked in research. several scholars27 have noted that when someone obtained a reason to suspect someone of being a witch, frequently he or she already had the suspect in mind. however, it is difficult to generalize about personal motives in scholarly explanations. scholars tend to emphasize social, ideological or political phenomena or structures as though the actors automatically do the deeds they set in motion. however, emphasis on the social structures easily leads to an underestimation of an individual’s personal motives and decisions. interestingly, the terror campaigns of nazi Germany and the terror in the soviet union before the second World War have often been explained by the personal drive of the dictators. Witch-hunts, on the other hand, are mostly seen as a phenomenon that originated from social and intellectual factors without connection to individuals’ personal motives.28Although it might be thought that rational considerations guide peo-ple’s actions, it remains a problem that what appears sensible to one per-son seems quite senseless to another. Worse still, the reasons a person gives for his actions may not necessarily be true, and it is clear that peo-ple do not always understand their own motives. how, then, should we research people’s actions and the thoughts, desires and beliefs that guide them? This problem is not, of course, confined to research into the witch-hunts, although the explanation of deeds that appear absurd is especially challenging. ultimately, we are left with a question: can the methods of historical research alone provide sufficient explanation?27 Among others: Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic, 652.28 on this issue, see Marko nenonen, “Who bears the Guilt for the Persecution of Witches?” Studia Neophilologica (2012), http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/snec.

Trevor-roper did not believe that everyday magic and supersti-tions had any significance for the general pattern of the witch trials or the explanation for them. he wrote that he was not interested in “mere witch-beliefs” or “those elementary village credulities which anthropolo-gists discover in all times and at all places”. he wanted to research(. . .) the inflammation of those beliefs, the incorporation of them, by edu-cated men, into a bizarre but coherent intellectual system which, at certain socially determined times, gave to otherwise unorganized peasant credulity a centrally directed, officially blessed persecuting force.29nevertheless, Trevor-roper admitted that commonplace magic and super-stition “can be sympathetically studied by those who believe that every illusion, provided it is entertained by the lower classes, is innocent and worthy of respect”.30until the end of the last century it was believed that witchcraft accusa-tions brought in accordance with the new theories were a clear majority 29 Trevor-roper, The European Witch-Craze, 9.30 Trevor-roper, The European Witch-Craze, 9.

Later on, however, suspicion arose that even in western europe, where the largest mass trials took place, more often than not witches, i.e. people accused in witchcraft and sorcery trials, did not fly, had not attended witches’ sabbaths and did not even resemble witches as they were represented in learned witch theories.31 nevertheless, the first scholarly works that came out against the stereotypes of western european witches came from areas considered peripheral and were not thought of as representative. in the era of the witch-hunts, jurists and theologians, and very likely others too, were more interested in diaboli-cal witchcraft than popular and everyday superstition, which many of the learned considered ridiculous even then.Although the limitations of the view were occasionally noted, such observations remained without influence. With considerable foresight, Midelfort (1972) judged that “far more individual witch-trials were recorded than mass witch-trials, even during the period of the great witch-hunts”. he added that although the great mass trials had ended, individual and local witch trials continued after the mid-1700s.32 however, Midelfort had not yet come round to the conclusion that trials which began because of traditional witchcraft or magical practices might have been more com-mon than mass trials brought about by diabolical witchcraft. in his latest works Midelfort nevertheless gives backing to the view that the signifi-cance of mass trials and new witch theories in witch trials had been greatly exaggerated.33That the new witchcraft theories were less important than thought ear-lier is the third great change in witch-hunt research, besides the collapse of the generalities concerning social status and gender.

Witch trials linked to the worship of the devil, which had been considered typical witch-hunt procedures in western europe, were not the most common witch or sorcery trials even in that area. The reverse also applied: trials connected with the practice of traditional harmful witchcraft and magic, which had earlier been thought of as typical only in peripheral regions, were typical also in those west european areas where mass trials resulting from a belief in the witches’ sabbath had occurred most often.36The almost exclusive domination of the western european paradigm in witch-hunt historiography requires explanation.

The western european paradigm covered the mass trials in northern spain and, to some extent, modern-day italy north of rome. Moreover, there were early works about english cases—in the late twentieth century, england was among the first areas outside continental europe where new modern research appeared. furthermore, the mass persecutions in sweden were known of in the period immediately following the hunts and thus it is understandable that a modern treatise about them appeared at the head of modern witch-hunt studies. it is still clear that the political frontier between the mar-ket economy countries and the socialist countries after the second World War further consolidated the basic position of western european witch-hunt research, as, for example, can be seen from following the stages of research on russia and hungary.37i would suggest that the western european paradigm of witch-hunt his-toriography originates from the exclusive focus on the core areas of chris-tian europe. Geographically, this corresponds to the central and most important regions of catholic europe before the reformation. These areas also constituted the richest and economically as well as culturally most advanced part of europe—at least according to many western european writers—and most of the scientists and scholars worked there. Diabolical witchcraft theories gained the strongest hold in these areas which were, or had once been, the most developed regions of the catholic church.38 only the catholic church made witches heretics, although the Protestants subsequently adopted the new theories as well. Trials for diabolical witch-craft occurred in other european areas too, but they were rarer. in most of europe there were few or none at all.Areas that were strongly roman catholic are regarded by many to be the regions in which the development of “europe”, as we know it, began. Later, these areas were somewhat vaguely named “western europe”, as in this article, a concept i will now deconstruct. in Peter rietbergen’s work, Europe—A Cultural History (1998), the most important areas are assessed as precisely these. in his foreword, rietbergen makes it clear that he knows the limitations of his definition, but he defends it vigorously at various points of his work by explaining that the valuable aspects of 37 Zoltán Kovács, “Die hexen in russland”, Acta Ethnographica Academiae Scientia-rum Hungaricae, tomus 22 (1–2) (budapest: 1973); nenonen, “Witch-hunt historiography,” 310–311.38 in spain, Portugal and the region that is now italy there were, however, generally fewer persecutions. for the reasons, see Levack, The Witch-Hunt, 237–245."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" the dubious history of the witch-hunts 35europe’s culture and civilization, as well as the most important political developments, are essentially of western european origin.39because the geography of administration rules the geography of juris-diction and control, modern researchers do not question why more tri-als were conducted in the areas where the administration, among other things, was most developed. Learned people, who were concentrated in the most advanced areas, knew the importance of heretical witchcraft theories—of which many in the peripheries knew nothing. Learned men knew how to seek and develop judicial indictments according to the theory. in later centuries, witch-hunt scholars followed the example set by their predecessors, namely theologians’ and inquisitors’ precepts for witchcraft trials. scholars of later generations have emphasized heretical witchcraft in the same way their predecessors did at the time of the witch trials. in addition, modern scholars have largely ignored other types of tri-als for witchcraft and magical practice, and also popular beliefs.it seems clear that the western european paradigm of witch-hunt his-toriography is a product of the hierarchies of political and ecclesiastical geography. in rietbergen’s book, the boundary of western europe runs from the baltic to the balkans, although it is often still further to the west in many of his chapters.40 his western europe corresponds quite closely to those German- and french-speaking areas (including switzerland) where witch trials first became widespread and where mass trials arising from the belief in the witches’ sabbath occurred. This area is the geographi-cal western europe of the witch-hunts. northern spain belongs to it but northwestern europe, where witches were rarely met at their sabbaths, really doesn’t. interestingly, northwestern and northern europe were the regions where many also ended up following Protestant movements.The catholic church influenced the culture and spiritual life of euro-peans decisively in many ways for centuries, and the importance of christianity was not diminished significantly during the reformation era. Possibly the opposite was true.41 in witch-hunt studies the christian religion had a still greater role. emphasis on christianity meant an 39 Peter rietbergen, Europe.

Those who created the theories of diabolical witchcraft were christians. The vast majority of the witch-hunt scholars who followed them had a christian ideology or background, even if dogma was not followed in the same way as it had been centuries earlier. in all probability this has made it more difficult to step outside the christian conceptions of witchcraft and magical practices. A critical analysis of the limitations of the chris-tian perspective is also needed. furthermore, the christian perspective has influenced our understanding of other intellectual and cultural issues as well—a very important question, but one that cannot be addressed here. so far, most scholars who have focused on the history of witchcraft and magic have been europeans; in other words, mostly people with a christian background. As a result, most of those who meet each other at conferences on the theme are from this background and almost all critical examination of their work has come from within a restricted milieu.Any assessment of the extent to which witch-hunt research simply conforms to the general patterns of historical research in western europe must be left aside here. Although the national direction of writing his-tory has been questioned in many countries, the explanation of the part the church and religion has played in the field of politics, social life and culture has advanced slowly, as though it is believed that the seculariza-tion, which began in the 1800s, has removed the necessity for such an analysis.What finally sparked the change in the geographical perspective in witch-hunt historiography is yet another question that cannot be answered here. Judging from the way in which new research into the witch-hunts has spread to different countries, it must be suspected that the most important reason has been the economic integration of europe that has occurred alongside the expansion of the european union. it can-not be said that the geographical perspective of research has advanced in close concert with economic integration, but the link is clear when work done in the 1990s or later is compared with earlier work. This is grotesque, because it would be hoped that academia’s own requirements would influence the development of scholarship rather than external fac-tors. it is also ironic that the economic integration of europe was founded on just those western european models and ideologies which justified the disregard of non-western european developments in witch-hunt histori-ography for so long."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" the dubious history of the witch-hunts 37BibliographyAnkarloo, bengt.

Images are frequently included in studies without any real commentary, and at best they are taken as illustrations of claims or descriptions found in witchcraft treatises or trial evidence. seldom are they considered as the product of artistic invention and imagi-nation within a particular social, cultural and intellectual context.Early Art Historical and Cultural Analysis in the 1970s and 1980sthe first focused consideration of the role of visual images in the history of european witchcraft came with the 1973 catalogue to an exhibition mounted at the Bibliothèque nationale by maxime Préaud, a curator in the department of Prints.18 Préaud’s exhibition, the first dedicated to the subject of witchcraft—primarily prints, but also some drawings, paint-ings and manuscript illuminations—signified a major breakthrough in the approach to such images.

In this way, the murderous practices of witches at the sabbath are grouped with representations of famine and infanticide, their dances with different types of bacchanal. there is both visual focus and coherence, the relationship to witchcraft treatises and trials, as well as the need to situate these artistic constructs within a range of other visual traditions. But the work remains a catalogue, and can only gesture in different methodological directions rather than attempt any systematic analysis.20from the 1980s witchcraft images slowly came to be considered a topic worthy of scholarly study within what was by that time the newly burgeoning field of witchcraft studies. the german art historian, sigrid schade, was the first scholar to write a major synthesis of witchcraft imagery in her tübingen dissertation published in 1983, although her study was largely confined to the period of the later fifteenth and first half of the sixteenth century.21 schade’s book focuses on the witchcraft images of such artists as albrecht altdorfer, albrecht dürer, Lucas cranach and especially hans Baldung grien, and demonstrates how these artists trans-formed traditional notions of magic by locating the source of this magic in the eroticism of the female body. she argues that their work is closely allied to that of contemporary witchcraft treatises and contributes to the mass of witch persecutions in the early modern period. the parallel lies in the fears generated about the seductive power of women through the mas-culinist projections of witch figures, who represent a nature that had to be overcome in the establishment of a new patriarchal rationalist order.22 19 on this point I disagree with sigrid schade (Schadenzauber, 19, 130, n. 54), who groups Préaud with those primarily interested in the link between witchcraft belief and the thought of primitive cultures, such as grillot de givry and Kurt seligmann. 20 Préaud’s creative reading of individual images can be observed in maxime Préaud, “La sorcière de noël,” Hamsa 7, special issue: L’ésotérisme d’Albrecht Dürer (1977): 47–51; maxime Préaud, “saturne, satan, Wotan et saint antoine ermite,” in Alchimie mystique et traditions populaires, Cahiers de Fontenay 33, ed. maxime Préaud (Lyon: Éditions de l’ens, 1983), 81–102.21 schade, Schadenzauber. 22 see also schade’s exploration of how Baldung plays with the voyeuristic gaze in creating his erotic witch images, in schade, “Zur genese des voyeuristischen Blicks. das"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"50 charles zikadifferentiating her own approach sharply from an earlier historiography that associated witchcraft with the medieval, and therefore saw it as an anachronistic survivor of the medieval at the time of renaissance and ref-ormation, schade’s feminist position and analysis is heavily premised on the notion of a fundamental structural transformation and paradigm shift in the sixteenth century drawn from social theorists such as Jürgen hab-ermas, norbert elias and michel foucault. her iconographical analyses are consequently directed towards demonstrating the development and strategic purpose of this new cultural paradigm; in this way she is able to carve out a new social and cultural meaning for witchcraft images.erotische in den hexenbildern hans Baldung grien,” in Frauen, Kunst, Geschichte: zur Korrektur des herrschenden Blicks, eds. cordula Bischoff et al.

While schade shows how images are strongly linked to witchcraft treatises, and more so those whose context in treatises demands they be understood as illus-trative, she also demonstrates how their power and meaning depends on the associations created with respect to various themes, such as the meaning of nature, representations of the wild horde, discourse concern-ing melancholy and lust, and most especially with male fears concerning the power of the female body. Visual representations of witchcraft there-fore constitute a direct and particular response to the structural changes schade identifies and are not necessarily created in direct response to contemporary literary or judicial accounts of witchcraft. schade’s work represents a major step forward in identifying many of the key meanings associated with witchcraft in the work of the first generation of artists to focus on this subject, and her work demonstrates how a great num-ber of anonymous and sometimes aesthetically quite crude images can be understood with reference to the work of well-known artists. there is often a mutual interaction and influence between these simple prints in witch treatises, such as between the illustrations in the many incunabula editions of ulrich molitor’s treatise, and the work of established artists like Baldung, resulting in modifications in both. schade’s work certainly laid the basis for a more rigorous and sustained study, not only of the witchcraft motifs in the work of these early sixteenth-century artists, but also of the iconography they developed and the manner in which it was deployed, modified, transformed or abandoned by artists in the sixteenth and later centuries.The Fascination with Hans Baldung Grien—from the 1960s to the 1980sat the time schade was writing her dissertation, the central artist in her study, hans Baldung grien,23 together with his drawings, prints and single painting on the subject of witchcraft, was beginning to receive unprec-edented attention. through to the early twentieth century, Baldung had generally been considered as nothing more than a pupil of albrecht dürer without much artistic originality. gabriel von térey had published a 23 It is sometimes forgotten that “grien” was Baldung’s nickname and simply appended to his name."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"52 charles zikacollection of Baldung’s drawings in the late nineteenth century, and then carl Koch a fuller and critical edition in 1941.24 some recognition of Baldung’s artistic achievement followed the exhibition and large catalogue of paintings, drawings, prints and stained glass designs by Baldung and his copyists held in Karlsruhe in 1959.25 But it was really only in the later 1970s and 1980s that the quality of Baldung’s work and his status as one of the leading artists of the early sixteenth century was acknowledged.

While Baldung gives expression to the misogyny of his period, argues hults, the sexual lusts of the women he creates are as attractive as they are threatening. It is by means of this ambiguity that Baldung’s works achieve their power. the border between objective reality and subjective fantasy is obscured. this emphasis on fantasy is a theme running through hults’ exegeses, but is strongest in her exploration of the Bewitched Groom. she rejects, or rather modifies, the attempt by charmian mesenzeva to interpret the woodcut as a simple retelling of the folk legend of the squire rechenberger, and prefers to build on an earlier article by gustav hartlaub that saw the fig-ure of the groom as the artist’s alter ego.41 she concludes that the woodcut represents the dangerous power of fantasy or creative imagination when not controlled by reason. hults’ tendency to claim this with particular reference to Baldung’s temperament as a saturnine or melancholic art-ist grows out of the third strong element in her work, the requirement 39 Linda hults, “Baldung and the reformation,” in Hans Baldung Grien, prints & draw-ings, eds.

Levack and published by garland in 1992.50 the rapid expansion of academic as well as more popular interest in witchcraft had clearly warranted this large publishing enterprise; but the studies devoted to witchcraft images were exactly three of the sixteen articles in one of the twelve volumes.51 moreover, approximately two and a half of those arti-cles concerned the work of hans Baldung grien and to a lesser extent his early sixteenth-century contemporaries, albrecht dürer and Lucas cra-nach. despite Levack’s claim in the introduction that the most valuable function of artistic depictions of witches was that they “provide insights into the nature of the elite concept of witchcraft” and “more direct access to the contemporary imagination”, and despite Levack’s reference in his introduction to the famous 1613 engraving of Jan Ziarnko, the paintings of david teniers the younger, the Black Paintings of goya and the scepticism of hogarth,52 there was not a reference to a single work of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in the articles that followed. Pushing beyond the sixteenth-century barrier was certainly not impossible.

While few scholars would agree with davidson’s conclusion that artists of the early modern period “were engaged in recording facts about witchcraft”, and “were engaged in reportage”,55 her book clarified for the first time in english some of the key artists who had created witchcraft images, described some of the most important images, identified com-monalities and differences in their iconography, and situated them his-torically in relation to the publication and content of witchcraft treatises and the prosecution of witches in judicial trials. at about the same time that davidson published her book, a doctoral candidate from amster-dam, machteld Löwensteyn, was analyzing witchcraft in the imaginative fantasy world of Jacques de gheyn II, and followed up that study with a fine paper on images of the sabbath in the low countries.56 ursula härt-ing, meanwhile, was making the witchcraft scenes of frans francken the younger accessible to a broader audience through a catalogue raisonée.57 54 other significant studies on early sixteenth-century witchcraft images and related images of death include: Joseph Leo Koerner, “the mortification of the Image: death as a hermeneutic in hans Baldung grien,” Representations 10 (1985): 52–101; christiane andersson, “hans Baldung grien: Zwei Wetterhexen,” in Preziosen.

In her monograph on de gheyn, swan emphasized the way de gheyn’s artistic production oscillates between the poles of scientific naturalism and imaginative fantasy, and how his interest in witchcraft could only be understood in the context of contemporary scientific and philosophical discourse. she demonstrated how de gheyn’s images of witchcraft were infused with contemporary demonological theories of the deluded imagi-nation, as transmitted through the works of Johann Weyer, reginald scot (via the 1609 dutch edition of The Discoverie of Witchcraft, seven years in the making and translated by thomas Basson and his son govert, de gheyn’s brother-in-law from 1608), and ambroise Paré (through the dutch edition of 1604).75 she concluded that the continuing interest in this sub-ject by artists such as de gheyn had little to do with a belief or desire to 72 claudia swan, Art, Science and Witchcraft in Early Modern Holland: Jacques de Gheyn II (1565–1629) (cambridge: cambridge university Press, 2005).73 J. richard Judson, The Drawings of Jacob de Gheyn II (new york: grossman, 1973), 27–34; I.

In his dazzling 1993 study of the interrelationship between Baldung and his master dürer, the american art historian Joseph Leo Koerner read the eroticism and nude female bodies of Baldung’s witches as “the male subject’s radical other”, expressions of an artistic self- consciousness that represents a “parodic response to an earlier—usually dürerian—subject”.76 Baldung’s witches constitute an integral part of a broader program that overturns or disfigures the beauty of the human form and the closed relationship between the artist and his works, found in dürer, in order to present the unfinished, uncontained, heterogeneous and fallen self of Baldung. yet as well as this driving psychic narrative of the young disciple who needs to fashion a self that both absorbs and destroys the models created by the father, Koerner also has a keen eye for the social, legal, medical and humanist networks of audience, family and city that enabled witchcraft to become a key element in that narrative.77two major exhibitions and catalogues have also made Baldung’s witch-craft images better known over the last decade: a more general exhibi-tion held in freiburg in late 2001, which primarily celebrated Baldung’s painting of the high altar of the freiburg münster between 1512 and 1517, together with a selection of his drawings, prints and paintings created approximately over the same time-period; and a 2007 exhibition in the städel museum in frankfurt, which concentrated explicitly on what it considered to be Baldung’s “strange fantasies” about the lust of witches.78 the freiburg catalogue did not present any new material on Baldung’s witchcraft images, except for the novel suggestion that the famous inscrip-tion on the 1514 Vienna drawing of The Three Witches should be read as a new year’s greeting to a female “heart-capturer”, rather than to a canon of 76 Joseph Leo Koerner, The Moment of Self-portraiture in German Renaissance Art (chicago: chicago university Press, 1993), 323–362, esp. 318. 77 Koerner, The Moment Self-portraiture, 327–328, 340, 357–358. 78 saskia durian-ress, ed., Hans Baldung Grien in Freiburg, exhibition catalogue, augustinermuseum freiburg im Breisgau (freiburg im Breisgau: rombach, 2001); Bodo Brinkmann, ed., Hexenlust und Sündenfall: die seltsamen Phantasien des Hans Baldung Grien.

In what is essentially a long article on the 1523 Baldung painting traditionally known as The Weather Witches, the german art historian Bodo Brinkman presents a very perceptive and provocative re-reading of its subject matter and purpose (even if in sometimes clumsy english translation) by drawing on a wide range of Baldung’s own work and that of contemporary artists. Brinkman rejects the traditional view that the scene represents weather sorcery, and claims rather that it concerns the dangers of syphilis for those who suc-cumb to the temptations of lust represented by these seductive women. But whether one accepts each of the different elements of the puzzle that Brinkman joins together so ingeniously to construct his argument, focus-ing especially on the meaning of the flask held by one of the women and the voyeuristic erotic games typical of Baldung’s work in general, the most important and demonstrable general point Brinkman makes is that we should not interpret this painting narratively; we need to understand it discursively, as a basis for discussion. the painting “does not tell a story but, with the objects it depicts, triggers chains of association.”81such detailed readings of visual images which carefully consider icono-graphical elements, internal composition and dynamics, painterly tech-nique as well as broader artistic, cultural and social environments and debates, are of course fundamental to the discipline of the art historian and have multiplied with our increased knowledge both of individual artists, different visual codes and topoi, and of the broader history and discourse of witchcraft. a recent example is the detailed examination by the Vienna art historian, erwin Pokorny, of Baldung’s 1515 drawing of the traditionally titled Witch and Dragon.82 Pokorny finds no compel-ling attribute that distinguishes this seductive woman as a witch, or the 79 durian-ress, Hans Baldung Grien, 186. this has been rejected by Bodo Brinkmann, Hexenlust und Sündenfall, 52. 80 durian-ress, Hans Baldung Grien, 41–45, 172–189. 81 Brinkmann, Hexenlust und Sündenfall, 44. also see 36, 70. 82 erwin Pokorny, “eine hexe, die keine ist?

In an effort to assess the impact of classical literature on the visual representation of witchcraft, I have attempted to explore changes during the sixteenth century to the iconography of the classical witch circe, for instance, and to a lesser extent others such as Palaes-tra, Pamphile, meroe and medea.86 my work has been complemented by a recent study of circe by guy tal, which concentrates on alessandro allori’s depiction of circe in the florentine Palazzo of the salviati family, but adds much to our broader knowledge of circe in sixteenth-century Italy;87 while an important study by Bertina suida manning explores the subject among genoese painters such as giovanni Benedetto castiglione in the seventeenth century.88 medea, on the other hand, has received somewhat less attention, with the emphasis predominantly on Italian examples.89 the importance of these images of witchcraft drawn from classical literature has been inadvertently highlighted in recent years by a provocative and stimulating study of the american art historian, margaret sullivan.90 sullivan challenged long-held assumptions about the origins and aims of the witchcraft images of south german and swiss artists of the early sixteenth century, such as hans Baldung grien and albrecht dürer, as graphic examples of misogyny and the marginalization 86 charles Zika, “Images of circe and discourses of Witchcraft, 1480–1580,” Zeitenblicke: Online-Journal für die Geschichtswissenschaften 1 (2002), http://www.zeitenblicke.histori-cum.net/2002/01/zika/zika.html. also see charles Zika, The Appearance of Witchcraft: Print and Visual Culture in Sixteenth-Century Europe (London and new york: routledge, 2007), 133–155. 87 guy tal, “disbelieving in Witchcraft: allori’s melancholic circe in the Palazzo sal-viati,” Athanor 22 (2004): 57–66.88 Bertina suida manning, “the transformation of circe: the significance of the sorcer-ess subject in seventeenth-century genoese painting,” in Scritti di storia dell’arte in onore di Federico Zeri, vol. 2 (Los angeles: J.

But to truly iden-tify and assess the stimulus for a developing witchcraft imagery, we need to understand the interaction between the more general iconography of witchcraft which these artists developed and contemporary illustrations of individual classical witches like circe and medea.another “literary” witch whose visual history has been almost com-pletely ignored is the biblical witch of endor from the story of King saul (1 sam. 28). even though saul’s use of this necromancer to call up the dead prophet samuel features in almost every witchcraft treatise, and her image appears in numerous woodcuts and engravings that accompany accounts of the biblical story from the twelfth century to the present, only one article prior to the last decade had examined the subject in any detail.91 In order to correct this significant gap in the history of witchcraft images, I have been publishing a number of articles in recent years, which will ultimately contribute to a monograph tracing the development of the figure through european history.92 this will help us to differentiate more clearly the different stages in the visual history of witchcraft, I believe, and also explicate the part played by biblical authority and exegesis in emphasizing an essentially diabolical understanding of witchcraft and related magical arts, as well as the urgency for authorities to eliminate any who practiced such arts. Just as we need studies of representations of the biblical witch of endor, we also need studies of christian saints in order to identify how, when and where their particular struggles with the traditional forces of darkness began to include the forces of witchcraft. 91 Jean-claude schmitt, “Le spectre de samuel et la sorcière d’en dor. avatars histo-riques d’un récit biblique: I rois 28,” Études rurales 105–6 (1987): 37–54, at 50–56. a sum-mary can be found in schmitt’s book, Ghosts in the Middle Ages: the Living and the Dead in Medieval Society (chicago & London: university of chicago Press, 1998; 1st french edition published in 1994), 15–17. 92 charles Zika, “reformation, scriptural Precedent and Witchcraft: Johann teufel’s woodcut of the Witch of Endor,” in Reforming the Reformation: essays in honour of Peter Matheson, ed.

But to this point there have only been limited explorations of the manner in which the imagery of these magicians in the sixteenth century takes on particular, and sometimes curious, iconographical ele-ments and themes from representations of witchcraft.94Three Recent Attempts at a Broader Synthesis—Function, Artistic Self-identity and Cultural Meaningthere have been only three attempts in recent years to analyze witch-craft images produced by different artists over a longer period of time and from different regions of europe. the first is that by the german legal historian from the university of Bielefeld, Wolfgang schild. schild has long had an interest in the history of legal ordinances and judicial punish-ment and this has included visual depictions of legal process, torture and punishment.95 In 1997 he published a guide to the history of the crime of witchcraft in association with an exhibition held at the medieval crime museum in rothenburg ob der tauber.96 many of the images included in this extensive and rich collection serve as little more than very general 93 ortrud Westheider and michael Philipp, eds., Schrecken und Lust: Die Versuchung des heiligen Antonius von Hieronymus Bosch bis Max Ernst, exhibition catalogue, Bucerius Kunst forums, hamburg (munich: hirmer, 2008). heinrich trebbin, David Teniers und Sankt Antonius (frankfurt am main: haag & herchen, 1994). 94 Zika, The Appearance of Witchcraft, 162–178. 95 Wolfgang schild, Bilder von Recht und Gerechtigkeit (cologne: dumont, 1995). as well as his more scholarly publications on subjects such as the early modern jurist Benedict carpzov, schild has also written a number of illustrated titles in a series published by the medieval crime museum, rothenburg ob der tauber, for a more general readership: Die Volkacher Halsgerichtsordnung von 1504, schriftenreihe des mittelalterlichen Kriminalmu-seums rothenburg ob der tauber, nr. 2, 1997; Die Eiserne Jungfrau.

In a section on “witch fantasies”, he attempts to distin-guish the different functions of artworks, in elucidating particular themes within witchcraft, for instance, or in creating propaganda to support its persecution.97 schild develops his categorization of witchcraft images according to their function in a subsequent lengthy essay published in 1998.98 the essay divides these functions into eight main groups, such as “the visualization of witchcraft”, establishing credibility for witchcraft theory and propaganda in the battle against witchcraft, creating an aes-thetic for an imagined witchcraft; each section is then further sub-divided into the variations of a particular function. as the first such study con-centrating on the textual, social, legal, political and cultural functions of witchcraft, schild’s study is extremely valuable; yet almost inevitably with such functional approaches, the multi-functional character and specific-ity of individual images tend to become lost in the face of categorization, as does the sense of chronological development and geographical indi-viduality. We clearly require an understanding of “fantasies” that does not construct them simply in opposition to “reality”.99the other recent attempts to analyze the production and significance of witchcraft images across a significant spread of times and places have been monographs by Linda hults and myself.100 I have already described the very significant contribution hults made to the scholarship on Baldung’s witchcraft images in the 1980s. In this book she has extended her coverage very considerably and also broadened her theoretical per-spective to produce the most significant and broad-reaching study on the witch in the imagination of artists from the early sixteenth to the early nineteenth centuries. as a deep reading of artists’ engagement with the theme of witchcraft, the book offers an episodic treatment of the role of the witch, with chapters devoted primarily to the works of hans 97 one of the three sections of an earlier essay by schild is also devoted to Hexenphan-tasie. see “hexenglaube, hexenbegriff und hexenphantasie,” 11–37. 98 Wolfgang schild, “hexen-Bilder,” in Methoden und Konzepte der historischen Hexen-forschung, eds. gunther franz and franz Irsigler (trier: spee, 1998), 329–413. 99 the manner in which Lyndal roper uses images to help create the emotional reali-ties and cultural beliefs that feed particular fantasies is instructive in this regard. see Lyn-dal roper, Witch Craze: terror and fantasy in Baroque Germany (new haven and London: yale university Press, 2004), 141–59. 100 Linda hults, The Witch as Muse: art, gender and power in early modern Europe (Phila-delphia: university of Pennsylvania Press, 2005); Zika, The Appearance of Witchcraft."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" images and witchcraft studies: a short history 75Baldung grien, frans francken II, Jacques de gheyn II, salvator rosa and francesco goya, with shorter sections devoted to others. there is a real subtlety in tracing the complex range of discourses and contextual factors which impact on and interact with each of the artists, highlighting the role the witch played in the shaping of each artist’s self-identity. While the notion of artistic self-fashioning marks a certain continuum with hults’ earlier studies, this later work is far more gendered in its inflection, seemingly influenced by the role of gender in the studies of witchcraft historians of the 1990s, such as anne Barstow, Lyndal roper, marianne hester and diane Purkiss. hults argues that the witch/muse served as a foil for the self-construction of not only artistic, but also male, identities. figure 3.8.

I have been especially con-cerned to uncover the linkages artists create between witchcraft images and different literary and visual discourses in order to give their images added meaning, to show how they create visual cues and codes to make the content of their images more intelligible. over the last two decades, my exploration of witchcraft in later medieval and early modern europe has brought together my interest in religion and demonology on the one hand, and the role of the visual on the other—the significance it assumed in those past societies and the potential it has for communicating histori-cal understanding. during the 1990s I published a range of articles con-centrating predominantly on witchcraft images of the sixteenth century and covering various themes such as sexuality and sexual disorder, the motif of riding, cannibalism and saturn, melancholy and the wild horde, seeing and diabolical illusion—and eight of these were later republished in a collection of 2003.101 Building on some of these earlier studies as well as others published in the years following, my 2007 monograph aimed to show in systematic fashion how witchcraft began to take visual shape in its first one hundred years, the different artists and printers who contrib-uted to the process, some of the ways in which different audiences may have viewed witchcraft—and, most importantly perhaps, how particular 101 charles Zika, Exorcising our Demons: magic, witchcraft and visual culture in early modern Europe (Leiden: Brill, 2003). two articles have also been republished in New Per-spectives on Witchcraft, Magic, and Demonology: a six-volume anthology of scholarly articles, ed.

We need a broad and differentiated approach if we are to unlock the meaning of these images and evaluate their relationship to a broader contemporary discourse about the reality and nature of witchcraft, the political and theological decisions concerning the required response, and the adequacy of judicial machinery to implement that response. my own emphasis on cultural understandings of meaning and semiotic analysis represents only one possible approach. We continue to need more detailed analyses of individual art works in the context of a particular artist’s whole oeuvre as a basic building block on which a broader enterprise can rest. We also need more detailed iconographic studies of images that are anonymous or of little aesthetic or art historical interest, a study of particular broad themes and explorations of figures like circe and medea. a functional approach to such images is also fundamental in clarifying relationships between image and text, and between image and social action, as is what was once called the “social history of art”, the attention to all those involved in the processes of artistic production and consumption. a key player in this process, I would suggest, on the basis of the particular media in which most of these images were produced, is the printer. With the recent global move to new media and digitization of library and museum holdings, we can now begin to do what was previously nigh impossible—to clarify the numbers and transmission of different editions of books and prints over time and space, and thereby better understand the likely impact, reader-ship and audience of these images. By combining studies of artists and printers, of particular themes and literary figures, not to forget the critical role of patrons in the case of some artists, we can gradually move to a greater clarity in our understanding of the evolution of witchcraft imagery over two, three, four hundred years, an understanding that at this point of time remains extremely vague and very partial.Bibliography“Probleme der Baldung forschung: Kolloquium im Kunstmuseum Basel, 30.

Moreover, the sex ratios of accused witches seemed to be weighted so heavily against women that it seemed quite appropri-ate simply to ask “why” and attribute the cause to some cultural, deeply rooted and more or less unconscious misogynism.5When gender as a social and cultural construction and an individual or group identity reached witchcraft studies in the second half of the 1990s, that form of understanding gender was already under attack from two directions. firstly, there has been, since the turn of the century, a revival of debate on where the line between “sex” and “gender” should be drawn and whether social gender and biological sex are so interrelated that any distinction between the two is meaningless. these doubts have been traced back to several principal developments in scholarship, including increasing uncertainties about most “biological” markers, anthropological developments, psychological research and rethinking “women” as a valid analytical category.6 Secondly, some early modernists, especially those not primarily interested in gender or queer studies, have continuously ques-tioned whether the concept of gender was as relevant to people in the early modern period as it seems now, since early modern people hardly used it. is it a valid category of analysis at all in the study of that period? this question has especially attracted social historians, who have felt concepts like “femininity” and “masculinity” to be elusive and who have preferred simpler and more self-sufficient words like “men” and “women”. While most scholars would agree that gender as such was rarely talked of by early modern commoners, various sets of source materials suggest that such concepts as “masculinity” and “femininity” were in fact both openly debated and made use of in more tangible and less verbal ways in early modern everyday lives. today these debates have resulted in loose defini-tions: “sex” suggests inevitability based on biology and “gender” suggests choice or construction based on social environment. historians are free to choose their tool according to their need.5 Cf.

The Idea of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe (oxford: oxford university press 1997), 112–118.6 Wiesner hanks, Gender in History, 3–5; on usages of sex and gender, see e.g. Charlene l.

Since the work of lara apps and andrew Gow showing the importance of male witches in demonological theory, new case studies counting the number of male witches have mushroomed everywhere.there are some striking features in these studies: the first is that the numbers differ greatly in different parts of europe. this is partly because historians have had to use statistics drawn from areas of very different sizes and populations and of time periods of varying lengths. Some hunts took place during a short period of time. in other cases historians have only gathered information based on a short time period or a small geo-graphical area although witchcraft trials were endemic at the time: for example, the hunt conducted by Mathew hopkins in england, or the affair of witches’ sabbat trials in ahvenanmaa, finland, where ten women were accused and seven executed during three years. on the other end of the scale, some statisticians gathered data from entire centuries or even lon-ger periods. for example, 4,575 men and 19,050 women were executed in the holy roman empire between 1530 and 1730. in hungary, 160 men and 1,482 women were executed between 1520–1777. a similar general trial count in finland—an area roughly similar in size to the holy roman empire but with a population of only 400,000—would amount to over 2,500 accused and 150 executed witches or practitioners of magic between 1530–1800, a clear majority of whom were men.7 Moreover, statistics have 7 the cited examples have been presented in e.g. e.

Male witches clearly dominated in the eastern regions, but they were not uncommon in the western areas either. throughout the country, the proportion of women grew during the seventeenth century, especially after the 1660s. no comprehensive analysis of gender proportions is yet available from the eighteenth century, but preliminary results suggest that the proportion of men among those accused heavily increased again.9according to statistics drawn up by Marko nenonen and timo Kervinen (Chart 1), roughly two-thirds of the witches in finland were men prior to 1620, with the percentages in each decade varying from 45 to 80 percent. during the rest of the seventeenth century, the overall proportion of men was around half, dropping to as low as 40 percent in the 1670s and around 45 percent in the 1680s. although the percentage of men only dropped taikuus Suomessa 1700-luvun jälkipuoliskolla”. lecture at Genealogy days in Kuopio 17.3.2012 or emmi lahti: using Sacred Spaces as a part of Magic rituals—popular beliefs towards Cemeteries and Churchyards in 18th Century finland. paper in the 9th european Social Science history Conference, Glasgow Scotland, uK, 11–14 april 2012.8 apps and Gow, Male Witches, 45; levack, The Witch-Hunt, 142; Schulte, Man as Witch, 71.9 nenonen, Noituus, taikuus ja noitavainot; nenonen, “envious are; tittonen (lahti), “Tuomitaan taikuuden harjoittamisesta”."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"92 raisa maria toivobelow 50 during three decades in the two centuries, the overall proportion of women was slightly greater than that of men.10the increase in the proportion of women and decrease in the propor-tion of men over time in finland seems to go against the general euro-pean trend. erik Midelfort’s famous explanation of the european trend has been that men began to be accused of witchcraft when the old stereo-type of a (female) witch was broken down by or in the great mass trials. Midelfort’s theory has lately been supplemented by another, namely that the popular re-imagining of the witches’ sabbat—a feature of the mass trials in particular—as a village festival envisaged the attendants of that sabbat as similar to those at a village celebration, with men in key roles as musicians, dance leaders and other masters of ceremony.1110 nenonen, Noituus, taikuus, appendices. it should be noted that the source material has survived far more completely for the seventeenth century than for the sixteenth, which may partly explain the apparent growth after the 1620s.

Whereas this had not been a very satisfactory explanation in europe—rolf Schulte proposed dividing the accused into “primary” and “secondary” suspects to point out where association with previous suspects could and could not have explanatory power—in finland it made no sense at all, as few finnish witches had anyone else, let alone a relative or family member, accused in the same set of trials. on the other hand, a fair number of both male and female witches in the tight-knit and inter-related rural village com-munities had relatives who had been accused once or twice during the previous decades. however, the lapse of time is often too long to allow any connection to be made between a given accusation and any previous one. rather, it seems that the social position of these persons, as holders of substantial farms, made them liable to suspicion.12only during trials that involved accusations about the witches’ sab-bat were denounciations likely to be asked and followed up. the biggest mass trial shows the scale of these events: in 1666–1668, in ahvenanmaa, ten women were accused and interrogated, and seven of them were sen-tenced to death. in the smallish fishing villages of ahvenanmaa, seven women was a notable number, but of the total number of around two thousand accused in the whole of finland, the majority were involved in other sorts of trials. nevertheless, the sabbat trials may have had a greater significance culturally than statistically: stories of them circulated around 12 Schulte, Man as Witch; robin briggs, “Male Witches in the duchy of lorraine,” in Witchcraft and Masculinities in Early Modern Europe, ed. alison rowlands (Manchester: Manchester university press, 2009) on witches and their relatives in finland, see e.g. raisa Maria toivo, Witchcraft and Gender in Early Modern Society.

Geographically, culturally and in terms of the gender pattern of witches accused, estonia, where 60 percent of witches were male, is the closest point of comparison to finland. esto-nia was then part of the same Swedish state as finland, although the use of law was already slightly different from that of finland and the western parts of Sweden. even in the state geographically closest to finland and Sweden, denmark-norway, which shared the lutheran creed and a fairly similar judicial and legal environment halfway from local to centralized 13 on the ahvenanmaa witches, see antero heikkinen, Paholaisen liittolaiset.

W. Connell’s terms, not sharing in the hegemonic masculinity.17 More complicated questions, such as how witchcraft trials might have portrayed male potential, how men wanted to use their options, or of how their gender identities were portrayed or experienced by the men taking part in witchcraft or witch-craft trials, have as yet received comparatively little attention, because male witches have been less researched than female ones.in this “second wave” treatment, gender is essentially a hierarchical relationship between either men and women, or men and less-hege-monically masculine men. in a crude and vulgar interpretation, this has even been defined as “lesser men”. Such a dichotomous understanding of gender, despite all the discourse on social constructivity, relies heav-ily on biology: the hierarchical gender relationships are inevitably biased in a certain way according to the sex of the parties concerned. Men and women are thus treated as essentially or originally biologically different in witchcraft studies, as if there was a self-evident sex division. Consequently, witchcraft historians, perhaps more than medievalists or early modernists 15 louise nyholm Kallestrup, “the devil’s Milkmaid: the Witch as a Woman in refor-mation denmark,” Women’s History Magazine 66 (2011): 26–30.16 levack, The Witch Hunts.

Contrary to the second wave of feminist interpretations, which viewed women purely as victims of patriarchy, these newer interpretations bestowed upon women the task of upholding society’s boundaries, the lines between order and disorder, culture and nature, or good and evil. Witches either failed to toe the line, or consciously or unconsciously blurred it in a way that was considered dangerous.in relation to male witches, a similar trend of research focusing on identity and masculinity—if not hegemonic, perhaps exaggerated masculinity—can be seen in the interest in shamanistic witchcraft. rather than effeminized men, male witches have been seen as rather over- masculine trouble-makers—or sometimes shamans. the stereotype of the local maleficent witch, in continental europe at least, was a woman, likely to hurt children or the elderly.

Gendered divi-sion of labor in magic is, then, to be found in qualities and themes other than “good” or “evil”.Magic on horses and horse equipment was a male prerogative, whereas cattle and human health, household tasks and human relationships belonged to the feminine sphere, claims Oja.27 Laura Stark, a Finnish folklorist, found similar patterns in nineteenth-century eastern Finland, where horses’ harnesses, travel equipment and grain could have been spoiled by a woman stepping or jumping over them, thereby exposing the väki (power) of her genitals. Only men could take care of horses and rid-ing equipment in a positive way.28 This also reflects the role gendering of church frescos in many Finnish churches, which present the butter witch images of women milking and churning with the devil and corresponding images of men with horses and the devil.29 To an extent it seems to have mirrored the general division of work in society. Yet there were cases in seventeenth-century Finland in which women conducted protective magic on horses. Even more frequently, women tended to and traveled with horses. Traveling was dangerous, but farming women could not afford to leave their butter unsold or their taxes unpaid even when their husbands were at war, nor could they leave their crippled husbands or their belong-ings in faraway towns. Women took care of transport even for the crown when their husbands were unable to do so.30 The gender division of labor was slowly forming, but had not yet reached the state described by the historians and folklorists working on the nineteenth century.

Such figures are comparatively rare in seventeenth-century material. Sometimes features common to shamanistic magic can be found in the seventeenth-century trials: for instance, witches were occasionally reported to go into a trance, or to use drums of “measuring” when healing. historians have also pointed out that the Swedish Blåkulla (place of the witches’ sabbat) owes some of its features to the other world which sha-mans traveled to. it would be very interesting if the tietäjä-tradition could be shown to have shamanistic roots that could be traced back in history, perhaps to some non-Christian (if not pre-Christian) religious tradition, but alas, the evidence from finland is too sparse for that.32in finland, one faintly related cluster of magic activity was almost always performed by men: the custom of celebrating calendar festivals with sacrificial offerings and rituals meals, which was condemned and prosecuted as superstition and witchcraft by lutheran church officials in secular courts. Statistically, this kind of magic or witchcraft was not very significant and in absolute numbers the cases are few. however, these cases may reveal some interesting patterns.

Some of the court records describe the participants in even more detail: only those who “were born in the house”, i.e. blood relatives of the owner, were allowed to take part.33 these rituals were clearly considered both a religious duty of a representative of the kin and as a method of ensuring a successful year for the homestead. these rituals also required their performers to hold a certain status, as they were organized in some of the wealthier free-owning peasants’ farmsteads in the parishes. in gen-eral, magic was tied to the role of heading the household, so that when a maidservant or a farmhand was described as performing some of the deeds that were construed as witchcraft, such as carrying milk from the neighbors’ cows to the milk jugs of her employers’ farm, reading magic words or carrying bewitched food to another household, the servants were often not punished for it, since they were thought to have acted under the orders of their mistresses and masters. the mistress or master was considered the one responsible.34nevertheless, the importance of farming and farm ownership and the roles of the heads of households in finland do not support eva labouvie’s claims that Swedish benevolent magic was male-dominated because men as husbands were responsible for the well-being and success of people, cattle, property and work in the household, or that women were more often suspected of harmful magic because they, in their daily work with food and caring for the sick, had ample opportunities.35 rather, the farm-steads were usually run by a couple in partnership, both men and women flexibly responsible for the success of the household and farmstead and, consequently, both men and women used magic in their role as the house-hold master or mistress.in these examples of men performing socio-religious roles and being accused of witchcraft in the process, witchcraft or magic and masculin-ity appear to be inherently connected to the social role of men at oppo-site ends of the social scale. the gender roles of the witches were neither inverted nor exaggerated: they duly reflected what was expected of these 33 NAF DCR eg.

Both men insisted that the injured woman had put a curse on sergei because he would not marry her. even the local babka (witch) could not help very much with removing the curse, which was why they had decided to take things into their own hands. the police did not know what to make of the crime. “We can’t just tell everyone in this town that magic is nonsense”, said chekaldin, the police officer on the case, even though it is clear that he would have liked to, “but we have to bring justice”. the two men who committed these crimes were being held in the nearby city of Kursk, where they had been examined by psy-chiatrists and found to be absolutely sane.1 although this affair sounded ridiculous to many Russians, it did actually occur.2this story proves that magical practices still occupy a part of the every-day life of some Russian families. contemporary Russian tabloids are full of advertisements by witches offering spells, curses and other methods to improve one’s career or love life. this may explain why Russian witch-craft has been a focus for anthropological and ethnographic research rather than for historical enquiries. even those historians who have stud-ied witchcraft have mainly concentrated on explaining the relationship between official christianity and popular religion at given stages of the state-building process and how significant dvoeverie (double-belief ) was to Russian culture in particular, thus looking primarily at ethnographical data. therefore, magic as a pagan practice has been viewed as a confirma-tion of the existence of and intercommunication between two somehow 1 Michael specter, “in Modern Russia, a fatal Medieval Witch hunt,” New York Times, april 5, 1997. 2 andrei sinel’nikov, “inkvizitory iz derevni terekhovo,” Komsomol’skaia pravda, March 28, 1997."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"110 marianna g. muravyevadifferent systems of beliefs, namely, those of pagan/popular religion and state/christian religion. this has led to a large degree of neglect of the topic in soviet and Russian historiography.Research on Russian witchcraft has not been very developed in for-eign slavic studies either. american and British slavists (Valerie Kivelson, christine Worobec, Russell Zguta, W. f.

Besides koldun (the most common name for a witch/wizard) we find eretnik (from “heretic”),12 veretnik, charovnik (a sorcerer) and ved’mar’ (a witch), while others could be used by different slavic ethnic groups. all of them name evil practices and diversion from christianity as major features of such a person.13 7 Slovar’ Akademii Rossiiskoi, 6 vols (st. petersurg: imperatorskaia akademiia nauk, 1789–1794), vol. 1, 817–819. 8 Slovar’ Akademii Rossiiskoi, vol. 3, 701–702. 9 Slovar’ Akademii Rossiiskoi po azbuchnomu poriadku raspolozhennyi, 6 vols (st. peters-burg: imperatoskaia akademiia nauk, 1806–1822), vol. 4, 1238. 10 Slovar’ Akademii Rossiiskoi po azbuchnomu poradku raspolozhennyi, vol. 4, 1272.11 avgust levenstim, ‘sueverie v ego otnoshenii k ugolovnomu pravu,” Zhurnal Minis-terstva Iustitsii 1 (1897): 178. 12 on eretnik, see the extensive commentary of felix oinas, who insists that the con-notation of the word was closely connected with both a heretic and a sorcerer: felix J. oinas, “heretics as Vampires and demons in Russia,” The Slavic and East European Journal 22, no. 4 (1978): 433–441. 13 n. a. nikitina, “K voprosu o russkikh koldunakh,” Sbornik museia antropologii i etnografii 7 (1928): 299–325."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"114 marianna g. muravyevalinguistic analysis, especially the use of such words as chernoknizhnik, proves the assumption that at least in pre-petrine Russia there was no distinction between white and black magic wrong.14 W.

Valerie Kivelson, who has been collecting witchcraft cases for over twenty years, has discovered 250 from the seventeenth century so far (mostly coming from the Military chancellery—Razriadnyi Prikaz), while elena smilianskaia talks about 240 witchcraft cases (she also lists more than 500 crimes against religion that she had discovered, including blasphemy, profanity and others) for the eighteenth century. lavrov recovered 126 cases from central courts for the period 1700–1740.26 christine Worobec provides interesting statistics on nineteenth-century outbreaks of witch persecutions, counting 80 cases from the 34 provinces of european Russia and Russian-ruled ukraine for the period of 1870–1900.27 nineteenth-century historians and lawyers interested in witchcraft trials also provided some statistics. antonovitch discovered 70 cases just from the eighteenth-century documents of Kiev’s central archive.28 even a rough estimate shows that we are not talking about the persecution of thousands. the number of those sentenced is even lower. however, the main question here is whether these approxi-mately 500 cases (relying on Kivelson’s estimates for the seventeenth and smilianskaia’s for the eighteenth century) represent “hunts” or “crazes”?in order to answer the question, two sets of comparable parameters should be looked into. the first set should include comparable absolute figures; for the same periods of time, the number of trials should be com-pared with countries where “hunts” took place, countries where “crazes” took place, and countries where neither of these took place. the second set should represent proportional estimates of all reported crimes in order to see what place witchcraft occupied in the criminal statistics of the era. estimates of average figures compared with population figures and the size of the country concerned should be made as well, including density and other parameters. only then will it be possible to answer the question of 26 Kivelson, “Male Witches,” 618; smilianskaia, Volshebniki, 19, 187; a. s. lavrov, Koldovstvo i religiia v Rossii 1700–1740 gg.

Brian p. levack estimated that the total number of europeans prosecuted for witchcraft probably did not exceed 90,000 with an average execution rate of 47 per-cent of all convicted. the majority of prosecutions took place in germany and neighboring countries. levack also pointed out that the number of persons brought to trial does not reveal how many people became the objects of informal accusations (for example, a slander) or how many were formally accused but never brought to trial.29the chronology of witch-hunts is important as well. the hunts as such occurred in the period 1560–1630, followed by a decline in persecutions and prosecutions. however, the period in which hunts occurred varied according to the region involved. in central and eastern europe (including Russia), such panics were delayed until the eighteenth century because the social, economic and cultural conditions that facilitated witch- hunting in the West did not develop until then.30 thus we return to the “delay” model in historiography, which is deeply embedded in the methodol-ogy of social evolution. according to this view, Russia could only experi-ence witch-hunts when all the social, economic and cultural conditions required were in place. the country never experienced a “major witch craze”, because western demonological theory was absent.31 however, the question remains: Why then, given that this theory had finally taken shape by the beginning of the nineteenth century, did no hunts or crazes occur within the Russian empire?the collected material, which allows us to extract some figures,32 shows that the number of people (583 people in total or an average of 3.57 individ-uals a year) prosecuted in Russia between 1622 and 178533 was comparable 29 Brian p. levack, The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe (london: pearson, long-man, 2006), 20–24.30 ibid., 235.31 ibid., 236.32 in the absence of systematic research, the estimates are based on the use of both pub-lished and unpublished cases used by specialists: antonovitch, Koldovstvo; novombergskii, Koldovstvo; Kivelson, Op. cit.; smilianskaia, Op. cit.; lavrov, Op. cit.; as well as on my own research in the Russian state archive for ancient acts (Rgada), the Russian state Mili-tary historical archive (RgVia) and the central state historical archive of st petersburg (tsgia spB). the numbers given are very approximate and reflect the situation in the country only partially, and may therefore be quite unrepresentative.33 1785 was the year when witchcraft ceased to be a felony and was referred to special courts called sovestnye sudy (equity courts) that dealt with minor offences, but prosecutions"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"120 marianna g. muravyevafigure 5.2.

Zguta was the first one to point out that the individuals accused of being witches were predominantly men (fifty-nine men to every forty women, according to him), which was confirmed by Ryan, Kivelson, lavrov and smilianskaia. Kivelson, in her early article, claimed that only 32 percent of all the accused in her data-base were women, explaining the disproportion by the lack of opportuni-ties for women due to strict social and family control to commit criminal offences. in her later article on male witches in Russia, she develops the idea of different social roles, insisting that gender was not a primary fac-tor in witchcraft accusations and that they had much more to do with 35 Kivelson, “Male Witches,” 607."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"122 marianna g. muravyevathe social status and ethnicity of the accused.36 developing this idea fur-ther, lavrov offers four sets of factors to explain the predominance of men among those accused of being witches: that men constituted a clear major-ity among the professional sorcerers; that both men and women were much more likely to ask for help from professional male sorcerers than from female witches; that women seldom copied spell books and used them (because of their low literacy); and, finally, that women more often reported men for witchcraft than vice versa.37 i am not going to decon-struct these factors as they are explicitly gender-biased and drawn from quite specific and incomplete data (from the cases of the secret police, who collected information about all sorts of supposed forms of sedition against the monarch or his/her policies), but the general tendency to deny that gender mattered because prosecuted witches were predominantly male needs to be noted.it is quite symptomatic that another male scholar, Konstantin Bog-danov, criticizing this simplistic attitude, pointed out that the general social image of women and the image that emerges from court cases are quite contradictory: this is to say that the popular image of a witch does not correspond with the court image of a person accused of witchcraft. he claims that court proceedings provide very specific data for research, which reflect administrative and legal aspects of the relationship between the state and the population.38 thus the apparent dominance of male-sorcerers in the available court statistics contradicts the most enduring and common topos in literary and folkloristic tradition of a witch being an (old) woman. Bogdanov cites numerous religious and political texts in order to show that misogyny was as typical for Russia as it was for the rest of europe. his explanation of the disproportion in court cases in terms of the gender of the accused refers to the distribution of power in Russian society; he insists that the state and its apparatus were very focused on controlling men rather than women, simply because women were not in the public sphere.39Ryan takes a more consistent approach, suggesting that this dispropor-tion results from the very specific data used by scholars as well as from the 36 Kivelson, “through the prism of Witchcraft,” 83–85; Kivelson, “Male Witches,” 611–623.37 lavrov, Koldovstvo, 117–118. 38 K. a.

Rather, it should concentrate on the system of power relations and gender constructs which placed witchcraft in a very special position within the social and power structure of society. the research-ers should be looking into the structural characteristics of the crime of witchcraft (what kinds of magic practices men and women were accused of ), the treatment within procedural law (whether men and women were treated differently throughout the procedure) and the consequences of the criminal prosecution for both men and women (how the sentence given—death penalty, lashes, penance or penal labor—influenced their lives and the lives of their families).the eighteenth-century data available may be quite useful in spite of its specificity of origin. there are 363 cases involving at least 442 accused. 114 (31.4 percent) of these cases involve 140 women (31.6 percent of the accused). several types of witchcraft accusations are represented in the cases: witchcraft (including casting spells, malevolent magic and fortune-telling etc.)—155 cases (42.6 percent); suspicion and accusation (including false) of witchcraft—39 cases (10.7 percent); asking a witch for help— 6 cases (1.6 percent); healing—8 cases (2.2 percent); possession by demons and connections with the devil—12 cases (3.3 percent); possession of herbs and magic books and letters—119 cases (32.7 percent); the rest—unknown practices.

Moreover, the proportion of women tried for witchcraft between 1564 and 1660 decreased over time: from 1564 to 1578 women constituted 40 percent of the accused, but by 1646 to 1659 this number had dropped to below 10 percent.44 even in southern germany, the stronghold of female witch-hunts and lurid demonology, men constituted 27 percent of all the accused during its main persecution period between 1625 and 1630, when approximately 642 persons were arrested.45placing men within the feminized concept of witchcraft, lara apps and andrew gow suggested that early modern demonologists had their own gen-der constructs, which they incorporated into their theories and which were essentially misogynist, but they still did not omit men, allowing them to be witches too. on the level of popular knowledge, gender constructs differed so that men could play a prominent role by acting as professional magicians.46 scholars tend to oppose these concepts, but i would argue that they con-stitute a coherent view of the gender hierarchies: fear of the (supernatural) power of women and reassurance of the (dominant) position of men.The Crime of Witchcraft: Authorities, Courts and JurisdictionsRyan, following the pre-revolutionary lawyer levenstim, pointed out that Russia had no unified and coherent legal system until the nineteenth 319–338; Marko nenonen, “ ‘envious are all the people, Witches Watch at every gate’: finnish Witches and Witch trials in the seventeenth century,” in New Perspectives on Witchcraft, Magic and Demonology.

Witchcraft as a crime stood exactly at the crossroads of these jurisdictions, as available court records suggest.the account of laws on witchcraft given by levenstim and then devel-oped by Zguta and Ryan prompts the conclusion that until well into the eighteenth century these ordinances, edicts and sporadic entries in the general law codes were not the products of any coherent policy and were introduced as quick responses to contemporary situations. thus seventeenth-century practices of referring witchcraft cases to the state’s jurisdiction on the basis of ivan iV’s ordinance to apply the Stoglav’s (Rus-sian orthodox church council of 1550, the council of hundred chapters) decisions in relevant cases (including witchcraft)49 were quite consistent with the general trend in Muscovy to divide jurisdiction over contested cases between the church and the state. although the Ulozhenie (law code of 1649) never explicitly mentions witchcraft as a crime, the article that deals with evil intent against the tsar and his family’s health is clear enough (chapter 2, art. 1) while the whole of chapter 1 is devoted to blasphemy and rebellion against the church, excluding witchcraft.50 the Ulozhenie did not include many other crimes such as, for example, sexual offences 47 Ryan, “Witchcraft hysteria,” 62–80; Ryan, The Bathhouse at Midnight, 408–428. 48 Polnoe sobranie zakonov Rossiiskoi Imperii, 45 vols [hereafter PSZ] (st. petersburg: v tipografii ii otdeleniia, 1830), vol.

Demonology and Russian lawscholars saw the absence of lurid diabolism and demonology during witch trials in Russia as another peculiarity of Russian witchcraft. it has been assumed that western european witch-hunts were based on the devel-oped concept of diabolism. to be accused of witchcraft was associated with having dealings with the devil, often in the form of some sort of pact and sexual relations with the devil or demons. Western witches were explicitly deemed “servants of satan”. in different ways Zguta, Ryan and Kivelson all insist that Russia was not familiar with this level of theologi-cal discussion of diabolism, while smilianskaia and lavrov say that Russia had a very developed popular demonology, which successfully substituted for theology.55 levenstim, “sueverie,”; Worobec, Possessed."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" russian witchcraft on trial 131Zguta explained the absence of lurid diabolism as the result of a dif-ferent understanding of sorcery as a relict of paganism and the influence of the pantheistic concept of the universe. Russian witches, he insisted, could be tried and punished, much like english witches, for the secular crime of malign sorcery—but not for heresy.56 criticizing Zguta, Ryan gives quite a detailed account of the demonology of pre-petrine Russia, but still concludes that there was no sophisticated theology of witchcraft, arguing that what Russia was lacking was western scholasticism and con-sistent canon law.57 Kivelson’s analysis suggests that only a few cases con-tained any reference to satan as the central figure, which makes it difficult to apply any western standards here.58the eighteenth century brings demonology into the picture, as peter i distinguished between demonic and non-demonic magic. trials also give evidence of the presence of satan and of pacts being concluded. n. n. pok-rovskii, one of the few soviet historians of witchcraft, paid a considerable amount of attention to the connection between popular eschatology and the figure of antichrist in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. he insisted that the references to satan in many popular and old believers’ treatises constituted enough evidence of criminal activities for the cases brought in front of the synod court to be prosecuted accordingly. the synod classified those writings as heretical, establishing a direct connec-tion between heresy and nepotrebnye pis’ma or wrongful letters.59 ol’ga Zhuravel’ (gorelkina) presents several cases where a pact with the devil was made as a means of securing a better future, advancing one’s career and ensuring one’s financial stability. thus one petr Krylov, dreaming of riches and social status, decided to renounce god and make a pact with satan by writing a letter (which was tantamount to an acknowledgement of satan) and signing it with his own blood.60the phenomenon of klikushi (people possessed by demons), who were mentioned in sources well into the seventeenth century, marks a deep 56 Zguta, “Witchcraft trials,” 1205–1207.57 Ryan, “Witchcraft hysteria,” 55–62, 81.58 Kivelson, “Male Witches,” 609–610; Kivelson, “lethal convictions.”59 n. n. pokrovskii, “narodnaia eshatologitcheskaja ‘gazeta’ 1731 goda,” in Issledovania po drevnei i novoi literature, ed. a. dmitriev (leningrad: nauka, 1987), 290–297; idem., “ tetrad’ zagovorov 1734 goda,” in Nauchnyi ateizm, religiia i sovremennost’, ed. a. t.

By the seventeenth century, west-ern demonology was also quite familiar, as the writings of petr of Mohyla (Mogila, 1597–1647) confirm.62 nikita tolstoi, developing this tradition in the early twentieth century, insisted that slavic demonology represented a mixture of popular ideas and learned images of the devil and demons.63 Zhuravel’ presents a range of popular plots involving the devil in seven-teenth-century Russian novels: the renunciation of god, the procedure of such renunciation, and a renunciation letter; renunciation of the church and the ignoring of the sacraments; the renunciation of one’s family and kin and fraternization with the devil; employing the devil as a servant, and the result of his services (usually winning over women and money).64 considering that Zhuravel’ analyzes popular novels, it is quite difficult to claim that the notion of a pact between the devil and a human being was unknown or known only in certain circles of pre-petrine Russia.61 see the special law against klikushi issued by peter i: PSZ, V, no. 2906 (1715). see also the book on klikushi by christine d.

Russian witches, she claims, were driven to magic by the need to earn a living rather than sexual attraction to satan, and as such remained free of erotic associations.65 this could also explain the predominance of men over women among the prosecuted, as the lack of sexual liaisons between female witches and satan deprived accusers of one particular form of illicit female behavior and put women on the same footing as men. however, sexual attraction to evil and satan constituted a popular plot in several demonological novels in the seventeenth century. the Povest’ o besnovatoi zhene Solomonii (A tale of the demon-possessed woman Solo-monia) represents a typical case. the main character, solomonia, is the daughter of a priest and she engages in sexual relations with the devil on her wedding night, after her husband left the room. every day demons in the bodies of handsome young men come to her and have sex with her. When her husband learns of this he takes solomonia to her father, but demons find their way to her. they try to control her, ordering her to kill her father and live with them. When solomonia refuses, they torture her. she gives birth to six demons colored black and blue. finally another woman, who had lived with demons before, teaches her how to rid herself of their power. solomonia follows the rite, which includes cursing demons in the church, going on pilgrimages to the tombs of certain saints and having visions of female saints, and finally recovers. in 1671 solomonia told the story of her cure to the ustiug authorities when they questioned her and the priest leading the investigation wrote down the story and his conversations with solomonia.66 solomonia was not put on trial, pos-sibly because she was cured through christian rites. such plots involving sexual relations between women and demons were quite widespread in Russian literature and if in the cases that have been discovered sex was not mentioned, there might well be a different explanation (we probably have yet to find such cases, or they were destroyed due to their nature, as many courts regularly cleaned up their archives in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries).65 Kivelson, “Male witches,” 610.66 a.

Witchcraft accusations became subject to criminal pro-cedure when they caused serious disruption in the public sphere or when the plaintiffs could prove that such disruption would take place. fear of a breach of contract or the concluding of an unlawful contract with the intent to harm a private citizen had not penetrated the minds of officials and judges, as the private citizen was not the focus of state law. it was up to the local community to negotiate ways around magic, interpret certain actions and enact punishment for them.Russian law also focused more on the result rather than on the cause. the majority of the court records available confirm that the notion of pre-meditation and planning did not interest judges as much as the actual result: harm done, persons killed, animals injured, and so on. the satanic pact suggests planning and choice, and the contract involves agreement between at least two parties on certain activities that would lead to their mutual benefit. peter i tried to introduce this differentiation, ordering much harsher punishment for witchcraft resulting from a satanic pact. in order to have a more detailed picture and more consistent explanations, one should definitely place witchcraft not within the ethnographical or religious ideas of the age, but within the legal frameworks of the time and determine how it operated as a crime, not as magic.the focus on diabolical witchcraft and demonology has a long history in the european historiography of witchcraft, but recent research has weak-ened this emphasis.

What the native populace regarded as com-mon districts presented a challenge to national aspirations. this was espe-cially the case for the conflicts between sweden and denmark-norway in a period of territorial state formation. the sami and their special pattern of mobility were considered by the nordic state authorities as subjects in need of proper integration into the individual realms. the indigenous way of life caused increasing concern for representatives of the emerging state powers.1 Gradually, the effort to control the native people of the con-tested territory came to center around sami skills in performing different kinds of magic. Portrayed as evil witches from the remote north, the sami became infamous all over Europe as The Lapland Witches—a favorite and powerful motif in travel narratives, literary fiction and demonology 1 lars ivar hansen, “tax, trade and diversification among the northern sami during the 16th century,” in Transference.

Golden (santa Barbara: aBc-clio, 2006), 625–627. a most relevant comment on the lingering images of the witches up north is the chapter on “locke and the lapland Witches” in ann talbot’s book The Great Ocean of Knowledge. The Influence of Travel Literature on the Work of John Locke (Brill: leiden and Boston 2010), 45–62. the concept of the lapland witches refers back to the indigenous people of the north, the sami (formerly known as laplanders or laps/lapps), who live in the northern part of russia, finland, norway and sweden. today the sami call their land Sapmi, and the whole area of northern scandinavia and northern russia is often named the north calotte. for a fruitful discussion of the categorization and classification through the centuries relating to designations such as “sami”, “lapps” and “finns”, see Bjørg Evjen and lars ivar hansen, “one people—many names,” Continuity and Change 24, no. 2 (2009): 214–216."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" witchcraft and ethnicity 143Kildin. having run aground on a submerged rock, the flagship Victor had been heavily damaged and had to be careened at Kildin. the repairs took several days. the travel logs show that their visit gave them ample time to explore local flora, nature and the way of living. shortly before the ship set sail to vardø, one of the king’s men, Hans Lindenov, came into con-tact with a sami who could “gand” (ganfinnus), or cast spells. lindenov paid the sami in order to hear news from copenhagen. unfortunately, lindenov had to leave rather hastily while the sami was beginning his preparations. it is suggested here that the sami was in the middle of his trance-like ritual connected to prophecy. Even though this story concludes rather abruptly because of the dane’s departure, it is of interest because it tells of acquaintance with sami sorcery. this russian sami could send his soul sufficiently far away to discover the fate of people living in copenha-gen. the danes’ belief that the ability to “gand” was synonymous with evil sorcery or maleficium and shamanism, is also notable. Evil witchcraft and shamanism could be considered the black and white sides of the same belief system.traces of cultural encounters with the magic of the northern sami can been found in the two travel logs of the king’s personal secretaries, sivert Grubbe (1566–1636) and Jonas carisius (1571–1619). at the end of may 1599, while the ships were docked in vardø and making preparations for their homeward voyage, the king was paid a visit by several sami bailiffs. the king made use of this opportunity to gain information on the impo-sition of swedish taxes on the sami inhabitants of northern fennoscan-dia. carisius, however, was more interested in one of the deputy bailiffs who could “gand”. Grubbe also described his meeting with a “gand-sami” ( ganfinne):there was a gand-sami on the island, who was called Quikwas. the district Governor of vardøhus, hans olsen Koefod, referred to him and told me how he had said that our captain [meaning the King] was in great peril on board his ship, but that he, on such-and-such a day, would return unharmed, something which actually happened. this Quikwas gave me one of his sons, who looked like a dwarf with an odd appearance, but his mother refused to let him go.33 my translation from rune Blix hagen and Per Einar sparboe, eds., Kongens reise til det ytterste nord.

Even though numerous witches had been put to death at the stake throughout norway and denmark, at the end of the sixteenth century no one had yet instigated a similar policy of per-secution towards the sami for their particular skills. But not too many years would elapse before christian iv turned into a monarch agitated by demons, eager to root out all forms of sorcery, including the practices of the sami. as a collective group, the sami posed a threat to the territo-rial integrity of denmark-norway, its state-building and its endeavors to expand and spread civilization and christianity in the far north.since the voyage to the northern regions was his first major foreign ven-ture, christian iv made sure that an efficient and energetic commanding officer was commissioned at vardøhus. the aforementioned Hans Olsen Koefod was endowed with vardøhus fortress and the county of finnmark in June 1597. he traveled vast distances in northern norway in the win-ters of 1597/98 and 1598/99 in order to investigate swedish taxation of the sami. he presented his extensive findings to the king. it is likely that it was Koefod’s report on the swedish drive towards the northern coast of norway that convinced christian iv himself to sail northwards.

Between 1639 and 1749, in the regions of swedish and finnish lapland, at least seventy-three sami males and only three sami females were prosecuted on charges of using drums and practicing sacrificial rituals. few of them received death penalties, however. for the cases of the northern parts of finland and sweden, see the article by Karin Granqvist, “ ‘thou shalt have no other Gods before me (Exodus 20:3)’.

Ever since the norse sagas had been written, this feature of the indigenous populations of the north had been well known. 9 despite the fact that the sami comprise a minority in this connection, my numbers show higher figures than scholars have previously believed. in his classical essay from the late 1960s on the European witch-craze, h. r. trevor-roper called the sami “harmless dissenters” and wrote that “ . . . the lapland witches remained always outside the general European witch-craze”. about twenty years later William monter, in his survey of early modern scandinavian witchcraft, emphasized that finnmark “. . . saw prodigious numbers of witch-trials in the seventeenth century—all of them, however, directed against coastal fishermen rather than the inland lapps”. see hugh r. trevor-roper, The European Witch-Craze of the 16th and 17th Centuries (harmondsworth: Penguin, 1969), 91, and E.

While in his satanic trance, a shaman would communicate with his attendant demon, who, because of his tremendous acuity and faculty for moving swiftly, could divulge global events to his master. as a result of these beliefs, early eighteenth-century missionaries appointed to the sami regions made arrangements to burn the drums and to destroy the pagan gods of the sami. the demonizing of this pantheistic religion continued throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. as for the sami who believed in their abilities to predict the future, they were accused of being satanic prophets. this process can be perceived as an integrated part of the diabolization of scandinavian folk belief at the time.12“Gand” was the third kind of sorcery attributed to the sami. the cast-ing of spells—or “gand” (diabolicus gandus)—was what norwegians, and other pious men and women, feared most during the sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth century. the sami were known to cast their evil spells across vast distances. in fact, such spells could be carried upon the northern winds and result in illnesses among people far to the south in Europe. shooting or sending spells “on the wind” were also well-known 11 Else mundal, “the perception of the saamis and their religion in old norse sources,” in Shamanism and Northern Ecology, ed.

Bad things will happen to those who doubt the power of the knots, but they are nonetheless forced into seeking advice from sorcerers.20although saxo Grammaticus and olaus magnus mention the art of sami sorcery, this art is always placed within a greater tradition of nordic sor-cery. sami and other people within the old norse world are able to cause 18 Ekkehard Witthoff, Grenzen der Kultur: Differenzwahrnehmung in Randbereichen (Irland, Lappland, Russland) und europäische Identität in der Frühen Neuzeit (frankfurt am main: lang, 1997), 74ff.19 saxo Grammaticus, Gesta Danorum (København: det danske sprog- og litteratursel-skab & Gads forlag, 2005; first latin edition published in Paris 1514). 20 magnus, Description of the Northern Peoples, 173–174. see also the drawing that accompanies chapter 16 on page 172."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":" witchcraft and ethnicity 151bad weather. in both cultures magic is used in much the same way to cause harm and healing. nonetheless, the comments on sami sorcery and its diabolical characteristics were what caught the attention of early modern European people. the sami, like other peoples who lived on the geographical and cultural periphery, were considered to be the most potent sorcerers, and their practices increasingly became associated with the notion that the northern regions were a hothouse for the forging of witchcraft and idolatry. thus the sami who resided in the fjords and on the tundra of finnmark were drawn into the witch persecutions of the seventeenth century, albeit less than their norwegian neighbors, as we have seen.The Enemy Withinan observer might easily be led to believe that the indigenous people of the north, who were addicted to witchcraft, contributed to the large num-bers of witchcraft prosecutions in finnmark. as noted, those who lived on the social and geographic periphery of the known world, such as the indigenous sami and native american people of the early modern era, were easily regarded as the worst sorcerers. in her analysis of witchcraft during the age of early colonialism in mexico, laura a. lewis writes that “spaniards and others attributed the most powerful forms of witchcraft to chichimecs, who were at the greatest geographical and cultural distance from spanish colonization and thus from spanish control”.21 the sami were in the same situation as seen from copenhagen. however, although they were associated with evil magic and superstition, the indigenous peo-ple of the north were not those who suffered most when the witch trials increased in number, just as the indigenous peoples of america were less affected by them than the colonists. the native population was treated as a primitive people, and were basically left to themselves as long as there was no unrest or confrontation.22 the policy of a thorough integration of the ethnic minority into danish-norwegian society started at the begin-ning of the seventeenth century and lasted for the next two centuries. to make these indigenous people faithful tax paying subjects of the danish 21 laura lewis, Hall of Mirrors: Power, Witchcraft, And Caste in colonial Mexico (dur-ham: duke university Press, 2003), 108.22 Wolfgang Behringer, Witches and witch-hunts: a global history (cambridge: Polity, 2004), 144."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"152 rune blix hagencrown, the elite had to use strong and sometimes brutal measures. it must be remembered, however, that serious conflicts between the sami and the danish-norwegian authorities during this period of state penetration only emerged when their interests clashed. as anthony Giddens has pointed out, the general case in conquest states was that indigenous populations would be left to carry on their pre-existing patterns of conduct as long as they paid their taxes and did not hinder territorial expansion.23 for the local power elite the real threat came not from the border people but from the secret enemy within, or what Wolfgang Behringer has called the internal outsider.24 these enemies were found largely among the women living right in the middle of the norwegian settlements and communities on the shores of the arctic ocean.from the late sixteenth century onwards, the north became more valu-able to the expanding European economy as a result of the growing trade between England, scotland, the netherlands and northern russia. swe-den and denmark-norway, too, did everything they could to mark their territorial interests along the northern frontiers. a greater interest in the indigenous people of the north was a by-product of these aspirations to achieve increased territorial and financial control. as regards the witch trials in finnmark, it could be said that the trials began with the persecu-tion of a few sami individuals, but then gained full momentum when it was perceived that a collective network of evil norwegian women was at work. the judicial treatment of the terrifying sami helped to lay the groundwork for a much wider witch-hunt.

When scholars of shamanism claim that the sami people practiced full-blown shamanism, including shape shifting and soul journeys in a trace state during their interaction with the spirits, they almost always use norse literature, the sagas, folklore, arctic fairy-lore, or tales from outside observers, like the priest olaus magnus, as their evidence. very seldom does their evidence include empirical references to court records of the witch persecutions of the sami people.28in may 1627 a witchcraft case was brought against a man named Quiwe Baarsen, who lived at Årøya in the fjord of alta, finnmark. the judicial case 25 Gary K.

Baarsen was a sami who came from sweden and had been working for the norwegians at Årøya for some time. the judicial case turned out to be the very first description of the use of a sami drum (runebomme) in nordic legal sources. during the court session Baarsen described and explained the purpose and meaning of his drum playing, which he had been practicing for years together with other sami:When they want to cast runic spells, they use a sami drum. the drum is made of pine root and covered with reindeer hide or buckskin. they use a piece of wood as a handle under the drum, and claws from every kind of ani-mal native to this county are hung around the drum. nine lines are painted on the drum with alder bark; this bark is also used to paint domestic pillows in the huts of the sami. the first line on the drum represents their god, the second the sun, and the third the moon; these, in turn, symbolise the animals which can bring them luck or inflict harm on their enemies. and when two sorcerers (gandmen) want to test whose craft is the strongest, they paint two antler-butting reindeer on the drum. Whichever one turns out to be the strongest will indicate which master is cleverest and most cun-ning in his skills. and when they want to ask their apostle (spirit) about something, they will take some small pieces of copper and hang them on the wings of a bird made of copper, which they then place on the drum. strik-ing the drum with a horn hammer, lined with beaver skin, the bird leaps around on the drum and finally stops on one of the lines. then the master knows immediately what the apostle (spirit or demon, as some would say) has answered. to protect the master, or whoever else may be in the hut, from accident, they beat the drum with the hammer. he whose bird falls from the drum will not live long.29the bailiff also asked Baarsen if he had studied this craft for some time. such things were introduced to him when he was a mere boy, he replied. he was also asked how often he himself had been involved in beating such a drum. in reply to the question he said that he took part once when many sorcerers came together to drum, to see whose craft was strongest. the sami was also interrogated about who had taught him to raise the wind and make wind knots. Quiwe informed the court that he had learned his skills in swedish lapland many years ago.29 court Book (Tingbok), no. 2 for finnmark, march 1627–august 1633, 4a–5b, soren-skriveren i finnmark, kept at the national archive of tromsø. an English and German translation of the case against Quiwe Baarsen can be found on my website The Shaman of Alta at http://ansatte.uit.no/rha003/shaman.html (url retrieved 01.10.2012)."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" witchcraft and ethnicity 155in the verdict, the local court made it clear that Quiwe Baarsen had made a free confession about the use of diabolic spells and that he had used witchcraft to drown five people at sea by weather magic. he stirred up water and wind by throwing a piglet into the sea. the wind became too strong and five fishermen perished in the storm. Because of this kind of weather magic the court sentenced Quiwe Baarsen to be burned to death at the stake. however, the final verdict does not mention anything about drum playing.sixty-five years later, in early 1692, a similar case of witchcraft was brought against an old sami called anders Poulsen. the trial was held in vadsø, a small fishing community near the russian and swedish bor-ders in the very northeastern part of denmark-norway. in contrast to the Baarsen case, drum playing was at the center of this trial. indeed, this particular case turned out to be the most important source of informa-tion on the magic drums of the sami. historians have singled it out as the best source of information on sami shamanism in northern scandinavia.30 the sami’s confiscated magic drum has been preserved, and it is one of the few drums containing symbols and figures that have been described by the drum’s owner.The Magic Drumthe court, the local authorities, and the local council must have followed with great interest and curiosity how the sami anders Poulsen, on a winter’s day in february 1692, picked up his confiscated drum from the courtroom table, and how he began to give instructions in magic drum playing. in other words, Paulsen gave a stunning performance that the court had never seen before. crossing himself and his instrument, he qui-etly prayed in finnish as he lovingly played upon it—allowing all to see the drum in use. he shed bitter tears and appeared to be praying with the utmost devotion. the old man drummed with his hammer. the drum’s palm danced up and down with the movement of his hand and his heavy beats upon the drum’s surface, and he loudly implored his gods not to fear the norwegians whom he now played for. he continued to play and was finally answered by his spirits.30 Einar niemi, “anders Paulsen,” in Norsk Biografisk Leksikon, bd.1 (oslo: 1999), 84."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"156 rune blix hagenfigure 6.2. a shamanistic drum confiscated from andreas Poulsen in 1691. sámiid vuorká-dávvirat, de samiske samlinger, Karasjok. the photo was first used on page 310 in the book by hans h. lilienskiold, trolldom og ugudelighet i 1600- tallets finnmark, redigert og bearbeidet av rune Blix hagen og Per Einar sparboe, and published by ravnetrykk, university library in tromsø, tromsø 1998."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":" witchcraft and ethnicity 157anders Poulsen was charged with possession of, and the use of, an instru-ment otherwise known as a runebomme.

But they were less certain when it came to the exact nature of the crime. however, if they were uncertain about his drum playing, they knew that he some-how or another had been practicing improper and superstitious rites. in the 1692 case, the judicial conclusions and grounds for judgment show how the danish-norwegian people at the top of the regional power struc-ture interpreted what was said in a way easy for them and their culture to comprehend. a benevolent healer Poulsen was not, but rather a diabolic sorcerer and a worker of harmful magic. to them, Poulsen’s strange tales about the drum and about sami magic could be more easily understood when interpreted from a demonological point of view.31 throughout 31 all citations and the whole examination of the case are based on the legal documents from the court sessions in 1692; court book (Tingbok) no. 21 (1692–1695) for finnmark, 1a–15b, sorenskriveren i finnmark, kept at the national archive of tromsø.

We have to question the wisdom of continuing to use the word “shaman” in such a loose way to describe the category of magi-cian represented by the sami.37 marko nenonen, “ ‘Envious are all the People, Witches Watch at Every Gate’: finn-ish Witches and Witch trials in the seventeenth century” Scandinavian Journal of History 18, no. 1 (1993): 77–91. reprint in New Perspectives on Witchcraft, Magic and Demonology.

Based on his own studies, the danish folklore researcher Gustav henningsen has declared that in most parts of Europe, professional magicians do not travel into the spirit world. With references to the study of shamanism, he calls for a redefinition of its concepts and terminology and even the abandonment of the trance theory.39if the drumming and ritual activities of Baarsen and Poulsen can legiti-mately be called shamanism at all, it is certainly a kind of shamanism without any sign of soul journey into a deep trance, or shape-shifting. 38 William monter, “Gendering the Extended family of Ginzburg’s Benandanti,” Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft 1, no. 2 (2006): 222–226, citation from page 222.39 Gustav henningsen, “the White sabbath and other archaic Patterns of Witchcraft,” Acta Ethnographica Hungarica 37 (1991/92): 302."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" witchcraft and ethnicity 163When they communicated with their spirits, the two men were able to work as magical healers, prophets and wind magicians in the service of their local communities. for them, ecstasy and trance do not seem to have been necessary in order to communicate with the other world. to the sami, the drum was a compass and a divinatory instrument, which they beat to achieve a desired and specific end. the two sami men did not travel to their spirits, but instead summoned and were filled with them.the assessment of the two court cases from 1627 and 1692 reinforces the findings of those who criticize the view that ecstasy and trance are essen-tial characteristics in defining the shaman worldview. having studied the use of the terms “trance” and “ecstasy” during her fieldwork in siberia, the french anthropologist roberte nicole hamayon questions whether these designations are beneficial when examining shamanism. hamayon concludes thus:the shaman’s behaviour, called ‘trance’ by observers, is qualified by shaman-istic societies with reference not to a specific physical or psychic state, but to the shamans being in direct contact with the spirits.40in other word, she calls for a deconstruction of the shifting categories of shamanism. We may still regard Baarsen’s and Poulsen’s magic skills and rite techniques as shamanistic phenomena, if hamayon’s findings are accurate and her theories sound. referring to iceland and finland, ronald hutton speaks about “a subshamanic tradition of working with spirits, in which practitioners were usually men”.41 it seems very obvious and relevant to the issues surrounding shamanism to place the indigenous people of finnmark and fennoscandia in this tradition—a long-standing tradition in which healers and magicians can be labeled as shamans with-out altered states of consciousness. looking ahead, a cross-cultural recon-struction of the concept of shamanism should start by examining records from witch trials involving people displaying shamanic qualities, in the broadest sense of the term.40 roberte nicole hamayon, “are ‘trance’, ‘Ecstasy’ and similar concepts appropriate in the study of shamanism?” Shaman: an international journal for shamanistic research 1, no. 2 (1993): 7. it should also be said that some advanced experts in the history of religions and sami shamanism have been critical of the over-emphasis on shamanism as an ecstatic phenomenon, for instance Juha y.

KnutsenThe historiography of witchcraft trials in southern europe has been domi-nated by the study of trials in the various inquisitions. While much infor-mation may still be available from the inquisitorial archives, it could well be the archives of secular courts that hold the greatest promise for future research. These investigations are hindered by the poor accessibility and cataloguing of many of these archives, which makes such research a risky proposition for the phd students who are doing so much of the work on witchcraft trials.Jurisdictionsin spain and portugal and in spain’s italian possessions, the jurisdiction over the crimes usually referred to as “superstitions” was divided between the inquisition, various secular courts and the bishops. superstitions included everything from the night-flying of witches who collectively wor-shipped the devil, to sorcery, simple everyday magic and learned magic involving the invocation of demons. “superstition” was a convenient word, which avoided the necessity of addressing either the reality of the phenomena, or whether the proscribed activities actually worked or not. instead, superstitious acts and the beliefs they rested on were punished as deviations from catholic doctrine. research in all of these areas has cen-tered on the inquisition, which also tried the majority of the defendants.The inquisition looms very large in the historiography of iberian witch-craft trials for several reasons, not the least of which is the great fascina-tion that the holy office has held for modern researchers. another reason is more pragmatic: nearly all the surviving sources from the spanish inquisition have been assembled in one central repository in the Archivo Historico Nacional (ahn) in Madrid, while all documents from the por-tuguese inquisition are kept in the Arquivo Nacional da Torre do Tombo (anTT) in lisbon.

We know more about the episcopal courts, which were very active in trying people for superstitions, but we do not have any thorough studies of their activities since very little of the documentation has survived.6 spanish secular and episcopal courts have left us much better sources than their portuguese counterparts, even though these also have lost much, if not most of their archives, which are spread out and frequently not indexed. it is clear that hundreds if not thousands of cases for superstitions were tried in secular and episcopal courts in spain, and the vast majority of executions for such offences in spain were ordered by secular courts in catalonia. The spanish inquisi-tion’s tribunal in sicily appears to have been able to maintain its juris-diction over crimes of magic. only a few cases were tried in secular and ecclesiastical courts before the suppression of the holy office in palermo 1 There is one exception, as the archives from goa are lost, but they are of no concern to us in the current investigation. charles amiel, “The archives of the portuguese inquisi-tion: a brief survey,” in The Inquisition in Early Modern Europe.

The relatively good preservation and easy access of inquisitorial sources should make them easier to handle for future comparative studies, in combination with other documents such as baptismal records, notarial documents, and so forth.Scope and ChronologyThe most reliable numbers for trials come from portugal. The total num-ber of known superstition cases tried by the portuguese inquisition’s three tribunals between 1540 and 1774 is 912, while the bishops handled some 2,000 cases in the dioceses of coimbra alone in the years 1640 to 1770.8 The numbers for other bishoprics and secular courts are unknown. in sicily we find mention of 456 trials for superstition in the inquisition,9 and a few trials in other jurisdictions, as mentioned earlier. There are no available figures for the number of trials in Malta, since the archive of the inquisition has not been indexed and we await a comprehensive study. The estimates of the total number of trials and executions from secular courts in catalonia range upwards from 400, while a document from 1620 speaks of more than 1,000 executions in the preceding years alone.10 The published number for peninsular spain and Mallorca is 4,923 documented inquisitorial trials in the trial summaries, with notable 7 Maria sofia Messana, Inquisitori, Negromantici E Streghe Nella Sicilia Moderna (1500–1782) (palermo: sellerio editore, 2007), 100–01; giovanna fiume, La Vecchia Dell’aceto: Un Processo Per Veneficio Nella Palermo Di Fine Settecento (palermo: gelka, 1990). 8 paiva, “portugal,” 920. 9 gustav henningsen, “The database of the spanish inquisition,” in Vorträge Zur Justizforschung, Geschichte Und Theorie, Band 2, eds. heinz Mohnhaupt and dieter simon (frankfurt am Main: Vittorio Klostermann, 1993), 58.10 gunnar W.

The majority of the trials for diabolical witchcraft stem from the northern half of the iberian peninsula, with a few outliers in sicily and Malta, and none in southern spain.The earliest trials date from spain in the fifteenth century, and all areas show trials in the sixteenth century, through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and even into the nineteenth century. in spain and portugal the inquisition tried such cases until it was disbanded in the nineteenth century, but the activities of secular and episcopal courts after that are unclear. Trials continued to take place in other courts in sicily after the suppression of the holy office in 1783, while no such trials are known to have taken place in Malta after napoleon invaded the island and disbanded the inquisition in 1798.SpainThe study of witchcraft trials in spain has been completely dominated by the study of the spanish inquisition. This has led to two common miscon-ceptions of witchcraft trials in spain: that these trials were always con-ducted by the holy office, and that they almost never resulted in death sentences. research undertaken in the last decades shows the opposite; a large number of witchcraft trials were held in local secular courts and resulted in executions.crimes labeled as superstitions by the holy office included everything from telling the future and finding love or money to sorcery and diaboli-cal witchcraft perpetrated by night-flying cannibalistic witches who wor-shipped the devil and caused physical harm to crops, animals and humans. 11 henningsen, “The database of the spanish inquisition.”12 see for example María Tausiet, Ponzoña En Los Ojos.

There charges of sorcery and magic dominated, while satan’s servants were found in the rural areas of northern spain.The many inquisitorial trials for love magic, treasure hunting, fortune-telling, magical healing and so on, are obvious candidates for future study. so far there has been little study of individual types of cases, even though there are ample sources. following a more general trend in spanish his-torical writing, most studies have instead focused on a single geographi-cal area and studied all trials for superstitions there. studies of individual inquisitorial districts and tribunals usually contain a section on trials for superstitions as well. More fruitful than most regional studies was e. Wil-liam Monter’s classic study of the tribunals of the aragonese secretariat, roughly half the tribunals on the spanish mainland, plus sicily.13 This study laid out the differences and similarities between a number of tri-bunals, and brought attention to the connections between france and witchcraft trials in northern spain.14The inquisition was never the only court to hold jurisdiction over witchcraft in spain. Various secular courts could try the accused witches for acts of maleficium, while the bishops retained jurisdiction over reli-gious aspects of these trials. The inquisition’s claim to jurisdiction rested primarily on the demonological interpretation of witchcraft as apostasy and devil worship, and thus as formal heresy. The holy office in spain was never able to claim exclusive jurisdiction over these crimes, and it fre-quently seemed uninterested in trying to do so. recent research indicates a significant variation in the inquisition’s attitude towards asserting its jurisdiction over these crimes over time and between the different tribu-nals.15 differing opinions on the desirability of letting others handle these cases occasionally led to severe infighting in some tribunals.16The only study to compare trials in all three jurisdictions is María Tausiet’s excellent book on witchcraft trials in Zaragoza, which is also, 13 e.

We have already touched on these first two misconceptions, and shall now turn to the final one: that witchcraft trials ended in spain in 1614.The fact that convicting somebody of diabolical witchcraft during the inquisition became very difficult did not mean that such accusations ceased, that other courts did not continue to prosecute alleged witches, or that the inquisition stopped trials for other kinds of superstition. Quite the contrary; the majority of such trials that have come to our knowledge were in fact conducted after 1614. The belief that witchcraft trials in spain ended in 1614 is therefore a misunderstanding. They did not end; they sim-ply changed venue and form, as different courts dealt with witches while the inquisition continued to try other superstitions. several works cited in this article deal with the period after 1614, either exclusively or as part of a longer time span. Most of them focus on trials in the holy office.The period of trials for superstitions in spain that we currently know the least about is the period after 1700. María Tausiet has made a contribu-tion in this area, with a study of alleged witchcraft and possession at the beginning of the nineteenth century.25 a further contribution will come from Marisa pedrós ciurana, who is currently investigating eighteenth-century trials in Valencia. The sources from the holy office for this period are in fact abundant, and the inquisition continued to prosecute “super-stition” long after it abandoned any attempt to prosecute collective devil worship by malevolent flying witches.26 This is therefore a field where we can expect to greatly increase our knowledge in the future.

We know practically nothing about the connec-tion between conversos and witchcraft trials in spain, and while we now know much more about the Moriscos and superstitions than about the Jews, we are still awaiting a study on this.28 it is important to bear in 27 ricardo garcia cárcel reported a total of 15 trials for superstition among the 2,354 cases tried by the inquisition in Valencia up to 1530. ricardo garcía cárcel, Orígines De La Inquisición Española: El Tribunal De Valencia 1478–1530, 2nd ed.

Therefore it did not distinguish between orthodox and possibly superstitious Muslim practices, labeling everything simply as “matters pertaining to Muhammed’s sect”. it is thus possible that Moriscos escaped prosecution for superstition or witchcraft simply because they were perceived as performing islamic rituals. The separation between Muslim orthodoxy and heterodoxy are outside the remit of this article, and strictly not a matter of witchcraft trials, but these subjects merit research and may inform us of islamic magical practices that have influenced european magic.The presence of large religious minority groups of Jews and Muslims was, of course, one of the things that set spain apart from most other european countries.29 The impact of the Muslim population in rejecting the demonological conception of witchcraft caused southern spain to have very different trials than northern spain, which more closely resembled southern france. Trials for superstition in southern spain mainly involved accusations of some concrete magical acts of love magic or treasure hunt-ing that could be defined as physical rituals involving tangible objects. in the north there was also a substantial number of trials involving accusa-tions of collective devil worship at the witches’ sabbath, of night flying, diabolical sex, and mysterious damage to crops, as well as infanticide and cannibalism. There are clear french influences in this, both in the basque country and in catalonia (though not in galicia), with named individuals crossing the border and making accusations against spanish women.30 so far nobody has studied trials on both sides of the border, which would seem to be a promising avenue for future research. similarly, the appar-ent dichotomy between cities and countryside merits further study. as bernd roeck shows,31 there are a number of ways of explaining why cities and towns prosecuted fewer witches than rural areas. yet witches were certainly discussed in spanish cities, and stories were published.

This is certainly one distinction between barcelona and the catalan countryside, but it is also relevant when considering the border with france, which was frequently heavily militarized and occa-sionally engaged in fortunes of war and peace negotiations. This gave the local authorities greater autonomy, but also opens up the possibility that witchcraft trials were used to loosen Madrid’s grip on the border areas, both by ambitious local elites and by the french government. further-more, many of the areas that saw large-scale witch trials and witch-hunts involving paid witch finders seeking out witches, were part of feudal juris-dictions. Johannes dillinger’s observation that “[o]ne of the reasons why about half of all executions for witchcraft took place in the empire is that many of its principalities offered people without any legal training what-soever the chance to influence criminal procedures critically” could easily refer to spain where feudal jurisdictions and village communities close to the french border provided just such possibilities.32 When the inquisi-tion came across these witch finders they were inevitably convicted of superstition—and sometimes tortured to find out if they had entered into a pact with the devil, but by then they were already responsible for numerous trials and hangings in secular courts.33spain produced a number of demonological treatises, some of which have been published in modern editions. There is ample room for new studies of these texts, their production, distribution and use. for example, we know next to nothing about the reading habits, or indeed the librar-ies of the spanish inquisitors. from the list of possessions of a deceased inquisitor we know that he owned a copy of the Malleus Maleficarum,34 while in some cases we find references to demonological treatises among the authorities given in the margin of the page as support for opinions.35 famously, la Suprema, the inquisition’s central council in Madrid, warned the inquisitors in calahorra not to believe everything they read in the 32 Johannes dillinger, “The political aspects of the german Witch hunts,” Magic, Rit-ual, and Witchcraft 4, no. 1 (2009): 68.33 Knutsen, Servants of Satan, 105–8; alcoberro, “el caçador de bruixes.”34 ahn, inq, lib 738, fol. 204r. 35 for example in Biblioteca Nacional, Ms 2440, fols, 82r–84v."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" topics of persecution 177Malleus Maleficarum.36 it is clear that the inquisitors knew and used demonological literature, but our knowledge of this is so far anecdotal and unsystematic. The inquisitors themselves are still not very well known to us, and in this there is also an opportunity to learn more about witchcraft trials. for example, we could learn much by a study of those inquisitors who moved between tribunals that handled trials for witchcraft and those that only prosecuted acts of sorcery. such a study would also be a way to tackle the question of the connection between witchcraft trials in spain and those in the spanish colonies, trials which have so far been generally treated as separate phenomena.37 The inquisitors were trained jurists, and depended on external theologians known as calificadores for advice on theology. This is another subject that has received scant attention, and which would certainly have an impact on our knowledge of witchcraft tri-als. The calificadores usually classified any defendant accused of “supersti-tions” as suspected of an implicit or explicit pact with the devil, no matter how innocuous the alleged facts of the case. Their importance for witch-craft cases is obvious.another matter we should consider is that of child-witches. There were hundreds of such trials in spain, and contrary to common statements about these trials they were not a late phenomenon.38 rather, they started very early in spain. one of the most chilling testimonies to this is the yearly report from the inquisition’s tribunal in calahorra for 1540, which stated that in that year they had penanced “30 boys and girls between 10 and 14 years old for being witches”, as well as eight boys and girls who were older than fourteen.39 These children were not sorcerers; they were night-flying diabolical witches who had sworn to serve the devil. This was not the first instance of child-witches in spain, and the discovery of such a large number of them did not trigger any reaction other than the routine search for culprits. large numbers of child-witches continued to be tried for decades after this, but these trials seem to have been restricted to the basque country. in galicia, catalonia and aragon the alleged witches were 36 henningsen, The Witches’ Advocate, 347.37 a rare exception is gustav henningsen, “The diffusion of european Magic in colo-nial america,” in Clashes of Cultures: Essays in Honour of Niels Steensgaard, eds.

This is surely a phenomenon that deserves greater attention than it has received so far.an important aspect of the witchcraft trials in the basque country came to light in 2004, when gustav henningsen finally published a source col-lection that had been three decades in the making. it included newly discovered material from secular courts, which revealed the systematic extra-judicial abuse and torture of accused witches.40 This had two aims: first, to make the alleged witches confess, and secondly to prevent them from going to the witches’ sabbath. The latter aim was achieved by keep-ing the alleged witches awake and occupied by improvised processions and charivaris that included on at least one documented occasion the rape of the women accused of being witches. The accused were tortured to make them confess for two reasons. firstly, their families tortured them because the inquisition did not execute and confiscate the properties of those who confessed to being witches. This logic reportedly also caused violence against suspected witches by their relatives in catalonia. sec-ondly, their “confessions” were reported to the inquisition and formed the basis for the denunciations against them and the evidence that justified their arrests by the holy office. all of this raises new questions, such as the extent of such violence, and what it can tell us about fear of witches. There is obviously much to learn here about the belief in witches, their power and the spiritual or magical power of the inquisition. it surely can-not be coincidental that forced confessions did not result in lynchings but in denunciations to a court that historians have always characterized as mild in its treatment of witches. This also demonstrates that the archives of secular courts can tell us a great deal about witchcraft trials even when they themselves did not try witches.Portugalas in spain, research has focused on the activities of the holy office, and much of what has been said about spain also applies to portugal. given the complete preservation of inquisitorial archives and the total loss of material from the secular courts, the natural focus and limitation of portu-guese witchcraft studies has been the inquisition. compared with spain, 40 gustav henningsen, ed., The Salazar Documents (leiden: brill, 2004), 62–74."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":" topics of persecution 179portugal had fewer inquisitorial witch trials, but it has left better records of those that were conducted.The main study is by José pedro paiva, who has studied the 818 pre-served trials in the portuguese inquisition’s archives from the years 1600–1774,41 while francisco bethencourt has investigated the sixteenth century.42 They paint a picture of a skeptical inquisition which passed death sentences extremely rarely in cases of superstitions. notably, the portuguese inquisitors did not face a significant number of trials for dia-bolical witchcraft, while the demonological literature was certainly known in portugal.43 This is all the more striking when we know that the por-tuguese inquisition used torture extensively, submitting more than half of all those accused of superstition to formal sessions of torture.44 here widespread use of torture did not bring about mass trials of witches with ever-increasing numbers of forced confessions. despite this extensive use of torture, the pact with the devil figured in only 36 of 818 trials, accord-ing to paiva.45The portuguese demonological literature consisted of a total of three books, only two of which have come down to us in preserved copies. it is therefore hard to see this as a future field of research, although the absence of worry and fear of the witches is a notable characteristic of both books.46 This matches the lack of urgency of the portuguese witchcraft trials, which never became witch-hunts or witch panics.We are able to follow the development of the individual trials better in portugal than in spain because the archives of the portuguese inquisition have been preserved more fully. Thus we know that only one in twenty denunciations actually led to a formal trial.47 no such figures are available in spain because the registers of denunciations have been lost.

The inquisition did receive enormous amounts of information and numerous denunciations for various types of offences; however, the inquisitors rarely showed a great inclination to pursue cases of superstitions, and the number of acquittals indicate thorough consideration of the evidence.48 The fact that the vast majority of denunciations never resulted in a trial confirms the picture of a cau-tious inquisition that was not very eager to try this kind of case. it could also indicate that the inquisitors only prosecuted those cases where they felt the evidence was solid. alternatively, we might take it to mean that there were many frivolous denunciations. The thousands of denuncia-tions that never resulted in trials is a unique corpus of sources that should make for a very interesting study if anybody would venture to work on it. The well-preserved sources have also allowed paiva to study the social roles and standing of the accused witches, and the ways their neighbors attempted to neutralize their harmful potential. some even allowed sus-pected witches to act as godparents to their children in order to protect the children from witchcraft.49given the loss of the archives from secular courts, the massive loss of episcopal archives and the work done on the inquisition, there may appear to be less room for new research in portugal than in spain. on the other hand, the preservation of much more extensive sources about each trial will allow for a more detailed study of individual types of tri-als, or the placing of them into their local context. one study of magi-cal healing has emerged,50 and others could well focus on other types of magical practices and beliefs. There is a massive amount of information on various forms of magic available, opening up the opportunity for stud-ies on magical practices and beliefs. given the richness of the portuguese inquisition’s archive and the union of portugal and spain from 1580 to 1640, it appears it would be fruitful to make a comparison between the countries, or simply the border areas. another point of comparison might be those cases which originated in the portuguese colony in america but were tried in portugal, since the portuguese inquisition never established an american tribunal.48 paiva puts the number at 10 percent. for barcelona the acquittal rate was 27 percent and for Valencia only 2 percent. ibid., 219; Knutsen, Servants of Satan, 64–65.49 paiva, Bruxaria E Superstição, 295.50 Timothy dale Walker, Doctors, Folk Medicine and the Inquisition: The Repression of Magical Healing in Portugal During the Enlightenment (leiden: brill, 2005)."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":" topics of persecution 181The recent debate opened by erik Midelfort about the significance of chain trials driven by torture would benefit from a study of the extensive use of torture in portugal.51 The connection between torture and massive chain trials does not hold true there, and the excellent sources should make it possible to study extensive torture that produced a very different result than we generally expect in such cases. What does not look likely to change is the overall number of known trials in portugal, or the fact that portugal did not suffer mass trials of alleged diabolical witches.Sicily and Maltaas part of the spanish empire, sicily was subjected to the spanish inqui-sition. as elsewhere, the holy office found an abundant crop of alleged witches. it also found something different: a local fairy cult, the “ladies from outside”.52 This fairy cult and the large numbers of clerical practitioners of learned magic are the two defining characteristics of the witchcraft trials in sicily. There were some later trials in secular courts, including “the old vinegar lady” so masterfully studied by giovanna fiume, where notions of witchcraft were suppressed in favor of the more modern interpretation of poisoning.53 a recent book by Maria sofia Messana is the most important contribution to the study of witchcraft trials in sicily.54 While her book may appear authoritative and exhaustive, fiume has already shown how a study of even a single trial can serve to expand our knowledge.51 h. c. erik Midelfort, “Witch craze? beyond the legends of panic,” Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft 6, no. 1 (2011); Valerie Kivelson, “lethal convictions: The power of a satanic paradigm in russian and european Witch Trials,” Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft 6, no. 1 (2011).52 gustav henningsen has published a number of articles on the subject, including gustav henningsen, “ ‘The ladies from outside’: an archaic pattern of the Witches sab-bath,” in Early Modern European Witchcraft.

This point was made by e. William Monter,55 and confirmed by Messana,56 but has not been followed up by a separate study, perhaps in part because of the paucity of sources. it does seem like a worthwhile subject to pick up, given the prevalence of clerics in similar cases else-where in the Mediterranean region.57 The case summaries that form the backbone of our knowledge of the inquisition in sicily are quite brief, making comparative investigations both imperative and difficult.The parts of the archive of the holy office in sicily containing trials of faith and information on the inquisition’s familiars were burned in a public ceremony after the abolition of the tribunal in 1783.58 The main source to these trials is therefore again the relaciones de causas preserved in the ahn in Madrid. here we find mention of 456 trials for superstition,59 broadly conforming to the Mediterranean pattern of numerous defen-dants accused of performing various magical rituals, and very few trials of witches taking part in collective adoration of the devil or performing maleficium. Many of those accused of diabolical witchcraft did in fact take part in the fairy cult and were donas de fuera. unlike the benandanti so famously studied by carlo ginzburg,60 gustav henningsen found that the donas de fuera never became fully demonized in the popular mind. They never willingly confessed to being witches when arrested. only by lengthy interrogations could the inquisitors produce such confessions, and the process of turning a dona de fuera into a witch had to be repeated with every arrest.61 Maria sofia Messana came to the opposite conclusion.62What is not contested is that the donas de fuera at first saw themselves as doing good deeds. They were organized in companies together with the fairies, and traveled in spirit to rich feasts. in addition, they toured the town at night, entering every house and rewarding those that they found in good order while punishing those that were unkempt. henning-sen called it an archaic cult and Messana also believes it may have had roots in antiquity. some 90 percent of those tried were female, and they 55 Monter, Frontiers of Heresy, 176–79.56 Messana, Inquisitori, Negromantici, 112.57 Knutsen, Servants of Satan, 68.58 Messana, Inquisitori, Negromantici, 55, 60–61.59 henningsen, “The database of the spanish inquisition,” 58.60 carlo ginzburg, I Benandanti: Ricerche Sulla Stregoneria E Sui Culti Agrari Tra Cinquecento E Seicento (Torino: g. einaudi, 1966).61 henningsen, “The ladies from outside,” 205–06.62 Messana, Inquisitori, Negromantici, 573."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":" topics of persecution 183were given much harsher sentences than the convicted males.63 in addi-tion to their dream travels and parties, there was a physical side to the fairy cult, since most of those brought before the inquisition were magical specialists.64 There was some linguistic confusion around the term dona di fuora, as the sources make plain. The term was used both to describe the fairies that accompanied the humans on their nightly travels and also the humans themselves.65 furthermore, the inquisitor diego garcia de Trasmiera wrote to Madrid that dona de fuera was the sicilian term for what in spain was called bruja, the witch.66given the public burning of the inquisition’s archive and the success of the holy office in maintaining exclusive jurisdiction over witchcraft trials, it seems unlikely that there will be significant findings of new tri-als in sicily. some surprising new evidence may come from the graffiti of the inmates of the inquisition’s jail in palermo which has recently been discovered, but in general the future of witchcraft studies in sicily will be limited to the more intense study of trials already used by henningsen and Messana. The greatest potential here seems to be to use the brief trial summaries in combination with other sources, and to see the sicil-ian trials both in a local context and in broader comparisons with spain, mainland italy and Malta.The islands of Malta and gozo formed part of the kingdom of sicily, and as such they were under the suzerainty of the king of spain. from 1532 to 1789 Malta was entrusted to the Knights of st. John who used it as the base for their military activities in the fight against islam. an inquisitorial tribunal was established in Malta, and thereafter this was the court which tried accused witches. it is not surprising that the inquisition was able to enforce its sole jurisdiction over witchcraft in a territory that was, after all, ruled by a religious order.Malta was one of the most multi-cultural societies in the early modern world, ruled by a multi-national religious order which enslaved as many Muslims as it could capture and welcomed all catholic traders to its port. This is reflected in the trials, which show a wide variety of magical prac-tices by persons with very varied geographical origins. Trials for magical crimes were numerous and lasted until napoleon’s invasion of Malta in June 1798 led to the suppression of the inquisition.63 ibid., 556.64 henningsen, “The ladies from outside”, 200–02.65 ibid., 195.66 Messana, Inquisitori, Negromantici, 554."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"184 gunnar w. knutsengiven the small size of Malta, it is no surprise that the number of studies of Maltese witchcraft trials is also quite low.

Malta was part of the kingdom of sicily, which had some very distinct witchcraft trials. The inquisition tribunal in Malta formed part of the roman inquisition, which also handled witchcraft tri-als on the italian mainland. it seems natural to compare italian trials with those in Malta. The contemporaneous nature of mass trials of witches in southern france, northern spain and Malta also invites further research, not least because this was apparently the only time Malta saw mass trials, while spain and france had done so before. furthermore, since so many foreigners were prosecuted for sorcery on Malta, it should also be a very good starting point for a study of the spread and mixing of magical tradi-tions, popular and elite, oral and written. frans ciappara has shown that the eighteenth-century trials from Malta contain a few written magical treatises and instructions,70 even though the general Tribunal in rome had ordered that such material be burned after the trial.71 There is simi-lar material in the ahn in Madrid, and presumably elsewhere. some of the titles mentioned are also part of the common european elite magical tradition, such as the Clavicula Salomonis. a large number of those pros-ecuted on Malta were Muslim slaves,72 while such slaves were rarely pros-ecuted for these crimes in spain.

The sharing of jurisdiction over witchcraft by as many as three different judicial systems is something that spain, portugal and sicily have in common, which sets them clearly apart from france and the various protestant countries. in this lies a shared challenge for research and potential for future investiga-tions. research has so far been focused on the inquisition, and turning to secular and episcopal courts now seems to be the most promising way to further our knowledge in spain and sicily, while portugal and Malta seem unlikely to reward researchers in these areas.another way forward would be to consider the inquisitors who dealt with these cases, the theologians who advised them and the relation-ships with other jurisdictions. for example, Messana has pinpointed the inquisitor diego garcia de Trasmiera as somebody who turned fantastic stories of donas de fuera into diabolical reality more often than his pre-decessors had done.73 so who was he? did he serve in other tribunals in spain before or after sicily, and if so, did he try cases of diabolical witches there? These questions also present themselves in portugal and Malta. Malta is particularly interesting, in that all the inquisitors were outsiders who came to the islands for a limited time, while twenty-four of them became cardinals and two became popes.74 it goes without saying that witch trials conducted by two future popes are of the highest interest, but so far this has not been investigated.clerical magicians provide another subject that may be fruitfully stud-ied in all the jurisdictions mentioned here.

The search for hidden, forgot-ten or enchanted treasure pops up in several areas, but also shows clear regional differences. in portugal it was arab treasure that lured people, while in Valencia it was the generic “Moor” whose money was sought. in Malta, on the other hand, it was Jewish treasure that was believed to be hidden.75another similarity is the prevalence of mass trials of diabolical witches in northern spain and in Malta in the first quarter of the seventeenth cen-tury. This followed the mass trials in southern france. portugal and sicily did not have a similar outbreak of witch trials in these years. in fact, sicily saw the number of trials for superstition dip at precisely this time.76 The main outbreak of witchcraft trials in sicily followed immediately after the food revolts in palermo and catania in 1647 and the neapolitan revolt of 1648, resulting in four autos de fe in 1648 alone. Messana speculates that there was a clear connection, an instrumentalization of witchcraft accu-sations to recover the political equilibrium.77 a possible political use of witchcraft accusations to destabilize the situation in northern spain was suggested earlier in this article. both cases seem to offer possibilities for future investigations.an interesting fact is that the inquisition tribunals on islands devoted more of their time to witchcraft than did those on the mainland. Witchcraft made up 6 percent of the trials in the tribunals on the spanish mainland, and less than 4 percent in portugal. in sicily they made up nearly 8 percent, in sardinia 21, in Mallorca more than 14 and in Malta more than 30 percent.78 This is simply an observation, but it surely deserves closer scrutiny.Bibliographyalcoberro, agustí. “el caçador de bruixes, Joan Malet, l’home Que Va Terroritzar catalu-nya al sege Xvi.” Sàpiens, no. 71 (2008).amiel, charles. “The archives of the portuguese inquisition: a brief survey.” in The Inquisi-tion in Early Modern Europe.

When westerners think of modern witches, the kind that seems most commonly to occur to them consists of practitioners of a pagan religion venerat-ing deities of the natural world, a stereotype especially strong in Britain and the United States but found across most of europe and the english- speaking world. its oldest and most prevalent variety bears the name of Wicca, the standard anglo-Saxon word for “witch”. the foundation myth of this religion refers directly to older forms of belief: that modern pagan witchcraft represents a public reappearance of a surviving ancient faith which was persecuted in the witch trials of the early modern period. according to the myth, that religion was driven underground by the trials, to emerge intact in the mid-twentieth century.1 this version of history has now largely been abandoned by modern witches themselves, especially by the most highly visible and published of them. it lingers as a position of faith among some prominent witches in america and in what might be termed the backwoods of contemporary witchcraft elsewhere.2 the fact that it was so powerful in the mid-twentieth century was largely a reflection of the wide acceptance by academics of the belief that the peo-ple accused in the witch trials had been practitioners of a surviving pagan religion. Propounded most famously by the english egyptologist Margaret Murray, it was accepted in Britain by anthropologists such as Mary doug-las and historians of the status of Sir George clark, christopher hill and 1 the classic statements can be found in Gerald Gardner, Witchcraft Today (London: rider, 1954) and The Meaning of Witchcraft (London: aquarian, 1959); doreen Valiente, Where Witchcraft Lives (London: aquarian, 1962); Patricia crowther and arnold crowther, The Witches Speak (isle of Man: athol, 1965); June Johns, King of the Witches (London: davies, 1969); Starhawk, The Spiral Dance: A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess (San francisco: harper and row, 1979) and Dreaming the Dark: Magic, Sex and Politics (Boston: Beacon, 1982).2 ronald hutton, The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft (oxford: oxford University Press, 1999), 369–88."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"192 ronald huttonSir Stephen runciman.3 its evaporation among most modern witches, and their acceptance of their religion as essentially a twentieth-century cre-ation, has likewise been the result of its abandonment within the world of professional scholarship. it is in many ways impressive for practitioners of a religion to recognize the falsity of its traditional historical claims with such speed. it is both a sign that pagan witchcraft has its own viability as a spiritual system, and that it is less given than some other faiths to fundamentalist responses.two other aspects of the Wiccan foundation myth are of more impor-tance here: from whence it came, and why it was functionally so effective in creating a new religion. as with so much else about modern pagan witchcraft, the myth was both an international product and one that was rooted in major cultural developments. the first of these developments was the loss of literal belief in witchcraft by european elites in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. this immediately raised a histori-cal problem in how to characterize the early modern witch trials. the shift of opinion invited the verdict that they had been a huge and tragic error, for which somebody had to be blamed. this was exactly the oppor-tunity taken by the enlightenment philosophers, especially Voltaire and the authors of the Encyclopédie. they used the trials as a stick with which to beat traditional religious beliefs and established churches, an attack broadened and made populist in the era of the french revolution.4 in the period of reaction which followed the fall of napoleon, a potentially effec-tive answer was found. over thirty years ago, norman cohn identified the pioneering authors of this approach as the German scholars Karl ernst Jarcke and franz Joseph Mone.5 What has generally been missed is the polemical context of their work, which represented a powerful reaction-ary response to the enlightenment challenge. it conceded that witchcraft was an illusion, but argued that the witches tried in the early modern period had been members of a persisting pagan religion. furthermore, 3 Margaret Murray, The Witch-Cult in Western Europe (oxford: oxford University Press, 1921); G. n. clark, The Seventeenth Century (oxford: oxford University Press, 1945); Stephen runciman, preface to paperback edition of Witch-Cult in Western Europe by Mar-garet Murray (oxford: oxford University Press, 1964); christopher hill, From Reformation to Industrial Revolution (London: Weidenfeld & nicolson, 1967), 115–18; Mary douglas, “Sor-cery accusations Unleashed: the Lele revisited,” Africa 69 (1999): 177–93. 4 roy Porter, “Witchcraft and Magic in enlightenment, romantic and Liberal thought,” in Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: The Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries by Marijke Gijswijt-hofstra, Brian B.

Margaret Murray was the best known, because she carried out the greatest amount of apparent research to substantiate it, but she was only one of a large group and a long line, and it is important to note that the essentials of the founda-tion myth of modern pagan witchcraft were already in place among lead-ing scholars by the mid-nineteenth century.8 the twentieth century, in fact, really added only two further components to it, one american and one British. the american one actually commenced in the 1890s but only achieved wide popularity in the 1970s, the two phases being related to successive stages in the development of modern feminism by character-izing the witch-hunts as a specific means by which men could suppress women.9 the British contribution, according to all present evidence, dates from the 1940s.10 it recreated this imagined witch religion, and declared that it had survived in secret, at least in england. from there it spread, as has been said, across the modern western world.this, however, itself begs the question of how the foundation myth could be so potent, and serve to create a religion strong enough to survive when the historiographical rug was pulled from beneath its feet. from the time of Michelet onward, it characterized pagan witchcraft, in its essence, 6 Karl ernst Jarcke, “ein hexenprozess,” Annalen der Deutschen und Ausländischen Criminal-Rechts-Pflege, 1 (1828): 450; franz Joseph Mone, “Über das hexenwesen,” Anzeiger für Kunde der Teutschen Vorzeit (1839): 271–5, 444–5. 7 Jules Michelet, La Sorcière (n.p. 1862). 8 hutton, The Triumph of the Moon, 140–50, 194–201. 9 Matilda Joslyn Gage, Women, Church and the State (n.p. 1893); andrea dworkin, Woman Hating (new york: dutton, 1974), 118–50; Mary daly, Gyn/Ecology (Boston: Bea-con, 1978), 178–222.10 hutton, The Triumph of the Moon."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"194 ronald huttonas a counter-cultural religion par excellence, which could be pitted against all that liberals and radicals loathed and feared most in modern society, including sexism, the environmental degradation consequent on indus-trialization, and repression of the individual. all of these qualities are, indeed, firmly rooted in aspects of early modern depictions of witchcraft, and the religion created by the myth used the older images to oppose those three cultural phenomena directly. first, it was feminist. the witch is, after all, one of very few images of independent female power that tra-ditional european culture has bequeathed to the present. even now, this identification between witchcraft and women remains to some extent a puzzle. Specialists in early modern history have expended much effort on explaining it, plausibly, in terms of the social structures and ideologies of that period.11 the problem is that what they have done is to show how the gender stereotyping was assimilated into early modern ideological and social systems. this is a valuable exercise in itself, but the identification is much older, because ancient Greek and roman, and early medieval irish, German and Welsh witches are also stereotypically female.12 further-more, it buckles against the fact that in areas such as iceland, normandy, estonia, russia and (initially) finland, the majority of those accused in the early modern period were male. these were societies which had the same religious, political and social structures as those which mainly accused women.1311 for a range of excellent analyses, see robin Briggs, Witches and Neighbours: The Social and Cultural Context of European Witchcraft (London: harpercollins, 1996), 257–86; James Sharpe, Instruments of Darkness: Witchcraft in England 1550–1750 (London: hamilton, 1996), 169–89; Stuart clark, Thinking With Demons: The Idea of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe (oxford: oxford University Press, 1997), 108–33; Lyndal roper, Witch Craze: Terror and Fantasy in Baroque Germany (new haven: yale University Press, 2004), 125–78; and raisa Maria toivo, Witchcraft and Gender in Early Modern Europe (aldershot: ashgate, 2008). 12 for the Greek and roman stereotypes, see daniel ogden, Night’s Black Agents: Witches, Wizards and the Dead in The Ancient World (London: hambledon continuum, 2008); for the irish, Welsh and German material, there is work in progress by the present author. 13 Kirsten hastrup, “iceland: Sorcerers and Paganism,” in Early Modern Witchcraft, eds.

We seem to be left with the less satisfying but seemingly more correct explanation that different areas of the world have had different gender stereotypes for witchcraft, and that witches have been regarded as women in most parts of europe since history began. this would fit what is known of ancient european religions in general: public rites were usually carried out by men, as heads of social and political units. they could be supported and advised by male specialists, such as priests, seers or dru-ids. Likewise, men could work magic, but by learning it from books or teachers.14 Women seem to have been, by contrast, regarded as natural repositories of magical power and knowledge, less regulated, more spon-taneous and more dangerous. that is why all the ancient european cul-tures named above resorted to them as oracles and prophetesses, when normal religious systems appeared inadequate as channels of communi-cation with the divine. conversely, it seems to have been supposed that women could dispose of destructive magical power far more easily than men; hence the female stereotype of the witch across most of europe, where this gendered belief system obtained. it may therefore be seen that the identification of witchcraft with female power runs very deep.the association of witches with the natural world is also old, and seems largely functional. for one thing, they were expected to understand nature because they used natural substances in their craft. More simply, how-ever, because their meetings, rites and revels were clandestine, they had to be held well away from centers of population, in meadows, woods or mountains. this linkage to the wild and green was to serve witches well in a modern age which commenced with the romantic cult of nature and has gone on to reckon with full-scale ecological crisis. the association of modern witchcraft with self-expression is also firmly based on early mod-ern images. theologically, of course, early modern witches were enslaved by Satan, and had to find his promises of reward ultimately hollow. in artists’ depictions of those witches’ activities, and sometimes in the fan-tasies projected during interrogations, they seem by contrast to be hav-ing a wonderful time. they are made into key images of misrule, disorder and freedom from moral constraint, and, whatever the grim implications of their activities to an early modern audience, they are clearly hugely 14 Prudence Jones and nigel Pennick, A History of Pagan Europe (London: routledge, 1995); fritz Graf, Magic in the Ancient World (cambridge: harvard University Press, 1997); Ken dowden, European Paganism (London: routledge, 2000); Matthew W. dickie, Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World (London: routledge, 2001)."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"196 ronald huttonenjoying themselves. this element of abandoned revelry and full-blooded taking of pleasure easily turned the witch into a modern icon of liberation in the positive sense. it enabled modern witchcraft to function as a reli-gion which celebrates the joys of living, especially sexual union, as things sacred in themselves. By a reversal of sympathies, images constructed to epitomize degradation and transgression could become a means to invest fleshly pleasures with genuine sanctity.15these processes of rehabilitation were much aided by the fact that mod-ern pagan witchcraft is a counter-cultural tradition by a double descent. it not merely embodies challenges to social and religious norms based partly on portraits of early modern witchcraft, but descends directly from the western world’s oldest and most continuous intellectual counter-culture. this is one that overlaps with witchcraft, but has generally bypassed it. the earliest surviving rites of modern pagan witches certainly draw heav-ily on the nineteenth-century myth of a surviving pagan religion. they are also, however, very obviously dependent on the western tradition of ritual magic, and in particular that branch of it commonly called theurgy. this is the use of particular actions and words to produce a direct contact between the human celebrant and a deity, amounting at most to a full if temporary union of the two. Such an enterprise is at the core of the mod-ern witch religion. to achieve it, modern witch liturgies employ invoca-tions, at times taken directly from early modern magical texts, notably the Key of Solomon.16 the informing spirit and ambition of the rites, however, are older still, coming out of the angelic magic of the Middle ages, espe-cially that which sought the beatific vision of the divine, and before that from arabic and hellenistic texts. the Greek Magical Papyri, in particular, represent by far the closest counterpart to modern pagan witchcraft in the ancient world.17 By the steps just recounted, modern witchcraft can credibly claim a direct and unbroken lineage of descent from antiquity. it is just not the one that it has been claiming.that descent was along the interface of two very different religious traditions.18 one was european, and rooted in ancient Greece, where a 15 ronald hutton, The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles (oxford, UK; cam-bridge, Mass.: Blackwell, 1991), 337; hutton, The Triumph of the Moon; ronald hutton, Witches, Druids and King Arthur: Studies in Paganism, Myth and Magic (London: hamble-don and London, 2003), 87–192.16 hutton, The Triumph of the Moon, 223–6.17 hans dieter Betz, ed., The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation (chicago: chicago University Press, 1986).18 hutton, Witches, Druids and King Arthur, 87–192."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" witchcraft and modernity 197distinction was developed between religion and magic. in the former, the human agent asks the supernatural for attention and aid, and then awaits a response. in the latter, the human has some power to attract or compel the supernatural to respond in a particular way. this distinction, with the implication that magic is inherently disreputable and dangerous by contrast with religion, was appearing among the Greeks, at the latest, by the end of the fifth century Bc. the medical treatise “on the Sacred disease”, which dates from that period, praises the supplication of divine beings for medical aid while disapproving of the use of materials and spells to coerce them into helping, as impious.19 Such a distinction must have achieved greater currency after its adoption by Plato, who attacked those who promised, for payment, to “persuade the deities by bewitching them, as it were, with sacrifices, prayers and incantations”.20 in Plato’s century, the fourth Bce, there is a well-recorded case of a woman actually put to death at athens for trying to avert the righteous anger of gods by using enchantments.21 the same opposition between religion and magic went straight from Greece to pagan rome, if it was not indigenous there, and was articulated in the first century ce by the scholar Pliny and the playwright and philosopher Seneca.22 it was an aspect of roman popular culture—apuleius declared with disgust that the “common herd” defined magic as the coercion of the gods—and had serious legal implications. Both apuleius himself and apollonius of tyana, accused of being magi-cians before courts, secured acquittal by insisting that they merely prayed to deities for aid, instead of trying to compel them.23 from pagan rome the contrast passed directly into medieval christianity, and from that into modern intellectual culture.2419 W. h.

By this means it passed, either directly or through the medium of arabic, into the medieval european world, and there formed the basis for a clandestine counter-culture that has persisted ever since.26Pagan witchcraft represents, in one respect, its modern flowering. it provides a very convenient spiritual vehicle for modern humans who have largely lost the traditional human fear of the divine and of an associated, menacing and capricious, natural world. it allows such people a relation-ship with deities based more on affection, alliance and negotiation, like that of a magician with a benevolent invoked spirit or—to some extent—of a witch with a familiar one. it is interesting to speculate that modern pagan witchcraft might well have recognized and claimed such an inheri-tance, had it not been for the apparent scholarly orthodoxy, at the time when it was developed, that early modern witchcraft had been a pagan 25 robert Kreich ritner, The Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice (chicago: chicago University Press, 1993); Jan assmann, “Magic and theology in ancient egypt,” in Envisioning Magic, eds.

What is more, they were able to carry it out in enormous quantity. if the roman historian Livy is correct and properly understood, the body counts produced by witch-hunts in the roman republic surpassed anything in the early modern period. one wave of trials in rome in the second century Bce claimed two thousand victims and another three thousand.28 furthermore, early modern people were themselves drawing on this ancient heritage. Shakespeare’s witches’ chant in Macbeth was modeled partly on one found in an Epode of the roman poet horace, while when Ben Jonson put witches into the initial antimasque for his Masque of Queens, he filled his published footnotes to it with references to ancient authors. the swimming test for witches so prominent in the early modern period, to see whether they floated or sank, is first recorded in the law code of the Babylonian king hammurabi, over three thousand years before.29 early modern perceptions of witch-craft are studded with very old folkloric motifs. to class the famous witch trials as a christian crime, however well rooted this may be in liberal and radical thought since the enlightenment, is therefore not only to miss the whole point of european witchcraft beliefs but to underestimate the embedded nature of them.the second caution relates to the fact, recently emphasized by both Wolfgang Behringer and myself, that the figure traditionally called a “witch” in english is found in every inhabited continent of the world.30 27 Gardner, Witchcraft Today, 15–16.28 Livy, History of Rome, XXXiX.41, XL.43.29 G. r. driver and J. c.

Peter Geschiere firmly established this in the african context, and it is now as relatively familiar an experience of anthropologists and journalists in that continent to find witch persecutions flourishing in cities among people who wear suits, jeans and t-shirts, and watch television, as it is among those with more traditional lifestyles. as part of this adaptation, the beliefs that support them are no longer themselves purely traditional. Some of the most vicious and extensive recent witch-hunting activity in africa has been inspired by evangelical christian churches based on the ameri-can model, which have introduced the concept of a satanic conspiracy to old beliefs in witchcraft exactly as occurred in fifteenth-century europe. the only real distinction is technological: the new concept is spread mainly by the medium of video recordings.42 the fact that it has spread from the West is itself highly significant. in 1994 Jean la fontaine reported on her investigation undertaken for the British government into the panic over alleged satanic ritual abuse of children. this panic had arrived in Britain from america at the end of the 1980s, spread mainly by employees of the social services, and depended on the belief that such abuse was one aspect of an international and secret religion of devil-worshippers who assaulted (and, according to some, sacrificed) children as part of bloody and orgi-astic rites. She concluded that no such religion existed, and, indeed, that satanic ritual abuse itself did not exist in Britain. She also pointed out that the belief was a direct survival of the stereotype of a satanic conspiracy that had powered the early modern witch-hunts. in the case of the panic over ritual abuse, it had mostly taken a secularized form whereby most of the people who propagated it had jettisoned a literal belief in Satan. nonetheless, they continued to believe in the existence of Satan-worship-pers who still behaved as early modern witches were said to have done. these people were now depicted as committing purely secular crimes, but as remaining a serious hidden menace to society. the presence of the theological element of early modern witch trials was therefore not needed to produce what proved to be a widespread and potentially very serious hunt, which resulted in children being taken into state custody, 42 Geshiere, The Modernity of Witchcraft; adam ashforth, Witchcraft, Violence and Democracy in South Africa (chicago: chicago University Press, 2005); “Saving africa’s Witch children,” Dispatches documentary, British television channel four, screened 12 november 2008 (for nigeria)."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":" witchcraft and modernity 205and legal actions being prepared against their parents, in several areas. What quashed the actions was a process which had acted to suppress the early modern trials: that, while not disbelieving in the possible existence of a satanic religion, the established legal authorities came to find the evidence unconvincing in these particular cases. Jean La fontaine’s inves-tigation then served to remove official belief in the religion itself.43elsewhere in the modern West, even the theological element of early modern witchcraft has been preserved, or revived. the belief in satanic ritual abuse was brought to Britain from america by self-conscious missionaries, who were as active and well-networked as late medieval dominicans or sixteenth-century jurists. although many of these, like the majority who propagated this belief within the nation, were secular-minded social workers, some were religious enthusiasts with a wholly lit-eral faith in the existence of the demons allegedly invoked. Within the United States during the 1980s, the same scare produced what has been called a major national crisis, including the longest-running criminal trial in american history and several heavy jail sentences. the beliefs behind it have likewise been exposed as having been reliant on fantasy and the application of leading questions to child witnesses was very reminiscent of those used upon the accused in many early modern trials.44 once again the work of Stuart clark on the “scientific” nature of early modern demon-ology is relevant here, showing as it did the internal logic and coher-ence of that thought system. More recently, the american folklorist Bill ellis conducted an analysis of the contemporary christian “deliverance ministry” in canada and the United States, showing how a very similar demonology, complete with satanic witches, could revive and flourish in the present day.45 Just as in the early modern period, the impact of theo-logical thought, in spreading the concept of a conspiracy that endangers society, has been increased at a popular level by an alliance with sensa-tionalist journalism and embodiment in a few influential books. Given the increasing strength and confidence of the radical religious right wing in the United States during the 2000s, and the accompanying polarization of american culture, this cannot necessarily be dismissed as a marginal 43 J.

What this meant was that the bewitched person had become too frightened to sleep or eat, thus weak-ening a system which was constantly flooded with adrenalin. all this put pressure on vital organs, especially the heart, and the failure of any one of those was sufficient to cause death.47 Since cannon’s time other medical experts have debated his theory and sustained it, save that the number of processes that are now recognized by which death may be induced by a state of mental suggestion, has been multiplied.48it follows from this that, in societies which have a firm belief in the power of witchcraft, bewitchment—whether really attempted or just 46 hutton, Witches, Druids and King Arthur, 275–6.47 Walter cannon, “Voodoo death,” American Anthropologist 44 (1942): 169–81. 48 G.

When the systematic study of early modern witch beliefs and trials was commenced about forty years ago, it rapidly grew into a major academic industry. the present collection of essays is one of the latest manifestations of that. the appeal of it has been largely that it offered an especially vivid insight into a world which we seemed to have lost. Like anthropologists working among remote tribal peoples, historians were presented with the intellectual and emotional challenge of coming to understand an alien mindset, and of furnishing their pupils and readers with a similar access to it. to do so convincingly and sympathetically is one of the finest demonstrations of disciplinary effectiveness and personal scholarly prowess. in this excursion into one of the less accessible parts of the foreign country that is the past, modern witches, if they were noticed at all, were regarded as an irrelevance, and commonly a nuisance, an attitude which has persisted among early mod-ern specialists into very recent years. those witches embodied, after all, a historical claim—that the early modern witch trials were directed against an ancient pagan religion—which historians themselves had come to per-ceive as utterly erroneous. it may now be argued instead that modern pagan witches actually have a lot in common with professional historians and other kinds of academics. their erroneous claim was, after all, taken directly from academic publications and founded upon apparent scholarly orthodoxy. on contact with historical revisionism, most of them aban-doned that claim, like good scholars themselves. instead they are con-scious, as historians should be, of the manner in which some ancient and"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"208 ronald huttonearly modern images of witchcraft may function well when transplanted and transformed to serve the needs of modern society. this process rep-resents not charlatanism or delusion, but a classic postmodernist exercise in reception, appropriation and subversion.What should probably concern specialists in early modern witchcraft much more is that the traditional figure of the witch, as central to the early modern trials, is not part of a lost world. it is not even an aspect of marginal societies in the postcolonial world, or of tiny and impotent subcultures in our own nations. it is now a major practical problem for governments around the globe, and it features as a component factor in ideologies that have increasing importance in the world’s most economi-cally and militarily developed states. in an important sense, it is possible that the long neglect by professional western scholars of historic witch-craft as a subject to which derision, contempt and dismissal ought prop-erly to be applied by the educated instead of investigation, reflected a real fear of the consequences of appearing to attach importance to it: scorn and neglect may have been key weapons in the ongoing attempt to finally eradicate the belief. those attitudes are no longer respectable for histo-rians, not least because they have not proved entirely effective. the fact that witchcraft has not turned out, after all, to be a dead subject should be a source of pride and excitement to those who work upon it. instead of representing a series of academic holiday snaps, it seems to have a vital living relevance after all. if education really is the key to protecting peo-ple both from death or injury by witchcraft, and from death or injury by witches, then historians are among the holders of that key.it should be a source of comfort and satisfaction to be able to suggest to scholars and students of a subject that the latter may be even more important and interesting than they had thought. in this case, however, i rather wish that i did not have reason to do so.Bibliographyankarloo, Bengt, and Gustav henningsen, eds.
