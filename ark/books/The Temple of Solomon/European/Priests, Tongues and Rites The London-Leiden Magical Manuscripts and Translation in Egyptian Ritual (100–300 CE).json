It is an attempt to throwlight on the social and cultural identity of the producers and users ofthe manuscripts by investigating the form, contents and layout of theDemotic and Greek spells that are found on the manuscripts PapyrusLeiden I384verso (PGM XII and PDM xii) and Papyrus London-Leiden (consisting of P. BM10070and P. Leiden I383;PDMxivandPGM XIV). The manuscripts can be dated by palaeography to thesecond or third century CE. The discovery of the ‘Theban MagicalLibrary’ is attributed to a group of anonymous Egyptian farmers, whoare supposed to have found the cache somewhere in the hills surround-ing modern Luxor sometime before1828. Due to the fact that thehoard of papyrus scrolls and codices was not found during a regularexcavation, nothing is known about the archaeological context of thelibrary. This is very unfortunate since the bilingual character of thelibrary poses some haunting questions about the identity of the origi-nal owner or owners of this collection of magical books. Who was ableto make sense of the variety of scripts and languages and why wereDemotic and Greek spells combined on a single manuscript? Infor-mation concerning the exact location of the find would have given afirst indication of the identity of the owner or owners. Was the collec-tion of texts found in a tomb, a temple or a private house? Were themanuscripts found together with other artefacts? If so, how did theserelate to the manuscripts? Were they buried with a corpse as funerarygifts or hidden from the Roman authorities out of fear for prosecu-tions? These questions can no longer be answered, so that, today, onlythe texts themselves remain as witnesses of what must once have been alively interest in the occult in Roman-period Thebes.The book is a slightly reworked version of my dissertation, which Idefended at Leiden University, the Netherlands, in2003.Theresearchproject came about as the result of my interest in the production and"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"xprefacefunction of texts in relation to the society and its members from whichthese texts originate. When, as a student of Egyptology, I took classesin Comparative Literature and became familiar with interpretativemodels to study the relationship between text and society in moredetail, I reflected upon the possibilities to apply these new insights toancient Egyptian texts. It was Günter Vittmann, one of my teachers atWürzburg University, who helped me out unintentionally, by directingmy attention to theDemotic Magical Papyri. This corpus of magical ritesand incantations dating from the Roman period not only continuesa long tradition of Egyptian magic and ritual, but also forms part ofthe more international, and in a way innovative, currents of magicalthought of the Greco-Roman period. As the spells are relatively well-preserved, the corpus is suitable to pose questions about the author’srelationship to the multi-cultural society of Greco-Roman Egypt, andabout concepts of tradition and authority in a country where the socialand cultural order was changing under the influence of a foreign elite,to wit: Greek and Roman settlers, soldiers, bureaucrats and rulers.The Research School of Asian, African, and Amerindian Studies(CNWS) of Leiden University provided me, from September1999untilAugust2003, with an inspiring environment and the necessary finan-cial and material means to conduct my research, for which I thank itsstaffand members heartily. I am highly indebted to my two supervisors,J.F. Borghouts and Mineke Schipper, for their time and confidence inmy abilities to complete this project. Maarten J. Raven, the curator ofthe Egyptian department of the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden te Lei-den, was always willing to give me access to the original manuscripts.I thank him for his friendliness and help and for giving me permissionto publish the photos of the ‘cipher’ alphabet and the papyrus scrapspasted to the verso of the Leiden part of P. London-Leiden. I alsothank Richard Parkinson and Carol Andrews, curators of the BritishMuseum, for allowing me access to the London part of P. London-Leiden in December1999.InJuly2000Heinz-J. Thissen invited me togive a paper on my research project at theSeminar für Ägyptologieof theUniversity of Cologne. I cannot thank him enough for his hospitalityover the weekend and for challenging me to formulate clearly my bythen still rather crude and preliminary ideas on the subject during ourlong informal discussions. In retrospect I realize that the foundationsfor the present book were laid out during this weekend. In the winterquarter of2002, I participated in a seminar on theGreek Magical Papyriat the University of Chicago. I am indebted to Christopher A.

The ancient text articulates a num-ber of clear-cut value judgements on Egyptian and Greek that arethought provoking and that throw an intriguing light on the coexis-tence of Egyptian and Greek language and script in the two Demotic-Greek magical handbooks that form the topic of this book, P. LeidenI384verso and P. London-Leiden, which belong to the corpus of theso-calledDemoticandGreek Magical Papyri. Since theCorpus Hermeticumand the two magical handbooks derive from the same native Egyptianpriestly circles, treatise XVI begs to serve as a steppingstone for thefollowing chapters on the use of script, language, idiom and imageryin these magical handbooks. TheCorpus Hermeticumis a loose collec-tion of seventeen treatises, written in Greek, dealing with theosophicalissues related to the salvation of man by means of knowledge (gnôsis)of the cosmos.1The texts formed part of a widespread current of eso-teric thought that flourished during the first centuries CE and sought itsinspiration in traditional Egyptian and Jewish religion combined withneo-platonic philosophy.2As such, the Hermetic treatises were as inter-national in contents and influence as theGreek Magical Papyri,whichwere written around the same time and contain references to this move-1The standard edition is A.D.

However,scholars are now becoming aware that the basic concepts of the Her-metic doctrines are in fact deeply rooted in ancient Egyptian religiousthought, which was still alive among Egyptian priests in the Romanperiod.4Treatise XVI is presented as a teaching of Asclepius to king Ammonabout the constitution of the cosmos.5As an introduction to his lessons,Asclepius wants to clarify some misunderstandings with regard to thelucidity of his doctrines.[1] I have sent you a long discourse, O king, as a sort of précis orreminder of all the others; it is not composed as to agree with vulgar3For an introduction to theGreek Magical Papyrias a corpus of ancient magicaltexts and a field of scholarship, see, chapter2.2. As for the intertextual relationships,an illustrative example, although not unproblematic, is the ‘Prayer of Thanksgiving’,which is preserved in three sources. The LatinAsclepiusgives the prayer as its conclusionand codex VI of the Nag Hammadi Library contains a Coptic version of the prayeramong its Hermetic texts (NHC VI,7:63,33–65,7).

An important and highly original defence ofthe Egyptian origin of the Hermetica is Fowden,The Egyptian Hermes. A Hermetic trea-tise in Demotic of which the earliest manuscript derives from the Ptolemaic period hasrecently been discovered, proving that the Egyptian priesthood was already workingwith these ideas at least a century before the GreekCorpus Hermeticumis generally dated:R.

That it contradicts even someof my own discourses will be apparent to you. My teacher, Hermes—often conversing with me in private, sometimes in the presence of Tat—used to say that those reading my books would find their organizationvery simple and clear when, on the contrary, it is unclear and keeps themeaning of its words concealed; furthermore, it will be entirely unclear(he said) when the Greeks eventually desire to translate our language totheir own and thus produce the greatest distortion and unclarity in whatwas written. [2] But this discourse, expressed in our paternal language,keeps clear the meaning of its words. The very quality of the sound andthe\u0002intonation?\u0003of the Egyptian words contain in themselves the energyof the objects they speak of.Therefore, in so far as you have the power, (my) king—for sure, you arecapable of all things—, keep the discourse untranslated, lest mysteries ofsuch greatness come to the Greeks, lest the extravagant, flaccid and, asit were, dandified Greek idiom extinguish something stately and concise,the energetic idiom of the (Egyptian) words. For the Greeks, O king, haveempty speeches capable only of logical demonstration, and this is justwhat the philosophy of the Greeks is: noise of speeches. We, by contrast,use not speeches but sounds that are full of action.[Corpus HermeticumXVI1–2]6These two paragraphs present a rather negative language attitude to-wards Greek, which is considered to be ‘extravagant, flaccid and (as itwere) dandified’, while ‘our paternal language’, i.e. Egyptian, is highlyesteemed as a language full of divine power and energy.7By using thephrase ‘ourpaternal language’, an amiable bond based on ethnicity iscreated between the narrator and the addressee and, at the same time,Egyptians are posited as the in-group opposed to the Greeks as the out-siders. According to the narrator, the hierarchy is not only linguistic butalso cultural, because the Egyptians have great mysteries, whereas theGreeks only have philosophy, which is presented as a mere play of vainwords. Because of this cultural inequality, Greeks are represented asbeing eager to obtain Egyptian knowledge. Unfortunately, since Greekis such a poor language, it is impossible to translate the energetic Egyp-tian sounds without losing their inherent power and without producingobscure texts. The message is clear: divine knowledge originates fromEgypt and it cannot be handed over to other cultural groups in gen-eral, and to the Greeks in particular. This essentialistic point of view6Tr. modified from Brian P. Copenhaver.7See also Heinz J. Thissen, ‘“.....α\u0003γυπτι\tων τ\r\u000e \u000fων\r\u000e.....” Zum Umgang mit derägyptischen Sprache in der griechisch-römischen Antike’ZPE97(1993)239–252."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"4chapter onereveals an Egyptian nationalistic discourse that brings the concept ofethnicity into the religious domain. Secrecy and secret knowledge hadalways been components of Egyptian religion, but were always definedin terms of initiation and cultic purity instead of ethnicity and culturalexclusivity.8In the text concerned, the narrator presents mysteries asan Egyptian monopoly that has to be defended against the curiosityof the Greeks. The most productive strategy to exclude Greeks fromthe Egyptian divine knowledge is to leave the Egyptian language unin-terpreted. The loss of inherent power of the Egyptian sounds sensiblymotivates the impossibility of translation, but the implicit reason is aconscious attempt to exclude. In such a case, the pretended impossibil-ity to translate becomes an effective inhibition to translate.However, the argument of the introduction of treatise XVI seems tobe contradicted by an ironic detail: the text itself has come down to usin Greek. The fervently argued inhibition to translate is trespassed bythe text itself. Moreover, there is no reason whatsoever to assume thatthe extant text is a translation of an Egyptian original. In all likelihood,the text was directly composed in Greek for a mixed audience ofdifferent ethnic groups, Egyptians and Greeks among others. This,then, constitutes a ‘paradox of translation’: in spite of a religiouslymotivated inhibition to translate the Egyptian language into a foreignidiom, translations or linguistic transgressions do occur.The idea that translations are apt to fail because of the inherentpowerful qualities of a given language’s sounds was a common issue inthe debate on magic and divination in intellectual circles during theRoman period.9For example, Origen, a Christian apologetic writer ofthe third century CE, defends the Christian refusal to call their Godby any other name, as for example Zeus or Jupiter, by referring to theimpossibility of translation:8Jan Assmann, ‘Unio Liturgica.

Butif the same spell is translated into any other language whatever, it canbe seen to be weak and ineffective.Thusitisnotthesignificanceofthe things which the words describe that has a certain power to dothis or that, but it is the qualities and characteristics of the sounds. Byconsideration of this kind we would in this way defend the fact thatChristians strive to the point of death to avoid calling Zeus God ornaming him in any other language.[Origen,Against CelsusI,25]10Iamblichus, a Neo-Platonic philosopher of the late third, early fourthcentury CE and a fervent defender of divination as a means of obtain-ing knowledge about the nature of things, explains, in the guise of theEgyptian priest Abammon,11to Porphyry of Tyre why the use of bar-baric names instead of Greek ones is to be preferred in magic:Since the gods have shown that the whole language of the sacred nations,such as Assyrians and Egyptians, is appropriate for sacred rites, therefore,we deem it necessary to communicate with the gods in a languageakin to them. Moreover, because this mode of speech is the first andmost ancient and, in particular, because those who learned the firstnames concerning the gods passed them on to us after having mingledthem with their own language, considered proper and suitable for these(names), we preserve hitherto the law of the tradition unaltered. For ifanything befits the gods, clearly the perpetual and unchangeable arenatural to them.[Iamblichus,On the Mysteries of EgyptVII,4,256]In this passage, Iamblichus not only uses the motif of the impossibilityof translation, but also asserts that Egyptian is the most suitable lan-guage for divine communication. He expresses a similar idea in a fol-lowing paragraph in which he retorts Porphyry, who had claimed thatthe mere meaning of words instead of their sounds is significant:From this then it becomes evident how reasonable it is that the languageof the sacred nations is to be preferred to that of other men. Becausewords, when translated, do not preserve entirely the same meaning; thereare certain idioms for every nation, which are impossible to convey inlanguage to another nation. What is more, even if it were possible totranslate them, they would no longer preserve the same power. Foreign10Tr. H e n r y C h a d w i c k .11As the treatise displays in many instances a remarkably high level of under-standing of ancient Egyptian religious concepts and practices, Philippe Derchain hasargued to take the opening line at face value and to regard the priest Abammon as thetrue author of the book: ‘Pseudo-Jamblique ou Abammôn?

For all thesereasons, these (words) are appropriate for the Higher Powers.Thus do away with the conjectures which fail in obtaining the truth:‘either the god invoked is Egyptian or speaking Egyptian’. Instead, it isbetter to understand that, as the Egyptians were the first being allottedthe participation of the gods, the gods rejoice when invoked according tothe rites of the Egyptians.[Iamblichus,On the Mysteries of EgyptVII,5,257–258]Greco-Roman authors in general not only afforded innate ritual poten-cy to the Egyptian language but also to the hieroglyphic writing sys-tem.12Hieroglyphs were understood as a pictorial sign system that wasnot made up of phonemes but of symbols directly referring to con-cepts. By virtue of divine inspiration, the symbolic character of the signswould enable a profound understanding of the fundamental nature ofthings. Or, as Plotinus, a third century Neo-Platonic philosopher, wrote:Each carved image is knowledge and wisdom grasped all at once, notdiscursive reasoning nor deliberation.[Plotinus,EnneadsV,8,6]As a result, the semiotic rules of the hieroglyphic writing system raisedgreat interest and several authors, like Plutarch and Clement of Alexan-dria, described some hieroglyphs together with an explanation of theirsupposed meaning.13They derived their defective knowledge undoubt-edly from theHieroglyphica, a now lost list of hieroglyphs with theirsupposed meaning compiled by Chaeremon, an Egyptian priest of thefirst century CE, if not from firsthand statements by Egyptian priests.14Horapollo, an Egyptian intellectual of the fifth century CE, came upwith a similar list of hieroglyphs, also calledHieroglyphica, the discoveryof which in the Renaissance played an important role in the Europeanintellectual construction of pharaonic Egypt.15A conspicuous trait of12For an overview, see, Erik Iversen,The Myth of Egypt and its Hieroglyphs in EuropeanTradition(Princeton1993), chapter2.

According to Clement of Alexandria, a Christian apolo-getic author of the second century CE, the hieroglyphic script consti-tuted the final stage of the priestly curriculum, after students had firstlearned Demotic and, after that, the hieratic script.16Learning thesemysterious signs was only given to the privileged, as only kings andpriests of outstanding character were deemed worthy of hieroglyphiceducation:For that reason the Egyptians did not reveal the mysteries that theyhave to passers-by nor did they transmit knowledge about the divine toprofane men; only to those who are to take up kingship and among thepriests to those who are deemed to be most fit according to upbringing,education and birth.[Clement of Alexandria,StromateisV, c h a p t e r7,§41.1–2]It becomes thus clear that Greco-Roman authors projected a feeling ofawe upon the Egyptian priesthood, which they presented as a closed-offcommunity and as the possessor of sacred—and desired—knowledgeby virtue of its ancient language and script.17The Greco-Roman authors were hence convinced of the esotericqualities of the Egyptian priesthood and its script and language. It ishowever open to discussion whether their conviction was based on asincere interest in, and profound understanding of, Egyptian cultureand religion. Their desire to find esoteric doctrines undoubtedly influ-enced their perception as much as their superficial knowledge of Egyp-tian culture. Among their sources were certainly early works like thoseof the Egyptian priests Manetho and Chaeremon, who wrote historieson Egyptian culture in Greek for a Hellenised audience in, respectively,the Ptolemaic and early Roman period.18It is however uncertain towhat extent their accounts were truly objective descriptions.

He not only had to secureand to position Egyptian culture among the different ethnic groups, hehad first of all to deal with, and defend the interests of the Egyptianpriesthood among the Macedonian ruling elite that acted as his patron.One way of gaining sympathy for the Egyptian priesthood would cer-tainly have been to live up to the expectations of the Hellenic worldto a certain extent and translate Egyptian notions into a ‘distorting’Hellenic idiom that emphasised elements as secrecy, divine revelations,etc. Since the original work is for the most part lost, these remarkscan only be tentative.20However, Plutarch relates that Manetho wasconsciously involved with the conceptualisation and acceptance of thesyncretistic Greco-Egyptian god Sarapis at the Ptolemaic court, whichreveals Manetho’s politico-cultural intentions.21This is even truer forChaeremon who served as a tutor to the young Nero at the court ofemperor Claudius (41–54CE).22Unfortunately, solely his description ofthe Egyptian priestly way of life is preserved in substantial fragments.23These excerpts describe the Egyptian priesthood in terms quite similarto those used in Stoic philosophy, valuing concepts of seclusion, reflec-tion and mental stability. Such an edifying picture of Egyptian priest-hood and of the contemplation of the hidden essence of the divine iscertainly aimed at raising sympathy for the interests of the Egyptianpriesthood.

Their audience then fervently acknowledgedthe image of the exotic Egyptian priest, so much so that, from theRoman period onward, Egyptian religion and priesthood became thechief topic of interest among other things Egyptian.This Roman-period discourse on Egypt was clearly at work in textsthat were produced and read within Hellenised circles, but it is wellconceivable that the native priesthood itself may have had no suchmystifying ideas about its social and ritual functioning. Moreover, it ishighly unlikely that the Egyptian priesthood acted as a single unani-mous intellectual body without a social and intellectual stratification.However that may be, treatise XVI of theCorpus Hermeticumplays withthe Greco-Roman fascination for the inherent power of the Egyptianlanguage and the secrecy of Egyptian traditional knowledge, in spite ofthe fact that the text originated in Egyptian priestly circles. This willedidentity of the alienated Egyptian priest being opposed to Greek out-siders functions also in the Greek sections of the magical handbooksof the Theban Magical Library, the subject of the present book, andtheGreek Magical Papyriin general.24David Frankfurter has introducedthe term ‘stereotype appropriation’ to explain the apparent paradoxi-cal situation.25According to Frankfurter, Egyptian priests, who had losttheir state subsidies with the introduction of Roman rule, had to lookfor new sources of income and found those in a Greco-Roman clien-tele willing to pay for divine illumination like, for example, a charactersuch as Thessalos of Tralles.26As a result, Egyptian priests acted to theexpectations of their customers and, so, took on the role of the exoti-cised Egyptian ritual specialist in daily reality as well as in the texts theywrote.The concept of ‘stereotype appropriation’ is a useful heuristic deviceto explain the image of an alienated Egyptian priesthood in Egyptiantexts, but its applicability could well prove to be restricted to texts writ-ten by Egyptian priests in Greek. Indeed, it has to be taken into account24This topic is treated in more detail in chapter6.25David Frankfurter,Religion in Roman Egypt.

As a con-sequence, these Demotic spells invite us to analyse to what extent theEgyptian priesthood of the Greco-Roman period indeed acted as theGreco-Roman authors imagined. The bilingual manuscripts circulatedundoubtedly among Egyptian priests, as the native priesthood formedthe only social stratum in society that was still able to read and writeDemotic in the Roman period. However, their relationship with Greco-Roman culture was different from that of the ancient authors discussedabove. Instead of forming part of, and constituting, the dominant cul-tural discourse, the native priesthood was subject to economic, politicaland cultural dominance of that same Greco-Roman ruling elite. Sucha contact situation of unequal power relations must inevitably haveled to social changes within the dominated group, to renegotiationsof social roles and identities within the local priestly community andthe Roman world at large. The outcome of this process will have beenvaried, depending on the particularities of the local context and thespecific interests of individual priests and their immediate colleagues,but certainly it will have been determined by a combination of resis-tance against certain views and practices of the dominant culture andassimilation to other aspects of the dominant culture’s ideology. Stereo-type appropriation is a clear example of the latter and forms an aspectof the more general term ‘mimicry’: the dominated subject is invitedby the dominant ideology to participate but only on the dominant cul-ture’s terms, of which writing in Greek is but one aspect.

The majority of manuscripts has been written in Greek,whereas one magical handbook has almost entirely been composed inDemotic. Several other handbooks contain parts, either short or exten-sive, in Demotic and Old-Coptic next to Greek sections. In certaincases these languages interfere to the extent that a Greek invocationis inserted into a Demotic recipe27or that a spell written in Old-Copticis accompanied by instructions for use in Greek.28The multiculturaland bilingual character of the magical spells suggests that the corpus isthe result of a desire to collect and combine ritual texts of different ori-gins. The spells in their present state testify clearly to several phases ofediting, thereby demonstrating that the ancient redactors were highlyskilful philologists and proficient in both Egyptian and Greek. Giventhis complex language situation, modern students looking for the cul-tural dynamics of the spells within this corpus must include, almost bynecessity, both the Egyptian and Greek spells in their research. How-ever, until today, such a line of research has hardly been undertaken.The dominant paradigm in the study of the manuscripts of the ThebanMagical Library is determined by a traditional disciplinary division ofthe material on ethnic and linguistic grounds. This means for exam-ple that classicists tend to focus on the Greek spells without taking theDemotic texts into account, irrespective of the fact that these occuralongside Greek spells on a single manuscript. This situation is shapedas much by the preferences and academic training of earlier scholarsas by the fact that the different manuscripts of the Theban MagicalLibrary became dispersed over Europe and were rapidly relegated tothe margins of both Egyptology and Classics. To understand more fullythe developments that led to the currently still prevailing paradigm, the27See chapter4.4.28For example, see, PGM III.633–731;IV.1–25;52–85;88–93and94–153."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"12chapter onefollowing pages will describe the fate of the Theban Magical Libraryafter its discovery and provide a sketch of the most important stages inthe study of its manuscripts.During the first half of the nineteenth century, Egyptian antiquitieswere in great demand in Europe, where newly established nation stateslike France, Prussia and the Netherlands felt a need to confirm theirindependence and grandeur by appropriating pharaonic symbolismand acquiring Egyptian monuments for their recently founded muse-ums. This development provided opportunities to make large sums ofmoney for people such as Bernadino Drovetti, Henri Salt and Gio-vanni Anastasi, who have become particularly well known for theirrather unscrupulous conduct in amassing Egyptian antiquities.29Gio-vanni Anastasi, a rich merchant from Alexandria, who served as Swed-ish-Norwegian Consul-General in Egypt from1828until his death in1857,30acquired a huge and varied collection of Egyptian antiquitiesthrough local antiquity dealers. Through his agents in Luxor, he pur-chased in the course of time a collection of occult texts currently knownas the Theban Magical Library.31Nothing is known about the archaeo-logical context of the texts,32the identity of the vendors or the circum-stances of the sales.To complicate matters further, Anastasi sold the manuscripts to dif-ferent European museums and institutions on different occasions.

Reuvens, the firstdirector of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, recognizedimmediately the importance of the Greek and Old-Coptic glosses inthe bilingual magical handbooks for the decipherment of the Demoticscript.42Most scholars, however, were not impressed by the find, sincethey regarded the texts to be the barbaric products of superstition andof a bastardised society in which not much was left of the standardsand ideals of either classical Greek or pharaonic culture. The scientificparadigm of those days defined syncretism and hybridity, racial as wellas cultural, as pollution and degeneration, with the effect that schol-ars were reluctant to include the highly syncretistic corpus into theirdiscipline.43It was only at the end of the nineteenth century that thediscipline of Classics drew fuller attention to these handbooks, initi-ated by the studies of the classicist Albrecht Dieterich.44The underlyingassumption which provoked this rise in interest, was that the hymnsand ritual procedures contained in the handbooks were relics of textsonce used by practitioners in the mystery religions of the Greek Clas-sical period. Therefore, much stress was placed on reconstructing theoriginal texts.45Consequently, the magical texts were not studied for42C.J.C. Reuvens,Lettres à M.

Leiden384verso1/15–3/22, a recipe to acquire control over a person with the help ofEros, became PGM XII.14–95. The magical handbooks of the The-ban Magical Library form the principal part of the PGM, but are notincluded in their entirety. Whereas the Old-Coptic sections are givenin full and provided with philological commentary, the Demotic spellsare consistently left out. In his introduction, Preisendanz keeps silentabout the reasons for this exclusion; in fact, he does not mention theexistence of the Demotic columns at all.47This has led to the awk-ward situation that the extensive P. London-Leiden, which contains29columns on the recto and33on the verso, mostly written in Demotic,is reduced to three pages with27lines of Greek as PGM XIV. In thesame way, the thirteen Greek columns of P. Leiden I384verso, col-lected as PGM XII, appear without the two preceding and four follow-ing Demotic spells. The PGM reference system established itself easilyas standard, with the result that the Demotic spells, which could notbe given a PGM number because they are not Greek,48disappearedwhich never appeared. They can now be found as an appendix to the second edition ofthePapyri Graecae Magicae,vol.2.46Karl Preisendanz,Papyri Graecae Magicae. Die griechischen Zauberpapyri2vols. (Leipzig1928–1931).

His complete silence on theDemotic spells suggests rather a Helleno-centric perspective on the magical papyri.48The Demotic spells were only given a PDM number with the comprehensivetranslation of the magical corpus in1986; see footnote56. Despite the fact that theintroduction of the PDM numbering system demonstrates the final acknowledgementthat the Demotic spells form part of the corpus, the system is otherwise of limited use.Bilingual spells are now given separate numbers for their Demotic and Greek parts, asfor example in the case of P.

It goes without saying that the publication of the PGMin this particular form fixed the parameters of future research on theTheban Magical Library. The exclusion of the Demotic spells logi-cally suggested or even dictated concentration on Greek cultural ele-ments. For example, the thirteen Greek columns known as PGM XIIare key texts in the study of theGreek Magical Papyriand have contin-uously been studied since Albrecht Dieterich’s pioneering dissertationon these spells, which was published in1888.49However, none of thesestudies has taken the remaining Demotic spells (PDM xii) into account.As such, it is a perfect example of the danger of a scholarly discoursebeing narrowed down to one discipline: not only does such a one-sidedapproach run the risk of obscuring the object of study, it also blindssubsequent researchers, dictates the questions to be posed and, as aconsequence, the answers to be found.50To a large extent, the general absence of the Demotic spells in thestudy of the magical papyri can also be attributed to a general lackof interest in these Demotic texts on the part of Egyptology. Reuvens’intuition that the bilingual papyri would be of great help in the deci-pherment of the Demotic script, proved to be correct. Nevertheless,the Demotic spells did not provoke an energetic debate on the magicaltechniques, mythology, religious beliefs and the poetics of the invoca-tions among early Egyptologists. As in the case of classicists, this wasprobably due to a general negative judgement on the mixing of cul-tures in the Hellenistic and Roman period.51Even in the introductionto the final publication of P.

Griffith and Herbert Thompson wrote: ‘though the subject-matter of the manuscript is not without its interest for the history ofmagic and medicine, its chief claim to publication lies in its philologicalinterest’.52A further excuse for neglecting the study of the Demoticspells must have been the apparent discrepancy in theme and aimsbetween pharaonic and Demotic magical spells. Whereas the formeris mainly apotropaeic in nature, a fair number of Demotic spells arerather aggressive and aimed at acquiring control over a person or deity.Because of this difference the Demotic spells were not considered tobe of interest for the study of pharaonic magic and easily fell into obliv-ion.53The remaining three Demotic magical handbooks were publishedat large intervals in1936,1975and1977, which demonstrates again thescant attention for this genre within Egyptology.54Janet H. Johnson,who published the Demotic spells on the Leiden manuscript contain-ing the thirteen columns of Greek (PGM XII) in1975and the LouvreDemotic magical handbook in1977, put an end to this trend and hasdone important work to bring the Demotic spells to the attention ofDemotists.5552F.

An important step in this direction is the comprehensive trans-lation of the magical papyri under the editorship of Hans Dieter Betz,which was published in1986.56A joint team of classicists translated theGreek spells, while the Egyptologist Janet H. Johnson was in chargeof the Demotic sections. Robert K. Ritner, another Egyptologist, aidedwith annotating the translated Greek and Demotic spells, giving ear-lier Egyptian parallels or explaining Egyptian religious concepts andimages that underlie the mechanics of the rituals. In this way, the edi-tion testifies to the linguistic and cultural complexity of the magicalmaterial.However, the volume still advocates in a subtle but telling way thesupremacy of the Greek spells over the Demotic sections as revealsits title ‘The Greek Magical Papyri in translation’, with the subti-tle, in a significantly smaller font, ‘Including the demotic spells’. Inrecent years, Robert K. Ritner has frequently objected to a prevalentHelleno-centric perspective by stressing the fact that, in his view, boththe Greek and Demotic spells were embedded in earlier pharaonicmagical practices and should be studied in the light of pharaonic rit-ual.57Aslightlydifferent position is taken by Christopher A. Faraone,who likewise stresses the multicultural character of the magical cor-pus, but argues for a combined study of Greek, Egyptian and Semitic56Hans Dieter Betz (ed.),The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation. Including the Demoticspells(Chicago1986).57His most fervent and lucid plea for an acknowledgement of the underlying phara-onic tradition in the Demotic and Greek magical papyri is Robert K. Ritner, ‘EgyptianMagical Practice under the Roman Empire: the Demotic Spells and their ReligiousContext’ANRWII.18.5(1995)3333–3379,esp.3358–3371. In his dissertation on Egyp-tian magical practices he treats pharaonic, Demotic and Greek magical spells on anequal footing, thereby suggesting that, in a sense, they formed part of one and the sameEgyptian ritual tradition:The Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice(SAOC54;Chicago1993). See also his rather polemic critique on the cultural hierarchies underly-ing most classicist’s studies of Greco-Roman Egypt: Ritner, ‘Implicit Models of Cross-Cultural Interaction’. Ritner’s views have been characterised as overestimating theEgyptian side of the corpus; see for some critique: Graf,Magic in the Ancient World,5;Christopher A. Faraone,Ancient Greek Love Magic(Cambridge1999)35–36; Idem, ‘TheEthnic Origins of a Roman-EraPhiltrokatadesmos(PGM IV.296–434)’, in: Marvin Meyerand Paul Mirecki (eds.),Magic and Ritual in the Ancient World(Religions in the Graeco-Roman World141;Leiden2002)319–343,322f."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"20chapter onereligion instead of sole focus on the Egyptian background.58Both per-spectives have found adherents and opponents among scholars. In cer-tain cases, arguments for identifying a particular cultural tradition ina religious image or prescribed rite have met with strong opposition,showing that the parameters of the intercultural study of the magicalpapyri have not yet been settled satisfactorily.59Nonetheless, the cul-tural and linguistic diversity of the corpus seems to be no longer amatter of debate, nor an impediment to a more comprehensive studyof the magical papyri, so that questions about the social and culturalidentity of the users of the Theban Magical Library are beginning toforcethemselvesonscholarsoftoday.60The present study is an inves-58Exemplary for his approach is the analysis of the so-called Philinna Papyrus(PGM XX) in: Christopher A.

Ritner critiqued severely Faraone’s identification of Mesopotamianinfluence in the Philinna Papyrus: Robert K. Ritner, ‘The Wives of Horus and thePhilinna papyrus (PGM XX)’, in: W. Clarysse, A. Schoors and H. Willems (eds.),Egyptian Religion. The Last Thousand Years. Fs. Quaegebeur2vols. (OLA85;Leuven1998)vol.2,1027–1041.59An illustrative case in point is the debate, taken up in several articles, betweenRitner and Faraone on the origins of the ritual techniques of a pierced magical clayfigurine of the Roman period found near Antinoopolis in a clay jar with a lead lamellainscribed in Greek. Ritner argues for a late example of an execration ritual, thetechniques of which are firmly rooted in Egyptian religious beliefs and attested sincethe third millennium BCE. Faraone, on the other hand, emphasises the use of magicalfigurines as intermediaries in destructive rituals in both Egypt and Greece, allowing amore complex history of cultural influences for the clay effigy and its accompanyingspell. See: Christopher A. Faraone, ‘Binding and Burying the Forces of Evil: TheDefensive Use of “Voodoo Dolls” in Ancient Greece’Classical Antiquity10(1991)165–205; Ritner,The Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice,112–190; Faraone, ‘TheEthnic Origins of a Roman-EraPhiltrokatadesmos’. This debate demonstrates that itis extremely difficult to trace specific cultural or ethnic origins for ritual techniques.Moreover, such an undertaking easily runs the risk of ending up in an essentialisticdebate on who was first.60That the linguistic and cultural diversity of the magical papyri is generally accept-ed nowadays is borne out by the steady stream of conference volumes on ancient magicthat appear since the middle of the nineties of the last century. These volumes includealmost as a rule articles on Egyptian, Near Eastern, Jewish and Christian aspects of thecorpus.

It takes the bilingualcharacter of the library as its starting point instead of as an acciden-tal and inconvenient phenomenon and hopes to exploit its complexlanguage situation as a means to track down the possible social andcultural contexts of the composers, compilers, editors and users of thespells.1.3.Aims and methods of the investigation: reading magicThe foregoing section has shown that:1. Any reconstruction of the Theban Magical Library must remaintentative on account of an irreparable lack of information aboutits archaeological context.2. The study of the Theban Magical Library has been hindered bya disciplinary division of the bilingual material on ethno-linguisticgrounds.3. The question about the origins of ritual techniques, religious im-ages, idiomatic expressions and text passages is far from settled.In the light of the above given three observations, the present line ofapproach can be described in the following terms. First, as the corematerial for study serve two manuscripts that form a subgroup withinthe library, both of which can be assigned with certainty to the ThebanMagical Library. In this way, problems about the exact make-up of thelibrary can be avoided. These manuscripts are P. London-Leiden (PDMxiv and PGM XIV) and P. Leiden I384verso (PGM XII and PDM xii).They can be considered a unity, not only because the Demotic hand isidentical, but also because fragments of the Leiden part of P. London-Leiden were discovered within the folded P. Leiden I384during theirfirst examination in the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden in1829and1830.61Their Theban provenance is certain since, accord-ing to sparse information provided by Anastasi, the Leiden part ofP. London-Leiden was acquired in Luxor, which agrees with the dialectof the Egyptian sections. Because both manuscripts contain substantialparts in Demotic and Greek, and make use of Demotic, hieratic, Old-Coptic and Greek script, the two manuscripts together contain all lan-61For a more detailed account of these and the following arguments, see, chapter2."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"22chapter oneguages and scripts that are represented in the complete Theban Magi-cal Library. As such, an investigation of the two manuscripts could serveas a case study, the conclusions of which might possibly hold as well fortheentirelibrary.It goes without saying that the present study does not allow for anydisciplinary division of the material: the extant manuscripts themselvesset the limits for, and give direction to, the investigation. Demotic,Greek as well as Old Coptic spells are included in the research andthe diversity of scripts will be fully taken into account. In fact, thevariation in language and script is a first indicator of the social andcultural context of production and use of the two manuscripts, sincethe Demotic and hieratic scripts were only in use among Egyptianpriests in the Roman period.62This means that the authors, editors andreaders of the manuscripts must have gone through a priestly scribaltraining and, secondly, that the two extant manuscripts must derivesomehow or other from an Egyptian temple milieu. If a native templecontext cannot be proven for the phases of storage and burial of themanuscripts, it must nonetheless hold for the phases of composition,compilation and editing of the spells.This conclusion carries important consequences for the methodol-ogy of the present investigation. Since this study is primarily about theidentity of the producers and users of the magical spells, I give pref-erence to an Egyptian reading attitude; this is to say that I attempt toreconstruct the reading experience of the Egyptian owner(s) of the twoextant manuscripts in the course of my analyses. This does not implythat I believe that the magical spells, the Greek ones in particular, wereby necessity unknown outside native priestly circles; it means that theextant versionsof the spells functioned within a native temple context andwill be studied as such. At this point it is instructive to quote StephenEmmel, who recently proposed a similar approach for the study of theNag Hammadi Library, a collection of religious texts translated fromGreek into Coptic, which was stored in a large jar and buried around400CE in the hills of Nag Hammadi.6362W.J. Tait, ‘Demotic Literature and Egyptian Society’, in: Johnson (ed.),Life in aMulti-Cultural Society,303–310.63For a general introduction to the content and discovery of this collection, see,James M. Robinson (ed.),The Nag Hammadi Library in English(3rded.; Leiden1988)1–26.Note that the Nag Hammadi Library is an intriguing parallel to the Theban MagicalLibrary, because both were buried around the same period in roughly the same region.See also Fowden,The Egyptian Hermes,170ff."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"introduction23The attraction of what I am calling a ‘Coptic reading’ of the Nag Ham-madi Codices is that the codices are our primary data, and presumablythey were read by someone—or at least they were laboriously createdfor that purpose. Hence such a ‘Coptic reading’ takes us (in theory) theshortest distance into the minefield of the texts’ complex history of trans-mission, and therefore it should provide us with more certain—albeitquite different—results than other readings. It is, in a sense, the first taskof investigation that such artefacts call for, now that the manuscripts havebeen fully conserved and the texts published.64Central to this undertaking is to reconstruct the valorisation of the dif-ferent languages, scripts and religious images on the part of a possi-ble Egyptian user. I assume that the composers and compilers of thespells made use only of those scripts,languages, divine names and tex-tual formats that they considered to be efficacious in a magical rit-ual. This implies for example that I regard variation in languages andscripts within a single spell as meant to be meaningful to the ritualand thus reflecting a particular perspective on ritual techniques and theworkings of nature. Moreover, I believe that only those marketing tech-niques, such as fictions about authors and miraculous discoveries, couldsurvive several phases of redaction that were in line with the readersand editors’ ideas about magicians and ritual power. A close reading ofthe spells along these lines will thus provide insight in the cultural andsocial identities of the producers and users of the magical spells.64Stephen Emmel, ‘Religious Tradition, Textual Transmission, and the Nag Ham-madi Codices’, in: John D.

LEIDEN I 384 AND P. LONDON-LEIDEN2.1.Two bilingual manuscripts from the Anastasi collectionThis study takes two magical handbooks of the Theban Magical Li-brary as its primary source material, namely P. Leiden384I verso andP. London-Leiden (consisting of P. BM10070and P. Leiden I383). Bothmanuscripts derive from the collection of Giovanni Anastasi, but weresold separately. The Dutch National Museum of Antiquities in Leidenacquired Anastasi’s first large collection of Egyptian antiquities includ-ing the Leiden part of P. London-Leiden1(P. Leiden I383)andthefirst half of P. Leiden I3842after several rounds of serious bargain-ing in Livorno in1828. Because Anastasi wanted to stimulate the slacknegotiations between his agents and the Dutch government, he added,at a certain moment, a Byzantine military helmet, a papyrus codexin Greek and a bilingual papyrus scroll to the collection.3However,his agents Tossizza and De Castiglione were reluctant to carry out hisorders at the moment that the negotiations entered their final stage. Itwas therefore only after the deal had been sealed, that the Dutch agentJean Emile Humbert heard about the additional three items. Afterthreatening the agents with a lawsuit Humbert acquired the antiquitiesand sent them afterwards to Leiden, where they arrived about a yearlater than the main load of the collection, which had arrived on NewYe a r ’ s D a y1829.

Reuvens found that the bilingual papyrus scroll fitted exactly tothe Demotic-Greek magical handbook that was in the first shipment: itwas the second half of P.

The manuscript entered the British Museum collection underthe number P. BM10070, but remained unnoticed for a long time.Many years later Willem Pleyte, keeper and eventually director of theNational Museum of Antiquities in Leiden (1869–1903), discovered thatthe London handbook is actually not a discrete composition, but fitsexactly to the Leiden magical handbook P.

Even ata first glance one cannot escape the impression that the manuscriptsshow a number of notable similarities. Both manuscripts are magi-cal handbooks that bring together a considerable number of magicalspells, in Demotic and Greek, of unequal length without any obviousthematic ordering. Several Demotic spells incorporate a Greek invo-cation of which one even recurs in two versions on P. Leiden I384verso and in an alternative version on P.

Leiden I383, the Leiden portion of P. London-Leiden.9His guesswas confirmed when the second half of P. Leiden I384,whicharrivedabout a year later in Leiden, happened to contain similar fragmentswithin its folds that were undoubtedly part of P. Leiden I383.Theseenfolded fragments led Reuvens to assume that the two manuscriptswere actually found together, probably383enveloped within384,buttaken apart after their discovery and sold separately to Anastasi’s agentsin Luxor.10With Pleyte’s discovery that P. Leiden I383forms withP. B M10070one large bilingual magical handbook, it has becomefurther clear that, whoever discovered the two manuscripts, they tookthe scrolls apart, tore both into halves and sold the four separate partsas discrete manuscripts on three different occasions,11with the resultthat three parts ended up in Leiden and one in London.The two manuscripts were in fact not only related at the phase ofburial, but formed already a unity at the phase of compilation and8The Old-Coptic glosses that are added above the magical names spelled inalphabetic Demotic signs were a convenient help for recitation, because the Old-Coptic script contains vowel signs unlike the Demotic script. In antiquity the glosseswere meant to ensure correct pronunciation of the powerful names, whereas, in thenineteenth century, the glosses proved to be of considerable help in establishing thecorrect values of demotic signs.9Reuvens,Lettres à M.

Reuvens uses the image of a purse to explain the possible situation of the twomanuscripts.11The successive stages of the sales could possibly be reconstructed as follows. Onthe first occasion, sometime before1828, the Leiden part of P. London-Leiden andthe first half of P. Leiden I384were sold to Anastasi’s agents. A little later, probablyin1828, the second half of P. Leiden I384was sold together with the Hermeticcodex PGM XIII. Thereupon, Anastasi added both manuscripts as supplements tothe collection that the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden bought in1828.TheLondon part of P.

A careful study of the orthography ofthe demotic and hieratic spellings reveals that the hands of P. London-Leiden and P. Leiden I384verso are identical to such an extent thatthe conclusion is warranted that the texts were written in the sameworkshop and in all likelihood even by the same scribe.12It is unclearwhether this scribe wrote the Greek sections as well, albeit highly prob-able for practical reasons.13Whatever the case was, the scribe wrotealso the Greek glosses above thevoces magicaein the Demotic spells andit is clear that he had initially difficulties in finding a suitable method totranscribe the Demotic names, which are written from right to left, inGreek script which is read in the opposite direction, from left to right.Janet H. Johnson has argued convincingly that he decided from line15of Demotic column IV* of P. Leiden I384verso onwards to write theglosses in Greek characters from left to right above the Demotic mag-ical names instead of putting the corresponding Greek letter immedi-ately above the Demotic sign as he did in the previous lines.14Sincethis method is persistently applied in the following columns and inP. London-Leiden as well, it follows that P. London-Leiden must havebeen written sometime after P. Leiden I384verso.The fact that the two manuscripts derive from the same workshopand were buried together in antiquity is highly significant in the lightof a study that is concerned with the sphere of production and useof these manuscripts. On the one hand, it justifies viewing the twomanuscripts as a subgroup within the Theban Magical Library and,on the other hand, it provides solid proof that the editors and ownersof the two manuscripts, who might be identical, considered the magicalspells to form a unity, despite the variety in language, script and style.In the phase of compilation and edition, the present spells were selectedfrom an unknown but most likely a considerable number of magicalspells available in Demotic and Greek and combined on two separate12See for a detailed analysis: Johnson, ‘The Demotic Magical Spells of LeidenJ384’,51–53, the glossary is on pages54–64.

The latter two manuscripts are unmistakably writtenin two distinct hands.13The Greek sections are less homogeneous regarding orthography than the De-motic texts.

The question to be posed is thus: whatwere the criteria of inclusion and to whom did the result of the selectionmake sense?2.3.Description of the manuscripts and their textual contents2.3.1.P. L e i d e n I384The manuscript that is nowadays catalogued in the National Museumof Antiquities in Leiden as P. Leiden I384contains on its recto sidepart of a mythological narrative in Demotic, known today as theMythof the Sun’s EyeorMythus,and,onitsverso,abilingual(DemoticandGreek) magical handbook. The manuscript measures about3,60metresin length and22centimetres in height on average. Both the rightand left side of the manuscript are broken and it is impossible to becertain about the number of columns missing on each side. WhenC.J.C. Reuvens examined the manuscript, he found six small papyrusfragments (a-f)15glued to the recto side as a means to repair smallslits and reinforce the papyrus roll.16Since these fragments were care-lessly placed over the Demotic writing of the mythological narrative,the manuscript must have been restored at a moment that the text oftheMyth of the Sun’s Eyewas no longer of importance to the owner ofthe papyrus scroll. When the fragments were removed they appearedto contain Demotic writing on both sides, one side of which pre-serves writings that once had belonged to the broken last column ofthe mythological narrative. Reuvens noticed also that the recto side ofthe manuscript showed several effaced spots in the middle of its heightcaused by fingers unrolling the papyrus scroll while reading the obverseside.17These traces of use demonstrate that the magical handbook,which is on the verso, was regularly consulted in antiquity. As a con-servation measure the manuscript was pasted between sheets ofpapiervégétal,18which, despite Reuvens’ good intentions, varnished and turnedthe papyrus dark and shiny in the course of several decades, with the15Fragment c is nowadays broken into two small pieces between lines8and9.16Reuvens,Lettres à M.

The lithogra-phy made by T.

Of thefirst column only the left end of the lines are preserved, whereas thefragments that were pasted to the papyrus for strength contain partsof column23, which was likely the final column of the composition.The text is written in black ink with the occasional use of red inkto indicate new chapters, a change of speakers in the narrative anddirections for use of the voice meant for a reader who read the textaloud in front of an audience. Occasional editorial comments regardingalternative phrases demonstrate that the extant version is a compilationfrom several older versions that are lost.22TheMyth of the Sun’s Eyeis a complex narrative, set somewhere inNubia, about a dog-ape, the animal of Thoth, who attempts to per-suade the goddess Tefnut to leave Nubia and return to Egypt.23Thegoddess turned her back on Egypt, because she was angry with herfather Re for reasons probably told in the missing opening columns.The dog-ape relates animal fables and explains proverbs in order tomake the goddess recognize that each living being has its own particu-19Conrad Leemans,Papyrus égyptien démotique I.384du Musée d’Antiquités des Pays-Bas àLeide(Leiden1856).

The plates should therefore be used withcaution.20The standard edition of the text is still Wilhelm Spiegelberg,Der ägyptische Mythusvom Sonnenauge (der Papyrus der Tierfabeln—‘Kufi’) nach dem leidener demotischen Papyrus I384(Straßburg1917) with a hand copy of the text by J.-J.

In its present state the manuscriptconsists of13consecutive columns in Greek set between two Demoticcolumns on the left side and four Demotic columns, which incorpo-rate two Greek invocations and severalvoces magicaein Greek letters, onthe right side. The verso side of the fragments that were pasted to themanuscript for reinforcement have so far been neglected in the studyof the spells. However, this negligence is unjustified, because a carefulinspection of the small and effaced fragments reveals that the Demoticwriting is identical to the Demotic hand of the magical spells.27Thefragments could hence be remnants of another column of Demoticspells (column III*) that preceded the extant Demotic column II*.Oddly enough, when the fragments are put into place in accordancewith theMyth of the Sun’s Eyeon the obverse side,28the reconstructed col-umn III* stands upside down in relation to the other magical columns.This can only be explained by assuming that the scribe of the magi-cal spells started his work with writing the Demotic column III* on thefar right end of the manuscript as is customary for Egyptian papyrusscrolls.29After finishing the column he realised that it would be difficultto fit in the many Greek spells that are read in the opposite direction.As a solution he turned the papyrus scroll180degrees and started tocopy the Greek spells in consecutive columns from left to right, even-tually filling13columns. Subsequently he added two Demotic columnson the left side and four (or more) other Demotic columns on the rightside, which, contrary to Egyptian custom, have to be read from left toright like the Greek columns. Janet H. Johnson was able to establish theconsecutive order of the Demotic columns with the help of the shift in27Line6of fragment c preserves the wordwnw.t, ‘hour’, in a spelling that occurs inP.

These lines open with the interrogative particleAn, thus continuingthe hymn to the returning goddess of the previous column22.29It is very likely that the fragments preserve the last or second last column of theMyth of the Sun’s Eye, because they contain a hymn sung to the goddess at the momentthat she returns from Nubia in Memphis where her father Pre, the sun god, awaitedher.

Several spells are headed by a title, either writtenin the middle of an empty line above the spell or directly connectedwith the first line of the recipe itself. In three cases, a title in Demoticis added to a recipe in Greek that contains a Greek title as well.32A spell to foretell by way of numerology whether a sick person willdie or recover from her or his ailment (PGM XII.351–364) is followedby a diagram with numbers, the so-called ‘Demokritos’ sphere’ (Greekcolumn11). Four times a recipe is provided with a sketchy drawing thatshould be copied in the course of a ritual: a divine figure sitting on athrone (Greek column12;fig.2.2),33a standing Seth animal holding twospears (Demotic column IV; fig.2.3),34Anubis standing at the mummy’sbier (Demotic column I, top; fig.2.4)35and a figure standing on a basket(Demotic column I, bottom; fig.2.5).36The style and iconography areunmistakably Egyptian despite their somewhat clumsy character.37The30Johnson, ‘The Demotic Magical Spells of Leiden J384’,48–50.31Since the extant manuscript is not complete, it is very well possible that othercolumns were written to the right of column I.

The columns of theverso are short and tend to cluster in small groups that are randomlydistributed along the length of the papyrus roll.

Hooiberg’s facsimile of1839and Herbert Thompson’shand copy of1921, they never attracted scholarly attention despite thefact that their function within the manuscript is far from self-evident.Their presence is remarkable, since the application of verse pointsseems to be a rather marginal phenomenon in Demotic texts,46in con-trast to their abundant appearance in hieratic texts of the pharaonicperiod.47Moreover, they are applied in the invocations, which are poet-ically structured to some degree, as well as in the rather mundane andstraightforward recipe-like prescriptions to the rituals.48It is noteworthythat they occur only on the recto and are not even consistently appliedthere.49The base language of the manuscript is Demotic, but at three occa-sions a short invocation in Greek is inserted between the Demotic linesof a recipe. In another case, a spell is said to be in Nubian and spelledin alphabetic Demotic signs. The Demotic script shows an intricatemixing with hieratic signs, while complete words or word groups inhieratic are frequently incorporated within Demotic clauses. Thevoces44These key words are ̄dd mdw.t, ‘words to recite’, orpA#ˇsnty-\"ı-\"ır--k#ˇs--f, ‘the spellthat you have to recite’, at the start of an invocation, andpAy--fsw.h-\"ıj ̄h, ‘its gathering ofthings / preparation’ at the start of a recipe.45Verse points orGliederungspunkteare dots in red ink set at regular intervals abovethe line. They are attested in Egyptian manuscripts since the12thdynasty and wereprobably used as a device to structure a text in semantic units, since they always appearat the end of a (subordinate) clause. They appear mainly in texts of a poetic nature,although not exclusively. Since a number of texts are provided with verse points in onemanuscript and lack verse points in the other, it has been suggested that verse pointswere used only by students. This is however very unlikely in the light of the avail-able evidence. The exact meaning and function of the verse points remain therefore amatter of debate.

Leiden I383was acquired in Luxor.56There is no information aboutthe provenance of P. BM10070, the London part, and of P. LeidenI384, but, since the two manuscripts were buried together, it followsautomatically that both P. London-Leiden and P. Leiden I384werefound somewhere in the Luxor region. For two reasons it is highly likelythat the manuscripts were composed in the same region as where theywere found in the19thcentury. First, the orthography and grammar ofthe Demotic spells is very similar to the hand and grammar of theso-calledDemotic Gardening Agreement, a little understood compositionwritten on the outer surface of a small jar that was foundin situin the temple of Medinet Habu.57Second, Janet H. Johnson studiedthe phonetic relationship between the Old-Coptic renderings of thevoces magicaeand their transcription in alphabetic Demotic script andconcluded that the vocalised glosses show signs of a Theban dialect(Coptic dialect P).58According to Helmut Satzinger, the language ofthe manuscript is rather an archaic Achmimic, a Coptic dialect spokenbetween Aswan and Akhmim, with Thebes as place of origin.59SincetheMyth of the Sun’s Eyeshows characteristics of a southern dialect as56Reuvens,Lettres à M.

London-Leiden of the deities Montu, Khonsuand Opet, who were particularly prominent as objects of cult in theTheban region, among the otherwise rather ‘national’ gods as Osiris,Isis, Nephthys, Anubis and Thoth612.5.DateThere are unfortunately no extra-textual or absolute dating criteriaavailable to date the two manuscripts under study. The spells do notcontain dates, names of rulers, nor references to historical events thatwould help to situate the spells and the manuscripts in a more precisehistorical context. As a consequence, one has to resort to grammar andpalaeography to establish a relative date for respectively the spells andthe manuscripts. It remains problematic to date by palaeography thephase of copying the extant spells onto the manuscript, because theGreek hands show very few distinctive criteria and the palaeographyof Demotic hands of the Roman period is still far from precise.62Thehieratic signs and words interspersed with the Demotic are neither ofhelp in establishing a date for the Egyptian hand.63P. London-Leiden60Spiegelberg,Der ägyptische Mythus vom Sonnenauge,380–382.61Montu: P. London-Leiden9/20,10/26,27/5. Khonsu: P. London-Leiden9/1;Opet:6/18,19. The ‘national’ gods occur frequently throughout the manuscript. Notealso that the god Imhotep is mentioned in a spell’s title to validate the rite’s efficacy(P. London-Leiden4/1= PDM xiv93–114[PGM XIVa.1–11]) and invoked as godof medicine (P. Leiden I384verso I*/1–29= PDM xii.21–49).

It is practically impossible to trace the development of Demotichands for Roman Thebes, because the number of sources is far too few.63The hieratic palaeography of P. London-Leiden can conveniently be studied inB.H. Stricker, ‘Het grafisch systeem van de magische papyrus Londen & Leiden’OMRO36(1955)92–132. The hieratic signs are certainly close in form to the hieratic hands ofa number of the Theban Books of Breathing, which are usually dated to the first andsecond century CE. However, Roman dates are now seriously challenged for certainof these manuscripts in favour of a Ptolemaic date; see, Jan Quaegebeur, ‘Books ofThoth Belonging to Owners of Portraits?

London-Leiden doesnot show any signs of being a palimpsest, it is conceivable that thescraps were applied when the magical handbook had already been inuse for several years. This would mean that the spells of P. London-Leiden were copied onto the papyrus roll sometime in the late secondor early third century CE. If this were correct, it follows that P.

Leiden I384verso and P. London-Leiden does certainly not exclude such an earlydating.69It is therefore justified to conclude that the manuscripts werecopied sometime after the beginning of the second century CE (Myth ofthe Sun’s Eye)andbefore250CE at the latest (papyrus fragments), in alllikelihood sometime at the turn of the second to the third century CE.7069I thank Robert W.

Parker has suggested that the text contains aterminus post quemin thephrase ‘I will give [the gold pieces; jd] to you in gold of the infamous(?) queen, “OldWom a n” ’ ( C ,5–7). This would refer to gold pieces with the head of queen Zenobia ofPalmyra, who invaded and gained control over Egypt in271CE. Parker argues thatnative Egyptians saw the queen as a conqueror and therefore called her an infamousqueen. However, it is very unlikely that the phrase refers to coins minted in the daysof Zenobia, because she never issued gold coins. In fact, the only gold coins with thehead of a queen that were minted in Egypt date to the period between Ptolemy IIand Ptolemy VI (285–145BCE). The phrase refers probably to gold coins with thehead of Arsinoe II, Arsinoe III, Berenike II or Cleopatra I, which were already oldwhen this Roman-period text was written, but far more solid than the contemporary"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"44chapter twoFig.2.11.

London-Leiden and of the six columns that precede and fol-low the thirteen Greek columns of P. Leiden I384verso. It has alreadybeen said that a detailed analysis of the orthography and palaeographyof both manuscripts has revealed that the hands resemble each otherin closest detail.2The similarity is the more conspicuous as both handsmake use of a particular and intricate mixing of Demotic and hieraticsigns throughout the manuscripts. The idiosyncratic form of mixingcertainly betrays an individual hand, so that it is warranted to assumethat both manuscripts were written by the same scribe. This mixingof hieratic and Demotic script deserves close attention as an extraordi-nary phenomenon, because Egyptian texts are usually characterised bya concern for clear generic divisions as regards content, script and lan-guage variant, the specific combination of which is mainly determinedby a text’s function.3From the end of the Ptolemaic period onwards, Demotic becamegradually accepted as a language and script suitable to write texts ofa more traditional and religious nature. Texts that would earlier havebeen written in Classical Egyptian with the hieratic script, such as ritualhandbooks, funerary spells, mortuary liturgies, hymns, scientific works,2Johnson, ‘The Demotic Magical Spells of Leiden I384’,29–64,51.3One could roughly make the following distinctions for the pharaonic period:hieroglyphs were used for carving religious or royal texts on a stone surface (tem-ple wall or stele) or for inscribing wooden or metal luxury objects for ornamenta-tion. These texts were written in Classical Egyptian. Hieratic, the cursive handwriting,was written with a brush on papyrus and initially developed for documentary pur-poses (receipts, letters, inventory lists, etc.). From the Late Period onwards, hieratic hadbecome restricted to the priestly domain as a medium for writing texts containing tradi-tional sacred knowledge (rituals, hymns, scientific works). Hieratic texts could be writtenin Classical Egyptian as well as Late Egyptian, although Classical Egyptian predomi-nated because of its sacred character. From the Late Period onwards, administrativeand legal texts were written in Demotic, a distinctive language phase and script. Notethat these generic boundaries were never rigidly fixed, so that transgressions occurred,albeit limited."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"the use of script49were now also composed in Demotic.4This development was due to ageneral decline in proficiency in hieratic among the native priesthoodwhose authority and training was gradually weakened by a decreasein, and eventual lack of, state subsidies.5Hieratic and the ClassicalEgyptian language were undoubtedly perceived by the priesthood asprestigious and well suited for priestly literature out of tradition, butdaily reality was such that the Hellenistic administration forced themincreasingly to adopt Greek at the expense of the native languagesand scripts. It is likely that Classical Egyptian fell the first victim tothis development because it had existed only as an artificial language,requiring extensive training, for about two thousand years. As Demoticwas closer to spoken language and therefore less difficult to learn, itbecame inevitably used where hieratic had previously been obligatory.In certain cases, hieratic texts were merely translated and reworked intoDemotic, but the introduction of Demotic into the religious domainalso gave a stimulating impetus for new compositions.6In the light ofthese developments, it comes as no surprise that the two scripts wereoccasionally combined.In certain manuscripts, Demotic phrases serve merely as readingaides or explanatory glosses to the main text in hieratic without inter-fering substantially with the hieratic text. The insertion of explana-tory glosses in Demotic proves that a thorough knowledge of the tra-ditional languages and scripts was no longer self-evident in Greco-Roman Egypt. In a well-preserved Roman manuscript of theBook ofthe Fayum, for example, Demotic numbers are written in the vignettes,probably intended as an aid for a scribe to facilitate copying the hiero-glyphic texts of each vignette in correct sequential order.7In one case,4For a general overview, see, Friedhelm Hoffmann,Ägypten: Kultur und Lebensweltin griechisch-römischer Zeit.

Rhind1and2,fromthereign of Augustus, interference is more substantial and of a differentkind, because the funerary text is given in hieratic on the upper halfof the column, while a parallel version is written in Demotic on thelower half.12It is difficult to discern which version is the translation ofthe other, as earlier versions of the funerary text are not known andneither the hieratic nor the Demotic version shows clearly identifiablemisunderstandings that might have come about in the process of trans-lation. The main difference between the two versions lies therefore notin an explicit hierarchy between a prestigious and a secondary redac-tion, but is solely of a grammatical and idiomatic nature. The hier-atic version, written in Classical Egyptian, contains a fair amount ofarchaic religious terminology, whereas the Demotic version conformsgrammatically and idiomatically more or less to contemporary writ-ten language.13However, the act of translation is indeed discernable inFayum.

The following pageswill deal in more detail with the particular form of mixing in the twomanuscripts under discussion.Demotic and hieratic are combined in three different ways in thetwo manuscripts.17First, hieratic signs may occur as an independentlevel, the hieratic version uses traditional religious vocabulary, whereas the Demoticversion adopts consistently a modernizing lexicon (for example, traditionalkA, ‘soul’,is rendered in Demotic byrn, ‘name’; the epithetmA#.t.y, ‘the righteous’, is givenin Demotic as.hs.y, ‘the praised one’). It is tempting to assume that the Demoticversion is a modernizing translation of an older and more traditional hieratic textthat is unfortunately preserved in a single copy. However, the hieratic version displaysinstances of demoticism and several passages in the Demotic version are structuredaccording to alliteration, which is completely lost in the hieratic parallel.

The earliest version of the cosmological treatise, known astheBook of Nut, is found on the ceiling of the burial chamber in the cenotaph of SethosI in Abydos. Abridged versions are in the tomb of Ramesses IV and Mutirdis (TT410,unfinished).15An early example of a similar Classical Egyptian-Demotic text is P. BM EA69574from the Saite or Persian period: J.F.

This meansthat a Demotic sentence incorporates a hieratic word or phrase withoutbreaking up the sentential and semantic order of the Demotic unit. Inthese cases, the hieratic elements are mainly archaic, religious terms ortraditional divine epithets. Second, a word can be made up of hieraticsigns used in combination with demotic characters to form a hybridunit. Again, in this case, the treatment is mostly limited to religiousvocabulary. Third, hieratic is occasionally used for transcribing andglossing secret magical names, the so-calledvoces magicae. Principally,thesevoces magicaeare transcribed and glossed in respectively alphabeticdemotic and Old Coptic, but, in one case, a hieratic gloss is addedabove an epithet in Demotic.The first above-mentioned type, interference of Demotic and hier-atic script on a sentential level, can be illustrated with the help of a fewexamples. Egyptian magical spells or medicinal recipes are frequentlyaccompanied by the standard closing phrasenfr.wy pw‘it is very good’,which was added to spells as some sort of proof of efficacy or adver-tisement from as early as the Middle Kingdom.18In P. London-Leiden,the phrase occurs occasionally likewise as an addition to a recipe. Inthe majority of these cases, the clause is markedly written in hieraticin spite of the fact that the foregoing recipe is otherwise in Demotic.19For example, a spell to make a woman desire a man closes with thefollowing prescription:(Recite it) seven times. You must do it on the fourteenth (day) of the lunarmonth. (It is)very good![P.London-Leiden25/37]P. London-Leiden, see, B.H.

The poetic structure of these invocations conforms to thegeneric rules of traditional Egyptian hymns: each verse line consists ofa divine name accompanied by a description of a deity’s cultic topog-raphy or attributes.20It occurs frequently that a verse line is made upof a mixture of clauses in hieratic and Demotic script with the tradi-tional and age-old epithets usually rendered in hieratic.

The title of this collection of hymns is writtenin a mixture of hieratic and Demotic: ‘AdoringRe in the morningathisrising’ (P. London-Leiden6/3). The title itself is not known fromother late sources but resembles titles of ritual books that were keptin the House-of-Life, the cultic temple library.28Since the combination‘adoring Re’ (dwAR#) served also as a generic technical term for sunhymns,29it is very well possible that the present title refers to, or waseven extracted from, a once existing compilation of sun hymns thatwas generally known in priestly circles. The distribution of hieratic andDemotic words in the title seems to be random and not governed byany hierarchical order between the two scripts. The following exampleis taken form the same recipe and confirms that the mixing of hieraticand Demotic script was not strictly determined by hierarchical consid-erations of any kind. The short passage contains two phrases that arecoordinated in aparallelismus membrorum, the first member of which iswritten in Demotic and the second in hieratic.EHailOsiris (and) the lamp; it will let (me) seethose thingsthat areabove,30°it will let (me) see those things that are below (and vice versa).°[P.

It might thereforebe more appropriate to speak of interference rather than mixing ofscripts. In the majority of cases, these words are somewhat archaic andreligious in nature, the use of which was restricted to ritual texts, hymns,spells, etc. The intricate mixing of hieratic and Demotic was thereforeprobably the result of an in-depth familiarity with religious texts inhieratic on the part of the ancient copyist. It goes without saying that itpresupposes an equal familiarity with hieratic on the part of the reader.A selection of the hybrid words is listed below in transliteration andtranslation; the numbers refer to the Demotic glossary of P.

The reason for this particular use of hieraticremains unclear, because, unlike Old-Coptic glosses abovevoces magicae,a gloss in hieratic does not convey any additional information about acorrect pronunciation, as hieratic is even less equipped for conveyingvowels than Demotic.

A similar rea-soning may hold true for thevoces magicaeand gloss in the hieratic script:they were taken from an older manuscript and ‘pasted’ into the extantspell without being transcribed or translated into Demotic. This argu-ment might find substantial support in the peculiar scriptural form ofthe standard closing phrase ‘This is my correctname’ in line7, wherewiththe practitioner confirms his identification with the foregoing divinenames and epithets. Except for this sole example, which is almost com-pletely written in hieratic, the clause is always given in Demotic inP. London-Leiden. It seems that no other line of reasoning than a slav-ish copying from an older hieratic manuscript can explain this irregularwriting.The relationship between, and the status of, the transcriptions inalphabetic Demotic, hieratic and Old-Coptic script can be studied inmore detail by comparing two parallel versions of an invocation to thesun god, one version of which contains glosses in hieratic instead ofin Old-Coptic that are added abovevoces magicaespelled in alphabeticDemotic signs.

However, from line13onwards, the bark ofRe is no longer mentioned, whereas the ritual suddenly requires a youth to serve asmedium.

Theiroccurrence remains therefore somewhat obscure.A possible solution to this problem might be found in a tendencyon the part of the ancient editors to be complete and to do justice totheir various sources. Whenever they found an alternative writing, theywere inclined to add it to their text irrespective of the fact whetherit truly carried any additional information. In the case of the hieraticscript, one could quite well understand that the ancient editors imbuedalternative writings with a feeling of preserved tradition and estab-lished priestly knowledge, because the hieratic script had more or lessbeen reserved for religious compositions since the Late Period, whenDemotic was introduced as the new language and script for adminis-trative documents. To these editors the hieratic script was simply moreprestigious than Demotic, because it was older and had more affinitywith religious language. Consequently, they were eager to include themagical names and glosses in hieratic. In the light of the age of the hier-atic script, it seems reasonable to argue that glosses in hieratic script areliable to preserve the original orthography of the garbledvoces magicae,from which the Demotic and Old-Coptic variants deviated as the resultof misunderstood transcriptions. This is however not the case as faras the extant hieratic glosses are concerned. For example, neither thehieratic nor the alphabetic Demotic version of thevoces magicaeanepo,miri-po-reandthibaï-odisplay any sign of understanding of the actualmeaning and etymology of the divine names or epithets. The first vox,anepo, derives etymologically in all probability from\"Inpw#A‘the greatAnubis’, but its original notation has not been preserved in the alpha-betic Demotic nor the hieratic transcription. Both versions are nothingbut a purely phonetic transcription of thevox magicawithout consider-ation for the correct orthography of the old divine epithet.37There isno question that whoever wrote the alphabetic Demotic and hieraticspelling did not understand the correct meaning of the word group.The same reasoning holds true for the secondvox magica,miri-po-re,although a sound etymology cannot be given that easily. The partpo-reis in both versions written aspA#AR#, which could be translated as‘the greatness of Re’ or ‘the Great One, Re’, but the first part,miri,escapes interpretation.38The thirdvox magica,thibaï-o,mightbetrayan37Although thevox magicaanepois not attested in the PGM,\u001cΑν\u0010υ\u001dιςoccursoccasionally.38The hieratic gloss could possibly be interpreted as the imperativem\"ı,‘come’,"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"62chapter threeEgyptian phrase in its transcribed guise.

Nonetheless, it could derive from the verbthjthat hasamong its meanings ‘to attack an enemy’.39Thevox magicacould thententatively be translated as ‘The one who attacks the great soul’ or‘The great attacker of the soul’, although neither of both suggestions isknown as an epithet from other Egyptian sources. To summarize theevidence presented by this analyse, the Demotic and hieratic version ofthevoces magicaeare not complementary40and represent but attemptsto vocalise magical names, the meaning of which was no longer under-stood.Despite the traditional and religious character of the hieratic script, itseems warranted to suppose that there was no overt sacred hierarchy atwork in the choice for a gloss in hieratic or Demotic script.

To ensure correct pronunciation of the former group, thehieratic clause is provided with an Old-Coptic gloss, which reads:piat-iate. The variety in writings shows that Demotic and hieratic couldmutually be interchanged, which means that the choice between thetwo scripts was not strictly regulated or determined by a religious sanc-tion. The Old-Coptic gloss indicates again that the essential aspect ofthe epithet was considered its sound, not its orthography.followed byrwy, ‘lion’ (with cow’s skin determinative).

Considering the fact that Egyptian the-ology linked the Egyptian language and scripts innately with Egyptianmythology and, as a consequence, with traditional temple cult, it ishighly remarkable that Greek script, which lacks the tradition and char-acteristics of Egyptian scripts, is taken up in an Egyptian ritual manual.In the light of the political and social realities of those days, the occur-rence of the Greek script and language in Egyptian documents is notsurprising, but nonetheless, it cannot have been self-evident that thecommon language and script of civil life entered the ritual domain,which functioned otherwise rather independent from daily reality. Thefollowing pages will therefore investigate the role of Greek script andsounds in the ritual texts of the manuscript.3.3.1.Greek script and languageThe Greek script appears as a matter of course first and foremost inthe spells that are written in the Greek language: the thirteen columnsin Greek of P.

Leiden I384verso make full use ofabbreviations and stenographic symbols, which reveals that both editorand reader were familiar with the Greek scribal practices of the dayand that their command of the Greek language and script was fargreater than a working knowledge. The columns1to5on the versoof P. London-Leiden preserve short lists of plant and mineral names,which are given in their Greek and Egyptian form, thereby makingthese lists overtly bilingual by juxtaposing the Greek and Demoticscript.

These vowels,aehi \" ouw, were considered powerful entitiesin the Hellenic world since the classical period and acquired great rev-erence in late antiquity.43From the archaic period, the Greek alphabetnot only served as a medium to assign phonetic values, but was alsoa numerical system whose total number of24letters the Pythagore-ans connected with the24sounds of the lute for musical notation. Thecorrelation between letters, numbers and music notes was believed notto be accidental and soon led to philosophical speculations among theearly Orphics and Pythagoreans. Greatest weight was laid upon theseven vowels whose relationship with the seventeen consonants wasdescribed in terms of soul and body.44With the advent of astrologyin the Hellenistic period, the seven vowels were regarded as the cos-mic sounds of the seven planets within the harmony of spheres, so thatthe vowels became bound up within the course of cosmic events.

Broughtto court he was sentenced to die by the sword after being tortured.[Ammianus Marcellinus,Res Gestae,29,2.28]In line with the Greco-Roman discourse on the acclaimed sacred char-acter of the Egyptian priesthood, Egyptian priests were believed tohymn the seven vowels during their sacred rituals conducted in thenative temple.In Egypt the priests, when singing hymns in praise of the gods, employthe seven vowels, which they utter in due succession; and the sound ofthese letters is so euphonious that men listen to it in preference to fluteand lyre.[Ps. Demetrius,On Style,71]45These seven vowels occur frequently in theGreek Magical Papyriassounds that would allow the practitioner of a given ritual to compel thedivine and to manipulate the workings of the cosmos.46The connectionbetween the vowels and planetary spheres is occasionally even madeexplicit:You (Agathos Daemon) are the ocean, the begetter of good things andfeeder of the civilised world.

Written in this way, a vowel starts acting as avox magicain itself, having lost its primary phonetic bond.58Since the mechanismof the seven vowels can only be understood and become meaningfulfrom the perspective of Greek phonetics, their presence in the Demoticspells is a testimony of the transference of culturally bound knowledgeof one culture group to another. Undoubtedly, the Greek vowels hadalready become independent magical sounds in themselves by the timethey were taken up in the Demotic manuals. They might never havehad a phonetic function for Egyptian priests, but were seen, nonethe-less, as extremely powerful.A similar development could be sketched with respect to the functionand transcription of palindromes in the magical papyri.

AlphabeticDemotic is a more or less artificial script that had been invented torender foreign words and personal names in Demotic.66The ‘alphabet’consists of one-consonantal Demotic signs wherewith, to some extent,foreign words can be spelled out according to their factual pronuncia-tion. On the other hand, Old-Coptic is an experimental and prelimi-nary phase of the Coptic script, which only acquired wide usage anda more or less fixed alphabet from the second quarter of the fourthcentury CE onwards.67The Old-Coptic script comprises the Greekalphabet and a small, albeit variable, number of additional Demoticone-consonantal signs to represent sounds that are alien to Greek pho-netics.68It arose from the desire to overcome the ever-growing discrep-ancies between factual pronunciation and the fixed orthography of thehieratic and Demotic script. The Old-Coptic texts that are known todate are primarily ritual in nature, possibly because the efficacy ofa ritual was believed to rely on correct pronunciation of the magicalnames.69The Old-Coptic script that is used in the manuscripts under studyconsists of the Greek alphabet and twelve additional alphabetic Demot-66See also section4.3on the occurrence of Greek loan words in the Demotic spells.67Bagnall,Egypt in Late Antiquity,256.

These additional characters do not yet appear in the Demoticspells of P. Leiden I384verso, possibly, as suggested in chapter2.3.1,because the scribe had not yet found a suitable method for glossingthevoces magicaewhen he wrote the manuscript. The script is occasion-ally used to gloss common Egyptian words such as religious vocabulary,prepositions and verbs,70but occurs mainly to write out the sounds ofvoces magicae, of which there are more than700in the two manuscripts.In those cases, the magical name is usually given in an alphabeticDemotic version with, above the line, the Old-Coptic rendering. Thesecombined transcriptions allow investigating in more detail the complexprocess of adopting and incorporating thevoces magicaein the Demoticspells. A substantial amount of these magical names derives definitelyfrom age-old Egyptian epithets, but their alphabetic Demotic and Old-Coptic transcription hides or even distorts their etymology. These dis-tortions can only be explained as resulting from the consultation ofmanuscripts in Greek script, in which the Egyptian phonetics of magi-cal names had been distorted by necessity, as the Greek script lacks themeans to represent adequately Egyptian sounds. This means that theeditor of the extant alphabetic Demotic and Old-Copticvoces magicaedid not recognize the Egyptian origin of a considerable number of mag-ical names he found in the manuscript in Greek script and, instead ofre-transcribing them in agreement with the rules of hieratic or Demoticorthography, spelled them out in alphabetic Demotic and Old-Copticsigns, thereby mangling the Egyptian sounds for the second time.

Althoughrendered in Greek script, it is actually a transcription of the name ofthe Egyptian god Ptah, written in Egyptian asPt.h.75The two magicalnames had therefore originally the meaning ‘Ptah’ and ‘Soul of Ptah’(baptha). Although the extant writings of the names still bear the tracesof their etymology, the ancient editor did not follow Egyptian orthog-raphy, but gave preference to an alphabetic Demotic, distorted spelling,in all likelihood because hisVo rl a g edid not have these magical names ina hieratic or Demotic writing, but in a Greek transcription.

It is therefore remarkable that the name is notspelled in alphabetic Demotic signs as customary with foreign names,but written in the highly traditional hieratic script. Moreover, instead ofsolely using one-consonantal signs, the Egyptian copyist chose to ren-der the first sound of the firstsaxgroup according to the principle ofacrophony.87This is to say that a particular sound is expressed by meansof a common Egyptian word, of which only the first consonant has pho-netic relevance.

Thecurrent chapter has thus amply demonstrated that a sole focus on theEgyptian temple cannot be appropriate for a study of the sphere ofproduction and use of the two manuscripts under study.3.4.Considering secrecyA peculiar phenomenon of P. London-Leiden is the occurrence of fourdifferent scripts that are encrypted. The verso side preserves two setsof an encrypted Greek alphabet written inside a rectangular framein black ink. The first set has the corresponding Greek letter writ-ten above each enigmatic sign, while the other lists24signs in total,which equals the number of letters of the Greek alphabet (see figure2.6). Strangely enough, neither script is used in any of the Demoticspells on the manuscript or in any other magical spell in Demotic,Greek or Coptic known to date. The third set of encrypted signs thatoccurs on the manuscript is well known from contemporaneous magi-cal spells, amulets and lamellae, on which similar signs serve as a pow-erful ‘sacred’ writing that was believed to enable communication withthe divine by virtue of its symbolic and mystical qualities. The signswere very popular in the eastern Mediterranean basin at large from thesecond century CE onwards and are known today ascharaktêres.Dif-ferently, the fourth encrypted script seems to have been much morerestricted in use as regards geographical range and attestations in mag-ical material of that period.

Leiden I384verso and once in P. Louvre E3229, a similar Demotic magical hand-book from Thebes. Thanks to three parallel un-coded passages, Egyp-tologists have been able to decipher the script, which appeared to besome sort of encoded Old-Coptic alphabet. There can be no questionthat only a person who knew the correct key for decipherment couldread words written in this idiosyncratic script, so that Egyptologistshave coined the script merely ‘cipher’. However, this term should beused with due caution, because it implies the idea of concealment, ofpurposely hiding information for others, wherewith Egyptologists mayvery well misrepresent the nature and function of this script. Since thisstudy is concerned with the social context of the manuscripts, the rela-tionship between script and secrecy has to be addressed in close detail.It is of paramount importance to analyse whether scripts are usedto hide information from others, because secrecy is socially highly pro-ductive.95A secret involves as a rule two or more persons who shareand guard their knowledge trying to prevent their secret from beingrevealed to a third party.96As such, secrecy constitutes a complex socialarena in which the members of the concealing party are characterisedby a tension between the social obligation to conceal information andthe desire to reveal it in order to gain social prestige for oneself. Theother contesting party is defined precisely by its willingness to find outwhat the secret is. A defending in-group is thus defined as opposed toa desiring out-group based on the selective availability of knowledge.Given the desire of the dominant Greco-Roman culture to share inthe secret knowledge and divine revelations of the Egyptian priesthood,such a sociological model of concealment might be a useful heuristictool for situating the encrypted scripts in their textual and social con-text. Before doing this, a basic question is then: are these scripts indeedinvented to hide information and, first, was secrecy an important char-acteristic of Egyptian religion?95These ideas are based on a critique of Simmel’s sociological model of conceal-ment: Birgitta Nedelmann, ‘Geheimhaltung, Verheimlichung, Geheimnis—Einige sozi-ologische Vorüberlegungen’, in: Hans G. Kippenberg and Guy G. Stroumsa,Secrecy andConcealment. Studies in the History of Mediterranean and Near Eastern Religions(Leiden1995)1–16.96This chapter is only concerned with so called relative secrecy. Absolute secrecy isdefined as a secret that a person keeps to himself. It goes without saying that absolutesecrecy is socially unproductive."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"82chapter threeThe latter question can be answered easily and firmly in positiveterms. Secrecy was an important and recurring element of Egyptiantheology and cultic practices.97In the ideology of the daily ritual, theofficiating priest takes on the role of a god to participate in the thusenacted cosmic drama of the battle between chaos and order. His pro-motion to the rank of a deity is dependent upon his knowledge ofthe nature of the divine world. He should know the hidden names,attributes, and cultic topography of each specific god.98Cultic hymnsregularly stress that this knowledge is not to be exposed to any otherthan the king or the priest who acts according to the king’s culticfunction. A ritual text for the conservation of life explicitly and fre-quently warns the reader of the manuscript never to reveal its con-tents on penalty of death, which is directly stated in the opening para-graph.\u0002Ritual of\u0003‘Finishing the Work’ [...] it is not seen; it is not known. Lifeis in it; death is in it. You will keep yourself distant from it. Do not knowit. Do not hear it, because it is one that turns into ashes, because it is aflame, because it is a quick death. Life is in it; death is in it for sure.[P. Salt1/1–2]99The book ‘Finishing the Work’ is conducted on that day. It is a secretbook roll, which overturns magical charms, which binds binding-spells,which blocks binding-spells, which intimidates the whole universe. Life isin it; death is in it. Do not reveal it, because he who reveals it will die bya sudden death or by an immediate killing. You must be distant from it.Life is in it; death is in it.[P. Salt5/10–6/3]100Such secret cultic texts were kept in the House-of-Life or, in the caseof the Books of the Netherworld,101laid out on the walls of the hid-den and closed-offtombs of the New Kingdom pharaohs. Since secrecywas considered a precondition of cosmic order, these texts had to be97Jan Assmann, ‘Unio Liturgica.

Salt7/1) and Asiatics are not allowed to enter the roomwhere the ritual is conducted (P.

Differently, hymns, prayers andrepresentations are often characterised by a concern for overt propa-ganda.103For example, hymns to the sun god were engraved on stelesthat were placed on clearly visible spots to be read by passers-by. Thesame holds true for statues and steles that were erected by private indi-viduals in the forecourts of the temple.Apart from a religious sanction, priestly secrecy can also be moti-vated by a concern to defend group interests, as in the case of priestlytechnical knowledge. For example, a rather enigmatic Old Kingdomtitle suggests that medicine was considered a secret art, at least duringthat early period,104while the large medical Ebers Papyrus, dating fromthe New Kingdom, contains a section entitled ‘Beginnings of the secret(writings) of the physician’ [P. Ebers854]. One precept of this sectionmakes clear that secrecy was not so much encouraged by a concernto protect untrained laymen from making failures, but motivated by adesire to protect professional knowledge and preserve group interests.Then you make for him medicines that are to be kept secret fromunderlings of the physician except for your own heir.[P. Ebers206b]105It is important to stress that these texts of secret priestly knowledgewere not encoded by means of an encrypted script: they were writtenin Classical Egyptian in the hieratic script. Nonetheless, the idea ofcoded script was existent and put to use in religious texts. For example,theEnigmatic Book of the Netherworldmakes use of a cryptographic scriptfor, so it seems, hiding information, or at least, giving the impressionof secrecy.106The fanciful representations of demons, which are linedup in rows, are accompanied by their name and an explanatory notewritten in enigmatic hieroglyphs:102Admonitions,6/6–7and Urk.

Therefore, cryptographyshould not be considered a strategy to hide and monopolize the accessto information, but rather as a method to attract attention by way ofan unfamiliar appearance. Cryptographic texts were usually displayedat an eye-catching spot with free access, while the reading of the enig-matic signs was more often than not facilitated by the presence of ordi-nary hieroglyphs or by a parallel text recorded in regular script.114Thissame concern for attention lies at the heart of the playful crosswordtexts from the late New Kingdom and Third Intermediate Period thatare made up of a grid of squares, each of which is filled with a word,part of a word, or a phrase.115Their particular layout enables the readerto construct several different texts according to a horizontal or verti-cal combination of squares. The appearance of these documents mightseem enigmatic at first sight, whether in the form of their layout or theuse of cryptography, but has actually nothing to do with secrecy; on thecontrary, they are begging for attention. The concern for attention isactually already apparent from their contents: for the main part, thesetexts are hymns to gods displaying an individual’s piety to the outerworld, while, in other cases, they are lists of pharaonic epithets or pri-vate titles.112Op. cit.andtombofKhetyinBeniHassanII,nr.17,see58–59, plate14.Seeforthe restored hieroglyph of a love making couple on a bed: Lise Manniche,Sexual Lifein Ancient Egypt(London and New York1987)35,fig.21.E.Drioton,‘Unefigurationcryptographique sur une stèle du Moyen Empire’Rev.d’Egyptologie1(1933)203–229.113Drioton, ‘Essai sur la cryptographie privée’ and idem, ‘Recueil de cryptographiemonumentale’ASAE40(1940)305–427.114Consider text passages nrs.1–3given in Drioton, ‘Recueil de cryptographiemonumentale’.115J.J.

A characteristic of these temple buildingsis the overwhelming amount of hieroglyphic texts and ritual scenesinscribed on the inner and outer walls, lintels and ceilings, as if thearchitects were driven by a sense ofhorror vacui. The temple textswere composed in the Classical Egyptian language as was customaryfor religious texts, but were written in a script, currently known as‘Ptolemaic’, that exploits the phonetic and semantic possibilities ofhieroglyphic signs to the extreme.116The script should not be termedcryptography, but nonetheless, it shares the indulgence in the rulesof acrophony and rebus with cryptographic texts of the pharaonicperiod.117In all likelihood, the Egyptian priests did not invent this scriptof over more than7000hieroglyphic signs to protect their religious textsagainst possible foreign intruders, but used it as a means to multiplythe meanings of a text by mixing the linguistic and iconic level. It istherefore best seen as an intellectual game, the rules of which werepursued persistently and seriously in order to improve upon the ways ofexpression and to develop an all-encompassing religious language.The phenomenon of writing texts with some sort of encrypted scriptis also attested for Greek and Coptic texts of the Roman and lateantique period.118As is the case for pharaonic cryptography, two meth-ods were employed: either ordinary Greek or Coptic alphabetic letterswere substituted for fantasy signs or the letters of the alphabet wereascribed a different phonetic value following a strictly defined rule.The occurrence of these enigmatic scripts is limited to magical, med-ical, astrological and Gnostic manuscripts and graffiti.

In fact, cryptographic texts occur in the native temples of the Ptole-maic and Roman period, in particular in the temple of Esna; see Serge Sauneron,EsnaI—Quatre Campagnes à Esna(Cairo1959)51–52and Idem,Esna VIII,47–110.118Jean Doresse, ‘Cryptographie copte et cryptographie grecque’Bulletin de l’Institutd’Egypte33(1952)115–129; Idem, ‘Cryptography’The Coptic Encyclopedia8(1991)65a–69a; Frederik Wisse, ‘Language Mysticism in the Nag Hammadi Texts and in EarlyCoptic Monasticism I: Cryptography’Enchoria9(1979)101–120.OftheGreek MagicalPapyri, the spells PGM LVII and LXXII are written in a cryptographic script."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"the use of script87the manuscripts, the use of cryptography may have been motivated bya desire to conceal knowledge that a non-initiated was forbidden toknow: a familiar element of the late antique discourse on divine revela-tions.

Since Egyp-tian and Greek cryptographic scripts were not necessarily put to use asa means to delude non-initiated readers, the following section has tostudy in detail whether the function of the ‘cipher’ script in P. London-Leiden was truly to encode information. It may as well represent anintellectualplayonscripts,inasimilarveinasinthemajorityofpharaonic cryptographic texts.3.4.1.‘Cipher’ scriptThe so-called ‘cipher’ script of P. London-Leiden is an idiosyncraticalphabet of36signs, which is used93times to spell single words inthe recipe part of a number of Demotic spells. The ‘cipher’ scriptbehaves like the Greek and Coptic script, that is to say, it is writtenfrom left to right and, unlike the standard pharaonic scripts, includesvowel signs and does not make use of determinatives. In a few cases,the encoded words are arranged as a list of ingredients with their mea-sures or weights, but in the majority of instances, the encrypted wordsare embedded in a running Demotic sentence. Since these words neveroccur in invocations, but are always concerned with the practical pro-cedures of a given rite, their rationale was in all probability not a matterof theology but simply of selection of readership, that is to say, a meansto control and limit the access to information about a rite’s guidelines.Those who were not instructed in the code could not partake in thetechnical knowledge contained in the practical instructions of a num-ber of spells of P. London-Leiden.In total,74different words are spelled in ‘cipher’, which set com-prises10Greek nouns,11Egyptian verbal forms and53Egyptian nouns(see appendix3.2). A small number of the encoded Egyptian wordsrecur in sometimes slightly varying spellings, which suggests that thescript was far from conventionalised. The variance in spellings of thesame word resulted from the fact that the alphabet allows in a few cases"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"88chapter threea phonetic value being represented by alternative ‘cipher’ letters. Con-versely, certain letters can denote two different phonetic values withoutany clear-cut rule. The36‘cipher’ letters denote27phonetic values,6of which are distinctive Egyptian sounds that are represented by a stan-dard corresponding Old-Coptic sign each (see appendix3.1: xxxii-xxxvand xxix-xxxvi). This means that the ‘cipher’ alphabet is in fact anencrypted Greek alphabet enhanced with six standard and unalteredOld-Coptic letters to render sounds that are lacking in Greek phonet-ics. Of this original encrypted Greek alphabet,5signs are merely com-mon Greek letters turned on the side or put upside down (ix, x, xii, xiii,xix), while5other characters derive from Demotic signs (xi, xv, xxv,xxvi, xxvii). Four of its signs (i, x, xxiii, xxxi) agree in shape and pho-netic value with four signs that are listed in the second encrypted Greekalphabet on the verso side of the manuscript. It is therefore reasonableto assume that the extant Old-Coptic ‘cipher’ alphabet is an upgradedversion of a similar Greek encrypted alphabet.It remains unclearwhodesigned the ‘cipher’ script as a tool againstthe curiosity ofwhichlinguistic or social group. According to Griffithand Thompson, probably a Greek invented the script, because:1191. The Old-Coptic letters would only offer concealment in a text inGreek.2. Three signs occur only in Greek words, possibly because theyconvey sounds that only a Greek could distinguish.3. The sign for the aspirate is missing. As is known from Coptic texts,an Egyptian scribe would render this sound with the Coptic signx.4. The soundstandjare not differentiated. Any native speaker ofEgyptian would have distinguished these sounds.A close inspection of the script and the manuscript reveals that thearguments are valid, but cannot account for all complexities of theencrypted script of P. London-Leiden. First of all, one has to acknowl-edge that the majority of encrypted words are Egyptian and not Greekand that the extant ‘cipher’ script must have been applied to deludethose readers who were able to read Demotic but were not allowedto get acquainted with the specific instructions for certain drugs andpotions. Since Greeks were not competent in the Demotic script any-how, the editors of the extant manuscript cannot have regarded this119Griffith and Thompson,The Demotic Magical Papyus of London and Leiden,vol.3,108."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"the use of script89ethnic and linguistic group as the target of the security measures. Ifthey had left the words in Demotic script, no Greek would ever havehad access to the content of the spells. With respect to the first argu-ment, as the Old-Coptic letters occur only in Egyptian words, it is hardto imagine that these signs would ever occur in an encrypted text inGreek. There is actually more reason to assume that these Old-Copticsigns were added to the ‘cipher’ alphabet not until an editor adoptedthe alphabet to spell Egyptian words in code as well. As he would havedone in the case of modifying a regular Greek alphabet into an Old-Coptic alphabet, he added the exact same Demotic signs to the Greek‘cipher’ alphabet to turn it into an Old-Coptic ‘cipher’ alphabet. It istrue that the additional signs would offer no concealment to readers ofDemotic, but possibly the editor did not aim exclusively for secrecy.By distinguishing two separate stages in the creation of the extant‘cipher’ script, the second and third argument can be explained asremnants of the first stage. These Greek words were copied out of atext in Greek ‘cipher’ script without any consideration for their newEgyptian textual environment.

London-Leiden24/6–14]The ingredients are not embedded in a running Demotic sentence asis usual, but written in ‘cipher’ and listed one above the other so as toform a separate text unit within the Demotic spell. The awkward layoutsuggests that the ‘cipher’ passage was slavishly taken over as one chunkout of an encoded text in Greek and pasted into the otherwise Demotictext without being translated or transcribed. This view is supported bythe fact that the ingredients retained the genitive case endings in eachbut one instance, while the weight measure with its number are Greekand the third ingredient does not have a sign for the aspirate.120Writtenin this fashion, the text unit is an incongruity within the Demotic spellas regards its layout, scriptural appearance and linguistic form. How-ever, the Egyptian editor knew how to incorporate Greek loan wordsinto a Demotic text as is shown by a parallel spell only three linesfarther, which prescribes mandrake root and ivy as well.

In other words, thescript was initially not invented to serve as an encoding tool for texts inEgyptian such as the manuscript under study.With respect to the fourth argument, it is indeed noteworthy that onesign, which is actually the Demotic sign for the sound ̄d, stands for bothtandjin the extant ‘cipher’ alphabet. Strangely enough, there seemsto be no strict rule that defines the distribution of the letter and itssounds within a word. This random correspondence between letter andsounds may have been the result of the fact that the script was originallydesigned to encrypt Greek words only. The Demotic ̄dsign was thenused to encrypt the T- sound in Greek words, because, to Greek ears,the ̄d-and T- sound were similar. When the script was adopted forspelling Egyptian words as well, an Egyptian editor maintained the ruleof the ‘cipher’ script, but used the sign also to spell the sound ̄das hewas used to when writing Demotic or Old-Coptic.It remains a thorny issue to define in precise terms the function of the‘cipher’ script within the extant manuscript. In fact, the exact purposeof the script escapes interpretation, because it is not applied consistentlythroughout the manuscript. First, the majority of spells are writtenentirely in Demotic and do not contain any word in ‘cipher’. Secondly,certain passages with ‘cipher’ script have a parallel written without‘cipher’ in the manuscript, which would have allowed an ancient readerto break the code quite easily.123Finally, even on the level of singlespells with ‘cipher’ words, there seems to be no consistent effort to hide122It is therefore highly unlikely that the encoded word *keuor*(P.London-Leiden24/14) is a misspelling of the Greekκ\tρυα,‘kernels’;cf.Griffith and Thompson,TheDemotic Magical Papyus of London and Leiden,vol.3,103and110. The word is written withthe ‘cipher’ K- letter that is reserved for Egyptian words.123William N. Groffand Herbert Thompson used these passages to decipher the‘cipher’ script: William N.

Nonetheless, certain rules ofuse can be discovered in spite of the apparent inconsistencies. As hasalready been said, encoded words occur only in those parts of a spellthat are concerned with the practical procedures of the rite. In fact, themain bulk of ‘cipher’ words are ingredients like plants or animals forpotions or drugs of a medicinal nature. In16cases, the script is used toencrypt the Egyptian verb that indicates the outcome of the rite.124It isremarkable that the meaning of these6verbshasnothingtodowithrecovery, but on the contrary, with deterioration of a person’s physicalcondition:libe‘to rave, be mad’ (V32/1,9)mou‘to die’ (13/13,20,22,23;23/7;24/30;V32/10)mkax‘to suffer from pain’ (24/5)šefe‘to swell/ have a skin-disease’ (13/13)jour‘to be violent’ (13/25[twice])qwnm‘to be blind’ (13/12,26;24/31)These verbs might suggest that the use of the script was reserved forspells that deal with the dark side of magic, but encrypted nouns occuras much in destructive as in productive and protective spells. The sub-ject matter of the spells with encrypted nouns is actually quite diverse:making eye-ointments for divination, producing erotica, medical treat-ment, sending evil sleep, making blind and killing a person.The following two passages are parallel prescriptions for making aneye-ointment, which the practitioner should apply to his eyes whenconducting a divination ritual. The first passage has three nouns spelledin cipher, whereas the second excerpt writes them in Demotic.125Formula: blood of a *Nile goose*, blood of a *hoopoe*, blood of a*n[ightjar*], ‘Live-thereby’plant,[‘Bread-of-heaven’ plant (=mustard?126)],‘Great-of-Amun’ plant,.ks-#n ̆hstone, genuine lapis lazuli, myrrh, ‘The-footprint-of-Isis’ plant.

Althoughthe passages are separated from each other by15columns, this cannotbe called a case of absolute secrecy on any account. With respect tothe encoded ingredients of this recipe, it is noteworthy that not thesubstance itself but only the species’ name is written in the ‘cipher’script, a method that is characteristic of most encrypted ingredients. Inthose cases, the substance tends to be somewhat gory and repulsive,blood (snf), gall (s ̆hy) and dung (hs), as if the use of ‘cipher’ scriptwas motivated by the phenomenon of the so-calledDreck-Apotheke.129However, if this would be the case, the rule has again not consistentlybeen applied in the manuscript under study. The following passagefrom a love spell demonstrates that these inconsistencies even appearon the level of single spells.

The inconsistencies might be explained as resultingfrom the fact that the ‘cipher’ system was initially not invented forspells in Demotic. This means that a number of existing Demotic spellsunderwent a treatment of encoding not until an editor decided to adoptand modify the Greek ‘cipher’ script that he had found in a magicaltext in Greek. Given the tendency to be inclusive and to do justiceto all available sources, the original Demotic spells were retained andfound their way into the extant manuscript next to their encoded andsecondary parallels.3.4.2.Mystery signs or charaktêresThe other set of secret letters that occurs in P. London-Leiden is usednot only in this manuscript, but enjoyed a wide popularity from thesecond century onwards in the eastern Mediterranean as a mysticaland powerful ‘sacred’ script, the signs of which were calledcharaktêres.139David Frankfurter defines the category in the following terms:137Tr. Janet H. Johnson, with minor modifications (=PDM xiv1206–1218).138Tr. Janet H.

Themost common forms of magicalcharaktêresconsist of asterisks and config-urations of straight lines with small circles or lobes on each end. Theyappear in a variety of contexts, ranging from loose clusters inscribed oncertain magical gems, to their integration with a larger drawing orfiguraon a magical text or tablet, to integration with a recognizably alphabetictext as if to suggest phonetic symbols ‘transcendent’ of the normal alpha-bet, much asvoces magicaewere supposed to be transcended of normallanguage.140Unlike the ‘cipher’ script, these signs had a function in the ritual itself,that is to say, in the majority of cases they had to be written on a pieceof papyrus, lead or bronze, which, for example, was subsequently wornaround the neck as a phylactery or deposited at a hidden spot as abinding spell. The mysterious signs were supposed to represent ‘sacred’writing intelligible only to demons and deities, so that its applicationwould enable direct communication with the divine world.141Whereasthevoces magicaeserved as a linguistic code to establish communicationwith the gods, thecharaktêresfunctioned as an unutterable, and presum-ably untranslatable graphic code to convey a message to the gods.142Inthe following healing spell, the mystery signs are supposed to cure apatient who is bitten by a scorpion.Magic of Writing and the Writing of Magic’,205–211.

However, one has to bear in mind that the communication situation is opposite:heavenly books reveal a message of the divine world to humans, whereas the magicalspells or gems withcharaktêresare an attempt on the part of humans to address thedivine world.142In the late antique period,charaktêresbecame powerful entities of themselves whocould be called upon as protectors or divine assistants.

Together with therapid decline in knowledge of the hieroglyphic script in Egypt itself dur-ing the early Roman period, the Hellenistic perception may have pro-vided fertile soil for these magical signs to develop into an alternativeyet international ‘hieroglyphic’ script. For the same reason, it cannotbe ruled out that Egyptian priests took an active part in spreading thebelief in, and use of, the mystery signs.144In P.

The link betweencharaktêresand hieroglyphs has often been proposed; the most recent treatment isFrankfurter,Religion in Roman Egypt,255–256.144A study of the hieroglyphic texts on the so-called Horus-cippi of the Ptolemaicperiod revealed that the knowledge of the meaning of single signs rapidly declinedin the course of this period and that only certain hieroglyphs or clusters of signswere copied to stand for the complete text.

As has been said in the introductory chapter,previous scholars never took the bilingual nature of the manuscriptsfully into account, but chose to concentrate their attention either onthe Greek or the Demotic sections, which eventually resulted in adisciplinary division of the material. By contrast, this chapter will takethe bilingual nature of the manuscripts as point of departure for aninvestigation into the language attitude of the composers and compilersof the spells by studying in detail the relationship between Egyptian andGreek and their degree of interference in the spells. Before embarkingon a close inspection, the interaction between Egyptian and Greek inthe source material can be defined for the moment as follows:1. On the level of the manuscripts, the distribution of Egyptian andGreek is rather clear-cut, this is to say, the use of a language isrestricted to a self-contained section each. On P. Leiden I384verso, the Greek spells are grouped together in a section of13consecutive columns, which is flanked by a section of Demoticspells on both ends; the twin manuscript, P. London-Leiden, doesnot contain any separate Greek spells next to the Demotic spells.2. On the level of individual spells, Egyptian and Greek are occa-sionally juxtaposed or combined as rather autonomous elements:three Greek spells contain a title in Demotic in addition to theirGreek title (PGM XII.201–269;270–350;365–375)andsevenDemotic spells include an invocation in Greek, to wit: PDM xii.76–107[PGM XII.453–465], PDM xii.135–146[PGM XII.474–479], PDM xii.147–164[PGM XII.480–495], PDM xiv.93–114[PGM XIVa.1–11], PDM xiv.451–458[PGM XIVb.12–15]andPDM xiv.675–694[PGM XIVc.16–27]."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"104chapter four3. The reverse side of P. London-Leiden contains a fair number ofsingle Greek nouns in the Greek script, which serve mainly asheadings to short Demotic descriptions of plants, minerals andanimals. Their integration into Egyptian syntactical patterns israther superficial.4. In certain cases, the recipe part of a Demotic spell contains one ormore Greek loanwords transcribed into alphabetic Demotic signsand fully integrated into the Egyptian syntax. The transcribedloan words may be accompanied by glosses in Greek script abovethe line.As argued in the introductory chapter, there are reasons to believethat certain members of the Egyptian priesthood had, and propagated,a negative language attitude toward Greek to define their culturalsuperiority over the Hellenistic ruling elite. Therefore, it may come asa surprise to find that the two magical handbooks under study, whichmust have circulated among Egyptian priests, as demonstrated in theforegoing chapter, preserve a considerable number of spells in Greeknext to those in Demotic. Why would an Egyptian priestly milieu putfaith in spells written in Greek and treat them on a par with spells in theEgyptian language? The present chapter is an attempt to determine towhat extent the incorporation of Greek spells and words truly meanta breach with traditional Egyptian religious concepts and practices.This detailed study of the bilingual phenomena in the two handbookswill hence put the general validity of the propagated priestly negativelanguage attitude to the test.4.2.Language change and language attitude in Roman EgyptIt is important to examine meticulously the form and degree of lan-guage interference in the magical spells, because modern sociolinguisticstudies have made it abundantly clear that contact induced languagechange is not a self-evident and straightforward phenomenon. In fact,it is a prime indicator of the form and direction of cultural change,because it is governed by social and cultural constraints that are nego-tiated among the members of a speech community.1Roman Egypt was1This and the next paragraphs are based on the following useful introductions tothe study of language and cultural change in bilingual settings: René Appel and Pieter"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"the form and function of bilingualism105a bilingual society in which Greek was the language of upward socialmobility, dominant in the civil administration throughout the countryas well as public life in the major cities. Consequently, the Egyptian lan-guage underwent substantial changes under the influence of Greek inthe course of several centuries, very similar to the way native iconogra-phy, traditional notions of kingship and consumption patterns changedto a degree through contact with Hellenistic culture. By adopting lex-ical and grammatical forms from a prestigious donor language, in thiscase Greek, speakers of a recipient language of lesser cultural status,namely Egyptian, may express their wish to identify with the cultureof the donor language’s speech community, that is to say Hellenism.Changes of this nature are no autonomous developments, but the resultof choices made by individuals who adjust to ever occurring shifts in theaccess to economic resources, while competing with other individualsfor sources of power in the social arena. This means that any study ofcultural change in Greco-Roman Egypt has to account for the creativeimpetus of individuals and the interests of various social groups, whoadopt opportune social strategies and appropriate cultural identitiesdepending on the situation and their aims. Any student of the ancientsources should therefore be prepared to take into account conflictingstands and contradictory perspectives articulated in the material.The form and degree of contact induced language change is deter-mined by a speech community’s language attitude towards a donorlanguage and the type of contact situation. Language attitude is thedegree to which speakers of the recipient language valorise positively ornegatively the donor language, its speakers and its associated culturalsettings.2Since language and group identity are usually felt as closelyrelated, speakers can perceive linguistic borrowing as corruption oftheir cultural traditions or, in contrast, as innovations that enable iden-tification with a prestige language and its culture. Accordingly, languageattitude determines to what extent a speech community is inclined toadopt foreign elements into its language. Suzanne Romaine formulatesit as follows:Muysken,Language Contact and Bilingualism(London1987);SarahGreyThomasonandTe r r e n c e K a u f m a n ,Language Contact, Creolization, and Genetic Linguistics(Berkeley1988);Suzanne Romaine,Bilingualism(Oxford1989); William A.

The study of language attitudes is important becauseattitudes represent an index of intergroup relations and they play animportant role in meditating and determining them.[Bilingualism,258]With respect to language interference and the type of contact situation,the sociolinguist Pieter Muysken distinguishes three processes at workin bilingual speech:31.a.Insertionof single lexical elements from a donor language into astructure of a recipient language.2.a.Alternationbetween structures from two or more languages withina single speech event.3.a.Congruent lexicalisationof material from different lexical inventoriesinto a shared grammatical structure.These processes conform roughly to a particular contact situationeach:41.b. Colonial settings and recent migrant communities, where there isa considerable asymmetry in the speaker’s proficiency in the twolanguages involved.2.b. Stable bilingual communities with a tradition of language separa-tion.3.b. Second generation migrant groups, dialect/standard and post-creole continua, and bilingual speakers of closely related lan-guages with roughly speaking equal prestige and no tradition oflanguage separation.If one wants to apply this scheme to the society of Roman-periodEgypt, it is necessary to differentiate between social groups on the basisof their ethnic origin, occupation, social position and place of residence,because not every Egyptian subject is likely to have been exposedto Greek language and culture to the same degree. Willy Claryssehas demonstrated with the help of Demotic and Greek documentarytexts that, in the Ptolemaic period, Egyptians who were active in theadministration and Hellenistic cultural life, took on a Greek namewhen dealing with Greeks, while retaining their Egyptian name in3Pieter Muysken,Bilingual Speech.

In all likelihood,the vast majority of the native population, especially in the countryside,was only occasionally required to deal with Greek language and if so,mainly through intermediaries, so that their knowledge of Greek willhave been minimal, if extant at all.To reconstruct the effect of these differing contact situations uponthe true nature and degree of language change in the Roman period isnearly impossible, since the sources are written, the majority of whichpreserves rather a history of textual transmission than real life speechevents. Nonetheless, the outcome of the process can be studied inCoptic, the successive language stage, while some information aboutits progression can be gained from analysing the Demotic ostraca fromNarmuthis in the Fayum, dating from the second century CE. Theseostraca were found near the temple of the goddess Triphis in a dumpof what was probably once a temple school.6A high number of themserved as exercises in copying legal documents, drafts of dispatches andvocalized word lists, so that they are likely to come close in lexicon andgrammar to contemporary speech.7Coptic can assuredly be called amixed language, because it contains Greek borrowings on the level oflexicon, phonology, syntax and even information structure.8In the light5The best discussion of this social strategy is: Willy Clarysse, ‘Ptolemaeïsch Egypte.Een maatschappij met twee gezichten’Handelingen van de Koninklijke Zuidnederlandse Maat-schappij voor Taal- en Letterkunde en Geschiedenis45(1991)21–38.

In a fair num-ber of cases, a Greek infinitive occurs as a bare noun in direct objectposition to the agentive verb\"ır, ‘to do’, which is a common proce-dure in Coptic to incorporate a Greek verb into the Egyptian syntax.11One ostracon preserves the prepositionκατ\tfollowed by a Greek nounphrase embedded in a Demotic sentence. The ostraca demonstratehence that colloquial Egyptian of the Roman period was undergoing aprocess of significant re-lexification under the influence of Greek whileretaining its Egyptian grammatical structure, with the result that Copticevolved into a mixed language.12This conclusion is highly relevant in the light of the general lack ofGreek borrowings in Demotic texts that are contemporary or a littleearlier than the Narmuthis ostraca. In a study of Greek loanwords inDemotic documentary texts of the Ptolemaic and Roman period, Willy9See for a discussion of the ‘hierarchies of borrowability’: Muysken and Appel,Language Contact and Bilingualism,170–172and Field,Linguistic Borrowing in Bilingual Con-texts,34–40. The specific order of borrowed linguistic categories depends on the twolanguages involved, but one could say in general that content words (nouns, adjectives,verbs) are more easily borrowed than function words (prepositions, pronouns, articles,conjunctions), while nouns are universally borrowed most easily. The longer and moreprofound the contact between two languages is, the more grammatical categories of thedonor language are likely to enter the recipient language.10A representative, albeit not complete, list of Greek loanwords in the ostraca canbe found in: E. Bresciani and R. Pintaudi, ‘Textes démotico-grecs et greco-démotiquesdes ostraca de Medinet Madi: un problème de bilinguisme’, in: S.P.

With only a fewexceptions, these loanwords are additions to the Egyptian lexicon thatonly became relevant after the introduction of Greek administration.Together with the apparent preference for loan translations rather thanloan words, the lack of substituting borrowings suggests that Demoticscribes were reluctant to adopt Greek borrowings into the written lan-guage, despite the fact that colloquial Egyptian was undeniably chang-ing under the influence of Greek. These observations are reminiscent ofspeech strategies to disguise inevitable foreign influence in contact situ-ations where the speakers of the recipient language have a negative lan-guage attitude towards the donor language and its associated culture.16Yet, one must refrain from extrapolating rashly from the Demotic doc-umentary texts to the language attitude of Demotic scribes at large,because documentary texts were written in a highly specific and for-mulaic speech register, which by its nature was rather resistant to anysort of modifications. Nonetheless, Greek borrowings are also remark-ably absent from letters and literary texts in Demotic. Therefore, thefollowing section will study the Greek loanwords and Greek invocations13W.

This is to determine in what way the spells relateto the contemporary process of re-lexification of the vernacular andthe religiously motivated negative language attitude as articulated, forexample, in treatise XVI of theCorpus Hermeticum.4.3.The process of insertion: Greek loanwords in the Demotic spellsUnlike the Demotic sections of P. Leiden I384verso, the Demoticspells of P. Leiden-London contain a fair amount of Greek borrowings(see appendices4.1–3). The total number of Greek loanwords (62,without magical names) may be quite low compared to the numberof Demotic words in the manuscript (1121), but it is remarkably higher,both in absolute and relative terms, than in any other Demotic textknown to date. The loanwords are without exception single nouns andoccur only within the recipe sections of a spell or in the bilingualdescriptions of medical and magical material on the verso side of themanuscript (columns1–4). This means that the invocations are left freefrom linguistic borrowing—except for the incorporatedvoces magicae,which constitute a different class of linguistic interference and are leftout of the present analysis. The borrowed nouns can be classifiedaccording to three categories:1. Materials of medicine and magic2. Medical terminology3. House utensilsThis tripartite distinction demonstrates that the religious and magicalterminology of the related PGM spells, which carries overtones of ideascurrent in the Greek mystery religions, is absent from the language ofthe Demotic spells.1717The occurrence of PGM terminology deriving from Greek mystery religions isdiscussed in Hans Dieter Betz, ‘Magic and Mystery in the Greek Magical Papyri’, in:Christopher A. Faraone and Dirk Obbink (eds.),Magika Hiera. Ancient Greek Magic andReligion(Oxford1991)244–259. Cf. Robert K.

The items arenot specifically Greek in nature, but belong to an international phar-macological jargon that was current in scientific and occult texts ofthe Hellenistic and Roman period. This jargon occurs in classificationsof the natural world,18medical texts,19alchemical treatises20and Her-metic technical literature,21which works were written inkoineGreekand circulated throughout the Hellenisticoikumeneat large. The con-tribution of ancient Egyptian medicine to this jargon cannot easily beoverestimated, so that the occurrence of the loanwords in the Demoticspells should not be dismissed as an instance of slavish one-way borrow-ing from a dominant Hellenistic scientific paradigm.22Moreover, apartfrom the Demotic magical handbook, the same jargon is also used toa certain degree in a partly preserved Demotic Medical Book of theGreco-Roman period, which belongs otherwise to the pharaonic medi-cal tradition.2318The classical works were Theophrastus,On Stones, Dioskorides,On the Materials ofMedicine, Pliny the Elder,Natural History.19For example, in the works of Celsus, Galen, Soranus, Paul of Aegina.20R.

Thestaterwas originally a Greekweight, but introduced as a unit of currency and weight into Demotic around thefourth century BCE. By the time of the Roman period, thestaterhad become fullyintegrated into the Egyptian language.26The units of weight are of particular interest, because pharaonic medicine madeuse of measures of volume, whereas pre-Alexandrian Greek medicine was rather un-concerned with measured quantity, as was the case in cuneiform medical texts. Fromthe Alexandrian physician Herophilus onwards (3rdcentury BCE), Greek medical textsprescribe precise quantities as attested in both the ‘high’ medical literature and themedical papyri found in Egypt.

Since the excerpts do not record actual speech events,but are the result of textual transmission, it is perhaps better to speakof a donor manuscript and manuscript interference, instead of a donorlanguage and language interference.

The Demotic Medical Book is accord-ingly free of foreign loanwords with respect to its medical terminol-ogy.41Since the use of Greek medical terms is restricted to a singlespell each, every instance is an isolated one-time usage rather thana completely accepted loanword.42The Greek terms are spelled inalphabetic Demotic signs, or in one case in cipher, and integrated intoa running Demotic sentence. The termpodakran(V8/1), written inGreek script, serves as heading to a Demotic prescription against gout.Since the loanword is written in the accusative case without appar-ent grammatical reason, it might be a remnant of a spell in Greekused asvorlageto the extant spell, where the term served as object toaverb.4.3.3.House utensilsP.

In the light of the process of re-lexificationof the Egyptian language during the Roman period, the conclusion iswarranted that the Demotic spells do not reflect colloquial language,but, to speak with John Ray, represent ‘a purified and filtered ver-nacular which was subject to its own rules’.46The categories of loan-words that have been identified above accord well with Willy Clarysse’sconclusions regarding the occurrence of Greek loanwords in Demoticdocumentary texts, this is to say, the loanwords are mainly specialisedinternational jargon and objects of daily life. The adoption of Hellenis-44Althoughκαλα\u0014νηis morphologically an adjective, it is used as a noun followingDemotic grammar.45Note that the alphabetic Demotic transcription retains the genitive case ending ofthe originalμανδραγ\u001aρ\u0010υ .\u0014α.46Ray, ‘How demotic is Demotic?’,264."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"120chapter fourtic pharmacological jargon demonstrates that the compilers were notignorant of contemporaneous developments in the Hellenistic centresof learning, but there are no reasons to assume that the occurrence ofGreek loanwords in the Demotic spells is motivated out of a desire toidentify with Hellenistic culture or to include Greek currents of thoughtin the ritual procedures. In fact, the restricted use of Greek loanwords,both in quantitative and qualitative terms, points rather at a consciouseffort of linguistic purism.In a few cases, there are indications that the Greek terms werecopied from texts used by the compilers of the extant spells. A mainargument is the observation that several loanwords are written withcase endings that are without use in the Demotic linguistic environ-ment.47In all likelihood, the case endings were retained when the wordswere copied from a GreekVo rl a g e.

London-Leiden V2/7–15]The ‘living magnes’ is probably the Egyptian translation ofμ\tγνης3ν,while ‘human magnes’ derives fromμ\tγνης 6νδρε<\u0010ς.48Since thecommon Demotic term for India isHntw, the present formtA#n-tsykecan only be explained as a transcription of@ \u0017Ινδικ#under the influenceof a Greek manuscript. It is therefore likely that the entire passageis a translation of a Greek pharmacological description, of which thetwo Greek termsmagnhsandmaknhswere copied into the extanttext. These observations conform to the conclusion of the previouschapter, that the multiplicity of scripts is the result to a large degreeof the consultation of manuscripts in different languages and scripts.Hence, the occurrence of Greek loanwords is less a matter of languageinterference than of manuscript interference.47Examples are:hliogononandselhnogonon(V1/4–5),vhklhs(V3/4),avro-selhnon(V3/12),podakran(V8/1).48See for references Griffith and Thompson,The Demotic Magical Papyrus of Londonand Leiden,vol.1,172, fn. to lines11and13."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"the form and function of bilingualism1214.4.The process of alternation: the ritual power of foreign languagesThe lack of Greek loanwords in the Demotic spells could easily beexplained as a reflection of a negative language attitude towards Greekand thus as in support of nationalistic priestly beliefs. However, thisassumption is seriously challenged by the presence of seven discreteGreek invocations incorporated into seven Demotic spells. Unlike theGreek loanwords, which occur only in the recipe part of the spell, theGreek invocations had to be pronounced in the course of the rite, sothat they played an active and significant role in the ritual itself. Ifthe editors of the spells had considered Greek invocations ineffectiveon account of the fact that Greek is ‘empty speech’ (CH16/2.16),they would not have included these seven invocations as means toaddress the divine and manipulate the workings of nature. In otherwords, the presence of the Greek prayers demonstrates that the editorsof the Demotic spells attributed ritual power to the Greek languagenotwithstanding the clear-cut message ofCorpus HermeticumXVI.In imitation of Peter Muysken, I define this bilingual phenomenon asalternation between languages within a single, self-contained magicalprescription.49The languages remain separate insofar that they main-tain their linguistic structure, form a discrete section and serve each adistinct function within the text and ritual. At the same time, the dis-crete sections are related to the extent that they are both subservientto the same magical goal and cannot do without the other to attainthis goal. Any recitation of a Greek invocation will be futile as longas the requirements regarding ingredients and ritual acts as prescribedin the accompanying Demotic recipe are not met. Words, ingredientsand ritual acting are connected with each other through mythologicalallusions and the rules ofsympatheiaandantipatheia. Therefore, in the fol-lowing pages, the relationship between the Greek invocations and theiraccompanying Demotic recipes is analysed to determine the degree ofcoherence and, if possible, the causes and rules of language alternation.Apart from these seven instances of language alternation within asingle spell, there is one instance of language alternation within asingle speech event.50In an elaborate Demotic invocation of a vessel49Muysken,Bilingual Speech,3–10; see also chapter5.2. Pieter Muysken is onlyconcerned with alternation between structures of languages within a singlespeech event.50I leave out of the discussion Greek clauses that might possibly be mangled andhidden invoces magicae.

The language, style and imagery of the invocation are in accordwith traditional Egyptian religion and ritual throughout, but in oneinstance a Demotic clause switches into a Greek adverbial phrase.

It derives its adverbial function primarilyfrom Greek morphology, even if its position at the end of the clauseconforms to Demotic syntax. A close comparison of the alphabeticDemotic spellings with their associated glosses reveals that each alpha-betic Demotic character constitutes a pair with a corresponding Greekletter, which suggests that the Demotic rendering is a faithful transcrip-tion of the Greek spelling instead of an attempt to reproduce in writingthe factual pronunciation of the Greek expression. It is therefore likely,that the adverbial phrase was adopted from a text in Greek and tran-scribed into alphabetic Demotic characters while retaining the originalspelling as supralineal glosses.V13/6;seeGriffith and Thompson,The Demotic Magical Papyrus of London and Leiden,vol.1,163, fn. to line1and186, fn. to line6.

Robert Rit-ner suggested translating it as ‘casting for inspection’, because the ritualfinally entails the drawing up of a horoscope;54Heinz-J.

Hav-ing placed four bricks under the bench, the practitioner should throw alittle ball made of goose fat, myrrh and.ks-#n ̆h-stone onto a clay censer,while reciting ‘this spell in Greek’ (line7). When he goes to sleep with-out having spoken to anyone, the god will appear to him in the guiseof an Egyptian priest wearing clothes of byssus and sandals and answerall his questions.

Unlike the lengthy invocations of the numerousDemotic divination rites preserved on the manuscript, this invoca-tion does not address the divine by recognizable traditional Egyp-tian names and places of worship. Instead, it mainly takes recoursetovoces magicae, whose etymology is far from clear and possibly notEgyptian.59The connection between the sun god and the moon god-dessnebouthosoualêthis also suggestive of an origin outside the tra-ditional parameters of Egyptian religion. The alien character of theinvocation is reinforced by the fact that the interaction between theDemotic prescription and the Greek invocation is rather limited. Wereit not for line7, ‘you have to pronounce this spell in Greek to it (theclay censer)’, the textual parts would seem to function independentlyfrom each other: neither does the invocation refer to the prescribed rit-ual action, nor can ritual techniques and ingredients be linked to thedemons invoked. It is hence conceivable that the extant spell is actuallynot an organic unit, but a composite of text units of different origins,which were combined during the phase of compilation.This hypothesis finds support in two Greek glosses written abovetwo common Demotic words in the recipe text. The wordtks‘throne,chair, boat’ is glossed withtrapesenfromτρ\tπεα, ‘table’, (line1),whilesr\"ıw.t‘goose’ is accompanied by the glossyhna[g]rioufrom\u001f:ν=γρι\u0010ς‘wild goose’ (line6). In this particular instance, the glosses donot reproduce a vocalised version of the Demotic word, as is usu-ally the case with glosses, but give the Greek lexical equivalent ofthe Demotic term. They are provided with case endings, respectivelyaccusative and genitive, that perfectly match with the syntactic func-tion of their Demotic equivalents, respectively object and possessive.It seems odd that an Egyptian scribe would take pains to supplementregular Demotic words, which are not to be pronounced, with Greekglosses provided with correct and corresponding case endings, whichare without meaning in the Egyptian syntax.

Soundsthat are, in this case, not Egyptian but Greek. This does not meanthat the spell derives from a Greek cultural background, because theritual procedures are clearly in accord with traditional Egyptian ritualtechniques.

Since the spell plays consciously with the Osiris myth anddisplays a detailed knowledge of the ritual topography of the Abydosregion, the spell must be the product of an Egyptian priestly environ-ment. The most natural conclusion would hence be that the Demoticversion, albeit written in secondary position, is the original renderingand the Greek spell a faithful translation. However, a close compari-son of the spellings of thevoces magicaeand the topographical names inboth versions reveals that, in fact, the extant Demotic version is trans-lated from the Greek text (see the two following tables).

According to an account of Herodotus, Egyptianpriests never offered an animal’s head up to the god, but cursed it andtook it outside the sacred precinct of the temple.80After leading the marked beast to the altar where they [Egyptian priests]will sacrifice it, they kindle a fire; then they pour wine on the altar overthe victim and call upon the god; then they cut its throat, and havingdone so sever the head from the body. They flay the carcass of thevictim, then invoke many curses on its head, which they carry away.Where there is a market, and Greek traders in it, the head is taken tothe market and sold; where there are no Greeks, it is thrown into theriver. The imprecation, which they utter over the heads, is that whateverill threatens those who sacrifice, or the whole of Egypt, fall upon thathead. In respect of the heads of sacrificed beasts and the libation of wine,the practice of all Egyptians is the same in all sacrifices; and from thisordinance no Egyptian will taste of the head of anything that had life.[Herodotus,The Histories, II,39]Therefore, by making use of the head of a donkey, the rite does notonly establish a close relationship with Seth, but also it defines itself asa rite opposed to the rules of regular temple ritual, which is in accordwith Seth’s role as enemy to the ordered world. When the practitionerapplies the donkey’s blood to one of his hands, he trespasses in thesame way another rule of Egyptian temple ritual. Since blood was seenas impure, the flowing of the sacrificial victim’s blood symbolized thetriumph over the enemies in regular temple ritual. In this particular79Yvan Koenig,Magie et magiciens dans l’Égypte ancienne(Paris1994)147–149.Thecurses recited during such an execration ritual are preserved in a fourth century BCEmanuscript:Urk.VI,SiegfriedSchott,Bücher und Sprüche gegen den Gott Seth2Vo l s .(Leipzig1929–1939).

Daybreak and evening were proba-bly considered opportune moments for this rite, because they are thebeginning and end of the sun god’s nightly travel through the under-world, where he has to enter into battle with the forces of chaos andevil, who attempt to bring the sun boat to a standstill in their effortto subdue the forces of creation and rejuvenation. By reciting at thesecritical moments between light and darkness, the practitioner takes fulladvantage of the intensified activity of the forces of disorder. More-over, according to pharaonic sun theology, the god Seth, part of the sunboat’s crew as a servant to Re, exerted his destructive powers now tocombat the snake Apopis, the sun god’s arch-rival in the underworld.81Seth and the sun god were consequently believed to be in each other’spresence at these moments.The Greek invocation develops the Sethian elements of the rite fur-ther by calling the deity the god of cosmic upheaval, who is hostile tothe social order82and dwells in foreign countries.83As outsider to thedivine pantheon, the social world and the land Egypt, he is the appro-priate candidate to take up the anti-social task. In the final lines of theinvocation, the practitioner prompts the deity to come to his aid byaccusing the victim of having ‘spilled the blood of Typhon in his own(or her own) house’ (line19–20). This language act establishes a mean-ingful link between the rite and the words, for, within the parameters of81Coffin Text spell160and Book of the Dead spell108situate the battle betweenSeth and Apopis at sunset.

The blood functions in fact as evi-dence of the unjust and blasphemous behaviour of the intended victim:the practitioner puts the blame for the slaughter of the god’s animalon the victim in order to direct the deity’s anger at him.84The god isaddressed as Typhonsethand coerced to listen by speaking out his truename, a string ofvoces magicaethat recurs now and again in Greek spellsdealing with Seth Typhon.85Like thevoces magicae, the namesethisprovided with a horizontal supralineal line in black ink, which indicatesthat the editor considered the Egyptian name avox magica,ahiddenname granting great powers to those who know it.86Since the nameTyphon lacks the horizontal stroke, it functions as the ordinary nameof the god, a tag to identify the god on the level of colloquial lan-guage. Considering the ancient views on the ritual power of language,the common Egyptian name, albeit placed in secondary position, mustthen have precedence over the Greek term, representing the efficacioushidden essence of the god. It is therefore warranted to conclude that,like the prescribed acts, the invocation draws on traditional Egyptiannotions of myth and ritual, notwithstanding its Greek linguistic form.This conclusion is borne out by the Greek invocation’s close similarityto the words of the following curse in hieratic taken from an execra-tion ritual conducted in the state temples to subdue Seth’s destructiveforces.\u0002Oyou\u0003thief, lord of lies, ruler of deceit;Leader of criminals is he;Who is content with desertion and hates brotherhood;Whose heart is haughty amidst the gods;Who creates enmity and causes destruction;The ‘Evil One’ (dbhA<tbh) who creates rebellion[Urk.

LeidenI384verso in a slightly different version in two spells to separate twopersons. The first spell (PGM XII.365–375) is entirely in Greek, thoughprovided with an additional Demotic title in the left margin (διακ\u0010π\u001aς=w#pr ̄d;line365); in the second spell, four columns farther on themanuscript, the Greek invocation is again combined with a recipe inDemotic (PDM xii.76–107[PGM XII.453–465]). The latter spell is partof a cluster of four Demotic separation spells, the other three of whichmake only use of the string ofvoces magicae, mentioned above, that isreserved to invoke the demonic powers of Seth Typhon (PDM xii.50–61;62–75;108–118).87All five spells prescribe to write the invocation orthe magical names on a sheet of papyrus or an ostracon and to bury itin a place where the couple meets or passes by. One of them orders todraw on an ostracon an image of a standing man with a donkey’s facetogether with four Sethianvoces magicae(PDM xii.62–75; see fig.2.2). InPDM xii.76–107, the connection with Seth is made explicit through theink of donkey’s blood. The Greek spell (PGM XII.365–375)evokesarelation with Seth by ordering to write the invocation on a potsherdof a vessel used for storing smoked or pickled fish.88Since fish hadeaten Osiris’ male member after Seth had thrown his body into theriver, fish were often considered impure, chaotic and evil beings.89Apotsherd that had been in contact with fish could therefore serve as anappropriate writing medium for a Sethian curse formula. The last partof the invocation exploits the Osiris myth again by equating the coupleto be separated with Osiris and Seth or Isis and Seth depending on thegender of the intended victims.I call upon you who are in the empty air, you who are terrible, invis-ible, great god, you who afflict the earth and shake the universe, youwho love disturbances and hate stability and scatter the clouds fromone another,iaia iakoubiai iô-erbêth iô-pakerbêth iô-bolchosêth bas-douma patathnax apopss osesrô ataph thabraou êô thaththabra bô-rara arobreitha bolchosêth kokkoloiptolê rambithnips; give to him,NN,thesonofher,NN,strife,war;andtohim,NN,thesonofher,NN,87All three spells write thevoces magicaein alphabetic Demotic signs together withsupralineal glosses in the Greek script.

Contact between Egypt andthe people of this region startedat least in the third millennium BCE,so that the social and cultural interaction between these two regionshad become fairly complex by the time of the Greco-Roman period. Inthe course of time, Egypt had more than once exercised military andeconomic control over the region for substantial time periods. However,at the end of the Third Intermediate Period (around730BCE), rulersfrom Kush invaded Egypt and established their political and religioussupremacy for about seventy years. During the Greco-Roman period,the Nubian Kingdom of Meroe gradually developed into a seriouspolitical entity that regularly threatened and questioned the southernborder of the Ptolemaic and subsequent Roman Empire.99These his-torical developments resulted in a multi-layered image of Nubian cul-ture and topography among the Egyptian elite, floating between theextremes of anxiety and respectful admiration.100On the one hand,Nubia was seen as a dwelling place of the gods, so that substantialtemple building programs were carried out in the region;101on theother hand, its people were feared for their character and knowledge98Schott, ‘Ein Amulet gegen den bösen Blick’; see also Borghouts, ‘The Evil Eye ofApopis’,148.99Derek A.

The first level is char-acterised by emotive language use (‘O Amun, this lofty male’) spokenby Horus’ mother, the goddess Isis, whose name is not mentioned butcan be inferred from the phrase ‘Horus, my son’ (line2). By describingthe scene in her words, Isis acts as focaliser of thehistoriola, meaningthat Amun’s behaviour is presented to the reader through the eyes of102Koenig, ‘La Nubie dans les textes magiques’,105–110.103Onhistoriolain the magical papyri, see, David Frankfurter, ‘Narrating Power: theTheory and Practice of the Magical Historiola in Ritual Spells’, in: Marvin Meyer andPaul Mirecki (eds.),Ancient Magic and Ritual Power(Leiden1995)434–476.104The tense of all verbal forms is obscure, so that the translation can only betentative.

The quotation, whichis purportedly in Nubian, has resisted translation until today, possiblybecause the invocation is but a collection of sounds that could serve asan icon of Nubian speech in the perception of an Egyptian audience.Whatever the authenticity of the Nubian quote, the text claims that thespell’s ritual power is contained in the un-Egyptian sounds, since Amunof Meroe once pronounced them to cure successfully the child Horus.The present spell takes recourse to the Nubian language to share in,or take advantage of, the large potential of Nubian spells and powerfulsounds, which the Egyptian elite feared and admired.

It is therefore significant toobserve that the Egyptian goddess Isis keeps the Nubian spell ultimatelyin check, since she is the primary internal narrator of thehistoriola.Inthis fashion, Nubia remains as it were under Egypt’s command.1094.4.5.The pragmatics of language alternation in the Demotic spellsThe foregoing discussions have demonstrated that language alternationis a fairly limited phenomenon in the Demotic magical spells, but thatwhen language alternation occurs, the process of incorporation doesnot pose serious problems to the internal cohesion of the spell. In thesecases, the functional specialization of the two languages, and hencetheir separation, is stringent: a recipe or invocation in a mixture ofDemotic and Greek or Nubian never occurs. A degree of interferencebetween the languages concerned can only be observed on the level ofthe symbolic properties of prescribed acts and ingredients on the onehand and, on the other, the mythical configuration of invoked deitiesand demons. The presence of Greek invocations in otherwise Demoticspells can be attributed to a generally felt inhibition to translate magicalsounds into a second language. The spells were composed with severalVo rl a g e nin various languages and scripts at hand and, when an editorthought a Greek invocation to be appropriate, he copied it withouttranslating it into a recipe that he wrote in Demotic irrespective of thelanguage of its sources. In case the invocation lent itself for multiplepurposes, it could be adapted without apparent problems, thevocesmagicaecould even be spelled in alphabetic Demotic signs if necessary.In the light of the negative language attitude, propagated most ex-plicitly in tractate XVI of theCorpus Hermeticum, these conclusions arefar-reaching. The relative lack of Greek loanwords in the Demoticspells might corroborate the message of the tractate, but the presentdiscussions reveal that the nationalistic propaganda was not followedin all priestly circles, if authoritative at all.

Nonetheless, there is one examplewhere translation did occur: in this particular case from Greek intoDemotic. None of the Demotic spells pass a negative value judgementwith regard to ritual efficacy on Greek invocations. In fact, the spellsseem to be rather indifferent with respect to language attitude. In thecase of the Nubian invocation, its presence can be explained out of adesire to include exotic sounds that long since were deemed powerful.This socio-cultural explanation is of no value with respect to the Greekinvocations, because no Greek deities are invoked as powerful beingsand no Egyptian text ever passes a judgement on Greek ritual andmagic. The presence of the Greek invocations is rather motivated outof respect for theVo rl a g e n. It is therefore a matter of textual transmissioninstead of real-life sociolinguistics.Whatever the exact degree of language alternation in the Demoticspells, it is always high in comparison with the Greek spells preserved inthe thirteen consecutive columns on P. Leiden I384verso (PGM XII).These spells never incorporate a Demotic section, except for an occa-sional additional title in Demotic. Therefore, with respect to scripts andlanguages, the Demotic spells are far more flexible than the Greek pre-scriptions. However, the Greek spells combine religious imagery andtextual formats of various cultural origins in their addresses to thedivine, quite different from the Demotic spells. For that reason, afterstudying in the last two chapters the ‘diversity of scripts and languages’in the Demotic spells, the following chapter will analyse the ‘diversity inrhetoric’ in the Greek spells."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"chapter fiveDIVERSITY IN RHETORIC5.1.Alternation of writing traditions in the Greek spellsThe thirteen Greek columns preserved on the reverse side of the Leidenmanuscript J384contain eighteen spells that deal with divination,sending dreams, procuring charm and success, and the like. The sectionis concluded with a list of code words provided with an equivalent termfor each entry, which is presented as a translation of secret knowledgeof the Egyptian temple scribes (P. Leiden384verso12/17–13/30=PGM XII.401–444).1The issues treated in these spells are thus similarto those in the Demotic charms discussed so far. However, from a cross-cultural perspective, the Greek spells are more complex, because theyincorporate overtly cultural elements from a wide geographic area,ranging from Egypt, to Greece, the Near East and Persia. Given thissyncretistic flavour, they fit perfectly in with the corpus ofGreek MagicalPapyri, of which they have been an established part since the beginningsof PGM scholarship.2Apart from the various cross-cultural influences,the spells share with other PGM material the attribution of spells to afamous, though often fictitious, author, and the occurrence of Greekdeities, who have merged with Egyptian gods more often than not.Since these elements can occasionally be observed in the Demoticspells as well, the difference between the two linguistic corpora is reallya matter of degree. Nevertheless, the difference must be taken intoaccount when studying the sphere of production and use of the magicalhandbooks.1This text will be treated in detail in chapters6.1and2.2Albrecht Dieterich, who is one of the ‘founding fathers’ of the study of the PGM,wrote his dissertation on PGM XII in1888: ‘Papyrus magica musei Lugdunensis Batavi,quam C. Leemans edidit in papyrorum Graecarum tomo II etc.’, in:Jahrbücher fürklassische PhilologieSuppl.

None of the Greek recipes con-tains a prayer in Demotic or any other language. Language alternationis only at stake when an additional Demotic title is inserted above aGreek spell, which occurs three times. In one case, an elaborate spellfor consecrating a ring that will endow its wearer with charm and suc-cess is headed by a Demotic and Greek title (PGM XII.201–269). ItsGreek title, which reads ‘A little ring [useful] for every [magical] oper-ation and for success’, is preceded by Demoticw#gswr,‘aring’,whichis added above the line in the small space left after the last line ofthe preceding ritual text (P. Leiden I384verso6/26=PGM XII.201).Although the Demotic term does not contain any information that theGreek title does not provide, the scribe deemed it for an unknown rea-son necessary to add it. The second instance occurs in the subsequentspell, which describes a ritual of a similar nature, where the Demotictitle is neatly written in the middle of an empty line above the Greekritual text (PGM XII.270–350; title in P. Leiden I384verso8/23). Inthe third case, a separation spell (PGM XII.365–375), the Greek title‘Charm for causing separation’ is preceded by a scribbled Demoticw#pr ̄d‘a separation [spell]’ in the left margin (P. Leiden I384verso11/15= PGM XII.365). In all three cases, the spells, albeit written in Greek,came to be categorised under a Demotic heading. Whatever the actualorigins of the Greek spells, in the extant manuscript they were obvi-ously read by a person proficient in the priestly Demotic script and,as a consequence, versed in Egyptian theology. Since the present studyis concerned with the producers and users of theextantmanuscripts,the Demotic titles call for an interpretive attitude which takes an Egyp-tian temple milieu as its starting point, even if the spells are written inGreek. Therefore, the analyses presented in this chapter try to read thespells with an Egyptian user (preferably a priest) in mind.3How wouldhe have made sense of the various ritual techniques and religious ideaswhen reading and using the Greek texts?43It goes without saying that such a reading of the spell is restrictive, because itreduces the text to a univocal interpretation, whereas, in fact, the text itself invitesmultiple readings, thus enabling it to be used and appreciated in various religioussettings, be it with minor adaptations. However, the person who decided to includethe spell in this particular collection of Demotic and Greek spells, was in all likelihoodan Egyptian priest.4Note that this approach leaves aside the question whether or not the Egyptian"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"diversity in rhetoric147In comparison with the Demotic spells, the phenomenon of codemixing is evidently less attested in the Greek section of P. Leiden I384verso. However, several Greek spells combine prayers that derive fromvarious cultural and linguistic settings, a few of which are possiblydirect translations from Egyptian into Greek. In this way, it wouldnot be correct to speak of ‘alternation of languages’, even thoughsome passages may still reflect their linguistic origin. In these spells,passages that give the impression of being translated from Egyptianor that have an unmistakable Egyptian character alternate with Greekhexametrical hymns or with sections that testify to a sophisticatedmastery of Greek language and style. To account for this peculiarphenomenon, it is useful to coin the phrase ‘alternation of writingtraditions’ in imitation of ‘alternation of languages’. This phrase makesclear that code mixing merely takes on a different form in the Greekspells. The present chapter will trace the alternation of genres and stylesby studying an elaborate prayer that is part of a ritual for consecratinga ring to acquire success (PGM XII.201–269)—the first spell with aDemotic heading. In the manuscript, this spell is immediately followedby another ring spell, also provided with a Demotic title, which revealsan alternative way of mediating between traditional Egyptian templeritual and the shifting demands of private religious life in the Romanperiod. Both analyses will reveal the complexity of cultural interferenceand, at the same time, raise questions concerning the representationof the Egyptian priesthood. These questions will only be addressed inchapters6and7; the present chapter focuses on the diversity of writingstyles.5.2.1.Consecration of the ring (PGM XII.201–216)For those who wished to aggrandise their social position, the magicalhandbook P. Leiden I384verso preserves a rather complex spell forconsecrating a magical ring that might have been of help (PGM XII.201–269). Even ‘kings and governors m[ake use of it]’ its introductorylines want the reader to believe. The spell comprises a detailed recipe,which, different from ancient Egyptian magical spells, comes first, anda lengthy prayer addressed to the All-Lord, which will be analysed intemple was the true place of origin for these spells.

The recipe prescribes the use of a goldenring with a blue coloured jasper gem, which the practitioner shouldengrave with a detailed design. The design represents a snake hold-ing its tail in its mouth, within whose circular posture a crescent moonwith a star on both its horns should be engraved. Above the moon, asun (Helios) together with the nameabrasaxmust be inscribed. Thereverse side of the stone should have the namesabrasax, in the centre,andiaô-sabaôthalong the rim of the stone. Since gems with similardesigns have been found in Egypt and throughout the Mediterranean,rituals of this kind were indeed conducted in antiquity.5This combina-tion of the snake design, the Egyptian so-called Ouroboros snake,6withthe Semitic namesiaô-sabaôthis of particular interest and character-istic of the multi-layered and cross-cultural nature of theGreek MagicalPapyri. Once the stone has been engraved and is set into the goldenring, it must be induced with power by a strict succession of ritualactions consisting of burnt offerings and recitations.The ritual consist of two separate offerings conducted above twoseparate altars. On a sacred spot suitable for religious ceremonies ornext to a purified tomb, a pit (\u001d\u001a\u001eρ\u0010ς) has to be dug above whichan altar (\u001dωμ\u001aς) has to be erected of the wood of fruit trees. On thealtar the practitioner should make a burnt offering of an unblemishedgoose, three roosters, three pigeons and all sorts of incense, the fumesof which will rise up into the sky. Next he must stand near the pit andmake a libation of wine, honey, milk and saffron, which substances willpenetrate the soil.7While holding the ring in the smoke of the offering,the lengthy prayer has to be said.5For examples, see, Campbell Bonner,Studies in Magical Amulets chiefly Graeco-Egyptian(Ann Arbor1950) and Delatte and Derchain,Les intailles magiques.6The snake who eats its own tail (sd m rA) is a symbol of regenerative time. Itcontains and protects within the circle formed by its body the ordered cosmos ascreated by the sun god; see B.H.

In all likelihood, theburnt offering is directed towards the heavenly powers, whereas the libations are aimedat the powers in the earth. Together with the use of the two Greek technical terms\u001dωμ\u001aςand\u001d\u001a\u001eρ\u0010ς, this ritual structure evokes the idea that the Greek Olympianand chthonic offering are combined into one ritual setting. However, the distinctionbetween Olympian and chthonic in Greek religion has recently seriously been chal-lenged; for the latest opinions and relevant literature, see, Renate Schlesier, ‘Olympianversus Chthonian Religion’Scripta Classica Israelica11(1991–1992)38–51and Scott Scul-lon, ‘Olympian and Chthonian’Classical Antiquity13(1994)75–119."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"diversity in rhetoric149At first sight, the interaction between invocation and described ritualactions is not evident. It is only towards its end that the invocationrefers to the ring held in the smoke of the burnt offering as ‘this power’(δ%ναμις;259,260) and ‘this object’ (πρFγμα;266). A possible interplaybetween prayer and ritual actions might be detected in the prayer’sopening address to the three personified aspects of the sun god whomight correspond with the threefold nameiaô-sabaôth-abrasaxandthe tripartite design of sun, moon and stars on the stone. Other thanthat, the invocation is a self-contained prayer to the All-Lord, whichdraws its effect upon its own phraseology.5.2.2.Close reading of the prayer (PGM XII.216–269)The invocation can be divided into five distinct parts according to itscontent and textual form. As a sharp divide between each section servesa concluding address that explicitly asks the invoked god to come to theaid of the practitioner. Before embarking on a close analysis of eachsection in the light of the cultural traditions from which it borrowsimagery and idiom, the structure of the invocation can be outlined asfollows:i. Address to the three suns (=iaô-sabaôth-abrasax?) (lines216–227)ii. Self-presentation of practitioner by identifying with a range ofdeities and divine attributes that can easily be traced back totraditional Egyptian theology (lines227–238)iii. Prose hymn to the All-Lord (lines238–244+252–263)iv. Hexametrical hymn incorporated into iii. (lines244–252)v. Invocation of deity according to his ‘Names of the Nations’ (lines263–267)The invocation is an address to the All-Lord, the pantocrator, whoseplurality is repeatedly stressed without ever mentioning explicitly hisname in the text. The idea of a cosmotheistic being who is self-engen-dered and governs nature, for having created it himself, was widespreadin the Roman period. Several religious groups of diverse origin turnedtheir attention to a deity of this kind without necessarily discardingthe multiplicity of polytheistic theology. In their view, the All-Lordstood above, and ruled, the lesser gods who were still believed to exerttheir influence on life on earth. Such religious currents were popularamong the newly founded movements such as Hermetists, Gnostics,"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"150chapter fiveNeo-Platonists, while more traditional communities such as Jews andEgyptians had already developed similar ideas at a much earlier stage.8In Egypt the idea can be traced back to the Ramesside period (about1300–1100BCE) and a foregoing formative period starting with Amen-hotep III (1391–53BCE).9The priesthood of Amun promoted its deity,who had originally been a wind god, to the status of ruler over thewhole cosmos who was One among the many and from whom lifecame forth.10After a short interruption that celebrated a monotheis-tic sun god at the expense of all other deities, known as the Amarnaperiod, the Amun-Re theology flourished and its ideas were put intowords in the form of hymns executed on temple walls or written onpapyrus rolls. This practice continued into the Roman period, with thisrestriction that its ideas were often transferred to local deities to fit localdemands.An important argument in favour of the inclusive instead of restric-tive character of the invocation is the absence of an explicitly nameddeity or references to a well-established mythology. In accordance withthe inscription on the reverse side of the stone, the invoked deity isprobablyiaô-sabaôth-abrasax, but these names are not mentioned inthe invocation itself. Even the otherwise so pervasivevoces magicaearealmost entirely absent in this particular case. The few occurrences areall idiosyncratic, so that they are of no help in tracing the precise iden-tity of the invoked deity.

These gods are in heaven, under-world and the region in between, daily coming forth from one womb.This imagery is strictly in line with traditional Egyptian cosmography,according to which the goddess Nut gives daily birth to the sun god inthe early morning, so that he can make his journey along the firma-ment, which is Nut’s body, to be swallowed up again by Nut’s mouthin the evening, thus entering the underworld. During this trip the sungod takes on three different forms: youth or scarab in the morning,vigorous disk or falcon at noon and old man or ram in the evening.14Just like the Egyptian sun god who shines upon the living on earth andthe deceased and demons in the underworld, the three suns are called‘the masters of all living and all dead’. The invocation continues with arepetitive list of greetings to the deities with each line attributing a dif-ferent function or sphere of influence to them. The list celebrates theirpower over the physical world: they not only direct the fate of men, butexert influence as well over forces in nature, such as wind, waves andfire. In this way several elements of the image of the All-Lord are takenup. By portraying them as controllers of the Nemeseis and Fate, theinvocation is clearly set in the Hellenistic and Roman period, when theidea of a preordained human lot developed and became widespread.In spite of this, the textual form of the prayer, a list of epithets, eachentry of which is introduced by an exclamatory greeting, with a directaddress to come over to the worshipper as a conclusion, was alreadyan old and common Egyptian hymnic device. This device is well illus-trated by a passage from a funerary composition dated to the Augustanperiod.ORe;OAtum;OShu;OTefnut;OGeb;ONut;OOsiris;OIsis;O Nephthys; O Horus; O Hathor; O great Ennead; O small Ennead;O Indefatigable-Ones (j ̆hm(w)-wrˆt; stars of the southern constellation); OImperishable-Ones (j ̆hm.w-sge.w; stars of the northern constellation); O14Since each aspect corresponds with a name, Khepri in the morning, Horakhti atnoon and Atum in the evening, it is tempting to associate the threevoces magicaeanochmane barchuchwith these names.

Consequently, the practitioner mustclaim a status similar to that of the god by taking on the roll of a god.In other words, he must become an actor in the cosmic drama.19Theprocedure to do so consists of identifying oneself with a range of deitiesand giving the correct epithets to show that one possesses the necessaryhidden knowledge. This scheme recurs in all sorts of ritual texts andwas thus not at all viewed as blasphemous or confined to the darkerside of magic. The first spell of the Book of the Dead, which kept beingcopied down into the Ptolemaic period, is illustrative of the technique.Only the first lines are given.Greetings to you, Osiris, bull of the west (spoken by Thoth), king ofeternity,I am the great god on the side of the divine boat,I have fought for you,I am one of the gods of the tribunal,Who make Osiris triumph over his enemies on that day of judgement,I belong to your entourage,I am one of these gods whom Nut gave birth to,Who slays the enemies of Re and arrests the rebels,I belong to your entourage, Horus,I have fought for you; I have acted on your behalf.IamThoth,Who makes Osiris triumph over his enemies on that day of judgementin the great mansion of the prince which is in Heliopolis.[Book of the Dead, spell1]20Something similar occurs in a New Kingdom magical text to ward offevil spirits during the final five days of the year.

The sectionresounds with imagery taken over from Osiris theology and accountsofthedailybirthofthesunoutoftheprimevalwaters.22The firsttwo lines play on the image of the Osirian funerary complexes suchas those in Abydos, Busiris and Philae, that had vineyards and palmtree gardens situated along the processional way and around the verytomb of ‘The Great One’.23References to Krates, the abyss, theUdjat-eye and Phoenix have all to do with the rising of the sun god inthe morning.

By an act ofmasturbation and spitting, he produced a couple that brought genderinto being and constituted the ether. Shu, the male, is the god of airand wind (‘Sender of winds’), while his consort Tefnut (tuphi)repre-sents fire. Together they brought forth another couple, Geb and Nut,who set borders to the physical world. By outstretching his body, Geb(Kronos)25formed the earth above whom Nut stood on her hands and25The epithet given to Geb-Kronos in the Greek invocation repeats Helios’ epithet:"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"diversity in rhetoric157feet to form the sky, the abode of the stars, which were considered godsin Egypt (‘mother of gods who is called Heaven’). The result of theirunion was a third generation consisting of two couples: Osiris with hisconsort Isis and Seth with his wife Nephthys. The Greek invocation hasundoubtedly deleted Seth (Typhon) because of the destructive qualitiesof this god, having become the ultimate symbol of disorder in Egyp-tian theology since the Late Period.26His wife Nephthys is primarilyreferred to in Egyptian sources as Isis’ sister and companion in griefwhile mourning the deceased body of Osiris (êsenephus).27In this fash-ion, the practitioner is not only taking on a set of divine names, he isalso conveying a specific Egyptian religious discourse that explains thecreation of nature and provides the legitimacy of pharaonic kingship,regardless of the fact that it is partly disguised by its Hellenistic idiom.28It remains open to question whether the author was really aware ofthese implications and whether he intended to reshape this theologytowards contemporary needs.The section closes again with an address to the gods to come tothe aid of the practitioner. He forces them by the threat to invoke the‘who showed forth light’. Since Geb is never provided with a similar epithet in ancientEgyptian texts, it is well possible that the editor of the extant text mistakenly copied theepithet twice.26H. te Velde,Seth, God of Confusion: a study of his role in Egyptian mythology and religion(Leiden1967). See also chapter4.4.3of the present book.27The formêsenephusprobably derives fromS.t-Nb.t-.Hw.t, ‘Isis and Nephthys’. Thename is also mentioned in PGM CXXII.52(dating from the first century CE).28An intriguing tension between Egyptian imagery and Hellenistic idiom can beseen in line229where the scribe mistakenly wroteΣ\u001aκρατηςinstead ofIKρ\tτης,changing Harpocrates,.Hr-pA- ̆hrd, symbol of the sun god as a youth, into a ClassicalGreek name, well known as that of the fifth century Athenian philosopher (\u0010insteadofω). Despite the established identification of Krates with the Egyptian Harpocrates, itis interesting to note that the nameΚρ\tτηςwas also wide-spread as a personal nameof philosophers, poets and scholars in the Greco-Roman period; for a list consisting of21entries, see,PRE11(1921)1622–1642(entry17discusses the present passage). Theuses of the wordεKδωλ\u0010νin line235, ‘I am the Image resembling the true images’,opens up a huge intertextual field. In Greek religion it denotes the soul of the deceased(Homer, Orphics), while Plato and Epicures also use the term to refer to the materialimprint made in the mind by observation. At the same time, the clause reminds of theidea of Amun-Re emanating into all other gods: ‘The Ennead is assembled in yourlimbs; every god is your image (t\"ı.t--k) united with your being ( ̄d.t--k)’ [P.

The parallel texts of PGM XIII.732–1056and XXIare almost identical, whereas the version under discussion has inserteda more or less independent hexametrical hymn, elaborates upon theterrifying effects of speaking out the name of the All-Lord30and leavesout a section on the eight Egyptian primeval gods.31The first part ofthe hymn is what follows.Come to me, you from the four winds, god, ruler of all, who havebreathed spirits into men for life, master of the good things in the world.Hear me, lord, whose hidden name is ineffable.

The section corre-sponds with Merkelbach’s section S. One could only speculate about the reasons whythe scribe left these out. Nevertheless, the occurrence of these eight divine entities isanother strong argument for reading the invocation in the light of Amun-Re theology,since they were an essential part of its cosmology; see, K. Sethe,Amun und die AchtUrgötter von Hermopolis(Berlin1929).32The papyrus givesελευσεται, which is either to be emendated toLλ\u0014σσεταιor6ν\u0010\u0014γεται(see Merkelbach, Totti,Abrasax I,176and Daniel,Two Greek Magical Papyri,xxii, note to line241).

The following passage occurs in an elaborate hymnconsisting of several ‘chapters’, which combines the secrecy of Amun-Re’s being and name with its dreadful character.Unique is Amun, who is hidden from them,Who conceals himself from the gods, so that they do not know his being,Who is more remote than the sky, who is deeper than the underworld,None of the gods knows his true character,His image is not explained (pr ̆h) in the writings,One learns (mtr) nothing certain ( ̄dr.y.t) about him,He is too mysterious to fathom (kfA) his majesty,He is too big to inquire him, too strong to know him,One falls immediately dead because of terror,When his secret name is spoken, knowingly or ignorantly,No god can call him with it,(Heisa)ba,whosenameishiddenashissecret.[P.

At a certainmoment, a redactor must have incorporated this poetic hymn into theinvocation, since it is missing from the parallel texts in PGM XIII andXXI.Who moulded the forms of the beasts (of the Zodiac)?

Similarly, the incorporation of the hexametrical hymnmakes clear that the composers of the extant invocation employedsources other than Egyptian and did not feel restricted to Egyptiangeneric forms.50The reference to the beasts of the zodiac, which imagedeveloped in the Hellenistic period outside of Egypt, points in a similar48See for a visual equation of Sarapis with Agathos Daimon (snake with Ser-apis’ head):Égypte Romaine.

The wordplay with the concept of Aion51and the grouping ofthe four elements of the cosmos as a given set into a single verse line arealso indicative of a highly Hellenised milieu.52The hymn itself consistsof a series of rhetorical questions whose expected answer introduces alist of glorifying epithets to the All-Lord. The epithets merely developupon the recurring theme of the god for whom all nature shivers andwho has brought everything into existence.The following lines252–263complete the prose hymn to the panthe-istic god:Yours is the eternal processional way (of heaven), in which your seven-lettered name is established for the harmony of the seven sounds (of theplanets) which utter (their) voices according to the28forms of the moon.Yours are the beneficent effluxes of the stars, demons and fortunes andfates.

Yea,lord, for to you the god in heaven, all things are subject, and none ofthe demons or spirits will oppose me because I have called on your greatname for the consecration.[PGM XII.252–263]These lines contain again elements that originated outside Egypt. Thefirst above line can be understood only within Hellenistic cosmology,which teaches that the seven planets circle around the earth emittingthe seven sounds that have their effect upon earthly events.53The‘seven-lettered name’ that is established within this constellation refersto the idea of the Greek seven vowels whose powerful qualities havebeen discussed in chapter3.3.54In these lines, accrediting the deity51The idea of a plurality of Aions developed mainly among gnostic (pagan andChristian) circles, see: H. Sasse, ‘Aion’RAC1,193–204.52The idea of the four elements as constituents of the cosmos was incessantly dis-cussed by Greek philosophers starting with Heraclitus and Empedocles and becamewidely influential in antiquity, especially in Stoic cosmogony; see, L.J. Alderink, ‘Sto-icheia’DDD,815a–818a. The idea was probably not unknown in pharaonic Egypt butbecame never articulated in a consistent manner; cf. the list of examples in J.

The closing line bringsthe purpose of the ritual finally to the fore: the deity is asked toconsecrate the ring that will serve as a powerful phylactery to its wearer.The reason given to the god reveals again the preoccupation with the‘hidden name’: ‘because I have called on your great name’.As if this name would not be sufficient, the closing line of thecomplete invocation lists another five names:And again I call upon you,according to Egyptians,phnôeai iabôk;according to Jews,adônaie sabaôth;according to Greeks, ‘the king of all, ruling alone’;according to the high priests, ‘hidden, invisible, overseer of all’;according to Parthians,ouertô‘master of all’.Consecrate and empower this object for me, for the entire and glorioustime of my life![PGM XII.263–267]These names, grouped along ethnic lines except for the high priests,bring three important new elements to the discussion, which will be ofcentral concern in the next chapter: ethnicity, translatability of culturesand high priests as a distinct class and discrete concept. The sectiontakes up again the idea that the deity can be compelled to act in accor-dance with the practitioner’s will, ifthe correct names and epithets arecalled upon. In this case, however, the names do not allude to hid-den knowledge confined to a specific mythic constellation, but, on thecontrary, they are concerned with a multiplicity of religious manners,opening up a wide geographical area that is thought to be the deity’srealm. The underlying idea of the invocation is that different peo-ples living in different areas give their supreme deity differing names,although these are ultimately only varying denominators of one andthe same All-Lord. This topic, which Jan Assmann coined the ‘Namesof the Nations’ motif, was very popular in connection with the con-cept of the pantheistic deity in the Hellenistic and Roman period.55Anencomium of Isis in Greek, preserved on a papyrus from Oxyrhynchus(P. Oxy1380) which is dated to the early second century CE, glori-fies the goddess as the mistress of the cosmos and gives a long list ofnames and epithets in a geographical arrangement before enumerating55Jan Assmann,Moses the Egyptian.

The author of the opening lines of thedivine decree about the Abaton on emperor Hadrian’s gate at Philaemay have had such a text at his disposal.

After he has prayed to her and laid himself downon the beach, she appears to him in a dream consoling him that she isthe cosmocrator and nourisher of all living beings and will relieve himof his troubles. Her self-identification is replete with epithets knownfrom the Isis aretalogies and cosmotheistic hymns. She explains thatshe is worshipped in many different forms and manners, but that, inthe end, all her many names come down to her true name,verum nomen,by which she is only known among the Ethiopians and Egyptians. Sheaffords these two ethnic groups this prestige because of the presumedantiquity of their customs and religious knowledge. By stressing theantiquity of their doctrines, her discourse touches upon, and respondsto, the Greco-Roman fascination for Egypt as the land of ancientwisdom. However, apart from this intertextual motif, Ethiopians andEgyptians could also be considered the true guardians of Isis worship,because they conducted her cult in Philae, the goddess’ southernmostcult place and popular pilgrimage site in the Greco-Roman period.60My name, my divinity is adored throughout all the world, in diversemanners, in variable customs, and by many names. For the Phrygiansthat are the first of all men61call me ‘the Mother of the gods at Pessinus’;the Athenians, which are sprung from their own soil, ‘Cecropian Min-erva’; the Cyprians, which are girt about by the sea, ‘Paphian Venus’;the Cretans which bear arrows, ‘Dictynnian Diana’; the Sicilians, whichspeak three tongues, ‘infernal Proserpine’; the Eleusinians ‘their ancientgoddess Ceres’; some ‘Juno’, other ‘Bellona’, other ‘Hecate’, other‘Rhamnusia’, and principally both sort of the Ethiopians which dwell59H.

Pride of place is given to the Ethiopians and Egyptiansbecause they know theverum nomenand the proper rites whereas theother nations have only artificial access to the goddess. This tensionbetween theverum nomenand the multitude of variant names of one andthe same god is precisely what occupies the magical texts to the utmost:the search for the hidden, all-encompassing name of the divine being.The short concluding ‘international’ invocation of the PGM XIIspell is thus part of a larger theological discourse that comes to lightin several Roman-period compositions made for the goddess Isis.63Thepresence of these lines in PGM XII has far-reaching effects for theintercultural character of the manuscript as a whole. Ethnicity has nowbecome a productive category of thought with positive connotations,in contrast to the nationalistic message of tractate XVI of theCorpusHermeticum. There seems to be no overt hierarchy among the differentethnicons as in Apuleius’ text, unless the enumeration must be taken asstrictly and purposefully ordered: Egyptians, Jews Greeks, high priests,Parthians. If so, the text does not give any clue as to whether the list isarranged from lesser to higher prestige or vice versa. It is remarkablethat the high priests are treated as a distinct category in a list enumer-ating ethnic groups. However, the underlying principle of the list is notso much ethnicity as it is religious discourse. Sole criterion for inclusioninto this list is the group’s possession of a distinct fitting name or epithetfor addressing the divine. Although there is no hierarchy among thesegroups, they certainly had a value attached to them because of whichthey were included in the list. The Egyptians and Jews were seen inthe Greco-Roman period as great magicians who were able to do greatfeats.

The Parthians, originating from Northern Iran, werefor more than two centuries the enemy of the Roman Empire in theNear East until their defeat in the220s CE by the Persian Sassanids.Could the ethnicon therefore be a terminus ante quem for the compo-sition of the spell? Such a straightforward explanation cannot be givenfor the Greeks who were never viewed as experts in rituals and magic asagroup.64The occurrence of this group should however not be surpris-ing given the overall presence of Hellenised communities in the easternMediterranean. However, one could be somewhat surprised that thelist does not contain ‘the Romans’, whose presence was clearly visiblein the landscape throughout the Near East. The inclusion of the highpriests, which is a social instead of ethnic category, is, as said, remark-able. Something similar can be observed in the Isis encomium fromOxyrhynchus where the list ends with the Magi, the Persian priestsof the fire ritual. These Magi are set offagainst the Persians as thehigh priests against the Egyptians in the PGM spell, although both fallwithin the ethnic category:among the Persians ‘Latina’; among the Magi ‘Korè, Thapseusis’Both these groups were seen as privileged among their ethnic groupand therefore set apart as being highly specialized masters of the magi-cal arts.The names that are laid into the mouths of these groups seem to be amixture of Greek epithets andvoces magicaethat are not always in accordwith their respective languages. This mystification of languages recursin otherGreek Magical Papyri, although not always explicitly connectedwith the ‘Names of the Nations’ motif. The languages mentioned areprimarily Hebrew, Syrian (which is missing in the PGM XII spell), andEgyptian. In the latter case, language and script are usually not clearlydistinguished, presumably on account of the mystical qualities ascribedto the hieroglyphs in the Hellenistic world. Examples are:I conjure you in the Hebrew language(PGM III.119)I am the one who calls upon you in Syrian, great god:zaalaêriffou;and you should not ignore my utterance in Hebrew:ablanathanalbaabrasilôa.(PGMV.472–475)64Note that several subgroups could be viewed as being particularly inclined to-wards the magical arts.

These identical Demotic headings suggest that the two spells weremovements could be accredited with knowledge of the magical arts.

Despite these links, thetwo spells are fairly different in their way of conducting the consecra-tion, both with respect to the ritual action and address to the god. Nextto the recipe for consecrating the ring, the second spell provides twoadditional invocations, called theOuphôr, that should be recited eachtime the practitioner wishes to put the ring to use. Its textual structureis accordingly as follows:iDescription of the ring and its possibilities(lines271–284)iiInvocation of the ‘greatest god’(lines284–307)iiiPrescription of theOuphôrritual(lines307–322)ivInvocations of theOuphôr(lines323–350)The text claims to provide the practitioner with a ring that is capa-ble of executing virtually all magical operations, because ‘it containsan excellent name’ (line273): it bestows its wearer with respect andadmiration, makes friends, creates wealth, restrains anger, opens doors,breaks chains, bursts rocks and exorcises demons.The prescribed stone and its design are different from the previousspell. In the present spell, a heliotrope stone has to be engraved withan image of the sun asOuroborossnake containing within its circularbody the image of a scarab with sunrays.67The reverse side of the stoneshould be inscribed with Helios’ name ‘in hieroglyphs, as the prophetssay’ (line276).68The consecration of the ring consists of invoking ‘thegreatest god, who exceeds all power’ (line284), while facing the sun, inthe third, sixth and ninth hour, during fourteen days, starting from thethird day of the moon month with, preferably, the moon in the zodiacalsign of Bull, Virgin, Scorpion, Water Carrier or Fishes (lines307–309).While reciting, the practitioner should pour libations as specified in thefirst spell and burn all kinds of perfumes except frankincense. After67For a detailed discussion of the stone’s design and the prescribed time of execu-tion, see, Ian Moyer and Jacco Dieleman, ‘Miniaturization and the Opening of theMouth in a Greek Magical Text (PGMXII.270–350)’JANER3(2003)47–72.68The prophets are the highest class of the Egyptian priesthood; for detailed discus-sion, see chapter6.3.1.

The majority of these names are garbledvoces magicae,butthe string begins with the Jewish namesiaô sabaôth adônai eilôein(line285), incorporates the names of the patriarchs Abraham, Isaacand Jacob (line287), the name ‘the opponent of Thoth’ (line289),the entire Maskelli-Maskello formula (lines290–291), the Jewish name‘Cherubi[m]’ (line296), the Egyptian name ‘Soul-of-Darkness’ (line296;\u001dαιν\u001fωω\u001f), one of the GreekEphesia Grammata, ‘Damnameneu[s]’(line299), and closes with the seven vowels (line301).70In this fash-ion, the supreme deity is summoned through an amalgam of powerfulnames, which originally derive their power and prestige from differ-ent currents of thought. Having invoked the god in these terms, thepractitioner should beg the god ‘that you may give divine and supremepower to this statue (D\u0010\tν\u0010ν) ...’ (line302). It is highly significant thatthe object of consecration is calledD\u0010\tν\u0010νinstead ofδακτυλ\u0014δι\u0010ν,‘alittle ring’, as in the spell’s title, because the former term’s usage indi-cates that the magical ring functions as a divine statue within the rite.71According to Egyptian theology, a statue does not merely represent aphysical image of the divinity, but truly incarnates the god on earth,after the requisite ritual of Opening the Mouth has been conductedonto the statue.72In the following, it will be shown that this ritual of69This technique is probably meant to make the animal’s pulse enter the ring.

The most famous and most elaborateof these is found in Rekhmire’s tomb from the18thdynasty (TT100). Although theritual text was only occasionally copied onto the walls of the tomb in the Late Period,the ritual text is still attested on three hieratic papyri of the Roman period: P.Louvre3155,P.CairoCG58036and a papyrus from Saqqara mentioned in M.G. Daressy,‘Fragments d’un livre de l’ouverture de la bouche’ASAE22(1922),193–198;forthefirst two manuscripts, see, E.

The basic meaning ofπνε\u0011μαis ‘wind in motion’ but as early as the fifth century BCE itwas developed in Greek medicine and philosophy into a concept thatdenotes ‘breath of life’ or ‘spirit of the cosmos’.89It became even thecentral concept of Stoic physics as referring to the divine soul thatpervades the whole cosmos and acts as its cohesive principle. In theSeptuagint, it refers to the soul of God and in theNew Testamentit becamethe concept of the Holy Spirit.90At the time of the Roman period,the term had consequently become a multi-layered concept that couldappeal to philosophical and religious communities of a different kind.However, given the Egyptian context of the spell, the Egyptian ideaof theba, the essence or manifestation of the divinity present in thestatue, will have prevailed for the editors, regardless of the possibleinterpretations of their readers. In the final line, the text makes clearthat the rite is concerned withπν\u0010#(breath), a synonym ofπνε\u0011μα,although without the same broad range of metaphorical connotations.As in the first ring spell, the practitioner wants his ring (the mystery)to be imbued with enlivening breath through the help of the gods andpowerful spirits, which pervade the whole cosmos (heaven, earth, seaand river).91The secondOuphôrinvocation (lines336–350)isalistofvoces magicaeconsisting of15entries written on a separate line each.

Nonetheless, the formal generic criteria of listing, repetitionand variation combined with a layout in three separate columns arepersuasive enough to define theOuphôrinvocation as an Egyptian litanyin Greek. As in the first two lines of the preceding invocation, the scribewas again eager to retain the traditional textual format in the layoutof the text, which reveals that he was aware of the text’s Egyptianroots. The names that follow after each greeting formula are nothingbutvoces magicaeas they can be found throughout the PGM. Althoughsome can be interpreted as deriving from Egyptian epithets or phrases,they were part of an international current of magical thought, which,in this particular case, are fitted in into a traditional Egyptian textualformat.To conclude the foregoing analysis, it is warranted to state thattheOuphôrrite, besides its name, shows striking similarities with theEgyptian ritual of Opening the Mouth, even if none of the requisiteritual acts are prescribed in the Greek text. Those priests participatingin the Egyptian ritual of Opening the Mouth and the daily ritual in thetemple, tried through a fixed succession of ritual acts to make contact"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"182chapter fivewith the divine energy potentially present in the statue. Likewise, theOuphôrrite creates a setting in which the practitioner addresses thepotent energy that is contained in his ring. If the ring and its stone areimagined as a miniature shrine containing its statue, similar to those setup in an Egyptian temple, the practitioner changes into an Egyptianpriest who is opening the wooden doors of the divine shrine, adoringthe divine statue and motivating it to bestow its life-generating powersupon earth. In this fashion, theOuphôrrite is no less than a miniaturizedcosmic drama such as those rituals that were enacted in the Egyptiantemples on a daily basis. The pharaonic ritual of Opening the Mouthwas tightly bound to an Egyptian temple complex or, in the case ofperforming it onto the mummy, to the forecourt of the tomb chapel,but theOuphôrrite has been adapted to a portable, cheap and easilyperformed ritual believed to work anywhere and anytime ‘because thisis the true one’ (line320).5.4.Once again the ‘Paradox of Translation’The two ring spells discussed in the foregoing are complex rites, whichcombine in a meaningful way ritual techniques, textual forms andreligious vocabulary and imagery that originate from different culturegroups. In the first spell, the stone should be inscribed with a designcombining Jewish names and an EgyptianOuroborossnake and is con-secrated with an invocation of a more or less anonymous pantheis-tic deity. The invocation’s imagery and stylistic devices derive to alarge extent from ancient Egyptian sources except for the hexametri-cal hymn, the idea of the seven heavenly spheres and the ‘Names ofthe Nations’ motif. In the second spell, a similar combination of tradi-tional Egyptian and Hellenistic ideas is at work. The ritual instructionsstress the importance of the zodiac in determining the right momentof consecration, whereas theOuphôrrite is clearly an appropriation of atraditional Egyptian ritual, irrespective of the fact that only the namewas left unchanged. The twoOuphôrinvocations imitate ancient Egyp-tian ritual hymns as far as their textual form is concerned, but, on thelevel of phraseology, include idiom and magical names that open up awide intertextual and intercultural field.The recurrence of the prose hymn to the anonymous All-Lord inPGM XIII and XXI illustrates rather well that these kind of spells werecomposed with the help of other texts, some of which were considered"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"diversity in rhetoric183quite prestigious judging from their reuse towards different ritual aims.This practice of collecting religious texts to use them as sourcebooks tocompose new spells came also to light in the analysis of the Demoticmagical spells in chapters3and4. In that case, however, it resultedin a complex combination of languages and their scripts. The stylisticdevices and imagery used in the Demotic spells remain well within theboundaries of Egyptian religious thought, even in those rare cases whenan invocation in Greek is inserted. This is an important distinctionbetween the Demotic and Greek spells which needs to be stressed.Although the two ring spells are entirely written in Greek, they relyheavily on sources from different cultural backgrounds, which makesthem into complex products of an intercultural environment.The reader will have noticed that the discussion of the ‘Names ofthe Nations’ motif returned to issues that have been dealt with inthe introductory chapter. Celsus and Porphyry advocate the idea thatthe various appellations for the gods in different languages are butvariants of one and the same name, a view to which Origen, IamblichusandCorpus HermeticumXVI oppose vehemently, all three for differentreasons. The spell PGM XII201–269takes clearly issue in this debateby addressing the All-Lord with his variant names as they are usedamong different religious groups. It thus acknowledges that the variantsare meaningful and magically potent, but, at the same time, that theyare merely weak parallels of thenomen verum, ‘your great name for theconsecration’, that is not explicitly given. This debate was taken upin the introduction to coin the phrase ‘paradox of translation’ and toshow that the Demotic spells are governed by this tension betweentranslation and prohibition. TheOuphôrrite is an illustrative case inwhich the prohibition to translate is clearly trespassed. It is certainlynot a slavish translation of the ritual of Opening the Mouth, since noneof the essential ritual acts of the original ritual appear in theOuphôrrite, but, notwithstanding, the advertising introduction plays upon theritual’s Egyptian origin by referring to this Ourbikos who probably wasa well-known Egyptian priest among the intended audience. Even moreconvincing of its genuine Egyptian roots are the litany and the imageryof ‘opening the gates of heaven and earth’, which must be the result ofa direct consultation of hieratic or Demotic ritual texts. It is thereforeintriguing to see that the ring spells, which occur together with Demoticspells on one and the same manuscript, bring us back, from a differentperspective, to this ‘paradox of translation’, although, for the Greektexts, the paradox’ spell had been broken."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"chapter sixOF PRIESTS AND PRESTIGETHE NEED FOR AN AUTHORITATIVE TRADITION6.1.IntroductionThe Greek section of P. Leiden I384verso closes with a text that islikely to draw immediate attention on the part of a modern reader dueto its rather bizarre contents (PGM XII.401–444). Unlike the forego-ing eighteen spells, the text is not concerned with procuring a magicaleffect itself, but claims to provide a translation key for a proper under-standing of the ingredients prescribed in magical recipes. The text,which will be given in full in the following section, is actually a cata-logue listing a fair number of rather repulsive bodily fluids and bodyparts of animals and gods like crocodile dung, lion semen, a hawk’sheart, semen of Hermes, and Kronos’ blood. These items occur only inthe left column of the list, whereas the right column consists of herbs,minerals and animal substances that are known from other contempo-rary magical and medicinal sources. The list, consisting of thirty-sevenentries, presents thus nothing more than encoded ingredients with theirrespective decoded solutions. In this way, crocodile dung appears to beEthiopian soil, while semen of Hermes is a code name for the herbdill: the unusual character of the ingredients is thus only superficial. Infact, these ingredients must have been easily available in Egypt or inany flourishing harbour town of the Roman Empire. In this respect,the text should have been an indispensable tool for any magician whodid not want to be misled by the encoded recipes of his magical books.The catalogue is preceded by a short introduction that not onlyexplains the function of the list, but also tries to take away any suspicionon the part of the reader about the nature and reliability of the list. Itruns as follows.Interpretations (Lρμηνε%ματα)translated(με\u001eηρμηνευμ&να) from the holy(writings), of which the temple scribes (9ερ\u0010γραμματε<ς)madeuse.Be-cause of the nosiness (περιεργ\u0014αν) of the masses, they (the temple scribes)wrote the (names of the) herbs and other things that they made use of"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"186chapter sixon statues of gods in order that they (the masses), since they do not takeprecautions (μ: ε0λα\u001d\u0010%μεν\u0010ι), do not meddle (περιεργ\tωνται)1at all,due to the inevitable result of their mistake. However, we have collectedthe solutions (λ%σεις) from many copies, all of them secret.[PGM XII.401–407]The rather densely written introduction claims that the list derivesfrom holy writings that were in use by thehierogrammateis,acommontechnical term for Egyptian priests who wrote the native language andscripts.2The reader is made to believe that these priests used to encodethe names of necessary ritual ingredients to prevent untrained laymenfrom performing any kind of ritual activity. Since the lay masses wouldbe excessively curious about rituals, the priests encoded the ingredientsand wrote them on statues of gods. If then, for whatever reason, anyuninitiated might ever get hold of the ritual texts, he would nonethelessbe unable to perform any magical feat, since he would only makeharmless errors out of ignorance. To counter this problem, the presentlist pretends to give the necessary solutions as they were found in animpressive amount of secret, and thus authentic, Egyptian documents.Who could still mistrust the authenticity of the list after having read theintroduction?These introductory lines and its following list raise some fundamen-tal questions about the social and cultural embedding of the magicalmanuscripts that have been studied so far. First of all, statues engravedwith the names of ingredients for magical rituals as described in theintroductory text are not attested in Egypt for any time period. Egyp-tian statues were indeed provided with texts in the majority of cases,but, in the case of private statuary, only the owner’s name, titles andsometimes a biographical account were written on the statue, whereascult statues were only provided with their name, if at all, or attributes.The so-called healing statues andHorus cippiwere written all over withmagical spells for curing snakebites and scorpion stings, but none of thepreserved specimens contains a list of ingredients. In fact, these stat-ues could do without ritual prescriptions, because the patient was onlyrequired to drink the water that he or she had first poured over the1The verbπεριεργ\tεινhas a derived meaning ‘assiduously investigating and per-forming rituals’, the overtones of which are certainly brought into play in the presentpassage; cf. ‘Zauberei treiben’, Preisendanz,PGM II,84, and ‘practice magic’, Betz andScarborough inGMPT,167.In1Ep.Cor.9.13εργ\tεινdenotes ‘performing rituals’.2See for a more detailed description of the duties of these priests section6.3.1."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"of priests and prestige187statue.3It is therefore warranted to conclude that the present introduc-tory lines attribute to the Egyptian temple scribes a custom that wasfactually not extant in antiquity.4It is clear that the introductory lines serve for the intended readeras a validation of the decoded list’s trustworthiness. As with the intro-ductory text to theOuphôrrite, the present text tries to impress andto take away any suspicion on the reader’s part by stressing the Egyp-tian origin and secret character of the list. Since the advertising textrefers to a priestly custom that was not extant in historical reality, itshould be considered a fiction, a marketing technique, which antici-pates the client’s needs, aspirations and expectations. The question isthen who this client or intended reader was. In view of the false claimabout Egyptian statues, it is very unlikely that the text aims at con-vincing Egyptian priests, who would of course have known that ingre-dients were not written on statues of gods. However, this observationseems at odds with the conclusion of the previous chapters that thetwo handbooks must have circulated among Egyptian priests. Who elsethan Egyptian priests could have consulted these bilingual manuscriptswith their multiple Egyptian scripts?To complicate matters further, the narrator of the introductory linessets Egyptian priests apart from himself and his readership by speakingabout ‘them’, the temple scribes, and ‘us’, the compilers and readers ofthepresenttext.Accordingtothetext,‘we’havecollectedanumberof‘their’ secret books to translate them and share their content with othermembers of ‘our’ group. In this fashion, the text constructs an image ofthe temple scribes that is based on notions of separation, secrecy, trans-lation and professional knowledge—knowledge that the narrator andhis in-group deeply desire. A similar dichotomy seems to be evoked in arecipe that describes the ritual techniques for a correct picking of plants(PGM IV.2967–3006), which is preserved in the Great Magical Papyrusof Paris, which manuscript formed part of the Theban Magical Library3A valuable overview is given in László Kákosy,Egyptian Healing Statues in ThreeMuseums in Italy (Turin, Florence, Naples)(Catalogo del Museo Egizio di Torino, Serieprima—monumenti e testi IX; Turin1999)9–34.4Nonetheless, it is very likely that the author of the text meant to refer to theHoruscippi, because this type of magical statues was very popular in the Late and Greco-Roman period.

In what way does the text acquire authority and prestige for whatkind of reader?4.

The next chapter will address thissubject and present a hypothesis as conclusion to this study of the soci-ological context of theDemoticandGreek Magical Papyri.6.2.Compound plant names and ancient botanyIn my youth, I met Apion the Grammarian,who informed me that the herbDog’s Head(cynocephalia), known in Egypt asOsiritis,wasa source of divination and a protection againstall black magic.[Pliny the Elder,Natural History,30.6.18]6The text in question, PGM XII.401–444, consists of an explanatoryintroduction (401–407) and a list of ingredients (408–444), which ismade up of thirty-seven entries that are conveniently arranged onthe manuscript in two straight columns, of which the left containsthe encrypted name and the right the decoded equivalent. The textstarts in about the middle of the twelfth Greek column and occupiesin its entirety the following column thirteen, which, being the finalGreek column of the manuscript, is followed by four more columnsinDemoticbeforethepapyrusbreaksoff. In relation to the marginof the column, the text is markedly indented as if the scribe meant toadd a drawing as he did at the top of the column next to a list ofvocesmagicaethat are identically indented (PGM XII.386–395; the drawing inquestion is fig.2.2). The present section will study the nature of the listand demonstrate that it is not an idiosyncratic second or third centuryinvention, but that, in fact, it contains remnants of botanical jargonthat Egyptian priests of the pharaonic period used in their medical andmagical texts. Parts of this jargon are also preserved in the bookOnBotanywritten in the first century CE by Pamphilus, a lexicographer6Tr. John F. Healey. Apion the Grammarian was a scholar in Alexandria, born inEl-Kharga Oasis, who wrote on Egypt and Homer. He was sent to Rome as memberof a delegation of Greek citizens to plead their cause in front of emperor Caligula aftersevere anti-Jewish riots in Alexandria.

ThePGM XII list should thus be read as a lexicographical study with thisdifference that it principally lists ‘mysterious’ and decoded terms thatwere in use in the field of magic and medicine. The items given in theleft column (A) are said to derive from ancient temple texts as compiledby temple priests, whereas the right column (B) contains the solutions.It is not possible to discover an overall order in the list except for certainalphabetic and thematic groupings, which suggests that the list is com-piled from several older manuscripts (or fragments of manuscripts?).12The reading direction of the list is unmistakably from left to right asfollows from additions like ‘this means’ and ‘this is’ in column B.incorrectly between square brackets in his translation, thus suggesting it is a restorationofalacuna(GMPT,168).

LiDonnici wishes to demonstrate that theclaims about the indispensability of the list made in the introduction,are senseless pretensions.16Shearguesthatnoneoftheitemsofcol-umn A save one occur in recipes of theGreek Magical Papyri,whereasseveral items of column B are openly called for. In other words, ‘thelist provides explanation where explanation is not needed, and providesmystification rather than clarity’.17If applied to the available evidencethis conclusion is correct, and she continues suggesting ‘that the list“interprets” substances from a formulary that is lost, or that it does notinterpret PGM-style materials at all, but belongs in a quite different13Because of its rather bizarre items, the list is reminiscent of the so-calledDreck-Apotheke, which was particularly popular from the seventeenth century CE onwardsand has its roots in medieval and classical sources.

The eagle became a symbol of authority and kingship in Egypt only after itsintroduction by Alexander the Great and his Ptolemaic successors, who saw it as thesacred bird of Zeus, king of the gods: Emma Brunner-Traut, ‘Adler’LÄI,64f.15Dimitri Meeks and Christine Favard-Meeks,Daily Life of the Egyptian Gods(Ithaca,London1996)60–63[translated from:La vie quotidienne des dieux égyptiens(Paris1993)].16Lynn R.

The following three argumentscan be raised against the second conclusion:1. Only a fraction of the magical literature of antiquity is preserved.What cannot be found in the extant sources could very well havebeen present in manuscripts now lost.2. The disguising device is in fact attested in PGM XIII.1066–1067.19The items ‘blood of a baboon’ (415) and ‘semen of Helios’ (433)areattested in respectively PGM XIII.316and PGM III.332,PDMxiv.889(= P. London-Leiden verso1/4).203. The information provided by the introduction should certainly notbe taken at face value, but, at the same time, it should not be dis-missed too rashly as pretentious bogus, since the method of usingfanciful and repulsive names for plant and mineral species wasalready in use among priests in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia.A direct parallel to the PGM XII list is not known from ancientEgypt as might be expected from the introduction to the list, but asimilar device is attested in a cuneiform botanical treatise called Uru-anna=maˇstakal, which, according to its introduction, was compiled fromolder texts during the reign of the Assyrian king Assurbanipal (668–627BCE).21The handbook, preserved in several redactions, is a listofmateria medicaconsisting of plants, minerals, dairy products and ani-mals. Each entry gives a name in Sumerian or Akkadian followed bya second term, which is probably a so-calledsuccedaneum,analternativewith identical medicinal properties that could be applied in case the18Op. cit.19‘Taking the navel of a male crocodile (it means pondweed) and the egg of a scaraband a heart of a baboon (it means myrrh, perfume of lilies), put these into a blue-greenfaïence vessel’ [PGM XIII.1065–1069].20LiDonnici mentions these occurrences, but concludes from the low number ofattestations that the use of the device was negligible. Given the limited number ofpreserved manuscripts, I hesitate to accept this conclusion and prefer to stress the factthat it was indeed in use.21The majority of the texts is published (without translation) in R.C. Thomp-sonCuneiform Texts from Babylonian Tablets in the British Museum14(1902)andFranzKöcher,Keilschrifttexte zur assyrisch-babylonischen Drogen- und Pflanzenkunde(1955).

I am highly indebted for this paragraph to professor M. Stol whogenerously translated the text for me and patiently answered my questions."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"194chapter sixfirst mentioned plant or mineral was not available.22The third tabletcontains a list of138entries that differ in character from thesuccedanea.Instead of the usual determinative for ‘plant, herb, drug’, a Sumero-gram meaning ‘secret’ precedes each entry of the second column, indi-cating that the second column does not provide alternatives but secretcode names orDecknamen.23These code names are similar in design to,but save for one item never identical with, the code names of PGM XII:for example, tail of a mongoose (III,1), faeces of man (III,5), dust ofcrossroads burnt in fire (III,19), bone of man (III,34), tongue of a mul-ticoloured snake (III,59), tallow of chameleon (III,67), head of a malesheep (III,108), scorpion tail (III,122= PGM XII.425,columnB!),saliva of a dog (III,128). Each of these items is followed by the namefor an ordinary herb, mineral or liquid as in the PGM XII list. Giventhis exact correspondence between the device of the PGM XII list andthe third tablet of the Uru-anna=maˇstakal, it might seem obvious toassume that the Greek text is a reflection of Mesopotamian influence intheGreek Magical Papyri. However, this conclusion is probably not cor-rect: if Mesopotamian influence were to be found in the Greek text, itmight probably only be circuitous via Egyptian priests (who were par-ticularly receptive to new ideas from Mesopotamia since the first periodof Persian domination24). In fact, Egyptian priests made already use offanciful names to describe plant species since at least the New King-dom. In one case, even an exact parallel between the PGM XII list anda pharaonic text is available. To understand correctly the relevance ofthe Egyptian priesthood to the subject, it is necessary to deal first withpharaonic botany before continuing the discussion.22Thesuccedaneawere an important field of research in ancient medicine. Lists canbe found in Galen,Book on the Substitutes[C.G. Kühn (ed.),Claudii Galeni Opera Omnia(Leipzig1830)vol.19,721–747] and Paul of Aegina [I.L. Heiberg (ed.),Corpus MedicorumGraecorum(Leipzig1924)vol.19.2,401–408]. Scarborough is wrong in calling these listssimilar to the PGM XII list, since the latter’s entries do not consist of alternatives butof encoded and decoded terms (GMPT,167,fn.95).23Köcher, ‘Ein Text medizinischen Inhalts’,204.24See on the reform of the House-of-Life and the introduction of astrology in Egyptduring the Persian period: Jacco Dieleman, ‘Claiming the Stars: Egyptian Priests facingthe Sky’Aegyptiaca Helvetica17(2003)277–289."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"of priests and prestige195excursus:pharaonic botany & pharmacologyIn the light of the present discussion, the following observations regard-ing pharaonic botany and pharmacology are particularly relevant:251. It can be concluded from the fact that medical and magical textsfrequently prescribe plant and mineral substances as ingredientsfor offerings, potions, unguents, or amulets, that a form of botanywas existent in pharaonic Egypt.2. Plant species are occasionally given names similar in form to thosein column A of the PGM XII list.3. Medical and magical texts were written and consulted by priests,so that the fanciful plant names were known, if not invented, byEgyptian priests.Testimonies of pharaonic botany are very few as regards detailed de-scriptions or meticulous drawings of plants, but occasional descriptionsin medical books demonstrate that priests had at least developed arudimentary descriptive format.26Nonetheless, pharaonic drug therapyrelied heavily on the use of plants and minerals, so that it is justifiedto conclude that priests of the pharaonic period were knowledgeable inthe identification and use of plant species. It is only from the Romanperiod that a botanical treatise systematically listing descriptions ofherbs is preserved. The manuscript, now in a very fragmented state,dates to the second century CE, is written in Demotic and once formedpart of the Tebtunis temple library.27Each heading is provided witha number, of which86is the highest to be recognised (possibly even99), and the name of a herb, after which the herb’s outward appear-ance, florescence, place of growth, medicinal properties and use aregiven. The herb and plant names, of which only about a dozen are25Introductions to pharaonic botany and pharmacology are: W.R.

London-Leiden, which preserve a bilingual collection of shortdescriptions of plants and minerals.29Despite this bilingual flavour, themagical handbook belongs undoubtedly to the same priestly currentof botanical thought as the Demotic herbal from the Tebtunis tem-ple library.

Identification of the plant species is hardly possibleand greatly hindered by the lack of descriptions or explanatory glosses.Only in two cases the figurative name is provided with such a gloss.The first example is taken from the Snake Book; the second is from aNew Kingdom magical spell.‘Living-Flesh’ is the name of the\"ı ̄trw.tplant[Snake Book §90b=5/25]A ‘Hair-of-the-chin-of-Osiris’, which is called ‘twig’ by its name[P.

The two above given glosses might indicate that the figu-rative names were indeed not generally known, although both passagesare seemingly not concerned with keeping the glosses secret. What-ever the case, according to the introduction to the collection of medicalrecipes of P.

However, these substances are frequently calledfor as ingredients in medical or magical recipes of the pharaonic pe-riod.35In analogy with the PGM XII list, one might now be inclinedto interpret these ingredients likewise as code names for ordinary herbsor minerals, but there are no reasons to distrust a literal reading ofthose recipes and to assume an ingredient in disguise. First, none ofthese bodily items are connected with a god’s name as in ‘Semen ofHermes’ in the PGM XII list and, secondly, the animal substances seemto be practical and reasonable components for potions and unguentsin each case, irrespective of any scientifically proven medical effect.The following recipe from the snake book testifies unequivocally to theapplication of goat’s blood, since it prescribes to lead the goat back toits mother.Remedy against (the bite of) a female snake.Qebuplant,1/4;mixwith honey,1/4; blood of a young goat,1/8; he has to be taken alivewithout being slaughtered; beer,2hin; absorb; give freedom to the saidgoat (to let him return) to his mother; very good, (tested) a million times;it is used against any snake.[Snake Book §70=4/18–19]end of excursusIt has been said above that, in all probability, the PGM XII list drawsdirectly on Egyptian priestly knowledge instead of on the Mesopota-mian Uru-anna=maˇstakal. This conclusion follows not only from theEgyptian fauna mentioned in the list, but is also confirmed by the factthat the item ‘hairs of a baboon’ mentioned in line418of column Aoccurs already in the Snake Book, which is dated to the26thdynasty,about eight centuries earlier than PGM XII.36Another prescription that is made for a man who suffers from abite of whatever snake: ‘Hair-of-a-baboon’ plant1/8;cumin1/8;sA-wrresin1/64;honey1/8; sweet beer1/32; filter and to be swallowed by himwho suffers from the bite.[Snake Book §43a=3/1–2]35A helpful tool to study Egyptian drugs is H. von Deines and H.

This work, a five-book catalogue in Greek of about700plants and1000drugs employed in medicine, is the culmination ofa scientific trend, which started with Theophrastus’Inquiry into Plantsaround300BCE, that tried to classify the natural world by a strictappliance of rational and empirical methods.37The revision of the trea-tise, which was undertaken sometime at the end of the first century CE,consisted on the one hand of the alphabetisation of Dioscorides’ inge-nious arrangement of materials according to drug affinities and, on theother, the interpolation of long lists of synonyms that were excerptedfrom Pamphilus’ lexicographical workOn Botany.38Very little is knownof Pamphilus, a resident of Alexandria in the first century CE, whowrote a number of lexica of which not much more than the title ispreserved.39His workOn Botany, consisting of six books, was an alpha-betically arranged collection of plant names, each entry provided withsynonyms, descriptions of outer appearance, discussions of medicinalproperties, methods of application and folklore knowledge. The famousphysician Galen (129-ca.216CE) accused him of having written a bookon botany full of uncritical observations and fairytales without ever37TheOn the Materials of Medicineis published in Max Wellmann,Die Schrift desDioskuridesΠερ\t πλων \u000eαρμ\u0010κων:ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der Medizin3volumes (Berlin1914).

In fact, three pharaonic and seven PGMXII compound plant names recur in the revisedOn the Materials ofMedicineas synonyms that were in use among these circles. It will bedemonstrated with the help of administrative documents in section6.3.1that the category ‘prophets’ refers to the highest class of Egyp-tian priests, the so-called ‘god’s servants’, not in the least to Biblicalprophets. Given this specific professional designation and the corre-spondence of the plant names, it is justified to conclude that Pamphilus’synonyms reflect Egyptian priestly knowledge.

Instead, we must acknowledge that the list of PGM XIIopens up a textual field with an extensive geographical and historicalreach. It was certainly not idiosyncratic bogus confined to the Thebanhills, because at least parts of it were already known among Hellenisticscholars in Alexandria in the first century CE and, in all likelihood,through Pamphilus’On Botanyand the revised edition ofOn the Materialsof Medicinealso in other scholarly centres of the Roman world such asAthens, Rome, Ephesus and Antioch.The foregoing pages have provided an answer to the first of the fourquestions that were formulated in the introductory section, that is, tothe question ‘what is this text about?’ The text is a list of encodedand decoded names of plants, minerals and animal material similarto the Mesopotamian Uruanna=maˇstakal.

In the light of these Egyp-tian roots, the introduction to the list is actually a highly peculiar piece.On the one hand, it is indeed correct in its claiming to introduce a listof pharmacological jargon that was in use among Egyptian priests, but,on the other hand, its allegation that this jargon was inscribed on thestatues of gods is nonsense. The latter claim betrays that the author ofthese lines was either ill-informed himself as regards the origin of hisauthentic word list or that he wanted to address a reader who was onlypartly familiar with Egyptian priestly practice. Whatever the case, thetext exploits the idea that Egyptian priestly knowledge is highly valu-able and, simultaneously, evokes the idea that the narrator and readerdo not belong to the inner-circle of temple scribes, as I argued in theintroduction to this chapter. To gain an understanding of how Egyp-tian priests can function as prestigious marketing elements to promotemagical knowledge, the following section will study the Egyptian priest-hood’s duties and obligations in Egyptian society and its perception inthe imagination of the day.6.3.Temple scribes, prophets and the likeIn the introduction to the list of interpretations, the narrator ascribesthe idea of disguising the names of ritual ingredients to the ‘templescribes’ (9ερ\u0010γραμματε<ς), who, as he says, have devised the method todelude the curious and uninitiated masses. The somewhat bizarre com-pound plant names that were added posthumously to Dioscorides’Onthe Materials of Medicine, deriving from a lost botanical treatise by Pam-philus, are consistently regarded as jargon of the ‘prophets’ (πρ\u0010\u000f\u000eται),who figure as an autonomous category among linguistic groups, Greekbotanists and famous masters of the occult arts. In chapter5.2.2alonginvocation to the anonymous All-Lord was studied that contains as itsclimax a list of divine names (PGM XII.263–267). The list, which wasdiscussed in connection with the motif of ‘the Names of the Nations’,consists of five entries of which all but one are specifically ascribedto an ethnic or linguistic group, making it therefore comparable indesign to Pamphilus’ catalogue. In the case of this spell, the category‘high priests’ (6ρ\u001fιερε<ς) occurs next to the Egyptians, Jews, Greeks andParthians."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"204chapter sixIn each of these three sources, the priestly titles are treated as auton-omous categories of considerable prestige that are self-evident. Appar-ently, the sole occurrence of these titles was sufficienttoconvincethereadership of the day of the efficacy of the spell or wording given by thetext. In this respect, the titles are an essential part of the text’s rhetor-ical structure, aimed at silencing from the outset any possible criticalcomment on the reader’s part. This marketing strategy of investing thetext with overwhelming authority could only have been effective if thevalues attached to these titles were widely shared within the intendedgroup of readers. What were these values and to which culture groupdo these values appeal? It goes without saying that these complex ques-tions can only be answered after having established the precise mean-ing of the titles and their cultural origin. Fortunately, this is not a diffi-cult task and it can be made quite clear that the titles refer to specificranks within the Egyptian priesthood with the help of trilingual priestlydecrees that were set up in Egyptian temples during the Ptolemaicperiod. These decrees can only provide a description of the adminis-trative structure of the priestly institution in historical reality, so that,to know more about the values and judgements attached to the nativepriesthood, religious and literary sources have to be taken into accountas well. By studying these texts, the present section will answer the sec-ond question formulated in the introductory section: about whom isthis text speaking?This chapter consists of four separate sections. The first studies theEgyptian priestly titles as administrative categories so as to gain anunderstanding of the priestly hierarchy and the obligations pertainingto the titles. The next section focuses on the specific duties of Egyptianpriests in the temple as well as in their local community by way ofanalysing temple texts and steles that priests set up in the vicinity ofthe temple building. The information provided by these texts should beregarded as a conscious effort on the part of the priests to construean ideal and official image of priestly life for the outer world. Thesection is thus concerned with issues of priestly self-presentation. Theinner view or the way Egyptian priests imagined their own position andqualities can be studied with the help of Egyptian literary narratives, inwhich priests play a prominent role—the subject of the third section.The fourth section assesses the images of Egyptian priests in Greek andLatin literary texts of the Roman period to make out in what way thegoverning elite of the day perceived the Egyptian priesthood."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"of priests and prestige2056.3.1.Egyptian priestly titles as social classesThe Greek titles ‘temple scribe’, ‘prophet’ and ‘high priest’ can easilyand unambiguously be interpreted as Egyptian priestly titles that wereprecisely defined within the hierarchy of the native priesthood andcarried on a tradition of more than two millennia.43The priestly titlesmentioned in the magical texts can thus firmly be situated withinhistorical reality. The correspondence between the Egyptian and Greekform of the priestly titles can be studied at best with the help of thetrilingual decrees that were set up as steles in the main native templesby order of the Ptolemaic king to record decisions taken at priestlysynods convened by the king to discuss matters of cult and state.44Thedecrees were inscribed on a stone slab in a hieroglyphic, Demotic andGreek version, from top to bottom, uniting the language of religionand tradition, the vernacular and the language of the conqueror withinone frame. In all three versions, an elaborate dating formula and ahierarchical listing of the different classes of the Egyptian priesthoodprecedes the actual account of the decisions taken. The introduction43The priestly titles discussed in this section were in use from the Old Kingdomuntil the disappearance of the Egyptian temple religion in late antiquity. Informationabout the form and nature of priestly titles in the Old and Middle Kingdom can begained from the Abusir archive, a collection of administrative documents from the mor-tuary temple of king Neferirkare-Kakai (5thdynasty) and from administrative documen-tation found in the Middle Kingdom workman’s village of Lahun.

TheIdios Logoswas a department (or the title of itsmain functionary) in the administration of the Ptolemaic and RomanEmpire charged with supervision over the sale of government propertyas well as confiscated or abandoned private property.52It constitutedsome sort of parallel account of irregular income to the royal trea-sury: so to say, the private account of the king or emperor. Substantialparts of theGnomon of the Idios Logosare preserved in a document of thelate second century CE, which an anonymous scribe wrote as an aide-mémoire for an anonymous friend or colleague (BGU51210).53Theseregulations of Greek, Roman and Egyptian law make up a legal com-pendium of rules and jurisprudence concerning disputes between heirsover legacies, charges of ritual impropriety, and infractions against thelaws and ordinances regulating civil privileges.54Paragraphs71–97dealspecifically with the sale or inheritance ofpriestly positions, the require-ments for holding these ranks and some ritual and procedural infrac-tions that were liable to fines due to the treasury of theIdios Logos.55A study of these paragraphs reveals that the duties, requirements andrules of admission were narrowly defined to such an extent that, inthe Roman period, the native priestly class had factually become aclosed-offand marked-out community without civil duties in society.That this Roman policy of subordination and marginalisation was aor ‘intellectual’.

The position of prophetcould ideally only be transferred by inheritance (§§77–78), whereas therank ofstolisteswas sellable (§80). This means that some of the upperranks of the native priesthood were reserved for a small circle of can-didates: relatives and persons with a certain amount of wealth. Sincepriests of the Greek and Roman cults were not professionals, but afflu-ent laymen performing a tour of duty,61the organisation of the Egyp-tian priesthood contrasted sharply with the customs of the ruling elite,in particular with respect to its closed-offcharacter. A letter from Teb-tunis, written in162CE, indicates that membership of the priestly class,because of its financial benefits, was carefully monitored by the author-ities. The text is the official account of a judicial examination in whichthree priests of Soknebtunis had to give proof of their priestly status.Two persons handed over written proofs of priestly descent, while oneof them was even able to produce a document proving circumcision.The third candidate was handed over a divine book to show compe-tence in the Egyptian language and scripts (hieratic and Demotic).62Marsisouchos, son of Mar[sisouchos?], whose mother is Thenkebkis,has given proof of being proficient in the sacred ([9ε]ρατικ\t)andEgyp-tian (Α\u0003γ%πτια) scripts from a sacred book which the priestly scribes(9ερ\u0010γραμματε<ς) had given, in conformity with the memorandum of the12thof the month Tybi of the present second (regnal) year.[P.

First ofall, a Roman administrator, appointed by the prefect, held the functionof high priest, so that this previously highest priestly position hadbecome an extension of Roman bureaucracy. One of his tasks was tokeep tight control over the transference of priestly positions. In case ofconveyance or sale of these functions the parties had to show proofs of61Otto,Priester und Tempel im Hellenistischen Ägypten,133f.

On thecontrary, they were traditional elements of native priestly identity thathad already been in use during the pharaonic period. However, theyhad acquired a new meaning and usage in the eyes of the Romanadministration. Instead of elements of prestige they were turned intotools to mark out and subjugate the Egyptian priestly class.6.3.2.Egyptian priests as actors in cult and communityThe preceding section dealt with the position of Egyptian priests withinthe administration of the Ptolemaic and Roman period. The documen-tary sources concerned are silent about the active role Egyptian priestsplayed within their own circles or about the terms in which the priestsdefined their own position. The following two sections will survey theways in which the native priesthood presented itself in texts that werewritten and transmitted within its own circle. The present section willprimarily be concerned with texts that were part of the official tem-ple ideology. These texts could be termed ‘official’ as far as they wereinscribed in stone (temple wall, stele or statue) and written in ClassicalEgyptian in hieroglyphs. These texts were thus meant to be preservedand to create and confirm traditional Egyptian ideas, imagery and val-ues.First and foremost, Egyptian priests were ritual experts who conductedtheir rituals in the innermost chambers of the temple to ensure thepreservation of the cosmic order. According to Egyptian theology, pu-rity was of central concern to the effectiveness of any ritual.63SinceEgyptian state religion consisted mainly of a regular performance ofrituals and sacrifices, strictly scheduled by a festive calendar, to guaran-tee the vitality of the divine cosmic order, purity was of major impor-tance to the institution.64In Egyptian terms, purity could be definedas the physical and mental condition required to enter a sacred place,either a temple, tomb, palace or any spot where a ritual is conducted63See for a general discussion of the term and concept ‘purity’ in Egyptian culture:Dimitri Meeks, ‘Pureté et purification en Égypte’, in:Dictionnaire de la Bible, Supplément9(Paris1979)430–452.64See for a comprehensive description of Egyptian cult: Assmann,Ägypten.

Since the gods are the creators ofthe ordered cosmos, they are pure by definition and live onma\"at.Moreover, according to temple doctrine, each temple building standson the primeval mound on which creation was enacted; a pure placepar excellencethus. As a result, Egyptian temple architecture is mainly atranslation into stone of the anxiety for pollution: fortifications with asequence of entrance towers, in which the sacred shrine is enclosed onthree sides by a succession of defensive layers of chapels and ambulato-ries.67In the Late Period instruction text of Onkhsheshonqi it is put asbluntly as:Purity (w#b) is the essential element (rnn.t)ofatemple(.hw.t-n ̄tr)[P. BM.10.508 8/18]It goes without saying that those who were interacting with the divine,who were ritually enacting the perpetual cosmic battle against chaos,were required to be pure when entering the temple building. The gen-eral Egyptian term for priest presupposes this requirement from theoutset. The word for priest derives from the same root as the wordfor purity,w#b, meaning in this case ‘a pure one’, thus making clear65Thelocus classicusfor this definition is the victory stele of king Piye/Piankhi inwhich two Egyptian kings are forbidden entrance to the royal palace for not havingbeen circumcised and eating fish: ‘They could not enter the palace because they werenot circumcised and eat fish. King Nimlot, however, entered the palace because hewas a clean one (w#b) and did not eat fish. They stood (there) and (but) one enteredthe palace’ [lines150–153=Urk.I,50/16–51/1].

In the temple of Edfu, on the doorpost of a side entrance inthe eastern wall, through which priests entered the building to bringthe god offerings, a text is inscribed to remind the priests again of therequirement.Everybody who enters through this gate, beware of entering in impuritybecause god loves purity more than a million precious objects or hun-dred thousand gold pieces. His food isma\"at; he is satisfied with that. Hisheart is content with great purity.[Edfu VI:349/4–6]Ritual purity was regarded as a physical and moral state of beingthat could be attained by a combination of observing a number ofcommandments and abstaining from certain conduct.68To be allowedentrance to the holy shrine, the body had to be in a healthy condition,free from physical or mental illness or any form of pollution.69Priestswere therefore required to wash themselves in the temple lake beforeentering the temple and had to have all bodily hair removed. From theLate Period onwards, and maybe even earlier, circumcision was oblig-atory as well. Because the ritual in the temple consisted of presentingofferings and reciting hymns, hands and mouth had to be washed care-fully. Chewing on a piece of natron salt and spitting it out cleansedthe mouth. The route from the entrance gate to the innermost shrinewas characterised by a gradual increase in severity of the requirements.Thedeeperapriesthadtoenterthetemple,thelongerheshouldhaveabstained from sexual intercourse. Animal products were not allowedas material for clothing: sandals were made of papyrus while clotheshad to be made of white linen. The priestly diet was also subject tostrict rules. Each province, city, temple had its own food taboos thatfound their justification in a myth. Animals like fish and donkeys wereby and large forbidden to the priesthood, although local divergencesdid occur.70A text on a pillar in the pronaos of the temple of Esna,68See for a general overview: Sauneron,The Priests of Ancient Egypt,35–42.69The Egyptian views on circumcision and food taboos are discussed and comparedwith religious customs in ancient Israel in P.

However, the finallines go beyond a strict cultic interpretation by introducing the ideaof punishment and reward in terms of failure and success in life. Thisidea is central to the instruction texts, a corpus of texts belonging tothe generic category of rhetorical-didactic literature.75The main aimof the instruction texts is to teach its reader to lead a successful lifewithin his family and local community. It is therefore more concernedwith wisdom, knowledge about life and society, than with temple reli-gion, knowledge about the taboos. P. Insinger, an impressive Demoticmanuscript of35extant columns dating from the end of the Ptolemaicperiod76and originating from native priestly circles,77explicates this wis-dom discourse by building its arguments consistently upon the distinc-tion between the ‘man of knowledge’ (rm ̄tr ̆h) and the ‘man of stupidity’(rm ̄tswg,l ̆h, ̄hne).78The wise man is the one who is successful in life,whereas the fool fails because of his character. Main characteristic ofthe wise man is his reliance on god as a guide in life, so that he canalso be called the ‘godly man’ (rm ̄tn ̄tr) in opposition to the ‘impiousman’ (sAbA), shifting the emphasis from knowledge to piety. The follow-ing passage illustrates well the distinction between the two types andassigns a pivotal role to god as the judge of good and evil characters.God places the heart (.hA.ˆt) on the scales opposite the weight.He knows the infamous man (sAbA) from the godly man (rm ̄tn ̄tr)becauseof his (their) heart.Curse and blessing are in the character (Amy.t) that was given to him.The commandments that god ordained for those who are good are (tobe found) in the character.[P.

Instead of being private accounts of an indi-vidual’s life, the majority of the texts present a collection of fixed topicslike prayers for offerings, an address to the living to exhort them to giveofferings, and an enumeration of the virtues of the deceased, made upof stock phrases that are part of a longstanding native funerary and lit-erary tradition.

Concerning the formal requirements, Derchain-Urtel identi-fies the following recurring topics:811.Purity2. Rectitude in performing priestly duties3. Denial of theft from offerings4. Righteousness (social solidarity)5. Proper speechAccordingly, these five points can be considered the main constituentsof priestly self-presentation in the Late and Greco-Roman period.82Each of the five topics was already common in earlier periods, albeitless pronounced, but the underlying morality of Late Period biogra-phies stresses human responsibility and accountability as never before.Much stress is laid on one’s individual achievements in such a waythat personal responsibility and accountability are suitable key-termsto describe its discourse. The royal institution has almost completelydisappeared from these accounts. Instead, the deceased presents him-self as a capable leader of his local community on whose initiative allkinds of works were undertaken. The deceased even takes all the creditfor having built or renovated temple structures, which earlier formedpart of the cultic role of the pharaoh. The city god has also replacedpharaoh as the point of reference in life. The biographies emphasisethe deceased’s piety and propagate, often in digressions of a generalmoral nature, the reliance on god as guide in life, as in the instructiontexts. In this way, the deceased portrays himself as a wise man, suc-cessful in life and knowledgeable in rhetorical-didactic literary forms(proper speech), and, ultimately, as a godly man, whose success in life isentirely dependent upon his piety and respect for his city god. In thisway, self-presentation and didactic literature collide, both propagatingthe idea that social cohesion within the community is ultimately alsoabout god.81Derchain-Urtel,Priester im Tempel,198.82See also Stele Manchester Museum noinv.2965, dated to the Saite period,in which this sequence occurs already.

In such a setting,priests could function as intermediaries between temple and laity bymeans of their mastery of traditional idiom and knowledge of scriptsand language. As a result of this, the local community could very wellaccredit them with a prestige or charisma that went beyond a strictinterpretation of their priestly duties within the temple hierarchy. More-over, their distinctive physical appearance and way of life made theminto models of divine contiguity and reciprocity. They could thereforeserve as ritual experts with considerable prestige.83Local needs wereprimarily concerned with issues of daily life such as fertility, childbirth,protective amulets, blessings and curses, and charms against demonsand sorcerers. All sorts of forms of applied magic that testify to theseactivities have been found in abundant numbers. Unfortunately, thescattered sources do not allow a precise identification of the priests whotook on this role. Moreover, it remains unclear through which chan-nels and in what way the magical lore of the temple reached the worldoutside thetemenoswall. Some information can be gleaned from theconcluding words on the healing statue of the priest Djed-Hor fromAthribis.84Healing statues portray the private individual who commis-sioned the statue and are covered with magical spells against bites andstings of venomous animals. They provided a means for the uniniti-ated and illiterate to share in the magical knowledge of the priests,because drinking the water that had been poured over the statue wasbelieved to cure poisonous bites and stings.85The priest (.hm) Wah-ib-Re83See for a similar sociological model: Frankfurter,Religion in Roman Egypt,210–214.However, Frankfurter is far too positive in assigning these roles to the priestly office oflector priest. The ancient sources provide a much more complex and even conflictingpicture.84For this statue, see, E.

Two of the six titlesmentioned in the trilingual decrees qualify. The lector priests, knownin the trilingual decrees as ‘scribes of the divine book’ (in Egyptian)and ‘feather bearers’ (in Greek), played in all likelihood a major role inthe transfer and translation of temple knowledge, because they were incharge of the ritual texts used in the cult. During public religious fes-tivals and funerals they displayed their knowledge of ritual languageand acts in front of the laity, possibly with the result that the localcommunity recognized them as masters of the occult arts. Since theHouse-of-Life, the institutionalised cultic library in service to the tem-ple, functioned as archive of magical and medical texts, its members,the ‘scribes of the House-of-Life’ (in Egyptian) or ‘temple scribes’ (inGreek), may also have acted as providers of charms and amulets to thelay public. It is therefore noteworthy that the introduction to the list ofbizarre ingredients (PGM XII.401–444) pretends that it makes availableinformation of exactly this class of priests.8786This is a tentative translation of the technical term\"ınj-r. See on book titles withthis term: Siegfried Schott,Bücher und Bibliotheken im Alten Ägypten. Verzeichnis der Buch- undSpruchtitel und der Termini technici(Wiesbaden1990)13[nr.25].87Egyptian sources from the pharaonic until the Late Period indicate that theHouse-of-Life knew a more refined disciplinary division than the term ‘scribe of theHouse-of-Life’ suggests. In the case of medicine, at least three different classes with adistinctive hierarchy were recognized:swnwpriests, ̆hrppriests of the goddess Serketandw#bpriests of the goddess Sekhmet.

In both traditions, the Egyptian priestwas a favoured literary type that acts according to a limited numberof generic conventions. These images should be understood as ver-bal representations, a way of speaking about, or referring to, Egyp-tian priests. As such, they are not directly related to reality, but medi-ated by an author, who passes a judgement on reality or, in the caseof fictional narratives, creates a new (textual) reality altogether. It istherefore inevitable that societal interests, prejudices and power rela-tions of the author or the group he represents influence the form andcontent of the representation. In the case of Egyptian literary works, itis highly probable that literary production and reception was more orless confined to priestly circles, so that these texts in all likelihood pro-vide information about the way Egyptian priests viewed themselves.88The Greek and Latin texts were produced outside Egypt for an audi-ence that was only aware of the country along the banks of the Nile byway of hearsay, imperial propaganda and classical literary and histori-ographical texts such as Homer’sIliadandOdysseyand Herodotus’His-tories. In the Roman period texts, Egyptian priests tend to be portrayedas outsiders who are feared or revered for their outstanding knowledgeof ritual texts, which tension betrays a pervasive Hellenistic debate ondefining self and otherness.Fo r t h eswnwpriests, see, John F. Nunn,Ancient Egyptian Medicine(London1996)113–135,take notice of appendix B on pp.211–214for a chronological listing of known doctors.See also Westendorf,Handbuch der altägyptischen Medizin,vol.1,472–481and JoachimF.

In rhetorical-didactic texts, Egyptian priests function as sages who, on account oftheir knowledge of religious texts and rhetorical forms, act as guardiansof morality and just speech.89The priest functions as an embedded nar-rator who instructs a pupil in proper rules of conduct or converses withhis heart or pharaoh about the state of affairs in Egypt.90In this way,the priest remains outside the story told and his textual role is restrictedto rendering the message of the embedded text trustworthy, author-itative and prestigious for its audience by means of his priestly title.In fictional narratives, Egyptian priests act as miracle workers who areconcerned with solving their own particular problems or satisfying theircuriosity for magical texts, thereby frequently trespassing ideal rules ofconduct. An external narrator recounts the course of events that areundergone and influenced by the priestly character. These stories couldconveniently be called ‘Tales of Wonder’, because of the high num-ber of episodes entailing magical tricks and miraculous objects.91Bothtextual categories are attested for the early as well as later phases ofancient Egyptian history. The extant record of tales, however, suggests afair increase in popularity of the ritual expert type in the Greco-Romanperiod.89For the term rhetorical-didactic literature, see, Moers,Fingierte Welten in der ägyp-tischen Literatur des2.

Three stories have been selected as instructive examplesfor their relative length, detailed descriptions and fairly well preservedstate:Tale of King Khufu’s Court,Setne and the Book of Thoth(Setne1),Setneand Sa-Osiris(Setne2). Before treating each story in more detail, thefollowing tenets as regards the literary construct of the ritual expert canbe listed:1. The figures are related to the Egyptian priesthood.2. The royal court is the arena of display and conflict.3. Magic is not condemned on moral grounds.4. Egyptian ritual experts are decent members of society.5. The priest’s knowledge is based on the consultation of books.6.Effective magical texts are written by the god Thoth.7. Books written in Thoth’s own hand are carefully kept from mor-tals.8. Powerful ritual experts are of the past.9. The described magical techniques are also prescribed and ex-plained in extant contemporary magic handbooks.TheTale of King Khufu’s Courtis a cycle of wondrous stories partlypreserved on a manuscript from the late Second Intermediate Period(around1640–1532BCE).92King Khufu’s sons take turns telling theirfather of some miraculous feat done in the past. Each story evolvesaround a figure that holds the title ‘chief lector priest’ ( ̄hry-.hb.hry-tp),perhaps better translated in this context as ‘magician’. One of them,Ubainer, made a crocodile out of wax to seize the man who seduced hiswife,93while another, Djadjaemankh (who is also ‘scribe of the book’),put one side of a lake on top of the other to retrieve a fish-pendant thatone of the king’s rowing girls had dropped into the water. After eachembedded story, king Khufu orders to give copious funerary offeringsto the deceased ritual expert, because ‘I have seen his deed of wisdom(sp--fnr ̆h)’ (P. Westcar1/16,4/16–7and6/21).

Djedi’s mastery of script and language and his connection withThoth make him a prototypical Egyptian intellectual.98Apparently, anEgyptian audience considered these the constitutive elements of a per-son knowledgeable in the occult arts.For the Late and Greco-Roman Period, the number of preserved narra-tives featuring ritual experts increases considerably, possibly indicatinga rise in popularity of this literary type among the audience of Egyp-tian narratives. Like all the fictional narratives composed in this laterperiod, the stories are set in a glorious past when Egypt was still tra-ditionally ruled by an indigenous pharaoh. The scattered sources allowidentifying two favoured historical and priestly settings for the eventsto take place: the high priests of Ptah in Memphis around the time ofpharaonique(Paris1995)113f. According to the introductions or postscripts to these spells,Hordedef made his discoveries in the course of an inspection of the temples in thecountry. In the Greco-Roman period he was accredited with having discovered theBook of the Temple: J.F.

In fact,110yearswas considered in ancient Egypt to be the ideal life span reserved for righteous persons.These110years make Djedi a member of a generation of a bygone age. In this respect,it may not be coincidental that the bread, ox and beer are reminiscent of commonfunerary offerings. In other words, Djedi is a figure of the past although still alive. Notethat the same holds true for Sa-Osiris, the main character inSetne and Sa-Osiris(Setne2).97Djed-Sneferu was the priestly settlement attached to king Snefru’s pyramid inMeidum.

The fictional characterSetne Khamwase was based on the historical prince Khaemwaset, wholived in the thirteenth century BCE as fourth son of pharaoh RamessesII the Great and served as high priest of Ptah in Memphis.103His fatherreigned for about66years, built or renovated dozens of temples andclaimed as many military successes, which were lavishly laid out intext and relief on the outside walls of the major temples of Egypt. Atthe time of his death, Ramesses left Egypt scattered with statues andmonumental texts glorifying his name and deeds, which guaranteed hisendurance in Egypt’s collective memory.104Like his father, Khaemwasetremained in the minds of the literate elite. He was not remembered as aconqueror and powerful ruler, but as a scholar and collector of ancienttexts on account of his activities as high priest of Ptah in the Mem-phite area. First, he ordered the construction of an underground burialcomplex for the Apis bulls in the Saqqara desert, nowadays knownas the Serapeum, which complex remained in use until the Romanperiod. Secondly, in his name renovation works were undertaken at themillennium-old pyramid complexes of the pharaohs of the Old King-dom that were located in the vicinity of Memphis. Both activities werecommemorated in monumental texts that remained clearly visible forthe generations to come.105As a result, he entered the imagination as asage and scholarly priest anxious for old texts of sacred knowledge.

In exchange fora fee amounting to the costs of a proper burial, the old priest gaveaway that the book was hidden on an island in the vicinity of Cop-tos, whereupon Naneferkaptah decided to travel with his wife Ihweretand newly born son Merib from Memphis to southern Coptos to takepossession of the book. In Coptos, the priests of Isis welcomed themwarmly and took care of them. After the prerequisite offerings to Isisand Harpocrates and four days of feasting with the priests, Nanefer-kaptah made a boat and its crew out of wax to set offto the islandwhere the book was kept. On the island, the book was defended bythe pre-eminent chthonic enemies: a six mile barrier of snakes, scorpi-ons and worms, and an ever living serpent coiled around the box inwhich the book was kept. Naneferkaptah overcame the defences of thebook by the use of his magical tricks.108On the way back to Memphis,however, the god Thoth punished him severely for his intrusion.

The tale’s message is that Books of Thoth are not meantto be readings for mortals. The division between the divine and humanspheres should be respected and maintained. This division is clearlyspecified in the distribution of space in both the primary and secondaryfabula. The divine sphere is located on the island in the Theban region(line4/19) and in the tomb of Naneferkaptah in the desert to the westof Memphis, whereas the royal court in Memphis represents the humansphere.

Whenever mortals take the bookout of its secluded context into the world of the living, they call downinterference from the world of the gods or deceased upon themselves.Only by restoring the dichotomy between human and divine spheres,the tale can come to a happy ending.Both the external narrator and the embedded narrator Ihweret pres-ent their story from a Memphite perspective.

Unlike Djedi, who isalso aware of a book kept in a flint box in the temple of Heliopolisbut does not collect it, Naneferkaptah does not respect the set bordersbetween the human and the divine. Djedi makes use of his books toperform magical feats at pharaoh Khufu’s court, while Setne draws onhis magic books to save himself from Naneferkaptah’s attacks in theSenetgame episode. This means that the possession and consultationof magic books was not considered forbidden as such. Naneferkaptahand Setne are punished because they breach a religious law and actcontrary to the ideal rules of conduct set out in rhetorical-didactictexts, which have been discussed in the previous section.112However,the Book of Thoth is not a recipe book for a variety of apotropaeic andhealing rites, but rather reminiscent of mortuary literature.113Mortuarytexts were placed in the deceased’s tomb to enable him or her, havingbecome god-like after the glorification rites,114to participate in themysteries of the daily journey of the sun barge through the sky and thenetherworld.115The funerary character of the Book of Thoth is borneout first by the way it is defended against mortals on the island and,second, by its content. The episode in which Naneferkaptah finds thebook on the island is full of funerary imagery.He not only found a span of six miles of serpents, scorpions and wormsaround the place in which the book was, he also found an ever-livingserpent around the said chest (tby.t116). (... he defeats the animals; jd ...)Naneferkaptah went to the place where the chest was [and found that112The behaviour of Naneferkaptah and Setne is reminiscent of the portrayal of thefool (swg,lg) in contemporary Demotic instruction texts. They do not listen to advice, donot respect hierarchy and act on impulse. In his relationship to Tabubu, the followingmaxim is well applicable to Setne: ‘The [fool] brings danger to his life because of hisphallus’ [P. Insinger8/1]. The tale held thus a moral lesson for its audience.113Ritner interprets the Book of Thoth likewise as a collection of funerary spells:Ritner,The Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice,63f. Ritner refers toBook of theDeadspells133–134as instructive parallels to the fictive spells of the tale. However, theseBook of the Deadspells prescribe ritual manipulation of objects and images unlike thefictive spells. The fictive spells are less about ritual as about knowledge.114See on these rites: Jan Assmann,Tod und Jenseits im Alten Ägypten(Munich2001)321ff.115See for an overview of the texts: Erik Hornung,The Ancient Egyptian Books ofthe Afterlife(Ithaca, London1999)26ff.[translationfrom:Altägyptische Jenseitsbücher.

Cairo30646 3/30–35]To an Egyptian audience the image of the island may have evokedan association with Osiris’ tomb that was located on an island.117Theprotective ever-living serpent is reminiscent of the Ouroboros snake,which played in different functions, and under different names, animportant role in mortuary texts and was occasionally depicted alongthe rim of royal sarcophagi.118Theseriesofchestscorrespondswithaburial assemblage of several sarcophagi.119The Book of Thoth is not used as a recipe book for magical rites, buttreated as a container of knowledge. The characters read the text aloudand share its contents with others (lines3/40and4/38). Naneferkaptaheven incorporates its contents literally by way of drinking the waterin which the ink of the freshly written spells has been dissolved (lines4/3–4).120This stress on knowledge is highly reminiscent of mortuaryliterature, which operated on the basis that knowledge of the workingsof nature enabled participation in the cosmic cycle of death and rebirth.The opening of theBook of the hidden Room(Amduat) explicates thisnotion clearly.121To k n o w t h e s o u l s (bA.w) of the netherworld,To k n o w t h e s e c r e t s o u l s ,To know the gates and the roads on which the greatest god goes,To k n o w w h a t i s d o n e,To know what is in the hours together with their gods,To know the course of the hours together with their gods,ToknowtheirglorificationsforRe,To know what he says to them,To know the honoured ones and the damned ones[Amduat, title, ll.3–8]117Hans Bonnet,Reallexikon der ägyptischen Religionsgeschichte(Berlin1952)576a–77a.118L.

The latter two verbs (‘to discover’ and ‘to see’)describe a moment of recognition and insight, a personal experience.The first verb is translated as ‘to charm’, but means actually somethinglike ‘to have ritual control over an object so as to make it work prop-erly’.122The two spells thus allow the practitioner to have control overthe cosmos and to witness the mystery of the travels of the divine heav-enly bodies.

An external narrator relates that Sa-Osiris was conceived after Setne’s wife Mehsehet had received divinedirections, possibly from Imhotep, in an incubation dream.125The boy122Ritner,The Mechanics of Egyptian Magical Practice,57–67.123The translation is tentative; Schott,Die Schrift der verborgenen Kammer,348–350.124Erik Hornung,Das Amduat.

After an episode in which Sa-Osiris guides his father through thenetherworld to show him the fate of men after the divine judgement,the tale shifts to the court of pharaoh Ramsesses II in Memphis wherea Nubian chieftain is challenging the Egyptian court to read a sealedletter without opening it.126In case no Egyptian will be able to performthe feat, he threatens to bring the shame of Egypt back to Nubia. Sa-Osiris saves his father Setne, who is assigned the task but does notknow how to carry it out, by reading out loud the unopened letter. Asembedded narrator, Sa-Osiris tells the story of a magic contest betweenNubia and Egypt in the bygone days of pharaoh Menkh-Pre-Siamun.127A Nubian king started the contest as he allowed one of his chieftains(Ate) to execute his evil plans against Egypt. The chief, Horus-son-of-the-Nubian-woman, modelled a bier and four bearers out of wax and,after having recited a magical spell, sent them offto Egypt in order tocollect pharaoh and beat him with500blows of the stick in front of theNubian ruler. The morning after, the beaten and frightened pharaoh,meanwhile returned to his own palace, asked his ritual expert (.hry-tp) Horus-son-of-Paneshe to find a remedy against these attacks. Theritual expert went to the temple of Thoth in Hermopolis and was toldby Thoth in a dream about a magical handbook for amulets writtenby the god himself hidden in the library of the temple. The followingevening the amulets proved able to ward offthe Nubian threats, whilethe Egyptian ritual expert inflicted identical punishment on the Nubianruler for the next three days.

The Nubian chieftain set fire in court, cloudedthe sky over and placed a great vault of stone above pharaoh andhis court, but Horus-son-of-Paneshe undid each trick. In the end, themother of the Nubian chieftain came flying from Nubia to her son’said to no avail. When a fowler was about to kill her and her sonwho had assumed the form of a goose and a gander, she asked formercy and promised not to return to Egypt for1500years. When Sa-Osiris finishes reading the letter, he explains that the1500years havepassed and that the Nubian letter carrier is nobody else but Horus-son-of-the-Nubian-woman who has come back to Egypt for revenge.Thereupon Sa-Osiris reveals that he is actually Horus-son-of-Paneshehaving returned to earth to counter the Nubian sorcerer. He slays theNubian with fire and vanishes while leaving Setne and the court at aloss.InSetne and Sa-Osiris, magic from an unfamiliar environment poses athreat to the stable social community at the royal court in Memphisas in the first tale of Setne. In this case, the threat is not the result ofan infraction of a religious rule but of a foreign intruder with mali-cious intent. The god Thoth acts therefore not as an antagonist butas a helper who willingly shares his magical spells with the Egyptianprotagonist. For an Egyptian audience, Nubia was a credible aggres-sor, since the Nubian kingdom of Meroe was a continuous menaceto the territory of Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt in historical reality.128Moreover, Nubia was traditionally considered one of the nine tradi-tional foes in Egyptian religion.129Thetaleisthusnotonlyanexcitingstory about two contesting magicians in a distant yet glorious past, butcan also be read as an attempt to confirm Egypt’s territorial integrityand cultural superiority vis-à-vis an intruding foreign power in a fic-tive setting that bears on a historical and ideological reality. In thelight of contemporary Greco-Roman hegemony, this subtext plausiblyaddressed pertinent political questions of the day for a native audi-ence.130The magical tricks and the glorious past should therefore not128Josef Locher, ‘Die Anfänge der römischen Herrschaft in Nubien und der Konfliktzwischen Rom und Meroe’Ancient Society32(2002)73–133.129For the image of Nubia in pharaonic and Greco-Roman Egypt, see, chapter4.4.4.130A similar idea is expressed in Richard Gordon, ‘Reporting the Marvellous: PrivateDivination in theGreek Magical Papyri’, in: Peter Schäfer and Hans G.

Forthe author and his audience magic was not a silly and improper cate-gory, but a means to compel admiration and respect: magic as nationalpride. This notion is plainly present in the following passage, whichis included in the embedded story to raise tension about the outcomeof the impending encounter between the Nubian and Egyptian magi-cian. At the same time, it resonates with the nationalistic discourse.The chieftain’s mother warns her son for the power of Egyptian magicbefore he embarks on his trip to Egypt.If you go down to Egypt to do sorcery there, guard yourself against thepeople of Egypt. You will not be able to fight (t\"ı\"ırm) with them. Do notget caught in their hands (?), lest you cannot retreat to the land of Nubiaever.[P. BM.10.822 6/1–2]131In both the primary and secondary fabula, the Egyptian hero (Sa-Osirisand Horus-son-of-Paneshe) is called a ‘good scribe and wise man’ (s ̄hnfrrm ̄tr ̆h), a man of high moral and intellectual standing. The wordingof this idiomatic expression is notably reminiscent of the ethical dis-course in the priestly self-presentation that was discussed in the fore-going section. The Egyptian hero is thus a character similar to theimage that the contemporary priestly audience of the tale propagatedin biographies and temple texts. The occurrence of the expressionin the following passage is highly instructive as regards the valorisa-tion of magical knowledge among the native priesthood. Horus-son-of-Paneshe explains to pharaoh’s court why he came back as Sa-Osiris toEgypt after1500years.When I found out in the Netherworld that the Nubian fiend (sAb#An\"Igˇs)was going to cast his sorceries (.hy.k.w) here, while there was not a goodscribe and wise man (s ̄hnfrrm ̄tr ̆h) in Egypt at this time who would beable to contend with him, I begged Osiris in the Netherworld to let mecome up again, so as to prevent him from taking the shame of Egypt tothe land of Nubia.[P. BM.10822 6/35–7/1]132The passage brings two important points to the fore. First of all, theNubian magician is defined as an aggressor, whereas the Egyptianmagician acts as a ‘good scribe and wise man’. This implies that knowl-edge of magic is not condemned in itself: the criterion is the goal75;Leiden1997)65–92,76.131Translation modified from M. Lichtheim.132Tr. M. Lichtheim."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"238chapter sixtowards which the knowledge is applied. Because the Nubian sorcereruses his knowledge in an attempt to subvert pharaonic rule, he actsas the villain in the story. His Egyptian opponent is a man of god,highly educated in the temple writings, who, by virtue of his way of life,acquires apotropaeic magical spells from the god Thoth. In this way,the contest is elevated to the level of a battle, in Egyptian theologicalterms, between good and evil or order and chaos. Egypt’s answer tochaotic upheaval within the ordered community of men and gods is apriest who sticks strictly to the religious taboos and moral rules. Thesecond point of importance is the fact that no good scribe and wiseman was available in the days of Ramesses II. The same expression isused inSetne and the Book of Thothfor Naneferkaptah, who is likewisea skilful magician from a distant past. Both tales express thus the ideathat highly skilled ritual experts belong to the past. Could this be inter-preted as a reflection of a pessimistic view on contemporary society?The foregoing pages have demonstrated that magic and miracle work-ers were favoured topics in Egyptian fictional narratives. The priest-ly morality as set forth in the ‘official’ temple texts, biographies andinstruction texts governs the stories’ plot and its outcome to a largedegree. The characters are portrayed as well educated priests, whoseengagement with books and ritual texts is repeatedly emphasised. Theirknowledge of magic is not rejected on moral grounds, neither by anarrator, nor a character within the story. On the contrary, magic isperceived as a category that bestows prestige on the person who isknowledgeable about it. In the case of the taleSetne and Sa-Osiris, magicoperates even as a category to construct a national priestly identity inresponse to foreign intrusion. The god Thoth plays a prominent roleas the provider of effective magical texts. However, his texts are notself-evidently available to humans: Thoth will only share his texts withrighteous priests who will make use of the knowledge to come to the aidof pharaoh or the country. Djedi’s reluctance to collect the flint casketin the temple of Heliopolis and the punishment of Naneferkaptah andSetne demonstrate that sheer curiosity for secret knowledge was consid-ered inappropriate.

This image consists of a number of stereotypes on Egypt, itsreligion and its priests. The arrangement of these stereotypes or, soto say, the structure of the representation, is governed by a dominantHellenistic perspective that observes from without phenomena that areactually specific for, and only meaningful within, an Egyptian context,without giving voice to the subordinate Egyptian object itself. Conse-quently, images of Egyptian priests in Hellenistic texts reveal a Hel-lenistic debate on defining self and otherness. Depending upon therules of the genre, the author’s intention, and his religious or philo-sophical inclinations, the image was positively or negatively coloured:either the Egyptian priest was represented as a philosopher who hadacquired close contact with the divine by renouncing earthly pleasuresor he was constructed as a wandering fraudulent wizard who deceivedhis credulous clientele willing to pay for healings and contact with thedivine. This distinction lays bare a fundamental trait of the Roman-period preoccupation with Egypt in Hellenistic elite circles: the oscilla-tion between the opposing attitudes ‘fascination’ and ‘rejection’.135The133Tr. : M .

A certain Thelyphron relates theembedded story to Lucius, the main character of theMetamorphoses,during a supper with some notables of the city of Hypata in Thessaly,‘the native land of those spells of the magic art which are unanimouslypraised throughout the entire world’ (2.1). He tells the story of a youngwidow in Thessalian Larissa who poisoned her husband to inherit hiswealth and to share her bed with her new lover. To find out the truth,the deceased’s father called for an Egyptian priest, a certain Zatchlas,to raise his son briefly from the dead.Consequently the old man spoke up again. ‘Let us put the judgementof the truth,’ he said, ‘into the hands of divine Providence. There isa man here named Zatchlas, an Egyptian prophet of the first rank(Aegyptius propheta primarius), who has already contracted with me for agreat price to bring my nephew’s spirit back from the dead for a brieftime and reanimate his body as it was before his death.’ At this point heThe Egyptian Revival: a Recurring Theme in the History of Taste(2nded.; Manchester1994)1–56.

One of theconversation partners, Tychiades, is sceptical about the existence ofthese phenomena, so that the others try to convince him by tellingfanciful stories that they believe occurred in reality. In this passage,Eucrates tells Tychiades about his encounter with the priest Pancratesin Egypt. This same priest appears to be the teacher of Arignotus,another member of the conversation.‘When I was living in Egypt during my youth (my father had sentme travelling for the purpose of completing my education), I took itinto my head to sail up to Coptos and go from there to the statue ofMemnon in order to hear it sound that marvellous salutation to therising sun.

But on the voyage up, there chanced to be sailing withus a man from Memphis, one of the scribes of the temple (6ν:ρ τ3ν9ερ3ν γραμματ&ων), wonderfully learned, familiar with all the cultureof the Egyptians. He was said to have lived underground for twenty-three years in their sanctuaries, learning magic from Isis.’ ‘You meanPancrates,’ said Arignotus, ‘my own teacher, a holy man (=νδρα 9ερ\u001aν),clean shaven, in white linen, always deep in thought, speaking imperfectGreek, tall, flat-nosed, with protruding lips and thinnish legs.’ ‘Thatself-same Pancrates,’ he replied: ‘and at first I did not know who hewas, but when I saw him working all sorts of wonders whenever weanchored the boat, particularly riding on crocodiles and swimming incompany with the beasts, while they fawned and wagged their tails, Irecognised that he was some holy man (9ερ\u001aν τινα =ν\u001eρωπ\u0010ν), and by138Tr.

The features, bywhich the audience would have immediately recognised the literarytype, are the priestly titles and the description of their outward appear-ance. Zatchlas is a ‘prophet’, which, as has already been shown, is aGreek translation of the Egyptian title ‘god’s servant’ (.hm-n ̄tr), whilePancrates is a ‘scribe of the temple’, holding the same title as the oneused in the introduction to the list of ingredients (PGM XII.401–444),which is the Greek rendering of the title ‘scribe of the House-of-Life(s ̄hPr-#n ̆h). The description of their outward appearance is limited tothe most conspicuous elements of the Egyptian priestly attire: bald-headed, white linen clothing and, in the case of Zatchlas, sandals ofpalm leaves.142In these two passages, both priests function as wizards who are ableto perform extraordinary magical feats because of their acquaintancewith the divine. Zatchlas is represented as an object of divine con-tiguity by the wording of the old man’s prayer, which is merely aninstance of name-dropping that is supposed to convey the old man’sintimate knowledge of the mysteries of Egyptian religion. The list showsthat the image of Egypt as land of mysteries and miracles could beinvoked for a Hellenistic audience by a limited number of stereotypesconcerning cosmography, Egyptian topography and religious phenom-139Tr. A.M.

The rather arbitrary association between topography and religiousphenomenon, itemized in the table below, demonstrates the metonymiccharacter of each individual term.

His mockery could hardly have been successful if theimages he ridicules were not widely shared and immediately recognisedby the readership of the day. The stereotypic motives he makes use ofare the following:1. Memphis as home of the magician.2. The Egyptian temple as a place of learning and initiation.3. Isis as mistress of magic.4. The Egyptian priest as holder of secret knowledge.The ironic and singular part of the representation is the exaggeratedlength (23years) and place of initiation (in an underground structure)and Pancrates’ application of his arcane knowledge towards riding oncrocodiles and turning a door bar, broom or pestle into a house servant(Philopseudes,35).Two further elements of Lucian’s description deserve particular at-tention. First, by mentioning Pancrates’ imperfect command of Greek,the priest is firmly placed outside the social group of the author andhis audience whose common identity is based to a large degree on theirknowledge of Greek language and culture. Pancrates is an alien in theGreek language as Zatchlas is an alien in a Greek region. Both repre-sentations touch thus upon the Hellenistic debate on otherness. A dis-course that reveals a tension between the desire for magical feats, occultknowledge, and initiations situated outside one’s one culture group onthe one hand, and the prohibition to transgress fixed social and culturalborders on the other. Second, Eucrates calls Pancrates a ‘holy man’indicating that he attaches much value to the priest’s knowledge andmorality. Lucian introduces the term ‘holy man’ into the text to takeposition in the debate about magic and miracles, which was lively dis-cussed among Hellenistic authors of the Roman period. The centralissue of this debate was the question whether persons who performedmagical feats or pretended to be able to do so were frauds or genuinesages and miracle workers touched by the divine. It goes without say-ing that this debate cannot be disconnected from the Roman-perioddiscourse on otherness. Lucian’s use of the term ‘holy man’ is highlyambivalent in this particular context. Within Eucrates’ and Arignotus’embedded focalisation the term is positively connoted, reflecting theirbelief in, and reverence for, Oriental wisdom, but within the context ofthe complete dialogue Eucrates’ tale stands out as an outrageous story"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"of priests and prestige245unworthy of any credibility. From the author’s perspective, the termbecomes thus synonymous with false pretence, a crucial term denoting,but also proving, Eucrates’ and Arignotus’ credulity.Lucian ridicules another type of miracle worker in the figure of Arig-notus, who shortly interrupted Eucrates’ story, to inform the conver-sation partners of the fact that the Egyptian priest was actually histeacher. This type is a key figure to understand Roman-period ideason magicians. The sceptical Tychiades describes him in the followingwords at the moment that Arignotus joined the conversation, a fewminutes before Eucrates started telling his story.At this juncture Arignotus the Pythagorean came in, the man with thelong hair and the majestic face—you know the one who is renowned forwisdom (τ\r\u000e σ\u0010\u000f\u0014Cα), who is called the holy (man) (τ7ν 9ερ\u001aν). As I caughtsight of him, I drew a breath of relief thinking that this one came to meas an axe against (their) lies. ‘For,’ I said, ‘the wise man (I σ\u0010\u000f7ς 6ν#ρ)will put a stop to them telling such prodigious yarns.’ As the saying is,like adeus ex machinaI considered him to be brought in to me by Fortune(Τ%\u001fης).[Lucian,Philopseudes,29]144Arignotus is represented as a philosopher of the Pythagorean School,recognisable by his long hair, a symbol of reason and wisdom. Tychi-ades hopes that the presence of a man of learning will bring some rea-son and sense to the discussion. However, these expectations appear tobe illusory as soon as Arignotus takes an active part in the conversation,because he tells that he once expelled a spirit from a house by use ofspells in the Egyptian language from his Egyptian books (Philopseudes,31) and confesses to be one of Pancrates’ students. The elements ofwisdom, study in Egypt, and occult knowledge would have evoked fora Hellenistic audience a familiar type. The well-known author andrhetorician Apuleius of Madaura, or shadowy figures known for theircompilations of occult lore such as Bolos of Mendes, Anaxilaus ofLarissa, and Nigidius Figulus, or a fictional character like Thessalosof Tralles fall within this category.145The constitutive elements of thistype are the following:144Translation modified from A.M. Harmon.145Dickey has coined the term ‘learned magician’ for this category, which inappro-priately foregrounds the element of ‘magic’ over learnedness or curiosity (for the work-ings of nature); M.W.

Hellenistic identity: The identity is based on a set of shared Hel-lenistic cultural forms; the persons are not necessarily ethnicallyGreek or Roman. From a Hellenistic perspective, such a personis hence culturally not a foreigner or outsider. He is knowledge-able in general Hellenistic cultural forms and expresses himself ina Hellenistic idiom.2. Philosophy: Adherent of Neopythagorean or Platonic move-ment.1463. Initiation: Knowledge is taught by a sage, in most cases an Egyp-tian priest. It was a persistent Greco-Roman conception that eso-teric knowledge could only be acquired by travelling to foreignreligious masters, as there were the Persian Magoi, the IndianBrahmans, the Babylonian Chaldaeans or, particularly popular inthe Roman period, Egyptian priests. The tradition that Pythago-ras, Plato, Eudoxos, and Democritus spent several years in Egyptstudying the Egyptian teachings from the priests provided thebasis for this idea.1474. Books: Knowledge is based on the consultation and collection oftexts of revealed occult knowledge.Lucian introduces Arignotus into the dialogue to pass his negativejudgement on this intellectual type. Arignotus may have the air of wis-dom and learning because of his adherence to philosophy, but fromLucian’s perspective he is a quack and as credulous as the other con-versation partners. Arignotus’ characterization as ‘holy man’ anddeusex machinais thus charged with irony from the outset.Lucian’s negative judgement of the magical abilities of Egyptianpriests and Hellenistic ‘purveyors of the occult’ should be contrasted146Neopythagoreanism was an eclectic current of thought that became popularfrom the Hellenistic period onwards basing its teachings, influenced by Platonic, Aris-totelian and Stoic philosophy, on texts supposed to have been written by Pythago-ras, whose authority was undisputed. The movement had a strong religious com-ponent and prescribed certain rules of conduct like asceticism and vegetarianism.Platonism remained popular during the Roman period and, due to a strong reli-gious inclination, developed an interest in theurgy as a way to contact the divine(Neoplatonism).147The main sources for this literary tradition are: Strabo,Geography,17.1.29;Dio-genes Laertius,Lives of the Philosophers,3.6;8.3;8.87;9.35; Iamblichus,On the Mysteriesof Egypt,I1(2,10–12).

In the introduction to the actual account of Apol-lonius’ travels and wonders, Philostratus touches upon several pointsthat belong to the above described type. Unlike Lucian, Philostratusdoes not use these elements to discredit his subject, but, instead, tounderscore Apollonius’ remarkable and sincere character. Philostratus’argumentation is as follows:1491. Apollonius was no wizard because he never resorted to the blackarts (and was never interested in financial gain [VA8.7.3]): hisinterest into the divine wasreligiouslymotivated.2. The argument that his visits to Babylonian, Indian and Egyptianpriests turn him into a quack does not hold, because several Greekphilosophers of high esteem made similar travels: his interest inforeign wisdom wasphilosophicallymotivated.For quite akin to theirs [Neopythagorean philosophers, jd] was the idealwhich Apollonius pursued. Being more god-like (\u001eει\u001aτερ\u0010ν) than Pytha-goras, he wooed wisdom and soared above tyrants; and lived in timesnot long gone by nor again quite of our own day; yet men know himnot because of the true wisdom, which he practised as a sage and sanely.One person praises this, another that (aspect) of the man, while others,because he had interviews with the wizards (μ\tγ\u0010ις) of Babylon and withthe Brahmans of India, and with the nude ascetics (Γυμν\u0010<ς)ofEgypt,put him down as a wizard (μ\tγ\u0010ν), and spread the calumny that he148A general assessment of the antique interest in Apollonius of Tyana is given inE.L.

Apuleius defends himself againstthe accusation of magic not by denying the charges brought in against him, but bystressing the religious and philosophical character of his interest into the divine, therebyaccusing his litigants of irreligiosity and ignorance.

Moreover, Plato went to Egypt and mingled with his owndiscourses much of (what he heard from) the prophets and priests there;and though, like a painter, he laid his own colours on to their roughsketches, yet he never passed for a wizard, but, instead, was envied aboveall mankind for his wisdom.[Philostratus,The Life of Apollonius of Tyana,1.2]150The underlying question of this short passage, which summarizes theessential elements of the Greco-Roman perceptions of magic and magi-cians, is that for the nature of true wisdom. Philostratus responds to aview widely accepted during the Roman period that constructs a rigiddistinction betweenmagos(wizard) andsophos(sage), of which the latteris the positive member, associated with Greek philosophy and Hellenicculture in general. The former member is coupled with foreignness thatis rejected on the ground of a general dislike towards cultural formsand religious views that are alien and felt to be dangerous to Hellenicculture. This view is strongly opposed against otherness and definesan oriental culture like Egypt in terms of decadence, trickery, deceit,treachery, cruelty and abstruse religious customs. Philostratus countersthis view by introducing the element of personal intentions: a sage isonly of the illegitimate sort when he turns towards the black arts andsells offhis knowledge.151In his view, interest in oriental wisdom is verypositive since it stood at the basis of Greek philosophy itself. For him,Apollonius of Tyana is a holy man leading a contemplative life of ahigh moral standard and combining Greek and oriental wisdom in oneperson, thereby emulating the ancient Greek philosophers. Philostratusis thus not necessarily opposed against foreignness; on the contrary, heholds the foreign sages in high esteem for their particular knowledgethat is lacking in Hellenic culture.150Translation modified from F.C. Conybeare.151This argument is as well taken up by Heliodorus in hisAithiopika,whenhemakes the fictional Memphite priest Kalasiris explain to a Greek the twofold natureof Egyptian wisdom (Aithiopika,3.16). The vulgar form is concerned with idols, herbs,incantations and necromancy producing illusion instead of reality, whereas the secondform, ‘the true Egyptian wisdom’, is directed towards companionship with the gods.The second form ‘is remote from the earthy matters of our world, and concerns itselfwith all that is noble and profitable for mankind’ (Aithiopika,3,16.4;tr.M.Hadas)."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"of priests and prestige249It has become clear by now that, in the Greco-Roman writings onmagic and miracles, advocates and opponents alike based their argu-ments on a stereotypic image of Egypt and its priests. Depending ontheir viewpoint, Egyptian priests were either perceived as fraudulentwizards solely interested in financial gain or as prestigious philosopherswho had served as teachers to the famous Greek philosophers (and stillserved as teachers to those interested in esoteric lore) deriving their wis-dom from their ancient texts stored in their temples. When this image iscompared with the images of Egyptian priests found in Egyptian texts,a number of important differences can be observed:1. In Egyptian texts, the discussion whether the priest is a fraud orgenuine religious master is absent.2. The idea of performing magical feats for financial gain is likewiseabsent.3. In Egyptian literary texts, ritual experts are respected membersof society, whereas in Greek or Latin texts Egyptian priests arealienated from society and function as exotic gurus or miracleworkers.4. The royal court as the arena of display and contest is absent in theGreco-Roman texts.5. In Egyptian literary texts, ritual experts are mostly projected backinto the remote past, whereas they are set in a time period more orless contemporary with the reader’s time in Greek or Latin texts.6. In Egyptian fictional narratives, magicians are actors who focaliseand speak, whereas in Greek or Latin texts Egyptian priests aremainly passive objects subordinated to a Hellenistic view-point.Despite these differences, the Egyptian and Greco-Roman images havecertain elements in common as well:1. The priest is recognised by his title (prophet, temple scribe) anddress (white linen clothing, sandals of palm leaves or papyrus,baldhead).2. Priestly knowledge is based on the consultation of books.3. This knowledge is kept secret from laity.In the light of these correspondences, the question wherefrom Hellenis-tic authors drew their knowledge about Egypt becomes highly relevant.Unfortunately, little is known about the nature of the transfer of thisknowledge and its actors.

The opinions on Egypt ofclassical Greek authors like Homer, Herodotus and Plato remainedauthoritative during the Hellenistic and Roman period, which led toan image of the country and its priests detached from contemporaryreality.152Unfortunately, very little is preserved of the works in Greekwritten by Egyptian priests, of whom Manetho (third century BCE)and Chaeremon (first century CE) are best known,153so that it is almostimpossible to judge whether these works responded to the distortedalthough highly influential classical Greek image.154As little is knownabout the reception of these Greco-Egyptian works in Hellenistic elitecircles.155Chaeremon’s description of Egyptian priestly life (first centuryCE) was probably well known among scholarly elites, since it wasquoted as an authoritative text in Porphyry’sOn Abstinence(second halfof third century CE).156Chaeremon’s text should be seen as an activeattempt to inscribe Egyptian priestly culture into Hellenistic thoughtby way of casting his account in Stoic terms. He describes Egyptianpriestly life as an ascetic life in seclusion characterised by notions such152See for the image of Egypt in classical Greek literature: C.

The second fragment containsagain the Egyptian priestly titles in Greek that were found in the trilin-gual priestly decrees of Canopus and Memphis.Chaeremon the Stoic tells in his exposé about the Egyptian priests, who,he says, were considered also as philosophers (\u000fιλ\u0010σ\u001a\u000f\u0010υς)amongtheEgyptians, that they chose the temples as the place to philosophise.For to live close to their shrines was fitting to their whole desire ofcontemplation, and it gave them security because of the reverence forthe divine, since all people honoured the philosophers as if they were asort of sacred animals.[Porphyry,On Abstinence4.6]The true philosophising was found among the prophets (πρ\u0010\u000f#ταις),the priests who had charge of the sacred vestments (9ερ\u0010στ\u0010λιστα<ς),the temple scribes (9ερ\u0010γραμματε\u0011σιν)aswellashour-priests(Gρ\u0010λ\u001aγ\u0010ις).However, the rest of the priests, the crowd of shrine bearers, templewardens and assistants, perform the same purification rites for the gods,although not with such precision and self-control.[Porphyry,On Abstinence4.8]158These written accounts will certainly have had their effect on the Hel-lenistic image of Egypt and its priesthood, but the actual presence ofEgyptian priests in centres of the Hellenistic world like Athens, Antioch,Rome, will probably have been more important.

This fascination for Egyp-tian religious experiences led some to undertake a journey to Egypt towitness the wonders of the country of the Nile.

It is important to notethat a dominant Hellenistic perspective determines the Greco-Romanimages of Egyptian priests, but nevertheless Egyptian priests may haveplayed an active role in formulating this image.

Therefore, the central question is here: towhat kind of reader is the text speaking? In which way do the magicalrecipes address the implied reader’s expectations and aspirations anddo they make use of culturally specific text formats and knowledge?The most obvious sources to provide clues for answering these ques-tions are the ‘marketing’ statements contained in the magical spells. Aconsiderable number of magical recipes are introduced by short adver-tising texts stressing the reliability of the following recipe, its efficacyand its extraordinary character. These guarantees, or quality marks,can easily be disguised as utter instances of window-dressing aimed atrendering the recipe beyond all doubt and critique. The texts are, so tospeak, wrapped in an attractive package as an appeal to impress theirreaders and to attract attention among the many alternative spells thatmust have been available in antiquity. Since these advertisements couldonly have been successful if they address the expectations and aspira-tions of the intended readers and share the audience’s ideas and valuesregarding magic and ritual, they provide valuable information aboutthe social and cultural identity of their implied audience.TheDemoticandGreek Magical Papyrimake use of a uniform set ofrhetorical techniques to mystify magical recipes.

In a few instances an advertising introduction evencombines motifs deriving from separate cultural traditions that wouldstrictly speaking be mutually exclusive, as if the author of the spellintended an (cross-cultural) accumulation of prestige. In the followingpages the different methods and motifs will be discussed by meansof tables listing the occurrences in the magical spells. Since the twomanuscripts under study do not deviate in this respect from the othermanuscripts contained in the corpus of Magical Papyri, the entire cor-pus is taken into account, so that it is possible to study the mechanismof mystification in more detail. Ultimately, the conclusions will be con-fronted with the conclusions of the previous sections to determine towhich degree the implied reader of the Demotic and Greek magicalspells is identical with the implied reader of any of the literary tradi-tions.6.4.1.Advertising introductions to the actual magical recipesTo gain an idea of the nature and the possible textual formats of theadvertising introductions one might consider the following six passages,which have been selected for their explicitness and relative length.The different methods and motifs will be considered in more detaillater.(a) The first passage is the one that triggered the questions of thepresent chapter. According to this short explanatory preface, the fol-lowing list of encoded ingredients is the result of the consultation andtranslation of a considerable number of secret temple texts kept andwritten by the Egyptian temple scribes.Interpretations (Lρμηνε%ματα)translated(με\u001eηρμηνευμ&να) from the holy(writings), of which the temple scribes (9ερ\u0010γραμματε<ς)madeuse.Be-cause of the nosiness (περιεργ\u0014αν) of the masses, they (the temple scribes)167An overview of the different textual techniques employed in the PGM to inscribemagical recipes with authority is given in Hans D.

However, we have collectedthe solutions (λ%σεις) from many copies, all of them secret.[PGM XII.401–407](b) The second example is the introduction to theOuphôrrite, whichhas already been discussed as part of an elaborate and complex ringspell in chapter5.3. The passage claims the Ouphôr to be a holy rite,which has been written down carefully, devoid of lies or verbosity unlikealternative spells. A certain Ourbikos, who is otherwise unknown, issaid to have made use of the spell. The reader is ordered to keep thetext secret.Whenever you want to command the god, give command after you havesaid the great Ouphôr and he (i.e. the god169) fulfills: you have the riteof the greatest and divine execution (4νεργ#ματ\u0010ς).

The priest tells that the spell has been chosenfrom an infinite number of (sacred) books, implying that this specific168The verbπεριεργ\tεινhas a derived meaning ‘assiduously investigating and per-forming rituals’, the overtones of which are certainly brought into play in the presentpassage; cf. ‘Zauberei treiben’, Preisendanz,PGM II,84, and ‘practice magic’, Betz andScarborough inGMPT,167.In1Ep.Cor.9.13εργ\tεινdenotes ‘performing rituals’.169The ring itself could be meant as well.170For this passage, see also, Gordon, ‘Reporting the Marvellous’,73ff.171Thissen suggests that the name is rather an invention than a real personal name.Its meaning ‘The-god’ or ‘He-of-the-god’ (<PA-n ̄trorPa-n ̄tr) would render a senseof trustworthiness to the text; Thissen, ‘Ägyptologische Beiträge zu den griechischenmagischen Papyri’,295."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"258chapter sixspell is of exceptional quality. Moreover, he seems to suggest in a poorlypreserved part of the passage that the spell is god-given.The spell of Pnouthis, the temple scribe (9ερ\u0010γραμματ&ως), for acquiringan assistant: [...] Pnouthios greets Keryx, the god-[fearing man].

The address to the divine entities Providence andPsyche to come to the aid of the author is reminiscent of the invocationof the muses in classical literature. The text is said to derive from thesupreme god himself.Be Gracious to me, O Providence and Psyche, as I write these mysterieshanded down\u0002not\u0003for gain; and for an only child I request immortality,O initiates of this our power (furthermore, it is necessary for you, Odaughter, to take the juices of herbs and spices, which will\u0002be madeknown\u0003to you at the end of my holy treatise), which the great god HeliosMithras ordered to be revealed to me by his archangel, so that I alonemay ascend into heaven as an inquirer and behold the universe.[PGM IV.475–485]179At two instances the narrator bears witness to the efficacy of the givenspell.I have not found a greater spell than this in the world[PGM IV.776]ManytimeshaveIusedthespell,andhavewonderedgreatly[PGM IV.790f.]180177The Greekα\u0003ων\u0010\u001d\u0014Mωis a literal translation of Egyptian(nty)#n ̆h ̄d.t,‘wholivesforever’, an epithet attached to the name of the reigning pharaoh in Demotic docu-mentary texts of the Ptolemaic period; F.Ll.

Before giving the instructions for a burntoffering, the text relates how the Egyptian high priest Pakhrates181wasgiven a double fee by emperor Hadrian (who indeed visited Egypt in130CE) because of the miraculous effect of the spell.182Pakhrates, the high priest (πρ\u0010\u000f#της) of Heliopolis, revealed [it] to theemperor Hadrian, revealing the power of his very own divine magic (τ\u000eς\u001eε\u0014ας α2τ\u0010\u0011 μαγε\u0014ας). For it attracted in one hour; it made someone sickin2hours; it destroyed in7hours, sent the emperor himself dreams ashe thoroughly tested the whole truth of the magic within his power. Andmarvelling at the prophet, he ordered double fees to be given to him.[PGM IV.2446–2455]183This short narrative interruption of the recipe serves as evidence to theclaims made by the text in the advertising introduction.It attracts those who are uncontrollable, requiring no magical material,within one day. It inflicts sickness excellently and destroys powerfully,sends dreams beautifully, accomplishes dream revelations marvellouslyand in its many demonstrations has been marvelled at for having nofailure in these matters.[PGM IV.2442–2446]184These passages stand out among the available advertising introductionsbecause of their explicitness and relative length. The texts make useof several textual strategies: they can take the form of a justifying,almost philological, preface, a letter or an anecdote, while the invokedcommunication situation is one between an Egyptian priest and anEgyptian king or between a mentor and a student in the occult arts.However, in most cases, a spell is made attractive only by its title,like, for example,Charm of Agathokles for sending dreams(PGM XII.107–121),Zminis’ of Tentyra’s spell for sending dreams(PGM XII.121–143),Charmof Solomon that produces a trance(PGM IV.850–929),Apollonius of Tyana’sold serving woman(PGM XI.a.1–40),Hidden stele(PGM IV.1115–1166)or‘Great is the mistress Isis’; Copy of a holy book found in the archives of181This character may be identical with the Pancrates described in Lucian’sPhilop-seudes34(see the preceding section).

The sole reference to a famous magician, ahidden Egyptian text or a divinity was apparently deemed sufficient toimpart to the reader a feeling of confidence in the efficacy of the spell.6.4.2.Analysis of the mystifying motifsThe advertising introductions make use of four motifs to mystify amagical recipe. These motifs have here been separated for clarity’s sake,but recur in a variety of combinations in the actual spells.1851. Origin of the text (pseudepigraphy)a. God-given or attributed to a godb. Famous author (philosopher, magician)2. Authenticity of the messagea. ‘Original’ letter, suggesting actual correspondence betweentwo magiciansb. Testimony of text’s discovery in temple or on stelec. Testimony of text’s translation from Egyptian into Greek3. Proof of efficacy4. Importance to maintain secrecyIn the following, the distribution and the nature of each of the abovelisted motifs will be considered in closer detail by means of tables listingthe occurrences in theDemoticandGreek Magical Papyri. The followingconclusions can be given beforehand:1. The idea to render a text authoritative and prestigious by meansof mystification was already known in the pharaonic period.2. There seems to be no strict relationship between the rite’s purposeand authorship.3. The pseudepigraphy motif makes use of several distinct culturaltraditions (Egyptian, Greek, Jewish, Persian).185This breakdown by subjects diverges slightly from the subdivision proposed byWolgang Speyer, whose theoretical work on pseudepigraphy and literary forgery inantiquity remains the standard.

Collections of letters attributed to figures such as Soc-rates, Plato, Apollonius of Tyana circulated throughout the RomanEmpire.229The method was particularly popular in Christian, Hermeticand alchemical circles as a means to render new texts and opinionsauthoritative by giving them the air of tradition and authenticity. Theidea of fictitious letters was already extant in pharaonic Egypt as istestified by the literaryWermai’s Letter(beginning21stdynasty) and thesemi-literary school letters of the so-calledLate Egyptian Miscellanies(lateNew Kingdom).230Of particular interest are two letters out of a setof Demotic fictional letters written on the outer surface of three jarsdating to the late Ptolemaic or early Roman period.231The first letter(O. Krug. A,a), of which the sender’s name is lost, is addressed topharaoh and relates the tale of a certain magician (.hry-tp)Hyhorwhowas detained in prison and received help from two birds. The secondletter (O. Krug. A,d) is sent by the king of Arabia to pharaoh andcontains a fable of a swallow and the sea.232The format of these lettersis very similar to the letters in the PGM: in the first letter, pharaohfunctions as the receiving partner in the exchange of knowledge onmagic, while the second letter is an instance of correspondence betweenkings as in the case of Pitys and Ostanes (PGM IV.2006–2125).233229Speyer,Die literarische Fälschung,79–81.230Fo rWermai’s Letter, see, Ricardo A.

These texts were written in hieratic or, from the Romanperiod onwards, in Demotic by the lector priests and temple scribes and kept in theHouse-of-Life and temple library. Therefore, the use of the word ‘holy book’ in the titleof a magical spell in Greek implies an act of appropriation and translation.235A stele is a stone slab inscribed with a commemorative text. In Egypt, steles wereusually inscribed with a hieroglyphic text and erected in temples or at the entrance to atomb.236Three cities were under the name Aphroditopolis in Greco-Roman Egypt: (1)Atfih, lying about400kilometres to the north of Thebes at the height of the Fayumregion, (2) Kom Ishqaw, about200kilometres to the north of Thebes and (3) Dzjebelein(Pathyris), about30kilometres to the south of Thebes. All three of them had a cult forthe goddess Hathor (Aphrodite in Greek). The magical spell refers in all probabilityto Atfih, which was known, nation-wide, for its cult of the white cowHesat, whichgoddess was assimilated with Isis-Hathor; R. Grieshammer, ‘Atfih’LdÄI,519.Themain character of the taleNectanebo’s Dream, which is partly preserved in both Demoticand Greek, is a resident of this same Aphroditopolis (in DemoticPr-nb.t-ˆtp-\"ı.h). Sincethis character is fond of wine and women, the city of Hathor, goddess of love andmerriment, is probably deliberately chosen in this tale. For the texts, see, Jörg-DieterGauger, ‘Der “Traum des Nektanebos”—die griechische Fassung –’, in: Blasius andSchipper (eds.),Apokalyptik und Ägypten,189–219and Kim Ryholt, ‘Nectanebo’s Dreamor the Prophecy of Petesis’,op. cit.,221–241."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"272chapter sixSpellSubject MatterOriginal LocationPGM XXIVa.1–25Description ofHoly book found in theoracular ritearchives of Hermes (2ff.)PGM CXXII.1–55Magic handbookHoly book calledHermesfound in innermost shrine ofthetempleinHeliopolis(1ff.)The fiction of the discovery of an old and lost ritual text does not occurin theDemotic Magical Papyri, but is frequent in theGreek Magical Papyri.In each case, an Egyptian ritual text is concerned, either written on apapyrus roll or inscribed on a stele, which had been found in a templeshrine or a temple library.237The geographical location of the temple,Heliopolis, Hermopolis or Aphroditopolis, is not arbitrarily chosen butdetermined by the religious prestige the city held within Egypt andeven abroad. The god Thoth (Hermes, in Greek) and his cult centreHermopolis are clearly favoured topics. This rhetorical strategy wasalready in use in religious and magical texts of the pharaonic period.The idea is attested as early as in spell577of theCoffinTextswhere it isstated that the spell was found under the flank of (a statue of) Anubis.It is also prominent in theBook of the Deadand texts of technical priestlyknowledge of different periods.238The so-calledMemphite Theology,acos-237Speyer distinguishes between books fallen from heaven, books found in tombs(written either on a payrus roll or a stele) and books found in temple archives orlibraries: Wolfgang Speyer,Bücherfunde in der Glaubenswerbung der Antike(Hypomnemata24; Göttingen1970).InthecaseoftheGreek Magical Papyri, the Egyptian temple is thesole place of discovery of ritual papyri or steles. Nonetheless, the other motifs were alsoused in pharaonic Egypt (see next footnote).238CertainBook of the Deadmanuscripts have postscripts to spells that attribute thediscovery of spells to prince Hordedef, son of pharaoh Khufu, who would have foundthe spells during an inspection of temples in the time of pharaoh Menkaure: BD30B,64,137A,148; for the sources, see, Dietrich Wildung,Die Rolle ägyptischer Könige imBewußtsein ihrer Nachwelt I(MÄS17;Berlin1969)217–221. Variant manuscripts set thediscovery of spells BD64and130back to the times of king Khasti, the fifth king ofthe first dynasty: Wildung,op. cit.,25–28.BDPleyte166is said to be found around theneck of the mummy of king User-Ma\"at-Re (Ramses II); the introduction to BD Pleyte167claims that Khamwaset, son of Ramses II, found the spell under the head of amummy and that it had earlier been used by Amenhotep son of Hapu. A portion of theso-calledVessel Book, preserved in two varying redactions in the New Kingdom medicalcompendia P. Ebers (§§854–855and856) and P. Berlin3038(§163) was purportedlyfound in a manuscript lying under the feet of a statue of the god Anubis in Letopolis(EgyptianKhem) in the days of pharaoh Khasti, see: Wildung,op. cit.,21–25.

The so-calledBook-of-the-"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"of priests and prestige273mogonical account inscribed on the Shabaka Stone, brings the signif-icance of this rhetorical strategy in Egyptian religious discourse mostprominently to the fore. The introduction to the actual cosmogonydoes not only state that pharaoh Shabaka (first king of the25thdynasty)ordered that a faithful copy of the ancient worm-eaten papyrus mustbe made, the orthography and grammar of the text display as well as anumber of archaising features. Despite these archaic elements the textis clearly the product of the25thdynasty (c.715–657BCE) and thus rep-resents an attempt on the part of the Memphite priesthood to acquireprestige and authority by means of presumed tradition.239In the Greek-speaking world the motif of discovery became popularonly from the fourth century BCE onwards, to become pervasive inthe Roman period, particularly so in works of occult knowledge.240Inthe majority of cases the fictitious discovery is situated on the peripheryof the Greco-Roman world, for example, in Egypt or Mesopotamia,where temples and graves were thought to abound in magical charmsTe m p l e, a treatise on the ideal arrangement of the temple building and its institution,which is preserved in a large number of hieratic and Demotic redactions, is said tobe found by prince Hordedef in the temple of the god Atum in Heliopolis in thedays of pharaoh Khufu: Joachim F.

The idea of a text fallenfrom heaven is attested in a New Kingdom medical prescription (London MedicalPapyrus §60) in which is stated that the spell descended into the court of the templeof Coptos the moon shining upon it in the days of king Khufu. According to a passagein the foundation account of the temple of Edfu, the architectural plan of the templehad fallen from heaven to the north of Memphis (Edfu VI,6,4).239Friedrich Junge, ‘Zur Fehldatierung des sog. Denkmals memphitischer Theologieoder Der Beitrag der ägyptischen Theologie zur Geistesgeschichte der Spätzeit’MDAIK29(1973)195–204. This text is not the sole example of the Egyptian priesthood employ-ing the mystifying technique with the aim of religious propaganda. TheBentresh Steleand theFamine Steleare two obvious cases in point. TheBentresh Steleis a forgery of thePersian or Ptolemaic period, which relates the miraculous cure of a princess Bentreshof Bakhtan by the Theban god Knonsu-the-provider-in-Thebes in the time of pharaohRamses II, see: Michèle Broze,La princesse de Bakhtan. Essai d’analyse stylistique(Monogra-phies Reine Élisabeth6; Brussels1989). TheFamine Stele, composed in the Ptolemaicperiod, pretends to be a decree of pharaoh Djoser of the third dynasty to grant rev-enues of Nubia to the temple of Khnum-Re in Elephantine as a reward for Khnum’swillingness to end a seven year period of drought, see, Paul Barguet,LaStèledelaFamineà Séhel,(BdE24;Cairo1953).

The Isis aretalogy, preserved in several redactions (Kyme, Thessaloniki,Ios, Andros and a variant version in Diodorus of Sicily I,27.3–6), is said to be copiedfrom the stele that stood next to the Ptah temple in Memphis.

However, a few Greek spells combine elementswhich, from a modern historian’s viewpoint, would be mutually exclu-sive. These cases need to be addressed, because they demonstrate con-clusively that the advertising statements do not relate to historical real-ity, but to a universe of preconceived ideas about authority and rit-ual power. Moreover, they testify to the fact that the compilers andauthors of the Greek magical spells were not striving for exclusive cul-tural or ethnic categories when composing the spells. According tothem,aspell’sefficacy did not depend on upholding a rigid separa-tion between ritual traditions. This attitude is paralleled in the practicein the Demotic magical spells to combine occasionally scripts and lan-guages that derive from different generic and cultural contexts.(1) A cluster of magical spells (PGM IV.1928–2144) dealing with necro-mantic rites is attributed to a certain Pitys, who is variably identified asking (1928), writer of a letter to king Ostanes (2006) and as originatingfrom Thessaly (2140).253These varying designations indicate that Pitys’identity was changeable, thus raising a legitimate modern mistrust ofthe veracity of the statements. In fact, contrary to the information pro-vided by the magical text, it is tempting to identify Pitys with a cer-tain Bitys who was neither a king nor originated from Thessaly, but anEgyptian priest who translated Egyptian hermetic texts into Greek.254Ifthis were true, the various attributions reveal a preference for an accu-mulation of prestige that trifles with cultural and ethnic boundaries.For example, the designation ‘Pitys of Thessaly’ (PGM IV.2140)com-bines the prestige and authority that was granted to Egyptian priests inboth the Egyptian and Greco-Roman mind with the Hellenistic imageof Thessaly as the home of all efficacious herbs, potions, spells andwitches.255What could be better than a magical spell written by anEgyptian priest from Thessaly? Pitys’ letter to king Ostanes is also a253On the relationship between the different spells within this cluster, see, Faraone,‘When Necromancy goes Underground’.254Iamblichus,On the Mysteries of Egypt, VIII.5and X.7; Thissen, ‘ÄgyptologischeBeiträge zu den griechischen magischen Papyri’,295f.; Fowden,The Egyptian Hermes,150–153.

Ostanes was not a king but a Persian magos who, accord-ing to tradition, had accompanied the Persian king Xerxes on the sec-ond Persian campaign against Greece in480/79BCE.256In the Romanperiod, Ostanes was remembered among Hellenistic elites as one ofthe greatest magicians and alchemists so that, in alchemical circles, hecould be called ‘the prince of all the magoi’ or ‘king of the seven vow-els’.257Several antique works on alchemy relate that Ostanes shared hisknowledge with Egyptian priests in Memphis after the Persian king hadsent him to Egypt as supervisor to its priests.258In this way, the title‘Pitys’ letter to king Ostanes’ draws for its effect upon the combinationof, on the one hand, the image of Egyptian priests and, on the other,the Roman period tradition according to which the great Ostanes hadresided in Egypt: a magical spell given by an Egyptian priest to Ostanescan only be of the highest quality.Like Pitys’ identity, the necromantic recipes themselves are compos-ite, betraying several layers of redaction and containing excerpts thatrecur in other parts of the PGM.259This shows that the spells are notunique compositions and that compilers of magical lore were willing toedit spells and manipulate information about the spell’s origin.(2) Egyptian and Jewish traditions are combined in a divination spellthat claims to establish communication with Osiris by means of anecstatic seizure of an adult or boy medium (PGM IV.850–929). Thespell’s title ascribes the procedure to the Old Testament king Solomon:‘Solomon’s collapse’ (850) and ‘the procedure of Solomon’ (853).

Although nothing is known aboutthese phylacteries, they are surely meant to invoke the guarding powersof the dog-faced godAnubis, god of the embalmment and guardian ofIsis after the murder of Osiris,260and thefalcongod Horus, son of Osiris.The link with Anubis is even reinforced by the prescription to awakenthe medium from his trance by barking like a dog (929). The invoca-tion calls upon Osiris as Hesies, a Greek transcription of the Egyptianepithet.hs.y, ‘the praised one’ or ‘the drowned one’, which refers toOsiris’ drowning in the Nile and subsequent resurrection.261The stringsofvoces magicaeconsist of a mix of incomprehensible names, muddledOsirian epithets and the repetition of Osiris’ name, either on its ownor in combination with another divine name.262According to the text,Hermes Trismegistos wrote the third and final string of these names inhieroglyphs in Heliopolis. Thus, given the purely Egyptian characterof these ritual techniques and mythological references, the attributionto the Jewish king Solomon is rather remarkable. However, the occur-rence of Solomon’s name in a magical text of the Roman period is notunusual, since, among Hellenised Jewish circles in Alexandria of thesecond century BCE onwards, the Biblical figure Solomon had beentransformed from a wise king to a powerful astrologer and magicianwho exerted control over a wide range of demons.263As a result of this,Solomon became a favoured pseudepigraphic author of magical andastrological treatises in Greek and Hebrew during the Roman period.264This particular magical spell thus has its roots in Egyptian ritual while,at the same time, it shares in the prestige that was attributed to theJewish king Solomon among the Hellenistic elites of the Roman period.260Plutarch,On Isis and Osiris,14,356Fand44,368E–F.261The epithet could be applied to any deceased after the necessary mortuary ritualsby which the deceased was transformed into an Osiris were conducted.

According to the spell’stitle, the famous Egyptian magician Pibechis265is its author: ‘A testedcharm of Pibechis for those possessed by demons’ (3007). However, theinvocation itself contains but few Egyptian elements (restricted to thevoces magicae), while abounding in Jewish and Biblical references.266TheJewish character of the spell is reinforced by the closing statement ‘thischarm is Hebraic’. Whatever the veracity of this statement, the spellcombines the authority of the Egyptian priest Pibechis with the prestigethat was afforded to Jewish magic.2676.5.What about priests and prestige?This chapter started out with a discussion of the advertising intro-duction to the list of encoded ingredients (PGM XII.401–407)andexpanded to a wide-ranging study of the nature, function and percep-tion of the Egyptian priesthood in the Greco-Roman period. This com-prehensive discussion was necessary to bring out sharply the tensionbetween what the text claims to be and historical reality. The results ofthe analyses are brought together and confronted with the conclusionsof the chapters1–5in the following and final chapter. Before continu-ing, however, it is opportune to summarise and evaluate what has beensaid about Egyptian priests and the textual devices to bestow magicalspells with prestige.265See footnote213.266The Biblical references are given inGMPT,96f. It goes without saying that theJewish or Christian character of the spell has attracted considerable attention, not in theleast because of the opening of the invocation ‘I conjure you by the god of the Hebrews,Jesus’ (3019f.). It is unclear whether the text is the product of a Jewish or pagan author,but scholars seem to favour the latter possibility because of certain inconsistencies inthe text. An analysis of the invocation in the light of the New Testament can be foundin S. Eitrem,Some Notes on the Demonology in the New Testament(Symb.Osloensis Suppl.20;2nded.; Oslo1966)15–30. A bibliography is given in Brashear, ‘The Greek MagicalPapyri’,3526f.; add to the list: Morton Smith, ‘The Jewish Elements in the MagicalPapyri’,250.267A noteworthy parallel is PGM V.96–172, a spell to acquire a demon as assistantattributed to an Egyptian person named Ieu the painter. The practitioner identifieshimself with ‘Moses, your prophet to whom you have transmitted your mysteriescelebrated by Israel’ (109–111) and he claims to know the true name ‘which has beentransmitted to the prophets of Israel’ (116f.)."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"of priests and prestige281The foregoing pages have demonstrated that, in theDemoticandGreekMagical Papyri, the rhetorical strategies used to invest a spell with pres-tige and authority are limited in number and were rooted in Egyp-tian priestly tradition. The repertoire of the Greek advertising texts,the set of social, historical and cultural norms, can be described as fol-lows. Efficacious magical spells are either given directly by a god, foundin a temple in Egypt, or were in the possession of persons who werein contact with the divine in their capacity as priest, physician, kingor philosopher. These persons are preferably historic figures widelyaccepted as outstanding authorities in the fields of magic, alchemy,astrology or philosophy. The cultural or ethnic origin of these figuresis not restricted to one particular category, but ranges from Egyptianpriests, Jewish culture heroes and Persian magoi to Greek philosophers.Nor are the ritual traditions represented by these categories treated asmutually exclusive, but can be combined in an attempt to share in anabundance of authority. It is remarkable that this cultural and ethnicdiversity holds solely for the motif of pseudepigraphy, whereas, in con-trast, the discovery of a magical spell is always situated in a temple inEgypt, the Nile valley to be exact, and the act of translation is alwaysfrom Egyptian into Greek.When comparing these conclusions with the repertoire of the De-motic spells, a divergence in frequency and quality can be observed. Inthe Demotic spells, quality marks are short and limited to statementsabout a text’s origin and proofs of efficacy, of which only the latter isfrequently applied. In a few cases a spell’s origin is explicitly ascribedto a god or mortal, but the attributions are never international. Evenin the case of the Persian king Darius I (P. London-Leiden11/26), theattribution is to be understood in the light of the fact that the Egyp-tian priesthood remembered Darius as a pious and righteous pharaoh.This divergence in repertoire between the Demotic and Greek spellscannot be without meaning in view of the question what kind of readerthe magical texts address, since, as has been said in the introductionto this section, the structure and nature of the advertising statements isindicative of the social formation and cultural make-up of the audience.In case of the Demotic spells, knowledge of Egyptian culture is suffi-cient to rate the advertising statements at their true value. However, theGreek spells demand from their implied reader familiarity with inter-national gods and authors. The spells take for granted that the readerknows of, and values highly, the authority of Egyptian priests, Jewishculture heroes, Persian magoi and Greek philosophers alike. Thus, the"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"282chapter sixdifference between the Demotic and Greek magical spells is not only amatter of language but also of implied audience. Given the fact that thetwo groups can be found together on one and the same manuscript, asin the case of P. Leiden384verso, this conclusion is highly significant.Were the Greek spells initially designed for an audience different fromthe users of the Demotic recipes?It is important to emphasise that the international range of gods andauthors is embedded in rhetorical devices in use in Egyptian ritual textssince as early as the redaction of theCoffinTexts(around2100BCE).Thus, the format as such did not change: it was the contents of thedevice that was adapted in the Greek spells. In addition to this linkwith older Egyptian rhetorical devices, the Greek advertising texts bearalso a resemblance to Egyptian ideas and images of magic as expressed,for example, in the fictional narratives that were discussed earlier:1. The Egyptian priest is a miracle worker2.Efficacious magical texts are written by Thoth-Hermes and hid-den from laity inside an Egyptian temple3. The royal court is the receiving partner in the exchange of knowl-edge on magicThe resemblance with the Egyptian literary image of the ritual expertis evident and not in need of further comments. These elements werealready productive in introductions or postscripts to magical or medicaltexts of the pharaonic period. The following two passages of the NewKingdom may serve to illustrate the effective use of the motifs of divineorigin, discovery in a temple, secrecy and proofs of efficacy in suchpedigrees of pharaonic date. In both cases, the royal court is the arenaof display and the time of discovery is set in the remote past, that isto say, the Old Kingdom, a period that was perceived as ideal andexemplary since the Middle Kingdom. In the first passage, a historicfigure is accredited with the discovery, whereas the second refers to thework of an anonymous temple scribe.This spell was found in Hermopolis on a brick of the ore of UpperEgypt, incised in real lapis lazuli, under the feet (of the statue) of thisgod in the time of the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt,Menkaure, by the king’s son Hordedef,268who found it when he wasgoing about to make inspections of the temples, a military force being268On this historic figure, see, footnote95and chapter6.3.3.1."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"of priests and prestige283with him on that account.

Berlin3038 15/1–5,§163a]The presence of these same elements in the Greek spells suggests afamiliarity with Egyptian ideas about ritual and magic on the part ofthe authors and users of the spells. However, there are also elementsthat are reminiscent of the Hellenistic discussions on magic, which wereanalysed in the previous section.1. Authoritative magicians are not only to be found among Egyp-tian priests, but among Jewish culture heroes, Persian magoi andGreek philosophers as well2. Objectification or even alienation of Egyptian priesthood3. Pursuit of financial profit4. Awareness of fraudulence and truly effective ritualsDespite these similarities with a Hellenistic discourse that was createdand maintained outside Egypt, theGreek Magical Papyrioriginated in alllikelihood in Egypt. Reasons for this are:1. The advertising introductions reveal rather detailed knowledge ofnative cultic topography of the Nile Valley. In Greek and Latintexts, Memphis, to a lesser degree Thebes, function as the centreof occult knowledge.272269Tr. Thomas G.

The two corpora are not only different as far as their baselanguage and script are concerned, but also with respect to the waythe reader is made to believe in the efficacy of a given spell. Theanalysis of the ‘marketing’ techniques at work in the introductions tothe spells has demonstrated that both text corpora make use of thesame rhetorical devices, which are firmly rooted in pharaonic magicalthought, but the realization of these devices or, their textual content forthat matter, may differ for each corpus. For example, the Greek spellsaddress as prestigious authors the same range of international miracleworkers and gurus that occur in Greek and Latin texts of the Greco-Roman period: Persian magoi, Greek philosophers, Semitic magiciansand Egyptian priests. However, pseudepigraphy is far less attested inthe Demotic spells and, in those rare cases where it does occur, a spellis attributed to a person who fits into the local Egyptian tradition. It istherefore warranted to conclude that the Greek spells were written witha readership in mind that differs from that of the Demotic spells. Giventhe striking similarities between the text corpora regarding prescribedritual techniques and claimed magical effects, their respective usergroups cannot be differentiated on the basis of the type of spell; thisis to say, the two groups had more or less similar magical aspirations,namely, contact with the divine, control over other persons and healing.It is primarily in their view on the nature and the origin of authoritativeritual specialists that they differ.1Roger S. Bagnall,Reading Papyri, Writing Ancient History(London1995)21."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"286chapter sevenEgyptian ideas about ritual efficacy and ritual specialists weregrounded in the conviction that an Egyptian priest is a servant of god,whose attitude to life is in agreement with the priestly ethos of purityand who, on account of this morality, is in close contact with the divine.Even in the fictional and somewhat burlesque narratives Setne I and II,the main character is only able to perform extraordinary magical featsbecause he is a ‘good scribe and wise man’. Greco-Roman discourseon the nature of ritual experts takes a different approach: Egyptianpriests are not admired because of their supposed high moral stand-ing, but primarily on account of their otherness: like the Persian magoi,Greek philosophers and Semitic magicians, they are regarded as with-drawing from Hellenistic communal life and, through study, seclusionand initiation, being knowledgeable in the workings of nature and inways to manipulate the course of events. As I argue in chapter6.1,theintroduction to the list of coded ingredients not only falsely attributesa non-existent custom to Egyptian temple scribes, but also representsthese temple scribes asoutsidersto the narrator and his intended read-ership. In this fashion, this short text aims at appealing to readers whoare acquainted with, and believe in, the exoticised image of EgyptianpriestsasitispropagatedinHellenistictexts,ratherthantoreaderswho are truly versed in Egyptian priestly lore.This observation is at odds with the conclusion of chapters3and4, that the scribes engaged in editing and copying the Demotic spellsof the two magical handbooks must have been native priests, whohad gone through an Egyptian scribal training at an Egyptian templeschool. The extant Demotic spells are clearly the result of a complexprocess of compiling, consulting, adapting, copying and editing reli-gious and magical texts in hieratic, Demotic, Old-Coptic and Greek.The former two languages were taught and used only among thenative clergy. The short titles in Demotic added to the two Greekring spells and the Greek separation spell testify to the fact that theextant Greek spells were also edited and copied by a scribe literatein the Egyptian language and scripts. It then follows that any user ofthe manuscripts must also have been familiar with the Egyptian scriptsand, as a consequence, with native priestly life. Therefore, it is remark-able to discover that the list of coded ingredients is validated by meansof an image of the Egyptian priesthood that is not authentic to Egyp-tian culture. The Egyptian editors and users of the extant handbooksmust have perceived this incongruity. How then to explain this incon-gruity?"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"towards a model of textual transmission287Irrespective of the Hellenistic image of Egyptian priests, the intro-ductory text is correct in claiming to provide authentic native priestlyknowledge, as has been demonstrated in chapter6.2. Similarly, theanalysis of the two Greek ring spells in chapter5has revealed that thetexts present genuine Egyptian ritual techniques, verse patterns and, inthe case of theOuphôrrite, even incorporate an adapted version of avital Egyptian ritual. This means that the Greek spells were composedwith the help of genuine Egyptian ritual, magical and medical texts,books which were traditionally written in the hieratic script and onlyaccessible to Egyptian priests. Like the Demotic spells, the Greek spellsare thus clearly the product of compiling, consulting, adapting and edit-ing Egyptian priestly lore and must therefore, one way or another, origi-nate from a native temple milieu. David Frankfurter’s suggestion of rec-onciling the exotic Hellenistic image with the genuine Egyptian roots ofthe magical texts by applying the concept of stereotype appropriationonto the material has been mentioned a number of times in the fore-going chapters. He argues that Egyptian priests, bereft of their incomeby the economic measures taken by the Roman government, mimic theHellenistic image of their profession to secure financial gain from theHellenistic elite, which is interested in personal religious experiencesand close contact with the divine through the agency of an Orientalguru. This explains why the Greek magical texts are packaged in pedi-grees that appeal to a Hellenistic readership, while at the same timebeing firmly rooted in traditional Egyptian thought. As has been saidin chapter6.3.4, it is indeed very likely that native priests, expatriateand within Egypt, played an active role in constructing and confirmingthe exotic image among Hellenistic elite.David Frankfurter’s suggestion might apply when considering theGreek spells in isolation as an independent corpus, but is less obviouslytrue for the two manuscripts under discussion, which combine GreekandDemotic spells. Why would a manuscript that was produced in anative temple scriptorium and could only be used by a person trainedin an Egyptian temple school, contain passages in which Hellenisticstereotypes are appropriated? For whom would these stereotypes beincluded? A Hellenistic reader could not make use of the manuscriptanyway. A solution to this problem might be considering the combina-tion of Demotic and Greek sections as contrary to their editor’s originalintentions, this is to say, that the two parts were initially produced astwo separate branches of magical literature and were only combinedlater in the course of their complex history of textual transmission."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"288chapter sevenCertainly, the two branches are closely related with respect to sourcematerial and social milieu of origin, but as end products they were notmeant to fulfil the same functions.At this point of the discussion it is instructive to consider the motto tothis chapter, which is taken from a paragraph in which the Greek papy-rologist Roger Bagnall explains the functional and sociological rela-tionship between Demotic and Greek documentary papyri (contracts,petitions, tax receipts) in the Ptolemaic period. He concludes that anEgyptian’s choice of language did not necessarily depend upon his orher ethnic or cultural background, but rather upon the specific cir-cumstances of the case, for example, whether one sought access to anEgyptian or a Greek court, a choice that could be made for strate-gic reasons.2Although Bagnall limits himself to legal texts, the presentstudy might gain something from his conclusion: ‘All this suggests thatthe historian must pay considerable attention to questions of the useof different languages for particular purposes and certainly not assumethat they are in any sense equivalent.’3In analogy with the languagestrategies at play in the legal system, it is quite possible to argue thatthe Demotic and Greek spells, though closely related in form, contentand source material, addressed different social groups and functionedinitially within different social contexts. It is then hardly surprising thatthe Greek spells, because directed towards a Hellenistic audience, dis-play at times aspects of stereotype appropriation, whereas the socialstrategy is completely lacking in the Demotic spells, as they were notconcerned with this social group, but with Egyptian priests only.Before considering how it came about that the two text corporaended up in combination on two associated manuscripts written inthe Theban region, it is opportune to address the difference betweenthe Demotic and Greek spells in more detail. The most fertile line ofapproach is to study the recurring tension between local and interna-tional aspects, on the one hand, and traditional and innovative ele-ments on the other, a tension which surfaces in both corpora to varyingdegrees and in different ways. The Demotic spells are clearly rooted ina long tradition of Egyptian text production as is most evident from theuse of red ink to mark headings, technical key terms and verse points,and from the standard phrases ‘otherwise said’ or ‘another manuscript2Bagnall,Reading Papyri,20–21. Bagnall merely summarizes the important workdone by P.W. Pestman and W. Clarysse; for the references, see, page121.3Bagnall,op. cit.,21."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"towards a model of textual transmission289\u0002says\u0003’ to introduce variant readings that the scribe found in parallelmanuscripts. These scribal techniques had been in use for over twothousand years in Egypt. That a high number of spells displays anintricate mixing of Demotic and hieratic is a further indication that thespells originate from an Egyptian temple scriptorium, where the knowl-edge, the means and the textual sources for these kind of texts wereavailable. Moreover, the rites and prayers always operate against thebackground of Egyptian ritual and mythology, except for the six shortreferences to Moses and the great god upon the mountain. Apart fromthese traditional Egyptian roots, the editors were also receptive to inno-vations and international currents of thought concerning ritual power.The introduction of the seven Greek vowels and palindromes into theDemotic spells clearly testifies to a positive valorisation of magical con-cepts that are in essence foreign to Egyptian language and culture. Thearray of transcribed and glossedvoces magicae, which include garbleddivine names and epithets in Egyptian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Persian andGreek, is another testimony to the larger Hellenistic world entering thedomain of Egyptian ritual. The most obvious example of the desire toshare in the international world of Hellenistic magic and medicine isthe occurrence of the Greekmateria medica et magicajargon accompa-nied by transcriptions and explanations in Demotic on the verso sideof P. London-Leiden. Of particular interest is that the jargon is onlyexplained in Demotic, not in Greek, so that the insertion of this jar-gon cannot be interpreted as reflecting the ambition to open up themanuscript to a user group outside the native priestly milieu.The Greek spells have an unmistakable Hellenistic character notonly because of the frequent occurrence ofvoces magicae,palindromesand the seven vowels, but also because of the inclusion of cultural ideasthat have direct parallels in other Greek or Latin texts that formedpart of Hellenistic intellectual life, such as, for example, the alreadymentioned international range of ritual specialists or the ‘Names of theNations’ motif discussed in chapter5.2.b. In spite of this, the corpuscontains several indications that the Egyptian component should notbe underestimated. First of all, the testimonies of a text’s discoveryin a temple or on a stele, treated in chapter6.4,alwayssituatethediscovery in the Nile valley, preferably in Hermopolis. Furthermore, themythological references are almost always Egyptian, the Osiris mythin particular, albeit not as detailed or varied as in the Demotic spells.As far as the scribal techniques are concerned, it is remarkable thatthe rendition in writing or layout of the firstOuphôrinvocation adheres"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"290chapter sevento the traditional combination of the clauses about opening the doorsof heaven and earth, while the secondOuphôrinvocation mirrors thelayout of a litany in hieratic script. Not only this striking similarity withthe layout of Egyptian ritual texts, but also the fact that theOuphôrriteitself is an adapted version of the Opening of the Mouth ritual makesevident that the influence of the Egyptian temple scriptorium is strong.The textual structure of the invocation to the All-Lord, discussed inchapter5.2.b, strictly follows the pattern of an Egyptian ritual in so faras the practitioner identifies with a wide range of divine beings andshows his knowledge of their epithets and spheres of influence. As Ihave argued, several passages reveal a detailed knowledge of Egyptianmythology and develop religious ideas and imagery that can already befound in Egyptian texts dating to the New Kingdom. In one case, theparallel text is preserved in three hieroglyphic versions on temple walls,dating from the Kushite to the Ptolemaic period, and in a Demoticversion on an ostracon of the Roman period, proving that these kindsof texts were still read and edited in the Roman period. Next to theseEgyptian sections the prayer to the All-Lord contains a hexametricalhymn, which likely derives from a cultural tradition other than theEgyptian. This shows again that, firstly, a spell’s Egyptian roots werenot an impediment to the cross-cultural interests of the editors of theGreek spells and, secondly, that the editors were well versed in both theEgyptian and Hellenistic religious literature.Thus, in terms of the oppositions tradition/innovation and local/international the Demotic and Greek spells do not diverge fundamen-tally; it is rather a matter of shifting emphasis. In fact, the two cor-pora meet in those few cases that a Greek invocation is inserted intoa Demotic spell, a phenomenon that has been discussed in chapter4.4. These short invocations fit in perfectly with the corpus ofGreekMagical Papyrias regards wording, divine names andvoces magicaeand,accordingly, can be considered to be adopted from manuscripts which,if they had been preserved, would be counted among theGreek Magi-cal Papyritoday. As the language of the Demotic spells themselves lacksthe expected number of Greek lexical and syntactical borrowings, itconstitutes a purified speech register distinct from contemporary col-loquial Egyptian. Despite this apparent concern for language purity,which accords well with the negative language attitude propagated intreatise XVI of theCorpus Hermeticum, the editors of the extant spellscopied, edited and even translated Greek spells to fit them in witha number of Demotic spells. To find these Greek invocations among"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"towards a model of textual transmission291the Demotic texts is really remarkable in view of the close connec-tion between tradition, authority and ritual power in this corpus andin Egyptian magic and ritual in general. Unlike in the case of the shortNubian spell, so far no known Egyptian text expresses any kind of valuejudgement on Hellenic religion, its practitioners and the Greek lan-guage. As a result, the socio-pragmatics of this type of language alter-nation escapes straightforward interpretation. But do we need such atext?If we assume that the Greek invocations derive from the same priest-ly milieu as the Demotic spells, we could still make sense of theseinstances of code switching. As the foregoing paragraphs have demon-strated, there is every reason to do so. This means that the editors of theextant Demotic spells were simply incorporating texts that derived fromtheir own circles, although initially designed for a user group differentfrom the Demotic spells. This might be the reason that the editors didnot find problems in translating parts of the Greek spells into Demotic:in a way, it was their own material and it would remain within theirown circles. Nonetheless, the editors must have regarded the Greekspells as highly efficacious and of significant value in their own right;otherwise, they would not have made the effort to rework and incorpo-rate the material. As a matter of fact, their high esteem is borne outby the recurrence of the Sethian invocation in Greek, which combinesEgyptian mythology with Semiticvoces magicae, in three Demotic-Greekspells and another spell entirely in Greek, which, interestingly enough,is provided with an additional Demotic title. The fact that the GreekVo rl a g e nwere as highly regarded as the hieratic and Demotic, suggeststhat the Greek spells had acquired a ritual authority of their own by thetime they were incorporated into the extant Demotic spells. This couldonly have come about after some period of time, during which the textswere disseminated and used among Egyptian priests like other, by nowlost, Greek magical papyri.The latter thought brings to the fore the question of when andwhere the Demotic and Greek spells were initially composed. The twotext corpora were undoubtedly conceived in native priestly circles, butthere is no compelling reason to assume that this must have happenedin the same place and at the same time. As stated in chapter2.4,the place of origin of the extant Demotic spells is undoubtedly theTheban region because of the Theban or archaic Akhmimic dialectand the orthography of the Demotic hand. Its grammar places thetime of composition firmly in the Roman period, the late first century"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"292chapter sevenCE at the earliest. Additional information might be deduced from thetwo spells that are said to be recommended by a physician from theOxyrhynchite nome and from the spell that was allegedly praised byPaysakh, a priest of Cusae. If there is any truth in these statements, itcorroborates the idea that the Demotic spells are the product of theNile Valley, the region where pharaonic temple culture remained alivefar into the Roman period.Unfortunately, the language and orthography of the Greek spells isof no help in establishing their place and time of origin. Since theirattached pedigrees are in line with the Roman-period Hellenistic dis-course on ritual specialists, they can be dated, without being more pre-cise, securely to the Roman period. An approximateterminus post quemprovide thevoces magicaeandcharaktêres, which are attested on amuletsfrom respectively the first and second century CE onwards. Startingfrom the Hellenic overtones in the poetic structure of the incantationsof PGM XX and CXXII, Christopher A. Faraone has recently arguedthat the compilation of Greek magical spells had commenced sometimein the late Hellenistic period, in a social milieu where the processes ofHellenisation and cultural assimilation were strongly felt.4Although hedoes not define the geographical location of origin more precisely than‘close to the Mediterranean’, he is clearly inclined to accept Alexan-dria as the most likely candidate. In view of the fact that Alexandriawas home to a mixed and, in a way, displaced population, the city musthave been a melting pot, where various ethnic groups with differing cul-tural norms and religious outlooks were competing for power, prestigeand identity. It is most certainly conceivable that it was a fertile envi-ronment for the production of cross-cultural texts that continue certainritual and textual traditions of prestige and, at the same time, zero in ona new religious market, where phenomena such as astrology, initiationand personal contact with the divine are gaining ground at the expenseof age-old types of communal religion.The Greek spells preserved in the two manuscripts under studyclearly present a later development than the two anthologies studiedby Faraone. Nonetheless, it is also most likely that they originated inan environment where Egyptian and Hellenistic culture intertwined ina productive way and where a Hellenised clientele was to be found.In the Roman period, such settings existed in many places through-4Faraone, ‘Handbooks and Anthologies’,212f."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"towards a model of textual transmission293out the country, such as in the Fayum region and Hellenistic citiessuch as Hermopolis, Oxyrhynchus, Panopolis, Ptolemais and, of course,Alexandria. Since the lexicographer Phamphilus, who lived and workedin first century CE Alexandria, knew the coded ingredients as nativepriestly jargon, it is clear that the required source material was avail-able in Alexandria. In addition, Pamphilus regarded the prophets asa category alongside Demokritos, Ostanes, Pythagoras and Zoroaster,which proves that the required readership could be found in Alexan-dria. Whatever the case, it is clear from found amulets and inscribedlamellaedating from the first century CE onward that these kind ofspells must soon have become popular among the Hellenised popu-lation of the country and that the spells were reworked and expandedat will.Since the development of the Greek spells started as early as thelate Hellenistic period and the grammar of the extant Demotic spellsdates to the late first century CE at the earliest, it cannot be ruled outthat the Demotic spells originated sometime after the Greek spells. Thissuggestion is of particular significance, because one would expect spellswritten in the traditional Egyptian language and scripts to precedesimilar spells written in the language of the dominant foreign elite. Itmight simply be a matter of archaeological chance that earlier Demoticspells of this type have not been found, but it might also be true thatthey never existed until well into the Roman period. I like to arguethat, contrary to the commonly held view, the Demotic spells did notdevelop organically from pharaonic magic over a long stretch of time,the stages of which cannot be followed due to a complete lack ofpreserved sources. Instead, they were written against the background ofthe Greek spells, which were composed by Egyptian priests anyway andcirculated throughout the country starting in the Hellenistic period.This model of textual transmission explains why the Demotic spells,although firmly rooted in magical techniques of the pharaonic period,constitute a type of spell that was somewhat different from earlier,mainly apotropaeic, pharaonic magical spells. It also explains why anumber of short Greek invocations were inserted in the Demotic spellswithout apparent problems on the part of editors and users: this was amatter of incorporating primary material into secondary material. Asthe base language of the genre, these Greek spells by definition carriedritual authority for this type of spells.With this model of textual transmission, the peculiar combination ofspells in Demotic and Greek in two associated manuscripts written in"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"294chapter seventhe Theban region can be explained as follows. At a certain momentin the early Roman period, Egyptian priests of the Theban region gotacquainted with the new type of magical spells in Greek through theirbusiness travels to Alexandria or similar Hellenised cities in the Nilevalley. They undertook, for example, the submission of temple accountsand petitions or assisted in religious festivals. On return to Thebes tak-ing the Greek spells with them, they studied them and wrote similarspells in their own dialect and script for their own priestly circles. How-ever, these Demotic spells were no slavish translations of the Greekspells. On the contrary, older texts in hieratic and Demotic were alsotaken into account to create a wholly new Demotic genre in the samevein as the Greek spells, without being identical. In this fashion, theTheban priests succeeded in bending the Hellenised Egyptian magic totheir will. Since the Greek spells were the primary material, the Hel-lenised images of Egyptian priests were not deleted in the course of sev-eral stages of editing, so that, sometime in the second or third centuryCE, a scribe copied Greek spells that were actually composed for a Hel-lenised clientele next to Demotic spells that aimed at a more traditionalnative user group. There was truly no problem in doing so, because, inthe end, the two text corpora present only two different realizations ofthe same phenomenon. Seen in this light the two manuscripts turn outto be not only a testimony of the multicultural society of the Hellenisticworld in general and Greco-Roman Egypt in particular, but also a cre-ative attempt on the part of a group of Egyptian priests in the Thebanregion of the second and third century CE to combine, incorporate andmanipulate various cultural and religious traditions in order to createan identity that was appropriate for and meaningful within their time,when traditional social structures and religious viewpoints underwentimportant changes."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"APPENDICESAppendix1The following table provides an overview of the spells of P.

Since the word occurs in alist of vegetable products; I consider the first suggestion improbable.13I thank Klaas A. Worp for suggesting the following new interpretation to me. Theword in ‘cipher’, *skamounarin*, is a garbled form ofσκαμμων\tρι\u0010ν, which derivesin turn fromσκαμμων\u0014αwith the diminutive suffix-αρι\u0010ν.Asin\u0010Rν\u0010ς/\u0010\u0003ν\tρι\u0010ν,thesuffix has lost its diminutive meaning, so that the wordσκαμμων\tρι\u0010ν(thus far notattested in the Greek dictionaries) is basically a synonym for ‘scammony’; for parallelconstructions, see, Leonard R. Palmer,A Grammar of the Post-Ptolemaic Papyri(London1945)83,88.
