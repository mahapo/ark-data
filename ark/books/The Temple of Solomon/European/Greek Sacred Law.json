Part I was conceived as a practicalguide to the corpus of Greek sacred laws for the general classicist ratherthan a theoretical exposition. It is meant to introduce the evidence bymeans of the evidence itself, and I therefore had to limit the footnotesand the references to scholarship.My primary aim in part II was to collect and republish the sacredlaws from mainland Greece, the colonies, and the islands, with theexception of Cos, published after the appearance of SokolowskiÕsLoissacrées des cités grecquesin1969. I have, nevertheless, included two inscrip-tions (nos.11and13) which were published in the1960s. Inscriptionsfrom Cos and Asia Minor are not included, but I have added checklistsof signiÞcant new documents. I have left out any inscriptions includedin SokolowskiÕs corpus, even when they were enriched by new frag-ments or improved considerably in respect to readings. A list of somesuch inscriptions is to be found, however, in Appendix B3. Also addedare concordances for the various parts of the corpus (for which see PartI pp.3Ð4).The principles that guided me in making the present selection arestated in part I pp.4Ð9.Itsuffices to note here that an occasionalstipulation on the subject of religion or cult practice does not neces-sarily qualify a document as a sacred law. Some cases are admittedlyundecided. On the whole, I have avoided including here a number offragments where identiÞcation as sacred laws depends entirely uponinference or restorations and/or is not backed up by deÞnite parallels.21N(ew) G(reek) S(acred) L(aws); this abbreviation was suggested to H.S.

The exclusion is somewhat artiÞcial; rectifying the situation must,however, await a revision of the entire corpus.FormatEach chapter comprises the following parts: lemma, text, translation,restorations, epigraphical commentary, and commentary.Lemma. The lemma contains a brief description of the stone, itsÞndspot, including, when this is possible, the archaeological context,measurements, current location of the stone, and a list of publications ofthe text, relevant discussions, and published photographs of the stone.Derivative editions (i.e. those not based on an autopsy) are listed inparentheses.I have done my best to Þnd editions and discussions of the docu-ments included here. I may have failed to do so in more than onecase. As for discussions, I have listed only relevant discussions, be theyshort or long. I am afraid that I have not found an ideal way to treatreviews or short notices regarding works that discuss the inscriptions inquestion. On the whole, they are mentioned in the lemma if they addsomething to the discussion by opposing a given authorÕs point or by areasoned endorsement of it or when the work cited cannot be consid-ered readily available. The bulk of Part II was Þnished by early2002.Imance does not seem to me to justify its inclusion (see in this respect Part I p.101).SEGXL123. Athens. Sacred Regulations?SEGXXXVI703=SEGXL624.

Later bibliography has been citedonly occasionally. This is probably most notable in such popular docu-ments as nos.1and27which have generated a great deal of discussion.4Works cited in the lemma are usually discussed in the appropriateplace in the commentary. When this is not the case, and/or when thecontents of the work cited are not immediately clear from its title, theyare indicated in a footnote.Measurements. All measurements are in meters.Editorial Conventions. I have followed the Leiden system as revised bySterling Dow in hisConventions in Editing, Durham, NC,1969,3Ð13.5Stoichedonandboustrophedoninscriptions are clearly marked asΣΤ\u0016Ι\u0018.orΒ\u0016ΥΣΤΡ\u0016ΦΗΔ\u0016Ν(no.6isSchlangenschrift). The rubric NON-ΣΤ\u0016Ι\u0018. has only been used to mark non-stoichedoninscriptions, wherethestoichedonorder could be expected (the sides of no.1; nos.9,13,21).Otherwise, non-stoichedoninscriptions are not marked as such.Restorations. When most of the restorations belong to the same per-son(s), it has seemed best to state this at the beginning (i.e. suppl(evit/everunt) X). It is to be understood that all unnamed restorations thatfollow belong to this primary authority. Otherwise, restorations aremarked by the name of the restorer. Thus (e.g.) in no.1, line11the read-ing Ô11DauxÕ would indicate that everything in line11was restored byDaux. My own restorations or comments, when this is not clear fromthe context, are marked by ÔL.Õ Restorations are traced to their origin.Obsolete restorations are generally avoided.I have, on the whole, attempted not to indulge in gratuitous restora-tions only to note that they are doubtful and that alternatives areequally possible. One might complain that I have exercised too muchcaution with restorations and that, in certain cases, I print less textthan previous editions, thus forcing the user to Þsh for restorationsin the apparatus and reattach them to the text. It seems to me that4In this respect I particularly regret that I have not been able to use G. Ekroth,The Sacrificial Rituals of Greek Hero-Cults in the Archaic to the Early Hellenistic Periods(KernosSuppl.12), Liege,2002, of which I was informed as the present work was going topress.5I have not used DowÕs ÔÞrst/second textÕ (ibid.7Ð8) notation, printed above theline, for rasurae. The reader should consult the epigraphical commentary for textprinted within double square brackets. I have also not followed DowÕs suggested system(ibid.29Ð31) of question marks noting the level of certainty in restorations."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xivprefacean editor should make a clear distinction between interpretation andrestoration. On the whole, many sacred laws use identical, well-deÞnedformulas much less frequently than certain kinds of decrees. In manycases, a correct restoration depends upon a correct understanding ofa cultic context, where details are not always fully known. Even whenseveral documents deal with one cult, sharing, perhaps, similarities inthe way they regulate it, they may still formulate these regulationsindependently. Comparative evidence, which may prove invaluable forthe interpretation of a certain fragmentary document, will thus notnecessarily yield much help for the actual restoration of the text.Epigraphical Commentary. When possible, the epigraphical commentaryis based on my own autopsy. Otherwise, it is derivative and meant toserve little more than the readerÕs immediate needs. I have normallynot described letter forms when I was able to provide a readablephotograph. Comments on dotted letters in a secure textual context(e.g.[μ].ηδ\u0013in4.9) have generally been avoided.Translations. Translations are mine. I must, nevertheless, stress mydebt to former translations (whenever these exist). I have attemptedto make the translations literal yet readable. It may be claimed thatin some cases my translation is too similar to a former one. It should,however, be noted that in some cases there are only so many ways totranslate a word or a phrase literally. In such cases there seemed tobe no point in attempting a different translation merely for the sakeof variation. I have used square brackets ([ ]) only occasionally in thetranslations. Wholly restored words are included within square brack-ets, but I avoided using them in partially restored words when I foundthe restoration convincing. Interpretative additions to the translationsare included in parentheses. The translations should be seen as an inte-gral part of the commentary; they thus represent my interpretation ofthe texts. It cannot be overstressed that the translations should never beused without the text.Commentary. In most chapters, the commentary includes general re-marks followed by line-by-line commentary. On the whole, I tried toconcentrate on the religious aspects of the documents. Nevertheless,when the context is less familiar, I have included comments on otheraspects as well. Thus, it seemed proper to comment on references to(e.g.) Rhodian tribes or the Samian calendar, whereas similar commentson (e.g.) Attic archons or demes seemed superßuous.Date. The date is discussed in the commentary at the end of thegeneral remarks, where it is also noted if the date is discussed elsewhere."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"prefacexvBibliography. To keep the general bibliography within reasonable lim-its, I have usually avoided incorporating into it works, mainly books butoccasionally articles, which are cited only once or twice or those whichare used in a limited context only. When a work is cited more than oncein a particular context, I have sometimes referred to it by ibid. or op.cit. I have, however, done so only in consecutive or adjacent footnotes,so that tracing the original reference should not be difficult.Short notes and reviews are ordinarily not cited in the general bibli-ography.Bibliographical References. Reference in the commentary is given pri-marily to works that are included in the lemma and to those that Ihave used as the basis for my arguments. I have tried to refer to worksthat include further bibliographical referencesÑand mostly to worksthat are generally accessibleÑbut it seemed pointless to refer the readerconstantly to standard works such asRE, orLIMC, which are referredto only when I relied on them myself.I have attempted to credit works that referred me to relevant sources(ordinarily in parentheses). I do not doubt that I have failed to do sooccasionally. Normally, I have not credited works in such a way when Ireached my sources independently.Epigraphical References. When reference is made to a restoration, itappears normally in square brackets (e.g. [LSCG151A62]).When the date cited for an inscription included in SokolowskiÕs cor-pus differs from the date assigned to it therein, the source for the dateis commonly cited in parentheses (e.g.LSCG15(IGI37; ca.460Ð450)).Standard corpora references for inscriptions included in SokolowskiÕscorpus are otherwise rarely cited in the text; they can be found in Con-cordance1below. Reference to one or more later editions is usuallycited in Part I for inscriptions included inLGSbut not in SokolowskiÕscorpus.Old Testament and Mishnaic References. All Old Testament and Mishnaiccitations refer to the original texts.In reference to the Mishnah I have, for the beneÞt of the uninitiated,cited both the tractate (in italics) and (in parentheses) the order, e.g.Mishnah (Qodashim)Midot3.4.Abbreviations. Abbreviations of works and periodicals are primarilythose given inAJA104,2000:10Ð24.

Regardingnames, I have tried to follow the forms used in the second and thirdeditions of theOxford Classical Dictionary. Otherwise, names are usuallytransliterated. In such cases k is used for Greekκ, y for Greekυ,and ch for Greek\".

Prott was responsible for sacriÞcial calendars and lawsgoverning the cult of the Hellenistic monarchs. The Þrst fascicle con-taining the calendars was published in1896, but the author died beforecompleting the second; ruler cult has subsequently been kept out of thecorpus. Ziehen, entrusted with all other documents, published a Þrstvolume containing the laws of Greece and the islands in1906;apro-jected second volume, containing the laws of Asia Minor, was neverpublished. Incomplete as it is and by now outdated in many respects,Prott and ZiehenÕsLeges Graecorum Sacrae(LGSI and II) has never quitebeen surpassed and remains invaluable today.In the second half of the twentieth century Greek sacred law cameto be associated Þrst and foremost with a single scholar, FranciszekSokolowski. SokolowskiÕs Þrst undertaking was to supplementLGSbycollecting the sacred laws of Asia Minor which resulted in the publica-tion ofLois sacrées de l’Asie mineure(LSAM) in1955. This volume was fol-lowed in1962byLois sacrées des cités grecques: Supplément(LSS), includingnew documents not included inLGSandLSAM, but excluding Coandocuments. Seven years later, in1969, Sokolowski published the lastvolume of his corpus,Lois sacrées des cités grecques(LSCG), constituting arevision ofLGS, which it never meant to replace entirely,2and includingCoan documents.3SokolowskiÕs volumes, especiallyLSCG,4have attracted much criti-cism. Though some of the points commonly raised are undeniablytrue, particularly the tendency to introduce into the text restorationswhich, as ingenious as they sometimes are, may (inter alia) be in dis-agreement with the stones, anyone who has tried to produce a corpusof his own cannot but admire the author for his unparalleled knowl-edge of Greek religion, his profound understanding of the documents1Latin Ioannes.2LSCGp.

SokolowskiÕs three volumes with their succinct indices are a usefulresearch tool.The latest addition to the corpus is Georges RougemontÕs masterly1977collection of Delphic documents,Lois sacrées et règlements religieux,published as the Þrst volume of the Corpus des inscriptions de Delphes(CIDI).The various editors have brießy accounted for the principles whichguided them in making their selections, in their introductions.5It isadvisable to summarize such principles and discuss the deÞnition ofsacred law here.Since a set of rules governing Greek cult practice has not been hand-ed over to us, an obvious way of getting closer to attaining it is to collectthe surviving individual documents, inscribed mainly on stone,6whichrecord such rules directly. These documents, commonly classiÞed asle-ges sacrae(vel sim.) in epigraphical corpora, may indeed form the core ofthe corpus of Greek sacred laws, and relevance to actual cult practice isusually a good criterion for the inclusion or exclusion of ambiguous cas-es. But the corpus of Greek sacred laws is, in fact, much more diverse,and the term sacred law7itself, as it is used inclusively in this corpus,transcends common epigraphical genres, being, to an extent, an arti-Þcial modern construct, albeit drawing upon ancient precedents.8Thecorpus contains a diverse assortment of laws, decrees, statutes, regula-tions, proclamations, treaties, contracts, leases, testaments, foundationdocuments, and oracles. These may be issued by federations, states,civic subdivisions and magistrates, royalty, sanctuaries, religious organi-zations, or private individuals. The documents come from throughoutthe Greek world, from around the beginning of the sixth century B.C.9to the Roman Imperial period, varying in length from a few words tothe194lines of the regulations of the Andanian mysteries,LSCG65.105LGSI p.1;LGSII pp. IIIÐIV;LSAMp.5; cf.184;LSSp.5;LSCGpp. VIIÐVIII;CIDI pp.1Ð4.6Documents which survived in one form or another in literary sources (such asAthenaeus234e-f) have never been included in the corpus.7Lex sacra; cf. loi sacrŽ, heilige Gesetz, Kultusgesetz, vel sim.8A discussion of the contents of the modern corpus seems to me to be a prerequi-site for a discussion (not pursued here) of\u0006ερ#ς ν#μ%ςin antiquity.9As below no.6.10Cf.

When Greek sacred law is concerned,these must be Greek, and relevant documents such as the law from theHerodian temple in Jerusalem18are to be left out.These basic requirements are, however, not enough and deservefurther qualiÞcation, as might be illustrated through an examinationof two documents. Both are decrees regarding construction or repair ofsanctuary fountain houses; one,LSCG75, is included in the corpus; theother,I.Oropos290, is not.The third-century B.C. decree from Orchomenus,LSCG75, verybrießy prescribes the construction of a fountain house for the bene-Þt of citizens offering sacriÞce at a sanctuary of Zeus Meilichios. Themuch longer Athenian decree,I.Oropos290(369/8B.C.), which honorsAntikrates of Decelea, a priest of Amphiaraus, discusses several mea-sures to be taken on the occasion of repair work to be made to the foun-tain and the baths at the Amphiareum and the installation of a marblestele inscribed withsyngraphai(appended in lines29Ð77), and describesin great detail the work and the conditions according to which it hasbeen leased out. The decree prescribes the use of sacred money, col-lected in the sanctuaryÕsthesauros(treasury box), and money from shopsfor inscribing the stele, for anaresterion(a special sacriÞce upon makingalterations to divine property),19and for reimbursing theneokoros; theremaining sums are to be transferred to a contractor through those incharge of the repair works (lines13Ð25).Both documents meet the two basic requirements outlined above:they contain prescriptions of, as it happens, occasional actions pertain-ing to religion and cult practice. Yet while the measures speciÞed inLSCG75are the core of the document, the professed object ofI.Oropos290is neither the allocation of sacred monies nor the offering of the16As inLSCG133.3(ca.400B.C.),134.8(fourth century B.C.), and the RomanImperialLSCG52.5,21,24andLSAM88.4Ð5; cf.IGXII5,15.

The religious measures, important as they are, consist of actionsperformed for this end, and thus occupy a secondary place in the entiredocument. The inscription is an indispensable piece of evidence for cer-tain aspects of Greek cult practice; it is not, however, a clear-cut case ofa sacred law but at best a borderline case. A line must be drawn some-where, however, and Sokolowski is justiÞed in leavingI.Oropos290outof the corpus.To the basic principles discussed above one must therefore add thatit is incumbent upon documents which are to be included in the corpusthat matters pertaining to religion and cult practice be less a means toan end and more an end in their own right, occupying an indisputableÞrst place. As a result, some of the documents included in the corpus (astraditionally constituted) are, in fact, excerpts from longer inscriptions.This was avoided in the present collection, out of the belief that aninscription is better presented and studied as a whole.Another issue should also be observed, though its application is notquite consistent. Traditionally, not each and every document regulatingcult performance is included in the corpus of sacred laws. The cor-pus usually avoids documents that regulate extraordinary sacriÞces andeven festivals which, divine sponsorship aside, do not assume the formof straightforward divine worship. A famous example (and one which isnot beyond question in my mind) is the Coan decree of ca.278B.C.,Syll.3398, regarding a thanksgiving sacriÞce to Pythian Apollo at Del-phi and corresponding festivities for him, Zeus Soter, and Nike in Cos,on the occasion of the expulsion of the Gauls from Delphi.20Anotherexample is the Coan decreeSEGXXXIII675(=Iscr.CosED5; ca. midÞrst half of the second century B.C.) on sacriÞce to all the gods andgoddesses, in particular Zeus Megistos, Homonoia, and Zeus Boulaios(inter alios), for the safety of the demos and the Cappadocian royalcouple, Ariarathes IV Eusebes and Antiochis, which I have not listedamong new Coan sacred laws in Appendix B2. On the other hand,LSAM81and no.26below have been included in the corpus, becausethey institute festivals to be incorporated into the local religious calen-dars; although these festivals commemorate events of a primarily civicimpetus, they do so within the framework of the cult of Homonoia.20See S.M.

One notes, however, that all the cases included in the cor-pus, even those which bluntly commemorate the founders or their rel-atives,23set the cult within a recognized framework of divine worship.24Documents concerned with the straightforward cult of the living or ofthe dead,25including all documents concerned withbona fideruler cult,26are left out of the corpus.To sum up, to qualify as a sacred law, in the way this term is usedin the existing corpus of Greek sacred laws, an inscription must beprescriptive; its subject matter and main focus must be or pertain toreligion and particularly to cult practice, on the whole recurrent innature, or at least set within the framework of ordinary worship. Real-ity is, however, more complex and leaves some room for interpreta-tion. Though many cases are sufficiently clear, the Þnal decision asto whether or not to admit a given document into the corpus mayat times depend on a variety of factors, including personal judgment.LGSincludes not less than seventeen documents which Sokolowski pre-ferred, for better and for worse, to leave out.27CIDI includes two moresuch documents,28and excludes Þve others.29I would have avoided21Rather than Pergamum: L.

A classiÞcation of the documents according to their respectivegenres may be justiÞed, though misleading, as documents of differentgenres may deal with similar matters. Here we concentrate rather onthe range of issues covered by the documents assembled in the cor-pus, on the whole adhering to the scheme of four main classes, namelysacred space (mainly sanctuaries), sacred officials (mostly priests), per-formance of cult (a particularly diverse class), and religious events (fes-tivals and ceremonies).31Admittedly, there are numerous cases in whichmore than one subject is handled by a single document, and much inthe evidence deÞes clear-cut classiÞcation. We follow the sacred space-sacred officials-cult performance-religious events scheme here if onlyfor the sake of a general review. Though we mainly aim at review-ing issues recurring in the documents, it is worthwhile, as far as possi-ble, to attempt to consider the formal classiÞcation of the documentsand, to an extent, the range of genres associated with the respectiveissues.Sanctuaries and Sacred SpaceComprehensive and SpeciÞc DocumentsA handful of documents have reached us which discuss the manage-ment of individual sanctuaries in a general and comprehensive way.The best example is the great set of regulations (the document does30See below pp.34Ð35; on the other hand, I would have liked the corpus to be moreinclusive in respect to documents prescribing the building and furnishing of sanctuariesand temples.31With some variations, this scheme is of course not uncommon; StengelÕsDiegriechischen Kultusaltertümeris particularly noteworthy; cf. also the arrangement used inthe section on religion in the third volume of theSylloge Inscriptionum Graecarum."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"10part onenot refer to itself by a more speciÞc term)32from the Amphiareumat Oropus,LSCG69.33As comprehensive as it is, it still takes intoaccount through cross-reference a law which, judging from the con-text, expounded upon (perhaps inter alia) the activity of a cult official,namely theneokoros. The priest of Amphiaraus, who is required (lines2Ð6) to visit the sanctuary from the end of the winter until the periodof the ploughing, missing no more than three days at a time34and stay-ing at the sanctuary for not less ten days per month, is instructed (lines6Ð8):*παναγκ\u0010+ειν τ\u0012ν ν-εωκ#ρ%ν τ%/ τε \u0006ερ%/ *πιμελε0σ1αι κατ\u0003 τ\u0012-ν ν#μ%ν κα2 τ3ν 4(ικνεμ\u0013νων ε5ς τ\u0012 \u0006ερ#ν6to compel theneokoros(sanctuary attendant) to take care of the sanctuaryand of the visitors to the sanctuary according to the law.35The document goes on to discuss (lines9Ð20)offences committed onthe premises, related Þnes for offenders, their payments, cases tried atthe sanctuary and presided over by the priest, and those tried else-where. There follow (lines20Ð24,36Ð48) some basic rules for incuba-tion, the staple cult activity of the Amphiareum, including a stipulationregarding the publication of the names of the incubants; in between(lines25Ð36) there is a discussion of public and private sacriÞce, includ-ing a reference to the local festival; the function and prerogatives ofthe priest are considered and on the spot consumption of the meat isprescribed. Little can be made of the remains on the stone past line48, but the scope of the surviving part suggests that the document wasenvisioned, and doubtless functioned, as a general code touching uponmost, if not all, aspects of day-to-day administration of the activities atthe Amphiareum.The decree of Demetrias concerning the oracular sanctuary of Apol-lo at Korope in Magnesia (LSCG83; ca.100B.C.) gives a similar im-32Unless theν#μ%ιin line39refer back to the regulations of lines20Ð24.33Cf. the fragmentaryLSS35.34BuckÕsGDp.195translation.35Thisν#μ%ςis probably an actual written law (or an injunction in a law) although,as A.B.

While it contains inter-esting details about the cult (lines30Ð49), it is not quite interested inthe function of the oracle. As Louis Robert has shown,36its main objec-tive is maintaining orderly behavior (ε7κ%σμ8αlines17,51cf.κ%σμ8ωςline39) and proper procedure in consultation, if need be, through theaid of9α\u000fδ%/\"%ι(staff-bearers, i.e. security officers, lines24Ð26,50Ð51),though it is not so much concerned with worshippers as with ensur-ing that magistrates perform their proper duties. Comprehensive doc-uments comparable to the Amphiareum law (to be distinguished fromcases in which different documents relating to the same sanctuary areinscribed on the same stone, likeLSAM12and35) are, in fact, rare,though the state of preservation of many of the stones may bear someof the blame for that. Here we will consider two more cases.LSCG36(mid-fourth century B.C.) is a decree of the deme of Pei-raeus regulating activities at the local Thesmophorion which, as welearn from the publication clause, was to be set upπρ\u0012ς τ:ι 4να\u000f\u0010σει(ascent)τ%/ Θεσμ%(%ρ8%υ(23Ð24). The stone, the upper part of which islost, forbids (lines3Ð12), probably out of a concern for the rights of thepriestess, the freeing of slaves, gatherings ofthiasoi, setting up dedica-tions, performing puriÞcation, or approaching the altars or themegaronwithout the priestess, unless on festival days (the Thesmophoria, thePrerosia, the Kalamaia, and the Skira),κα2 ε< τινα =λλην >μ\u0013|ραν συν-\u0013ρ\"%νται α\u0006 γυνα0κες κα|τ\u0003 τ\u0003 π\u0010τρια.37Cross-reference is employed forthe discussion of transgressions. The demarch is instructed to imposeÞnes and take the transgressors to court according to Ôthe laws gov-erning such mattersÕ (\"ρ\tμεν%ν τ%0ς ν#μ%ι|ς %\u0006 κε0νται περ2 τ%?τωνlines16Ð17).

SacriÞce is to be performed only in the presence ofthe founder who takes care to assert his rights: failure to comply wouldrender sacriÞce unacceptable to the god. Those who wish to found aneranos43are welcome to it with good luck as long as they comply withthe rules. XanthusÕ intimate relations with the god enable him to inter-weave the regulations with exhortations such asκα2 ε7ε8λατ%ς|γ\u0013ν%ιτ%A 1ε\u0012ς τ%0ς 1εραπε?%υσιν BπλC: τC: ψυ\"C:,44the likes of which are moresuggestive of the Bible than of Greek sacred law.45Despite obvious differences, XanthusÕ document shares basic fea-tures with the documents from the Amphiareum and from the PiraeusThesmophorion. All present the sanctuary as functioning accordingto a given set of rules, be they divine, human, or a combination ofboth; immediate jurisdiction exists, exercised by speciÞc functionaries,accountable as they may be to a higher authority. This highest author-ity is the one issuing the documents. At the time whenLSCG69wasenacted, the highest authority at the Amphiareum was the city of Oro-pus, though the control over the sanctuary kept changing for the nexthundred years or so.46Immediate authority is invested in theneokorosand in the priest. The body issuingLSCG36is the deme of Peiraeus;legal matters are the province of the demarch;47day-to-day authorityover cult performance is evidently invested in the priestess. In the caseofLSCG55the issuer is a private individual who also possesses immedi-ate jurisdiction, acting, as he emphasizes, on behalf of the god himself.The considerable differences between the three documents, manifestin their respective issuing bodies, are further evident in the type and41See Lane loc. cit.42For cathartic requirements see below p.15.43See below commentary on no.5.44May the god be very merciful to those serving him with innocent soul (lines11Ð12).45See S.

Each document attempts to touch the mainaspects of these activities, and this ultimately accounts for the respectiveidiosyncrasies.Type and scope of local activities are to be counted among theformative elements which characterize evidence elsewhere. This is asdiscernible in comprehensive documents as it is in less comprehen-sive ones, be their primary focus cult performance48or matters ofan administrative character. The regulations concerningtheoroifromAndros (LSS38) elaborating on their maintenance and conduct; thetreaty between Delphi and Skiathos (LSS41), discussing cultic taxes andgranting Skiathos (lines24Ð27) the provision of ahestiatorion,49wood,vinegar, and salt for sacriÞcial meals; the document regulating the cultictax of Phaselis (LSS39); or the decree of thekoinonof the Asclepiadai ofCos and Cnidus (LSS42)50are all dependent upon the status of Delphi,the scope of local cult activities, and the ensuing need to regulate andaccommodate the activity of foreign visitors.

Such issues are likely to affect documents coming from otherpopular, massively attended sanctuaries serving less speciÞc cultic ends,such as the Samian Heraion.52The range of documents coming fromall such sanctuaries is, on the other hand, likely to differ from thoseemanating from local sanctuaries serving a speciÞc constituency suchas the unknown, privately founded Attic sacred precinct of Asclepiusand Hygieia which produced the eleven-line boundary marker with cultregulations,LSCG54(Þrst century A.D.), addressing farmers and neigh-bors who are encouraged to sacriÞce to the gods according to custom(Iι 1\u0013μιςline6).48Discussed below.49Dining room; see (e.g.) M.S.

The obvious way to maintain purity is for a sanctuaryto inform worshippers of its cathartic policies upon entry by means ofinscriptions.54The Andania Mysteries regulations,LSCG65, are veryexplicit in this respect (line37):4ναγραψ\u0010ντω δ\u0005 κα2 4(J Kν δε0 κα1αρ8+ειν κα2 L μM δε0 N\"%ντας ε5σπ%ρε?-εσ1αι.They shall write and post things which require puriÞcation and whateverone ought not to have when entering the sanctuary.Inscriptions bearing such information may be placed in more than onelocation in the sanctuary, particularly at entrances, in order to achievemaximum exposure. In fact, a few such laws have reached us in morethan one copy.55A document from Ialysus,LSCG136, from around300B.C., is instructive in this respect. It features a law (lines19Ð35)entitled (19Ð21):53As regards prohibitions and requirements from worshippers, a number of theissues reviewed here have been recently discussed in Dillon1997, mainly chapter6,which also discusses requirements related to cult performance reviewed below in thesection on cult performance.54Such inscriptions are akin to signs still posted in places of worship regarding suchmatters as dress or conduct.55Examples are mentioned below."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"greek sacred law15ν#μ%ς L %7\" Oσι%ν *σ8μειν %7δ\u0005*σ(\u0013ρειν *ς τ\u0012 5ερ\u0012ν κα2 τ\u0012 τ\u0013-μεν%ς τPς JΑλεκτρ\tνας.Law; things of which entering or carrying into the sanctuary and pre-cinct of Alektrona56is not allowed.57The list mentions pack animals, footwear and anything made from pigs(sheep are discussed in lines30Ð33) as sources of pollution.58The law ispreceded by a decree (1Ð18), which not only states its purpose as puri-fying the sanctuary and precinct of Alektrona according to the ances-tral customs (lines3Ð5), but also ordains that three different stones beinscribed with the law and be placed at the entrance on the city side,above thehestiatorion,59and at the descent from the acropolis of Ialy-sus (lines5Ð18).60As the quote from the Andania regulations suggests,cathartic requirements and forbidden items are most frequently listedin comparable documents. More rare are prohibitions concerning spe-ciÞc classes of people. A given document may deal with a single topicor more, varying in particular details depending upon the cult and thepersonal taste and preferences of the divinities in question.61Cathartic Requirements. Documents listing cathartic requirements typi-cally list the source of pollution contracted (most frequently sexual in-tercourse, menstruation, childbirth, miscarriage, contact with a corpse,or certain foods) and, in most cases, the amount of time needed to passbefore entry to the sanctuary is allowed; a puriÞcatory measure such asa shower is sometimes prescribed.SeeLSCG55.3Ð7andIGII21365.8Ð11;LSCG95;124;139;171.16Ð17;LSS54;59;91;106,108;119; cf.118;LSAM12I;18;29;51; cf.20; below no.7and commentary for a discussion.Alongside detailed prerequisites, there are a few laws which aresatisÞed with a general requirement such asLSAM35.3Ð5:56See Morelli1959,89Ð90.

Regulations con-cerning manure, mainly prohibitions against dumping it on sanctu-ary grounds (contrast the380B.C. law of the Delphic amphictyony,LSCG78.21, which appears to forbid carrying manure out from thesacred land), are, in fact, quite common.LSS53,a202B.C. decreefrom Delos clearly declares its purpose: puriÞcation has been takennear the altar of Dionysus; in order to maintain the purity of theplace and of the precinct of Leto, dumping of[κ#|πρ%]ν, here prob-ably waste from sacriÞcial animals, and ofσπ%δ#ς(ashes) is forbidden(lines7Ð8); penalties are prescribed as usual.130InLSCG67responsibil-ities concerning manure at the sanctuary of Athena Alea in Tegea areassigned to thedamiourgos.

One of the earliest known sacred laws,LSS27141from Argos (575Ð550?),142aims to protect sacred implementsdedicated to Athena Polias from private use outside the precinct (cf.LSCG116.22Ð25); they are to be used by the state for cult performance.The law stipulates their repair in the event of damage, assigning carefor these matters to theamphipolos, a cult official probably identical withthe better knownneokoros.143Cult officials are frequently charged withresponsibility for sacred equipment.LSS127(Athens; Roman Imperialperiod) provides a good illustration for aπαρ\u0010δ%σις144requiring a priest-ess to hand over to her successor an inventory of the equipment withwhich she is entrusted upon entering her office.LSAM11.18Ð22and thefragmentaryLSCG144are also signiÞcant in this respect.

Abuse of dedications may be covered by documents whichprotect sacred equipment in general.145A short document from Lory-ma,LSAM74, (third century B.C.) is concerned with dedications in itsentirety. They should not be carried out nor should they be harmed.The rest of the stone is badly damaged; if the rather reasonable restora-tions are accepted, it also restricted their placement.Dedication and Placement of Objects. Dedication of objects in certainsanctuaries was so extensive that it had to be restricted and regulatedto prevent the sanctuaries or speciÞc areas inside them from being cov-ered or cluttered up with dedications. A third-century B.C. decree fromRhodes,LSS107, aims at stopping requests to dedicate statues andother objects in the sanctuary of Asclepius; requests for dedications ina deÞned area and where they block theperipatoi(covered walkways)are forbidden; dedications nevertheless placed there shall be relocated;the decree shall be displayed in the precinct. A contemporary decreefrom Miletus,LSS123, forbids placing in the sanctuary of Apollo Del-phinios any votive tablet (π8ναU)146or other dedications in the so-callednew stoa, where they damage the woodwork or the columns; an alter-native location is speciÞed; offenders face a Þne of ten staters sacredto Apollo.147A second-century B.C. document from Athens,LSCG43,ordains the removal to a stoa of dedications which obstruct the cultstatue or are not worthy of the sanctuary.148An entirely different aspect of dedications is treated inLSAM62from Mylasa (I.Mylasa301; end of the second century B.C.), a decreeof the tribe of Hyarbesytai requiring tribesmen whom the tribe hon-ors to dedicate within six months to Zeus of Hyarbesytai a silver cup145See above pp.25(Þre) and30(sacred implements).

The prescriptions affect also members of other tribeshonored by the present one, but the number of objects and their worthis tripled. An attempt to undo the decree would result in a penalty of3000drachmas. The practice prescribed is not exceptional; the docu-ment is.149Reuse of Dedications. Whereas damaging or stealing dedications is agrave offence,150they may be reused for a higher cause. The corpuscontains three documents, all of them decrees,LSCG41(221Ð220B.C.)and42(second century B.C.), both from the sanctuary of the HeroDoctor at Athens,151andLSCG70(I.Oropos324; late third century B.C.)from the Amphiareum at Oropus, concerning the creation of new cultimplements through melting down metal dedications.152A certain pro-cedure is followed with few changes in all three cases. It can be summa-rized as follows: inasmuch as some cult implements have become wornand are no longer of use, or the offering of new objects is otherwisedesired, it is decided to furnish the divinity with new implements bymelting down old dedicated objects; a special committee is appointedto compile an inventory of these, recording the weight of each objectandÑshould it be inscribedÑthe details of the dedicator; repairs maybe made when possible; otherwise, objects are melted down to cre-ate the new implements; inventories of the melted objects (omitted inLSCG) are published together with the decrees describing the proce-dure. To keep the Hero Doctor content,LSCG41.45Ð47adds a specialsacriÞce, anaresterion,153to the program. Evidently the purpose of thepublication of these decrees is not quite to prescribe the procedureÑthe inventories, if nothing else, suggest publicationpost factum154Ñbut toaccount for the proper execution of what might be seen as an abuseof divine property (with respect to the actions of those involved) and to149W.H.D.

Apparently the city hadrun out of money to support the cult of Zeus Polieus and AthenaLindia. A few measures were, accordingly, taken to restore the sacredfunds. Alongside soliciting donations and gratuitous performance ofcult on the part of cult officials, these measures included, inter alia,selling bronze and iron objects stored in theneokoreion(lines18Ð30) andselling the right to dedicate old statues in the sanctuary on the acropolisof Lindus by inscribing their bases, in order that it be known that theyare dedicated to the gods (lines30Ð44). The document is unparalleled;not so the practice of rededicating old portrait statues, even those withinscribed bases, as novel as the idea might appear; it existed elsewhereand seems to have been common enough on the Athenian Acropolis inthe Roman period.156Founding, Construction, Repair, and Maintenance of SanctuariesSome sanctuaries are founded by gods. Such is the case of the sanc-tuary at Delphi, founded, as we learn from the Homeric Hymn, byApollo, who is also known to have used his construction skills to buildhis famous horn altar on Delos (CallimachusHymn to Apollo59Ð64).157In several other cases, the founding and building of sanctuaries are leftto humans as are their routine maintenance and random repair, whichultimately became the case at Delphi and Delos as well. The tendencyto record such matters at different stages has left us a variety of inscrip-tions, including a fair number of those which can be counted as sacredlaws concerning them. The function of such documents is not neces-sarily uniform. The actions speciÞed might have been completed in thepast or (in the case of construction) are to be completed in the future(in both cases the inscription is ultimately a record); they may also berecurrent, i.e. in the case of maintenance and performance of cult.155Cf.

Astatement that ApolloÕs instructions have been followed and that sac-riÞce to Archilochus and to the other gods is offered at the so calledArchilocheion is added (lines16Ð19):\"ρ)σαντ%ς δ\u0005 τ%/ JΑπ#λλων%ς τα/τα τ#ν τε τ#π%νκαλ%/μεν JΑρ\"ιλ#\"ει%ν κα2 τ%@ς \u000fωμ%@ς \u0006δρ?με1ακα2 1?%μεν κα2 τ%0ς 1ε%0ς κα2 JΑρ\"ιλ#\"ωι κα2τιμ3μεν α7τ#ν, κα1J L A 1ε\u0012ς *1\u0013σπισεν >μ0ν.Apollo having so declared, we call this place the Archilocheion, we havefounded the altar, and we sacriÞce both to the gods and to Archilochusand we honor him according to what the god has prophesied to us.Perhaps it is possible to assume that, despite the indirect imperatives,the inscription did not merely record the foundation, authorized as itwas by the oracle, but also that it functioned as a sacred law governing158Cf. e.g. W.

The second-century B.C.LSCG171from Isthmus on Cos records the foundationof a precinct to Artemis (epithet missing), Zeus Hikesios, and the TheoiPatrooi, an individual having been dedicated to their service;164localactivities are to follow instructions Ôin the sacred tabletÕ (\u0006ερ\u0003 δ\u0013λτ%ς)and other instructions left upon founding which evidently providedmore details. The present stele, the scope of which appears more lim-ited, nonetheless lists the essential cathartic requirements for entry:Bγν\u0012ν ε5σπ%ρε?εσ1αιÑτ\u0012 δ\u0005 \u0006ερ\u0012ν Nστωτ3ν υ\u00063ν π\u0010ντων κ%ιν#νÑ4π\u0012 λε\"%/ς κα2*γ δια\u0002(1\u0003%ρPς Bμ\u0013ρας δ\u0013κα, 4π\u0012 γυναικ\u0012ς τρε0[ς].Enter pureÑthe sanctuary shall be forever common to all sonsÑafter abirth and abortion/miscarriage165ten days; after sexual intercourse witha woman three.162I personally doubt this very much and would rather not include comparabledocuments in the corpus (in fact, including this inscription inLSCGseems to havebeen an afterthought). Other oracles of this kindÑsuch asSyll.3735(cf. below p.106),IGII24969, andSEGXXIV1031(= XLV912; cf. the article by Avram and Lef•vrecited immediately below)Ñwhere direct control over the performance of cult is notself-evident, have been left out (cf., however,LSAM47). I suspect that the undated andvery fragmentaryLSAM87(cf.SEGXII478(no text); BE1954no.229p.170) fromCaunus could be an oracle of this sort.

They do not have aclose parallel in the corpus of sacred laws.Construction of Temples. The corpus of sacred laws is rather selectivein regard to temple construction. Only a handful of documents whichgovern the construction of temples in some detail168and allow aninsight into the underlying procedure is included. Factors such as thescale of the work and its sponsorship, individual or public, affect therange of issues discussed; as it is, undertakings are preceded or inspiredby divine consultation, and records, in the form of the inscriptions wehave, are required to be published.A second-century B.C. inscription from Anaphe,LSCG129, fea-tures a decree and incorporates other documents. A certain Timotheos,who sought an oracular response169to the question whether he shouldobtain the cityÕs permission to build in the sanctuary of Asclepius orApollo Asgelatas a temple, which would be public, to Aphrodite, wasinstructed to build the temple in the sanctuary of Apollo, and to havethe decree, the oracle, and the request, embodying a fairly detailedplan for the work, for which older materials were used, inscribed on a166Or the early-mid430s B.C.: M.B.

The publication, depen-dent in the oracle upon completion of the construction, ispost fac-tum. The inscription does not quite prescribe the work but serves asa record, accounting for it and for the conditions under which it wasundertaken. In this sense this document is both similar to and dif-ferent from a ca.335B.C. document of the Chian phratry of theKlytidai,LSCG118.170The construction in question is not quite a tem-ple but what the text calls a sacred house (%gκ%ς τεμ\u0013νι%ς \u0006ερ#ς/\u0006ερ\u0012ς%gκ%ς) built in the precinct of the phratry to lodge permanently theκ%ιν\u0003orπατρ3ια \u0006ερ\u0010, probably statues and/or other cult-related para-phernalia,171transferred from private houses. The inscription, placednear the entry to the house (lines40Ð41), is at once a record andan active sacred law. It includes three decrees: the Þrst, the begin-ning of which is lost, concerns the building of the house and thetransfer of thehiera; in the second (10Ð22) the Klytidai decree thatthehierashould lodge in the house permanently; the third (22Ð36) isthe only one which actually functions as a sacred law, as it governsthe use of the house, now lodging thehiera; it is to sustain no pri-vate use, at the risk of a penalty and imprecations. The constructionof the house and transfer of thehierarequired divine consultation,and omens had to be obtained from sacriÞces before the passing ofthe Þrst and second decrees. From the publication clause (36Ð41) welearn that the stele, now broken above, was similar in format to theinscription from Anaphe, recording the consultations in addition to thedecrees.Neither one of these documents discusses any Þnancial aspects of theconstruction; in the Anaphe case this may be because the constructionwas a private endeavor, enabled to an extent by the relatively minorscale of the project and the reuse of old material.172This was prob-ably not the case in the ca.400B.C.173decree from Erythrae,SEGXXXVI1039, on the subject of constructing a temple and a statue forAphrodite Pandemos, inspired by an oracular consultation (line3).

The most complete sacred law on this subject isLSCG44,a52/1B.C.

Athenian decree,LSCG14, prescribes lettingout the sanctuary of Kodros, Neleus, and Basile. The period of the leaseis twenty years; the rent is ultimately to be handed over to the Treasur-ers of the Other Gods and used for religious purposes. An appendedlease handles the use of the land: it is to be planted with olives;185mat-ters pertaining to water use are elaborately discussed. Before leasing,the boundaries of the precinct have to be Þxed. As in the earlier caseof the Pelargikon,186the stateÕs highest religious authority, the archonbasileus,187is involved in this. AsLSCG32(352/1B.C.) reveals, a sweep-ing initiative concerning the care of all divine-owned Athenian terri-tories would appear in the next century (lines16Ð23), resulting fromthe controversy over the boundaries of the Sacred Orgas at Eleusis,its cultivation, and the wish (or so it seems) to lease it out (24Ð25).188180For a general interpretation of this document see J. and L.

Here,however, we should review those documents where cult officials are theprimary focus. Although the variety of officials mentioned in one wayor another in the corpus is not particularly small, such documents are,with few exceptions, concerned with priests.PriesthoodsOne may distinguish between two basic groups of documents: priest-hood regulations, i.e. documents governing the actual function ofpriests and their appointment, and a few other documents194whoseprimary concern lies elsewhere.

Priesthood regulations can, on theother hand, be comprehensive and discuss various aspects of the priest-hood, or speciÞc, discussing a particular aspect, mostly priestly prerog-atives. Legislation, mostly in the form of decrees, is the norm; contracts(vel sim.)195appear in the case of sale of priesthoods. As regards thepriesthoods themselves, one can distinguish between hereditary priest-hoods, entitlement to which is gained through birth into a priestly fam-ily, and priesthoods acquired in a different way.Comprehensive and SpeciÞc RegulationsComprehensive Regulations. In most casesÑthe fragmentary state of somedocuments precludes certaintyÑcomprehensive regulations tend to beissued upon entry into office, upon the creation of a priesthood, orupon revisions, mostly in the mode of acquisition. The majority ofsuch documents come from places where the sale of priesthoods wascommon, inter alia due to a need for repeated publication whenevera priesthood was sold. Naturally, factors such as the character andsigniÞcance of the cult, local customs, the mode of acquisition, andthe issuing body (public or private) affect the scope of the documentsand the range of issues discussed; payments, for example, would onlybe discussed when the priesthood is sold. Nevertheless, since mostdocuments are Þrst and foremost concerned with the rights and dutiesof priests and since ordinarily the basic functions of priests tend to besimilarÑcultic variations permittedÑ, comprehensive regulations areprimarily geared toward a similar repertoire of topics. Among thesetopics sacriÞcial prerogatives occupy a place of honor, to the extentthat they may be discussed independently in speciÞc documents (seebelow). The second-century B.C.LSAM37, a contract for the sale ofthe priesthood of Dionysus Phleus from Priene, is a convenient examplefor the range of other issues commonly discussed. Besides addressingmatters directly related to the sale (namely payment), the documentdiscusses recurrent matters like exemptions from taxes and duties (heredependent upon the amount paid for the priesthood: lines24Ð30),priestly prerogatives, sacriÞcial accessories,196entitlement to a front seatat the games, clothes and apparel, and cult activity.195See further below pp.49Ð50.196Cf. below commentary on19.2."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"42part oneTwo Coan documents,LSCG154(250Ð240B.C.(?)) and156(Iscr.Cos55;370Ð360B.C.(?)),197are in a way a class onto themselves.

Nevertheless, what follows is mainly concerned with prerog-atives due to the priest from a variety of sacriÞces.204These preroga-tives, which are usually prominently featured in comprehensive regu-lations, are indeed the most frequent topic of speciÞc ones. The pub-lication clause of the third-century B.C. regulations for the priest ofZeus (epithet lost) and Poseidon from Thebes at Mycale,LSAM40,which discusses little more than priestly prerogatives, requires that theybe inscribed on a stele and placed in the sanctuary of Athena nearthe altar of Zeus Polieus. Perhaps governing sacriÞcial activity thereon197The dates are according to Parker and Obbink2000,420.198SeeLSCGp.275; Parker and Obbink2000,421.199See (e.g.) F.

The mostobvious object of such documents is to ensure the priests their sacriÞ-cial dues.206LSAM45(Miletus;380/379B.C.), which supplements anexisting document listing prerogatives and sets a penal procedure forthose denying the priestess of Artemis her prerogatives, certainly pointsin this direction. But punishments may be prescribed not only for wor-shippers but also for priests who take more than their due (LSS113:Axos; Þfth century B.C.).207The publication of the rules governing dis-tribution of the sacriÞcial meat between the priests and other partakersin the sacriÞce is therefore beneÞcial for both sides. Should controver-sies ariseÑand punishments suggest that they didÑboth can refer tothe written regulations, especially those posted at the very place wherethe sacriÞce is performed, to assert their rights.208The regulations thusensure the maintenance of proper sacriÞcial procedure. As it is, most ofthe pertinent evidence comes from Chios and it must be admitted thatsome of the fragmentary documents might have belonged originally tomore comprehensive sets of regulations.209This might be true also ofthe substantial fragment from MiletusLSAM46(ca.300B.C.) envi-sioning a variety of public and private sacriÞcial occasions and appro-priate prerogatives. The fragmentary AthenianLSCG11B(IGI3255;ca.430B.C.) and28(SEGXLVI173; early fourth century B.C.) regu-late priestly prerogatives in a more comprehensive way, listing togetherprerogatives of various priesthoods.LSCG28, the more substantial one,205Cf. T. Wiegand,Priene, Berlin1904,471. The sale of a priesthood of AphroditePandamos and Pontia, Parker and Obbink2000no.1, is also published near the altar(line46). The central location of altars in sanctuaries is of course a consideration.206Cf. AristophanesPlutus1173Ð1175, where the priest who, as sacriÞce is no longeroffered, is deprived of sacriÞcial prerogatives complains that:JΑ(J %j γ\u0003ρ A Πλ%/τ%ς%jτ%ς qρUατ% \u000fλ\u0013πειν,|4π#λωλJ Tπ\u0012 λιμ%/6 κατα(αγε0ν γ\u0003ρ %7κ N\"ω,|κα2 τα/τα τ%/σωτ:ρ%ς \u0006ερε@ς rν Δι#ς.Ever since this Plutus started to see (and people stoppedoffering sacriÞce), I am dying of starvation.

It is worth-while to review the range of documents associated with each one ofthese modes of acquisition.Hereditary Priesthoods. We have a few documents governing the func-tion of hereditary priesthoods, issued upon their creation or upon en-dorsement of the right of inheritance. Comparable documents govern-ing ancient family cults nationalized214early on are lacking. This isprobably not coincidental. Priestly families might not feel the need toshare internal matters with the public by means of inscriptions, and thepublication of relevant documents, which, one way or the other, tendsto be a state matter,215might result more from their interaction withthe state, collaborating in the management of the cult.216Such inter-action seems to have motivated the publication of the now battered,much restored and interpreted,217and difficult to dateLSCG15(IGI3210See immediately below.211See above p.30.212p.41.213How exactly the priesthood is transmitted within the family is a different matterwhich may now depend upon inference.

So in the Pergamene decree,LSAM13, dated beforethe death of Attalus III in133B.C.,218the city grants the priesthoodof Asclepius and other cults at the Asclepieum to Asclepiades son ofArchias and future descendants of Archias, the original founder; who-ever of them actually serves as a priest is to wear a crown.219Thedocument contains a set of prescriptions governing the priestly func-tion (lines12Ð25): the crown-bearer, that is the priest, is entitled to spe-ciÞc sacriÞcial prerogatives including table offerings;220he seems to beaccorded the right to exploit sanctuary land, probably for cultivation;he is exempt from all civic obligations and entitled to a front seat atall the games. So much for his privileges, which are similar to thoseencountered elsewhere. As for his duties, he is in charge of the sacredslaves and must care, in the way he thinks appropriate, for order inthe sanctuary. The grant is reinforced by an oath; three copies of thedecree are to be published, including one at the Asclepieum. More-over, the decree is to be listed among the laws of the city, in force for-ever as a law. The decree does not expand upon the transmission ofthe priesthood.221The family foundations of Posidonius,LSAM72.18Ð20, EpictetaIGXII3,330.57Ð61, and, so it seems, Diomedon,LSCG177.23Ð25,222name future Þrstborn sons as priests. A similar state ofaffairs is evident in the second-century B.C. foundation of Pythoklesfrom Cos,Iscr.CosED82.7Ð11(LGSII131);223the cult is public, and thecity granted the relevant priesthoods to the family of the founder at hisrequest (if we accept Mario SegreÕs plausible restoration). This principleseems also evident in the decree of the Piraeus association of Dionysi-218J. and L. Robert,La CarieII, Paris,1954,298n.5. R.E. Allen,The Attalid Kingdom:A Constitutional History, Oxford,1983,162, returns to a date after the death of Attalus III(suggested by M. FrŠnkelI.PergII p.179; see alsoSyll.3III p.142).219The priesthood had probably been hereditary since the foundation, a right whichis being conÞrmed here: Allen ibid.162Ð163.220For sacriÞcial prerogatives see below commentaries on3.5and20.7.221The problem of transmission of an inherited priesthood has been noted above n.213.222See below pp.86Ð87.223See below p.84."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"46part oneastai,LSCG49(ca.176/175B.C.),224though the transmission of the postof the deceased priest to his son appears to require ratiÞcation by themembers.The creation of a hereditary priesthood at Gytheum in the Þrstcentury B.C. appears to have had a different motivation. A decree,LSCG61, hands the authority over a sanctuary of Apollo and overall matters pertaining to its administration to a certain Philemon sonof Theoxenos and his son, named Theoxenos after his grandfather,who, having been granted permission, restored at their own expensethe ruined sanctuary. They and their descendants are to serve as priestsfor life for eternity. The priesthood is to have the same status as otherhereditary priesthoods. The existence of these might be explained asthe privatization of cults by the city which can no longer Þnancethem.225Here too, as at Pergamum, the city, which assumes the costs ofpublishing the document, refers to it in the publication clause asν#μ%ς.Unlike at Pergamum, however, speciÞc rules governing the function ofthe priests are not added; by and large they are now the business of thefamily.Elected Priesthoods. In the fourth century B.C. (337or358B.C.) theXanthians and theirperioikoidecided to found a cult for Basileus Kau-nios and Arkesimas, recording their decree in Greek, Lycian, and Ara-maic on the so-called trilingual stele from the Letoon,SEGXXVII942.226As priest they elected one Simias son of Kondorasis Ôand who-ever is closest to Simias for the time to comeÕ (lines8Ð11). The priest-hood is therefore not quite elected but hereditary. Elected priesthoodswould imply a term of office. InLSAM78the office is held for life; inLSCG103B16Ð18for ten years; yearly elections are speciÞed inSEGXL956.LSAM78(ca.100B.C.), featuring decrees from Tlos, gov-erns elections directly though it serves as a record, elections having pre-ceded publication. InB4Ð11, the city of Tlos decides to elect a priestof Zeus. The office is held for life, and the priest would serve under thesame conditions as his predecessor. The elected priest, Eirenaios, is alsonamed in the next decree in which the city delegates an experienced224See Mikalson1998,204Ð205.225See SokolowskiÕs commentary p.116.

The priest is to wear a whitechlamysand an olive crown with apurple band; he is exempt from liturgies as long as he wears the crown,i.e. throughout his term of office; besides his sacriÞcial prerogatives, hereceives proceeds from workshops which the writer of the letter haddedicated to an unidentiÞed god; these he must maintain, lease, andreturn upon leaving office; he is instructed to care for the godÕs silvervessels and dedications and hand them over to his successor.232LSAM79(Þrst century B.C. from Pednelissos(?)) discusses duties and rights ofthe priestess called Galato.233She is to keep pure, holding her office aslong as she lives. Upon her death the city is required to hold a lotteryfor the appointment of a new priestess.234Sale of Priesthoods. The sale of priesthoods is Þrst documented in theÞfth century B.C.

Most ofthese documents contain single or multiple sets of regulations governingthe performance of single actions even when these are collected andpublished together.273Such regulations tend to be short and laconic,containing only the information necessary for a correct performanceof the actions they govern. Even the few sets of regulations whichgovern complex rituals are not much different in this respect: they listthe actions, which, performed in a sequence, constitute a ritual, andpay only the minimum necessary attention to the details of individualactions.The variety of issues reviewed in this section is considerable.

Attention is then directed to cathartic regulations, or rather theone document belonging to this small group of poorly-preserved doc-uments that allows a discussion, the cathartic code from Cyrene. Afew documents focusing on cult Þnance are then reviewed. This sec-tion ends with a review of cult foundations and documents of religiousassociations. These can be rather comprehensive and may discuss var-ious issues pertaining to cult management alongside cult performance.Though documents governing the performance of festivals and cere-monies belong here too, they form a distinct group and are so reviewedseparately. As usual, the nature of the evidence sometimes preventsabsolute classiÞcation.Regarding form, in many of the cases the identity of the body issu-ing sacriÞcial regulations depends upon inference. Some of these reg-ulations may well be official, but, even so, they very seldom presentthemselves as such. This is not the case with documents dealing withattendant matters, namely the sale of sacriÞcial meat or skins, and par-ticipation in cult. The few funerary regulations which have reached usare without fail legislative acts. The cathartic code of Cyrene,LSS115,doubtless an official document, is presented as an oracular response. Asfor foundations, they are represented in the corpus by either the foun-dation documents themselves or by enactments. The origin and genreof Þnancial documents and of documents belonging to religious associ-ations can usually be determined, depending upon the state of preser-vation, though it may involve inference made on the basis of content.SacriÞceInformation about Greek sacriÞcial practice in sacred law does not nec-essarily come from sacriÞcial regulations, i.e. regulations which simplyprescribe or authorize an act of sacriÞce. Priesthood regulations areoften explicit about the distribution of the parts of the sacriÞcial vic-tim.274Festival regulations can also be revealing in this respect as theymay prescribe, sometimes in great detail, rules pertaining to the vic-tims and the distribution of their meat among officials and the generalpublic.275SacriÞcial regulations tend, on the other hand, to be laconic,geared toward the act itself rather than dictating the details of perfor-mance. Ordinarily they are not concerned with anything which can274See above pp.42Ð43.275See below p.100."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"56part onebe taken to be common practice but rather highlight modiÞcations ordeviations from it. Special information is given to the extent that it isritually desirable;276when it is not given, there is little reason to sup-pose that it is desirable. For example, if the type, age, sex, or color of avictim is speciÞed, it is important; otherwise, we may assume that anyvictim can be offered or, possibly, that the identity of the victim is wellknown. When consumption of sacriÞcial meat on the spot is prescribed,it means that it is ritually desirable; when it is not prescribed, there isreason to assume that meat may be taken away.277SacriÞcial regulations can be classiÞed according to different param-eters. One can distinguish, for example, between public and privatesacriÞces or between sacriÞces in which the victim is eaten and thosein which it is destroyed. Here we use frequency as a basic parameter,distinguishing between sacriÞces performed on a given date and thosewhich are not. In the documents assembled in the corpus of Greeksacred law, sacriÞces belonging to the second group may be offered byprivate individuals or by the public; those belonging to the Þrst areusually not private.278On the whole, periodic sacriÞces may be assem-bled and listed consecutively together to form a calendar or prescribedindividually at the place of performance. SacriÞces which can be per-formed as wished or as needed are commonly handled in regulationspublished at the place where they are to be performed.Undated SacriÞcesThe simplest type of sacriÞcial regulations are inscriptions, commonlyshort, published at the place where the sacriÞce is to be performed,sometimes even inscribed on altars, indicating that offerings can orshould be made. Where the motive or occasions are not indicated, thelanguage uninstructive, and the cultic context unknown, it may be dif-Þcult to say whether they merely provide a venue for the performanceof sacriÞce or whether sacriÞce is actually prescribed.The Þrst-century A.D.LSCG54from Attica,279urges the farmers andneighbors to sacriÞce where it is allowed (Iι 1\u0013μις) in a sanctuary ofAsclepius and Hygieia, as long as two rules are observed: the founder276JamesonÕs1997expression.277Cf. below p.100.278Cult associations are a notable exception; see below pp.86Ð89.279Mentioned above p.13."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"greek sacred law57of the sanctuary and the priest must receive their assigned share in thesacriÞce, and the meat must not be carried away. This prohibition isencountered in this type of regulation elsewhere,280as in no.24belowfrom Lissos, appended to a dedication inscribed on the base of a statueof Asclepius, encouraging anyone who wishes to sacriÞce, as long as theskin is left for the god and the meat of the victim is not taken away.It is signiÞcant that in both cases, as in the foundation of Xenokrateia,LSS17A,281no reference is made to the animal; its choice is evidentlyleft to the discretion of the worshippers. Had this not been the case,the choice would have been limited, as it is in a number of comparableregulations.An animal may be prescribed, as a goat is to Apollo inLSCG170(Isthmus; third century B.C.); a bovine or a goat (after which the textbreaks off) to Dionysus inLSS67(Thasos; fourth century B.C.); par-ticular animals may also be prohibited. The choice of animal evidentlydepends on the taste and sensibilities of the recipient and the culticcontext.282Goats and pigs are among the most commonly prohibitedvictims.283The Þrst (A) of the two early-Þfth-century B.C. sets of regula-tions from the so called Passage of the Theoroi near the Agora of Tha-sos,LSCG114, inscribed on a relief depicting Apollo and the Nymphs,allows the worshipper to sacriÞce to them any animal, either female ormale, except a sheep and a pig;284the second set (B), inscribed on oneof two reliefs depicting Hermes and the Charites, forbids the sacriÞce ofa goat and a pig to the Charites.285Similarly, the second-centuryLSCG126from Mytilene allows anyone who wishes to offer on the altar ofAphrodite Peitho and Hermes any victim except a pig and any bird, atwhich point the text breaks off; a particular kind of bird was probablynamed and excluded.286Again on Thasos the laconic second-century280See commentary on16.6below.281See above p.35.282Cf., however, below n.

On Delos Semitic divinities show similar sen-sitivities. The second-century B.C. inscribed altarLSS55dedicated toZeus Ourios and Astarte Palaestina, also known as Aphrodite Ourania,excludes goats, pigs, and female bovines. The altar was dedicated by acertain Damon from Ascalon, after he had been saved from pirates.288The sacriÞce of goats and pigs is similarly prohibited on another altarfrom Delos,LSS58(I.Délos1720; ca.100B.C.), dedicated by anotherAscalonite289to Poseidon of his native city.290Goats were evidently aproblem for Heracles and Hauronas, the gods of the neighboring Pales-tinian city of Iamnia, to judge from the prohibition to sacriÞce them inthe contemporaryLSS57(second century B.C.).291Divinities may have other sensibilities too. A late-Þfth-century in-scription form Elatea,LSCG82, does not restrict the choice of victimsacriÞced at a sanctuary of the Anakes but prohibits the presence ofwomen. Women are also excluded in the most substantial individualset of sacriÞcial prohibitions, the mid-fourth-centuryLSS63from Tha-sos, which forbids the sacriÞce of goats and pigs to Thasian Heracles,292and lists three restrictions pertaining to the distribution of the meat thathave been variously interpreted.293Such prohibitions, whether regard-ing animals, participants in the sacriÞce, or consumption of the meat,attempt to prevent a breach of what is religiously correct in a given cul-tic context.294In this they are comparable to prohibitions, which controlentry into sanctuaries and aim at protecting the sacred space from pol-lution by preventing pollution from reaching it in the Þrst place.287Πει1%0 αgγα %7|δ\u0005 \"%0ρ%ν %7 1\u0013μ[ις].288LSSomits the dedication; seeI.Délos2305.

The Þrst-century B.C.LSS72from the agora of Tha-sos requires those offering sacriÞce to the local athlete, Theogenes,295topay no less than an obol into thethesauros(treasury box). The moneycollected therein would ultimately be used for a dedication or otherwork for Theogenes. Reluctance to pay would give rise to religiousscruples. Similarly,LSS86from the acropolis of Lindus (ca. A.D.200)requires worshippers (who must be of good conscience), sacriÞcing orconsulting the oracle at the Ômany-columned templeÕ (a minor struc-ture nevertheless),296which Seleucus constructed for Psythyros, to paya drachma; the money paid is to be used each year for the mainte-nance of the temple of Athena. In both cases payments stand at a ßatrate. Payment according to a differential scale is required, sometimesalongside speciÞc parts of the victim, in a number of other documents,commonly depending upon the size and/or age of the animal. Suchdocuments are called sacriÞcial tariffs. Though most Greek tariffs con-stitute sections in priesthood regulations, a few independent documentssurvive.297LSCG125from Mytilene (second century B.C.) envisions thesacriÞce of two different animals. The Þrst is unknown; the second isa hare. SpeciÞc parts are required to be placed on the cult table andsums (now lost) to be put in athesauros. The destination of the moneyis unknown. Some tariffs undoubtedly governed independent sacriÞcesoffered as one wished, but, as the LindianLSS86suggests, sacriÞcesregulated in tariffs may depend upon a different activity.298The lackof context makes certain cases indecisive:LSS108(Rhodes; Þrst cen-tury A.D.) opens with cathartic prescriptions299and continues with ashort tarifffor the offering of bovines, other quadrupeds, and a rooster(lines8Ð12) in sacriÞces performed in anadyton300in a sanctuary andseems connected to some other activity performed at this place.

The motive for many of the sacriÞces discussedso far is unknown and might vary considerably. Nevertheless, most ofthese sacriÞces seem to have been performed at will, at the discre-tion of those offering them and for their own motives; together withan ensuing sacriÞcial meal they also appear to have constituted a self-contained event.301Such sacriÞces are to be distinguished from sacri-Þces which might have been performed as needed or wished but whichwere required as a stage in connection with a speciÞc cult activityÑfor the most part, oracular consultationÑor, at the very least, in asequence in which a preliminary sacriÞce preceded a main one. SuchsacriÞces often involve, in one stage or another, non-blood offerings,mainly cakes.302A fragmentary decree from Lebadeia,LSCG74, surviving in conßict-ing transcriptions, prescribes the offering of ten cakes (calledε5λ?ται)alongside the payment of ten drachmas before consulting the oracleof Trophonius. Three, if not four, sacred laws can be shown to gov-ern pre-incubation sacriÞces in the cult of Asclepius.

Anumber of Athenian documents originating from the Piraeus and thecity Asclepiea prescribe comparable cake offerings.LSCG21from thePiraeus Asclepieum bears different texts, inscribed on the four sides ofa single block (numberedA,B,C, andD)atdifferent times during thefourth century B.C.;315it therefore allows some insight into the realisticneed to facilitate cult performance and maintain proper practice, com-bined, perhaps, with developments in the cult, which underlie the for-mation of an inscribed cultic code.Alines1Ð10date to the early fourthcentury B.C.

The document is inscribed on both sides of onestele which is damaged above. Preliminary sacriÞces are regulated heretoo, private preliminary sacriÞce being prohibited during the festival (A27Ð28).

The origins of cal-endars are relatively diverse. Alongside state calendars, we have demecalendars, the fourth-century Attic deme calendars forming a coher-ent group;326the so-called Accord of the Salaminians,LSS19, outlinesthe calendar of a genos;327LSAM39from Thebes at Mycale seems tohave belonged to a sanctuary serving a small pastoral community; theRoman Imperial specimen from Athens,LSCG52, is probably a calen-dar of a cult association, to judge from the limited scope of the activitiesconsidered and their character.328A typical entry in a sacriÞcial calendar includes the month, therecipient, and the type of victim to be offered;329the date within themonth may or may not be indicated.

This calendar, in all likelihood the learned work ofa professional committeeÑthe work of Nicomachus on the revision ofthe state calendar in Athens in the last decade of the Þfth century B.C.comes to mind337Ñreßects the reform in noting additional sacriÞcesÑnot an unlikely result of the consolidation of local cults and traditionsÑand changes in preexisting ones. The connection between political uni-Þcation and the consolidation of individual cults is noted by Aristotle(Politics1319b24), and there is reason to believe that it contributedto the composition and publication of the calendar of Cos followingthe synoecism of366.338If the detailed format is a result of such cir-cumstances, it should not necessarily be expected elsewhere, let alonefrom calendars of geographically limited civic bodies like the Atheniandemes, with their decidedly local focus and relatively narrow scope.339Some insight into the function of such calendars and the reasonsunderlying their publication can be found in the Accord of the Salami-nians,LSS19, the second part of which incorporates a sacriÞcial cal-endar carefully noting the prices of the victims (lines84Ð93). Theseprices are said (lines81Ð84) to be recorded to enable officials to estimatethe sums they have to contribute for the sacriÞces. Prices are similarlynoted in the calendars of the Marathonian Tetrapolis and of Erchia.The Erchian calendar, comprising Þve different sets of sacriÞces, evenindicates the subtotal expenses. All three calendars could therefore beseen as Þnancial rather than as religious documents. Expediting themanagement of cult Þnances is, however, not the end of the Accord of336The abundance of details in Coan official religious documents has been notedabove (p.52) in respect to priesthood regulations.337Cf. Dow1953Ð1957,21,23Ð24.338See S.M. Sherwin-White,Ancient Cos(Hypomnemata51), Gšttingen,1978,292Ð293.339The revision of the Athenian state calendar, though conscious and expert work,had its own motives; see Dow1953Ð1957; K.

The Þnancialmotive for the publication is therefore offset by religious motives. Thisis doubtless the case with the calendars of Erchia and the MarathonianTetrapolis as well. Both do not merely list the victims and their prices.To keep the performance in line with custom, prerequisites of a purelyreligious value are noted.341The publication of these calendars makesthe necessary information available to those responsible for cult perfor-mance; it has an added value in the way of accountability: like the pub-lication of priesthood regulations, publication enables the worshippersto check the performance against the written record, establishing themas an interested party in the process and so contributing to the ultimategoal of the publication, that is, to ensure the proper performance ofcult.Festival Calendars. Generally speaking, a typical peculiarity of sacriÞ-cial calendars is their general lack of interest in the occasion for thesacriÞce. Festivals may be named,342but we are commonly confrontedwith a great variety of unnamed sacriÞces, the scope, character, andsigniÞcance of whichÑdoubtless obvious to the ancient audienceÑarenow by and large a matter for inference drawn from the date, the typeand size of the victim, and any additional information regarding perfor-mance.343We have, on the other hand, a very small number of calen-dars which do not list sacriÞces at all but rather occasions. For lack of abetter term, they may be called festival calendars.344LSCG128(Roman340In order that the Salaminians may keep sacriÞcing to the gods and the heroesaccording to the ancestral customs. Cf. Ferguson1938,43.341The calendar of the Marathonian Tetrapolis,LSCG20, prescribes an all blackvictim in B18and a pregnant victim in lines A28,43;B9,12,48,49. The calendar ofErchia,LSCG18, prescribes, inter alia, color (Α9Ð10;Β17Ð18), wineless libations (Α41Ð43;B19Ð20;Γ24Ð25;52;Δ22Ð23;45Ð46;Ε14Ð15;Δ63), a pregnant victim (Δ19Ð20),and frequently forbids carrying sacriÞcial meat away.

A sizable stone from Cos,LSCG168(Þrst cen-tury B.C.), broken above and below, contains a long list of persons ofvarious professions who are required to perform sacriÞce, notably taxfarmers and persons of sea-related occupations. Comparable require-ments appear in Coan sales of priesthoods.358This practice appearselsewhere although not on such a large scale (LSAM49,52). A pream-ble of a third-century B.C. Athenian decree,LSCG40, mentions a cus-tom requiring public doctors to sacriÞce twice a year to Asclepius andHygieia. It is reasonable to conclude (SokolowskiLSCGp.75) that theaim of the decree was to give the custom a legal form.Some Undecided Cases.LSCG60from Epidaurus, dating to the lateÞfth century B.C., embodies two analogous sets of regulations for sac-riÞces to Apollo (with his temple-mates) and Artemis and Leto, and toAsclepius and his temple-mates, receiving bovines,359parts of which areassigned to various cult personnel (hiaromnamones,360singers, and sanc-tuary custodians). The rest of the meat would be distributed amongother participants in the sacriÞce, perhaps the general public, but theoccasion is unknown. Distribution of parts of multiple victims in anunknown context is evident in the fragments from DelphiCIDI4Ð6,joined asLSS40(second half of the Þfth century B.C.).LSS116fromCyrene (second century B.C.) contains two fragments listing offeringsto a number of divinities, some rather obscure; the format resembles asacriÞcial calendar, but no dates appear.LSS80from Samos prescribesthe provision (παρασκ[ευ\u0010+ειν], line3)ofdifferent cakes, evidently to beused for sacriÞce.361Sale of SacriÞcial Meat and SkinsThe sale of meat from public sacriÞces is stipulated in Athens in thesacred law of the deme Skambonidai,LSCG10C17Ð22(IGI3244;470Ð460B.C.), and in the calendar of Thorikos, below no.1, where in a358See Parker and Obbink2000:427Ð429.359And chickens (if this is what is meant byκ\u0010λαϊς; see LSJ with Supplement s.v.).360See below commentary on nos.6and26.27Ð28; for the passage cf. commentaryon11.24.361See also the following fragments, some of which might well have belonged topriestly or festival regulations:LSCG6;147;LSS66;67;70;109;LSAM21;SEGXXX1283; below no.21; cf.3;9;10.

Libation, as an accessory to sacriÞce, is mentioned in sacriÞcialregulations as needed, namely, when the ritual calls for libation that isnot ordinary. Libation of wine being the most common type, it is ordi-narily prohibited where it is not desirable rather than prescribed whereit is; libation of other liquids is prescribed when desirable.370Libationis rarely treated in sacred laws without speciÞc reference to sacriÞce.LSS62from Paros, dated to the sixth or Þfth century B.C., prescribeslibation of honey on an altar of Zeus Elasteros.371The Thasian fourth-century B.C.LSS68seems to authorize offerings to Agathos Daimon,prohibiting offerings to Agathe Tyche; the inscription is inscribed on alibation altar.372A fourth-century B.C. inscription from Chios,LSS79,prohibits the use of wine in the cult of the Moirai and Zeus the Leaderof the Moirai.

The few cases prescribing straight-forward private offerings for the dead are left out,388while cult foun-dations, in which commemoration of the dead is handled in a moreelaborate fashion,389are included.390Also included are three funerarylaws.391All are legislative acts. The Þrst two, the Þfth-century B.C.LSCG97from Iulis on Ceos, consisting of two different documents,and the third-century B.C.LSAM16from Gambreion are state-issued.The third is a section (LSCG77C) from the regulations of the Del-phic phratry of the Labyadai,CIDI9C19Ð52, inscribed in the Þrstpart of the fourth century B.C.392To a certain extent, all three betraya tension between practice and custom. Legislation is not interested inspelling out the details of funerary practice; common knowledge of theessential details is taken for granted, as in the case of sacriÞcial regu-lations. It appears rather to attempt to protect practice from personalmodiÞcations, restricting it so as to keep it within the conÞnes of whatis considered proper custom.393386See SokolowskiLSAMp.164. cf. alsoLSS121.12Ð17(for this inscription see abovep.54).387This policy would make good practical sense if incubation was practiced at thesanctuary.388A number of such inscriptions (e.g.TAMII636Ð637) are known from Teos andthe adjacent region.

It stands in contrast to documents discussed above presentingworshippers with requirements regarding their purity upon entering asanctuary. The scope of such documents is rather limited. They are notinterested in the pollution per se but in protecting the sanctuary andpreventing pollution from reaching it. A simple remedy may be pre-scribed, but worshippers are mostly expected to avoid entry before thepollution is gone. A number of documents interested in the pollutionitself and therefore in remedies have reached us.LSCG154from Cos,401relating mainly to the purity of priestesses and sanctuaries, seems tohave envisioned different kinds of pollution and speciÞed appropriateremedies.402Its miserable state of preservation is, regrettably, indicativeof the entire genre. All but one of the relevant inscriptions are so badlypreserved as to raise doubts regarding the exact nature of their con-tents.403Even the one exception, the extensive inscription from Cyrene,LSS115, is imperfectly preserved and its interpretation is further com-pounded by obscurities of language and context.The inscription is dated to the late-fourth-century B.C.; parts of thecontents may be earlier.404From the title we learn that the ensuing400SeeNouveau Choix105Ð109no.19(106Ð107for the date); cf.

Some of these, like sexual intercourse (A11Ð15), childbirth (A16Ð20), miscarriage (B24Ð27), uncustomary sacriÞce(A26Ð29), or even abuse of divine-owned wood (A8Ð10), are more orless familiar; others, particularly those discussed in the long paragraphon tithing (A33Ð72), but also some involving women (B2Ð23), are not,and these have been variously interpreted. The code concludes with asemi-independent section discussing three cases of what it callshikesioi,with the text becoming more and more damaged over the course of thethird case.408The code approaches pollution in various ways. It may limit itself todiagnosis, prescribe a course of action to avert pollution, or specify aremedy. In the case of childbirth (A16Ð20), the code is little more thandiagnostic, stating that Ôa woman in labor will pollute the house,Õ anddeÞning who may contract the pollution, namely only those inside thehouse.409Remedy is not called for since the pollution will pass afterthree days. In the case of wood growing in a sacred place (lines8Ð10),using it is allowed, provided that one pays the god its price; pollutioncontracted from abuse of divine property is not mentioned directly butseems to be taken for granted, a procedure by which it may be avoidedbeing suggested rather than a remedy.

Ifhe is a common worshipper (although cult officials themselves are notimmune from mistakes), puriÞcation might be carried out through theparticipation of cult officials. As in the case of sacriÞcial regulations andfunerary laws,412the code builds upon familiarity with common practiceon the part of the performers.

The extensive inscriptionfrom Erythrae, dated to the Þrst half of the second century B.C.,LSAM26+SEGXXX1327(cf.LSAM27; early fourth century B.C.), is, in fact,more a list of sacriÞcial expenses in a calendar format than abona fidesacriÞcial calendar.416Cultic Taxes.417LSCG178(IGI3256;440Ð430B.C.) imposes a paymentfor drawing water from the well Halykos in the territory of the Atticdeme of Lamptrai and Þnes reluctant payers; the sums are payableto the cult of the Nymphs, which is to be performed according to aprophecy of the Pythian Apollo.418A Lindian decree found in Tymnusin the Rhodian Peraea and dated to the late Þfth century B.C.,LSS85, sets out to sustain the cult of the military god Enyalios, demandingthat soldiers and mercenaries taking the Þeld from Lindus pay one-sixtieth of their wages to him. The Þnancial measures are accompanied,however, by stipulations regarding the cult,419which is the main reasonfor the documentÕs inclusion in the corpus.420A yearly sacriÞce of aboar, a dog, and a kid is to be performed for Enyalios and a processionis to be attended by hoplites. It is also stipulated that a house (%gκ%ς) bebuilt for him, utilizing voluntary private donations.421415SokolowskiLSSp.12; cf. also DowÕs1953Ð1957discussion of the state calendar.416This is not to say that it is not invaluable for the study of religion.

The activity may beprivate, limited to a gentilitial group, or public. The cult supported isnew or pre-existing. Foundations are mostly geared toward the peri-odical celebration of a sacriÞce or a full-ßedged festival. The corpusof sacred laws includes both documents recording the actual founda-tion and enactments endorsing and administering it, provided that theytranscend the Þnancial level to govern cult performance in a more orless direct form.428Depending upon the type of endowment and theactivity funded, the documents can be quite detailed, typically han-dling Þnances alongside cultic matters, which are sometimes dictated inrelatively great detail to ensure exact realization of the founderÕs inten-tions and because these may involve certain idiosyncrasies.

Those dealing with a single aspect (namely sanctuary and priest-hood) have been mentioned in the appropriate sections. Earlier prece-dents notwithstanding,429endowed foundations are by and large a phe-nomenon of the Hellenistic period, and most of the relevant documentsincluded in the corpus are indeed Hellenistic. Alongside these docu-ments we may discuss the one or two documents plainly dealing withstate foundations which are earlier.430State Foundations. The term Ôstate foundationÕ is used here to denotenot merely the introduction of new cults but cases in which cults arefounded and provided upon foundation with means of state support.Only a very small number of documents decisively belongs here. Thebattered Athenian decree on the cult of Bendis,LSS6(IGI3136;413/2?), has been interpreted as such a case or, alternatively, as intend-ing to bolster an already existing cult. As far as this can be judged,its consideration of various aspects of the cult is consistent with foun-dation documents. But the dateÑi.e. if it is correctÑis too late forthis.431A clearer case is the foundation of a cult of Basileus Kauniosand Arkesimas at Xanthus. It is known from a decree of the Xanthiansand theirperioikoi, inscribed in Greek, Lycian, and imperial Aramaicon one stele known as the trilingual stele from the Letoon, dating to337(or358) B.C.432The Greek text was included as no.942inSEGXXVII.433Despite its conciseness, the decree considers all the essentialmatters involved in the foundation of the cult. The deÞning act is thefoundation of an altar; a priesthood is also created; it is to be handeddown in the family of the Þrst elected priest, Simias son of Kondorasis.The city has also allocated land and funds to maintain the cult; a yearlysum of three half minai, would, as the Lycian version suggests, Þnancethe priestÕs salary;434a tax of two drachmas would be levied from slaves429See the private foundations discussed below. If no.21below is a private founda-tion, it is the earliest.430When the historical context cannot be established, it may be difficult to saywhether a given inscription is a foundation document or handles a pre-existing cultbased on its contents alone.431LSSp.22;J.Peÿc’rka,The Formula for Grant ofEnktesisin Attic Inscriptions(ActaUniversitatis Carolinae Philosophica et Historica Monographia15), Prague,1966,59Ð61; Parker1996,172.432See summarily Debord1982,203.433For the entire monument see H.

As for the performance of cult, it consists of a sac-riÞce of a victim (\u0006ερε0%ν)435ontheÞrstofeachmonthandofabovineonce a year.436Private Foundations: Public Cult. In the Þfth book of theAnabasis(3.7Ð13), Xenophon reports a consecration he had made to Artemis of aterritory at Skillous near Olympia.437On a stone which recorded theconsecration he ordered whoever held it and enjoyed its fruits to use atithe438for an offering to Artemis each year and to use the remainderfor repairs of a temple he had built for her; the goddess herself wouldattend to those who fail to do so. The corpus includes an identical copyof this inscription,LSCG86, which was found inscribed on a boundarymarker at Ithaca, dating to the second century B.C. The fourth-centuryB.C.LSCG134from Thera records a comparable foundation made byone Archinos, who dedicated a plot of land to the Mother of the Gods,prescribing a sacriÞce twice a year including offering the Þrst fruits ofthe land.439A more complex type of foundation, the endowment consisting incapital, is documented inLSCG58from Calauria (modern Poros), dat-ing to the third century B.C. A woman named Agasigratis dedicated(4ν\u00131ηκε)to Poseidon on behalf of herself, her evidently deceased hus-band Sophanes, her son, and her two daughters three hundred silverdrachmas, the interest from which is to fund a biennial sacriÞce of twoadult victims to Zeus Soter and Poseidon respectively on the seventhof the month Artemision. Though Zeus and Poseidon are named asthe recipients, Agasigratis ordains that the victims be offered on analtar placed near the statue of her husband. The foundation is there-fore commemorative. The periodic performance of cult is to perpet-uate the husbandÕs memory, not without commemorating Agasigratis435The Aramaic text (line15) hasnqwh, evidently a sheep. See below commentary on27B10.436At least one more document might come under consideration:LSAM34fromMagnesia on the Maeander (early second century B.C.: NilssonGGRII3126Ð127). Itdeals with the introduction of an official cult of Sarapis and is likely to have been quitecomprehensive; the preserved part is mostly concerned with the priesthood.437See at length A.L.

In182B.C. he dedicated to Pythian Apollo and to the city of Delphi a consid-erable sum to fund a yearly posthumous festival, consisting of a proces-sion (its course dictated), sacriÞce, and a public banquet.442Formally itis celebrated for Pythian Apollo; it is named, however, the Alkesippeiaafter the founder. AlkesipposÕ foundation seems to have served as amodel for the Delphic foundations of Attalos II and of Eumenes II.443Both are administered in decrees of Delphi,Syll.3672(partially repro-duced asLSCG80) andLSS44, dating to160/59B.C., to be inscribedon the bases of the statues of the founders. The Attaleia and theEumeneia consist of a procession, sacriÞce to Apollo, Leto and Artemis,and a public banquet. The Eumeneia also includes a torch race.444The second-century B.C. foundation of Pythokles from Cos445isknown fromLGSII131, evidently an enactment (likely a decree), whichhas been fully restored by M. Segre (Iscr.CosED82). The cult is divineand includes priesthoods of the concerned gods, Zeus Soter and AthenaSoteira, which are to be passed down in the family of the founder.446But PythoklesÕ foundation is primarily geared toward the celebration ofa yearly agonistic festival with procession, sacriÞce, and evidently pub-lic feasting, in addition to a gymnastic competition. Although these areperformed in honor of Zeus and Athena, the festival again commemo-rates the founder, Pythokles, named the Pythokleia after him.447440See ZiehenLGSII, pp.156Ð157; SokolowskiLSCGp.11; Guarducci1967Ð1978,III,250.441Rather than of the two gods; cf.

The foundation is known from a law of Aigiale,IGXII7,515, dated to the late second century B.C., concerningthe administration of the endowment, together with regulations forthe festival (lines39Ð86), reproduced asLSS61. It involved a publicbanquet and gymnastic competitions from which thepankrationwasexcluded; the deceased Aleximachos, heroized and receiving a heroicsacriÞce448in front of his statue (74Ð78), was announced the winner ofthis event (lines83Ð84).449A number of foundations are noted for supporting more straightfor-ward divine cult, mostly pre-existing.450The foundation of Hegesarete,the wife of Hermokrates from Minoa on Amorgos, is recorded inLSCG103, a Þrst-century B.C. enactment regarding the cult of the Motherand her festival of the Metroia, which speciÞes, inter alia, honors forHegesarete for her endowment (B25Ð33).

All three are commemorative agonistic foundations, inthe Þrst two cases commemorating, as in KritolaosÕ case, the sons of the founders. Intheir present state, only ED86still actually touches upon cult performance, Hermesevidently being named as the recipient of sacriÞce. It is therefore the best candidate forinclusion in the corpus of sacred laws though, as has been noted above (n.148), ED257, the most extensive of the three, is notable for its concern with the placement ofdedications.

The cults present a mixtureof divine and ancestral attributes, ancestors having been assimilatedto divinities and divinities adopted into the family. Diomedon, Posi-donius, and Epicteta all founded in one way or another associationsdevoted to ancestral cult, participation in which is limited to familymembers, the priesthood being passed down among the descendantsof the founder.455The foundation of Diomedon456consisted in ded-icating to Heracles Diomedonteios a plot of land, lodging facilities,and a slave and his descendants, to remain free as long as they per-form their related obligatory services.457Statues and cult paraphernaliawere also included. The foundation of Posidonius, recommended tothe founder by an oracle of Apollo, is dedicated to the cult of ZeusPatroos, Apollo of Telmessus, the Moirai, the Mother of the gods, andthe Agathos Daimon of the founder and his wife; the Agathe Tyche451Line17;P.FrischI.Ilionp.130.452Or possibly a new festival (Parker and Obbink2001a,270).453See in general W.

The inscription contains, in fact, twodocuments. The Þrst (lines1Ð108= AÐB) is the actual testament ofEpicteta, bequeathing an endowment to found an association of herrelatives dedicated to the worship of the Muses and of heroes, con-vening once a year in the so-called Mouseion, set in its own precinct,and left for this purpose to Epiteleia, EpictetaÕs daughter.461The sec-ond document (lines109Ð288= C) contains the statutes of the asso-ciation. C1Ð94(i.e. lines109Ð202), reproduced asLSCG135, governsthe administration and actual details of cult performance. The associ-ation is to convene yearly for a three day meeting; on each day sac-riÞce is offered to the Muses, the heroes Phoenix and Epicteta, andthe heroes Kratesilochos and Andragoras, respectively. The heroes, thatis, the statues of Epicteta and her family members, are crowned forthe occasion. As in the foundations of Diomedon and Posidonius, thestatutes can be very precise regarding offerings. To some extent, thisis called for to accommodate idiosyncrasies characteristic of the cultin question. Heroes can be very particular about their culinary pref-erences, and Epicteta takes care to note that three Þsh (vψ\u0010ρια) mustbe offered to them alongside pastries and the customary divine partsof the victim (189Ð191=LSCG135.81Ð83).462Fish offerings (4π#πυρις)are also prescribed in the foundation of Diomedon (LSCG177.42,62),where they are to be handled according to the ancestral customs (κατ\u0003τ\u0003 π\u0010τρια).463458See Sfameni Gasparro1997,89Ð90.459Lines49Ð51.

We can distinguish between comprehensive and spe-ciÞc documents. Comprehensive documents govern various aspects ofthe associationÕs religious life and matters of a more administrativecharacter. They may touch upon a number of the issues reviewedabove, whether related to sanctuaries, priesthoods, or cult performance,as well as upon issues related to membership (introduction of newmembers, conduct) and various Þnancial matters, more related to thereligious life of the association, or less related, namely in associationsengaged in Þnances alongside cult.

Moreover, it gives a clear account of circum-stances under which festival regulations may be published, illustrating,despite the seemingly great detail, the limits of the information thatcan be had from comparable documents, and, to an extent, from cultregulations in general.At the time of publication, the Actias was not an obscure festival. Ithad a regional signiÞcance and was attended by other cities and com-munities (N1νη¤6)486for whom permanent facilities existed at the sanc-tuary. The two parties envision commercial activity and tax revenuesgenerated by this attendance on a scale justifying the discussion inclauses3,4, and8.487And yet, unlike its successor, the Pan-HellenicActia founded by Augustus, the festival is known in literature onlyfrom cursory remarks.488Whatever substantial knowledge we have ofit is therefore derived from the present document. It was of course anagonistic festival but the document says nothing of the competitions.489Like many typical Greek festivals, agonistic or not, the Actias involvedsacriÞce and a procession. Though the order and apparel of the par-ticipants in the procession is considered (¤7), no other details about theperformance of the festival are given.486Confederacy members which are not cities; Habicht, ibid.101Ð102,109Ð110.487For markets during festivals see in general L.

In doingso, one has to consider the types of documents available and the issueswith which they deal, and attempt to assess the nature of the evidenceand its relation to the circumstances under which the documents werepublished.SpeciÞc and Comprehensive RegulationsThe most concise sets of festival regulations are the mid-fourth-centuryB.C.LSS5, cut into the rock on the north slope of the AthenianAcropolis, prescribing, in not more than eight words, the date andthe month for the festival of Eros, and the slightly longer RomanImperialLGSI25(PAESIIIA353Ð354no.765;SEGVII1233) fromnear Canatha in Syria which reads:bΗ a%ρτM τ3ν Σ-%αδην3ν =γε-ται τG3 1εG3 ΛG\t%υ λwThe festival of the Soadeni is held491for the god on30of the monthLoos.490Cf.

Asusual, we can distinguish between comprehensive documents, dealingwith several issues relating to a particular festival, and speciÞc doc-uments concerning individual aspectsÑwhether pertaining directly toperformance or notÑof one or more festivals. Legislation, mostly inthe form of decrees, is more or less the rule here; as usual, the fragmen-tary state of some of the documents may preclude exact identiÞcation.Since most ordinary Greek festivals tend to comprise similar elements,the same issues are recurrent in the documents. Three of the mostbasic ones, sacriÞce, procession, andÑin agonistic festivalsÑgames, areevident in the Acarnanian treaty. A fourth would be the sacred truce.Due to the nature of the evidence, which tends to discuss several issuestogether, we pursue the discussion by following these issues here, atthe risk of oversimpliÞcation, and by dissecting documents, a practicewhich has been so far generally avoided. The few documents regulat-ing performance of ceremoniesÑusually by cult collegesÑon speciÞcoccasions, not necessarily festivals, are also considered here.Truce. The term Ôsacred truceÕ is somewhat misleading. It is used totranslate three different Greek words,*κε\"ειρ8α,σπ%νδα8, and\u0006ερ%μην8α,which denote a period accompanying a festival, usually starting beforeit and ending sometime after its completion, involving two complemen-tary but somewhat different institutions: a suspension of hostilities and acertain suspension of official business, namely particular judicial activi-ties.493The corpus includes a few documents which discuss these institu-tions, the nature of which depends on the question of whether a festivalis celebrated on a local, regional, or national level.The Amphictyonic law of388,LSCG78.44Ð49, appears to have dis-cussed both the*κε\"ειρ8αand the\u0006ερ%μην8αconnected to the DelphicPythian games. The\u0006ερ%μην8α, evidently a partial suspension of officialbusiness, is to last a year; unfortunately the discussion of the*κε\"ειρ8α,i.e. suspension of hostilities, is all but lost.494The Amphictyonic decreeLSCG73, issued upon the reorganization of the Acraephian Ptoia inthe220s B.C., when the festival became pan-Boeotian,495which estab-lishes the inviolability of the sanctuary of Apollo Ptoius, also enacts492Or festival calendar extracts; cf.

The discussionin the comprehensive fourth-century (ca.367Ð348B.C.) regulations forthe mysteries,AgoraXVI56A1Ð20(LSS12), appears to have been moredetailed, opening with the announcement of the truce and its announc-ers (σπ%νδ%(#ρ%ι).498The document is unfortunately very fragmentary.What a local truce may entail is suggested in the second-century B.C.regulations for the Asclepieia from Lampsacus,LSAM8(lines16Ð30ofI.Lampsakos9).499Children are to be released from schools and slavesfrom labor (17Ð18).500Certain judicial activities are suspended (lines24Ð28):μM εgναι δ\u0005 μη1εν[2 μη1\u0005ν][*]νε\"υρ\u0010σαι *.ν [τ]α0ς >μ\u0013ραις τ3ν JΑσκληπιε8ων, ε5 δ\u0005 μ),.A *νε\"υρ\u0010σας.N.ν[%\"%ς][N]στω τG3 ν#μGω τG3 περ2 τ3ν παραν#μως *νε\"υρασ\u0010ντων6 μM κ\u0002ρι\u0003ν[\u0013τωσαν][δ]\u0005 μηδ\u0005 %\u0006 *πιγν\tμ%νες *ν τα0ς >μ\u0013ραις τα?ταις, μηδ\u0005 %\u0006 ε5σαγωγ\u0002ε0\u0003ςσυ[λλε]-[γ].\u0013τωσαν [δικ]α[σ]τ\u0002)\u0003ρι\u0002%ν\u0003.It shall not be allowed to anyone to take anything in pledge during thedays of the Asclepieia.

In both of these cases suspension of activities seems to beconÞned to the festival days proper. The Ephesian decreeLSAM31,the second (B) of three documents inscribed on a statue base fromEphesus,I.EphesosIa24(A.D.162/3or163/4), declares the wholemonth of Artemision sacred to Artemis for the annual performance ofÔthe celebrations, the festival of the Artemisia, and the\u0006ερ%μην8αι,Õ501i.e.the festal days kept throughout the month.502Both the preceding and496See Rougemont ibid.88Ð89,95n.69.497Possibly also at the local level.

As has been seen, the treatment of the procession in theAcarnanian decree is unusual as it is the only ceremony performedat the Actias for which exact details are included. This care is indica-tive of processions elsewhere. Though their character and signiÞcancedepend upon the cultic context, processions are a fundamental ritualfor Greek religion and a deÞning moment in many Greek festivals.504Comprehensive festival regulations may therefore be relatively preciseregarding processions that may also be discussed in speciÞc documentsas needed. The best example for such a speciÞc case is the ca. A.D.220Athenian decree on the procession at the Eleusinian mysteries,LSCG8(though it is not quite concerned with the procession as a wholebut rather with the participation of the ephebes in it).505Among themost commonly discussed issues regarding processions are the identityof the participants, their order, their apparel, and items carried along.The Eretrian decree regarding the agonistic festival of the Artemisia,LSCG92,506prescribes the order of victims led at the procession (lines35Ð38). Another Eretrian document,LSS46, requires all the Eretriansand other inhabitants to wear ivy crowns in a procession in honor ofDionysus.507The route itself may be dictated, as in the Delphic festivalfoundations.508The procession at the Alkesippeia at Delphi (LSCG81.6Ð8), attended by the priests of Apollo, the archon, theprytaneis, and all ofthe citizens, is required by the founder to leave from a speciÞc locationat Delphi; the foundation of Attalos (LSCG80.12Ð16) adds the templeof Apollo as the destination; the foundation of Eumenes (LSS44.8Ð11),which seems to follow the same route, even prescribes the time at whichthe procession ought to begin.503See L. RobertÉtudes Anatoliennes, Paris1937,178; R. Oster,NewDocs. VI78Ð79.504See summarily Graf1996.505The fragmentary Þrst-century B.C.LSS15is evidently also concerned with theprocession at the mysteries. At least in its fragmentary state, the ca.300B.C.?LSCG93from Eretria (for the date see D. Knoepßer,Décrets érétriens de proxénie et de citoyenneté(Eretria.Fouilles et recherchesXI), Lausanne,2001,37n.56,279n.43) seems to bepredominantly interested in the participation of children in a procession in a festival inhonor of Asclepius. For more comprehensive treatments of processions, see the decreeof the Piraean Orgeones of Bendis,LSCG46(Þrst part of the third century B.C.) andthe decree from Antiochia ad Pyramum,LSAM81(mid second century B.C.).506See below p.101507See further below p.110.508See above p.84."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"greek sacred law97One of the most detailed sets of festival regulations is the decreefrom Magnesia on the Maeander,LSAM32, on the organization of afestival, instituted after185/4B.C. on the occasion of the peace withMiletus,509in honor of Zeus Sosipolis, who, so it was hoped, would blessthe city with peace and prosperity.

The religious signiÞcance of competitions is a complexmatter. Torch races are as much a religious event as they are sportive.525But even in cases where their religious signiÞcance is in and of itselfquestionable, competitions are set in a context in which the sacred is inessence ever present through performance of cult, not to mention thenotion of divine hospitality and endorsement. Inclusion of regulationsfor agonistic festivals in the corpus is justiÞed inasmuch as they pertainto cultic aspects of the festival under discussion. Consider, for exam-ple, two of the documents included in the dossier concerning the ago-nistic festival foundation of C. Iulius Demosthenes at Oenoanda,SEGXXXVIII1462(A.D.124Ð125/6). The last part of the second document(B; lines38Ð46) lists the competitions, the dates they are to be held, andthe prizes to be awarded, but does not quite regulate attendant cultperformance. The third document (C), on the other hand, governs cultperformance directly, including regulations for cult performance duringthe festival of the Demosthenia.526Not all of the documents pertaining to agonistic festivals includedin the corpus are actual regulations, that is governing performancedirectly rather than other matters relating to the respective festivals.This problem has already been seen in relation to the Actias. It isexempliÞed by the dossier of documents relating to the Ptoia.527Thedecree of the Delphic Amphictyony is concerned with establishing theinviolability of the sanctuary of Apollo Ptoius and the sacred trucefor the festival.LSCG71is only concerned with the participation ofOropus.528A set of festival regulations is missing. Depending upon thescope of the festival, the few sets of regulations for agonistic festivalsincluded in the corpus may be quite detailed. A particularly notablecase is the Eretrian ca.340decree regulating the Artemisia,LSCG92.529Like practically all relevant documents it shows a distinct interest inprizes. These differ from one competition to the other and may consistof money (LSCG92; musical competitions), weapons (LSCG98; belowno.14: sports), and even parts of sacriÞcial victims (LSCG98;LSS525See below commentary on no.14.526See M.

The Delphic Pythian games are represented only indirectlythrough two injunctions in the Amphictyonic law of388,LSCG78.34Ð49, concerning the renovation works to be executed before the festivaland the sacred truce.547The situation is not much better for the well-known old Athenian festivals.

By local one should not imply unim-portant; these festivals must have been important enough to those whocelebrated them. Most, however, have left little trace in literature. Thehaphazard nature of the evidence is particularly striking if we con-sider the case of the Andanian Mysteries. This festival, which Pausanias(4.33.5) considered second in sanctity only to the Eleusinian mysteries,is otherwise barely known from literature. As the location where themysteries were held has yet to be excavated, the festival would haveremained practically unknown if it had not been for the discovery ofLSCG65. This inscription startsin medias res; the beginning is evidentlymissing. Even so, it is the longest and most detailed sacred law in exis-tence, comprising194almost perfectly preserved lines. It refers to itselfas aδι\u0010γραμμα(lines25,28,113,114), evidently an enactment, compris-ing numerous paragraphs arranged by subject matter and identiÞed byappropriate sub-headings, and covering most issues that the administra-tion of the festival might entail. A detailed analysis cannot be pursuedhere; it is enough to note that these involve logistic, legal, and Þnancialissues pertaining to the practical management of the festival resultingfrom the accommodation of what is evidently a considerable crowdof worshippers and the signiÞcant variety of officials (sacred, polic-ing, Þnancial, legal) and performers (73Ð74) engaged in the production.Some of these issues, such as the size of the tents of the worshippersand their furnishings (34Ð39), administration of the market (99Ð103), thesupply of hot water (103Ð110), the handling of funds, offenses and legalprocedure (40Ð45,81Ð83,116Ð190), or the publication of thediagramma(113Ð115) may seem more mundane; others, such as the transfer of thesacred books of the mysteries (11Ð15), the dress code (both of officialsand of worshippers), the procession and its order (28Ð34), furnishing ofvictims (67Ð73),551or the sacred banquet (95Ð98), relate more directly tocult practice.One ought to ask oneself why such detail is needed. The reason iswithout doubt a certain change in the status or a reorganization of thefestival. The origin and development of the festival is a famous crux.It seems clear, however, that it underwent a thorough reorganization in551See above p.99."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"106part onewhich its administration became the business of the Messenian state, acertain prominence having been nevertheless accorded to Mnasistratos,known as the Hierophant from the related oracle (Syll.3735), and tohis descendants.552It is otherwise hard to explain why the stipulationsattempt to deÞne the status of each of the parties in the administrationand protect the rights of Mnasistratos and his family.553Quite like thecase of the Actias, the publication of the present document dependedupon this reorganization.Publication. Reorganization is indeed a frequent reason for publica-tion. In and of itself it may be motivated by different factors. We shouldbrießy consider some possible types of revisions and a few other occa-sions on which festival documents may be published.554New Festivals. When the state of preservation allows this, new festivalsare usually easy to detect. A typical document would account in oneway or the other for the reasons which brought about the institutionof the festival and include a relatively detailed set of regulations outlin-ing the new ceremonies. In this respect, such documents are similar toother documents governing newly instituted cults whether their mainfocus be on cult officials or on cult practice. The motives for institutingnew festivals may differ. As seen above,555festivals may be instituted byindividuals to perpetuate their memory. We may consider a few othercases. Historical events may be involved. Festivals may commemorateexternal or internal reconciliation. Such is the case of the festival ofZeus Sosipolis,LSAM32,556of the Antiochia ad Pyramum (Magarsus)festival in honor of Athena and Homonoia commemorating the recon-ciliation between it and Antiochia ad Cydnum (Tarsus) and regulatedby the decreeLSAM81(mid second century B.C.),557or the festivalinstituted to perpetuate the memory of a local act of reconciliation inthe decree of Nakone, no.26below.LSAM15,558a decree dating to129B.C. from Elaea,559prescribes a sacriÞcial celebration (one-time, or552See at length Deshours1999, suggesting a restoration of the mysteries.553See especially the management of the treasuries in lines89Ð95.554For a detailed study of festivals in the Hellenistic period see A.

Commemoration of an epiphany of Artemis Kindyas ina time of adversity also seems to have been the reason for the institu-tion of the festival in her honor at Bargylia.560The Magnesian Eisite-ria seems, to an extent, a relative of the Leucophryena, and togetherwith the two complementary decrees regarding the Eisiteria that havereached us inLSAM33(late third century B.C.),561the dossier of docu-ments regarding the Leucophryena enables reconstruction of the histor-ical circumstances:562In the course of events that followed an epiphanyof the goddess in221/0B.C. and an ensuing oracular consultation,563which inspired the Magnesians to solicit asylum grants for their city andterritory and to institute the Leucophryena,564the cult statue of Artemiswas introduced into her temple, probably somewhere in the late thirdcentury.565The Þrst (A) of the two decrees regarding the Eisiteria, pro-posed by Diagoras son of Isagoras, contains a set of regulations for thefestival instituted to commemorate the consecration of the statue.

Most if not all of them date from the second century B.C. on-ward.567The motives for resuscitation are commonly expressed in elab-orate preambles.

Financial difficulties and new means to Þnance certainfestivals may lead to Þnancial reorganizations.

Robert has shown,570the coastal plain of Oropus.Athena is also the patron of the festivals of which the Þnancing isdiscussed in two different documents from Ilium,LSAM9and10. TheÞrst, a decree of Ilium, was occasioned by a private foundation.571Thesecond is an agreement of the Ilian confederacy regarding the federalpanegyris, dated to77B.C., which, apparently grounded in Þnances,is quite detailed in various other aspects. Cf. also the foundation ofHegesarete from Amorgos,LSCG103.572Upgrade. Local festivals may for different reasons be upgraded toregional festivals. The upgrade of the Acraephian Ptoia from a localto pan-Boeotian festival occasioned at least two documents included inthe corpus.573See above pp.94,101and commentary on no.11below.Increasing Popularity of the Cult. As has been seen above, the Eleusiniandossier includes two separate general laws,LSS3and the more exten-siveAgoraXVI56, dated respectively to ca.460B.C. and ca.367Ð348B.C., the newer one being much more detailed than the older.One may wonder what prompted the new law. The answer ought to besought, as Kevin Clinton has suggested,574in the increasing popularityof the cult. Growing attendance had an inevitable effect on the admin-istration of the festival; the limited scope of the old law rendered itobsolete and brought about a need for a new and more comprehensivelaw.Cultic Modifications. Cultic changes, namely additions, are probablythe most difficult thing to detect without a speciÞc statement as to theirintroduction. We may consider some cases.The earliest relevant document is the421/0B.C. Athenian decreeregarding the organization of a pentaeteric agonistic festival in honorof Hephaestus,LSCG13(IGI382). The festival has been considered tobe new; it is probably not. Its celebration is rather given here a new for-mat.575The motives for this were probably discussed in the preamble,now all but lost. Despite the overall fragmentary state of the remainderof the decree, it is possible to envision its scope. It concerns Þnancingand the appointment and function of officials in charge of the pro-570HellenicaXIÐXII, Paris,1960,194Ð200.Contra: M.K.

Though the festival cannot be too old (the cult of Asclepius havingbeen introduced to the Piraeus in420/19B.C.), it seems to predate thedecree.578A decree from Eretria,LSS46,579known only from a copymade by Cyriacus of Ancona, seems to add a new motive to an exist-ing festival, stipulating that a procession in honor of Dionysus duringwhich the city had been liberatedÑan event Denis Knoepßer dates to285B.C.580Ñ commemorate the liberation.Two Roman Imperial copies,I.Labraunda53Ð54, record a much ear-lier decree (fourth century B.C.) on the subject of reorganization ofa certain festival under Mausolus, consisting in extending its dura-tion from one to Þve days. The combined text of the two decrees(I.Labraunda54A) is still fragmentary. It evidently prescribed a conciseday-by-day list of the activities. One notes a parallel to the day-by-day format in the equally fragmentary Punic inscriptionKAI76(CISI166), listing offerings for different days, evidently of a festival.581As seenabove, the foundation of Epicteta (IGXII3,330;LSCG135) also liststhe activities for each one of the three days of the meeting of the familyassociation, though in greater detail.582The Nature of the EvidenceWhatever may be the reasons for publication, the documents are sub-ject to certain limitations. This is clear in respect to speciÞc regula-tions which view a given festival from the limited spectrum of a par-ticular issue. But comprehensive documents are limited too because oftheir overwhelmingly administrative character (this is stated explicitly in576For the practice see van Straten1995,109Ð113.577See above p.64.578See above p.64with n.320.

They touch upon points in cult performance as needed,rarely if at all dictating it, let alone in detail. To illustrate this problemwe may turn back to the Andaniandiagramma.Thediagrammawas, as has been said above,583occasioned by a reor-ganization. This reorganization must have been predominantly admin-istrative. There is little to suggest that the cult itself underwent anysubstantial changes. On the contrary, sacred books that Mnasistratoshad provided (and which likely predated the reorganization) are to betransferred each year from one college of cult administrators to theother, evidently to ensure the preservation of proper practice. Thedia-grammaand the books are therefore complementary. Thediagrammamaytouch upon points of cult performance but was not meant to prescribeit directly. Rather it sets the administrative framework within whichcult may be practiced in keeping with proper procedure. The cult itselfdepended upon the precepts of the sacred books.Like other cult regulations considered in this review, festival regu-lations may generally be compared to professional cookbooks, to theextent that they tend to list the ingredients, on the whole leaving outpractical instructions. Cult performance is very much the product oftradition,584i.e. the accumulation of practices, customs, usages, rules, allof which, as has been pointed out above,585are entailed in the termν#μ%ς. These are the primary source for and substance of cult regu-lations,586standing behind what the documents may (inter alia) referto asτ\u0003 π\u0010τριαorτ\u0003 ν%μι+#μενα.587Basic knowledge of cult perfor-mance may be gained through experience;588when it is prescribed byepigraphical means, only the necessary details need be mentioned.589583pp.105Ð106.584Cf.

PaulGetty Museum. I have not noted differences between DauxÕs two editions. The dicolon(:), used as a punctuation mark, appears between the stoichoi. Paragraphs are markedby a line of varying length (3Ð6letters) inscribed above each month.21In the entries onthe sides the letters are engraved at the same level as the lines of the front except forthe Þrst entry on the left side, where they are engraved at the level of line31and inthe interlinear space between it and line32. On both sides the tricolon (...) is used forpunctuation.Latus Adversum(Figure3)1Daux does not dot the alpha; I could only detect the right stroke along thebreak.4End: part of the vertical stroke of the rho survives along the break.6The gamma was not dotted by Daux. Strictly speaking, a pi is possible.7End: Daux read only a left stroke of a triangular letter (Α,Δ,Λ,Μ). A lowerleft corner of a triangle seems secure to me.21See Figure3."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"120document 19The legible letters are inscribed in a rasura and are a little more tightly spacedthan the stoichoi.

Daux does not dot the nexttwo letters. I could detect only the bottom tips of the Þrst stroke of the nu andof the vertical stroke of the tau.21End: the letters past the rho were inscribed in a rasura and are more tightlyspaced than the stoichoi. I could see nothing after the epsilon and I could notread DauxÕs lambda at the end.23The Þrst letter is now lost. In the Þrst three words, a vertical line has beeninscribed through the middle of the letters reaching just past the Þrst strokeof the nu ofπρατ#ν. InBλ:ιa small lambda was inscribed in the upper partof the space between the stoichoi. End:Π%σ[ειδ3νι]: If, as Daux asserts, therestoration is certain, one of the two iotas should have been inscribed eitherbetween the stoichoi or in one stoichos with another letter.24I could only detect very insecure traces of the Þrst letter.25End: I could see no traces of the mu on the stone or in a photograph takenbefore it had been put on display.26At the beginning the stone hasΗΜΙΔΩΝ.32Although it had been properly inscribed initially, the ÞrstΓwas eventuallymade into a square.52\u0002π\u0003αρ[\u0013\"εν]: Daux detected a very small pi; I could see no such thing.57%gΔΔν: The two small deltas were inscribed between the stoichoi.59–60Daux (1983,169Ð170) noted traces ofΗinscribed between theΕ(beginning ofline59) and theΚ, after theΕhad been altered. I was unable to verify thisbeyond doubt. In his1984edition Daux printed [η].κεν.61End: the left tip of the tau is secure.62Daux notes that a iota, which had been inscribed by mistake, was deleted by thestone cutter himself by means of a small chisel stroke, and was further damagedby someone else. A tip of a diagonal stroke might perhaps be detected in thelower part of the stoichos.64Thevacatwas postulated by Daux whom I follow, though with some doubt,since the stone is broken here.Latus Sinistrum(Figure5)The three entries might have been inscribed at different times.31The letters are similar to those of the front but they are less widely cut, andthe diagonals of the psi are straight here and curving in the front.

As much as this can be judged,they belong to a single hand. Daux notes (1984a,150) that the letters were probablyadded much later than the front; I am not sure how much later this might be. In theÞrst and less so in the second entries, the nu has a shorter right vertical, as in the front(possibly also in the third entry).4The mu is faded but secure. I could not assign the traces before it to anintentional stroke; Daux reads a dotted iota. Little could have preceded it.5Daux notes that his readings are doubtful. For his alpha I could see onlyinsecure traces.6Daux notes that the readings are even more doubtful. A theta might possiblybe read for the dotted omicron.12See Figure6.44See Figure7.

As usual, it consists of a list of months and sacriÞces to be per-formed in them. Virtually all months of the Athenian year are presentin a chronological order.26Information includes most commonly thename of the divinity and the type of victim. Qualitative attributes (e.g.ÔchoiceÕ (passim), ÔpregnantÕ (lines39,44)) or value of victims (28Ð30,54Ð57) are mentioned occasionally, as are other details such as their age(Ôfull grownÕ (passim), their color (lines34,46), the mode of sacriÞce (aholocaust (line15)), its purpose (Ôan oath victim for theeuthynaiÕ (lines12, cf.52)), and additional expenses (lunch for officials (lines3Ð4(?),16)).The date within the month (line33), the occasion (a particular festival(passim), and the place (e.g. Ôat the Salt WorksÕ (line23), Ôto SounionÕ(line19))27may be mentioned. The ending of the document is some-what unusual: it contains regulations pertaining to the localeuthynai,afeature which seems to emphasize the local character of this document.A particularly local character is further emphasized by the independentcommemoration of certain festivals (the Prerosia; line13with commen-25Or at; cf. commentary on line14.26The chronological order supports the restoration of the month name Metageit-nion on line10.

A focus onlocal traditions is also evident in the sacriÞces to local heroes (lines16Ð19,28Ð30,54Ð57(?)) and in the detectable cycle of related agriculturalfestivals (see commentary on line13).Provenance. Ever since its Þrst publication, the calendar has beenattributed to the deme of Thorikos. In his masterly1997paper M.H.Jameson noted, however, that the stone itself preserved no real refer-ence to the deme or the demesmen and that the document could beattributed to a larger regional grouping (1997,193n.20, cf183). Con-sidering the broad scope of the calendar and its ostensibly local, per-haps regional (cf. below commentary onFront16Ð19), character, thissuggestion is attractive; nevertheless, it seems to be questionable con-sidering the reference to theeuthynai(front12, cf.52,57Ð65). As Jamesonnotes (ibid.), the office ofeuthynosisknown at the state and deme levelsonly. Since the present calendar is not likely to be a state document, itis most likely a deme document. The Þndspot and the reference to thehero Thorikos do suggest that the deme in question is indeed Thorikos.Date. Daux dated the inscription to the Þrst half of the fourth cen-tury B.C., perhaps385Ð370, on paleographical and orthographicalgrounds.28A higher date was promoted by others on similar grounds,namely letter forms29and the Archaic dative plural in-ησι.30The evi-dence for a higher date is summed up by Mattingly1990. DauxÕs datewas supported, however, by Threatte, suggesting380Ð375, and takingthe dative pluralbΗρωνησιto be an intentional archaism used like com-parable forms in the Athenian law on the Eleusinian mysteries, (AgoraXVI56(LSS12)),31where they appear to be quotations from the earlierversion of the law.32The same (see immediately below) is not entirelyimpossible here. One should note that the closest parallels, the localcalendars of Erchia (LSCG18), the Marathonian Tetrapolis (LSCG20),Teithras (LSS132), and the calendar from Eleusis (LSCG7) all comefrom the fourth century; their publication may have well been triggeredby the revisions to the state calendar (LGSII15A(IGI3238)?;LSCG16,28Daux1983,152; idem1984a,45with n.5.29440Ð430B.C.: Lewis1985, n.3(hand of this inscription is similar to that ofIGI352).

Despite their fragmentary state, there is noth-ing about the entries on the right side of the stone (Figs.6Ð7) to suggestthat they are not simply additions to the main text, as Daux (1984a,150) reasonably concluded. The entries on the left side and their rela-tion to the main text are the real crux. Despite DauxÕs attempts (seerestorations), it is impossible to determine with any certainty to whichsections in the main text these entries might relate. It should be notedthat, unlike the additions on the right, those on the left do not startat the beginning of a word, i.e. the name of a divinity, but rather inthe middle of words. In addition, the Þrst letters of these entries areinscribed near the left margin of the left side,34i.e. they appear to alignthemselves to the back of the stone rather than to the front. The mostreasonable solution to this problem was pointed out to me by KevinClinton. The back of the stone (Figure4) shows clear traces of its lateruse as a threshold. As practically none of the original Þnish survives,it is impossible to say whether or not it was ever inscribed. If it wasinscribed, the entries on the left may belong together with a now losttext originally inscribed on it. This explains their placement on thestone (close to the back) and the fact that the Þrst words are truncated.These words are simply continuations of words inscribed on the back.It is impossible to connect them to the main text because the entries onthe left side do not relate to the main text at all. The exact contents ofthe text on the back of the stone are a matter for further conjecture, butso much can be said: for reasons which remain unknown, there was aneed to add words to this text. The right (our left) margin was naturallyused for this purpose. One notes that the additions, listing offerings,recipients, and in the Þrst case, an occasion, the Pyanopsia, look liketypical entries in a sacriÞcial calendar. It may follow that the text onthe back was indeed a sacriÞcial calendar, just like the text on the front.It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the texts, both written on the33Cf. Dow1953Ð1957,9; Parker1996,46; for the dates see P.J. Rhodes, ÔTheAthenian Code of Laws,410Ð399B.C.,ÕJHS111,1991, esp.88Ð89; on the relationshipsbetween the deme and the state calendars see Mikalson1977.34The exact size of the original margin is unknown because of the damage to theback."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"126document 1same stele, were somehow related.35Whatever the exact relationshipsbetween them would have been, emulation of an older version mightaccount at least for the archaisms of the present text.FrontHecatombaion (Lines1Ð9)Lines1–9Restorations. Considering the size of the lacuna here and the fact that notwo sacriÞcial calendars are entirely identical, all of the more substan-tial restorations suggested here, as reasonable as they may be, should betaken asexempli gratia.

After the Proerosiain the fall, the appearance of green shoots would be marked by theChloia (line38);53then, forty days before the harvest, the blossom,particularly of the grain, would be marked by the Antheia (line44).An intermediate celebration, occurring between the Chloia and theAntheia, is attested in two demes.54This is the Kalamaia, which wouldmark the formation of the grainÕs stalk (καλ\u0010μη).55Line6Unfortunately, all occurrences of a Delphinion in this calendar areuncertain as they rely on restorations, at times very tentative.56Theyseem, however, to make good sense.Line7An altar with a dedication to Hecate, dated to the early Þfth centuryB.C., was found in the Delphinion at Miletus.57A priestess of Hecate50See Dunst1977,251,261; Labarbe1977,60n.7; Daux1983,164; Parker loc. cit.,but Whitehead1986,196; Scullion1994,88; Robertson1996,349Ð350;356.51Though the position of the dicolon in this inscription is not entirely consistent; cf.line44(and possibly in line23with commentary ad loc.).52Daux1983,162Ð163; cf. above.53This festival is, however, particularly difficult to date.

He also instituted a custom that whoeversacriÞces to some god offer a preliminary sacriÞce to Kourotrophos.90Daux suggested that the six piglet sacriÞces to her at Erchia are indeedpreliminary;91Dunst assumed the same for the three piglet sacriÞces inthis calendar (here, lines22,41Ð42).Line21Demeter had a special connection to Thorikos. In the Homeric hymnto Demeter (line126) the disguised goddess names it as the landingplace of the pirates who brought her from Crete, as she talks to CeleusÕdaughters.

DauxÕs suggestion (1983,156Ð157,166Ð167) that the Þrst entry on the left side belongs together with line27makes little sense. It is hard to see why the addition was writtenon the left side and at such a distance, and it is not clear why theωat the end of DauxÕs restored line27(Π[%σειδ3]) is repeated at thebeginning of the Þrst entry on the left side (-ωνι).101It is possible toplace a semicolon afterτ\u0013λε%νin line27and takeΠυαν%ψ8%ιςtogetherwith the last word at the lost end of this line. This, however, creates anew problem, since the space of seven letters (including the preservedΠ) seems hardly sufficient for both an offering and its recipient (cf.Parker1987,146). It is still not entirely unthinkable that a special kind ofoffering was prescribed here but any restoration depends on a correctunderstanding of a postulated ritual.102It might, therefore, be advisableto leave the semicolon at the end of line26. In this case line27would betaken independently. DunstÕsπ[ρατ#ν], (supported by Parker) is possible,although it requires one space to have been left empty at the end of line27, and, if the recipent is Neanias, creates an awkward word order. Itshould also be pointed out that the festival of the Pyanopsia was held inAthens on7Pyanopsion.103If line27is taken independently, a distortedorder of offerings has to be understood, unless (Parker1987,142,146)these are local Pyanopsia, celebrated after the city festival. Consideringthe local Prerosia (lines5Ð6), the local Plynteria (52Ð53), and perhapsthe Hieros Gamos (line32), this might be possible.Line25On Zeus Kataibates see above commentary on line10.100Cf. above n.51.

The original structure of this unusually shaped theater(oval rather than round) goes back to the late sixth century B.C. Stonebenches were constructed in works undertaken in the middle of the Þfthcentury, during which a small temple of Dionysus and an altar appearto have been added.114The seating space was further expanded aroundthe middle of the fourth century with the addition of the upperkoilon,enabling the theater to accommodate a considerable crowd.115GamelionLine32The festival of the Hieros Gamos was held in GamelionÑwhich isclear from the reference hereÑcelebrating the marriage of Zeus andHera and, through it, marriage itself.116It appears to have been heldon27Gamelion,117a day on which sacriÞces are offered in the Erchiancalendar (LSCG18) to Kourotrophos (in the sanctuary of Hera) andHera (Β32Ð39), and to Zeus Teleios (in the sanctuary of Hera:Γ38Ð41).118All of these sacriÞces are local, to be performed in the demeitself. This festival may be matched with the Theogamia,119a festivalwhich, as Deubner suggested (1932,177Ð178), should be further equatedwith the Gamelia, from which the monthÕs name, Gamelion, had beenderived.

According to the more prevalent version, Aglauros was adaughter of Cecrops and a sister of Pandrosos and Herse. Follow-ing ApolloÕs oracular response, she sacriÞced herself for AthensÕ sakeby jumping from the Acropolis. The ephebes consequently took theiroath in her sanctuary.155She was a priestess of Athena156who, accord-ing to another version, handed over the infant Erichthonius, concealedin a basket, to the three daughters of Cecrops for nurturing. Disobey-ing her, they looked in the basket, and, upon seeing its content, castthemselves from the Acropolis.157Cult of Aglauros is documented in153Mikalson1975,160Ð161; cf.163Ð164.154Cf.

TheÞrst is a decree honoring Philokomos and Moirokles, the proposerof the second decree and the person who has successfully broughtthe plan prescribed therein to fruition respectively. Philokomos, whoproposed that the festival of Heracles in Akris, obviously a deme festivalconsisting of a public sacriÞce, be funded by quarry revenues, is tobe honored with a golden crown paid for by Moirokles, who himselfreceives an olive crown for his role.The non-religious contents of the inscription have been amply dis-cussed. The following points should be noted here.Some of the juridical and civic questions, addressed by Coumanou-dis and Gofas in their commentaire juridique (1978,297Ð306), weredealt with by Whitehead1986, especially124(the assemblyÕs prohibi-tion related to the demarch (lines38Ð39),157(sureties),164(stipulationagainst other usage of the revenues),169Ð170(cult Þnance)."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"156document 2On the leasing of the quarries see Ampolo1982and cf.

The career of Moirokles was thoroughly studied by Ampolo1981,190Ð193, suggesting that the two persons referred to as Moirokles inPA12are in fact one person. This, however, remains questionable. Forprosopography see further Koumanoudis and Matthaiou1987,17Ð18;Aleshire1991,245Ð246; Clinton1994,30Ð31. Of the various detailsknown about Moirokles it is interesting to note here that the connectionbetween stone quarries and cult may run in his family. His father,Euthydemos,13was a priest of Asclepius at Zea, where the cult appearsto have beneÞted quarry revenues.14The religious content of the inscription is unfortunately rather ob-scure. We hear of a sanctuary of Heracles in Akris, a priest (lines43Ð49), and a festival, but the document is not interested in any of these intheir own right but rather in Þnancing the festival and the sacriÞce toHeracles.15Practically no other evidence for the cult exists.Date.

It may be fairto assume that it had a local signiÞcance, perhaps connected in part tothe special relations between Heracles and Eleusis.Line19Coumanoudis and Gofas suggested that the sanctuary of Heracles inAkris was located near the place were the stone had been found, closeto the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore, perhaps on a hill. The word=κρις,ι%ς(<=κρ%ς), meaning Ôa hill-top, height,Õ is used several timesin theOdyssey.24Accordingly, the Akris could be identiÞed with the hilljust above the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore.25Kevin Clinton pointedout to me that this hill, parts of which have been consumed by the localcement factory, has never been systematically excavated; the quarries atits northern side are evidently ancient.Lines21–22Coumanoudis and Gofas suggest (1978,293) that the main part of thedecree starts here, that*[πειδ)]should be restored, and that someadverbial expression should follow.

Indeed, Eustathius(134.35) states that there were those who derived the verb~μ%1ετε0νfrom~μ#ς(raw) rather than fromμ%ς(shoulder).33I have suggestedelsewhere (2003a) that there might, in fact, be no confusion: the shoul-der and the armpit (μασ\"\u0010λη) of the sacriÞcial animal could, from aculinary point of view, be seen as two parts of the same cut, an approx-iomate parallel to the chuck, including both the blade meat and theupper portion of the arm34(hence armpit)35as well as neck meat.36Theoffering which had been named after the armpit was explained by thelexicographers with a reference to the shoulders. In reality both areparts of the same cut.The offering expressed by~μ%1ετε0νis commonly taken as a Þrstfruits offering (cf. Eustathius134.30), that is, small bits of meat areoffered to the god and burnt on the altar, in the course of what isotherwise an eaten sacriÞce where the victim is consumed. Similarofferings are attested elsewhere in Homer. InIl.9.219the pieces of thevictimÕs meat are referred to as1υηλα8: The word=ργματαis used later32Cf.Il.1.460Ð462,2.424;Od.3.458,12.361. Cf.

On the sacriÞce of Eumaeus see Petropoulou1987.33Considering that the passage quoted from the Odyssey clearly shows that~μ%1ε-τε0νconsisted in cutting pieces from all limbs, this derivation seems wrong.34Cf.

The cult of Pan in Attica is archaeologically documented fromaround the beginning of the Þfth century B.C.,7corresponding on thewhole to HerodotusÕ report (6.105) relating PanÕs arrival in Attica to thebattle of Marathon. The cult of Pan and the nymphs at the Marathoncave seems to have started around this date: although remains suggesthuman activity from the Neolithic era onwards, the evidence for cultdates to the Classical and Roman periods.8Ephebic activity in the cave is probably linked to PanÕs affinities tothe battle of Marathon9and to the role the commemoration of the Per-sian Wars played in the ephebic curriculum.10The three ephebes11areunlikely to have formulated the law; their dedication consisted ratherin inscribing and setting up a stone bearing regulations representing alocal custom.125SeeErgon1958,16Ð17with photographs; J.M.

I have seen the stone and I made use of excellent study pho-tographs provided by the J. Paul Getty Museum. The stone was inscribed by two hands:lines1Ð36belong to the Þrst;37Ð46to the second. Corrections in the several erasuresin lines1Ð36were probably made by the second hand. The letters of the Þrst hand aresomewhat uneven; they are particularly crowded with practically no interlinear space.Alpha with a broken crossbar and square lunate sigma are employed, and there are noserifs. The sign )( is used for punctuation. The second hand is somewhat more orderlyand the letters are not as closely packed.Αwith a broken crossbar,Σ, serifs. The sign< is used for punctuation (cf. also the sign / in line45; for the larger\u0002in line39seecommentary ad loc.). Unlike the Þrst hand, the second hand usesιforει. Raubitschekdoes not dot a few doubtful letters where the readings are secured by the context.4Παιανε0: The stone (and the photographs). Raubitschek printsΠαιανιε0.13Τ6: TheΤis followed by a dot placed in the middle of the line (for the dot cf.ThreatteGAII4.021no.3(p.88).19λαν\u000f\u0010νων: Raubitschek printsλαμ\u000f\u0010νων, but the stone (and the photograph)have a nu. The nu for mu is probably a copying mistake (ThreatteGAII41.03(pp.491Ð492)).21Raubitschek brackets the Þrst eta.

As he says, the traces visible on the stone mightbelong to aΓ(i.e.3) which had been erased.38ΚI: RaubitschekÕsκ< /appears to be a misprint.[.] . Σ .: before the sigma thestone has a bottom part of a vertical stroke. I thought I could see secure tracesof iota after the sigma but this may be wrong and Raubitschek has[τ].8σ.ι.41–42RaubitschekÕs divisionA|ταμ8αςmust be a mistake.44I follow Raubitschek in printing < though on the stone the sign looks somewhatlike a small Y placed in the middle of the line. It looks somewhat the same inline45, where it might be damaged by a small break.45A diagonal stroke appears in the middle of the line between the Þrst two words.It seems intentional and might be interpreted as a punctuation mark.46End: for(for the sign see commentary below) Raubitschek hasI; this must bea misprint.TranslationTo good luck. When Titus Flavius Conon was an archon and priest ofthe consul Drusus, on the eighteenth of Mounichion, Marcus AemiliusEucharistus of the deme Paiania, the archeranist of the association ofthe Heracliastai in the Marshes, has decreed that the following be laiddown:(5) If anyone engages in a Þght in the association, on the followingday the one who started the Þght shall pay a Þne of ten drachmas; theone who joined it (shall pay) Þve drachmas.

It is therefore regrettable that this inscription has attracted so littleattention since its publication, especially because it is, as the Robertsobserved (BE1984no.185), not without problems. The inscription isfull of details which ought to have been obvious to its target audience.Most of them are mentioned by passing reference only, without suffi-cient context. As a result, they remain at times both unclear, furtherobscured by the haphazard style, and difficult to elucidate, especiallysince comparable documents are relatively rare. Thus, while allowingus a glimpse (perhaps not nearly as revealing or as entertaining as theone given by the Iobacchi inscription,LSCG51),5into the mundanereality of an association with its intricate combination of Þnance andreligion, this document may also serve as an indication of the gaps inour knowledge of matters pertaining to contemporary Athenian associ-ations, cult practice, topography, and prosopography.This is not the place for a discussion of the full range of meaningscovered by the wordNραν%ς. It should suffice to mention here the twobasic meanings: (1) a meal consisting of contributions made by thoseparticipating in it;6(2) a particular kind of loan, perhaps friendly, butnot necessarily interest-free.7At least to a certain extent, the social and4LSCG8;51Ð55(andIGII21365);LSS16;127.5For which cf.

Associations of*ρανιστα8were alreadyknown to Aristotle (see below). They appear to have gained popularityin Athens during the Hellenistic era.8At Þrst glance, aneranosmay seemto have existed mainly for Þnancial reasons, i.e. to offer to its mem-bers loans, presumably on terms better than those offered by bankers.9But the situation must have been more complex than this. In theNico-machean Ethics(8.9.5(1160a20)) Aristotle gives a different reason for theexistence of associations of*ρανιστα8: like the associations of1ιασ3ται,they exist1υσ8ας Wνεκα κα2 συν%υσ8ας.10These elements, loaning money,cultic activity, and socializing, are evident in the present document. Theparamount concern with Þnance indicates that the association was notfounded merely for cultic purposes and socializing but had preeminentÞnancial interests.11We might even say that the concern with culticmatters is, if not superÞcial, at least secondary.12It would still be wrongto assume that the cultic, social, and Þnancial elements were not lookedupon as complementary by the founder and the members of the asso-ciation. To them, a cultic framework may have appeared to provide anatural setting for socializing, and this framework, secondary perhaps,may have not been wholly superÞcial. On the contrary, it may havebeen regarded as essential to the Þnancial interests of the association.13Date. On the date see below commentary on lines1Ð2.Lines1–2The office of\u0006ερε@ς Δρ%?σ%υ Tπ\u0010τ%υ, created in Athens following thedeath of Drusus in9B.C., was held by the eponymous archon who,after9/8B.C., was thus to be known also as ÔThe Priest of the ConsulDrusus.Õ The priesthood is Þrst documented inIGII21722. It seems tohave disappeared during the reign of Hadrian: the last archon docu-mented to have borne this double title appears to be T. Fl. AlcibiadesofIGII23589.148For a review of the epigraphic evidence see N.F.

Geagan,The Athenian Constitution after Sulla(HesperiaSuppl.12),"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"segxxxi 122183The date of the archon T. Fl. Conon is, unfortunately, far fromsecure. The stemma of his family, the Flavii of Sounion, which hadoccupied several scholars during the twentieth century, has been morerecently reconsidered by Aleshire1991,123Ð130.15T. Fl. Conon couldhave been the younger brother of T. Fl. Sophocles, who was an ar-chon in the Þrst years of the second century A.D. (between100/1and105/6).16The two could possibly be identiÞed as the Sophoclesand Conon mentioned in the ephebic catalogIGII21992.3Ð4. Therelationship between them and the Conon who was an archon in theÞfth decade of the Þrst century A.D. is not certain. They could behis sons, aged sixty to seventy at the time of the present document,or grandsons, aged around thirty, which is more plausible since incontemporary Athens a person was unlikely to serve as archon at suchan advanced age as sixty or seventy. If they were grandsons, it is notclear whether they were indeed brothers or perhaps cousins.17Whatever restoration of the stemma we might prefer, RaubitschekÕsdate of ca. A.D.120may be somewhat too late, although it should betaken as aterminus ante quem, since the priesthood of the Consul Drususdoes not appear to be documented afterwards. Aleshire has reasonablyadvocated a date between A.D.90to A.D.110.18If the present archonis indeed the younger brother (or even the cousin) of T. Fl. Sophocles,the consul of the beginning of the second century A.D., and the twoare the grandsons of Conon, the archon of the Þfth decade of the Þrstcentury A.D., a date in the early second century A.D. and following thearchonship of T. Fl. Sophocles is probable.Lines3–5The archeranist, Marcus Aemilius Eucharistus, is otherwise unknown.Similarly, nothing concrete may be said about theΛ8μναι.Theyareprobably not to be identiÞed with the famous site of the sanctuaryof Dionysus*ν Λ8μναις(Raubitschek1981,95).19As Raubitschek notedPrinceton,1967,8; (Raubitschek1981,95); cf. Follet1989,37Ð38.IGII23589is currentlydated to A.D.121/2(Aleshire1991,229n.1).15For bibliographical references see225n.2.16Follet1989,40Ð41.17Raubitshek1981,95; Aleshire1991,227Ð230with table XI for the stemma.18Aleshire1991,228Ð230who points out that, regarding letter forms, only thesquare sigma of the Þrst hand precludes a date as early as A.D.80. A date aroundthe beginning of the second century A.D. seems to have also been preferred by theRoberts in their short notice (BE1984no.185).19On the location of the sanctuary of Dionysus see Travlos1971,332."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"184document 5(1981,95Ð96), it may be signiÞcant that the law of theeranistai,LSCG53, was also discovered at Liopesi, the site of EucharistusÕ home demeof Paiania.20It is tempting to assume an affinity between the two doc-uments. One should note, however, that the date ofLSCG53is notsecure (either in the second or third centuries A.D.),21and that thearcheranist (line35) is not identiÞed in that document. If the twodocuments refer to the same association, there could be a chance, asRaubitschek suggested, that the archeranist ofLSCG53.35was not nec-essarily Eucharistus himself but his son or grandson. Raubitschek alsonoted (ibid.) that it is interesting that both documents date themselvesto Mounichion18, which could be the date of the annual meeting ofthe association.22Still, this might be coincidental.ArnaoutoglouÕs assertion (1994,108,109Ð110) that in Athens, unlikein Rhodes, an4ρ\"ερανιστ)ςis found mostly in groups whose mem-bers do not call themselves*ρανιστα8, and that, accordingly, the preem-inence of the archeranist in the context of an association is doubtful,since it is only inferred from the meaning of the word itself, is, as theauthor himself admits, not pertinent to the present association in whichthe archeranist appears to have extensive authority.Lines5–9Fights among association members appear to have been a serious prob-lem (cf. Raubitschek1981,96,98). The two most closely related Atticdocuments also contain clauses which deal with them. SeeLSCG51.72Ð102and53.40Ð44with commentary.Line8*U\u0010νανκα: an adverb. See ThreatteGAIII64.0667(p.410).Lines9–16,34–36Finances. The exact Þnancial details, referred to here in passing, canonly be inferred. It is understood that the archeranist deposited anendowment (*ν1)κηlines9Ð10)23for the sake of providing loans (lines20For the site see Travlos1989,192.21See S. Follet,Athènes au IIeet au IIIesiècle: Études chronologiques et prosopographiques,Paris,1976,158n.2,512,518.22At least Þve decrees of the Orgeones of the Magna Mater (third-second centuryB.C.) date themselves to Mounichion:IGII21314,1315,1327,1328Ð1329(=LSCG48);(Raubitschek1981,95); see alsoIGII21343.23See also below commentary on line43."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"segxxxi 12218534Ð36).24As Raubitchek noted (1981,96,98), no more than threehundred drachmas of the accrued interest may be spent, while theprincipal itself is never to be touched. The association may also earnincome from the following sources: (1) Fines (lines6Ð8,14Ð15,25Ð27,33Ð34); (2) Sale of priesthoods (lines16Ð18); (3) Membership fees (lines42Ð45). Raubitschek observed (1981,96; cf. Vondeling1961,161)thatitwas nowhere stated that the archeranist made any proÞt for himself. Itis still worth noting that, while the membership fee is paid to thetreasurer, payment for priesthoods goes directly to the archeranist. Onewonders whether this has any signiÞcance.Line13The insertion ofNδ%Uεis perplexing. It seems (Raubitschek1981,96) torepresent some afterthought regarding the sum of the Þne.Line16Forν%σ(8+%μαι, meaning Ôto put aside for oneselfÕ etc. (LSJ s.v.ν%σ(8+ωII3) see C.

RaubitchekÕs accent probably makes this the Þrstdocumented case from mainland Greece. The buyer would obviouslyreceive here a double portion of any offering. The reference to sucha dispensation as ÔcustomaryÕ (*U N1%υςline19)mayserveasasadreminder of our limited knowledge of contemporary local cult prac-tice.25If we read\u0006ερεωσ?ν|[ω]ν, the reference here would probably beto buying priestly prerogatives (see above commentary on3.5; cf.

Raubitchek (1981,316Ð317) noted that twodifferent processes might be envisioned: (1) If the verb is translated Ôtorestore,Õ26one has to assume that the contractors receive the money forbuying the goods from the treasurer, sell the meals to the members, andthus restore the funds. (2) If the verb is translated Ôto hand over/give,Õ27the contractors receive the money from the treasurer and use it toprovide meals, either free or not, to the members.Lines23–27It is not clear what exactly is meant by the wordπαννυ\"ιστα8. Raubit-schek (1981,97) took these all-nighters to be night watchmen entrustedwith the task of watching over the property of the association and itsmembers on nights of meeting days. Pritchett (1987,188n.25) preferredto regard them as ancient precursors of modern nightclub bouncers,whose duty was to maintain order during night meetings.

Althoughκ\u0010πρ%ςmay beused for a domestic pig, I do not see any reason to doubt37that thepresentκ\u0010πρ%ςis indeed a wild boar.

Handling the victim should have also been fairly easy,since, as is indicated by its weight (ca. twenty pounds), it must not havebeen a full-grown boar but a piglet, and a relatively small one.The choice of a wild boar for a sacriÞce to Heracles should not beparticularly surprising considering HeraclesÕ wild attributes.38Boars areoccasionally sacriÞced to other divinities elsewhere.39Lines38–39Raubitschek himself considered his restoration[τ].8σι(i.e. forτ8σει,dativeofτ8σις), which he translated Ôby making a payment,Õ uncertain. Onecan only concur with his reservations40and hope that a better restora-tion will be suggested in the future.It seems more probable that the minae refer to the weight of thevictim than to its price since the price of twenty minae would beastronomical.

Argive inßu-ence may be evident in both script and dialect. Nevertheless, as Mi-chael Jameson has pointed out to me, the similarities between theArgive and Tirynthian scripts and dialects are not necessarily dueto Argive inßuence; both could simply have developed from a com-mon source.

According tothis interpretation, theπλατιW%8ν%ιwould be a college of priests, sacredcup-bearers, in a cult of Zeus or Athena, in charge of libation at cere-monies, comparable to the so-called sacred men of the Andania myster-ies regulations,LSCG65.1Ð3, who take their oath while libating bloodand wine.26The comparison, as Kevin Clinton pointed out to me, isinvalid: the libation of blood and wine at Andania is merely a partof the oath ritual, not a duty of the office. DuboisÕ interpretation wasemployed by Hansen (1984) in an attempt to reconstruct a religiousamphictyony in Tiryns on the basis of the reference to ahieromnemon.It is worth noting that dignitaries whose title is a compound of ÔwineÕand ÔlordÕ (or ÔmasterÕ) are not unheard of in the ancient Near East.In a series of Hittite texts, we meet an official entitled GAL.GEÿsTIN(Ôwine lord.Õ Sumerograms are used throughout; the exact Hittite word-ing is unknown). The reference is mostly to a military office althoughcivilian office is also documented.27The Akkadianrab karani(= Sume-rian GAL.GEÿsTIN) is attested in neo-Assyrian documents.28This titleappears to be echoed in the Old TestamentÕs\u0002\"\u0003\t\r\u000e%(Rab-shakeh;ÔChief of Cup-BearersÕ).29It is beyond question that theplatiwoinoiare subjected to theplati-woinarchoi.

The existence of a sanctuary of Athena in Tiryns, perhapson the Acropolis and so probably of Athena Polias, as the Þrst editorshave argued, is supported by a few other Þnds, all from the Acropo-lis or its immediate surroundings. Among these is a potsherd bearingthe inscriptionJΑ1ανα8ας *μ8(I belong to Athena).36Nevertheless, thesanctuary on the Acropolis of Tiryns had previously been attributedto Hera and the Þrst editorsÕ reattribution to Athena has been ques-tioned.37True, literary sources say nothing about a cult of Athena inTiryns. Pausanias (2.17.5), on the other hand, saw a wooden statueof Hera at the Argive Heraion that had been brought from Tiryns.38But considering ArgosÕ subsequent complete subjugation of Tiryns, itis entirely possible for a local cult of Athena to have been terminatedwithout leaving any traces in the literary tradition. Accordingly, evenif the dialect and the script could betray Argive inßuenceÑand this isin and of itself questionableÑ39these fragments strongly suggest thatin this period Tiryns was religiously independent of Argos; its poliaddivinities were not Hera but rather Zeus and Athena.Block5For thehieromnemonsee above.taries ad loc. and esp.

Matthaiou and Pikoulas dated the fragment to the second cen-tury B.C. on the basis of letter forms, which are somewhat rustic look-ing. If so, it postdates, as they suggest, the other sacred law from Lyco-sura, the neatly and elegantly inscribedLSCG68, commonly dated tothe third century B.C.11This inscription opens with regulations forentry into the sanctuary. The same can be assumed for the presentfragment but, in so far as this can be judged, the two documents mighthave been somewhat different. Whereas what survives here deals withcathartic requirements,LSCG68lists various restrictions with respect toclothing, jewelry, and hair style, also prohibiting pregnant and nursingwomen from being initiated. It ends presently with sacriÞcial regula-tions;12concern with sacriÞce is also evident at the end of the presentfragment though the details of the older inscription have been left out.The documents seem therefore somewhat complementary.Loucas and Loucas1994assume that the publication of the twodocuments in relatively close succession reßects a wish to reassert thesanctuaryÕs rules in face of a growing inßux of worshippers and/or toput them on a par with the rules of contemporary great sanctuaries.The CultÔThe Arcadians worship Despoina (the Mistress) more than any othergod, saying that she is a daughter of Poseidon and Demeter.Õ Thus saysPausanias,13adding that he dares not reveal her real name to the unini-tiated.14In the preceding paragraphs he had described meticulouslythe sanctuary of Despoina at Lycosura with its imposing cult statuegroup.

Among these are the heads of Artemis, Deme-ter, and Anytus, as well as a remarkable fragment of marble drapery,belonging to the robe of Despoina, with reliefs depicting, inter alia, ani-mals, or rather humans masked as animals and wearing long dresses,some of whom are playing musical instruments, and others dancing.17Pausanias informs us that Ôthe Arcadians carry into the sanctuaryfruits of all cultivated trees except the pomegranateÕ.18As for the meth-od of sacriÞce practiced in themegaronwhere the mysteries were cele-brated, he says that each of the Arcadians sacriÞces whatever he owns,but instead of slashing the victimÕs throat, as in other sacriÞces, theycut offwhatever limb of the sacriÞcial animal each happens to grab.19While practically nothing else may be said with certainty, it is stillconceivable that the dancing scene described above and other scenesengraved on the robe of Despoina might reßect some of the activitiestaking place at the mysteries.20The temple in Lycosura is quite small.

He noted thatit was a sacred law enumerating offerings and sacriÞces to a divinity,2and referred to it in his note on the stipulation inLSCG69.30Ð31(I.Oropos277) that allows worshippers at the Amphiareum to sacriÞcewhatever animal they wish, noting that this license was due to thebroader policy of the sanctuary.3In EBGR1997no.296(Kernos13,2000,206) Chaniotis noted the concern with sacriÞces and referencesto a table of offerings, animals, an amount of two obols, and the leaseof an item (μισ1ωμin line11). InSEGXLVII488he further interpretedthis reference and suggested a number of restorations (see commentarybelow). I have elsewhere suggested that lines5Ð9, which are separatedfrom the previous text by avacat, consist of a sacriÞcial tarifflisting feesto be paid by worshippers for the sacriÞce of speciÞc animals.4Line2Τραπε+is doubtless a reference to a cult table.

Thisκωλ:is likely a priestly2I.Oroposp.183.3I.Oroposp.182.4Lupu2003. As for the occasion, pre-incubation sacriÞce is not inevitable. Thetariffwould give the unparalleled stipulation inLSCG69.30Ð31that allowed eachperson to sacriÞce whatever he wished a more deÞnite form (the closest parallel toLSCG69.30Ð31,LSS67.3Ð4, is wholly restored and somewhat unwarranted in mymind; even if it is correct, it is to be explained by a departure from the rule(s) listedin lines1Ð2). From PausaniasÕ description of the sanctuary and cult of Amphiaraus atOropus (1.34.5), a ram on whose skin incubants would sleep seems mandatory. But, ashas been noted (see A.B. Petropoulou ÔPausanias1.34.5: Incubation on a Ram Skin,Õin G. Argoud and P. Roesch, (eds.),La Béotie antique. Lyon—Saint-Étienne16–20Mai1983(Colloques internationaux du CNRS), Paris,1985,169Ð177, at175Ð176; van Straten1995,73Ð74), the incubant in the Archinos relief is lying on a piece of cloth. Thereis therefore reason to believe that pre-incubation ram sacriÞce was the norm at theAmphiareum but not necessarily the rule whileLSCG69was in effect. The rule mighthave allowed more choice, at least in the fourth century B.C.5For some representative cases seeLSCG90.5(=I.Kallatis47.3);163.17;LSAM24A15Ð20.

(2) Did the Acraephian ambassadors invite the Haliartansto participate in one event or two? These questions must be addressedagainst the background of the Ptoia.The history of the Ptoia may be roughly summarized as follows.As we know it, the Ptoia was a musical competition in honor of thePtoan Apollo. It was celebrated in his oracular sanctuary, the Ptoion,at modern Perdikovrysi. This sanctuary is not to be confused with thenearby sanctuary of the hero Ptoios at modern Kastraki.10The festivalwas founded at an unknown date. It underwent two reorganizations:one in the220s,11the other in ca.120B.C. In the Þrst reorganiza-tion the Ptoia became Pan-Boeotian when, under the auspices of theDelphic amphictyony, the city of Acraephia formally invited Boeotiancities to share in it. A number of inscriptions document this reorgani-zation. These include the amphictyonic decree and a related oracle12and a series of decrees of Boeotian cities accepting AcraephiaÕs invita-tion: one from Oropus13and fragments of four more from Acraephia9I append here a short list of select difficult Boeotian forms:Line3.αTτ/= Att.αTτG3(Buck,GD30,106.2);π#τ=πρ#ς(ibid.135.6).Lines4–5.πρισγε0ας: Acc. pl. <πρισγε?ςi.e. Att.πρ\u0013σ\u000fυς(ibid68.1,86.3, and cf. no.40.18).Line7.παρακαλ0=παρακαλε0(ibid.29).Line9.κ)=κα8(ibid.26).Line11.τ/=τG3(ibid.30,106.2.

He datedthe inscription to ca.235Ð230B.C.17This date is mainly based onletter forms and on a possible identiÞcation of the proposer of thedecree, Hermaios son of Epiteles, with the Hermaios who was a federalarchon ca.235Ð215.18His father might have been the Epiteles whowas one of the two Boeotianhieromnemonesat Delphi ca.230.19As hasbeen said above, the decrees that document the Þrst reorganizationof the Ptoia include two which were passed by the city of Oropus.Rejecting FeyelÕs inference that the fragment from Acraephia is a copyof the inscription from Oropus, Roesch (1982,237Ð241) postulated a twodecree mechanism: one decree, designed for the Ptoion at Acraephia,should have dealt with accepting only; the other, designed for Oropus,should have dealt with speciÞc details. Since a decree from Haliartusexists among the above mentioned decrees from Acraephia, he appliedthis mechanism to Haliartus, connecting the present document to thereorganization of the Ptoia.The validity of RoeschÕs arguments was questioned by Stephanis(1982,221Ð222), who suggested Acraephia as the site, the Ptoia as theevent, and Zeus and Athena as the recipients of the sacriÞce. It wasfurther challenged by Rigsby, who maintained that one polis wouldnot invite another to join in a sacriÞce at the otherÕs sanctuary, andsuggesting that the embassy delivered one invitation: to send cavalry-men to a contestduringthe Ptoia and a bovine to be sacriÞced at thatevent to Zeus and Athena.

The con-test and the sacriÞce should be held at atemenosof Athena Itonia andZeus Karaios. A cavalry contest in honor of Athena Itonia would makemore sense, since she was a military divinity and delighted in horses.20It would be a local rehearsal competition for the games of the Pam-boeotia which were held at the sanctuary of Athena Itonia in Coronea.The document is to be dated somewhere between the230s and the200s, after the Pan-Hellenization of the Mouseia21and before the Ptoiawere made Pan-Boeotian. It is not to be connected to the Haliartandecree from Acraephia, and the two decree mechanism postulated byRoesch should be discarded.22Schachter (1981Ð1994, III,20Ð21) accepted RigsbyÕs arguments re-garding the location of the sacriÞce. However, he too assumed two dif-ferent requests. The Þrst, which occasioned the present decree, wouldbe to join in a sacriÞce to Zeus and Athena. The second would be tosend cavalrymen to a contest at the Ptoia; this should have been dealtwith in another decree. The motive for the sacriÞce is to be adducedfrom the presence of thethesmophylakes. In charge of legal matters, thesemagistrates were instrumental in settling some dispute between the twocities. The sacriÞce to Zeus and Athena celebrated this settlement.Developing RoeschÕs hypothesis (1982,242Ð243), Schachter postulatedthat cavalry contests in honor of the hero Ptoios were held in the sixthand Þfth centuries.23This would still have been the case in the thirdcentury. The reorganization of the contest thus should have consistedin a transformation of the cavalry Ptoia in honor of the hero Ptoiosinto the Ptoia known to us, i.e. a musical contest in honor of Apollo. Itwould have taken place after the present document was issued.It is true that small bronzes of horsemen and charioteers, miniaturebronze wheels, and chariots were discovered, among other sixth to Þfth-century B.C. votive offerings, during the excavations of the sanctuary ofthe hero Ptoios.24The discovery of comparable objects during the exca-20Cf.

Rigsby adds (p.739) that a joint military success like avictory of the Boeotians and Demetrius II in the Megarid ca.236could have promptedthe invitation. The evidence which places this Demetrius in the Megarid at this timemay be inconclusive. See F.W. WalbankCAH2VII, I,450.231981Ð1994, III,19,20Ð21. Roesch in his turn had followed P. Guillon and M. Feyel(see next note). He postulated that this cavalry contest was in honor of either the heroPtoios or the Ptoan Apollo. For references see loc. cit.24Roesch1982,242Ð243; Schachter1981Ð1994, III,14.

The Amphiareum atOropus does not seem suitable at all for cavalry competitions, yet thelocal festival featured them.27They ought to have been held somewherein the vicinity. A similar situation is not unthinkable for the Ptoion.Accordingly, the location of the cavalry race referred to in the presentdocument remains, in my opinion, undecided. Strictly speaking, boththe hero sanctuary and the Ptoion may be possible.Date.

GYMNASIARCHAL LAW.FIRST THIRD OF THE SECOND CENTURY B.C.1A tapered, opisthographic stele of white marble with a molding on top. Belowline20face A is badly damaged by erosion. The stone, which had been usedas the covering, probably of an early Christian tomb, was discovered in1949by the brothers E. and C. Karantoumani on their land at Palaiophoros, at thesouth entrance to Beroia. It was then used by the Þnders as a ramp in theirgarden and eventually removed to the Museum at Thessaloniki and from thereto the newly built museum in Beroia. The inscription, Þrst published in a pro-visional form by Cormack, had been known to a number of scholars, includingM.P. Nilsson2and J. and L. Robert,3through copies made by B.G. Kallipolitisand C. Makaronas. MakaronasÕ copy of face A4includes parts which, as thelatest editors affirm, cannot be read now, and may never have been legible.I have followed the latest editors in underlining these parts and in translatingthem only where their sense is clear.5H.1.755; W.0.407, (top),0.450(bottom); Th.0.142(top),0.165(bottom),0.195(molding).

A text and translation with a condensed apparatus of the entire inscriptionand some notes (consisting mainly of references to Gauthier and Hatzopoulos1993) onparts not dealt with here have nevertheless been included so as to facilitate the readingof the entire document. The lemma lists all editions of the text but only discussionspertaining to the Hermaia are mentioned. For a full bibliography down to1994seeGauthier and Hatzopoulos andI.Beroia1.

The Homeric Hymns,however, seem to know nothing of this.13HermesÕ patronage of the gymnasium proved beneÞcial for all sides.Despite his importance, Hermes could claim for himself practically nomajor public festival.14But at local gymnasia, which are to be countedamong the hallmark institutions whose very existence made a Greekcity a Greek city15and are thus known to have existed all over theGreek world, Hermes was at last honored with his very own festival, theHermaia. The gymnasium may be portrayed as a crossroads of Greekcivic life, where exercise, education, and socializing all come together.While we hear nothing real of education in the present document, it isstill notable that the young menÕs gymnastic and military16curriculumalone would not be complete without a religious dimension. This is11But cf. (e.g.) Farnell1896Ð1909, V,29Ð30; H. Herter,RhM119,1976,229Ð230.12Both are included among the oath-gods listed in A26,[55Ð56].13Farnell1896Ð1909, V,29.

ByHellenistic times the diffusion of the Hermaia was as wide as was thediffusion of gymnasia. The festival is documented all around the Greekworld, and one may assume that, as it was as essential for gymnasiaas gymnasia were for a Greek city, it existed even in places wheredocumentation is currently lacking.18The high point of the competitions at the Hermaia and of the festivalitself appears to be the torch-race. The end of this race would be thelighting of the Þre on the altar of Hermes (see below). This done,the sacriÞce to Hermes would be performed and a sacriÞcial banquetwould follow. The festival was celebrated in Hyperberetaios, the lastmonth of the official year. ÔThe competitions, the sacriÞce, and thesacriÞcial banquet thus solemnized the end of a year of training forthe frequenters of the gymnasium and the end of his tenure for thegymnasiarchÕ (Gauthier and Hatzopoulos1993,97).As this document has been amply commented upon, the commentarydiscusses only a few points.19B46Despite the lack of a time indicator (such asπρ#) with the verb1?ω, thesacriÞce referred to here may be some preliminary sacriÞce rather thanthe sacriÞce referred to later following the torch-race.

Thehieropoioihere29must be members of the gymna-sium (hence young men) and not city officials as Knoepßer (1979,178)realized. Similarly, an agonistic inscription from Chalcis,SEGXXIX809,30lists children who served ashieropoioiat local Hermaia.31This isnot surprising, as the office ofhieropoios(most references are to a collegeofheiropoioi) is deÞned by its functionÑchießy cult administrationÑnotby the functionaries and their affiliation; the office may be encoun-tered in a variety of organized bodies, including cities, sanctuaries, andad hoc organizations,32as long as cultic activity plays a part in theiragenda.B63τ%7πι#ν:τ\u0012 *πι#ν(sc.)Nτ%ς.B65–66Division of the Meat and Banquets.

Its hallmark isthat, though the animal undergoes a primary division according to itsnatural parts, by the time butchery is completed, it has been entirelydivided into portions of meat, evidently equal in weight (rather thanin quality). Another mode common in ordinary Greek eaten sacriÞceleaves some parts of the victim whole; it is met perhaps more oftenthan the mode employed here in sacred laws.33Generally speaking, inthat case speciÞc parts or cuts are assigned as prerogatives to cult per-sonnel, preeminently priests, or other officials (namely in public sacri-29See Gauthier and Hatzopoulos1993,110Ð112.30Knoepßer1979and see ibid.178Ð179for childrenhieropoioi.31Note, however, that here the sacriÞce following the torch-race of the boys is takencare of by thepaidotribai.

Officials may sometimes receivesuch portions as or as a part of their prerogatives.35Unless consumptionon the spot is required, the meatÑin certain cases clearly distributedrawÑmay be taken away and consumed elsewhere.36Here, on the other hand, no prerogatives are prescribed; those whoare to share the meat contribute equally toward the costs of the ani-mal, and the meat is to be distributed among them in equal portions.The reference to portions of raw meat is probably related to this. Themeat would not be distributed raw; rather it would be weighed raw.The portions would then be cooked and distributed among the partici-pants in the sacriÞcial banquets.37Weighing meat while raw is explicitlyprescribed in a comparable context inLSCG98from Coressia on Ceos,as Gauthier and Hatzopoulos have noted (1993,112Ð113): a banquet isto be held; the refreshments include wine and dried fruits; meat servingper person consists of a given amountweighed rawper person;38weigh-ing is assigned to the appropriate officials (lines11Ð16).39As for the ban-quets, one ought to agree with Gauthier and Hatzopoulos (1993,113)that two such banquets were held, probably in two separate rooms, onefor the boys with theirpaidotribaiand one for the young men with the34But cf.LSS14.55whereμερ8δεςrefer more generally to parts of the victims.35As in20.7below (private sacriÞce).

He dates the document to shortly before110B.C., around thetime when, at the end of the period of the Scythian-Chersonesian wars,as is vividly described in the ca.107B.C. Chersonesian decree for theMithridatic general Diophantos,IOSPEI2352(Syll.3709),2the city wentunder the rule of Mithridates Eupator. Makarov adds that a concernwith the institution of the ephebia is appropriate in this period.3Hethinks that the appearance, probably through the agency of Delphi, ofa postulated cult of Zeus Kathyperdexios, an epithet documented onceinSEGXV427,4which he assumes, mainly on the basis of the some-what rare cult of Zeus Hyperdexios, had both gymnastic and militarycharacteristics, also beÞts the period.52For bibliography see A.

One might assume that the date wasinscribed in the part now lost above, but the stone gives the impressionthat not much is missing on the top. The fragment may be regardedas an independent document, and the fact that nothing was inscribedbelow the preserved text seems to corroborate this. KostomitsopoulosÕassumption that the stone could originally have been built into a wallor an altar is plausible.Date. KostomitsopoulosÕ plausible dating of the inscription to themid-third century B.C. is based upon letter forms and orthography.Lines1–2The fragmentary word in line1probably referred to Apollo or to thevictim (ed. pr.122).JΕν#λμι%ς(Ôsitting at the tripodÕ), which might be1See Part I pp.69Ð70."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"segxxxviii 786273epigraphically possible, is an epithet of Apollo attested in SophoclesFr.1044.2The epithetJΕν#δι%ςis unattested and probably inappropriatefor Apollo.3It also seems to me epigraphically impossible.fΕν%ρ\"%ς(or rather*ν#ρ\"αςÔuncastratedÕ) gives fairly good sense, but seemsincompatible with the remains on the stone and may also be too long.Ed. pr. notes (122) that a place name is also possible.The goat has close relations with Apollo and seems to be a favoritesacriÞcial animal of his.4ApolloÕs altar in Delos, which enjoyed greatrenown in antiquity, was made of goat horns.5Remains of horns ofsacriÞced young goats were discovered during the excavations of aGeometric sanctuary of Apollo at Dreros, Crete.6Kostomitsopoulos argued that the word\"8μαρ%ςretains here its lit-eral meaning, Ôa one winter-old he-goat,Õ7and, accordingly, that thesacriÞce would take place in early spring.

Regrettably, one must admit that the circumstancesunder which the present sacriÞce is to be performed are by no meansclear: it is not entirely self evident why the sacriÞce is to be performedby the eldest of the tribe. To a certain extent, this obscurity relates tothe scantiness of unambiguous information regarding the tribal organi-zation of Rhodes, both before and after the synoecism of408/7. Muchhas been written about this problem. Nevertheless, proposed explana-tions, as reasonable as they are, and as much as they help to clarifythe problem, involve a great deal of assumptions and deductions.9Kos-tomitsopoulos suggested (1988,122) that the sacriÞce is to be performedby the eldest of the tribe instead of a priest because it took place at theannual meeting of the tribe, when the tribesmen elected their officials.The he-goat is to be offered to Apollo since he would help the processwith his mantic power. This may or may not be the case. At any rate,the role of the eldest of the tribe was probably to preside over the sac-riÞcial event and perhaps to take an active part in whatever stages of itwere essential parts of the ritual (as opposed to (e.g.) mere butchery anddivision of the victimÕs meat), such as placing offerings on the altar, say-ing prayers, and pouring libations.

The procedure might not have been completelyuniform and the documentary evidence may not always be in agree-ment with the literary tradition, which is more detailed in respect tothe actual puriÞcation. It is also noteworthy that the Cyrene documentis mainly interested in the procedure itself, originally private, now state-endorsed.12While the present document is likely to have shown a simi-lar interest, the punitive measures suggest that a concern for abuses ofthe procedure contributed to its promulgation.Date. Kontorini (1989,18) dated the inscription to the third centuryB.C. on the basis of an agreement between letter forms and the generalcharacter of the writing.Line54(ικετε?ων V δεκ#μ[εν%ς]: The two participles refer to two actionsperformed by one and the same individual.Δεκ#μ[εν%ς]correspondsto the [hυ]π%δεκ#μεν%ςat Selinus (27B3Ð4below), and refers tohosting the homicide, as it seems, at home.13JΑ(ικετε?εινought tomean something like Ôact as an agent in supplicationÕ as is suggestedby the requirement at Cyrene (LSS115B50Ð51) that the homicideÕsarrival be announced, in all probability by the host, to some sort of a9zς δJ OτJ `ν =νδρ’ =τη πυκινM λ\u0010\u000fCη, Oς τJ *ν2 π\u0010τρCη|(3τα κατακτε8νας =λλων*U8κετ% δ:μ%ν|4νδρ\u0012ς *ς 4(νει%/, κτλ(And as when sore infatuation takes over a manwho, having killed a mortal in his land, would come (as a suppliant) to another land to(the house) of a wealthy man, etc.).10Παρελ1oν δ\u0005 %jτ%ς *ς τ\u0003 Κρ%8σ%υ %5κ8α κατ\u0003 ν#μ%υς τ%@ς *πι\"ωρ8%υς κα1αρσ8%υ*δ\u0013ετ% *πικυρ:σαι, Κρ%0σ%ς δ\u0013 μιν *κ\u00101ηρε.

On the puriÞcation of a homicide, see ingeneral Parker1983,370Ð374(cf.386Ð388). For the host Clinton (1996a,176Ð177) addsAesch.Choe.291Ð296.

The hostÕs mostimportant action, puriÞcation, is unfortunately not referred to here. Itseems to include washing at Selinus14and at Cyrene, where the hostseats the homicide on a white ßeece (B52Ð54). The use of the blood ofa slaughtered animal, namely a piglet, in the puriÞcation is prevalentin the literary tradition and described vividly by Aeschylus15and, atgreater length, by Apollonius Rhodius.16Epigraphy is, however, silenton this detail.17Lines6–7The Goddess. Kontorini (1989,25) seems right in asserting that, owing tothe relative importance of the decree, the deity referred to here oughtto be Athena Lindia, the most important deity of Lindus. She seemsto have been a pre-Greek divinity whom the Dorian settlers identiÞedwith Athena. Her priest was the eponymous magistrate of Lindus.18Lines7–9Heralds and Priests. As Kontorini noted, the Lindian heralds are to bematched with the announcer (πρ%αγγελτ)ρ) of the third Cyrene para-graph,19who seems to be leading a sort of silent procession, obviouslyannouncing the presence of the homicide and the danger of pollution(LSS115B53Ð55; cf. Parker1983,371).20There is no mention of a publiccrier at Selinus, but the importance of a public proclamation is manifestin B2Ð3; see further commentary on no.27below.In the reference to priests Kontorini recognized the second Cyreneparagraph, assuming that the priests are to purify the suppliants and,accordingly, supplementing[V μM κα1α8ρω|]ντιor[V μM Bγν8+ω]|ντι.2114See further below commentary on27B4Ð5.15Eum.280Ð283,448Ð450; cf.LIMCIII64s.v.

The priestsmight be instrumental at other stages of the procedure. Conceivably,the suppliant Þrst takes refuge in a sanctuary (cf. below commentaryon18.8Ð9); in this case, the priests might have to help in matching himwith a host. They can also step into the process if it ends with sac-riÞce at a sanctuary (cf. the sacriÞce Ôon the public altarÕ at Selinus,27B10with commentary). The fact that they are mentioned togetherwith the heralds is possibly signiÞcant and suggestsÑthe preeminenceof the host notwithstandingÑthat religious authorities take part in theprocedure.22Lines10–11Kontorini tentatively prefers the restoration[5ερ%συλ8]|ας(cf. Chaniotis1996,71n.20) to[\u0006κετε8]|ας, assuming a revision of the clause onhiketeiain a general law onhierosylia.23Perhaps the present decree couldsupplement a narrower law on supplication, possibly in a sanctuary,24which had not considered the special case of supplication of a homicideor had done so unsatisfactorily.Lines13–15By analogy to three other Rhodian inscriptions that mentionpoletai(Þnancial officials, documented mostly in Athens, Rhodes, and Cos) inare nowhere to be found in the second Cyrene paragraph. Their presence might beinferred from the reference to a public sanctuary, but their function in the bizarre pro-ceedings remains unknown; no allusion seems to me to be made to their participationin puriÞcation.22The verb4δικ\u0013ω(\u0006κ\u0013την μM 4δικε0νLSAM75.7,9; cf.

Most earlierscholars including Servais (1960) preferred to see them as real humansuppliants. H.J. Stukey27suggested that they were all supernatural be-ings. R. Parker (1983,344Ð351) accepted this for the Þrsthikesios, main-taining that the other two, and certainly the third, were human.W. Burkert28reasserted that all threehikesioiwere supernatural beings.ParkerÕs interpretation still seems best to me. Demanding that all threehikesioibelong to one and the same category is understandable butsomewhat simplistic, as the arrangement of ancient legal texts may notfollow modern logic.29While dwelling on the differences between them,we have forgotten that all threehikesioiare related semantically and bytheir potential to pollute. A modern code would not group under thesame heading a supernatural visitant and a human suppliant. But thisdoes not mean that the promulgators of this code (ascribed to Apolloin the heading)30would have not done so.

The Andanian mysteries regulations,LSCG65, devoteone paragraph (lines99Ð103) to the subject;LSCG92.32Ð35(Eretria) is11Plural.12Both parties are required to deposit the payment for the court; the winning partygets his deposit back.13There are numerous examples.IGXIV645(Habicht ibid.) is particularly notable.For a discussion and bibliography see Soverini1991,62Ð63,86Ð94passim.

They ought to have beenspeciÞed elsewhere, probably in thediagrapheto which this seems tobe a supplement (lines4Ð5).16Conceivably the publication was directednot only at the lessor and the lessees, i.e. the authorities and the shop-keepers, but also at visitors to the sanctuary, both welcome and unwel-come. The document emphasizes points which may concern its entireaudience: prohibiting unwanted elements from engaging in retail trade(¤2) protects the licensed shopkeepers against competition; it may alsobe addressed at the unwanted elements themselves, in an attempt toscare them away.17Similarly, prohibiting the shopkeepers from handingover their shops to unwanted elements (¤3) and from assisting runawayslaves (¤5), though formally addressing the shopkeepers, is equally rel-evant to these unwelcome persons, encouraging them in fact to avoidthe sanctuary altogether.18The stipulations concerning settling disputes(¤7Ð9) certainly concern not only the shopkeepers and the officials butalso visitors.Even though the archaeological evidence allows reconstructing thedevelopment of the Heraion with some degree of accuracy,19knowledgeof Samian cult practice remains meager due to lack of adequate evi-dence. A coherent exposition on the local religion, possible to a certainextent for islands such as Cos or Rhodes, is thus impossible for Samos.20Regrettably, the present inscription is of little help in this respect.

They concludethat the present inscription, which dates to ca.245/4B.C., reßectsa Samian attempt (in response to PtolemyÕs command) to have theadministration of the Heraion conform to the mode of administrationpracticed in Alexandria.23Since this document has been amply commented upon elsewhere, thecommentary here is limited to a few points.Line1The eponymous magistrate of Hellenistic Samos was thedemiourgos.The office was held by one or two magistrates at a time. See Shipley1987,211with note39,221Ð222with note85,305; Habicht1972,216and no.10(IGXII6,2).The Samian year appears to have begun, like the Athenian, with theÞrst moon after the summer solstice. On the succession of the monthssee Hallof1999. Gauthier24makes a case for preferring HabichtÕs Kro-nion (twelfth month of the year) to HallofÕs Artemision (eighth monthof the year).Line3The Samianneopoiaiwere a board of temple curators of the Heraion.In this document the office seems to have an overall legal character: theneopoiai, who brought forward the present charter (lines2Ð3), imposeÞnes (¤3,7), listen to claims, and take actions to court (¤6). Their21In general see Sinn1993, esp.95Ð97; Dillon1997,204Ð221,227.22Fragmentsaandbof this inscription were Þrst published by Habicht1957, no.59(pl.134); fragmentcby Hallof and Mileta1997. Habicht (1972,212) was the Þrst tonotice the similarity in the hands. In his study of Samian hands Tracy (1990,75) hasindependently reached the same conclusion, ascribing both stones to the same cutter.23Hallof and Mileta1997,263Ð264. See also Hallof inIGXII6I p.133.

The right of asylum enabled anyone,including Ôpessimi servitiorum, obaerati, suspecti capitalium crimi-num,Õ30as Tacitus puts it,31to enjoy it by taking refuge at a sanctuary.Once a person had presented himself as a suppliant, the sanctuaryÕsauthorities were forced to investigate whether the suppliantÕs cause wasjust, and if so, to offer him legal help and to mediate between him andhis pursuers.32Suppliants thus became a real burden for sanctuaries. Itis therefore all the more interesting to see how the authorities of theHeraion try to deal with this problem.The inscription seems to distinguish between two types of suppli-ants:33(1) runaway slaves (line21) and (2) all other suppliants, obviouslyfree persons. Both appear to be unwelcome, but the treatment of run-away slaves seems more strict. The shopkeepers are to offer them nei-ther employment34nor food. As for other suppliants, taking their resi-dence at the sanctuary as a given,35the authorities appear to attemptto make their living conditions harder: they are not allowed to engage25Cf.

These restrictions make it clear that living at the sanctuarywill be very difficult, if not impossible, for prospective suppliants, andit is conceivable that they were listed, at least in part, in the hope thatsuppliants, like other unwelcome visitors, would avoid the Heraion inthe Þrst place. In other words, the authorities of the sanctuary appearto try to eliminate the problem before it arises.36As is evident fromIGXII6,156,37runaway slaves in the precinctof the Heraion38and the jurisdiction of theneopoiaiwere discussed in aletter of Ptolemy III around the time of the present inscription.39Muchlater, in A.D23, the inviolability of the Heraion was ratiÞed by theRoman senate.40Line13On the formulaτρ#πωι %7δ\u0005 παρευρ\u0013σει %7δεμιPιsee J.

It cannot bemuch later, since the letters of both decrees appear to be similar.2The exact reasons that brought the local religious authorities to revisethe regulations within a short period of time are unknown. The twoessential points inBare the assignment of the victimÕs head to thepriestess at a public sacriÞce (lines18Ð19), where she had not receivedany part of the victim inA, and the punishment clause (lines21Ð23).Bis evidently an afterthought, reßecting some general dissatisfaction withA. Considering the addition of an actual part of the victim to the graingiven to the priestess inAand the punishment,Bcould also reßect amore particular dissatisfaction on the part of the cult personnel withthe distribution of the sacriÞcial parts prescribed inA, being an attemptto deal with the possible outcomes (i.e. cult personnel taking additionalportions) of this dissatisfaction.Date. Koumanoudis and Matthaiou dated the inscriptions on thebasis of the genitive singular inø%, the omission ofιinπ%8Cη(lines2,[5];note, however, the transition toscriptio plenainB),3and on the shortenedintroductory formulas.4Line1Rhodes (1997,230) found Koumanoudis and MatthaiouÕs[πρυτ\u0010νεωνγν].\tμηunsatisfactory: the wordπρυτ\u0010νεις(in the plural) is not attestedin contemporary Chian inscriptions;5surviving Chian documents em-2Koumanoudis and Matthaiou1985,109.3Althoughηι>ηoccurs in the dative singular of the Þrst declension, it seems ex-tremely rare at this time in the third singular subjunctive.

As Koumanoudis and Mat-thaiou understood, the sacriÞce is offered by the city but the prerog-atives are the same as those prescribed for private sacriÞce. Otherwise,it is difficult to see the need for a separate stipulation.51If, as it appears,this occasion consists of a libation ceremony combined with sacriÞce,σπ%νδα8seems preferable toσπ%νδ).52As regards the verb, the middleis used in the calendar of Cos,LSCG151A40:53*πε2 δ\u0005 κα σπ%νδ\u0003ς48Koumanoudis and Matthaiou1985,108.49PausaniasÕ (2.35.11) discussion of the sanctuary and worship of Eileithyia in Her-mione seems to imply the same.

The office ofbasileusis mentioned in the so-calledConsti-tution of Chios55line4(mid-sixth century B.C.), and abasileus, perhapsthe head of a college,56is referred to inDGE688C8(Þfth centuryB.C.).

The head or a half of it is a relatively commonpriestly prerogative.57When given to the priest, it might not include thetongue. In fact, inLSS121.20(Ephesus) Ôthe head, the tongue, and the54The middle seems prevalent in CasabonaÕs1966,261Ð262review of the literaryevidence. See alsoI.Kalch13.11;[IGII21325,29Ð30].

Le Guen-Pollet (1991,20Ð21)makes a good case for the victimÕs brain. The brain is rarely mentionedin sacred laws. InLSCG151A54it is given to coppersmiths and potterswho seem lowest in the hierarchical list of those speciÞcally entitled to apart of the victim. InLSS93.2the brain is listed among other parts thatare very likely to be priestly prerogatives, although this is not stated.The fact that it is not explicitly mentioned elsewhere may be ascribedto a prohibition against eating the brain or even mentioning it by namediscussed in Athenaeus2.65fÐ66c.62This prohibition was neverthelessignored. In Athenaeus4.147d a whole, boiled head of a milk-fed kidis served cut in halves. Even though the brain is not mentioned, therecould be little doubt that its consumption is the point. The Þrst-centuryB.C.agoranomosinscription from the Piraeus,SEGXLVII196, plainlylists brains (A11,16,29,B15,18,24, with Steinhauer1994,64). Wecan therefore conclude that brain-eating was practiced and toleratedeven in cases when explicit reference to it was avoided and that thereis a good chance that, perhaps together with the cheekbones, it was theunspoken end of assigning the head, all the more a snout-, ear-, andperhaps tongue-less head, to a priest.6358Everywhere in Attica the tongue is cut (offfrom the head) separately:Av.1704Ð1705; cf.Pax1060;Pl.1110etc.; see N.

The rather difficultLSS113.1Ð866prescribes a Þne to be exacted from priests who take somethingagainstτ\u0003 sγραμ\u0013να(what is written), unless someone gives it himselffree of pressure.LSCG107.2Ð5stipulates that a priestess who charges toa private person more than what is written in the law be liable to law-suits.67InLSAM59.6Ð7, predominantly occupied with sacriÞcial pre-rogatives, the priest of Zeus Megistos is warned that he will lose hispriesthood and be barred from the sanctuary if he does not act accord-ing to the rules.68More generally, Parker and Obbink2000no.1lines33Ð3569heavily Þnes the priestess of Aphrodite Pandamos and Pontiafor failure to perform any of her inscribed duties and makes her liableto lawsuits. An interesting parallel can be found in the Punic inscrip-tion known as the Marseilles Tariff,KAI69.20Ð21(below Appendix A).It Þnes priests who charge worshippers against what is set in the tar-iffand evidently proceeds to Þne reluctant worshippers.70The exactÞnes remain unknown as the stone is damaged. In1Samuel2:12Ð17,Hophni and Phinehas, EliÕs sons, are reported to have confused thesacriÞcial process, sending their servant to the worshippers sacriÞcing atthe Shiloh sanctuary to grab sacriÞcial portions which did not belong toupon the head of the sacriÞcial animal and then get rid of it by selling it to Greeks or,where this was impossible, by throwing it into the Nile.64Σ(\u0010+ωwould have of course been better but does not Þt the space.65The greedy priest of Asclepius, immortalized by Aristophanes in thePlutus(676Ð681), might come to mind in this context; in fact he is only collecting his due share.

A considerable variety of sacriÞcesis involved and they are to be performed in more than one place (A7,13,14,22(?)). Stavrianopoulou is probably correct in arguing that thiswas a calendar of the city of Eleutherna.2If so, the incompleteness ofthe surviving pantheon stands out: Zeus (A9,17;D2,5) and Artemis(A14,22(?);D6(?)) seem prominent,3but Apollo, the chief divinity ofEleutherna,4is missing.Stavrianopoulou puts forward many restorations, at times suggestingalternative ones, whether in the text or the commentary. Practically allof these are well considered; all are included in the apparatus. Since toooften the fragmentary state of the text precludes any deÞnite conclu-sions, only a few of these restorations are discussed in the commentarybelow.Date.

Summarily, a sanctu-ary of them is known from literary sources, primarily Diodorus Siculus4.79.5Ð80.6,8to have existed in Engyon in Sicily, where their cult issaid to have been brought from Crete. This inscription appears to bethe Þrst epigraphical attestation. As to their identity, Stavrianopoulouprefers to identify the Mothers as divinities who nurtured the babyZeus after his birth in the Idaean cave in Crete, which follows Diodorus(4.80.1Ð2, citing Aratus30Ð35) and accounts for the Cretan connectionsof the cult. The possibility that Demeter might be worshipped herealongside the Mothers under a different title, Megalartos (B3: ed. pr.49Ð50, Stavrianopoulou1993,173Ð175), does not in and of itself seemto me to provide sufficient grounds for rejecting Demeter and Kore ascandidates.7Cf.

The word=δυτ%ν, literally, Ôa sacred place,not to be entered,Õ is commonly understood as the innermost or backchamber in a temple accessible only from the cella, and by extension,the sanctuary or temple itself.9Stavrianopoulou (ed. pr.38) has notedanother reference toadytaof Artemis, theBγν\u0003 =δυταreferred to in asuspect line (1155) in EuripidesÕIphigenia Taurica, where foreigners areto be burnt. Stengel (1920,26) suggested that theseadytacould onlybe sacriÞcial pits, comparable tomegara, in which the victim would beburnt whole. The two terms are, in fact, used interchangeably (togetherwith\"\u0010σματα) in the famous scholion on Lucian80,2.1(275Ð276Rabe),discussing the rite at the Athenian Thesmophoria of depositing pigletsin sacriÞcial pits from which their putreÞed remains were later recov-ered (Stengel loc. cit.; Stavrianopoulou43).10Uncovering the realitiesbehind the suspect Euripidean passage is, however, not simple.11It isnot clear that sacriÞcial pits rather than Ôsanctuary/templeÕ should beunderstood. Euripides is, in fact, consistent in prefering the plural, andit may simply be poetic.12SacriÞcial pits where victims are destroyed,but not burnt, are well known in the cult of Demeter and Kore;13aclear-cut proof for their existence in the cult of Artemis has yet to sur-face.14Considering the obscure context here, it seems best to under-standadytaliterally as Ôsacred places, not to be enteredÕÑthat is by any-one other than authorized personnel15Ñcomparable to=\u000fαταon whichcf. above Part I pp.20Ð21and commentary on1.10.9Stengel1920,25Ð26; Welles,RCpp.309Ð310; M.B.

Baked andcooked cereal offerings are prominent in Israelite sacriÞce, groupedwith other cereal offerings under the category of\u0002\u0003\b\u0015\f\u0018\u0019(min.hah; Lev.2;6:7Ð11;7:9Ð10; Mishnah, (Qodashim)Mena.hot). These offerings wouldeither accompany animal sacriÞce or be offered independently. A con-siderable amount of each offering was not burnt on the altar but ratherassigned to the priests as their prerogative (Lev.2:3,10;6:7Ð11,7:9Ð10,cf.12Ð16; Mishnah, (Qodashim)Mena.hot6.1Ð2).21The treatment of thebread of Presence (\u0010\u0017#\f\u0003,(\u0002\u0010\b\u0011(le.hem hapanim) also known as shewbread)is particularly signiÞcant:22a batch of twelve loaves was placed on thegodÕs table in the temple (Ex.25:30) every Sabbath; the loaves were16Dolpai: small ßat cakes; Coan.17Cf.

I have seen the stone. The arrangement of the lines of theprinted text corresponds roughly with their arrangement on the stone. The letters arenicely cut but the stone is somewhat carelessly inscribed. It is clear that the letter-cutterwanted to separate the hexameter from the pentameter in the epigram and the epigramfrom the law that follows. In the Þrst line he seems, however, to have miscalculated1But seeBCH82,1958,798Ð799with plates."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"338document 24the relationship between the space and the size of the letters which decreases towardthe end with the last sigma practically touching the right edge of the inscribed face.Lines3Ð5show a tendency toward slanting upward.

Meat shall not be carried away.The skin goes to the god.CommentaryThis document comes from the sanctuary of Asclepius at Lissos, exca-vated in the late1950s by N. Platon but otherwise unknown, as it is notmentioned in literary sources.2The sanctuary, which is rather small, islocated near the chapel of Hagios Kirkos, about an hour and a halfwalk from Souya in south-western Crete. It includes a small Doric tem-ple constructed mostly of ashlar masonry, with polygonal masonry usedin the lower east wall built against the slope of a mountain. The tem-ple, which is entered from the south, has a mosaic ßoor. A base, perhapslarge enough for two statues, is located at the north end. To its left thereis a basin with a drain.3A source of water with therapeutic qualities isknown to exist in the area; some such source may have been the reasonfor the foundation of the sanctuary on this spot.4Under (i.e. to the westof) the temple there are remains of a fountain house built of massivepolygonal masonry. The water appears to have ßowed into it passingbeneath the ßoor of the temple.2See N.

A few are said tohave inscribed bases.5Other inscriptions were also discovered; a feware still on the site.6The excavation also revealed a broken, reddish,inscribed table of Asclepius which is currently on display at the museumin Chania.On the cult of Asclepius cf. no.13above; Part I pp.60Ð65.

The date appears correct enough, but exact dating may dependupon the date of the statue and may have to wait until it and the rest ofthe material from the sanctuary is published.Line1Τ#νδJin the Þrst line of the epigram most likely refers to Asclepius; it isnot entirely clear what is referred to byτ#νδJin the second line. Sincean altar does not appear to have been included in the dedication, itseems inevitable that the law assumes the existence of an altar in thesanctuary.9It is thus noteworthy that Tharsytas was in a position topublish a law which regulates the use of this altar. Accordingly, PeekÕsunargued assumption (1977,80) that both the father who had installedthe statue and son who made the dedication were priests of Asclepiusseems reasonable.105PlatonÕs1958report (p.466) gives detailed information about the statues.6See especially PlatonÕs1959report p.377.7Cf.

The bronze tablets of Entella have been variously dated to themid-late fourth-early third century B.C. or to the mid-third century,before and after the Roman penetration into Sicily respectively, on thebasis of references to external events.9The town of Nakone, mentionedin Stephanus of Byzantium (468.3= PhilistusFGrHist556F26) and theSuda (s.v.Νακ\tνη) is otherwise known from its coins of the late Þfth andÞrst half of the fourth century B.C. It was situated in western Sicily butits exact location is unknown.10With no substantial reference to datablehistorical events, the date of the present document, the only one tocome from Nakone, remains very much uncertain, depending upon thedate of the entire Entella dossier and possibly upon letter forms.11Though from a cultic point of view the signiÞcant part of the doc-ument is conÞned to a few lines (27Ð33, it is important for the studyof Greek cult practice because it governs the institution of a festival,regardless of its civic impetus. The closest parallel in the corpus ofsacred laws isLSAM81which establishes, in much greater detail, ayearly festival for Athena and Homonoia to commemorate the recon-ciliation between Antiochia ad Pyramum (Magarsus) and Antiochia adCydnum (Tarsus).12The present festival was clearly instituted to com-memorate the reconciliation discussed in the Þrst part of the document.Unfortunately, the document is very sparing in respect to details, offer-ing little more than an outline of the celebration. Obscurities abound,accordingly, not the least because the meaning of the hapax4δελ(%1ε-τ8αand therefore the construction withκατ\u0010are unclear.9Primarily, though not solely, a war with the Carthaginians, as has been noted,referred to inSEGXXX1117and1118(= Ampolo (ed.)2001Entella C2and C3).The lack of explicit reference to Rome, particularly in the context of a war withthe Carthaginians, might suggest an earlier date, though the appearance of a Romanepimeletes, Tiberius Claudius son of Gaius inSEGXXX1120.4(= Ampolo2001EntellaB1), is signiÞcant and could point to the Þrst Punic war (264Ð241) and its ultimate phase(254Ð241) as a date for the decrees.

The cult of Homonoia, the personiÞca-tion of Concord, gathers momentum in the Hellenistic period (havingemerged in the fourth century B.C.), a phenomenon which is com-monly, and perhaps all too easily, considered an outcome of the politi-cal upheavals of the Hellenistic world.33She may Þrst appear in a givenlocation in an identiÞable context involving strife and reconciliation or,as in the calendars from Isthmus,LSCG169A4, and Erythrae34LSAM26.101,SEGXXX1327.7, as a member of a local pantheon. Even theÞrst category should not necessarily imply a new cult. The ignorance28On the color of victims see commentary on1.34above.29One notes that for all intents and purposes the goat is more readily availablein pure white than other sacriÞcial animals (which is not to deny the existence ofrequirements to sacriÞce white sheep and cows).

Since the festival is clearlymeant to commemorate the reconciliation, it makes sense to take theadelphothetiaias referring to the groups of Þve, with the celebration pre-scribed here carried out by each group and its descendants. There isno assurance that this is correct, however. As the document is unfor-tunately silent regarding the practical implications of the reconciliationmechanism, it is impossible to give a deÞnite answer to such questionsas whether the newly constituted groups were merely artiÞcial or viableentities and, if so, how they functioned, particularly in respect to realfamilies.64We have, of course, no way to verify the persistence of theinstitution or of the festival with its yearly sacriÞce to the ancestors andHomonoia.65As the case of the Magnesian Eisiteria seems to suggest,66new festivals in particular ran the risk of losing popularity within afairly short time.60Asheri noted (1982,1041Ð1045;1989,141Ð145) that theadoptio in fratremas a legalinstitution, otherwise unknown in the Greek world and considered invalid (irritum)inCod.

I have not seen the tablet; the epigraphical notes are basedon the Þrst edition. The inscription employs the Selinuntine alphabet, withqusedonly in column A. Horizontal guidelines, inscribed before the text, appear in bothcolumns. They cover the entire length of column B but only the Þrst eighteen linesof column A, affecting the horizontal orientation of the remaining six lines of text.A few graffiti appear written across the guidelines in the uninscribed area of columnB. In both columns no straight right margin has been observed, and the inscribed linesvary in length. Two vertical lines appear in the middle of the tablet marking the leftmargins of both columns. The observance of these margins in an attempt to use theentire available surface of the tablet might explain why the two columns are writtenupside down with respect to one another (Jameson, Jordan, and Kotanski1993,3Ð"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"362document 274).14Jameson, Jordan, and Kotanski (1993,4Ð5) identiÞed provisionally three differenthands: I:A1Ð3, II:A4Ð24(in lines4Ð6the rasura prevents deÞnite identiÞcation), andIII: column B.

It is, however,not safe to put too great an emphasis on the details. The law is mani-festly interested in establishing a sequence of actions which, performedin order, constitute a ritual. It is, however, not much more interested insingular actions than comparable Greek sacred laws; like them it takesfor granted a basic familiarity with ordinary cult practice. Details aregiven only when deviation from common practice is required or whenthe proceedings are particularly complex. One is tempted to ascribe theamount of detail to unfamiliarity with rites which have been newly for-mulated. But the rituals may not be new; this could rather be the Þrsttime the information pertaining to their performance is made acces-sible. The detailed format may be due to the inherently idiosyncratic,complex nature of the rituals, or, particularly inB, to their extraordi-nariness and to the seriousness of the subject matter.16This document has been much discussed since its publication and it is impossi-ble to review in detail all of the discussions here. In what follows we therefore conÞneourselves to general considerations and to a condensed running commentary, attempt-ing to highlight what seem to be substantial contributions to interpretation, referring,where the same or similar points were made by different scholars, mainly to whoeverÞrst made these points.

Nor does the factthatBdeals with the puriÞcation of an individual imply thatAis con-cerned with the cult of groups.21We should note that it may be rare, but entirely possible, for docu-ments that are not immediately related to each other to be inscribedand published together for a variety of reasons.22As in the case of thetwo Archaic fragments from Ephesus,LSAM30,23it is safer to treateach column as the sum of its parts. As such, the two columns do notseem to have much in common with one another.Column AThe comprehensible part of column AÑthe precise relationship of lines1Ð3to the main part cannot be determinedÑopens with a heading(lines7Ð8) followed by four sets of prescriptions (lines8Ð9,9Ð13,13Ð17,17Ð22where the text becomes too fragmentary). Excluding thethird set, connected to the second with aκα8, each set begins with anasyndeton, naming the divinities (in the dative) to whom the sacriÞcesare to be performed.24Each of the two sets concerned with sacriÞcesto the polluted and pure Tritopatores is summed up by an independentstatement. The protagonists in the actions are only identiÞed twice inthe entire column (lines3and12). The number of the verbs vacillates,however, between third singular and third plural. The signiÞcance ofthis is not clear.20Clinton1996a,160Ð162.21Clinton1996a,162Ð163.

Some of these proclaim themselves by means of inscriptions tobe the Meilichios of so-and-so, to belong to Meilichios, or to be givento Meilichios by so-and-so; others appear to bear personal names.25Jameson, Jordan, and Kotanski conjectured that beyond being mereembodiments of the god, these stones marked places where groupswould engage in the performance of cult.26The designations*ν Μ?σq%(line9) and*ν Ε71υδ\u0010μ%(line17) are to be understood as referring tosome such plots. Myskos and Euthydamos would be names of the fore-fathers of important gentilitial groups; their Meilichios cults would haveacquired signiÞcance for the entire community or for the groups forwhose sake the present rituals were composed.27The name Myskos isin fact attested on a late seventh-century gravestone from Selinus (IGDS71); this person who might have belonged to the Þrst settlers of Selinuscould be identiÞed as the Myskos of*ν Μ?σq%or as a descendant ofhis.28Clinton suggested, however, that, while Myskos and Euthydamosmight have been founders promoted to the status of local heroes,*νΜ?σq%and*ν Ε71υδ\u0010μ%would designate not plots but sanctuaries29comparable to a sanctuary of an eponymous local hero, Pamphylos,at Megara, the grandmother city of Selinus, which had an incorpo-rated or attached sanctuary of Zeus Meilichios. The rituals prescribedhere would accordingly take place not in the sanctuary of Zeus Meili-chios on the Gaggera but in a few sanctuaries, the sanctuary of ZeusEumenes and the Eumenides, the precinct of Zeus Meilichios in thesanctuary of Myskos, the sanctuaryÑperhaps doubleÑof the Tritopa-tores, and the precinct of Zeus Meilichios in the sanctuary of Euthy-damos.3025See Jameson, Jordan, and KotanskiÕs catalogue,1993,89Ð90.26Jameson, Jordan, and Kotanski1993,201Ð202.27Ibid.29,53.28Ibid.28Ð29.29Cf.

It lists animals and types of offerings, and discusses priestly pre-rogatives and the distribution of parts between priests and worshippers.There is no mention of divine portions. The officiating priests receiveprerogatives in cash and kind. Cash prerogatives seem to be paid tothem directly. Among the Greek sacriÞcial tariffs,6a similar situationmight be detected inLSCG45.2Ð7andIscr.CosED216B2Ð8, but wor-shippers are commonly instructed to put the money in athesauros. Theanimals appear to be listed in a hierarchical order according to size andage.7The list of animals (lines3Ð12) opens with full-grown bovines andends with birds. We note a similarity in Parker and Obbink2000, lines10Ð12and in no.9above. Most Greek sacriÞcial tariffs are arrangedhierarchically; the order might, however, be descending (as here) orascending (notablyIscr.CosED216B2Ð8).

Line15makes a special consideration of thepoor: the priests receive no prerogative from their sacriÞce. Offeringsby groups are discussed in lines16Ð17.

The tariffends with punishmentclauses for greedy priests (line20) and reluctant worshippers (line21);these appear also in Greek sacred laws.8Date.

As time has gone by, I have found a fewmore mistakes to correct, though I have not looked for them system-atically, and naturally have rethought (and will likely keep rethinking)some of my positions. I Þnd it appropriate to make these correctionsand second thoughts available here. It must be stressed that they byno means represent an attempt, let alone systematic, to supplement orupdate NGSL (which is impossible at this time).1P. X I n .2: RegardingSEGXXXII86: Even with some uncertaintiescleared up by autopsies (I personally carried out one in1999), it remainsquestionable whether, even accepting it as a set of festival regulations,this text should be included in the corpus of Greek sacred laws. Inote that comparable regulations (e.g.SEGXVI55or perhapsIGI33) have previously been excluded. The reasons were, possibly, the lackor paucity of information they add to our knowledge of cult practice(which may well be due to the fragmentary state of the documents),1Where possible, emendations have been made in the text of the work itself. Thepresent postscript omits occasional typographical errors, and I allow myself only onemore footnote in addition to the present one. For comments and discussions I amgrateful to Jan Mathieu Carbon, Kevin Clinton, Nora Dimitrova, Philip Forsythe,Catherine Keesling, and Adele Scafuro. I am likewise indebted to Jan Mathieu Carbonand Corpus Christi College Oxford for inviting me to deliver a talk entitled ÒWhat isGreek About Greek Sacred Law?Ó given in March2005; I am grateful to those whoattended my talk for their comments, particularly to Beate Dignas, Sally Humphreys,Riet van Bremen, and Scott Scullion. Responsibility for errors that remain in thebookÑand errors, experience teaches, remainÑrests, of course, with me. As for onepossible error: J.M. Carbon tells me thatSEGXLVI1157, which forbids defecation bywomen, should be considered a sacred law. But the place where defecation is forbiddenis not mentioned and, for my part, I would expect more compelling evidence that theÞndspot was a sanctuary or a sacred place of some sort before classifying this inscriptionas a sacred law. (Cf. in this respect quite probablyCIRB939, which evidently forbidsdefecating in a sanctuary and is therefore a likely candidate for inclusion in the corpus,despite being omitted by Sokolowski. Cf. alsoSBI4531Ð4532, which have so far beenexcluded from the corpus, perhaps because they seem to be borderline cases betweencurses and regulations.)"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"502postscriptor because the events regulated were not considered to be primarilyof religious meaning (always a tricky matter in my mind). Whetherexclusion is justiÞed in such cases is a considerably complex question,which the editors of a new corpus will have to address, as they siftthrough the evidence.Part I, first section: The Corpus of Greek Sacred LawsI realize that my attempt to explain which documents have ordinarilybeen included in the corpus of Greek sacred laws, and that are there-fore termed Òsacred laws,Ó could be stated more concisely (I attemptedto explain after-the-fact principles employed by others who had ac-counted for their own methods laconically, if at all). Put more loosely(and at the risk of oversimpliÞcation), the main points are as follows:21. Although ancient precedents should not be underestimated, thecorpus as we have it is by and large a modern construct.2. The documents included in the corpus can be said very generallyto fall into two main groups (cf. Parker (above n.2); in a sense, thisdivision is already noticeable in ProttÕs brief introduction toLGSI):i. Actual legislative acts, above all by states, formally speaking,mostly in the form of decrees. These legislative acts may deal withwhatever realm of religious activity the legislators wished to regu-late: the management of sanctuaries, the function of cult officials,and issues relating to festivals, appearing to be most prevalent.ii. Documents that are perhaps the Þrst to be associated with theterm Òsacred law,Ó putting forth rules governing cult activity andreligious customs (regarding, e.g. sacriÞcial performance or main-taining the ritual integrity of sacred spaces). Formally, using theterm ÒlawÓ for such documents is a bit of a stretch: from whateversource they may emanate, they do not necessarily represent actuallegislation;ν#μ%ςis not entirely inappropriate in this respect (sug-gesting by no means that all documents of this sort were referredto as such in antiquity). Although this trait may make them appear2The deÞnition of Greek sacred law was discussed at about the same time as thepublication of my book or shortly thereafter in two important articles by Robert Parker(ÒWhat are sacred laws?,Ó in E.M. Harris and L. Rubinstein (eds.),The Law and theCourts in Ancient Greece, London2004, pp.57Ð70; ÒLaw and Religion,Ó in M. Gagarinand D. Cohen, (eds.),The Cambridge Companion to Ancient Greek Law, Cambridge2005,pp.61Ð81). I have attempted to take ParkerÕs discussions into account here. I seem toshare basic agreement with him, differing in some speciÞc points."},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"some corrections and second thoughts503to be deÞcient in authority, I doubt that they were necessarilyviewed as mere suggestions: at least where transgression was pos-sible, its potential results, if nothing else, could be an incentive forwould-be transgressors to contemplate the consequences of theiractions.These groupings should, however, be treated with caution for severalreasons. It is possible to note a few examples where the two groupsmay intermix (cf. Parker (above n.2)): documents seemingly falling intothe second group could be determined to be official even when min-imal or no official formulation is evident, while actual legislative actsmay regulate the performance of cult or prescribe religious customs;occasionally both ÒofficialÓ and Ònon-officialÓ documents may employimprecations as a means (or additional means) of enforcement; docu-ments under discussion may emanate from sources other than states,and when these are private individuals or organizations, their authorityis naturally limited; some documents may involve official endorsementof private initiatives; a single document might deal with more than onemain subject. The result may seem to border upon a formal mayhem.But documents which have found their way into the modern corpus,and are thus referred to for better or worse as Òsacred lawsÓ (and callingthemleges sacraeneither changes nor improves the situation) do share incommon at the very least two basic traits: (1) their subject matter and(2) the way in which it is handled: they are by and large prescriptive,whether they represent formal legislation or not.Further qualiÞcation is needed, and as I have pointed out (p.9,2nd paragraph, lines12–13) much in the evidence deÞes clear-cutclassiÞcation. This is of course not an inherent characteristic of all thedocuments assembled in the corpus of Greek sacred laws. I think itshould be sufficiently clear from my review of the contents of the corpusthat classes of documents emerge (and these may even have sometimesbeen in the minds of the promulgators). And yet, though it wouldnaturally follow the internal rules of given forms (such as decrees), thecontext under which a document is promulgated, the authority it reliesupon, its purpose or function largely determine the range of issues itattempts to address and determine its character, not just a need toconform to a speciÞc class of sacred laws, let alone to a theoreticalmodel. I therefore personally do not see any reason to brush aside thistrait. Admittedly, the issue deserves further discussion. Part I, however,did not mean to set in stone classes of documents (and I am not sure"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"504postscriptthat complete agreement regarding such classes is realistic) but aimed ata general review of the evidence, aiming at making the contents of thecorpus of Greek sacred laws more accessible to the general classicist.Pp.5–6: Regarding language, it goes without saying that besides thesegeneral observations, the documents may express rules and particularlyprohibitions in a variety of ways.P.7,7thline from bottom: (regardingIscr.CosED5ÑSEGXXXIII675): inter alios: it seems that more gods have been mentioned in thelacuna in line14(including the one(s) restored at the end and thebeginning of line15).P.9: last paragraph: Though this should be clear enough from theopening sentence and even more so from the introductions to thevarious subsections, perhaps a general statement is due here that mostdocuments discussed in this section dealmutatis mutandisand in the mostgeneral sense with aspects ofmanagementoradministrationof sanctuariesand sacred spaces, perhaps above all, but not only, with maintainingand protecting their ritual integrity (or purity) and physical integrity.Comprehensive vs. speciÞc documents: It is worth emphasizing thatthe terms ÔcomprehensiveÕ and ÔspeciÞc,Õ as used in my general reviewof the contents of the corpus, do not relate to any innate differencesbetween the documents under discussion save their scope. It goes with-out saying that the circumstances under which documents of eachgroup are issued can be similar.Pp.9–10: The fact thatLSCG69does not quite refer to itself by aspeciÞc term should not preclude referring to it as a law.P.11,2nd paragraph: Ensuring the rights of the priestess is probablynot the sole motivation behind prohibiting activities in her absence inLSCG36.P.12, lines3–4: Strictly speaking, only not sacriÞcing in the presenceof the founder will result in the sacriÞce not being accepted, not viola-tions of all the rules inLSCG55.Pp.14–15:LSCG136: in reference to the following law the decreementions ÔlawsÕ regarding the subject matter.

I would prefer to keep thisstate of things as it stands and include oracles as long as they aredirectly prescriptive. Prescriptive documents that base their prescrip-tions upon oracular pronouncements or those that cite oracular pre-scriptions directly should not, of course, be excluded. I would likewiseprefer not to see in the corpus narratives relating to the performanceof cult such as ones which may appear in certain honoriÞc decrees.This is by no means to underestimate the value of such pieces of evi-dence astestimoniesfor the study of cult activity; buttestimoniesis exactlywhat they are and in my mind the corpus should not include testi-monies. One might argue that all oracles are by nature prescriptiveand that the question whether, when published, the prescriptions areexpressed directly or indirectly is immaterial.

Considering this,these two sentences (and the remark on state foundations in the pre-vious paragraph) should be virtually ignored. It would probably havebeen better to treat here only the Xanthus documentÑperhaps notquite a full-ßedged ÔfoundationÕ but a likely precursor, and change thetitle of the subsection (ÒA Public PrecursorÓ or the like?). Perhaps thedocument could have also been discussed with other early founda-tions. One might alternatively argue that it could have been handledwith foundations of sanctuaries. As forLSS6, it would have been bet-ter discussed elsewhere, probably, at least in its fragmentary state, inthe section on ÒreÞnancingÓ of festivals (pp.108Ð109). I note that myno.2could possibly have been mentioned therein. I should add thatI decided to include this inseparable pair of two decrees in NGSLbecause funding the cult, and speciÞcally the festival of Heracles, isultimately the goal of the second decree; it is not merely about leasing.P.84,2nd paragraph: The course of the procession of the Alke-sippeia is not fully dictated (this is more the case with the Attaleia),and something could have been said about the relations between theEumeneia and the Attaleia (cf. below note onp.103, n.540).P.86:6thline from bottom:Òas long as they perform:Ó literally:Òperforming.ÓP.87, line6: RegardingIGXII3,330, I should have made clearthat capital letters (AÐC) are commonly used to denote the differenttexts (A: name labels of the statues, B: testament (= Þrst document,lines1Ð108, columns IÐIII), C: statues (= second document, lines109Ð288, columns IVÐVIII)). ThusLSCG135reproduces lines1Ð94oftextC.(The reference to slabs in the1st edition is irrelevant.)P.90: Festivals and ceremonies: It is worth emphasizing that the sectionon festivals and ceremonies is, by deÞnition, an extension of the sectionon cult performance.Pp.94–95: The question of the re(?)-organization of the Ptoia and thedocuments involved is considerably more complex than it appears fromthe discussion here (and in the commentary on no.11).

In general I note that theclassiÞcation of festivals as Ònew,Ó Òresuscitated,Ó ÒrevitalizedÓ and soon may be tentative, depending on the internal evidence of the doc-uments themselves, whether unambiguous or interpreted (cf. Nilsson1906:251). In principle, a similar problem could arise where the ques-tion whether a given festival is new or simply placed on new Þnancialfooting depends mostly or solely on internal evidence. As for resusci-tation, in some cases revitalization is the real issue, and the section onresuscitated festivals should have been entitled Òresuscitated and revi-talized festivals.ÓPp.108–109: ÒReÞnancing:Ó cf. above notes on pp.82Ð83and107Ð108.

Paul Getty Museum, particularlyto Janet Grossman, for allowing access to the stone during the veryshort period in which it was accessible, I must note that given the lim-itation of time and the conditions of my inspection (including inabilityto use water and charcoal), which was pursued all too close to the sub-mission of my manuscript, the inspection could consist in little morethan checking DauxÕs readings. I should add that, although I expectno dramatic changes to the main text, further study of the stone islikely to result in further modiÞcations of DauxÕs ideas. Note in thisrespect that the placement of the additions in NGSL in relation to thelines of the main text is approximate. I have, again, followed Daux innumbering them. I should also like to caution that the hypothesis thatthe additions on the left side belong to a text once inscribed on theback of the stone remains a hypothesis: in a conversation, M.H. Jame-son, though not altogether dismissing the idea, was not quite con-vinced.Lines14–16: Even if the second piglet is sacriÞced in another place,its recipient is probably still Zeus Polieus (otherwise the offering has norecipient).
