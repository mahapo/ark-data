The printed edition was based on two manuscripts currently preserved in two different Swedish archives, the Library ofLund Uni­versity and Kulturen in Lund. The translation of the manuscript from Swedish into English has been a work characterized by interpretation, comparing and seeking the original meaning of words, by the use of older word books and documents. In many cases, some excerpts of the text were first translated to a more modem form of Swedish, mainly in order to find a more agreeable language, but also to encode slang words and misspellings. I have tried to keep the same traditional use of words connected to the context of the author, without compromising too much of the content. In the majority of 7"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"8 Salamonie Magical Arts cases, I have emphasized content before form. The main purpose of the translation has been to transmit the spells, recipes and core content of the procedures rather than fo­cus on a stringent grammatical translation. A too technical form would in some cases negatively impact the translation; the greatest loss in this approach would be the differences in rhythm and rhymes, in the readings and incantations. Seen in a national or even, Scandinavian historical per­spective, the variations of spellings and meanings are vast. The complexity becomes greater when we consider the influx of Latin, German and Italian language.

Beelzebub for example, keeps his Swedish spelling Bj iilsebub. In some cases the spelling has been inconsistent within the same spell or recipe, which may tell us that the author was not so familiar with all of the words therein. It is also plausible that the writer had someone to read the text aloud while it was being transcribed. When encountering words in the manuscript that vaguely or partly resemble a contemporary word in mean­ing, I have taken two things into consideration. Firstly, it is possible the word refers to something from the cultural tradition of another source, from which the manuscript was transcribed. Secondly, it could simply be directly con­nected to the Swedish, or Scandinavian, tradition in a cor­rupted form. Both cases have occurred during translation, and from this it is evident that the transcript of the manu­script into the printed edition contains several misinter­pretations made by Heurgren. All readings, incantations and magical words were writ­ten in italic to highlight them and separate them from the rest of the text, something not originally done in the print­ed edition or original manuscript. I have also been quite generous with word wrappings in order for a better over­view of the description of the methods, incantations and seals. A few spells which have been too diffi cult to interpret has been taken away from this translation. Just as the origi­nal author, I have also made an index at the end of the book. However, my index and system of reference has nothing to do with that of the original author. I have kept the section-signs as used in the Black Book, and added numbers to the spells in the Red Book.

Many words are spelled as they sound in Swedish, for ex­ample in the case of the word ekorre (en: squirrel), which is spelled 'ikorne' in the manuscript. One reason for the in­consistency could be the many local variations in dialect, or varying degrees of literacy. This publication is not an attempt to present a uniform tradition, but rather to give insight into a specific case. The translation of the manuscript is presented as a magical folk­lore curiosity; a window through which we can gaze into some parts of our magical past, and access the knowledge of our atavistic heritage, whether inherited, copied, written or oral.

As the title of the published book suggests, the printed version was based on the handwritten manuscript of a man named Gabriel Djurklou. In the summer of 1870 Djurklou commenced on a journey in Smaland of southern Sweden, working as superintendent for the national antiquarian office ( sw: Riksantikvarieiimbetet ), with the purpose of car­rying out an itemized list of the local neighbourhood. It was on this journey where he eventually met Sven Magnus Lud­vig Fritiof Palmgren (1844-1915), a young priest who later became pastor in the Vastbo district. They became close and shared a correspondence for a long time, and to this day many of these letters are archived at the Museum of Jonkoping County. Among other archaeological and folk­lore related data, Palmgren also kept his eye open for Books of the Black Art on behalf ofDjurklou, which were of great interest to him in his profession. Four years after their first meeting, Palmgren tells Djurklou in a letter that he has found two Books of the Black Art, to Djurklou' s delight, whereupon they were loaned to him. This was at the time when Palmgren was stationed in the village ofHjalmseryd 5• 4 Salomonic Magical Arts, Excerpts from a Book of the Black Arts of a Westbo Priest.

They seem to be written in the beginning of the 18th cen­tury by a learned man according to information from different people. They both contain a couple of hundred pages. 6 13 This was probably when he transcribed the manuscript which was later used for the printed and published book, popularized by Heurgren. One reason they were not pub­lished directly by Djurklou himself was his reverence for the content, and the conception that the material was too sinister for the common people. Nevertheless, we can find indications on that he was planning to. Palmgren indicat­ed in a letter to Djurklou that the book was once used by the district taxation registrar and great wizard, Sven Peter Gaslander (1754-1833). Gaslander was reputed to be edu­cated in the magical arts, and according to professor Nils­Arvid Bringeus, the manuscript for Salomonic Magical Arts was probably found in a manor in Sandvik by Palmgren, where the chronicles of the Gaslander lineage also were kept. It was later discovered that the major parts of the manuscript originally was written by Johannes Gaslander ( 1718-1793), pastor and parson in the parish of Sandvik, and father of Peter Gaslander. 7 The first part of the manuscript, referred to as the Red Book, was donated to the archive of Kulturen in 1953 by Sten Palmgren, son of Ludvig Palmgren, who in a letter claims that the manuscript was owned from the beginning by Petrus Gaslander (1680-1758) , vicar and grandfather of Peter.

The Black Book was fronted by the original title \"Diverse saker\" (en: 'various things') together with the four sigils as found on the cover of the printed edition. It was also in associa­tion with this text that a rune calendar made by Sven Dige­lius in 1755 was found. Djurklou for some reason did not copy all of the text in the manuscripts sent to him. He missed some paragraphs, such as §J59, which was one of the last passages in the original. It was divided into 23 shorter sections dealing with the right time for blood-letting, the circumstances around it and divinations on the current health of the patient. That paragraph, including its sub­paragraphs, is not a part of this translation. The original manuscript of the Black Book was written on paper with leather binding. Most of the text was written in black ink, while the sigils were written in red ink. The first pages contained important days of the months, fol­lowed by an index.

Rune calendars were Nordic variations of church calendars, having their roots in the Middle Ages, where runes were used instead of Latin letters or numbers. They were origi­nally carved on wood and bound together as wooden books and were later popularized in print during the qth and 18th century, when Gothicism began to take form in Swe­den. Gothicism was an ideology or cultural movement based largely on works of people like Johannes Bureus8 and Ole Worm, and of which OlofRudbeck senior was a leading spokesman. The idea or movement was based on a cultural nationalism where the Norse heritage was used for defining the ideals of the nation, of which the vikings and the runes played an important role. These ideas flourished in the backwaters of the Reinassance, to which parts of the trans­lation can be traced. The rune calendar found in The Black Book was a product of such revivals of old knowledge and customs. Pocket calendars were especially used in the Nor­dic folk magical tradition to ward off the Incubus Mare, both for men and creatures alike. The whole calendar, or pages from it, was hung above those plagued by the Mare, and either nailed to the wall/roof or attached with a knife. Some claimed that the calendar should be of considerable age, while others made it with any kind of material, as long as the four corners of it were cut off. Some claimed that 8 An interesting side note is that Bureus combined his esoteric knowledge in cabala with Nordic rune mysticism, in which he developed the Adulruna sys­tem, revealed to him in a vision.

At this time Freemasonry was brought to Sweden from France by Count Axel Wrede-Sparre, who came to initiate people of higher nobility in Sweden, among them his brother in law in 1735. At this time more Freemasons came to be initiated both in, and outside of Sweden. Dur­ing the 175o's the Lodges of Sweden opened their doors to classes of society other than the higher nobility, and in 176o the Grand Lodge of Sweden was established10• This royal heritage endures today, with the Swedish King Carl xvi Gustaf (1946) as the High Protector of the Swedish Order of Freemasons. The rune calendar is a rather complex story. It was di­vided into twelve sections, one for each month. The first horizontal row depicts, in symbols, the different holidays and other important days of the year connected to both the church and the annual duties of rural life, such as sowing and harvesting. We can also follow the cycles of the moon continuously through the calendar, as seen in the middle of each month. The Norse expression 'dricka Jul' (en: drink­ing Christmas) is for example depicted in the end of De­cember with drinking horns, accompanied by an image of a wrapped up infant Jesus. In the second row we follow the days of the year symbol­ized by the first seven runes of the younger Futhark: fe, ur, purs, ass, reio, kaun, hagal (�nl>:t:RI'*). The seven days were repeated across the calendar (7 x 52 =J64), with fe added 9 Forsblom 1927:640-641. 10 frimurarorden.se"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"18 Salomonic Magical Arts as the last rune in order to cover all 365 days of the year, which is why the year always started and ended with the same rune. The third row contains the 19 golden numbers expressed in runes for the Metonic Cycle; a 19-year cycle used for finding a common multiple for the lunar month and solar year. In this cycle, it took 19 years for the lunar month to repeat on the exact same dates. It was first discovered by the Greek astronomer Meton of Athens in the 5th century BC. Each rune symbolized one golden number (one year of the cycle), but as the Futhark only contained 16 runes three completely new bind-runes had to be invented: arlaug for number 17, tvimadr for number 18, and belgtburs for number 19. As their names imply arlaugis a bind-rune consisting of the a-(+) and 1-(t) runes; tvimadr of a double m-rune ('f); and belgtburs of a double th-rune (1>)11• The middle pillar was also connected to the 19-year Metonic Cycle and was used for calculating important holidays, such as Easter. t!' n I>� RP*+ I+ Lit B 'I' t ! 1% <I> The younger Futhark (fupqrkhniaitbmlr ), together with the three bindrunes arlaug, tvimadr and belgthurs.

CHARACTERISTICS OF A BOOK OF BLACK ARTS �, Ranslating the Swedish term 'svartkonst' (en: Black Art) directly into English could be problematic, as problematic as the use of the Swedish word by itsel£ The main issue comes with the connection to black magic. Many of the spells and remedies found in Salomonic Magical Arts"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"20 Salomonic Magical Arts can be traced directly to the genre of'household books' and have very few references to the dark arts and sinister endea­vours. With this in mind I have chosen to use the term Book of Black Arts anyway, in order to preserve the historical trac­es which abide in its meaning. The term is also good for dis­tinguishing the content from regular household books at the time. Nordisk Familjebok (en: Nordic Family Book), a Swedish lexicon first published 1876-1899, explains the word 'svart­konst' in the following manner: Written or printed teachings in the practice of magic or the Black Art (svartkonst ). With our people the \"Book of Black Art': as with all magical books mentioned by the country folks, undoubtedly played a larger role in legend than in actual practice. You believed that it was obtained through a deal with the Devil and that the owner, if he still had the book at the time of his death, became unhelpfully condemned. 12 The word 'black' as in 'Book of the Black Arts' in the rather narrow description above is not necessary equivalent to 'evil' or 'sinister', rather 'what dwells in darkness', 'beyond average knowledge', or 'bidden knowledge: This is why, per­haps, the term occult is more suited as an explanation of its content. At the time when these books appeared they were of course considered evil, sinister and blasphemous by many common people. The concept of hidden knowledge is known worldwide and deeply rooted in the Nordic pa­gan tradition. This is why the term Black Art can be used, at least in this instance where we also find a close relationship 12 Meijeri918:860."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 21 with the grimoire tradition. This is also an attempt to give the word 'black' a broader meaning in relation to Black Art and Black Magic. A Book of Black Arts (sw: svartkonstbok) does not con­tain a unified content of practice, and we find that they simply can be described as the magical notes of a single per­son. As the title of one such printed book states: \"This book belongs to me Petter Johan Johannesson, in which I write of many things''.13 The contents are in many cases magical, but the reason for such books' notoriety is the fe ar invoked in Christians of the time. It is true that the content in many cases was regarded as blasphemous, but many practitioners who used them also claimed to be good Christians. Here we find a divided approach: the magical handbooks were often presented with great authority and were also considered books ofboth magical and mundane knowledge. Books of Black Arts gathered by folklorists often have the name ofits original owner in it, for example: \"The Book of Troll-Marsken'; the book of Petter Johan Johannesson as mentioned above, or the work at hand, Salomonic Magical Arts, which denotes that it often was a gathering of spells and remedies completed by one person, or attributed to someone from myth or magical lore14• In it we find prayers to Jesus mixed with recipes for a sore throat, alongside con­jurations ofinfernal spirits. The practitioner turned both to angelic and infernal powers in order to obtain what he or she deemed necessary, something referred to by contempo­rary authors on the subject of witchcraft as 'the crooked path: The same idea is present in Haitian Vodou where the bokor is said to be a man who 'serves with both hands'. Saying that the methods of common peoples' magic are i3 Johannesson 1917. 14 Other famous examples are the Nordic Cyprianus books."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"22 Salomonic Magical Arts found in the archives while those of the scholarly people are found in printed books would be a superficial under­standing of the matter. This can be an initial point ofbegin­ning in many cases, but the worlds of the common and the scholarly people were often interwoven, cross-influencing each other, as in the case of Salamonie Magical Arts, where a priest is one of the original authors. We also see the trans­mission following an opposite trajectory, as the very same priest also wrote a book on the country people and their customs, from information he gathered in villages. What is interesting to note is that many of the spells which are believed to have been derived from the oral tradition were in fact passed down from a written tradition, in the guise of a local variation. It is also problematic to make a clean­cut distinction between 'high' and 'low' magic (terrestrial/ a:therial, material/spiritual) since they both were part of a worldview not so easily defined with expressions denoting a dualistic world view. Professor Emeritus in ethnology and Swedish researcher of Nordic Books of Black Art Sven B. Ek emphasizes the fact that rural Sweden contained the same psychological types of individuals as it does today. Obviously they also had so­cial, economic, geographical and traditional divergences in the 18th-19th century, which tells us that variations in local cultural expressions were more diverse than suggested by attempts to depict a unified rural folk magical tradition. It is thus preferable to speak of many traditions instead of a unified intention of the people15• When studying this ma­terial, researchers must therefore take care to not deprive the individuals of their own thoughts, spiritual endeavours and opinions. 15 Ek1964"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"11tnna �£)jt �rbor mig 1}tttrr So�ttn,J'o�nnne�on 'This book belongs to me Petter Johan Johannesson, in which I write of many things':"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"24 Salomonic Magical Arts Though it is not a part of the tradition of the book, it is interesting to note the symbology behind the colours used to describe the manuscripts known as Salomonic Magical Arts; red and black, a common colour combination related to infernal powers or sinister energies. In the oral tradition, a Book of the Black Arts was often described as black with red letters, and in order to obtain it one had to swear alle­giance to the Devil himself16• The patient and the healer act a pre-determined dialogue in the following example, where the healer is about to take away the disease by the method of chopping: -What are you chopping? -The black sparks, and the red. I chop the glaucoma away from your ey e 17• We can assume that the red and black sparks were in this example considered the malign source of the disease, and had to be chopped away. Many of the spells and remedies from the Nordic folk magical tradition, and also some found in Salamonie Magi­cal Arts and other Books of the Black Arts are very brutal. They contain severe abuse of animals and people, and some recipes contain mercury and other poisonous substances. To the defence of the people employing them, we could say that in some cases they had a better understanding of the ingredients and how to dose and dilute them, but that does not take away the fact that some of the spells were putting peoples' health at great risk, in some cases with a fatal end. We must also consider that just because a spell was seen in print does not mean that it was widely employed. 16 Klintberg 1965:26 17 Klintberg 1965:44"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"INTRODUCT ION 25 THE MYTH OF THE BOOK OF BLACK ARTS « Alomonic Magical Arts also has a resemblance in themes, V spells and remedies with the 'Long Lost Friend' first published in Pennsylvania in 1820 by the German immi­grant John George Hohman18• The first page reads: Whoever carries this book with him is safe from all his enemies, visible or invisible; and whoever has this book with him, ca nnot die without the holy corpse of Jesus Christ, nor drowned in any water, nor burn up in any fire, nor can any unjust sentence be passed upon him.

But the pow­ers connected to the mere ownership ofboth the 'Long Lost Friend' and other grimoires from Europe can also be found in the Swedish tradition, as we will see below. Even in mod­em day Haiti the 'Le Veritable Dragon Rouge' has an extraor­dinary reputation. The notoriety of the Books of Black Art is confirmed by folklorist Eva Wigstrom (1832-1901) who reports incidents where people fe ared being alone with her, and even refusing to speak with her because of the fact that she had been reading such books20• It was believed that a Book of the Black Art was difficult to destroy and it was seen as a powerful magical object in itsel£ If thrown into a fire or a lake, it possessed the pow­er to return.

A proper method of getting rid of a Book of Black Art was to hide it in the walls of a church, sealed well with bricks and mortar. A legend told by Heurgren in the foreword of the printed edition of Salomonic Magical Arts is that of a book inside the walls of Gronby Church in Skane, in the southern ofSweden21• In the myth surround­ing magical books as powerful objects, hiding them inside the walls of a church was a common theme; the myth in this particular example has unfortunately not yet been inves­tigated fully. These myths seem very obvious since many of the magical rituals connected to the church-or items brought from the church-concerned banishing or protec­tion, and the church was mostly regarded as auspicious for magical workings. The power of the book itself is explained in the following incident of a church-goer: A woman, who owned a Book of the Black Arts once went to church and bad fo rgotten to bide it away. While she was gone, the children got abold of it. They opened it and started reading the chap­ter dealing with the conjuration of little devils. The woman started to get worried at church and went home, right in the middle of the sermon. When she arrived, the yard was filled with little devils, at­tacking her. Though, she managed to get inside and found three units of flax-seed which she threw at them. While they were occupied with picking up the seeds, she opened another chapter in the Book of the Black Arts and read, so that they had to leave. 22 The fact that the central character in this legend, the wise-21 Heurgren 1918:14. 22 Christoffersson 1915:12."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"INTRO DUCTION woman, was at church while the incident took place, is not a coincidence. Is she to be seen as the good Christian saviour who with her cunning knowledge regained power over the infernal spirits, or was she to blame for her absence when the children released them? Another story from southern Sweden is similar in theme, where a boy reads from a book of a wise person: Immediately a horde of little devils plunged out and yelled fo r work. The boy knew enough that if he would not give the ugly ones any work, they would get him. First be told them to manufacture 15 armfu ls of rope from the sand by the beach. It did not take long until they came back all sweaty and angry, askingfor more work. 'Now I want a flag­pole of thirty ells height made from one-inch stones!' yelled the boy. Aft er a while they arrived with the flagpole with claws all bloody, sparking with anger. 'What shall we do? What shall we do?' they yelled. What should the boy do now? But just as they were about to put their claws into him, he remembered. 'Now I want a weathercock from an honest consta­ble, he yelled in utter need. [. . .]And now they fa iled, for no matter how much they searched the land, they never found an honest constable. 1123 A major part of the legends surrounding the Nordic Book of Black Art concerns obtaining the book itself, and as in other traditions mere ownership of the book was connect­ed with great wisdom.

The priest was a man of God and of knowledge, who was both a scholar and a person deeply related to the daily life of rural people. He was often de­picted as wise and strict, but also as a drunkard or a clown. In one way he was a man ofliminality, with one foot in the cunning homes of his congregation, and the other in the bookshelves of scholarly knowledge.

He was indeed a person on the threshold; between what was accepted and what was not, between the cultivated and the wild. Within his office he was able to keep a small private library, and knew where to obtain other books of interest. 25 Friiding 2004: 32 ff.

In the echoes of this laughter Palmgren won the sympathies of the bishop and carried on with his business. Together with his colleague vicar and old student friend Victor Prinzell, he planned an under-cover visit at the home of a notori­ous wise-man called Anders i Fubult (en: Anders in Fuhult ). The purpose of the visit was to determine which one of the two men was the wisest. Palmgren dressed up in rags and travelled to the home of Anders i Fuhult.

Folklorists and scholars travelled the countryside seeking the knowledge of the rural wise people. A common word used to denote the Swedish traditional folk magical knowledge possessed by these people is trolldom. Most likely it is a later recon­struction of a wide array of folk magical customs such as divination, healing wounds and contacting the dead. The Word Book of the Swedish Academy (SAOB) translates it as: \"The activity of interfering in the course of nature with the aid of supernatural or occult methods (and with the help of the Dev­il or some other evil power)': This would be a rather religious definition, which in its general approach would denote any type of magical practice. The practitioners did not consider themselves as folk magicians, sorcerers or wizards; rather they were referred to as cunning men and women, healers or wise men and women. The word trolldom was rather a juridical term used in the prosecutions35• It is also a word commonly used in many sources to signify a specific local or national Swedish tradition.

The word is said to be connected to the old Swedish words !if or lef, originally meaning remedy ( sw: lakemedel) , which is also related to lyv, another Swedish word that was used to denote a magi­cal remedy36• The root lake-, is connected to the Anglo-Sax­on word lcece, and the Icelandic words lceknir and laknari, meaning 'incantator' or 'conjurer'. This example shows on how deep the connection between healing ailments and the use of magic was. In Finnish we find the two expressions 'Jumalan tauti' and 'panentatauti: The first is applied to a disease sent by God, as a result of one's unfaithful behavior, while the sec­ond term refers to a disease sent by a wizard. In the first case one stood helpless facing one's death, as nothing could be done to change the will of God. In the second case, the disease could be treated with spells and readings. Wizards from Finland and Lapland have always been notorious, partly because of their location in the northern parts of Scandinavia. North has, in many cultures, been regarded as the cardinal point of evil, even more so in this case where the northern parts of Sweden were indeed very desolate and dark. Even Luther claimed that one of the favourite dwelling places of the Devil was located either in Preussen (presently part of northern Germany), or in Lapland37• A frequent name in Sweden describing a magical disease was the Lapp-shot ( sw: lappskott), connoting an evil Lapp sor­cerer who had been performing a distant curse. The Swedish king Johan 111 had in 1575 given order to the vicars in the country to search for wizards and punish them according to the law of the church.

When they were untied a great hurricane would be unleashed. This is a description of a common method used within the trolldom tradition, and in the folk magical customs of Eu­rope too. Knitting was used to catch and release powers within the cord or cloth. Knitting a disease would hinder it from spreading. As the knots were released, or left to rot under a tree or a s tone, so would the disease be released or left to rot away. Many magical techniques were inspired by tools and trades of the daily life. Along with knitting we can find the methods of measuring away, moulding away, blow­ing away, fumigating away, shooting away, chopping away, drilling away, and carving away &c.

Their meanings relate to evil in­fluences getting stuck to the body. Fassna was also a com­mon name used for general skin problems such as bruises, skin rashes or eczema. Ifby chance you created enmity with the little people by throwing hot water onto their homes, or if by accident sat down at a spot ruled by their malign powers, the only hope might be to sacrifice something to them and asking them for forgiveness. It was believed that fa ssna could be forced upon the pa­tient by the elements, and could thus strike a victim from the weather, fire, water or from the soil. Several methods of divination in order for the practitioner were used to de­termine if a victim suffered from fa ssna or not, and what elemental form fa ssna assumed, such as reading signs from how melted lead behaved in water. Another method in­cluded assigning names of the elements to different stones, heating them in the fire and then throwing them in cold water. The element connected to the cracked stone would reveal the elemental source of the disease. If someone suffers fassna from meeting the victim, he must be cured in the following way.

One story tells us of a wise woman paying a visit to a house, where she required the family to guess whether the disease came from weather, water or earth. The woman then asked for three leaves of paper, on which she wrote the name of the sick person. She then produced a piece of bread (earth), sulphur (weather) and charcoal or ashes (fire). One of the notes was thrown into the well, which supplied water to the house for cook­ing, the second note was thrown in the fire over which the food of the patient was made; the last note was carried to a three-way crossroad. The woman then took the patient to the sauna where she rubbed his body with the bread, sul­phur and charcoal, after which she took the three items to the crossroads and buried them. On the third day after the treatment the sick person took a bath, and then the f assna departed42• The concept of fa ssna is not mentioned in Salomonic Mag­ical Arts, even though we can find treatments of related skin problems. The treatments of fa ssna as described above are typical to the trolldom tradition but not to Salomonic Mag­ical Arts. The tradition's connection between magic and pharmacy has always been quite tight, woven together with heathen lore and Christian beliefs. It was often said that the only way to learn magic was by rightful inheritance from an older family member.

The word \"navel\" is etymologically related to the Swedish word nav, meaning hub or nave-the central point of the body. Kloen has been described as \"a frog which has been flattened out by the wheel of a wagon\"43 or as a worm with claws. All humans were said to be inhabited by the worm, and it was not until it was moved from its original natural dwelling place in the body that it became a problem. In healthy peo­ple you could feel \" ... Kloen strike like a little hammer.\" 44, whereas in a sick person Kloen often caused fatigue, severe pain in the chest, stomach aches, hysteria and anxiety.

When the life worm moves up under the chest, the sick person is haunted by severe pain, followed by vomiting. Ifit reached the head, he or she became insane, and ifit moved into the chest, madness was assured. Kloen was inevitable and followed humans through their whole lives. At birth, small worms were said to reach out along all sides from their nest in the navel, and at the time of death, they ate the corpse. Modersjukan was cured by certain gnidangummor (en: 'rubbing ladies'), where the patient had to lie in supine po­sition, while the belly was rubbed with an open hand us-43 Forsblom 1927:240. 44 Forsblom 1927:240."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 43 ing animal fat, in movements towards the navel, but never over it.

When the vodka had been stirred, one exhaled three times in it. Vodka, cof­fe e and milk were the three remedies most often employed for conquering Kloen, together with certain readings and procedures, always in odd numbers. The concept of a living worm inside the body is interest­ing. The worm was seen as a necessary life-sustaining force but could also act life threatening. Its mythos was connect­ed to both the tapeworm and Calliphoridae larvae, and we find a similar concept in Indian tantric yoga where the Kundalini snake is said to be coiled up between the anus and the genitals waiting to rise up in the body, bringing en­lightenment and fulfilment. But if not done properly, with the right guidance, madness is said to await the practitio­ner. Many cultures have ascribed the area around the navel with life-retaining qualities.

A disease caused by an elf was often called alvbldst, alibldst (en: 'elven wind'), a/veld (en: 'elven fire') or simply alver (en: 'elves'). In Swedish folk legends, elves were regarded as a rather brutal and aggressive force. Human contact with them was for the purpose of avoiding conflict, rather than healing or soothing an already existing ailment. Elves, as in the Swed­ish words alver and alvor, would often be interchangable, depending on local variations, while some stories made a distinction between the two, where alver would be con­nected to an invisible force, or the little people living un­derground, while alvor were seen as particularly fe male nature spirits, often seen dancing in the fog at night.

Then he told me not to thank him and that I bad to be under a roof before sunset, otherwise the itch would be seven times worse. When I was dressed the old man looked in a cal­endar to see when sunset was to occur. Then we agreed that I would make it to Hammersbo before sunset.

In the case above nothing is said about the di­agnosis; elves were the reason behind his disease. But there are many similar cases where this is so, in which the healer tries to cure the ailment by going directly to the source of the problem, by sacrificing to the elves. 46 Abrahamsson 1956:41."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"46 Salamonie Magical Arts THE PAGAN INFLUENCE �, Rolldom is a common name for folk magical practice in Sweden, and also in many cases in Norway, Denmark, Iceland and parts of Finland. Geographically, Sweden is an oblong and topographically diverse country, accounting for local differences in the northern, middle and southern parts. While this fact is not my principal concern, I will give a brief summary of the magical practices and beliefs in Swe­den where traces of both heathen and Christian practices are found in the trolldom tradition. The Icelandic sagas contain many examples of Norse magic and divination. The Poetic Edda by Snorre Sturlas­son holds many sources of knowledge on Norse magic still in use today. For example, the importance of employing an earth-fast stone in magic is evident in Gr6galdr Verse 15, also found in Salomonic Magical Arts (74, 114, 117, §346). Oden is mentioned as a great wizard even to that extent that he practiced the Norse shamanic art of sejd, which was considered for women only. But Oden shunned nothing in his hunt for magical knowledge. For nine days and nine nights he hung himself on the world tree, sacrificing him­self to himself, where he gained hidden knowledge about the runes: 1cELAND1 c: Veit ek, at ek hekk vindga meioi d naJtr altar niu, geiri undaor ok gefinn 6oni, sjalfr sjalfum mer, d peim meioi, er manngi veit hvers af r6tum renn. 47 47 Jonsson at Heimskringla, #i38."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 47 swE DISH: Jag vet, att jag hangde pd det vindiga tra­det nio hela natter, dj upt stungen med spjut och given dt Oden, jag sjalv dt mig sjalv, uppe i det trad, varom ingen vet, av vad rot det runnit upp.48 ENGLISH: I trow I hung on that windy Tree nine whole days and nights, stabbed with a spear, offe red to Odin, myself to mine own self given, high on that Tree of which none hath heard from what roots it rises to heaven. 49 The sagas contain many examples where the characters receive omens through dreams and visions, in for exam­ple Brennu-Njdls saga, Gunnlaugs saga ormstungu or Dro­plaugarsona saga. In chapter 4 of Eiriks saga rauaa we can find descriptions of a wizard woman singing the magical vardlokkur songs. The Nordic pagan heritage is filled with accounts of magic. In the first verses of the Finnish national epic poem Kalevala we can also find passages that reveal the great importance of poetry, songs and galders in the Nordic magical tradition: There are other words of magic, Incantations I have learned, Plucked in passingfrom the wayside, Some I broke off from the heather, Some I gathered from the bushes, Others pulled from tender saplings, Rubbed from haytips, snatched from hedges 48 Sturlasson 1992:36. 49 Bray 1908, #137."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"48 Salomonic Magical Arts Where I roamed about the cowpaths As a youngster herding cattle {. .. ] Then the frost was singing verses, Many a rhyme the rain recited, Other poems the wind delivered, On the seawaves songs came drifting, Magic charms the birds have added And the treetops incantations. 50 When the runes or Norse staves/sigils were to be used in a more magical context they were often referred to as rune­galders ( sw: rungaldrar ). The word galder is connected to the Swedish words galen (en: crazy) and gala (en: 'to crow') which is why the magical incantations are believed to have been sung in falsetto. The word galen is also traced to the Icelandic word galinn, which denotes a person who is cursed51• If carrying too much knowledge about the galders you were said to be forever lost in darkness. The Finnish word runo still today means 'poem' or 'song'.52 The importance of the dynamics between written and spoken magic is very apparent in the Nordic tradition, and the use of runes and galders is a frequent custom in the old Nordic magical tradition. Up until today we find the popularization and great impact of the runes in a variety of esoteric schools, and the pagan heritage of the Nordic countries can still today be found in the spells and remedies of the trolldom tradition. Most obvious are the workings connected directly to the pagan gods, as for example this one, from the south-east of Sweden in the late 19th century: 50 Friberg 1988:41 51 Hellquist 1922:177 52 Enoksen 2002:161"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 49 SWEDISH INCANTATION: Fyllaredutforberget, hiistenvredsinviin­stra Jo t, sd matte hon Freja.

The Icelandic gri­moires show a fusion between pagan magic and a more Christianised \"Salomonic\"' style magic, just as in Salomon­ic Magical Arts, where Salomonic seals are mixed with al­chemical signs and rune-inspired staves. In manuscript 'Lbs 2413 8vo' popularized and published by the Icelandic Museum of Sorcery & Witchcraft, the Nordic elements are called upon to gain invisibility, for catching thieves and as in this example, for inducing severe flatulence: Carve on oak.

The number of times the runes were to be carved relied on the importance of auspicious numerology from pagan magic. The importance of Norse numerology was supported by scholars like professor Sigurd Agrell, whose approach was both scientific and mystic. He believed that the Old Norse 24-rune Futhark was coded, bearing hidden esoteric meaning and knowledge. According to him its real name was Uthark, since the Ur-rune symbolizing the beginning of everything, was to be put first in the alleged encrypted rune row. This would mean that the Fehu-rune had to be placed as the last rune in the Uthark, which for Agrell was very logical since it represented cattle or livestock. The creation originated in the Ur-state (en: 'of, from') and ended with the domesticated Fehu-state, according to this theory.57 The Uthark theory also claims magical significance to the ALU formula (Ffn) as found on rune stones and carvings. The gematria of the runes are, as found in the Uthark: A=3 L=20 u= 1. They sum up to 24-the number of runes in the entire Futhark/Uthark, which is why the formula is consid­ered to represent the whole rune row and thus considered sacred and magical. The word AL u was also suggested to have been related to the word' ale', connecting it to the poet mead of Oden called Odrorir, provoking ecstasy and esoter­ic knowledge58• The ALU formula has in general been seen as a protective rune combination. Galders were also found to have been used in the Nor­dic wrestling sport glima. Rune researcher and glima wrestler Lars Magnar Enoksen tells us that the wrestling staves called glimagaldrar were considered less danger-57 Karlsson 2002:26, 41-42. 58 Karlsson 2002:65."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"52 Salamonie Magical Arts ous knowledge. One such glimagalder is the Ginfaxi. This galder was symbolically constructed to represent the hid­den knowledge of Glima resembling foot work and how to affect the opponents balance by the fe et and hips. Ginfaxi was also, as with many other Nordic and Icelandic seals applied with blood, under the sole of one's left foot59• An­other glimagalder, from the Icelandic tradition, was to be carved on a human shoulder blade with steel and kept in the shoe.60 It is in the Nordic sagas we first notice the importance of incantations and the spoken word later found in the folk magical tradition in Scandinavia. Great emphasis was put on secrecy and the potency of merely uttering a word charged with magical power. PAGAN DEITIES P Agan gods and powers were especially beneficial for practicing magic in Sweden, even to the extent that hunters aimed their weapons and fired against the sun on Easter morning, as a symbolical act to show their dislike of the resurrection of Christ, seen as an opposer of the hea­then gods. This image does not always reinforce a dualistic worldview; the picture was more complex in nature. Many spells were performed on Christian holidays, most often due to their Christian religious importance. Sunday for ex­ample, was a day of rest and peace which is why magic could be performed without the intervention from either curious neighbours or God. Thursday ( sw: torsdag, day of Tor) was 59 Enoksen 2002:164. 60 Rafnsson 2008:79."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 53 very auspicious for magical workings, and was a day under the influence of the pagan god Tor. Simply mentioning the word 'priest' at sea could have di­sastrous effects, and would bring bad luck to fishing. One story tells of an inexperienced man who invited a priest for coffee on his boat. This mistake required the exclusive solu­tion of sailing back home and washing the boat thorough­ly61. The best fishing net was said to be made by women when they had their heathen skin, formed during pregnancy before the birth of the child. A phenomenon found as a re­occurring theme by Swedish folklorist Ebbe Schon was the solulv (en: sunwolf). It was explained as scene in the sky where the sun seemed to be engulfed by a cloud, shaped like a mouth. Schon compares this belief with the pagan concept of Ragnarok, the end of time, where gods and the chaotic powers are confronted in one final battle and the wolf will swallow the sun62. Even though people openly followed the Christian faith, it was commonly believed that there were some parts in life where Christ or God had no influence or power. Such realms were governed by pagan powers such as Agir, god of the ocean, or other undefined oceanic powers outside the reach of the hand of God. Many powers in Swedish folk belief were connected to certain occupations or natural forces and could be considered neither pagan (as in pre­Christian) or Christian. They were rather a product of the oral folk tradition and very much so connected to a distinct Swedish tradition; they were the little people, the elves, the Nixie and the Neck. Another interesting beliefis the taboo of bringing rowan aboard a ship. Rowan was a tree often 61 Schon 2002:106-115 62 Schon 2002:121"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"54 Sa/omonic Magical Arts employed in trolldom, even so in Salomonic Magical Arts63, and was connected to the pagan god Tor, who in some cases was said to have a hostile approach against the nature spir­its and other forces of folk belief, which again tells us that it is hard to find a common conception or a unified belief system in the tradition offolk magic. It is important to make a distinction between what was seen as pagan magic or belief, what was un-Christian and what was anti-Christian or blasphemous. Just because a Christian act or text was performed or read backwards, did not mean it had any anti-Christian or blasphemous inten­tions. Rather it was the backward effect that possessed the power. We find the employment of sinistral and anti-clock­wise magic in many cases, where mundane actions were performed in order to reach a magical state, rather than to act as blasphemous. But of course we can find examples where a blasphemous effect was sought in actions like these as well, as mentioned in the example of the hunters who aimed at the Easter-sun. Luckily, we can find examples signifying both cases in oral tradition, with different local variations. A common result of the establishment of Christianity across the world was the correspondence between Chris­tian saints and pagan deities. When pagan traditions were assimilated into the Christian ritual year and the old gods were demonized, saints such as St Olav came to resemble the powers' of Tor, and St Erik that of the fe rtility god Fro64• Both St Olav and Tor were envisioned and depicted as brave warriors on the battlefield, while St Erik was petitioned for good harvest in accordance to his pagan counterpart Fro.65 63 See Spell Index for more info. 64 65 Edsman 1996:235-236."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 55 We can also find accounts of how pagan traditions, such as sacrificing to the dead, have survived up until today as an unquestioned ritual praxis where the original intention of the act has been long forgotten. It has merely survived un­der the motivation of routine and heritage. The tradition has in these cases been given its own life. 66 The pagan act of sacrifice has been seen as a very impor­tant ritual praxis where emphasis and importance was di­vided into several areas of conduct, as explained with the four words: bioja, biota, soa, senda (en: 'to pray, to sacrifice, to sacrifice/suffocate/sooth, to send'). A fifth wordgefa (en: 'to give') has been found to explain the nature of the sacri­fice, seen as a gift. Bioja has been explained as the calling of the forces, the invocation or evocation, the initial prayer; biota would denote the sacrifice itself, maybe in a more technical form; soa is a word which has been connected to both the Old High German word souna (en: soothing/ calming the wrath of the gods) and the old English word aswogan (en: suffocate), and has been connected to the act of slaughtering, in the case of an animal; senda would then be the distribution of the sacrifice among the gods and as a communion meal for the devotees67• In Htivamtil it is asked if one has the knowledge acquired to perform a sacrifice: Veistu, hve rista ska/?

The horse had an exceptional position as a sacrifice as it was a most important belonging for the hea­then people, and in the myths we can also find the horse Sleipner being the eight-footed mount of Oden. The prac­tice of sharing horse meat as a communion with the pagan gods was a very rooted practice, even to the extent that the prohibition against such practices had to be overlooked in order for the Icelandic people to convert to Christianity.69 CHRISTIAN INFLUENCE 'i T was said that when the Cistercian cloister of Guds­,.J berga in the province of Dalarna in Sweden was shut down in 1544, one of the remaining monks came to make a living as a fortune teller70• As an effect of the protestant ref­ormation, many monks ended up as doctors in villages across the nation, bringing with them their Catholic tradi­tion together with the knowledge of reciting prayers and employing herbs. Much occult knowledge from the Middle Ages was preserved and passed on within the walls of the cloisters. It is also from the cloisters, through the practical skills of monks and nuns, that we have inherited considerable cun­ning-folk knowledge of herbs and minerals.

Using Christian deities in invocations, together with magical methods, was seen as an heretical act, which is why the church tried to influence the people in using prayers to a larger extent. But as we can see in many folk magical tradi­tions across the globe, the Christian scholarly tradition was often, as well as in this case, popularized and adapted by the common people to fit their daily life and magical aims. The following blood-staunching example is typical of the Nordic trolldom tradition: Blood, o' blood, red blood, be still, as the water in the Red Sea, when Moses went through.

The incantation above is also very similar to the Merseburg Incantation mentioned earlier, which is why we in this case can speak of a pagan heritage dressed up in Christian symbolism. For obvious reasons Noah, John the Baptist and Mo­ses were often called upon in workings related to blood­staunching as they all three are connected to vivid myths related to the powers of water, as seen in the example above.

The image of the water being controlled during the healing session or the mythical event would rather be a heritage from apocryphal stories stem­ming from Byzantine and Eastern liturgy. Edsman contin­ues by telling us that the church had undergone a series of efforts in seeking to interpret the models of the New Testa­ment by seeking to find corresponding themes in the Old Testament, where they had compared the Flood of Deluge with the Water of Baptism (Jordan). The correspondence lies in the idea that people were in both cases redeemed; in the first by escaping the water, and in the second by the water. The deluge that once killed, turns into the water of life through the baptism of Christ, and drowning their sins. This liturgy was passed on through the works of Olaus Pe­tri (1493-1552) where he continues to compare the baptism of Christ to a \"beneficial deluge\" 78• This concept was later assimilated into the invocations of the country folks, and some ended up in notorious Books of the Black Art. Swedish king Erik IX, who ruled 1155-1160, was peti­tioned for good harvests and began to be worshipped as a saint shortly after his death.

This cult was not imme­diately approved by the pope Alexander 111 as he in 1172 sent a letter to the Swedish king, where he denied the can­onization of a person who \"was killed as a drunkard, in the manners of heathens''.79 He was nonetheless continuously worshipped in a cult outside the reach of the pope. But maybe the most famous cult surrounding a saint in Sweden is that of St Olav (995-1030), the Norwegian king who was celebrated in all Swedish episcopates on the St Olav Day the 29th ofJuly, and who often was accompanied by St Erik as an idol standing in the churches. He was the first Scandi­navian saint and a patron saint of seamen and farmers. His story is told in the Heimskringla, the Nordic chronicle of kings written by Snorri Sturlasson. In one passage we can read about his healing powers and how they came to be re­garded as a miracle: \"Go,\" said she, \"to King Olaf, he is the best physician here; and beg him to lay his hands on thy lad, and bring him my words if he will not otherwise do it.\" She did as the queen told her; and when she fo und the king she said to him that her son is dangerously ill of a boil on his neck, and begged him to lay his hand on the boil. The king told her he is not a physi­cian, and bid her go to where there were physicians. She replied, that the queen had told her to come to him; \"and told me to add the request from her, that you would use the remedy you understood, and she said that thou art the best physician here in the town.\" Then the king took the lad, laid his hands upon his neck, and felt the boil fo r a long time, until 79 Hess 2010:1"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION the boy made a very wry fa ce.

INFLUENCES \" S stated, there are primarily two major sources that U could have influenced the compilation of spells, con­jurations and cunning remedies written down by Gaslander and later popularized under the name Salomonic Magical Arts. The first source deals with the cunning tradition of the country people in the area where he lived, and in whatever other areas he could have visited in his office as a pastor.

Here we find a great local and national tradition of spell works, cunning craft and magic, even though we must be careful when calling them unique as some of them have been influenced by a much later printed grimoire and household book tradition. This said, they are no less a part of the tradition. It is through these diverse sources that we can discern the Swedish or Nordic tradition of folk magic, often referred to as trolldom. The second source of influence is transmitted by writ­ing or print and derives primarily from southern Europe, through the grimoire and household book traditions. Brin­geus has proved that many of the spells presented in Salo­monic Magical Arts can be traced back to the work ofWolf­gang Hildebrand, called Magia Naturalis81, which in tum can be traced back to the work of Johann Baptista Porta. This is a more learned or academic form of magic, often ap­pearing in Latin.

In France during the late 17th and early 18th century, this phenomenon arrived at its peak when magical and occult texts alongside household and gardening guides were published in larger editions, called the bibliotbeque bleue82• The English Physician by Nicholas Culpeper was one of the first medicinal books to be published in the American colonies, aimed for a broader audience. In the book, first printed in the American colonies in 1708,83 he gives exam­ples of remedies for all sorts of diseases, by the employment of common herbs and plants rather than the exotic ones promoted by scholars and doctors. Culpeper's audience was the common people and the poor, whom he wanted to educate in self-treatment because of the complexity and corruption he saw in the scholarly health care. Culpeper was also the one who came to popularize the correspon­dence between plants and planetary virtues, a system used in his medicinal-mystic language, which is still applied today in different esoteric and occult schools84• Another example was the well-known Long Lost Friend by Johann Georg Hohman, which has some similarities with Salomonic Magical Arts in methods and themes. Swedish equivalents to these texts would have been 'Den 82 Davies 2010:95-98. 83 First published in England in 1652 under the name \"The English Physitian: or an Astrological Discourse on the Vulgar Herbs of this Nation.\" 84 Flannery 2007:2 ff."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"64 Salomonic Magical Arts slug a och fo rstdndiga gubben' (en: 'The cunning and well­advised old man') and 'Den kloka och husaktiga gumman' (en: 'The wise and tending old lady').

The 'Bondepraktikan' was a book more involved with divi­nations connected to the rural year cycle. The Bauernprak­tik was first published in Germany in 1508, and had simi­larities in themes to the ancient Mesopotamian work called The Farmer's Instructions. The last part of the Black Book, including the chart, is obviously copied from this source. Another Swedish book dealing with divination was 'Kort­sp rdket eller Kortens betydelse' (en: 'The language of cards or The meaning of the cards') where a method for divination using a deck of playing cards was described, together with an explanation of the meaning of all the cards in the whole deck, in a rather poetic tone.

The text was first published in Darmstadt, Germany in 1610 and was trans­lated into Swedish in 1650 and 1654. Will-Erich Peuckert shows in his Die egyptiscben Gebeimnisse that Hildebrand's text goes back even further, and it is shown that his work is based on that of Johann Baptista Porta (1535-1615), who was an Italian scholar from Naples.

The case of employing cipher to hide words in Books of the Black Arts in Sweden was not a completely common prac­tice, but gives us an indication that some methods or names were especially best not to be written and should be kept secret.

We also find conjurations using the infernal hierarchy in Salamonie Magical Arts. Number 56 of the Red Book and §90 of the Black Book use the conjurations of Lucifer, Belzebub and Pluto. This suggests influences from the Faustian gri­moire tradition from such works as Threefold Coercion of Hell and/or Magia Na turalis et Innaturalis. It was most common to use the spirits from the infernal hierarchy when conduct­ing magical workings aimed at punishing other people, or catching thieves. The idea that 'evil banishes evil' was a common concept in the tradition of the wise folk. When the infernal spirits are found in workings aimed for healing it is often in combination with Jesus, Mary or the Holy Trin­ity. In those cases, the infernal spirits are seen as either the direct or symbolic source of the disease, which had to be bound and controlled by the use of Christian powers, such as in §2o oftheBlackBook. Wedoalsofindexamples (§48) where healing wounds were done in the name of the Devil. As shown, we can find some references to the infernal hierarchy in the Swedish Books of Black Arts, and also in Salamonie Magical Arts. Most common are the great spirits Lucifer and Beelzebub while the occurrence of spirits in a lower rank is not as frequently found. 98 Ek 1964:34."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"INTRODUC TION Magical Themes in Salamonie Magical Arts 71 Finally we tum to examples of themes and methods em­ployed within the Salomonic Magical Arts manuscript, which will be briefly commented upon. WISDOM MAGIC mOst of the spells in Salomonic Magical Arts were em­ployed to conquer everyday problems, to which or­dinary solutions could not be found. We can, on the other hand, find a type of spell aimed at gaining wisdom, im­mense power or esoteric knowledge, where the outcome of the working not always was clearly defined. These work­ings would often incorporate finding a swallow stone ( 69, §336), snake or frog stone (81a, §333. §334), ant stone (§335) or knowing the future (16, §195). We can also find cases of spirit communication, some times in of a more cer­emonial nature (50, 70, 74, §19). The lindworm ( 49) is connected in legend with the English wy vern and is in Salomonic Magical Arts related to the 'white snake' which is said to give wisdom to whoever consumes it. This deity is related to the legend of Sigurd Fafnersbane, eating the blood and the heart of the dragon Fafner after killing him, from which he receives knowledge and understands the language of birds; the same theme is found the German equivalent Nibelungelied.

Risking your life against the snake was a regular practice, meaning it was serious and fatal business. In a place where they had a lot of snakes, and a man arrived who knew how to kill them. He asked if they had seen a white snake, and they answered \"n o·: He made a big.fire and climbed up in a tree. He and the snakes should risk life against life. The fire started to burn properly and all kinds of snakes came into the fire. Then two black snakes came, fo llowed by the white one.

It was com­pletely dark inside, but the books were written with fiery red letters glowing in the dark. The students were fully ed­ucated after three or seven years and upon graduation, the Devil would snatch the last student leaving his school. This myth has given birth to many different variations in which one of the students tricks the Devil, and in the end brings freedom for all his fe llow pupils.100 According to a legend from northern Sweden, a priest with magical abilities was thought to have received his knowledge in the school in Wittenberg. He had been lowered down to Beelzebub upon giant scales, and he was not released from his duties until another priest was lowered down on the other side, causing balance in weight, and taking his place in the school.101 In Sweden such a school was also said to be lo­cated in Lund, which also was and still is, the city of a prom­inent University. Knowledge was in many cases connected to the black arts. One reason why the University of Wittenberg was re­garded an important place for studying magic had a lot to do with the fact that both Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon used to study there. For Luther himself Satan was a highly present force in daily life, and he spread many stories about the nature of evil. Common images were the heretical spirits in animal form and the Devil's relation­ship with fa�ces. We find the same heretical images of the hindparts in the witch trials where the prosecuted witches were said to have been visiting Blakulla, where they copu­lated with the Devil and kissed his anus. This image was reinforced by Luther who was said to have confronted the Evil One in many battles. In one such battle he used the 100 Ottman 2010:20. 101 Till hagen 1958:5i."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"74 Salomonic Magical Arts phrase 'lick my ass' to banish the Devil 102 and was probably regarded as a mighty wizard, being a source of inspiration for later priests with an inclination to magical practice. In some passages of Salomonic Magical Arts we can find references to letters ofWittenberg (5, 16, 68, 78, §i23, §i40, §355); characters of power that were employed to empower the spell. Some of the sigils and symbols found in Salomonic Magical Arts were presented on the last pages of the hand writing. Most obvious are the names of the planets that re­semble different days of the week, or the Hebrew alphabet; but we also find sigils and letters with a more occult mean­ing, in many cases presumably inspired by the European grimoire tradition. KALAMARIS 4\"\\ Widely applied written formula in the Scandinavian U tradition, connected to the Books of Black Art, is the Kalamaris-formula. Sven B. Ek suggests that the word prob­ably has its roots in the word calmaris, which can be traced back to the Middle Ages, and being related to the English word calm. The formula is most often found spelled with nine letters, as odd numbers and especially the number nine were of great magical significance. Variations in spell­ing can also be found, such as: Calameber, Kalamaran, Kala­my ris or Kalmerij. Calamaris and Calemeriswere common in Germany, and the latter was also being used in Denmark to some extent.103 The formula was generally applied for soothing or calm-102 Muchembled 2002:168-169. 103 Ek 1964:18-19."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 75 ing ailments, especially toothache. In Salomonic Magical Arts we find the word Kalamiber being used for curing fever (§22). In this case it is not applied over a period for nine days but to be consumed together with beer. In the amend­ment ( A2) the word Kaladaria is also used against fe ver, to be written on bread together with instructions on what days the pieces should be consumed, expressed in astrologi­cal signs. A similar formula is found in The Testament of Solomon, concerned with banishing the demon Agchonion: I am called Agchonion. I lie among swaddling­clothes and in the precipice. And if any one write on fig-leaves 'Lycurgos,' taking away one letter at a time, and write it, reversing the letters, I retire at once.

There are many different ways to employ corpses, skulls, corpse teeth, graveyard dirt or objects that used to belong to a deceased person. It was believed that one would gain 104 Conybeare 1898:38."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"76 Salomonic Magical Arts clairvoyant powers if crawling under a coffin or using a towel which used to cover up a corpse.105 The dead, togeth­er with other supernatural beings, were sacrificed to in or­der to soothe them or make them stay away from the affairs of the living. The veneration and potency of the powers of the dead are found on the Stentoften runestone, on which the message is similar to that off or example the Bjorketorp runestone: a curse to be put on whoever dares to destroy the grave site. The practices surrounding working with the dead are of­ten referred to internationally as necromancy, when speak­ing about all sorts of magic connected to death, spirits of the deceased or the graveyard. Though, the suffix -mancy from the Greek word manteia, meaning 'prediction' or 'divination', leave us with the definition; divination by the use of death. Using the dead only for divination was far from the truth. A more general applicable word for magi­cal workings like this would then be 'necro magic' or 'necro cunning'. The graveyard was an auspicious place in which people went for gathering ingredients or for performing magical workings, 106 and the use of such ingredients was common in the trolldom tradition. In Iceland one would obtain a pair of ndbr12kur (en: 'corpse-trousers' or 'necro pants') for gaining riches. You had to skin a corpse from the waist and down which would then be worn by the practi­tioner.107 But the graveyard dirt was also in some cases seen as harmful and poisonous, and nothing was to be plucked which grew in the cemetery. The dead did not like it, and it was a practice that could lead to one's death.

Sometimes such material worked as repellents against evil influences, and sometimes it was used to induce strength. Human bones were of course a very potent ingre­dient, which could be borrowed from the graveyard if it was returned after use, as seen in § 24, §72 & §io5a. If you want to return what was stolen then you should visit the graveyard and borrow a bone fo r a pre-determined set of days. Then you shall wash the bone in running water, but you must not speak a word to anyone while carrying the bone. Then you put it where the stolen goods used to be and hide close by. It will not take long until the thief arrives. He will get a ter­rible remorse and be struck by pain until he places the stolen good from where he took it. But you must not fo rget to return the bone upon the day, otherwise the dead will come and get it, and it will not be a pleasant meeting. 108 A similar rite can be found in Salamonie Magical Arts (90, §24, §25).

This was not merely con­nected to superstition or magical symbolism but also had a medicinal reliability. Faecal treatments were addressed in the 18th century pharmacopoeias, and there were even books that specialized on the subject, as the one written and compiled by Dr. Kristian Frantz Paullini called \"Dreck­Apotheke\". It contained over 400 pages and was printed in seven editions between 1696 and 1748. Freces were sold in drug stores and was said to be especially good for inhibiting inflammation, relieving pain and against the bubonic plague. This was a practice also supported by Luther, and strangely as it seems the hindparts produced a remedy sanctioned by God. Luther said: ,,Mich wundert dass Gott so bohe Artzney in den Dreck gesteck habe\".109 Swedish books contained similar treatments in which highly respected doctors and professors used fa�ces both in bandages and for ingestion. One such book, the Pharma­copoeja holmiensis Galeno-Chymica was first published in 1686 and was considered the most influential book on the subject for almost a hundred years. At this time the Royal Health Commission even ordinated a drink boiled from cow faeces for maintaining sweating. If using horse fre ces, the best quality was said to be obtained from a black stal­lion110. Early 18th century pharmacopoeias often contained complex recipes with exclusive ingredients, similar to those found in the Salomonic Magical Arts. At approximately the same time, Swedish botanist Carl von Linne (1707-1778) 109 'I am amazed that God has put so much remedy in thefceces.' Berggren 2007:19. 110 Berggren 2007:20."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"80 Salomonic Magical Arts started questioning the complex recipes and advocated a more clinical study of the ingredients themselves, rather than the remedy as a whole. It is easy to assume that publications like this were in the book shelves of scholars like Gaslander, who wrote and compiled Salomonic Magical Arts. The ingredient in the ex­ample above with the black stallion can be considered mag­ical; its fa:ces bore the powers of the strong, healthy horse in it. According to a folk magical rule, an object or a bodily remnant that once belonged to a person or animal was seen as a sympathetic representation of the powers of the former owner, a link to his or her soul. In Salomonic Magical Arts we can for example find the use off:Eces both as a remedy for wounds and against fe ver ( 63 ), but also for catching pranksters ( §21 ), improving your rifle (BB §112), hexing a rifle (A3), and against swarming bees (100 ). We can even find an example where the power of a horse is transferred to another, by letting it ingest the oth­er one's faeces together with garlic and castoreum (§98). Thus we find a conception of the faeces carrying the powers of its original owner, or as a sympathetic materia symbol­izing the qualities one wants to have bestowed upon one­sel£ The repulsive powers of the faeces correlate with the folk magical theme 'evil repels evil: In many traditions bad smell was used to expel evil forces, and the infliction of a new wound was used to heal old ones. The most common example of this in Salomonic Magical Arts is the use of evil forces or methods of magic for capturing thieves. In those cases 'evil' is used for capturing another evil. Still in use to­day is the Swedish saying: skit skall skit ha (en: 'shit will have shit')."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 81 BLOOD � Lood has been widely applied in the folk magical tradi-0 tion as a sympathetic means of power, or as a symbol for the life-force itsel£ Most frequently the pact with the Devil had to be sealed with one's own blood, pointing to the seriousness in one's intent. Wise people were often seen at the execution site gathering blood from the newly-dead, and those who suffered from epilepsy drank it warm direct­ly on the spot, as it was said to cure them 111• The blood from a brave soldier was seen as very potent, as was that of thieves. Menstrual blood has been used as an ointment for rashes but also for protection against the Mare. In Salomon­ic Magical Arts as in the rest of the trolldom tradition, we also find the use of blood from a variety of animals. Cocks are most common in Salomonic Magical Arts. Many exam­ples of using animal parts can also be found, most often in which the animal had to be killed, in order to obtain them. The animal can be seen both as a sacrifice for the spell to­gether with the use of its heart, liver or whatever sympa­thetic organ was employed. Very rarely do we find animal sacrifices in themselves employed in spell casting. The practitioner's own blood was used in a variation of spells from protection against the law (59 ), to getting a steady flow of money ( 60) to writing pacts with spirits (74) . Magical Wittenberg characters would often have to be written in animal blood, preferably a cock. Today we find a similar practice of modern magicians sealing pacts by with letters written in Dove's Blood or Dragon's Blood. These are, in many cases, only traditional occult names de­scribing an ink mixture containing no blood at all, while 111 Tillhagen 1958:128."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"82 Salomonic Magical Arts the blood referred to in the European grimoire tradition and in the Nordic trolldom tradition was most often real. Blood staunching was a common practice in the Nor­dic cunning-folk tradition together with blood-letting and cupping. Blood staunching was in the tradition very often employed together with a magical verse, containing Christian or pagan themes, similar to the Merseburg In­cantations. But we can also find shorter verses emphasizing rhymes and alliteration: Oden Doden vaster i skogen kom o stann bloden. 112 On some occasions, as seen in §48, it was also performed with the aid of the Devil. Blood staunching is still today widely practiced in the northern parts of Sweden. Blood-letting was applied when the disease was said to travel in the blood. In order to be cured, one had to release the sick blood and have the body replace it with new. Cup­ping was a similar method in which a cup with a pipe on it was placed on the body and being sucked upon. This would create a vacuum in the cup, which eventually struck a hole in the skin and making the blood flow. This method would allow the practitioner to make blood flow on isolated areas ofthebody. 112 'Oden, Doden, west in the woods, come and stop the blood.'
