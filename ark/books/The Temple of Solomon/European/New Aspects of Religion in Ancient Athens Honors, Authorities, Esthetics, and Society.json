The search took very little time—mere seconds, in fact. It turned out that ὁσιότης and its cognates are quite rare and late on Athenian inscriptions. No person is designated as ὅσιος, and no person is praised for acting ὁσίως. Given the frequency and importance of these terms in philosophical and literary texts, that seemed odd, and it enticed me to investigate a rather wide range of religious terms and their contexts in Athenian inscriptions and led to the results in this book. And ὁσιότης became a mere Appendix.This study and this book would have been impossible without the on-line Searchable Greek Inscriptions, centered at Cornell University and Ohio State University and hosted by The Packard Humanities Institute, without the on-line Brill Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum, and without the on-line Thesaurus Linguae Graecae of the University of California, Irvine. For all three I express my deep gratitude to those many who have labored and contributed to create, update, and maintain these precious resources. They can be fully appreciated perhaps only by those who remember their excitement at the invention of the Ibycus by David W. Packard.As my work drew to a close, I benefited greatly from careful readings of the whole or parts of my manuscript by my colleague Elizabeth Meyer and by Angelos Chaniotis, Christopher Faraone, Robert Garland, Edward Harris, and an anonymous reader. They had many suggestions and corrections to offer, and the book was much improved. I owe a special debt of gratitude to Henk Versnel who saw value in the project, encouraged me in it, and promoted its publica-tion. And finally I express my gratitude to Frits Naerebout, Maarten Frieswijk, and Stephanie Paalvast, who accepted the manuscript for the Brill series Religions in the Graeco-Roman World and have seen it through to publication.In 1975 I dedicated my first book to my dear wife Mary, then as now the sine qua non of my life and work, and now I dedicate this book to her, in deepest affection and gratitude for fifty years of marital happiness and of copy-editing, proof-reading, and indexing."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"AbbreviationsThe abbreviations for periodicals are those listed in The American Journal of Archaeology 95 (1991), 1–16.

In ways that we do not find elsewhere these texts describe and, more importantly, characterize fundamental religious actions such as sac-rifice, prayer, the taking of omens, sponsorship of agones at heortai, supervi-sion of sanctuaries and of various religious activities, and the performance of numerous other religious duties. They indicate not only what was done but often the manner in which these acts were done. They provide, as it were, some adverbs to the verbs and some adjectives to the nouns of Greek religious prac-tice. What is it to sacrifice well? What makes a religious pompe good? Such questions are, in themselves, important, and they will lead us into new areas of study, including the social and esthetic aspects of Greek religious practices such as sacrifice and the other elements of heortai. These texts also indicate, far more often than the literary texts, the authorities on the basis of which reli-gious acts were performed, whether they be ancestral custom, laws, decrees, or oracles, and all this helps to explain why the Athenians did what they did in religion. Literary texts tend to emphasize the personal and familial sides of religious actions, but these epigraphical texts, more consistently and perhaps better than any other source, put these religious actions into a larger social and political context, whether of the polis, the tribe, the deme, or a variety of private associations. And, finally, they supplement the information we gather from elsewhere on the interaction of the Athenian polis and the hundreds, indeed thousands, of public and private religious cults of Athens.1 Did the polis, as often claimed, closely control the religious activities of priests, priest-esses, and individual worshippers? “Approbation” (Part 1) will lead, I trust, to a better understanding of “Authority” (Part 2) in Athenian practiced religion.1 For this study I heartily endorse the principles and methodology laid out by David Whitehead, 1993, especially the primary emphasis on the epigraphical material and the careful discus-sion of the relationship of that to prior and contemporary literary sources. Noteworthy here is Whitehead’s claim (p. 42), with only one word changed, that “by commending and reward-ing some attributes rather than others, and by doing so over and over again, these documents [i.e., inscriptions] delineate for us as no other kind of evidence so emphatically can the cardinal virtues of Athenian religion (my religion for his democracy) .”"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"2Introduction Part 1 ApprobationThe Athenians through their national organizations, the Boule and Ekklesia, and through their demes, tribes, gene, and other such units formally honored fellow citizens for a wide variety of religious acts and contributions. In the commendations inscribed on stelai they usually added to a simple descrip-tion of the action one or more adverbs, adjectives, or phrases to indicate the manner in which the action was done, and sometimes to make clear the pur-pose of the action. These qualifiers are for the most part formulaic, but they do indicate some important aspects of how Athenians wanted, e.g., sacrifices to be made, heortai to be held, pompai to be performed, and sanctuaries to be tended.In Chapter 1 we examine such qualifiers for sacrifices and for other elements of heortai such as pannychides, pompai, and agones. The property of deities, their sanctuaries and their dedications, also needed to be tended, and the manner in which the honorand did this is usually described. What emerges from these qualifying adverbs, adjectives, and phrases are social, moral, and, especially, esthetic aspects of these elements of Athenian religion. Priests and priestesses for polis cults, for deme cults, for other citizen cults, and for those of private associations have, in addition to sacrificing, various religious duties, and in Chapter 2 we survey in what terms they were praised for those, what makes a “good” priest or priestess. In Athens many besides priests and priest-esses performed sacrifices, sometimes as an officer or member of a governmen-tal unit, or of a genos, or of an association, and in Chapter 3 we examine who they were and in what terms they, too, were praised. A few priests and priest-esses and a small number of officials routinely or occasionally reported to the Boule or another organization the results of their sacrifices, and in Chapter 4 we survey who made such reports and what, in fact, they were reporting. Most religious activities in Athens were funded by the polis or by funds generated by the individual cults, but occasionally, and over time increasingly, individu-als contributed their own money. In Chapter 5 we look at who did contribute money, for what purposes, in which cults, and when, why, and in what terms they were praised.22 We do not treat in this Chapter or in this book the various ways the Athenian government funded or handled the funds for polis cults. That is an extremely complicated subject which itself would require a separate book."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 3Introduction Part 2 AuthorityIn terms of “authority” in Greek or Athenian religion one can concentrate on what authority various officials such as priests, government officials like the archon or basileus, lay boards such as the hieropoioi and epimeletai, and various others exercised, or on what authority the Ekklesia had vs. the Boule, the polis vs. the deme, the polis vs. the priests, and other such pairs. Useful evidence for this has been collected in Part 1, and we will draw some conclu-sions on these topics from that in Part 3, Approbation and Authority. In Part 2 we focus on what emerge as the four major determinants of religious actions, what authorities the Athenians claim when they are sacrificing or perform-ing other religious actions. These are “the ancestral customs” (τὰ πάτρια) (Chapter 6), laws (nomoi) and decrees (psephismata), together and separately (Chapter 7), and oracles (Chapter 8). In Chapter 9 we put these four authorities together, and each will be found to have its own role in determining religious actions, with some intersection and interplay, and each will be found to have a specific place in what we may see as a hierarchy of authority.3 Part 3 Approbation and AuthorityChapter 10 opens Part 3 with a translation and discussion of the pseudo-Aristotelian, but still early Rhetoric to Alexander, which brings together much of what we have been describing, in terms of both approbation and author-ity. In Chapter 11 we examine the authority of the polis in religious matters, through the Ekklesia, Boule, administrative and military officials, committees, and the courts. In Chapter 12 we bring together thoughts about Approbation, the praises and honors Athenians gave to those who performed religious actions for them. This leads to Chapter 13, on social and esthetic dimensions of Athenian religious practices.3 I was pleased to find that this type of investigation was recently recognized as a desideratum by A. Petrovic in the new Oxford Handbook of Greek Religion (2015.351): “What of the role of tradition, ta patria, and civic institutions? How do they formulate ritual norms? These questions, and many more, still await answers. But a first step in that direction might be to establish a clear taxonomy of the norms, by conducting an analysis of the attested types of authorities setting out cultic regulations. . . . If we gained a statistical overview of the extant ‘sacred laws’ by (epigraphic) genre, issuing authority, and content, we could start paving the way towards a fuller and more systematic understanding of the intricacies of Greek ritual life.” This I hope to have done for Athens."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"4IntroductionThe structure of the individual chapters and of the book as a whole requires some clarification. In general terms in Chapters 1–8 the evidence is given first, and in Chapters 1–5 some conclusions from that evidence are given in each chapter. For Chapters 6 (Τὰ Πάτρια), 7 (Nomoi and Psephismata), and 8 (Oracles), only the evidence is given. The conclusions drawn from these three chapters form Chapter 9 (The Four Authorities). Chapters 11, 12, and 13 then draw together evidence and conclusions from all preceding chapters for more comprehensive discussion. The appendices address discrete points that seemed relevant but not central to the argument of the book.The honorary texts at the heart of this study take many forms, but by way of introduction to them I offer one, a polis decree honoring Timocrite, priestess of Aglauros, daughter of Polynices, dated to 250/49 BC (SEG 33.115):In the archonship of Polyeuctus, in the second prytany, that of the tribe Erechtheis, for which Chaerephon the son of Archestratus was gramma-teus, on the eleventh of Metageitnion, on the eleventh day of the prytany, an ekklesia kuria. Of the presiding officers Cleidemus the son of Phrynon of the deme Phlya and his fellow presiding officers brought the vote. The following resolution was approved by the Boule and the Demos. Demostratus the son of Aristophanes of the deme Paiania proposed it. Concerning what Aristophanes the son of the priestess of Aglauros reports concerning the sacrificial animals (τὰ ἱερά) which she was sacri-ficing at the inaugural offerings (eisiteteria) to Aglauros, Ares, Helios, the Horai, Apollo, and the other gods to whom it was ancestral (πάτριον) (to sacrifice), with good fortune, it has been resolved by the Boule for the presiding officers who preside at the first meeting of the Ekklesia to deliberate about these things (in that part of the agenda devoted) to “sacred matters” (ἱερά), and to communicate to the Demos the opinion of the Boule that it seems right to the Boule for the Boule and Demos to accept the good things (τὰ ἀγαθά) that occurred in the sacrifi-cial victims (ἱερά) for the health and safety (ἐφ ̓ ὑγιείαι καὶ σωτηρίαι) of the Boule and the Demos of Athenians and their children and wives and for King Antigonus and Queen Phila and their descendents. And since the priestess of Aglauros sacrificed the inaugural sacrifices (eisagogeia) and the sacrifices “appropriate” to (προσήκουσαι) her, and she oversaw also the good order in the all-night festival (pannychis), and she adorned the table, it is resolved to praise the priestess of Aglauros, Timocrite, daughter of Polynices, whose deme is Aphidna, and to crown her with a crown of olive because of her proper respect (εὐσέβεια) towards the gods. And the grammateus for the prytany is to inscribe this decree on a stone"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 5Introductionstele and to erect it in the sanctuary (ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ) of Aglauros, and for the inscription of the stele the officials overseeing the budget are to dispense the cost that has occurred.4The BouleThe DemosThe priestess TimocriteThis rich and unusually complete text, excavated on the east slope of the Acropolis and first published in 1969, offers abundant material for study: the year and calendrical date, the procedures of the Boule and Ekklesia, the find spot of the inscription and the site of the sanctuary of Aglauros (which has major historical implications for the assault of the Persians on the Acropolis in 480 BC), the family of Timocrite, the role of a priestess, the inclusion of King Antigonus Gonatas and his wife, the eisiteteria and the ephebes for whom they were probably performed, and the divine recipients of the various sacrifices.5 My interests in this book, however, are directed elsewhere.In these texts priests, priestesses like Timocrite, and many other individuals and groups numerous times are praised εὐσεβείας ἕνεκα καὶ φιλοτιμίας (“because of their proper respect and love of honor”). Timocrite is so praised, εὐσεβείας ἕνεκα, but why, we might ask, is there no mention of her φιλοτιμία? Sacrifices are regularly made, as here, ἐπὶ τῇ ὑγιείᾳ καὶ σωτηρίᾳ or ὑπὲρ τῆς ὑγιείας καὶ σωτηρίας (“for the health and safety”) of the Boule and the Demos and others. The Boule and Demos regularly “accept τὰ ἀγαθά (‘the good things’)” that were reported to them concerning these sacrifices. And there are certain sacrifices that are “appropriate” (καθήκουσαι, or, as here, προσήκουσαι) for certain offi-cials. Not in Timocrite’s decree, but very, very often elsewhere, the honorand is praised for sacrificing καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς (“beautifully and in manner showing proper respect”) or καλῶς καὶ φιλοτίμως (“beautifully and in a manner showing love of honor”). Remarkably, though, these highly formulaic phrases καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς, καλῶς καὶ φιλοτίμως, εὐσεβείας ἕνεκα καὶ φιλοτιμίας, ἐπὶ τῇ ὑγιείᾳ καὶ 4 In this text and throughout the Introduction I use some translations for terms that will be argued for later.5 On this text, see Mikalson, 1998.164–6; on find spot, Dontas, 1983; on family, Lambert, 2012.77 and 2012a.235; on Antigonus and on divine beneficiaries, Parker, 2005.434 n. 64 and Mikalson, 1998.160–66; and on the eisiteteria and eisagogeia, Chaniotis, 2005.45–6 and Parker, 2005.434 n. 64."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"6Introductionσωτηρίᾳ, ὑπὲρ τῆς ὑγιείας καὶ σωτηρίας, θυσίαι καθηκοῦσαι, and the formula for accepting the reports of τὰ ἀγαθά occur nowhere else in the corpus of classical and Hellenistic Greek literature.6 τὰ ἱερά are regularly reported in prose and poetic sources as being καλά (“beautiful”), but only in the inscriptions, with one special exception, are they reported as σωτήρια (“providing safety”). And the common purpose of sacrificial activity as given in the inscriptions, ὅπως ἂν ἔχῃ καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς . . . τὰ πρὸς τοὺς θεούς (“so that the things relating to the gods may be beautiful and showing proper respect”),7 and its slight variants, occurs only once, in the same exceptional source, in the prose literature.8 All of this suggests that inscriptions like the Timocrite decree may be a unique source, another voice for the religious concepts and beliefs of their period and even of the earlier, classical period. If that is so, then we may also find in them and in other similar contemporary inscriptions valuable information about a number of religious matters: on what, for example, makes a good sacrifice or a good priest or priestess, what characterizes a good heorte, what are the prized religious behaviors, what individual authorities lie behind individual practices, in which cults and practices does the polis show an interest and oversight, who is sacrificing to whom, and who is paying the costs. These and similar mat-ters, some of which arise in the Timocrite decree, are rarely if ever treated in the literary sources and therefore have not received much scholarly attention. Finally, the answers to the various religious questions suggested by these texts can then be compared to the much scantier discussions of them in the literary sources from both the classical and Hellenistic periods. Are these epigraphical texts merely making explicit some widely accepted but unexpressed concepts and beliefs of earlier times, or have there been some changes in outlook?The number and formulaic character of many of these texts have limited the interest of religious scholars in their content.9 Viewed negatively, the for-mulae associated with religious and other activities in texts like the Timocrite 6 For ὑπὲρ τῆς ὑγιείας καὶ σωτηρίας the closest parallels are the prayers in Ar. Av. 878–9, Is. 8.16, and Menander, Kolax, frag. 1. The last is that all the Olympian gods and goddesses διδόναι σωτηρίαν, ὑγίειαν, ἀγαθὰ πολλά, τῶν ὄντων τε νῦν ἀγαθῶν ὄνησιν πᾶσι, clearly not yet formulaic.7 This serves to correct my translation of this phrase as “so that the relations to the gods may be good and pious,” as in 1998.114. For reasons discussed above, neither “good” nor “pious” is correct.8 For Demosthenes, Prooemium 54 being a pastiche of epigraphical formulae, see Appendix 1.9 They are not, for example, included in the most recent (Taylor, 2015) description of the epi-graphical materials contributing to the study of Greek religion. Apart from a survey Taylor offers a good summary of the current concerns with the theoretical problems (and possibili-ties) of using epigraphical material for understanding Greek religion."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 7Introductiondecree could be thought “banal” and mere vestiges of once alive ideas, and could be passed over quickly, as, I admit, I have usually done.10 Viewed posi-tively, however, they reflect deep seated and fundamental religious concepts of the society and times in which they were used, formulaic because they were familiar and accepted by all.11 Also, if we view these formulae positively, as I now wish to do, we can ask, which is rarely done, what they mean. It has not, for example, been systematically studied what it means to sacrifice καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς” or what are τὰ ἀγαθά that are being reported. What are, as another example, τὰ ἱερά that are καλά? What does καλά mean in this context? Also, if we view them positively, we can ask if these formulae are used randomly as it might superficially appear. Are all religious acts praised for being per-formed εὐσεβῶς, or only certain ones? Is it a throw-away phrase to say that the sacrifices were performed “according to ancestral customs” (κατὰ τὰ πάτρια), or “according to the laws” (κατὰ τοὺς νόμους), or were real distinctions being made? If so, what are they? And, if we take these formulae seriously, we can search for their antecedents in wording or in concept in earlier, classical times and ask if we are finding continuities or discontinuities from the classical to the Hellenistic period. Finally, these texts provide considerably more and new data for currently debated questions of the nature and extent of polis author-ity over the religious cults of Athens. I treat these texts not so much for their own sake, which would be worthwhile in itself, but as another source for better understanding popular, practiced Athenian religion of the time.The general nature, formal aspects, and history of these “honorary” (or “honorific”) inscriptions are well described in McLean, 2002.228–245. Veligianni-Terzi (1997) and Henry (1996 and 1983) offer valuable studies of their language and formulae. All who work with these texts are much indebted to Stephen Lambert who has reedited many of them for IG II3 and has written 10 Hence arose various errors in my Religion in Hellenistic Athens (1998), errors which I will note in the following pages.11 Cf. Whitehead, 1983.60–1: “The language of Athenian honorific decrees—of the boule and ekklesia, of the demes and tribes, and of para-political organizations which copied official practice—is a subject which repays more attention than it is usually given. The temptation is to dismiss most of it as cliché: succinct, businesslike formulas (for the most part) in the fifth century, moving to ever more elaborate and verbose formulas in the fourth century and beyond. Yet topoi, by their very nature, embody valuable information.” And, p. 68, “I have emphasised the rôle played in this by honorific decrees because, on this as on other topics, they are an oddly undervalued source of information and insight; certainly they have as much to offer the historian as he can learn, of the communal mentality, from many literary genres.” For more of the same, see Whitehead, 1993. Cf. Mikalson, 1998.114."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"8Introductioncareful and detailed studies concerning those and others, as the numerous references in my text and entries in the bibliography will attest. Some of these texts have been used for over a century to establish Athenian prosopography and chronology and to refine our knowledge of Athenian political and reli-gious institutions. More recently they have come to the fore as a specific genre in studies of the general Athenian inclination, after mid-IV BC, to honor fellow citizens for a wide range of activities, as in Meyer, 2013, Lambert, 2011, Luraghi, 2010, Mikalson, 1998.310–11, and Hakkarainen, 1997.12 The honorary inscriptions of the demes have been illuminated by Lasagna, 2004, Jones, 2004.78–85, and Whitehead, 1986. Arnaoutoglou (2003) offers valuable material on those of pri-vate associations. In terms of these texts themselves, I hope to offer improved understanding of the meaning and context of several of the Greek phrases and formulae associated with religious activities.My colleague Elizabeth Meyer, an expert on the Athenian “epigraphical habit,” has stressed to me some of the dangers in relying so heavily on inscrip-tions. The honorific inscriptions, nomoi, and psephismata are genres unto themselves, each with its own, sometimes changing habits of what to include and what not to include. Can we conclude that only what we find on these inscriptions was done or was considered praiseworthy in a religious context in Athenian society of the time? No, of course not. There is a vast amount we do not know. But for most of III, II, and I BC the inscriptions are pretty much all we have. I have searched out other sources and included them, but they are few. In defense of the inscriptions, however, I would point out that they are very numerous for all these periods, they are contemporary to what they describe, they treat a wide range of topics, they are remarkably con-sistent from the beginning to the end of my period, and, although they were edited and perhaps manipulated for a variety of purposes,13 they are not subject to “poetic” elaboration.14 When we have both literary and epigraphical sources, as for much of IV BC, the evidence from inscriptions also correlates remark-ably well with what we find in the surviving writings, especially of the orators. I recognize that epigraphical conventions, frequency, and distribution could and sometimes did change over time, but these changes in the various genres of inscriptions have not yet been sufficiently determined to apply to this study. 12 For earlier studies see also Graf, 1995, Habicht, 1995, Whitehead, 1993, Hansen, 1987.114–15 and 123, and Gauthier, 1985.13 See, e.g., Taylor, 2015, Meyer, 2013 and Osborne, 1999.14 Here, perhaps, it is appropriate to recall the “habit” planted in K. J. Dover by R. Meiggs, “on any question in Greek history or the Greek language, go first to the inscriptions and only after that to literature” (Dover, 1994.59)."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 9IntroductionAs a corollary to all this, arguments ex silentio (from what is not said or attested in our sources) are always dangerous, and I introduce them sparingly, but, to give one example, when we have five Delphic oracles on religious matters attested in epigraphical and literary sources from VI BC, ten from V BC, and six from IV BC, but none from III, II, or I BC,15 is it more reasonable to con-clude that the Athenians were, after IV BC rarely if ever consulting the Oracle on such matters, or that unidentified changing epigraphical habits meant that such consultations were no longer reported? In short, the surviving evidence offers far less than what we would like, but the inscriptions are what we have, and I hope to contribute to the effort to interpret them correctly.In much broader terms I use these texts as an entrée point for investigating various topics about Athenian religion: who was sacrificing on behalf of the polis, who was paying the costs for religious activities, and what in these activi-ties specifically was praised and in what terms. On the first question Parker (2005.89–104) has much of value and I hope to expand upon and refine his conclusions. On the second question, the consensus opinion has developed that, as we move through the Hellenistic period, the costs of polis cult were more and more being covered by wealthy individuals until virtually all costs were paid by them (Lambert, 2012, Hakkarainen, 1997, Parker, 1996.268–70). Priests (Naiden, 2013.216) and ephebes (Deshours, 2011.174, 177, and 310 and Perrin-Saminadayar, 2007.257–9), as examples, are claimed now themselves to be financing the sacrifices they performed. This would be a fundamental change in the nature of Athenian polis religion. I will question this consen-sus, largely by looking more carefully for explicit indications of individuals’ financial contributions and by specifying which elements of polis (and other) religious activities they involved. The final questions, what was being praised and in what terms, have not been ventured in quite this form before, and I trust the investigation will contribute to our understanding of what was valued in religious activities in this period and for what reasons. From this investigation emerge two new aspects of public religion in Athens. Very recently Fred Naiden (2015, 2013) has noted the importance of “beauty” in sacrifice, and Angelos Chaniotis (2013) describes it for pompai. Through the honorific inscriptions and through other inscriptions and prose texts, I discov-ered that “beauty” was a desideratum and a laudandum for Athenian religion not only in sacrifices and pompai but virtually everywhere. When participants, sanctuaries, all elements of sacrifices, heortai, pompai, pannychides, and sanc-tuaries, altars, and dedications are described, there is a pervasive concern with their visual “beauty,” and this esthetic is, I think, a significant new aspect of 15 See Chapters 10 and 11."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"10IntroductionGreek religion.16 I focus on the Athenian context, but it can be found through-out the Greek world, and due appreciation of that will require another book. In addition, a new social aspect of Greek religion emerges from these texts. In performing public religious actions, individuals were concerned to please both the gods and their peers and were praised simultaneously for both. This social dimension, pleasing one’s peers, has not been marked out before as an element of Greek religious activity.In three areas I deviate significantly from current trends in scholarship on Greek religion: in the emphasis on the “embeddedness” of religion in Athenian life; on the extent of polis control of religion within its borders; and on the devaluation of the individual polis as an object of study. It has become fash-ionable to claim that religion was “embedded” in all aspects of Athenian (or Greek) life.17 I tend to doubt this claim, especially the “all” part. The Athenians clearly distinguished, in their terms, τὰ ἱερά from τὰ ὅσια, “the sacred” from “the profane,”18 and, I would dare assert, it is precisely this distinction that allowed much of what we value, including tragedy, comedy, philosophy, and several of the democratic institutions to flourish in Athens. The Athenians and ancient Greeks in general were not as inhibited by restrictions arising from religion, by 16 Recent studies of “visuality” of rituals, heortai, statues, and such in Greek religion concern a quite different matter. They distinguish “religious visuality” from “esthetic visuality” (to use the terms of Kindt). They treat only superficially, if at all, the “esthetic visuality” in Greek religion, usually dismissing it as an “artistic experience” separate from the “reli-gious experience.” I have come to think of “esthetic visuality,” too, as part of the “religious experience” as I will set out in Chapter 13. For current “visuality” approaches, see, e.g., Scheer, 2015 (on statuary, with extensive bibliography), Rutherford, 2013.142–8 (on theo-riai), and Kindt, 2012, esp. 36–54 (on theory).17 Since Robert Parker introduced the term “embedded” into the study of Greek religion (1986.295–6), it has thrived and appears in most general and many detailed studies of both Greek and Roman religion. And it has become a subject in its own right. Nongbri (2008) faults the idea of “embeddedness of religion” (particularly in Roman religion, but equally relevant to Greek religion) because it presumes that there was a distinct entity we, redistributively, call “religion.” Eidenow (2015) faults the limitations on the term as employed by previous scholars for “whom there is little consideration of what we might call cognitive processes of transmission, reflection, and experience, or the co-creation of religious ritual.” She offers a “new formulation of ‘embeddedness’ ” which she expects “may lead to a reconceptualization of Greek religion.” Parker limited the term initially to a social context, but others use it (as Bremmer, 1994.2–4 and Bonnechere in 2013.366–8) to suggest that religion permeated all aspects of Greek life, and it is in that sense that I question it.18 On this use of these terms, see Appendix 4."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 11Introductionτὰ ἱερά, as have been so many other ancient and modern societies. Were there gods and goddesses, prayers and sacrifices in tragedy, comedy, and philoso-phy? Of course. And if we include under “religion” every mention of a god or a goddess or a prayer, then “religion” does permeate all Greek art and literature. But if we mean by “religion” the gods and goddesses and heroes for whom the Athenians built altars and sanctuaries and to whom they actually sacrificed and prayed, and the beliefs, rituals, and practices associated with these deities, the picture becomes quite different. The inscriptions and this book deal, much like my Ancient Greek Religion, only with the latter, perhaps limited, concept of “religion.”From the inscriptions and other sources I hope to draw indications of the degree to which and the areas in which the Athenian polis, as an institution, involved itself in the everyday religious life of its citizens and foreign resi-dents. I investigate what “authority” the civil institutions and personnel had, and more importantly what “authority” they exercised, in intra-polis religious matters. Here I build upon the excellent studies of Robert Garland (1984 and 1990) and challenge those who since then have claimed a much wider involve-ment of polis “control” of religion within its boundaries (Sourvinou-Inwood, 1990.302, Rhodes, 2009.13, Horster, 2010.179).Robert Parker (especially 1995 and 2005) has made major contributions to describing and interpreting “religion” in the archaic and classical polis of Athens, and I (1998) attempted to shed some light on “religion” in Hellenistic Athens, in particular to delineate ways it showed continuity with or change from its classical heritage. I focus again, and unapologetically, this study on the polis Athens. The polis has long been recognized, and more so since Sourvinou-Inwood (1988, 1990) articulated it, as a (or “the”) major organizing structure of Greek religion. Each polis had, to greater or lesser degrees, its own pantheon, including gods and heroes, religious calendar, mythological and historical reli-gious traditions, structure of bureaucracy tending to religious matters, and so forth. These elements differed significantly from, say, Athens to Sparta or to Corinth. What an individual Greek worshipper did and experienced in his everyday religious life was determined in good part by the polis into which he or she happened to have been born. Many elements, including especially sacrifice and prayer and the generic names of the gods, can be found in all of them, but sometimes in differing forms. Some scholars prefer to study religion “within” the polis, some “beyond” the polis, some at the deme level, some at the family level, some at the individual level, some in inscriptions, some through archaeology or literature or philosophy or history or art, and others through a wide range or combination of media. All such studies, done well, are per-fectly valid and age well and contribute to our efforts to understand the Greek"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"12Introductionreligious experience. Greek religion is multi-faceted, and we should embrace and attempt to understand each facet, whether it be our facet or not. Preliminary RemarksThe distinction between “public” and “private” cults has long been considered inadequate, and for the purposes of this study I distinguish between 1) polis cults, whose deities were worshipped by and were thought to benefit the polis as a whole;19 2) tribal cults, for each of the ten (or eleven or twelve or thirteen, depending on the period) tribes for its eponymous hero; 3) deme cults, whose deities were worshipped by and administered by demesmen of the 139 individ-ual demes or a small consortium of them; 4) phratry cults, for worship by each individual phratry; 5) gentilic cults, whose membership included the members of one genos, i.e., an extended family claiming one, often heroic, ancestor;20 6) oikos cults of the individual households (oikoi); 7) private cults made up of citizen members; 8) private cults made up exclusively of non-citizens; and 9) private cults with both citizen and non-citizen membership. Some deme cults were for the local worship of deities also worshipped in polis cults, and 19 In an excellent study Lambert (2010, esp. 143–149) proposes criteria for determining polis cults and examines the complexities, of which there are many, of doing so. His nine criteria are: public funding; responsibility for physical property of the deity, including sanctuaries, dedications, and leases; priest or priestess having proedria in the Theater of Dionysus; the priest or priestess receiving a salary from the polis; sacrifices or dedications by polis officials or on the initiative of the polis; use of cult location as a meeting place by the Ekklesia; laws or decrees of the polis regulating the cult; decrees of the Boule and/or Ekklesia honoring priests or other cult officials; and importance to the community as a whole in terms of breadth of interest and participation in the cult. Not all criteria exist or apply for any one cult, and often one criterion is sufficient. For brief, precise, and excel-lent discussions of “public” vs. “private” cult in Athens, see also Deshours, 2011.19–22 and Aleshire, 1994. On some of these criteria for deme cults, see Whitehead, 1986.178, and on the complexity of cult activity in the demes Parker, 2005.62–78. According to Harpocration (s.v. δημοτελῆ), δημοτελής distinguishes “polis” sanctuaries from “other” sanctuaries (ἱερά),” those of orgeones, of gene and, apparently, of the demes (δημοτικά). So, too, in the literary sources δημοτελής is used of sanctuaries ([Dem.] 59.85, Aeschin. 1.183 and 3.176), of θυσίαι (Pl. Leg. 11.935b6 and Hdt. 6.57.1), and, when the point to be made is that they were of the polis as a whole, of heortai (Thuc. 2.15.3 and Philochorus FGrHist 328 F 168). δημοτελής does not occur in the inscriptions, but a few, early instances of δημόσιος seemingly bear the same meaning (IG I3 35.11–12, 136.32, and 255b17).20 On gene in a cult context, see Lambert, 2010.148–52, Blok and Lambert, 2009, and Parker, 1996.284–327."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 13Introductionsome polis cults derived from deme or local cults, as that at the Eleusinion adjoining the Agora and as that of Artemis Brauronia on the Acropolis. The membership of all these types of cults might have been all male, all female, or males and females together, depending on the deity and nature of the cult. To these common cults of the various groups we should add the exceptional cases such as, for example, (10) cults apparently established by individuals, as that of Artemis Aristoboule by Themistocles and that of the Muses by Plato.21I have used “polis” as both a noun and adjective for the more common “state,” with, e.g., “the Athenian polis” for “the Athenian state” and “polis sacri-fices” for “state sacrifices.” I do this to distinguish, as above, polis activities from those of other units and to keep in the foreground that Athens was a particular type of state, i.e., a polis.Significant parts of this study depend on the meanings of certain Greek words and short phrases, and establishing the meaning for many of them is one purpose of this book. Sometimes, especially for terms like εὐσέβεια and ὁσιότης and their cognates, for καλός and ἀγαθός, and for φιλοτιμία there are no simple, convenient translations. The meanings of these terms and phrases in religious contexts will, I hope, become clear (or clearer) in the following pages, but for consistency’s sake I maintain the Greek words and phrases, almost always less verbose and always better than an English translation when dis-cussing Greek religion. I use transliterations only rarely and reluctantly. The Greekless readers who find their way here need not despair, however. I present my translations of the critical and most common Greek words in the Glossary of Greek Terms. A great many officials are praised for their religious actions, among them eponymous archons, basileis, strategoi, polemarchs, hipparchs, demarchs, hieropoioi, epimeletai, and boönai. I offer a Glossary of officials and of some other Greek words requiring some clarification.For my purposes here I treat only classical and Hellenistic texts, with rare excursions into the archaic period. I put the break between the archaic and classical at 510 BC, between the classical and the Hellenistic at the death of Alexander the Great in 323/2 BC, and, in the context of Athenian religion, the break between the Hellenistic and Roman periods at the sack of Athens by the Roman general Sulla in 86 BC.22 Athens and Athenian religion became significantly different after 86 BC, I think, and I do not venture into the Roman period which deserves more and separate study by those more appreciative of the Roman influence on Athenian society and religion. By literary sources 21 On these divisions in general, see Aleshire, 1994.10–11. On Artemis Aristoboule, see Mikalson, 2003.103 and 127 and 1998.35.

Usually the historians and orators offer the best antecedents and parallels to texts and concepts I consider, but occasionally I broaden the search to philosophical and poetic authors.Many of the inscriptions can be dated precisely by the name of the epony-mous archon.23 If the archon’s year is in dispute or if his name is missing, other data from the text or the letter forms usually allow proposing a date, either to a span of years, e.g. 325–287, or to a whole or part of a century, e.g. IV BC, or first quarter of III BC. I give dates for all texts, following recent scholars’ views and indicating with a question mark when there is uncertainty. Even within the historical periods dates are important because we can expect and may find changes over time, from, say, the first decree honoring the priest of Asclepius in 328/7 to the last in 137/6, a period of nearly 200 years. Scholars have claimed some such changes, I have found others, and the inclusion of dates for texts will allow others to evaluate these or to find more.24Most of these inscriptions are, to some degree, incomplete, missing letters, words, lines, or whole sections. Many of these losses have been restored by scholars, and these restorations are sometimes absolutely secure, sometimes not. To those familiar with epigraphical texts, I may seem too conservative in accepting restorations, to those not familiar with them too liberal. I accept those restorations that appear correct to me.25 I indicate restored portions in these texts with the conventional square brackets [ ]. Angular brackets < > indi-cate editors’ additions of letters not present on the stone. In my translations, as in the Timocrite decree, parentheses ( ) indicate additions I have made to complete the sense.For literary authors and texts I use mostly the abbreviations of the Oxford Classical Dictionary, fourth edition. The epigraphical texts have almost all been published several times, and I attempt to identify each by its most recent or best edition. For these references, see the Abbreviations section. Occasionally the most convenient text is in Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum (SEG), as for the Timocrite decree, and I use that when possible. Each text has its own bibliographical history, sometimes quite long. I give only bibliography relevant to the topic at hand. For some texts background is more necessary, 23 For the chronologically difficult years of 300/299–228/7 I follow the archon list of Osborne, 2009 as adopted for IG II3.24 The value of such diachronic work is amply demonstrated by Shear’s (2001) study of the Panathenaia.25 In general terms and in terms of restorations, I have tried to follow the principle epigram-matically stated by Whitehead, 1993.51: “certainties first, conjecture later.”"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 15Introductionand for them I give a fuller bibliography at the most extensive treatment of the text. These extended bibliographies are indicated by italicized page numbers in the Index of Inscriptions. I do not include bibliography for each deity, cult, heorte, official, or other item not essential to my purposes.26 The material to be covered, textual and bibliographic, to say nothing of all the newly appearing writings on Greek religion, is immense, and it would be hybristic to claim that I have found everything relevant to all my discussions.27 I do hope, however, to have provided sufficient and representative material to support the arguments and claims I make.The laws of Solon, including his religious calendar, appear in discussions frequently, especially in regard to τὰ πάτρια and the nomoi of the Athenians on religious matters. There is considerable disagreement and dispute about which of the laws attributed to Solon were really his or were remodelings of his or even completely fabricated attributions.28 For our purposes what is important is that certain laws, often associated with τὰ πάτρια, were claimed or believed, from the fifth century BC on, to be Solon’s, and in a study of religious matters we are here, as often, more concerned with what was believed than with what was, if it can be determined, factual. And so in this study we accept, although fully recognizing the possible difficulties, what are claimed in the fifth century and later to be the laws of Solon on religious matters.The use of literally hundreds of texts allows us to recognize relatively easily individual texts that are idiosyncratic and that may mislead us in various ways. Two such epigraphical texts are SEG 21.469C of 129/8 which reorganizes, revives, and enhances various cults of Apollo, and the texts recording prepara-tions and financing for the Pythaïs, the theoria to Delphi, from 103/2–97/6.29 In these documents roles and financial contributions are assigned to govern-ment officials and priests that are found nowhere else in our sources and that often contradict what appears in numerous other sources. Each records what appear to be several short-lived innovations of its own time and is valuable in other ways. Each will be treated here, but not all the details of each should 26 Parker (1996 and 2005) offers abundant information and sources for Athenian deities and cults.

Such qual-ifiers of sacrifice and other religious activities are very rare in the literary texts,1 and most interestingly the most common formulae used in the epigraphical texts do not occur at all in the literary texts. The epigraphical texts thus offer a new look at what the Athenians, at least in the Hellenistic period, thought to be the proper and commendable performance of sacrifices and other religious activities. Sacrifice The Act of Sacrificeκαλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς (“beautifully and in a way showing proper respect”)2The phrase καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς, which does not occur in classical or Hellenistic Greek literature, is used in inscriptions almost exclusively to praise those who actually performed sacrifices: an archon, agonothetai, prytaneis, hipparch, a priest of Asclepius, and a priestess of the Thesmophoroi at Melite.3 Only once is an official, appointed “for the (financial) administration of the 1 They do not occur, for example, in the fullest descriptions of sacrifices we have in the liter-ary sources, as in Hom.

This, if properly restored, is the earliest (ca. 336–324) attestation of the phrase. The next is from 282/1.The import of the phrase is suggested by three texts using the same formula, that is, that sacrifices have been made or are to be made ὅπως ἂν ἔχῃ καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς . . .τὰ πρὸς τοὺς θεούς (“So that the things relating to the gods may be beautiful and showing proper respect”).7 A late and unusually discursive text (SEG 21.469C.18–20 of 129/8) offers even more: the Boule and Demos are “to increase both the sacrifices and the honors καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς so that they may acquire from the gods the deserved return favors.”8These texts offer, in essence, related reasons why it was deemed important to sacrifice καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς.9 And, Aristotle (Rh. 1383b4–6) tells us, it contrib-utes to humans’ θάρσος, “courage, the opposite of fear,” “if the things relating to the gods are beautiful (or good) (καλῶς) for them, both the other things and the things from omens and oracles.”10 Here we may include sacrifices under “the other things.”4 [ἐ]πὶ τῇ διοι[κήσει τ]ῆς πόλεως.5 For the term ἐμέρισεν, see Eide, 1984.6 Agora 16.77.7–11.7 Prytaneis, Agora 15.89.13–15 of 259/8; Thracian orgeones of Bendis, IG II2 1283.22–27 of 261/0; and demarch of Rhamnous, I.

The more common phrase in literature is ἐν τοῖς προσήκουσι χρόνοις, as in Plato, Lg. 7.835b2–3 and Theopompus, FGrHist 115 F 344.21–2. Summary for Act of SacrificeThe commendation of the agonothetes of 252/1 (IG II2 780.12–15) offers the fullest description of these various elements that attended sacrifices:Since the agonothetes, making proper respect (εὐσέβειαν) towards the gods of the highest importance and showing the goodwill (εὔνοιαν)17 and love of honor (φιλοτιμίαν) which he has towards the Demos of Athenians, sacrificed all the ancestral sacrifices at the appropriate times beautifully and with proper respect (καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς). . . .18The sacrifices were made καλῶς and εὐσεβῶς at the appropriate times. The εὐσέβεια is directed to the gods and is that which the agonothetes makes of the most importance. The εὔνοια and φιλοτιμία are directed to fellow Athenians.19Finally, it should be noted that a sacrifice to Demetrius Poliorcetes is to be made ὡς σεμνότατα καὶ κάλλιστα (SEG 25.149.17–18 of ca. 302), completely at variance from the usual formula and with εὐσεβῶς replaced by a less charged 16 Kosmetai of ephebes, IG II2 1008.59 of 118/7, 1011.39–40 of 106/5; of agonothetes, IG II2 780.14–15 of 252/1; of epimeletai, IG II3 1329.8–10 of 173/2. The prytaneis of 234/3 sacrificed to the Soteres ἐν τ[αῖ]ς καθηκούσαις ἡμέραις (“on the appropriate days”) (Agora 15.115.12–13), and the proeranistra of the koinon of the Sarapiastae in 215/4 sacrificed ἐν το[ῖς] χρόνοις το[ῖς τεταγμ]ένοις (“at the assigned times”) (IG II2 1292.22–5).17 This is the “more formalized version of εὔνοια that manifests goodwill through actions that benefit Athens, such as military aid, the ransoming of prisoners of war, the supply-ing of grain” (Cook, 2009.37). In polis decrees it is used, as here, of other agonothetai, IG II2 956.30–1 and 958.26, but not of those performing other religious duties. Possible exceptions are Agora 16.214.17–18 and IG II2 677.12.

Here is perhaps a distinction between the cult of gods and heroes and that of rulers. “Service” (λειτουργία) at SacrificesIn 127/6 the ephebes and their kosmetes separately were commended because they served (ἐλειτούργησαν) εὐσεβῶς καὶ φιλοτίμως in all the sacrifices, leaving out nothing of the necessary things (οὐθὲν ἐνλείποντες τῶν ἀναγκαίων).20 One such service may well have been the “liftings of the cows” (ἄρσεις τῶν βοῶν) required at some sacrifices.21 In 122/1 the kosmetes of the ephebes is praised for having done this ἐπάνδρως (“in a manly way”) in sacrifices at Eleusis, surely at the Mysteries, and at the Proerosia and other sacrifices,22 and the ephebes themselves are regularly praised for doing it “with good form” (εὐσχημόνως), usually in sacrifices at the Mysteries.23 Τhey also performed this service 20 SEG 15.104.19–20 and 86–7. Cf. IG II3 1166.11 of 213/2 and Perrin-Saminadayar, 2007.222–6, T30.61–3 of 116/5.21 As in IG II3 1176.11 of 203/2, 1256.9 and 14–15 of 196/5 and 1313.9–10 of 176/5 and 90–1 of 175/4. On the nature of this action as part of the ritual for some sacrifices, see Deshours, 2011.174 and Van Straten, 1995.109–13. Some take the ἐλειτούργησαν of these ephebic texts to indicate that the ephebes as a group “paid for” the sacrificial victims they sacrificed (Perrin-Saminadayar, 2007.257 and Lambert, 2012.82). Such is the usual implication of a liturgy, but not here, I think. In Perrin-Saminadayar, 2007.222–6, T30.61–3, when the kos-metes paid for the sacrifices, it is explicitly said to be ἐκ τῶν ἰδίων, and that is distinct from the following item, that he performed his liturgy εὐσεβῶς καὶ φιλοτίμως. λειτουργία can sometimes mean simply “service,” without personal financial con-tributions, as in, e.g., Dem. 21.56 and Arist. Pol. 3.1278a12 and 1279a11, 4.1291a35–7, and 7.1335b28. It has its more familiar meaning in Arist. Pol. 5.1305a5, 1309a18, and 1314b14, and 6.1320b4 and 1321a33, and may be either in 2.1272a20, 4.1291a35, and 7.1330a13. See, also, Lewis, 1960 and 1965. One could perform a liturgy with the body as well as with property, and they are sometimes contrasted (Ath. Pol. 29.5, Lys. 19.58 and 31.15, Dem. 10.28 and 21.165). This leads me to conclude that the liturgy of the ephebes concerned a “service,” not money or victims, that they provided, with their bodies, at some sacri-fices, as, e.g., the ἄρσεις τῶν βοῶν at the Mysteries, and in a pompe (as in IG II3 1256.8–9) for which the adverbial modifiers are more appropriate. I belabor this here because it becomes important later in determining who pays for what in the Hellenistic period.22 Perrin-Saminadayar, 2007.206–12, T26.78–9. Cf. restoration of IG I3 82.29. What is prob-ably meant here is not that the kosmetes did the ἄρσις himself, but that, as said explicitly in IG II3 1313.90–1, “He took care that at the Great Mysteries the ephebes made the ‘lifting of the cows’ through their own efforts” (ἐφρόντισεν ὅπως τοῖς μεγάλοις Μυστηρίοις τὴν τῶν βοῶν ἄρσιν οἱ ἔφηβοι [ποιή]σωνται δι ̓ ἑαυτῶν).23 IG II2 1008.11–12 of 118/7, Hesp.

The ephebes also performed another such service in the performance of pompai.25 Finally, the ephebes once “served” the Semnai ἀνεγκλήτως (“in a blameless manner”), the only example of this adverb in a religious context.26 Supervising (ἐπιμελεῖσθαι) SacrificesIndividuals, epimeletai, especially of private associations, who “supervised” (ἐπιμελεῖσθαι) sacrifices might be commended for having done their work καλῶς καὶ φιλοτίμως, but only when they supervised both sacrifices and other activities or affairs, some secular, of the group.27 When they are not praised for their εὐσέβεια, it should be assumed that these individuals did not them-selves perform the sacrifices.

The tamias of Acharnai together with the demarch supervised (ἐπεμελήθη) the deme’s Dionysia καλῶς καὶ φιλοτίμως as they did the components of the heortai: the sacrifice, pompe, and agones. So, too, the epimeletai of Amphiaraus’ heorte supervised καλῶς καὶ φιλοτίμως the pompe, agones, and all the other matters concerning the panegyris. The Boule of 343/2 supervised καλῶς the “good order” ([εὐκοσμίας]) concerning the heorte of Dionysus.32 The demarch of Ikarion in the mid-fourth century “made” the heorte for Dionysus καλῶς καὶ δικαίως, and the demesmen of Ionidai and Kydantidai commend their kolokratai and priest of Heracles for having supervised their Herakleia καλῶς καὶ φιλοτίμως and praise them also δικαιοσύνης ἕνεκα καὶ φιλοτιμίας. In these two cases δικαιοσύνη (“honesty”) is included no doubt because administration of money was also involved.33Of a different type is the Athenian praise of Milesians who came to Athens on a theoria sometime in the years 180–160. The archetheoros and his fel-low theoroi are praised “because of their εὐσέβεια towards the gods and their ἀρετή (“virtue”) and φιλοτιμία towards the Demos of Athenians and their own fatherland,”34 and they are awarded citizenship. They in all likelihood sacri-ficed in Athens as part of their theoria. Differently phrased but reflecting much the same thing is the Athenian praise of ambassadors sent from Priene ca. 200 to the quadrennial Panathenaia. They “wished to increase the honors (τιμάς) being performed for the gods by the (Athenian) Demos.”3530 Panathenaia, IG II3 447.29–33 of ca. 335–330; Dionysia of Aixone, SEG 36.186.12–13 of 313/2; Dionysia of Eleusis, I.

The residents of Salamis honor three individuals who have supervised the repair καλῶς καὶ δικαίως, and they are to be rewarded with crowns of ivy “because of their εὐσέβεια and good-ness (καλοκαγαθία) towards the gods” (6–10).72 The names and contributions of these contributors to the project are to be recorded, “so that, with these things being completed, the things relating to the gods may be καλῶς and εὐσεβῶς for the Demos of the Salaminioi” (14–15).73 The priest of Apollo at Halai Aixonides repaired the sanctuary [λί]αν φιλοτίμ[ω]ς.74 In 269/8 a strategos repaired the sanctuary of Nemesis at Rhamnous, “so that it might be in honor and it might be καλῶς and εὐσεβῶς for the demesmen.”75 What is to be “in honor” is no doubt the sanctuary or the goddess, not the strategos. Another strategos at Rhamnous in the last quarter of III BC gave land to soldiers to build a sanctu-ary of Sarapis and Isis, and in so doing he was “making εὐσέβεια towards the gods of most importance and also goodwill and φιλοτιμία towards his fellow citizens.”76 Members of a thiasos of Ammon in 263/2 in an addition to the sanc-tuary performed work that was “beautiful and worthy of the god (καλὸν καὶ [ἄ]ξιο[ν τ]οῦ [θε]οῦ)῝ and supervised it [καλῶς καὶ φ]ι[λ]οτίμως.”77 One member of the thiasos of the cult of the Mother of the Gods supervised κα[λω]ς καὶ φιλοτίμως the building of an oikos.78 Altars were, of course, the essential part of a 71 [ὅπ]ω[ς] ἂ[ν] ὡς εὐσεβέστατα ἔχει τὰ πρὸς τὼ θεὼ [καὶ μηδέποτ ̓ εἰς τὸν λοιπ]ὸ[ν] χρόνον μηδὲν ἀσεβὲς γίγνητ[αι περὶ τῆς ἱερᾶς] ὀ[ργάδος καὶ] περὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἱερῶν τῶν ̓Αθ[ήνησιν].

Sosandrus was commended for his con-tributions to the “adornment” of gymnasia and sanctuaries, which he did “with no excuses, lacking nothing of seriousness (σπουδή) or of φιλοτιμία.” For this he was crowned “because of his εὐσέβεια and technical skill (φιλοτεχνία) concern-ing the sanctuary and his good will (εὔνοια) towards the Demos of Athenians.”82 About 325 the Eumolpidae honor an individual who supervised the sanctuar-ies φι[λοτίμως καὶ εὐσεβῶ]ς and “adorned” the sanctuary of Plouton [καλῶς]. He was crowned “because of his εὐσέβεια and φιλοτιμία.” He was, the Eumolpidae claim, “serious (σπουδαῖος) . . . about the sanctuaries.”83 To these we may add the fuller account by Hyperides (4.24–5 of ca. 330–324) of how the Athenians, at the oracular request of Zeus of Dodona, “adorned” the statue of Dione there:You made made the face as beautiful as possible and all the other things related to it, and you prepared much costly adornment (κόσμος) for the 79 ὅπως [ἂ]ν ἔχῃ ̓Αχαρνεῦσιν καὶ ̓Αθ[η]ναίοις εὐσ[ε]βῶς τὰ πρὸς τοὺς θεούς, SEG 21.519.2–10.80 ἀρετῆς ἕνεκα καὶ φιλοτιμίας τῆς πρὸς τὸ κοινὸν καὶ εὐσεβείας τῆς πρὸς τὴν θεόν, IG II2 1277.6–10 and 22–4 of 278/7.

The Boule proposed to the Ekklesia the appointment of a board of five and two other officials and the priest to manage this and record the names and dedications of the previous dedicators.

A similar board is appointed, and again the purpose is “so that with these things being completed the things regarding the gods may be εὐσεβῶς for the Boule and the Demos.”91 An inven-tory of the dedications in the Chalcothece in 353/2 indicates that the same purpose lay behind being sure that any deficiencies are made up, that is, “so that things regarding the goddess may be κάλλιστα and εὐσεβέστατα.”92Finally, SEG 52.104.6–8 from Brauron, ca. 300–250, allows us to conclude that buildings as well as other elements were “dedications” in a sanctuary, and here were made, as more commonly sacrifices were, “for the safety of the Demos of Athenians.”93 Summary for Property of the GodsThe emphasis on εὐσέβεια in almost all activities concerning the property of the gods is notable, comparable only to that of actually performing sacri-fices. It is involved in the founding, repairing, adorning, and sometimes even supervising of sanctuaries, the building of altars, and the remaking, repair-ing, and inventorying of dedications. It is linked with δικαιοσύνη when money or legal matters are involved. εὐσέβεια in these contexts is often associated with “beauty” (κάλλος), and when they are paired, καλῶς or κάλλιστα is always given precedence in position. The major concern, often expressed, concern-ing the property of the gods was that it be treated “so that the things related to the gods may be (beautiful and) showing proper respect.” In most cases both “beauty” and “proper respect for the gods” come into play, but “proper respect” is always there. This is the counterpoint to the fact that hierosylia, the stealing 90 ὅπως ἂν τούτων γενομένων ἔχει καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς τε͂ι βουλε͂ι καὶ τῶ[ι] δήμωι τὰ πρὸς τοὺς θεούς, IG II3 1154.33–4 and 43–5. On this text see Mikalson, 1998.185–6. Interesting by contrast is Dem. 22.69–78 where the speaker claims that Androtion was made epimeletes for cleaning gold crowns in the polis treasury. Androtion reported that some leaves of them were falling off and apparently was authorized to melt them down and make from them new dedications. He had new paterae made, not crowns, which much offended the speaker, and he replaced the original inscriptions, often referring to great men and great accomplishments or to other states honoring Athens, with the phrase, “when Androtion was epimeletes.” On this event see Lewis, 1954.39–49.91 ἵνα τ[ούτων συν]τελουμένων εὐσεβῶς ἔχη[ι τῆι τε βου]λῆι καὶ τῶι δήμωι τὰ πρὸς τοὺς [θε]ούς, IG II2 840.28–31.92 ὅ[π]ω[ς] ἂ[ν] ἔχ[ηι κάλλιστα καὶ ε]ὐσεβέστ[ατα τὰ π]ρὸς τὴν θεόν, IG II2 120.31–2.93 [ὅσα ἡ] πόλις οἰκοδομήσασα ἀνέθηκεν τῆι θεῶι ὑπὲρ σωτηρίας το[ῦ δ]ήμου τοῦ ̓Αθηναίων."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 35The Qualifiers Of Athenian Religious Practicesof sacred property, was considered by many, and especially Plato, as the worst act of asebeia.94 General Conclusions on Qualifiers of Religious PracticesWe here survey the various terms and formulae we have seen used as qualifiers of religious actions and attempt to determine somewhat more precisely their meanings.καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς (“beautifully and in a manner showing proper respect”)The phrase καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς occurs only in these epigraphical texts, the certain first time in 282/1,95 but that the phrase must have been already known in the mid-fourth century is suggested by Xenophon, Mem. 4.3.16, πῶς οὖν ἄν τις κάλλιον καὶ εὐσεβέστερον τιμῴη θεούς (“How might anyone honor gods more καλῶς and more εὐσεβῶς?”) and Demosthenes, 23.29, ὡς καλῶς καὶ σφόδρ ̓ εὐσεβῶς ἔθηκε ὁ τιθεὶς τὸν νόμον (“How καλῶς and really εὐσεβῶς the one who made the law made it.”). In fact, nowhere in prior prose or poetic sources is an individual said even to have sacrificed εὐσεβῶς. To sacrifice is itself an act of εὐσέβεια, and in a way “to sacrifice εὐσεβῶς” is tautological, and that may be why “sacrificing εὐσεβῶς” does not occur in the earlier sources. It was, practically and theoretically, possible to sacrifice not εὐσεβῶς, that is, ἀσεβῶς. [Demosthenes] 59.116 offers one example: the hierophant Archias was con-victed in court of ἀσέβεια for sacrificing παρὰ τὰ πάτρια (“contrary to ancestral customs”), for making a sacrifice that belonged to the priestess, and for mak-ing it on the wrong day. In more theoretical terms, Plato has Euthyphro claim (Euthphr. 14b) that if someone knows how in prayer to say and in sacrifice to do things that bring charis to the gods, these things are ὅσια (“religiously cor-rect”), and such things preserve private households and the common affairs of cities. The opposites of these things that bring charis all do not show εὐσέβεια, and they overturn and destroy all things.96 Similarly Xenophon (Mem. 2.2.13) has Socrates claim that a person who shows no charis to his parents, who lacks a sense of charis, could not sacrifice εὐσεβῶς. And so, lying behind the εὐσεβῶς of these honorary decrees may be the implication that the individual understands the charis relationship with the gods, knows how to sacrifice to preserve that charis, follows τὰ πάτρια of the cult, and thus preserves the 94 Mikalson, 2010.166–7.95 IG II2 668.10–13.

It may be a reflection of the increasingly fulsome praise of the time and the genre.One could, in sacrifice, attempt to show “proper respect” for the god (εὐσέβεια) but do it in the wrong way (ἀνοσιότης), as we have seen in the case of the hierophant Archias.98 For a sacrifice to be successful, it must be done both εὐσεβῶς and ὁσίως. ὁσίως (“religiously correctly”), interestingly, though com-mon in earlier prose and poetic texts never occurs in these epigraphical texts,99 and this suggests one possible meaning of the καλῶς of καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς: καλῶς may have simply come to replace ὁσίως. It may be just the replacement of a specific adverb with a more general one, or, if we wish to maintain the “beauty” inherent in καλῶς, it may possibly be a sign of greater emphasis on the esthetics of sacrifice than on the rules governing it.Two other possible interpretations of this καλῶς should be mentioned. K. J. Dover (1974.72–3), working with non-epigraphical evidence, described one apparently common meaning of καλῶς when paired with other adverbs: “Kalos and kalôs seem to have a special function as a reinforcement to other words, so that in saying ‘x and kalos’ I not only communicate the judgment ‘x’ but also express, and hope to cause in my hearers, a feeling of admiration, as if I had exclaimed parenthetically, ‘How splendid!’ ” If we apply this interpreta-tion to καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς, the phrase would mean “splendidly ‘showing proper respect’ ”, or “ ‘showing proper respect’ in a manner I approve.” But the use of κάλλιον καὶ εὐσεβέστερον by Xenophon (Mem. 4.3.16, above) and of καλῶς καὶ σφόδρ ̓ εὐσεβῶς by Demosthenes (23.29, above) do not admit this interpreta-tion, and so we may reasonably deny it for καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς as well.100Veligianni-Terzi (1997.287–92) offers another analysis, using only epigraphic texts and beginning with καλῶς simplex, arguing that in these honorary 97 On charis as a fundamental basis for the Greek relationship between humans and gods, see now Jim, 2014.60–8.98 On this terminology, see Mikalson, 2010.154 and 168.99 See Appendix 4.100 Dover (p. 64) recognizes that “when two terms are co-ordinated by ‘and,’ it is reasonable to expect that each of them says something that the other does not, but,” he adds, “it must be confessed that reasonable expectation is often disappointed.” Whitehead (1993.67), in a thoughtful consideration of this question, concludes by “imposing a burden of proof upon anyone who wishes to claim that the relationship between the elements in any such pairing was not straightforwardly paratactic (but instead hyponymous, hendiadic or tau-tologous).” In the pairing of καλῶς with other terms, I would claim that in the cases I treat, but not in all cases, they were paratactic."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 37The Qualifiers Of Athenian Religious Practicestexts “καλῶς ist ein Grundbegriff, der die Ausführung eines Amtes oder einer Leiturgie oder bestimmter Aufgaben bewertet. . . .” Here the meaning of καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς would be that X had a task to perform, a sacrifice, and did that task and did it “in a manner showing proper respect.” Here it is hard to see what more is added by the καλῶς to the idea that X “sacrificed ‘in a manner showing proper respect.’ ”In short, two translations of καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς seem possible:Religiously correctly and in a manner showing proper respectBeautifully and in a manner showing proper respect101Given the emphasis on the “beauty” of sacrifices, sacrificial victims, and other religious activities previously described and the discussion of The Esthetic Dimension to follow in Chapter 13, I have decided on and used throughout “beautifully and in a manner showing proper respect” for καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς.102εὐσεβῶς εὐσέβεια εὐσεβής (“in a manner showing proper respect,” “proper respect,” “having proper respect”)103The meaning of εὐσεβῶς is fairly clear, without the complexities of the καλῶς. And, importantly, it and its cognates are not used indiscriminately in these epigraphical texts. In addition to the act of sacrifice, they attend the found-ing of a heorte and activities concerning sanctuaries and dedications. They concern sacrifice and the property of the gods, both central and closely tied to the deities themselves. They are not used to commend those who merely supervised religious activities or participated in pompai or agones. Those indi-viduals were praised in secular terms.104 Finally, εὐσέβεια was often introduced to honor those who participated in a number of religious activities, always including a sacrifice, as a way to provide a summary commendation.101 I leave out “well and with ‘proper respect’ ” because “well” tells us little. We are, in more general terms, trying to sort out what “to sacrifice well” means, and I think καλῶς holds the key to that.102 This is not to claim, though, that in all phrases where καλῶς is the first term it should be translated “beautifully.” In many other examples Dover’s interpretation holds.103 For “proper respect” and not “piety” for εὐσέβεια, see Mikalson, 2010.9 and passim.104 Here I disagree with Lambert who claims (2012.76) that “Eusebeia is a characteristic virtue of a priest, but can be shown by any honorand who is praised for the performance of religious functions.”"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"38CHAPTER 1On Attic inscriptions, interestingly, no one, even on a tombstone, is described by the simple adjective εὐσεβής, “having proper respect,” in our period.105 One may, as we have seen, act εὐσεβῶς and, from 255/4 on, one can “make εὐσέβεια towards the gods of the highest importance” (τὴν εἰς τοὺς θεοὺς εὐσέβειαν περὶ πλείστου ποιεῖσθαι). All of these, no doubt in good part because of the medium, are associated with specific actions at a specific time.To designate an individual εὐσεβής is a moral judgment of a person, not of an action, and perhaps the Athenians preferred not to make such a judgment.106 I specify Athenians here because a synonymous phrase, εὐσεβῶς ἔχων (or ἔχοντες), was used in other cities for individuals from late III BC on.107 In Athens individuals may be praised for acting εὐσεβῶς, not for “being εὐσεβεῖς.”108105 Even mentions of εὐσεβεία are rare on tombstones, all in poems, most involving women (IG II2 6557, 7227, 7863, and 8870). εὐσεβής is first used regularly in Attic inscriptions of the emperor Antoninus, 138–161 AD, a translation of his Latin title Pius (e.g., IG II2 3394 and SEG 17.69). Earlier Ariarathes, King of Cappadocia, also was so designated by the technitai of Dionysus at Athens (IG II2 1330 of 157/6–130). On this text, and on his serving as an agonothetes of the Panathenaia, which may also link him to the technitai in this period, see Aneziri, 2003, #A3 and pp. 45–6 and Shear, 2001.621. As a personal name we have, before II AD, only Eusebes of Pambotadae, ca. 40–17 (IG II2 2338.20 and Agora 15.285.6).106 So, too, no Athenian in the orators is described by the adjective εὐσεβής (Aeschin 2.163 of Demosthenes is sarcastic). Only some Amphissians are so described (Aeschin. 3.19). There is some talk of οἱ εὐσεβεῖς, usually of what they would or would not do (Isoc. 15.322 and frag. 20, Lycurg., Leoc. 93. Cf. Hdt. 2.141 and Xen. Ages. 11.1 and Cyn. 13.17). Elsewhere in the orators the adjective is used of things or actions: of the ψῆφος (Dem. 18.126. Cf. 23.97); of a λόγος (Lycurg. Leoc. 1); of γράμματα (Is. 6.49); and of μάχαι (Isoc. 12.182). The orators are not, however, reticent with ἀσεβής, even of fellow citizens: Demosthenes of Meidias (21. 114. cf. 227), of Aristogiton (25.54 and 63), of Androtion (22.28), of his enemies in Athens (18.241), and what Aeschines might say of the Lacedaemonians and Phocians (19.73); Dinarchus of Demosthenes (1.21); [Lysias] 6.45 of informers, 6.17 of Andocides, and frag. 195.1 [Carey] of Cinesias; Antiphon of accusers (6.33); and Aeschines about the Thirty (2.176). They also speak of οἱ ἀσεβεῖς in general (Isoc. 8.120 and frag. 20, Dem. 24.104 and 25.52–3). They so describe also things and actions: λόγοι (Isoc. 12.203, Dem. 21.104), ἐπιγράμματα (Dem. 22.72 = 24.180), ἔργον (20.126) and πράγματα (19.132).107 E.g., Delphi (FD 3.2.48.4 of 98/7, 49.1–2 of 106, and 50.1–2 of 97 or 106); Magnesia (Rigsby #66.19–20 of 208/7 and #102.56–7); Didyma (I. Didyma 142.4–5 of 167–140); Patmus (I. Patmos 1.3–4 of 184–100); and Oropus (I. Oropos 294.2–4 of 150–100).108 Verbal and participial forms of εὐσεβ-are not attested in Athenian state documents, the one apparent exception being SEG 45.126.7 of ca. 280–240. εὐσεβοῦσι has been restored at SEG 18.27.19 where εὐσεβῶς is more probable.

And they rarely used the superlative, and then only as an adverb. We find εὐσεβέστατα three times in variations of the phrase ὅπως ἂν ὡς εὐσεβέστατα ἔχῃ (τὰ πρὸς τοὺς θεούς),109 and twice in relation to voting and taking oaths.110 All are in the context of managing dedications and sanctuaries, not about named individuals. All are also from mid-IV BC or earlier. The hesitation to use the comparatives and superlatives of εὐσεβής is similar in the literary texts, but the contexts are more revealing. The compara-tive is first attested in Aeschylus, Cho. 139–41 where Electra prays to her father that she be σωφρονεστέρα and εὐσεβεστέρα than her mother, but this can hardly imply that she thought Clytemestra was σώφρων and εὐσεβής. Euripides in Or. 627–8 has Tyndareus advise Menelaus not to choose friends who are δυσσεβεῖς, thrusting aside those who are εὐσεβέστεροι. Elsewhere the true com-parative force comes through. In Euripides, frag. 327 [Nauck] the speaker offers a common sentiment, “I see that those (poor people) sacrificing small offerings to gods are εὐσεβέστεροι than those rich people sacrificing cows.” That is, the rich, when they sacrifice, are εὐσεβεῖς, but the poor with their humble offer-ings are εὐσεβέστεροι. In a similar manner Xenophon (Mem. 4.3.16) has Socrates ask, “How might anyone honor the gods κάλλιον καὶ εὐσεβέστερον than by doing it as the gods themselves bid?” Others might sacrifice, in our usual phrase, καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς. So, too, Aeschines the philosopher (frag. 8.61–2 [Dittmar]) claims τοῖς καλοῖς κἀγαθοῖς εὐσεβεστέροις γε οὖσι ἄμεινα τὰ παρὰ τῶν θεῶν ὑπάρχειν (“For those who are good and noble, if they εὐσεβέστεροι, the things from the gods are better”).111 Xenophon (Mem. 4.3.18) has Socrates making those with him εὐσεβέστεροι καὶ σωφρονέστεροι. Not to be missed in all of this, even including Demosthenes’ rants against Philip, is that individual Greek states, including Athenians, did not claim to defeat or be able to defeat their IG II2 1275.10.

He links it to Athenian jurors, as do the orators.113 Isocrates describes the Athenians as πρὸς τὰ τῶν θεῶν εὐσεβέστατα διακειμένους (4.33). Xenophon ups the ante, from comparative to superlative, to Aeschines’ statement above, having Socrates think that τοὺς θεοὺς ταῖς παρὰ τῶν εὐσεβεστάτων τιμαῖς μάλιστα χαίρειν (“The gods find charis especially in the honors from the εὐσεβέστατοι.”) (Mem. 1.3.3).114 In all of these reference is to a group. Xenophon was the first to apply the superlative to a contemporary individual, Socrates (1.1.20).115 Most individuals who are praised in these texts as εὐσεβέστατοι are royalty, mostly of myth, perhaps not surprising in trag-edy (Neoptolemus in S. Ph. 85, Pittheus in E. Med. 684, Strophius in El. 886–7, Chiron in IA 926–7) but also in historians (Alcimus in Xanthus, FGrHist 765 F 10 and Anacharsis in Ephorus, FGrHist 70 F 158).116 The link to royalty brings us to one of the earliest occurrences in all inscriptions, Attalus II’s description of his mother as εὐσεβεστάτη γενομένη πασῶμ.117 And all this may suggest the origins of the later common practice, but not in Athens, of praising monarchs, Roman emperors, and such as εὐσεβέστατος. It was appropriate for kings and emperors, not for the common man.τὰ πρὸς τοὺς θεούς (“the things relating to the gods”)118Isocrates and Aristotle give some indication of what it meant that τὰ πρὸς τοὺς θεούς were εὐσεβῶς and καλῶς.

Or. 1650–2 where, according to Apollo, the gods will render εὐσεβεστάτην ψῆφον for Orestes in Athens. In Antiphon 6.51, if the passage is genuine, the εὐσεβέστατοι Athenian jurors are contrasted to the ἀνοσιώτατοι prosecutors, all in the context of oaths. Dinarchus (1.87) has Athenian jurors claim that they are πάντων εὐσεβέστατοι.114 Cf. Isoc. 15.282.115 Menander has Demeas use it of his son concerning his behavior towards his father (Sam. 274).

For in this way you will seem to be at the same time sacrificing to the gods and remaining true to your oaths.Aristotle in the Rhetoric (1383a–b), in describing why people are “courageous” or “confident” (θαρραλέοι), includes, “if in general the things relating to the gods are καλῶς for them, both the other things and the things from omens and oracles.”119 Sacrifices, maintenance of oaths, and, what is a particular concern in our texts, successful divinination are indicators that τὰ πρὸς τοὺς θεούς are καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς.120φιλοτίμως φιλοτιμία (“in a manner showing a love of honor,” “love of honor”)φιλοτίμως, “in a manner showing a love of honor,” is, in the phrase καλῶς καὶ φιλοτίμως, the most common commendation of religious activities. Whitehead, who did the foundational study of the concept of φιλοτιμία,121 trans-lates it “with a love of honor.” Here it is δημοσία φιλοτιμία, “φιλοτιμία involving the Demos,” as specified in Demosthenes 18.257 and Aeschines 1.129. The type of “honor” which is loved is described as follows by Aristotle in the Nicomachaean Ethics (8.1163b3–8): τιμή is the prize for virtue and benefactions, and “the one who provides no good to the community is not held in honor, because a com-munal thing is given to the one who benefits the community, and honor is that communal thing.”122 Relevant here is the sentiment Thucydides has Pericles express in the Funeral Oration (2.44.4), “Love of honor (τὸ φιλότιμον) alone is ageless, and in the useless time of life (i.e., old age), earning a profit does not delight more, as some say, but being honored (τὸ τιμᾶσθαι).”Demosthenes in court, in his prosecution of Meidias for assaulting him when he was a choregos, claims that the jurors ought to judge φιλοτιμία not if someone builds a house in an illustrious way (λαμπρῶς) or owns many servant 119 For θαρρεῖν in a similar context, see Xen.

In his discussion of this passage MacDowell (1990.378–9) offers a good summary account of the various aspects of φιλοτιμία: “Literally ‘love of honour,’ the word refers not only to a state of mind but also to an activity undertaken for the purpose of gaining honour; and honour (τιμή) means praise, admiration, deference, and sometimes material rewards, given by other people in acknowledgement of such activity success-fully undertaken.”The recently discovered honors (SEG 56.203) to Bacchis, the ἐπιμελήτρια (“female supervisor”) of the thiasos of Agathe Thea, probably of 214/3, offer a good explication of how φιλοτιμία in religious matters was sometimes viewed: Bacchis is honored “so that it may be a matter of competition (ἐφάμιλλον) for all those wishing to show φιλοτιμία in the association, knowing that they will receive return favors (χάριτες) worth what they show φιλοτιμία in.”123 It was treated as a “competition” (ἐφάμιλλον), and the nature of the χάριτες ἄξιαι are revealed in the next lines: the thiasotai are to praise Bacchis, to give her a crown of ivy “because of her εὐσέβεια towards the gods and her φιλοτιμία towards themselves,” and the hieropoioi are publicly to announce the crown.124Bacchis, in her role, also contributed her own money (lines 6–11), but we should not assume “financial generosity” behind most commendations for φιλοτιμία.125 Many individuals are praised for their φιλοτιμία in sacrifices and other religious activities. Some contributed their own money for these activi-ties, but most did not.126 Rather, they just performed their religious task in a way that would bring them the civic honor they “loved,” and the honoring decrees themselves, the crowns, and other such awards are the indication that they accomplished this.127123 ὅπως ἂν οὖν ἐφάμιλλον ἦι πᾶσι τοῖς βουλομένοις [ἐν] τεῖ συνόδῳ φιλοτιμεῖσθαι εἰδόσιν ὅτι χάριτας ἀξίας κομ[ι]οῦνται ὧν φιλοτιμηθῶσιν. This clause or slight variants of it, common in honorary inscriptions, was used also in honors of several other officials involved in religious activities. On these and on such hortatory clauses in general, see Chapter 12.124 Cf. Hesp. Suppl. 15, #1.20–21 of 131/0, a decree honoring a gymnasiarch for his religious activities, where we have εἰδόσιν ὅτι καταξίως τιμηθήσονται (“knowing that they will be honored in a worthy way”).

The meaning “beautifully and showing a love of honor,” which I would prefer, is more difficult here, largely because the phrase is used in praise of many offi-cials and individuals whose activities would seem to allow little opportunity to display “beauty.”128 But we should consider how often, in the fourth century, φιλοτιμία is linked to τὰ καλά even in profane matters, as in Plato, Smp. 178d, when Phaedrus, in response to the question of what ought to guide men who intend to live καλῶς, answers “αἰσχύνη at τὰ αἰσχρά and φιλοτιμία at τὰ καλά,” for without these it is not possible for a city or an individual to accomplish deeds that are great and καλά. One can see here, as probably in our texts, the coexistence of both esthetic and moral concepts: what is αἰσχρόν is ugly and bad, what is καλόν is beautiful and good, and shame (αἰσχύνη) is linked to the former, φιλοτιμία to the latter.129 There may well have been for the perfor-mance of most or all religious and even profane duties an esthetic element that escapes us, an element captured in the καλῶς of καλῶς καὶ φιλοτίμως.εὐσέβεια καὶ φιλοτιμία (“proper respect” and “love of honor”)εὐσεβείας ἕνεκα καὶ φιλοτιμίας is widely used from 284/3 on130 as a summary commendation for those who have performed sacrifices, often in conjunction with other religious services.131 It, like several other phrases considered, occurs 128 See, e.g., Veligianni-Terzi, 1997.289–292.129 Cf.

Here two variants are noteworthy. A priestess of Aglauros receives a crown only because of her εὐσέβεια, with no mention of φιλοτιμία (SEG 33.115). Likewise a priestess of Athena Polias was honored only for her εὐσέβεια, but later in the text her husband is honored for both his εὐσέβεια and φιλοτιμία (IG II2 776.20–6 and 26–30). The priestess’ φιλοτιμία, if the restoration is correct, concerned only the goddess (lines 14–16). Perhaps in some circumstances φιλοτιμία was not thought appropriate for a woman!

In fact even εὐσεβείας ἕνεκα by itself occurs only twice in other earlier or contemporary prose and poetry, in one author.132 When fully expressed, the εὐσέβεια of this phrase is directed to the gods, the φιλοτιμία towards the relevant community—whether it be the polis, the deme, or a pri-vate religious association.133 We have discussed already the individual terms, but note here that εὐσέβεια is always given precedence over φιλοτιμία and that, because of the εὐσέβεια, it commends only those who have sacrificed or have been directly involved with the property of the gods.134Some may reasonably see in the Athenians’ regular praise of individuals or groups τῆς εὐσεβείας ἕνεκα an indication that they are attributing to them the status of being εὐσεβεῖς.135 I would make the distinction, perhaps too fine, that rather than describing a permanent moral status, τῆς εὐσεβείας ἕνεκα is closely linked to the time and act(s) for the individuals who are honored, Strategos: I. Rhamnous II.59.23–6, by Sarapiastae for having given them land for their sanctuary at Rhamnous. Ephebes: only once, IG II3 1166.29–31. The absence in the several other ephebic decrees is noteworthy. Perhaps for them, too, φιλοτιμία was not thought appropriate. Most interesting is IG II3 1150.3–5 and 7–9 of 224/3–222/1, wherein the Ephesians honor the Athenians and the Athenians in turn honor the Ephesians, both εὐσεβείας ἕνεκα καὶ εὐνοίας.132 Antiphon, Tetra. 2.3.12 and Orat. 6.7.133 If the restorations are correct, the priestess of Athena Polias shows φιλοτιμία to the deity (IG II2 776.14–16). In I. Eleusis 70.9–11 a foreigner showed φιλοτιμία “towards the gods and the Demos of Athenians and of the Eleusinians.” In SEG 18.22.18–20 a priest of Asclepius also apparently shows εὐσέβεια and φιλοτιμία towards the gods, but this is probably a mis-use of the usual formula, as also in SEG 18.24.10–12. Clinton restores I. Eleusis 234.6 to have, uniquely, the εὐσέβεια directed to the genos of the Eumolpidae, but note a different restoration in IG II2 1045.7.134 If εὐσεβείας ἕνεκα καὶ φιλοτιμίας first appears in 282/1 as a summary commendation for sac-rificing and other religious activities, we might ask what, if any, terms of praise were used before this time. ἀρετῆς ἕνεκα καὶ φιλοτιμίας might seem a candidate. The phrase is used to commend taxiarchs in 271/0 (Agora 16.187.27–30), a strategos in 293/2 (SEG 45.101.37–40), a choregos in 326/5 (Schwenk #65.7–11), and is restored for a syllogeus in 324/3 (Schwenk #77.7–10). Each had performed religious services, but all but the choregos had performed many non-religious services as well, and the summary commendation clearly refers to their whole contribution, not just their religious activities. On ἀρετῆς ἕνεκα καὶ φιλοτιμίας and some of these texts, see Veligianni-Terzi, 1997.221.135 It is worth noting that neither Athenians nor others are attested to have been praised as individuals τῆς ὁσιότητος ἕνεκα.

Both are there, but, because of the usual priority of the gods, εὐσέβεια comes first. But the fundamental point is that here and in virtually all the religious actions we see described throughout this study the focus is simultaneously on the gods and on one’s own community, whether it be fellow citizens, fellow demesmen, or fellow members of a private cult. In these texts religious acts are virtually always directed to both the gods and the members of one’s community.136εὐσέβεια καὶ δικαιοσύνη (“proper respect” and “honesty”)137In the orators εὐσεβής and δίκαιος and their cognates are regularly paired, but not on Athenian polis documents.138 The one exception, however, is revealing. In IG II3 292 of 352/1 the fifteen members of an ad hoc committee to determine the boundaries of the Sacred Orgas are to swear an oath, and various officials are to be there as witnesses that they swear this oath [ὡ]ς εὐσεβέστατα καὶ δικαιότατα. The oath is to be that they will vote [ὡς δι]καιότατα καὶ εὐσεβέστατα (5–16). The oath involves εὐσέβεια towards the gods and also δικαιοσύνη because legal and financial issues are involved. The voting involves, obviously, δικαιοσύνη but also εὐσέβεια if, as here, the voter has sworn an oath to vote δικαίως.139 Inscriptions from Attic demes and private associations reveal another context for the pairing of εὐσεβῶς and δικαίως, when an offi-cial in the course of performing religious actions has also handled financial or legal matters.140 Here the distinction is sometimes made, and is everywhere 136 For more on this, see The Social Dimension in Chapter 13.137 Dihle (1968) has treated this pair in a short but very rich monograph entitled Der Kanon der zwei Tugenden. There he traces this pair and describes the changes of meanings of the terms from earliest Greek poetry through Vulgärethik (using some of our texts) and philosophy into Judaic and early Christian writings.138 The usual order is εὐσέβεια first, then δικαιοσύνη. Reversals of this order may have a rhe-torical purpose, as in Lycur. Leoc. 1.139 Cf. Dem. 23.97.

Apart from the Athenian examples, the earliest of which is 252/1, nine are found at Delphi, the earliest being of 189/8 and one being a decree of the Aetolian League. Three derive from Delos, all of early II BC and all are virtually identical to the Delphic texts of ca. 70 years earlier. The dates would suggest that Athens provided the phrase and that Delphi built it into boilerplate which Delos then copied (Delphi: FD 3.2.89.4–5, 3.118.6–7, 3.147.9–11, 3.240.8, 4.56.5–6, 4.57.8–9, 4.161.6–7, 4.171.5, 6.4.8–9, SGDI 2677, all of II BC, the earliest of which is SGDI 2677 of 189/8.

Comm. 22–3), all of II BC. An outlier, though, a Samothracian decree of the 280’s hon-oring King Lysimachus for punishing those who robbed and attempted to burn their sanctuary, claims he did this περὶ [πλ]εί[σ]του ποιούμενος τὴμ πρὸς τοὺς [θε]οὺς εὐσέβειαν (IG XII.8.150.17–19). This already has the ring of a formula and casts doubt on the Athenian origins of the use of this phrase in a religious context. Inscriptions using this phrase are, understandably, almost all honorary, and εὐσέβεια is included in the praise because the individual benefited both a city and its sanctuary. The sanctuary, in the Greek religious tradition, is always named first, as in περί τε τὸ ἱερὸν καὶ τὸν δῆμον of IG XI.4.776.5–6 or ποτὶ τὸ ἱερὸν καὶ τὰν πόλιν of FD 3.3.118.6 of Delphi.

For private groups, whether the Eleusinians or a koinon, the φιλοτιμία was naturally directed “to themselves.”33 The order is always εὐσέβεια first, then φιλοτιμία, except in IG II3 416.20–1 of 340–30 where they are reversed. Two priestesses of polis cult, of Aglauros and Athena Polias, were both hon-ored for just their εὐσέβεια towards the god(s), with no mention of φιλοτιμία. It may or may not be relevant that in both cases male relatives are involved, the son the of the priestess of Aglauros and the husband of the priestess of Athena Polias, and the latter is expressly praised “because of his εὐσέβεια towards the gods and his φιλοτιμία towards the Boule and Demos.”34 In the fourth and early third centuries priests and priestesses were occasionally praised for their δικαιοσύνη, and in each case something the individual had done points to the reason. The priest of Amphiaraus ca. 369/8 had managed, at the least, money for a sacrifice and the erection of the stele.35 The priest of Asclepius in 284/3 had sacrificed and also superintended the allotment of jurors δικαίως καὶ κατὰ το[ὺ]ς νόμους, and so is honored for his εὐσέβεια, δικαιοσύνη, καὶ φιλοτιμία, in that order.36 About 360 the priest of Apollo Zoster is praised by demesmen for his εὐσέβεια καὶ δικαιοσύνη after he gave an accounting of his service to the demesmen. He is praised elsewhere in the text for his φιλοτιμία in restoring the sanctuary.37 A priest of Asclepius in 328/7 is to be honored for his ἀρετὴ and δικαιοσύνη after he gives his audit.

His εὐσέβεια, separately men-tioned, concerned his supervision of the sanctuary.38 The priestess of the koinon of the Mother of the Gods in Piraeus in 272/1 was praised in the same terms, and she had reported dedications and had rendered revenues, both δικαίως. There is no mention of her εὐσέβεια, probably because sacrifices are nowhere described.39For their priestly activities both the priestess of Athena Polias in 237/6 and the priest of Asclepius in 244/3 were commended for “making of most importance their εὐσέβεια towards the gods.”40 The formula καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς, in that order, is also used to commend priestly service as a whole. The priestess of the Mother of the Gods in 212/1 performed her priestly service (ἱερωσύνη) κ[α]λῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς.41 The priest of Apollo Zoster does his service not only καλῶς καὶ ε[ὐ]σεβῶς but also ἀξίως τοῦ θεοῦ.42 In SEG 18.22.12–13 of 165/4 it is the behavior of the priest of Asclepius that is praised: “And he has made also his behavior (ἀναστροφή) εὐσχήμων and befitting his priestly service.”43 In 106/5 Chrysis, the priestess of Athena, was praised by the Delphians for her role in the Pythaïs to Delphi. She was “present in a grand fashion (μεγαλομερῶς) and worthily of the god and of her own virtue,” and “she made her stay and behav-ior καλή and εὐσχήμων and worthy of the Demos of Athenians.”44 It is in these general praises of priests and priestesses that we first encounter the emphasis on esthetics (καλῶς and εὐσχήμων) that is so common for sacrificial and other religious practices.In short, priests should demonstrate εὐσέβεια towards the gods, φιλοτιμία towards fellow citizens or cult members, should make their service εὐσχήμων, and, if financial or legal matters were involved, should show δικαιοσύνη. And a priestess should show all of the above, except φιλοτιμία.

In this chapter we do enter this spider’s web, and we find that our epigraphical texts support but also refine some of the conclusions that Parker draws from his study. In particular we can isolate which priests in our period could repre-sent the polis and which magistrates and boards did, in more general terms, sacrifice and how often. We can also define more precisely which deities and rituals were involved and what groups the sacrificers formed. It will turn out that, despite the very large number of priests, priestesses, cults, deities, and rituals in Athens, only a very few are, in our texts, explicitly linked to the inte-rests of the polis as a whole. The vast majority of sacrifices in Athens and Attica did not involve governmental officials or any reports to the Demos or Boule.Parker comes to the conclusion that both priests and magistrates could, independently, sacrifice in the interests of the whole polis. “There was no spe-cial mode of communication with the divine only operable by priest (or by magistrate): either could perform the same central acts with the same results, though tradition may have insisted that one or the other should do so in a particular case” (97).1 When we apply the facts of our texts to this general prin-ciple, we will find that the general principle is valid, but in its application a surprisingly small number of priests, priestesses, and deities appear. Priests and PriestessesWe begin with priests and priestesses sacrificing by themselves explicitly on behalf of constituent elements of the polis and reporting on their sacrifices 1 Parker’s account is thorough and convincing, and here I will build on that and not rehearse all the evidence and arguments supporting it."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 57Who Sacrifices And To Whom?to the polis.2 The only priest who did both regularly was the priest of the Asclepius of the City Asclepieion. He sacrificed, alone, “on behalf of the Boule and Demos” and other relevant parties and then reported to the Boule con-cerning the results of these sacrifices in 328/7, 244/3, 165/4, and 137/6.3 All other attestations of solo sacrifices and reports to the polis are single, isolated events: the priest of Zeus Soter of the Stoa of Zeus, the priestess of Athena Polias, and the priestess of Aglauros.4 Noteworthy is the prominence of the priest of Asclepius here. Only he and perhaps the priest of Zeus Soter regularly made such sacrifices and reports. Also noteworthy is that all the deities, Asclepius, Zeus Soter, Athena Polias, and Aglauros were central to polis cult. The above priests and priestesses seemingly followed a formal procedure in making reports,5 but the priest of Kalliste, the one relatively minor figure among this group, made several sacrifices “on behalf of the Boule and Demos,” but appar-ently no formal report.6 And so, if we ask with Parker whether priests indi-vidually could represent the polis before the gods, if they could, in our terms, sacrifice for “the health and safety of the Boule and Ekklesia,” the answer is yes. But very few did, and only those of gods central to the polis cult, and, impor-tantly, they almost all then reported the results of their sacrifices to the polis. To argue ex silentio, the vast majority of priests and priestess were not sacrific-ing “for the health and safety of the Boule and Ekklesia,”7 and they were not obliged or did not feel obliged to report on their sacrifices to the polis.Priests are on rare occasions described as making sacrifices along with other officials. A few times they made sacrifices, not surprisingly, with the hieropoioi and epimeletai of their cult.8 Of more relevance to priestly and governmen-tal interaction are their few sacrifices in collaboration with lay officials.

We begin with administrative officials, then legislative officials, then military officials, then the elected or alloted lay officials, then the ephebes and their officials. Administrative Officials Archons (as a group)The nine archons sacrificed at the end of their term of office “on behalf of the one who is going to be archon” (Lysias 26.6–8).11 Archon (Eponymous)The Athenaion Politeia (56.4) describes at some length the archon’s duties of supervision of various heortai, especially many aspects of the pompe and agones of the City Dionysia and the Thargelia.12 He supervised also the pompai of the Asclepieia and for Zeus Soter. He appointed the choregoi and the archetheoros for the theoria to Delos. In all of this, the author mentions no sacrifices. In inscriptions the archons of 283/2 (Euthius) and of 282/1 (Nicias) are both praised for their supervision of the pompe of the City Dionysia. Euthius, in addition, “sacrificed the sacrifices to the gods κατὰ τὰ πάτρια,” and Nicias reported on the sacrifices he sacrificed to Dionysus “for the health and safety of the Boule, the Demos of Athenians, and the crops in the land.” He sacrificed also the “other sacrifices which it was appropriate for him to sac-rifice (ὅσας αὐτῶι προσῆκεν) καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς.”13 From these two texts we 9 Perrin-Saminadayar, 2007.206–12, T26.6–8 of 122/1, 1011.5–7 of 106/5, Hesp.

It is no doubt the archon’s long association with the Thargelia that led to him being ordered, in the reorganization of Apollo’s heortai in 129/8, to sacrifice, along with the basileus and the strategoi, to Apollo and to “produce” (ἐ[πιτελ]έσαι) the pompai and sacrifices at the Thargelia.14 He at least once attended, along with the strategos and the epimeletai, the ephebes’ sacrifice to Ajax on Salamis,15 and, with the other eight archons and others, received a portion of the meat at a sacrifice to Asclepius.16 BasileusThe Athenaion Politeia (57.1) assigns to the basileus supervision of the Mysteries with the epimeletai of the Mysteries,17 administration of the Lenaia with its pompe and agon, the performance of all agones of the torch-races, and admin-istration (διοικεῖ) of, “so to speak,” τὰς πατρίους θυσίας . . .πάσας.18 Plato in the Politicus (290e3–8) has the stranger claim that in Athens “the most revered (τὰ σεμνότατα) and especially ancestral (πάτρια) of the ancient sacrifices have been given (ἀποδεδόσθαι) to the basileus,” and this probably refers to the “adminis-tration” of them rather than to their performance. In [Lysias] 6.4 it is expected that the basileus will sacrifice κατὰ τὰ πάτρια in the City Eleusinion and in the sanctuary at Eleusis. The only record of his sacrifices in epigraphical texts is in association with the refurbishing of the Apollo cult in 129/8. There he is to sacrifice to Apollo Patroös and at the Thargelia with the archon and strategoi, and again to Apollo with the priest, the herald of the Areopagus Council, and the thesmothetai.19 His role seems to be more the administration of αἱ πάτριοι θυσίαι than actually making them,20 and in this regard it is appropriate that the inscriptions recording the revision of the State Calendar of sacrifices at the 14 SEG 21.469C.24–7.15 IG II2 1008.76–7.

ThesmothetaiThe Athenaion Politeia gives no religious activities to the thesmothetai, and in the epigraphical record they are recorded as sacrificing only once, with the basileus, the herald of the Areopagus Council, and the priest, to Apollo in the refurbishing of the Apollo cult in 129/8.22 Other Administrative OfficialsThe same text orders the tamiai of the sitiotic fund to sacrifice, along with the tamias of the Boule, to Apollo (lines 58–9) and the tamias of the stratiotic fund also to sacrifice to Apollo (56–7). In this text also, as we have seen, the herald of the Areopagus Council sacrifices to Apollo, with the basileus, the thesmothetai, and the priest (51–2).

So, too, the demarch of Skambonidai sacrificed at least twice and probably several times more each year. In 165/4 the demarch of Eleusis is honored for having sacrificed at the Haloa and Chloia to Demeter and Kore; having sacrificed to Dionysus, sent the pompe, and “made” the agon at the Dionysia;26 and having participated in (συνετέλεσεν) the sacrifice and having sent the pompe of the Kalamaia. The same official, ca. 300 BC, sacrificed to Dionysus “for the health and safety of the demesmen.” In 350–325 the demarch of Hagnous sacrificed the Plerosia to Zeus and distributed the meat. About 303 the demarch of Ikarion “sacrificed to all the gods “to whom [πάτριον ἦν] to sacrifice, and the demarch of the same deme in the mid-fourth century also “made” the heorte for Dionysus καλῶς καὶ δικαίως.

So, too, the strategoi, and, so to speak, all the offices (αἱ ἀρχαί).Demosthenes, 19.190 EkklesiaThere are in the epigraphical texts no sacrifices nor, in fact, any religious actions attributed to the Ekklesia as a body. An act of the Ekklesia would be termed an act of the Demos. BouleDemosthenes (21.114) claims that, as a member of the Boule, he “served as hieropoios for the εἰσιτητήρια on behalf of the Boule” and he sacrificed, and he “began the sacrifices / rituals” (κατάρξασθαι τῶν ἱερῶν) on behalf “of the whole polis.”30 What had Demosthenes done? Although the evidence is not clear, I think that during his prytany he made the opening sacrifices for each meet-ing of the Boule (the eisiteteria in this context).31 As a member of the Boule the defendant of Antiphon 6.45 prayed, with other members of the Boule, to Zeus Boulaios and Athena Boulaia as they entered the Bouleuterion. These would be prayers accompanying the eisiteteria that Demosthenes describes. The defen-dant also claims that as he entered “the other sanctuaries” with the Boule, he sacrificed and prayed “on behalf of the democracy.” These probably routine sacrifices of the Boule are not attested in the epigraphical documents.I. Eleusis 142 of 353/2, in part by restorations, leaves the impression that the Boule, in addition to supervising that the ἀπαρχαί of grain to Eleusis occur, is by the new nomos to supervise (ἐπιμελεῖσθαι) that the sacrifices be sacri-ficed on behalf of the Demos, both those “from the pelanos”32 as directed by the Eumolpidae and also the sacrifices to Zeus, Demeter, Kore, Triptolemus, Euboulos, “the god and goddess,” and Athena. The Boule, when the ἀπαρχή is 30 Cf. Dem. 19.190, above.31 For the latter, see Prytaneis below.

When Nicocrates served as that tamias, he “dispensed funds to the hieropoioi for victims for sacrifices and ‘himself joined (the hieropoioi) in supervision,’ sacrificing all the sacri-fices.” In this office he also spent some of his own money for sacrifices.35 In the reorganization of the Apollo cult in 129/8 the tamias of the Boule also, with the tamiai of the grain fund, sacrificed to Apollo (SEG 21.469C.58–9).36 PrytaneisDemosthenes (19.190) claims that all the prytaneis sacrifice, dine, and pour libations together. The phrasing of the passage (above) suggests that some of these sacrifices were εἰσιτητήρια. The numerous decrees honoring prytaneis confirm Demosthenes’ statements. Clearly every prytany in its turn sacrificed to Apollo Prostaterios before meetings of the Ekklesia. Apollo Prostaterios was joined by Artemis Boulaia by 259/8,37 and later by Artemis Phosphoros, first attested in 182/1, omitted in 181/0 and 178/7, but from 175/4 on usually present.38 Occasional sacrifices by prytanies are also attested for a number of deities: 33 On this text, see Clinton, 2005–2008.II.133–5.

The prytaneis are to sacrifice to Athena Nike, Agathe Tyche, and the Soteres (here, surely, Demetrius and his father), and hereafter during each Elaphebolion they are to sacrifice to Agathe Tyche and the Soteres.40 In the reorganization of the Apollo heortai in 129/8 the prytaneis in service at the time are hence-forth to sacrifice the “sixth-month offering” (ἑξαμηνιαῖον), surely to Apollo, and this involved both a sacrifice and a pompe.41 Prytaneis in 140/39 also dedi-cated the special wreath, the εἰρυσιώνη, to Apollo.42Two prytany decrees do much to explain these occasional sacrifices. The prytaneis of the tribe Antiochis were honored in 140/39, on the eighteenth day of the fifth prytany, eighteen days after they had finished their term of service (Agora 15.240). During their term they had sacrificed to Demeter and Kore at the Stenia and to Theseus.

Other occasional sacrifices by prytaneis reveal polis participation in the same form in the heortai of other deities, includ-ing the Mother of the Gods,46 Zeus at the Kronia (of Hekatombaion 12), Zeus Ktesios, Asclepius in Piraeus, and perhaps Zeus and Athena as the Soteres in late Skirophorion.47There were 50 prytaneis in each prytany, and we may ask who among them actually performed the sacrifices expected of the prytany. The decrees honor-ing tamiai of the prytanies, each elected by his fellow prytaneis, indicate that he “sacrificed all the sacrifices which were appropriate for him (καθῆκον) in the prytany, on behalf of his fellow tribesmen, the Boule, and the Demos.”48 Sometimes the grammateus of the prytany joined him,49 and once we have the tamias and grammateus of the prytany and the tamias of the Boule.50 The individual always present, however, is the tamias of the prytany, and it is most likely that the sacrifices he made were those before meetings of the Ekklesia to Apollo Prostaterios and Artemis Boulaia. These individuals were honored and crowned by the polis usually for sacrificing καλῶς and φιλοτίμως. They offer a nice context for Theophrastus’ “Man of Petty Ambition” (μικροφιλότιμος) (Char. 21). μικροφιλοτιμία may be defined as “a feeling of honor based on trivialities.”51 This individual contrived to become the one who, as a prytanis, made the report on the prytany’s sacrifice to the Mother of the Gods at the Galaxia. For this “small” (μικρ-) service he basked, at home, in his φιλοτιμία.52 46 Since a prytany could be honored before the end of its service, Agora 15.180.10 may indi-cate that the heorte or sacrifice for the Mother of the Gods occurred sometime in the period Hekatombaion 1–20.47 Zeus at Kronia, Agora 15.81.6; Zeus Ktesios, IG II3 1304.9; Asclepius, IG II2 47.35–8; and the Soteres, Agora 15.115.12–13.48 Agora 15.38.74–6 of 341/0, 85.1–4 and 86.9–13, both of mid-III BC, and IG II3 1144.22–3 of just before 224 and 1231.39–44 of 210–201.49 IG II3 1168.44–7 of 211/0 and 1153.47–50 of 222/1.

Military Officers StrategoiDem. 19.190, above, would suggest a rather extensive sacrificial program of the strategoi, but this is not supported by epigraphical evidence. There only rarely are the strategoi, as a group, presented as participating in a sacrifice.53 In 275/4 and 271/0 the strategoi sacrificed what look to be regular sacrifices with the taxiarchs.54 In 129/8, in the reorganization of the cult of Apollo, the strategoi, along with the basileus and the archon, are to sacrifice the apparently new sac-rifices to Apollo and the sacrifices at the Thargelia.55 Elsewhere we have, only once, one strategos participating, with the archon and the epimeletai, in the sacrifice the ephebes made to Ajax at the Aianteia on Salamis in 118/7.56 More regular, and more public, were the libations the strategoi as a group made to Dionysus during the City Dionysia.57In IG II2 1496, in the account of the dermaticon fund from 334/3 to 331/0, a number of officials including boönai, the epimeletai of the Mysteries, hiero-poioi, and syllogeis received revenue from the sale of skins of sacrificed victims at various heortai and sacrifices.58 The strategoi received such funds from the sacrifices to Hermes Hegemonios (84–5, 115–16), Eirene (94–5, 127–8), Ammon (96–7), at the Lenaia (105–6, 146–7), at the City Dionysia (111–12), to Demokratia (131–2, 140–1), at the Dionysia in Piraeus (144–5), and to Agathe Tyche (148–9). Noteworthy is how many of these sacrifices were relatively new, introduced in the fourth century: to Eirene, Ammon, Demokratia, and Agathe Tyche. Some 53 We do not include sacrifices by individual strategoi on the battlefield, as, e.g., by Themistocles (Plut. Them. 13), Nicias (Nic. 24), and Phocion (Phoc. 13).

The management of some of these revenues in the first year of the record, 334/3, was held by others: of the City Dionysia and of the Dionysia at Piraeus by the boönai (70–1, 80–1), of the Lenaia by the epimeletai of the Mysteries (74–5), and of the sacrifice to Agathe Tyche by hieropoioi in 334/3 (76–7) and in 332/1 (107–108). But all these were handled by the strategoi in 331/0. All this suggests that after 334/3 these responsibilities were being transferred from the other officials to the strategoi.59 We should not assume that the strategoi themselves made these sacrifices. The strategoi must simply be handling the funds that accrued from the sale of the skins of the many victims on these occasions.60The officials, usually strategoi, who commanded guard troops garrisoned in forts in Attica in the third century BC form a special group, and unlike other military commanders assumed a role in the religious activities of the troops they commanded and of the demes in which they were stationed.61 If we limit ourselves here to just the sacrifices they performed, we have in 235/4 the Rhamnousians honoring the Athenian Dicaearchus who had been put in charge of the garrison by the Macedonian king Demetrius. Dicaearchus at his own expense had contributed victims for the sacrifices of the Nemesia since these sacrifices had lapsed because of the war with Aratus.62 One wonders if this may in part have been an attempt to win popularity with a somewhat hostile population. About 229, immediately after Athens secured her indepen-dence from the Macedonians, the soldiers twice honored their strategoi for 59 The pattern suggests that this is a better conclusion than Kahrstedt’s claim (1936.290) that which official was involved was “belanglos und wird oft fallweise geregelt.”60 Kahrstedt (1936.289–90) attributes all these sacrifices to the strategoi, arguing that priests or other sacrificers usually received the skins of the victims as perquisites. (Parker, 2005.99 n. 33, is uncertain.) If the strategoi controlled the skins, Kahrstedt claims, they must have made the sacrifices. Priests did often receive the skins as their perquisite, but it seems that the very creation of the dermaticon fund was intended to return these rev-enues to the state, which one might see as a typically Lycurgan measure to increase state revenues. The strategoi and other officials were simply responsible as administrators to see that this was done. If they did in fact make these sacrifices, it is very surprising that they are not mentioned elsewhere in the sources for these religious activities. Why the strategoi were chosen for this task, we do not know, nor why, for example, the epimeletai of the Mysteries were at least once responsible for the revenues from the Lenaia, but on the interest of Eleusinian officials in the Lenaia, note I.

The most likely explanation is that the priest sacrificed to Zeus and Athena, and that the epimeletai were associated with Asclepius’ cult in Piraeus and sacrificed to him.87 Finally, epimeletai, along with the archon and a strategos, once participated with the ephebes in their sacrifice to Ajax on Salamis.88 It would seem that epimeletai relatively rarely themselves sacrificed, and one indication of this may be IG II3 355 of 329/8, where the extensive duties of the epimeletai of the Amphiaraia are described but there is no mention of them sacrificing nor of their εὐσέβεια which usually accompanies sacrificial activity. They are, however, to receive the customary money for a “thank-you” sacrifice.We learn from the Athenaion Politeia that there were four epimeletai of the Mysteries elected by the Demos, two from all the Athenians, and one each from the Eumolpidae and the Kerykes (57.1–4).89 IG II3 1164 of 214/3 praises two of these epimeletai, probably the two elected “from all the Athenians,” for a vari-ety of activities, including because “they sacrificed all the sacrifices which were appropriate for (καθῆκον) them in their year, to Demeter, Kore, and the other gods to whom it was πάτριον to sacrifice on behalf of the Boule, Demos, chil-dren, and women” (10–16).90 The occasions of these sacrifices were probably “thank-you” sacrifices, see below, p. 244.

In IG II2 676.10–13 of 273/2 multiple sacrifices to Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira, probably one to each, by the epimeletai are indicated.86 On Zeus Soter of Piraeus as separate from Zeus Soter in the city, see Mikalson, 1998.38–9 and Parker, 1996.238–41.87 IG II2 783.88 IG II2 1008.77 of 118/7.89 On the epimeletai of the Mysteries, see also Appendix 7.90 On this text see Deshours, 2011. 143–6 and Mikalson, 1998.182–3.

Eleusis 181 of 267/6 two epimeletai report the sacrifice which they made at the Mysteries in Agrai “for the health and safety of the Boule and Demos and others who are well-intentioned and are friends of the Demos” (7–19). In this text the epimeletai also supervised (ἐπεμ[ελή]θησαν) the sacrifice at the Great Mysteries (19–22). In IG II2 1496.74–75 the epimeletai of the Mysteries seemingly controlled the funds from the sale of the skins of victims of the sacrifices at the Lenaia in 334/3, but the next year the strategoi controlled these funds (105–6). Neither implies that these officials performed sacrifices there. The epimeletai of the Mysteries were, as so many Eleusinian officials, a special case, and other epimeletai seem rarely themselves to have sacrificed but on occasion to have participated in sacrifices performed by others.In a private cult Bacchis, the epimeletria of a thiasos of Agathe Thea, sacri-ficed at the end of her year of service (SEG 56.203.11–13). EpistataiOf the various epistatai, only two sets are known to have made sacrifices. In the long financial record of I. Eleusis 177 of 329/8 the epistatai of Eleusis primarily receive and dispense funds, as epistatai usually do, but three times they appar-ently themselves made small sacrifices, at a cost of twenty drachmas each, at the Mysteries (41–2), at the Dionysia in Piraeus (168), and at the Lenaia (244).91 In IG II2 47.28–30 of the early fourth century epistatai of the Asclepieion in Piraeus, otherwise unknown, are to sacrifice the “presacrifices” (προθύματα) which the priest directs. ExegetaiThe only recorded sacrifices by the exegetai are the eisiteteria they made, with the ephebes and their kosmetes and the priest of Demos and Charites, to the Demos and Charites at the “enrollment” (ἐγγραφαί) of the ephebes at the Prytaneion.92 They are not listed in the first surviving record of the same event in 127/6.9391 Cf. line 251.92 Perrin-Saminadayar, 2007.206–12, T26.6–8 of 122/1 and 222–6, T30.7–12 of 116/5, IG II2 1011.5–7 of 106/5, Hesp.

HieropoioiParker (2011.49 and 55), quite properly reflecting the etymology, gives for hiero-poioi “performers of sacred rites,”94 but did they in fact “perform” sacred rites? Did they sacrifice?95 The Athenaion Politeia (54.6–7) describes two boards of hieropoioi, each of ten men chosen by lot by the Demos. The one board, called the hieropoioi “for expiatory sacrifices” (ἐπὶ τὰ ἐκθύματα) makes those sacrifices ordered by an oracle (μαντευτά)96 and if there is any other need to καλλιερεῖν (“to obtain good omens”). Both, apparently, were performed with the manteis.97 The second board, the hieropoioi “for the year,” “sacrifice some sacrifices” and administer all the quadrennial heortai except the Panathenaia, and these heortai apparently include the theoria to Delos, the Brauronia, the Herakleia, the Eleusinia,98 the Hephaisteia, and, after 329/8, possibly the Amphiaraia.99 There were other such boards of hieropoioi as, for example, of the Semnai (Dem. 21.115), and those we find below.Hieropoioi, either those “for the year” or a special group just for the annual Panathenaia, in addition to other duties sacrificed to Athena Polias, Athena Nike, and Athena Hygieia.100 In 340–330 ten hieropoioi and the priest of Dionysus in Piraeus report to the Boule τὰ ἀγαθά that occurred in the sacri-fices they performed to Dionysus “and the other gods,” probably in the major Dionysiac heorte of Piraeus. For their efforts they were each awarded gold crowns and the hieropoioi received a “thank-you” offering.101 The hieropoioi of the Rhamnousian cult of Nemesis and Themis joined the strategos and the 94 As does Flower, 2015.296.95 Deshours (2011.128) terms them “commissaires chargés des sacrifices.”96 Cf. Xen. An. 6.1.22.97 There is no other record of sacrifices by these hieropoioi. On καλλιερεῖν, see Appendix 3.98 On hieropoioi for Eleusinian cults, see Clinton, 1980.282.99 It appears as though the text of the Ath. Pol. which lists the Hephaisteia after 329/8 has confused two heortai. We know, see below, that hieropoioi were involved with the Hephaisteia as early as 421/0, and that the Amphiaraia was inaugurated in 329/8. A com-mon assumption is that here the Hephaisteia was confused with the Amphiaraia, and then the Amphiaraia was wrongly omitted. But if this is so, only the Amphiaraia would have both epimeletai and hieropoioi, perhaps the epimeletai for the annual heorte, the hieropoioi for a quadrennial one. See below, p. 212. On these questions see Rhodes, 1993.610.100 IG II3 447.34–6, 42–50. As the hieropoioi “for the year,” Lambert, 2012a.83–4, or as just for the annual Panathenaia, Shear. 2001.104–5 and 451–5.

Eleusis 13).103 And hieropoioi of the cult of Hebe at Aixone also made sacri-fices to her and “the other gods.”104The two boards of hieropoioi created for the new or, more likely, reorga-nized quadrennial Hephaisteia in 421/0 were given many responsibilities including the distribution of the portions from sacrifices,105 supervision of the pompe, discipline, the torch race, and such things, but nowhere is it said that they themselves were to sacrifice.106 It was no doubt the hieropoioi “for the year” who handled the revenues from the sale of skins of victims in IG II2 1496 during the years 334/3–331/0, and these included the heortai of the Asclepieia (78–9, 109–10),107 Bendideia (86–7, 117), Eleusinia (130, 138–9), Panathenaia (98–9, 129), and Theseia (134–5) and the sacrifice to Agathe Tyche (76–7, 107–8). Handling of these monies does not, by itself, indicate that these hieropoioi sacrificed at these events.108Hieropoioi were heavily involved in the administration of several polis heortai, and occasionally they sacrificed, always as a group, sometimes the group of hieropoioi alone, sometimes in association with the priests or other attending officials. But neither the noun ἱεροποιός nor the verb ἱεροποιεῖν formed from it should, by themselves, be taken to mean that the official neces-sarily performed sacrifices.109102 I. Rhamnous II.31.17–18. Cf.

We should view these much as we do the ephebes’ attendance at the Ekklesia, as an introduction into participation into polis matters, here religious matters. In each case their sac-rifices no doubt accompanied others that were more central and traditionally and annually made by officials of the specific cult. And, it should be noted, all involved only polis cults.Of the various officials supervising the ephebes usually only the kosmetes was involved in their sacrifices,116 and clearly he supervised all their sacrificial activities. He sacrificed the eisiteteria with them (see above), and, more gener-ally, made “all the sacrifices” with them.117 Sometimes his sacrifices to specific gods are described, to Ajax, Dionysus at the City Dionysia, and Zeus Tropaios.118 Among the ephebic officials only the kosmetes was praised for his εὐσέβεια.A persistent concern was that for the ephebes and their kosmetai τὰ ἱερά be καλά (καλλιερεῖν) in their sacrifices:119 in the eisiteteria,120 at the sacrifices in the sanctuaries in the countryside,121 at the Dionysia in Piraeus and in the city,122 on Salamis,123 and more generally in “all the other sacrifices” they made.124 The ephebes may have made some of these sacrifices in other years, even in years for which we have records, but they were simply not included in the ephebic activities deemed worthy of mention.

For an archon, a basileus, an agonothetes, and once for the priest of Asclepius a different for-mula is employed.130 θυσίαι ὅσας αὐτὸν (or αὐτῷ) προσῆκεν (θῦσαι) may best be taken as “sacrifices which it was appropiate for him to sacrifice.” Given the date 125 I offer here a more specific meaning for the phrase and to whom it applies than does, e.g., Deshours (304), “les sacrifices qui conviennent.” For a nomos which may have controlled some aspects of which sacrifices “belonged” to whom, see Chapter 7.126 Of the many examples, for the prytaneis as a group, Agora 15.78.11–2 of 273/2, 115.17–19 of 234/3, and 240.15–16 of 140/39; for their tamias, Agora 15.85.1–4 of mid-III BC and IG II3 1168.44–7 of 211/0 and 1153.45–50 of 222/1.127 Some examples, of sacrifices, IG II3 1256.13–14 of 196/5, 1313.87 of 175/4, Perrin-Saminadayar, 2007.206–12, T26.15–16 of 122/1, IG II2 1011.14 of 106/5, Hesp.

Whitehead (1986.180):Aristotle distinguishes between two kinds of religious superintendence (ἐπιμέλεια ἡ πρὸς τοὺς θεούς). One comprises priests (ἱερεῖς), superinten-dents of the fabric of temples and other cult duties (ἐπιμεληταὶ τῶν περὶ τὰ ἱερὰ τοῦ σῴζεσθαί τε τὰ ὑπάρχοντα καὶ ἀνορθοῦσθαι τὰ πίπτοντα τῶν οἰκοδομημάτων καὶ τῶν ἂλλων ὅσα τέτακται πρὸς τοὺς θεούς), hieropoioi, temple guardians (ναοφύλακες), and tamiai of sacred monies (ταμίαι τῶν ἱερῶν χρημάτων). The other consists of officials who perform “all the com-munal sacrifices which the law [or custom?] does not assign to the priests” (τὰς θυσίας . . .τὰς κοινὰς πάσας, ὅσας μὴ τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν ἀποδίδωσιν ὁ νόμος) but “to those who derive their office from the common hearth” (ἀπὸ τῆς κοινῆς ἑστίας ἔχουσι τὴν τιμήν); that is, secular officials whose functions involve, inter alia, the offering of sacrifices on behalf of the whole community which they represent.If we apply Aristotle’s description of Greek practices in general to the Athenians, the sacrifices by the priests, hieropoioi, epimeletai, and agono-thetai would fall into the first category. Those “appropiate to” the prytaneis, archons, basileis, and such were those of the second type, of secular officials who performed their sacrifices in addition to their primary legislative and administrative duties.131 Private associations, but, interestingly, almost exclusively those made up of citizens (orgeones), also occasionally made use of these formulae: the orgeones of the Mother of the Gods, IG II2 1327.8 of 178/7; orgeones of Aphrodite, MDAI 66.228.4.4 of 138/7; and orgeones of an unknown deity, Agora 16.235.5 of late III BC. On citizen participation in the Aphrodite cult, see Mikalson, 1998.278. IG II2 1315.7–8 of 210/9, again of the orgeones of the Mother of the Gods, offers a slight variant, θυσίας ἃς καθῆκεν θύειν. Only one group of non-Athenians, the devotees of Aphrodite, uses one of these formulae, θυσίας ὅσας προσῆκεν αὐτῷ (IG II2 1290.6–7 of mid-III BC). The phrase is rare in literary texts, first found in Diod. S. 1.23.5, τὰς καθηκούσας αὐτῷ ποιήσασθαι θυσίας, and there the dative refers to the god, not to the sacrificer as in our texts."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���6 | doi ��.��63/97890043�9�96_006CHAPTER 4Who Reports What? What is a Report?Of the various compounds of ἀγγέλλειν, ἀπαγγέλλειν appears to be the specific term in inscriptions for making a report to the Boule or Ekklesia.1 It is used of reports by ambassadors, strategoi, and theoroi, and of the many reports con-cerning sacrifices by prytaneis and others described below.2 The ἀπαγγελίαι (“formal reports”) should be distinguished from the simple description of religious activities so common in the ephebic decrees and elsewhere.3 The distinction may be seen clearly in IG II2 1011 where the religious activities of the ephebes are described at considerable length as are their secular activi-ties, but the kosmetes reports (ἀπαγγέλλειν) on the sacrifices he made with the ephebes (lines 66–9, 75–8). After simple descriptions of religious activities, those who performed them are simply praised.Such formal reports were made first to the Boule, and the Boule then for-warded them to the Ekklesia, proposing that the Ekklesia “accept” (δέχεσθαι) them.4 The prytaneis regularly made such reports, but we learn nothing more of the procedures. But it is once said of a priest of Asclepius of 165/4 that he “approached the Boule” ([πρό]σοδον ποιησάμενος πρὸς τὴμ βουλήν) to make his report (SEG 18.22.5–7). This may indicate that some such reports, like those of the prytaneis, were expected and regular parts of the Boule’s agenda in this period, but others were occasional, initiated by individuals.1 παραγγέλλειν means “to order,” as in orders by strategoi (IG II3 316), prytaneis (IG II2 120.11), or a committee (I. Eleusis 196). ἐπαγγέλλειν is used in two contexts, of the reporting of a need to another party in the context of a treaty (IG II2 97 and R&O #6), and of the “announce-ment” of the Eleusinian spondophoroi (Agora 16.48 and 56. Cf. I. Eleusis 28a). ἐπαγγέλλεσθαι, the middle, is widely used of promises of future action (e.g., IG II2 653, 908, and 1215). For the distinction between ἀπαγγέλλειν and ἐπαγγέλλεσθαι in one text, see, e.g., IG II3 298 or I. Eleusis 196.2 Ambassadors, IG II3 298 (cf. IG II3 1147); strategoi, IG II3 1334; and theoroi, restored in IG II2 1054. The simplex ἀγγέλλειν is restored in the relatively early report by ambassadors in IG I3 227.3 For ephebic decrees, IG II3 1313, Perrin-Saminadayar, 2007.206–12, T26, IG II2 1008, Perrin-Saminadayar, 2007.222–6, T30, IG II2 1011, Hesp.

Who Reports?The first assured report of the numerous formal reports by prytaneis to the Boule concerning sacrifices they made dates to 273/2 (Agora 15.78).5 Similar reports are then attested regularly until the Roman period when they abruptly stop. The reports by the prytaneis are more numerous than all the reports of the other groups and alone are frequent enough to indicate that they were made on a regular basis.6 The priest of Asclepius also reported to the Boule concerning sacrifices, in 328/7, 244/3, 165/4, and 137/6,7 and their frequency, compared to other, non-prytany reports, is noteworthy. Twice, in 127/6 and 106/5, the kosmetes of the ephebes made a similar report of sacrifices he made with the ephebes (SEG 15.104 and IG II2 1011). The archon may, too, have made occasional reports.8 The reports of these officials are frequent enough to sug-gest occasional reports but nothing like the regular ones of the prytaneis.All other attestations suggest reports concerning a single event: the archon in 282/1; the demarch of Eleusis in 165/4; the epimeletai of the Mysteries in 267/6 and ca. 215; the agonothetes of the City Dionysia in 252/1; the priest of Amphiaraus in 273/2; the priest of Zeus Soter of the Stoa of Zeus in 272/1 (?); the priest of Zeus Soter of Piraeus and the epimeletai in 163/2; the priest of Dionysus in Piraeus and the hieropoioi in ca. 330; theoroi in 281/0 and in II BC; the priestess of Athena Polias in 255/4; the priestess of Aglauros in 250/49; and a strategos ca. 234.95 For a translation and background of this text, see Mikalson, 1998.113–16. The formula has been restored in Agora 15.76 of 279/8, and a similar report, but with λέγειν and not ἀγγέλλειν, has been restored in Agora 15.71 of 283/2. For both λέγουσι and ἀπαγγέλουσι in the same docu-ment, referring apparently to the same action, see IG II3 416.6 Naiden (2013.210) is probably correct in claiming that “No session of the Assembly could occur without the prutaneis assuring the Demos that the preliminary sacrifices had proved acceptable, so reports of this kind were even more frequent than the record suggests.”7 IG II3 359.95–7 (On this text see Schwenk #54), SEG 18.19.9, SEG 18.22, and 18.26. SEG 18.19 (Lambert, 2012.103–6, #9) contains two relevant decrees, both probably for the same priest in the archonship of Lysiades (244/3), despite the various restorations attempted.

The earliest, IG II3 359 of 328/7, and SEG 18.19 of 244/3 follow the prytany  IG II2 1000 gives such a report by a priest of an unknown god. To complete our survey of “reports,” hieropoioi or priests of private associations (κοινά) reported to fellow mem-bers their sacrifices: the archeranistes to fellow thiasotai (IG II2 1297 of 236/5) and the priestess of Syrian Aphrodite to orgeones (IG II2 1337 of 97/6). On these two cults, see Mikalson, 1998.148–9 and 277–8, and on the archeranistes, Arnaoutoglou, 1994.107–110. The demarch of Ikarion also reported to demesmen on his sacrifices (SEG 22.117.1–2 of ca. 330).10 The date of Agora 15.261 is disputed. See SEG 44.53.11 Agora 15.78 (273/2), 89 (259/8), 115 (234/3), IG II3 1139 (227/6), 1149 (225/4), 1155 (219/8), 1162 (214/3), 1165 (213/2), 1299 (181/0), 1304 (180/79 ?), 1310 (178/7), 1316 (175/4), 1324 (174/3), 1328 (173/2), 1333 (169/8), Agora 15. 219 (164/3), 238 (145/4), 240 (140/39), 243 (135/4), and 246 (131/0). As evidence here and throughout I offer only those texts where the text sur-vives wholly or sufficiently so that the restorations are certain. I do not include the many restored texts even though in most cases the restorations are highly probable. Here, how-ever, the first and last texts in the series (Agora 15.71 and 261) both depend on restorations and are not included in the list above.12 Agora 15.78, 115, and 240.

In Agora 15.115.14 τὰ ἄλλα is now properly read as τὰ ἀγαθά (Henry, 1980.94). These sacrifices suffice, by the way, to disprove Sourvinou-Inwood’s claim (1988.261) that “it appears that sacrifices for, and on behalf of, the polis are always performed by a priest.”14 The phrase for this, common in the inscriptions, is not found in the literary texts, but there δέχεσθαι is occasionally associated with oracles and omens, see, e.g., Hdt. 1.48.1, 1.63.1, 9.91.1 and Ar. Plut. 63."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" 87Who Reports What?formula, that is, that “the good things” occurred in sacrifices he made to Asclepius and associated gods for the “health and safety” of the Boule and Demos. In SEG 18.22 of 165/4 the report is that, in the sacrifices he made, τὰ ἱερά were καλὰ καὶ σωτήρια for all Athenians and for those inhabiting the cities of the Athenians. In SEG 18.26 of 137/6 the priest reports sacrifices on several occasions, at the [eisiteteria] to Asclepius, Hygieia, and “the other gods,” and at the Asclepieia, Epidauria, and Heroa, all “on behalf of the Boule and Demos,” and [τὰ ἱερά] were [καλὰ καὶ] σωτήρια.15The two forms of reports in the priest of Asclepius decrees, of “the good things” that happened and that τὰ ἱερά were καλὰ καὶ σωτήρια, are paralleled in other attested reports. “The good things” occur in the reports of the kosmetai of 127/6 and 106/5; of the archon in 282/1; of an agonothetes in 252/1; of hieropoioi and the priest of Dionysus in Piraeus. All of the above sacrifices were made to “Dionysus and the other gods.” And the epimeletai of the Mysteries gave the same report of their sacrifices at the Mysteries at Agrai, as did the priest of Zeus Soter, the priestess of Athena Polias, and the priestess of Aglauros.16 Reports that τὰ ἱερά were καλὰ καὶ σωτήρια come only, in addition to the above noted reports of the priest of Asclepius, from another priest, a hipparch, theo-roi, and the demarch of Eleusis.17Some reports are that ἀγαθά occurred in the sacrifices, others that τὰ ἱερά were καλά, and we may reasonably conclude that they refer to the same thing, i.e., τὰ ἀγαθά that are being reported are that τὰ ἱερά were καλά. This is con-firmed by the one example where both phrases are used in the same text: in IG II2 1000 the priest reports that [τὰ ἱερὰ καλὰ καὶ σω]τήρια, and the Boule accepts τὰ ἀγαθά which he reports.But what were the ἱερά that were καλὰ καὶ σωτήρια? Theophrastus’ “Man of Petty Ambition” (Char. 21) is proud that as a prytanis he got to report that the ἱερὰ were καλά at the Galaxia, and he bid the Athenians, δέχεσθε τὰ ἀγαθά. Diggle in his edition of the Characters of Theophastus (2004.125) translates this as follows: “The sacrifices were propitious.

The introduction of “blessings” here is inappropriate.19 Likewise, I think, “sacrifices” for ἱερά is wrong. I propose that in these expres-sions τὰ ἱερά are the sacrificial victims, not the ritual of sacrifice.20 In the texts where our phrase τὰ ἱερὰ . . .καλ̀ὰ καὶ σωτήρια occurs, the sacrifices are previ-ously described, all in terms of θύσιαι.21 τὰ ἱερὰ . . .καλὰ καὶ σωτήρια is a happy result of the sacrifice, not the sacrifice itself.22 It is noteworthy that we never have, for example, ἡ θυσία ἦν καλὴ καὶ σωτηρία. The sacrificial victims, τὰ ἱερά, are καλὰ καὶ σωτήρια because, when examined for omens in the course of the sacrificial ritual, as described by Van Straten, they were found to be “sound” (καλά) and showing good omens.23 These good omens in turn promise success of the sacrifice and of the accompanying prayer ὑπὲρ τῆς ὑγιείας καὶ σωτηρίας. In these phrases ἱερά should be translated as “sacrificial victims,” not as “sacri-fices.” The attention in these reports is directed to the victims and their divina-tory potential, not to the ritual of sacrifice.If τὰ ἱερά means “sacrificial victims” in the above phrases, it quite probably means the same in this extremely common formulaic statement as seen in I. Eleusis 229.14–17: τὰ μὲν ἀγαθὰ δέχεσθαι τὰ γεγονότα ἐ[ν] τοῖς ἱεροῖς οἷς ἔθυσε ἐφ ̓ ὑγιείαι καὶ σωτηρίαι. . . .24 The italicized phrase can easily be taken to mean “in the sacrificial victims which he sacrificed.” In these texts there is a clear distinction. When sacrifices themselves are being discussed, the relevant term 18 Parker in 1996.247 translates the phrase as “accept the benefits arising from the sacrifice,” but in 2005.67 as “accept the good things that occurred in the sacrifice.”19 τὰ ἀγαθά as “good things” in general is more associated with prayer, as in Hdt. 6.111, Xen. Mem. 1.3.2, Ar. Thesm. 310, Eccl. 781, Arist., frag. 532 (R3), and Ephorus, FGrHist 70 F 16.20 In contrast to the more common view that τὰ ἱερά may be both, as most recently stated explicitly by Naiden (2015.467): “In the common phrase, hiera kala, the word hiera referred not only to victims, but also to the chief features of the act.”21 SEG 18.22.7–10, 18.26.13–16, and I. Eleusis 229.6–11.22 Lambert (2002.382 n. 5), by contrast, would have ἱερεῖον as the “normal term” for “sacrifi-cial victim” and ἱερά commonly as “sacrifices,” but occasionally “doing duty for ἱερεῖον.”23 Van Straten, 1995.190–2. For his good emphasis on the “beauty” of the καλά, see Chapter 1. For more on ἱερὰ καλά, see Appendix 3.24 Of over 80 possible examples, these are sufficient to illustrate the formula. From the pry-tany decrees, IG II3 1162.15–16, Agora 15.78.8–11 and 115.14–16. From the ephebic decrees, IG II2 1011.67–9 and 77–8 and SEG 15.104.108–9, 121–3.

With ἐν τοῖς ἱεροῖς οἷς ἔθυσε, the ἀγαθά are reported. One never has ἀπαγγέλλειν τὰ ἀγαθὰ τὰ γεγονότα ἐν ταῖς θυσίαις αἷς ἔθυσαν.26 θυσίαι are “sacrifices,” τὰ ἱερά are, in these contexts, the animals sacri-ficed, and it is they which determine τὰ ἀγαθά.27In all such reports, in whichever of the two formulae, the sacrifices were made “for the health and safety of the Boule and Demos” and other parties var-iously included. One can be virtually certain that this phrase was in the prayers accompanying these sacrifices. Clearly, the Boule and Demos were interested primarily in, and wanted and accepted reports about, those sacrifices made for their own health and safety and that of the Athenian people. They wanted to know that in these sacrifices τὰ ἱερά were καλὰ καὶ σωτήρια. And, of course, it is only fitting that sacrifices for “health and safety” be reported as σωτήρια. All of this may be seen as proof and a result of the relatively new, since about 330 BC, major concern with the “health and safety” of the polis. I have discussed else-where what “health” and “safety” probably entailed in this context in Athens (1998.42–5, 132–4, 294–6) and offer here only a brief summary of that. “Health,” in these polis texts, was probably not, or not only, a matter of diseases and broken bones, matters for which individual Athenians had private access to healing gods such as Asclepius and Amphiaraus and even local heroes. It more likely was a concern for the “things necessary for a healthy life,” things such as food and other essentials which at times in the Hellenistic period were in desperately short supply. “Safety” probably did not concern so much the pres-ervation or restoration of democracy, although the specification of the Demos and Boule as beneficiaries may suggest that. Other beneficiaries were also the children and wives of the Demos, and this suggests more a personal, physi-cal safety, safety from the dangers of wars that so threatened all Greek cities in this period. Emily Kearns (1990.325) sees the areas of Greek life requiring “safety” or “deliverance” as breaking down into two groups: for the individual, death, disgrace, illness, injury, and poverty; for the city, defeat (in war), plague, 25 Agora 15.78.4–6 and 115.9–12 are only two among many possible examples of this formula, but are useful because they contain both formulae and offer clear cases for comparison. Cf. IG II2 1165.6–7.26 Even phrases like ἐν ταῖς θυσίαις and ἐν τῇ θυσίᾳ are uncommon in the literary sources (e.g., P. Isth.5.30, Isoc. 5.117, 16.34, Xen. Ages. 8.7, Pl. Smp. 197d, Ion 535d2, Rep. 5.468d) until Plutarch and even then are not in the context of divination.27 A similar distinction between θυσία and τὰ ἱερά may be seen also in Pl. Rep. 3.394a and Lg. 7.800b. The ἱερὰ ἄθυτα of Lysias 30.20 should probably be “sacrificial victims not sacri-ficed,” not “sacrifices not made.”"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"90CHAPTER 4famine, civil disturbance, and natural disasters. One can see how the phrase “health and safety” in public documents might come to be used to encompass all of the latter group.Only the prytaneis reported regularly, and they were, of course, govern-ment officials reporting on their sacrifices on mostly governmental occasions, before meetings of the Ekklesia. Other religious and lay officials reported occasionally, at best, and on only one type of sacrifice, that for the “health and safety of the Boule and Demos.” Of the hundreds of priests of Athenian cults, only priests of Asclepius and of Zeus Soter and priestesses of Athena Polias and Aglauros reported, the last two attested only once.28 Only the priest of Asclepius reported several times, appropriately, since the Boule was interested in sacrifices “for health and safety.” The Dionysus of the City Dionysia, however, is equally prominent, with sacrifices to him reported by kosmetai, the archon, and an agonothetes, and here it must be remembered that this was a major polis-financed heorte.28 Lambert’s (2012.74–5) comments that “the central act for which the priest is honoured is typically the performance of sacrifices and a report on their successful outcome,” and that “sacrificing for the health and preservation of the city is the core of a priest’s service,” may be true so far as our texts go, but are documented for only four of the hundreds of polis priests and priestesses. Horster’s claim (2010.190–1) that “Starting in the late fourth cen-tury, it seems to have become obligatory for magistrates and priests (of ‘public’ cults) to report the successful sacrifices to the boule . . .” is badly overstated.

They, the polis, sacrifice many sacrificial animals at public expense, but it is the Demos which feasts upon and divides up by lot the animals ([Xen.] Ath. Pol. 2.9).So the anonymous “old oligarch” of late V BC, in somewhat messy Greek and logic,1 complains of life in Athens.2 The evidence from IV BC indicates quite clearly that then the polis was paying, from a variety of sources, for virtually all costs of polis sacrifices, heortai, and sanctuaries as it no doubt did in V BC.3 The exception in IV BC, as we will see, is that some private individuals, as choregoi, were paying substantial amounts to support agones of some heortai. It has been commonly claimed that one of the new features of Athenian reli-gion in the Hellenistic period is that rich individuals assumed more and more of the costs of polis cult, especially of polis sacrifices, to the extent that by the end of the Hellenistic period most polis religious activities were privately financed. To test that claim, we examine in this chapter who, as public officials or private citizens, were contributing to paying which costs of polis, deme, and private cults.4We include all explicit mentions of such contributions “from own funds” (ἐκ τῶν ἰδίων) and include some others, as of choregoi, where the office entailed such contributions. Others would include virtually all references to φιλοτιμία and liturgies (λειτουργίαι) on the assumption, which I now believe mistaken, 1 On this see Frisch, 1942,254–6, and hence I offer a paraphrase rather than exact translation of the passage.2 On this pseudo-Xenophantean text, see Osborne, 2004 and Mattingly, 1997.3 Rosivach (1994) offers excellent descriptions of the large numbers, costs, and procedures for polis, deme, and other sacrifices in Athens in IV BC and of who was paying for them. There should be much of value in Pritchard’s forthcoming (2015) book on this topic.4 As to why individuals contributed, see Chapter 13.

Obviously the results would look very different if we included all such references to φιλοτιμία, liturgies, and sacri-fices. We would have a great part of all sacrificial activity in polis, deme, and private cults funded by individuals throughout our period. We, therefore, limit ourselves to explicit mentions of private contributions, usually ἐκ τῶν ἰδίων, or other clearly documented cases. Polis CultsPriests and priestesses seem rarely to have dipped into their own funds to cover the cults they served. The first certain attestation is from 237/6, when the priestess of Athena Polias was praised by the Boule for dedicating various items of clothing “from her own funds,” but dedications by priests and priestesses to 5 On φιλοτιμία and liturgies not necessarily involving personal expenses, see above, pp. 23 and 42.

The only assured examples are in late honors of ephebes: Perrin-Saminadayar, 2007.222–6, T30.14–15 of 116/5, SEG 22.110.55 of 79/8, and IG II2 1043.25–6 and 48 of 37/6 (?). The phrase has been almost entirely restored for priests of Asclepius in SEG 18.26.12 and 27.7, for the uncertainties of which restorations see Hubbe, 1959.191. Also for hieropoioi, IG II3 416.24. Simple “leading to the altar” is indicated by Perrin-Saminadayar, 2007.222–6, T30.27–8, a preliminary step to, or a different view of, the παραστήσαντες in lines 15–16 of this same text. The victims are to “stand beside the altar” (e.g., Aeschin. 3.120), and the “leading to the altar” just gets them there (as in Xen. An. 6.1.22).

An. 6.1.22.8 As an example, Lambert (2012.83) on sacrifices by non-priests: “Even where donations of vic-tims are not explicitly referred to in the text of the decrees, we may perhaps assume that the prominence of sacrifices in decrees honouring non-priestly Hellenistic officials reflects the fact that, generally speaking, this was conceived as a significant locus of their euergetism.”"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" 93Who Pays For What?the deity they served are common and not our concern now.9 More notewor-thy, if we can trust the restorations, is that she dispersed to the Praxiergidae 100 drachmas “from her own funds” for their ancestral sacrifice, probably at the Plynteria.10 That she had paid out money may be the reason that her husband is also commended in this decree (IG II2 776).11 She is the only polis priest or priestess clearly attested to have contributed personal funds for polis sacrifices to his or her own deity.12 For the years 103/2–97/6, along with many other offi-cials, numerous Athenian priests of cults on Delos, including those of Apollo, Artemis, Roma, Anios, Sarapis, Hagne Thea, Zeus Kynthios, and Dionysus con-tributed, usually 100 drachmas each, for the aparchai for the Pythaïs, the newly re-established theoria from Athens to Apollo Pythios of Delphi (SEG 32.218). Here we have, in quite unusual circumstances, priests donating to activities of a cult other than their own.Only very late, in 103/2–97/6, do we have the nine archons contributing, again for the Pythaïs to Delphi, a special event to which many others, includ-ing priests, government officials, and others contributed.13 Otherwise there are no attestations of archons as a group or as individuals contributing money to cultic activities, and in fact there are few attestations for any administrative officials.9 For example, in 235/4(?) the priest of Kalliste dedicated a stone altar “from his own funds” (IG II2 788.12–13). On this cult see Mikalson, 1998.149. On benefactions by Athenian and other priestesses, see Connelly, 2007.192–5.10 On the genos of Praxiergidae, their association with the Plynteria, and this text, see Parker, 1996.307–8.11 On this text see Mikalson, 1998.161–4.12 A very lucanose text may have a contribution by the priest of Zeus Soter for a sacrifice (IG II2 690 of 305/4 to ca. 270). Lambert (2012.84) would have the priest of Asclepius also make financial contributions, from IG II3 1386.2 and SEG 18.27.17, but the fragmentary condition of both allows no such conclusion. From SEG 18.26.12 and 27.7, Lambert con-cludes that the priest was “personally supplying the victims for sacrifices,” but the relevant phrase (παραστήσας . . . θύματα) is almost wholly restored, on the uncertainties of which see above, p. 92. Naiden (2013.216) offers in support of his claim that “Athens . . . reduced the cost of sacrifice by inducing priests . . . to spend their own money on victims and other expenses” only IG II2 776 and SEG 42.116 and 29.135, of which 42.116 is a deme decree and 29.135 a genos decree, each a quite different case from polis expectations.

In earlier times, ten epimeletai for the City Dionysia were elected, and they paid at their own expense for the cost of the pompe. By the time of the Ath. Pol., ten were chosen by lot, one from each tribe, and the polis gave to them 10,000 drachmas to cover the costs of the pompe.14 In 186/5 twenty-four epimeletai of the City Dionysia are honored for having “sent” the pompe and for having performed their other duties, and there is no explicit mention of a financial contribution.15 Among the other polis cults that had epimeletai, only the epimeletai of the Mysteries appear to have contributed their own funds.16 The most generous of these was Xenocles who had built, spending his own money, a stone bridge so that τὰ ἱερά might travel “safely and καλῶ[ς],” as well as the participants in the panegyris, and so that the residents and farmers might also be safe.17 In 267/6 the epimeletai of the Mysteries sacrificed “from their own funds” τὰ σωτήρια to Demeter and Kore on behalf of the Boule and Demos.18 The epimeletai of the Mysteries in 214/3 prepared a team of oxen for transporting τὰ ἱερά,19 sent for the Eleusinia a bull as a victim, and, more generally, spent “from their own funds” for all the other things that were appropriate for the sacrifices.20In the mid-fourth century there were at least forty-five choregoi, and before the reforms, probably under Demetrius of Phaleron, when choregoi were replaced by the single, elected agonothetes for each year, the choregoi paid from their own funds the expenses for a variety of choruses in Athenian heortai.21 Therefore honors to a choregos always assumed, without express-ing it, that the choregos had spent his own money. And for polis heortai the expenditures might be significant. In Lysias 21.1–5 we have a young man who as choregos, in different terms of office, in 411/0 spent 3,000 drachmas for 14 Ath.

During his term he spent “as a volunteer from his own funds,” sacrificed the ancestral sacrifices to the gods, gave to all Athenians all their agones, and introduced a new agon for Demeter and Kore. He supervised also the other sacrifices and agones on behalf of the city, and for all of these he spent from his own funds.24 The costs of the agonothesia might be enormous. The prominent politician Euryclides who had served as agonothetes in the last third of III BC spent 63,000 drach-mas and then more when, apparently, his son was agonothetes.25 How so much money could have been spent in one year is suggested by IG II2 968.40–55, which honors Miltiades of Marathon for, among other things, his agonothesia of just one heorte, the Panathenaia. As agonothetes of the Panathenaia shortly after 144/3 Miltiades faced a daunting task, not only to produce the heorte but to restore its finances and equipment and to repair various buildings. He gave an interest-free loan and contributed “not a little” of his own money to deal with the financial crisis. He repaired “the things needing work” on the Acropolis and in the Odeion. He gave ropes for the Panathenaic ship-cart and what else was lacking for the transport of the peplos. He did “in a grand manner (μεγαλομερῶς) all the things for the pompe and sacrifices owed to the gods,” and 22 On this “anonymous, extremely wealthy young leitourgical extrovert” and the politi-cal circumstances in which he made these and similar contributions, see Wilson, 2000.89–92.

He also gave to the Boule 1200 drachmas as their daily pay and 100 drachmas to the prytaneis for a sacrifice.28 For these and the stele he erected listing the win-ners, he spent of his own funds over 2690 drachmas.29 The agonothetes of the Theseia in 157/6 did much the same thing,30 and in 153/2 Miltiades for the same activities spent over 3390 drachmas. Both he and Nicogenes are to be remem-bered among those who “gave readily” (ἑτοιμῶς διδόντων), and each is crowned “because of the εὔνοια and φιλοτιμία which he continuously has concerning the Boule and the Demos of Athenians.”31 In the years 99/8 and 98/7 two wealthy men as agonothetai contributed 1500 drachmas, not to the heortai they served but as subscribers to the aparchai for the Pythaïs to Delphi.32For a brief period at the end of the second century the kosmetai of ephebes contributed for sacrifices involving the ephebes.

He would have the ephebes them-selves paying for the costs of their sacrificial victims, not exceptionally but de règle, and is followed in this by Lambert (2012.82) and Deshours (2011.174, 177, and 310). Perrin-Saminadayar reaches this conclusion by taking expressions such as ἐλειτούργησαν δὲ καὶ ἐν ταῖς θυσίαις ἁπάσαις as “accompli à leurs frais tous les sacrifices,” which, as discussed above (p. 23), can equally well or better be translated as “and they served also in all the sacrifices,” without the implication of financial contribution. The critical text here is SEG 15.104.19–20 of 127/6, and the critical lines read, ἐλειτούργησαν δὲ καὶ ἐν ταῖς θυσίαις ἁπάσαις εὐσεβῶς καὶ φιλοτίμως οὐθὲν ἐνλείποντες τῶν ἀναγκαίων, with, Lambert (82) claims, “the clear implica-tion being that they had funded the sacrifices.” Two points: nothing in the text indicates that the ephebes paid their own money, because ἐλειτούργησαν in this context probably reflects “services,” not financial contributions. Secondly, this text is idiosyncratic among ephebic related texts. It concerns, unlike the usual ephebic texts, the public subscription to raise funds for the Pythaïs, and if one still wishes to see a financial contribution in lines 19–20, that would be the context. The long series of other ephebic texts make no explicit mention of the ephebes contributing their own money for their sacrifices, and the kosme-tai contributed for sacrifices in only two years. The only evidence pointing to the ephebes’ financial contribution is the isolated phrase ταῦρον ἐκ τῶν ἰδίων in IG II2 1030.14, a decree honoring them in ca. 98/7. What is perhaps of more significance is the lack of the phrase ἐκ τῶν ἰδίων in the many other accounts of the ephebes’ own religious activities.36 SEG 32.218.37 On these religious communities, see Mikalson 1998.155–60.38 I.

Our last two certainly did. Theomnestus, strategos at Sunium in 219/8, built there a temple and sanctuary of Asclepius, quite likely at his own expense,42 and, most interestingly, the strategos Apollodorus at Rhamnous in late III BC gave instead of selling a plot of his land to devotees of Sarapis among his troops so they could build a sanctuary.43 In addition to the strategoi of the garrisoned troops, one trierarch, presumably just for the crew of his own ship, sacrificed at his own expense in 224/3 to Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira “for the health and safety and harmony of his fellow sailors.” For another sacrifice, to Nemesis, he contributed the victims and the wine.44 These military officers contributed their own money, but, again, in a special situation and time, and no other strat-egoi are recorded to have made such contributions of their own funds.In a different context the taxiarchs as a group are twice, in 275/4 and 271/0, honored by the polis for having made all the necessary sacrifices with the strat-egoi “from their own funds.”45Lycurgus invited a number of individuals to support the polis religious pro-gram after 336/5, including Deinias who donated land so that the remodeling of the Panathenaic stadium could be completed; Eudemus, a Plataean, who supplied 1000 teams of oxen for the same project in 330/29; and Neoptolemus who gilded an altar of Apollo in the Agora. Lycurgus also raised 650 talents on loan from private individuals, some of which he may have used for the cult of Athena Polias, including golden statues of Nike, gold and silver processional vessels, and gold jewelry for the one hundred kanephoroi.46 In 270/69 Callias of Sphettos was honored by the polis for many services, including that he had served as the archetheoros of the theoria to the first Ptolemaia in Egypt, 40 I.

The “house” had lost its door and roof tiles were broken, part of the wall had collapsed, the god’s table was broken, and the stoa was in danger of collapse. Twenty-three Athenians, styling themselves Amphieraestae, contributed money for repairs and sacrifices.51 Both of these, of the bouleutai and of the Amphieraestae, can be labeled “subscriptions” in which a number of individuals participated. They might be termed “private subscriptions” to benefit polis cults. “Public subscrip-tions,” that is subscriptions originating from the polis itself, are rarely attested for religious purposes.52 Three possible, but not certain, examples are for a sacrifice in IV BC, for the repair of an unknown sanctuary in late IV or early III BC, and for the repair of the Theater of Dionysus in Piraeus in mid-II BC.53 The certain examples are the Pythaïdes, the theoriai to Delphi from 138/7 to 98/7, new and special events. State-originated subscriptions were clearly not a significant factor in the financing of polis cults.47 On the Ptolemaia in Alexandria, see Rutherford, 2013.44, 255–8, and 267–8.48 Callias, SEG 28.60.55–62 and Sosandrus, Hesp.

They did so in various ways, through rents from deme or sacred properties, through lending capital of the deme or of cults, through taxes, and, of particular inter-est here, some through organized contributions by individuals.Two deme sacred calendars, that of the Marathon Tetrapolis (SEG 50.168) and that of Erchia (SEG 21.541), establish that, for these five demes at least, individuals in the period 375–350 (?) were paying the costs of the demes’ sac-rificial program. For the four demes of the Tetrapolis approximately 400 indi-viduals, roughly one-third of all the members, contributed amounts of 20–100 drachmas, perhaps as one-time donations to establish an endowment.54 The Erchians, apparently, took a different approach, with the deme’s annual sac-rifices divided into five groups, with one individual responsible each year for the cost of one of the groups, amounting to ca. 110 drachmas. The sacrificial calendars from the other demes do not give evidence of other such individual contributions, but it is noteworthy that, from the deme Erikeia, IG II2 1215 of early III BC seems to describe, in usual diction and grammar, a somewhat simi-lar situation in which elected deme officials, not necessarily religious officials, were expected to contribute money for the establishment and construction of sanctuaries and for the erection of dedications “for their own health and the safety of the Demos.”55Choregoi financed costs of the agones of Dionysia in the demes, and so, for example, the demesmen of Aixone in IV BC praised their choregoi Democrates and Hegesias or Leontios and Glaucon.56 In the early second century BC, the demesmen of Melite praise their priestess of the Thesmophoroi for spending 54 For this and all matters concerning this sacred calendar, see Lambert, 2000a.55 ὑπερ ὑγιείας αὐτῶ[ν καὶ τῆς τοῦ δήμου] σωτηρ[ίας].

In the mid-fourth century Damasias the Theban provided two choruses for the Dionysia at Eleusis but is not termed a choregos. That may be why it is stated that he prepared the choruses at his own expense (I. Eleusis 70.7–15).

Euthydemus sac-rificed to Dionysus “for the health and safety of the demesmen” “from himself,” at the end of IV BC. And Pamphilus in 165/4 had sacrificed at the Haloa and Chloia and to Demeter and Kore and the other gods, and he had held the sac-rifice and pompe of the Kalamaia, and “for all these things he spent not a little ‘from his own money.’ ”58In the mid-fourth century Damias, a Theban, used his own funds to provide two choruses for the Eleusinian Dionysia as a contribution to Demeter, Kore, and Dionysus.59 Salamis was not a deme, but for local cults probably func-tioned much as one,60 and the gymnasiarch of the residents of Salamis was honored in 131/0 for having put on the local Hermaia, having spent “not a little,” and for spending from his own funds more money for the olive oil than was allotted to him.61 The Salaminians in 116/5 also honored three individuals who contributed to the adornment and repair of local sanctuaries.62 Private CultsThe picture of contributions by officials in private cults is, not surprisingly, quite different. In 272/1 Agathon and his wife Zeuxion, as priestess, served the cult of the Mother of the Gods in Piraeus. They supervised (ἐπεμελήθησαν) the priesthood and the sanctuary, and they also supervised the orgeones, from their own expenditures.63 In III BC Bacchis, the epimeletria of the thiasos of Agathe Thea spent, apparently for her supervision of the sanctuary, of a throne and a table, and for setting up the torch at all the meetings, from her own funds more than twice the amount allocated to her for these purposes.64 57 Agora 16.277.6–7.

The thiasotai of the cult of Zeus Labraundos, all foreigners, in 299/8 honored their tamias who, by spending his own money, apparently for new construction in the sanctuary, “made clear the εὔνοια which he has towards the thiasotai.”69 The tamias of the orgeones of the Mother of the Gods in 178/7 spent his money for a number of cult purposes, including sacrifices and repairs to the sanctuary.70 Most interesting is Dionysius of Marathon who served not only as tamias of a koinon of fifteen prominent Dionysiastae in Piraeus but was founder or co-founder of the association. After his death he was honored in 176/5 for his many contributions, including, as tamias, building the temple, contributing 1,000 drachmas to endow the association’s monthly sacrifices, giv-ing another 500 drachmas for the cult statue, and providing various gold and silver cultic implements and dedications.71It is fitting to close this section with the cult of Asclepius on the south slope of the Acropolis and its founder Telemachus, himself possibly an Epidaurian.

In the demes, and for certain in the Marathonian Tetrapolis and Erchia, individuals did contribute money for the deme’s sacrificial program, and we see for polis cult none of the type of evidence that proves this for the demes.73 Also, the number of polis texts significantly outweighs that of deme cults, and so, proportionately, we have many more contributions by deme offi-cials than by polis officials. In private cults, naturally, priests, priestesses and other individuals contributed significantly to the welfare of their cult, again if one weighs the number of texts from private cults against the number from polis cults. What we seem to have is, essentially, three different structures for 73 For the thought that “as small communities, demes were, or sooner became, more depen-dent on the benefactions of individuals than larger ones such as the polis,” see Lambert, 2011.208. n. 10.

Useful evidence for this has been collected in Part 1, and we will draw some conclusions on these topics from that in Part 3, Acclamation and Authority. Here we focus on what emerge as the four major determinants of religious actions, what authorities the Athenians claim when they are sacrificing or performing other religious actions or are praising others for their religious actions. These are τὰ πάτρια (Chapter 6), nomoi and psephismata, together and separately (Chapter 7), and oracles (Chapter 8).1As an initial example we offer IG II2 776.10–14 in which, in 237/6, the priestess of Athena Polias was praised because she supervised [καλ]ῶς καὶ φιλοτίμ[ως] the adornment of the table for the goddess κατὰ τὰ [πάτρια], and because she supervised the other things which the nomoi and the psephis-mata of the Demos (οἵ τ[ε νόμοι καὶ τὰ ψηφίσματα τοῦ δήμο]υ) were assigning ([προσ]έταττον) her.2 We have here a distinction between κατὰ τὰ πάτρια and what the nomoi and the psephismata assign. In this section we investigate first which religious matters are determined by τὰ πάτρια, which by nomoi and psephismata together, which by nomoi and psephismata separately, and which by oracles. We seek first to determine if these authorities were used with careful distinction and consistently, as this text initially suggests, and then in Chapter 9 to investigate the relationships among them.1 I do not treat the “authorities” from which, apparently, Solon derived at least part of his cal-endar and which survive on the calendar published by Nicomachus. These included records of sacrifices from lists entitled “from the Tribe-Kings,” “from those <arranged> month by month,” “from those on no fixed day,” and “from the stelai” or “from the draft proposals.” On these see Parker, 1996.45–8.2 IG II2 776.10–14."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���6 | doi ��.��63/97890043�9�96_009CHAPTER 6Τὰ Πάτριαπάτριοι θυσίαι (“ancestral sacrifices”)A few polis sacrifices (θυσίαι) are explicitly termed πάτριοι.1 The basileus, as we have seen, “administered” (διοικεῖ) the πάτριοι θυσίαι.2 The Praxiergidae, with a subvention of 100 drachmas from the priestess of Athena Polias, sacri-ficed a θυσία πάτριος, most probably at the Plynteria.3 The agonothetai of 284/3 and of 252/1 were each praised for making the πάτριοι θυσίαι, but the recipients are not specified.4 And [Dem.] Epist. 3.31 would have Athenian πάτριοι θυσίαι made at Delphi. The context of Thucydides’ (3.58.5) mention of θυσίαι πάτριοι suggests that here they are the θυσίαι established as part of the new Eleutheria in 479 at Plataea to celebrate the Greek victory over the Persians.5 If so, they would be Panhellenic and their designation as πάτριοι in Thucydides would come only about fifty years after they were established.Making the πάτριοι θυσίαι is a component of the restoration and enhance-ment of the cult of Apollo in 129/8, and here not only will τὰ πάτρια be observed but also new, additional θύσιαι and τιμαί are decreed, and it looks as though these new sacrifices are designated as τὰ προεψηφισμένα (“the ones voted before,” that is, “the ones previously approved by nomoi or psephismata”) in distinction from the πάτριοι θυσίαι.6It appears from Lysias 26.6–8 that the sacrifices by the nine archons at the end of their term each year on behalf of their successors were also πάτρια, though not expressly termed πάτριοι θυσίαι. We note also αἱ πάτριοι εὐχαί made by the keryx at the opening of meetings of the Ekklesia (Aeschines 1.23).71 See in the orators, e.g., Lysias, 30.19–20, Isoc.7.29, and Din. 1.110. In Lysias 30.21 we have a vari-ant expression (ἅπαντα τὰ πάτρια θύεται) for πάτριοι θυσίαι. In none of these is the recipient given.2 Ath. Pol. 57.1.3 IG II2 776.18–20 of 237/6. See Parker, 1996.307–308.4 IG II2 657.38–41 and 780.14–15. The agon of the Haloa was also termed πάτριος in I.

It is rarely given, but from the Rhetoric to Alexander (2.3), attributed to Anaximenes, it would seem to be ἔθη, “customs” or “habits.”8 κατὰ τὰ πάτρια occurs first in Aristophanes (Acharnians 1000, of 425) in reference to the Choes. Next we find it in Thucydides 5.18.2, in his citation of the fifty-year treaty between Athens and Sparta in 422/1, allowing whoever wished access to sacrifice at, to go to, view, and ask for oracles κατὰ τὰ πάτρια at the “common sanctuaries” (τῶν ἱερῶν τῶν κοινῶν).9 Here it refers to Panhellenic, not specifically Athenian πάτρια.The speaker of Lysias 30.19 links explicitly to εὐσέβεια his demand “to sac-rifice κατὰ τὰ πάτρια.” The agonothetes of 282/1 was praised for supervising (ἐπεμελήθη) that all the sacrifices were performed κατὰ τὰ πάτρια,10 and here there may be a distinction from the simple performing of πάτριοι θυσίαι. The emphasis may be on “following ancestral customs” in the oversight of the sacri-fices, probably not in regard to the details of ritual—which are never specified in these texts—but in respect to the deities and the times of sacrifice, both of which could be determined by τὰ πάτρια. These sacrifices no doubt can be considered πάτριοι, and so we will consider them, but here “ancestral customs” may involve not just the fact of the sacrifice but also the appropriate deity and occasion. So, too, for the agonothetai of the Theseia of 161/0, 157/6, and 153/2 who joined in the performance (συνετέλεσεν) of the sacrifice to Theseus κατὰ τὰ πάτρια.11 Here their role in the sacrifice was apparently determined by τὰ πάτρια. Likewise the epimeletai of the Mysteries are, along with the basileus, Eumolpidae, and Kerykes, to administer the Mysteries κατὰ τὰ πάτρια.12 The demarch of Eleusis, with the hierophant and the priestesses, joined in the performance (συνετέλεσεν) of the sacrifice and pompe of the Kalamaia κατὰ 8 Cf.

In a non-religious context, see Andoc. 1.83 and [Arist.] VV 1250b17 and 1251a38–9. τὰ πάτρια ἱερά, by contrast, should usually be taken as “the ancestral sacred ‘things,’ ” referring not only to “sacrifices” and “rites” as it is usually taken, but to all “sacred matters,” as in Aeschin. 1.23 and [Dem.] 59. Fisher (2001.147) on Aeschin. 1.23 has this right: “ancestral religious matters.”9 Hornblower, 1991–2008, ad loc., notes that “it is odd to find [καὶ ἰέναι] in the second place after the infinitive verb ‘to sacrifice’ which logically presupposes the travel in question.” He then records various attempts at emendation. The reason, quite probably, is that “to sacrifice” is in religious terms the most important of the various elements and thus is given first position.10 IG II2 682.53–5.11 IG II2 956.5–6, 957.3–4, and 958.4–5.12 I.

The members of the tribe Erechtheis in the first half of the fourth century bid their priest to sacrifice to Erechtheus and Poseidon [κατὰ τὰ] πάτρια.15 The archon of the Mesogeioi sacrificed “to the gods and heroes καλῶς καὶ κατὰ τὰ πάτρια.”16 Uniquely in the many ephebic texts, the kosmetes of 122/1 sacrificed with the ephebes in their ἐγγραφαί “on the common hearth” κατὰ τὰ πάτ[ρια].17 Philippides is honored in a decree of 293/2 for having sacrificed, as basileus, the sacrifices that fell to him εὐσ[ε]βῶς καὶ κα[τ]ὰ τὰ π[άτ]ρια.18 And Euthius, the archon of 283/2, is said to have “sacrificed the sacrifices to the gods κατὰ τὰ πάτρια.”19 That the basi-leus sacrificed κατὰ τὰ πάτρια is appropriate, because in the Athenaion Politeia (3.3 and 57.1) he is assigned the τὰ πάτρια,20 but it is surprising that the archon does also because also in the Athenaion Politeia (3.3), of only a generation ear-lier, it is explicitly stated that “the archon administers no one of τὰ πάτρια but simply the ‘added ones’ (τὰ ἐπίθετα).” And the wife of the basileus is given to Dionysus as a wife and performs τὰ πάτρια τὰ πρὸς τοὺς θεούς on behalf of the polis, πάτρια that are many, sacred, and secret (πολλὰ καὶ ἅγια καὶ ἀπόρρητα) ([Dem.] 59.73).According to Demosthenes (21.51), the Athenians were ordered by the oracles at Delphi and Dodona to make choruses at the City Dionysia κατὰ τὰ πάτρια. Later Demosthenes (54) adds the “wearing of the crowns” (στεφανηφορεῖν) κατὰ τὰ πάτρια.21A few other religious activities of the polis were also expressly governed by τὰ πάτρια. The priestess of Athena Polias “adorned the table” κατὰ τὰ [πάτρια],22 and a kanephoros was “to carry the basket for the god (Dionysus) κατὰ τὰ πάτρια.23 The polis decrees, probably 440–435, that the ἀπαρχαί of grain for the Eleusinian deities are to be made κατὰ τὰ πάτρια and that three silos 13 I.

But, despite the list above, in the epi-graphical texts τὰ πάτρια are primarily associated with sacrifices, and when an individual is praised for both sacrificing and performing other religious duties like supervising a pompe or putting on agones, τὰ πάτρια are usually associated only with the sacrifices, not with the other activities.30τοῖς ἀλλοις θεοῖς οἷς (θῦσαι) πάτριον ἦν (“to the other gods to whom it was ancestral (to sacrifice)”)The prytaneis regularly sacrificed before meetings of the Ekklesia to Apollo and Artemis Boulaia and τοῖς ἄλλοις θεοῖς οἷς πάτριον ἦν from at least 259/8 to 95/4, and to these deities were later added Artemis Phosphoros and, once, Zeus Ktesios.31 This “omnibus” formula is used for a number, but a rather 24 I.

In 243/2 thiasotai of Bendis on Salamis honored epimeletai who “supervised the sacrifices” ὡς αὐτοῖς πάτριόν ἐστι (SEG 59.155.3–4), and about the same time other officials of the same cult also supervised sacrifices καθ ̓ ἃ πάτριόν ἐστι (SEG 44.60.3–4)."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" ��5Τὰ Πάτριαthe bodies which each had healed.”41 Melanthius (FGrHist 326 F 4) reports that it was πάτριον for initiates in the Mysteries to dedicate to the gods the garments in which they were initiated. Philochorus (FGrHist 328 F 67) reports that, unlike on the Acropolis today, πάτριον δ ̓ ἐστι for the Athenians that a dog not climb into the Acropolis.If it was πάτριον to sacrifice “to the other gods” with whom the primary recip-ients were associated, we may assume that it was also πάτριον to sacrifice to the primary recipients, and that these sacrifices could be termed πάτριοι θυσίαι. If so, we can draw up a list of those gods whose sacrifices were determined by τὰ πάτρια. To these and other elements we have seen to be κατὰ τὰ πάτρια we may add other sacrifices, heortai, or rituals linked to τὰ πάτρια in non-epigraphical texts: the Choes, the rituals performed by the wife of the basileus,42 the sacri-fices by the hierophant at Eleusis, practices of the parasitoi of Heracles, and a sacrifice to the Hero Archegetes, probably Erechtheus.43τὰ πάτρια in Phratries, Gene, and KoinaPhratries, gene, and koina also had their own πάτρια. Those of the phratry of the Deceleieis concerned their sacrifice to Leto (Lambert, 1993.294.T4). One of our earliest documents, IG I3 7 of 460–450, records the decision of the Ekklesia, at the request of the genos Praxiergidae, to inscribe on stone “the oracle” of Apollo and the psephismata previously made concerning them. These then are apparently listed as τὰ πάτρια and involve administrative and financial details concerning, most probably, the Plynteria or Kallynteria, but if one is πάτριον, so, too, must the other be. In a sense these would be τὰ πάτρια of both the polis and the Praxiergidae.44 Those of the genos of the Salaminioi are best attested and most abundant. In their decree of reconciliation (R&O #37 of 363/2), they are to sacrifice (25–6, 80), distribute loaves of bread (41–7), establish the oschophoroi and deipnophoroi (47–50), and give out the perquisites of a sac-rifice (63–5), all κατὰ τὰ πάτρια.45 In a similar document of reconciliation the two parts of the cult of Bendis, one in the city, one in Piraeus, sort out their responsibilities and intend that “the sacrifices to the gods and the other things 41 IG II2 772.9–13 of the archonship of Diogeiton (269/8?).42 On which see Carlier, 1984.331–5.43 Choes, Ar.

In 278/7 a koinon of an unknown goddess praised its epimeletai and grammateus who sacrificed all the sacrifices [κ]ατὰ τὰ πάτρια καὶ τὰ νόμιμα.47 The νόμιμα here surely repre-sent “laws” or “customs” of the koinon, not of the polis. About the same period the priest of another koinon of another unknown goddess sacrificed κατὰ τὰ πάτρια.48 Without knowing the deities, we cannot determine whether these πάτρια go back to a foreign country or are simply those of the koinon. IG II2 1325 of 185/4 and 1326 of 176/5 suggest that practices in these koina did not have to exist long before they were considered πάτρια. This citizen cult of the Dionysiastae had probably not existed for much more than a decade when the members were coming together to sacrifice each month to Dionysus κατὰ τὰ πάτρια.49 Finally, in 302/1 the Citian thiasos of Aphrodite Ourania held their pompe of the Adonia heorte [κ]ατὰ τὰ πάτρια, and these πάτρια were most likely foreign, those of Aphrodite in Cition.50We summarize the religious elements at least in part controlled by τὰ πάτρια in the following lists.

Firstly, τὰ νομιζόμενα is most commonly used of the burial rites for the dead, seen once in our inscriptions and often in the orators and elsewhere.52 Such rites are never termed τὰ πάτρια and are not our concern here. Secondly, τὰ νομιζόμενα occurs relatively rarely in other religious con-texts, and, when it does, τὰ νομιζόμενα are often contrasted to sacrifices, which are most often linked to τὰ πάτρια, as in the religious activities of the wife of the basileus: “so that the secret sacrifices may be made κατὰ τὰ πάτρια on behalf of the polis and so that the customary things (τὰ νομιζόμενα) may happen for the gods εὐσεβῶς and so that nothing may be done away with or innovated” ([Dem.] 59.75. Cf. 59.85);53 and as in the praise of the kosmetes in Perrin-Saminadayar, 2007.222–6, T30.10–11: “the kosmetes had spent money from his own funds for the sacrifice and τὰ νομιζόμενα.”54 τὰ νομιζόμενα seem often to refer to non-sacrificial activities, as in Plato, Symposium 176a1–4: “After Socrates and the others had reclined and dined, after they had made libations and sung of the god and (done) the other νομιζόμενα, they turned to the drinking.”55 So, too, Thucydides (6.32.1) describes the prayers before the launching of the Sicilian expedition as εὐχὰς τὰς νομιζομένας.τὰ νομιζόμενα is also used of “perquisites,” of Athena’s portion of the trib-ute collected each year (IG I3 49.14–16) and of what is owed to a priest from sacrifices (Aristophanes, Ploutos 1185).56 Lastly, τὰ νομιζόμενα may refer to the 52 I. Rhamnous II.26.14–15. For examples in orators and elsewhere, Antiph. 6.37, Isoc. 19.33, Is. 2.4, Lysias 2.9, Dem. 18.243, Aeschin. 1.13, Din. 2.18, and Plato, Menex. 249b4.53 ἵνα κατὰ τὰ πάτρια θύηται τὰ ἄρρητα ἱερὰ ὑπὲρ τῆς πόλεως, καὶ τὰ νομιζόμενα γίγνηται τοῖς θεοῖς εὐσεβῶς καὶ μηδὲν καταλύηται μηδὲ καινοτομῆται.54 Cf. the activities of the priestess of a genos, SEG 29.135.5–7.55 Cf. [Pl.] Alc. II.151b1–2. In each of the following τὰ νομιζόμενα might be linked to sacrifices, but may well be referring to other religious activities: IG I3 21.3–4, Antiph. 5.82, Lysias 63, frag. 125 [Carey], and Arist. Pol. 2.1267b33–5. The description of the activities of the hiero-poioi in Ath. Pol. 54.6–7 and “quotations” of it in much later sources offer a nice example of the change of use of these terms. Pollux, Photius, and other such late sources speak of the θυσίαι αἱ νομιζόμεναι of the hieropoioi, but the Ath. Pol., describing the same sacrifices, does not label them νομιζόμεναι.

In short, τὰ νομιζόμενα and τὰ πάτρια appear to refer to quite different religious activities.57τὰ νόμιμα (“the customary things”)τὰ νόμιμα and related expressions, e.g., νόμιμόν ἐστι, are rare in these documents. The one sure example in polis documents is revealing. In IG II3 1313.15–17 of 176/5 νόμιμόν ἐστι is used of the ephebes’ usual garlanding of the public tomb at the city (πολυανδρεῖον πρὸς τῷ ἄστει) and of holding a “tomb-contest” (ἐπιτάφιος ἀγών) there. Here it is a matter of νομιζόμενα for the dead, not πάτρια.58 Otherwise in polis texts it occurs only in reference to oaths.59 One example is from a Delphic Amphictyonic decree of 117/6, a copy of which was set up in Athens.60 The demesmen of Piraeus speak of sanctuaries into which it is νόμιμον for only the demesmen to enter.61 We have already seen a koinon of an unknown goddess in 278/7 praise their epimeletai and gram-mateus who sacrificed [κ]ατὰ τὰ πάτρια καὶ τὰ νόμιμα, a collocation not found elsewhere in a religious context.62 Again, demes and koina were more casual in the use of some of these terms. τὰ νόμιμα and related expressions are very common in historical, oratorical, and philosophical texts, sometimes in a reli-gious context,63 but this usage seems not to have carried over to official polis documents.linkage here between τὰ νομιζόμενα and τὰ πάτρια may be explained by the fact that this is a decree of the genos, and such decrees by gene and private associations are more casual in their expression than are state decrees (R&O #37.41–3). In 7.29 Isocrates may bring together τὰ πάτρια and τὰ νομιζόμενα for the purposes of variatio.57 The phase τῶν νομιζομένων πατρίων of [Dem.] 59.79 (cf. 59.85) should perhaps be taken as “of the things thought to be πάτρια.” There is not here a linkage of τὰ νομιζόμενα that we have been discussing and τὰ πάτρια, but the interesting point emerges that some things are τὰ πάτρια and others are thought to be.58 For restorations of the terms see, e.g., IG I3 7.10 and 131.10 as restored in SEG 13.4 and Agora 16.67.1.59 ὁ νόμιμος ὅρκος as in IG II2 116.19–20.60 IG II2 1134.35.61 IG II2 1214.15–17.62 IG II2 1277.7–8.63 As in [Dem.] 59.78 and Lycurg.

Thereafter, nomos was restricted to rules of both general and permanent validity, psephisma being used to describe temporary regulations and those applicable only to individuals; no pse-phisma could override a nomos, and nomoi could no longer be changed by simple majority vote, but only by means of a nomothesia, an elaborate and time-consuming procedure in which the assembly had no final say.This admirably lucid and concise statement of the relationship of nomoi and psephismata by Todd (1996.122–3) clears much of the terminological and histo-rical ground for the following discussion of nomoi and psephismata in religious contexts.1 The question I pose in this section is what elements of Athenian polis religion were governed by nomoi and psephismata individually or together.2 Given Todd’s distinctions of nomoi and psephismata before and after 403 BC, 1 For the procedures of nomothesia after 403, see now Canevaro, 2013.2 For a general survey of the distinctions and questions on this issue, see Rhodes, 1987. See also Lambert, 2012a.58–60 and 80 n. 65. Rhodes (2009) also offers a valuable collection of Athenian legislation on religious cults in V and IV BC, as does Lambert (2012a.48–92) for 352/1–322/1. Both should be consulted for the texts below. I would not presume to claim that I have found all legislation on religious matters for the period covered, but I think my collec-tion is at least representative. I avoid the term “sacred laws.” In Athens as in other Greek states some nomoi concerned religious matters and some profane matters (in Greek, τὰ ἱερά vs. τὰ ὅσια) but both they and similar psephismata followed the same legislative process and had the same force. For this correction of usual modern terminology, see Parker, 2004 and 2005a. esp. 61–63 and Deshours, 2011.33. For the long history of the question, see Petrovic, 2015.

For reasons that will become clear, I separate out as a distinct category the nomoi that later Athenians believed to be those of Solon. For ease of cross-reference within this chapter and in Chapter 9, I number the nomoi (N), the psephismata (PS), the nomoi/ psephismata (N/PS), and the nomoi of Solon (NS). The Nomoi of SolonLysias 30, Against Nicomachus, offers the best evidence for the Solonian nomoi.3 Nicomachus and his fellow anagrapheis were charged with “writing up” the Athenian nomoi at the end of the fifth century. These nomoi included those of Solon, and a part of their work was recording those nomoi [NS 1] that con-cerned sacrifices. Following their work, the Demos, apparently by a psephisma [PS 1], voted to follow their recommendations, to sacrifice both those sacrifices from the Solonian kyrbeis and those “from the stelai” (30.17). We learn of none of the recipients of these sacrifices from the Solonian kyrbeis and “from the stelai,” but clearly some major sacrifices central to polis cult were controlled by the nomoi of Solon.4 It is most likely that nomoi concerning the basileus and his religious role were Solonian or pre-Solonian, as in the following examples. An early (418/7) psephisma [N/PS 1] of the polis concerning the renting of the sanctuary of Codrus and Neleus refers to “the nomos [NS 2] which is estab-lished about precincts (περὶ τεμενῶν).” The activity controlled by this nomos is that the basileus is to record the renter, the price, and the guarantors, much like the provisions for transfer of funds earlier described as κατὰ τὸν νόμον.5 This is probably the nomos referred to in Dem. 43.58: “those who do not pay term them “sacred” either. For the more usual, expansive use of the term “sacred laws” and the many subjects they treat, see Lupu, 2005.3–111.3 On the difficult question of whether the nomoi of Solon were actually his or were just believed to be so by fourth-century Athenians, see the Introduction, p. 15.4 A significant number of sacrifices must have been involved. The prosecutor claims that in the previous year sacrificial animals “from the kyrbeis” costing three talents were not sacrificed as they should have been (30.20). On Lysias 30, the sacrifices, and τὰ πάτρια here, see Chapter 7. On the Solonian sacred calendar, see Parker, 1996.43–55.5 IG I3 84.14–18, 23–5. On this text see Carlier, 1984.329 n. 30. The sacrifice to Ion on the calen-dar of the Salaminioi seems to include victims which the state gave ἐκ κύρβεων, that is, from the old nomoi of Solon (R&O #37.87).

And Aeschines (1.23) claims that it was a nomos [NS 5] of Solon that put reli-gious matters (περὶ ἱερῶν τῶν πατρίων) as the first agenda items for meetings of the Ekklesia.8 In the same passage Aeschines terms the prayers of the herald before meetings of the Ekklesia πάτριοι, and Demosthenes describes them as “assigned by a nomos,” and adds that they also opened meetings of the Boule. The combination of the two passages allows the conclusion that these prayers were assumed to be the product of a nomos [NS 6] of Solon.9There are a number of possibly, indeed probably, Solonian nomoi from various other sources. The speaker of Lysias 26.6 claims that on the day of the sacrifice to Zeus Soter it is impossible to hold the lawcourts contrary to the nomoi. The Athenians rarely held lawcourts on their days of heortai and sacrifices,10 and the speaker here is focused on only one day and one sac-rifice, but perhaps the nomoi [NS 7] determined or formalized this for a whole number of polis religious events. Aeschines (3.176) claims that the lawgiver, 6 On the nomos περὶ τῶν τεμενῶν see Behrend, 1970.59–60.7 Aristotle (Pol. 6.1322b26–9), in describing Greek practices in general, writes of the nomos which assigns some sacrifices not to priests but to government officials. If one wishes to apply this to an Athenian context, it may be a nomos of Solon or earlier nomoi which assigned certain sacrifices to the basileus. See Mikalson, 2010.103–4 and Carlier, 1984.370–2.8 On this, see p. 191. Schwenk #18 as usually restored would uniquely have unspecified activ-ities of certain hieropoioi controlled by nomoi, but Lambert (2012a.15–22) has shown that the honorands of this text were not hieropoioi, in part because “there is no suggestion, in the wording justifying the honours, that the duties performed had been of a religious nature.” See his text in IG II3 327.9 Cf. Din. 1.47, 2.14 and 16, and Dem. 18.282 and 23.97.

And not only privately, but also the gene together, the Eumolpidae and Kerykes and all the others.” We treat this nomos and its provisions, often misunderstood, separately in Chapter 11 when we investigate the range of polis control over priests and priestesses, but here note that it included priests appointed by the gene and the gene that appointed them. And, perhaps not this specific nomos, but other nomoi concerning such audits went back to Solon, some perhaps to Draco.15Another nomos [NS 12] attributed to Solon (Ruschenbusch, #76a) may help to understand the relationship of the polis to private cults: it states that whatever arrangements various secular and religious associations, including orgeones and thiasotai, may make for themselves are valid (κύριον) unless “written documents of the Demos” (δημόσια γράμματα) forbid them. This can be and is generally taken to mean that such associations had autonomy in their internal affairs so long as they did not contradict polis nomoi, but there are many questions about the text and its date.16The following nomoi also have a Solonian flavor.

About this nomos the speaker claims, “You established as law (ἐνομοθετήσατε) these writings so revered (σεμνά) and showing εὐσέβεια, making acting with εὐσέβεια towards Demeter and Kore and towards the other gods of great importance.”18 Similar are those described by Demosthenes (22.73), that a man who has prostituted himself may not go into the sanctuaries [NS 15], and by Aeschines (1.188) that one cannot win a priesthood by allotment if he “is not pure in the body as defined by the nomoi (ἐκ τῶν νόμων)” [NS 16]. So, too, [Demosthenes] 59.85–6 describes a nomos [NS 17] that forbids an adulterous woman from entering any of the public sanctuaries, from seeing, sacrificing, and doing any of τὰ πάτρια “on behalf of the polis.” Nomoi / Psephismata before 403 BCThe “laws” of Solon are always, understandably, termed nomoi, never psephis-mata. In the period from ca. 500 until 403, psephismata become common in our texts, but there seems to have been no distinction made between nomoi and psephismata, and the terms are used interchangeably. In our texts such legislative actions of the Ekklesia in this period are termed psephismata at the time they were enacted but are usually referred to as nomoi in retrospect, as in N/PS 8–14, 16, and 17 below. But for this period we should make no distinction between the nature or authority of legislative acts that are described in our texts as nomoi or psephismata, and we treat them as the same thing. About Priests and PriestessesBy a psephisma [N/PS 2] (IG I3 35) of ca. 448, the Athenians apparently rede-fined the selection of the priestess of Athena Nike, making it now by lot from all Athenian women, and provided her (a salary of ?) fifty drachmas and 17 The date suggests that the speaker is citing the version of the nomos published by Nicomachus in the republication of the nomoi.

About SacrificesBefore the battle of Marathon the Athenians had vowed that they would sac-rifice to Artemis Agrotera each year as many she-goats as the Persians they killed. After they killed “countless” numbers of Persians (about 6400 according to Herodotus 6.117), Plutarch (Mor. 862c) has the Athenians, by a psephisma [N/PS 5], ask the goddess that they sacrifice only five hundred she-goats each year.21 Here, uniquely, an Athenian psephisma serves as a request to a deity to modify the terms of a vow.The very fragmentary IG I3 136 of 413/2 (?) is a psephisma [N/PS 6] treating major elements of the cult of Bendis.22 It describes prayers, sacrifices, aparche, the statue of Bendis, a pannychis, the priest, dispensation of perquisites, and some financial arrangements.IG I3 130 of ca. 432, records a psephisma [N/PS 7] by which a sacrifice is to be made to Apollo at Phaleron, a fee of one drachma per ship is levied on those anchoring at Phaleron and is to be paid to the god, and five hundred drachmas are to be spent for construction. About HeortaiThe Panathenaia and the Dionysia and most other heortai were surely, in the form we know them, post-Solonian, and so, too, the legislation that formed them.

From this speech which Demosthenes wrote against Meidias in 347/6 we learn of several nomoi concerning the chore-goi, choruses, and other aspects of the City Dionysia.24 In the course of the speech Demosthenes has read out or discusses a number of nomoi, includ-ing: 1) the nomos of Euergus [N/PS 10], dated to the first half of IV BC, which forbade legal proceedings, distraint, or the collection of overdue debts during the City Dionysia, the Dionysia in Piraeus, the Lenaia, and the Thargelia, all heortai with choral performances (21.10–11);25 2) a nomos [N/PS 11] concerning the allotment of choice of flute players to choregoi by the archon (21.13); 3) a nomos [N/PS 12] concerning challenges to chorus members as non-Athenians (21.56–7);26 4) a nomos [N/PS 13] establishing a special session of the Ekklesia, in the theater of Dionysus immediately after the heorte, in which anyone could file a complaint concerning the archon’s handling of the heorte or concerning any individual who committed an act of ἀδικία or ἀσέβεια during the heorte.27 If the Ekklesia voted in favor of the complainant, the matter was referred to the law-courts (21.8–9).28 To these we may add a nomos [N/PS 14] that bid metics to carry trays and their daughters hydriai and parasols.29 The display of surplus collected tribute in the theater during the heorte was ordered by a psephisma [N/PS 15].3023 On this see Shear, 2001.365–8 and 524.24 On this speech, see MacDowell, 1990. Harris (1989) argues against MacDowell (23–8) that it was in fact delivered by Demosthenes. For more on the speech and an annotated trans-lation, see Harris, 2008.75–166.25 Harris (2013a.216–23), however, shows the numerous problems with this nomos, surely a forgery, in opposition to MacDowell (1990. 230–1) who thinks it genuine.26 On this nomos and the procedures, see MacDowell, 1990.275–7.27 ἀδικεῖν περὶ τὴν ἑορτήν, 21.180, and ἀσεβεῖν περὶ τὴν ἑορτήν, 21.199.

These hieropoioi are to handle the sacrifices, the distribution of meat, and unruly participants. They are also to supervise the torch race and the prizes.

The psephisma [N/PS 25] of IG I3 64A of 440–415, probably ca. 424/3, concerns the designing of the Athena Nike temple, including the provision that the Boule send a probouleuma to the Ekklesia on matters about funding.37The psephisma [N/PS 26] in IG I3 82 of 421/0 on the Hephaisteia included a provision that the Boule have built the altar for Hephaestus (36–8). About the Cult of Demeter and Kore at EleusisEleusis was more than any other sanctuary under polis control, and the legisla-tion reflects that. I. Eleusis 13 of ca. 500, our earliest psephisma [N/PS 27], found at Eleusis, orders the hieropoioi of the Eleusinians to make specific sacrifices to various Eleusinian deities, probably as preliminaries to the celebration of the Mysteries themselves. This text may be an addition or amendment to a nomos of Solon, perhaps of his calendar.38 The surviving portion of I. Eleusis 30 of ca. 432/1, found at Eleusis, records an amendment [N/PS 28] to a larger, lost psephisma and concerns the election, pay, duties, and term of annual epistatai at Eleusis, who are now to oversee annual revenues that came to sanctuaries of Demeter at Eleusis, Athens, and Phaleron and the collection of debts. The latter involved participation of the Boule.39 I. Eleusis 41 of 422/1 records a psephisma [N/PS 29] to build a bridge at state expense over one of the Rheitoi, small lakes on the road from Athens to Eleusis, so that “the priest-esses may carry τὰ ἱερά as safely as possible.”40It was πάτριον for Athenians from earliest days, surely well before Solon’s time, to give a tithe of their annual grain harvest, an aparche, to the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Eleusis.41 In the mid-430’s the polis [N/PS 30] revised 37 On this text see Mark, 1993.108–10, 138–40.38 On this and on the whole text, see Clinton, 2005–2008.II.32–7.39 On this text see Clinton, 2005–2008.II.53–8.40 On this text see Clinton, 2005–2008.II.62–3.41 On all matters concerning this aparche, and on the inscriptions treated below, see Clinton, 2005–2008.II.5–7, 45–53, and 133–5."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" 129Nomoi and Psephismataa number of provisions concerning the aparche, including among other things the determination of the amount (for demes, 1/600 of the barley produced and 1/1200 of the wheat) and, most notably, the requirement that all allied states make the aparche and the request that all Greek states do it.42 This was not, however, an ordinary psephisma. It called for the publication of a report of a specially appointed committee, the syggrapheis. The syggrapheis here appear to be functioning almost as the later nomothetai.43 It is worth noting that I. Eleusis 28a.24–26 refers not to a prior nomos but to τὰ πάτρια and a Delphic oracle, perhaps recent, regarding the aparche.In ca. 415, probably by a psephisma [N/PS 31], the Athenians proclaimed a reward of 6,000 drachmas if anyone killed Diagoras the Melian who had “denigrated” and “made public” the Mysteries, or 12,000 drachmas if someone brought him live back to Athens. The psephisma was recorded on a bronze stele.44 The Athenians also voted by psephismata [N/PS 32] to offer rewards to those who gave information on the profanation of the Eleusinian Mysteries in 415, the first by Cleonymus offering 1000 drachmas, the second by Peisander offering 10,000. And at the agon of the Panathenaia that year Andromachus received the 10,000, Teucrus the 1,000 (Andoc. 1.27). At the same time Isotimides proposed and had passed a psephisma [N/PS 33] which prohibited from the sanctuaries those who had performed and confessed to an act of asebeia (1.71–2).Plutarch (Per. 32.1–2) is the sole source for a psephisma [N/PS 34], proposed by the seer Diopeithes just before the Peloponnesian War, that those should be brought to trial who “did not respect the divine things in the traditional ways” (τοὺς τὰ θεῖα μὴ νομίζοντας) or who “taught accounts about the things above the earth” (λόγους περὶ τῶν μεταρσίων διδάσκοντας). Obviously this psephisma is critical to an understanding of Pericles’ relationship with Anaxagoras and of Socrates’ trial, but doubts have been raised about its language, about whether it was ever passed, and whether it is a late fabrication.4542 I.

When nomoi and psephismata are paired, nomoi are, not surprisingly in this period, always given the first position. In 213/2 the ephebes are praised for sacrificing to the gods, “following ([ἀκολούθως]) the nomoi and the psephis-mata” [N 1+PS 2].46 These sacrifices included the eisiteteria and those at the ἐγγραφαί,47 but in IG II2 1011.5–7 of 106/5 these specific sacrifices are governed by psephismata alone [PS 3].48 In IG II3 1313.5–9 of 176/5 the ἐγγραφαί are κατὰ τὴν τοῦ δήμου προαίρεσιν (“according to the policy of the Demos”), an unusual phrase in this context, but the ephebes make their other sacrifices “following the nomoi and psephismata [N 2 + PS 4].”49 Depending on a restoration, in 127/6 all their races in the various agones, their torch-races, and pompai may have been dictated by nomoi and psephismata [N 3 + PS 5] (SEG 15.104.12–15). In the same text their display in weapons at the Theseia and elsewhere was also dictated by nomoi and psephismata (17–18) [N 4 + PS 6]. That these terms are not being used indiscriminately is suggested by the fact that their regu-lar dedication of a phiale to the Mother of the Gods was controlled by only a psephisma [PS 7].50 A similar distinction is seen in the prytany psephismata, where many of the prytaneis’ secular activities were determined by nomoi and psephismata [N 5 + PS 8],51 but their sacrifices were determined by τὰ πάτρια.52 In 282/1 the archon Euthius is praised for having “sacrificed the sacrifices to the gods κατὰ τὰ πάτρια,” having supervised the pompe for Dionysus φιλοτίμως, “and having done all the other things concerning his office “honestly and obey-ing the nomoi and psephismta [N 6 + PS 9] of the Boule and Demos.”53 Here we may also note the honors given to the priest of Asclepius in 284/3. He sacri-ficed καλῶς κα[ὶ] φιλοτίμως the sacrifices on behalf of the Demos of Athenians, and also, oddly, supervised the allotment of jurors and all the other things the 46 IG II3 1166.15–16.

He did these latter activities δικαίως καὶ κατὰ το[ὺ]ς νόμους, and the text would suggest the nomoi and psephismata affected only his allotment of jurors and perhaps “the other” secular tasks he may have been assigned by the polis.54Sure examples of both nomoi and psephismata controlling a religious activ-ity are, thus, only some ephebic sacrifices, pompai, and displays in armor at heortai. Possible, but unlikely, are also some unnamed religious activities of the priestess of Athena Polias and of the priest of Asclepius.55 Nomoi after 403 BC About HeortaiAfter 403 new nomoi required nomothetai, and in our texts they appear only when major new developments occur in the religious realm. When Oropus was given to Athens by Philip in 335, Athens gained control of the sanctu-ary of Amphiaraus and instituted a new quadrennial heorte there. In 332/1 Phanodemus was honored for the work he did as a nomothetes in this mat-ter, “in order that the penteteris and that the other sacrifices to the gods in the sanctuary of Amphiaraus become as beautiful as possible,” and he also provided revenues for these things and for the repair of the sanctuary [N 8].56 A psephisma [PS 11] of three years later refers to the pompe for Amphiaraus, the athletic and equestrian agones, the ἀπόβασις, and all the other things concerning the panegyris “which the Demos assigned (προσέταξεν) to the epimeletai of the heorte.” This all clearly refers to the content of Phanodemus’ nomos. Later in the text the Ekklesia seemingly plans to amend the nomos: “at the first (meeting of the) nomothetai to propose an additional nomos [N 9] for the tamias, that the tamias of the Demos give the thirty drachmas, which it was said in the nomos to give to the one chosen to watch over εὐταξία, to those 54 IG II2 1163.5–13. Cf. IG II3 359.13–15.55 In Agora 16.270 of ca. 184/3 (?) it is not clear that the nomoi and psephismata concern religious activities of the hipparchs. So, too, it may have been secular duties of the archon of the Mesogeioi that were controlled by nomoi and psephismata (IG II2 1245 of 275/4).56 IG II3 348.10–17. On this text see Lambert, 2011.209 n. 29. It is usually assumed that Phanodemus was the only nomothetes involved. That is, however, not necessarily so. The decree honors him for his work as a nomothetes and does not exclude that he worked with others. Lambert (2012a.44 n. 84) thinks Phanodemus may have proposed the nomos to the nomothetai."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"132CHAPTER 7chosen to watch over the agon.”57 All this suggests how detailed the nomos of Phanodemus was, at least in financial matters.IG II3 447 of ca. 335–330 offers what appears to be a new nomos (1–25) [N 10] and a psephisma (26–62) [PS 12] concerning the use of revenues from a newly acquired piece of land called Nea. The nomos, whose purpose is that the sacrifice to Athena at the “small Panathenaia” be as beautiful as possible and that the revenue from the new land be as much as possible, prescribes only the details of renting the property. The psephisma, by contrast, gives detailed orders to the hieropoioi of the heorte on what sacrifices are to be made to which deities, which portions the various participants are to receive, how the revenues from Nea are to be used for various sacrificial victims, and offers guid-ance on some more general matters concerning the pannychis and the pompe.58 The ending of the psephisma is lost but probably prescribes the election of the hieropoioi. If in fact the first part of IG II3 447 is a nomos and the second part a psephisma, as most assume,59 then this text may be our best single example of how nomoi and psephismata treated somewhat different areas of religious matters. The nomos concerns primarily the revenues and financial matters; the psephisma the matters of deities, sacrifices, and other elements of the heorte.For Amphiaraus the nomothetai needed to create a new heorte. They laid out the basic structure of the heorte and provided funding for it. In the second case the “small Panathenaia” already existed, and the nomothetai were con-cerned only with the funding. In neither case do the nomoi seem to concern themselves with ritual details. That was left, if not to the cult personnel, to the psephismata. The question for now is left open whether the distinctions sug-gested here between a nomos and a psephisma hold true elsewhere.A late life of Lycurgus ([Plut.] X. Orat. 841f–842b) attributes nomoi on reli-gious topics to Lycurgus: one [N 11] renewing a defunct agon of comedies for the Lenaia; and one [N 12] creating a dithyrambic agon for a festival of Poseidon in Piraeus, with cash prizes for the winners. Finally we have his nomos central to establishing the tragic canon, as an element of the agones of the Dionysia, a nomos [N 13] to have made bronze images of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides and to store their texts in the public archives and to require actors to follow these authorized texts.57 IG II3 355.11–20, 39–45.

This nomos was passed but apparently was soon repealed.60 Noteworthy here is the event which the speaker of Dem. 24.27–29 describes. He charges that Timocrates introduced a psephisma [PS 13] which illegally ordered that on the following day nomothetai be seated “on the pretext of the Panathenaia.” By the psephisma, which passed, the nomothetai were to consider “the admin-istration” (τὴν διοίκησιν) of the Panathenaia, but, according to the speaker, they took up only unrelated matters and apparently no nomos concerning the Panathenaia resulted. About Cult of Demeter and Kore at EleusisWe have more nomoi for the Eleusinian cult of Demeter than for any other religious activity, and that reflects the particular interest of the polis in the Mysteries, the aparche of grains, and the administration and financing of both. Most complete, though fragmentary in many sections, is I. Eleusis 138 [N 15] of 380–350, more probably 353/2–348/7. This nomos treats the announce-ment of the Mysteries and the selection and sending of the spondophoroi to the other Greek cities, their reception, and their report; the Sacred Truce surrounding the festival; regulations concerning the initiation preliminary to participation in the Mysteries; the appointment and duties of the epimel-etai; the duties of the exegetes; the selection of the hearth-initiate; and regula-tions pertaining to the initiates and pompai and legal procedures for various infractions; and the responsibilities of the epistatai.61In 353/2 nomothetai revised [N 16] arrangements of this same institution, and they are here expressly revising “the nomos of Chaeremonides about the aparche.”62 This nomos [N 17] of Chaeremonides may have only slightly pre-dated the nomos of I. Eleusis 142, and, if so, we may see essentially one brief period of nomothesia adjusting the aparche to the new, limited political cir-cumstances of Athens as well as the provisions of I. Eleusis 138. In terms of nomoi and psephismata, the aparchai to Demeter and Kore are regulated by three elements: τὰ πάτρια, perhaps going back to the nomoi of Solon; the ora-cle of Delphi; and a series of nomoi. It is noteworthy that the nomos of 353/2 60 On all elements of this nomos and oration, see Kremmydas, 2012. On repeal of the nomos pp. 58–60 and Harris, 2008.20–21.

Eleusis 142.10–13).63Some apparent nomoi concerning Eleusis appear also in the orators. Andocides describes a πάτριος νόμος [N 18] on a stele that concerned the pen-alty for putting a suppliant bough in the Eleusinion during the Mysteries (1.110 and 115–16). This may be a citation from I. Eleusis 19 which, whether a nomos or not, looks to be an earlier version of the type of regulations outlined in I. Eleusis 138 of nearly one hundred years earlier.64 Lycurgus proposed a nomos [N 19] not allowing women to ride on wagons to Eleusis for the Mysteries, a law which his own wife broke ([Plut.] X. Orat. 841f–842b). About Sanctuaries and DedicationsThe fragmentary state of IG II3 445 of ca. 335 makes interpretation difficult, but it records a new nomos [N 20] establishing various forms of new kosmos for the Panathenaia and a number of deities, including Zeus Soter, Demeter and Kore, Zeus Olympios, Dionysus, Athena Itonia, Agathe Tyche, Amphiaraus, Asclepius, and Artemis Brauronia. The major concern of this nomos is the mak-ing of the dedications, sources of funds, the officials responsible, and Delphic approval of the innovations. Lines 1–12 may be either another nomos65 or a psephisma detailing punishments for violators of the following nomos and providing for the inscription of the text. Lycurgus probably proposed the new nomos at a meeting of the nomothetai, and it is closely related to his extensive religious program.66The very detailed nomos [N 21] concerning the rebuilding of the walls after Chaeronea included also a provision that 500 drachmas be given to the Boule for a dedication, probably after the work was completed (IG II3 429.37–8).Financial concerns are also prominent in the nomos [N 22] issued ca. 300–250 by nomothetai concerning the sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron, “so that the temple and the things in the sanctuary of the goddess of Brauron may all be safe and sound.”67 It ordered various polis officials, mostly financial ones, to examine the listed buildings and to make and publish an inventory of altars, tables, and “the other things.” The architect “for sacred (buildings)” is to go to 63 For a different interpretation of these lines, see Clinton, 2005–2008.II.133.64 See Clinton, 2005–2008.II.38–43.65 As is commonly claimed.

Nomoi Concerning Secular Activities of PriestsWe saw in IG II2 1163.8–13 that for the priest of Asclepius nomoi and psephis-mata may have affected only his allotment of jurors and perhaps other secular tasks he may have been assigned [N 7 + PS 10]. So, too, in IG II3 359.12–19 of 328/7 nomoi [N 23] may concern only the priest’s secular activities, including maintaining “good order” in the neighboring Theater of Dionysus for which he is praised. But whatever the exact situation, the priest of Asclepius, who also had regularly to report to the Boule on his sacrifices,68 was more subject to polis nomoi than any other priest of whom we have record.69 The nomoi and psephismata (restored) of IG II2 776.13–14 [N 23a and PS 14a] may have also directed only secular activities of the priestess of Athena Polias. Psephismata after 403 BC About SacrificesMost of the psephismata of the polis concerning sacrifices occur in decrees honoring prytaneis, priests, or various lay officials who made them. Preliminary to the actual praise of the official is the declaration that the Demos, on recom-mendation of the Boule, accepts the “good things” that these officials reported concerning the sacrifices they made “for the health and safety of the Boule and Demos” and various others.70 The two largest attested interventions of the polis into sacrificial activities are motivated by some major innovations. We have already seen the instructions on sacrifices, the victims, the dei-ties, and the recipients of portions for the annual Panathenaia given to the hieropoioi by the psephisma [PS 12] of the 330’s.71 Another psephisma [PS 15] 68 On which see Chapter 4.69 So, too, the nomoi affecting the archon, although they are present in a document pri-marily describing his religious activities, may deal with only his secular responsibilities (IG II2 668.15–17 of 282/1).

The Demos voted that, among many other things, the basileus, archon, and strategoi sacrifice each year new sacrifices to Apollo, sacrifices in addition to those already determined by earlier psephismata (ἐπὶ τοῖς προεψηφισμένοις, line 24). Other individuals are also ordered to sacri-fice on various other occasions, including priests and priestesses, the herald of the Areopagus Council, the thesmothetai, the tamiai of the stratiotic and grain funds, the tamias of the Boule, and the prytaneis.72 These two psephis-mata ordered that the sacrifices should be made and sometimes described the financing, the victims, and the distribution of the meat. Nothing of the ritual is specified.These major interventions of the polis into sacrificial and cult matters through a psephisma must, to judge by other evidence, be seen as exceptional.Other psephismata concern individual sacrifices. In the early fourth century a priest of Asclepius, of the sanctuary in Piraeus, recommended the sacrifice of new prothymata. The Demos votes [PS 16] on the revenue source and the dis-tribution of the meat.73 Aeschines (3.187) reports the psephisma [PS 17] which Archinus proposed in 403/2 to honor with a crown the patriots who marched from Phyle and eventually overthrew the Thirty Tyrants and restored the democracy, and to give to them 1000 drachmas for a sacrifice and dedications.74 In 339 after some victories over Philip II the Athenians by psephismata [PS 18] held celebratory sacrifices and pompai (Dem. 18.216–18).75 In 304/3 the Demos passed a psephisma [PS 19] to create sacrifices “on behalf of those who were campaigning” to Athena Nike, Agathe Tyche, and the Soteres (here Antigonus Monophthalmus and Demetrius Poliorcetes). The psephisma outlined the financing of the sacrifices and specified that the sacrifices to the Soteres and Agathe Tyche were to be repeated annually as a memorial during the month Elaphebolion, at a cost of 200 drachmas.76At the deme level, similar to the sacrifice voted for Demetrius by the polis in 304/3, the demesmen of Rhamnous in the middle of the third century voted to 72 SEG 21.469C.

Near the end of the fourth century the demesmen of Kollytos, for reasons now lost, voted to have πόπανα καὶ πελανό[ν] sacrificed to all the gods and heroes, and that the first sacrifices by the demesmen be to Agathe Tyche “for the safety of the Demos of Athenians.”78 The earliest rel-evant document for demes in these matters, of ca. 460, appears to be a decree of the demesmen of Skambonidai regulating a number of religious matters, including sacrifices, the distribution and dispensation of sacrificial meats, and perquisites of individual participants. In this it seems a cross between a decree and a sacred calendar.79 The demesmen of Piraeus in a psephisma of 300–250 voted to honor a benefactor, Callidamas of the deme Cholleidai, with, among other things, a portion of the sacrificial meat at their sacrifices and the right to feast with them in their sanctuaries, except where it is νόμιμον for only demes-men of Piraeus to enter.80 In I. Eleusis 85.19–20 of 332/1 we have a decree by the demesmen of Eleusis to buy and lease mines so that for their sacrifice to Heracles “in Acris” the revenue may be as much as possible and so that the sacrifice may be ὡς καλλίστη. So, as far as sacrifices are concerned, we have from polis and deme psephismata only two major interventions and a few new sacrifices introduced which include the prothymata for Asclepius in the mid-fourth century and the sacrifices for Athena Nike, Agathe Tyche, and Antigonus and Demetrius as a group in 304/3. And the Rhamnousians introduced a new sacrifice for Antigonus Gonatas in the middle of the third century. The scanty activity is noteworthy, as is the focus on financial and administrative matters.

Eleusis 250 of II/I BC records detailed instructions for, especially, the pompe from Athens to Eleusis and for the responsibilities of the officials involved. In IG II2 659 of 283/2 the polis orders [PS 24] the astynomoi to make various preparations for the pompe of Aphrodite Pandemos in Piraeus, including purifying the sanctu-ary, anointing the altars, and washing the statues. In a decree of 270/69 it is reported that the polis had voted by a psephisma [PS 25], probably in 283/2, to participate in the Ptolemaia in Egypt, chose Callias to be the archetheoros, and gave him 5000 drachmas (which he rejected) for his expenses.84 Similarly, in 250/49 the polis apparently decided by a psephisma [PS 26] to participate in the new Soteria at Delphi sponsored by the Aetolian League.85 We learn from three decrees [PS 27] honoring the agonothetai of the Theseia in mid- II BC that they had produced the sacrifices κατὰ τὰ πάτρια but had provided the prizes for the competitors κατὰ τὰ ψηφίσματα τῷ δήμῳ.86 Finally, SEG 32.218 reports a psephisma [PS 28] which outlined the financing for the Pythaïdes to Delphi, here apparently designating contributions by numerous governmen-tal, religious, and private individuals.87 About Sanctuaries, Dedications, and BuildingsIn 352/1 the polis by a psephisma [PS 29] created a commission to establish the boundaries of the Sacred Orgas and, in addition, created an elaborate divina-tory procedure to determine whether the Sacred Orgas should be rented out to be farmed or should be left fallow. Both of these were done regarding the Sacred Orgas [ὅπ]ω[ς] ἂ[ν] ὡς εὐσεβέστατα ἔχει τὰ πρὸς τὼ θεώ (IG II3 292.51–2).

This psephisma [PS 30], though, may refer to strictly legal procedures, not to religious matters.In 365/4 by a psephisma [PS 31] the Athenians addressed the responsibili-ties for and transfer of dedications on the Acropolis, including the statue of Athena, from one year’s set of tamiai to the next, and in so doing they referred to a previous psephisma [PS 32], no doubt on much the same subject, proposed by Androtion, probably about two or three years earlier.89We have only these polis psephismata indicating extensive polis involve-ment in the definition and management of sanctuaries, and it is noteworthy that they are all early, fifth and fourth century. We have seen that nomoi con-trolled some aspects of the use of their Thesmophorion for the demesmen of Piraeus, but by a psephisma they voted a legal punishment for those who vio-lated various limitations on access and activities within that sanctuary.90 Very much later, in 116/5, the residents of Salamis praised those who repaired and adorned some sanctuaries and an exedra, and these repairs had been ordered by a psephisma of the Salaminians.91The subject of the psephisma [PS 34] in IG II3 444 of 336–330 is the repair of the statue of Athena Nike that had been dedicated after a series of mili-tary victories in 426/5. Also ordered is the sacrifice by the priestess of Athena (Nike) of the ἀρεστήριον that often accompanied the repair or remodeling of dedications.92 These additions or improvements to sanctuaries also all date to the fifth and fourth centuries.The polis by psephismata also supervised the repair or remaking of dedi-cations in two healing sanctuaries, that of the Heros Iatros and the City Asclepieion. In 220/19 the Ekklesia voted [PS 35], upon recommendation of the priest of Heros Iatros, to establish a commission to remake a number of silver models of body parts and other dedications into one oinochoe, to be inscribed, “The Boule in the archonship of Thrasyphon from the dedications to Heros Iatros.” An ἀρεστήριον, at the cost of fifteen drachmas, is also to be 89 SEG 14.47.

About one hundred years later the priest of the same Heros Iatros secured the approval [PS 36] of the Boule for a com-mission to remake and repair a number of dedications in his sanctuary, includ-ing the oinochoe.93 The dedications in the City Asclepieion received similar attention, through psephismata of the polis [PS 37], in a series that runs from at least 274/3 to the late second century. Provisions are made for the inventory-ing, transferring to new priests, and the cleansing, remaking, and repair of the dedications.94 Similar is SEG 34.95 of 161/0 which orders by a psephisma [PS 38] the repair of dedications and then lists a long series of dedications and their donors. The identity of the deity is not certain but is probably Aphrodite (line 47). It may be just coincidence that most such records come from two healing sanctuaries, or it may reflect the current concern of the polis with “health,” but its concern for the City Asclepieion fits a pattern. About Priests and PriestessesThe activities of the priest of Asclepius, as it seems, were more controlled by nomoi and psephismata than any other. We have already examined IG II2 1163.8–13 with its nomoi and psephismata [PS 10] and IG II3 359.12–19 with its nomoi [N 23]. In SEG 18.22.10–12 of 165/4 the priest of Asclepius is praised for having supervised εὐκοσμία of the temple and for having sacrificed all the sacrifices κατὰ [τὰ] ψηφίσματα [PS 39]. Only this last text indisputably refers to religious (vs. secular) activities. Besides the priest of Asclepius, only the priestess of Athena Polias may have acted according to nomoi and psephismata [N 23a and PS 14a] and, as we have seen, these, too, may refer to secular duties.95 About Divine Honors to Living HumansWe have saved this category of psephismata until now because it will become all the more clear how uncharacteristic they are of the over 60 previous psephismata on religious matters. In 324 it became clear to Athenians that Alexander, now in Ecbatana, wanted “divine honors.” That year the Ekklesia debated Demades’ proposal to award such honors to Alexander, and after a contentious debate the proposal passed, as a psephisma [PS 40]. Soon after Alexander’s death in 323 Demades was prosecuted for making the proposal, presumably on a charge of “introducing new gods” or of introducing a proposal 93 IG II2 840. On these texts see Mikalson, 1998.185–6. Cf. IG II2 841 and 842.94 Aleshire, Inv. IV (274/3), V (244/3), VII (214/3), and IX (late II BC).95 IG II2 776.13–14, above. The highly restored SEG 25.140 of the first half of IV BC seemingly records a decree of the Erechtheis tribe which orders the priest to sacrifice to Poseidon and Erechtheus, specifies the victim, and provides for the financing."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" 141Nomoi and Psephismatathat was “contrary to the nomoi” (a γραφὴ παρανόμων). He was found guilty, and the psephisma was rescinded.96We have for the Athenians’ relationship with Demetrius Poliorcetes a number of psephismata, largely because for this there are some good, if not contemporary, literary sources, especially Plutarch’s Life of Demetrius. In 307/6 Demetrius was received as a liberator in Athens, and the Athenians awarded him a number of honors, some of a religious nature, enacted through a psephisma [PS 41] proposed by his Athenian supporter Stratocles and approved by the Ekklesia. These honors included statues of Demetrius and his father Antigonus Monophthalmus near those of the tyrannicides Harmodius and Aristogiton, an altar of Demetrius and Antigonus as the Soteres with a heorte, pompe, sacrifices, and agones, establishment of them as eponyms for two new tribes, Antigonis and Demetrias, and for their figures to be woven into the peplos of Athena Polias.97 In 304/3 Demetrius returned to Athens, again to lib-erate it, and received more honors from the Athenians. A sanctuary and altar of Demetrius Katabaites was established [PS 42] to mark the spot where he first descended from his chariot (Plut. Dem. 10.4 and Mor. 338a). Heroic honors including sanctuaries, altars, libations, and paeans were voted [PS 43] for three of his generals and agents, each of whom was not an Athenian himself but had prior dealings with Athens (Demochares, FGrHist 75 F 1). Stratocles also proposed [PS 44] that henceforth Athenian delegations to Demetrius should be termed theoroi, not ambassadors. That meant, as Plutarch interprets it, that they should be imagined as going to Delphi or Olympia for a heorte (Dem. 11.1 and Mor. 338a). That Demetrius was to be the oracular deity for Athens is clear from another psephisma [PS 45] proposed by Stratocles and passed after a dust-up with Demetrius, that “whatever King Demetrius ordered was ‘religiously correct’ regarding gods and just regarding men” (Dem. 24.4–5). During these years Demetrius wanted to be initiated into all three levels of the Eleusinian Mysteries and to do so on his schedule and not that of the Mysteries. To make this possible the Athenians voted [PS 46], on Stratocles’ motion, despite the opposition of the Eleusinian dadouchos, to rename and shuffle various months (Dem. 26.1–3). We have also for these years a psephisma [PS 19], previously described, to create sacrifices “on behalf of those who were campaigning” with Demetrius to Athena Nike, Agathe Tyche, and the Soteres, and specifying that the sacrifices to the Soteres and Agathe Tyche were to be 96 The major contemporary sources are Din. 1.94 and Hyp. 5. frag. 7 and 6.21–22.

The City Dionysia were renamed [PS 49] the Demetrieia (Dem. 12.2). Finally, when a question about restoring dedications at Delphi arose, in 292/1 Dromocleides proposed [PS 50] seek-ing an oracle from Demetrius, that the Athenians select an individual to go to the Soter (Demetrius) and ask how the Demos might settle the matter “with the most proper respect” (εὐσεβέστατα), “best,” and “as quickly as pos-sible” (Dem. 13.1–2).In 224/3 for his guarantees of their security the Athenians made, surely by a psephisma [PS 51], Ptolemy III Euergetes an eponymn for a new tribe, thereby creating the thirteenth tribe, Ptolemais. His wife Berenice was, in a new form of honor, made the eponym of a new deme.100In response to the aggressions of Philip V of Macedon, the Athenians, ca. 200, passed one or more psephismata [PS 52] which, among several other matters, rescinded the divine honors awarded to his ancestors. Livy (31.44) offers the best account of this:The orators immediately proposed a psephisma and the Demos approved it, to the effect that all statues and representations of Philip and their inscriptions, and likewise those of all his ancestors, male and female alike, should be removed and destroyed; that the religious heortai, sacri-fices, and priesthoods which had been introduced to honor him and his ancestors should be deconsecrated; that the places in which anything had been placed or inscribed in Philip’s honor should be put under a curse, and that nothing which by religious law must be placed or dedi-cated in a “pure” place be put or dedicated hereafter in these places; and that the state priests, everytime they prayed for the Athenian Demos and its allies, armies, and fleets, curse and execrate Philip, his children and kingdom, his land and sea forces, and the whole race and name of the Macedonians.98 Agora 16.114.

By this psephisma the two tribes Antigonis and Demetrias were elim-inated, as were their eponyms, but about this same time the Athenians voted [PS 53], amidst a splendid reception to Athens, that Attalus I of Pergamon, for his assistance against Philip, be made the eponym of a new tribe, Attalis.101 The resulting twelve tribe structure was to remain in place until the time of Hadrian.102 OtherIG II3 337 of 333/2 records both a (indecisive) probouleuma and a psephisma [PS 54], the latter proposed by Lycurgus and passed by the Ekklesia, to grant to Citian merchants the right to purchase property on which to found a sanctuary of Aphrodite, “just as also the Egypians have founded the sanctuary of Isis.” For a dedication probably from this cult (of Aphrodite Ourania), see IG II2 4636.103We have already surveyed the activities of the ephebes that were con-trolled by nomoi and psephismata (PS 2, 4, 5, and 6). Psephismata (PS 7) alone determined their dedication of a phiale to the Mother of the Gods, and later documents (PS 3) also attributed, probably wrongly, to psephismata alone the ephebes’ sacrifice of the εἰσιτητήρια. The ergastinai, a much later institution than the ephebes, apparently had their activities regulated only by psephis-mata [PS 55].104 IncertaIG II3 448 [I 1] and 449 [I 2] may both be either nomoi or psephismata.

Suggestions associating it with known or existing Athenian heortai include the Panathenaia, Eleusinia, and Amphiaraia. It may possibly be a new heorte for Eirene. It may even be in reference to an international festival instituted, not necessarily at Athens, 101 Polyb. 16.25.3–9 and Livy 31.14.11–15.7.

Scholars have proposed also the quadrennial Amphiaraia and the Bendideia.107 Whatever the heorte may have been, the role of Athenian officials clearly makes it Athenian.

They decree (ἐψηφίσθαι) that the demarch fine violators and take them to the dikasterion, “using the nomoi which are established about these things.” They also forbid the collection of wood in the sanctuary, and for violators “the old nomoi which are established about these things are to be authoritative.”109 Both may be either polis or deme nomoi, the first one determining perhaps only legal procedures, and it is noteworthy that both situations seemed con-trolled by multiple nomoi.110 It was also surely a nomos of the deme of Acharnai that ordered their tamias to make sacrifices to the gods and heroes, to super-vise the (local) Dionysia, and to have a silver phiale made. Nomoi also con-trolled the sacrifices, pompe, agones, and other elements of the same Dionysia by the tamias, demarch, and epimeletes of the heorte.111 It was by a psephisma (SEG 21.519 of mid-IV BC) that the demesmen of Acharnai decided on the finances to build, as ordered by an oracle, an altar or altars for Ares and Athena Areia “so that the things relating to the gods may be εὐσ[ε]βῶς for Acharnians and Athenians.” Nomoi and Psephismata of Private AssociationsPrivate associations also had their own nomoi, psephismata, and πάτρια.112 IG II2 1361 of after the middle of IV BC records a nomos of the citizen 109 IG II2 1177.13–21.110 Arnaoutoglou (2003. 51 n. 60) views these nomoi as deme ordinances. Others (see Arnaoutolgou, 50–51) think some Solonian.111 SEG 43.26A.1–8, B1–7 of 315/4.112 On nomoi and psephismata of such associations, see Arnaoutoglou, 2003, esp. 125–9."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"152CHAPTER 7devotees of Bendis in Piraeus.113 The cult preexisted this nomos, but the nomos lays out prescriptions for a whole range of cult matters: sacrifices by mem-bers and non-members, perquisites for the priest and priestess, financial arrangements for the repair of the sanctuary and its oikia, the scheduling of monthly meetings, money for sacrifices, and other such matters. This nomos is intended to be a long-term ordering or reordering of fundamental cult struc-tures, and it is foreseen that someone in the future may attempt to alter some of these arrangements by a psephisma. IG II2 1283 of the Thracian devotees of Bendis in Piraeus reveals nicely the interplay of cult τὰ πάτρια, psephismata, and of polis nomoi. They had their own nomoi,114 but a nomos of the city bid them to hold a pompe from the Prytaneion to Piraeus (9–11), perhaps part of a nomos that granted the devotees ἔγκτησις and ἵδρυσις of their sanctuary (4–7).115 By IG II2 1283 (δεδόχθαι, 13) of 261/0 the devotees make arrangements for elements of this pompe between members in the city cult and those in Piraeus. All of this is done “so that the sacrifices to the gods and all the other things which are appropriate may occur κατά τε τὰ πάτρια τῶν Θραικῶν καὶ τοὺς τῆς πόλ[εως νόμου]ς” (23–6). They need to respect not only their native πάτρια but also the nomoi of the city.The Dionysiastae of Piraeus had three nomoi, or one nomos encompassing a variety of areas. A nomos determined how to honor members, much like the polis nomos that did the same. Another determined the succession of priests. A third controlled membership. Their sacrifices were, however, κατὰ τὰ πάτρια.116 A nomos also controlled the manner of honoring members for the thiasotai of the Carian Zeus Labraundos. For thiasotai of Artemis a nomos determined financial contributions of members. Some officials of a thiasos were honored for, among other things, having given “burial money” for deceased individuals, κατ[ὰ τὸν νόμον].117 The cult of the Megaloi Theoi had a nomophylax. Epimeletai of a Bendis cult on Salamis were honored because they supervised the sacri-fices, ὡς αὐτοῖς πάτριόν ἐστι and supervised the “other things” which αὐτοῖς ὁ 113 On this text see Mikalson, 1998.142 and Arnaoutoglou, 2003.97–8 and 103.

For our purposes more impor-tant are those psephismata controlling cult activities. The private cult of the Mother of the Gods was one of the longest lasting such associations in Athens.120 IG II2 1328 of 183/2, in response to a complaint by the priestesses of expenses they faced, describes for them some duties such as spreading two couches and providing jewelry for the phialophoroi and other women and also makes an extraordinary appointment of a zakoros. And, finally, in the early third century a koinon worshipping both Heroines and Echelos had their ἀρχαῖα ψη[φίσματα] which laid out orders for sacrifices to these deities, the victims, the costs, and the distribution of the portions.121Nomoi and psephismata of private koina seem differentiated like those of the polis, with nomoi establishing the basic principles—almost like a charter—for the cult but with psephismata used for more ephemeral matters and for honoring members of the koinon.122 And koina, unlike the polis, were more regularly remodeling their cults by legislation throughout our period.118 Zeus Labraundos, IG II2 1271.16–18 of 299/8; Artemis, IG II2 1298.16–20 of 248/7; Megaloi Theoi, Agora 16.324.6 of 112/1; cult of Bendis, SEG 59.155.3–5 of 243/2 and 44.60.3–5 of 244/3.

Bowden (2005.168–9) offers a most convenient “Concordance of Athenian consultations of Delphi,” in which he lists 28 occurrences with the appropriate references. Bowden treats only classical Athens and only Delphi, and his latest oracle is from 330 BC. From these we select, for our purposes, those concerning religious matters, and we add examples from other oracles and from other forms of divination to the end of the Hellenistic period.1 New and Renewed Cults and Religious EventsThe Ath. Pol. (21.6) records that for Cleisthenes the Delphic Oracle selected the ten new eponymous heroes of the new ten tribes from one hundred preselected “founding heroes” (ἀρχηγετῶν), presumably in 508/7. This transformation of the cult of ten heroes into eponymous heroes was not exactly the introduction of new cults, but it was a major innovation, in that each selected hero would now be worshipped by a different group for different purposes, even though the cult site and presumably the family of the priest would remain the same.In the years just before the Persian Wars, as the Athenians planned to attack Aegina, they received an oracle from Delphi bidding them to wait thirty years, then in the thirty-first year to build a sanctuary for the Aeginetan hero Aeacus and begin the war against the Aeginetans. If they did this,what they wished would come to them. But if they campaigned immedi-ately, they would suffer much in the interval and would also accomplish much, and in the end would overthrow the Aeginetans. When the Athenians heard this report, they built a sanctuary for Aeacus, the sanc-tuary that still stands in the Agora, but they did not put up with hearing that they had to wait thirty years after they had suffered wrongs from the Aeginetans.

But the evidence clearly indicates that these events occurred in the period between 507 and 499, and so the oracle is correct in the outcome but not in the timing of the end of the Athenian-Aeginetan hostilities.2 For our purposes the salient point is that the cult of Aeacus in Athens was established just before the Persian Wars as a result of the Delphic Oracle.According to the emperor Julian (5.159b), the Athenians were ordered by the Pythia to appease the wrath of the Mother of the Gods over her priest who had been expelled or murdered by some Athenians. To do this the Athenians erected in the Agora the Metroön, the building or, perhaps better, the sanctu-ary of the Mother of the Gods where the Athenian archives were kept. The oracle, if genuine, would be establishing in central Athens a new cult of the Mother of the Gods, perhaps about 500 BC.3Pausanias (1.32.5) tells the story of the founding of the hero cult of Echetlaios after the battle of Marathon:The Marathonians say there was a man in the battle who was rustic in his appearance and gear. He killed many of the barbarians with a plow, and then disappeared. When the Athenians questioned Delphi, the god responded nothing else to them but bid them to honor Echetlaios as a hero.In the psephisma of IG I3 7 of ca. 460–450 the polis is granting the request of the Praxiergidae for a public record of τὰ πάτρια of their genos concerning, apparently, the Plynteria and Kallynteria. The stele records two things: the ora-cle of the god, no doubt Apollo, and the previous psephismata on the subject. We have both an oracle, certainly prior and perhaps going back to early days of the Praxiergidae’s activities, and psephismata establishing for the family its πάτρια, its now ancestral responsibilities for this ritual.42 Mikalson, 2003.23. On the cult of Aeacus on Aegina and in Athens and on the Anakeion in Athens, see Stroud, 1998, esp. 85–104.3 On this oracle, the other sources for the event, and the date, see Parker, 1996.188–91 and Fontenrose, 1978.312–13.4 On the Praxiergidae, the Plynteria and Kallynteria, and this text, and for a different interpre-tation of the relationship of the oracle and τὰ πάτρια, see Parker, 1996.307–8 and 2005.474–5 and 478–9."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"156CHAPTER 8IG I3 40.64–9 of 446/5 records sacrifices “from the oracles concerning Euboea,” to be performed by three bouleutai with the chresmologue Hierocles and to be supervised by the strategoi. These sacrifices were probably made on Euboea and were a one-time event. Hierocles, given his profession, may have interpreted old oracles.5IG I3 256 of ca. 440–430 records fees and fines for use or misuse of the rural spring of Alochos, obviously in a sanctuary of the Nymphs. It begins, however, with a command “to sacrifice to the Nymphs according to the oracle from Pytho” (2–4). Here it is likely that the oracle went back to the founding of the sanctuary.6Several, perhaps all, of the prescriptions for the cult of Bendis in a pse-phisma of 413/2 (?) were based on an oracle. Another oracle, from Dodona and no doubt earlier than that of IG I3 136, had probably approved granting the cult ἔγκτησις and ἵδρυσις, that is, the founding of the cult for Thacians resident in Athens.7According to the scholiast on the passage, the cult of Hermes Hegemonios first mentioned in Aristophanes, Ploutos 1159, was founded because of an oracle.8In his speech against Meidias of 347/6 Demosthenes, in the context of the City Dionysia, says that the Athenians make all their choruses and hymns for the god “not only according to the nomoi but also according to the oracles (κατὰ τὰς μαντείας).” In these oracles, he continues, the city was bid by both Delphi and Dodona to establish choruses κατὰ τὰ πάτρια and to fill the streets with the savor of sacrifices and to wear crowns (21.51). He then had some ora-cles read (52–53), oracles which are not all genuine in the text as we have it.9 In summarizing the oracles (54–5), which no doubt long predated the speech, Demosthenes claims that there are these and many other oracles for the city, and that they order the Athenians to sacrifice the other sacrifices to the gods appearing in each oracle and to establish choruses and to wear crowns κατὰ τὰ πάτρια. He adds, apparently, that these oracles are in addition to all the others that come to the city.10 The oracles, if Demosthenes is exact in his wording 5 On Hierocles and this text, see Parker, 2005.112–13 and M&L #52.6 This text should be added to the “historical” oracles of Fontenrose, 1978.7 IG I3 136.7 and 31 and IG II2 1283.4–6.

If we parse Demosthenes’ text a little less closely, he may just be empha-sizing that the choruses and such things both are ordered by oracles and are τὰ πάτρια as they are also κατὰ τοὺς νόμους.11We must now leap over more than 200 years to when, from the Delphians’ point of view, the Athenian Demos voted in a psephisma (in 138) to send a Pythaïs to Delphi, “following the oracles and the ‘historical inquiries’ (ἱστορίαις).”12 This was a restoration of the theoria last held in 326/5.13 For the Pythaïs of 98/7 the authorities include the oracle of the god and the psephisma, but to them are added τὰ [πάτρια].14 It is likely that the oracle of Apollo goes back to the establishment of the original Pythaïdes in the fifth century,15 and that the psephismata deal with the current celebrations. Again, the ultimate authority behind this religious event would be the oracle.1611 SEG 25.140.7 of the first half of IV BC has been restored to make the sacrifices to Poseidon and Erechtheus κα[τὰ τὴν μαντείαν] as well as [κατὰ τὰ] πάτρια.12 FD 3.2.27.4–7. Cf. 3.2.48.7–8 of 98/7 and 2.50.3–4 of 106 or 97 BC ἱστορίαις, to judge from the parallel in Perrin-Saminadayar, 2007.206–12, T26.70, suggests that the restoration of the Pythaïs after nearly 200 years required some historical study, perhaps of the works of the Atthidographers. It may well have been, in our terms, a search of τὰ πάτρια. It is unparalleled in a similar context in Athenian inscriptions. For the Athenian contribu-tors to the Pythaïdes, see SEG 32.218.13 On the Pythaïdes and their restoration at this time, see Jim, 2014.240–3, Rutherford, 2013, esp. 176–7, 183–5, 222–30, 306–7, and 310–13, Deshours, 2011.97–104, Parker, 2005.82–7, Mikalson, 1998.34 and 268–72, and Tracy, 1982. The purpose of them was “to offer homage to Apollo with sacrifices and games, to present the traditional ‘first fruits,’ and to bring the symbolic sacred fire from Delphi to Athens” (Tracy, 152). The purpose expressed in FD 3.2.48.9 (as stated by the Delphians concerning the Athenians) is “for the health and safety of all the citizens, their children and wives, friends and allies.” Once reestablished in 138/7 they were held again in 128/7, 106/5, 103/2, 102/1, 101/0, 100/99, 99/8, and 98/7 (Deshours, 2011.97).14 FD 3.2.48.7–8.15 For which see Strabo, 9.2.11 and Parker, 2005.85.16 Most would include the Telemachus monument (SEG 47.232) among oracular estab-lishments of new cults. There is, however, much troubling about the critical lines 11–16 which are taken to indicate oracular approval for the introduction of the Asclepius cult to Athens in 420/19. The “oracles” themselves are almost completely restored (κα[τὰ χρησμ]ός), and to what they refer, if there, is also difficult. It is hard to imagine that the god’s name (Asclepius) was omitted in line 13 by accident, as most assume. If not, the presumed oracles would concern bringing the “servants,” if, again, this is the correct restoration, on a chariot, again a restoration. Despite the widely held assumptions about the restora-tions and meanings of these lines, we need, I think, to be more wary of this text. The very"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"158CHAPTER 8In SEG 21.469C of 129/8 a number of cults of Apollo are refurbished and expanded. In the section on Apollo Patroös it is claimed that Apollo through oracles ordered the Athenians to “entreat” (λ[ι]ταν[εῦσ]α[ι]) the god called Patroös and to make the [πατρί]ου[ς θυσί]ας at the appropriate times of the year to Apollo (11–14). Timarchos of Sphettos, tamias of the Boule, “renewed” or “revived” (ἀνενώσατο) the oracles and the existing honors for the god. The Boule and Ekklesia then plan not only to preserve τὰ πάτρια but also to increase the sacrifices and honors καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς. They will do the other things for Apollo according to the oracles, and various officials will make sac-rifices in addition to “the things voted by psephismata before” (15–26). Here it looks as though Delphi is reacting to Athens’ neglect of Apollo Patroös (hence λιτανεῦσαι) and had repeatedly ordered the renewal of the ancestral sacrifices to him.17 This neglect must have been well before 129/8 because Timarchos had to “revive” these oracles. Now the polis is responding not only by restoring the traditional τίμια of the god, presumably established by psephismata, but also, by this psephisma, is increasing the τίμια. Elements Added to Existing CultsDiogenes Laertius (1.110) in his life of Epimenides tells the following story:When the Athenians were beset by a plague, the Pythia gave them an oracle to purify the city. They sent a ship and Nicias, the son of Niceratus, to Crete, summoning Epimenides. He came in the 46th Olympiad (595–592) and purified their city and stopped the plague in the following way. He took black and white sheep and led them to the Areopagus. From there he let them go wherever they wished, and ordered those who fol-lowed them to sacrifice each one, where it lay down, to the appropriate god. As a result it is possible even now to find throughout the demes of the Athenians altars with no names on them, a memorial of the propitia-tion (of the gods) that took place then.If we wish to understand Epimenides’ procedure, we may imagine that he wished to appease only the specific gods that were responsible for the plague, fragmentary IG I3 137 of ca. 420 appears to be establishing or enhancing a cult of Apollo, perhaps as the ancestral exegetes, on the basis of Apollo’s own oracle.17 This is the only example of λιτάνω on Attic inscriptions, and it is very rare on those from other places."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":" 159Oracles And Divinationand that the victims themselves were to indicate the appropriate gods by lying down in their sanctuaries. Their sacrifice was then the propitiation of these gods. Our interest is not the ending of the plague,18 but, as before, in new cults or additions or changes to them from oracles. Here it looks as though a series of altars, unusually with no gods’ names on them, were constructed in existing sanctuaries of various gods to mark their role in the stopping of the plague. Apollo’s role here is, as it were, secondary. He motivated the Athenians to make a purification and perhaps specified Epimenides—although this is not attested—, and Epimenides dictated the procedures. From Plutarch (Solon 12.5) it would appear the pollution was associated with the killing of the Cylonian conspirators, and that the altars were constructed at Epimenides’ direction.19 In Diogenes’ view the new altars, as so many innovations in cult, were a ὑπόμνημα of an important event.Plutarch twice (Theseus 36.1–3 and Cimon 8.6) describes how, in 476/5, the Pythia gave an oracle to the Athenians to recover the bones of Theseus, to bury them with honor and guard them in their own land, and to honor him as a hero.20 Theseus had been murdered on the island of Scyros about 400 years before, and Cimon, the son of Miltiades, led the successful expedition to recover the bones. When the bones were returned to Athens, “The Athenians, delighted, received them with brilliant pompai and with sacrifices as if the hero himself were returning to the city. . . . And they make to him the greatest sacrifice on Pyanopsion 8 . . ., and they honor him also on the eighth day of each month” (Theseus 36.2–3). It is almost inconceivable that the Athenians had not had a sanctuary and cult of Theseus before 476/5,21 and so we may view this as a major enhancement to his cult, an enhancement reflected in his burgeoning popularity in this period.I. Eleusis 28a, the famous First Fruits Decree of ca. 440–435, orders that the Athenians make an aparche of their harvest of wheat and barley to the god-desses κατὰ τὰ πάτρια καὶ τὲν μαντείαν τὲν ἐγ Δελφῶν (4–5). It is unlikely that 18 For this type of purification being required for the pollution and plague resulting from the Cylonian affair, see the sources, often contradictory, collected in Sandys, 1912.1–3. Given the circumstances of the case, it was appropriate that the victims were released at the Areopagus.19 ἱλασμοῖς τισι καὶ καθαρμοῖς καὶ ἱδρύσεσι κατοργιάσας καὶ καθοφιώσας τὴν πόλιν. On Epimenides see Parker, 1983.211 n. 23 and Jacoby on FGrHist 457.20 Pausanias (3.3.7) has the Delphic Oracle make the recovery of the bones of Theseus a precondition to the capture of Scyrus.21 On this event and the earlier and later cult of Theseus in Athens, see Parker, 1996.168–70 and Shapiro, 1996.

The same oracle, per-haps simply “to make an aparche of the harvest to the two goddesses,” was then twice more referred to, by the hierophant and the dadouchos when they are to urge that all Greeks do the same (24–6) and when the Boule was to request this of the cities (33–4). Isocrates in his Panegyricus of 380 describes this same aparche, but gives a different account of the oracle (4.31):Most cities as a remembrance of our good service long ago send aparchai of grain to us each year, and the Pythia ordered those failing in this to send parts of their crops and to do τὰ πάτρια regarding our city. Yet, about what ought one more to believe than those things about which the god gives a reply and which seem right to many of the Greeks?If we combine I. Eleusis 28a and Isocrates 4.31, we have two oracles from Delphi. The first orders the aparche to Demeter and Kore, probably just for the Athenians. In I. Eleusis 28a the Athenians attempt to extend this mandate to allied and other Greek cities, implying but not expressly stating a Delphic ora-cle to this effect. Isocrates indicates a second, later oracle spurring on the lag-gard cities. Given the nature of the two sources, it seems likely that Isocrates, in promoting and defending Athens about 60 years later, misremembers or mis-represents the situation for an international audience and has made the oracle of I. Eleusis 28a refer to laggard cities and thereby support Athenian expansion of the original Delphic mandate to all Greek cities.22Pausanias (1.3.4) describes a statue of Apollo Alexikakos by Calamis, erected in front of the temple of Apollo Patroös in the Agora. The god received this epithet because, by an oracle from Delphi, he stopped the plague afflicting 22 Clinton (1974.15 n. 26) thinks Delphi bid all Greek cities to make the aparche to Eleusis: “Delphi was probably consulted on this occasion of the extension [of the aparche to allied and other cities], or at the time it was first extended if this is not the first time. . . .” That Delphi would order such a thing seems unlikely, as well that it would order other Greeks to act κατὰ τὰ πάτρια of the Athenians. On the results of this decree in terms of contribu-tions by Athenians and other cities, and that Isocrates’ statement that “most cities . . . send aparchai of grain to us each year” is “probably not a falsehood, but just an exaggeration,” see Clinton, 2010. On the aparche to Eleusis in general, see also Jim, 2014.207–19. From the very fragmentary I. Eleusis 138 of mid-IV BC it would appear (A10) that an oracle (κατὰ τὴν μαντείαν) had something to do with the declaration of the sacred truce for the Eleusinian Mysteries. On this see Clinton, 2005–2008.II.119: “Reference to the Delphic Oracle probably indicates an innovation, sanctioned by Apollo either at this time or earlier.”"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" 161Oracles And DivinationAthens at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War. This looks not to be a new cult but simply a dedication given to the existing cult of Apollo Patroös. It was probably for this cult that Neoptolemus was honored, in a psephisma proposed by Lycurgus, for having promised to gild the new altar of Apollo “in accor-dance with the prophecy of the god,” surely Apollo of Delphi ([Plut.] X Orat. 843F–844A).23In the mid-fourth century the Acharnians decided to build an altar (2–3) or, more likely, altars (7, 14–15) for Ares and Athena Areia, “since the god responded that it was λῶιον καὶ ἄμεινον (“better”) for the Demos of Acharnians and the Demos of Athenians having built the altars of Ares and Athena Areia “so that the things relating to the gods may be εὐσ[ε]βῶς for Acharnians and Athenians” (SEG 21.519. 4–10). The purpose given is the clearest statement we have of why one would consult an oracle on such a matter—to establish that the proposed action was εὐσεβές.IG II3 445 of ca. 335 contains provisions for the cult equipment (κόσμος) of numerous deities, and lines 43–50 treat especially that of Artemis Brauronia and of Demeter and Kore. Here the god is to be asked if it is λῶον καὶ ἄμεινον for the Demos of Athenians having made the equipment sacred to these deities and others larger and more beautiful (μείζους καὶ καλλίους) or leaving it as it is. The god, no doubt Apollo, must approve this rather large scale remaking of the dedications to these deities.Three texts, ranging from ca. 330–320 to mid-I BC describe the spreading of a couch and the adornment of a table for Plouton as being “according to the oracle of the god.” This certainly refers to an addition to the cult at Eleusis, not its foundation.24 Management of Sanctuaries and DedicationsDuring his reign, after 546, Pisistratus in response to oracle(s) undertook the purification of a part of Delos, all that area of the island that could be viewed from the sanctuary.

The purpose of the inquiry is “so that τὰ πρὸς τὼ θεω may be as εὐσεβῆ as possible and so that for the future nothing ἀσεβές may happen concerning the hiera orgas and con-cerning the other sanctuaries at Athens” (51–4).26In the mid-fourth century “the god,” surely Apollo, responded to the Demos of Athenians to dedicate the house and garden of Demon, son of Demomeles, of the deme Paiania to Asclepius and to make him priest of the cult. And so it was done, κατὰ τὴν μαν[τείαν], and, apparently, was a break from the usual system of appointing the priest of this cult.27In 330–324 Hyperides (4.24–6) reports an oracle from Zeus of Dodona to the Athenians. Zeus “ordered” (προσέταξεν) the Athenians to “adorn” the statue of Dione at Dodona. The Athenians sent a religious embassy to Dodona, per-formed an expensive sacrifice, and, as ordered, “adorned” the statue of Dione. They made her face “as beautiful as possible,” and they prepared much expen-sive “ornament” (κόσμον) for the goddess. That is, probably, they provided jew-elry for the goddess’ head.28When Philip II restored Oropus to Athens in 335, the Athenians decided to divide the acquired public lands among the ten tribes, with pairs of tribes receiving allotments.29 After the division had been made and some incomes received, the concern arose whether one of the parcels was in fact sacred 25 Hdt. 1.64.2, Thuc. 3.104.1–2 and 5.1.1 and 32.1, and Diod.

In general outline, τὰ πάτρια “made up the cen-tral core of ritual practices; τὰ πάτρια did not have recognisable authors; their mortal agent was an abstract collective: the ancestors.” The nomos “contained specific instructions concerning the application of τὰ πάτρια and the penalties for those who violated them.” The nomos “existed in writing and was the result of recognisable human agents.” And the psephisma, “the decree of the Ekklesia which simply took measures for the enforcement of τὰ πάτρια; the decree had an author . . .; it was subject to discussion in the Boule . . . and in the Ekklesia; and in theory it was subject to negotiation and modification.”1 Chaniotis only briefly treats oracles which I mark out as a separate authority, but his general outline offers an excellent introduction as we look to the Athenian texts.In Chapters 6–8 we surveyed the roles of τὰ πάτρια, nomoi, psephismata, and oracles in determining specific matters in a number of religious areas, includ-ing sacrifices, heortai, sanctuaries, etc. as they appear in both literary and epi-graphical texts. We now offer discussions of each and, using specific examples, attempt to describe the interplay of these four types of authority in Athenian cultic activity, both public and private. τὰ πάτρια2IG II2 1496 of 334/3–331/0 records the revenues the polis received during the period from the sale of skins of victims at polis-supported heortai and 1 P. 98. In these quotations I have modified certain terms to match my terminology: e.g., τὰ πάτρια for “the patria,” “Ekklesia” for “assembly” and “Boule” for “council.” Chaniotis offers a fuller description of these elements on pp. 102–3.2 Deshours (304–7) has a good discussion of τὰ πάτρια in the context of the late Hellenistic period and of the revival of so many traditional religious cults and heortai in that time.

It may be that this inscription records all the polis-supported sacrifices and heortai of the time that required a substantial number of victims. The sacrifices, as distinct from the heortai, are to deities whose cults were all seemingly established in the fourth century or the very end of the fifth: Agathe Tyche (by 335/4), Ammon (by 340–330),3 Demokratia (perhaps 403), Eirene (in 375/4), Hermes Hegemonios (by 388/7), and Zeus Soter of Piraeus (by 388). None of these, interestingly, occurs in our lists of τὰ πάτρια. The heortai, all older, are the Asclepieia (420/19), Bendideia (late V BC), City Dionysia, Dionysia in Piraeus, Eleusinia, Lenaia, Olympieia, Panathenaia, and Theseia (by 476/5). Of these major heortai the City Dionysia, Panathenaia, and Theseia are among τὰ πάτρια, and it may be chance that some of the others do not turn up as such in our texts. Also, most sacrifices and heortai associated with τὰ πάτρια did not require large numbers of victims and hence were not recorded in IG II2 1496. But the distribution of entries supports the distinction I offered some years ago (1998.36), that the heortai are all of long standing while most if not all of the sacrifices seem inno-vations of the fourth century. Therefore only the relatively old heortai are con-trolled by τὰ πάτρια.4The sacrifices, as distinct from the heortai, listed in IG II2 1496 can, per-haps, be classed as ἐπίθετα, “things added on.” The purpose of the psephisma of SEG 21.469C.17–20 of 129/8 is “that the boule and Demos may appear not only observing τὰ πάτρια but also increasing the sacrifices and the honors καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς. . . .” It distinguishes between “observing” (διοτηροῦντες) τὰ πάτρια and “increasing” the sacrifices and honors for Apollo.5 In other parlance, the increased sacrifices and honors would be called, in distinction from τὰ πάτρια, 3 If SEG 46.122 of 363/2 is, as it now seems to be, an inventory of gifts sent by Athens on a theoria to Siwa, not an inventory of a local cult.4 Rosivach, 1994.48–67 offers much of value on these questions, but here and in what follows I disagree with his distinction between events that are πάτρια and ἐπίθετα. He sees the funda-mental difference in funding, with τὰ ἐπίθετα receiving polis general funds and with τὰ πάτρια receiving funding from the mysterious μισθώματα of Isoc. 7.29. The import of Isoc. 7.29 is not this, however. Whether μισθώματα are “contracts” or “rents” does not much matter. Rather it should be seen as sarcastic and derogatory, with Isocrates complaining that τὰ ἐπίθετα with their banquets receive lots of state funds but τὰ πάτρια get only miniscule funds. Similarly some Americans have suggested that the school budgets should get full state funding and shortfalls in the military budget should be covered by bake sales. The source of funding is not the fundamental difference between τὰ πάτρια and τὰ ἐπιθέτα.5 By “honors” here is probably meant hymns, pompai, agones, and such things. See Mikalson, 2010.160. Cf.

Pol. 3.3 it is reported, as we have seen, that the basileus and polemarch “administer” τὰ πάτρια, the archon τὰ ἐπίθετα. In the Areopagiticus Isocrates praises Athenians of olden days who would do away with no one of τὰ πάτρια and would add nothing outside τὰ νομιζόμενα. They would not, “whenever it seemed right to them, send in pompe 300 cows nor would they, whenever they just happened to, abandon the πάτριοι θυσίαι” (7.29–30). Things outside τὰ νομιζόμενα would be τὰ ἐπίθετα. So Isocrates can distinguish between the πάτριοι θυσίαι and the ἐπίθετοι ἑορταί (7.29).6 And the phrase ὁπότε . . . δόξειεν αὐτοῖς (“whenever it seemed right to them”) suggests that the procedures for creating τὰ ἐπίθετα were nomoi and psephismata.The distinction between τὰ πάτρια and τὰ ἐπίθετα arises in the charges brought, about 399 BC, against Nicomachus who with others had been com-missioned, among other things, to “write up” (ἀναγράφειν) the pre-existing laws and the polis sacrificial calendar (Lysias 30).7 The purpose of the latter was to ensure that the city performed “the sacrifices from the kyrbeis” and those from the stelai (30.17). The kyrbeis were the inscriptions recording the sacrifi-cial calendar ascribed to Solon, and the stelai were presumably the inscriptions recording sacrifices established since then by nomoi and psephismata.8 We can be quite confident that the sacrifices from the kyrbeis were always considered πάτρια, but were the later sacrifices and heortai, those established by nomoi and psephismata, thought πάτρια or ἐπίθετα? Some people, the prosecutor claims, used to sacrifice only τὰ ἐκ τῶν κύρβεων (30.17). He himself says “it is necessary to sacrifice first the sacrifices κατὰ τὰ πάτρια, the sacrifices “which 6 On this passage and this distinction, see Garland, 1992.23–5.7 On Solon’s calendar and Nicomachus’ “writing up” of it (SEG 52.48), see Canevaro and Harris, 2012.111–16; Stavrianopoulou, 2011.86–92, Shear, 2011.74–5, 78–96, 232, and 238–45; Carawan, 2010; Pébarthe, 2006.129–42; Lambert, 2002; Parker, 1996.43–55 and 218–20; Todd, 1996; Rhodes, 1991; Robertson, 1990; and Clinton, 1982.

I follow here the common reading and interpreta-tion of the text (e.g., Rhodes, 1991), but note Nelson’s (2006) conjecture of οὐ πλείω for the commonly accepted conjecture τῶν στηλῶν which would change significantly many con-clusions drawn from the passage. For these changes and the common opinion, see Nelson, 2006.310–11. With Nelson’s conjecture the link of τὰ πάτρια and ἐκ τῶν κύρβεων would remain, however, and would be even more exclusive."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"168CHAPTER 9more are beneficial to the polis,”9 then the sacrifices “which the Demos voted” (19).” Here the two groups are, apparently: 1) the sacrifices “from the kyrbeis” which are sacrificed κατὰ τὰ πάτρια; and 2) sacrifices resulting from psephis-mata of the Demos. The phrase “which more are beneficial to the polis” reflects the importance of the first group vis-à-vis the second, an importance suggested elsewhere by the speaker. Of particular importance to us is that the speaker links the sacrifices “from the kyrbeis” to τὰ πάτρια.10 So far it seems possible that only the sacrifices “from the kyrbeis” were thought πάτρια, but we leave the question open as we next look at which sacrifices and heortai are termed πάτρια in our epigraphical texts and elsewhere. τὰ πάτρια Likely from the Solonian CalendarVery closely linked to τὰ πάτρια at Athens is the basileus.11 We have seen that Philippides in 293/2, as basileus, sacrificed the sacrifices that fell to him εὐσ[ε]βῶς καὶ κα[τ]ὰ τὰ π[ά]τρια. The Ath. Pol. (57.1) reports that the basileus admin-istered, so to speak, “all the πάτριοι θυσίαι.”12 According to the stranger in Plato’s Politicus (290e6–8), to the basileus have been given “the most revered and especially πάτρια of the old sacrifices.”13 It was his wife who, according to [Demosthenes] (59.73 and 75) “did on behalf of the city τὰ πάτρια τὰ πρὸς τοὺς θεούς.” It was also by his nomos that at least some of the activities of the 9 ἃ μᾶλλον συμφέρει τῇ πόλει. I accept Bergk’s deletion of ἔπειτα in this passage. The dele-tion creates two balanced groups instead of three unbalanced ones. The problems with keeping the ἔπειτα are apparent in Todd’s (2000.303) translation of the passage: “our sac-rifices should be, first, in the manner of our ancestors; secondly, in the best interests of the city; and thirdly, the ones that the democracy has decreed.” What can the second group, “which are in the best interests of the city,” be? Rosivach’s suggestions (1994.55 n. 114) raise the problem more than offer a solution: “The middle term may refer to special ad hoc sacrifices, or it may refer to nothing in particular and was simply added to make the epithetoi heortai, which follow, appear superfluous and wasteful.” The “middle group” creates a problem also for Stravrianopoulou’s argument (2011.88 and 91). For a discussion, see Rauchenstein, 1872, ad loc.10 In 30.20 αἱ πάτριοι θύσιαι also have an implied connection with τῶν ἐν ταῖς κύρβ́εσι γεγραμμένων. Given the context, τὰ πάτρια of 30.29 need not refer only to sacrifices but to everying, including the nomoi, that Nicomachus was charged with “writing up.”11 On the following religious activities of the basileus, see Carlier, 1984.329–37.12 Cf.

Pol. 57.1), he was especially concerned with the Eleusinian Mysteries, and [Lysias] 6.4, in its attack on Andocides, offers a valuable link between the basileus and τὰ πάτρια there: “If (Andocides) comes to be allotted as one of the nine archons and if he obtains the role of basi-leus, will he sacrifice on your behalf and pray κατὰ τὰ πάτρια,15 those in the Eleusinion and those in the sanctuary at Eleusis, and will he supervise the heorte at the Mysteries, so that no one commits an injustice or shows lack of respect concerning the sacred things?”The cult most controlled by τὰ πάτρια, to judge by our surviving evidence, was that of Demeter and Kore at Eleusis.16 The Kerykes and Eumolpidae super-vised the sanctuary there, and they with the epimeletai supervised also the Mysteries themselves, both κατὰ τὰ πάτρια.17 There were sacrifices to Demeter and Kore and the other gods οἷς πάτριον ἦν.18 In [Dem.] 59.116 the hierophant Archias is charged with asebeia because he sacrificed παρὰ τὰ πάτρια (contrary to τὰ πάτρια). The pompe to Eleusis, the pompe of Iakchos, was to be held “as much as possible following τὰ πάτρια.”19 τὰ πάτρια governed the disposition of the garments of the initiates,20 and, finally, the aparchai to Eleusis were to be made κατὰ τὰ πάτρια.21Theseus’ bones were brought to Athens in 476/5 and a tomb, sacrifices, and a heorte were established (Plutarch, Th. 36.1–3 and Cim. 8.6). His cult in Athens almost certainly predated this event and dated back to Solonian times, and hence τὰ πάτρια associated with sacrifices in his cult may well refer to the sixth century BC.22Various aspects of cults of other deities central to polis cult, and in all prob-ability Solonian, were also controlled by τὰ πάτρια: Athena Polias, Erechtheus, 14 Philoch., FGrHist 328 F 73.

The Ath. Pol. (43.6) claims that, in two ekklesiai each month, the order of business was 1) “three of sacred things,” 2) “three for the heralds and embassies,” and 3) “three of secular matters.”26 Aeschines (1.23) refers to the first group as περὶ ἱερῶν τῶν πατρίων (“about sacred matters that were πάτρια”), and the lawgiver to whom Aeschines rightly or wrongly assigns the laws that control this and other matters in this speech is Solon (1.6).27 We might also include in the agenda of the Ekklesia the opening prayers by the herald, prayers which were πάτριοι according to Aeschines (1.23) and were required by the nomothetes Solon.28 And, finally, in its description of Cleisthenes’ reforms, the Ath. Pol. (21.6) makes this claim: “He allowed them to have their gene, phratries, and priesthoods κατὰ τὰ πάτρια.29 Priesthoods predating Cleisthenes (Solonian?) we could, therefore, designate πάτριοι ἱερωσύναι.3023 Athena Polias, IG I3 7, II2 776; Erechtheus, Dem. 60.27; Aglauros, SEG 33.115.14; Apollo Pythios, Dem.19.128; Apollo Patroös, SEG 21.469C; Dionysus, IG II3 1284.10–11 and 35–6; and Semnai, IG II3 1176.10.24 Choes, Ar.

By the fourth century at least the ephebes swore in their oath, τιμήσω ἱερὰ τὰ πάτρια (Lycurgus, Leoc. 77 and R&O #88.16), and the ἱερά here are probably “sanctuaries.”28 Cf.

Pol. 56.3–4), and the heorte’s presumed history make it likely that these elements, even in incipient form, were not part of the Solonian cal-endar, but τὰ πάτρια did control the sacrifices and, in Demosthenes’ thought, the institution of the choruses.31 Similarly the archon administered the pompe of the Asclepieia (Ath. Pol. 56.4), and Asclepius came to Athens only in 421 BC, but many attestations indicate that his priest sacrificed to Asclepius and the other gods οἷς πάτριον ἦν.32 These πάτρια, however, may have been inherited from the Epidaurians from whom the Athenians imported the cult. We do not know the earliest association of Athens with Amphiaraus, but he did receive a major new heorte just after 335 and τὰ πάτρια of SEG 32.110.9 may refer back only to that time.The upshot of all this is that most but perhaps not all cults, rituals, and reli-gious duties linked to τὰ πάτρια can be traced back to Solonian times, prob-ably to Solon’s religious calendar and legislation. The provisions of that were the ultimate πάτρια. Some few were perhaps added later but go back to the sixth, fifth, and possibly the fourth century.33 And there is the possibility, not remote, that some of the deities in my post-Solonian list reach back to Solonian times.3431 IG II2 780.7–8, 1011.66–7, and Dem. 21.51 and 54.

The clause, because of the typically Thucydidean abstraction, is difficult to translate if not to understand. It is more than “abandoning . . . the hereditary temples of the ancient state” (Strassler, 1996), but perhaps less than “to leave behind ancestral holy places which were a permanent heritage of their origins as a community” (Whitehead, 1986.177). The empha-sis is that the sanctuaries (not temples) were πάτρια (hence the difficulty in leaving them), and the two other clauses state for how long: “through all time” and “from their polis-status in very ancient times.” That is, they date back, if not to the beginning, to very early times of the demesmen’s political communities."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"172CHAPTER 9 Two Classes of τὰ πάτρια?It is perhaps worthwhile at this juncture to offer some refinements or elabo-rations of Chaniotis’ description of τὰ πάτρια in his 2009 article.

It is correct to say that such πάτρια for Greek worshippers “made up the central core of ritual prac-tices,” were commonly known but, unfortunately for us, rarely discussed or described, and did not have “recognisable authors” but were referred to “the ancestors.” These were the norms of the society and “are not subject to descrip-tion, modification, or negotiation.” In our texts we have seen a few examples in which individuals “sacrificed κατὰ τὰ πάτρια,” and these πάτρια may be those Chaniotis describes.35 But in an Athenian religious context, if we are correct, many of τὰ πάτρια were ascribed to Solon, were written down, were recodified and again written down, and covered a much wider range of religious activity than the details and procedures of rituals. Perhaps we need to see two “classes” of τὰ πάτρια in Athenian religious activities: those concerning ritual acts that are social and, perhaps, almost Panhellenic constructs, and those instituted, or at least codified, by identifiable ancestors for a specific polis and covering both broader and more specific topics. The latter are mostly what we find in our Athenian epigraphical and literary texts. Why Follow τὰ πάτρια?We conclude this discussion of τὰ πάτρια by stressing their religious impor-tance. Again we turn to SEG 21.469C. The Athenians were going to observe τὰ πάτρια and make additions, “so that also from the gods they may acquire the deserved return favors” (19–20).36 One observes τὰ πάτρια and, here, increases the sacrifices and honors of the god “to acquire the deserved return favors from the gods.” In the preface to this psephisma even the εὐσέβεια of the Athenians is πάτριον: “Since it is πάτριον and a custom for the Demos of Athenians and it has been handed down by their ancestors to make εὐσέβεια towards the gods of the most importance and because of these things they have acquired the glory and fame for most famous deeds on both land and sea in many infantry 35 E.g., SEG 25.140.2–8 and 45.101.25–7 and IG II2 1247.

In the Areopagiticus Isocrates praised the good, old days, the times of Solon and of the control of Athens’ political affairs by the Areopagus Council. People then, he claims, “were watching only that they not do away with any of τὰ πάτρια and they not add anything outside of τὰ νομίζομενα.”39 τὰ πάτρια were the things which “the ancestors handed down to them” (7.29–30). The prosecutor of Nicomachus in Lysias 30.18 expands for us the statements in SEG 21.469C and links, as we have seen, τὰ πάτρια to Solon’s calendar, to τὰ ἐκ τῶν κυρβέων: “Our ancestors by sacrificing τὰ ἐκ τῶν κυρβέων handed down the polis that is the greatest and most eudaimon of the Greek cities, so that it is worthwhile for us to make the same sacrifices as they did, if for no other rea-son, because of the good fortune that resulted from those sacrifices.”40 From observing τὰ πάτρια the ancestors of the Athenians won the reputation for and the glory of the most famous deeds on infantry and naval expeditions. They enjoyed good τύχη, and they handed down the greatest and most eudaimon of all Greek cities to their descendants. And, for this reason, one should continue observing τὰ πάτρια.In both the inscriptions and the literary texts, τὰ πάτρια in a religious con-text is not just a casual, random phrase but is carefully used for only certain sacrifices, rituals, and religious duties, most of which had a Solonian pedigree. Following τὰ πάτρια brought “return favors” from the gods and was in part responsible for the great successes of Athens in the good, old days, in the days 37 ἐπειδὴ πάτριόν [ἐ]στ[ιν καὶ ἔ]θος τῶι δήμωι τῶι ̓Αθηναίων καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν προγόνων π[α]ραδε[δ]ομένον περὶ πλείστου ποεῖσθαι τὴν πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς [εὐσέβειαν] καὶ διὰ ταῦτα πολλα<ῖ>ς <πεζαῖς> καὶ ἐπὶ ναυσὶ στρατεί<αι>ς τὴν κλε[ιν]οτάτων ἔργων καὶ κατὰ γῆν καὶ κατὰ θάλατταν εὐδοξία[ν] καὶ[εὐλογίαν κέκτ]ηνται. . . .38 On the text and the national, international, religious, and political contexts of this impor-tant document, see Deshours, 2011.105–113.

The implication is that performing τὰ πάτρια in our later period will bring the same good fortune, but the failure to maintain them may bring the opposite. And so the performance of τὰ πάτρια in our epigraphical texts is one more cause for giving honor and recognition to the individual who followed them. Nomoi and PsephismataIt is not possible to draw hard and fast distinctions between what polis nomoi and psephismata direct or regulate in religious matters. We have the distinct nomoi of Solon, and the clear distinction between nomoi and psephismata after 403 BC, but in between there seems to have been no distinction made by the Athenians between what are sometimes called nomoi, sometimes psephismata.41 Despite these limitations and complexities, some general pat-terns emerge.If our identification of Solonian nomoi, or nomoi believed by IV BC Athenians to be Solonian, is generally correct (Chapter 7), then the Solonian nomoi concerning religious matters appear quite different in subject from leg-islation established later by the Athenian Demos. The Solonian nomoi deal with pollution, excluding adulteresses, prostitutes, women of ill repute, and those who refuse military service or desert from the sanctuaries of the polis. One excluded illegitimate children from τὰ ἱερά of the family. One may have required audits of certain polis priests and priestesses.42 A few appear to be cult specific, concerning Demeter and Kore, the Delia, and the wife of the basileus in the rituals of the Anthesteria.43 Surviving nomoi, as distinct from psephismata, from after 403, however, almost exclusively organize and espe-cially provide financing for major religious innovations.44 They set a specific financial and administrative structure as well as a more general religious program for the long term. Psephismata then take on the specifics at a later date: the deities to receive the sacrifices, distribution of the portions, duties 41 I use here for convenience of reference the numbers assigned in Chapter 7 to nomoi of Solon [NS], nomoi / psephismata until 403 [N/PS], and nomoi [N] and psephismata [PS] after 403.42 Pollution, NS 16; adulteresses, 17; prostitutes, 15; ill repute, 14; military service, 8; illegiti-mate children, 13; audits, 11.43 Demeter, NS 14; Delia, 10; wife of basileus, 3. NS 9 might seem, by its concern with the Musaia and Hermaia, to be cult specific but probably just limited access to these to pro-tect the young participants.44 E.g., N 8, 9, 10, 11, and 20."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" 175The Four Authoritiesof individual officials, and any necessary changes to the financing.45 When Demosthenes claimed (4.35–6) that “all things” (πάντα) of the City Dionysia and Panathenaia had been assigned by nomos, he no doubt included under nomos both the nomoi and psephismata for these heortai listed in Chapter 7, as well as many others lost to us.The post-Solonian legislation in our texts is all cult specific, that is, it treats the cult of, for example, Amphiaraus or Demeter of Eleusis,46 not all cults, practices, priests, or other religious officials under one piece of legislation. If the distinction between Solonian nomoi and post-Solonian legislation is correct, then the Solonian nomoi set down some basic, general rules concern-ing Athenian religious behaviors and norms, and the post-Solonian nomoi treat special, new situations arising in the context of individual, mostly pre- existing cults.47 In this the new nomoi would appear to be largely addenda to the Solonian Code rather than changes to it. The nomoi of the demes are cult specific and go into more detail on religious arrangements, and in this they seem to combine what is separate in the polis nomoi and psephismata.After 403 polis psephismata, more than nomoi, in addition to honoring offi-cials for their services, take on the details of religious cults, sometimes assign-ing who should make the sacrifices, the distribution of the portions, and details of financing. They deal with what Chaniotis (2009.102) terms “stage directions” and “the variable ritual elements.”48 They also, unlike nomoi, are used to intro-duce single new sacrifices (vs. new annual sacrifices and heortai).49 This is true also of deme psephismata. Polis psephismata after 403 also dictated Athenian participation in foreign heortai, on occasion ordered the establishment or reestablishment of boundaries for sanctuaries, and detailed procedures for the remaking of dedications in specific sanctuaries, all occasional, not long term events. So, too, they could order the repair of a statue for a sanctuary.50In very general terms, then, we have Solonian nomoi which seem to have canonized some basic rules about restrictions created by various forms of pol-lution, about priests, priestesses, and sanctuaries, and such general matters. If we had them all, they no doubt would cover a much broader range of such subjects. Some dealt also with individual cults, with, e.g., the aparche owed 45 E.g., PS 11, 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, 24, 28, 23, and 51.46 Amphiaraus, N 8 and 9; Demeter, 15, 16, and 17.47 As in N 8, 10, 15, 16, 17, 20, 11, 12, 19, 13, 14, and 22.48 Cf.

Nomoi after 403 laid out long-term provisions for heor-tai, with heavy emphasis on the finances and the administrative structure.51 Psephismata furnished the details of these or emended them, and also dealt with more routine, ephemeral religious matters.52 And the legislation of all periods dealt almost exclusively with polis cults and deities, not with those of the deme, the family, or private associations, and this would accord with the nomos attributed to Solon [NS 12] that granted autonomy to such cults in their internal arrangements.53 Two points, both ex silentio, should be noted. Firstly, the number of cults affected by polis legislation might initially seem large, but it is a very small percentage of the literally thousands of cults and sanctuar-ies in Athens and Attica. There was, in terms of percentage, very little polis interference by legislation in the cults of Athens. And, secondly, in all of this, again with the exception of SEG 21.469C of 129/8 [PS 20], it is remarkable how much legislative activity concerning cults, apart from the honorary decrees, occurred in the fourth century, especially in the Lycurgan era, and first half of the third century, almost to disappear thereafter.54 From our documents we might conclude that polis cult was largely static in terms of development and change by legislative processes from the middle of the third century to the end of our period. OraclesAmong the oracles Pythian Apollo’s predominance in directing Athenian’s religious affairs is obvious.55 Of the thirty-one occasions listed, twenty-one are 51 Cf. Lambert, 2012a.79–80: “The institution of a new festival or the introduction of new elements into an existing one normally required a law, rather than a decree, for such mea-sures affected a fundamental aspect of the Athenian constitution, i.e., the city’s sacrificial calendar, a central component of the laws of Solon and in the revision of Athenian law effected by Nicomachos’ commission at the end of the fifth century.”52 On the distinction between laws and decrees in IV BC, see Lambert, 2012a.80. n. 65: “While it was possible to draw an abstract distinction between law as something permanent and general and decrees as specific or of particular application (Rhodes, 1987.14 and n. 48), like Rhodes, I am unconvinced by the argument of M. H. Hansen, GRBS 19 (1978), 315–20 and 20 (1979), 27–53 that this was applied systematically in practice.”53 On the autonomy of the Thracian orgeones of Bendis, see Wijma, 2014.152–3.54 On the distribution of nomoi in and after IV BC and on possible reasons behind it, see Lambert, 2012a.58–9.55 On the authority of oracles in general in the Athenian context, see Parker, 2005.105–15 and Garland, 1990.87–91."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" 177The Four Authoritiescertainly and an additional six are likely Delphic responses. Zeus of Dodona is responsible for three, two of which concern his own cult. Amphiaraus appears once, also in connection with his own cult.Of more interest are the dates. For most oracles we have only a terminus ante quem, and their date may be many years, even centuries before our source. Six of our oracles appear to date as early as the sixth century BC, eight probably from the fifth century, and eleven from the fourth century, and none certainly after that.56 The latest are from the 330’s: from Zeus of Dodona about Dione’s statue, from Amphiaraus about his sanctuary, from Apollo on a fine owed to Olympia, and from Apollo on gilding his new altar. The latest confidently dated oracle from Apollo of Delphi, on the fine to Olympia, is from 332/1. After IV BC, in fact after the age of Lycurgus, the Athenian polis seemingly did not inquire at oracles to determine religious questions but used only preexisting oracles, and did that only rarely.57The purpose for making an oracular inquiry is occasionally stated. Sometimes it is to determine if it was, in the familiar Delphic formula, λῷον καὶ ἄμεινον to do the proposed action. More interesting for our purposes is the con-cern with εὐσέβεια. One consults the oracle, to quote IG II3 292.51–3, “so that τὰ πρὸς τὼ θεὼ may be as εὐσεβῆ as possible and so that for the future nothing ἀσεβές may happen.”5856 VI BC or earlier, those concerning the Praxiergidae, the eponymous heroes, Aeacus, the Mother of the Gods, new altars in various sanctuaries, the City Dionysia, and Delos; V BC, concerning Theseus, Echetlaios, Bendis, Apollo Patroös, Alochos, the Eleusinian “first fruits,” and restoring the Delians; IV BC, concerning the Pythaïs, an altar for Ares and Athena Areia, kosmos for various deities, the gilding of Apollo’s altar, the hiera orgas, Hermes Hegemonios, an Olympic fine, the statue of Dione at Dodona, and Amphiaraus on his sanctuary. For an oracle of the Roman period, see Fontenrose, 1978.H58 = IG II2 1096. The distribution of oracles in the Greek world concerning “political” matters and personal inquiries is quite different, and for that see Bonnechere, 2013.57 Parker (2005.115) concludes that “the Athenians seldom, after 479, sent delegations to the fixed shrines except with questions about cult.” See also his discussion of the gen-eral decline of use of the oracles for political affairs after V BC (1985.320–4), now ques-tioned by Bonnechere, 2013. Also, Parker’s review of the activities of the chresmologues (2005.111–14) suggests that, however influential in political and public debates, they were not consulted on religious questions. One exception may be IG I3 40. On divine signs and omens, their interpreters, and their influence on public opinion in Athens of the classical period, see Trampedach, 2015.258–94.58 [ὅπ]ω[ς] ἂ[ν] ὡς εὐσεβέστατα ἔχει τὰ πρὸς τὼ θεὼ [καὶ μηδέποτε εἰς τὸν λοιπ]ὸ[ν] χρόνον μηδὲν ἀσεβὲς γίγνητ[αι].

Xenophon (Mem. 1.3.1) has the Delphic Oracle, when asked “how one must act concern-ing sacrifice or the service to ancestors or any other such thing,” respond that “by acting in accordance with the nomos of the city, people would be acting with “proper respect” (εὐσεβῶς).60 Theophrastus in his On Piety claimed that Apollo advised “to sacrifice κατὰ τὰ πάτρια” (Porphry, de Abst. II.59), a state-ment echoed in Anaximenes’ Rhetoric to Alexander 2. 3. We have already seen that Demosthenes (21.51–56) may be saying that oracles bid the Athenians to perform actions in the City Dionysia κατὰ τὰ πάτρια, actions which also were governed by nomoi.61 In a different interaction Lycurgus in 331 charged that Leocrates had betrayed “the temples, the statues (of the gods), the sanctuaries, and the honors (τιμαί) and sacrifices in the nomoi, the honors and sacrifices handed down by your ancestors” (Leoc. 1–2). Here the τιμαί and θυσίαι both are “in the nomoi” and are “handed down by the ancestors,” that is, they are πάτρια.62 These relatively simple situations indicate that the four authorities can be intertwined, and we now treat as examples three cases whose richer documentation allows a better look at how these intersections played out in cultic life. The fullest accounts we have, about the cult of Bendis, of the deci-sion about the sacred property of Amphiaraus, and about the renewal and revi-sion of the cult of Apollo in 129/8, suggest that often the relationship among these authorities was more complex than simpler accounts might indicate and that there was, among them, a hierarchy. BendisWe look first to the best documented case of founding a new cult, that of Bendis, and perhaps therefore the most complex example of multiple 59 Although not expressly calling them τὰ πάτρια, Plato in the Laws (5.738b5–c3) would have his lawgiver respect pre-existing sacrifices, altars, temples, and statues of the gods, some of which resulted from oracles of Apollo at Delphi, Zeus at Dodona, or Ammon at Siwa. Others were based on “old accounts” (παλαιοὶ λόγοι) which persuaded the people, either by portents or inspirations (ἐπίνοιαι) from the gods. On this see Mikalson, 2010.57.60 On this see Mikalson, 2010.58 and 131–2. Nomos here may well refer to “custom” or “tradition,” not nomos in the legal sense.61 Above, p. 126.62 τιμὰς καὶ is in only one ms., and, if excluded, as commonly, only θυσίαι would be involved here."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" 179The Four Authoritiesauthorities in the founding of and later changes to a cult.63 IG I3 136 of 413/2 (?) is a nomos / psephisma [N/PS 6] treating major elements of the cult, including prayers, sacrifices, an aparche, the statue of the goddess, a panny-chis, the priest, dispensation of perquisites, and some financial arrangements. But the cult had been founded earlier, before 429/8, and IG II2 1283 of 261/0 claims that the Demos of Athenians had given the devotees of Bendis enktesis, the right of purchasing land, and the establishment of their sanctuary (ἵδρυσιν τοῦ ἱεροῦ), “in accordance with the oracle from Dodona” (4–6).64 The polis also ordered, though apparently without oracular sanction, that the orgeones hold a pompe from the Prytaneion to Piraeus (6–12). This grant of rights described in IG II2 1283 must have predated IG I3 136 and was quite likely a (now lost) nomos / psephisma. The Thracian orgeones of Bendis believe that they are obeying “the nomos of the city” in holding their pompe. But the nomos to which they refer may have been a psephisma, like the psephisma of 333/2 which granted to the Citians enktesis and the founding of their sanctuary of Aphrodite (IG II3 337 [PS 54]),65 and so we shall treat it here.We have thus far (1) a nomos / psephisma authorizing a new cult, prob-ably only for Thracians resident in Athens, granting it ἔγκτησις and ἵδρυσις, and based on an oracle from Dodona, before 429/8. That is followed by (2) a nomos / psephisma of 413/2 significantly setting out details of the cult and per-haps representing a change of the cult from purely Thracian devotees to both Athenian and Thracian. And (3), in IG II2 1283 of 261/0 the devotees of Bendis refer to the original “nomos” (1) of the polis.In terms of the sacrifices and prayers of the heorte of Bendis, the Thracian orgeones in IG II2 1283 claim to be acting κατὰ τὰ πάτρια τῶν Θραικῶν and according to the nomos of the city.66 So we have here an oracle, Athenian nomoi / psephismata, and Thracian πάτρια. The ultimate authority, however, for the establishment of the cult is the oracle which then the psephismata and the Thracian πάτρια elaborate. In this and the cases to follow one should not imag-ine that an oracle came unexpectedly and unsought, here from Dodona but usually from Delphi, about the establishment of a new deity or a new heorte. 63 For bibliography on the introduction of the cult of Bendis to Athens, see p. 152, note 113 above.64 On IG II2 1283, see Wijma, 2014.136–9 and Jones, 1999.257–61.

The initiative comes from the Athenians, the Athenians pass a psephisma to consult the oracle, the oracle approves of the plan, and then follows the legislation that implements the initiative.67 The particulars of the cult are then determined by the devo-tees. But the oracle is the ultimate divine sanction of the initiative, and with-out its approval there would be no new cult. AmphiarausAt some time in the period 330–324 the Athenians decided to divide newly acquired public lands among the ten tribes, with pairs of tribes receiving allot-ments. After the division had been made and some incomes received, the concern arose whether one of the parcels was in fact sacred to Amphiaraus. It was decided to have three citizens sleep in the temple of Amphiaraus to receive divine instruction. Euxenippus, one of the three, reported a dream that apparently favored the tribes’ claims over those of Amphiaraus. Polyeuctus, dissatisfied with the outcome, proposed a psephisma that the two tribes give up the land to Amphiaraus and that the other tribes compensate them. The proposal was defeated in the Ekklesia, and Polyeuctus was charged with and convicted of making an illegal proposal and was fined twenty-five drachmas. Not content, Polyeuctus then in court charged that Euxenippus had falsely reported the dream. Lycurgus gave a now lost speech against Euxenippus, and Hyperides gave a speech (4) in support of him, a speech which survives and is the source for all the information on the events.68 The outcome of the trial is not known. We have here an instance of the interplay of divination and various legislative and legal maneuvers. When uncertainty about the land arose, the Athenians probably proposed through a psephisma the consulta-tion of Amphiaraus. Hyperides considers Euxenippus’ dream as “what the god (Amphiaraus) ordered” (4.14), but Polyeuctus was prepared to coun-termand that with a psephisma. When that failed for whatever reason, he attempted through the legal system to invalidate the dream. Hyperides (4.15) claims that Polyeuctus should not have proposed the psephisma but should rather have sent to Delphi to find the truth. For Hyperides, apparently, the proper procedure would have been to challenge one divination with another, here another that was more authoritative, not to introduce legislative steps. 67 For a similar procedure for “political” (vs. religious) questions, see Bonnechere, 2013, esp. 373–4.68 On this speech and all matters concerning it, see Whitehead, 2000.153–262."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":" 181The Four AuthoritiesIn any case, the authority of divination is apparently regarded by all as primary, and the dispute concerns only human falsifying of it. The Refurbishing of Some Cults of ApolloIn 129/8, the year before an Athenian Pythaïs, Timarchus of Sphettos, tamias of the Boule, before the Boule “revived” some oracles of Apollo and the “exist-ing honors (τὰ ὑπάρχοντα . . . [τίμ]ια) assigned through nomoi (δ[ιὰ νόμων τεταγμέν]<α>) to the god” (SEG 21.469C. 15–17 [PS 20]).69 Xenophon of Sunium then made a formal proposal to the Boule that included additional honors for Apollo, additions to those previously passed by psephismata. These include more sacrifices and pompai.70 The personnel and financing for the sacrifices, prayers, and pompai, for probably both τὰ πάτρια and τὰ ἐπίθετα, are then detailed. The Boule then by a probouleuma voted to recommend to the Ekklesia to do “the other things for Apollo according to oracles and for the basileus, archon, and the strategoi to sacrifice sacrifices in addition to those previously established by psephismata (ἐπὶ τοῖς προεψηφμισμένοις).” They were to perform the sacrifices and make the pompai at the Thargelia each year, leading sacri-ficial victims that are as beautiful as possible (22–7). The purpose was, as we have seen before, “so that they may acquire from the gods the deserved return favors” (19–20). We have here prior oracles and sacrifices and honors of the god, some of which have been established previously by nomoi and psephis-mata. They are τὰ πάτρια for these late second-century Athenians. Timarchus detailed these for the Boule. The probouleuma of the Boule was then accepted, through a psephisma, by the Ekklesia and hence published on stone. We have here the full interplay of all four religious authorities: oracles, τὰ πάτρια, and nomoi and psephismata. But, again, when included in the text, the oracles are always given first.In the foundation of cults and the management of sacred property, oracles or other divination, psephismata, the secular law, and τὰ πάτρια could be inter-woven. Psephismata could order the use of divination; the divination could order or approve of a new cult, a reworking of an old cult, or matters of the 69 If this is the correct reading.

In the section on Apollo Patroös it is claimed that Apollo through oracles ordered the Athenians to “entreat” (λ[ι]ταν[εῦσ]α[ι]) the god called Patroös and to make the [πατρί]ου[ς θυσί]ας at the appropriate times of the year to Apollo, sacrificing as is πάτριον for the Demos (11–14).

Also, as in the cult of Bendis, τὰ πάτρια of the worshippers could come into play. But, despite the number of factors, at the apex of authority stands the divination—it gave the authoritative response, and the other elements were only introduced to occasion it, to implement it, or, probably in rare cases, to challenge it.71 Cf. Parker (2005a.67), “One was also supposed to worship the gods ‘in accord with tra-dition’ (‘as modified by decrees of the assembly,’ we must add, to make the formula fit known facts), not in one’s own way.”"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Part 3Approbation and Authority∵"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���6 | doi ��.��63/97890043�9�96_0�3CHAPTER 10The Rhetoric to AlexanderThe author of the Rhetoric to Alexander, probably Anaximenes, proffered at the mid- or late IV BC advice and “talking points” to orators.1 Book II is devoted to those planning to make “deliberative” speeches before the Boule or the Ekklesia. Here he introduces seven topics, but the first, as is always appropriate, is περὶ τῶν ἱερῶν.2 Of this potentially large subject he describes only three arguments to be made, for the maintenance of established ἱερά or for the enhancement or diminution of them (2.3–12). This document echoes and reinforces much that we have seen already piecemeal under both Part 1 (Approbation) and Part 2 (Authority) and offers an opportunity to review this in a larger context. We therefore offer a translation of this valuable document and a commentary on elements that have waxed large in this study.(1) Concerning “sacred things” (τῶν ἱερῶν) it is necessary to speak in three ways: for we shall say that we must guard carefully the established ones (τὰ καθεστῶτα), or that we must change them to be more μεγαλοπρεπές, or to be more humble (ἐπὶ τὸ ταπεινότερον). (2) When we say that we must guard carefully the existing ones, we will find starting points (for our arguments) (3) from what is just, saying that among all people it is unjust to transgress the ancestral customs (τὰ πάτρια ἔθη) and (4) that all the oracular responses (τὰ μαντεῖα πάντα) order humans to make their sacri-fices κατὰ τὰ πάτρια, (5) and that it is necessary that there remain the attention (τὰς ἐπιμελείας) about the gods which those who first founded cities and established the sacred rites (τὰ ἱερά) had; (6) from what is advantageous, saying that in terms of taxes (?) it will be advantageous for the private citizen or the community of the city when the victims (τὰ ἱερά) are sacrificed according κατὰ τὰ πάτρια and (7) that the citizens will profit in terms of courage since the citizens would be more courageous, feeling a sense of honor (φιλοτιμούμενοι), when the hoplites, cavalrymen, and light armed troops escort them in pompai; (8) from what is beautiful 1 Chiron, 2007, dates it to about 340 and is inclined to accept its common ascription to Anaximenes of Lampsacus (ca. 380–320). The author’s viewpoint is, Chiron claims (p. 92), “definitely that of a Greek man living in the city of Athens or teaching in Athens.” For a trans-lation and discussion see Mirhady, 2011.2 See, e.g., Mikalson, 1983.13–17."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"186CHAPTER 10(ἐκ τοῦ καλοῦ), if the result is that the heortai are made splendid (λαμπράς); (9) from pleasure, if there is some elaboration directed towards spectacle (πρὸς τὸ θεωρεῖσθαι) concerning the sacrifices of the gods; (10) from what is practical, if there has been neither a deficiency nor an excess in these sacrifices. When we speak in favor of the existing sacred things, so must we proceed and examine them from what has been said or from similar things, and examine how it is possible to teach people about what is being said.(11) But when we are advising to change (μεθιστάναι) the rituals (ἱεροποιίας) to make them more μεγαλοπρεπεῖς, we will have plausible starting points for disturbing (τὰ πάτρια) by saying that to add to existing ones is not to destroy but to augment (αὔξειν) them; (12) secondly, that it is reasonable that the gods are better intentioned (εὐνουστέρους) to those who honor them more; (13) thirdly, that not even our fathers held their sacrifices always in the same way but rather, looking at current condi-tions and their successes, were establishing in law (ἐνομοθέτουν) the “ser-vice” (θεραπείαν) towards the gods both individually and communally; (14) and, fourthly, just as in all other things, so in this way we manage our cities and private estates. (15) And say also that, when these (new) things have been done, there will be some benefit or splendor (λαμπρότης) or pleasure for the city, pursuing the topic just as has been described in the previous cases.(16) When we are reducing the sacred things so that they become more humble, one must bring the argument back to current circumstances, that is, (17) why the citizens are more poorly off than before; (18) sec-ondly, that it is not reasonable that the gods find charis (χαίρειν) in the cost of the animals sacrificed but in the demonstrations of “proper respect” (ταῖς εὐσεβείαις) of those who are sacrificing; (19) thirdly, that both gods and men judge foolish those who do what is beyond their means; (20) fourthly, that matters about civil expenses depend not only on humans but also on successes and failures.These and similar starting points we will have for the propositions concerning sacrifices. (21) But so that we may know how to describe things and propose nomoi concerning the best sacrifice (τὴν κρατίστην θυσίαν), let us define also this. The best sacrifice of all is that which (22) is “religiously correct” (ὁσίως) in respect to the gods, (23) is moderate in respect to expenses, (24) is beneficial in respect to war, (25) and is splendid (λαμπρῶς) in respect to viewings (τὰς θεωρίας).

(30) From these we will prepare κάλλιστα the things relating to the gods. (2. 3–12).In treating τὰ ἱερά the author invokes the religious authorities we have seen before: oracles (4), τὰ πάτρια (4, 6, 11, 26), and nomoi (13, 21).3 Oracles are men-tioned only briefly to assert, as we have seen before, the importance of τὰ πάτρια. Two of the references to τὰ πάτρια (4, 6) explicitly concern sacrifices, and so may the other two (11, 26). Nomoi are both preexisting ones (13) and new ones which might be proposed (21). We do not find psephismata, but the author is giving arguments to be used before the Boule and Ekklesia where psephismata are made. In many cases, theoretically, the arguments he pro-poses would result in psephismata περὶ τῶν ἱερῶν.The author limits himself to sacrifices (4, 6, 13, 18, 20, 21), heortai (8), and pompai (7, 27, 29). He may be distinguishing between ἱερά that are καθεστῶτα (1, 10) and those that are πάτρια (4, 6, 10, 11, 26). Presumably not all of the former were the latter. The author speaks of “change” (μεθίστασθαι) of ἱερά (1, 11), not of elimination (καταλύεσθαι, 26). So, too, of “reducing” them (16), not eliminating them. One can imagine changes to τὰ πάτρια without the elimina-tion of the central event. A sacrifice to Athena Polias at the Panathenaia on Hekatombaion 28 may have been τὸ πάτριον, but the number of animals sac-rificed was not πάτριον and could be changed from year to year. So, too, could the costs of the sacrifices, of the pompe, and of the whole heorte rise or fall from year to year. The concerns of the Rhetoric are very much financial and economic, as are those of Lysias 30, but with a more theoretical emphasis on moderation (10, 23, 27, 28) and a practical concern with current economic cir-cumstances (13, 14, 16, 17, 20), both highly Aristotelian.If the polis spends more on τὰ ἱερά, the movement is ε��πὶ τὸ μεγαλοπρεπέστερον (1, 11), and we will see in Chapter 13 the connotations of both financial generos-ity and public benefaction and display in μεγαλοπρέπεια. If the polis spends less, the movement is ἐπὶ τὸ ταπεινότερον (1, 16), a surprisingly negative word for the point the author is trying to make but the usual antonym of μεγαλοπρεπής.One can argue for greater expenditure ἐκ τοῦ καλοῦ, and this is perhaps the surest example we have seen of καλόν in a religious context being “beautiful,” of τὸ καλόν pointing to an esthetics of Athenian religious practice. The example 3 That it is a matter of justice (τὸ δίκαιον) not to transgress τὰ πάτρια ἒθη (3) may indicate that it is also a matter of nomoi."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"188CHAPTER 10the author gives is the “splendor” of heortai (8) and sacrifices (15, 25), and that “splendor” is what is “seen,” is in the “spectacle” (8, 15, 25, 28). The author dis-tinguishes between the beauty (8) and the pleasure (9), but both result from the “spectacle” of τὰ ἱερά. They are expected to be splendid, beautiful, and pleasurable.4Distinct from the esthetic argument is that from the advantages that τὰ ἱερά bring to the city, and these advantages include greater revenues (6),5 an uplift in physical courage among the citizens (7, 24, 29),6 and, the only “religious” purpose given, the winning of the εὔνοια of the gods by honoring them (12).7 The last is a concept we find echoed in our epigraphical texts.The author introduces the concept of ὁσιότης, “religious correctness,” which is very important in the oratorical and philosophical traditions but is, some-what surprisingly, virtually absent from our epigraphical sources.8 For the author the best sacrifice must be, first of all, “religiously correct” (22), and will be so if “τὰ πάτρια are not done away with” (26). So it is not only “just” (before men) but also “correct” (before the gods) to maintain τὰ πάτρια. One reason that “religious correctness” does not occur in our many honorary decrees may be that the status of the honorand “before men” is, in these contexts, much more in the foreground than his status “before the gods.”Finally, the author claims that from his teachings “we will prepare κάλλιστα the things relating to the gods” (30), the meaning of which statement I have endeavored better to understand in this book.94 On the nature of heortai in this regard, see Mikalson, 1982.5 The financial advantage to the citizen or city here is hard to discern, unless the speaker has in mind a source of revenue such as the dermaticon fund of IG II2 1496, but even this was a means only to recover part of what the state had already spent.6 That observers felt personal courage when they saw armed fellow countrymen in a pompe (7, 24, 29) is an interesting insight not, I think, paralleled elsewhere.7 That one could win greater εὔνοια from the gods by honoring them more (12), that is, by spending more money on τὰ ἱερά, seems to have been the common view. The counter argu-ment offered here (18), that the gods have more charis for εὐσέβεια than for the number of victims, comes from philosophy and seems to have remained there.

I would like to build on that excellent study in a few ways: by extending it into the Hellenistic period; by extending it beyond polis cults to deme, genos, and the private cults of various types; and by contrasting “rights” to “actions,” that is, what the Ekklesia, Boule, and various officials actu-ally did in contrast to what they may have had the authority to do.Garland explicitly treats religious authority within the polis. In two papers Sourvinou-Inwood properly draws attention to the centrality of the individual polis in a Panhellenic context, to the fact that significant elements of Greek religion varied from polis to polis, and that we should therefore view the polis as a central organizing unit for Greek religion.2 This is quite different from religious authority within the polis, but Sourvinou-Inwood moves from one to the other, with the result that she concludes “that in the classical period polis religion encompassed, symbolically legitimated, and regulated all religious activity within the polis, not only the cults of polis subdivisions such as the demes, but also cults which modern commentators are inclined to consider private, such as, for example, oikos cults” (1990.322).Since Sourvinou-Inwood’s papers, scholars have been reasserting the supremacy of Athenian polis control over the religion within its borders.3 Those who make such claims depend on Sourvinou-Inwood, sometimes refer-ring to Garland’s article. But, in fact, Garland offers a much more nuanced and complex picture. He introduces his study by claiming that “Religious authority in archaic and classical Athens was not in fact the preserve of any single social 1 Garland, 1984, reprised in 1990. For an excellent modern survey of the topic, see Deshours, 2011.19–22.2 Sourvinou-Inwood, 1990 and 1988, both conveniently reprinted in Buxton, 2000.13–55.3 Horster, 2010.179: “It was the assembly of the (male) Athenian citizens that decided about all subjects concerning cult and religion.” Rhodes, 2009.13, “Every major aspect of religion in Athens was, or could be, controlled by the organs of the state.” For my study Rhodes’ “could be” clause is of major importance."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"190CHAPTER 11or political class, caste, or milieu. Its essence was complex and it had many sources and outlets” (75), and he concludes it with “religious authority . . . was the monopoly neither of the citizen body as a whole nor of any particular group of individuals within it. It was a discrete prerogative shared out among a number of corporations comprising amateurs as well as experts, clergy as well as laity” (p. 120). So, we need to decide whether, as Sourvinou-Inwood and others would have it, the Athenian polis encompassed and regulated all reli-gious activity in its territory, or, as Garland argues, that religious authority was fragmented, broken up among various legislative, administrative, priestly, and elected, allotted, or appointed individuals and groups.It is critically important to understand the nature, extent, limitations, and realities of polis “control” within the polis if we wish to understand further the Greek religious experience. What aspects of religion did the polis have the right or exercise the right to control and manage? Did it exercise control over only the polis cults, by which I mean those cults available to all citizens of Athens? Was it really, as Sourvinou-Inwood claims (1990.302), “the ordered commu-nity, the polis, which assumed the role played in Christianity by the Church?” Is it a fact that “polis religion embraces, contains, and mediates all religious discourse?” What was its relationship to deme, gentilic, household, and private cults? What would all of this mean in the religious experience of the individual citizens? Did they feel the presence or the authority of the polis in all their religious activities? Or in what aspects of them? Or, to throw the question in another direction, was Greek religion at Athens a carefully ordered, directed, and managed religious system, or was it a patchwork that developed from ad hoc situations at various times? And, in what ways was the “polis” itself a reli-gious agent, making prayers, sacrifices, dedications, and such things? How, when, and where did it express itself as a religious agent? The Ekklesia and the DemosThe highest authority in Athens was, of course, the Ekklesia, the legisla-tive body including all citizens. It alone passed nomoi and psephismata that were in force for all living in Attica.4 Through these nomoi and psephismata it could have controlled every aspect of religion, but did it?5 It had the right, in 4 On the authority and powers of the Ekklesia and on their limitations, see Hansen, 1987, esp. 94–124.5 If one looks only at what the Ekklesia could do, Parker (2005.88) is absolutely correct in this statement, “If we ignore here issues of influence and authority and look merely at the formal"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" 191Authority Of The PolisGarland’s term, but how did it exercise that right? The first item on the agenda for two of the four meetings of the Ekklesia each month was τὰ ἱερά “the sacred things,”6 the mere fact of which should give pause to those making another general claim, that Athenians did not distinguish “religion” from their other activities, that, in their own terminology, they did not distinguish between τὰ ἱερά and τὰ ὅσια, i.e., between the “sacred things” and those that were under “no religious restrictions.”7We have in the nomoi and psephismata surveyed in Chapter 7 a fairly large sample of what the Ekkesia must have considered under τὰ ἱερά, and that was, almost exclusively, matters concerning the polis deities (Athena Polias, Nike, Asclepius, Hephaestus, Theseus, Dionysus Eleuthereus, Demeter and Kore, Agathe Tyche, Apollo Patroös, Mother of the Gods, and Poseidon of Piraeus) and the polis heortai (Panathenaia, City Dionysia, Thargelia, Dionysia in Piraeus, Lenaia, and Amphiaraia).8 So, initially, the number of deities with which the Demos through the Ekklesia involved itself was rather small. But what activi-ties of the cults of these polis deities did the Ekklesia in fact regulate? Here we can turn to Garland’s three general categories of religious authority in the Demos: finances, prosecution of crimes, and “the power to initiate.” The nomoi and psephismata surveyed in Chapter 7 are, in fact, predominately concerned with the finances of new and existing cults, whether it be the costs of sacrifi-cial animals or the leasing of sacred properties. This more-or-less persistent concern with finances apparent in these nomoi and psephismata supports the view that the “so-called” polis religious calendar of festivals and sacri-fices, the one initially organized by Solon, then “written up” by Nicomachus and his associates in 404 and soon thereafter published on stone, was right to legislate, the matter is very simple: during the period open to our observation, power lies in the council and assembly and in no other place. The people decides what gods are to be worshipped by what rituals at what times and places and at what expense; it regulates too the duties and terms of office of priests and priestesses, and creates new priesthoods at need.” If one looks at what the Ekklesia and Boule did do, the situation is much more complicated, as I hope to show. It will be argued in this Chapter that very few of items that Parker assigns to the legislative right of the Boule and Ekklesia were, in fact, ever or primarily determined by their legislation. This important distinction had been mentioned in passing by Aleshire (1994.11–12).6 Aeschin. 1.23 and Ath. Pol. 43.6. See Hansen, 1987.27–8.7 Rhodes (2009.13) emphasizes the “embeddedness” of religion in Athenian political and social life but recognizes the significance of the distinction between ἱερά and ὅσια in the agenda of the Ekklesia.8 On the Dionysia in Piraeus as a polis festival, see Ath.

It was not intended primarily to prescribe the deities, victims, and days of sacrifice for the Athenians but to prescribe the costs for the victims and for the emoluments for officials.9 So, too, the numerous and varied inventories of dedications are there to record their financial value and the transition of their safekeeping from one year’s set of officials to another’s. So, thus far, the Ekklesia’s interest seems to be in polis deities only, and primarily in the finances of the cult, often down to the obol.In one particular way the polis asserted its control over some cults. From at least 434/3 it began the practice, in times of financial emergency, of borrowing from sanctuaries, or, as it was said, from “gods,” money and dedications.10 Most familiar in this regard is Pericles’ inclusion (Th. 2.13.5) among the resources available to Athenians at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War the unminted gold and silver of the private and public dedications and “sacred equipment” (ἱερὰ σκεύη) for the pompai and agones, and such things on the Acropolis, amounting to not less than 500 talents. He added also χρήματα from “the other sanctuaries,” and concluded, no doubt shockingly, with the removable gold from the Athena statue, alone worth 40 talents. The Athenians, he said, could use this ἐπὶ σωτηρίᾳ but then were to restore it. And, in fact, the inscriptions reveal that the Athenians did just this. They melted down for coinage seven of the eight gold statues of Athena Nike in 407/6, the worst financial times of the War, and they were not “restored” until the Lycurgan period.11 The Athenians also utilized resources “from the other sanctuaries” that Pericles suggested. Some cash and precious objects, surely not all, were collected from certain sanctuaries in Attica and were deposited and stored on the Acropolis. Polis tamiai “of Athena” or “of the other gods” then were responsible for these deposits and managed payments from and to them and the eventual repayment, with interest, to the sanctuaries.12 From the records and inventories of these tamiai,13 one can isolate which deities these were.14 They include Artemis Agrotera, Bendis, Hephaestus, 9 On Solon’s calendar, Parker (1996.53) concludes, “A prime function of the sixth-century code was surely to define what monies of the Athenian people were to be expended on what gods.” See also Whitehead, 1986.174 and 186.10 On this practice, see Linders, 1987 and Parker, 1985.73.11 Mikalson, 1998.28. Such melting down of dedications into coinage was, as Linders (1987.117) states, “a rare occurrence.”12 The tamiai “of Athena” handled these matters except for 434/3 to 406/5 and 386/5 to 347/6 when the tamiai “of the other gods” managed them. On these two boards of tamiai, see Harris, 1995.11–19 and Linders, 1975.13 IG I3 369 of 426/5 and 383 of 429/8 and II2 1445–54, from 376/5 to 343/2.14 For the deities see Linders, 1975.14–16, summarized in Hansen, 1980.164."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" 193Authority Of The Polisand Theseus, and also the Anakes, Aphrodite in the Gardens, Apollo Delios, Patroös, Pythios, and Zoster, Artemis Brauronia, Artemis Mounychia, Athena at the Palladion, Athena Pallenis, Dionysus, Ge Olympia, Hephaestus, Heracles of Cynosarges, Meter at Agrai, Poseidon of Sunium, the Twelve Gods, Zeus Olympios, and Zeus Polieus. The polis took responsibility for the protection and security of some of the portable property of these gods. Only one, that of Apollo Zoster, is possibly a deme cult. All the others are, from other evi-dence, demonstrably polis cults.15 These are cults whose resources of cash and precious objects the polis thought it could collect, protect, borrow from in emergency situations, and then repay with interest. The polis managed these collected resources, but there is no evidence that this management was extended to the internal operations of each cult.16 The polis was obviously in control, but, again, primarily in financial matters, and there is no indication that the polis by this means controlled their priests, priestesses, local cultic officials, or rituals.For “the prosecution of crimes of a religious nature,” Garland describes the Ekklesia’s involvement in crimes of theft of sanctuary property, asebeia, and atheism, and misconduct in connection with certain religious festivals (79–80).17 These festivals included the City Dionysia, Lenaia, Thargelia, Eleusinian Mysteries, and the Dionysia at Piraeus, all polis festivals (vs. deme and private festivals). The cults of the deities involved in those remanded by the Ekklesia to trial for asebeia are the herms of the Agora, the Eleusinian Mysteries, and “the gods of the polis” in general, as in Socrates’ case. Again, the Demos, i.e., the Ekklesia, seems to involve itself only in polis cults in regard to crimes committed.Most interesting in terms of what the Demos could do versus what it did do was its power to initiate. We have seen, and Garland gives further examples (78), the Ekklesia’s role in marking out, preserving, and adjusting the boundar-ies of sanctuaries, both old and new, both, apparently, public and private. It also had sole authority to grant the requests and initiate the procedures by which new cults, as that of Bendis or Isis, could gain the right to practice (ierosis) and to acquire land for their sanctuaries (enktesis).18 Most known cults intro-duced in this way were of foreigners (Thracians for Bendis, Egyptians for Isis, 15 For the evidence, see Linders, 1975.14–16 and references in our text to the individual deities.16 Hansen, 1980.164–5.17 On procedures for the last, see Hansen, 1987.117.

The initiative in this area allowed the Ekklesia, in terms of boundaries, to settle some religious versus religious or religious versus secular disputes, and, in terms of new cults, to select among foreign influences.Another important initiative detailed by Garland was the Ekklesia’s author-ity to appeal to Delphi in religious matters, that is, by a psephisma to order the asking of divine approval for whatever innovation or change it was planning.22 It did so most famously in the matter of the names of the ten new tribal heroes in the time of Cleisthenes, and it did so also for the new cults of Bendis and Isis. But the record of appeals to Delphi, as described in Chapter 8, suggests that the Ekklesia did this infrequently and, again, primarily in regard to polis cults, as concerning the Eleusinian aparche and, a rare instance after late IV BC, the remodeling of Apollo cults in 129/8.The Demos also by a psephisma could decide to send again or for the first time a theoria to a festival held in another city, as the Pythaïs to Delphi and the theoriai to Zeus of Nemea or Zeus of Dodona.23Of major importance is the Ekklesia’s power of initiative in ordering new sacrifices, new heortai and pompai, and in the making of dedications. We can include under “dedications” virtually everything “given” to the individual gods by the polis as a whole: temples like the Erechtheum and Parthenon for Athena Polias, altars and other buildings built at polis expense in sanctuaries of polis deities, statues like the Athena Parthenos and Promachos, perhaps also the 1/60 of the tribute the Athenians took in every year under their empire,24 and many more such things. Such gifts to the gods are far too numerous to cata-logue here, but we offer some examples.19 For the Citians, IG II3 337.20 Garland, 1992.116–35.21 Artemis Aristoboule, Garland, 1992.73–8; Muses, Mikalson, 1998.64–5; and Dionysus, ibid. 204–6.22 On this see also Parker, 2005.90.23 Pythaïs, FD 3.2.27.4–6; Zeus of Nemea, Dem. 21.115; and Zeus of Dodona, Hyp. 4.24–5.24 Meyer, 2013.468–9."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":" 195Authority Of The PolisThe majority of new polis sacrifices and votive and thank dedications appear associated especially with military victories, and they must have come from the initiative of the Demos as expressed in the Ekklesia.25 Among the more famous new sacrifices resulting from a vow is the sacrifice of goats to Artemis, to be in equal number to the number of Persians the Athenians might kill at Marathon, but, after thousands of Persians were killed, the number of goats sacrificed was limited in practice to 500 each year. For 406 there are the vow and rewards to Zeus, Apollo, and the Erinyes concerning the battle of Arginusae.26 To votive offerings we may add “thank-offerings,” given after the victory but not promised before it. Such is the earliest known dedication of the profits of a war, from the war against the Boeotians and Chalcidians, a bronze four-horse chariot dedicated by “the sons of the Athenians.”27 Dem. 19.272 claims that the Athenians “dedicated” the Athena Promachos from the money which they received from their allies in the Persian Wars as an ἀριστεῖον. The thank-offering after a victory might consist of a tithe of the booty taken or of a dedication financed by that tithe. Pausanias (1.28.2) terms the Athena Promachos and the bronze chariot from the victory over the Boeotians and Chalcidians “tithes” (δεκάται), and Diodorus (11.62.3) describes the tithe given by Athenians to Apollo after the battle at the Eurymedon among sev-eral dedications they made at Delphi following the Persian Wars: statues of Apollo and Athena, of their eponymous heroes, and of the strategos Miltiades; the treasury of the Athenians; a bronze palm tree and a statue of Athena; and golden shields.28 The Athenians also dedicated in their own sanctuaries, surely through the acts of the Ekklesia, weapons captured in warfare, like the breast-plate of Masistius and the dagger of Mardonius after the battle of Plataea in 479 or the spear butt taken on the Lesbos campaign and dedicated to the 25 Pritchett (1971 and 1979) has collected from literary and epigraphical sources such sacri-fices and dedications from throughout the Greek world and offers valuable background on the practices in general.26 Marathon, Xen.

The Demos is rarely listed as the dedicator in the inventories,30 but then the dedicator is not named for many of the dedica-tions. One major group of such dedications is the gold crowns awarded to the Athenians by other poleis. These were stored in the Parthenon and were no doubt dedicated routinely by the Demos to Athena.31 Noteworthy also are the two statue bases at Eleusis dedicated for unknown reasons by the Demos to the “two goddesses” (IG II2 2795 and 2795a).To the vows above we may add those which the herald was occcasionally ordered to make if an undertaking turned out “beneficial” to the Athenians, such as the sacrifice to the Twelve Gods, the Semnai, and Heracles for the send-ing out of kleruchs to Potidaea in 362/1 (IG II2 114) and that to Zeus Olympios, Athena Polias, and Demeter and Kore for an alliance with the Arcadians, Achaeans, Eleans, and Phleiasians in that same year (R&O #41.2–12).32We may also view temples as dedications.33 Under the Demos’ control seems to have been the proposal, the design, and the costs of the temples and other structures which adorned the sanctuaries of polis deities. Several, but certainly not all, temples in Athens were financed largely by spoils of war or revenues from the empire,34 but it was the Ekklesia that made the final decisions to use such monies for temples and altars and such things of the polis deities.35Most of our examples of polis-initiated new sacrifices and major dedica-tions come from the fifth century.

One exam-ple, notable for its isolation in IV BC and later, is the sacrifices and pompai in celebration for a victory over Philip in 339 (Dem. 18.216–18), a year before the decisive defeat at Chaeronea.36 These sacrifices are reminiscent of the one-time sacrifices which Archinus proposed in 403/2 for the patriots who marched from Phyle and eventually overthrew the Thirty Tyrants and restored the democracy (Aeschines 3.187). In the fourth century, after Chaeronea, the Athenians established a new heorte, for the god Amphiaraus in their newly acquired land, and in ca. 224 they instituted, for largely political purposes, a new heorte to honor Ptolemy III Euergetes, the Ptolemaia.37 Apart from those initiatives, in the fourth century and thereafter the Athenians seem only to have tinkered with existing polis cults—repairing sanctuaries and dedications, adding an altar here or there, refurbishing some cults, as of Apollo in 129/8, and refining rules governing individual cults.38 They no longer had the occasions or the resources for the type of new sacrifices and dedications characteristic of the fifth century.The Demos, through the Boule, also showed a natural concern for and regu-larly received reports from the prytaneis on the omens of sacrifices they made before meetings of the Ekklesia to Apollo Prostaterios and Artemis Boulaia and related gods. They also received occasional reports from the priest of Asclepius on his sacrifices “for the health and safety of the Boule and the Demos of Athenians.” At least once, but not at all commonly it appears, they received such reports on sacrifices from an archon, a demarch of Eleusis in 165/4, the epimeletai of the Mysteries, an agonothetes of the City Dionysia, a priest of Amphiaraus, a priest of Zeus Soter of the Stoa of Zeus, a priest of Zeus Soter of Piraeus and the epimeletai, a priest of Dionysus in Piraeus and the hieropoioi, theoroi, a priestess of Athena Polias, a priestess of Aglauros, and a strategos.39 36 Somewhat unusual are the sacrifices instituted “on behalf of those who were campaign-ing” to Athena Nike, Agathe Tyche, and the Soteres (here Antigonus Monophthalmus and Demetrius Poliorcetes) that the Athenians made in 304/3 (Agora 16.114). Normally such sacrifices are the results of vows or thank-offerings, not for the welfare of those on campaigns. This might be put down as another of the distortions of Athenian religious practices under the influence of Antigonus and Demetrius, for which see Mikalson, 1998.75–104.37 See Mikalson, 1998.108, 179–81, and 275.38 Lycurgus, who from 336/5–324 devoted significant polis funds to religious purposes, con-centrated almost exclusively on existing cults.

Also, all concern polis cults.Finally, we add another initiative, important for this study, that the Ekklesia had and exercised the right to “honor” those who performed religious activi-ties. Through honorary decrees, through the public proclamation and publish-ing of the honors, and through the inscriptions, dedications, and statues that resulted,40 the polis was able to publicize and reward the efforts they approved of and thus to shape the religious behavior of individuals into the form that the polis as a whole, as represented by the Ekklesia, wished. They could induce individuals into doing their religious duties better, more beautifully, and, sometimes perhaps, more generously, and they did this only for polis, not private, cults.41The authority of the Demos over priests and priestesses has been, I think, overstated in modern scholarship. Garland (1990.86) claims that “it fixed the emoluments to which the individual priests and priestesses were entitled,” and that the Demos “subjected both gentile and democratic priests to a financial audit at the expiry of their term of office.” Each claim, properly understood, is correct, but it has been wrongly expanded by others to general polis control over all priests and priestesses in Athens.42The claim that the Demos “fixed the emoluments” for priests and priest-ess is usually based on IG I3 35, a psephisma which deals with, among other things, the selection by lot of the priestess of Athena Nike “from all Athenian women,” the payment to her of 50 drachmas,43 and the awarding to her of “the legs and skins of the polis (sacrifices) (το͂ν δεμοσίον).” The Demos clearly had the authority to make such determinations, but did it do so regularly? Here the special circumstances of this document, dated ca. 448–424, may come into 40 As, for example, the pillar honoring the priest Aristocrates (IG II2 3454) or two statue bases from Eleusis which honor individuals for, among other things, having been epimel-etai of the Mysteries (I. Eleusis 186 and 286). On these see Perrin-Saminidayar, 2012.137.41 For a more general formulation of this, not just in terms of religious matters, and with abundant bibliography, see Meyer, 2013.485–8 and Lambert, 2011. For honorary decrees stimulating desirable political activity, see Hansen, 1987.114–15. Luraghi (2010.250) offers a nice summary, from another viewpoint: “The social approval expressed by the honours was the result of fulfilling publicly articulated norms of behavior.”42 E.g., Wohl, 1996.63, “The powerlessness of the gentile priests against the ever-increasing control of the demos over ritual.” On many of these issues, but from a different viewpoint and sometimes with different conclusions, see Parker, 2005.90–9.43 A provision restated about twenty years later (IG I3 36), indicating that it was probably an annual payment."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" 199Authority Of The Polisplay.44 It may mark the transition of this most important polis priesthood from the control of a genos to the polis as a whole, and hence the need to state the conditions of employment. And this statement concerns only financial—the portions of the victims had real monetary value—, not ritual matters. Better evidence comes from the Athenian State Calendar of sacrifices (SEG 52.48) which, revised by Nicomachus, survives in numerous fragments re-edited in 2002 by Stephen Lambert. There, amidst the listing of days, deities, victims, and costs there are, occasionally, indicated hierosyna and apometra, both appar-ently cash payments or things able to be given a cash value, sometimes with the priest or priestess to receive them named, for example, frag. 6A1. 1–3, “To priestess of Athena Polias, apometra.”45 Here the polis, as it were, “fixed” these payments by a psephisma approving the new calendar and by engraving them on stone, but there is no indication of who or what group first “established” them. That probably varied from cult to cult. And, also, the primary purpose of the calendar is financial, to “fix” the various costs of the sacrifices of the polis.46 Here again we have an expression of the Demos’ power to order polis religious affairs, but doing so primarily in financial matters.The same might be said of the financial audits of priests. But of which priests? Aeschines 3.17–18 has been taken to mean all priests in Attica, but I think that is incorrect.In this city, which is so ancient and great in magnitude, no one is free from audit, no one of those who in any way have entered into public affairs. And I will teach you this first in the unexpected cases. For exam-ple, the nomos orders that priests and priestesses be subject to audit, all together and each separately, those who receive only γέρα and pray to the 44 IG I3 35.9–11 and 36 (for Aleshire’s mistaken 34).4–7 are likewise the only evidence Aleshire (1994.15) offers that the polis “often paid priestly salaries.” It gives the wrong impression to conclude from a “house” of the priestess at Eleusis (I. Eleusis 177.74, 127, 293) that “in some cases [the state] provided priestly housing” (Aleshire, 1994.15). Eleusis and its cults were very much the exception.45 ἱερώσυνα (“priestly things”) and ἀπόμετρα (“shares” or “distributions”) are distinct in these texts. Although the texts are too fragmentary and laconic to allow any real conclusions, it may be noteworthy that for ἀπόμετρα specific priestesses are designated as recipients, for ἱερώσυνα no recipients are designated. This might suggest that ἱερώσυνα are to cover priests’ expenses beyond that of the victim, whereas ἀπόμετρα are truly the priestly per-quisites or emoluments, usually (the value of ) the parts of the victims awarded to them. On these see Lambert, 2002.398–9.46 Lambert, 2002.357: “The financial aspect of this sacrificial calendar was patently funda-mental.” Cf.

And not only privately, but also the gene together, the Eumolpidae and Kerykes and all the others.47The context of this comment is a courtroom speech, in front of a jury made up of a representative sample of the Athenian Demos. Aeschines speaks of priests who “pray to gods on your behalf,” and the “your” there refers to not just the jurors but to the Demos of Athenians they represent. This whole passage is best taken as referring to priests and priestesses of polis cults, minimally all such priests and priestesses who administer polis funds or receive perqui-sites paid for by the polis.48 “Privately” would indicate the priests individually. Interesting here is the marking out of those priests who were selected from gene but served polis cults.49 For their financial misdeeds their gene as well as the individuals themselves were held responsible. One should not, I believe, conclude from this passage that all priests and priestesses in Attica, of deme cults, of private associations, and such were subject to polis audits.5047 ἐν γὰρ ταύτῃ τῇ πόλει, οὕτως ἀρχαίᾳ οὔσῃ καὶ τηλικαύτῃ τὸ μέγεθος, οὐδείς ἐστιν ἀνυπεύθυνος τῶν καὶ ὁπωσοῦν πρὸς τὰ κοινὰ προσεληλυθότων. διδάξω δ ̓ ὑμᾶς πρῶτον ἐπὶ τῶν παραδόξων. οἷον τοὺς ἱερέας καὶ τὰς ἱερείας ὑπευθύνους εἶναι κελεύει ὁ νόμος, καὶ συλλήβην ἅπαντας καὶ χωρὶς ἐκάστους κατὰσῶμα, τοὺς τὰ γέρα μόνον λαμβάνοντας καὶ τὰς εὐχὰς ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς εὐχομένους, καὶ οὐ μόνον ἰδίᾳ, ἀλλὰ καὶ κοινῇ τὰ γένη, Εὐμολπίδας καὶ Κήρυκας καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ἅπαντας.48 Aleshire (1994.15) draws, I think, the correct conclusion here: “At the end of each year the priests and priestesses of those cults whose financial affairs were under the control of the demos were required to submit their accounts to the boule and demos for εὔθυνα.” The priest of Kalliste, for whom such λόγοι are attested, was following the nomoi (IG II2 788.13–15 of 243/2). It may be relevant that this priesthood was annual.49 For a list of gennetai priests and priestesses serving the cults of Athena Polias, Poseidon Erechtheus, and Demeter of Eleusis, see Blok and Lambert, 2009.105–20.50 The epigraphical evidence suggests that such euthynai from priests were not common. One is expected from a priest of Asclepius (IG II3 359.21–2), but the several texts honor-ing other priests of Asclepius make no mention of it. IG II3 416 involves a unique situa-tion, with priests of four gods in Piraeus and with ten hieropoioi honored, all of whom, apparently, were to render euthynai. This looks to be an ad hoc commission of priests and hieropoioi involved in a survey (?) and sacrifices of major polis cults in Piraeus, center-ing on that of Dionysus but including others. For possible circumstances, see Lambert, 2012.92–5. Naiden (2013.210–11) offers to support his claim that “Athenian priests were subject to euthunai” only, in addition to Aeschin. 3.18, SEG 33.147.12 where there is no explicit mention of a priest and which is, in any case, a deme calendar.

Deme priests probably rendered their"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":" 201Authority Of The PolisThat priests and priestesses of polis cults were subject to audits leads some to assume much broader polis control over them. Harris (2012.289), for example, claims “all the priests and priestesses of public cults were accountable for their conduct to the political authorities,” but he does not define what he means by “conduct.”51 Surely for their handling of polis funds, but, beyond that, what? The priest of Asclepius often and a few other priests and priestesses rarely reported to the Boule and Demos that the omens were good in sacrifices they made on behalf of the Boule and Demos,52 but that is hardly “regulation” or “control” of their conduct. And there is no evidence that the polis “controlled” or tried to “control” the rituals in which priests and priestesses engaged.53 Polis oversight of the polis priests was, as it was in so many religious matters, largely limited to financial affairs.54In one notable instance, and perhaps two, the Demos in 415 clearly ordered all the priests and priestesses (of Eleusis) to curse Alcibiades and possibly Andocides for their profanation of the Eleusinian Mysteries.55 The Demos later, in 408, ordered the Eumolpidae and Kerykes to revoke this curse, but the hierophant refused, saying he had not prayed for any evil for Alcibiades if Alcibiades were commiting no injustice.56Finally, it should be noted that whether the priests of a given cult were selected by the genos in charge of it or by lot (the only two options), the Demos had no control in either format of selection of the specific individual to serve.In concluding this treatment of the religious authority of the Ekklesia and the Demos, we make the following general points, subject to the exceptions noted in previous pages.Except for the initial approval of importation of foreign cults, the Demos through the Ekklesia exercised its power only over polis cults. We see the polis accounts, when they did, only to fellow demesmen, as in R&O #46.6. But note Parker, 205.59 n. 35.51 Cf. Naiden (2015.467), “Officials performing sacrifices were subject to euthynai, or audit.”52 See Chapter 4.53 Parker (1996.51–2) tellingly contrasts Greek texts to near-eastern ritual texts in this regard.54 Cf. Naiden (2013.217), “the polis did not issue instructions about how to pray, and so it could not punish any violations. For this aspect of thusia, the polis trusted the priest or magistrate. Similarly, the polis did not issue instructions about how to inspect entrails or perform hepatoscopy. . . .”55 Plut. Alc. 22.4 and [Lys.] 6.51. In Alcibiades’ case, one Eleusinian priestess may have refused, because, she said, she was a priestess of prayer not of curse (Plut. Mor. 275d). On this event see, most recently, Rubel, 2014.74–98 with extensive bibliography.56 Plut. Alc. 33.3."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"202CHAPTER 11courts settling some disputes on religious matters between gene and demes,57 but we see no other day-to-day or year-to-year concern or activity at the polis level involving deme, tribe, genos, family, or foreign cults.As Aleshire noted (1994.10), the polis might control one aspect of a cult without controlling the whole cult, and this varied from cult to cult. The polis paid and often through alloted or elected officials supervised the financial costs of several elements, including those of sacrificial victims, of agones of major heortai, and of such things, but, so far as we can tell, the sacrifices and rituals remained in the control of the priests. IG II2 47 and 4962 offer a unique opportunity to see both elements at play in one situation. Euthydemus, priest of the sanctuary of Asclepius in Piraeus, in early IV BC erected stelai in the sanctuary there describing the prothymata which he personally prescribed to be made to Maleates, Apollo, Hermes, Iaso, Akeso, Panakeia, and “the hunters,” i.e., offerings “preliminary” to those to be made to Asclepius (IG II2 4962).58 The Demos then passed a psephisma (IG II2 47), not validating or approving of Euthydemus’ prothymata, but specifying how they “and the other sacrifice” would be paid for (“from the quarry”) and how the meat of the sacrifices should be distributed to government officials and the public. And the record of its psephisma was erected on the Acropolis, not in the sanctuary in Piraeus. The priest specifies the deities and the nature of the offerings; the Demos decides on the financing and here, perhaps because prytaneis and archons were involved, on the distribution of the meat.57 As in Lycurg. frag. 7 [Conomis] and Din. frag. 20 [Conomis]. Naiden (2013.210 and 219–22) claims that non-polis groups and associations, including religious ones, collected the fines they levied through polis courts and depended on the polis for legal help. “Recourse to the courts of the polis goes without saying.” This would be a major interaction of the polis and private religious associations. But the relevant evidence Naiden cites refers only to disputes between gene and demes. The δικασταί mentioned in IG II2 1289.3 may well be “judges” of the association’s own choosing, not those of the polis courts. The nomos of Solon (Ruschenbusch, #76a) indicates only that a thiasos, like several secular organizations, may make whatever arrangement it wishes, and it “will be valid unless it contravenes polis regulations.” This would seem the extent of the legal intervention of the polis in the internal operations of thiasotai and orgeones. One should not conclude from this nomos, with Naiden, that “the polis, in turn, would support the bylaws” (of the association).58 “Prescribed” does not accurately reflect the Greek ἐξηικάσατο of line 17, a hapax which would apparently mean something like “made images of,” presumably on the lost portion of the stele, also a very unusual concept. I suspect there may be an error here: ἐξηικάσατο for ἐξηγέσατο (as in IG II2 47.26).

Although for some new polis cults established from the mid-fifth century on priests and priestesses were selected through the procedures of the Ekklesia, the vast majority of priests and priestesses, and most of those of the most important cults, continued to be selected κατὰ τὰ πάτρια by the gene or other social/political groups.59The Demos involved itself in the prosecution of cases of ἀσέβεια and other cases of religious misbehavior, but only in those involving polis deities.The Demos was heavily involved in ordering, designing, and paying for buildings in sanctuaries of polis deities and in making major dedications as the result of vows and as thank-offerings, particularly after military victories and successful wars. It also felt at liberty, for a least a hundred years or so, to borrow in times of financial crisis money and gold and silver dedications from some polis sanctuaries, with the intent to repay all such borrowings.Through its many honorary decrees the polis was able to encourage what it deemed to be individuals’ appropriate religious behavior that benefited the polis as a whole.In sum, the Athenian Demos, to quote Aleshire (1994.14) “regulates the form and the finances of cult—the externals, if you will, but not the content, which is governed in large part by tradition and interpreted by priests. . . .” That is, in our terms, by τὰ πάτρια as interpreted and performed by the priests and priestesses.6059 Cf. Aleshire (1994.10): “The Athenian Demos was content to delegate most or all of the supervision of these cults to those directly concerned, even to the extent of allowing the Kleisthenic tribes to delegate the selection of the priests of their eponymous heroes to those who had traditionally controlled these priesthoods.” I would quibble here only with the term “delegate,” which would suggest a conscious, specific, perhaps even legislative action. Better, I think, is “did not involve itself in.” Here, again, the Demos no doubt had the right to make changes (as it did for the priestess of Athena Polias), or to take control, but in the vast majority of cases did not do so.60 Aleshire (1994.14) adds to the interpreters exegetai and manteis, which, in contrast to priests and other cult officials, must have played a very occasional role in determining the content of cult."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"204CHAPTER 11 The BouleThe attested religious responsibilities and activities of the Boule as an institu-tion, i.e., not of individual bouleutai, have been studied well and extensively, especially by Rhodes (1972, especially 127–134 and 1993), and we can review them here summarily. The Boule, of course, prepared motions (probouleu-mata) for the psephismata passed by the Ekklesia and must therefore have had an interest in the religious elements of those psephismata.61 As one example among the many we have seen, in 221/0 when the priest of Heros Iatros wished to remake numerous silver dedications of body parts into one oenochoe, he personally proposed it to the Boule. The Boule then prepared a motion for the Ekklesia, which, when passed, became a psephisma to approve the proj-ect and designated and elected the committee to bring it to completion. Here, unusually, the new oenochoe was to be inscribed “The Boule in the archonship of Thrasyphon from the dedications to Heros Iatros (dedicated this).”62 The Boule, apparently, made the oenochoe its own dedication.63The Boule received and forwarded to the Ekklesia some reports of sacrifices and omens from prytaneis (on sacrifices to Apollo Prostaterios and associated deities), priests or priestesses of Asclepius, Aglauros, Amphiaraus, Athena Polias, Zeus Soter, Dionysus and the hieropoioi from Piraeus, an agonothetes of the City Dionysia, epimeletai of the Mysteries, and a strategos.64 The pur-pose of such sacrifices was usually for “the health and safety of the Boule and Demos of Athenians,” i.e., among other things, for the Boule’s own “health and safety,” in which it had, of course, a special interest. All of these reports derive from polis cult.For Athena Polias the Boule was involved in oversight of her dedications and treasures (Ath. Pol. 47.1)65 and, at least in part, in the approval of the design of her peplos (49.3);66 for Athena Nike in the making of the nikai (49.3), in the repair of her statue (IG II3 444), and in financial and other details of the 61 Andocides reportedly advised the Boule concerning sacrifices, revenues, prayers, and oracles ([Lysias] 6.33).62 IG II3 1154.

IG II2 840.63 Analogous is the situation described in Dem. 22.69–78, where Androtion, then epime-letes for cleaning gold crowns in the polis treasury, removed the names of the original honorands and substituted the phrase “when Androtion was epimeletes.” See above, p. 34, note 90.64 See Chapter 4.65 As it was for all the sacred treasures stored on the Acropolis.

The Boule as a group was heavily involved in the Eleusinian Mysteries, for which see Appendix 7, but as examples it met as a group in Eleusis during the celebration of the Mysteries and in the Eleusinion in the city on the day after the Mysteries.69 For the cult of Apollo Lykeios and for one of Meter the Boule selected from its own members two to serve as tamiai.70 Each of the gods and heortai listed here, we must note, is necessarily or likely of a polis cult, not that of a deme, family, or private association.There were sacrifices and prayers by the Boule to Zeus Boulaios and Athena Boulaia before their meetings, with an additional purification ceremony.71 The herald also pronounced curses on various imagined enemies of the polis.72 Either at the beginning of their term or before each meeting the bouleutai sac-rificed eisiteteria, with one member serving as hieropoios.73 And they appar-ently regularly performed sacrifices and prayers when they, as a group, visited sanctuaries, perhaps at Eleusis and at the theater of Dionysus (Antiph. 6.45). Once an aresteria was sacrificed to Demeter and Kore at Eleusis, ordered by a psephisma of the Boule in 329/8 (I. Eleusis 177.431–2). I. Eleusis 142 of 353/2 reveals that the Boule to some extent supervised the performance of the annual ἀπαρχαί of grain to Eleusis and also supervised the sacrifices made there on behalf of the Demos.7467 For the possible procedure, see Rhodes, 1972.131 and Pickard-Cambridge, 1988.95–8.68 On this see Pickard-Cambridge, 1988.69–70.69 At Eleusis, IG II2 1072.3; in Eleusinion, Andoc. 1.111.70 IG I3 138 of before, apparently, 434.71 Parker, 1983.21–2.72 Rhodes, 1972.36–7.73 When the 400 seized power from the Boule in 411, they, “entering office, made sacrifices and prayers” (Thuc. 8.70), clearly just as the bouleutai did when they began their terms.74 For other sacrifices by bouleutai, see Chapter 3. At a different level the bouleutai from the deme Teithras supervised the sacrifices and other things which their fellow demesmen ordered (Agora 15.45)."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"206CHAPTER 11For a time, mostly from mid- to end IV, with a very few earlier or later, the Boule or individual members occasionally erected dedications—really, of course, self-approbations—, after being crowned by the Demos for their excel-lent service. The recipients included the Twelve Gods, Hephaestus and Athena Hephaistia, Aphrodite Hegemone and the Charites, and Demokratia,75 again all polis deities. Such also may have been the origin of the gold crowns which the Boule dedicated, probably to Athena, in 377/6, 376/5, 375/4, and 354/3.76 The Boule also, like the Ekklesia, dedicated crowns given to it by foreign states (IG II2 1443). Interesting are the ten cups, inscribed “of the eponymous (heroes)” dedicated by the Boule in 328/7 and another set of cups dedicated by the Boule later, all, apparently, the property of an anonymous hero.77 The Boule also dedicated at Eleusis a silver phiale in 336/5, 334/3, and 333/2 (IG II2 1544.47–50). Isolated but interesting are the dedications of an iron knife with an ivory scabbard in 407/6 and of a silver basket, to Athena, in 318/7.78 Unusual is the dedication the Boule made for Amphiaraus in 328/7.79 It was paid for not by the polis but privately by subscription by twenty-one mem-bers of the Boule, their tamias, and grammateis, and ten others.80 The large majority of the attested dedications by the Boule are from IV BC, but this may result in part from the lack of temple inventories recording such dedications after that.The Boule was heavily involved in the prosecution of the Hermocopidae and of those who profaned the Eleusinian Mysteries in 415. In both cases it appears that the Ekklesia commissioned the Boule to investigate the charges and that, eventually, the Boule forwarded its findings to the dikasteria for trial and punishment of the perpetrators.81 We should not, though, conclude from this that the Boule regularly or normally involved itself in affairs of 75 IG II3 360 and II2 2790–2, 2797–8. Cf. 2801 and Agora 18.242.76 IG II2 1428.151–2; 1437.24–7; 1494.16–19 and 26–8. The link with being crowned by the Demos may be explicit in IG II2 1496. Col. 1.18–20.

One such tamias “dispensed funds to the hieropoioi for victims for sacrifices and ‘himself joined (the hieropoioi) in supervi-sion,’ sacrificing all the sacrifices” (Agora 15.85.12–15 of mid-III BC). In the reorganization of the Apollo cult in 129/8 the tamias of the Boule reported on existing oracles and pse-phismata concerning the cult and then, with the tamiai of the grain fund, was to sacrifice to Apollo (SEG 21.469C.15–17 and 58–9).81 On the role of the Boule here and on the procedures, see Rhodes, 1972.186–8."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":" 207Authority Of The Polisasebeia. Those fell to the basileus (Ath.

Importantly, though, all of its attested responsibilities and activities concerned only polis cults. PrytaniesFrom the available evidence it would seem that the prytaneis had a greater involvement in day-to-day Athenian religion than any other legislative or administrative officials. For the one-tenth (or one-eleventh, or one-twelfth) of the year they were in full-time service, they, or better, their tamias, made the sacrifices to Apollo Prostaterios and related gods that preceded the four meet-ings of the Ekklesia during their term. They then reported to the Boule the results of these sacrifices “on behalf of the health and safety of the Boule and Demos of Athenians. . . .”82The pyrtaneis also sacrificed to several major deities of the polis whose annual heortai or sacrifices occurred during their prytany, to Athena Archegetis at the Chalkeia, to Demeter and Kore at the Stenia, to the Mother of the Gods at the Galaxia, to Zeus at the Kronia, to Theseus, probably at the Theseia, and to Apollo Patroös, Zeus Ktesios, and Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira.83 They received five portions (one-tenth of a portion for each prytanis) from the sacrifices to Athena in the annual Panathenaia and, at a heorte of Asclepius, a portion of the meat of the leading bull.84 But even these sacrifices cover by no means the range of polis sacrifices. Of the nine festivals and six sacrifices recorded on the dermaticon accounts of IG II2 1496 from 334/3–331/0, the prytaneis are attested to have sacrificed only at the Theseia and to Zeus Soter. They seem not to have sacrificed at some of the largest festivals like the City Dionysia where the polis was represented by other officials. There seems to be no common denominator in the cults at which they sacrificed except that they were all cults of major deities with polis-wide concerns and the cults 82 See Chapters 3 and 4.83 See Chapter 3.84 IG II3 447.35–6 of 335–330 and II2 47.35–8 of mid-IV BC."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"208CHAPTER 11were centered “in the city,” not in Piraeus or in the countryside. However all that may be, the prytaneis represented the Boule, the Boule represented the Ekklesia, and the Ekklesia represented the Demos, the people, and through the prytaneis the Demos as a unit was represented at specifically these sacri-fices. In each case we might imagine the prytaneis’ sacrifice as an “accessory sacrifice,” accessory to the major sacrifice made, no doubt, by the appropri-ate priests and priestesses. Only here, at the prytany level, do we find such a clearly systematic attempt by the government to participate in sacrifices to a number of deities. And here, nicely, we have evidence from Antiphon and Theophrastus for the pride some individual prytaneis took in their role in such activities, as described in Chapter 3.85A long series of dedications honoring the members of the prytany which had been judged best to have served the interests of the polis that year ranges from 408/7 to 307/6.86 They were awarded by the Boule and/or the Ekklesia, but the monument may have been paid for by the prytaneis themselves. Most were found in the Agora, but at least one may have been erected in the sanc-tuary of that tribe’s eponymous hero.87 They are dedications, but their pri-mary purpose is to honor humans for their accomplishments and they make only secondary, if any, reference to the deity.88 In this they are similar to archaic and classical “dedications” honoring victors in the various international competitions.89 The later, long series of decrees honoring prytaneis for their efforts, beginning in 305/4, was erected near the Bouleuterion or Tholos, that is, not in a sanctuary. Here the slender tie with deities in the IV BC pyrtany “dedications” is completely broken. Of a quite different nature are the four dedications made by prytanies of individual tribes in 370/69, 363/2, 362/1, 361/0, each consisting of a serving tray for food (μαζονομεῖον), reasonably associated by Lewis with “eating and dining arrangements of the boule and its prytaneis.”9085 Antiph. 6.45 and Theophr.

By late IV BC they included the following:1. the episkeuastai, ten men chosen by lot each year to “repair” those sanctuaries especially in need of repair (Ath. Pol. 50.1)2. the boönai, officials who purchased the sacrificial victims for cer-tain heortai (IG II3 447.42–4)3. the four epimeletai of the Mysteries, elected, two from all Athenians, one each from Eumolpidae and Kerykes (Ath.

Often recorded were the transfer of these from one board of tamiai to the next, as, e.g., in the Ath. Pol.’s (47.1) description of the tamiai of Athena: “They receive, in the presence of the Boule, the statue (ἄγαλμα) of Athena, the Nikai, and the rest of the kosmos and the money.” On these boards see Harris, 1995.92 On whom see Lambert, 2002a.81–2 and Parker, 1996.298–9. Din., frag. A.4 [Burtt] indicates that they were ten in number.93 For the hieropoioi of IG II2 1749 being tribal, not polis, see Clinton, 1980.282. I think it most probable that the hieropoioi of Dionysus (and other gods?) in Piraeus of IG II3 416 were an ad hoc, temporary commission."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"210CHAPTER 11So we have each year, at least, one board each of episkeuastai and boönai, five boards of epimeletai, and five boards of hieropoioi,94 most consisting of ten members, nearly 130 citizens in all. EpiskeuastaiThey were ten men, selected by lot each year, who “repaired” those sanctuaries especially in need of it. For this they received, in late IV BC, 3000 drachmas in polis funds (Ath. Pol. 50.1). BoönaiThe boönai were responsible for purchasing with polis funds the sacrificial victims for certain major heortai, probably including the Panathenaia and the Dionysia in Piraeus.95 HieropoioiThe duties of the hieropoioi no doubt differed from cult to cult and from one period to another. IG I3 82 of 421/0, though fragmentary, gives an exten-sive account of the hieropoioi for the new or remodeled quadrennial Hephaisteia. There are two boards, each of ten, one selected by lot from the dikastai, one man from each tribe, and one selected by lot from the bouleu-tai, one man again from each tribe. They are to be paid the bouleutic wage for their time of service. They are to distribute to the metics the meat, are to “oversee” the pompe, and are to fine (up to 50 drachmas) any who misbehave during the heorte and to bring to court any who deserve a greater penalty. They are to lead the cows to the altar and are to select from the citizens 200 to “lift” the victims. They are “to make” the torch race and the rest of the agon. They are to be present when the victors are announced and are to “oversee” the inscrib-ing of the prizes. Similarly, ca. 335–300, in the reorganization of the annual Panathenaia (IG II3 447) the hieropoioi are to receive the polis money for the heorte; to see to the pompe; to make two sacrifices, one to Athena Hygieia, and the other to, probably, Athena Polias; and to distribute the meat to various offi-cials, the kanephoroi, those in the pompe, and “to the Athenians.” They are to select and purchase the victims and then sacrifice to Athena on her Great Altar and to Athena Nike and to distribute the meat to “the Demos of the Athenians” 94 Hansen (1982.163–4) points out that in IG II2 1496 are listed also sets of hieropoioi for a sacrifice to Agathe Tyche (76–7, 107–8), for the Asclepieia (78–9, 109–10), for the Bendideia (86–7), and for the Theseia (134–5). He notes, correctly, that some of these may be the hieropoioi “for the year,” but some may be independent boards.95 IG II3 447.42–4 and IG II2 1496.70–4, 80–1, 88–9, 118–19, and 133."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":" 211Authority Of The Polisin the Cerameicus. They are also to make the pannychis and to fine “the one who does not obey the one in authority” (τὸν μὴ πειθαπχο[ῦντα].96 In the years 334/3–331/0 the hieropoioi “for the year” also received revenues from the sale of skins of the victims at the Panathenaia, as well as at the Asclepieia, Bendideia, Eleusinia, Theseia, and the sacrifice to Agathe Tyche (IG II2 1496). In this same text the syllogeis “of the Demos” received funds from the Olympieia. In the fourth century these syllogeis were apparently a board of thirty, with three bouleutai from each tribe, and in their dedication to the Mother of the Gods in 324/3, one was honored for serving as a hieropoios for Athena and one for Zeus Olympios.97 Finally, in the Lycurgan period ten hieropoioi, including Lycurgus himself, “led” the Pythaïs to Delphi, but in 128/7 this task was performed by the nine archons.98The hieropoioi are clearly, at least in IV BC, major figures in the admin-istration of various aspects of the large polis heortai. For at least some such heortai they receive and dispense significant funds, select, purchase, and sometimes participate in the sacrifice of the victims, “put on” the pompe and agones, receive funds accrued from the sale of the skins of victims, and exam-ine cases of misconduct during the heorte. They, in short, were responsible for much of what would, from the human point of view, make a heorte successful.99 They apparently did not introduce new or make changes to old heortai (the role of the Demos) or have any control over the rituals (probably the role of the priests). As Rhodes (1972.130) concludes, “In general their duties seem to have covered those aspects of festival administration which were not the respon-sibility of the priests themselves.” Our best evidence is from V and IV BC, and the establishment of the new role of the agonothetes at the end of IV BC may have restricted the future role of the hieropoioi in administering the agones of major heortai.100 Given that they functioned as a board and had one-year 96 These hieropoioi are either the “hieropoioi for the year” (Lambert, 2012a.84) or, less likely, a separate group of “hieropoioi for the Panathenaia” (Shear. 2001.104–5 and 451–5).97 IG II2 1496.82–3 and 113–14 and Schwenk #77. On the syllogeis, see Rhodes, 1972.21 and 129–30.98 FD 3.1.511 and 3.2.3.99 One would hesitate to agree with Parker (2005.98) that they were “minor magistrates” and that “their duties are confined to the performance of rites.” Unlike Parker, I think their role should be clearly distinguished from that of priests.100 A dedication by hieropoioi to Theseus after they had received a crown in 344/3 (IG II2 2832) would indicate that hieropoioi were still involved in his cult at this time. A former hieropoios dedicated a herm in 350–330 (Agora 18.79). Of other dedications by hieropoioi, SEG 54.171 of 325/4 gives no indication of a religious context, and IG II2 2859 from Piraeus in mid-III BC, dedicated to Artemis, is surely from a private cult."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"212CHAPTER 11terms, the hieropoioi are further evidence of the participation and expertise expected of Athenian citizens. EpimeletaiLike the hieropoioi, the boards of epimeletai probably consisted of ten men, chosen by election or sortition to one-year terms. They seem to have some-what different roles from the hieropoioi. The hieropoioi “for the year,” for example, served several cults and heortai, whereas it appears that each board of epimeletai was concerned with one cult. There are separate boards of epimeletai for Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira and for Asclepius in Piraeus.101 Also, we have hieropoioi for quadrennial heortai—the theoria to Delos, the Brauronia, Herakleia, Eleusinia, and Hephaisteia—, but epimeletai for annual heortai—the Mysteries, City Dionysia, and Amphiaraia.102 There seems to be no overlap, with both hieropoioi and epimeletai serving one cult, with the exception, as always, of Eleusis.103 Epimeletai with the archon supervised the City Dionysia and at one time were elected and both administered and paid for the pompe, but by the late fourth century they were selected by lot and were just administering the pompe and receiving necessary funds from the polis. They also sacrificed at this heorte and were responsible for the “good order.” For the Amphiaraia the epimeletai supervised not only the pompe but also the agones and the “other things the Demos assigned them.” Epimeletai supervised the pompe and joined the sacrifice, no doubt annual, to Zeus Soter and Athena and also “spread the couch” and “adorned the table.” Epimeletai also sacrificed, annually, to Asclepius in Piraeus.104 For the City Dionysia and Amphiaraia their duties were remarkably similar to those of the hieropoioi for the quadrennial heortai. The role of the epimeletai of the Mysteries was much more extensive than that of any other board of epimeletai, for an account of which see Appendix 7. Except for them, no other epimeletai are attested to have made financial contributions to the cults they served.These boards of hieropoioi and epimeletai were selected by the Boule, but, perhaps, once selected had considerable independence, the decisions and impulses of any one member being controlled by the other nine members. 101 An exception here are the hieropoioi for the Semnai.102 An exception here may be the hieropoioi “of the year” who may also have contributed to the annual Panathenaia.103 There would be both hieropoioi and epimeletai for the cult of Amphiaraus only if we accept emendation of Ath. Pol. 54.7. See above, p. 73, note 99. If so, the epimeletai may have supervised the annual heorte, the hieropoioi a quadrennial one.104 City Dionysia, Ath.

Of particular importance here is that all hieropoioi and epimeletai allotted or elected by the Boule served only polis cults. Demes and private associations appointed their own hieropoioi and epimeletai for their cults.106 AthlothetaiThe Ath. Pol. (60.1–3) describes a board of ten, one from each tribe, chosen by lot for a four-year term to supervise the pompe and agones of the (quadren-nial) Panathenaia.107 They were also to have the peplos and prize amphorae made (in collaboration with the Boule) and were to distribute the olive oil to the winning competitors. From Hekatombaion 4 until the Panathenaia (Hekatombaion 28 or a bit earlier) they dined in the Prytaneion (62.2). This board was still performing some of these duties in mid-III BC.108 These appear to be the only board members subject to a dokimasia (Ath. Pol. 60.1). We have for these officials an unusually detailed description of one set of, probably minor, activities in IG II3 298.24–44 of 347/3. The Athenians decided to give Spartocus and Paerisiades, joint kings of the Cimmerian Bosporus, various honors, including gold crowns at the quadrennial Panathenaia. The athlothe-tai are to have the crowns made, worth 1,000 drachmas each, in the year before the Panathenaia and are to proclaim, surely at the quadrennial Panathenaia, 105 The hieropoioi and priests of Dionysus and other gods of Piraeus in 340–330 reported τὰ ἀγαθά in their sacrifices and were expected to give euthynai (IG II3 416), but they seem to be a special commission sorting out religious conditions in Piraeus at a difficult time just before or after Chaeronea, with, perhaps, responsibilities beyond those of usual hiero-poioi. If the readings and restorations of the problematical IG II3 369.45–6 are correct, they would have the hieropoioi “for the year” rendering euthynai in 325/4. The epimeletai of the Mysteries, exceptional in so many ways, in 214/3 gave both accounts (λόγοι) and rendered euthynai of their activities (IG II3 1164.27–30).106 The hieropoioi for the sanctuary of Hebe of the deme Aixone did render euthynai (IG II2 1199.6–7 of 320/19). About the hieropoioi of the demes, Whitehead (1986.142) concludes: “Nor is any very clear pattern to be seen in what they do, save in the most general of terms, and it would probably be ill-advised to attempt to impose one.”107 For the likelihood that, before the athlothetai were introduced (i.e., some time before 446/5), hieropoioi established and managed the agones of the quadrennial Panathenaia, see Shear, 2001.451–5, 514–5, and 544.108 IG II2 784.7–11."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"214CHAPTER 11that “the Demos of Athenians crowns Spartocus and Paerisiades, the children of Leucon, because of their ἀρετή and εὔνοια toward the Demos of Athenians.” Since they are dedicating their crowns to Athena Polias, the athlothetai are to dedicate the crowns in the temple, after inscribing them “Spartocus and Paerisiades, children of Leucon, dedicated (them) when they were crowned by the Demos of Athenians.” The tamias of the Demos is to give the money for the crowns to the athlothetai.109The evidence for the hieropoioi, epimeletai, and athlothetai comes almost exclusively from the fifth and fourth centuries BC, and, though extremely sparse, shows some divisions of labor. The athlothetai are concerned with the pompe, agones, peplos, amphorae and other prizes of the quadrennial Panathenaia. The hieropoioi handle the Hephaisteia and the pompe, sacrifices, and pannychis of the annual Panathenaia, while epimeletai “supervise” the Mysteries, City Dionysia, and Amphiaraia. AgonothetaiWhat happened to these various boards when a single, elected agonothetes replaced the various choregoi and seems to have assumed other heorte repon-sibilities in late IV BC, during the reign of Demetrius of Phaleron?110 The hiero-poioi “of the year” seem to disappear. Athlothetai reappear once, in 239/8, doing much of what the Ath. Pol. (60.1–3) assigned them for the quadrennial Panathenaia nearly a century earlier.111 The agonothetai are, alas, introduced later than the Ath. Pol., and so we lack a convenient description of their duties, but we have partial compensation for this in extensive epigraphical texts, dated in the half century after the office was established, in particular for Philippides (IG II2 657), Phaedrus (682), and Agathaeus (780). For two of these (Philippides and Phaedrus) the agonothesia was just one, and the final, element of a dis-tinguished career including military and diplomatic service. Agathaeus was praised for his agonothesia alone. Phaedrus, agonothetes of 282/1, “supervised” the sacrifices and agones, but nothing is said of making sacrifices or of using his own funds. Philippides, agonothetes of 284/3, “sacrificed” the πάτριοι θυσίαι on behalf of the Demos and prepared a new agon for Demeter and Kore in remem-brance of the freedom of the Demos. He “gave all the agones to the Athenians,” “supervised” the other agones and sacrifices, and for all of these things spent 109 Spartocus’ crown is then recorded in two inventories of treasures stored in the Hecatompedon: IG II2 1485.21–4 and 1486.14–16, both of late IV BC.110 On which, see above, p. 94 and Wilson, 2000.270–6.111 IG II2 784.7–11."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":" 215Authority Of The Polisfrom his own funds. Agathaeus in 252/1 made sacrifices to Dionysus and the other gods to whom it was πάτριον to sacrifice and reported on the results of his sacrifices. He, too, sacrificed the πάτριοι θυσίαι, and also “supervised” the Dionysiac and other agones. There is no evidence that he spent his own money for any of this. He did, however, submit to euthynai of his financial accounts at the end of his term of office, and so may have all agonothetai. Noteworthy here is that apparently all agones were the responsibility of each of these men for a year, but when a heorte is named, it is only the City Dionysia.112 The agones of the Panathenaia are absent in these texts, but they were still under the supervi-sion of the athlothetai.113The question is whether, at the beginning, agonothetai were just adminis-tering the agones and sacrifices or were also expected to pay for them, as in the previous centuries choregoi had for Dionysiac agones.114 The cost to an indi-vidual would have been enormous, as we have seen,115 and only Philippides is explicitly praised for using his own funds. He alone is explicitly said to have “given” the agones to the Athenians.116 Even then he may have supple-mented rather than replaced polis funds, and he may be the exception in this period. As late as ca. 215 we apparently still have one individual, the promi-nent politician Euryclides, serving as agonothetes. The exact amount he spent, a whopping 63,000 drachmas, is announced.117 By mid-II BC the situation has apparently changed. We now have separate agonothetai for the Theseia and Panathenaia, and, if we use early I BC evidence, one agonothetes (Medeios) for the Panathenaia and Delia118 and another in other years (Sarapion) for the Panathenaia, Delia, Eleusinia, and Diasia.119 In this highly plutocratic period of the Athenian “democracy,” all of these agonothetai are reported to have contributed their own funds. Miltiades, as agonothetes of the Panathenaia 112 It is noteworthy that both the honors for Agathaeus as agonothetes were decreed imme-diately after the City Dionysia (IG II2 780).113 Agathaeus, probably as agonothetes, contributed some effort to the Panathenaia and its games administered by the athlothetai ca. 239/8 (IG II2 784.8).114 On this question see Wilson, 2000.273 and 275.115 Above, pp. 94–5.116 IG II2 657.42, ἔδωκεν, which is unparalleled in the context of an agonothetes’ activity.

The costs were still borne by the polis, but an agonothetes, like Philippides, could contribute if he so wished. By mid-II BC the single agonothesia was divided up by heortai, with individuals responsible for and, perhaps, now paying significant amounts of the costs of their heortai, and part of honoring these agonothetai was declaring the exact amounts they spent. The conclusion would be that not all the early agonothetai contributed their own funds in the performance of their duties and that most probably did not pay the full costs of the agones under their supervision.122 Euryclides and Miltiades, in this as in many other aspects of their careers, were probably the exceptions. Administrative Officials The Nine ArchonsThe nine archons, apparently together, sacrificed on behalf of their successors (Lysias 26.8). In the new plans for the sacrifices to Athena made in 335–300, the nine archons together were to receive portions.123 In mid-IV BC they received portions of the meat of the main sacrificial animal in a heorte of Asclepius.124 And in 128/7 the nine archons “led” the Pythaïs to Delphi, a role held in IV BC by hieropoioi.125 The (Eponymous) Archon126The archon supervised the pompai of City Dionysia, Thargelia, Asclepieia, and for Zeus Soter.

For the Panathenaia he collected the olive oil for the prize amphorae (Ath. Pol. 60.2–3).127 At the time of the Ath.

Now the agonothetai would handle the agones. Both Euthius and Nicias sac-rificed to Dionysus, surely at the City Dionysia, Nicias “on behalf of the health and safety of the Boule, Demos of Athenians, and crops in the land,” and on the good outcome of these he reported to the Boule. Nicias also made the “other sacrifices which were appropriate for him to sacrifice.” What these “other sac-rifices” were is not clear.129 An archon at least once attended, along with the strategos and the epimeletai, the ephebes’ sacrifice to Ajax on Salamis.130 In the reorganization of Apollo’s heortai in 129/8, he was ordered to sacrifice, along with the basileus and the strategoi, to Apollo.131 The archon of 394/3 and his paredros and grammateus dedicated a herm.132 As a more personal dedication, Plistaenus, an archon who had served in mid-II BC, his wife, and his daughter made a dedication to Dionysus, perhaps appropriate given the archon’s role in the City Dionysia.133 The (Archon) BasileusOf all Athenian governmental officials the basileus had the deepest roots in Athenian religion and is most linked to τὰ πάτρια and to the nomoi of Solon.134 He administered (διοικεῖ) “so to speak, all the πάτριοι θυσίαι,” and the one basileus who we know sacrificed, Philippides, in 293/2 is honored for having 127 On the procedure for this, and on the possibility that the task passed to other officials later, see Shear, 2001.405–9 and 465–6.128 Agora 16.181.10–13 and IG II2 668.13–15.

He and his wife were central figures in the little-known ritual of, apparently, a sacred marriage and secret sacrifices at the Anthesteria, all κατὰ τὰ πάτρια, and for this role his wife had to have been a virgin when she married him.136 He was also involved in the finance of the sanctuaries, recording the price, renters, and their guarantors of sacred lands and, perhaps, prosecuting defaulters.137 It was he who was to mark out the boundaries of the sanctuaries in the Pelargikon and was perhaps responsible for settling all such disputes.138 He did settle disputes involving gene and priesthoods.139 Most importantly, he was the archon with whom charges of ἀσε�́βεια were lodged.140 In addition to all of this, he admin-istered the pompe and agon of the Lenaia and the performance of all agones consisting of torch-races.141 And, after the reorganization of the Apollo cult in 129/8 he joined other administrators in sacrifices to Apollo.142 Perhaps most indicative of his general supervision of sacrifices is that the inscriptions recording the late V BC revision and republishing of the State Calendar of sac-rifices were erected in his office, the Stoa Basileios in the Agora.The basileus had a major role in the Eleusinian Mysteries, supervising κατὰ τὰ πάτρια the whole together with the epimeletai and the Eumolpidae and Kerykes, reporting on the performance to the prytaneis, sacrificing and praying at both Eleusis and the Eleusinion in Athens, and bringing to justice those that misbehaved during the Mysteries.143 And, finally, in ca. 175–135 the past basi-leus Euxenus and his paredroi made a dedication commemorating the crowns they were awarded by the Boule and Demos.144It is remarkable, but characteristic of Athenian religion, that a citizen selected by lot for a one-year term could have such major and complex religious responsibilities, most of which required a thorough knowledge of religious traditions and contemporary practices.135 Ath.

Mor. 862c),146 and the tomb offerings suit this official’s title. It is noteworthy that the cult of Harmodius and Aristogiton, the tyrant slayers, is by association with the polemarch put in the context of war, and they are, to judge by the record, the only heroes to whom Athenian governmental officials sacrificed. There is no other evidence for the polemarch’s religious activities.147 The ThesmothetaiThe thesmothetai were expected, like some members of the Boule, to go on the Pythaïs to Delphi in IV BC (Dem. 29.128). Other than that, they are first attested to have performed religious services in the reorganization of the Apollo cult in 129/8, ordered to join the priest of Apollo, the basileus, and the herald of the Areopagus Council in a sacrifice.148In terms of governmental involvement in the sacrificial activity of Athens, most striking is the general lack of participation by administrative officials. Apart from a very few areas of traditional responsibility, of the basileus in the Eleusinian cult, of the polemarch in sacrifices to Artemis Agrotera and Enyalios, both known from the classical period, there are at the most only a handful of attested sacrifices down to the Roman period, and most of these are recorded only in the idiosyncratic SEG 21.469C of 129/8.145 On the religious activities of the polemarch, see Rhodes, 1993.650–2 and above, p. 219.146 On which see above, p. 125.147 A polemarch made a dedication, probably a statue of himself, ca. 150 (Agora 18.40).

The four surviving dedications by thesmothetai (IG2 2836, 2837, 2843, and 2855), three from IV BC and one from III BC, give no indication that their crowns were awarded for religious services or to which deities, if any, the dedications were made."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"220CHAPTER 11 Military Officials The StrategoiOne must distinguish between strategoi of the usual, traditional sort and those that commanded garrisons of Athenian soldiers on Athenian territory, com-mon in III BC. And here we treat the religious activities of the usual strategoi in, more or less, their governmental and civic capacity, not on military expedi-tions. Xenophon’s Anabasis suggests that these activities on expeditions would have been extensive, almost daily: sacrifices and taking omens before battles.149 Evidence of their religious activities at home is rare and scattered. They as a group made libations to Dionysus at the City Dionysia, made some sacrifices with the taxiarchs, and one sacrificed at least once with the ephebes at the Aianteia.150 From the sacrifices to Athena at the annual Panathenaia the strat-egoi and taxiarchs together received portions (IG II3 447.39–40). They were included in the new sacrifices to Apollo in the reorganization of his cult in 129/8.151 In 446/5 they were ordered, by a psephisma, to supervise and provide the funds for sacrifices to be made “from the oracles concerning Euboia” by three members of the Boule. The strategoi were probably involved because the sacrifices were to be made on Euboea and quickly, and the funds they provided were undoubtedly polis funds and not their own (IG I3 40.64–9). In the 330’s they administered funds collected from the sale of skins of sacrificial victims of various polis heortai and sacrifices.152 In III and II BC the strategos ἐπὶ τὴν παρασκευήν was made a member of a committee managing the inventorying and repair of dedications for the sanctuary of the Heros Iatros and for that of Aphrodite.153 Strategoi also probably played a role in marshalling the armed forces in pompai (Dem. 4.26).154 These are all relatively minor roles.By contrast the strategoi of garrisons in Athens were heavily and promi-nently involved in the religious activities of their troops and of the regions in which they were quartered. Various strategoi at Rhamnous, for example, 149 For which see Pritchett, 1971.109–15.150 Dionysia, Plut. Cim. 8.7; taxiarchs, Agora 16.185.7–11 and 187.9–13; Aianteia, IG II2 1008.76–7.151 SEG 21.469C.24–7. An emendation of line 26 would have the strategoi alone also “putting on” the sacrifices and pompai of the Thargelia. That is unlikely. The subject of the clause has been omitted by the scribe, but should probably be the archon, with or without other officials.152 IG II2 1496. Parker (1996.221), mistakenly I believe, describes the strategoi as “in charge of ” these sacrifices. Later (p. 249 n. 108) he more correctly states that “what level of involve-ment that implies is uncertain.” See above, pp. 66–7.153 IG II2 840, II3 1154, and SEG 34.95.154 Shear, 2001.128–9."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":" 221Authority Of The Poliscontributed victims for the sacrifices of the Nemesia, sacrifices which had lapsed.

Another, interestingly, made a dedication to Dionysus Lenaios.159 In late II BC in Piraeus one strategos made a dedication to Aphrodite Euploia, another to Hermes Hegemonios.160 These are all clearly dedications to deities in the locales in which the strategoi served.

The taxiarchs also marshalled the infan-try of their tribes in pompai (Dem. 4.26 and Lysias 13.82).166 The HipparchsFor the hipparchs, the two elected commanders of the cavalry, we have the usual scraps of information about their sacrifices: eisiteteria made to Poseidon (Hippios?) and other deities ca. 184/3, and fellow cavalrymen praising their hipparch in 187/6 for having sacrificed with them.167 But in addition we have Xenophon’s essay Hipparchos, precious in that it includes both private and public religious activities.168 Xenophon lists as one duty of the hipparch “that he will ‘seek good omens in sacrifices’ (καλλιερήσει) to the gods on behalf of the cavalry” (Hipp. 3.1), and such a sacrifice might well be the eisiteteria. He also claims that the hipparch “must excel in serving the gods and in being skilled in war” (7.1),169 and, perhaps as an example of that, Xenophon proposes as the hipparch’s first duty on assuming office “to sacrifice and ask the gods to grant that he think, say, and do those things from which he would hold office in a way most pleasing to the gods and most dear, glorious, and beneficial to him-self, his friends, and the city” (Hipp. 1.1). Xenophon stresses the cavalry’s role in pompai and gives details of such displays in the Agora. The hipparch’s role is to make them “worth seeing” (ἀξιοθεάτους), beautiful, and pleasing to gods and 162 Agora 16.185.7–11 and 187.9–13.163 Agora 16.182.164 IG II3 447.39–40.165 Agora 16.123.11–15.166 Shear, 2001.128–9.167 Agora 16.270 and IG II3 1281.23–4.168 I use the title Hipparchos, abbreviated as Hipp., as more precise than the usual De Equitum Magistro.169 On the nature and broad implications of “service of the gods” (θεραπεία τῶν θεῶν), see Mikalson, 2010.29–42."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":" 223Authority Of The Polismen (2.1, 3.1–5. Cf. Dem. 4.26).170 Demosthenes snarkily notes that Meidias, when serving as hipparch, could not even ride a horse through the Agora in the pompai, but when he did “lead” the pompai, he had to borrow another’s horse (21.171 and 174).171There are also many Xenophantic invocations of the gods in the Hipparchus: to do something “with the god(s)” (1.1, 5.14, 7.14, 9.8), “with the gods as allies” (7.4), or to ask from them an ability to deceive the enemy (5.11). In opening the Hipparchus Xenophon recommended the prayer given above, following the usual principle of the priority of the divine.172 In closing he similarly invokes the gods:If someone is surprised that many times it has been written ‘to act with a god,’ let him know well that if he is many times in danger, he will be less surprised at this. And, when war occurs, the opponents plot against one another, but seldom do they know how their plots are faring. Therefore in such matters one can find no one else with whom to consult except the gods. They know all things and indicate them to whomever they wish, in bird omens, omens, and dreams. And it is reasonable that the gods advise these who ask what they must do not only when they are in need but also in times of good fortune provide the gods whatever service they can (9.8–9).Whether hipparchs in general shared Xenophon’s outlook is impossible to determine, but Xenophon was a military man who knew what and for whom he was writing, and I suspect many hipparchs, phylarchs, strategoi, and taxiarchs shared these sentiments that Xenophon is urging on them. But the Hipparchus should serve as a salutary reminder of how little we really know about the reli-gious actions and especially beliefs of all these (and other) officials solely from the epigraphical record.Dedications by and honors of hipparchs and their subordinates, the phy-larchs, show a strong affinity for the cult of Hermes, either expressly made to Hermes or to be erected in the Stoa of the Herms in the Agora.173 This nicely 170 The cavalry displays Xenophon (Hipp. 3.1) lists, in the Academy, in the Lyceum, at Phaleron, and in the hippodrome, are apparently not parts of heortai.171 Xenophon would not have been happy, either.

The dedication by a"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"224CHAPTER 11accords with Xenophon’s encouragement to hipparchs to begin their displays in pompai at the Herms in the Agora (3.2). After IV BC such dedications by hipparchs and phylarchs were apparently replaced by honorary decrees, some-times set up near the Stoa of the Herms.174 The PhylarchsThere are recorded sacrifices by only one phylarch, Theophilus, a commander of his tribal unit of the cavalry. He was honored by his fellow tribesmen of Antiochis in late III or early II BC because, among other things, he sacrificed all the sacrifices to the gods (SEG 46.148). Phylarchs also probably played a role in marshalling the cavalrymen of their tribes in pompai (Dem. 4.26). Honors of phylarchs, as we have just seen, are usually associated with Hermes, but when the Antiochis tribe honored their phylarch, they erected the stele in the sanctuary of Antiochos, their eponymous hero.175If we leave aside the exceptional situations of the garrison strategoi and of the involvement of numerous officials in the reorganization of the cult of Apollo in 129/8, there are only scattered and rare attestations of sacrifices by military officers.176 Their major contribution to the polis religious program seems to have been marshalling the troops under their command in pom-pai which required the presence of troops, as, e.g., that of the Panathenaia. But the individual pompai, as we have seen, were under the supervision of non-military officials. The variety of religious activities, including sacrifice, establishing sanctuaries, and donations by the strategoi of the garrisons, is exceptional, determined by the unusual conditions of their role and location. The Ephebes177No later than 127/6 a new class of ephebes marked their enrollment (ἐγγραφαί) with eisiteteria, sacrifices to Demos and the Charites in the Prytaneion, and hipparch to Demeter and Kore near Eleusis (I. Eleusis 39) may have been the result of his success in a battle there (Clinton, 2005–2008.II.62).174 SEG 21.525 and 46.167 record honors given to the same hipparchs and phylarchs in 282/1, the first by fellow cavalrymen, the second by a group of mercenaries. Both stelai are to be erected in the Stoa of the Herms, and a copy of the first, by the Athenian cavalrymen, also in the Poseidonion, probably the sanctuary of Poseidon Hippios. Cf. SEG 21.357.9.175 SEG 3.115.22–3. Possible also in SEG 46.148.16.176 Again, of course, excluding sacrifices on the battlefield.177 On the many religious activities of the ephebes in the Hellenistic period and the deities and heortai involved, and for the relevant texts, see Deshours, 2011.155–77 and"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":" 225Authority Of The Polisthey were joined in these by the priest of Demos and the Charites, the exegetai, and their kosmetes.

The ephebes also traveled to Salamis, every year it seems, to sacrifice at the Aianteia, and, most years, to Zeus Tropaios. Other ephebic sacrifices appear occasionally, recorded for only one or two years. They were to Amphiaraus at Oropus, Artemis Mounychia, Asclepius and Hermes on Salamis, Athena Nike, Athena Polias, Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira, Megaloi Theoi, Mother of the Gods at the Galaxia, Semnai, “the gods holding Attica,” and at the Chalkeia, Eleusinia, and the Mysteries.179 And in 122/1 the ephebes sent and sacrificed a bull for the Dionysia.180 The ephebes also provided “services” (λειτουργίαι) at various annual events. One such service was the “liftings of the cows” required at sacrifices, surely at the Mysteries and the Proerosia and at some other, unspecified sacrifices.181 The ephebes performed another such service by participating in pompai, for Athena Nike, for the Eleusinian Mysteries, and quite likely for the Semnai.182 In SEG 22.110. 53–4 it is said of the ephebes of 79/8 that they joined in all the pompai for the polis. In 176/5 the ephebes are attested to have garlanded the tomb at Marathon and to have held a “tomb-contest” there.183 The ephebes also regularly participated in races which were agones of some heortai.184In terms of authority, their kosmetes supervised the sacrifices and other reli-gious activities of the ephebes and is regularly honored in the ephebic decrees for having done so. Twice, in 127/6 and 106/5, the kosmetes of the ephebes made a report of sacrifices he made with the ephebes.185 He may, in fact, have made the various sacrifices as the ephebes observed. For a brief period at the end of the second century kosmetai contributed for sacrifices involving Perrin-Saminadayar, 2007.

Many of these ephebic religious activities were governed by nomoi and psephismata. In 213/2 the ephebes are praised for sacrificing to the gods, “following ([ἀκολούθως]) the nomoi and the psephismata.189 These sacrifices included the eisiteteria and those at the ἐγγραφαί.190 In 127/6 all their races in the various agones, their torch-races, and pompai may have been dictated by nomoi and psephismata. In the same text their display in weapons at the Theseia and elsewhere was also dictated by nomoi and psephismata.191 Their regular dedication of a phiale to the Mother of the Gods was controlled by a psephisma.192 The ephebeia in the form we have it in II BC was a relatively recent foundation, and it is not surprising that τὰ πάτρια are so rarely invoked in their activities. The ephebes of 204/3 made the pompai of the Semnai and of Iakchos “following τὰ πάτρια,”193 and in 106/5 they and their kosmetes sacrificed to Dionysus and to the other gods to whom it was πάτριον.194 Certainly the latter and perhaps the former refer more to the cult’s πάτρια than to any πάτρια of the ephebes’ own activities. The real author-ity for the ephebes’ religious program is the nomoi and psephismata, i.e., the Ekklesia.The rich sacrificial program of the ephebes compares to that only of the prytaneis, but it is likely that their purposes were quite different. The prytaneis clearly provided polis representation at the heortai at which they sacrificed. We should perhaps view the sacrifices by the ephebes rather as part of the educational program of the ephebes.

The conclu-sion, which must be drawn ex silentio, is that priests and priestesses must throughout this period, and probably earlier in the classical period, have been performing the overwhelming majority of the sacrifices, with little or no polis involvement or interference. By Comparison to What?The role of Athenian legislative and administrative structures in religious mat-ters appears to be slight, but in comparison to what? We offer three cases for comparison, one legislative, one of an administrative official, and one of a mili-tary official, each of which varies from the usual Athenian practice: the role of the polis in the cult of Demeter at Eleusis, the role of the demarchs in their demes, and the role of the strategoi of garrisons. Cult of Demeter at Eleusis and the Eleusinian MysteriesThe collection of evidence in Appendix 7 reveals what has been obvious in bits and pieces throughout this study, that the polis, the Demos of Athenians, was heavily involved with the cult of Demeter and the Mysteries at Eleusis at all levels. The rituals were no doubt under the control of the Eumolpidae and Kerykes and the priestesses they selected. But most other aspects, from general management and final scrutiny of the Mysteries, the meeting of the Boule in Eleusis, to the announcement, amount, and collection of the aparche, to the election of hieropoioi and epimeletai, to building in the sanctuary, to punish-ment for religious violations, and to financial accounts down to the obol were under the control, in one way or another, of numerous nomoi and psephismata, the Boule, prytaneis, and especially the basileus from the earliest (Solonian) to the latest times of our study. Polis involvement and control in this cult are exceptional in both extent and degree, but they give us an idea of what tight polis control of other cults would have looked like—and what the evidence would look like—if in fact it existed. There is nothing comparable, even for the major polis heortai of the City Dionysia and the Panathenaia."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"228CHAPTER 11 DemarchsThe inscriptions from the demes are a small fraction of those from the polis and from a much more restricted time period ending in early II BC,195 but we have far more sacrifices performed by the demarchs than by any polis admin-istrative official in the whole epigraphical and literary record. The demarch of the deme Marathon, for example, made seven each year, that of Eleusis made at least five. The demarch of Erchia made at least one and perhaps many more.196 The demarchs of Skambonidai, Eleusis, Hagnous, Ikarion, and Rhamnous all sacrificed, some several times a year. The demarch of Rhamnous, with his tamias, was ordered to supervise the new, annual sacrifice to Antigonus Gonatas. Unlike any polis administrative officials, two demarchs, both of Eleusis, contributed money for their own sacrifices. The demarchs of Ikarion, Acharnai, Piraeus, and Eleusis supervised or “made” their local Dionysia with all their components. The demarch of Piraeus enforced regulations of the Thesmophorion there. All the demarchs were, according to a psephisma, to collect taxes from the cavalrymen (two drachmas) and hoplites (one drachma) of their deme each year for the support of a sanctuary of Apollo.197 The real, extensive, and continuous interaction of governmental administrative officers in sacrificial and other religious activity occurs at the deme level, not at the polis level, but these activities suggest what archons and other administra-tive officials would have been doing—and, again, what the evidence would look like—if the Athenians had assigned them extensive religious, especially sacrificial, roles. StrategoiWe have just surveyed the personal and financial religious roles of the strategoi of troops garrisoned in Attica, and they involved sacrifices, heortai, and the building of sanctuaries. None of this is to be found for the more usual strat-egoi of the classical and Hellenistic periods, but these activities of the strategoi of garrisons suggest how all strategoi, and in fact military officials in general, might have had a role in polis religion if the Athenians had determined to give them one.195 Agora 16.277 of ca. 180 is the last surviving deme decree.196 Also noteworthy is how many of the sacrifices by demarchs are to heroes and heroines, in contrast to those by polis officials. This probably reflects the very local character of many heroes and heroines.197 IG I3 138 of, probably, before 434."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":" 229Authority Of The Polis Some Observations on the Authority of the PolisWe offer here some observations based on the bulk of the evidence presented so far. One will find exceptions in the same evidence to some of these gener-alizations (as is always the case in studies of Greek religion), but we trust that some generalizations will be useful in assessing the range and degree of polis control of Athenian cults.At the outset we reassert that the polis, through the Ekklesia, had the authority and power to do whatever it wished concerning religion and reli-gious practices in Attica. It was constrained by τὰ πάτρια, previous nomoi and psephismata, and oracles, but it could by a vote of the majority decide to act in opposition to any one of these. A quite separate matter, but one critically important for the shape and practice of religion by Athenians, is what the Ekklesia did do, and likewise what the Boule, prytanies, its committees, and administrative and military officials did in fact do in contrast to what they might have done, and that is what the inscriptions and to a lesser extent the literary sources tell us.Except for the Ekklesia’s authority to authorize new cults and the basi-leus’ authority to mark and perhaps regulate sanctuary boundaries, all attested activity by units and officials of the polis in their official capaci-ties concerned only polis cults and polis heortai. If we look back to the ten types of cults distinguished in the Introduction (polis, tribal, deme, phratry, gentilic, oikos, private cults of citizens only, of foreigners only, or of foreign-ers and citizens together, and cults established by individuals), there is polis involvement attested only for the first, polis cults. We do not find nomoi and psephismata controlling the others or the polis providing financing for them. Administrative and military officials are not involved with them in an offi-cial capacity. In cases such as that of the cult of Bendis which moved from being a private cult to a polis cult, the polis acted in granting permission for the cult initially but became involved in the cult itself only after it became a polis cult. So, in terms of all non-polis cults, even if the Ekklesia or other polis agencies had the authority to control or regulate, they apparently did not.Even within the range of polis cults we find the polis legislative, admin-istrative, and military units involved in relatively few. There appears to have been regular, annual polis oversight and financing only for the cults of Athena Polias and Nike, Dionysus Eleuthereus, Asclepius, Apollo Patroös and Pythios, Demeter at Eleusis, Artemis Agrotera and Enyalios, Harmodius and Aristogiton, Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira in both city and Piraeus,"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"230CHAPTER 11Amphiaraus, Bendis, Theseus, and for the Thargelia and Hephaisteia.198 These are, of course, cults and heortai of central importance to the religion of Athens, but they are only a part of what one normally thinks of as Athenian polis cults and rituals. Not included, as examples, are the Aiora, Anakeia, Apatouria, Arrephoria, Boedromia, Bouphonia, Delphinia, Diasia, Dorpeia, Epidauria, Gamelia, Genesia, Hekatombaia, Hermaia, Kalligeneia, Kronia, Kybernesia, Metageitnia, Metoikia, Mounichia, Niketeria, Olympieia, Oschophoria, Pandia, Plerosia, Pompaia, Posidea, Procharisteria, Proerosia, Prometheia, Pyanopsia, Skira, Stenia, Synoikia, and Theogamia.199The two lists differ in good part because the former, those in which the polis is formally involved, include pompai and/or agones, whereas the latter are mostly simply rituals of various types. In fact, the majority of polis interven-tions in polis cults concern their agones and pompai, not their sacrifices or other rituals. In various ways and somewhat differently at different periods, archons, tamiai, epimeletai, hieropoioi, athlothetai, choregoi, and agonothetai alloted or elected by the Ekklesia and Boule “supervised,” organized, and man-aged the financing of these agones and pompai, events which were spectacles for a large public audience. There is no evidence that they, or the polis itself, controlled or regulated the prayers, hymns, dances, and the rituals of sacrifice or that they made the major sacrifices.The nomoi and psephismata listed in Chapter 7 and the discussions of the roles of various officials also indicate quite clearly that the main participation of the polis in those cults with which it was involved, through its legislative units, their committees, and the various officials, was financial. For some it paid for the perquisites of the priests or priestesses and for sacrificial victims and then, for a time after 334/3, recovered the costs of the skins from some of these sacrifices. For some heortai it financed the pompai and agones. For a few the polis as a whole was concerned with the value and protection of dedica-tions and paid the costs of repairing or remodeling them. It approved of the design of and paid for temples of polis cults. For these cults, listed above, it was primarily concerned with managing costs and revenues, not with, we might say, the performance of ritual.In terms of the financing of construction in sanctuaries and of certain other religious activities, we have a remarkable contrast between what Athenians as individuals were contributing for cults on Delos and what they apparently 198 We do not include here cults and heortai at which, as examples, the prytaneis or the ephebes sacrificed annually in the course of their term. On such sacrifices, see below.199 This list is from Parker, 2005.456–84 and Mikalson, 1975. On the possible disappearance of some of these during the Hellenistic period, see Parker, 1996.270–1."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":" 231Authority Of The Poliswere not contributing at home, all in the same period. In 168/7 the Romans gave Athens Delos as a free port. The Athenians expelled the Delians and took over the island, including all the cults, some old and venerable, some quite new. The Athenians reorganized the priesthoods, made them annual, and divided them among themselves.200 If we look at the next 80 years, until Mithridates sacked Delos in 88/7, we can compare contributions by individual Athenians in Athens and on Delos. For Athens we have record of contributions only by various agonothetai, kosmetai of the ephebes, by par-ticipants in the Pythaïdes,201 and by subscribers to a repair of the Theater of Dionysus in Piraeus (See Chapter 5). On Delos, by contrast, we have, apart from almost countless statue dedications, the following: gifts by individual Athenians including a cult statue, altars, an exedra, and various buildings for the sanctuary of Zeus Kynthios and Athena Kynthia; a temple and other build-ings for the Megaloi Theoi; an arch and doorway for Pan; for Sarapis a megaron, exedrai, vaults, altars, and steps, a spring house, a temple, and a gateway and pavement; and for Aphrodite Hagne vaults, a throne, pilasters, altars, and tem-ples. There is, simply put, nothing like this going on in Athens. In Athens there were some repairs to sanctuaries, on Delos major construction of new tem-ples, altars, and other buildings in several sanctuaries. Some Athenians obvi-ously had fortunes large enough to bear these major expenditures, but they chose to adorn Delos and its cults, not Athenian cults.202 We can only guess at possible reasons: the novelty of the new cults, the available space for new buildings, the lack of centralized polis control, the desire to impress an inter-national audience, and so forth. But, for our purposes, the salient point is that in Athens the surviving inscriptions indicate (ex silentio) that apparently there was no such major private financial support of polis cults.Most importantly, though, the Athenian polis through the individual cults’ revenues or through its own revenues paid, I would argue, for virtually all of the sacrifices made on behalf of the polis throughout the Hellenistic period. A review of the evidence in Chapter 5 indicates that neither priests, nor gov-ernment officials, nor private individuals paid for them, with rare exceptions in time of crisis. The same evidence indicates that, at various times and in various ways, individuals as elected or alloted officials sometimes paid all or some of the costs of the agones and pompai of some polis heortai, but not for the sac-rifices, which, with their accompanying prayers, would be the central religious 200 On all of this and on the following and for references, see Mikalson, 1998.216–41.201 And even many of these were priests of cults on Delos.202 The ultra-rich Medeios was an exception, contributing to both Delian and Athenian cults.

And it here must be noted that the polis did not pay for sacrifices or other events of genos, deme, or private cults.203The major change in financing, from the classical to the Hellenistic period, is widely recognized and well studied. In the classical period choregoi financed individual choruses in a number of Dionysiac heortai at considerable expense, and the change from the about fifty choregoi to one elected agonothetes dur-ing the reign of Demetrius of Phaleron (317/6–308/7) resulted in a distinctive feature of the finances of religious activities in the whole Hellenistic period. In the early times of the agonothesia the polis may have paid the costs and the agonothetes only “put on” the agones, but it is clear that from 283/2 at the latest and until at least the mid-second century and probably considerably later, the agones, the dramatic, dithyrambic, musical, and athletic contests, of some major religious heortai, including those of the Panathenaia and City Dionysia, could be financed at least in part by a rich and prominent Athenian as agonothetes each year.204 Other heortai in which agonothetai were possi-bly involved include the Lenaia, Thargelia, Dionysia in Piraeus and on Salamis, Eleusinia, and Delia.205 But were the agonothetai contributing, when they did contribute, only for the agones, as their name would imply, or were they also paying for sacrificial victims, the pompai, and other expenses of these heortai? 203 Parker (2005.62) claims that “the fragments surviving to us of Solon’s State Calendar of sacrifices reveal three or four instances of local sacrifices paid for by the city; there were doubtless many more.” Of the evidence he offers, frag. 82 (Ruschenbusch) just mentions a sacrifice to Leos at Hagnous, and Callimachus, frag. 103 [Pf.] similarly just claims that the kyrbeis “sing of ” the “Hero at the Stern.” No payment is mentioned in either. The genos of Salaminioi does twice receive “polis funds,” once for the statewide Oschophoria and Deipnophoria which they manage (R&O 37.20–22) and once for sacrificial victims for their sacrifices to Ion and perhaps others (87–8). The authority for the last is Solon’s kyr-beis. In the former certainly and perhaps in the latter, the polis is giving funds to the Salaminioi to perform their role in a polis-wide cult. The priestess of the cult of Artemis in Oinoe, who receives a sacrifice in Nicomachus’ calendar (SEG 52.48. frag. 12.4–6), is of sufficient polis importance that she had a reserved seat in the theater of Dionysus (see Lambert, 2002.384). Parker does not define what he means by “local sacrifices,” and I belabor all of this because I do not think that these should be taken as counter-examples to my claim that the Athenians as a polis did not offer financial support to gene, deme, and private cults, the only sure exception being when, as above, a genos is performing its duties for the polis ritual.204 On all aspects of the Athenian choregia, see Wilson, 2000. On the agonothesia and the results of the change from choregiai to agonothesiai, ibid. 270–6. For the possibility that the first agonothetai, as Xenocles in 307/6 (IG II2 3073), just “managed” the agones which the state paid for, ibid. 273.205 Wilson, 2000.382 n. 46."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":" 233Authority Of The PolisOne did, for one heorte. Miltiades shortly after 143 clearly solved a financial crisis of the Panathenaia, and not only put on the agones but also loaned the polis money, made repairs on the Acropolis, gave needed gear for the trans-port of the peplos, and took control of the pompe and sacrifices, paying for it all, apparently, himself.206 But this was an exceptional situation in an excep-tional time, and we should perhaps assume that usually agonothetai simply “made the agones,” but even that alone could involve enormous expense. Apart from the contributions of the agonothetai to the agones and except for Miltiades, we can assume, I think, that for the heortai the polis paid for the sacrifices and, after late IV BC, for the pompai of all but the Theseia.207The large and various programs of private giving for religious purposes initiated and promoted by Lycurgus after 336, a time in which he as a polis financial official solicited loans and funds and in-kind contributions from citizens and resident foreigners for religious purposes and buildings, were unique and were not sustained after his death. The sporadic giving after this time, except for the agonothetai, indicate that Lycurgus’ program did not become a model for the future, in part, perhaps, because of Athens’ change of leadership and reduced economic circumstances. The evidence collected and especially the “Summary of Contributions” in Chapter 5 allow some conclusions that put private contributions to polis cults into perspective. There were a few, sporadic contributions by individuals for polis religious matters. The Mysteries and other Eleusinian cults were the major beneficia-ries of private contributions by their epimeletai, demarchs, and one private individual. Strategoi of garrisoned troops, from 269/8 to late III BC, made generous contributions to cults in locales under their authority. Relatively brief fashions brought contributions from the agonothetai of the Theseia (161/0–153/2) and the kosmetai of the ephebes (117/6 and 102/1). These private contributions are few, sporadic, and mostly, it appears, one-time events. They do not reveal any serious, sustained, or organized effort by polis officials, priests and priestesses, or other religious officials. The infrequent and usu-ally small financial contributions by priests and other officials and individuals 206 IG II2 968.41–55. Philippides in 284/3 “gave to all Athenians all their agones” and may have also paid for the sacrificial victims of the heortai, although the general reference in line 47 is not decisive for this (IG II2 657.38–47). That agonothetai regularly sacrificed at heortai in which they were involved does not mean that they paid for the victims they sacrificed.207 The agonothetai of the Theseia in mid- to late II BC, in addition to financing the agones, also supervised the pompe, and one gave cash to the prytaneis for a sacrifice and to the bouleutai for a paid holiday. Two of them are remembered specifically for “giving readily” (ἐτοιμῶς διδόντων). See IG II2 956, 957, and 958."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"234CHAPTER 11that we have uncovered suggest strongly that, as in the classical period, throughout the Hellenistic period the polis bore virtually all the expenses of its religious program apart from the agones of some major heortai.The evidence from Chapter 5 would also suggest that neither the number of private contributions nor their amounts increased from the end of the Lycurgan period to the beginning of the Roman period. We have roughly the same number of contributions from III and II BC, and from III BC a good percentage are from strategoi of garrisoned soldiers, a special case, and from II BC a similar percentage are from agonothetai of the Theseia, an apparently new office. No one sacred or civil official apart from the agonothetai seems to have consistently, not to say increasingly, made donations throughout the Hellenistic period.At nearly the end of our period, 103/2–97/6, we see quite a new and, in fact, unique situation, probably occasioned by Athens’ increasingly desperate eco-nomic situation and the inability of the polis to finance a large new or revived religious activity, the Pythaïs, the theoria to be sent from Athens to Delphi. SEG 32.218 lists contributors to these Pythaïdes. They include, among various others, officials we have seen before: on the administrative side, the nine archons; on the military side, various strategoi; and on the religious side, Athenian priests of numerous cults on Delos.208 They were all contributing, as the result of a psephisma, ex officio because, while the individuals holding these offices changed from year to year, the titles remained constant on the donor list. Most officials of all types gave 100–250 drachmas each year. Noteworthy here is that the priests were contributing not to their own cults but to meet the costs of the Pythaïs.209 This situation and this document are unique in Athens’ Hellenistic history, and we must take care not to conclude from it that such contributions by these priests, archons, strategoi, and private individuals were customary or indicative of practices of the whole period.I offer all of this to counter the larger, common view that in the course of the Hellenistic period rich people assumed more and more of the costs of polis cult, specifically that there was a “collapse of conventional, collective, means of religious funding,” that “provision of sacrificial victims depended mainly on the generosity of those wealthy individuals who were also the city’s office-holders.”210 If we eliminate special cases, such as the strategoi of garrisoned 208 For the complete list of contributors, see Tracy, 1982.100–104. The technitai of Dionysus had contributed “not a little money” for their participation in the Pythaïs of 138/7 (FD 3.2.47.30–1).209 Other such subscriptions are rare and are of a much smaller scale.

We have such contributions for sacrifices, one time each, only by the priestess of Athena Polias in 255/4 and by the tamias of a prytany in 256/5. The special role of the agonothetai is decribed above. Some of them also at their own expense sacrificed—not necessarily the major sacrifices—in the Dionysia or Theseia of their years, but they should not be taken as the model for the usual situation in other polis cults.My interpretation of the evidence is that throughout the Hellenistic period the polis continued to bear, for those cults that did not have their own incomes, the vast majority of the expenses of the polis sacrifices and heortai, and also for the construction and maintenance of sanctuary properties, as it had done in the classical period.211 In the classical period choregoi were pay-ing the costs of agones of the Dionysiac heortai. In the Hellenistic period the agonothetai may have chosen, or not chosen, to contribute to these and, in addition, to those of some athletic agones. Apart from that, I find no evidence that after the age of Lycurgus polis support was limited or decreased, that wealthy individuals were now bearing the costs of polis cult. The polis cult was still the cult practised and largely paid for by the Demos.By way of contrast we may look at the financing of sacrificial programs in the demes and private religious associations (koina). A comparison between the State Calendar and those of the Marathonian Tetrapolis and of the deme Erchia is illuminating: the polis pays for its sacrifices but the demes, or at least these five demes, have individuals pay for them.212 On the State Calendar there is no indication of the source of the revenues. It must have been the polis. On the back of the Marathonian calendar are listed individuals and amounts of money (20–100) which they contributed, probably to create an endowment for the sacrificial program.213 The Erchia calendar is divided in such a way as to create five sections of sacrifices that each add up to an equal amount, ca. 110 drachmas, in all probability with each section to be paid for by one individual each year. In short, in these demes individuals were financing the sacrificial program. For polis cults there is no such indication, and the polis must have paid the costs.211 Not directly relevant but analogous with my claim are Habicht’s (1995) conclusions about the roles of the elites and non-elites in democratic states in the classical and Hellenistic periods.212 Calendar of polis, SEG 52.48; of Marathonian Tetrapolis, SEG 50.168; of Erchia, SEG 21.541.213 On this see Lambert, 2000a.66–7."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"236CHAPTER 11Also regarding demes, there is no record of the polis contributing to nor of polis officials participating in deme sacrifices,214 but we do have a few occur-rences of demesmen going to Athens to make sacrifices in V and IV BC.

In Anthesterion they also provided a sheep for the Diasia at Agrai.216 These are all not simply contributions of a deme to polis events, but annual sacrifices by demesmen on their own behalf at polis sanctuaries.217Private religious associations (koina), whether of citizens or foreigners, naturally depended heavily on their members for financial support. Their tamiai, epimeletai, and hieropoioi regularly contributed sums for sacrifices and repair or construction of their sanctuaries.218 The number of texts record-ing the activities of the koina is very small compared to those of the polis, and so the numerous accounts of the contributions of their members are all the more revealing. They suggest what the evidence might look like if polis officials had regularly contributed their own funds to polis religious activities.Some officials such as archons, hieropoioi, and agonothetai and also the ephebes made sacrifices “at” various events (Chapter 3), and a few reported to the Boule on the success of these sacrifices (Chapter 4). How are we to imag-ine the relationship of these to the activities of the priests and priestesses of 214 Mikalson, 1977.215 IG I3 258.25–31.

It concerns, probably, only the place of distribution of their share of the polis sacrifices. The genos of the Salaminioi did sacrifice a pig at the Panathenaia (R&O #37.88–9), but one can only speculate as to the context and purpose, as in Shear, 2001.168–9.218 See Chapter 4."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":" 237Authority Of The Polisthese deities? It seems reasonable to assume, given the nature of Greek reli-gion, that the default position, unless there is evidence to the contrary, is that the priest or priestess “made” the sacrifice,219 and also that for the major heor-tai there were a number of sacrifices by a number of individuals. If these two assumptions are correct, that would mean that when we have records of, e.g., the archon, agonothetai, Boule, epimeletai, and ephebes each sacrificing at the City Dionysia, these need not be, in fact almost certainly were not, the central, major sacrifice(s) of the heortai.220 We might term these sacrifices “accessory” to the main sacrifice.221 Such accessory sacrifices by the officials “supervising” the heortai and agones of cults are logical. Those by the prytaneis suggest a desire by the polis to be represented, not to control or dominate the event. Those by the ephebes may have been intended in part as their introduction to the religious activities of their country, particularly those cults which had a nationalistic flavor. The causes may differ, and we can only guess at them. But it is highly probable that these various sacrifices accompanied, but did not make, the main event. We do not have good evidence for this because, for example, that the priest of Dionysus made the major sacrifice of the City Dionysia did not need to be stated for an Athenian audience. That would have been known and assumed by all. What did deserve mention was when someone else also sacrificed in the heorte. I would also conclude from previous discussions that the priest was sacrificing victims paid for by the polis, a fact also obvious and taken for granted.222In connection with the above I would propose, although it cannot be proven, that an important organizing principle for polis religious activities was that the priests or priestesses “made” the core sacrifices and prayers in the events of their cults. Given the lack of evidence to the contrary and given general probability, we may assume this and assume as well that the priests and priest-esses supervised, controlled, and “performed” most or all the ritual elements of 219 Parker’s (2010.193–201) discussion of the new text from the deme Aixone (SEG 54.214), with its ten priesthoods and numerous sacrifices, brings to the foreground the number and sacrificial role of the many (Parker “recklessly” guesses at 545) deme priests and priestesses and helps to reestablish priests’ and priestesses’ central role in public sacrifice.220 A possible exception may be the sacrifices by the hieropoioi at the Panathenaia, IG II3 447.221 To justify the notion of “accessory” sacrifices, I offer προθύματα (on which see Mikalson, 1972) and ἐπιτελεώματα (as described in Lycurgus, frag. 6.2 [Conomis]), without suggest-ing that any of the sacrifices here described were so named.222 On this see, above, Chapter 2.

They need not have performed the whole ritual as described, e.g., by Homer. In some cases they may have just placed the offerings on the altar. This role of the priests and priestesses would have been so obvious to Athenians that it need not be stated. And this role of the priests and priestesses seems not to have been supervised by the polis. Priests of polis cults who handled money were, at least in IV BC, subject to the same financial audits as other public officials, but we do not have cases where priests or priestesses are brought to court for viola-tions of their duties.224 A few, such as the priest of Asclepius regularly and others occasionally, reported to the Boule on the good omens they received in sacrifices they made, but there is no evidence that they were expected to 223 In this regard, Lambert (2012.82) sees a change of role between priests and secular offi-cials: “in the classical period priests are praised for the performance of their religious duties and other officials for the performance of the core duties of their office: council-ors, for example, for their contributions to debate in the Council, superintendents of the water-supply for their contributions to the quality of the water-supply. In the Hellenistic period other officials are praised mainly for their performance of the same religious func-tions as priests are praised for.” Lambert offers as his one example IG II2 780 (his text #29), praise of the agonothetes Agathaeus (below, pp. 242–3). He does not make explicit the duties of the priests he includes, nor which “other officials” he means. If we limit ourselves to sacrifices and to the “officials” treated in this book, Lambert’s “change” seems chimerical. The agonothetai really do not come into play because they did not exist in the classical period. But, in any case, IG II2 780 of 252/1 is exceptional in that it does foreground the sacrifices by the agonothetes, as Lambert claims, but other texts praising agonothetai give either roughly equal attention to sacrifices vs. other agonothetic activities or far less attention to them (roughly equal, IG II2 657 and 682; less, IG II2 956, 957, 958, 968, and SEG 40.121). Lambert (82) concludes, without further evidence, that “The same could be said of the decrees honouring most Hellenistic officials—sacrifices are emphasised, the ‘secu-lar’ substance of their functions retires into the background.” For a somewhat different statement of this, see Gschnitzer, 1989.37: “dass in dem Augenblick, in dem eigentli-che Magistrate in diese Rolle eintreten, sie die Priester und sakralen Functionäre in eine untergeordnete Stellung, zu blossen Gehilfen herabdrücken.” I do not find that to be the case in the texts ascribing sacrifices to the officials discussed. I do not see the priests’ religious role diminished or the secular officials’ enlarged, nor that some sacrifi-cial activity by secular officials, if their sacrifices were accessory as I propose, needed to impinge on that of the priests and priestesses.224 An interesting exception here is the hierophant Archias who was tried in court on charges of ἀσέβεια for sacrificing παρὰ τὰ πάτρια, for making sacrifices the priestess should have made, and for having done it on the wrong day ([Dem.] 59.116). Here, as so very often, the cult was that of Demeter at Eleusis in which the polis was unusually engaged."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":" 239Authority Of The Polisreport or were examined on the proper performance of their duties. From V BC a few were elected and served one-year terms, but most were selected by gene for life-terms and would have been even less subject to polis-wide politi-cal influences.Such authority as the Ekklesia and Boule chose to exercise they often did through lay committees whose members, often ten in number, were elected or allotted for one-year terms by the Ekklesia and Boule. The roles of the dif-ferent committees, of hieropoioi, epimeletai, episkeuastai, athlothetai, and others varied over time and have been described above. These responsibili-ties seem mostly administrative in nature: supervising or “putting on” pompai and agones, receiving and disbursing polis funds for these events and for some sacrifices, overseeing the handling of dedications, the building of temples, and similar matters. There is no evidence that once in service these committees were under close supervision by the Boule or Ekklesia. Only the athlothetai are attested to have had to pass the dokimasia before their term began. They seem not to have rendered financial audits, either as individuals or as a board, at the end of their terms.225 Perhaps it was thought that the committee struc-ture itself, with members watching over one another, was sufficient to prevent fraud. Likewise there is no evidence that the committees or their individual members were held to account for their handling of non-financial matters in the religious sphere, but they were probably subject to accusations in the “review” meetings of the Boule that followed, for example, the City Dionysia and the Mysteries. They are many times praised by the polis, as a group but by name, for their good services, but we know of no instances where they were punished for misbehavior. It would appear that once appointed these com-mittees were relatively autonomous, but they would be, of course, guided in their actions by the nomoi, psephismata, and τὰ πάτρια. It is testament to the Athenians’ own knowledge of their polis cults that laymen could each year take up anew and complete so many adminstrative duties in the religious pro-gram of the polis. It is also, however, a sign of how fragmented authority was, 225 In terms of financial audits (εὐθυναί) at the end of terms, these board members may have been, in Athenian terminology, ἀνυπεύθυνοι, with a distinction, displeasing to Aeschines, between elected officials and volunteers taking on ἐπιμέλειαι and other such activities, often κατὰ ψηφίματα (Aeschin. 3.13–24). By contrast the activities of those charged with remaking or repairing dedications were monitored carefully, with a λόγος expected and sometimes engraved on stone (e.g., IG II3 1154 and II2 840). So, too, agonothetai, with so much individual authority and control over money, gave accountings of their use of public monies (IG2 657.47–9, 780.20–1, 956.20–2, 958.16–18, and SEG 39.125.21–2). Wilson (2000.383–4 n. 50) thinks these particular audits “may have been little more than an occa-sion on which the demos devised the form of honours to be bestowed on their benefactor.”"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"240CHAPTER 11even at this level, in these matters: it was divided among a large number of citizens, and it changed hands completely from year to year. Of course, the very existence of this committee system indicates the desire to fragment, not to unify authority in all these matters.In terms of the larger structure of polis control of religious activities, we need to begin with τὰ πάτρια and the nomoi of Solon. The nomoi of Solon prob-ably codified some of the πάτρια already existing at Solon’s time. Some were probably provisions for new or recent practices, practices which for later gen-erations who respected them as Solon’s nomoi became part of their πάτρια. Some of these nomoi treated the whole of polis cult, cult by cult, as, for exam-ple, the State Calendar which listed the days of sacrifice, the cost of the vic-tims, and the cost of the perquisites for officials. Others seem to have offered prescriptions which covered religious behavior in general, as, for example, that τὰ ἱερά be the first items on the agenda of the Ekklesia, the limitations on par-ticipation at the perirrhanteria of the Agora, and pollution.Others concerned specific cults, especially that of Demeter at Eleusis. None, so far as we know, claims authority over non-polis cults.The nomoi and psephismata of later centuries were adopted in relation to Solon’s nomoi, consciously modifying, expanding, or limiting them, or they were responses to new situations, but always in the framework of Solon’s nomoi. They are all cult-specific and do not embrace under one nomos all cults, practices, or religious officials. Each has the appearance of an ad hoc response to a current situation and solves it through the legislative and administrative structure of its time. The resulting hodge-podge of nomoi and psephismata was not regularized until the recodification of the nomoi, including nomoi and psephismata on religious matters, by Nicomachus and his fellow commis-sioners in late V BC. We do not know when some distinctive features of the Athenian religious system were introduced: that, for example, the basileus handled αἱ πάτριοι θυσίαι and the archon τὰ ἐπίθετα, although the archon’s role in the City Dionysia and the history of that heorte suggests that this division was early, perhaps Solonian, at least by mid-VI BC The committee structure of control of the pompai and agones looks very democratic, perhaps dating to late VI BC. The priestly control of sacrifices, prayers, and other rituals as I have posited it would be very old, surely predating even Solon, as would have been the gentilic ownership of the priesthoods.The Athenian system of managing its polis cults obviously worked, and we may ask whether that is a result of a carefully designed system or one resulting from ad hoc responses as needs arose. There are four obvious cases of thought-ful management: the codification of the religious calendar and nomoi by Solon;"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":" 241Authority Of The Polisthe recodification of the religious (and other) nomoi at the end of the fifth century; the creation, probably very early on in the democracy, of the lay com-mittees; and the institution of the choregic system and then its replacement by the agonothesia during the time of Demetrius of Phaleron. The lay com-mittees and probably also the choregic system brought some very democrati-cally oriented control over major heortai which had probably been dominated by aristocratic groups before. The introduction of the agonothesia went in the opposite direction, with one individual assuming authority over, at least, the agones of some major heortai. Apart from these, most of the rest of what we see in legislative actions are ad hoc responses to new cults, especially their financing, or, more frequently, modifications and elaborations of what at least later Athenians considered to be the laws of Solon. Finally, such major cases of “thoughtful management,” apart from Solon’s nomoi, concerned primarily finances and agones, and none occurred after the end of the fourth century.What we have, then, is a system first organized under Solon, then modi-fied and expanded by various ad hoc decisions, and first reorganized about 180 years later, not to be systematically reorganized again. Authority was highly fragmented, with priests and their gene controlling the rituals of most polis cults, and with the Ekklesia, Boule, and various administrative and lay officials involved in a variety of ways in the financing and in the spectator events of a few major heortai. It worked, apparently, but it was hardly a coherent system that controlled closely the activities of its officials, priests and priestesses, and devotees. My conclusions here lead back to the conclusions of Robert Garland with which this chapter began, that “Religious authority in archaic and clas-sical Athens was not in fact the preserve of any single social or political class, caste, or milieu. Its essence was complex and it had many sources and outlets,” and “religious authority . . . was the monopoly neither of the citizen body as a whole nor of any particular group of individuals within it. It was a discrete prerogative shared out among a number of corporations comprising amateurs as well as experts, clergy as well as laity.”226226 Garland, 1984.75 and 120."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���6 | doi ��.��63/97890043�9�96_0�5CHAPTER 12ApprobationWe offer this commendation of the agonothetes Agathaeus, son of Autocles, of the deme Prospalta,1 IG II2 780.6–20 from 252/1, the fullest such commenda-tion we have, as a way to begin to summarize, through a translation, some of the results of our inquiry.2Concerning what the agonothetes reports about the sacrifices which he sacrificed to Dionysus and the other gods to whom it was an ancestral (custom to sacrifice), with good fortune, it has been resolved by the Demos, to accept the good things (i.e., favorable omens) that occurred in the sacrificial victims which he was sacrificing for the health and safety of the Boule and Demos of Athenians and their children and wives and King Antigonus. . . .

Agathaeus then reported to the Boule that the omens were good in the sacrificial victims which he sacrificed. The Boule and then the Ekklesia passed a resolution accepting his report and praising him for his εὐσέβεια towards the gods and his φιλοτιμία towards the Demos of Athenians. He also had seen to the performance of the proagones, the “pre-agones,” not all of them but those which were held “in the sanctuaries,” and he had overseen various agones, his specific task as agonothetes. For all of this, in summary, he is again praised for his εὐσέβεια toward the gods and his φιλοτιμία towards the Boule and Demos of Athenians.In brief summary, εὐσέβεια, directed to the gods, is included in Agathaeus’ praises because he had himself performed sacrifices, not because of his admin-istrative activities. His φιλοτιμία is directed to his fellow citizens, and, depend-ing on context, may refer to sacrificial activity, administrative activity, or both. My rendering of καλῶς as “beautifully” in the phrases καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς and καλῶς καὶ φιλοτίμως is, if correct, one aspect, or really two—of sacrifice and of agones—of an esthetic of Athenian popular religion, of a pervasive desire that the major elements of religion, sacrifices, sacrificial victims, ritual, dedica-tions, sanctuaries and their buildings, pompai, and, especially for the agono-thetes Agathaeus, agones should be things of beauty.3 And, finally, for the religious activities concerning certain deities and certain heortai, as here for Dionysus and the City Dionysia, τὰ πάτρια, “the ancestral (customs),” are the authority that is invoked, whereas for others, if authorities are given, we may expect nomoi, psephismata, or oracles.After he has given his accounting, Agathaeus as his reward is to receive from the Demos “whatever good he seems worthy of ” (εὑρέσθαι παρὰ τοῦ δήμου ἀγαθ[ὸν ὅτου ἂν δοκ]εῖ ἄξιος εἶναι), and the decree is to be inscribed on a stele and erected in the temenos of Dionysus (21–5), on the south slope of the Acropolis, where this inscription was found. In these decrees the “good” of which the honorand is worthy is usually more specific.

This praise expressed in the docu-ment, sometimes announced at a heorte, and published on the stele. For a brief period, the second half of IV BC, the polis rewarded a few who performed their duties well, especially religious duties, with funds “for a sacrifice” or “for a sac-rifice and a dedication.”5 Neither the recipient of the sacrifice nor the nature of the dedication is specified. The deity is probably the deity served by the respec-tive individuals and in whose sanctuary the stele is to be placed. The cost of the sacrifices, sometimes as much as 100 drachmas for a board, suggests a signifi-cant event. The occasion may have been the erection of the stele or dedication and would have provided a nice banquet for the honorands and their families. All of this is probably true of similar, but usually smaller “thank-you” sacri-fices awarded by demes, tribes, the Mesogeoi, and the orgeones of Amynos, Asclepius, and Dexion.6 Lambert has observed that “unlike Athenians, foreign-ers were never awarded money for a dedication and sacrifice.”7 In a cultic con-text that makes perfect sense. A foreigner would not be expected, or, better, would be expected not to make a sacrifice or dedication to an Athenian deity. In any case, this fashion of awarding funds to an honorand for a “thank-you” sacrifice was relatively brief.But religious actions alone did not receive the greatest honors, αἱ μέγισται τίμαι, that Athens had to offer: sitesis in the Pyrtaneion, a bronze statue, and 4 Hakkarainen, 1997.26: “After the year 332/1 there is no honorary decree without crowning.” See also Lambert, 2012a.8, 95, and 100, and Henry, 1983.23.

Occasionally a clause of “hortatory intention,” to encourage others to behave in the same way, is added onto honors for reli-gious activities as it is for those who have performed other services.10 For our purposes we treat only those texts that praise solely religious actions—not secular actions or religious and secular together, and we include honorary decrees of demes, gene, and private associations. There are two categories of these clauses in our texts: 1) those stating that the group is or wishes to appear expressing gratitude or knows how to do so—an implied hortatory intention; and 2) those explicitly encouraging others to perform in the same way as the honorand, sometimes in the explicit context of competition.

Perhaps the thought was that the social or political group would reward the one, the gods the other. The one exception is revealing. The priestess of Athena Polias had served well, φιλο[τιμουμέ]νη περὶ [τὴν θε]όν, an odd use of φιλοτιμούμενος directed to the gods, and the hortatory intention is expressed as “so that the Demos may appear honoring those who make eusebeia towards the gods of most importance,”17 also a unique content in a hortatory intention. Here, as we saw before for this priestess, the φιλοτιμία towards fellow citizens may have been credited to her husband, the εὐσέβεια to her.18Eumolpidae, IG II2 1235.9–11 of ca. 274/3; for theoroi, by the state, IG II3 1372.11–13 of before 180; for the priest of Kalliste, by the state, IG II2 788.15–18 of 235/4; and for a priest of Asclepius, by the polis, IG II3 1386.2–4 of ca. 170.14 ὅπως ἂν εἰδῶσιν οἱ ἀεὶ μέλλοντες χορηγεῖν Αἰξωνεῦσι ὅτι τιμήσει αὐτοὺς ὁ δῆμος ὁ Αἰξωνέων τοὺς εἰς ἑαυτοὺς φιλοτιμου[μ]ένους (Schwenk #66.22–8 of 326/5).

Of these only the bouleutai, choregoi, agonothetes, benefactor, epimeletai of the Mysteries, and the priestess of Athena Polias clearly contributed money as part of their services. If we look at the whole of the texts praising them, rais-ing money was not the only or, apparently, the most important purpose of the hortatory clauses.The small private religious associations were particularly dependent on the financial and other contributions of their members,19 and it is not surprising that, proportionately, they used the hortatory intention clause far more com-monly. The citizen orgeones of Bendis in early II BC even employed, uniquely, both types of the clause in one text praising an epimelete: ὅπως ἂν οὖν καὶ οἱ ὀργεῶνες φαίνωνται χάριτας ἀξίας ἀποδιδόντες τοῖς ἀεὶ φιλοτιμουμένοις and ἵνα καὶ τοῖς λοιποῖς τῶν ὀργεώνων ἅπασιν ἐφάμιλλον εἶ τοῖς βουλομένοις πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς εὐσεβεῖν καὶ πρὸς τοὺς ὀργεῶνας φιλοτιμεῖσθαι (IG II2 1324.10–12 and 19–23). The language of other texts from private koina is very similar to those of the polis, as is the emphasis.20 The εὐσεβεῖν of the text above is unique, and the others concentrate on φιλοτιμία, sometimes directed just to the members or the koinon as a whole,21 sometimes to the deity as well as to the association.22 Two of the latter cases are in honor of priestesses (IG II2 1314 and 1337), much like the use of φιλοτιμία in the polis decree for the priestess of Athena Polias (IG II2 776). As in the polis honors, some but not all of these private associa-tions had clearly received financial support from the honorands.23One sees, from mid-IV BC, individuals (priests, hieropoioi, and such) and groups (e.g., the prytaneis and ephebes) increasingly honored for their per-formance of sacrificial and other religious roles. Priests had always performed sacrifices, prytaneis probably since Solon had made sacrifices before meet-ings of the Ekklesia, but only now are they specifically honored for those, often in association with other activities. This change reflects a new fashion 19 See Chapter 5.20 Orgeones of Amynos, Asclepius, and Dexion, IG II2 1252.19–22; of Bendis, 1284.7–11, 1324.10–12, 19–25; of Syrian Aphrodite, 1337.9–11; koinon of Mother of the Gods, 1273.18–21, 1314.9–12, and 1315.16–18; thiasotai of Aphrodite, 1261.53–5; of Tynaros, 1262.12–15; of Zeus Labraundos, 1271.18–21; of Artemis, 1297.6–9; and koina of unidentified deities, 1259.7–9, 1277.29–33, and 1278.5–8; and Sarapiastae, 1292.17–19.21 IG II2 1252, 1259, 1262, 1273, 1284, and 1292.22 IG II2 1277, 1314, 1315, and 1337.

But, regardless of who received credit for doing the sacrifices, for administering the heortai, or for, in some cases, making financial contributions, these same activities are directed to the same deities, the same heortai, and, perhaps, for much the same purposes as they had been in the archaic and classical periods. That is, τὰ πάτρια were respected and main-tained. And some sacrifices and prayers, at least, were “for the benefit of the Boule and Demos,” that is, explicitly intended to benefit the corporate group, and it was the corporate group, the polis, which through its decrees honored these activities of individuals.

When the phrase is expanded, as it often is, it becomes apparent that the εὐσέβεια is directed to the gods and, importantly, that the φιλοτιμία is directed to one’s fellow citizens. That emerges clearly in the praise of Agathaeus: “making εὐσέβεια towards the gods of the highest impor-tance and showing the goodwill and φιλοτιμία which he has towards the Demos of Athenians” and “because of his εὐσέβεια towards the gods and his φιλοτιμία towards the Boule and Demos of Athenians” (IG II2 780.11–13, 19–20).1From these formulae and many similar in many texts we may claim that our documents show, more clearly than other sources, the pervasive presence of two dimensions of religious actions, one for the audience of the gods, one for the audience of fellow citizens.2 The gods, i.e., εὐσέβεια, almost always come 1 It is worth noting here that a purpose of sacrifice, for example, is ἵνα ἂν ἔχῃ καλῶς καὶ εὐσεβῶς τὰ πρὸς τοὺς θεούς, never ἵνα ἄν ἔχῃ φιλοτίμως τὰ πρὸς τοὺς θεούς.2 When an individual or group has performed a variety of secular and religious activities and is praised, in summation, εὐσεβείας ἕνεκα καὶ φιλοτιμίας (as in, e.g., IG II2 668, 677, 1163, 1320, I. Eleusis 181, Agora 15.78, 115, IG II3 1155, 1165, and 1166), one need not, perhaps should not, assume that the εὐσέβεια refers to the religious activities, the φιλοτιμία strictly to the secu-lar ones. φιλοτιμία is commonly invoked for purely religious acts, commonly in the phrases καλῶς καὶ φιλοτίμως (as especially in prytany decrees, e.g., Agora 15.115.12–13 and 17–19, IG II3 1304.13–15, and Agora 15.240.15–16, but also in IG II2 788.10–12, Lambert, 2012.99–100, #6.20–22, Agora 16.186.11–15, and IG II3 1329.8–11) and εὐσεβείας ἕνεκα καὶ φιλοτιμίας (e.g., IG II2 676, 690, 780, 788, 1166, I. Eleusis 93, IG II3 1139, 1164, Agora 15.78, 85, SEG 18.19, R&O #46, and I. Rhamnous II.59). The separate “social dimension” of these honors has been noticed before, but scholars such as Lambert (2012.76 and 2011.201–2) tend to put the emphasis on the awarding of the honors, that is that the honors have both a religious and social dimension. I think, rather, that the context in many cases is the act itself, that one, for example, as in Agathaeus’ case, sacri-ficed εὐσεβείας ἕνεκα καὶ φιλοτιμι�́ας, that the ἕνεκα clause describes the intent of the agent. If I"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"250CHAPTER 13first, in accord with the usual priority of the gods in Greek life, but the sec-ond, which we may call the social dimension, is regularly there. εὐσέβεια, we have determined, is used only in certain contexts directly involving the gods, such as sacrifice and sanctuaries, but for other religious activities, such as staging a pompe or serving as a hieropoios, φιλοτιμία is also very, very com-mon, usually in the phrase καλῶς καὶ φιλοτίμως.3 Here, too, we should think of the φιλοτιμία as directed to the human audience. In all of these the agent was clearly wishing to win not only the approval of the gods but also the approval of his human audience. In the context of sacrifice, that τὰ ἱερά are καλά indi-cates the approval of the former, and our honorary inscriptions themselves express the approval of the latter.The primary element of this social dimension is φιλοτιμία, that “love of honor” we have seen so many times and have discussed previously. To review briefly, this is φιλοτιμία in relation to the Demos, to one’s fellow citizens, or, depending on the context of the action, it may be directed to one’s fellow tribesmen, demesmen, or members of a private religious κοινόν. It is to love that τιμή which is the prize for benefactions, the communal reward given to one who benefits the community.4 To state again MacDowell’s excellent sum-mary (1990.378–9), φιλοτιμία “refers not only to a state of mind but also to an activity for the purpose of gaining honour; and honour (τιμή) means praise, admiration, deference, and sometimes material rewards, given by other people in acknowledgement of such activity successfully undertaken.” In our honor-ary texts that τιμή is expressed through praise. Such praise of one individual could also engender competition for similar τιμή among others, as is explicitly stated in a few texts.5What all of this means is that when an individual in a public context sac-rificed, supervised sacrifices, served as a hieropoios, epimeletes, agonothetes, am correct, we have what motivated the individual to perform the act as he did, an important religious datum, not what motivated the audience to give the honors.3 Refer to examples in Chapter 1.4 φιλοτιμία is, in this period, good. μικροφιλοτιμία is bad. Diggle (2004. 405), in discussing Theophrastus Char. 21, defines μικροφιλοτιμία as “honour based on trivialities,” and describes ὁ μικροφιλοτίμιος as “naively and innocently vain because he has a false sense of what is important.” The individual who took great pride in and made a great show of, among other things, reporting (to the Boule?) the success of the prytaneis’ sacrifice at the Galaxia to the Mother of the Gods was, according to Theophrastus, μικροφιλοτίμιος. The point is probably that he took excessive pride and made an inappropriate show in the reporting of a minor sac-rifice, as he did in the bronze finger he dedicated to Asclepius and then assiduously tended.5 On such “hortatory” clauses in honorific inscriptions, see Chapter 12."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":" 251Social And Esthetic Dimensions Of Religious Actionsor performed other religious duties,6 he had one eye on the gods, one eye on his peers. He meant to please both.7But for women, demonstrating φιλοτιμία towards fellow citizens may not have been thought appropriate or praiseworthy at the polis level.8 This is apparent in the honors granted to the priestess of Athena Polias in IG II2 776 of 237/6. Her φιλοτιμία is directed, unusually, only “to the goddess” (15–16),9 and equally unusually in the hortatory clause she is praised for giving great importance to only εὐσέβεια, not εὐσε�́βεια καὶ φιλοτιμία (20–2). In the summation she is praised only for her εὐσέβεια (25–6) whereas, in the same text, her husband is praised for both his εὐσέβεια and φιλοτιμία (26–30). So, too, the priestess of Aglauros in 250/49 is honored solely for her εὐσέβεια towards the gods (SEG 33.115. 33).10 Nowhere is a priestess honored with the phrase καλῶς καὶ φιλοτίμως widely used to commend the religious activities of men.11 Perhaps the attitude of Pericles still prevailed, “Great is the reputation of a woman whose fame (κλέος) for virtue or censure is least widespread among males” (Thuc. 2.45) or, as Lambert (2012.81) puts it, “Partly it is because a priest-ess has no—or at least a limited—locus in the male world of the hurly-burly of Athenian politics, of the Council and Assembly and the whole business of competition for honour. In a sense of course these honorific decrees draw her a little into that world, but they draw her in only up to a point. A certain separ-ateness and aloofness from the male arena is maintained.”6 The list of individuals honored for their φιλοτιμία in religious activities includes priests, epimeletai, hieropoioi, agonothetai, prytaneis, strategoi, astynomoi, ephebes and their kosmetai, demarchs and other deme officials, thiasotai, and orgeones.7 If we add parents to the mixture, we have Lycurgus, Leoc. 15: “For you know in what you Athenians differ most from other people, τῷ πρός τε τοὺς θεοὺς εὐσεβῶς καὶ πρὸς τοὺς γονέας ὁσίως καὶ πρὸς τὴν πατρίδα φιλοτίμως ἔχειν. On ὁσιότης in respect to parents, see Mikalson, 2010.148–50.8 On all of this in regard to priestesses, see Lambert, 2012.80–1 and Chapters 1 and 2 above.9 The same phrase is restored in SEG 29.135.9–10. The meaning of this phrase may be explained from the fuller form in IG II2 1314.7–8 of 212/1, καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ ἐφιλοτιμήθη ὅσα προσῆκεν τε͂ι θεῶι. For φιλοτιμία directed to both the deity and the group, see, from private cults, IG II2 1314.9–12, 1315.16–18, and, as restored, 1337.10–11.10 Cf. the praise of the Athenian priestess of Athena Polias in Hesp. Suppl. 15, #3.11 Private groups were less reticent to attribute φιλοτιμία to their priestesses: thiasotai / orgeones of Mother of the Gods: IG II2 1314, 1315, 1316 (for a husband and his priestess wife) and, perhaps, Agora 16.235; and, as restored, orgeones of Syrian Aphrodite, IG II2 1337. Cf. the φιλοτιμία, much emphasized, of the epimeletria of the cult of Agathe Thea, SEG 56.203."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"252CHAPTER 13We have argued above that praise for φιλοτιμία in religious activities does not imply a financial contribution unless that is explicitly stated or is inher-ent in the office, as that of choregos. But some contributors are praised for their φιλοτιμία, and we can perhaps best understand the social and moral dimensions of such financial contributions through Aristotle’s treatment of μεγαλοπρέπρεια, although this word and its cognates rarely, if ever, occur in Attic inscriptions. It has occasionally been restored, but usually wrongly.12 For Aristotle μεγαλοπρέπεια concerns only expenditures of money in a certain way and for a certain purpose.13 It is ἐν μεγέθει πρέπουσα δαπάνη, “expenditure fit, proper, or perhaps better conspicuous or distinctive in size.”14 ὁ μεγαλοπρεπής made such expenditures for the sake of the τὸ καλόν (τοῦ καλοῦ ἕνεκα), not to show off his wealth, and does so happily and lavishly (ἡδέως καὶ προετικῶς).15 μεγαλοπρέπεια involves an ἔργον, a task or deed, that is μέγα and καλόν, and those who observe it are filled with wonder (θαυμαστή). It is among those expenditures that bring “honor” (τὰ τίμια), like those concerning gods, that is, for dedications, buildings, and sacrifices, and similarly “about everything divine” (περὶ πᾶν τὸ δαιμόνιον). These expenditures which are for the commu-nity are εὐφιλοτίμητα, an example of which is the choregia. ὁ μεγαλοπρεπής spends not on himself but for the public things (εἰς τὰ κοινά), and his gifts are something like dedications (EN 4.1122a18–1123a34).16 Aristotle would hardly consider all our donors μεγαλοπρεπεῖς,17 but the language he uses and that of our texts are remarkably similar: for Aristotle οἱ μεγαλοπρεπεῖς do what they do for the sake of τὸ καλόν and for τιμή; in our texts the donors are often praised 12 See, e.g., IG II2 649.27 vs. SEG 45.101.27 and IG II2 890.13 vs. IG II3 1275.13. The one sure example is late, SEG 45.116 bis.16 of 98/7. Agora 15.81.7 of 267/6 is also a possible instance.13 On Aristotelian μεγαλοπρέπεια in a democratic context, see von Reden, 2003.84–5. On μεγαλοπρέπεια in archaic and classical literature, see Kurke, 1991.167–82.14 No single English word comes near to translating it. “Magnificence,” in LSJ and commonly used by philosophers, is hopelessly inadequate. I therefore use the Greek term through-out. The adjective μεγαλοπρεπής is used of both the agent and the action. In prose authors it can characterize, among other things, entertainment of xenoi (Xen. Oec. 2.5, An. 7.6.3, and Hdt. 6.128.1); care of the dead (Isoc. 9.2, and Pl. Hp. Mai. 291e2 and Menex. 234c3); and, as in the epigraphic texts, performance of sacrifices and heortai (Hdt. 4.76.3, Pl. Rep. 2.362c2, Isoc. 7.29 and 16.34, Xen. Cyr. 6.2.6 and Ve c t. 6.1, and Arist. Pol. 6.1321a35–6); of liturgies (Isoc. 19.36); of the making of dedications (Pl. Rep. 2.362c2); and of the care of sanctuaries ([Dem.] 59.77).15 Cf. ἀφειδῶς . . . καὶ μεγαλοπρεπῶς, used by his son to describe Alcibiades’ expenditures for sacrifices and other elements of the heorte at Olympia, the Olympic Games (Isoc. 16.34).16 Cf.

That μεγαλοπρέπεια occurs so rarely in our texts concerning donors is probably because it and the more usual expression of the same activity in our texts are slightly different ways of praising essen-tially the same thing.The donors may well have been pleased by the “honor” they received, and for some this may have been enough. But we should not imagine that such dona-tions were usually for the self-satisfaction of the donor or from a sense of altru-ism. The “honor” resulting from μεγαλοπρέπεια had its own returns (χάριτες) for the donor and often his family, and J. K. Davies (1981, especially 88–105) has col-lected and discussed the explicit references to these in the literary sources. In the fifth century we hear more of increased political power through elections (as for strategoi) and appointments.18 In the fourth century we hear mostly of defendants bringing to the attention of juries their personal donations and expecting thereby to win the favor of the jury.19 Davies and Kurke see a change in emphasis,20 but it also may be partially a matter of a change of sources, with political sources dominant for the fifth century, oratorical sources for the fourth century.21 Our inscriptions do not, for fairly obvious reasons, express the political or forensic χάριτες expected to result from the “honors” given to the donors, but we can expect, I think, that they would have been in the political and forensic areas as well as the social.

We here survey what we might term καλός and κόσμος expressions concern-ing religious actions and objects, especially as they occur in the inscriptions and texts already studied.22 καλός in its various forms is particularly com-plicated, and we are fortunate to have David Konstan’s excellent new book Beauty (2014) to guide us. The abstract noun κάλλος seems, almost always, to denote “visual beauty,” of men, women, and objects, but its adjectival (and much more common) form καλός has a much wider domain, ranging from the physical to the abstract, from “beautiful” to what Konstan offers as “unusually attractive,” “fine,” “splendid,” “brilliant,” “excellent of its kind,” “noble,” “honor-able,” and “good” (31–62). “The context is what discriminates among the several senses of the term” (39).23 Konstan offers a plethora of examples, especially concerning humans and works of art, from Homer through late antiquity. To each of these he attempts to assign the appropriate meaning and nuance, but rarely is the visual side of a καλός term completely submerged and “there is no doubt that in many cases ‘beautiful’ is a reasonable equivalent for καλός” (61). Konstan stresses that for some examples “order” and “proportion” are essential to the Greek concept of “beauty” (κάλλος) (103 and 106–8), but he does not offer specific treatment of the critical word here, κόσμος, which, like the καλός terms, has a wide range of meanings: in its nominal forms, “good order,” “deco-ration,” “adornment;” in its verbal forms, “to put in good order,” “to decorate,” “to adorn.” Like “visual beauty” for καλός terms,24 “order” seems central to the κόσμος terms and the other meanings develop from that. This is not the place, nor am I the person, to do a Konstan-type study of κόσμος terms, but I stress here, and we will see later, how “beauty” and “order” are closely related to and 22 The following is intended as an introduction to this esthetic dimension of Greek reli-gion, one focused on the Athenian evidence.

This esthetic concern was clearly a Panhellenic phenomenon, as Chaniotis’ descriptions of, especially, pompai (2013.34–9 and 1995.158–9) indicate, and that and possible diachronic changes need to be investigated, but that is a topic for a separate book.23 Konstan claims (39) that the “basic sense” of καλός is “fine” or “excellent,” and that this basic sense, “when applied to physical appearance, naturally suggests the idea of beauty.” I would propose, from Konstan’s own examples and their nature and distribution over time, that its basic sense is of visual beauty, and that this was, in the broader and unique Greek esthetic, expanded over time to moral and other abstract areas. But there is no need to argue this (important) point here.24 In what follows my uses of “adorn” are based on κόσμος expressions in the Greek."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":" 255Social And Esthetic Dimensions Of Religious Actionsare essential to the esthetic dimension of Greek religion. A well-ordered cho-rus or pompe is a thing the Athenians thought beautiful, a thing worth “seeing.”I trust that the expressions of beauty over a large range of religious prac-tices and objects offered below will by themselves be sufficient to establish the esthetic dimension of these practices and objects. I hope they will also make plausible, if not definitively prove, our interpretation of the omnipres-ent adverb καλῶς as “beautifully” in a wide range of religious contexts. If, for example, a sacrifice is supposed to be καλή, it is likely, in my judgement, that an individual who is praised for sacrificing καλῶς is being honored for making it so. If this is so, the range and ancient appreciation of the esthetic dimension of Greek religion are significantly expanded.We begin, as we began this book, with sacrifice.25 One purpose of making detailed arrangements for sacrifices is thrice repeated, ὅπως ἂν γίγνηται ἡ θυσία ὡς καλλίστη, and the natural translation of this is, “so that the sacrifice may be ‘as beautiful as possible.’ ”26 The act of sacrifice itself has its own beauty. Socrates in [Pl.] Alcibiades II.148e5–149a4 can have the Athenians claim that “we perform” (ἄγομεν) the most and the most beautiful (καλλίστας) sacrifices of the Greeks, this in contrast to the Lacedaemonians who sacrifice animals that are ἄνάπηρα (“maimed”), something which Aristotle (frag. 101 [R3]) claimed “we do not do.” And here, to anticipate later conclusions, if my understanding of καλῶς in phrases such as καλῶς καὶ εὐσέβως is correct, we have abundant epi-graphical evidence on the desirability of “sacrificing beautifully.” And, as part 25 Naiden (2013) touches on but later (2015) stresses the importance of the esthetic element in sacrifice. I seek more consistency in the meaning of terms such as ὡς κάλλιστα and ἱερὰ καλά than he does, but we are in strong agreement on the importance—probably to both gods and men—of this esthetic element, and I offer more evidence in support of it.26 As Shear (2001.74 and 86) renders it. Cf. Georgoudi (2007.100): “afin que le sacrifice soit ‘le plus beau.’ ” Rhodes and Osborne, 2003 translate this phrase in IG II3 447.5 as “in order that the sacrifice . . . may be as fine as possible,” but, as Konstan (2014.32–3) notes, “ ‘fine,’ which is perhaps the most common rendering of καλός in English today, evades the prob-lem of the connection between καλόν and beauty.” Naiden (2013.211) has “as handsome as possible,” as part of an extensive treatment (210–17) of ὡς κάλλιστα in sacrificial contexts but later (2015.467) prefers “fair,” “as meaning both ‘handsome’ and ‘socially and morally acceptable,’ ” in accord with his concept of two senses of καλῶς in sacrificial contexts. Lupu (2005.154) has “in order that the sacrifice might be performed in the best possible way,” suggesting that he is taking the adjective adverbially. The relevant texts are IG II3 447.5–6, IG II3 348.12–15, and I. Eleusis 85.5–6 and 20. Naiden (2013.63–8) offers a variety of criteria, from one sanctuary or another, and from one time period or another, used in the selection of animals for sacrifice."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"256CHAPTER 13of some sacrifices, the ephebes were to “lift up” the victim “with good form” (εὐσχημόνως), no doubt contributing to the visual effect of the ritual.27This emphasis on the “beauty” of the sacrifice is complemented by a simi-lar emphasis on the “beauty” of the sacrificial victims. In the Homeric Hymns τὰ ἱερά, the sacrificial animals, for Demeter, Apollo, and Aphrodite are καλά, as are to be those for Zeus, Poseidon, and Athena in the Iliad.28 In the 330’s the hieropoioi of the annual Panathenaia are to sacrifice to Athena Nike a cow, “after making a selection from the beautiful cows” (προκρί[ναντες ἐκ τῶν] καλλιστευουσῶν βοῶν).29 The ephebes (regularly), the father of a kanepho-ros, a priest of Asclepius, and government officials presented sacrificial victims (sometimes a specific animal, sometimes just θύματα) that were (ὡς) ὅτι κάλλιστα.30 So the victims for sacrifice are, before they are killed, to be καλά or, better, ὡς κάλλιστα.31 And the comic poets play on this, Aristophanes (Ach. 791–2) lewdly, κάλλιστος ἔσται χοῖρος ̓Αφροδίτᾳ θύειν (“She will be a most beautiful pig to sacrifice to Aphrodite), and Menander (Dys. 567–8) sarcasti-cally, καλὸν γὰρ τεθύκαθ ̓ ἱερεῖον, πάνυ ἄξιον ἰδεῖν (“You have sacrificed a beauti-ful sacrificial victim, very worth looking at”).In preparation for the sacrifice these “beautiful” animals, especially cows, are to be further beautified with fillets, i.e., loose strands of wool with pieces of string tied around them at regular intervals, as described and illustrated by Van Straten (1995.43–5 and 161–2) in a section entitled “Beautifying the Beast.” In our most extensive description of a sacrifice from Homer (Ody. 3.418–63), Nestor had the horns of the victim gilded, ἵν ̓ ἄγαλμα θεὰ κεχάροιτο ἰδοῦσα (3.436–8).32 Every word here is important: the goddess “sees” the victim, it is an ἄγαλμα, a thing of beauty, and therefore she feels charis, probably here plea-sure and a sense of obligation to those who render her this charis.33So, too, after the killing, when the animal is butchered, in the inspection for omens.

The carcass of a slaughtered cow might not look beautiful to us, but then there are not many butchers among us and we are not used to rummaging through a dead animal’s entrails, as the Greeks were, for good omens about important matters.The Athenians also honored those who made their heortai, the Panathenaia, the City Dionysia, and their associated pannychides and agones ὡς κάλλιστα.34 Individuals were also to participate in pompai or agones καλῶς καὶ εὐσχημόνως, and the first adverb may well share the esthetic element of the second.35 In terms of esthetics of such activities, i.e., the visual appearance of them, we should recall that Socrates and his companions in the opening of the Republic (1.327a1–5) talk of going to the pannychis of Bendis in Piraeus in order to “see” it (θεασόμεθα), and for Socrates the pompe of the locals was καλή. We owe to Xenophon’s Hipparchos a useful Athenian description of pompai, and there the esthetic element is emphasized. The pompai are to be κάλλισται, “worth seeing” (ἀξιοθέατοι), and performed κάλλιστα.36 “What is pleasurable (ἡδέα) to see in a mounted horse is to be displayed to the gods and humans,” and the pompai are to be most “charis-creating (κεχαρισμενωτάτας) for both the gods and spectators. Xenophon wants things in pompai to be ἀγαθά, καλά, and ἡδέα for the spectators (2.1 and 3.1–5). Several individuals contributed to the κόσμος and beauty of the pompai. The demarchs “marshalled” (διεκόσμουν) the Panathenaia, probably meaning that each demarch marshalled his fel-low demesmen, as the strategoi did the infantry and the hipparchs did the cavalry.37 Lycurgus provided new κόσμος, gold jewelry, for one-hundred kane-phoroi, themselves beautiful young women.38 Dicaeopolis had his daughter serve as kanephoros for his little pompe in Aristophanes, Acharnians 253–4, 34 See Chaniotis, 2013.38.

The prizes in the agones could also be καλὰ καὶ εὐσχήμονα (IG II2 957.5–6).36 On this aspect of pompai, see Chaniotis, 2013.34–9 and 1995.158–9 and Kavoulaki, 1999.299–301.37 On this for the Panathenaia, see Shear, 2001.125–9.38 Shear, 2001.130–2 and Mikalson, 1998.28–9. Ischomachus’ wife also had special κόσμος for heortai (Xen. Oec. 9.6)."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"258CHAPTER 13and he bid her, ἄγ ̓, ὦ θύγατερ, ὅπως τὸ κανοῦν καλὴ καλῶς οἴσεις (“Come, daugh-ter, be sure that you, beautiful, carry the basket beautifully”). Not only was she beautiful, but she was to perform her role καλῶς, and one can imagine many Athenian fathers giving the same advice to their daughters before a heorte.39 The thallophoroi, the “carriers of the olive branches,” were to be not just οἱ γέροντες, but οἱ καλοὶ γέροντες.40 All, even the old men, contributed to the κόσμος and beauty of the pompai.Many contributed also to the agones of the heortai. λαμπρῶς (“in a shining way,” “splendidly”) is the adverb often praising the activities of choregoi,41 and it is they who provided the masks, costumes, and scenery for their productions. Demosthenes as choregos himself was outfitted splendidly, with a gold crown and a special robe.42 The ephebes were praised for competing εὐσχημόνως in their races.43 Isocrates (4.44–5), in his usual way, waxes lyrical over the value of such athletic agones: “When the Greeks gather together, it is possible for some to show off their good fortunes and for others to see them competing against one another, and neither group is disheartened. Each has that at which they may feel φιλοτιμία, the one group when they ‘see’ the athletes laboring for them, the other when they realize that all have come to ‘see’ them.” And Athens, he claims, has the most and most beautiful spectacles (θεάματα πλεῖστα καὶ κάλλιστα). Finally, Xenophon in the Oeconomicus (7.9) has Socrates speak of an athletic or equestrian agon that is κάλλιστος, just as Phaedrus as agonothetes intended over 100 years later that the agones he supervised be “as beautiful as possible” (ὡς κάλλιστοι).44One major purpose of expeditions to foreign heortai was “sightseeings,” as their name, theoriai, indicates.45 Aristotle (Protrepticus, frag. 12 [Ross]) claims that “we go abroad to Olympia for the spectacle itself (αὐτῆς ἕνεκα 39 On this scene, see Chaniotis, 2013.21.40 Xen.

Thuc. 6.16.3. In the Rhetoric to Alexander (2.5) λαμπρῶς is linked directly to the spectacle (πρὸς τὸ θεωρεῖσθαι). On λαμπρός see Davies, 1981.98–100. It may be used of the person as in Dem. 21.159 or, more commonly, adverbially of the action done. The word is not used of the choregia or other religious activities in the inscriptions.42 Wilson, 2000.86–9 and 97–8.43 SEG 15.104.12–13, 23, and 131.44 IG II2 682.54–6 of 276/5.45 Rutherford (2013) now provides a full and rich study of theoriai from their earliest Greek to latest Roman times, including the importance of “viewing” and “sightseeing” in them (esp. 4–6, 51–5, and 142–55). On the various Athenian theoriai see especially 304–23. In prose sources the “viewing” is central to the experience of agones of all types. See, e.g.,"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":" 259Social And Esthetic Dimensions Of Religious Actionsτῆς θέας), even if there will be nothing more from it. For the viewing (θεωρία) itself is better than lots of money.” So, too, he says of the Dionysia. Xenophon (Hiero. 1.11) talks of going to the Panhellenic heortai, “where all things which seem to be most worth seeing (ἀξιοθεατότατα) are collected together.” Among the things “worth seeing” and “worth hearing” for Xenophon were cho-ruses: “when each chorus member does a random move, confusion appears and it is unpleasant (ἀτερπές) to watch, but when they move and speak in an orderly way, these same chorus members seem to be “worth seeing and worth hearing.”46 Xenophon seems almost to provide commentary on Plutarch’s (Nic. 3.4–5) description of the theoria led to Delos by Nicias, prob-ably in 421 or 417:The choruses which the cities used to send to sing to the god landed (on Delos) in a chance way, and immediately a crowd met the ship, and the choruses were bidden to sing in no κόσμος, but in their haste disem-barked in a disorderly way and at the same time put on their crowns and changed clothes. Nicias, when he was leading his theoria, landed at Rheneia (a closely adjoining island) with the chorus, the sacrificial animals, and the rest of the gear. He also brought a bridge which had been made in Athens of just the right size and adorned (κεκοσμημένον) splendidly with gildings, dyed coverings, garlands, and tapestries. During the night he bridged the small passage between Rheneia and Delos. Then, at daybreak, he disembarked, leading across the chorus that was expen-sively adorned (κεκοσμημένον) and singing.47And the Delphians praised the Athenian technitai of Dionysus who partici-pated in the Pythaïs of 98/7 because they “adorned” or “marshalled” (or both) (ἐπεκόσμησαν) the pompe καλῶς καὶ ἀξίω[ς τ]οῦ θεοῦ καὶ τᾶς πατρίδος τᾶς ἰδίας (FD 3.2.48.10).For a summary statement we may turn again to the Rhetoric to Alexander (2.5) where Anaximenes suggests that one can argue for greater expenditures in religious matters ἐκ τοῦ καλοῦ. The example he gives is the “splendor” of Hdt. 8.26.2, Lysias 33.2, Xen., Smp. 1.2 and Lac. 4.2, Isoc. 4.44–5, Pl. Lg. 2.657d, and Philoch. FGrHist 328 F 171.46 Oec. 8.3. Cf. Ve c t. 5.4, where Xenophon speaks of those who desire ἱερά that are ἀξιοθέατα.47 On this event and Plutarch’s description of it, see Rutherford, 2013.54.

He distin-guishes between the “beauty” and the “pleasure,” which result from the “spec-tacle,” but both are there. τὰ ἱερά are expected to be splendid, beautiful, and pleasurable.Xenophon praises the “limitless stone” in Attica, the “stone” from which come “most beautiful temples, most beautiful altars, and most outstanding statues for gods (κάλλιστοι μὲν ναοί, κάλλιστοι δὲ βωμοὶ γίγνονται, εὐπρεπέστατα δὲ θεοῖς ἀγάλματα) (Ve c t. 1.4).48 Apollo at Delphi had a temple which was κάλλιστος and μέγιστος (Dem. 25.34). About 432 the Athenians took various measures to make the sanctuary of Delian Apollo at Phaleron ὁς κάλλιστον.49 The siting of temples and altars was also felt to have an esthetic element. In Xenophon (Mem. 3.8.10) the “place” is to be “most distinctive” (πρεπωδεστάτην) and “vis-ible” (ἐμφανεστάτη) because it is “pleasant” (ἡδύ) to pray after seeing them.50 Athenians are praised for “adorning” (ἐπικόσμησις and cognates) a sanctuary, and the purpose would be, obviously, to make them beautiful. So at the end of the second century BC Sosandrus was commended for his contributions to the “adornment” of sanctuaries, which he did, “offering no excuses, lacking noth-ing of eagerness or φιλοτιμία.”51 About 325 the Eumolpidae honor an individ-ual who “adorned” the sanctuary of Plouton [κα]λῶς.52 One may also “adorn” an altar or temple or statue in the sanctuary. The earth itself, Xenophon says, provides things (i.e., plants and flowers) with which humans adorn (κοσμοῦσι) altars and statues (Oec. 5.3). Every year, probably, the Athenians contracted out the adornment of the altar of Zeus Soter.53 Neoptolemus gilded the altar of Apollo, and the adornment (κόσμησις) of the altar may have been a regu-lar part of the Panathenaia and probably of all major sacrifices.54 The family of the priestess of Aphrodite Pandemos adorned their temple with statues of 48 ὁς κάλλιστα is associated with construction, perhaps of the temple of Athena Nike, IG I3 64.16 and 22 on which see Mark, 1993, esp. 139–41.

Hyperides 4.24–5 of ca. 330–324 describes how the Athenians, at the oracular request of Zeus of Dodona, “adorned” the statue of Dione there: “Having made the face and all the other related elements as beautiful as possible (ὡς οἷόν τε κάλλιστον) and having prepared much expensive decoration (κόσμον) for the goddess . . ., you ‘adorned’ (ἐπεκοσμήσατε) the statue of Dione in a manner worthy of your-selves and of the goddess.” With his dedication of 375–350 Dionysius adorns (κοσμεῖ) the hero Kallistephanos and the hero’s children, and in 278/7 mem-bers honored their fellow thiasotai who adorned their goddess.59Demosthenes (22.76 and [24].184) speaks of τὸ κάλλος of the dedications in Athens, and the κάλλος of those dedications is an “immortal possession.”60 Lycurgus provided “adornment” for Athena Polias: he restored solid gold Nikai and had made gold and silver processional vessels, and the gold jewelry for the 100 girl kanephoroi.61 One nomos of ca. 335, proposed by Lycurgus, established various forms of new κόσμος for a number of deities, including Zeus Soter, Demeter and Kore, Zeus Olympios, Dionysus, Athena Itonia, Agathe Tyche, Amphiaraus, Asclepius, and Artemis Brauronia. One could also make exist-ing dedications more beautiful. In the same text the Athenians voted to ask the oracle if they should make the “adornments” (κόσμους) sacred to Artemis of Brauron “larger and more beautiful (μείζους καὶ καλλίους) or leave them as they are now.”62 Dedications also needed to be repaired or remade, no doubt to make them or the resulting objects “beautiful.” In 220/19 the priest of the Heros Iatros asked the Boule to melt down various old dedications in his sanctuary 55 IG II2 4596 = CEG #775 and IG II2 1325.21–2.56 Keesling, 2003.10, 108–9, and 199, Wyse, 1904.468, and LSJ, s.v.

II.148e6–7 we have the Athenian claim that, “We have ‘adorned (κεκοσμήκαμεν) the sanctuaries of the gods with dedications as no others have done,’ ”65 and Dem. 22.13 speaks of the φιλοτιμία which the Athenians felt at the sanctuaries their ancestors had “adorned” from the spoils of the Persians. The sanctuaries and dedications, in turn, “adorned” the city. Isocrates (15.234) makes the remarkable claim that “Pericles so ‘adorned’ the city with sanctuar-ies and dedications and all the other things that even now those who come to the city think that it deserves to rule not only the Greeks but all others.”66 And, in more Machiavellian terms, an oligarchy can, according to Aristotle (Pol. 6.1321a37–9) maintain political control if, among other things, the Demos sees its polis “adorned” (κοσμούμενην) with dedications and buildings.67εὐκοσμία shares all the denotations and connotations of κόσμος and indicates a desirable state of κόσμος. Given the close link between κόσμος and beauty and the concerns for the beauty of some religious activities we have seen, some praises of εὐκοσμία in our texts may have an esthetic element. The εὐκοσμία of the ephebes, for example, usually involves pompai, those who showed it in the pompai and in their entrances into the theater, or those who showed it in escorting Pallas to Phaleron and back.68 εὐκοσμία was also a desideratum for sanctuaries, and officials who provided it were honored: epimeletai for the the-ater of Dionysus, a priest of Asclepius for Dionysus’ temple, taxiarchs in times of trouble for the Demeter sanctuary at Eleusis, and epimeletai of orgeones for the sanctuary of their deity.69 So, too, the Boule was once honored for 63 IG II3 1154.33–4 and 43–5.

And, as we saw before, in praises of religious action καλῶς is almost always there, and almost always first.71 The esthetic dimension is almost always explicitly praised. Sacrifices, sacrificial victims, heortai, pompai, pannychides, agones, sanctuaries, altars, temples, and dedications were all “to look beautiful.”Finally, we saw earlier what was considered by Athenians ἄξιον τῶν θεῶν. ἀξίως τῆς θεᾶς (θεοῦ) is used of the performance of priestly offices, of the adornment of a statue, the holding of a Pythaïs and a pannychis, and in pri-vate cults of the performance of epimeletai, of a pompe, and of construction in a sanctuary.72 ἄξιον τοῦ θεοῦ describes a building project in the sanctuary of Ammon that is also καλόν, and so, too, a bull that the ephebes in 122/1 sent for the Dionysia.73 We saw earlier how the Athenians adorned the statue of Dione in Dodona “worthily of the goddess.” They made her face “as beautiful as possible.”74 In literary texts phrases such as ἀξίως τῶν θεῶν are non-Athenian, rare, and late, but not much later than some of our inscriptions. There they are used exclusively of things that are “beautiful”: flowery meadows, gardens, buildings, and Ganymede.75 What is ἄξιον τῶν θεῶν, with few exceptions, is so because it is καλόν.76 From this, we can perhaps venture a bolder conclusion, 70 IG II3 306.22–3.71 See Chapter 1.72 See Chapter 1.73 IG II2 1282.7–8 of 263/2 and Perrin-Saminadayar, 2007.206–12, T26.13 of 122/1.74 Hyp. 4.24–6.75 Diod.

He says to the clerk of the court, “Read out for me the things from the oracle of Delphi that was brought from the god so that you, (the jurors), may hear that it says the same things about the relatives as the laws of Solon” (66). There follows a document inserted into the text, purport-ing to be that oracle.1 After the reading of the oracle, the speaker continues, “You hear, jurymen, that Solon in his laws and the god in his oracle say the same things, bidding the relatives to perform (the rites)2 for the dead on the appropriate days” (67). The speaker’s introduction and summary of the oracle lead us to expect a prescription for relatives to bury their dead on certain days, as previously described in the laws of Solon (62–3). What we have, instead, is this text (66):Oracle I3̓Αγαθῇ τύχῃ. ἐπερωτᾷ ὁ δῆμος ὁ ̓Αθηναίων περὶ τοῦ σημείου τοῦ ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ γενομένου, ὅ τι ἂν δρῶσιν ̓Αθηναίοις ἢ ὅτῳ θεῷ θύουσιν ἢ εὐχομένοις εἴη ἐπὶ τὸ ἄμεινον ἀπὸ τοῦ σημείου. συμφέρει ̓Αθηναίοις περὶ τοῦ σημείου τοῦ ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ γενομένου θύοντας καλλιερεῖν Διὶ ὑπάτῳ, ̓Αθηνᾷ ὑπάτῃ, ̔Ηρακλεῖ, ̓Απόλλωνι σωτῆρι, καὶ ἀποπέμπειν ̓Αμφιόνεσσι·περὶ τύχας ἀγαθᾶς ̓Απόλλωνι ̓Αγυιεῖ, Λατο͂ι, ̓Αρτέμιδι, καὶ τὰς ἀγυιὰς κνισῆν, καὶ κρατῆρας ἱστάμεν καὶ 1 Canevaro and Harris (2012) examine forged nomoi and psephismata in Andocides 1, and the methodology they outline in pp. 98–100 for identifying forgeries is that which I have used in this Appendix.

It is beneficial for the Athenians concerning the sign that occurred in the sky to sacrifice with favorable omens to Zeus Hypatos, Athena Hypata, Heracles, Apollo Soter, and to send to the Amphiones.

Demosthenes 21In his prosecution of Meidias for assaulting him when he was a choregos at the City Dionysia, Demosthenes wishes the jurors to consider Meidias’ act as ἀσέβεια as well as ὕβρις, and to support his claim he introduces oracles: “for you know, I suppose, that you make all these choruses and hymns for the god not only according to the laws about the Dionysia but also according to the oracles, in all of which you will find the response, similarly from Delphi and Dodona, to establish the choruses (χοροὺς ἱστάναι) κατὰ τὰ πάτρια and to fill the streets with the savor of sacrifices (κνισᾶν ἀγυίας) and to wear crowns (στεφανοφορεῖν)” (51). Demosthenes then has the oracles read, and concludes as follows: “There are, Athenian men, both these and many other oracles for the city, good ones. What then from these things ought you to think? That they order us to sacri-fice the other sacrifices to the gods appearing in each oracle, but they respond to you in addition to establish choruses and wear crowns κατὰ τὰ πάτρια in 4 On “patron hero” for ἥρῳ ἀρχαγέτᾳ, see Kearns, 1989.150.5 Again, one would expect τὰ νομιζόμενα.

The latter point suggests also that here κατὰ τὰ πάτρια should be taken with the preceding clause, not the following one, and should be the Doric καττὰ πάτρια (as Dilts has it).

Δημότῃ for the manuscript’s and Dilts’ δημοτελῆ, an adjective not appropriate in this context. Δημότῃ may not be correct either, but we would expect some epithet of Dionysus, both in general and because every other deity in the oracle has an epithet. Secondly, Dilts obviously mistakenly included the phrase ̓Απόλλωνι ̓Αποτροπαίῳ βοῦν θῦσαι in its original position after he had moved it (as MacDowell had, see below) to later in the oracle. I leave it in its original position.10 On Dionysus Demotes here, see Parker, 1996.5 n. 17."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":" 271The Oracles Of Demosthenes 43 And 21MacDowell (1990), to whose commentary and textual work on the oracles in Dem. 21 (Against Meidias) we owe much, considers the four oracles from that speech (II–V), though the most textually corrupt passages of the speech, genuine and, perhaps, relevant to the speech: “Presumably the texts in 52–3 come from a collection, kept in Athens, of oracles received by the Athenian people. They are not all closely relevant to D.’s argument, but perhaps they are the most relevant that could be found. The fact that they are only marginally relevant helps to reassure us that the texts are genuine, since a forger invent-ing oracles for this speech would have composed texts which fitted the speech more exactly; but it is possible that whoever put the documents into Meidias after D.’s death has selected the wrong oracles from the collection, not the ones that D. actually intended to be read here” (p. 270). For our purposes the impor-tant point is that MacDowell considers the oracles genuine and Athenian. Regarding the Delphic oracles, Fontenrose (1978), generally skeptical, put ora-cles I, II, and III into his “historical” category, with I as H29 and II and III as one or perhaps two oracles (H28), but with reservations about II to be noted below. Parke and Wormell (1956, vol. II, #282 and 283) treat I, II, and III at face value. And, most recently, Parker (2005.108) seems to accept Oracle I as genu-ine, and Bowden (2005.118, 123–4) raises no question about the authenticity of I, II, and III. Parke later (1967.84), writing in general of oracles inserted into Demosthenic speeches, suggests some caution: “The general opinion tends to the more cautious view that they are not authentic originals, but were com-posed and inserted by ancient editors of the speeches, exempli gratia, so as to fill out the gaps where the original documents were cited at the trial. But even if this view is accepted, it would be generally agreed that scholars who composed them did their work excellently. If they were dealing with decrees and other legal documents, they knew the correct formulae, and there is no reason to suppose that they were less well informed on religious texts.”11 I will agree that the oracular texts were inserted by later editors, but for several of the oracles discussed here I doubt whether we can say the editors “did their work excellently” and were well informed on religious texts.1211 But Parke later in this book, as in 1956, goes on to treat these Delphic oracles as if they were genuine.12 I generally agree with Harris (2008.105 n. 106) who writes of Oracles II, III, IV, and V that “the texts of these oracles are forgeries composed in the late Hellenistic or Roman period. About IV, though, I am uncertain. It may just be misplaced."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"272Appendix 1Oracle I (Dem. 43.66)13Despite the widespread acceptance of this oracle as genuine, the problems are numerous and decisive against it,14 the first being that only the last sen-tence offers the response that the speaker first asked for and then later summa-rized. The combination of sacrificing to the gods and performing burial rites for the dead in response to a sign is unparalleled and improbable. The last is clearly an awkward addendum, inserted to force this “oracle” to be relevant to this speech. The number of deities and others to be appeased as a result of one omen is also remarkable and unparalleled. And of those gods clearly iden-tified by epithet, Athena Hypata and Apollo Soter are unattested in Athens.15 “Setting up craters and dances” is appropriate only for Dionysus, and is clearly borrowed from a text concerning his heortai, not concerning a sacrifice in response to a sign. This whole oracle is at best a pastiche of oracular phrases, individual ones which we can isolate by dialect. The prescriptions concerning the sign in the sky are in Attic / Ionic; the next provision, περὶ τύχας ἀγαθᾶς, is in Doric; the next, concerning the Olympian gods, is in Attic / Ionic; and the last two, concerning the ἀρχαγέτᾳ ἥρῳ and the dead, are in Doric. Each, in all probability, is from a separate oracle. This is surely not one genuine oracle, and 13 On which see Parke and Wormell, 1956, #283; Fontenrose, 1978.H29; and Bowden, 2005.118–19.14 For Zeus Hypatos in Athens, see Graf, 1985.202–3. Athena Hypata appears on a late ded-ication from Epidaurus (IG IV2 1.148) and elsewhere only in a Delphic oracle ordering sacrifices for the residents of Kallatis in Thrace in II BC (SEG 45.911. B II.9). There Zeus Hypatos has been restored (B II.8) to form a pair with Athena. Apollo Soter appears on a similar dedication from Epidaurus (IG IV2 1.149), and only there. The problem raised by Bowden (2005.118–19) concerning the identity of the “founding hero,” or better, “patron hero” (See p. 115 above) is chimerical. He posits Erechtheus and Theseus, and claims “they do not really fit the oracle’s words.” But Erechtheus certainly can be considered a ἥρως ἀρχηγέτης of Athens. See Oracle II. Erechtheus, as one of the ten tribal heroes, was both ἀρχηγέτης (Ath. Pol. 21.6 and Ar., frag. 126) and eponymous, excep-tional by being eponymous for both his tribe members and, as here, for the Athenians in general as the Erechtheidae. See Kearns, 1989.160.15 Bowden, after discussing the “founding hero,” notes that “none of the other gods listed were particularly significant to Athenians, and all of this suggests the possibility that the Pythia herself was responsible for suggesting the gods to be prayed to, rather than agree-ing a list offered to her: her response, although it apparently might vary somewhat from response to response, was perhaps not always well tailored to the particular consulting city.” (118–19). This explanation is not really satisfactory, because what good would an ora-cle be to Athenians if it ordered them to sacrifice to gods whose cults they did not have? A sacrifice requires an altar, and no cult is attested for Zeus Hypatos, Athena Hypata, or Apollo Soter in Athens."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":" 273The Oracles Of Demosthenes 43 And 21some clauses in it may not even concern Athens. We cannot use it for deter-mining Delphi’s influence on Athenian religious affairs.The recognition that this oracle consists of various unrelated phrases explains some anomalies: that such a large number of such varied deities are linked to just one celestial sign; that funeral rites for the dead are linked to sac-rifices to deities and a hero; and that the establishment of a heorte of Dionysus is linked in this way to simple sacrifices to other deities. None of this makes sense in terms of Athenian religious traditions, and happily the evidence for it can now be discarded.Oracle II (Dem. 21.52)16There is little on the surface that is problematic about this oracle, apart from its immediate relevance to the speaker’s argument which concerns choruses and choregoi, neither mentioned in the text. The text seems to be initiating a Dionysiac harvest heorte, more like the Rural Dionysia (“in the streets”) than the City Dionysia that is Demosthenes’ concern.17 Directly relevant to the con-text, however, is the wearing of crowns, emphasized in the speech. Fontenrose (1978) includes it among his “historical” oracles (H28) in his “Catalogue of Delphic Responses,” but in his text (187–8, 193–4) he raises the following ques-tions about it. “It is colorless and hardly typical.” “Of seven Historical verse oracles, six are very late, spoken between about AD 100 and 300. . . . Only H28 is early, supposedly spoken in the fourth century BC” And, most importantly, “It is strange that a fourth-century response instructs the Athenians to offer fruits and make sacrifices on altars to Dionysus.” “H28 may be the composition that purported to be (emphasis mine) the divine order directing the introduc-tion of Dionysus’ cult to Athens.” MacDowell (1990.271) thinks it “instructs the Athenians to hold an extraordinary festival for Dionysus in thanksgiving for the harvest.” A single, extraordinary heorte to celebrate one harvest is, I think, unparalleled and unlikely.Oracle III (Dem. 21.52)18This is another version of Oracle I and subject to many of the same criti-cisms. But now, instead of a response to a celestial sign (Oracle I), the pur-pose is to attain health. Athena Hypata, and the Amphiones have disappeared. 16 See Parke and Wormell, 1956, vol. 1, 337–8 and vol. 2, #282; Parke, 1967.84–5; Fontenrose, 1978.H28; MacDowell, 1990.271; Bowden, 2005.123–4; and Harris, 2008.105 n. 106.17 As noted also by MacDowell, 1990.271.18 Parke and Wormell, 1956, #282; Parke, 1967.84–5; Fontenrose, 1978.H28; Bowden, 2005.123–4; and Harris, 2008.105 n. 106."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"274Appendix 1Apollo Prostaterios is substituted for Apollo Soter, certainly, as we have seen, an Athenian deity but receiving sacrifices only from the prytaneis and only after 273/2.19 There is no other evidence, however, that he is associated with health, except that sacrifices to him—as to many other gods in this period—were made “for the health and safety of the Boule and Demos.” The craters and dances clearly refer to Dionysiac heortai, but the god, oddly, is not named, and the phrasing in the manuscript suggests that the author intends these to be for “all the Olympian gods and goddesses,”20 whereas in Oracle I they can be attributed to Dionysus. Dilts (2005) and MacDowell (1990.272) attempt to solve this anomaly by inserting καί after στεφανοφορεῖν and deleting it before μνησιδωρεῖν, thereby leaving the craters, dances, and crown-wearing for an unnamed Dionysus and the μνησιδωρεῖν for the Olympians.21 This oracle has the same clauses in the same dialects as Oracle I. As to relevance to the speech, MacDowell (271) claims, “It does not pertain to the Dionysia, but it has a general relevance to D.’s case insofar as it shows that choruses have divine authority.” This is not sufficient. This oracle has no value or use beyond that of Oracle I.Oracle IV (Dem. 21.53)22This oracle has no relation to the subject of the speech.23 It is rather Dodona’s response to an Athenian failure to send a timely sacrifice and theoria to a Dodonian heorte. The deities, sacrificial animals, and dedication all suit a genuine occasion and oracle.24Oracle V (Dem. 21.53)25This second oracle from Dodona looks to be another pastiche.

For you our ἐπιμέλεια has been towards what is necessary. For we sacrificed to Zeus Soter and Athena and Nike, and these sacrificial victims have been καλὰ καὶ σωτήρια for you. And we sacrificed also to Peitho and the Mother of the Gods and Apollo, and were sacrificing also these (victims) with good omens. And for you also the victims sacrificed to the other gods were ἀσφαλῆ and βέβαια and καλὰ καὶ σωτήρια. Therefore accept τὰ ἀγαθά from the gods giving them.A search in the prose and poetic texts of the classical and Hellenistic periods for the phrases, common in our epigraphical texts, καλὰ καὶ σωτήρια and τὰ πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς εὐσεβῶς ἕξει leads only to this one Demosthenic prooemium.1 The question is whether we can use this text to understand better the meaning of these and similar phrases in our inscriptions, that is, whether it is a reliable source for religious conceptions and practices of the period it purports to be, i.e., during the lifetime of Demosthenes. There are a number of anomalies. Of the fifty-six Demosthenic prooemia2 only this one and #55 are, as Rupprecht 1 We are fortunate that his study of Theophrastus, Char. 21 has led J. Diggle (2004.23–5, 413–16) to look closely at this prooemium, and as usual he has much of value to offer. He does not, however, question this as a genuine text of the Demosthenic period, and in that and in the translation of some phrases, we differ.2 As usually numbered.

The idea of ἱερὰ ἀσφαλῆ is to be found elsewhere only once, referring to a time when the τὰ ἱερά might have been in physical danger while crossing a river.5 ἱερὰ βέβαια is unparalleled, and it is difficult to imagine what is intended. If the list of deities is accurate, it would be a welcome addition to the deities receiving sacrifices from the prytaneis. The Athena would probably be Athena Soteira, often paired with Zeus Soter.6 Apart from here, an Athenian Nike as an independent deity is mentioned only in the problematical Themistocles Decree (M&L #23.39),7 and otherwise there is no indication of a cult for her in Athens which had, of course, its own Athena Nike. The Mother of the Gods is appropriate because we know the prytaneis sacrificed at her heorte, the Galaxia.8 It is surprising in light of the epigraphical texts that Apollo has no epithet.9 It is also surprising to find in such company Peitho by herself, with-out the Aphrodite Pandemos to whom she seems a subsidiary in Athenian cult (Paus. 1.22.3).10 Finally, the addition of ἐκ τῶν θεῶν διδόντων to the formulaic δέχεσθε τὰ ἀγαθά looks to be a misunderstanding of the meaning of τὰ ἀγαθά in the formula (i.e., that τὰ ἱερά were καλὰ καὶ σωτήρια),11 confusing it with τὰ ἀγαθά as “the good things sent by the gods.”123 As noted also by Worthington, 2004.134. Yunis (1996) in his valuable study of Demosthenic prooemia recognizes the uniqueness of Prooemium 54 but still attributes it with all the others to Demosthenes: “it looks authentic in diction and function and its presence in the collection weighs in favor of Demosthenic authorship” (p. 259). Yunis says of Demosthenic prooemia in general, “no imitator, no matter how good or close to Demosthenes, could perfectly imitate Demosthenes in style and substance while excluding all inappropriate or anachronistic elements” (p. 261). That may be true of the other fifty-five prooemia, but Prooemium 54, I think, introduces “inappropriate” elements. See also Wilamowitz, 1893.II.401–2 and Rupprecht, 1927.398–9.4 In one instance (Antiphon 6.45), though, one who sacrificed for the prytany may have designated himself a hieropoios, and so the dichotomy may be false.5 I.

They also sacrificed, once a year, to Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira, but not in the same prytany as the sac-rifice to the Mother of the Gods, as the text would require it.

On this see Mikalson, 2010.6–7 and 11–12. Van Straten then speaks of “holy rites,” and by that apparently means that the ἱερά are the rituals of sacrifice. From the arguments in Chapter 4, I think he is mistaken. θυσίαι refers to the acts of sacrifice, ἱερά in these contexts and espe-cially in τὰ ἱερὰ καλά refers to the sacrificed animals.The uncertainty over the meaning of τὰ ἱερά in τὰ ἱερὰ καλά is also endemic in the translation and explication of the literary sources. The currently favored translation is “the omens were favorable” as in Brownson and Dillery (1998) for An. 4.3.9. Cf. 2.2.3;1 for Hdt. 9.36 in Strassler, 2007; and in Strassler, 2009 for Xen. HG 4.2.18 and 7.2.21. For Aristophanes Av. 1118, Sommerstein, 1987, (ad loc.) translates the phrase as “our sacrifice has been successful,” but inter-prets it to mean that “the omens . . . have been favourable.” Cf. Dunbar, 1995, ad loc. A similar phrase occurs in Thucydides (4.92.7), πιστεύσαντας . . . τοῖς ἱεροῖς ἃ ἡμῖν θυσαμένοις καλὰ φαίνεται, which Hornblower (1991–2008, ad loc.), in a long discussion, explains as “hiera in the narrow sense, the leisurely sacri-ficing and burning of the victim and then examination of the innards, perhaps in camp or on the march.” He takes, apparently, ἱερά to be the act of sacrifice. And, so, are τὰ ἱερά the “victims,” the “sacrifices,” or the “omens,” all three of which LSJ s. v. ἱερός proposes and translators use?I would argue that not only in the phrase τὰ ἱερὰ καλά but also in most sac-rificial contexts τὰ ἱερά are the “sacrificial victims.” As examples, in the fol-lowing passages ἱερά are commonly taken as “sacrifices” or “omens,” but can just as easily, and more consistently, be taken to mean “sacrificial victims” as they are in the epigraphical texts: Hdt. 1.59.1, 5.44.2, 8.54, and 9.36; Ar. Av. 1118; S. Ph. 1033; Xen. An. 2.2.3; Herodas 4.79–83; and Antiphon 5.83.2 “The omens 1 Implied also in Mikalson, 1998.43.2 Antiphon 6.83. The defendant here claims that, when he “attended” or “stood alongside” ἱεροῖς, κάλλιστα τὰ ἱερά ἐγένετο. This he takes to be evidence that the murder charge against him is false, and it is probably to strengthen his argument that he uses κάλλιστα, the super-lative uncommon in this phrase. The ἱρῶν of Hdt. 1.172.2 are “sanctuaries” (pace Purvis), as would seem to be those of A. Th. 1010 (pace LSJ). In Hdt. 2.63.1 ἱρά are distinguished from sacrifices (θυσίας) and may be “sacred rituals” of some type."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"280Appendix 3were favorable” should be viewed more as an interpretation than as a transla-tion. The full statement would be, “the victims were καλά, and therefore the omens were favorable.” For Greeks the second statement would be the obvious conclusion from the first and would not need to be expressed.For Homer, too, it is most likely that ἱερά and καλὰ ἱερά linked to the verb ῥέζειν and some other verbs in a sacrificial context are the “sacrificial animals,” not “sacrifices.” Lines such as Il. 11.727–9,ἔνθα Διὶ ῥέ́ξαντες ὑπερμενεῖ ἱερὰ καλά,ταῦρον δ ̓ ̓Αλφειῷ, ταῦρον δὲ Ποσειδάωνι,αὐτὰρ ̓Αθηναίῃ γλαυκώπιδι βοῦν ἀγελαίην.alone indicate that,3 and ῥέζειν itself can bear the “sacrifice” meaning, as in Il. 10.292, σοὶ δ’ αὖ ἐγὼ ῥέξω βοῦν. So, I would claim, in Homer, too, ἱερά and καλὰ ἱερά in their many occurrences, should be rendered “sacrificial animals” and “beautiful sacrificial animals.”4 σφάγια καλάHornblower (ibid.) describes σφάγια in much the same way as he does ἱερά, as sacrificial acts. On Thuc. 6.69.2, though, he has them as “victims.” We have in Xen. An. 1.8.15 τὰ ἱερὰ καλὰ καὶ τὰ σφάγια καλά, in Hdt. 6.112.1 τὰ σφάγια . . . καλά (Cf. A. Th. 379), in 9.61.3 τὰ σφάγια χρηστά (cf. τὰ ἱερὰ . . . χρηστά in Hdt. 5.44.2), and in 9.45.2 a nice variant, τὰ σφάγια . . . καταθύμια. The parallels with τὰ ἱερά suggest, given the previous discussions, that τὰ σφάγια are “sacrificial victims,” either of different types or for different purposes from τὰ ἱερά. As such σφάγια gives an additional connotation and touch of pathos to passages such as Eur. Hec. 108–9 and 118–19, Ion 278, Or. 658, 815, and 842, and [Dem.] 60.29. As for ἱερά, virtually all the instances of σφάγια can reasonably be understood as “sacrificial victims” of one type, and none needs refer to the act of sacri-fice. If we are correct, in these contexts both ἱερά and σφάγια are the sacrificial victims. It is they which are καλά.53 Cf. Ody. 3.5–6, 5.102, 11.130–1, and 23.277–80.4 Il. 1.147, 23.195 and 209 and Ody. 1.61, 4.473, and 7.191.5 On σφάγια as victims slaughtered but then not consumed by humans, as contrasted to ἱερά as we understand them, see Parker, 2005.154."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":" 281Ἱερὰ Καλά καλλιερεῖνκαλλιερεῖν is “to have one’s ἱερά καλά,” and in both inscriptions6 and literary texts7 is almost always distinguished from the act of sacrifice.8 In the inscrip-tions καλλιερεῖν is, as in the literary texts, used absolutely, with no direct object.9 The group being benefited (ὑπὲρ. . . .) is rarely specified (Agora 16.7.4–6, MDAI 66.228.4.4–6, IG II2 1030.17, and Xen. Hipp. 3.1). In Ath. Pol. 54.6–7 the hieropoioi are to καλλιερεῖν with the manteis. We have, fortunately, two brief descriptions of καλλιερεῖν which suggest why it is necessary to determine if τὰ ἱερά are καλά or not: in Hdt. 6.82.1, in a process of καλλιερεῖν, one is “to use the victims” (τοῖς ἱροῖσι χρήσηται) and learn εἴτε . . . ὁ θεὸς παραδιδοῖ εἴτε ἐμποδὼν ἕστηκε. In Xen. De Vect. 6.3 it is reasonable, καλλιερήσαντας, to begin a new activity, σὺν γὰρ θεῷ (τῶν ̓Αθηναίων) πραττομένων εἰκος ̀ καὶ τὰς πράξεις προιέναι ἐπὶ τὸ λῷον καὶ ἄμεινον ἀεὶ τῇ πόλει.10 To have καλὰ ἱερά in a sacrifice means essentially that one knows one will be working “with a god” and not “against a god,” that one’s actions will lead to what is λῷον καὶ ἄμεινον which is, of course, also the com-mon purpose of consulting an oracle.11If we are willing to look away from Athens but to a contemporary of many of our inscriptions (III BC), Herodas in his Fourth Mime (4.79–84) may offer a bit more insight into the thinking behind these texts:κάλ ̓ ὗμιν, ὦ γυναῖκες, ἐντελέως τὰ ἰράκαὶ ἐς λῶιον ἐμβλέποντα· μεζόνως οὔτις6 MDAI 66.228.4.4–5, Hesp.

Of its various examples, the following, however, easily allow the more usual human subject: Hdt. 6.76.1–2 (Cleomenes), 7.133 (Spartans), and 9.38 (Hegesistratus). Hdt. 9.19.5–7 is problematic and has properly led some editors to emend the text. In the passive the verb may be rendered as, “τὰ ἱερά prove καλα”́ (Xen. Lac. 13.3, Men., frag. 264.8 [OCT]). MacDowell, 1990.274, is mistaken in defining καλλιερεύειν as “ ‘to sacrifice well,’ avoiding any ill-omened acts or circumstances.”9 καλλιερεῖν has a direct object in Dem. 21.53 for which see Appendix 1, Oracle IV. Another possible case is Agora 16.7.4–6.10 Cf. Xen. Cyr. 6.4.12.11 Fontenrose, 1978.221–2. This somewhat contradicts Naiden’s (2013.110–11) claim that καλλιερεῖν did not give information about the future but was only an indication that the sacrifice was successful, i.e., was acceptable to the gods."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"282Appendix 3ἠρέσατο τὸν Παιήον ̓ ἤπερ οὖν ὑμεῖς.ἰὴ ἰὴ Παίηον, εὐμένης εἴηςκαλοῖς ἐπ ̓ ἱροῖς τῆισδε κεἴ τινες τῶνδεἔασι ὀπυιηταί τε καὶ γενῆς ἆσσον.For you, women, τὰ ἱερά are perfectly καλάAnd look towards what is better.

It is not found in real Athenian orations, but Isocrates employs it in a rhetorical moral essay (11.26 and 28), in an encomium imagined to be delivered at a heorte on Cyprus (9.51), and in a speech purported to be of Plataeans before the Athenian Ekklesia (14.22).3 The earliest example in Athenian inscriptions is from 129/8 where the ὁσιότης is directed to the gods ([τῆς π]ρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς ὁσιότητος), as it is in some roughly contemporary inscriptions from elsewhere in the Greek world.4 Philip V writes to the Athenians of Hephaestia ca. 200 about wishing to see their sanctuaries, διὰ τὴν πρὸ[ς] θεοὺς ὁσιότητα, and later refers to his εὐσέβεια[ν πρὸς] τοὺς κρείσσονας καὶ ὑ[περά]νω ἡμῶν θεούς.5 In the two other surviving examples of ὁσιότης on Athenian inscriptions from 1 Blok (2011) has much of value on ὅσιος but is mistaken, I think, in putting on the ὅσια of the antithetical pair ἱερὰ καὶ ὅσια all the religious connotations which ὅσιος itself might ever have. She follows Connor (1987) who also wrongly, I have argued (2010.205–6 n. 51), links ὅσια with “justice.”2 An interesting exception, one of those that helps prove the rule, is IG II2 8593 = CEG #533, a self-congratulating epitaph erected in Piraeus by a Heracleote for his mother: μητέρα ἔθηκα ὁσίως ὀσίαν, τοῖς πᾶσιν ἰδέσθαι, ἀνθ ̓ ὧν εὐλογίας καὶ ἐπαίνων ἄξιός εἰμι.3 Cf. 12.121.4 SEG 21.469C.8.

The curser adds a religious sanction to any legal one.16 ὅσιος vs. ἱερόςὅσιος means “religiously correct.”17 In IG I3 52.A16, the tamiai were to manage “the gods’ money.” In this same early inscription (434/3) the money itself is hιερά (“sacred,” “belonging to a deity”) (A29–30, B26). This prepares us for the distinction we later find between money, places, and things that are ἱερά or ὅσια, always in this order when the terms are paired.18 Money that is ὅσια belongs to the city and is available for its use.

It distinguishes between two fines: one is ὀσίαν, the other is [καθ(θ)υτὰν το͂ι Δὶ ̓Ολυνπίοι].25 Not on Athenian inscriptions, but at Tegea one could distinguish in this way between places: εἴτε ἰν ἱερο͂ι εἴτε ἰν ὁσίοι.26 Similarly a demesman at Athens in early III BC was praised for λέγων καὶ πράττων τὰ βέλτιστα ὑπέρ τε τῶν ἱερῶν καὶ τῶν ὁσίων.27 And, finally, at Labraunda and on Andros a new citizen got to share in καὶ ἱερῶν καὶ ὁσίων.28 It may be a matter of chance survivals, but it appears that this particular distinction between ἱερός and ὅσιος disappeared after III BC. ὁσίως καὶ δικαίωςThe pairing of ὁσίως and δικαίως occurs rather late, in II BC, especially in praise of those engaged in legal proceedings as judges or arbitrators.29 The applicabil-ity of δικαίως in such cases is obvious, that of ὁσίως less so.

Iasos 93.7–9).34 The gym-nasiarch in Beroea was to swear: “I shall serve as gymnasiarch in accordance with the gymnasiarch nomos, and in those matters which have not been writ-ten up in the nomos I will use my own opinion [ὁ]σι<ώ>τατα καὶ δικαιότατα as I am able.” (I. Beroia 1.26–9).35 Here, as possibly in all the above, the refer-ence to ὁσιότης may involve keeping the oath taken by the office holder. On decrees erected at Delphi the citizens of Lilaia twice ca. 208 praised soldiers of Attalus I who “made their stay καλῶς καὶ δικαίως καὶ ὁσίως,” i.e., they did not vio-late any civil or religious laws during their stay there (FD 3.4.133.5 and 134.3–4).Sometime in the years 120–100 Priene honored a fellow citizen, Moschion, son of Cydimus, for his many, long, and good religious and secular services to the state (I. Priene2 64). In the preface to this long (383 lines) decree is the fullest account of one man’s virtues, encompassing most of the terms we have been describing, including ὅσιος and δίκαιος, and indicating, as it were, their respective audiences (14–23):30 E.g., I.

A good life, indeed. In terms of the current discussion of the pairing of ὅσιος and δίκαιος, we conclude that both are concerned with humans, that ὅσιος indicates “religiously correct” behavior toward them and that δίκαιος indicates, probably, both legally and morally correct behavior.40The combination ὅσιος and δίκαιος may not occur on Athenian inscriptions or in deliberative oratory, but it was familiar to Athenians, at least in IV BC. Antiphon three times uses ὁσίως καὶ δικαίως in closing pleas for acquittals in his Tetralogies (1.4.12, 2.2.12, and 3.2.9). Xenophon (Ap. 5) has Socrates say, “For what is most pleasant, I know that I have lived my whole life ὁσίως καὶ δικαίως.”41 36 Μοσχίων Κυδίμου γεγονὼς ἀπὸ τῆς πρ[ώτης ἡλικίας ἀ]νὴρ κα[λ]ὸς καὶ ἀγαθὸς καὶ βεβιωκὼς εὐσ[εβῶς μὲ]ν πρὸς θεούς, ὁ[σ]ίως δὲ πρὸς τοὺς γονεῖς καὶ τοῦ[ς συμ]β[ι]οῦντας ἐν οἰκ[ε]ιότηιτι καὶ χρήσει καὶ τοὺς λοιπο[ὺς] πολίτας πάντας, δικαίως δὲ καὶ φιλοδόξως προσε[νην]εγμένος τῆι πατρίδι καὶ καταξίως τῆς τῶν πρ[ογόνων] ἀρετῆς τε καὶ δόξης, διαμαρ[τ]υρουμένην ἐσχηκ[ὼς διὰ πάν]τος τοῦ βίου τη�̀ν παρὰ τῶν θεῶν εὐμένεια[ν] κα[ὶ τὴν παρὰ τ]ῶν [σ]υμπολιτευομένων καὶ τῶν κατοικού[ντων εὔνοια]ν. . . .37 See, e.g., Graf, 1995.105 and extensive bibliography in I.

For Plato the individual who is ὅσιος καὶ δίκαιος has, given his understanding of these terms, the complete moral package,43 but I cite here only two passages as a conclusion to this topic. In the Gorgias (523a5–b2) Plato has Socrates say, “In the time of Cronus there was this nomos about humans, and it still even now exists among gods, that the one who has passed his life δικαίως and ὁσίως, when he dies, goes off to the islands of the blessed and dwells in all eudaimonia, free from evils.”44Finally, we conclude with Cephalus’ famous words to Socrates from the Republic (1.331a3–8), with a quote from Pindar: “In a charming way, Socrates, Pindar said this, that whoever lives his life δικαίως καὶ ὁσίως, ‘Sweet hope attends him, a nurse to his old age, nourishing his heart, the hope which espe-cially guides the much turning thought of mortals.’ ”45 εὐσέβεια καὶ ὁσιότης and CognatesAt home an Athenian could be praised for acting εὐσεβῶς. At Delphi he could be termed εὐσεβῶς καὶ ὁσίως διακείμενος.46 So, too, the Delphians described Attalus II in 160/59 and their benefactors in general.47 The pairing of εὐσέβεια 42 οἶδα γὰρ ἐμαυτὸν οὕτως ὁσίως καὶ δικαίως κεχρημένον αὐτοῖς καὶ περὶ τὴν πόλιν καὶ περὶ τοὺς προγόνους καὶ μάλιστα περὶ τοὺς θεούς, ὥστ ̓ εἴ τι μέλει τῶν ἀνθρωπίνων αὐτοῖς πραγμάτων, οὐδὲ τῶν νῦν περὶ ἐμὲ γιγνομένων οὐδὲν αὐτοὺς οἶμαι λανθάνειν.

One may be praised for acting εὐσεβῶς or εὐσεβῶς καὶ ὁσίως, but rarely ὁσίως alone. εὐσέβεια is clearly the dominant concern. The earliest (before 246) example of the pair is, again, from Egypt and the tech-nitai of Dionysus, followed by a response to the invitation to the Magnesian Leukophryena in 208/7.48 For the Delians Ptolemy VI was ὅσιος καὶ εὐσεβὴς καὶ πάντων ἀνθρώ[πων] ἡμερώτατος.49 In the Troad Hermias, priest of all the gods, πρ[ό]ς τε τοὺς θεοὺς ὁσίως καὶ εὐσεβῶς προσφέρεται.50 The Athenian who in a proxeny decree of the Delphians ca. 151 is praised, in lines 4–5, as being εὐσεβὴς and ὅσιος is again praised in lines 9–10 [ἐπί τε τᾶι ποτὶ τὸν θεὸν εὐ]σεβείαι καὶ ὁσιότατι.51 Ι note here and earlier whether these terms were directed to gods or humans. In short, when an object is specified, εὐσέβεια in our texts is always directed to the gods, the god, or the divine. ὁσιότης, however, may be directed to either the gods, as we have seen, or, somewhat unexpectedly, to humans.52 The Colophonian praise of the chresmologue Menophiles is a clear example of the distinction: διά τε τὴν πρὸ[ς θεοὺς εὐσέβει]αν καὶ τὴν πρὸς ἀνθρώπους ὁσιό[τητα].53Similarly the wife of Attalus I (269–197) and mother of Eumenes II (197–158), now dead and divinized, had demonstrated her virtue, διὰ τὸ κεχρῆ[σθ]αι καὶ [θε]οῖς εὐσεβῶς καὶ γονεῦσιν ὁσίω[ς].54 So, too, of Moschion of Priene, βεβιωκὼς εὐσ[εβῶς μὲ]ν πρὸς θεούς, ὁ[σ]ίως δε πρὸς τοὺς γονεῖς καὶ τοὺ[ς συμ]β[ι]οῦντας.55 On an undated tombstone from Melos, Cleonymes praises his father βεβιωκότα τὰ μὲ[ν πρὸς θεοὺ]ς [ε]ὐσεβῶς, τ[ὰ δὲ πρὸς τὴν π]ατρίδα κα[ὶ τοὺς πολ]είτα[ς] ὁσίως [και π]ρὸ[ς] ἐμὲ δὲ [φιλο]στόργ[ως].56 The reason for this, for εὐσέβεια directed to the gods but for ὁσιότης directed sometimes to gods but other times to humans, lies in the essential meanings of the words.57 εὐσέβεια is “proper respect” for the gods and is manifested in 48 Technitai, I.

In all cases the curser was a woman.2 These tablets have longer or shorter versions of much the same form, but it varies somewhat based on the perceived injustice. The curser “consecrates” or “dedicates” (ἀνιεροῖν, ἀνατιθέναι) the opponent(s) to Demeter, Kore, and asso-ciated gods. The perceived injustice is then detailed. If the injustice involved a deposit or missing or stolen objects, in the fullest form the curser asks for the return, usually in the form of “bringing” the object to Demeter and Kore. If the perpetrator does not do this, then there is the wish he or she not find Demeter “kindly” (εὐείλατος). Then we have the phrase of particular interest for our purposes, ἀποδοῦσι μὲν αὐτοῖς ὅσια ῆ, μὴ ἀποδοῦσι δὲ ἀν[όσια]: “After they have given (them) back, may things be “religiously correct” for them, but if they have not given them back, may things be not “religiously correct.”3 Here, because the perpetrator has somehow been “dedicated” to Demeter and her associated deities, because this all plays out in a sanctuary, because the object is to be “given,” surely only temporarily, to Demeter, and because of the deity’s involvement, the theft of a garment or failure to repay a deposit—things gods usually do not worry about—becomes a religious matter, of concern to the 1 I.

The form must be, despite its appearance, an optative of εἰμί, perhaps hyperdoric in origin, an optative of wish as is, in the same context, the [γέ]νοιτο of #153. A.17–18 and B.1–2. No subjunctive construction suits any of the relevant passages. One should not treat it as an error of mood by the writer, in part because it is found on at least two tablets, in part because the optative of wish is used correctly and often on these tablets.

That is unique on curse tablets, but even more remarkable is that the curser is concerned about his or her ὁσιότης and, occasionally, that of his or her children.6 For the curser him- or herself (ἐμοί), two concerns are expressed, that all this be ὅσια for the curser but ἀνόσια for the perpetrator. Otherwise put, on one tablet the curser is concerned that all of this be καθαρόν for him.7 All of this, again, is understand-able only because the site is a sanctuary and cult deities are involved. Or the curser wishes that it be ὅσια for him or her to “drink with,” “eat with” (“or go to the same table”), “go into the same building,” or “go to the bath” with the perpetrator.8 Such restrictions one usually associates with dealings with mur-derers, but here because the agent of injustice is ἀνόσιος, for the reasons given above, the curser thinks that his or her own ὁσιότης may be affected by such intercourse. All of this, I think, arises because of the context of these tablets, that is, the presence of a sanctuary and the involvement of cult deities.94 ἐνθύμιον ἔστω Δάματρος καὶ Κούρας, #150.B.7. On the possible more specific sense of ἐνθύμιον here, see Karila-Cohen, 2010.5 The meaning of ὅσια in these texts has, I think, been often misunderstood. Versnel (1991.72) has it right, “May I be . . . innocent of any offense against religion.” Recently, though, Eidenow (2007), using the older texts and enumeration of Audollent (1904), translates #147.B.1 as “innocent of any profanity” (p. 388), #150.B.6 as “innocent” (p. 388), and the same expres-sion in #151.11–12 as “let there be blessings for. . . .” (p. 389). Newton (1863.725), the first to publish the texts, was close with his translation of this phrase in #147: “May it be lawful for me. . . . ,” but without the religious element. So, too, Faraone, 2011. I do, however, disagree with Newton’s claim that the phrase “is intended to exempt the author of the curse from all liabil-ity to be involved in its consequences” (388). I likewise disagree with Gager, 1992.190 n. 53: “The language suggests some reluctance on the part of the client to undertake the action of commissioning the defixio, whether because of its illegality, its social unacceptability, or perhaps simply because of its great contagious power.” The problem addressed by the phrase is religious, not legal or social, and has nothing to do with reluctance to make the defixio.6 For children as well, #151.7, 11–12 and 153.B.8–9.7 #159.7–8.8 “Drink with,” #148.B.1 and 155.8–9; “eat with” or same table, 147.B.5–7, 148.B.2, 153.B.6–7, 154.23; “same building,” 147.B.3–5, 148.B.3–4, 150.A.6, 153.B.4–5, 154.23–4, 155.10–11; and “bath,” 147.B.1–2.

In literary texts it is found only in Isocrates 11.27 (τὴν αὑτῶν εὐσέβειαν ἐπιδεδειγμένους) of early IV BC and then not again until Diod. S. 4.39.1 of I BC. The one sure example in Attic inscriptions is instructive. In IG II2 680.5–6 of 250/49 from Athens, the phrase is probably taken from the invitation of the Aetolian League to participate in the Soteria at the invitation of the Aetolian League.1 Outside of Athens it is used of states, most fully by the Cnidians of Cos (I. Cos ED 77.1–3 of ca. 200): [τοῦ δ]άμου δ[ιὰ πα]ντὸς ἀποδεικνύμενου τὰν ὑπάρ[χουσαν αὐ]τῶι διὰ προγόνων ποτὶ τὸ θεῖον εὐσέβει[αν].2 The phrase may also be used of individuals,3 but seems never to have developed into a formula.4 In II BC one could also “make a showing” (ἀπόδειξιν ποιεῖσθαι) of one’s εὐσέβεια, but again not in Athens. The phrase was used by the technitai of Dionysus at Opous and is found at Lindos and at Priene, the last in a unique form: τῆς ἑαυτοῦ καλοκἀγαθίας ἀπόδ[ε]ιγμα τὸ κάλλιστον διδοὺς εὐσεβείᾳ.5 At Delphi the ἀποδείξεις might be πολλαὶ καὶ μεγάλαι.6 If the restorations are correct, RC 9.9–10 would have this phrase, [πολλὰς καὶ μεγάλας ἀ]ποδείξεις, earliest by about 100 years (281/0), in a letter from Seleucus I and Antiochus. The rarity of these phrases in Athenian inscriptions may be another indication that they were hesitant to ascribe permanent εὐσέβεια to an individual.εὐσεβῶς πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς διακείμενοι is found in various forms, first in III BC. The largest cluster then is in the responses in 208/7 to the invitation of Magnesia on the Meander to cities throughout the Greek world to participate in the new heorte and games of Artemis Leukophryene. The invitees so praise themselves7 1 Above, p. 28. If the extensive restorations of IG II2 1265.3–4 are correct, we have a private association in Athens praising a tamias for “showing εὐσέβειαν,” and this, ca. 300, would be the earliest attested epigraphical example.2 Cf. I. Stratonikeia 512.4–5 from Lagina.3 SEG 33.675.5, IG XI.4.1061.10, XII.5.481.8–9, and I.

Magnesia 100a.16–17 where the Magnetes so describe themselves in a revival and reorga-nization of their heorte of Artemis Leukophryene.9 In inscriptions the techni-tai of Dionysus are first attested to have used the phrase, before 246, in praising a benefactor, in Egypt, a man who they claim πρὸς τὸν Διόνυσον καὶ τοὺς ἀ[λλους θεοὺς εὐσεβῶς καὶ ὁσίως διακείμενος τυγχάνει (I. Prose 6.6–7 = Aneziri, 2003, #E2 = Le Guen #61). He is crowned ἕνεκα καὶ εὐσεβείας τῆς εἴς τε βασιλέα Πτολεμαῖον καὶ τὸν Διόνυσον καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους θεούς (18–19). One of Ptolemy’s generals is also praised in Samothrace for ε[ὐσεβῶ]ς διακείμενος πρὸς τοὺς θεούς (IG XII.8.156. 4–5) in 240–221, and in Smyrna King Seleucus himself is so praised ca. 245 (I. Smyrna 573.I.6). The link of the early examples to Egyptians may or may not be relevant as to the source of the spread of the phrase, as also the link to the technitai of Dionysus. Isocrates, in any case, could use the phrase of the Athenians for an international audience, with his usual penchant for superla-tives (here εὐσεβέστατα), as early as 380 (4.33),10 but otherwise the phrase is not found in Athenian literary or state epigraphical texts.11 In II BC the phrase becomes more common, especially at Delphi in praising individuals, peoples, and kings.12 Other examples are from Asia Minor and the Aegean islands.13 The only others are one each from Egypt, Oropus, and Argos.148 Technitai of Dionysus, I.

On the cult see Mikalson, 1998. 254 and 277. The restora-tion [πρὸς] τὸ θεῖον εὐσεβῶ[ς διακείμενον] of IG II2 994.3 of 224–220 is probable, and it is noteworthy that this, like the Magnesian texts, looks to be a response to an invitation to games, perhaps picking up the language of the invitation. The three Athenian exceptions thus tend to support the rule that the Athenians did not use the phrase.12 FD 3.1.152.9, 2.33.2–3, 3.242.11–12, 4.49.4, 4.52.2–3, 4.77.7, 4.431.3–5, CID IV.110.6, and SEG 18.189.2–3.13 Asia Minor: Sardis, I.

The polis exerted far more control and authority over this cult than over any other, and did so from the time of Solon at least. The nature and extent of this authority serve as an example of what polis control over a cult would look like if it were in fact common.1 Nomoi and PsephismataThere are by far more nomoi and psephismata, that is acts of the Ekklesia, con-cerning this cult than for all other individual cults combined. Kevin Clinton (1980 and 2005–2008) summarizes the content of I. Eleusis 138 of, probably, 353/2–348/7 as follows: the announcement of the Mysteries and the selec-tion and sending of the spondophoroi to the other Greek cities; the limits and nature of the Sacred Truce surrounding the festival; the behavior of the cities toward the spondophoroi and the report of the latter on their mission; regulations concerning the myesis (the initiation preliminary to participation in the Mysteries); the appointment of the epimeletai, their duties and those of the basileus in managing the festival; the duties of the exegetai before the fes-tival; the selection of the hearth-initiate; and (after a long lacuna) regulations pertaining to the initiates and pompe; legal procedures for various infractions; and the general responsibilities of the epistatai. “The original document,” he claims, “may have covered every aspect of the Mysteries on which it was appro-priate at this time for the Athenian State to legislate.” The motivation for this nomos at this time, as Clinton plausibly suggests, is renewed foreign interest and more foreign visitors after the Peloponnesian War, a “desire to attract them and . . . a concern for their well-being after their arrival.” Clinton puts this law into the context of other legislation concerning Eleusis, some reaching back to Solon.1 On the epigraphical evidence for the cult at Eleusis in the late Hellenistic period, see Deshours, 2011.136–49. For a survey of changes in the Mysteries from their founding until III AD, often in the context of τὰ πάτρια, see Patera, 2011."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":" 297Athens And The Cult Of Eleusinian DemeterThis text and its apparent predecessor, I. Eleusis 19 of ca. 470–460, are suf-ficient to document the intense involvement of the Ekklesia in the administra-tion of the Demeter cult, going far beyond anything we see for other cults. It is noteworthy that both were erected in the Eleusinion in Athens, not at Eleusis, and, of course, the construction of the Eleusinion on the slope of the Acropolis is perhaps the best indicator of the unusual concern of the polis with this Eleusinian cult.2Other nomoi and psephismata, including some of the earliest surviving, reflect concern with these same elements. I. Eleusis 13 of ca. 500 orders the hieropoioi of the Eleusinians to make specific sacrifices to various Eleusinian deities, probably as preliminaries to the celebration of the Mysteries them-selves. I. Eleusis 30 of ca. 432/1, found at Eleusis, concerns the election, pay, duties, and term of annual epistatai at Eleusis, who are now to oversee annual revenues that come to sanctuaries of Demeter at Eleusis. By 149/8 various pse-phismata governed the initiation fee of the Eleusinian Mysteries (I. Eleusis 233.11–17). I. Eleusis 250 of II/I BC in its surviving portions treats especially the pompe for the Mysteries. Other surviving nomoi and psephismata also concern the aparche. In the mid-430’s the polis, by a psephisma, revised a number of provisions concerning the aparche, including among other things the determi-nation of the amount and, most notably, the requirement that all allied states make it and the request that all Greek states do it (I. Eleusis 28a). In 353/2 nomothetai revised arrangements of the aparche, and they are expressly revis-ing “the nomos of Chaeremonides about the aparche” (I. Eleusis 142 of 353/2). In other matters, Demosthenes 21.10 and 175–6 gives the nomos of Euegoras preventing restraint for debt during the Mysteries and certain other heortai, and by a psephisma of 422/1 the polis at its own expense built a bridge over one of the Rheitoi, so that “the priestesses may carry τὰ ἱερά as safely as possible,” surely in the pompe from Athens to Eleusis for the Mysteries (I. Eleusis 41).3 Noteworthy here is the nomos proposed by Lycurgus ([Plut.] X. Orat. 842a) not allowing women to ride on wagons to the Mysteries.2 On all matters concerning the Eleusinion in the city, see Miles, 1998.3 Other nomoi and psephismata in Clinton’s list (2005–2008.II.447–8) which are of our time period, of the polis, and concern cult matters are I. Eleusis 135 of IV/III BC, 188 of 251/0, 199 of 227/6, 206 of ca. 220, and 237 of ca. 120. The sacred calendar of Eleusis is I. Eleusis 175."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"298Appendix 7 The BouleThe Boule met at Eleusis during the Mysteries (IG II2 1072.3), and there was a nomos, going back to Solon, requiring that it meet in the Eleusinion in Athens on the day after the Mysteries (Andoc. 1.111 and 115–16). It supervised the ἀπαρχαί and supervised and made numerous sacrifices at Eleusis, on behalf of Demos (I. Eleusis 142), appointed epistatai to take charge of funds of the cult (Rhodes, 1972.93), received distribution of meat from hieropoioi (IG II3 1164.25–6), and received at least occasional reports from the epimeletai of the Mysteries (I. Eleusis 181), the hierophant (SEG 19.124), and the demarch of Eleusis (I. Eleusis 229). It honored the epimeletai of the Mysteries of 215/4 (IG II3 1164) and in at least three years dedicated phialai at Eleusis (IG II2 1544.47–50). In 329/8 it ordered an aresteria for Demeter and Kore at Eleusis (I. Eleusis 177.431–2). The (Archon) BasileusThe Athenaion Politeia (57.1) assigns to the basileus supervision of the Mysteries with the epimeletai of the Mysteries and the Eumolpidae and Kerykes.4 In [Lysias] 6.4 it is expected that the basileus will sacrifice κατὰ τὰ πάτρια in the City Eleusinion and in the sanctuary at Eleusis and will supervise the heorte at the Mysteries, “so that no one commits an injustice or shows lack of respect concerning the sacred things.” I. Eleusis 138.27–50 of mid-IV BC, though very fragmentary, reveals the centrality of the basileus along with the epimeletai of the Mysteries in punishing malefactors at the Mysteries.5 From I. Eleusis 250.43 of II/I BC he had a role in the arrangements of the pompe. The basileus also reported to the prytaneis on performance of the Mysteries after the event (Andoc. 1.111), probably in anticipation of the meeting of the Boule held in the Eleusinion after the Mysteries.4 Cf. I. Eleusis 138 of mid-IV BC. In I. Eleusis 100 of late IV BC the paredros of the basileus is praised for his supervision of matters concerning the Mysteries in association with the basi-leus and the genos of the Kerykes.

Eleusis 181 of 267/6 two epimel-etai report the sacrifice which they made at the Mysteries in Agrai (7–19). In this text the epimeletai also supervised the sacrifice at the Great Mysteries (19–24), and IG II3 1329.7–12 of 173/2 has been restored in a probable way to have them personally making sacrifices at both the Great Mysteries and the Mysteries at Agrai. In II/I BC they were involved in the arrangements for the pompe (I. Eleusis 250.37 and 43–4). They also had a major role in giving fines or sending to court the disorderly at the Mysteries.9Among the other polis cults that had epimeletai, only the epimeletai of the Mysteries appear to have contributed their own funds.10 The most generous of these was Xenocles who had built, spending his own money, a stone bridge so that τὰ ἱερά might travel “safely and καλῶς,” as well as the participants in the panegyris, and so that the residents and farmers might also be safe.11 In 267/6 the epimeletai of the Mysteries sacrificed “from their own funds” τὰ σωτήρια to Demeter and Kore on behalf of the Boule and Demos.12 The epimeletai of the Mysteries in 214/3 prepared a team of oxen for transporting τὰ ἱερά,13 sent for the Eleusinia a bull as a victim, and, more generally, spent “from their own funds” for all the other things that were appropriate for the sacrifices.14 6 On the duties of the epimeletai of the Mysteries, see Clinton, 1980.280–3 and 2005–2008.II.120–1 and 261–5, Rhodes, 1993.536–8, and MacDowell, 1990.389–90. Clinton (2005–2008.II.265) suggests that the number of epimeletai “may have been reduced early in the Hellenistic period, with only those from the Eumolpidae and Kerykes retained.”7 I.

Prosecution of Cases of AsebeiaAlmost half of all known prosecutions for asebeia in Athens concerned the Eleusinian Mysteries. After ca. 415 the Melian poet Diagoras, a notorious athe-ist, was convicted of “making public” “and denigrating” the Mysteries, and turning away others from them. He was condemned to death and fled the city. By a psephisma the Athenians announced rewards for anyone who killed him or returned him to Athens.16 The profanation of the Mysteries, involving Alcibiades and Andocides, occurred in these same years, and here all the polis machinery was brought to bear. The Ekklesia ordered the Boule to investigate, and the Boule forwarded its findings to the dikasteria for trial and punishment. By a psephisma the Ekklesia awarded cash rewards for those who offered infor-mation on the case, and then ordered the priests and priestesses of Eleusis to curse Alcibiades and, probably, Andocides for their actions.17 In 201 two uninitiated Acarnanian young men snuck into the sanctuary at Eleusis with the initiants and were discovered. They were arrested and, eventually, put to death—surely through the procedures of the polis, not just of Eleusis. The Acarnanian people turned to Philip V of Macedon for help, and this resulted in the Macedonian assault on Athens and Attica that brought great devastation to the countryside, including probably the destruction of virtually all sanc-tuaries. The Athenians, in retaliation, abolished the two Macedonian tribes (Demetrias and Antigonis), instituted a damnatio memoriae of Philip, his fam-ily, and his ancestors, put curses (probably through the Eleusinian priesthood) on all sites that had once served to honor Philip and his ancestors, and called in the Romans.1815 I.
