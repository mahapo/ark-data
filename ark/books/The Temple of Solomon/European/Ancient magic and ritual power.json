Since then, scholars have published a substantial number of individual magical texts in jour-nals and have produced several new collections of magical texts in translation. For example, if we cite only collections in English translation, we can list the following: The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation, Including the Demotic Spells (1986, 2nd ed. 1992), edited by Hans Dieter Betz; Ancient Egyptian Magical Texts (1978), edited by J. F. Borghouts; Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient World (1992), edited by John G. Gager; Ancient Christian Magic: Coptic Texts of Ritual Power (1994), edited by Marvin Meyer and Richard Smith; Amulets and Magical Bowls: Aramaic Incantations of Late Antiquity (1985), edited by Joseph Naveh and Shaul Shaked; Hebrew and Aramaic Incantation Texts from the Cairo Genizah (1992), edited by Lawrence H. Schiffman and Michael D. Swartz; and so on. Beyond these, a plethora of articles and monographs has appeared as scholarly studies and evaluations of magical texts and traditions from the ancient world. Fritz Graf is certainly right in calling this \"the modern boom of magical studies.\" The present volume, Ancient Magic and Ritual Power, provides a series of essays that disclose \"the state of the art\" in the study of ancient magic. These essays derive from an international confer-ence on \"Magic in the Ancient World,\" convened in August 1992 by Marvin Meyer and Paul Mirecki, at the University of Kansas. The essays, like the papers presented at the conference, are authored by scholars, from a variety of disciplines, who represent the renaissance in the study of ancient magic. At the conference and in this volume these scholars have intentionally been brought"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"together to employ the approaches of their own disciplines as they investigate the phenomena of ancient magic. Apart from the many positive contributions, what emerges from these essays is a clear sense of scholarly discomfort with some traditional ways of describing and classifying magic, including ancient magic. At times this discomfort extends to the very use of a term that may be as loaded and prejudicial as \"magic.\" Jonathan Z. Smith's assertion—\"I see little merit in continuing the use of the substantive term 'magic' in second-order, theoretical, academic discourse\"—is strongly put, but it represents one way of articulai-ing this sense of dis-ease with what has been dubbed \"magic.\" For often \"magic\" has been discussed in comparison with, and in sharp contrast to, religion, science, and medicine, and \"magic\" has got-ten the worst of such comparisons. Various theories—at times theologically biased, culturally one-sided, chronologically self-congratulatory—have been advanced to show that \"magic\" is bad religion, bad science, bad medicine. \"Magic\" is an old, immature, underdeveloped form of religion and science; or it is a degraded form of true religion and pure science; or it is a partial, unfulfilled form of the more complete expression of religion and science that we modem folks wish to consider characteristic of our own way of life. As the essays in this volume show, such biased descriptions and definitions of magic may be seen in the likes of Sir James G. Frazer (The Golden Bough, 1910) and many others, but they are ulti-mately rooted in Greco-Roman polemic and Protestant anti-Roman Catholic statements. (See especially the essays by Jonathan Z. Smith, Fritz Graf, Robert K. Ritner, and Stephen D. Ricks.) It has become a part of Western conceit to think of religion and science as what \"we\" do and magic as what others (\"they\") do. Ritner puts it very succinctly: \"Magic is a category of exclusion\"— and it has been such, in some Western circles in particular, for a long time. A large part of the problem of describing and defining magic comes from our preoccupation with classifying. We scholars are unrepentant taxonomists, and taxonomy entails comparison and contrast. In his essay in this volume Smith mentions the problems of comparison and the taxa used in comparison, most notably the problem of dichotomous taxa. Elsewhere, in his book Drudgery Divine: On the Comparison of Early Christianities and the Relig-ions of Late Antiquity (1990), he expands upon this issue. In the book he observes that the statement \"x resembles y\" is invariably triadic: \"there is always an implicit 'more than,' and there is always a 'with respect to'\" (51). The implications of this observa-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"tion, including the political implications, Smith continues, are striking: comparison does not necessarily tell us how things \"are\" (the fer from latent presupposition that lies behind the notion of the \"genealogical\" with its quest for \"real\" historical connections); like models and meta-phors, comparison tells us how things might be conceived, how they might be \"redescribed,\" in Max Black's useful term. A comparison is a disciplined exaggeration in the service of knowledge. It lifts out and strongly marks certain features within difference as being of possible intel-lectual significance, expressed in the rhetoric of their being \"like\" in some stipulated fashion. Comparison provides the means by which we \"re-vision\" phenomena as our data in order to solve our theoretical problems (52). Applying this idea of comparison and the hidden agenda of comparison to the scholarly study of ancient magic, we may con-elude that many of the scholars represented in this volume seek to identify the \"exaggerations\" of previous ways of describing \"magic\" and suggest new, \"revisionist\" means of viewing \"magical\" phenomena. It is no surprise that essays in this volume express a profound concern for paradigms and paradigm-shifts. * * * The title of this volume, Ancient Magic and Ritual Power, has been chosen with paradigmatic concerns in mind. In these essays we encounter what traditionally has been depicted as \"ancient magic,\" but we may prefer to apply different labels or taxa in our task of \"re-visioning\"—hence the phrase \"ritual power.\" A com-mon feature of the texts and traditions under consideration, as highlighted in the essays, is empowerment. A quick survey of these essays discloses powers supernal and infernal being summoned, i.e., deities, supernatural assistants, angels, and demons; powers coming to expression in the lives of people for divination, healing, protec-tion, exorcism of evil, and love; powers being employed to margi-nalize others who are judged to be deviant or even diabolical; powers being retained in a person, and sometimes worn in the form of amulets or phylacteries. The texts and traditions examined here claim to empower people, in ways similar to those commonly assigned to religious texts and traditions, by channeling, summon-ing, adjuring, realizing powers without and within. Yet the sort of empowerment discussed in this volume is achieved specifically through ritual. There are numerous ways to"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"characterize ritual, and many of the essays published here describe ritual and rituals. In Ancient Christian Magic Marvin Meyer and Richard Smith offer the following overview of rituals in magical texts, that is, texts of ritual power: They direct the user to engage in activities that are marked off from nor-mal activity by framing behavior through rules, repetitions, and other formalities. Ritual instructions pervade these texts. Stand over here, hold a pebble, tie seven threads in seven knots, say the names seven times, draw the figure in the bottom of the cup, write the spell with the finger cf a mummy, write it with bat's blood, with menstrual blood, on papyrus, on clay, on lead, on tin, or a rib bone, on a parchment shaped like a sword, fold it, burn it, tie it to your arm, your thumb, drive a nail in it, bury it with a mummy, bury it under someone's doorstep, mix this rec-ipe, drink it. Or simply \"do the usual\" (4). In the present volume the essays similarly study the \"repetitions\" and \"formalities\" of ritual. As these essays also indicate, such ritual comes to expression variously, for instance through sacrifices and cultic meals, often miniaturized, and com-monly through the repetitions of words, written or spoken, in the form of incantations, formulae, historiolae, voces magicae, and divine names of power. Myths and names, when performed ritu-ally, may produce an eruption of power in the present moment. It is entirely appropriate that David Frankfurter's essay on historio-lae, or stories of mythic precedent, should close the volume in a conclusion with the rubric \"Myth, Magic, and the Power of the Word.\" An understanding of \"magic\" as \"ritual power,\" then, permeates many of the essays in this volume. In the first essay Jonathan Z. Smith sets the tone for the discussion by re-defining the Greek \"magical\" papyri in these terms as \"one of the largest collections of functioning ritual texts, largely in Greek, produced by ritual specialists that has survived from late antiquity.\" Yet, we know all too well, paradigm-changes are slippery and often difficult to accomplish. If \"magic\" is taken as \"ritual power,\" then \"magical\" phenomena may need to be described anew and the lines of demar-cation redrawn. Precisely what the possibilities and problems are for the category \"ritual power\" may need to be explored. For these reasons we have cast the interpretive net in this volume as widely as we could, in order to explore the options for \"ritual\" and \"power,\" broadly conceived, in antiquity and late antiquity. Some-times the investigation of \"ritual\" may go beyond what we might intuit to be \"magical ritual\"; at other times the analysis of \"power\""},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"may include rituals and texts that we judge to be on the periphery of the discussion of \"magical power.\" Such breadth, reflecting the state of the scholarly discussion, is important if we are to attempt to designate helpful and telling criteria for our discussion of \"magic\" and \"ritual power.\" • * * The texts and traditions of magic and ritual power addressed here are represented in the volume title as \"ancient,\" and this term, too, merits attention. The essays in this volume and the papers from the conference that preceded the volume have been prepared by scholars from a wide range of disciplines, all of whom are still concerned with magic and ritual power in Mediterranean and Near Eastern antiquity and late antiquity. The scholars thus assembled are students of Egyptology, ancient Near Eastern stud-ies, the Hebrew Bible, Judaica, classical Greek and Roman studies, early Christianity and patristics, and Coptology, and the chrono-logical period they consider begins with the early civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia and extends into the Middle Ages. The methods of these scholars include historical-critical, textual, papy-rological, descriptive, interpretive, exegetical, theoretical, and rhetorical approaches to the subject matter. It is unusual for such a diverse assemblage of scholars and their essays to be brought to-gether to investigate ancient magical traditions, and herein lies some of the unique value of this volume. In these essays we have the opportunity to explore these traditions with scholars who exemplify the manifold approaches that are appropriate if we are to do justice to the study of magic and ritual power in antiquity. The essays have been carefully organized into five sections plus a conclusion. Apart from the first section and the conclusion, which bracket the rest of the essays, the sections are organized with chronological and cultural considerations in mind. In Part 1, \"Defining Ancient Magic and Ritual Power,\" Jona-than Z. Smith, Fritz Graf, and Robert K. Ritner lay the foundation for the volume by examining second-order, academic descriptions as well as first-order, \"native\" descriptions of ancient magic and ritual power. From this examination comes a clarification of \"magic\" as a polemical term of exclusion, as we have already noted, but also an understanding of the classical Egyptian and early Greek conceptions of \"magic\" as a more neutral category of inclu-sion. With a deliberately ambiguous title, \"Trading Places,\" Smith not only suggests trading places between generic labels used to"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"describe \"magic\" and \"ritual power\"; he also adds a set of reflec-tions on the function of ritual \"place\" in the Greek magical papyri. In Part 2, \"Magic and Ritual Power in the Ancient Near East,\" Richard H. Beal, Billie Jean Collins, and J. A. Scurlock describe and interpret several ancient Hittite and Mesopotamian rituals that empowered the Hittite military, structured Hittite sacrifice and cultic meals, and made opportunistic use of the power available from ghosts who were traveling at the time of annual Mesopota-mian festivals of the dead. These three essays show how the an-cient Near Eastern folks who participated in these rituals were able to live out of the power they had invoked: the Hittite military and the Hittite kingdom thrived for centuries \"in a tough neighbor-hood,\" the participants in sacrifice and cultic feasting communed with and curried the favor of the gods and goddesses, and people conjuring ghosts got rid of illnesses and personal problems while also divining the future. Brian B. Schmidt opens Part 3, \"Magic and Ritual Power in Ju-daism and Early Christianity,\" by building upon this same tradition of ancient Near Eastern necromancy as he interprets the story of the \"witch\" of En-Dor in the Hebrew Bible. The subsequent essays in this section likewise reflect upon the place of magic in Jewish and Christian traditions. Stephen D. Ricks surveys the role of the magician in these traditions, and his thesis, that the term \"magician\" is used in a pejorative way to distinguish those who are to be considered outsiders, coheres well with a basic perspective of many of the essays in this volume. The next three essays, by Jonathan Seidel, Michael D. Swartz, and Rebecca Lesses, all evalu-ate issues in Jewish magic: Seidel seeks to untangle the Talmudic classification of illicit and licit \"magical\" acts, Swartz underscores the ambivalent status of magic in ancient and medieval Judaism, and Lesses applies a theory of the performative use of language to an important text (also discussed by Swartz) from the Hekhalot literature of Jewish mysticism. Part 4, \"Magic and Ritual Power in Greek Antiquity,\" begins with a lively papyrological essay, by William M. Brashear, in which he presents eight previously unpublished magical and divina-tory texts from Berlin. Such textual work, crucial for making available the primary texts, spells, and amulets of ancient magic, is taken a step further by Roy Kotansky, who identifies a series of Greek exorcistic amulets and traces the language of adjuration through these and other exorcistic texts. Leda Jean Ciraolo focuses her attention upon the classic collection of Greek magical texts, Papyri Graecae Magicae, and examines the activities of super-"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"natural assistants in these Greek texts, just as others examine angels and demons in Judeo-Christian texts elsewhere in the vol-ume. Christopher A. Faraone studies the same classic collection of Greek texts in his wide-ranging essay, but he investigates a portion of PGM XX in order to illustrate \"the continual cultural give-and-take\" that characterizes the multiculturism of magical texts. David Martinez is equally wide-ranging in his study of Greek texts when he turns his attention to vows of abstinence in all kinds of con-texts, and particularly in love magic. Sarah lies Johnston concludes this section (and anticipates the next) by \"defining the dreadful\" according to Greek ways of describing and averting the demonic and the liminal, or the deviant, in society. The four essays in Part 5, \"Magic and Ritual Power in Roman and Late Antiquity,\" carry the discussion of magical traditions through some of the late sources from the Mediterranean world. Oliver Phillips and Jacques van der Vliet continue \"defining the dreadful\": Phillips inquires into cures for poisonous snakebite, and describes Libyans (again, those who are the \"others\" from a Ro-man point of view) who know how to cope with snakebite through the application of what we might call magical and medical tech-niques; van der Vliet discusses Satan and demons in Coptic Chris-tian texts, and analyzes the potpourri of accounts of Satan's fall in Coptic myth and magic. Jason David BeDuhn introduces the magi-cal bowls from late-antique Mesopotamia, and asks whether—and how—such bowls might have been used by Manichaean Gnostics. Todd R. Breyfogle closes this section by questioning the circum-stances that led to the execution of the Christian bishop Priscillian in 385 in Trier, Germany, on the charges of practicing sorcery, participating in nocturnal orgies, and praying naked. The volume ends with a conclusion given the designation \"Myth, Magic, and the Power of the Word.\" In this conclusion David Frankfurter draws together many of the themes discussed throughout the other essays (note especially that of Lesses) by investigating the historiola in magical texts. Frankfurter maintains that through the narration of myth and the performance of the word, the magical power of ritual came to authoritative expression for practitioners of ancient magic. * * * Ancient Magic and Ritual Power offers a fresh look at ancient magical phenomena. As the essays suggest, comfortable, some-times self-serving categories like \"magic\"—or, for that matter,"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"\"religion\" and \"science\"—cannot be used uncritically. Instead, new, self-critical approaches may prove more adequate in illumi-nating texts and traditions in our cultural heritage. Like the essays in the present volume, such new approaches may raise more ques-tions than answers, but these questions themselves may help us \"re-vision\" and \"re-imagine\" the ancient roots of our traditions. Finally, these questions may remind us of our own biases and pre-suppositions, and thus they may teach us a goodly amount about ourselves and the \"magic\" of scholarly inquiry.

Smith As the novelist, Tom Robhins, has observed, all human beings may be divided into just two classes: those who think that every-thing can be divided into just two classes, and those who don't. The putative category \"magic\" is a prime example of such duality. Indeed, in the history of its imagination, it has been doubly dual, being counter-distinguished from both elements in another persis-tent and strong duality—from both \"science\" and \"religion.\" On logical grounds alone, this reduplicated dualism should give rise to some suspicion of duplicity, for, if something is the opposite of one member of another opposition, it ought to have, at the very least, a close affinity to the second member of the pair. But, in the \"pre-logical\" modes of thought which so often characterize an-thropological and religious studies discourse within the human sciences (and so rarely characterize the thought of those peoples they claim to study), the law of the excluded middle has long since been repealed, most commonly by means of a shift from a logical to a chronological rhetoric. Employing an evolutionary hierarchy, the one (\"magic\") is encompassed by either one of its opposites (\"religion\" or \"science\"), with \"magic\" invariably labeled \"older\" and \"religion\" or \"science\" labeled \"newer.\" (Note that this same hierarchy is often applied to the relations between \"religion\" and \"science.\") In this strategic model, as Rick Shweder describes it, The image is one of subsumption, progress and hierarchical inclusion. Some forms of understanding are described as though they were incipient forms of other understandings, and those other forms of understanding are described as though they can do everything the incipient forms can do plus more.1 Hence, many accounts of \"magic\" adopt a privative definition of their subject matter. \"Magic\" resembles \"religion\" (e.g., Rodney 1 R. A. Shweder, Thinking Through Cultures (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1991), 118."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Stark and William Bainbridge2) or \"science\" (e.g., Robin Horton3) lacking only some of the latter's traits. In such formulations, a promised difference in kind turns out to be a postulated difference of degree—or, more pointedly, of development—and one is enti-tied to ask what sort of difference that sort of difference makes? This is, perhaps, the largest single family of theoretical, sub-stantive definitions of \"magic\": \"magic\" is \"religion\" or \"science,\" or an incipient form of \"religion\" or \"science,\" but for the lack of this or that—or, less commonly, but for an excess of this or that. (More popular in early apologetic accounts, but still present in scholars such as H. D. Betz,4 is the reverse ploy which sees \"magic\" as a degraded form of \"religion\" or \"science.\") This dominant understanding is an odd sort of definition. Not only does it break the conventional definitory rules (especially those against the use of a negative definiens), but also because it is typically inconsistent in its application of differentia. For exam-pie, many phenomena that we unhestitatingly label \"religious\" or understand to be \"religions\" (notwithstanding the long and tortured debates over how those terms are to be defined) differ among themselves, on some scale of absent or excessive characteristics, at least as much, if not more, than \"magic\" does from \"religion\" in many theories. What privileges the characteristics chosen for the \"magic/religion\" duality? Or, to ask this question another way, if the purpose of a model in academic discourse—if the heart of its explanatory power—is that it does not accord exactly with any cluster of phenomena (\"map is not territory\"), by what measure-ment is the incongruency associated with those phenomena labeled \"magical\" by scholars (rather than, say, \"religious\") judged to be so great as to require the design and employment of another model? This becomes clearer if we turn to the second major family of theoretical, substantive definitions of \"magic.\" While exhibiting many of the strategic features of the first, this second group adopts an atemporal rather than an explicit (or implicit) developmental perspective. This approach holds that \"magic\" is essentially syn-onymous with this or that aspect of the total ensemble of \"religion.\" (Note that this understanding mimics the first family in 2 R. Stark and W. S. Bainbridge, A Theory of Religion (New York: P. Lang, 1987), 40 et passim. 3 R. Horton, \"African Traditional Thought and Western Science,\" Africa 37 (1967): 50-71, 159-87. 4 See, for example, H. D. Betz, \"Magic and Mystery in the Greek Magical Pa-pyri,\" in C. A. Faraone and D. Obbink, eds., Magika Hiera: Ancient Greek Magic and Religion (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), 244-59, esp. 253-54."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"viewing \"magie\" as encompassed by \"religion\" and as exhibiting either a lack or an excess. The old notion of magic as \"compulsion,\" for example, judges \"magic\" to be either an inade-quacy or an exaggeration, depending on the overall theoretical [and apologetic] stance of the scholar.) Thus, Stanley J. Tambiah, in his recently published Morgan Lectures, Magic, Science, Relig-ion and the Scope of Rationality, reviews and criticizes the usual roundup of suspects—from Tylor and Frazer to Malinowski and Evans-Pritchard—in order to make his main point, that magic is essentially \"performative utterance.\"5 True, but even leaving aside the on-going arguments with and reformulations of Austin's origi-nal proposals in differing ways by both philosophers and linguists, so are a whole host of human utterances in a wide variety of con-crete, pragmatic contexts, including a large number of expressions, as Tambiah would acknowledge, usually classified as \"religious\" rituals. The second family of theoretical, substantive definitions de-pends, as has been already suggested, upon a notion of some aspect of \"magic\" being synonymous with some aspect of \"religion\" (albeit often with a different valence). Synonymy is theoretically useful precisely in that two (or more) terms are thought to be so close that their micro-distinctions take on enormous clarificatory power. While of no use whatever for scholarly purposes, I refer, for a sense of what I mean, to the entry \"magic\" in Webster's New Dictionary of Synonyms (1968 edition): Magic, sorcery, witchcraft, witchery, wizardry, alchemy, thaumaturgy are comparable rather than synonymous in their basic senses. In extended use they are sometimes employed indifferently without regard to the implica-tions of their primary senses and with little distinction from the most in-elusive term, magic, but all are capable of being used discriminatingly and with quite distinctive implications. But if one cannot specify the distinctions with precision, as is usually the case in definitions of this second type, the difference makes no difference at all. From E. B. Tylor's notion of \"magic\" as misapplied logic (a strong example of the first family) to Claude Lévi-Strauss's under-5 S. J.

Such substantive definitions have failed for the logical and procedural reasons already suggested (among others). In their turn, these flaws have been brought about by the fact that in academic discourse \"magic\" has almost always been treated as a contrast term, a shadow reality known only by looking at the reflection of its opposite (\"religion,\" \"science\") in a distorting fun-house mirror. Or, to put this another way, within the academy, \"magic\" has been made to play the role of an evaluative rather than an interpretative term, and, as such, usually bears a negative valence. While such negative valuations can, at times, be traced to spe-cific ideologies, causality is rarely that clear. The notion of \"magic\" as \"other\" is far more deeply engrained. It is already present, to be used rather than created by these ideologies. As is the case with the majority of our most disturbing and mischievous hegemonic formulations, the negative valence attributed to \"magic\" has been, and continues to be, an element in our common-sense—and, therefore, apparently unmotivated—way of viewing cultural affairs. Consider the shifting taxonomies and genealogies we employ (without ever troubling to account for the shift). For example, in most late 19th and early 20th century works, shamanism is the very type of \"magic.\" In more recent treatments, shamanism has been transferred to the \"religious.\" (For Mircea Eliade it is the most transcendent form of \"archaic religion\"; for Tom Overholt it is the very type of \"prophetic religion.\") What has changed is not the data—by and large, the old, circumpolar ethnographies con-tinue to be the prime sources—what has changed is the attitude of the scholar. For these (and for other) reasons, I see little merit in continuing the use of the substantive term \"magic\" in second-order, theoreti-cal, academic discourse. We have better and more precise scholarly taxa for each of the phenomena commonly denotated by \"magic\" which, among other benefits, create more useful categories for comparison. For any culture I am familiar with, we can trade places between the corpus of materials conventionally labeled \"magical\" and corpora designated by other generic terms (e.g., healing, di-vining, execrative) with no cognitive loss. Indeed, there would be a gain in that this sort of endeavor promises to yield a set of middle-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"range typologies—always the most useful kind—more adequate than the highly general, usually dichotomous, taxa commonly employed (\"sympathetic/contagious,\" \"witchcraft/sorcery,\" \"benevolent/malevolent\"—or even Christina Lamer's more so-phisticated typology of three types with two sub-types6). Similarly, such mid-range taxa would be more adequate than the highly spe-cific categories employed for particular cultures, usually con-structed either anthropologically by function, or philologically by native vocabulary, formulae, or text-type. John Middleton was right in his meditation on Lévi-Strauss, al-though he shrunk from its consequences: If magic is a subjective notion . .. then it can have little or no meaning in cross-cultural analysis or understanding. The concept of magic is in itself empty of meaning and thus susceptible to the recognition of any meaning we care to give it; following this, Lévi-Strauss has implied that the category of magic must be \"dissolved.\"7 The matter, however, will not be so simply disposed of. As with a large class of religious studies vocabulary (e.g., \"myth\"), the name will not be easily rectified. Abstention, \"just say 'No',\" will not settle \"magic.\" For, unlike a word such as \"religion,\" \"magic\" is not only a second-order term, located in academic discourse. It is as well, cross-culturally, a native, first-order category, occurring in ordinary usage which has deeply influenced the evaluative language of the scholar. Every sort of society appears to have a term (or, terms) designating some modes of ritual activities, some beliefs, and some ritual practitioners as dangerous, and/or illegal, and/or deviant. (Even some texts, conventionally labeled \"magical\" by scholars, themselves contain charms and spells against what the text labels \"magic.\"8) These ethnoclassifications differ widely and can be quite com-plex. Moreover, it is far from clear that, in many cases, these native distinctions as to dangerous, illicit, and/or deviant practitio-ners and practices can be properly rendered, in all their nuances, by the common English terms \"magic,\" \"witchcraft,\" \"sorcery.\" 6 C.

First, as pioneered by Africanists, the focus on native categories has shifted attention away from the act and actor to the accuser and the accusation. \"Magic,\" in this sense, is almost always a third-person attribution rather than a first-person self-designation, and it becomes essential for the interpreter to explain the charge. Note that this presents a set of extraordinary documentary problems which have been overcome in only a relatively few areas of re-search. Pay attention to one Africanist's research protocol which catalogues the kinds of data required: The significant point about a given instance of accusation is not that it is made ... but that it is made in a given field situation. (An account of) this situation would include not only the structure of the groups and sub-groups to which the accuser and accused belong but also their extant divi-sion into transient alliances and factions on the basis of immediate inter-ests, ambitions, moral aspirations, and the like. It would also include as much of the history of these groups, subgroups, alliances and factions as would be considered relevant to the understanding of the accusation .... It would further include ... demographic data about subgroup and fee-tional fluctuations over the relevant time period together with information about the biological and sociological factors bearing on these such as epi-demies, rise and fall in the birth and death rates, labor migrations, wars and feuds ... .9 Due, in large part, to the absence of the sorts of data required, I know of no convincing application of this interpretative strategy, for example, to ancient accusations of magic. In this latter area of research, generalities abound concerning power relations—many of which I find intuitively satisfying—but they lack the sociological specificity, the documentary gravity that confers plausibility to some of the work of colleagues in African, European, and Ameri-can studies, to name the most obvious examples. Second, focus on the accusation and the accuser implies that one can usually speak only of the \"magician\" rather than of \"magic.\" Almost any act, or, in some cases, no act at all (this latter possi-bility alluding to the long-standing discussion engendered by Evans-9 V. Turner, \"Witchcraft and Sorcery: Taxonomy versus Dynamics\" (1964), reprinted in Turner, The Forest of Symbols (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1967), 115."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Pritchard's Zande materials10) can give rise to the accusation. It is the accused individual or group, and their network of social rela-tions and loci in relation to the accusing individual or group, that is held to be the prime motivation for the charge. The \"evidence\" adduced by the native accuser is held by the scholar to be secon-dary, and usually utterly conventional. This has led to a noticeable bias in the literature towards the powerless. But this is an unwarranted simplification. While the accusation of \"magic\" may well be a power ploy that marginalizes the accused, the accusation may equally well be between members of elite groups (as the practice of \"magic\" may well be directed by the marginal against elites). One cannot have it both ways. The shift to a social under-standing of the relations between the accuser and the accused forbids any attempt at a substantive, theoretical definition of \"magic.\" As Victor Turner has observed, Almost every society recognizes such a wide variety of mystically harmful techniques that it may be positively misleading to impose on them a di-chotomous classification. Their name is legion, their form is protean for the very reason that individual spite is capricious.11 I wish I could share the confidence of some scholars that, al-though a substantive definition of \"magic\" is rendered impossible by a sociological approach, the sorts of social fissures and conflicts revealed by the accusations are generalizable. A review of the ethnographic, historical and analytic literature makes clear that they are not. Any form of ressentiment, for real or imagined reasons (see Aberle on \"relative deprivation\"12), may trigger a language of alienating displacement of which the accusation of magic is just one possibility in any given culture's rich vocabulary of alterity. 10 E. E. Evans-Pritchard, Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic among the Azande (Oxford: Clarendon, 1937), 21: \"A witch performs no rite, utters no spell and possesses no medicines. An act of witchcraft is a psychic act.\" If this distinction be accepted as generalizable beyond the Zande (by no means an uncontroversial proposal), then so much for Christian apologetic New Testament scholars who would acquit Jesus of magic on the grounds that he employed no spells or magic materia. In Zande terms, Jesus may be no sorcerer, but might well be a witch! 11 Turner, \"Witchcraft and Sorcery,\" 124-25, emphasis added. 12 D. Aberle, \"A Note on Relative Deprivation Theory as Applied to Mille-narian and Other Cult Movements,\" in S. Thrupp, ed., Millennial Dreams in Action (The Hague: Mouton, 1962), 209-14."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Third, by focusing scholarly attention on the accusation, and given most scholars' work-a־day common-sense positivism, it is all too easy to reduce the charge of \"magic\" to one of mere social placement. One can read entire monographs, especially on Euro-pean materials, without gaining the sense that anyone might have \"actually\" practiced \"magic\" or \"witchcraft.\" As an example, I would call attention to the lively debate which has exercised social historians of Salem for the past decade and a half. While their social analyses agree to a significant degree, they sharply disagree over the question as to whether the accused (or others) \"actually\" practiced \"magic.\"13 Fourth, and closely related to the above, the social approach, ironically, cannot seem to handle those cultural instances where \"magicians\" function as a craft, as a profession, either as an he-reditary office or as a guild with procedures for both training and incorporation. The accusatory model's bias towards the powerless often ignores the positive association of native conceptions of \"magic\" with power. (The latter was one of the strengths of the evolutionary understanding which stressed, although often in naive or polemical forms, the power relations between what it termed \"magic\" and priestcraft or kingship.) The same issue recurs in those cultural instances where \"magic\" is a \"high class\" phenome-non, or where its practice confers social prestige. A fifth and final caution is more strictly methodological in na-ture. Giving primacy to native terminology yields, at best, lexical definitions which, historically and statistically, tell how a word is used. But, lexical definitions are almost always useless for scholarly work. To remain content with how \"they\" understand \"magic\" may yield a proper description, but little explanatory power. How \"they\" use a word cannot substitute for the stipulative procedures by which the academy contests and controls second-order, special-ized usage. However, this returns us to the beginning of this essay and the problematics of a proper, theoretical definition of « . יז magic. * * * I should now like to turn to the Preisendanz corpus, as modified and translated in Betz's edition, and offer some reflections by a generalist for whom the label \"Greek Magical Papyri\" constitutes 13 This debate was largely engendered by the publication of Chadwick Han-sen's Witchcraft at Salem (New York: Braziller, 1969)."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"something of a distraction.14 After all, compared with the frag-ments, contextless quotations, literary descriptions and artistic representations, the corpus, even as it now stands, represents something quite precious: one of the largest collections of func-tioning ritual texts, largely in Greek, produced by ritual specialists that has survived from late antiquity. The fact that the size of the collection could have been more than doubled by the inclusion of parallel materials from other Greek and Greek-based corpora only serves to reinforce its importance.15 My own interest in late antique \"magical\" texts has stemmed, primarily, from my long-standing preoccupation with themes related to place, especially the shift in the locus of religious expe-rience and expression from a permanent sacred center, the archaic temple, to a place of temporary sacrality sanctified by a mobile religious specialist (in this case, the so-called \"magician\").16 I propose to continue that meditation by calling attention to some features of the Preisendanz-Betz corpus which have little to do with issues of \"magic\" as conventionally perceived. 14 K.

As sacrifice was the raison d'etre of the archaic temple, the chief currency of both its divine and human economies, this meant that temples must either be revalorized or abandoned. A temple, an altar, without sacrifice is a mere monument. (See, already, the admittedly polemic account in Joshua 22:10-34.) This meant, as well, that sacrifice would have either to be dis-placed or re-placed. The rationales and strategies for these latter processes were varied. Sometimes, as in the case of Orphic, Neoplatonic and Neo-Pythagorean traditions, a moral cast—no bloodshed—was given to older cultic rules prohibiting pollution by dead animal products, corpses and blood with a consequent recovery and refocus on archaic practices of cereal and incense offerings. (See, for example, the fumigation recipes which form part of the titula of seventy-eight of the eighty-seven late 3rd century \"Orphic\" Hymns.) In the case of the emergent Judaisms and Christianities, spurred only in part by the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, the locus of sacrifice was shifted from Temple to domicile, and the act of sacrifice was wholly replaced by narrative and discourse. Early rabbinic traditions talked endlessly about sacrifices no longer per-formed, in many cases, never experienced, and, in its ritual praxis, substituted speech for deed. The best known example is the dictum attributed to Rabbi Gamliel: \"Whoever does not say these three things on Passover has not fulfilled his obligations,\" with the first of the three being the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb (M. Pesahim 10.5). This is a sentence about ritual speech which, by virtue of its inclusion in the later Passover Haggadah, has itself become ritual speech. Some early Christians developed the utterly rhetorical metaphor of sacrifice as an important component of their narrative under-standing of Jesus' death. Over time, the Christian use of the sacri-ficial analogy was extended to characterize a whole host of human phenomena by traditions that never \"actually\" sacrificed, including the sacrament of marriage post-Vatican II. Christian liturgy maintained the language of \"altar,\" \"smoke,\" and of the sacrificial elements—now wholly metaphorized; the eucharistie flesh and blood was subsumed to a narrative of paradig-matic institution which was set in a domestic, non-sacrificial con-text."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Of all the documents from late antiquity, I know of none more filled with the general and technical terminology and the praxis of sacrifice than those texts collected by modern scholars under the title Greek Magical Papyri. They are all the more important because they display, as well, a thoroughly domesticated under-standing of sacrifice. Within the papyri,17 while a small number of the ritual topoi are outside—in an open place (IV.900), a deserted place (III.616), a tomb (111.25,286) or by a river (III.286; IV.27)18—the vast ma-jority of rituals which give a locale are set in domestic space, in the practitioner's house (e.g., 1.83,84; 11.148; III.193; IV.2188), or more rarely in the client's place of business or home (VIII.59; XII. 104; cf. IV.2373-2440 where it is implied). As a substantial number of rituals are for procuring some sort of dream oracle, \"your bedroom\" predominates (e.g., II. 1-182; IV.62; VII.490, 593-619, 628-42, 664-85). There are, as well, a number of references to rituals performed on \"your housetop\" (1.70; IV.2711; LXI.6), \"lofty roof' (1.56; IV.2469, 2711), or upper room (IV. 171), chiefly as a place for receiving a celestial power who is then con-ducted to \"the room in which you reside\" (e.g., 1.80-84). Within this domestic space, there is a high concern for purity in both the rituals of preparation and reception. The practitioner is to abstain from sex, from animal food (including fish), and from \"all uncleanness\" (1.40-1, 54, 290-92, et passim). The ritual site is to be a \"clean room\" (IV.2189), a \"pure room\" (VII.875[?])—\"let your place be cleaned of all pollution\" (11.148). Within the \"clean,\" domestic place, the chief ritual is that of sacrifice, most commonly of generic incense (e.g., IV.215; V.395; VIII.58), with frankincense the most frequently specified (e.g., 1.63; IV.908, 1269, 1909). Some dozen other aromatic plant substances, from gums (e.g., III.23) to spices (e.g., III.308; IV.919), were also employed. Other vegetable offerings include roses (IV.2235), sumac (IV.2235), mulberries (III.611), beets (III.614), moss (LXXII.3), cakes (XII.22) and fruits (XII.22), along with libations of wine and/or milk (e.g., III.694). By contrast to these common vegetable offerings, sacrifices wholly made up of animal victims or products are rare. The largest 17 Please note that my citations from the Betz edition are exemplary and not exhaustive. 18 Other outside loci include: a bathhouse (11.49); a stadium (11.43); the east-em section of a village (IV.58-9); a bean field (IV.769); \"a place where grass grows\" (TV.3091); a crossroad (LXX.16)."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"group requires the sacrifice of a white cock (IV.26-51,2189-92, 2359-72; XIII.364-82 [+ pigeon]). The only instance of the whole offering of a mammal remains an editorial conjecture (IV.2394-99). More common than purely animal sacrifices, though less com-mon than purely vegetable offerings, are sacrifices of mixed animal and plant substances. Their usual form is a series of plants plus one animal part, usually its dung or an organ (e.g., 1.285; IV. 1309-15, 3092). If it is a vegetable series plus a whole animal, the latter is invariably a bird (e.g., IV.2892). Some of the animal materia (e.g., dung, eggs, a snake's shed skin) do not require the killing of the animal, while other materia—\"wolfs eye\" (1.285), \"frog's tongue\" (V.203)—may well be code names for plants (see XII.401-44), as is certainly the case for the ingredient, \"pig's snout\" (III.468; V.198, 371). Other texts appear to place differing va-lences on animal and plant offerings, for example IV.2873-79: For doing good, offer storax, myrrh, sage, frankincense, a fruit pit. But for doing harm, offer magical material of a dog and dappled goat [(gloss:) or, in a similar way, of a virgin untimely dead].19 The impression that animal offerings were not the central focus is strengthened by the fact that a sharp knife, the one, indispensi-ble requirement in animal sacrifice, is mentioned as an implement just three times in the corpus (XIII.91-96, 373-75, 646-51). The other ritual implements mentioned introduce another im-portant and highly characteristic element. They are not only highly portable, but appear to be miniaturized. The table, the throne, the tripod, and the censer seem, themselves, to be small and to hold relatively small objects. The sacrificial altar—most often constructed of two or more (unbaked) bricks, but never more than seven—seems especially so. What must be the scale of an altar on which is sacrificed \"on grapevine charcoal, one sesame seed and [one] black cumin seed\" (IV.919)? In addition to these common, though miniaturized, implements is a set of small wooden shrines. Eight appear to be mentioned in the corpus: a juniper wood shrine that holds a mummified falcon (1.21-26); a small, wooden shrine, set up on a table covered with pure linen, enclosing a tripod, censer and small figurine (III.290-320); a lime wood shrine in which lies a small figurine of Hermes made of dough (V.3 70-99); a shrine of olive wood containing a 19 For a most complex example of differing evaluation, in several recensions, see the slander spells involving \"hostile\" offerings, IV.2571-2707."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"statuette of Selene (VII. 866-79); a small temple, standing on a table, into which a small dish is placed in which the first morsels of food from a meal are offered (X.l-9); two small (?) temples con-nected by a single sheet of papyrus (V. 159-60, admittedly obscure); and, most suggestive of all, IV.3125-71, which contains a ritual for fashioning a phylactery which will cause any \"place or temple\" to flourish, to become a \"marvel,\" and to be \"talked about throughout the whole world.\" (It would appear that this \"place or temple,\" for which favor is being asked, is the shop of the ritual's patron [IV.3170, editorial conjecture].) The ritual involves the construc-tion of a small, three-headed wax statue, \"three handbreadths high,\" which is deified by animal (?) sacrifice and placed within a \"little juniper wood temple\" wreathed with olive. The practitioner is enjoined, \"Now feast [with the god], singing to him all night long.\" As this last text makes plain, the \"little\" temples and shrines, in this latter case one housing a figure 0.3 meters high, are treated as if they were major edifices housing a divine image and a cult table. Sacrifice is held before them; a cultic meal follows with a liturgy sung. In other cases, incubation is practiced before the miniature (e.g., V.390-423) rather than sleeping within the large temple precincts. In still other rituals, the divine being is conducted to a small throne, in an ordinary but purified room, from which it gives oracles or provides a powerful guiding presence (e.g., 1.293-347; cf. 1.74-90), just as in the throne room of a major temple complex. These quite typical procedures within the Greek Magical Papyri suggest that the practitioner's \"clean room\" and the rituals per-formed therein are to be understood, to no small degree, as re-placements of (and for) temple space and rituals. Alternatively, while the small shrines resemble the portable naiskoi commonly carried in religious processions, the little shrines, ritual implements, small statues and ritual practices have their closest parallels, as Fritz Graf has convincingly argued, in small-scale, private, domestic rituals conducted by ordinary house-holders for their household deities and/or ancestors20 (a compari-son that deserves further detailed study). From this point of view, the domestication of ritual has already occurred. What is different about the Greek Magical Papyri is that these practices have been divorced from a familial setting, becoming both highly mobile and professionalized. 20 F.

One further matter. If one reads through the entire corpus with an eye towards ritual activities, it is not purification, nor incuba-tion, nor even sacrifice that predominates. Rather, the chief ritual activity within the Greek Magical Papyri appears to be the act of writing itself The vocabulary of inscription constitutes one of the larger groups. Alongside the evident concern for the accurate transmission of a professional literature marked, among other features, by scribal glosses and annotations is an overwhelming belief in the efficacy of writing, especially in the recipes which focus on the fashioning of amulets and phylacteries—themselves, miniaturized, portable, powerful written texts of papyrus, metal, stone and bone. The most common writing material is a sheet of papyrus, often described as \"clean,\" \"pure,\" \"choice,\" or \"hieratic.\" While blood and other magica materia occasionally function as writing fluids (most dramatically, VIII.70-72), most of the inks, some of which are quite complex, are variants of the common, everyday combi-nation of a burnt substance for pigment (e.g., charcoal, soot, lampblack) and a gum as a fixative. The most frequent combina-tion is \"myrrh ink\" (smurnomelan, or zmurnomelan). The technology of ink mimics the technology of the vegetable sacrifice, with burning and aromatic gums serving as their common denominators: The (preparation of the) ink is as follows: In a purified container, burn myrrh, cinquefoil, and wormwood; grind them to a paste and use them (11.36; cf. 1.244-46). Within the corpus, the instructions for the preparation of ink are often given a liturgical rubric, skeuē melanos (e.g., 1.243; IV.3199; VII.998), at times in immediate juxtaposition to the rubric for the sacrificial offering. The ritual of writing is more than a replacement of the archaic temple as a major site of scribal activities and library of ritual books—although, at times, use is made of the familiar motif of allegedly finding a book or spell in a prestigious temple, as in one of the older, surviving papyri, CXXII.1-4.

The miniature always tends towards exaggeration—it is a selection of detail that magnifies detail in the same movement by which it reduces detail.23 If ritual, with its characteristic strategies for achieving focus, with its typical concern for \"microadjustment,\" often is, itself, a miniaturization that is, at one and the same time, an exaggeration of everyday actions, as major theorists of ritual from Freud to Lévi-Strauss have rightly maintained,24 then miniaturization, when applied to ritual, as is the case in the Greek Magical Papyri, be-comes a sort of ritual of ritual, existing, among other loci, in a space best described as discursive or intellectual.25 21 C.

This is an attitude which should be adopted with more caution than is customarily the case. The term magic belongs primarily to our own intellectual tradition, where it has been handed down through the teaching of the church to those people (often missionaries) who detected magic among the \"savage\" non-Western peoples, and from them to the fathers of social and religious anthropology. It is no surprise, then, that in the past not a few anthropologists contended that magic was an ethnocentric concept whose helpfulness when applied outside of Western societies would be highly questionable3—though that might be an all too naive Whorfian approach. This essay does not intend to renew the debate, nor will it really enter into the related subject of how to define magic in ancient societies. Henk Versnel recently asserted that any definition other 1 This paper takes up some ideas which are more fully treated in my La magie dans l'antiquité gréco-romaine.

This development would influence deeply our own modern conception of magic. * * # Some lexicological considerations may serve as a starting point for larger issues. Ancient Greek had several terms to denote magic and the magicians: magos (and mageia), goes (and g0ēteià), agurtēs, and terms deriving from pharmakon. Most are attested early; only the terms related to magos seem comparably recent. Magos appears for the first time in a Greek text of the end of the 6th century BCE and becomes more frequent during the classi-cal period; it is a non-Greek word with an indisputed origin in the religious language of Persia,5 where the magos is a priest or relig-ious specialist.6 Herodotus is the first to speak about the magoi, as a tribe or secret society (Herodotus is somewhat ambiguous here) whose members perform the royal sacrifices and the funeral rites and who practice divination and the interpretation of dreams.7 A generation later, Xenophon calls them \"technicians in matters divine.\"8 Plato takes over this ethnographic definition in the Major Alcibiades when, speaking about the instruction of a young Persian nobleman, he gives a list of his foremost teachers, among them one who \"teaches the art of the magoi (mageia) which derives from Zoroaster, the son of Oromasdes: it comprises the 4 H.

The first attestation of the term is found already in the fragments of Hera-clitus of Ephesus, himself a subject of the Persian King of Kings. Clement of Alexandria cites the text: \"To whom does Heraclitus of Ephesus prophesy? To those who err in the night—to the magoi, the bacchants, the maenads, the mystai... : to all those he threatens tortures after death, he threatens the fire, since what people think to be mysteries are impious deeds.\"11 The slightly aberrant semantics of magos, which in Clement's time could only mean \"sorcerer,\" guarantees the authenticity: in the list, the magoi range among adherents of different ecstatic cults, especially Dionysian ones, strange company for a wizard and sorcerer. Magos, then, must mean something else in this text, one of those itinerant priests whom Plato calls \"seers and begging priests\" (manteis kai agurteis) and which the Derveni Papyrus, an intrigu-ing document from about 320 BCE, calls \"professionals of rit-ual,\"12 specialists, that is, for secret and private rituals and initia-tions. Because their rituals are secret and mysterious, they are called nuktipoloi, \"erring in the night.\" To an Ionian of the late 6th century BCE, a magos was not so much a wizard as a ritual specialist at the margins of society, with wide-ranging functions, ridiculed by some, secretly dreaded by many others.13 Half a century later, the word is used with the same semantics by Sophocles, in his Oedipus Turannos (397ss). Oedipus is angry about Creon and the seer Tiresias (whom he believes to be Creon's creature): furiously, he calls the seer \"this magos, plotter of 9 Plato, Alc.mai. 122 A. 10 Apuleius, Metamorph. 25, 10; Philostratus, vita Apollonii 1, 26. Among Renaissance Neoplatonist magicians, this became a topos in order to justify their interest in magic; see Zambelli (1991), 27. 11 Heraclitus, DK 12 Β 14, from Clement, Protr. 22,2. 12 Plato, Rep. 364 B; papyrus from Derveni: Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epieraphik 47 (1982): col. 16, 3s. 13 For these itinerant priests, see W.

The same two terms, mantis and agurtēs, appear in Plato's Republic (2,364B): manteis kai agurtai visit the doors of the rich and convince them \"that they would possess a faculty which they obtained from the gods though sacrifices and incanta-tions, to heal them through joy and feasts in case their ancestors or they themselves had committed some injustice; and in case they would like to harm an enemy, they would be able, at low cost, to injure righteous people as well as unrighteous ones through some incantation and defixion because they were able, as they brag about, to persuade the gods to help them.\" The passage is very signifi-cant: it presents a religious specialist who combines initiation into private mystery cults with \"black magic.\" To heal the conse-quences of injustice is one of the aims of private \"Orphic\" and Bacchic mystery cults. From Plato to a fragment of Orpheus cited in Olympiodoros, psychic troubles (mania) are viewed as resulting from the crimes of ancestors, and what heals them are purificatory rituals (katharmoi kai teletai) in Plato and mystery rites (orgia) in Orpheus. These manteis kai agurtai are the prophets and initiators of Bacchic mystery rituals.14 If one remembers that, in those circles, the ritual rested upon a complicated eschatology with rewards and punishments in the after-life, the passage of Heraclitus becomes highly ironic: the philosopher threatens those performing initiations with the same punishments from which they claimed to be able to free their clients. On the other hand, these same practitioners also are specialists in \"black magic,\" incantations and defixiones, which are intended to hurt an enemy. They are, thus, specialists also in those rites which we discern behind the many defixiones from Athenian wells and graves, the Attic voodoo dolls, some of which were detected in an archeological context contemporary to Plato.15 Another aspect of this usage of magos is its combination with goes. A goes is a complicated figure, combining ecstasy and ritual lament, healing rites and divination; the goës has been connected with the world of the shamans.16 But this connection would belong 14 Plato, Phaedr. 244e; Orphicorum Fragmenta no. 232 Kern. 15 See Chr. A. Faraone, \"Talismans, Voodoo Dolls and Other Apotropaic Statues in Ancient Greece\" (diss., Stanford University, 1988). 16 W. Burkert, \"Goes. Zum griechischen Schamanismus,\" Rheinisches Mu-seum 105 (1962): 36ss."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"rather to prehistory. Plato, in his Symposium, connects the goes with the phenomena which interest us here: Eros, according to Plato, is the intermediary between the divine and the human world, \"therefore, divination belongs to him entirely and the devices of those priests who occupy themselves with sacrifices, initiations, incantation and with every sort of divination and sorcery (goeteia).\"17 Here, Plato collects all those rituals which have to do with the passage between the human and the divine realm, without taking notice of their widely differing valuation in society. In other passages, the goes is nearly as badly regarded as the magos. Menon, in the dialogue named after him, blames Socrates for having him \"enchanted and drugged and totally bewitched.\" Socra-tes, he continues, must have been happy to live in Athens, because in many other Greek poleis he would have been arrested and ac-cused of being a sorcerer (goes).1* Athens, we learn incidentally, had less severe legislation against sorcery than other Greek cities— this might explain the amount of defixiones and voodoo-dolls found in 5th and 4th century BCE Athens. Only much later, in his Laws, Plato pleads for the introduction of severe laws against those \"who, having lost their humanity, think that the gods do not exist or that they were careless or venal and who despise their fellow human beings and seduce (psuchagāgāsi) many of the living by pretending that they could seduce (psuchagogein) the souls of the dead, and promise to persuade the gods through the magic of of-ferings and prayers and incantations (thusiais kai euchais kai epôidais goëteuein), thus proposing, in order to make money, to destroy individuals, families and entire cities.\" We have here the same three activities already mentioned in the Republic: (1) se-ducing the soul of the living and the dead, (2) healing the rich from the consequences of their own misdeeds and of those of their ancestors and, (3) practicing sorcery by means of divine help obtained through rituals at least partly parallel to the polis rituals (sacrifices and prayers) and, more specifically magical, through incantations. To the old Plato, thus, all these religious practices which the begging priests and marginal mystagogues performed well outside the world of polis religion were punishable offenses. The reason is clear: the sorcerer is seen as a danger to the polis comparable to the atheos, one who denies the existence of the gods. Both jeop-ardize the just relation between human beings and gods. This would 17 Plato, Symp. 202 E. 18 Plato, M en ο 80 Β."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"cause the loss of what is specifically human—therefore, Plato calls the sorcerer thēriādēs, \"beastlike,\" with a term used to characterize precultural humankind, from the theories of Prodicus, Plato's senior, to late Greek philosophy.19 The combination, finally, of goëteia and mageia occurs for the first time with Gorgias, in his Encomium of Helena. Here, the sophist speaks about the power of rhetorically effective words: \"The ecstatic incantations of words bring joy and drive away gloom; because, when the power of incantation enters our soul with the help of belief, it charms and persuades and transforms the soul through goetic art. There are two techniques of goetic and magic art (goëteia kai mageia): both are the error of the soul and the illusion of belief.\" Magic is an art of deception, and the power of incantation rests on illusion—the negative connotations are evi-dent. In the context of the text, this makes perfect sense: Gorgias intends to exonerate Helen from the charge of adultery by pre-senting her as an innocent victim of Paris' overpowering magical persuasion. To serve this end, flattering persuasion and magical incantation are identified—in other contexts, Gorgias is perfectly able to differentiate the two.20 This somewhat condensed analysis of Greek terminology of sor-eery—goes; agurtës; mageia·, goeteia; mageuein; goëteuein— yields interesting results: (1) What this lexical complex denotes is not identical to what we would call magic in our contemporary definition. The Greek terminology connects private mystery rituals with initiatory sacrifices as well as divination and sorcery; their common denomi-nator is that they do not belong to civic religion. (2) The evaluation is ambiguous. Heraclitus and Plato despise both magic and the mysteries, in the name of a spiritualized con-ception of religion and the divine which they share but which is somewhat at odds with religious tradition. On the other hand, there were those Athenian citizens of the upper classes who believed in the efficacy of magic and who therefore used the services offered by the seers and begging priests; and the vast majority of Atheni-ans must have shared their attitude. On a more panhellenic level, one discerns a difference in the juridical assessment of these rituals: in classical times, there were many Greek poleis in which sorcery 19 Plato, legg. 10, 909 A. 20 Gorgias, DK 82 Β 11, 10. For rhetoric and magic, see Jaqueline de Romilly, Magic and Rhetoric in Ancient Greece (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1975)."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"was severely punished. Plato joins this negative assessment, not for juridical reasons, but from a more severe theological position. Thus, we see that the Frazerian dichotomy between magic and religion is already present in Heraclitus and in Plato: in the Laws, goëteia is characterized by the intention to persuade the gods, while the proper conduct would be to leave them free choice; they know better than we what will prove useful to us. This comes close to Frazer's view that magic forces the gods, while religion prays submissively. Keith Thomas had argued that the Frazerian dichot-omy had its roots in Protestant theology of the 17th century21; even though correct, this is somewhat shortsighted, since the dichotomy is deeply entrenched in the continuum of our cultural heritage. * * * Among all those terms, only magos and related terms are not attested before the 6th century BCE. Goes, a word without a good Greek pedigree, preserves traces of more archaic functions well attuned to its etymology: it derives from goos, ritual lament, and the goës is a socially marginal figure connected with the passage of the dead between the worlds. At least in Aeschylus, he is the one who calls the souls from their graves, which can be seen as an inversion of the more usual function implied in goos,22 to accom-pany the dead to their grave. Goes then must have a long past existence in Greece, although its first literary attestation does not predate that of magos. Thus the term which was to displace all concurring terms, the Persian word magos (and its family of terms), is the most recent one, introduced in the 5th century BCE. To Greeks and Romans alike, the new word never lost its original association: mageia always was the art of the Persian priests. But already in the later 4th century BCE, this art has lost its historically correct relations with Persian ethnological realities. A fragment of Pseudo-Aristotle's dialogue Magikos points to this development: here the author opposes the then current view that mageia was sorcery, in the name of objective ethnography, asserting instead that \"the 21 K. Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic. Studies in Popular Beliefs in Sixteenth and Seventeenth Century England (London: Weidenfeld & Nicol-son, 1971); see his \"An anthropology of religion and magic Π,\" The Journal of Interdisciplinary History 6 (1975): 91-109. 22 Aeschylus, Pers. 687."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"magoi do not know magical sorcery\"; the ethnographer judges this a defamation of Persian religion. He is not alone in Plato's school in doing this: the above mentioned definition of mageia in the First Alcibiades (therapeia ton theon, \"service of the gods\") must have had the same polemical purpose. Magic as something practiced by the priests of the Persians means not only a foreign, exotic and barbarian practice, it also means a practice emphatically opposed and hostile to the Greek tradition. Its appearance in 5th century Athens goes together with other signs for self-demarcation towards foreigners or outright xenophobia.23 It also fits into a much wider mental structure which has been pointed out by Tylor: in many different cultures, sorcery and magic were thought to be the art of the hostile (or feared) neighbors and were named accordingly, from \"primitive\" and ancient Near Eastern cultures to the contemporary Swedes.24 Thus, the term magos originated not so much from real obser-vation of Persian religion or from the presence of Persian priests on Greek soil, but from the desire to designate certain ritual and ideological attachments as foreign, unwanted, and dangerous, from inside Greek (or Athenian) religion, not from outside it. * * * To understand the forces behind what was going on when the Ionians and Athenians coined the term \"Persian priests,\" magoi, for those religious specialists, one has to look back at the role magic and related phenomena played in Archaic Greece. Again, terminology is helpful. Among the earliest terms is pharmakon and its verb pharmat-tein. In Archaic Greece, the word is not confined to what we would call magic. Helen uses an Egyptian pharmakon to drive away the gloomy mood of Menelaos and Telemachos, and Circe transforms Ulysses' crew into swine with the help of a pharmakon.25 Ancient scholars already explained this by referring to witchcraft, and seen from their much later point of view, they might be right; but to the members of Homeric society, these pharmaka were potent drugs with supernatural, \"magical\" effects, but they were not used 23 See Edith Hall, Inventing the Barbarian (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989); R. Garland, Introducing New Gods (London: Duckworth, 1992), 145-50. 24 E. B. Tylor, Primitive Culture. Researches Into the Development of My-thology, Philosophy, Religion, Art and Custom (London: John Murray, 1873), 1.113-17. 25 Helen: Homer, Od. 4,221; Circe: ibid. 10, 388ss."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"for sorcery and witchcraft. The same word indicates a drug for healing wounds or for poison which ends a life in an unexpected way; Ulysses has to find a pharmakon to poison his arrows, and the suitors are afraid that Telemachos went away to procure him-self a pharmakon which could kill them secretly.26 Again, here we see substances whose effect goes beyond ordinary power—but here, we would categorize them not as magical but as medical or crimi-nal. Another Homeric term is epa0idē/ep0idē, \"incantation,\" a ver-bal utterance with supernatural effect. The only Homeric attesta-tion values it positively: Ulysses' uncles use an epaoidê to stop the bleeding from his wound after he has been attacked by a boar. The word keeps its healing connotations as late as Plato, who uses it in long lists of medical therapies, drugs, burning, cutting, and incanta-tion.27 Plato also knows its negative \"magical\" connotation, but in his time, the differentiation between magical and scientific medi-cine has barely begun. Thus, in Archaic Greece, no differentiation is made in the wider sphere of sorcery, healing and surreptitious killing. A myth told as late as Pindar, in his 4th Pythian Ode of 462 BCE, confirms this. Pindar narrates the well-known myth of how Jason seduced the young Medea in Kolchis and adds an otherwise unattested detail: in order to attain his goal, Jason used erotic magic, in a ritual which made use of a well-attested magical wheel, the iynx. If the descrip-tion of an epic hero taking refuge in magic would strike us as odd, even more so does the etiological myth which Pindar narrates: Jason had been taught this magical art by none other than Aphro-dite; for Jason, the goddess \"brought the first time the mad bird (the iynx) to men and taught incantations and prayers to the wise son of Aison.\" Pindar tells a myth about the origin of a specific item of our present culture. Aphrodite taught Jason erotic magic, as Dionysus had taught the use of wine to Icarius, and as Demeter taught the cultivation of domestic crops to Triptolemos. The myth tells its story quite neutrally, and we do not seem faced with something special or even unwanted. Erotic magic is just an inte-gral part of the archaic cultural outfit.28 26Healing: Homer, Iliad 4,190. 11,846. 13,392; Od. 4,230. 11,741. 22,94; Odysseus: Od. 1,261; the suitors: Od. 2,329. 27 Odysseus: Od. 19,450s.; Plato: Rep. 426 B; see also Pindar, Pyth. 4,217; Sophocles, Aias 582. 28 Pindar, Pyth. 4,213ss.

Even more, this change results from the constitution of what will finally be, in our Western cultural matrix, the province of magic as opposed to religion. This development in terminology corresponds to a major change in religious mentality, the evolution of magic (or rather mageia) as an autonomous domain among religious phenomena. In Greece, there were two main forces at work to bring about this change of paradigm. One of these forces is the development of what we would call a philosophical theology, already discussed in the analysis of Plato. In traditional cosmology and theology, there was no doubt that communication between humans and gods (or rather, between humans and the superhuman forces, the daimones, heroes, theoi) was easy. Humans were able to communicate with them through ritual; sacrifice and prayer persuaded the gods to help human beings fulfill their aims. Criticism of this view began in the generation of Heraclitus. The Ephesian philosopher censured traditional ritual practices, not only those of the mystery cults and of the magoi, but also traditional purification and Bacchic ritual, which to him were either blasphemous or obscene, or both.29 Plato was even more explicit. In the Laws, he counts the sorcerers among those who think that the gods either do not exist or are careless and mercenary, a belief which contradicts the Platonic concept of divinity as pure good, as a supreme being which cares for human-kind in a perfect way and to which humankind surrenders happily. The other force at work is medical science, which also in the later 5th century begins to constitute itself as an autonomous domain. The key text for this development is the treatise On the Sacred Disease, whose author, an unknown Hippocratean physi-cian from the late 5th century, vehemently opposes the idea that epilepsy (the \"sacred disease\") had supernatural causes. The physi-cian attacks on two fronts. On the one hand, he opposes the traditional etiology of the disease as resulting from divine interfer-ence and possession. He accuses \"men like the sorcerers {magoi), purification priests (kathartai), begging priests (agurtai) and quacks (alazones) of today\" to have brought forward this religious expia-29 Heraclitus, DK 12 Β 15, 5."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"nation \"in order to hide their own weakness\" in healing it. The religious explanation of epilepsy is just a pretense of bungling quacks. Even more, this explanation is a fraud: \"By inventing this explanation, they pretend to know more, and they deceive people (exapatösi anthröpous) by prescribing purificatory and cathartic rituals.\"30 Therefore, they do not adhere to true religion (eusebeia), but to a punishable aberration (asebeia), a sort of atheism. Platoיs position in the Laws springs to mind: the physi-cian embraces the same spiritualized theology as Plato or, before him, Heraclitus. He persists on this accusation: the priests pretend to be able to influence the course of nature through their magical sacrifices (mageuön kai thuon), but by doing so they make claim to powers which belong to the gods only, to powers superior even to those of the gods, since they claim to be able to force the gods and to use them like their slaves. \"Thus, to me, they seem to be impious and to suppose that there are no gods,\" since the divine defines itself as absolutely superior to any human being.31 There is a second line of attack within ancient medical science. The therapy of the physicians makes use of the same rationality as that of the seers: both first observe the symptoms, in order to arrive at the adequate therapy. But the two sorts of therapists start from different symptoms and therefore arrive at different thera-pies. The cathartic priests, who understand epilepsy as spirit pos-session, look for signs which would allow them to recognize the superhuman power at work in the patient: if he should bleat like a goat, it is the Mother of the Gods who is responsible; if he should neigh like a horse, it would be Poseidon. All this is perfectly within the laws of causality: the divine agent is recognized by a sound of a sacred animal which in turn reveals the divine agent at work. This immediately leads to therapy: one possessed by the Mother of the Gods has to abstain from all the products of the goat, from its milk, its cheese, and its leather. To this, physicians oppose their own etiology, which starts from the bodily functions and is based in a series of somatic observations, and from them the physicians recommend a particular medical therapy. What separates the seer and the physician is not rationality but cosmology. Whereas for the seer the disease is the result of divine intervention, for the physician all diseases have natural causes. 30 Pseudo-Hippocrates, De morbo sacro 4. See esp. G. E. R.

Concomitantly, on the level of theology, people are not able to penetrate into the divine world. Thus, two intellectual developments in the Greek world caused magic to become a proper domain inside religion, a domain attrib-uted to specialists, magoi, goëtes, agurtai: the rise of philosophical theology as a radicalization and purification of traditional, civic theology, and the rise of scientific medicine, based on the concep-tion of nature as a homogeneous and closed system. Both of these developments have a similar result: they stress the separation between the world of nature (humans included) and the divine realm. Philosophers and physicians become the enemies of the sorcerers, and magos, in this debate, becomes a term of polemic and denigration. Three final remarks come to mind: (1) Once again, one has to underline that we have to do with more than what is commonly called magic: the philosophical and medical opposition concerns an entire set of ritual practices and beliefs outside civic religion—Bacchic mysteries, private ecstasy rituals, purifications, and \"black magic.\" (2) The opposition to magic has nothing to do with civic relig-ion. It is not the polis which opposes the magoi, it is on the con-trary a debate among marginals. Philosophers and physicians are barely less marginal towards the polis than itinerant priests: phi-losophers and physicians have their own associations, and philo-sophical theology is different and often at odds with civic theol-ogy. The towns can oppose magic, as the Menon passage demon-strates, but this opposition concerns only the damage done, never the entire complex of mageia which philosophers and physicians attacked. (3) Finally, we saw that the Frazerian opposition between magic and religion and the tendency to separate the two through their differing attachment towards the superhuman world is present already in Plato. We now see that the other Frazerian dichotomy, between magic and science, is present in the late 5th century: for the Hippocratic thinker, as for Frazer, magic and science share their rationality—but the magician starts from the wrong premises, and the Hippocratic thinker adds that the magoi constrain the"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"gods. Obviously, the Frazerian categories are not simply ethnocen-trie, they are so in very fundamental ways.32 * * * Before becoming our modern term \"magic,\" Greek mageia and magos had to become Latin magia and magus—terms which occur relatively late and at the same moment when consciousness of and reflection about magic as something essentially different sets in.33 First, in the age of Cicero, the terms denote Persian ethnographi-cal facts, as in Herodotus' Greek, and only later, in the famous history of magic in the 30th book of Pliny's Natural History, they signify more or less what we would call magic.34 In Republican Rome, as in Archaic Greece, magic was never thought as something special and radically different from religion or medicine. Already at the time of the Twelve Tablets, Roman authorities were opposed to sorcery, to incantamenta, \"spells\"— but only to those which threatened established rights of possession; there were other incantamenta used for healing which even the severe Cato recommended. And the law which Imperial Rome used against sorcery, the lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis (promulgated by the dictator Sulla in 81 BCE) was originally not aimed at sorcerers but at murderers: sicarii are those who kill openly, by force of a weapon, venefici are those who kill secretly, through poison or magic. Again, what we would call magic is not thought as something different. In contrast to Greece, it is more difficult to explain why, at about the time of the Emperor Augustus, Roman society started to differentiate between magic on the one hand and both religion and science on the other, in order to marginalize it. One important factor must have been the overwhelming influence of Greek thinking conspicuous in Pliny's account and in the invasion of 32 For another attestation of the dichotomy well before the age of the Refoima-tion, see Galeotto Marzio, \"Culturae et religionis nomen potius quam scientiae et magia et alchimia subibunt,\" in De doctrina promiscua, ed.

Ritner To set the stage for this discussion,11 would ask you to consider a recent advertisement for a volume entitled Religion, Science, and Magic: Every culture makes the distinction between \"true religion\" and magic. A particular action and its result may be termed \"miraculous\" while another is rejected as the work of the devil.2 The implications of this sweeping declaration are transparent: every society contrasts religion and magic, and religion produces miracles while magic is the work of a devil. While it is hardly fair to hold advertising copy to the critical standards of scholarship, the statement does express—quite succinctly—the traditional assumptions surrounding the concept of \"magic\" and those of the volume's editors.3 In scholarly discussions, just these assumptions have been held explicitly, or more often implicitly, since Sir James G. Frazer's Golden Bough of 1910.4 What is most clear, however, in this statement and its underlying assumptions is its Western bias (Greco-Roman and Judeo-Christian), assuming distinctions between 1This essay is an expanded adaptation of the author's note entitled \"Egyptian Magic: Questions of Legitimacy, Religious Orthodoxy and Social Deviance,\" published in Alan B.

In the following essay, I wish to confront such \"general theories of magic\" with the explicit evidence of Egypt, and see to what extent one may reasonably espouse universal definitions of magic. At the outset, a definition of \"magic\" is critical for any discus-sion of the problem since there is no consensus on the meaning of the term in English, leaving aside the wider problem of concepts equated with \"magic\" in other cultures. Most often, the English term is bandied about as if an implicit consensus existed, yet this can easily be proved to be false, not only by widespread contempo-rary scholarly disagreement on the topic, but by the unstandardized ways in which the term has been used historically.5 Thus, the Romans prosecuted the early Christians for practicing magic. In turn, the politically secure Catholic Church prosecuted pagan Romans for magic, only to be charged again with magic by schis-matic Protestant critics during the Reformation.6 Are we to believe that all these groups were accused of performing the same acts? Certainly not. The later Protestants thought the Catholics openly performed rites before idols, which is exactly what would have exonerated them from the charge of magic in the eyes of the Romans. Magic here is simply the religious practices of one group viewed with disdain by another. As in the quoted advertisement, the concept \"magic\" serves to distinguish \"us\" from \"them,\" but it has no universal content. Your religion is my magic, and thus in English, Africa has no priests but \"witchdoctors.\" Any under-standing of the Western concept of magic must acknowledge this inherent negative connotation and trace it to its roots: the Greek 5 For an overview of conflicting theories of magic, see W. Gutekunst, \"Zauber,\" in W. Helck and E. Otto, eds., Lexikon der Ägyptologie (Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1986), 6.1320-55.

The latter term goëteia, which originally may have described native priestly or shamanistic practices among the earliest Greeks, is consistently employed in historical periods to express \"trickery, fraud, hucksterism,\" or \"evil sorcery.\" At odds with contemporary cult, goëteia was no longer religion, whatever its origins. By con-trast, the term mageia (> English \"magic\") originally designated the alien religious practices of Medean priests, the Magi. By the 3rd century BCE, however, Aristotle uses mageia and goëteia as comparable expressions, and though the original meaning as \"Persian religion\" survives, mageia had been popularly stigmatized as alien \"non-religion,\" or \"magic.\"8 In post-Socratic philosophi-cal circles, mageia was held to make use of good daimones (spirits lower than the gods of religion), while goëteia utilized evil dai-mones, thus producing the categories of good and evil (\"white\" and \"black\") magic. In Roman society, the cognate Latin category of magia underwent the same \"demonization\" as the Greek mageia, and subsumed as well the evil overtones of goëteia. Bequeathed to the Judeo-Christian world, these terms were readily serviceable, since all \"paganism\" was \"non-religion\" in the service of demons, not God. As a label for unacceptable or outmoded pseudo-religion, \"magic\" was equally useful for Reformation Protestants and early ethnographers. Modern Western terms for \"magic\" are all depend-ent upon this stemma of meanings, and function primarily as designations for that which we as a society do not accept, and which has overtones of the supernatural or the démonic (but not of the divine). It is important to stress that this pejorative connota-tion has not been grafted onto the notion of magic as the result of any recent theoretical fancy, but is inherent in Western terminol-ogy virtually from its beginning. It constitutes the essential core of the Western concept of magic. 7 For the evolution of these terms, see Eugene Tavenner, Studies in Magic from Latin Literature (New York: Columbia University Press, 1916), 1-5; Morton Smith, Jesus the Magician (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1978), 69-74; idem, \"On the Lack of a History of Greco-Roman Magic,\" in Heinz Heinen, ed., Althistorische Studien, Hermann Bengston Festschrift, Historia Einzel-Schriften 40 (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1983), 251-57; and A.

Depending upon an individ-ual's predilection, the same text or act may be classified as \"magical,\" \"religious,\" or (most evasively) \"magico-religious.\"9 The problem, especially for secular scholars, has been to determine just what factors should constitute the unacceptable \"non-us,\" the necessary and sufficient quotient which separates magic from religion, medicine and science. In my own volume on Egyptian magical techniques, I adopted a specific working definition of magic from the modern Western perspective as comprising \"any activity which seeks to obtain its goal by methods outside the simple laws of cause and effect.\"10 This definition of \"magic\" is serviceable for analyzing elements of our own and other cultures from our cultural perspective; it does not, however, make any pretence of being universally valid from the perspectives of those other cultures. This is in direct contrast to most designations of magic, which proclaim universal applicability at all times and in all places. The oldest, and most common, 19th century \"universal\" défini-tion of magic was obtained by generalizing (Protestant) Judeo-Christian theological assumptions about piety vs. rote ritual, seen as a contrast between \"higher\" ethics vs. \"lower\" mechanistic practices. Best summarized by W. J. Goode in 1949, this approach distinguishes \"religion\" by the pious attitude of its practitioner, the humble supplications of its prayers, and the noble, all-inclusive world view of its rituals and theology.11 In contrast, \"magic\" demanded hubris and blasphemy of its devotees, its spells (not called prayers) did not beg but threatened, and its goals were imme-diate, limited and personal. This view still has its devotees and is cited with approval in David E. Aune's 1980 discussion of \"Magic in Early Christianity.\"12 As we shall see with regard to Egypt, problems with this definition are legion, not least because it re-quires the investigator to intuit subjectively the attitude of the ancient practitioner. This is not often easy or even possible. This approach is also of limited scholarly value as a descriptive tool, 9 See the references in R. Ritner, \"Horas on the Crocodiles,\" 103 n. 4. 10 R.

In any case, the posed dichotomy is clear: magic is outside of religion; it is inher-ently unorthodox. An alternate, sociological approach to defining a \"universal\" concept of magic is to be found in the early theories of Emile Dürkheim and Marcel Mauss, who generalize Latin legal codes and thus stigmatize magic as anti-social and illegal behavior.13 Seizing upon the latter characteristic, Jonathan Z. Smith, Peter Brown, and Morton Smith have argued that illegality is \"the one universal characteristic\" of magic.14 On the other hand, the notion of anti-social behavior was selected by David Aune, who views magic within the framework of recent studies on \"social deviance.\" Aune considers magic to be \"universally regarded as a form of deviant behavior,\" that is to say, \"conduct that departs significantly from the norms set for people in their social statuses.\"15 A similar distinction is assumed by Jacob Neusner, who opposes religion and magic as \"what is normative and what is aberrational in religious situations.\"16 Unlike the absolute theological categories posited by Goode, such theories do acknowledge the varying content of magic according to cultural bias (\"what I do is a miracle, but what you do is magic\").17 Like the previous theory, however, they assume that the distinction between magic and religion is itself universal. Again the dichotomies are clear; magic is not legal and not socially nor-mative. One final set of theories should be mentioned before addressing the Egyptian evidence, and those are the varying anthropological approaches. At base indistinguishable from theological approaches (higher piety vs. lower mechanics), the early work of Frazer fo-cused on its sympathetic character, adding the distinctions of homeopathic magic (like makes like) and contagious magic (items in contact form permanent bonds, i.e., act as relics).

E. Evans-Pritchard devised a new vocabulary sensitive to cultural distinctions based upon and devised for a single culture: the Zande of the Sudan. From Zande concepts Evans-Pritchard distinguished two forms of hostile magic: (1) the conscious performance of illegal rites and spells, and (2) mangu, an innate psychic emanation from an internal bodily substance which produces injury. The former he called \"sorcery,\" the latter \"witchcraft.\"19 Though expressly designed as a reaction against general theories of magic, Evans-Pritchard's terms have now been granted universal validity by his successors, and this ironic turn of events has produced the only \"universal\" theory of magic based on African preconceptions rather than Greco-Roman or Judeo-Christian ones.

Reminiscent of the Christian Logos of the Gospel of John, hki became embodied as a divine personality, Heka, and the recipient of a cult in his capacity as first emanation (ba) from the creator. All subsequent creation (the universe with its gods and men) was subject to this first-born son. As Heka himself states in an address to the gods in Coffin Text Spell 261, I am he whom the Unique Lord made before duality had yet come into being ... I am the son of Him who gave birth to the universe ... I am the protection of that which the Unique Lord has ordained ... I am he who gave life to the Ennead of gods ... I have come to take my position that I might receive my dignity, for to me belonged the universe before you gods had come into being. Down, you who have come afterward.

As for him who swallows/knows them, there am I.28 This statement contains within itself an example of the \"imagistic\" nature of the magical process, for the Egyptian word cm, \"to swallow,\" comes to mean \"to know.\" Thus, by the act of swallowing the dissolved ink of a text one acquires the reflex of the action, innate knowledge of the text's content.29 If the force of hki is to be understood as functioning through \"consecrated im-agery,\" then it would represent the fundamental principle underly-ing all orthodox temple cult, indeed all ritual—whether state or private, public or clandestine. The same force would be felt to animate both beneficent and hostile \"magic\" as well. Gods and demons both use hki; the term \"magician\" (hkiy) is morally neutral, equally applicable to heroes and villains, Egyptians and foreigners.30 It is significant that Re's acknowledgement of the true efficacy of spells appears within a context describing the work of hostile \"magicians.\" There is no distinction here of authentic \"miracle\" vs. debased or fraudulent \"magic.\" The \"imagistic\" process is shown repeatedly on Egyptian tem-pie reliefs in which the king's ritual presentation of food, diadems and prisoners is a reflection of the god's granting of life, prosper-ity, and victory, each object offered being a tangible image of its abstract counterpart.

It is the priesthood which composed, collected and performed rites and spells for both public and private ceremonies, not merely imitating gods, but becoming them. By an intricate series of consciously elaborated imagery, humans may exploit the powers of the primordial gods. The very notions of divinity and imagery are conjoined in Egyptian thought; the conventional term for \"god\" (njr) has as its root meaning \"image,\" as is revealed by an Old Kingdom relief from the tomb of Nefermaat that is now in the Oriental Institute Museum in Chicago.31 Gods, humans, animals, objects, actions, and words are all part׳ of a fluid continuum of projected divine images without sharp divisions. Humans in particular were formed from the creator's tears, are instructed to confront \"the god who is within you,\"32 regularly become gods at death, and in exceptional cases during life. By virtue of this \"Great Chain of Being,\" humans are justified in equating themselves with one, several or all of the gods, and, following divine prototypes, may or must threaten other gods during ritual performance.33 This practice is without hubris (a specifically Greek cultural notion), and in complete orthodoxy. Such \"magic\" was the express gift of the creator, and a list of god's benefactions for humanity concludes the mention of the creation of heaven, earth, air, food and government by stating, It was in order to be weapons to ward off the blow of events that he (god) made magic for them (humanity).34 Consider the implications of this weapon in Pyramid Text Spell 539: 31 Oriental Institute Museum 9002; see W.

No term distinguished hostile from good magic, \"black\" vs. \"white.\"46 There was no devil for one, and god for another. The same principle was invoked; all was hki. Only when this weapon was directed against King Ramses III in a harem conspiracy (12th century BCE) do we have what has been called a \"trial for sorcery,\" but this was not a trial against sorcery per se, but a trial for treason.47 Had a sword been used as the weapon rather than wax dolls, the trial would have occurred nonetheless. The magical rite was hardly illegal in itself, since the culprit, a disaffected priest, was said to have acquired it from the royal archives.48 That the priest should practice such a rite entails no \"social deviance,\" no activity outside expected social norms. Act and actor are typical; it is only the recipient of the curse that distinguishes this case—the name consciously inserted in the stan-dard text. From the perspective of modern theories of \"witchcraft,\" this conscious nature of Egyptian hostile magic is significant. In 1980, a decade after appearing in Mesopotamian studies, Evans-Pritchard's Zande-inspired terminology was introduced to Egyp-tology to little purpose.49 Though Heka, like mangu or \"witchcraft,\" can be said to reside within the body, it is activated by special words, acts and ingredients. Only the late and présuma-bly imported notion of the \"evil eye\" approximates the innate evil of Zande mangu; otherwise \"Egyptian witchcraft\" is a category without content. As hostile magic need not be the \"work of the devil,\" so \"miracle\" need not be contrasted with \"magic.\" Indeed, the 45 S. Schott, Urkunden mythologischen Inhalts.

The same texts which promise safety from \"all evil magic\" (hkg nb jJW) also promise safety from \"every transgressing god\" (np~ nb th) ). As such gods include Horus, Osiris, etc., they are hardly inherently \"evil,\" but merely ill-disposed to their victim. \"Magic\" may be similarly \"ill-disposed,\" cf. I. E. S.

The manifestation of the god was addressed directly, and by appropriate signs or documents an oracular response was granted.56 Like other facets of Egyptian \"magic,\" the ph-nir was morally neutral.57 Thus, while the harem conspiracy against Ramses III was furthered by means of a ph-nir, royal workers under Ramses IX could be excused from work to attend a ph-nir, and the ceremo-nies increasingly became standard arbiters of justice, fully equiva-lent to a court of law. Magic is here not only legal, but the very author of legality. With the conquest of Egypt by Rome, however, a very different attitude prevailed, and the history of the ph-nir, and hki itself, takes a new turn. Rome long had a suspicious attitude toward foreign religious practices, as is evident from its well-known restrictions upon the imported cults of the Magna Mater, Isis, and Christianity. At-tempts to expel Egyptian religion from Rome were made in 59, 58, 53, and 48 BCE, and it was inevitable that Roman preconcep-tions would clash with Egyptian practice. The most direct expres-sion of this cultural conflict is found in a decree of Q. Aemilius Saturninus, prefect of Egypt under Septimius Severus, in 199 CE: [Since I have come across many people] who consider themselves to be beguiled by the means of divination [I quickly considered it necessary], in order that no danger should ensue upon their foolishness, clearly herein to enjoin all people to abstain from this hazardous (or \"misleading\") super-stition. Therefore, let no man through oracles, that is, by means of writ-ten documents supposedly granted in the presence of the deity, nor by means of the procession of cult images or suchlike charlatanry, pretend to have knowledge of the supernatural, or profess to know the obscurity of friture events. Nor let any man put himself at the disposal of those who enquire about this nor answer in any way whatsoever. If any person is detected adhering to this profession, let him be sure that he will be handed over for capital punishment.58 56 See J. Cerny, \"Egyptian oracles,\" in R. Parker, A Saite Oracle Papyrus from Thebes (Providence: Brown University, 1962), 35-48. 57 In company with \"ill-disposed\" hki (above, n. 46), the ph-nir can also be qualified as potentially \"unfavorable\" (b'm )to a client purchasing safety from every variety of misfortune; see Edwards, Oracular Amuletic Decrees of the Late New Kingdom, 39 (Papyrus BM 10587, 11. 90-98). 58 Papyrus Yale inv. 299, translation adapted from John Rea, \"A New Version of P.

Without any change in action or actors, a pious, religious arbiter of legality has become illegal superstition. The change is entirely one of cultural perspec-tive. As in Rome itself, the prohibition was unsuccessful, for in 359 an Egyptian oracle (of Bes at Abydos) again troubled Roman authority, prompting Constantius to decree a general abolition of oracles throughout the empire.59 Coptic evidence shows that even this attempt was without success.60 At the Theban temple of Luxor, the processional ceremony continues even today in the annual festival of the Moslem saint Abu el־Hagag. Nonetheless, official Roman condemnation did produce a sig-nificant change. The decree of Satuminusf whatever its immediate effect upon temple ritual, was but part of a larger pattern of re-strictive \"supervision\" by Roman authority over Egyptian theol-ogy, intrusions based upon a perceived priestly threat to Roman morals, social control, and financial dominance.61 The cumulative effect of many such \"supervisory\" restrictions was to cripple the traditional institution of the Egyptian temple.

Egyptian reaction to the Roman prohibition is epitomized in the second century Greek tale of Thessalos, a physician from Asia Minor who travelled to Upper Egypt to supplement his philo-sophical studies.64 Having sought out priests in Thebes, Thessalos asked them if anything remained of Egyptian magical power (τι της μαγικής ένεργείας) to conduct an audience with the gods or the dead. Although most appeared scandalized (φερόντων) by the ques-tion, one old priest agreed to conduct the rite with the aid of a bowl filled with water. After preparations and fasting, Thessalos was led to a secluded (temple?) room65 where in a vision he con-fronted Aesclepius/Imhotep who answered his questions. The techniques of this procedure (bowl, fasting, seclusion) accord per-fectly with those in contemporary \"private\" Demotic (and Greek) papyri. Traditionally, the priests' initial shock at the question of Thes-salos has been interpreted in light of Roman prohibitions of magic that entailed capital punishment for both performer and teacher. Jonathan Z. Smith, however, has argued that it is rather an indica-tion of their disbelief in the efficacy of magical power.66 This reinterpretation is unconvincing, given (1) the centrality of hki to Egyptian religion even in the latest periods (which would entail priests professing disbelief in the religion which they serve), (2) the severity of Roman punishment for magic, and (3) the fact that Thessalos was a stranger to the priests, and a foreign Greek stranger at that. The most likely interpretation would be that the priests were unwilling to risk capital punishment for imparting secret (and sacred) knowledge to a foreigner who could not be 63 Demotic examples appear in Papyrus Louvre Ε 3229, cols. 6/6, 6/11, 6/26, and 7/13; and in the Demotic Magical Papyrus of London and Leiden, cols. 4/3, 8/12,27/29, and 28/32-33. 64 A.

Smith's suggestion of priestly disbelief was intended to bolster his contention that the epiphany in this text represents a reversal of the traditional priestly/temple context in favor of \"temporary sacrality sanctified by a magician's power.\"67 This is not correct. The rite may well have taken place in a temple, and the magician responsible for the vision was definitely not Thessalos, but the traditional Egyptian priest trained in traditional temple practice. Fear of Roman punishment for magia may have made the priests wary and the rite secretive, but the ph-n]r experienced by Thes-salos was still administered by an Egyptian priest as an orthodox religious rite.68 Despite imperial sanctions, Egyptian and Roman conceptions of \"magic\" did not merge until the Coptic period, when Christian hostility stigmatized all pagan practices—Roman as well as Egyp-tian—with the derogatory magia. With the abandonment of its native religion, Egypt might maintain its religious vocabulary, but not its religious perspective. The cultural gulf which separates hki from £IK is paralleled by that which divides Egyptian Imnt.t, the abode of Osiris and the blessed dead, from Coptic όολ€ΜΤ€, the devil's hell. Stripped of its ancient theological significance, Coptic 2,iK was now reduced to a designation for alien and demonic relig-ion, at once illegal, unorthodox, and socially deviant. The irony of this designation, and its innate limitations, could not be clearer. By regularly casting disparate concepts together as an expression for \"non־us,\" the label of \"magic\" tells us far more about the cultural biases of the society which applies it than it does about the practices to which it is applied. There can be no univer-sal concept of magic precisely because \"magic\" is a Western con-cept, laden with \"our\" innate value judgments. As a term for de-fining what we do not accept, it can be useful, but the content of magic, that which comprises \"what it is we do not accept,\" cannot be generalized to other cultures. Egyptian hki was a most complex theological concept; only the superimposition of Christian theol-ogy demoted it to \"magic.\" Magic and hki are fundamentally incompatible notions. Hki is a category of inclusion, defined by 67 J. Z. Smith, ibid., 182. 68 Cf. also the temple-sponsored incubation vision of Aesclepius/Imhotep recorded in Papyrus Oxyrhynchus XI. 1381 (equally 2d century), translated in Frederick C.

One must always be on guard against the underlying social biases of classification lest we, in the words of the 16th century philoso-pher Giordano Bruno, \"in vain attempt to contain water in nets and catch fish with a shovel.\"69 Bruno had attempted to defend Egyptian religion from the charges of \"superstition\" and \"magic\"; his recommendation went unheeded. Bruno himself was burned for heresy, the conceptual stepchild of \"magic,\" connoting illegality, unorthodoxy, and social deviance. As a concept, \"heresy\" provides a convenient and useful schol-arly category. One may meaningfully study the elements and effects of heresy, the methods by which a society defines it and reacts to it. Yet none would assume the existence of a universal approach to the concept. What might constitute \"heresy\" is clearly not identical within the competing Christian denominations alone, not to mention the distinct systems of Judaism or Islam. Indeed, for non-dogmatic religions the very notion of \"heresy\" would be either meaningless or irrelevant. The inherent bias of this category has long been recognized.

Beal From approximately 1800 to 1175 BCE the Hittites were one of the great kingdoms of the ancient Near East, ruling much of Anatolia and often Syria, and successfully holding their own against such kingdoms as Egypt, Assyria and Babylonia.1 Their records are preserved on cuneiform tablets, largely excavated from the royal archives at the site of their capital Hattusa, modem Bogazkale. Alongside annals, treaties, letters, instructions, land-deeds, litera-ture, prayers, oracular results and festival instructions are found numerous magic rituals devoted to such diverse subjects as birth, healing, impotence, insomnia, counter-magic, family dissension, building, and infertile grapevines. Some are well preserved, some poorly preserved. It is not my aim here to discuss Hittite magical techniques2 but rather the use made of magic in one important aspect of Hittite life: the military. I shall list and discuss the vari-ous rituals employed by the army to deal with the situations that it would encounter during the course of doing its duty to preserve the Hittite state.3 When soldiers were inducted into the Hittite army, they and/or their junior officers had to take an elaborate oath. In actions and in words, soldiers subjected themselves to a series of conditional curses that would take effect if they were disloyal. Here is a quota-tion from such an oath: \"[The officiant] places wax and mutton-fat into their hands. Then he throws them into a fire, and says, 'As this wax melts and mutton-fat fries, so may he who breaks the oath and deceives the Hittite king melt like wax and fry like mut-1 I wish to thank H. A.

The oathtaker subjected himself to potential punishment by holding, touching or licking the objects used in the analogy, thus establishing a physical link between himself and the oath. The whole exercise was simul-taneously explained with words. The words of the oath were also linked to the troops by having them orally add, \"So be it.\" The multiple punishments of the person who broke the oath were usually seen as being carried out by \"oath-deities\" or by the oaths themselves, although sometimes \"the Stormgod,\" \"the Moongod\" or \"the gods of Hatti\" were asked to carry out the punishment. In the briefer paragraphs the punisher is not mentioned; if compara-tive evidence is any indication, the objects used in the oath cere-mony would have been capable, by themselves, of enforcing the oath.9 The analogies that we have seen above were to wax and mutton-fat, melting in heat, conveying a threat of melting; a broken arrow and the wearing of women's clothing and the carrying of women's stereotypical objects: spindle and distaff conveying a threat of being turned into women; and a figurine of a man with swollen belly and filled with water conveying a threat of looking like this due to disease. Other oaths in the same text include an analogy to a blind and a deaf man; to a figurine (?) thrown face-down on the ground and squashed underfoot; to the crackling of rock-salt and sinews thrown into a fire; to the grinding, cooking and mashing of the malt and grains used in making beer—the malt here and the salt in the previous example do double duty since it is also pointed out that they cannot reproduce. There is also an analogy to yeast in breadmaking, with the threat that disease will make the oath-breaker crumble and puff up; and to a bladder-balloon squashed underfoot and emptied of air, with the threat that the oath-breaker's house will similarly be emptied of people and animals.

Broken sections involve torches, cedar splints, oxhide, clay and the smashing of jars.11 Before a campaign, the officers were given magical help. Ac-cording to the ritual of Azzari, the Hurrian female physician, she would recite an incantation over some fine oil and then anoint with it the commanding \"lord of the army,\" his horses, his chariot and implements of war.12 There was also a long ritual called \"When the soldiers go away from the land to campaign and [they go] to the enemy land to fight.\" In this ritual, the practitioner lights a fire in the plain, sacrifices bread and wine and summons the gods to eat and drink.

[On the one] of cedar we placed the name of the enemy of His Majesty, but on the one of clay [we put] the name of Hismi-Sarruma.\" The figures were presumably both thrown into a fire, whereupon the cedar figure of the enemy burned up while the clay figure of the Hittite was baked solid.15 The Hittites had a strong concept of the just war; only if one's cause was legitimate would the gods give one victory in battle. By throwing both figurines into the fire, both underwent a sort of trial by fire. In this way, the war was symbolically transformed into a judicial ordeal by battle in which the injured party (the Hittites) was vindicated and the ag-gressors (the enemy) were found guilty and punished. When the army reached the enemy's land, another ritual would be performed, in which the Hittites presented to the gods a legal justification for the war, together with a number of offerings. \"They sacrifice one sheep to Zithariya.

Although no texts mention it, one can presume, based on records of other wars, that military camps could be as hazardous for the troops as actual combat and that, during prolonged sieges, more people, both besiegers and besieged, would have died of disease than from battle. At least six different rituals attempted magically to rid army camps of devastating diseases and to pass them to the enemy. The best preserved is Ashella's ritual. This ritual begins in the army camp in the evening. The generals and colonels each are given a ram and white, red, and green strands of yam. The exorcist braids the yarn into a single strand for each officer and attaches a bead and rings of iron and lead. The officers each tie their yarn to their rams' horns and necks. Then they tie the rams up in front of their tents for the night, orally promising them to whatever deity is causing the plague. The next morning the officers place their hands on the rams and recite, Whatever deity made this plague, now see—rams are standing. They are fat with liver, heart and limbs. Let the flesh of humankind then become distasteful to him. Be satisfied with these rams. An adorned woman is seated before the king's tent. Each ram is matched with a jug of beer and a loaf of thick-bread. The woman is matched with a jug and three loaves. The officers bow behind the rams and the king bows behind the woman. The rams and the woman, the thick-bread and the beer are carried through the army. The woman and the sheep are then encouraged to flee Hittite territory, while the soldiers say, \"What evil exists in the people, oxen, horses, mules and donkeys of this army—now, see those rams and woman have removed it from the army; whatever land meets them, let that one take this evil plague.\" The second day is spent in a different place in the plain sacri-ficing rams, billy goats, beer, bread, and various vessels, trying to get on the good side of the deity who caused the plague. The food is cooked and offered, and the deity summoned to see his or her dinner, to \"eat and drink like a deity\" and \"not forsake (a single) person.\" They abandon the knives used for the sacrifice, thus leaving behind the evil that they contain in the place where the sacrifice was performed. When they depart from the place of the ritual, they wash their hands in salty water and walk between two fires to wash and bum away residual evil. There is then a sacrifice of more billy goats, bread and wine to the Protective Deity of the Implements used and abandoned in the ritual earlier in the day. After this, all concerned eat and depart.

After this all concerned eat, drink and depart. At dawn on the fourth day, at yet another place on the plain, they sacrifice a bull and virgin ewe to the divine pair of the Hittite pantheon, the Stormgod and the Sungoddess, and several sheep to all the other gods.20 In this ritual, by means of various colors of wool, various strands of the evil were transferred from the officers to the ram.21 By spending the night in the camp, the ram absorbed yet more evils. Other evils were transferred when the officers put their hands on the rams and bowed to them. Finally, carrying the rams, the woman, bread and beer through the army was intended to draw out evil from the rest of the army. When the participants drove the rams and woman across the border, the evil now resident in the rams and the woman was commanded to leave Hatti and go to the enemy. It is interesting to note that the rams were matched one to one with each high officer, with an even tastier morsel matched with the king. Was each animal (or woman) intended to serve as a personal substitute for one of the commanders and the king? or, was the woman a scapegoat for the army as a whole, and did the rams take the evils of each individual regiment/brigade? or were all of the above true? While serving as scapegoats, the same rams (and woman) simultaneously served as a sacrifice to propitiate the god who had caused the plague in the first place. The efficacy of this procedure was assured by further offerings and prayers to the deity who had caused the plague. The intent of the sacrifices to the chief gods of the pantheon and to all the other gods on the last day was presumably that these gods, by accepting their share of the sacri-fices, would agree to put social pressure on the god causing the plague so that he would desist and accept the sacrifices. Presumably it was also hoped that the gods would act as guarantors of the plague god's decision to terminate the plague. 20 (Text no. 11) A: KUB 9.32 +Bo 4445 (ZA 64:244); B: KUB 9.31 iii 14ff.; C: HT 1 iii 1 - iv 43; D: KUB 41.18 ii 2-iii; E: KUB 41.17 iii-iv 25; F: KBo 13.212 rev.; G: FHL 95; H: 218/q = CTH 394, edited and translated into Turkish by A.

The offer-ings are carried away, while the officiant says, \"See, I've brought you [foo]d (?), Ο deity, and I've brought food for your dogs.\" The same ritual is performed for any person whose tent is affected. The ritual is repeated on a second and probably on a third day as well.22 Apparently the image employed here is that of collecting up the day's table-scraps and throwing them out to the dogs lurking around the house. The scream of the woman presumably was part of the image of throwing out the table-scraps, namely, chasing the dogs away from the yard. Startled, the dogs could have been ex-pected to grab the food and run off into the blackness.23 Présuma-bly, these scraps were thought to have been sitting out all day collecting the evils of the house. The intent of the ritual is that the scraps be carried from the affected dwelling, thrown away at a distance, picked up by the god's dogs and carried far away. This is an appropriate image since this plague deity apparently had a court of hounds. The scraps thus have an explicit second meaning, as an offering to the plague deity and his hounds. A third, badly broken ritual was authored by an auspex named Maddunani. The ritual mentions two puppies, a pig, a clay statue, offerings, prayers, an uncultivated place, and the act of going through the army, all, in so far as can be seen, in a relatively standard way for these rituals. The ritual is unusual in that it was intended to be performed not by an exorcist/liver-diviner or \"old woman,\" but rather by an auspex and an old man.

A fourth ritual against plague in the army was authored by a cer-tain Dandanku, also an auspex. In this ritual the participants mix straw and red, blue, black, green and white wool together and scat-ter them at a crossroads. It is explained that the straw is for the horses of the horsemen who accompany the god Yarri, and the wool is for his female attendants. The god Yarri was an archer who was occasionally thanked for giving the army victory. At other times he and his associates, the underworld heptad, were blamed for plague in the army.25 The participants are to move to an unculti-vated place to offer to this heptad a cut-up kid, piglet and puppy and to libate beer and wine three times to them. This is repeated in its entirety on the second day. On the third day the ritual takes place in the plain. Here a billy goat is sacrificed to Yarri, his hep-tad and attendants, and is cooked and eaten with bread and wine. Then a donkey is brought in and faced toward the enemy with the request, \"Yo, Yarri, you made evil in this land and army. Lift up this donkey and carry it to the land of the enemy.\" This, unlike the other rituals against plague in the army, requires the participa-tion of the client who requested and paid for the ritual. This client did not have to be the king or a general since the ritual adds that if the client is poor, a clay donkey can be substituted for the real donkey. After the participants are finished with the donkey, they string a bow and place an arrow in it. But then he (the officiant? the client?) pours the remaining arrows out from the quiver onto the ground, saying, \"O god, keep shooting the enemy land with these arrows. But when you come into the land of Hatti, let your quiver be closed. Let your bow be unstrung.\" Then everyone re-turns from the plain. The fourth and last day contains more of-ferings and drinking to Yarri and his heptad but is largely broken away.26 A short ritual against plague in a fortress simply tells one to tie up a sheep at the edge of the fortress, and tell the deity who made the plague that the sheep is for him and that he should go to the enemy land and not into the fortress.27 25 See H.

Of course, despite the best efforts of strategists and magicians, defeats did occur. \"If the troops are defeated by the enemy, they perform the far-side-of-the-river ritual.

It is interesting to note that the ritual actions performed in this ritual are nearly identical to those performed in the ritual to purify the army's chariot horses, which I mentioned earlier.38 After a victory, it was time to give thanks to the gods. Usually a percentage of the booty was dedicated to them. Sometimes an entire town and its hinterland would be emptied of its gods and people and dedicated to the Hittite Stormgod as pasture for the divine bulls who pulled his chariot. Removing the people was easy. The gods of the enemy were more of a problem. Removing the gods was accomplished by using an evocation ritual. Tables were set up to the right and left and offerings put on them. Included was a jug of beer with the enemy gods' names on it. A fire-pan and brazier burned incense. From the tables long scarves of red, white and blue material were rolled out and declared to be roads for the gods. These were extended into nine roads of fine oil, nine roads of honey and nine roads of pap. The gods were summoned to follow the roads to the table. A sheep was then sacrificed to the male gods of the city and another to the goddesses of the city, and the roasted liver and heart were put on the offering table. After the gods were out of the city, the king, dressed in the robes of king-ship, made the enemy city sacrosanct; this was symbolized by pouring out a vessel of wine while saying, \"This city was hateful to me.\" The king then summoned the Stormgod, thanked him for giving it to him, and explained that he had now consecrated it and was laying a curse on any person who would resettle it.39 This could be symbolically indicated by sowing the site with fennel (a weed that grew particularly well on abandoned settlements).

The latter appear to be the closest to the Hittite: Livy XL 6 describing a purification of the Macedonian army; Hdt VII 41 describing a ritual of the Persian army, but misunderstood by Herodotos and turned into a typical Greek tyrant story. In the biblical examples the ritual is similar but the object is entirely different. Here those who pass between the parts of the severed animal(s) (Yahweh himself in Gen 15:9-10 and the notables of Judah in Jer 34:18-20) subject themselves to conditional curses; that is, the Hebrew rituals are more like the Hittite military oath than the Hittite and Greek military purification rituals. 39 (Text no. 21) KUB 7.60 = CTH 423, edited and translated into German by V.

No one performs for you the rituals of the day, the month or the year. No one celebrates your festivals and ceremo-nies (hazziwi-).\"2 The Hittites took seriously their fundamental obligation to care for the gods. This prayer ends with a promise to send offerings through enemy lines to the cult centers. Because of their importance to Hittite society, festivals and rituals from all over Anatolia were collected in the archives at Boghazköy and supply much information about religious life in the second millennium BCE. The ritual texts, which are prescriptive in nature,3 give an abundance of detail about each part of the sacrifi-cial procedure and the meal that follows it. They are our only major source of information about blood sacrifices, but they are more detailed than any of the Greek sources. These consist of descriptions of sacrifice in literary texts, vase-paintings and other iconographical evidence, and the so-called leges sacrae, which are 1 I am grateful to the editors of the Chicago Hittite Dictionary, Harry Hoffner and Hans Güterbock, who have generously made their files available to me.

In investigating this topic, I have examined only those ritual meals that include meat, which are less frequent than ritual meals without meat.5 Moreover, I have limited myself largely to those rituals where eating is specifically mentioned. Many blood sacri-fices occur that do not mention ritual feasting, and although it seems likely in many instances that there was ritual feasting, we cannot assume in these cases that a shared ritual meal followed the sacrifice. The following study will address first the procedure lead-ing to the meal, then the participants in the meal, and finally the sacrificial victims. It is difficult to talk about a typical procedure for the consump-tion of the sacrificed animal in Hittite ritual since no two instances are exactly alike, the amount of detail varies greatly from descrip-tion to description, and the most detailed descriptions are not necessarily the most typical. In broadest terms, we may recon-struct an outline as follows: (1) preparation, (2) killing and butch-ering, (3) setting the table, (4) calling the god(s) to eat, (5) feast-ing, and (6) withdrawal.

The preparation includes consecrating the animal and the sacred space in which the sacrifice will occur. The consecration can involve an incantation.6 Washing the statue of the deity and anointing the altar are also a part of the preparations.7 If the ritual occurred outside the god's temple, then his statue had to be set up. The critical personnel also had to be cleansed.8 At least one ritual mentions the burning of incense prior to the offering.9 In the ritual for the Stormgod of Kuliwisna, the victims were led to the place of the sacrifice in a procession: \"As the yearly slaughter, they drive one ram and one bull to the pyres of the deity.

Notably, there is never any mention of examining the exta of the dead animal as in Greek ritual.

In addition, a recent study of Hittite \"summa immeru\" texts has brought to light some evidence that the Hittites may have observed the victim's behavior as it was led to slaughter and examined its entrails afterwards.19 However, since neither these texts nor any other text of oracular results mention that the particular oracle was taken during a ritual and no ritual mentions the taking of oracles, it is possible that in Hatti these were quite separate procedures. When a location is specified, the slaughter is said to take place on 9n altar, or at a huwasi-.20 A wicker table (or a mat of greenery ['Glslahhurnuzi]) is generally used to hold the meal. The altar can also serve in this way. In the Festival for Telipinu in Hanhana and Kasha, the slaughter occurs at a hearth on one occasion21 and at a huwasi- on another.22 (Neither of these precludes the use of an altar as well.) In a ritual for the Stormgod of Kuliwisna, we are told that the slaughter takes place on the altar. This text provides us with what is perhaps the most detailed description of a blood sacrifice that we have: 19 Harry A. Hoffoer, Jr., \"Akkadian summa immeru Texts and Their Hurro-Hittite Counterparts,\" The Tablet and the Scroll. Near Eastern Studies in Honor of William W. Hallo, ed. Mark R. Cohen (Bethesda: CDL Press, 1993), 116-19. 20 The use of the d.-l. in these contexts allows for two possibilities, that the slaughter occurred \"on\" the altar, huwasi- and hearth, or simply \"at\" them. A single example of \"altar\" (ZAG.GAR.RA) with ser \"upon\" confirms that the sacrifice took place on the altar (KBo 22.216:11׳ [CTH 670, NS]). For the huwasi-, on the other hand, when a d.-l. is not used, the texts consistently give ANA \"to, at\" rather than INA \"on,\" and although Hittite scribes did not always differentiate between INA and ANA, the consistent use of ANA in these contexts suggests the slaughter took place near the huwaši-s. This notion is supported by a number of texts that mention huwasi-s being used in conjunction with altars, with the slaughter taking place on the latter.

Melchert has sum-marized previous discussion in his article on the subject, in which he reasserts the meaning \"drink to (the honor of) the god x.\"48 Güterbock disagrees with all these proposals and asserts instead that the god being \"drunk\" is the liquid contained in the cup.49 For the sake of caution, the phrase is translated literally in this essay. Finally, the participants remove themselves from the place of the ritual and the deity is also removed (unless the ritual occurs in the temple), as the following examples illustrate: \"They eat and drink. Then they come away\" (see note 69); \"The deity [goes back] into the temple and as soon as the deity arrives at the threshold, the client bows [to the deity] and libates beer.

The AN.TAH.SUM Festival describes very briefly prépara-tions for a meal in the temple of ZABABA, but omits the meal itself.70 The \"Great Assembly\" that takes place during the KI.LAM Festival may provide a model of a state-level cultic meal involving sacrifice, but while many of the usual activities are described, including an extensive drinking ceremony, a description of the sacrifice itself is omitted, as are any incantations or prayers. Without such invocations, we cannot deduce the nature of the Hittites' communications with the gods in these circumstances. That is, we cannot know, based on the festival texts alone, what \"give and take\" the participants in the feast at the state cultic level expected to initiate by sharing a meal with the gods. We are, however, offered a glimpse into the reciprocity sym-bolized by the shared cultic meals by the prayer of Arnuwanda I and Asmunikal with which this essay began. Implicit in the king and queen's lament is that the gods, by not protecting the interests of their worshippers, have contributed to the downfall of the religious system that kept them in offerings.

A. Scurlock In ancient Mesopotamia, the happiness of the dead in the Neth-erworld was dependent upon a continuous series of funerary offer-ings provided by their surviving relatives.1 Moreover, ghosts peri-odically left their homes in the world below to come back for visits during the course of which they expected to receive entertainment from the living. What interests us here about these festivals is that they also provided an occasion for private rituals in which oppor-tunistic use was made of the fact that the ghosts had to return to the Netherworld at the end of their formal visits. The roads be-tween the worlds being opened to receive the returning dead, what better opportunity could one find to rid oneself of one's illnesses or other personal problems? The month of Abu (roughly August in our calendar) was the oc-casion for one such general return of the dead,2 and it provided an appropriate setting for the following ritual designed to cure an unspecified ghost-induced illness. \"If the ghost of a man's father or mother keeps seizing him, on the 27th of Abu, you take clay from a potter's pit. You make a figurine of a man and a woman. You put a reed (made) of gold on the male figurine. You put a [st]aff (var. ears) (made) of gold on the female figurine. You thread carnelian (var. lapis) on red wool. You put it on her (the female figurine's) neck. You abundantly fit them (the figurines) out. You honor them; you treat them with care. You seat those figurines at the head of the patient for three days. You pour out hot broth for them. On the third day, the 29th, when the ghosts are (customarily) provided with food offerings, you make a sailboat. You assign (them) their travel provisions.

You are made to swear (this) by the great gods.'\"3 The manufacture of both male and female figurines is a rela-tively common feature of ancient Mesopotamian magic, the object being to ensure results in cases where the real perpetrator of the offense (sometimes a ghost but more usually a sorcerer) was un-known to the victim.4 Placing the figurines at the head of the patient for three days drew away the illness which was being com-bated so that it could be sent, along with the figurines, down river to the Netherworld. The presentation to the sun-god Samas was more than a simple exposure of the figurines to sunlight. By virtue of his journey through the heavens, the sun-god was the divine judge of the upper and lower worlds in whose court were adjudicated cases which arose between living persons and their dead relatives over the performance of funerary offerings.5 By involving Samas in such offerings, the living ensured that the ghostly recipients could not later complain to the god about being neglected (a le-gitimate grounds for ghost-induced illness). The final oath adminis-tered to the ghosts is another common element in ancient Meso-potamian magical rites, the object being to establish a sort of quasi-contract between the patient and the afflicting spirit. The accep-tance of a conditional offering by a ghost or demon obligated him to go away and leave the patient alone in the same way that the 3 BAM 323:79-88HBID p. 210ff:l-13 (= J. A.

Rites normally associated with mourning the dead (such as wailing and covering one's head with one's garments) were frequently used by ancient Mesopota-mian penitents in hopes of divine forgiveness.9 Upon successful completion of his penitence, the ex-sinner cleansed himself of any residue of his sin in the same way that one customarily marked the end of formal mourning, i.e., by such actions as dressing in a clean garment and anointing himself with oil.10 By taking the figurine through this ritual, the patient ensured that his father's ghost would not later be punished for the sin which he was being asked to take with him to the Netherworld. The ghost festival in Abu was not the sole opportunity for ghosts to pay a visit to living relatives; at the end of the legend of Istar's descent to the Netherworld it is mentioned that not only does the god Dumuzi return every year, but also that the dead are to \"come up and smell the incense\"11 during Dumuzi's festivities (that is, from the 27th to the 29th of the month of Du'uzu or roughly July in our calendar). This association of ghosts with the shepherd-god Dumuzi is quite natural when it is realized that the well-known annual \"wailing for Tammuz\" had nothing to do with 8 KAR 178 vii 35-52 (= Scurlock, MMDG no. 84). 9 Note, for example, the actions taken to counteract an eclipse: \"Until the eclipse brightens, the people of the land remove their head wrappings; their heads are covered with their garments .... They add their voices to the lament; they keep shouting until the eclipse clears up ... . When the eclipse begins, the lamentation-priests are dressed in bnen garments; their heads are covered with their torn garments. During the eclipse, they offer lamentation, grief, and wailing to Si n\" (BRM 4.6 [= E.

Dumuzi was released from his Netherworld prison on the 27th, accompanied by the family ghosts; to assist him in his journey, a bed was set up, and mourning rites were carried out under the supervision of Dumuzi's wife Istar accompanied by the burning of incense and offerings to Samas (\"lord of ghosts\") and Dumuzi. By laying the floured sheep heart on the hips of the figurine, the women playing Istar granted him a return to life. By sunrise on the 28th, Dumuzi had reached the upper world with the assistance of women playing his sister GeStinanna whose job it was to parch and scatter grain over him and to soak a figurine of him in beer to ensure his safe arrival (he 19 W. von Soden, \"Aus einem Ersatzopferritual fìir den assyrischen Hof,\" ZA 45 (1939): 42-61:1-51. 20 See Scurlock, RA 86 (1992): 91-105."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"was to rise up like the smoke from the grain and to float up like the figurine in the beer). The 28th was thus Dumuzi's day, the day when the sheepfold was circumambulated; the mourning rites, burning of incense, the laying of hearts on figurines, and the of-ferings to Dumuzi of the previous day were repeated, accompanied this time by offerings to Istar (the apples) and to Netherworld deities (Antu and Gilgames) and by a burnt offering. This last was necessitated by the fact that, in order to bring up Dumuzi (and the accompanying ghosts), Gestinanna had herself to go to the Neth-erworld as his surrogate, i.e., the women playing her had to be symbolically buried. Gestinanna was not, however, destined to remain permanently in the lower regions; that is to say, the \"girdling\" (i.e., the captivity of Gestinanna in the Netherworld as surrogate for her brother) was immediately followed by an \"ungirdling\" (i.e., the release of Gestinanna with the return of Dumuzi to the Netherworld). The 29th was the day of the bed when Dumuzi was prepared for his journey home to the Nether-world. This was consequently also \"the day of the captivity of Dumuzi\" which marked the end of the festival. On this day, the bed was again set up and offerings were made on various sides of this bed to Dumuzi, Istar, the family ghosts, and the Anunnaki. What is unique to this particular performance of the mourning rites for Dumuzi is the fact that the patient was asked to seal the offerings to be sent to the Netherworld with blood from his nose. We have already seen an example of the use of hair and wool from the hem of a patient's garment as a means of getting rid of ills (by throwing them into the river). It is interesting to note in this connection that the offerings which are being sealed with the blood consist of three pairs of objects separated by a river of flour. One component of each of these pairs (the rib cut, the cake, and the parched grain) was an appropriate offering to the dead or to Du-muzi or both. The other three (the shoulder cut, the sēpu-bread, and the flour) were appropriate offerings to living gods. By laying out the rib cut, the cake, and the parched grain on one side of the flour river and the shoulder cut, the sēpu-bread, and the flour on the other, the officiant signaled that it was a separation from death that was desired. The presence of a boat which, in view of the fact that its boatmen receive offerings alongside Ereskigal and Gil-games, was presumably intended to carry the offerings to the Netherworld, is also suggestive of a controlled transfer or exchange (on the divine scale between the living Gestinanna and the dead Dumuzi and on the human scale perhaps between the patient's illness which accompanied the offerings to the Netherworld and"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"the blessings brought back for the patient and his sponsoring father by Gestinanna from the realm of the dead).21 Also a good candidate for an opportunistic ritual of this type is a text which includes, alongside prayers to Samas and Gilgames,22 the following addresses to the Anunnaki and ghosts. \"'Stand forth, great [(Anunnaki) gods], and judge my case; [make a decision] about me. [Make] me [1]ive and remove him from [my] body. May my [fa]mi1y [ghosts] seize them; may they not let th[em] go. . . . the male and female sorcerer—may they rec[eive them]. . . .

However, there was in ancient Mesopota-mia also a strong tradition of consultations of the dead for the purpose of divining the future.32 We have a number of manuals for the performance of necromancy, or as the ancient Mesopotamians called such procedures, \"Incantation (to be used when you wish) to see a ghost in order to make a decision.\"33 Instructions accompa-nying necromantic incantations indicate that the favored method was to prepare an ointment which was smeared on the practitio-ner's face or on a figurine or skull which housed the ghost.34 There is also a somewhat broken lexical reference to digging (?) a ditch,35 presumably as a prelude to filling it with offerings to the dead. There was even a professional raiser of ghosts.36 One might, then, expect that the periodic returns of the dead would provide a prime opportunity for such activities and, indeed, one of the necromantic instructions makes it explicit that it should be performed on the 29th of Abu: \"You crush rue (?) in water and (cedar) oil.

The narra-tive's chronological framework (the settlement of Canaan) and its geographical setting (the Canaanite city of En-Dor) serve to characterize necromancy as an ancient and distinctly Canaanite practice.3 Interpreters also classify the apparition(s) conjured up 1 For examples from the history of interpretation, cf A. F. Kirkpatrick, The First Book of Samuel (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1888), 244-45 (a survey of nineteenth-century scholarship), and K. A. D. Smelik, \"The Witch of Endon I Samuel 28 in Rabbinic and Christian Exegesis Till 800 A. D.,\" VC 33 (1977): 160-78. 2 Cf. the definition of necromancy offered by E. Bourguignon, \"Necromancy,\" Encyclopedia of Religion, ed. M. Eliade (New York: MacMillan, 1987), 345, \"the art or practice of magically conjuring up the souls of the dead ... to obtain information from them, generally regarding the revelation of unknown causes or the future course of events.\" In the end, Bourguignon implemented a more inclu-sive definition, one useful for analyzing traditions of non-Westem cultures (347). The narrower definition is more appropriate for the present investigation, for it has as its close analogue (and probably its basis) in a tradition like 1 Sam 28:3-25. J. Tropper, Nekromantie: Totenbefragung im Alten Orient und Alten Testa-ment, AOAT 223 (Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener Verlag, 1989), 13-23, and M. S. Moore, The Balaam Traditions: Their Character and Development (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1990), 53-55, employ abroad definition which allows them to incorporate a variety of practices involving contact with the dead, many of which do not record the ghost's benevolent capacity to reveal esoteric knowl-edge concerning the future of the living. 3 Josh 17:11 lists the city of En-Dor and its dependencies among those Ca-naanite enclaves Israel failed to dispossess. According to this tradition, Israel was only able to force the inhabitants of En-Dor to pay tribute (v. 13). J.

What follows is an evaluation of this consen-sus as well as some alternative proposals for not only the origins, but also the character, of Israelite necromancy and for the affilia-tion of ghost and god in early Israelite religious tradition. * * * Did the Israelites adopt a late second-millennium version of Ca-naanite necromancy? Our compositional analysis favors the view that 1 Sam 28:3-25 is a literary construct of the mid-first millen-nium. As a unified text, these verses form a sequel to 1 Sam 15.5 Therefore, whatever can be reconstructed in terms of a composi-tional history for ch. 15, that for 28:3-25 should follow. Contex-tual features indicate that 1 Sam 15 comprises a late addition to the Deuteronomistic History.6 Both the style and the language of Seters, In Search of History: Historiography in the Ancient World and the Origins of Biblical History (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1983), 335 and 339, argues that Josh 14-17 reflects P's typical penchant for delineating the inheritance of individual tribes and families. 4C£ 28:13-14. In v. 14, Samuel is \"an old man\" or 'ìš zāqēn in the MT and \"an erect man\" or anër orthios in the LXX. 5 Vv. 17-18, which clearly presuppose 1 Sam 15, are often viewed as a secon-dary addition to ch. 28. If so, then the remainder of 28:3-25 need not be taken as dependent upon 1 Sam 15. But the isolated redactional character of w. 17-18 is doubtful. Together with w. 16-19, w. 17-18 comprise a unified prophetic speech: an accusation (as question, v. 16), a rehearsal of past obedience (w. 17-18a), an announcement of judgement ( Cal-kēn, v. 18b) and a judgement speech (v. 19). V. 15 anticipates w. 16 and 20 presupposes v. 19, cf Van Seters, In Search of History, 262 and n. 55. F. Foresti, The Rejection of Saul in the Perspective of the Deuteronomistic School: A Study of 1 Sm. 15 and Related Texts, ST 5 (Rome: Edizioni del Teresianum, 1984), 130-31, points out that the remark in 15:35, \"Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death,\" anticipates 28:3-25, esp. v. 3. Lastly, 28:17-18 presuppose the account in ch.15 concerning the destruction of the Amalekites. 6 Cf. Van Seters, In Search of History, 254-58. The redactor never fully re-solved the tension between 15:35 and 19:18-24. For 19:24, the LXX has Saul speak in ecstasy \"before them,\" enôpion auton, i.e., before the other prophets, rather than \"before Samuel\" with the MT lipnê sPmû'ël, in an attempt to harmo-nize 19:24 with 15:35, 25:1, and 28:3. The non-historicity of the Amalekite engagement in ch. 15 is confirmed by 1 Sam 16:14 - 2 Sam 5:12, which does not recognize Saul's control of Judah as in ch.15. The annihilation of the Amalekites in ch.15 does not account for David's campaigns against them in ch. 30.

The same can be said for its alignment with deuteronomistic language and ideol-ogy.9 To be sure, there are also independent arguments for the redactional status of 28:3-25.10 Furthermore, an analysis of the related text, Deut 18:11, confirms the above observations. Deut more, early stories about Saul (1 Sam 9:1-10:16, 11:1-15, 13:2-14:46) reveal that Samuel had no role in Saul's monarchy. That he did belongs to a later hand. 7 The phrases \"hearken to the voice of Yah weh\" (w. lb, 19, 20, 22) and \"thus says Yahweh of hosts\" (v. 2) are deuteronomistic. The following are as well: \"show loving kindness\" (v. 6), \"the word of Yahweh came to . . . \" (v. 10), \"he did not confirm my word\" (v. 11), \"do that which is evil in the eyes of Yahweh\" (v. 19), \"devoted to God\" (v. 21a), and \"violate Yahweh's command\" (v. 24); c£ also K.-D.

This form in which the prophet is depicted as the medium of the divine word is characteristic of the Deuteronomistic History in Kings and of the post-classical period more generally, cf. 1 Kgs 17:8-24, 2Kgs 5, 2Kgs 20:1-11. 9 28:3a, \"now Samuel was dead,\" depends on deuteronomistic 25:1 as it pre-supposes the death of Samuel as already known. 28:3a, \"and all Israel mourned and buried him in his own town of Ramah,\" is a revision of 25:1a. The feet that 28:3 repeats 25:1 increases the unlikelihood that the same author would repeat the same fact twice. If the story was deuteronomistic, it is surprising that Saul was not commended (cf. Van Seters, In Search of History, 262). The language and style point to its dependency upon such deuteronomistic passages as Deut 18:10-11, 2 Kgs 21:6 and 23:24, and to those elements it shares with the post-deuteronomistic Isa 8:19, 91:3, and 29:4, for which cf. Foresti, The Rejection of Saul 133 n.142. 10 28:3-25 creates a distinct disturbance in the geographical and chronologi-cal progression of the battle against the Philistines. 28:2 has its direct continua-tion in 29:1. In 28:4-5, the Philistines are at Shunem north of the Jezreel while the Israelites are stationed on Mt. Gilboa, whereas in 29:1 the Philistines are at Aphek some distance away and Israel is encamped in the plain. The Philistines arrive at Jezreel only in 29:11. Thus, 28:3-25 comprises a secondary addition to the Deuteronomistic History: 28:1-2 + 29:1-11 (cf. Van Seters, In Search of History, 262). Schunck, Benjamin, 95, and Foresti, The Rejection of Saul, 133-34, note the linkage 28:3-25 has with accounts in 1 Sam 7-14 and the story of David's rise or Aufstiegsgeschichte, 1 Sam 16:14 - 2 Sam 5:12, which could only presuppose the synthesis offered by the Deuteronomistic History."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"18:11 not only assumes the Canaanite origins of the necromancy which it condemns (cf. v.9), it is positioned within a narrative chronological framework that predates that of 1 Sam 28, namely the eve of the conquest of Canaan.

First, in numerous extispicies dated to Ashur-banipal's reign, diviners are depicted as inquiring about the success of planned military strategies and the eventual outcome of armed battle.23 Second, in a letter dated to the reign of king Esarhaddon (672 BCE) wherein the topic of his son's suitability for the posi-tion of crown prince is addressed, the answer given is in the af-firmative and its medium is the consulted ghost or etemmu of Esarhaddon's recently deceased wife, Esharra-khamat (Unes 1־ II):24 1 [The crown 2 prince] explained 3 [it as follows]: \"The gods Ashur (and) Shamash ordained me 4 to be the crown prince of Assyria 5 because of her (= the dead queen's) truthfulness.\" (And) her ghost 6 blesses him to the same degree as 7 he revered the ghost: 8 \"May his descendants rule over Assyria! (As it is said), 9 fear of the gods creates kindness, 10 fear of the infernal gods returns life. 11 Let the [king, my] lord give order.\" In 1 Sam 28, King Saul likewise seeks supernatural assistance in order to devise a military strategy against the Philistines and to ascertain the outcome of the battle. After failing to obtain such assistance and information using conventional methods (dreams, Urim and Thummim, and prophecy, cf. w. 6,15), Saul seeks the aid of a surreptitious necromancer in order to contact the ghost of the deceased prophet Samuel (vv. 4-7,15b). Once conjured up, 23 Cf. J. Pecirkovà, \"Divination and Politics in the Late Assyrian Empire,\" Ar Or 53 (1985): 155-68; idem, \"The Administrative Methods of Assyrian Imperialism,\" Ar Or 55 (1987): 162-75; and I.

Not only does Samuel's raised ghost predict the Israelites' defeat, it also announces the cessation of the Saulide dynasty, for Saul and his sons meet their death on the morrow (w. 17-19 and cf. 13:13-14). Thus, the biblical writer demonstrates an acquaintance with rites and functions characteristic of not only Mesopotamian divination more generally, but with Mesopotamian necromancy in particular (for additional parallels in specific de-tails, see below). In other words, the author of 1 Sam 28 might display an awareness of techniques similar to those attested in first millennium Mesopotamian sources employed for the purpose of predicting the outcome of war as well as the destiny of a royal house. Necromancy's absence in Levantine, Anatolian, and Egyptian magical traditions before the mid-first millennium BCE, its appear-ance in Mesopotamian texts during that same general time period, and the close correspondences between the Mesopotamian and Israelite versions of necromancy favor an eastern origin for the tradition reflected in 1 Sam 28. The fact that it is attested, or at best only rarely present, in Mesopotamia prior to the mid-first millennium adds further support for the late compositional history of 1 Sam 28:3-25.25 Nevertheless, it would be premature to assume that an eastern origin of Israelite necromancy authenticates those other biblical traditions that point to an extensive Mesopotamian religious influence on Israelite culture of the first millennium BCE (cf. e.g., 2 Kgs 16:10-18 and 17:24-41). The tendentious character of those traditions precludes any such overly simplistic solution. 25 Evidence for necromancy in earlier periods of Mesopotamia depends on how one interprets lines 238-43 of the Sumerian Gilgamesh (Enkidu and the Netherworld), lines 4-7 of the Old Assyrian letter from Kültepe (TC 1,5) and the lexical entry mušēlû etemmi = 1ú sag-bulug-ga in second-millennium Lu profes-sions lists, cf. Finkel, \"Necromancy,\" 1-2, and Tropper, Nekromantie, 47-76. The š causative of elû might signify \"to remove,\" cf. CAD 4 (1958): 134, #llc, in which case the mušēlû etemmi = 1ú sag-bulug-ga would be an exorcist, not a necromancer. The same applies in the case of šūlû sa etemmi = bur2 in the Lu excerpt Π. On bur2, c£ Â. Sjöberg, ed., The Sumerian Dictionary, vol. 2, \"B\" (Philadelphia: The University Museum, 1984), 195 which is commonly listed with Akkadian pašāru \"to loosen, to free\". So, the question arises, is the mean-ing \"to free from a ghost\" or \"to free a ghost\"? The presumed references in Gil-gamesh and Kültepe are controvertible. The first is a mythical context perhaps depicting an exceptional phenomenon, not a known mantic practice. In any case, Enkidu is not explicitly identified as a ghost or etemmu, but as \"servant\" subur-a-ni or \"demon\" utukku in the Akkadian. The second might be the strongest evidence for necromancy in earlier periods, but the context makes clear neither the means nor ends of that inquiry."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Such traditions are highly rhetorical and polemical in their own right as is highlighted further by the scant artifactual and textual evidence suggestive of the underlying historical processes attached to these traditions.26 Whether the Mesopotamian religious influence on a tradition like that preserved in 1 Sam 28 was the result of forced imposition by Israel's eastern overlords or the outgrowth of voluntary syncre-tism on the part of Israel is irrelevant to the present investigation. What is worthy of note is the familiarity exemplified by Israel's scribal elite vis-à-vis selected aspects of Mesopotamian divination. Such familiarity is also bome out for example, by biblical refer-ences to the funerary custom of burning a fire for a dead king or sarajj serēpāh (Jer 34:5; 2 Chr 16:14 and 21:19). The funerary fires were attributed to Israelite kings like Asa and Zedekiah (but not Jehoram). At least at the literary level, if not the historical, this rite is modelled on the Assyrian practice of burning a funerary fire attested in royal letters from the reign of Esarhaddon, Manasseh's contemporary. As apotropaic rituals of the Assyrian royalty, they were appropriated by late Israelite writers and pro-jected into traditions about earlier kings.27 Examples such as these strengthen the case for a Mesopotamian stimulus underlying the adaptation by biblical writers of other foreign mortuary rites such 26 E.g., Esarhaddon might have regulated sacrifices to Assyrian gods in Egypt, so the same might apply in Israel. For differing views on the degree and type of Assyrian influence on the Judahite temple cult of the mid-first millennium, cf J. McKay, Religion in Judah under the Assyrians 732-609 B.C., SBT 26 (London: SCM Press, 1973); M.

All recognize such influence regardless of how such influence took place or its extent. 27 The Akkadian cognate phrase is šuruptu šarpat, cf Parpola, Letters, 2.6-8 [LAS #4], 190-92 [LAS #195], 270-72 [LAS #280] for a treatment of the pertinent Assyrian letters, and W. Zwickel, \"Über das angebliche Verbrennen von Räucherweik bei der Bestattung eines Königs,\" ZAW 101 (1989): 267-77. That the funerary fires were designed to appease or drive away malevolent ghosts might be suggested by their close association with namburbi, āšipūtu, and related rites in LAS 280: 16-21.

The crux interpretum in 1 Sam 28 is the term כëlôhïm or \"g0d(s)\" in v. 13. It is typically understood to refer to the dead Samuel in spite of the several syntactic complexities such a view creates. The woman's response to Saul's query in v. 13—that she saw \"gods ascending\"—comprises a plural noun coupled with a plural partici-pie: נëlôhïm . . . cöf1m. But Saul's immediate response in v. 14, \"what is his/its appearance?\" or mah-to'orô, employs a singular pronominal suffix.29 Now the same term 3ëlôhïm shows up in v. 15, but there it is followed by a singular finite verbal form sār and given a singular force: \"God (= Yahweh) has turned away from me,\" 3ëlôhïm sār mēCālāy. In Exod 32:1 the same form occurs with a plural finite verb denoting multiple gods: כëlôhïm 3aser yēleku legānênû, \"the gods who will go before us.\" Thus, the im-mediate morpho-syntactic distinctions indicated by the two occur-rences of 3ëlôhïm in 1 Sam 28 might be a deliberate attempt to convey the respective numbers intended: in the first instance more than one god is in view, in the second case, clearly a single god. This might also help to resolve the potential discrepancy involv-ing the singular suffix (to'or6 v. 14) and its plural antecedent (גëlôhïm v. 13). In any case, the explicit mention of Samuel in v. 12 can provide the appropriate antecedent for the singular mascu-line suffix on to 'ôrô in v. 14.30 As for the question posed in v. 14, 28 As to why certain appropriated Mesopotamian mortuary practices were polemicized against while others were not is addressed in the conclusion to this study. The lack of polemic in the instance of the fijnerary fire might indicate the writers' ignorance of the origins of the rite or an attempt to enhance the status of the Israelite kings by depicting their funerals as on par with those of Assyrian kings while suppressing any \"magical\" elements possibly associated with the fear of the dead. 29 The term to 'orS is derivative of t- '-r, \"to regard intently\" (Qal) or \"to form (a shape)\" (Piel). 30 Less concerned with the woman's mention of gods in v. 13, Saul sought foremost information regarding the appearance of the apparition first mentioned in v. 12, for its appearance led the woman to identify Saul. That Saul, although present, did not have direct access to the woman's vision is confirmed by the feet that in the first-millennium Mesopotamian necromancy incantations, procedures involving recitations and smearing preparations on the fece must be followed in"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"the LXX reads ti egnos, \"what have you perceived?\" not \"what is his/its appearance?\" Its underlying Hebrew Vorlage probably read mh t'rt, \"what did you make out\" (< t-'-r).31 In other words, in the Greek text and its underlying Hebrew tradition, the need to identify an antecedent in v. 13 for the question posed in v. 14 does not arise.32 Admittedly, both of the preceding scenarios leave the \"gods\" or 3elöhim in v. 13 unidentified, but before we offer our interpreta-tion of the term גelöhim or \"gods\" in v. 13, the comparative evidence often advanced in support of the deification of the Isra-elite dead demands evaluation. Literary data from Mesopotamia, Syria, and elsewhere have been cited as indicative of the divine status of the Israelite dead. Often mentioned are the Akkadian Ersatznamen, the association of the ilānu with the etemmū in Akkadian texts from Assyria and Nuzi, the parallels between ilānu and mētū in the Emar texts, the Ugaritic king list (KTU 1.113) wherein the form 'il is followed by a personal royal name (i.e., \"Divine So-and-So\"), and the 'ilm or \"gods\" which parallel the mtm or \"dead\" in the Shapash hymn of the Baal-Mot myth from Ugarit (KTU 1.6.VI:45-49).33 Interpreters repeatedly affirm that the dead in Mesopotamia are designated by the lexeme ilu or its plural form ilānu. But the cited data are sparse and highly controvertible. The ilu element in the so-called Ersatznamen more likely refers to \"good fortune,\" \"luck,\" or a \"personal god\" (often an unnamed member of the pantheon), rather than to a ghost of the dead.34 Second, while the order for the necromancer to see the ghost, cf. Finkel, \"Necromancy,\" 5, 10, and J. Scurlock, \"Magical Means of Dealing with Ghosts in Ancient Mesopotamia,\" 2 vols. (Ph.D. diss., University of Chicago, 1988), 324-26 (and n. 201), 337-42. In other words, it was the necromancer's sole prerogative to see a ghost. 31 P. K. McCarter, 1 Samuel, AB 8 (Garden City: Doubleday, 1980), 419, preferred the LXX and proposed mh ydct as its Hebrew Vorlage. T. J. Lewis, Cults of the Dead in Ancient Israel and Ugarit, HSM 39 (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1989), 109, favored the ΜΓ and offered mh tr'y (< r-'-h), but see n. 29 above. Both presumed the equation of god and ghost. 32 Moreover, the criterion of lectio difficilior is not a priori to be preferred; cf. now Ε. Τον, Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1992), 302-05. 33 Cf. Κ. Spronk, Beatific Afterlife in Ancient Israel and in the Ancient Near East, AO AT 219 (Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener Verlag, 1986), 163, who also mentions Egypt; and Lewis, Cults, 49-51, 115. 34 Following CAD 7 (1960): 102, contra Lewis, Cults, 49-50. For a list of the names, cf. J. J. Stamm, Die akkadische Namengebung (MVÄG 44; Leipzig: Hin-richs, 1939), 278-306.

The bilingual incantation text from Assyria, CT 17,37 \"Y\", 1-10 is often cited in this regard: \"the captive gods come forth from the grave, the zaqlqu come forth from the grave, for the offering of the kispi7, for the water libation, they come forth from the grave.\"35 But the fact that the captive gods are located in the netherworld merely confirms what was already known, namely that the Mesopotamian underworld was inhabited by sundry forms of numina. Furthermore, in addition to comprising grave goods to be included in a burial (Totenbeigabe), the kispu frequently comprised a gift offered to the gods of the underworld or a form of entice-ment to the infernal deities—particularly the Anunnaki—for protection from tormenting ghosts.36 In fact, mid-first millennium necromancy incantation texts record offerings to be made to various deities such as Shamash, the Anunnaki, Pabilsag, and the primordial deities of the netherworld for their aid in raising a ghost from the grave (more on this below).37 That the captive gods come up from their graves in the nether-world might be expressive of the Mesopotamian belief reflected in Enuma Elish. These gods, having been slain for their rebellion against the established pantheon (and perhaps imprisoned in their sepulchers), could be released from the netherworld only by the appropriate means, whether it be the requisite incantational proce-dure or the decree of Marduk at creation as in Enuma Elish.38 It appears that there were many groups of such gods who comprised the defeated and slain divine enemies, not all of which had appar-away/wronged,\" might refer to the perceived abandonment of the personal god (often a major deity) during childbirth as expressed in the resultant impairment, near-death, or death of the mother and/or the impairment or near-death of her child.

For example, many Asakku demons and Tammuzes show up after the death of the Asakku demon in Lugale and the death of Τ am-muz.39 These slain divine enemies are given various titles: \"the conquered Enlils,\" \"the dead gods,\" or simply \"the battered\" abtütu or šulputūtu.40 In any case, one cannot appeal to Enuma Elish VII:26-27 to buttress a simplistic equation of the captive gods and the ghosts of the dead.41 The relevant lines read as follows: \"Lord of the holy incantation who raises the dead to life, who has compassion on the captive gods.\"42 While the captive gods are described as dead, the significance is not that the captive gods are to be equated with the ghosts of deceased mortals, for humankind had yet to be created. Rather, the following lines 28-29 make clear that not only are the dead of line 26 the captive gods of line 27, but that both refer to those gods who were slain for their rebellion against the great gods. These lines also point out that it is by means of creating human-kind, whose lot it is to relieve the captive gods of their service, that these dead gods can be restored to their former positions in the pantheon. Among the few remaining texts, the Neo-Assyrian version of the Legend of Etana mentions \"the gods\" or ilānu and \"the ghosts of the dead\" or etemmü as parallel members of a poetic bicolon. But parallelism alone cannot insure the equation of the ilānu with the ghosts of the dead. A complementary force of the poetic parallelism might equally apply. The text reads, \"I honored the gods, served the ghosts of the dead.\"43 Now the term ilānu most frequently designates the gods of the pantheon and quite often the personal protective gods. Thus, in the Legend of Etana, one would expect that the term ilānu refers to the personal gods, that is, if 39 W. G. Lambert, \"The Theology of Death,\" in Death in Mesopotamia, RAI 26, ed. Β.

In other words, the text simply seeks to convey the widely embraced virtue of performing the respective services for both the gods as well as the ghosts of the dead, two distinct groups of supranatural beings. That the ilānu delineate the same group as that signified by the dead may be actually contradicted in the few instances where the ilānu are mentioned alongside the etemmü at Nuzi and the mētū at Emar. In view of the general usage of ilānu outlined above and the non-poetic contexts of the Nuzi and Emar texts, a distinction was probably intended. Some distinction is recognized even by those who seek to identify the gods with the ghosts of the dead.44 One is otherwise forced to make the unwarranted assumption that the ancient writers in this case were guilty of blatant redundancy. At Nuzi, both \"the gods\" or ilāttu and \"the ghosts of the dead\" or etemmū are depicted as deserving of service (palāhu). As in the case of the Legend of Etana, \"the gods\" or ilānu might just as conceivably refer to the family personal gods, which is what we would expect in the context of inheritance. The same can be said for the references to \"the gods\" or ilānu alongside \"the dead\" or mētū in the Emar texts. In the genre of testament at Emar, the gods and the dead are \"honored\" (kunnu) and \"called upon/commemorated by name\" (nabû A).45 Again, the explicit mention of the gods together with the dead in a non-poetic con-text lends credence to the view that the former designate a group of supranatural beings distinct from the dead. Within the context of inheritance, we might expect the ilānu to represent personal gods who the evidence reveals were often none other than the major deities. The phrase 'il + personal royal name in the Ugaritic king list KTU 1.113 (and cf. the Eblaite king list) most likely refers to a dynasty's personal god to whom ritual is directed for purposes of legitimation. The god is repeatedly referred to in a listing of de-ceased kings. The 'il element precedes each royal name and proba-44 Tsukimoto, Totenpflege, 104-05 and H. Rouillard and J.

They labelled the etemmü as the recent identifiable ancestors and the ilânu as the remote unidentifiable ancestors. For a list of most of the relevent Emar texts, cf. J.-M. Durand, \"Tombes familiales et culte des Ancêtres à Emar,\" NABU 3 (1989): 85-88. 45 Perhaps they are \"lamented\" (nabû Β).

Moreover, the terms \"gods\" or 'ilm and the mtm or \"men\" (rather than \"dead\") in the Shapash hymn in the closing section of the Baal-Mot myth (KTU 1.6.VI:45ff.) stand in anti-thetical rather than synonymous parallelism. Nowhere in the myth proper are the dead mentioned. Humanity is threatened with death, but Shapash stays Mot's hand and spares humanity. In other words, the closing hymn highlights the point that Shapash dictates the fates of those living in the divine and earthly realms. The preceding analysis renders suspect the position that the dead in early Syria-Palestine obtained the status of \"god\" in any sense of the term. Furthermore, the internal and external data render highly unlikely the widely accepted view that ג elöhim in 1 Sam 28:13 is Samuel's ghost. Besides, if by \"god\" a ghost of the dead was intended, why was the term 'ob or yiddecöni not men-tioned instead in v. 13, for these two are the deuteronomistic technical terms for ghosts participating in necromancy?46 Lastly, if it were granted that the dead were deified, the woman's reference to the ghost of the dead by the use of the termג elöhim would have been superfluous for her and for Saul. Who then are the intended referents designated 3elöhim in 1 Sam 28:13? One viable alternative to understanding the phrase 3elöhim . . . CāÍìm reflects a striking resemblance to elements attested in Mesopotamian necromancy. In the first-millennium necromantic incantation texts referred to previously, various deities including Shamash and the primordial deities of the nether-world are called upon in order to insure the appearance of the ghost of the dead.47 In one such incantation, Shamash is depicted as follows: \"Shamash, Ο Judge, you bring those from above down below, those from below up above.\"48 This role of the solar deity is also underscored in another incantation text:49 46 The 'Shot and the yìdde Cāmm of w. 3,7-9 refer neither to a class of profes-sional mantics nor to ancestral images, but to the ghosts of the dead, \"the ones-who-retum\" (< Arabic 'aba, \"to return\") and \"the knowers.\" The decisive passage is Lev 20:27 where it is reported that a man or woman might have \"in them\" (bāhem) the 'St or the yidde(ānî. This surely eliminates the practitioner and the image as interpretive options. 47 On this role of the gods, cf. esp. Scurlock, \"Ghosts,\" 106-10. M. Hutter, \"Religionsgeschichtliche Erwägungen zu 'Ihym in 1 Sam 28,13,\" Biblische Notizen 21 (1983): 32-36, concluded that \"gods coming out of the earth\" did not refer to Samuel's supernatural character. However, he wrongly based his argu-ment on Hittite evidence and on an early date for the 1 Sam 28 text and tradition. 48 Cf. Finkel, \"Necromancy,\" 11, and Scurlock, \"Ghosts,327-28 ׳ (lines 13b-"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"I [. .. 2 . . .] dust of the netherworld [...]. 3 May he (Shamash) bring up a ghost from the darkness for me!

In view of the likelihood that the Syro-Palestinian dead were not equated with the gods, that the gods were active participants in the Mesopotamian necromancy rituals, that the text of 1 Sam 28:13-14 manifests considerable complexity in transmission, and that the biblical traditions show some acquaintance with Mesopo-tamian necromancy, it is our conclusion that the term 3ëlôhïm in 1 Sam 28:13 designates those gods known to be summoned—many from the world below—to assist the necromancer in the retrieval of a ghost. Our interpretive rendition of vv. 11-14 follows: II At that, the woman said, \"Whom shall I bring up for you?\" He an-swered, \"Bring up Samuel for me.\" 12 When the woman saw Samuel, she shrieked loudly, and the woman said to Saul, \"Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!\" 13 The king said to her, \"Do not be afraid. What do you see?\" And the woman said to Saul, \"I see (chthonic) gods coming up from the earth.\"14 Then he said to her, \"(Now) what have you per-ceived (cf. LXX)?\" And she said to him, \"An old/upright man coming up from the earth, and he is wrapped in a robe.\" * * * The affinities that 1 Sam 28:3-25 shares with the mid-first mil-lennium divination and (in particular) necromantic traditions from Mesopotamia are remarkable. These include the role of divination in dictating military strategy and in predicting the outcome of armed engagement, necromancy's role in determining the fate of the royal dynasty, and the assistance of the gods in the retrieval of a ghost. These similarities which 1 Sam 28:3-25 shares with Meso-potamian divination and necromancy, its compositional history, the absence of necromancy in Levantine, Egyptian, and Anatolian religions pre-dating the mid-first millennium, all point to a late Mesopotamian stimulus underlying not only the text of the 14a).

Therefore, the Canaanite origin of Israelite necromancy is best viewed as a retro-spective ideological construct of the biblical writers.50 We would propose that the (post)-deuteronomistic writer's rhetorical strat-egy involved projecting necromancy into a narrative about more ancient times, attributing to it ancient Canaanite origins, and having it condemned by a venerable hero of the past: the prophet Samuel.51 A comparison of 1 Sam 28:3-25 with other texts in the Deu-teronomistic History—the list of Manasseh's sins in 2 Kgs 21:6, the cultic reform of Josiah in 2 Kgs 23:24 and the deuteronomistic passage in the Mosaic law, Deut 18:10-11—indicates that our author drew from the stock deuteronomistic language of \"necromancy as taboo.\" With its inclusion in the episode involv-ing the woman of En-Dor, necromancy's performance and pro-scription was relocated in the formative stage of the nation's history. The proscription of necromancy could no longer be viewed as an issue of concern only for late-comers such as the deuteronomistic ideologists. Now it was an age-old problem. Whereas the deuteronomistic ideology polemicized against necro-mancy by attaching it to Manasseh's apostasy during the last days of the Davidic dynasty (2 Kgs 21:6), the hand responsible for 1 Sam 28:3-25 established a much earlier precedent by associating necromancy with Israel's first monarchy, the Saulide dynasty. Saul, Israel's first king, violated the law of Moses as set forth in Deut 18:11—itself a deuteronomistic text set in a context about much earlier times. 50 Like the terms Amorite and Hittite, the biblical Canaanite functioned pri-marily as an ideological term denoting the pre-Israelite inhabitants of Palestine, later foreign occupiers, and ultimately all groups, including those who embraced competing forms of Yahwism, who were perceived as a threat to Israel's claim to the land and its blessings; cf. J. Van Seters, \"The Terms 'Amorite' and *Hittite' in the Old Testament,\" VT 22 (1972): 64-81; J. Levenson, \"Is There a Counterpart in the Hebrew Bible to New Testament Anti-Semitism?\" JES 22 (1985): 242-60; and now N. P. Lemche, The Canaanites and Their Land (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1991). Isa 19:3 preserves a rhetorical expansion on the Canaan-ite origins of necromancy in its depiction of the Egyptian as observer of necro-mancy. Besides the absence of necromancy in early Egyptian sources, the use of typical Akkadian terminology in 19:3 like the term etemmu(m) or \"ghost\"—the Hebrew equivalent of which is 'itfìm— and the presence of technical Hebrew terminology for the ghost such as 'ob and yiddecānì provide further clues to the rhetorical nature of necromancy's Egyptian associations in Isa 19. 51 Elsewhere it is condemned by the prophets Moses (Deut 18:11) and Isaiah (Isa 8:19) and the good king, Josiah (2 Kgs 23:24)."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Crucial to deuteronomistic ideology was the general premise that the land and its blessings were dependent upon complete separation from foreign religious practices. Viewed in this light, the legend of Saul demonstrates that when the leaders of the nation embrace religious beliefs of the foreigner—like Saul in his rendez-vous with the Canaanite woman of En-Dor—the nation's rights to the land and its blessings are jeopardized. Be that as it may, we have yet to address the question of why the deuteronomistic and associated traditions selected necromancy as the straw that broke the back of both dynasties. Necromancy is unique among rituals preserved in the Hebrew Bible, mortuaiy or otherwise, in that it precipitated direct contact with the world of the gods as well as with the world of the dead (although not of the deified dead!). In necromancy, both the dead and the gods \"bodily\" invade the world of the living; therefore it is the quintessence of liminality. Its (con)fusion of three worlds— those of the gods, the living, and the dead—explains why necro-mancy—among the many magical and mortuary rites mentioned in the biblical traditions—became a distinctly anomalous rite within the rigid classification systems of both the deuteronomistic and priestly traditions (cf. Deut 18:11, 2Kgs 21:6 and 23:24 and Lev 19:31, 20:6,27 respectively). It epitomized both Israel's prostitu-tion and pollution.52 As the archetype for the abnormal and as the esteemed rite of her Mesopotamian overlords, necromancy was pressed into service as the Achilles heel of Israel's two royal houses, the house of Saul and the house of David, for it is Saul and Manasseh who are to blame for the destruction of their respective dynasties (and cf. 2 Kgs 21:10-15). In the final analysis, for the deuteronomistic tradition, necromancy—more than any other 52I. Morris, \"Attitudes Toward Death in Archaic Greece,\" Classical Antiq-uity 8 (1989): 296-320 has proposed that, coincident with the rise of the Greek polis, humankind's central place in the cosmos as a citizen in the new social order led to the spatial separation of the gods, the living, and the dead into three discrete areas within the polis. Their contusion was rationalized as pollution. In biblical traditions, the special status of the dead's polluting power is reflected in the unique performance outside the sanctuary and camp of priestly rituals aimed at compensating for contact with a corpse (other forms of purification required performance at the sanctuary; Num 19), the prohibition against priests engaging in funerary rites (though the family could; Lev 21), and especially the blanket prohibitions against self-mutilation and necromancy. The last two entailed the most explicit (con)fusion of worlds: the former presupposed the presence of the dead through imitation; and the latter, their very presence in the form of a ghost along with the involvement of other gods."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"rite—epitomized the abomination of the Canaanite in the history of Israelite kingship."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHT THE MAGICIAN AS OUTSIDER IN THE HEBREW BIBLE AND THE NEW TESTAMENT Stephen D.

The matter of the translation and subsequent interpretation of words traditionally rendered as \"magic\" is an important one that should not be overlooked in investigations of magic, since the choice of words used in a translation reflects a whole host of a priori assump-tions made by the writer or translator, not only in a target Ian-guage, such as English, but also in intermediate languages, such as the Greek of the Septuagint or the Latin of the Vulgate. As I am using the term, \"outsider\" includes both the non-Israelite as well as the native Israelite whose practices deviated sharply from the Israelite norm, particularly because these acts were perceived as being performed through a power other than Israel's God. In this essay I discuss the traditional distinction be-tween magic and religion that has prevailed in Western scholarship since the Reformation and contrast it with the view of magic and religion in antiquity. These methodological reflections, though they take us somewhat afield from antiquity, are not inappropriate for such a discussion, since questions of definition should be re-solved at the outset of any study of magic. Thus, for instance, the value of Valerie I. J. Flint's otherwise admirable study, The Rise of Magic in Early Medieval Europe, and Keith Thomas' Religion and the Decline of Magic, is somewhat undermined by rather debatable definitions of magic.4 Further, I consider accounts from the Bible 3 The matter of the translation and subsequent interpretation of words tradi-tionally rendered as \"magic\" is an important one that should not be overlooked in investigations of magic, since the choice of words used in a translation reflects a whole host of a priori assumptions made by the writer or translator.

The traditional view of the structural cleavage between magic and religion that has prevailed in Western scholarship in recent centuries is the result, in part at least, of the sharp Protestant reaction to certain Roman Catholic sacraments and other prac-tices. This position was represented at least as early as 1395 by the Lollards in their \"Twelve Conclusions\": That exorcisms and hallowings, made in the Church, of wine, bread, and wax, water, salt and oil and incense, the stone of the altar, upon vest-ments, mitre, cross, and pilgrims' staves, be the very practice of necro-mancy, rather than of the holy theology. This conclusion is proved thus. For by such exorcisms creatures be charged to be of higher virtue than their own kind, and we see nothing of change in no such creature that is so charmed, but by false belief, the which is the devil's craft.5 According to the Lollard Walter Brute, the very procedures of the priests were modelled on those of the magician. Both priest and magician thought their spells were more effective when pro-nounced in one place and at one time rather than another; both turned to the east to say them; and both thought that mere words could possess a magic virtue.6 But if the Protestants criticized holy water and the consecration of church bells, they launched a verita-ble frontal assault against the central Catholic doctrine of the Mass. In the view of one Reformer, transubstantiation differs in no significant way from conjurations, \"the pretense of a power, plainly magical, of changing the elements in such a sort as all the magicians of Pharaoh could never do, nor had the face to attempt the like, it being so beyond all credibility.\" John Calvin wrote that the Roman Catholics \"pretend there is a magical force in the could be described in this way, at least to an outsider? Certainly the biblical tradition does. For whom are the \"instruments,\" of which Flint speaks, \"strange\"? To whom are its results \"remarkable and unaccustomed\"? To the practitioners themselves? I doubt it. And how are such magical acts to be distin-guished from ritual ones? Flint's definition says at least as much about the speaker or writer as it does about those acts thus described. 5 Cited by H. S.

Based on this view of the automatic and immediate efficacy of ritual words and procedures, a different relationship to deity (or deities) was posited: magic was said to be manipulative and coercive, while religion (based on the Reformers י views of efficacious faith) was perceived as supplicative. In contrast to this view of magic that developed during the pe-riod of the Reformation, magic in antiquity was viewed, according to David Aune, as \"that form of religious deviance whereby indi-vidual or social goals are sought by means alternate to those nor-mally sanctioned by the dominant religious institution.\"8 As both Jonathan Z. Smith9 and Morton Smith10 have shown in the case of the Greco-Roman world, magic and magical practices are par excellence the activities of the outsider. According to J. Z. Smith, in the Greco-Roman world, \"magic was not different in essence from religion, but rather different with regard to social position .... The one universal characteristic of magic\" is that \"it is ille-gal, ... and it carried the penalty of death or deportation.\"11 In the same vein, Morton Smith notes, \"in the Roman Empire, the practice of magic was a criminal offense (Paulus, Sententiae 5:23.14-18), and the 'magician' was therefore a term of abuse. It still is, but the connotation has changed: now it is primarily fraud; then it was social subversion.\"12 As in the Greco-Roman world, magic in the Bible was a practice of the outsider. It was also per-ceived as a form of subversion and was consequently severely punished, since it was viewed as undermining Israel's religious foundations. 7 Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic, 53. 8 Aune, \"Magic in Early Christianity,\" 1515. 9 J.

According to the account in Exodus 7-9, the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, \"When Pharaoh speaks to you and says, ,Produce your marvel' (Heb. môpët), you shall say to Aaron, 'Take your rod and cast it down before Phar-aoh.' It shall tum into a serpent\" (Ex 7:8-9). They came before the Pharaoh and did precisely that: Aaron cast down his rod in the presence of Pharaoh, and it turned into a serpent. The Pharaoh then summoned his own wise men (hakāmîm) and sorcerers (mekaššepm), and the Egyptian magicians did the same thing with their spells (wayyaCasū gam-hēm hartummê misrayim bëlahatêhem kēn) (Ex 7:11). Though the rods of the Egyptian magicians were able to become serpents, Aaron's rod swallowed all of their rods. The Egyptian wise men and sorcerers were further able to imitate Moses and Aaron in the turning of the bodies of water in Egypt into blood and in bringing frogs upon the land by their spells (bëlahatêhem), but they failed in their efforts to pro-duce lice {kinnim); they were fully discomfited when the boils affected them as they did the other Egyptians, so that they were not even able to stand before Pharaoh. In Genesis 41, Pharaoh had dreams that left him troubled. He sent for his magicians (hartummê misrayim) and for his wise men (hakāmêhā) to interpret his dreams for him. After Pharaoh had told them his dreams, the magicians and wise men said that they were not able to interpret them for him. At this point the chief cupbearer remembered Joseph, who was then called before Pharaoh and was able, through the gift of God (Gen 41:16), to interpret Pharaoh's dreams to his satisfaction. In Daniel 2, Nebuchadnezzar, like Pharaoh, had dreams that left his spirit agitated, whereupon he called his magicians (hartummîm), exorcists (aššāpîm), sorcerers {mekaššepìm), and Chaldaeans (kasdìm) to tell him what he had dreamed. They were threatened with death if they failed to produce for him both his dream and its interpretation, but they claimed that such a demand as the king was making of them had never been made of a magi-cian, exorcist, or Chaldaean before: \"The thing asked by the king is difficult; there is no one who can tell it to the king except the gods whose abodes are not among mortals\" (Dan 2:11). Thereupon"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"the king flew into a violent rage, and gave an order to kill all of the wise men of Babylon. However, Daniel, who would also have fallen under this death order, was able to interpret the dream through the power of the \"God of heaven,\" thereby saving himself and the others from death. Several significant features in these stories that are relevant to our subject are worth noting: In each of these three instances, Israelites are pitted against practitioners of the religion of non-Israelite \"outsiders,\" and in each instance the superior power of God is shown. When the magicians and wise men of Pharaoh are not able to produce lice by their own spells, they exclaim to Phar-aoh, \"This is the finger of God\" (נesbac גëlôhïm hi') (Ex 8:14). Daniel similarly emphasizes Israel's God as the source of his power and its superiority to the power of the wise men and magicians: \"The mystery about which the king has inquired—wise men, exor-cists, magicians, and diviners cannot tell to the king. But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what is to be at the end of days\" (Dan 2:27-8). Further, in the instances of Joseph and Daniel, there is no clear indication given of the specific manner in which they show them-selves superior to the Egyptian and Babylonian magicians, except through prayer and the power of God. However, in the case of Moses and Aaron in Pharaoh's court, the action by which the effect was achieved was the same (wayyaCasū gam-hēm hartummê misrayim bëlahàtêhem ken). In addition, the very word used here in the text for the Egyptian magicians—hartom (in the phrase \"hartumme misrayim\")—is borrowed from the Egyptian hr tp, \"lector priest,\" one who, in Egyptian materials at least, is not generally associated with magic (but see the essay by Robert K. Ritner, above).13 This suggests an implicit polemic in the text against all practitioners of Egyptian religion, with the hint that they are all magicians (because they are non-Yahwists). Jacob Milgrom has pointed out that Moses is silent before the performance of each miracle; Pharaoh's magicians, on the other hand, are only able to copy Aaron's actions \"by their spells\" (bëlahatêhem—if we follow the new Jewish Publication Society translation—rather than the more traditional translation \"by their secret arts\").14 By acting alone, and not speaking, Moses behaves 13 Adolf Erman and Hermann Grapow, eds., Ägyptisch-Deutsches Wörter-buch, 6 vols. (Leipzig: J. Hinrichs, 1929), 3.177. 14 Jacob Milgrom, \"Magic, Monotheism, and the Sin of Moses,\" in The Quest for the Kingdom of God: Studies in Honor of George E. Mendenhall, Η. Β."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"in a manner that is distinct from that of the Egyptians (which is, by implication, \"magical\"). I find this position somewhat unsatis-fying. As Milgrom himself notes, later Israelite prophets do not refrain from speaking while performing their wonders. Thus, Elijah said to King Ahab, \"As the Lord, the God of Israel lives, whom I serve, there will be no dew nor rain in the next few years except at my word\" (1 Kings 17:1). During his contest with the priest of Baal on Mount Carmel, Elijah both speaks and acts (1 Kings 18:16-46). Similarly, Elisha speaks and acts when miraculously providing oil for the widow (2 Kings 4:2-7). If the essence of magic is acting and speaking together when performing wonders, why are these prophets never referred to as \"magicians\" or \"sorcerers\" in the text of the Bible, despite its rich vocabulary for describing practitioners of such arts? Departing for a moment from Israelite religion, it should be noted that practitioners of numerous normative religious traditions, both ancient and modern, include both words and actions in their rites. By the definition of magic that Milgrom uses, do these traditions also become \"magical\"? That definition, based as it is upon notions that only gained wide currency during the Reformation and that are extrinsic to the Hebrew Bible itself, must be reassessed.15 The decisive element in all of these accounts—of Elijah and Elisha, as well as Moses—is the Israelite, Yahwist context.16 Probably the best-known list of prohibited practices in the Pen-tateuch is found in Deut 18:10-11: \"Let no one be found among you who consigns his son or daughter to the fire, or who is an augur (qāsēm qësâmïm), a soothsayer (mëcôrën), a diviner (menahhēš), a sorcerer (mekaššēp), one who casts spells (hābēr hāber), one who consults ghosts or familiar spirits (sö3 ël ob wëyidcônî)f or one who makes inquiries of the dead (dārēš el-hammëtïm).\" These activities are typically the practices of the outsider, as the context of the list makes clear: they are not merely considered abhorrent practices (tocaböt) when performed by Israelites, but their abhor-rent nature is at least in part the result of their being observed by Huffmon, F. A. Spina, A. R W. Green, eds. (Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 1983), 251-65. 15 Aune, \"Magic,\" 213. 16 I readily concede that Moses may be shown as refraining from speaking in order to distinguish him from the \"magicians\" and \"sorcerers\" in Pharaoh's court, but I question whether these Egyptians are thus described because they speak when performing their acts, rather than because they are non-Israelites and non-Yahwists."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Israel's neighbors, as the wider context of the pericope shows. The verse immediately preceding the list of prohibited practices begins: \"When you enter the land that the Lord your God is giving you, you shall not leam to imitate the abhorrent practices of those nations.\" Further, these practices of the people of the land form one of the grounds for their being dispossessed, as the passage following the list indicates: \"For anyone who does such things is abhorrent to the Lord, and it is because of these abhorrent things that the Lord your God is dispossessing them before you. You must be wholehearted with the Lord your God. Those nations that you are about to dispossess do indeed resort to soothsayers and augurs; to you, however, the Lord your God has not assigned the like\" (Deut 18:12-14). There are numerous words in the Hebrew Bible that refer to practices or practitioners of magic (as it is generally understood), falling roughly into the categories of magic in general or sorcery, divination, and astrology (these categories, it should be pointed out, are not explicit in the Bible itself: in none of these lists are these types of magical practices expressly divided).17 Roughly three-quarters of the occurrences of the words refer, explicitly or not, to non-Israelite practitioners or activities. Indeed, some of the words are used exclusively of non-Israelites. At least three of these words (6b \"familiar spirit, sorcerer,\" aššāp, hartām) are most likely of foreign origin: hartöm is Egyptian in origin, aššāp derives from Akkadian, while ôb apears to be a non-Semitic migra-tory word that is found in Sumerian, Akkadian, Hurrian, Hittite, and Ugaritic.18 The remaining quarter of the occurrences of the terms for ma-gicians and magical practices refers to prohibited Israelite practices or to Israelites engaged in these forbidden practices. In no case have I found any of these terms used favorably of an Israelite practice. For example, in Isaiah 3:2, the \"augur\" (qSsēm) is men-tioned together with warrior, priest, and king; in Micah 3:6, 7, 11, the \"augur\" (qSsēm) is mentioned together with the prophet. If there is no explicit disapproval of the diviner in either of these passages, neither is there any approval: both passages occur in oracles of doom prophesied against all of these persons. 17 These categorical distinctions are to be found in G. André, \"kāšap,.379 ״ 18 Harry A. Hoffner, \"ôbh,\" in Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament, G. Johannes Botterweck and Helmer Ringgren, eds., tr. John T.

Similarly, Joseph tells his servant to follow after Joseph's brothers and to accuse them of having wilfully taken his cup: \"Up, go after the men! And when you overtake them, say to them, 'Why did you repay good with evil? It is the very one which my master drinks and which he uses for divination'\" (Gen 44:5). The three divinatory instruments regularly associated with the Israelite cultus—lots (gSrāl),20 Urim and Thummim,21 and ephod22—have a distinct vocabulary associated with them. Unlike any of the words mentioned above, these terms are used primarily in connection with Israelites, only occasionally with non-Israelites,23 and invariably in a favorable, or neutral, context. Nowhere in the Hebrew Bible is there a detailed description of the method by which these divinatory instruments are used. Because of this, there is no way to compare the divinatory methods used in connection with the lot, ephod, and Urim and Thummim with the techniques used by the ob, höber, yidcônï, mënahhês, mëcônên, and qôsêm, all of whom were viewed as magicians by the writers of the Hebrew Bible. The decisive difference between the two groups is their association with, or estrangement from, Israel's religion and cultus: the ephod, Urim and Thummim, and lots are acceptable because they are Israelite, while the others are rejected because they are not. * * * In the New Testament \"magic,\" \"magician,\" and related terms are ascribed to persons based upon their perceived standing vis-a-vis Israelite religion and the putative power by which their works 19 E.g., Gen 30:27, 44:5, 15; 1 Kings 20:33. 20 Lev 16:8; Num 26:55; Josh 7:14; 14:2; 1 Sam 10:16-26, 14:42; Dan 12:13; Joel 1:3; Ps 22:18; Prov 18:18; 1 Chron 24:5, 25:8, 26:13.

Such accusations that Jesus was a magician are implicit in the New Testament and ex-plicit in the writings of the early church fathers. This seems to be clearly reflected in the \"Beelzubub\" passage recorded in Mark 3:20-26: Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat. When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, \"He is out of his mind.\" And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, \"He is possessed by Beelzebub! By the prince of demons he is driving out de-mons.\" So Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables: \"How can Satan drive out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come.\" The phrase \"by the prince of demons\" mentioned here probably refers to the charge of the use of demonic powers in order to achieve miracles.24 According to P. Samain, such an accusation of using demonic powers to achieve miracles is tantamount to a charge of \"magic\" since, in a Jewish context, prophets and other holy people were thought to validate their missions by the per-formance of miracles, while the outsider—those thought to be in league with Satan (including \"magicians\" and \"sorcerers\")—were also believed capable of performing wonders.25 This passage serves as a response to such a charge by claiming that one is hardly likely to use \"magic\" (that is, the agency of demonic powers) in order to drive out demons. The gospel accounts of the temptation of Jesus may also be un-derstood as showing Jesus rejecting conventional magical means to attain his goals. In this account, which is recorded in detail in Matthew and Luke, Jesus, following his forty-day fast, is tempted by the devil to tum a stone into bread, to leap from the pinnacle of the temple, and to worship him in return for all the kingdoms of the earth.26 The temptation story is commonly interpreted as relating to the question of religious versus political messianism. 24 Matt 12:24; Mk 3:22; Lk 11:15. 25 P. Samain, \"L'accusation de magie contre le Christ dans les Évangiles,\" Ephemerides Theologicae Lovanienses 15 (1938): 455. 26 Matt 4:1-11; Luke 4:1-13."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"However, since the power to turn stones into bread and to fly through the air is commonly claimed by wonder-workers and magicians, Samain suggests that the account of the temptations should also be understood as implying the refusal of Jesus to use magical powers to accomplish his goals.27 The charge that Jesus was a magician has been preserved outside the New Testament in both Jewish28 and pagan traditions.29 In the tractate Shabbat of the Babylonian Talmud, the following note is recorded in the midst of a discussion on impurities: \"Did not Ben Stada (i.e., Jesus) bring forth sorcery from Egypt by means of scratches on his flesh?\"30 The church fathers, among them Irenaeus, Arnobius, Justin Martyr, Lactantius, and Origen, were keenly aware of the charge—made by Jew and Gentile alike—that Jesus was a magician.31 In reply to this assertion, these early Chris-tian writers made no effort to distinguish Jesus' actions from those of a wonder-worker. Rather, they affirmed the divine source of his power and the prophetic predictions of his life and activities. It was a question not of the form of the wonders, but of the relation-ship of the purported doer to the person speaking or writing. Thus, 2י Ibid., 489; cf.

Based solely on superficial similarities between the acts of these (generally Gentile) wonder-workers and Jesus, an impartial observer might be compelled to apply, or withhold, the designation \"magician\" from both. But by his own definition, noted above, a subjective judgment is decisive in designating an individual as magi-cian: magic, according to Smith, is a term of abuse, and is used of an \"outsider\" who is viewed as being particularly subversive.32 Similarly, for the Jewish contemporaries of Jesus who believed both genuine prophets as well as God's enemies were capable of working miracles, it is less the nature of the act as its source that deter-mines whether or not it is miraculous in a positive sense. Colin Brown touches the crux of the issue when he notes, in his review of Jesus the Magician, \"Morton Smith's argument is an elaborate statement of the charge that, according to the Gospels, was brought against Jesus from the start, namely that his actions were evil, that he was demon-possessed and even in league with Sa-tan. ...

In the case of the Bible, the major factor dividing acts that might be termed \"magical\" from those that might be termed \"religious\" is the perceived power by which the action is per-formed. Acts performed by the power of Israel's God are, in the view of the writers of the Bible, by that very fact nonmagical, even where they may be formally indistinguishable from those that are depicted as magical. \"Magic,\" \"magician,\" and related terms describing practices mentioned in the Bible remain useful désigna-tions in discussions of the life of ancient Israel as long as one takes into consideration the internal categories of the writers of the Bible itself, retains a sensitivity to the subjective nature and poten-tially pejorative connotations of these terms, and remains aware of his or her own presuppositions in applying them. 35 Biezais, Wesensidentität, 30. 36 Based on empirical differences reported by field workers among modem nonliterate peoples, the anthropologist William J.

It is best to go beyond a \"scientific\" investigation of what the Talmudic rabbis thought of \"magic\" and instead utilize new paradigms for looking at rabbinic constructions of biblical figures and practitio-ners. In this essay I intend to examine the Rabbinic typologies and definitions of magic within the Babylonian Talmud from a cultural and literary point of view. I propose to ask new questions of these texts, i.e., what function does the label \"magic\" serve in Rabbinic sources? If we move beyond the \"magic'V'religion\" dichotomy, what can the jurisprudential discourse tell us about the nature of power in this culture? What sort of magic might be permitted and 1 BT Menakhot 65a: \"We don't seat any one on the Sanhédrin unless they are wise men, men of vision, men of stature, elders, masters of magic, and knowledge-able in seventy languages.\" Rabbi Isaac ben Yedaiah of Provence, in his Com-mentary on the Aggadot of the Talmud (MSS Escorial G.IV.3 26b-27a), claims that keshafim in this passage means knowledge of science and the true nature of the universe.

One believes it should be considered sorcery, the other that it should be considered blasphemy. It can be proven that it was Rav who maintained (that magic should be considered blasphemy) since R. Zutra b. Tuviah said in Rav's name, 'He who learns a single thing from a magician de-serves the death penalty.' Should you suppose that (m 'gushta) refers to sorcery, scripture reads, 'When you come into the land which the Lord your God is giving to you, you shall not leam to do (JPS: imitate) the abhorrent practices of those nations,' meaning that you do not learn it in order to practice but in order to understand and teach. It is proven!\""},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"who might practice it? What can the category of superstition tell us about illicit magic? In the last decade of the last century the great Hungarian rabbi and scholar Ludwig Blau published the first cross-cultural and intra-Talmudic study of Jewish magic, Das altjüdische Zauberwesen. Blau's study was not the first German monograph on the subject2 but it certainly has proven the most durable, for two reasons: it contains an outstanding philological investigation of the terminol-ogy of Rabbinic texts concerning magic, and it poses many excel-lent questions in comparative magic and ritual. Blau's knowledge of diverse documents which illuminated Rabbinic magic was impres-sive. The first to apply social scientific methods and move beyond the methodology of an intellectual historian, he anticipated the work of Joshua Trachtenberg's cultural history of Jewish folk magic and religion3 and Morton Smith's various historical studies of Jewish magic.4 Despite his enormous erudition and the critical questions he asked, Blau clearly adopted the Rabbinic explanation of magic ritual and practice and accepted the delineation of the subject set forth in the sources. This position was itself dependent on the biblical rhetoric found in Deuteronomy and the prophets. Rabbinic sources amplify upon the topic and condemn certain magical practice as a vestigial and superstitious remnant of earlier domi-nant cultures, chiefly those of the Babylonians and Egyptians as well as other \"foreigners\" who inhabited the land.5 Blau took such claims at face value.6 While we cannot a priori reject Rabbinic definition and classification of magic, we must not automatically 2 See G. Brecher, Das Transcendentale, Magie, und magische Heilarten im Talmud (Vienna, 1850). Cf Trachtenberg, Jewish Magic and Superstition (New York: Behrman House, 1939) for an extensive bibliography of early scholarship on Jewish magic, as well as the more recent Hebrew bibliography by M.

Egypt received nine of these, the rest of the world but one measure\" (BT Qidushin 49b). 6 Biblical writers were already designating magicians as \"outsiders,\" mem-bers of the hated outgroup. See Stephen Ricks' essay in this volume. My claim is that while the terminology connotes \"foreignness,\" the actual behaviors are more likely deviant Israelite practices which are internally problematic."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"view \"magic\" as it is characterized by \"native\" definitions. There is more evidence now that many of the \"vestiges\" of magical practice are not extrinsic to Judaism but essential to the core of Rabbinic religion and culture in general. It is in the Second Temple period, especially in the wake of the rhetoric of monotheism and diatribes against paganism, that sorcery and magic become part of a constellation of \"foreign\" or polluting influences.7 As Saul Lie-berman, Morton Smith, Jacob Neusner and others have argued, the rabbis were people of their day and in their own literature describe practices by all sorts of Jews that might be considered \"magic\" by their own definitions of the term.8 In my view, there are many rituals and beliefs that surface in the Rabbinic period. Equipped with a solid historical/philological method, Blau ex-amined the \"realia\" behind the Rabbinic statements and descrip-tions. His knowledge of Rabbinic sources was exemplary, and his comparative effort noteworthy. Despite his bold venture into what was considered embarrassing, superstitious or arcane behavior in his day (and for that matter in ours as well), he remained a rather condescending rationalist, and his scholarship was colored by his internal Rabbinic perspective. While he was indeed ahead of his time in construing magic as a subject of historical inquiry when it was condemned as unworthy of scholarly attention in fin de siècle Budapest, Blau chose not to investigate a host of related performa-tive rituals practiced by Rabbinic Jews, notably divination. Blau adopts the same condescending attitudes toward the \"primitive\" or the \"magical\" as post-Talmudic rationalists and his peers in Wis-senschaftliche circles. While Blau initiated a \"cultural history\" of magic in the last decade of the nineteenth century and Lieberman demonstrated the Greco-Roman legal and philological basis of certain magical motifs, Jacob Neusner reshaped the discourse on the use of magic by Rab-binic holy men. Here I would like to concentrate on taxonomy. The theoretical statements which lie behind the taxonomies are compelling because they show us a serious engagement with the 7 E.g., Wisdom of Solomon 12:3-5: \"Those who lived long ago in your holy land, you hated for their detestable practices, their works of sorcery and unholy rites, their merciless slaughter of children, and their sacrificial feasting on human flesh and blood.\" These charges are also grouped together in the Enoch literature and in Rabbinic sources. 8 Most recently a solid critique of Blau and other scholars of Jewish magic has been published by Lawrence Schiffman and Michael Swartz, Hebrew and Ara-maic Incantation Texts from the Cairo Geniza (Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1992). They have also called for a re-evaluation of Blau's survey of biblical magic."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"implications of magic and offer a glimpse into the Rabbinic consid-eration of marginal behaviors that are not fully idolatrous. * * * The first text for our consideration is Babylonian Talmud San-hedrin 67b ff., easily the most sustained discourse in Rabbinic literature concerning illicit practitioners and their activities. The Rabbinic reaction is catalyzed by the pronouncement in Deut 18:10-11: \"There shall not be found among you (JPS: Let no one be found among you) one who consigns his son or daughter to the fire, or who is an augur, a soothsayer, a diviner, a magician, or one who binds spells, or one who consults ghosts or familiars, or one who inquires of the dead.\"9 Any discussion of the development of Rabbinic attitudes towards a classification of magic must take into account the Rabbinic interpretation of this key prohibition. It is this Deuteronomic classification which externalizes \"magic\" and all its ritual varieties as a foreign implant. In Babylonian Talmud Tractate Sanhédrin, the discussion of magic and magicians does not simply evolve from quandaries found in the biblical proscriptions but takes on a hermeneutic life of its own.10 In this particular section (BT Sanhédrin 65a-67b) Rabbis Yoha-nan, Aibu bar Nagri, and Abaye offer terse but packed definitions of magicians and magic. We cannot assume, however, that we know what they are talking about. The first question, then, is not what is the historically attested \"magic\" they are referring to, but what sort of cultural demarcations are being made by the use of this term. The former question must be addressed but only after we are careful in defining our own use of such language. In Bavli Sanhe-drin, the rabbis are committed to defining and criminalizing the \"other\"—and legitimatizing the subjects of society. This Rabbinic \"other\" is shown to be a social deviant who is fenced out while 9 לא ימצה בך מעביר בנו ובתו באיש קוסם קסמים מעונן ומנחש ומכשף 11/וחובר חבר,See Carmichael .ושאל אוב וירעני ודורש אל המתים The Laws of Deuteronomy (1974), 46, and Daube, \"To be Found Doing Wrong,\" Studi in onore di Volterra II (Rome, 1969), for a rhetorical study of the Deuteronomic phrase לא ימצא בך. Carmichael, quite correctly I think, has shown it to be indicative of a \"shame\" culture. The prohibited figures are closely associated with false prophecy as well. On the meaning of \"abomination\" in Deuteronomy, see Weinfeld, Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic School (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972), 268-69. 1U My Ph.D. dissertation examines a variety of related topics that cannot be treated here, including the early exegesis of Deut 18:10, the Hellenization of the concept of magic in Rabbinic culture, witchcraft and gender, and the problem of folklore and magic."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"legitimate ritualists are fenced in. The text constructs for the reader that which is not \"other\"; its rhetoric works to persuade the as־yet unconverted observer, but this observer is already a knowl-edgeable listener who follows Rabbinic reasoning and rhetoric both legal and literary. Babylonian Talmud Sanhédrin, built ostensibly on Tannaitic precedent, is chiefly concerned with criminal law that must be decided by the most important tribunal of the land. It is very hard to determine whether the cases reflect \"reality\" in history or whether the discourse reflects hermeneutical development in and of itself, without interest in actual precedent and attested legal cases. One gets the sense upon reading the dialectic on magic that the rabbis might have commissioned performances of magic, especially if membership on the Sanhédrin required mastery of its mechanics or techniques. Justice Potter Stewart's comment about obscenity (\"I know it when I see it\"), quoted as an epigram by C. Robert Phillips, does not seem to fit here. Idolatry, a more serious charge, needs definition and clarification as well.11 \"Magic\" might be that suspicious activity which leads to idolatry, the first step in a lifestyle that eventually leads one to something worse. The legal statements are complemented by representations of magical activi-ties; these pictures of magic are drawn in colorful strokes in the folktales and accounts of praxis by Rabbinic heroes and their enemies.12 The Mishnah (Sanhédrin 7:11) offers an apparently simple definition of who is really a mechashef: The מכשף if he actually performs an act (ma 'aseh ) is liable to punish-ment while the one who merely creates illusions is not liable. The key word here is ma 'aseh, best rendered \"act\" or \"action.\" Creating \"illusion\" might be understood, of course, as a type of action.13 The context of this statement within Mishnah Sanhédrin 11 See the recent study of idolatry in Jewish thought by Halbertal and Mar-galit, Idolatry (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1992). 12 The brevity of the Mishnah's legal locution often demands exegesis and detailed explanation. As a case in point, the legal status of magicians is men-tioned only briefly in Deuteronomy, and the nature of magical practice is de-scribed in fractured, incomplete fashion in other parts of scripture. The rabbis would need more scripture text to establish law. It is in the filling of gaps that we are given contemporary data about magic and magical practice. 13 The Talmud (BT Sanhédrin 65a ff.) offers several humorous tales of trickery and deceptive \"stage\" magic that are apparently guilt-free activities—indeed, humorous and entertaining ones."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"is crucial to understanding the larger cultural concerns that produce such a distinction. The criminals enumerated throughout chapter seven of this section of the Mishnah are uniquely dangerous anti-social types, including sexual deviants, misleaders, and idolators considered worthy of ultimate retribution. Mishnah Sanhédrin, then, is deliberately concerned with establishing the exact nature of an act; if the act is not illusionary, what is it that must have taken place? A fraudulent showman, like the curser who does not use God's name, does not qualify as a threat to Rabbinic society. The illusionist may manipulate, but he does not \"act\" per se. In fact, in direct contrast to Greco-Roman legal literature, magicians are considered guilty not because of trickery but because of transfor-mation of that which should not be tampered with. Magical action utilizes natural laws in unnatural ways. Kishuf implies an abuse of divine/human boundaries; the rabbis felt that only rabbis, and only a select few, could tamper with divine forces.14 The Amoraim were left to wonder aloud about the nature of this distinction and the criteria for \"action.\" The Gemara in the Tal-mud provides further clues about the nature and the motivations of these crimes, and it continues with a discussion of the gender of the magician.15 Are these actions crimes against society, against per-son (i.e., against a person's body or will or both), against God and his heavenly host? Is magic essentially a crime of illlicit language, like the crime of blasphemy? The actions of a mekhashef do not offend in the same way that unauthorized approach or use of divine sancta offend (the crime of Nadav and Abihu), and yet they 14 This has been cogently argued by Neusner in his original article on the \"Phenomenon of the Rabbi,\" Numen 16/1 (1969): 1-20: \"... it follows that Torah was held to be a source of supernatural power. The rabbis controlled the power of Torah because of their mastery of Torah quite independently of heavenly action. They could issue blessings and curses, create men and animals. They were masters of witchcraft, incantations, and amulets. They could communicate with heaven. Their Torah was sufficiently effective to thwart the action of demons. However they disapproved of magic, they were expected to do the things magi-cians do.\" 15 The term used in the prohibition against witchcraft in Exodus 22:17 is in the feminine. Surely the Sanhédrin cannot condemn only women! The discussion leads to the opinion of inclusivity: it applies to both men and women, however \"(most) women engage in witchcraft\" (BT Sanhédrin 67a). Cf. PT Sanhédrin 7:13 (Leiden MSS) on the same verse: \"But (in mentioning sorceress) scripture teaches you about the way of the world in which the majority of women are witches.\" See now the articles by Simcha Fishbane, \"Most Women Engage in Sorcery,\" and Meir Bar-Dan, \"Witches in Bible and Talmud,\" in Approaches to Ancient Judaism (New Series 5), eds.

In my view it is best to see the offense as part of a conglomerate of ritual obscenity and disruption acted out by violators of the norms of Rabbinic power relation-ships. Halbertal and Margalit,16 in their study of idolatry in Jewish law and society, have emphasized the danger of alternative magic ritual as a \"lifestyle\" problem, one that borders on the overtly pagan. Practicing magic is but one step along the way to full-blown avodah zarah. Propitiation of demons, claim certain Rabbinic voices, might be construed as false ritual. Gender-typing of magi-cians is an important component of the borderline status of magi-cal practice within Rabbinic circles. Jewish as well as non-Jewish women are more likely to be suspected of practicing witchcraft than are men.17 In my reading of the witchcraft stories, Rabbinic exercise of apotropaic magic protects the male individual and corporate body from extrinsic powers that threaten the cultural agenda. Catherine Bell has described the ability of ritualization to create \"social bodies\" in the image of relationships of power.18 The Rabbinic \"social body\" is created by the textual community which must confront Jewish society without a traditional cult and sacred center. The boundaries of this corporality must be deter-mined through confrontation with the written and oral Torah. In Mishnah Sanhédrin and in the Bavli's amplification of the Mish-nah, the rabbis are concerned with the matrix of cosmic and social deviancy. Like the deeds described by the Greek term asebeia, often rendered \"impious,\" these crimes have serious social ramifi-cations. In the Rabbinic discourse they are treated as a violation of divine law—a violation which is so heinous as to deserve capital punishment.19 The criminality of malevolent sorcerers is given 16 Idolatry (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1992). 17 E.g., the story of Jannai and the witch who attempts to transform him through a magical brew (BT Sanhédrin 67). The only legitimate use of keshafim by women occurs in BT Gittin 45a, in which the daughters of Rabbi Nahman stir a cauldron with their bare hands. 18 Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice (New York: Oxford University Press, 1992). 19 Sorcery as a capital crime is particularly sensitive because, in one text, an anonymous Rabbinic source justifies Jesus' execution on the grounds of sorcery (BT Sanhédrin 43a). Historical opinions about the scope of jurisdiction of Rabbinic courts in capital cases have often differed significantly. Gedalia Alon (\"On Philo's Halacha,\" in Jews, Judaism and the Classical World [Jerusalem: Hebrew University Press, 1977], 111-24) compares Philonic criminal \"halacha\" with Rabbinic law and claims that the jurisdiction of these cases was exclusively in Jerusalem. This claim is countered by Urbach, The Halakha (Jerusalem: Yad"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"more attention in later Amoraic times. Earlier traditions indicate that proto-Rabbinic leaders executed sorcerers summarily without due process; such punishment is very problematic for the Amoraim.20 The powers of malevolent sorcery are themselves very real for the rabbis. They have direct consequences in many spheres, as is made clear from the next \"definition\" which follows in BT Sanhe-drin: Why are they called keshafim (magicians)? Because they injure the divine family (KikheSH Familia shelMa'ala) (BT Sanhédrin 67b).21 This brief but loaded explanation points to a classic Rabbinic rhetorical style in which terms are decoded with homiletic inten-tion. In typical midrashic notarikon fashion, which requires creat-ing a series of new meanings from key letters in the original phrase, the text supplies new meaning.כשפים keshafim is broken down, as is noted above, in order to make an important point. Kishuf signifies not only perverted and deviant behavior in an earthly context but a disruption of the cosmic \"family\" as well.22 LaTalmud, 1986), 59-71; 374 n. 17 who provides a thorough overview of schol-arshijp in this arena. 2\"Alon speculates that Philo (de Spec. Leg. 94-102) knew a Rabbinic ha-lachic tradition supporting the lynching of sorcerers without trial, since for Philo sorcerers are suspect of using lethal potions and are tantamount to the Greek φαρμακεύς (\"poisoner\"). Philo follows the Septuagint's tradition of interpreting makhshefa in Exodus as malevolent herbologists or pharmacolo-gists. It is difficult to say whether there was summary execution of sorcerers in early Second Temple \"proto-Rabbinic\" law. Such a claim here is tenuous and is based on shaky ground in Rabbinic sources—the story of Shimon ben Shetach and the execution of the 80 witches in Ashkelon. I cannot find any text which explicitly equates the crime of magic with poisoning but this is not to deny the representation of witches as lethal and the imminent danger one faces in confront-ing their powers. Peretz Segal (\"The 'Divine Death Penalty* in the Hatra Inscriptions and the Mishnah,\" Journal of Jewish Studies 39 [1989]: 46-52) discusses the phrase mittah b 'dei shamayim, \"death at the hands of heaven\" or \"divine death penalty,\" as it occurs in the Hatra inscription. He claims (contra Cohan in the Encyclopedia Judaica, 6.120-22) that this penalty was exacted immediately and not at an unspecified future time. It applied to one who steals a kisvah (Temple vessel), one who curses by magic (kosem) or one who cohabits with a Gentile woman (m. Sanhédrin 9:6). Might it also apply to a witch? 21 Soncino: \"because they lessen the power of the Divine agencies.\" Neusner, The Talmud of Babylonia Tractate Sanhédrin, chs. 4-8, esp. p. 216: \"because they deny the power of the family above.\" 22 This Talmudic phrase resonates strongly with language in the Talmud and in the extra-Talmudic Hekhalot corpus, where we find the \"cosmic family\""},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"In this locution we do not find a dispassionate phenomenology of magical action apart from its impact on divine and human society. In other sections of the sugya, however, it seems that the editors are interested only in mechanics and not cosmic theology or theosophy. Taken as a whole, however, we see that this particular homological reading demonstrates the Rabbinic philosophy of power: makhhishin implies a weakening, perhaps a wounding of the power of the angelic hosts (cf. Jastrow, Dictionary s.v. כחשp. 629),23 who in tum can become angry when summoned by practi-tioners. Misdirected \"words of power\" might result in some fright-ening angels appearing to the practitioner.24 This reading of kishuf serves a different but clearly strategic rhetorical purpose. The rabbis' homiletic etymology in this case shows little concern with the essence of sorcery but much more with its consequences. Through his spells or paraphernalia the magician wounds and weakens. The malevolent magician might be seen as a perverted or subversive theurgist who is jealous of Rabbinic power, as an envious outsider whose powers can indeed humiliate or injure the Rabbinic elite.25 For the medieval commentator Rashi this clause \"injures the divine family\" signifies that magicians \"kill that which was decreed to live\" (BT Sanhédrin ad loc.). Nachmanides' reading of this passage is even more relevant to our interpretation. The secret of all sorcery is the power of contradiction of the \"simple powers,\" Nachmanides claims, and is similar to violating the prohibition of kilayim.26 It is the mixing of cosmic forces that is so problematic terminology in numerous visionary texts. Familia, a Latin loan-word, is found in a Midrashic parable where it refers to a group or retinue who would accompany a king or distinguished person on a journey (Gen. Rabbah 39:10). 23 The verb כחש can be used to describe something much more mundane as well. מכחיש מצוה \"lessening a mitzvah\" in BT Shabbat 22a implies that one must perform the mitzvah of lighting the Hannukah lamp exactly as the rabbis specify it or else the light is diminished. 24 On the dynamics of performative speech in the Hekhalot incantations, see the essay in this volume by Rebecca Lesses. On attaining instant wisdom through magic, see the essay by Michael Swartz. 25to Rabbinic exegesis Balaam is often portrayed as such a malevolent sor-cerer whose speech is powerful but can be countered by more potent priestly amulets and gestures.

The Divine Body—here illustrated as a familiar collective—is indeed subject to alien power. One might take this a step further. The Divine \"male\" Body can become impotent when witchcraft infects or afflicts the supernal or terrestrial agents of this Body—that is, the angels and the rabbis. The rabbis are front-line defenders who are expert articulators in defining the real enemy. The implication of this reading remains problematic: is there another opposite \"power\"? Do God's designated representa-tives on earth and perpetuators of his revelation develop apo-tropaic rites and words that have cosmic significance? A proper reading of this section of the Talmud acknowledges the cosmic aspect of the struggle for power in its earthly manifestation; we have here a strategy for consolidation of Rabbinic power and its literary legitimation.27 * * # A comparison between Rabbinic magic and other synchronic discourse on magic, witchcraft and sorcery is vital, although I cannot pursue such a comparison at length here.28 It is particularly important to look at Rabbinic notions of magic and the demonic in comparison with other Jewish or contiguous societies of the first few centuries and especially at notions of the demonic and the magical in the New Testament.29 One might also successfully the essential biblical verses on magical practice. 27 See Alan Segal, Two Powers in Heaven ( Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1977), on the Rabbinic responses to the charges of \"Two Powers in Heaven.\" Do we have here a precursory notion of the Sitra Ahra, the \"side of the Other,\" before it is devel-oped in medieval Kabbalah? It is no historical accident that numerous exorcistic and incantational texts have been discovered in the Dead Sea Scrolls, some of which were produced by writers who pictured the world as both internally and externally polarized. 28 Saul Lieberman's small but weighty chapters on magic and charms in his Greek in Jewish Palestine (New York: Feldheim, 1965), 109-13, must still be consulted; Daniel Sperber has just published an important work on magical motifs in Rabbinic Judaism in relationship to folklore in the Greco-Roman world, Magic and Folklore in Rabbinical Literature (Tel Aviv: Bar Dan University Press, 1994). 29 Rabbinic conceptions of a realm under the grip of an evil, demonic agent are not as developed as in Luke and Acts. Susan Garrett (The Demise of the Devil [Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1989], 102) has written about the conception of the demonic magicians in the New Testament in general and in Luke in particular.

While the text does not detail the techniques of mastering demons as do the Hellenistic Greek handbooks, Solomon does demonstrate mastery of the famous Ashmedai in BT Gittin 68b. The Mesopotamian background of the Jewish versions of the Asmodeus tale (in Tobit and the Talmud) also points to a stronger Rabbinic connection to contemporary Iranian demonology.32 Rabbinic notions of illegitimate specialists preserved in the Pal-estinian and Babylonian Talmuds can be compared successfully suspicion of the recent secondary literature which emphasize Jesus' magical behavior. 30 The Testament of Solomon remains the best example of Hellenistic appro-priation of earlier Mesopotamian medical/magical guides. See the excellent translation in Charlesworth, Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, 2 vols. (New York: Doubleday, 1983), 1.960-987 and the discussion of magic and exorcism in this work by Dennis Duling, \"The Eleazar Miracle and Solomon's magical wisdom in Flavius Josephus' Antiquitates Judaicae 8:42-49,\" Harvard Theo-logical Review 78/1-2 (1985): 1-25. The characteristics of the demons mentioned there are expanded in the Talmudim, where they develop more \"character\" and \"personality\" and even play quasi-human roles in narrative. 31 This was noted first by Ludwig Blau and mentioned in the works of both Lieberman and Morton Smith. Neusner devotes most of his study of the Rabbinic magicians to the texts in the Bavli. My survey of demonological traditions supports this hypothesis, but we cannot establish with historical certainty the \"causes\" for a greater number of demon tales or citations in the Babylonian tradition. Might representations of witches, demons and tales of magic depend on the relationship to the hegemonic powers of the culture and the nature of political power within the Jewish community? 32 Ashmedai/Asmodeus clearly develops from the figure mentioned in the Gathas, aësma-daeuua, a demon of rushing fury who has bloody attributes. See Kohut, Über die jüdische Angelologie und Daemonologie in ihrer Ab-hängigkeit von Parsimus (Leipzig: Brockhaus, 1866), 72-80, on this demon, as well as Jewish Encyclopedia, s.v. \"Asmodeus.\" The earliest Talmudic manifesta-tions of the Solomon/Ashomodai legend is found in PT Sanhédrin 2:2 and BT Gittin 68a-68b; cf BT Pesahim 110a.

Paul's writings constitute the only inner view of a (once) Phari-see's notion of the operations of bewitching in the Jewish polity of the mid first-century diaspora. One might view his writings as one literary component of the nexus of early Jewish views of the dynamics of spells in local societies.33 The Rabbinic method of accusation is less uncompromisingly dualistic than Paul's, but the legal discourse betrays the same type of conceptualization about competing powers. A Mediterranean model, however, of competition between charismatic magicians must be distinguished from a Mesopotamian model, a task that is made difficult by the nature of the Rabbinic sources.34 Competition of this sort may reflect specific social configurations, political concerns, and relationships to colonizing, oppressive powers. Neusner 35 has aptly noted that it is the locus of the power that differs in contrasting \"us\" and \"them\"—not the actual magic itself but the source of the magic. I would refine the description of such a generator of cosmic magic by arguing that the \"other\" practitioner also derives his power from God but perverts that power. The threatening deviant practitioner is labelled \"magician,\" but what the cultural definers mean by that term shifts even among individual interpreters. Consequently, legitimate counter-magic may or may not be labelled kishuf. This dissonance of opinions and perspectives, so characteristic of much of rabbinic discussion, does not prevent us from seeing the representation of kishuf as mostly negative. The encounter with actual non-Jewish magicians raises other questions for the rabbis. In Babylonian Rabbinic society of the Parthian and Sassanian periods the rabbis came into contact with historical \"magi\" and sought to classify them in light of biblical categories. In one key pericope in the Bavli we see the differing views of the crime of the magus: \"One who leams just one thing from a magus הלומד דבר אחד מן המגוש חייב מיתה( \"deserves death [BT Shabbat 75a]). The context of this statement is a dispute between Rav and Shmuel over the classification of \"magianism,\" 33 Jerome Neyrey, Paul in Other Words (Louisville: Westminster/John Knox Press, 1990), 181-224, has convincingly shown that the matrix of accusations in Paul's letters demonstrates the operations of Mary Douglas' \"witchcraft cul-ture.\" Might the rhetoric that accompanies such classification be seen as a type of accusation at a local level? 34 Compare my dissertation. 35 In his introductory remarks in Magic, Science and Religion, eds.

Classifying this magushta as sorcery (Shmuel's opinion) would allow it to be taught within the curriculum of privileged rabbis, while classifying it as blasphemy (Rav's opinion) places even greater social boundaries around it.36 Neusner37 studied the functional parallels between rabbi and magus and found their roles to be quite similar. One of his most important points is that while the Zoroastrians may have seen the rabbis as Judaized magi, the Rabbinical stereotype is that the magus is a malicious grave-robber and mumbler. While this is correct, I would go further to suggest that the use of the term magus preserves an interest in the \"outgroup\" practitioner, who, in this case, might be classified as a blasphemer or a sorcerer. While the Talmud does not preserve very much about the religious rituals of the magi, it mentions Zoroastrian priests in a negative light.38 Babylonian Jewish sources, which preserve more extensive halakhic and folk traditions about magic than do Palestinian sources, more frequently associate impurity with demonic force. Indeed, in my survey of witchcraft stories and discussions I have found that impurity and demonology are more closely associated, and that witches are increasingly demonized as well. Chaos and disorder assume demonic character in these tales, perhaps reflecting Zoroastrian de-monological traditions.39 36 See Kohut, Aruch Completum, 1.113 for further discussion of the terminol-אמגושא ogy of amgushaמגוש]ת[ א and magush[t]a in the Babylonian Talmud. 37 \"Rabbi and Magus in TTiird Century Babylonia,\" History of Religions 6/2 (1966). 38Gittin 16b preserves the story of one Zoroastrian חברא who forcibly très-passes in the home of Rabba bar Hanna and seizes a candelabrum. On this and other related stories see the recent study of Rabbinic Judaism and Sassanian religious coexistence by Robert Brody, \"Judaism in the Sassanian Empire,\" in Irano-Judaica II, eds. Shaul Shaked and Amnon Netzer (Jerusalem: Ben Tzvi Institute, 1990), 52-62, and the study of Rabbinic society in general by Gafhi, The Jews of Babylonia in the Period of the Talmud (Jerusalem: Shazar Institute). 39 See, most recently, the important work on women and demonology by Jacob Lassner, Demonizing the Queen of Sheba (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993).

These traditions must be studied along with the Lilith legends and the magical bowls and amulets which frequently contain spells against the child-stealing witches called \"Liliths.\" In the magical bowls and incantations of the 4th-7th centuries, it should be noted, there are still male \"Liliths\" (lillin )."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"In the following terse statement concerning the nature of magic, R. Aibu b. Nagri quotes a tradition in the name of R. Hiyya b. Abba, who is commenting on the discrepancy in terminology used to describe the actions of Pharoah's magicians in Exodus 7: בלטהם belatehem refers to magic through the agency of demons; בלהטהם belehatehem refers to magic without outside help (BT Sanhédrin 67b). In this statement we find an example of what I. Heineman terms \"creative philology\"—an explanation of a variant spelling which allows the rabbis to import distinctions where the biblical authors may have intended none at all. Since nothing is superfluous in scripture and there are no real discrepancies in meaning, the additional \"h\" in the word used to describe the technique of Pharoah's magicians in Exodus 7:11 evokes automatic magic. Β 'lahatehem is compared to \"the sword that turns on its own\" .)]Gen 3r24[ להט החרב המתהפכת(40 This variant provides a con-venient locus for Rabbinic \"reading in.\" In the distinction drawn here between magical action with and without demonic agency we find an early \"native\" taxonomy of ritual. One cannot but be struck by the similarity to so-called \"primitive\" locutions about witches and magicians in contemporary ethnographies. This dis-tinction is clearly reminiscent of some social scientific observa-tions of African notions of witches and witchcraft/sorcery. For Evans-Pritchard's Azande tribesmen41 the sorcerer uses parapher-nalia to effect his power and can invoke agents with that equip-ment. The witch emits psychic, mental, malevolent energy either consciously or unconsciously. We need not, however, read Evans-Pritchards' theoretical discourse into the typology of Talmudic discourse about praxis. This Rabbinic association of demonic sorcery with magical technology also resonates strongly with contemporary Greco-Roman literary representations of magical practice and with reci-pes for ritual magic in the papyri.42 40The Hebrew here denotes constant turning, i.e., perpetual motion appar-entlv needing no help. 41Edward Evans-Pritchard, Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic among the Azande (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1976), 56-64. 42The papyri give us a way to look at ritual prescriptions which involve both methods carefully delineated by a presumed expert in these operations. The rabbis might indeed have had in mind the secretive writer of Greek, Latin, Ara-maic, or Mandaic curse tablets (defixiones) as a bona fide mekhashef. But the rabbis do not tell us with any specificity about any historical cases of sorcery or trials that included such charges."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"The next definitional statement about kishuf delves further into the techniques of the sorcerer, his intentionality and sphere of operation: Abaye said, \"He who insists on exact paraphernalia (43(דקפיד אמנא is practicing demonic ritual while he who does not insist is simply engag-ing in (non-demonic) magical practice (כשפים).\" Here is yet a more refined typology of magic which illuminates the character of demonic praxis and its relation to keshafim. As in our previous theoretical statement, Abaye associates demonic magic with the accoutrements of spell-casting and bewitching. The language here is worth noting: a catch-all term with a plural suffix is used. The singular kishuf is used only in the later strata of the Talmud and in medieval sources.44 Like the statement attributed to R. Hiyya quoted above, Ab-baye's clarification distinguishes between demonic and non-demonic ritual. If practicing magic constitutes a criminal act, what exactly constitutes the deviancy of demonic operations? De-monological magic requires specific technique and \"know-how.\" When demons serve as agents of magical spells or rituals, the nature of the crime changes. Are the practitioner and his non-human accomplice to be held accountable? Is the demon a willful, cognisant entity who collaborates in mischief? In the Greek Magi-cal Papyri we find several texts in which the magician employs an assistant or paredros.45 This tradition, I would claim, may have influenced the literary representation of the master-demon rela-tionship in Talmudic literature.46 In both the Talmud and the 43 The sense here I take to mean \"requires specific tools of the craft\" or \"specific technique.\" 44 See Aruch Completum s.v.    .כשף    45 See the essay in this volume by Leda Ciraolo on this subject. 461 do not mean to say that a linear literary borrowing took place. Rather, I would contend that these hierarchical relationships reflect domination and slavery in contemporary Egyptian and later Mesopotamian society. A demon, it seems, functioned as the least expensive slave on the market. The comparable compulsions of slaves and demons in Arabic folklore is a worthwhile comparison here. In the words of Hajji Khalifah, \"When the conditions are brought together and the incantations pronounced, God makes the latter like a mighty devastating fire, encircling the demons and the jinn until the corners of the world close in around them and there is no place left for them to hide, nor any other choice than to come out and resign themselves to do as they are commanded. What is more, if the performer is skillful, being of good conduct, and praiseworthy morals, God will dispatch powerful, rough, and strong angels to the demons to inspire them and lead them to obey and serve him\" (Kashf al-zunun, 8 vols., ed.

Fahd and into English by David"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"magical papyri, the boundary between demonic magic and \"human\" magic is not clearly marked.47 Paraphernalia might be included in the nexus of other types of illicit objects of worship and suggest an improper connection with the divine. The use of ritual parapher-nalia that suggest compulsion and binding are clearly problematic. And while the tools are taken into consideration in the legal dis-course, it is intention that is weighed most significantly. In a related sugya (BT Sanhédrin 65a) the rabbis compare the propitia-tion of demons with idolatrous worship.48 One of the questions that emerge from a reading of this section is, under what circum-stances might relationships with demons be considered acceptable aside from a magical operation? The Amoraic rabbis seem com-fortable with specific interactions with certain demons, albeit quasi-personal ones.49 Making legal decisions about the status of a magical action requires, it seems, research into the theory and mechanics of ritual relationships. We do not find such hair-splitting discussion, however, in the consideration of folk customs which also might come under the rubric of magic. * * * Like the Greeks and Romans, early Rabbinic Jews reveal a need to classify some actions as reprehensible but not quite so seriously anti-social as magic. In the following text from Tosefta Shabbat ch. 7 [Lieberman, TK Moed 25-29], BT Shabbat 67a ,)פרק אמרי( we encounter a taxonomy of practices which are not to be consid-Weeks, \"Magic in Islam\" in the Encyclopedia of Religion [Chicago: MacMillan, 1989J). 47 Vajda, \"Israel et le Judaisme,\" in Le Monde du Sorcier (Paris, 1966), 137, notes the following in his essay on Israelite and Jewish sorcery: \"En fait, la ligne de démarcation entre influence démoniaque et magie humaine n'est pas nette puisque aussi bien l'on reconnaît au sorcier le pouvoir de faire agir les démons.\" 48 Since the mekhashef and the hover hever are contiguous figures in Deu-teronomy, it is natural for the rabbis to conflate the two in several passages. In wrestling with the description of the hover hever, the text compares its essential crime—charming—with idolatrous propitiation of demons. \"Charming\" might involve illicit use of spices and fire: 'Ulla describes a particular type of Baal Ov as one who burns incense to propitiate a demon. The text continues, \"Raba asked him, But shouldn't burning incense to a demon be considered idolatry? Raba said, The Baal Ov in Keritot refers to one who burns incense in order to charm (לחבר). Abaye said to him, Burning incense as a charm is to act as a charmer, which is merely prohibited by a negative precept.

If it is not a remedy, is it (automatically) forbidden as an Amorite custom? No doubt that it was taught: If a tree is shedding its fruit, one paints it with sikra5Θ and sus-pends stones from it. Loading it with stones clearly diminishes its vital-ity, but painting it with sikra, how is that remedial? It was taught, \"And he will cry, 'Tameh, Tameh ' (impure),\" making his condition public so that people will pray for him. Following whose opinion do we suspend a bunch of dates on a (sterile) date tree? In accordance with this Tanna (who teaches the custom described above?). The subsequent discussion in the Talmud includes one startling tradition which is not to be considered of the \"ways of the Amorites\"—incantations for alleviating choking on a bone. This list of condemned practices51 seems to be part of a section of marginal behaviors collected together because of their popular persistence and legal questionability. That they are ipso facto pagan is not necessarily the case.52 The meaning of the term \"Amorite\" is unclear to scholars. The use of the phrase might indicate that it was appropriated and reinvested with new meaning in the Rabbinic period to describe \"in-group\" practices that needed to be pushed outside the boundaries of society. It may also have evolved as a clever pun on the Hebrew term for \"Roman\" (emori/romi). Contemporary Roman customs, well known to the Rabbinic writers, may have become assimilated to indigenous 50 A type of red paint which presumably was believed to cure or work apo-tropaically. 51 I.e., husband and wife exchanging names, chanting \"idolatrous\" incanta-tions, breaking eggs before a wall in front of chickens, dancing for kutah, cooking with silence or sound, urinating before a cooking pot, crying so that beans will cook more quickly. The parallel section in the Tosefta Shabbat (chs. 7-8) is perhaps the more comprehensive list of these barely acceptable customs. Lieber-man, Tosefta Kifshula Moed (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1962), 25-29, remains an essential commentary. See also the analysis of these customs in the article by Mireille Hadas-Lebel, \"Le Paganisme à travers les sources rab-biniaues,\" ANRW, 2.19.2: 397-485. 52 Contrary to the classification of them by Hadas-Lebel, \"Le Paganisme à travers les sources rabbiniques.\" The first important historical/philological study of these customs was accomplished by Heinrich Lewy, \"Morgenländischer Aberglaube in der römischen Kaiserzeit,\" Zeitschrift des Vereins für Volkskunde 3:24-40, 130-43."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Palestinian practices in the minds of the editors. The Darche Emori chapter presents a category of vestigial practices and practi-tioners—some of whom match the list of Deuteronomy 18:10-11—but most of whom are not mentioned in the Bible; these are obscure and marginal practices, and the editors have a difficult time establishing rigorous criteria for delimiting the category. While they are not considered toevot (abominations), neither are they to be tolerated, and one is warned not to practice them. The cultural context of these practices has been studied only in part.53 As Judah Goldin has noted in his study of Jewish magic, the lines between magic and superstition are not sharp and the criteria which estab-lish something as \"Amorite\" are somewhat arbitrary. One is re-minded here of Pliny the Elder's fulminations against magic and his recommendations for remedies, materials, and techniques that look to us very much like magic . The principle \"that which heals cannot be considered an Amorite custom\" (and hence is permit-ted)54 is itself arbitrarily applied. \"Healing\" remedies can be con-sidered magical in some cases and not in others. \"Healing\" is a socially constructed concept, and in Rabbinic texts this aphorism remains more of a slogan than an applicable guideline for ha-lacha.55 For the rabbis, a cure which utilizes improper, politi-cally/socially incorrect language is not a cure at all. In the Yerushalmi (Shabbat 14d; Avodah Zarah 2:2) a story is told to substantiate the argument that it is improper to be healed by a min—a heretic.56 One should not expect Rabbinic culture to evolve 53 Most of the studies seek exact parallels in superstitions of the Greco-Roman world.

In a recent article (\"Closure as Cure: Tropes in the Exploration of Bodily and Social Disorder,\" Current Anthropology 27/2 [1986]: 107) he writes about the social significance of sickness. 56 \"The grandson of (R. Joshua b. Levi) had a choking fit. A man came and pronounced a charm (lachash) over him in the name of Jesus Pandira and he recovered. When the healer went out he (R. Joshua) said to him, 'What charm did you say to him?' (The healer) said to him, 'Such and such a word.' He (i.e., R. Joshua) said to him, 'It would have been better for him if he had died and not been healed like this.'\" The name of Jesus can heal but that ritual is illegitimate and ipso facto outside the boundaries of the oral and textual culture that transmits such stories.

A good study of the criteria used in establishing a category of superstition (in dia-chronic and synchronic perspective) would be very helpful for future scholarship.57 As I have noted above, one important Talmudic reference (BT Menahot 65 a) lists the criteria for sitting on the Sanhédrin, and includes among the requirements that of ba 'alei keshafim, \"master of magicians\" or \"master of magic.\" What is meant here is most likely the ability to understand magical praxis in order to judge cases in which the criminality of magicians must be established. Other sources emphasize the possibility of teaching but not prac-ticing magic (cf. BT Sanhédrin 67a-b).58 Were there collections of magical traditions available to rabbis or learned male Jews? Did magic belong to the curriculum of well-schooled Pharisees or rabbis? In the following statement attributed to Abaye, the laws of magic are divided into three categories, much like the \"laws of Sabbath\": Abaye said, The laws of magicians are similar to those of the Sabbath. Certain activities are punished by stoning, some are not liable to pun-ishment, yet forbidden a priori, and others are entirely permitted. There-fore if one actually performs magic he is stoned; if he creates an illusion he is exempt but the action is still forbidden; and what is entirely permit-ted? Such deeds as were performed by R. Hanina and R. Oshia, who spent every Sabbath evening studying the \"Laws of Creation\" (Hilchot Yezira) by means of which they created a one-third size calf and ate it (BT Sanhédrin 67b). We cannot be sure that this \"entirely permitted\" type of magic may have emerged from a specifically Greco-Roman tradition of voces magicae. Specialists in many cultures have used unintelligible syllables and sounds to communicate with spirits. The text is fhistrating in its brevity: can this type of activity actually be considered kishuf— since kishuf carries overwhelmingly negative connotations in every other text? That certainly seems to be the Journal of Jewish Studies 28 (1977): 2. 57Judah Goldin (\"The Magic of Magic and Superstition\") has called atten-tion to this rather arbitrary distinction of healing and magic in his classic essay on the Darchei Emori. On the development of the concept of superstition see Dieter Harmening, Superstitio (Berlin: E. Schmidt, 1979), 33-42. 58See Rashi and Tosofot on both passages.

The linguistic special-ist/rabbi who is knowledgeable about cosmic semiotics can emulate the deity. Creation ex nihilo can be performed by legitimate and legitimized magicians. Ultimately, however, these linguistically talented rabbis create very imperfect humanoids in addition to calfs. They may be able to animate anthropoids, as in this proto-type of the Golem myth, but lack the finishing touches of the ultimate, divine magician. Whether the Hekhalot texts are actual handbooks for these magician/linguists is a difficult historical problem and an appropriate subject for another occasion.59 One can surely gain insight into the theoretical discussion of magic by examining \"realia\" that embody the textual history of praxis. The Aramaic incantation bowls and amulets, perhaps the chief examples of the materia magica of the Jewish world, provide a contemporary vantage point from which to examine Talmudic classification.60 I can only make some general remarks about this relationship here. In numerous bowls the magician promises pro-tection against the generic keshafim and its Aramaic equivalent harshin, and these terms are usually accompanied by ruchin bishin—evil spirits. In the magical amulets, for example, the scribe calls for the release of the afflicted from all sorts of witchcraft and sorcery, all malevolent writing, all evil spells and the evil eye.61 What strikes the reader in reading the incantational materials is their all-inclusive nature, and the connection of evil writings with 59 See the relevant studies of G. Scholem, J. Dan, P. Schäfer, D. Halperin, S. Wasserstrom, as well as various essays in Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought (1986) on early Jewish mysticism; also the papers in this volume by Rebecca Lesses and Michael Swartz. 60 Baruch Levine's seminal analysis of the language of the bowl texts, \"The Language of the Magical Bowls,\" in Neusner, History of the Jews of Babylonia, Vol. 5 (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1970), must be consulted, as well as the careful study of Schiffman and Swartz, Hebrew and Aramaic Incantations from the Cairo Geniza (Sheffield: JSOT, 1992), and the new collection edited by Shaked and Naveh, Magic Spells and Formulae (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1993). 61 Geniza amulet( שרץ כן ישתרון כל מיני כשפים וכל מיני חרשין וכל כתבין בישין,.g.E formulae).

As has been shown by Baruch Levine (\"The Language of the Bowls\"), Mark Geller (\"Taboo in Mesopotamia,\" Journal of Cuneiform Studies 42 [1990]: 1), and other lin-guists, there is an Akkadian incantational background to these lists and their style.

Yet even more is at stake. Early Rabbinic discus-sion breaks down the biblical list of Deuteronomy 18:10-11, and BT Sanhédrin presents the most significant theoretical discussion of \"magic\" per se. Going into remarkable depth, this discourse dissects magic considered from the perspective of criminology and penology, including rather sophisticated discussion of the inten-tionality of magical ritual and ritualists in the context of other related practices and practitioners. The \"laws of magic\" include magic which is prohibited a priori, magic which is prohibited only ex posteriori, and magic which, while permitted, can be performed only by special holy men who have knowledge of esoteric linguistic cosmology. In later non-Rabbinic ritual texts the term \"magician\" or \"sorcerer\" becomes depersonalized and is included in lists of de-monic agents; it becomes harder to distinguish between personal-ized demons and demonized persons.64 Demons and sorcerers are more highly gendered than before; there is a greater emphasis on the Lilith threat as well. The Rabbinic discourse on magic and its nature demonstrates the particularly Rabbinic tendency towards dissection of a behavior, action, or ritual, albeit with a decidedly Greco-Roman disposition. While Rabbinic literature is surely more dissonant and uneven than a treatise on magic or theurgy in Latin and Greek sources, it is concerned with classification nevertheless.

Swartz In recent years, there has been increased interest in the role of tradition in mysticism. One of the best-known examples of this change is the work of Steven Katz, who has edited important volumes emphasizing what he calls \"the conservative character of mysticism\" and the role of convention and culture in shaping mystical literatures and practices.1 In the study of Jewish mysti-cism, scholars have shown the extent to which the development of Kabbalah was meant to be a stabilizing influence in relation to Jewish tradition.2 These essays build on Gershom Scholem's in-sights into the tension between conservative and anarchic trends in Jewish mysticism.3 The issue of the function of tradition and society also plays an important part in the study of magic. The magician can be seen as functioning primarily as an individual, who has, in Emile Durk-heim,s formulation, \"a clientele and not a church.\"4 As Dürkheim puts it, W. Robertson Smith saw magic as \"opposed to religion as society is to the individual.\"5 More recently, scholars of ancient 1 See the essays in Steven Katz, ed., Mysticism and Religious Traditions (New York: Oxford University Press, 1983), especially Katz, \"The 'Conservative' Character of Mysticism,\" 3-60. 2 For example, Daniel C. Matt, \"The Mystic and the Mizwot,\" in Arthur Green, ed., Jewish Spirituality from the Bible to the Middle Ages (New York: Cross-road, 1987), 367-404, emphasizes the extent to which the author of the Zohar and other early Kabbalists saw themselves as guardians of the tradition by explaining the inner purposes of the commandments {ta 'ame ha-misvot). 3 See Gershom Scholem, \"Religious Authority and Mysticism,\" in On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism (New York: Schocken, 1969), 1-31. In pointing up this tension, Scholem emphasized the anarchic dimension of mysticism in history; see David Biale, Gershom Scholem: Kabbalah and Counter-History (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1979). 4 Emile Dürkheim, The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (New York: Free Press, 1965), 60. 5 Dürkheim, Elementary Forms, 61 n. 62, summarizing W.

For example, Ramsay MacMullen listed magicians, along with philoso-phers, astrologers and soothsayers, among the \"enemies of the Roman order.\"6 Moreover, those theories of social analysis that see magic primarily as an expression of accusation against objects of a community's social disapproval can also be related to the notion that magic is a subversive phenomenon.7 In these more purely social definitions of magic, it is identified not with the characteristics of a particular set of practices, but with its anti-normative status.8 According to this approach, it is not merely that magic is by definition subversive, but that subversive religious practices are by definition magic.9 However, there have been others, such as Bronislaw Malinowski, who have stressed the role of tradition in the validation of magical 1969), 264-65.

E. Evans-Pritchard, Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic Among the Azande (Oxford: Clarendon, 1937), led the way to this approach by focusing not on the practice of witchcraft but on how accusations of witchcraft functioned in the society. The implications of this approach are drawn out in Mary Douglas, ed., Witchcraft Confessions and Accusations (London: Tavis-tock, 1970); for its application to the Greco-Roman environment see Peter Brown, \"Sorcery, Demons and the Rise of Christianity from Late Antiquity into the Middle Ages,\" 17-45 in that volume. 8 For an early formulation of such a social definition see Marcel Mauss, A General Theory of Magic, trans. Robert Brain (London and Boston: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1972), 24. For the application of this idea to Greco-Roman religions see in particular Jonathan Z. Smith, \"Good News Is No News: Aretalogy and Gospel,\" in Jacob Neusner, ed., Christianity, Judaism and Other Greco-Roman Cults: Studies for Morton Smith at Sixty (Leiden: Brill, 1975), 21-38; cf. David D. Aune, \"Magic in Early Christianity,\" ANRW, 2.23.2: 1507-57, who identifies magic with deviant religious practices. For a summary and discussion of this argument see H. S. Versnel, \"Some Reflections on the Relationship Magic-Religion,\" Numen 38 (1991): 182-84. 9This theory thus cannot by definition center on a body of evidence for prac-tices alleged to be magical themselves. Nor, as Versnel observes (\"Reflections,\" 183), does such analysis \"preclude the existence of more concrete 'substantive' implications of the term.\""},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"practices.10 In an important essay, Hans Dieter Betz also empha-sizes this element of the rhetoric and self-conception of Greco-Roman magicians.11 This argument modulates the characterization of magic as individualistic or anti-social. The appeal to tradition would seem to indicate a magician conscious of social norms and shared myths. Moreover, historians in Judaism have observed that the Rabbinic leadership in late antiquity cultivated practices that could conventionally be considered magical.12 We can therefore delineate the polarity in this way: Can we who study magic speak, like Katz, of its \"conservative character\"? Do magicians reinforce the traditional values of their society? Or are they somehow subversive of them, appropriating divine and human power? Current research on Jewish magic suggests a deep ambiva-lence along these lines. This ambivalence is manifest in what can be called magical piety. This essay concerns two literary motifs and magical phenomena brought together under this rubric: the use of tradition, authority, and ideal figures in magical texts; and the use of magical practices to gain memory, wisdom and Torah.13 The evidence for these phenomena is selected from magical handbooks and amulets from late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, which are preserved in manuscripts from the Cairo Genizah and other collections, and from passages in the literatures of Rabbinic Juda-10 Bronislaw Malinowski, Magic, Science and Religion (Garden City: Dou-bleday Anchor, 1954), 74-75. Cf. Max Weber, The Sociology of Religion (Boston: Beacon, 1964), 20-31 and elsewhere, who relates magic closely to priestcraft and thus to old aristocratic elements in religious society. 11 \"The Formation of Authoritative Tradition in the Greek Magical Papyri,\" in Ben F.

The medieval German pietists known as the Haside Ashkenaz collected and annotated many earlier magical texts such as the Havdalah de-Rabbi Akiba and Sefer ha-Razim; how-ever, this does not necessarily mean that these texts themselves derived from circles of the ancient Jewish elite. 13 These discussions are based on research undertaken for my forthcoming study Scholastic Magic: Ritual and Revelation in Early Jewish Mysticism (Princeton: Princeton University Press, in press).

Much of the controversy sur-rounding the term magic has focused on how the notion of magic is applied to traditional, non-Western societies. Bound up with this issue is the question, raised throughout this volume, of whether there is something intrinsic called \"magic\" that can be separated from \"religion,\" and whether this dichotomy presupposes an evolutionary view that sees those societies that employ \"magic\" as inferior. Yet our use of this term need not imply this dichotomy. Indeed, to separate or rank magic in opposition to religion not only misstates their relationship, but limits the sphere of religion, which can encompass the use of ritual power for the individual's needs.15 Furthermore, for the history of religions in Greco-Roman antiq-uity and medieval Europe and the Mediterranean, the term magic has served a practical function. This volume is the result of a gathering of scholars who have recognized something of what they study in the term magic—even if some might think that term 14 The standard introduction to Jewish magic is Joshua Trachtenberg, Jewish Magic and Superstition (New York: Atheneum, 1982); see also Ludwig Blau, Das Altjüdische Zauberwesen (Budapest, 1897-98; Berlin: Louis Lamm, 1914).

In part, this is because there are specific literary forms in these cultures that have been identified as magical since the inception of modern historical studies. These literatures usually concern the use of rituals techniques, esoteric names and words for what are generally considered practical pur-poses. In this essay the term magic will thus be used within a particular heuristic frame of reference, as the applicability of the notion of magic to each cultural context must be decided on a case-by-case basis. In the case of Judaism, it is possible to use the term to de-scribe identifiable textual corpora having distinct literary traits. It is those literary characteristics, and not any preconceptions of the inherent properties of magic, that can guide us to a description of the contours of the phenomena described in this essay. In paying close attention to literary features of magical texts, we have the opportunity to listen to the voices of the magicians themselves, concentrating on their distinctive rhetoric and logic. Based on recent studies of Jewish magical texts in late antiquity and the earlier Middle Ages,16 we can identify three prevailing elements of Jewish magical texts: (1) the emphasis on the power of the name of God; (2) the intermediacy of the angels in negotiating between divine providence and human needs; and (3) the applica-tion of divine names and ritual practices for the needs of specific individuals.17 This characterization has the advantage of describing a type of activity that can exist within the framework of religious behavior, as each of its components can be found in other areas of ancient Judaism.18 Yet these elements come together in a fairly coherent way in what are conventionally called magical texts—especially amulets, handbooks containing incantation texts and ritual pre-scriptions. We therefore have a way of designating them that, like all heuristic terms, allows us to proceed in an economical manner. * * # In magical piety, magicians express their desires through some of the most deeply held values and priorities of the society and its 16 See the studies cited in n. 14 above. 17 See Swartz, \"Scribal Magic and Its Rhetoric: Formal Patterns in Hebrew and Aramaic Incantation Texts from the Cairo Genizah,\" HTR 83 (1990): 179; Schiffman and Swartz, Incantation Texts, 12-15. 18 Cf.

These can be expressed in the way myth and history are used in magical texts, their rhetoric, or the goals of magical activity. The magicians5 approach to their tradition and social framework can be seen most clearly in those literary genres that make magical use of tradition and mythic history. One of the most telling of these is the \"chain of tradition\" mo-tif.19 In this form, the magical practice, book, or name is said to have been transmitted from the biblical heroes through a succès-sion of ideal figures, who used it to perform their miracles and who owe their success as historical figures to its secrets. This motif echoes the famous Rabbinic \"chain of tradition\" that opens the Mishnah tractate 'Avot, which describes the transmission of Torah from Moses at Sinai: Moses received Torah from Sinai and handed it down to Joshua, and Joshua to the Elders, and the Elders to the Prophets, and the Prophets to the Men of the Great Assembly, (m. Άνοί 1:1) The chain of tradition continues to a series of Pharisaic and Rabbinic sages. As Henry Fischel and others have shown, this passage follows a prevalent Greco-Roman topos of scholastic succession.20 But the magical version of the chain of tradition deviates from the Rabbinic pattern in a significant way. A key example is the introduction to the magical manual Sefer ha-Razim. This introduction represents the book as \"one of the books of the mysteries that was given to Noah,\" and from Noah it passed to Abraham and from Abraham to Isaac and from Isaac to Jacob and from Jacob to Levi and from Levi to Kohath and from Kohath to Amram and from Amram to Moses and from Moses to Joshua and from Joshua to the Elders and from the Elders to the Prophets and from the Prophets to the Sages and so to every generation until Solomon arose to be enlightened by many books of wisdom ... for many books were handed down to 19 For a detailed description of this motif and its historical implications, see Swartz, \"Book and Tradition.\" 20 See, for example, Henry A.

That same powerful book thus now rests in the hands of the contemporary magician. The mishnaic chain of tradition validates the authority of the Rabbinic process of accumulated wisdom of Torah, passed down from teacher to disciple. The magical render-ing of this form, on the other hand, serves to lend power to a physical text, and to all who can get their hands on it. This motif, variants of which can be found in the Sefer ha-Malbush section of Sefer Raziel and other texts,22 is not confined to magical books. We also find it in an early Jewish magical man-ual, known as the Book of Medicines of Asaph the physician.23 The Book of Asaph also advertises itself as the product of divine wisdom given to Noah by the angel Raphael, and on to Solomon, and to Asaph the physician by way of the wise man 'Asqlepianos.24 The affinities of the introduction to magical books to that of the medical manual point up both the instrumental nature of the both texts, which are said to be effective for anyone who learns their contents, and the need for both to validate their techniques. Related to this model is a form called the magical historiola, also known as the \"epic motif' or \"magical antecedent.\"25 The 21 Margalioth, Sefer ha-Razim, 66. 22 See, for example, Sefer Raziel (Amsterdam, 1701), fol. 2b. 23 This medical text, which is deserving of renewed attention from scholars of Judaism in Late Antiquity, is probably of Byzantine origin. See Elinor Lieber, \"AsaPs Book of Medicines: A Hebrew Encyclopedia of Greek and Jewish Medicine, Possibly Compiled in Byzantium on an Indian Model,\" in John Scarborough, ed., Dumbarton Oaks Papers 38 (1984): 233-49, and the earlier studies cited there. The introduction to this book contrasts somewhat with the rather technical medical manual that follows; because of its textual affinities with the Book of Jubilees, it was printed independently by Aaron Jellinek as Sefer Noah (Aaron Jellinek, Bet Ha-Midrash [Leipzig, 1878, repr. Jerusalem: Wahrman, 1967], 1.155-56), and has often been treated as a late apocryphon by scholars unaware of its origins in the medical book. 24 See the Hebrew text in Suessman Muntner, Mavo' le-Sefer 'Asaf ha-Rofe' (Jerusalem: Genizah, 1967); Aviv Melzer, \"Asaph the Physician—the Man and His Book: A Historical-Philological Study of the Medical Treatise, The Book of Drugs\" (Ph.D. diss., University of Wisconsin, 1972), and in Jellinek, Bet ha-Midrash, 1.155. 25 On the historiola in Greco-Roman magic see especially David Frankfurter, \"Narrating Power: The Theory and Practice of the Magical Historiola in Ritual Spells,\" in this volume.

So may Menashe ben Shamsi find favor in the eyes of all children of Adam and Eve.26 The reasoning of this clause is obvious. The same favor shown Noah is asked for Menashe. This idea is a form of \"magical anal-ogy\" like that often applied to ritual actions.27 However, it can also be said that the rhetoric underlying this passage is related to that of zekhut 'avot, the Rabbinic doctrine of the merit of the fathers that informs talmudic stories and liturgical prayers.28 Ac-cording to this idea, the present-day community is deserving of preservation only because of its ancestors' deeds. One particularly striking expression of such an idea among many is a petitionary litany recited on Day of Atonement: He who answered our father at Mt.

TS Κ 1.168, employs a well-known talmudic story that Gabriel taught Joseph the seventy languages and added a letter of the divine name to his name.30 The midrash, as James Kugel has pointed out, is based on a textual anomaly.31 Joseph's name has an extra heh in Ps 81:6: \"He made a decree on Yehosef, when he went out over the land of Egypt; I heard a language that I did not know.\" The midrash thus speculates that Gabriel gave him both the extra letter and the \"unknown language\" mentioned in the Psalm. Our magician's innovation, however, is to put that fact to practical use by making that same name available to him and his client. Examples of this kind of extension of exegetical midrash to magical application can be multiplied in Jewish magic.32 This is a critical feature of the magical use of history, midrash, and textual exegesis. Unlike the canonical Rabbinic texts, the magical texts vividly make the historical case part of the mecha-nism by which the client receives the benefits of divine provi-dence. These forms are notable as examples of a pattern of magi-cal midrash or practical exegesis. They can be added to Steven Katz's description of esoteric uses of ideal figures in his essay, \"Models, Modeling, and Mystical Training.\"33 According to Katz, mystical experiences provide not radical exegesis of scripture but experiential confirmation of it: . .. this very use of allegory and symbolism, as well as other varied her-meneutical devices, functions to maintain the authority of the canonical sources under interpretation rather than to destroy or transcend them, as is usually assumed. That is to say, the presupposition on which the mysti-cal use of allegory and symbolic modes of exegesis depends is that the canonical books of one's tradition do in feet possess truth and authority claimed for them.34 And, it can be added, power. Magical writers' use of ideal figures serves at once to maintain their forebears' sanctity and to marshall 30 MS. TS Kl.168 lines 25-30; cf. b. Sotah 36.

This is nevertheless a variation from the scholastic process of Rabbinic exegesis that produced the canonical midrash on which the magical midrash is based. So too, the magical chain of tradition substitutes the concrete, instrumentally potent book or magical name for the dialectical process of Torah. The magicians thus manage to cir-cumvent the sanctioned channels of tradition and authority even as they invoke them. * * * In the previous examples, we have seen the terms and symbols of the traditional culture put to use for the purposes of magic. In the following description, we see the purposes of magic put to use for a central value of Rabbinic scholasticism—the pattern of traditional learning that is a central characteristic of classical Rabbinic Judaism, expressed as Torah. In Rabbinic theology, Torah constitutes both the substance of revelation and its content. To apply terms articulated for the study of ancient Judaism by Michael Fishbane, the idea of Torah em-braces both traditio—the way in which a sacred culture is transmit-ted—and traditium—the message of that culture.35 The study of Torah was both a ritual act and the sign of a great man. The authors of these genres, particularly the texts known as the Sar-Torah literature, sought to achieve this greatness through magical means. These texts range from brief formulae for improving memory to full-fledged myths of how the magical secrets for learning Torah were acquired by the elders in the Jerusalem Temple. The former texts are rituals and incantations for the \"opening of the heart\"; the latter are those texts within the literature of early Jewish mysticism, or Merkavah mysticism, known as the Sar-Torah literature. (See the following essay by Rebecca Lesses.) These concern the cultivation of an angel or \"prince\" who will grant the individual prodigious skill and—as is particularly significant—a spectacular memory.36 In order to understand this type of magic, it 35 Michael Fishbane, Biblical Interpretation in Ancient Israel, 6-19.

In late antiquity, magic was called upon to assist the individual in every conceivable aspect of daily life.40 Considering the impor-tance of memory in both the value system and the social structure of ancient Jewish society, we should not be surprised to see magical practices designed for the acquisition of memory. These are not restricted to Jewish magic; there are at least four memory spells in the corpus of the Greek Magical Papyri.41 Moreover, Ignaz Goldziher has documented extensively that ritual memory prac-tices were widespread in medieval Islamic and Jewish popular be-liefs.42 Dietary recommendations for the improvement of memory oc-cur in the Babylonian Talmud.43 Jewish magical manuals also contain recipes and ritual formulae for improving memory. This process is known as petihat lev, or \"opening the heart.\" Like their Greek and Islamic counterparts, these procedures usually involve a ritual of ingestion—of a particular substance, such as an egg, as in the talmudic text—or of a substance containing magical names or letters. In many such texts the letters are to be engraved into a cake and eaten; in others the letters are to be dissolved in a cup or bowl of wine and drunk. Following a notion attested for many cultures, both Eastern and Western, the ingestion of the letters prefigures the expected ingestion of knowledge.44 A magical text from the Cairo Genizah contains the following instructions: 40 For the range and distribution of purposes of amulets in the Genizah, see Schiffman and Swartz, Incantation Texts, 46-48. 41 PGM 1:232-47, 111:410-23, 111:467-78; 111:424-66 is for \"foreknowledge and memory.\" 42 L Goldziher, \"Muhammedanischer Aberglaube über Gedächtnisskraft und Vergesslichkeit; mit Parallelen aus der jüdischen Litteratur,\" in A.

Two similar rituals are found in a fragmentary handbook, TS Κ1 132. One instructs the practitioner to write three names in water, dissolve them, and drink the water. Another advises taking the water in which the names have been dissolved and kneading it into cakes. As Peter Schäfer points out, this procedure also appears in magical texts for wisdom and memory set into the Hekhalot litera-ture.49 In one text, an Aramaic ritual text inserted into Ma'aseh Merkavah in one manuscript, the practitioner is to write magical 45 MS.

In these texts, a narrative pattern takes prominence. They concern the success of the Sar-Torah practice in turning a poor student into a great one.51 Rituals prescribed in these narratives, in contrast to those for petihat lev, are rituals of abstention and ablution, involving fasts, ritual immersions, and the avoidance of all contact with impu-rity.52 Moreover, their goal, unlike most of the petihat lev rituals, is to bring a potent angel, the Prince of the Torah, to the practi-tioner. It is this angel, adjured by the divine names held by the Rabbi-magician and acting under God's authority, who bestows upon the human being extraordinary skill and cosmic secrets. In these, more sophisticated narrative texts, the scholastic nature of the enterprise is emphasized. In the Chapter of Rabbi Nehunia Version A, Rabbi Ishmael relates his distress because of his trouble in learning: A scriptural passage that I was reading one day I would forget the next, and a Mishnaic passage that I was repeating one day I would forget the next.53 When he performs the Sar-Torah ritual correctly, immediately my heart was enlightened like the gates of the east, and my eyes gazed into the depths and paths of Torah, and never again did I for-get anything my ears heard from my teacher, of study; nor would I ever again forget anything of the paths of Torah in which I engaged for their truth.54 Rabbi Ishmael's \"enlightenment\" consists not only of spiritual or intellectual insight, or encompassing wisdom.55 Rather, he has been 50 Schäfer, Synopse, §571-78. 51 Although these texts, which are sometimes considered to be mystical, do not always contain the specific adjuration formulae characteristic of incantation texts, they still place emphasis on the power of divine names to oblige the angels to act on behalf of individuals and thus fall well within the scope of this study. 52 On rituals in Hekhalot literature, see Ithamar Gruenwald, Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism (Leiden: Brill, 1980), 99-102; idem, From Apocalyptism to Gnosticism (Frankfurt: Peter Lang, 1988), 262-71; and Michael D.

Ascetic rituals and incantations for these figures, who sometimes descend in dreams, are found in Jewish and non-Jewish magical texts. They also appear in the Hekhalot corpus, and are often identified with the Sar ha-Partim, the Prince of the Presence. An unusual incantation for the Great Name promises a \"man\" who will visit the individual— perhaps like the \"man of dreams\" referred to in several Rabbinic sources, himself the ancestor, as it were, of the angelic Maggid who visited Joseph Karo and other pre-modern Jewish intellectu-als.56 This idea has numerous parallels in Mediterranean magic, most notably the paredroi of the Greek Magical Papyri, the super-natural \"assistants\" who will perform any task the conjurer com-mands.57 The Sar-Torah and related magical literature maintain the scholastic virtues of Torah study, reverence for authority and respect of protocol. But unlike the Babylonian Rabbis, whose magical power was said to be derived from their mastery of To-rah,58 these practitioners sought to acquire Torah—as well as its tangible social benefits—through their magic.

In the first case, we have seen how Rabbinic notions of tradition and scholastic succès-sion serve the cause of the magical text or ritual. In the second, we have seen how techniques drawn from the literature of Jewish and Mediterranean magic are deployed for the purposes of increasing the individual's prowess in what Rabbinic Jews considered to be the greatest form of piety—the study of Torah. In each case, the phenomenon's indebtedness to the central values of the society is offset by a tendency at odds with those values. The magical text not only uses the ideal figures and chains of tradition for purposes not intended by the originators of those patterns of succession, but circumvents the scholastic process by which only a dialectical system of learning and discipleship can reveal God's word to the individual. The same is true for the Sar-Torah and memory rituals. They seek to bypass the Rabbinic academic process by offering a kind of magical shortcut to the success and prestige of a sage. These factors have subtle social ramifications. By seeking media-tion between the priorities of the elite and the needs of the indi-vidual, our practitioners both acknowledge their dependence on the larger society and create an avenue for their own power. Is the magician a subversive? If we consider it subversive to em-ploy a system's values for purposes not necessarily advocated by that system, then the Jewish magician may be one. Jewish magi-cians seem to have functioned in Jewish societies neither as out-casts nor as those who held the reigns of power. The proliferation of magic among all classes of late-antique and medieval Jewish societies suggests that magicians were tolerated, if suspiciously, by official society.59 Yet their attitude to human authority was one of ambivalence. They appropriated the image and charisma of the Rabbis and biblical sages for their praxis, thus siphoning off, as it were, a bit of their power but not seizing it entirely. 59 On the social standing of the Genizah magicians and their clients, see Schiffinan and Swartz, Incantation Texts, 49-52."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"With regard to divine authority, Jewish magic is clear.

We might therefore say that our magicians are addressing, in their own way, the problem of providence. How does the divine providential power arrive at the level of the individual?

I also acknowledge the support of a Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad Grant for the period of October 1992 ־ August 1993; for part of the time of the grant I was revising this article. 2 The adjuration of the Sar ha-Panim is found in four large medieval European manuscripts of the Hekhalot literature: MS New York JTS 8128, MS Oxford 1531 (Michael 9), MS Munich 40, and MS Dropsie 436. The first three manuscripts are Ashkenazic, and the last one is Sephardic. None is earlier than the 14th century (Peter Schäfer, ed., Synopse zur Hekhalot-Literatur [Tübingen: Mohr, 1981], IX). The Hekhalot material contained in these four manuscripts has been published in the Synopse in paragraphs §623 to §639. Part of paragraph §623 is also repre-sented in one of the Geniza fragments of the Hekhalot literature, T.-S. Κ 21.95.S. This fragment has been dated to before the 9th century (Peter Schäfer, ed., Geniza-Fragmente zur Hekhalot-Literatur [Tübingen: Mohr, 1984], 10). The adjuration of the Sar ha-Panim appears to be self-contained; it does not obviously belong to any of the other larger groupings of Hekhalot material (Peter Schäfer, \"Die Beschwörung des sar ha-panim: Edition und Übersetzung,\" in idem, Hekhalot-Studien [Tübingen: Mohr, 1988], 120). There appear to be two recensions of the adjuration: one represented by the European manuscripts, and one by the Geniza fragment. Within the European manuscripts, MSS Munich 40 and Dropsie frequently give the same readings, and seem to be closer to MS Oxford than to MS New York. As Schäfer remarks,^ MS New York has many special readings (Schäfer, \"Die Beschwörung des Sar ha-Panim,\" 122). The Geniza fragment of §623 is significantly different from the other manuscripts, but clearly comprises the same introductory paragraph of instructions. The Hekhalot literature has been dated anywhere from the 3rd to the 9th cen-tury CE, originating in Palestine or Babylon. Recently, Michael Swartz has traced a process of development of one Hekhalot text from 4th century Palestine through to Babylon in the 9th-10th century (Mystical Prayer in Ancient Juda-ism [Tübingen: Mohr, 1992], 216-20). In my discussion, I will assume that a similar process of development is true for many of the Hekhalot texts.

The adjuration is introduced by ascetic preparations, goes on to a four-fold adjuration of the angel by divine and angelic Names, and ends with the dismissal of the angel from the presence of the adept. The adjuration begins with an initial pseudepigraphic framing paragraph in which Rabbi Aqiba asks Rabbi Eliezer the Great how one can \"adjure the Prince of the Presence to descend to earth to reveal to man secrets of above and below ... secrets of wisdom and subtlety of knowledge.\"4 It continues with Rabbi Eliezer5s account of how he once caused the Prince of the Presence to descend in such a way that he sought to destroy the world. The narrative then moves from a dialogue between Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Aqiba to the narrator's instructions addressed to the implied reader of the incantation.5 The narrator gives instructions on how to bring down the Prince of the Presence in a safe manner: The one who binds himself to make theurgic use of him ( le-histammes bo) should sit in fast one day, and before that day he should sanctify him-self seven days from seminal emission (keri), dip himself in the water-canal, and not have conversation with his wife.6 At the end of the days cf his fasting and purification, on the day of his fast, he should go down and sit in water up to his neck, and say before he adjures ... J The words \"The one who binds himself to make theurgic use of him\" could refer back to Rabbi Aqiba but also potentially to the implied reader of the passage—or even both at the same time, justifying the reader's (possibly) engaging in the adjuration by reference to the authority of Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Aqiba. Fol-lowing the instructions come an adjuration to defend the adjurer against the dangerous angels who injure those who are not worthy, a mention of the 42-letter Name of God by which the adjurer seals 3 §634. 4 §623. 5 The shift from dialogue to address of the implied reader is clearer in the ver-sion of the text found in the Geniza fragment (see note 37, which gives a transla-tion of the entire Geniza text). For an initial discussion of reader-response criticism, from which the term \"implied reader\" is taken, see Steven Mailloux, \"Learning to Read: Interpretation and Reader-Response Criticism,\" in Studies in the Literary Imagination 12 (1979): 93-108. 6 Only MS New York has the words ,im ,ishto (\"with his wife\"); the other European manuscripts merely say, \"should not have conversation.\" 7 This translation follows the New York manuscript."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"himself for strength and protection,8 and finally a rendition of the adjuration itself by which נ Ozhay3 a, the Prince of the Presence, can be brought down to earth.9 The initial paragraph provides a Rabbinic framework for the adjuration and instructions for purifi-cation, while the subsequent sections of the text include an adjura-tion against harm as well as the actual adjuration of the Prince of the Presence. Rabbi Eliezer's words to Rabbi Aqiba seem intended to provide a Rabbinic testimony for the authenticity, effective-ness, and licit nature of the practice which the text describes. In this essay I use J. L. Austin's theory of the performative use of language to analyze the adjuration as a ritual.10 Austin's theory of language is appropriate for the analysis of adjurations and other ritual speech, because it accounts both for the active force of words and for the ritual setting within which they have their force. Thus, my analysis considers both the preparations that the adjurer must undergo and the words of adjuration that he speaks to the angels. I will first outline Austin's theory, and then show how it can be applied to the initial paragraph of instructions and to the words of the adjuration itself. However, before I begin, I will briefly discuss some of the problems caused by the literary nature of the evidence for the adjuration, which might stand in the way of analyzing it as a ritual. As I have described above, the adjuration is placed within the framework of a pseudepigraphic dialogue between Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Aqiba. All that is available is a literary presentation of the ritual.11 We cannot observe it to see how someone might actually have performed it, ask the participant what it means to him and what his experience of it is, or even know if the ritual was ever actually performed.12 However, although the text of this particular 8 §§624-25. I refer to the adjurer in the masculine because the text instructs the adept to purity himself from seminal emission. 9 §§626-38. 10 The discussion will be based on Austin's How to Do Things with Words, eds. J. O. Urmson and Marina Sbisa, 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1975). For a definition of ritual, see Stanley Tambiah, \"A Performative Approach to Ritual,\" in idem, Culture, Thought and Social Action: An Anthro-pological Perspective (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1985), 128. One of the signal disadvantages to working with historical texts rather than observing present-day rituals is, of course, the fact that only the literary mention of the ritual remains. This is a particular problem in the Hekhalot texts, which present almost all of the rituals of adjuration in the framework of pseudepi-graphic dialogues between Tannaitic rabbis, and do not in any case provide a first-person account. 12 For a later period there is evidence for actual use of invocation rituals."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"adjuration does not provide enough evidence to decide if anyone ever recited it, there is ample evidence both from the land of Israel and from Babylon in the late Byzantine/early Arab period that both Jews and non-Jews made use of incantations and amulets for many different purposes.13 My analysis of the ritual only seeks to understand the directions and the adjuration itself within the liter-ary Hekhalot setting of the text, rather than in an actual perform-ance. In any case, the instructions for the adjuration of the Prince of the Presence do not give many details on what the adjurer should experience, except to say that the angel should speak to him as a man speaks to his friend; it does not contain a report of his experience. An additional limitation on the scope of what it is possible to leam from the text is imposed by its presentation as ritual. Ritual is conventionalized action; rituals are not meant to express the intentions, emotions, and states of mind of individuals in a direct, spontaneous, and natural way.14 For this reason, and Keith Thomas says about the \"notory art\" practised in 17th century England: \"There is no doubt whatsoever that these rituals were extensively practiced, both by contemporary intellectuals and by less educated would-be magicians. The so-called 'Books of Magic* often found in manuscript collections of the period contain quite explicit formulae for invoking spirits, and there is no shortage of evidence for such séances in the manuscript 'Books of Experiments' which have survived\" (Religion and the Decline of Magic [New York: Scribner's, 1971], 230). At least some of these invocations drew on earlier Jewish adjurations (Thomas refers to the Key of Solomon, which includes invocations based on Jewish traditions). 13 See many of the incantation bowls from Babylonia; the bowl-texts refer to the expulsion of demons from all parts of a person's house (Charles Isbell, Corpus of the Aramaic Incantation Bowls [Missoula: Scholars Press, 1975]). Both the incantation bowls and the Aramaic amulets from the land of Israel call on angels to help the person named in the amulet. See, for example, amulet 7 in Joseph Naveh and Shaul Shaked, Amulets and Magic Bowls: Aramaic Incantations of Late Antiquity, 2nd ed. (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1987), 68-69: \"Put mercy from heaven on ŠLWNH. In the name of Michael, Raphael, cAzael, cAzriel, 5Ariel ... you holy angels who stand in front of the throne of the great God.\" There is also evidence for the use of other adjurations that are related to the adjuration of the Sar ha-Panim. See, for example, the series of prayers/adjurations known as Sheva Zutarti, which is built on the framework of the prayer of the cAmidah recited on the Sabbath. There are several Geniza fragments of this text (published in P. Schäfer, Geniza-Fragmente, 135-158), and MS Oxford 1531 (Michael 9) also preserves a version. The Geniza fragments present the adjurations as a formulary, without the name of a specific person, while the scribe of the Oxford manuscript (Yedidyah b. Yitzhak ha-Levi) has filled in his name at appropriate points (fol. 115a-116b). 14 Stanley Tambiah, \"A Performative Approach to Ritual,\" 132."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"because of the literary nature of the evidence, the experience or feelings of the person who might have enacted the ritual of the adjuration of the Prince of the Presence will not become clear in an analysis of the adjuration. It will only be possible to determine what this person should experience, not what he actually does experience. # * * The English philosopher of language, J. L. Austin, developed a theory of verbal utterances as performers of action, not only as descriptive of action. The term performative utterance \"indicates that the issuing of the utterance is the performing of an action—it is not normally thought of as just saying something.\"15 Austin initially opposed the \"performative\" to the \"constative\" (which describes or reports), but then came to see them as existing on the same continuum. The quintessential example of the performative utterance is the marriage ceremony: \"When I say, before the registrar or altar, &c., '1 do,' I am not reporting on a marriage: I am indulging in it.\"16 According to Austin, the most obvious and easily defined performative utterance is phrased in the first person singular present indicative active.17 An explicit performative utterance, in order to work, must be spoken in certain defined circumstances. This is where Austin's theory seems to be most useful for the analysis of ritual, since many rituals (particularly a carefully constructed one like the adjuration of the Prince of the Presence) must take place in cer-tain circumstances in order to work.18 John Searle, who built on Austin's speech-act theory, also notes the importance of what he calls the \"institutional facts.\" As he says, \"It is only given the institution of marriage that certain forms of behavior constitute Mr. Smith's marrying Miss Jones.\" A \"system of constitutive rules\" undergirds an institution; in fact, this system creates the institution, and it is only by acting according to the rules of the institution that one can felicitiously act.19 I will discuss these 15 Austin, How to Do Things with Words, 6-7. 16 Ibid., 6. 17 Ibid., 56. 18 See Austin's references to the utility of his conditions with reference to discussion of rituals, 19 and 25. 19 John Searle, Speech Acts: An Essay in the Philosophy of Language (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1969), 51-52."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"circumstances (or \"constitutive rules\") first, and then go into a discussion of the varieties of the performative utterance itself. Austin describes six conditions which govern the successful op-eration of a \"highly developed explicit performative,\" and he calls the possibilities of what can go wrong the doctrine of the \"Infelicities.\" The Infelicities can apply to any ritual or ceremo-niai act, even one which contains no words at all.20 In contrast to a constative utterance, a performative utterance can be \"happy\" or \"unhappy,\" rather than right or wrong. His six conditions are as follows: (A. 1) There must exist an accepted conventional procedure hav-ing a certain conventional effect, that procedure to include the uttering of certain words by certain persons in certain circumstances, and further, (A. 2) the particular persons and circumstances in a given case must be appropriate for the invocation of the particular pro-cedure invoked. (B. 1) The procedure must be executed by all participants both correctly and (B. 2) completely. (C. 1) Where, as often, the procedure is designed for use by per-sons having certain thoughts or feelings, or for the inaugu-ration of certain consequential conduct on the part of any participant, then a person participating in and so invoking the procedure must in fact have those thoughts or feelings, and the participants must intend so to conduct themselves, and further (C. 2) must actually so conduct themselves subsequently.21 While Austin concentrated on the social circumstances which allowed an utterance to have force, many of those who followed him in developing speech-act theory focused instead on the inten-tions of the individual who is speaking. For example, Searle \"uses 'promising,'—in place of Austin's oath of marriage ... —to serve 20 Austin, How to Do Things with Words, 25. 21 Ibid., 14-15."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"as paradigmatic of our ways of 'doing things with words.\"'22 In doing so, he concentrated on the \"good intentions\" of the one doing the promising, rather than emphasizing the social rules that make it possible to promise.23 In my analysis, however, I will be following Austin's initial impulse to focus on the norms governing a given ritual, rather than on the intentions of the one participât-ing in the ritual, because the adjuration of the Prince of the Pres-ence (including the introductory dialogue section) provides no information about the expected or real state of mind of the ad-jurer. It only gives information on the state of purity that the adjurer must attain, where he must recite the adjuration, and the words of the adjuration itself. What exactly is a performative utterance? Austin developed a three-fold distinction between locutionary acts, illocutionary acts, and perlocutionary acts. A locutionary act is the act of saying something: making noises, which are words in a certain grammati-cal construction, which have a meaning. Thus any speech act \"does something,\" in this sense.24 The question is whether it does more than that. An illocutionary act is the performance of an act in saying something.25 It is a conventional act, done as conforming to a convention.26 \"Something happens\" when one performs an illocutionary act because one acts within an already established framework in which one's words have an effect (i.e., the \"felicitious conditions\" outlined above are met). If one's words meet with failure it is because one of the conditions has not been met. A perlocutionary act is one which produces certain conse-quential effects upon the feelings, thoughts, or actions of the audience, or of the speaker, or of other persons, and it may be done with the design, intention, or purpose of producing them.27 It is not a conventional act. To give a brief example which may make these distinctions clearer: A locution is: \"He said that . . .\" An illocution is: \"He argued that ...\" A perlocution is: \"He con-vinced me that . . .\"28 There is a difference of emphasis between illocutionary and perlocutionary acts: an illocutionary act focuses 22 Michelle Z.

Austin describes five general classes of \"illocutionary forces of an utterance,\" which were subsequently revised by Searle.29 His five illocutionary forces consist of verdictives (the giving of a verdict or a reckoning), exercitives (exercising power), commissives (promising or undertaking to do something), behabitives (relating to attitudes and social behavior), and expositives (making plain how people use words in the course of an argument or conversa-tion).30 The second and third categories, exercitives and commis-sives, are most commonly found in the adjuration. Austin defines exercitives as the \"exercising of powers, rights, or influence . . . [Their] consequences may be that others are 'compelled' or 'allowed' or 'not allowed' to do certain acts.\"31 Examples that he gives are: appoint, dismiss, name, order, choose, command.32 About commissives Austin says, \"The whole point of a commis-sive is to commit the speaker to a certain course of action.\" Ex-amples which he gives are: bind myself, give my word, vow.33 Τ ο sum up these two categories, \"the exercitive is an assertion of 29 Ibid., 150-51. At this point Austin changes his terminology from \"illocutionary act\" to \"illocutionary forces\" to refer to the general type of force of a verb in a particular category. See John Searle, \"A Taxonomy of Illocutionary Acts\" in Expression and Meaning: Studies in the Theory of Speech Acts (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979): 12-20. 30 Austin, 151-152. Searle's taxonomy includes assertives, directives, com-missives, expressives, and declarations. Although I follow Austin's categories here, I think that his categorization would be more complete if Searle's category of \"declarations\" was added. \"Declarations bring about some alteration in the status or condition of the referred to object or objects solely in virtue of the feet that the declaration has been successfully performed\" (Searle, 17). Examples would be \"I resign,\" \"You're fired,\" \"War is declared,\" etc. Austin puts these into the category of \"exercitives,\" but it seems to me that there is a sufficient difference between these types of declarations and other exercises of power to justify an additional category. This is an area where more research is needed with specific reference to the types of illocutionary forces found in the Hekhalot adjurations (as M. Rosaldo did in the classification of illocutionary forces in Ilongot speech). 31 Ibid., 151.

In the analysis that follows I consider first the conditions or circumstances that govern the adjuration of the Prince of the Presence, going through Austin's conditions of \"Felicity\" in order, and then I go on to analyze the specific utterances that the adjurer speaks in order to bring down the angel, showing particularly how the verbs of adjuration work together with the Names of God to produce the illocutionary effect. Before beginning the analysis itself, I provide at this point a translation of the introductory paragraph of instructions (§623), and an overview of the contents of the adjuration. Overview of the Adjuration of the Prince of the Presence (<Synopse §623-639) 1. [§623, according to MS New York] Rabbi Aqiba asked Rabbi Eliezer the Great, \"How do they ad-jure the Prince of the Presence to descend to earth, to reveal to man secrets of above and below, depths of foundations of above and below, secrets of wisdom and subtlety of knowledge?\" He said to me, \"My son, one time I caused him to descend, and he sought to destroy the entire world, for he is the mighti-est prince among all the heavenly retinue, and stands always and serves before the king of the world, in cleanness, separation (perishut), purity, fear and awe, for the glory of his creator, for the Shekhinah is with him in every place.\" I said to him, \"Rabbi, behold, I bind him sevenfold,35 accord-ing to the instruction which you taught me,36 at the time that I bind myself to make theurgic use of him (le-hištammeš bo).\" 34 Ibid., 163. 35 The notes to the German translation of this passage suggest that the word translated here \"sevenfold\" (ßBcH) could be a mistake for \"oath\" (SBWCH). See Peter Schäfer, ed., Übersetzung der Hekhalot-Literatur IV, §§598-985 (Tübingen: Mohr, 1991), 19. 36 This is an emendation, based on a combination of MS New York and MS Dropsie.

He said to him, 'The one who binds himself to make theurgic use of him should sit in fast one day, and before that day he should sanctify himself for seven days, and on the eighth day, the day of his purification ...\"' (the fragment breaks off at this point).

The second part of this Adjuration orders the angel not to pre-vent the adjurer's words from operating and not to change his decree. (§638) 11. Dismissal of the Prince of the Presence—\"Ascend in peace,\" followed by a protective charm in Aramaic against de-mons. (A.l.) Austin's first condition calls for an \"accepted conven-tional procedure having a certain conventional effect.\" The fram-ers of the Hekhalot adjuration believed that certain letters, the letters of God's Name, were used by God in creating the world.38 The adjuration asserts that God himself set up the conventional procedure in which the Names have power if they are spoken by human beings: \"about them you were ordered and warned from the mouth of the Highest that if you heard an oath by these Names, do honor to your Name, and hurry and descend and do the will of your adjurer\" (§636). God himself warned the angels that if they heard these Names they must obey the one who speaks them. This is not a procedure originated by human beings; it has divine authority behind it. Human utterance of the divine Names has divine power behind it. According to Austin's analysis, performative utterances have an effect because they act within the institutions of human society. The particular culture within which this adjuration was composed and used saw the human and divine realms as intimately con-nected.39 Society extended beyond the human to include angels, 38 See §§16, 57-60, 634. 39 For an overview of the larger framework of Hekhalot texts of which the ad-juration is a part, see Peter Schäfer, The Hidden and Manifest God (Albany:"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"demons (who do not play an important role in the Hekhalot texts), and God, and thus performative utterances could have an effect in extra-human institutions, particularly within the ordered divine/angelic hierarchy. To put it another way, the social world of the adjurer did not consist wholly of (possible) mystical circles, the larger Jewish community, and then the larger non-Jewish commu-nity; it included as well close links with the angelic/divine and demonic realms.40 The world was inhabited by more than just humans; it was filled as well by a multitude of angels and demons. This view of the world made plausible both ascents to the Merkabah and adjurations of angels to descend from heaven. In the Hekhalot texts the divine/angelic hierarchy contains sev-eral elements: (1) God, the creator of heaven, earth, angels, and humans; (2) the divine Names, by which God created everything, including the angels and the divine Throne;41 (3) the highest an-gels, including the Prince of the Presence, and their Names; (4) angels on a lower level, like the \"princes of fear,\" who are ap-pointed to attack those who are not worthy of \"making theurgic use\" of the angels (§624); and (5) the pure human being, who can make use of the Names of creation to force the Prince of the Presence to do his will (§§636-637). Acts which people can per-form verbally if they possess sufficient power in a particular hu-man institution (e.g., a king ordering a subject to come into his presence) provide an analogy for the types of acts which people with sufficient power can order angels to do. Extra-human society is built on a model similar to (but not necessarily identical with) human society; laws and modes of operation which work in human society also work in that society. Thus humans can interact with the denizens of the extra-human world as they might act with other humans. An example from related texts shows this analogy even more clearly. In the incantation bowls from Babylonia, which have some formulae in common with the Hekhalot texts, the relationships between people served as an exact analogy for the relationships between humans and demons, and words which had power in human interaction also worked with regard to the de-mons. In one formula used by the authors of the bowl-texts, the SUNY Press, 1992). 40 See, for example, b. Ber. 6b, on how to see the demons. 41 §634, 637, 59.

An important part of the procedure of the adjuration is the \"uttering of certain words.\" When human beings know \"certain words,\" then they can effect the descent of the Prince of the Presence from heaven. The words which the adjurer uses are both words used in ordinary speech, verbs such as \"I decree,\" \"I ordain,\" and special words: the Names of the Prince of the Presence and the Names of God. Uttering these words is part of the \"accepted con-ventional procedure\" of bringing down the Prince of the Presence, and knowledge of these special words is part of what singles out the adjurer as one fit to bring him down. The adjuration of the Prince of the Presence spells out the accepted procedure (with divine authorization) for calling the angel down and learning wisdom from him. This important matter is not left to the individual imagina-tion of the person who wishes to speak to the angel. The framers of the adjuration carefully worked out a procedure to draw him down. They accepted it as legitimate, and they tried to indicate (and advocate for) its acceptance, by putting the words of the instructions in the mouths of Rabbi Aqiba and Rabbi Eliezer the Great. (A.2.) Austin says that \"the particular persons and circum-stances in a given case must be appropriate for the invocation of the particular procedure invoked.\" The person who says this adju-ration must be in a specific relation to the powers which constitute his world in order for his words to be effective in the ritual. As I said, the Hekhalot texts assume a system of power leading from God as the most powerful, to the Prince of the Presence and the other angels, and finally to human beings. Certain people, by virtue of their ascetic practices, are able to gain power in the system, say the words of the adjuration effectively, and bring down the Prince of the Presence. Knowledge of the divine or angelic Names is also crucial to placing the adept in a position of power. (Other parts of the Hekhalot literature spell out other moral or purity require-ments to descend to the Merkabah.) According to the directions 42 See for example, James Montgomery, Aramaic Incantation Texts from Nip-pur (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, The Museum, 1913), bowl texts 8 and 17."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"spelled out in section §623, the adept must purify himself from any seminal emission for seven days (so we know that the adept must be male), immerse himself in a river, not converse with others (particularly women, according to MS New York), and on the eighth day, fast, immerse himself, and speak the words of the adjuration. He should be sitting in a river in water up to his neck as he is speaking the adjuration. By following these directions, the adept isolates himself from other people and ordinary human life. He comes to approach the angelic state of purity, which in other parts of the Hekhalot literature is contrasted with the human state of impurity (§181-182). In this condition he is fit to say the words of adjuration. §624 spells out the dangers for the person who has not reached the appropriate state of purity; if he dares to say the adjuration, \"the princes of fear\" will attack him. (B.l. & 2.) Rabbi Eliezer's words, \"one time I caused him to de-scend and he sought to destroy the entire world,\" imply that it is possible to execute the procedure incorrectly. The Prince of the Presence is not only a powerful angel who can reveal secrets to human beings; he is also dangerous, as is made clear at several points in the adjuration. The adjurer must be very careful to say the correct words in order to control the angel. At a number of points in the adjuration, the adjurer orders the angel not to injure him. The danger is not merely that one could fail to bring the angel down; in fact, the adjuration does not mention this possibil-ity. Failure to follow the correct procedure could result in the destruction of the world, or in injury to the adjurer. Because this is the real danger in the incorrect or incomplete execution of the procedure, the adjurer must continually order the angel not to hurt him and not to distort his speech. (C.l. & 2.) The text of the adjuration provides no information on the state of mind or intention of the participants. However, one might be able to learn from the requirements for fasting and purification that the human participant needs to have a serious and solemn attitude towards the utterance of the adjuration and the goal of bringing the angel down to earth.43 My analysis of the first part of the adjuration has made clear the circumstances in which the adjuration must be uttered and the 43 For a similar formulation, see Sam D. Gill, \"Prayer as Person: The Performa-tive Force in Navajo Prayer Acts,\" History of Religions 17 (1977): 155: \"The participants ... must have proper and serious intentions. They must demonstrate these intentions by observing specific dietary and social restrictions before, during, and after the performance of the ceremonial.\""},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"qualifications that the adjurer must possess. In the analysis that follows I will discuss the two elements of illocutionary force in the adjuration: verbs that fit the category of \"performative utter-ances,\" and the Names of God and the angel which provide further power for the illocutionary force of the verbs. The second part of the adjuration (§§624-639) offers many ex-amples of verbs or verbal phrases that fit the category of \"performative utterances\" very closely, particularly those phrased in the first person, singular, participle form. Examples are: \"I adjure,\" usually in conjunction with the words, \"by the Name ...\"; \"I decree,\" \"I call to you by X Name,\" \"I establish.\" These words are not descriptive of other actions, they are actions in their own right. The emphasis is on what the adjurer is doing, not on the consequences of his act; these are illocutionary acts, not perlocu-tionary acts. The words do not need any concomitant physical action to take effect; they need only to be spoken, usually in conjunction with a series of divine or angelic Names. They belong in the category of \"exercitives,\" because they consist of the exer-cising of power. The adjuration interweaves \"calling\" on the angel by his many Names, and adjuring him by the many Names of God to follow the orders of the adjurer. In the first paragraph of the adjuration there is an example of a commissive, when it says, \"at the time that I bind myself to make theurgic use of him.\" This use of the verb indicates that he is committing himself to do some-thing, in this case to make theurgic use of the angel, while the use of the same word to apply to the angel, \"I bind him sevenfold (or, by an oath),\" is an example of an exercitive, because it is an exer-eise of his power over the angel. The adjuration also contains two other classes of verbs which are performative utterances, but it is a little trickier to figure exactly how they act. The second class consists of positive im-peratives issued by the adjurer to the angel or angels: (§627): perform my request! fulfill my plea! (§636): descend quickly! do the will of your adjurer! act for his Name! (§639): ascend in peace! These are direct orders, calling on the angel to do specific acts. With these verbs the focus of the action shifts from the adjurer to the angel, from the act of adjuration to the acts which the angel should perform. The third class of verbs is that of negative impera-tives directed to the angel or angels, in which the adjurer tells them, in a variety of ways, not to hurt him. (§624): do not injure me, do not trouble me, do not frighten me! (§638): do not pervert my lips, do not change my decree! These verbs describe all of the"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"actions which the angel could perform against the will of the adjurer. An example from §627 may provide a way to understand how these verbs operate as performative utterances: \"I adjure you, and I order you further to be bound to my will; you shall accept the oath of my decree; perform my request, fulfill my desire, and do not confUse me ...\" The verb \"to be bound to my will\" depends upon the verb \"I order.\" Although the other verbs do not formally depend upon this verb, it seems to me that they imply such a connection between the will of the adjurer and the angel. These two classes of verbs refer to possible actions of the angel, but they are not actions voluntarily initiated by him; they are ordered by the adjurer. They could be put into the form: \"(I order you) to ascend, not to hurt me,\" etc., so that just as in the first case, the action flows from the adjurer to the angel, and never in the other direction. It might be possible to classify these as perlocutionary acts, since the focus is on what the angel will do as a consequence of the adjurer's order, not on the order itself. Otherwise, one might see the angel's action as part of the illocutionary act in the sense of section C.l. & 2 of Austin's six conditions of felicity: the consequential conduct called for and engaged in is the following of the adjurer's order. It depends on how closely one sees the angel's action as being bound to the adjurer's order; it seems to me that the adjuration tries to tie these two actions very closely together. There is also another class of verbs which do not directly order or prohibit action of the angel. These verbs either describe the angel, God, other human beings, or most frequently, the Names by which the adjurer swears. Although the various verbs of the adjura-tion do not seem to need them, in many cases they provide the force for the adjurational verbs. They point out how powerful the divine Names are that the adjurer uses and show how the adjurer can use them to command the angel. Following Austin's scheme, they would seem to fit more closely into the category of \"locutions\" rather than \"illocutions,\" since they are descriptions and not performatives. However, they are locutions in the service of illocutions, and are not present for their own sake. * * • An important part of the illocutionary force of the verbs in the adjuration are the angelic and divine Names by which the angel is summoned and by which he is adjured. The \"locutionary\" phrases that I quoted above strengthen the illocutionary force of the"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Names. For example, the incantation in section §625 reads, \"Afterwards, he should begin and adjure, because he has strength-ened himself, and sealed himself by the Name of 42 letters, which is called QHTY WH HH SNTQQ RWTT HWR HYH PPNN HYH WH WH >G QS YHYH, mighty over all the letters, for those who hear, all the host of heaven, they are agitated and afraid and trem-ble.\" Section §624 gives the text of the adjuration of the \"princes of fear\" by the 42-letter Name, while this section emphasizes the power of this Name. The 42-letter Name frightens and intimidates \"all the host of heaven\"; it is thus appropriate that the adjurer should use such a Name as a protective seal. This Name is one of the Names of God and as such has inherent power. The locutionary verbs do not themselves act against the angels, but they make clear the power of the Name against the angels. There are other examples of the importance of locutionary phrases. In paragraph §628 the adjurer calls to the angel by his own Names: \"Again I call to you by your fourteen Names, by which you are revealed to prophets and seers, to sweeten words of prophecy in their mouths and to make pleasant words of pleasantness.\" \"Prophets and seers\" can make use of these Names in order to reveal the angel and to \"sweeten words of prophecy.\" This section specifies that these Names are powerful for bringing a revelation of the angel. In the same way, they will bring a revelation of the angel to the person who is currently uttering the words of the adjuration. The fourteen divine Names of sections §§629-634 are powerful in another way because they are \"the fourteen Names by which all the hidden secrets, and letters, and seals are made, and in them are the foundations of heaven and earth\" (§629). These may be the Names which maintain heaven and earth, or the Names by which heaven and earth were created. In any case, these Names are inti-mately bound up with the structure of the entire universe. These fourteen Names are engraved on various parts of the structure of heaven: four Names \"on the heads of the hayyot,\" four on the four sides of the divine Throne, four on the crowns of the \"כāfānnim of power,\" and two on the crown of God. The Names receive divine titles, such as \"Lord of powers,\" or \"Master of wonders.\" While the previous list of fourteen Names referred to Names of the angel, these particular Names are clearly the powerful Names of God. It is unclear in the context of the adjuration whether the titles refer to God himself or to his Names, although this distinc-tion may be lost on the authors of the adjuration. In another Hekhalot text, Ma caseh Merkabah, the text reads,"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Be sanctified, God of heaven and earth, Lord of lords, mighty of mighty ones, God of the kerūbim, who rides on the kerûbim, God of hosts whose dominion is over the hosts, God of the servants (=angels), whose Name is sanctified over the servants. He is his Name, and his Name is he, he is in him and his Name is in his Name, song is his Name and his Name is song. (§588, MS Oxford)44 A similar passage is found at §557: \"his Name is in his strength, and his strength is in his Name, he is his power, and his power is he, and his Name is like his Name\" (MS New York). Section §588 uses some of the same titles of God as the adjuration of the Prince of the Presence, and identifies God with his Name: \"He is his Name and his Name is he.\" From the point of view of the adjurer, God and his Name are so close that by calling on God's Name, one is calling on God's own power. These same fourteen Names are those by which the angel is ad-jured in section §634 to come down to the adjurer. They are the Names \"by which were established the throne of glory and the seat of the highest, a precious instrument by which were made wondrous things of old, before you were formed and before all the host of heaven was refined, before he made earth and fields, and dwellers of earth and creatures of praise.\" These very Names are those by which God's Throne was made before the creation of both humans and angels, and which thus have power over the angels. In this description of the Names the angel is reminded that he too is created by God, and that there is something higher than him that humans can make use of: the Names of God. Section §636 provides a further example of the reification of the Names and of their power vis-à-vis the angels: \"I adjure you by five Names, corre-sponding to the five of your Names whose letters are written in fire and hover above the throne of glory. One rises and one de-scends so that the Princes of the Presence will not gaze at them.\" A similar picture of the \"Explicit Names\" appears in 3 Enoch: \"When the ministering angels utter the ,Holy,' all of the Explicit Names (semot hammeförasot), which are engraved with a flaming pen on the Throne of Glory, fly like eagles with sixteen wings, and surround and go around the Holy One on the four sides of the place of glory of his Shekhinah.\" The other orders of angels fall on their 44 My translation is based on Michael Swartz, Mystical Prayer in Judaism, 244. Schäfer, however, understands this passage differently: \"In an almost philosophical manner, the personal pronoun hu> (\"he [is]\") is composed as the name of God: 'He [is]' is his name, and his name is 'he [is]'; 'he [is]' in 'he [is],' and his name in his name\" (The Hidden and Manifest God, 80)."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"faces three times and say, \"Blessed is the Name of his glorious kingdom for ever and ever\" (§57). By these Names everything was created, including all the angels, and the Throne of Glory itself; they sustain and maintain the world (§59). 3 Enoch also points to various heavenly phenomena which exist or are sustained by virtue of specific divine Names. For example, Metatron showed R. Ish-mael \"water suspended in the height of caräbot rāqiaC by the Name Yah Ehyeh Äser Ehyeh (Ί am who I am' [Ex 3:14])\" (§60). The five Names have power even over the Princes of the Pres-ence, of which the object of this adjuration, >Ozhay5a, is one. God ordered the angels to descend to earth when the adjurer uttered these five Names (see discussion above about the \"conventional procedure\" of the adjuration). The locutionary phrases that are associated with the Names and make clear their illocutionary force in association with the verbs of adjuration are comprehensible, yet the Names themselves are literally incomprehensible, at least to a modem reader. See, for example, the Names cited in paragraphs §§637-38, which are given in two forms, a series of consonants of the Hebrew alphabet and permutations of the letters of the divine Name (\"the language of purity\"): And thus is its explanation, their blinding light,45 their power and their adornment: >ŠŠ MÇQTT MG MS$YY MPQYY PYPG HWGYY HSS PSSYH H5M$TNYH QSN HWHP and its explanation in the language of purity, with yûd hë, how it is said: YHWH YW YHWH WW YHWH HW HW YHWH YH HYH YHWH HY WHYY HYW HYH YH YH HHW <YH> YYH HWH YH YHWH YW HY.46 How can these Names be understood? I suggest that they were meant to be understood by someone, even if not by the human writers or readers or users of these texts. In contrast to the \"demon language\" of exorcism, which the demons understand when humans speak to expel them,47 I suggest that these are the words 45 Following Schäfer's translation, \"blendendes Leuchten\" (Schäfer, \"Die Beschwörung des sar ha-panim,\" 134). 46 §637 (MS New York). 47 \"hie phrase was used by Stanley Tambiah in his discussion of a Sinhalese healing ritual to refer to the type of language by which the exorcist addresses the demons: \"When demons are directly addressed and commanded, the words are a polyglot mixture and therefore unintelligible, being compounded of Sinhalese, Tamil, Pali, Sanskrit, Malayalam, Telegu, Bengali, and even Persian. This exotic and powerful mixture is the 'demon language.' ... The 'demon language' is consciously constructed to connote power, and though largely unintelligible is"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"of the \"divine\" or \"angelic language.\" Terms like these are found in 1 Corinthians 13 and T. Job 49-50, referring to the \"tongues of angels\" and the specific dialects of the various kinds of angels. One might even say that there are two \"implied readers\" for this adjura-tion: human and angelic. The intended reader or user of the adjura-tion is the human adept who engages in ascetic preparations and then utters the adjuration, but his intended audience is the angel. The angel possesses knowledge beyond that known to the human adjurer (in this case knowledge of the \"language of purity,\" as the adjuration puts it) and thus the human being may in fact utter words in the adjuration that he does not understand. In the context of the adjuration it is not important that he comprehend them. What is important is that the angel understands and obeys the words. The adjuration of the Prince of the Presence works by the com-bination of three main elements, two of which act independently. The Names of God and the angel and verbs with illocutionary force each independently possess the power to compel the angel to act in the way that the adjurer desires. The third factor, locutionary phrases referring to the power of the Names, joins the Names and the illocutionary verbs together to give the adjurer still more power to compel the angel. The different sections of this adjura-tion weave these three elements together, sometimes emphasizing one element more strongly and sometimes another (e.g., section §627 almost exclusively uses verbs of the class of exercitives, in contrast to section §628, which is taken up almost entirely by the fourteen Names of the Prince of the Presence). At other points all three elements are present. For example, section §636 begins with an exercitive, \"I adjure you by five Names,\" brings in a locutionary phrase in support of the verb (\"corresponding to the five of your Names, whose letters are written in fire and hover above the Throne of Glory. One rises and one descends so that the Princes of the Presence will not gaze at them\"), and then sets out the five Names by which the angel is adjured. Following this are several locutionary phrases linked together in praise of the Names. One of them claims that the angels were ordered by God to obey anyone who utters the Names: nevertheless based on the theory of language that the demons can understand\" (\"The Magical Power of Words,\" in Culture, Thought, and Social Action: An Anthropological Perspective [Cambridge: Harvard, 1985], 20-21)."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"You have been commanded and warned from the mouth of the Highest: \"If you hear an adjuration by these names, do honor to your name, and hasten and descend and do the will of the one who adjures you. If you hesitate I will push you into the Rigyôn48 of pursuing fire, and make an-other stand instead of you and instead of your authority.\" At this point the adjurer commands the angel by the use of several verbs which act as exercitives that are again backed up by the power of God's Name. This section mentions God's Names twice and spells out the Name once: Do honor to his name, and hurry and descend to me NN son of NN (f.), not in anger and not in terror and not in flashes of fire and hailstones and walls of anger and storehouses of snow, not in stormwinds and not in powerful whirlwinds which come from you. And perform my demand and uphold my request and fulfill my will for all is in your hand, by the authority of ,NDDW RDSW HYH my God and your God, the Lord of all and your Lord. By his names I have adjured you, that you be bound to me, and hurry and descend and do my will and do not hesitate. The adjurer commands the angel both positively (\"do honor to his name, and hurry and descend\") and negatively (\"not in anger and not in terror\"). The locutionary phrase that comes after the divine Name emphasizes that the Name refers to the God of both angels and humans, thus telling the angel again that he must obey the one who utters this Name. This section ends with a series of exercitive verbs in which the action flows from the adjurer to the angel, which can be viewed either as verbs of illocutionary force (\"I have adjured you that you be bound to me\") followed by perlocutionary verbs (\"hurry and descend and do my will and do not hesitate\") or as one illocutionary act of commanding, in which the necessary consequence of the adjurer's words is the obedience of the angel. * * * In this essay I have begun to apply the theories of performative language, pioneered by J. L. Austin and further used by anthropolo-gists in the analysis of present-day rituals, to an ancient Jewish ritual text, the adjuration of the Prince of the Presence. Austin's theory has illuminated both the particular circumstances in which the adjuration must take place, and the power of the words that are 48 See §154 and Pesiq. R. 97a/b. Pesiq. R. 97a/b reads: \"Rigyon, river of fire [whose coals] burn up angels and humans\" (Schäfer, \"Beschwörung des sar ha-panim,** 133, η. 91)."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"spoken. I hope that this analysis has shed light on how such a series of performative utterances might have worked within the framework of the worldview found in the Hekhalot literature, in particular how the illocutionary verbs work in concert with the powerful divine Names.

Brashear The ongoing cataloguing of Greek texts in the Ägyptisches Mu-seum und Papyrussammlung der Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin— Preussischer Kulturbesitz has resulted in the following recent accre-tions. The texts are all written on papyrus in the centuries CE. The provenances unless otherwise indicated are unknown.

Recently, Herwig Maehler, going on the basis of κουίλομι (Coptic \"little man\"), suggested the entries in the first column might be names. In fact, most of the entries can be identified as names, and parallels are easily located in Friedrich Preisigke, Namenbuch (Heidelberg: Preisigke, 1922): 1 Κατοτ: Cf. Preisigke, 168: Κατυτις = K^a0)a 3 <Β>ίκτωρ διάκ(ων): Cf. Preisigke, 76: Βίκτωρ. 5 Πλώς: Cf. Preisigke, 332. Άμάϊς: Cf. Preisigke, 22. 6 ισαπολου: Cf. Preisigke, 96: Είσαπόλλων = Ίσαπόλλων. 7 κουϊλομι: Cf. Preisigke, 183: Κοΰι, as well as G. Heuser, \"Die koptischen Personennamen ägyptischen Ur-sprungs\" (diss., Heidelberg, ca. 1928), 21: KOîtj. Is this list just a banal account with names and tallies of goods or money sums? What then does the zeta stand for, and what are the series of numbers after it? Accounts never display an entire series of numbers succeeding the names but only a single number indicat-ing either goods or money owed or paid. Hence, I am inclined to catalogue this text among the magica and not among run-of-the-mill, pedestrian accounts and tallies. Are the numbers in the righthand column maybe onomatoman-tic calculations?3 So far any attempts to force this text into any system described by the ancients have met with ultimate defeat. Nothing in all of ancient prognostic or divinatory literature seems even remotely to begin to compare to this particularly enigmatic text. De his rebus videant peritiores. 2. Apotelesmatikon P. Berol. 21198, 12.5 χ 8 cm., second to third century The fragment is broken off on all sides except the upper one where there is a margin of 2.5 cm. The present text is written on the horizontal fibers in an elegant, rapid, documentary cursive of the 2nd-3rd centuries, characterized by florid ascenders and de-scenders. In line 8 there is a semi-high dot. Criteria for determining the original line lengths are non-existent. The astrological text on the vertical fibers of the same fragment (probably originally com-"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"prising many columns) was published by G. Ioannidou, ZPE 72 (1988): 26If. Ioannidou was able to reconstruct the missing por-tions of the text on the other side, where only 3-5 letters are lacking from the right of that particular column of writing. In all likelihood the present text on the horizontal fibers was the first to be written on the roll which undoubtedly contained many columns of writing in its entirety. The roll was probably later turned over for writing the second (astrological) text on the vertical fibers. The text under consideration is, on the one hand, reminiscent of an Amtstagebuch describing the various activities of a govern-ment official.4 Especially the phrase δίκην λέγει ενεκα δημοσίφ[ν in lines 7 and 9 (?) as well as the verb εσπροσωπήσεται lend ere-dence to this interpretation. However, the language is couched in verbs not of the past, recording what has already taken place, but verbs of the future tense, describing what will happen. (The two clauses already quoted from lines 7 and 9 which contain present-tense verbs are the only exceptions.) Hence, it might rather be an official's agenda, prescribing his future activities. On the other hand, the phrase της ιδίας γυνα[ικός (1. 3) smacks more of private than of public affairs. There are, however, several indications that the text more likely belongs to the corpus of αποτελεσματικά, describing the effects which planetary conjunctions and astral positions have on human destinies and mortal affairs. Two such texts are P. Merton 56 (= Pack 2042) and P. Oxy. 465 (= Pack 2056)5 which share the following striking features with the work under discussion: 1) Both P. Merton 56 and P. Oxy. 465 are couched in verbs of the present and future tenses—a point which bothered the editor of P. Merton 56. P. Berol. 21198 likewise contains present and future tense verbs. 2) Even more remarkable is the fact that the curious idiom τόπον εκ τόπου occurs in all three papyri—coincidence or characteristic of such texts? The unusual compound of προσωπέω here in line 8 (έσπροσωπησετοα) may be compared with such other unusual προσωπέω-compound words as ίδιοπροσωπέω and άλλοιοπροσωπεω which appear in astrological texts (cf. LS J, pp. 69 and 818; Gundel, Dekane, 32ff.). Μετεωρίζω (1· 5) is likewise attested in the astro-logical works of Vettius Valens. Tenuous criteria though they may"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"be, they nonetheless indicate that the Berlin text is probably apotelesmatic instead of documentary.6 The total period involved in the text on this papyrus covers ca. 3 months.

Whereas the corre-sponding Greek ciphers of these numbers—'θ^9θ, 'Γχξγ and χξς—do not produce visually convincing palindromes, these numbers were not simply there for the eyes. These numerical configurations were not pronounced as letters (e.g., gamma-chi-xi-gamma) but read aloud as numerals. Hence, pronounced—εννέα χίλια ένακόσια ένήκοντα έννέα, τρισχίλια εξακόσια έξήκοντα τρία, εξακόσια έξήκοντα εξ— they must have had a pleasantly alliterative, sing-song character similar to the English \"nine thousand nine hun-dred and ninety-nine\" or German \"neuntausendneun-hundertneunundneunzig.\" 7 Palindromicity, however, is a phenomenon appreciable only in script, and palindromes exist for the sake of their congruent reversibility. Τχξγ thus is not a palindrome; it is not reversible. (RG) However, from an arithmological point of view, the present number allows interesting speculation. By reducing higher numbers (= later letters in the alphabet) to \"monads,\" a procedure Hippolytus, Ref. omn. haer. IV. 14 (see n. 3) describes as a common technique of charlatans and impostors, it is possible to interpret Γχξγ as γςςγ (3663) which is an authentic palindrome. (RG) In the final analysis, no palinode on my part is neces-sary, as Richard Gordon demonstrates, for the following reasons: the present erroneous order of at least the middle two digits may be due to simple scribal negligence and er-ror. (Proving that the first and fourth have been trans-"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"posed is more difficult, if not impossible. There is no ap-parent difference between the gamma as it is used for the thousands and as it is used for the unit cipher.) The source of error may also have been the \"resurgence of the alpha-betic value,\" alphabetic value taking priority over numeri-cal value, since xi precedes chi in the alphabet. Finally, the symbols might be employed here as characteres, the trans-position of the middle two symbols being intentional only in the sense that the origin of the characteres in the nu-merical scheme was to be disguised. 3 Ίαβ]ωχ: Cf. PGM IV 2204. Another possibility is Βοανχωω]ωχ. Cf. PGM LXXIX 3: ανοκ πε Βαινχωωωχ Άβρασάξ εριντ Μιχαήλ and LXXX 2, two parallel thymo-katocha, wherein Bainchoooch, Abrasax and Michael are all invoked in one breath. Given the isopsephistic value of the name Bainchoooch (=3663), albeit in garbled form, in the previous line, this restoration is attractive. Μιχαήλ: Cf. W. Lueken, Michael.

Pittakos and the Millstone: ad SM II 56 Pittakos, the 7th-century BCE Lesbian politician, was fond of taking his exercise by grinding grain with a millstone. This curious habit, which is recorded for posterity by Diogenes Laertius I 81 and Aelian, var. hist. VII 4, undoubtedly inspired the folksong reported almost a thousand years later in the work attributed to Plutarch, Septem sapientum convivium 14: όλα μύλα άλει* κοά γαρ Πιτ-τακός άλει μεγάλος Μυτιλήνας βασιλεύων (PMG 869 [43 Β., 30 D.]). In 1976, Eric Turner published a Greek magical text on a papy-rus sheet from Oxyrhynchos dating to the third or fourth century CE. Despite the papyrus' relatively small size (8x8 cm.) and short text (a mere 29 words distributed over a paltry eight lines), in the ensuing 19 years it has generated conjecture and discussion all out of proportion to its size—much more than that ordinarily accorded such a minute and mundane magical text. For although Turner and others after him regarded the incantation as amatory, according to its latest editor, Robert Daniel in SM II 56, the charm is coercive. It is presumably directed against a female slave, either already fugitive and on the lam or else suspected of entertaining plans of escape. The text on the papyrus begins: ώσπερ στρέφεται ό έρμης τοΰ μυλαίου κοά άλήθετοα τούτο τό πιττάκιον ... (\"as the Hermes-stone [?] of the mill turns and as this chit is ground ...\"). In other words, the magician sets up a simile: as the mill turns, and as the slip of papyrus is pulverized beneath the millstone, so too should a certain woman change her mind and desist from thoughts of es-cape. Daniel, citing parallel \"Mühlenzauber\" from both antiquity and more modern European folkloric traditions, brings conducive"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"evidence for the use of the mill with coercive magical intent in similar contexts. ״Αλει μύλα όλα- κοά γαρ Πνττακός άλει in the ancient Greek folksong and άλήθετοα τούτο τό πιττάκιον in the incantation from Roman Egypt—happenstance or deliberate design? The similar-ity—Πιττακός αλει and άλήθετοα ... τό πιττάκιον—any way one looks at it—is striking. The gamut of possible explanations for this Pittakion8 reminis-cence on the pittakion ranges from a purely coincidental similarity on the one hand to deliberate punning on the other. One thing, however, seems certain: it is highly unlikely that a folksong popu-lar on 7th-century Lesbos was still en vogue and being sung to the cadence of the grinding millstone a millennium later in the backwa-ter town of Roman Oxyrhynchos. If the similarity is not entirely happenstance, then either a subconscious recollection of the Les-bian milling song as related by Plutarch (?) or else a deliberate and conscientiously premeditated allusion to it is at play here—unless Pittakos' legendary calisthenic and political millings were so well known as to have become paroemiac. To posit a possible scenario or two: It is conceivable that the person responsible for composing this charm could have picked up the Pittakion milling song while reading his/her copy of the Sep-tem sapientum convivium. This work, as we now know since the publication of P. Oxy. 3685, was indeed copied and read in 3rd-century Oxyrhynchos—the very place and time the magical charm was also committed to papyrus. The song, lingering in the circui-tous recesses of the Oxyrhynchite magician's cerebrum, thus exerted its subliminal, subconscious influence as the unwitting, unsuspecting sorcerer considered the set-up—\"Mühlenzauber\" and pittakion—and penned the text on the papyrus chit. Otherwise the set-up triggered the Plutarchan (?) association, the ancient Greek song leapt into recall, prompting a deliberate jeu d' esprit, and the Oxyrhynchite recondite was able to give full rein to his/her ingenuity. Making a punning play on the name Pittakos, he/she cleverly converted/bent the elements of a time and a situa-tion long past into an arcane allusion suited for his/her own imme-diate and nefarious purposes—appropriate grist for this provincial magician's preternatural, coercive mill—even if the final product was intended for his/her eyes only.9 Provided that the highly speculative, house-of-cards theory proposed here should hold true, then this vestigial carmen popu-larium from 7th-century BCE Lesbos, recorded by Plutarch (?) in the 2nd century CE, and punningly revamped for use in a magical"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"charm of the 3rd-4th centuries, would be the latest example of this humble literary genre to come to light.10 Supposing that the Mytilenian reminiscence in Roman Egypt was in fact premeditated makes one wonder what the underlying impulses could be for such a recherché display of erudition in this profane, quotidian and transitory context. In all probability it was nothing more than a case of whimsical, self-indulgent l'art pour l'art. To paraphrase that classic of papyrological sleuthing, H.C. Youtie's \"Callimachus in the Tax Rolls\":11 The trivial display for no eyes but his own, the light and barely sarcastic touch—they are all there.

According to the account, the Ephesian exorcists—named in the following verse as the seven sons of Sceva—fizzle miserably in their endeavor: the demon fails to recognize these otherwise experienced clerics and crashes upon them with so sound a joggling that they are forced to flee naked and injured.1 Nothing in the report of the sons of Sceva tells of the exorcistic use of amulets, engraved or otherwise, nor of attendant rituals in the exorcistic act; apparently the adjuration of Jesus' name was thought sufficient.2 This stands in marked contrast, on the other 1 For literature and discussion of this passage, see G. H. TweLftree, Jesus the Exorcist, WUzNT 2. Reihe 54 (Tübingen: Mohr [Siebeck], 1993), 30-34, whose views on this passage and interpretation of όρκίζω, are not, however, to be recommended. The MSS traditions of the magical papyri are roughly contemporary with those of the NT; however, much of the magical material antedates the NT considerably (note 5 below). 2 There are some clues, however, that the episode may have entailed more than our writer is letting on to. For one, only in the end do we read that the whole exorcism took place in a house (19:16). The itinerancy of the exorcists suggests that this house would have been that of the afflicted. But failing this otherwise casual reference, readers would have been led to believe that the attempted exorcism took place out-of-doors, as was the apparent case with the handkerchief episode (19:11-12). Furthermore, the fact that the exorcists performed their ceremonies as a group of seven, perhaps to enhance their abilities magically, suggests somewhat elaborate rituals. There may have been a ritual word-play on \"seven\": as discussed below, the Semitic equivalent for \"adjure,\" or \"exorcise\" (εξορκίζω), is,שבע sbc, \"to adjure\"; but the word also means \"seven.\" Or was there a possible misunderstanding of an Aramaic source that described \"adjuring\" sons (שבע = έξορκίζειν) rather than \"seven\" sons (7 = שבע)? There are also some conflicts in the manuscript tradition: did one, two groups (άμψότεροι), or a college of seven perform the adjuration? On some of the problems of this"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"hand, to the brief story aforementioned in vv. 11-12, a story advertising small face-cloths and bandaging strips (σουδάρια ή σιμικίνθια) that, when touched to Paul's skin, could heal the sick and exorcise demons (άπαλλάσσεσθαι απ' αυτών τάς νόσους, τά τε πνεύματα τά πονηρά έκπορεύεσθαι).3 Such cloths were indeed amulets (φυλακτήρια), and though not engraved with magic words, there is little to detract from the prospect that the cloths, once used effectively, would have been deployed again and again.4 These magically-charged reliquaries would have no doubt been reapplied with the necessary prayers or incantations: the young Christian community at Ephesus, it seems, adhered tenaciously to their magical beliefs, in some cases for up to two years after conversion (Acts 19:10). Only with the failure of the Jewish exorcists do the \"many of those who had believed\" burn their magic books (Acts 19:18-19); some will never burn theirs.5 passage, see recently, W. A. Strange, \"The Sons of Sceva and the Texts of Acts 19:14,\" JTS 38 (1987): 97-106 (with literature). 3 άπαλλάσσειν is, by the way, one of the most common verbs for healing in the magical literature; see Suppl. Mag.—note 5 below—I. 7, 13; 9, 8; 12, 5; 18, 5; 29, 8; Π. 74, 17; 84, [1?]. The verb is found only here in all of the NT for healing disease (elsewhere, cf. Luke 12:58; Heb 2:15 for entirely different usages). 4 On the mechanism of applying uninscribed materials accompanied by verbal incantations, see Roy Kotansky, \"Incantations and Prayers for Salvation on Inscribed Greek Amulets,\" in C. A. Faraone and D. Obbink, eds., Magika Hiera. Greek Magic and Religion (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), 107-37, esp. 108-10; on σουδάρια used in magic ritual, cf.

Tbe word σινδών is used of the linen burial-cloth of Jesus (Mt 27:59; Mk 15:46 [cf 14:51,52!]; Lk 23:53), but only the Gospel of John lays emphasis on a separate facial burial-kerchief: κοά τό σουδάριον, δ ήν Μ της κεφαλής αϋτοΰ, ού μετά τών όθονίων κείμενον άλλά χωρ\\ς έντετυλιγμένον άς 'ένα τόπον (John 20:7; cf. 11:44). On othonia in magic, note PGM IV. 1073, 3003; VII. 338; ΧΠ. 122; ΧΙΠ.1011. It is difficult not to imagine that this non-synoptic reference to an otherwise commonplace face-cloth betrays a special interest in a powerful amuletic reliquary within Johannine circles. Do Acts 19:12 and John 20:7 echo a common historical tradition of the use or veneration of powerful σουδάρια of Jesus and the apostles for exorcistic rituals? 5 See R.

Indeed, the wording preserved in the Lukan account says much about what sort of formulae were used in the perform-ance of exorcism, and surprisingly these very formulae are the ones encountered on amulets preserved in the papyri and on magic lamellae, our best contemporary records of such practices. It should come as no surprise, then, to find that the exorcistic formula of the sons of Sceva comes close to actual examples found in extant magic books and amulets. This attests to the accuracy of the formulation preserved in Acts 19:13 and implies an historical recollection of real incantations that the Jews must have used.6 Either the writer of Acts has recorded often-heard and well-known exorcistic sayings of the lst-to-2nd century CE, or he has actually copied the formulae directly from the sorts of books named and burned in Acts 19:19. In this study, we shall turn to an assessment of the actual exor-cisms in Greek as preserved on inscribed magical amulets, paying close attention to the sorts of formulae they employ and from where they may have derived. Before this, however, it will be necessary to furnish the following material: (1) a general overview of exorcism in its cultural-historical milieu; (2) a look at the deri-vation of the term \"to exorcise\"; and (3) some representative examples of exorcism from Jewish and Greek literature.

Throughout our discussion, the language of these amulets will provide much to support the long-standing position that Greek exorcism represents a phenomenon largely indebted to traditional Jewish practice, a practice that, among other things, must have gained much impetus from healing rites performed by groups attached to synagogues of a more mystical orientation. Though a full study of the relationship between magic and the synagogue, in general, and liturgical prayer and incantation, in particular, is not attempted here, we shall discover some compara-tive material with which to pursue a subsequent inquiry into the matter. * * * Scholars have long recognized that the concept of an unfamiliar spirit possessing a human being by somehow infiltrating the body and securing control over the faculties is Semitic; it is largely foreign to Greek thought in classical and Hellenistic times.7 7 See Wesley D. Smith, \"So-called Possession in Pre-Christian Greece,\" TAPA 96 (1965): 403-26, esp. 409: \"there is no description of exorcism in pagan literature before Lucian, who in the Philopseudes describes a Syrian exorcist from Palestine\" (chap. 16)—see further, below; S. Vemon McCasland, \"Religious Healing in First-Century Palestine,\" in J. T. McNeill, M. Spinka, and H. R.

The Greek sources, at least in this early stage, usually depict evil δαίμονες as ghosts (είδωλα, ψυχαί) and apparitions (φάσματα, φαντάσματα) that frazzle careless wayfarers caught in unsafe environments;8 they are not \"indwelling.\" At other times, spirits are represented as avenging Erinyes and Alas-tors ('Ερινύες, άλάστορες, etc.) bent on punishing offenders for various social crimes.9 In the case of the former category, simple protective measures ensure safety against their attacks; in the latter, more complex cathartic rituals are often required.10 In either case, the unwanted entities confront their victims by ap-Of course during the archaic and classical Greek periods the concept of a mali-cious δ(χίμων must have undergone considerable change under the influence of the ancient Near East, so such of the categorization that we attempt here, to some extent, must be artificial. Recently, W. Burkert, The Orientalizing Revolution. Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age, trans. M. E. Pinder and W. Burkert (Cambridge and London: Harvard University Press, 1992) has contributed enormously to our understanding of cultural contacts between the ancient Near East and Greece, particularly in the 8th cent. BCE. 8 That is, generally in the countryside and at dangerous crossroads, grottos, graveyards, fields and streams; see Brink, \"Light of the Moon,\" 2070, 2091. Such \"Greek\" demons—whether confronting specters or avenging spirits—are also judged responsible for outbreaks of pestilence and war in the larger life of the community; in the more private domain, they bring selective afflictions, mishaps, disease, and especially μανία. Though—like their ancient Near Eastern and levantine counterparts—\"Greek\" demons appear in animal-form, the most com-mon portrayal is an apparition of Hekate; see Sarah lies Johnston, Hekate Soteira, ΑΡΑ American Classical Studies 21 (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1990), esp. chap.

On the other hand, by the time of the composition of the New Testament, belief in an indwelling spirit that could be ceremonially exorcised is attested throughout the eastern Empire and seems specifically local to the Syro-Palestinian world. In addition to what can be gleaned of Jewish practices from primary sources (e.g., Pseudo-Philo, Josephus, Christian pseudepigraphic writings, and some Church Fathers), we know that sectarian groups at Qumran also engaged in complex exorcistic rituals.12 Their compositions, however, are preserved largely in Hebrew and Aramaic, even though the contemporary Gospel accounts picture Jesus as an exorcist in a sort of Semitic-Greek garb. So too, the late antique depictions of Greek exorcism—the accounts of Apollonius of Tyana, Lucian of Samosata, and others—seem to pattern their accounts after a prevailing \"Semitic\" model: the notion of a mali-cious demon taking possession of an individual must be viewed as a largely Near Eastern doctrine.13 11 In the Selinuntine Lex Sacra, B7f. (previous notes), for example, the offend-ing ghost, called an elasteros, is described as one that is \"foreign or ancestral; or heard, or seen\"; see M. H. Jameson, D. R. Jordan, and R. D. Kotansky, Lex Sacra, 44 with refs. to Assyrian ghosts. 12 This is plain at least from the non-canonical psalms they wrote, especially the variant recension of Ps 91 (90 LXX), a psalm called the \"Song for the Stricken\"; see J. A. Sanders, The Psalms Scroll of Qumran Cave 11 (1 lQPsa), DJD 4 (Oxford: Clarendon, 1965), 91-93. But a study of the Qumran exorcisms takes us too far afield from this study. The most recent treatment of this exorcistic psalm is that of Emile Puech, \"Les deux derniers Psaumes davidiques du rituel d'exorcisme, 11QPsApa IV 4-V 14,\" in D. Dimant and U. Rappaport, eds., The Dead Sea Scrolls.

To what extent has a Semitic or Jewish concept of ritual exorcism come to influence an older model of a \"Greek\" demonology? Can one discern in the later Greek accounts a dependence upon a particularly Jewish procedure in casting out demons? To answer these questions we have first to examine the actual accounts that document ancient exorcistic procedures. In so doing, we also attempt to determine what marks these texts as primarily \"exorcistic.\" * * * The account in Acts 19 targets Jewish έξορκιστοά as the victims of the back-fired demonological attack. An εξορκιστής—a term not found before the second century CE14—is simply the name given to what the \"exorcists\" do: they \"adjure\" (εξορκίζειν) the demons, or \"place them under oath,\" usually with the aim of driving them out. Certain details provided by the relatively early NT papyrus, P. Mich. 138 (P38, ca. 300 CE) and by Codex D also add to this \"oath\" the fact that the demons are exhorted \"to come out of\" (έξελθέίν) the possessed person(s). This command, com-divine deity in classical Greece is restricted to \"divine possession\" such as that encountered with the Pythian oracle, for which see the ample study of Smith, \"So-called Possession,\" 413-25: Enthousiasmes. The idea of a prophetic spirit indwelling a seer, or of an inner δοαμόνιον guiding a sage, such as Socrates, represent different matters altogether. 14 Apart from Acts (whose date is unsure), the noun occurs first in second cen-tury CE writers: the Anth.

Both forms of the noun then become fairly popular with 4th-century church fathers. The noun is never used of Jesus in the Gospels, nor of Solomon, the Jewish exorcist par excellence, who in Josephus (1st cent. CE), is described as a writer of τρόποι έξορκώσεων (Antiq. VIII.45), not of εξορκισμοί (see note 63 below). Evidently the word (and the cognate έξορκιστής) was not yet coined. The feet that no securely dated writer of the 1st century CE (or earlier) uses the term in contexts where it would have been most expected provides a strong argument for the dating of εξορκιστής after the 1st century. Its occurrence in Acts may well argue for the book's 2nd-century composition, a date for which there are compelling argu-ments; cf. J. C. O'Neill, The Theology of Acts in its Historical Setting (London, 1961), and others. A desideratum would be a thorough study of the vocabulary peculiar to Acts with the use of the Duke databanks. If such a study were to yield otherwise 2nd-century words repeatedly occurring for the \"first\" time in Acts (as, e.g., έξορκιστής), this would certainly call into question the traditional dating of the book."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"bined with the socio-historical nuances that the term \"exorcist\" has come to bear on the narrative, shows that we are dealing with a belief-system that imagines the presence of a harmful unclean spirit thought to indwell body and soul physically. Although the verb όρκίζω is at least as old as Xenophon (Symp. 4.10; 5th cent. BCE)—with the form (έξ)ορκόω attested earlier in inscriptions—it is not used early on in adjuratory formulae spoken to demons, but in the context of oaths sworn between contracting parties.15 The use of όρκίζω especially to adjure demons is a com-paratively recent development and seems to be attested no earlier than the 1st century BCE.16 In the erotic and related curses on papyri and leaden tablets it is the normal term of compelling a nekydaimon to perform a task on behalf of the practitioner. The adjured demon acts as a kind of malign servant or ally. In contexts of a more healing sort, on the other hand, έξορκίζω is used rather differently. The demons (or the diseases they cause) are actually adjured to depart from an afflicted patient; the sense of the verb becomes truly \"exorcistic.\"17 Though perhaps the difference is perfunctory, it is not unimportant, for this \"amuletic\" use of έξορκίζω is, with few exceptions, both distinctly Jewish and exor-cistic. It is what gives rise, in the history of magic, to the special category of healing amulet that will have important ramifications for the development of later Christian ritual. In the examples discussed below, however, we shall also find that έξορκίζω in the adjurations of the defixiones points to a particularly Jewish use of the verb.

The serial adjurations of the Jewish god and of his saving acts found in the early Judeo-Greek exorcisms reappear in the context of the curses and defixiones .18 Linguistically, as well, there can be little doubt that the use of έξορκίζω to adjure demons—whether those who fetch and serve or those that are expelled—mirrors an originally Semitic שבע, \"to adjure\"—a verb used in the Dead Sea Scrolls for exorcism, as well as in later Aramaic amulets.19 Before examining the individual examples of this special cate-gory of adjuration, the exorcism, it would prove worthwhile to present two possible \"ancestors\" of our more fully developed exorcistic texts: the one, a Hellenistic Greek amulet on lead; the other, a roughly contemporary Hellenistic Jewish exorcism from the apocrypha. We will apply these two examples to construct a \"trajectory\" of exorcistic theory in order to facilitate our under-standing of how later exorcistic texts developed into a fixed form of sorts. *  * * The classical and Hellenistic Greek worlds have left us with sur-prisingly few ancient texts that could be described as amulets, even fewer that speak of warding off demons. Prophetic healers and ίατρομάντεις,20 the most famous of whom was perhaps Orpheus, 18 The έξορκίζω-type adjurations, whatever their contexts, are often distinc-tively Jewish in their formulae and magic names. Cf., e.g., PGMXVI. 9f.: όρκίζω σε, νεκυδοάμονα, κατά του Άδωνοάου Σαβ[αώθ] αμαραχθει αξιαωθ, κτλ. The adjuration formula occurs in seriatim, as in the more standard exorcistic examples discussed below. 19 Forms of שבע are common on the magic lamellae of gold, silver, copper, and bronze. The now standard corpora of these amulets are those of Naveh and Shaked: J. Naveh and S. Shaked, Amulets and Magic Bowls.

The inscription had evidently been doubled over several times into a compact square to be worn as an amulet.24 Much of the text is clearly difficult; however, there is enough preserved to demonstrate that we have an incantation written against noxious spirits described variously as Epaphos, a she-wolf (λύκαινα), a dog (κΰων)—or pair of dogs (κύνε)—and the like.25 In charms and incantations with liturgical directions for their use.\" See also Lain Entralgo, Therapy of the Word, 48-49; G.

Despite some lacunae, these seem to describe the \"wicked things\" (κακά) that some sorcerer had apparently concocted in an ointment or potion; the hexameters work as a counter-charm against ghosts and demons sent against the holder of the amulet.26 This text shows at an early stage two crucial procedures for the expelling of demons: the use of the \"flee\"-formula and the applica-tion of an oath (όρκος). Though the demonology of this relatively early Greek charm does not contain a notion of a possessing de-mon, the tablet's rich folklore shows animal-plagues being van-quished by invocations that become standard in the later, true exorcistic texts. The method is rather straightforward: alongside the summoning of Greek healing gods, the incantation wards off the demons by commanding them to flee (φεΰγε). This stratagem of expulsion is widely found in late antique magic spells, particu-larly in exorcisms, but can also be used of banishing diseases and ailments in general—themselves the manifestation of demonic activity. The φεύγε-formula is used several times in the Phalasarna piece in commanding the animal-demons with the aim of driving them back mad to their own domains (μαινόμενοι δ<ρ>άντων προς δώματα αυτοί) έκαστος).27 \"Theriomorphic Demons and House Amulets,\" with many very insightful argu-ments on this and kindred texts. 26 I hope to argue elsewhere that the Phalasarna tablet was written against Erinyes-like avenging ghosts that had been sent against the holder of the charm, much in the same way as the regulations drafted against such ghosts at 4 th century BCE Kyrene (Burkert, Orientalizing Revolution, 68-73) or at 5th century BCE Selinous (note 9 above). 27 Another early Greek papyrus spell, the famous chant of Philinna from Thes-saly (PGM XX), dated to the 1st century BCE, also preserves fragmentary hexame-ters commanding a headache, described alongside animal-demons, to flee (the text is studied further by Faraone in this volume); see also Furley, \"Form und Funk-tion,\" 93-95. The representation of demons in various animal forms is, of course, originally Near Eastern, and there is no reason not to acknowledge that the Greeks of the archaic period borrowed extensively from their Mesopotamian neighbors; see E. Langton, Essentials of Demonology: A Study of Jewish and Christian Doctrine, Its Origin and Development (London, 1949). Theriomor-phic demons were also described in the Hebrew Bible, but this particular demon-ology seems to have had little influence on the later anthropology of first-century Syro-Palestinian demonology."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"As for the Phalasarna tablet's use of the oath for the ridding of plagues and demons, we have a little less to go on. The context of line 9 yields little sense; only the verbal form όρκόμεν, \"we adjure\" (or \"let us adjure\"), seems certain,28 followed by the letters πομ-ποα [.. ] ρτωι—letters that, fractured as they are, certainly summon to mind Hermes Pompaios, the \"conductor of souls.\" This could further pursuade one to deduce that the twin \"dogs\" at the end of the same line refer to avenging spirits, such as the Erinyes men-tioned above, or to escorts of Hekate, or Kerberos-like watch-hounds of Hades. In any event, in ancient Greece oath-takers routinely consecrated their solemn vows by summoning the god of the Underworld. There is hardly reason not to assume that such an oath by Hades is here envisioned and that the string of Ephesia Grammata in line 10 also represents additional names by which the chthonian oath was made. The adjuration, then, can best be understood as the administration of a magic oath by both the power of the Netherworld and by the authority of the famous \"Ephesian letters.\" όρκόμεν surely operates as a supernaturally binding formula, which in tandem with φεύγειν aims to banish the harrassing demons represented as theriomorphic. But there are also other compelling phrases found on the tablet for banishing noxious influences. In lines 10-11 a list of magic names seems to be cryptically ordered to \"drive away\" (έλαύνετε), by force (ßiqc), a she-goat from a garden. Though the lines may have originally come from an older, independent context in the Mysteries, in their present setting the words \"drive away from the garden\" probably have in mind protection and purification of the owner's actual estate; the she-goat will then be a kind of goat-demon like those of Near Eastern heritage.29 This would parallel 28 While this essay was already in press, I noticed that Jordan (n. 24, above) prints όρκομεμ, which is seemingly inconsistent with his actual tracing (APKOMEM = άρκώμεν, \"let us ward off\" / \"we are warding off). But his printed reading (and our interpretation), όρκώμεν, may still be defensible. In several places on the tablet A is mistaken for Ο (e.g., πατωι for ποτωι in line 20). Also the 1st person plural (άρκώμεν) might perhaps be inconsistent with other verbs of driving away (as in line 11, έλαύν ετε) that invoke the deities to act. 29 Cf. the Hebrew male së^rîm, a kind of hairy demon in the form of a he-goat (Lev 17:7; Isa 13:21; 34:14; 2 Chron 11:15). The female counterpart, the ser1rāh, \"she-goat\" (Lev 4:28; 5:6), would match our tablet's 05ξ (line 11); cf. the šēdîm (demons) of Deut 32:17; Psalm 106:37. In Isa 13:21; 34:14 së'îrîm (cf. Aramaic së^rîn) is rendered σειρήνες in LXX. Greek σαρ-ήν. ήνος, ή, is morphologically identical to Semitic se and must be a loan-word.

The banishing motif thus represents one of spatial relationships and boundaries. The demons do not belong in the realm of the living but of the dead. The use of έλαύνειν in the Phalasarna text for driving out de-mons is common as an exorcistic verb in later texts, especially in the context of making oaths. One may cite, by way of example, Lucian, who in his Lover of Lies (16) tells of an exorcist using \"oaths and threats to drive out a demon\" (ό δέ όρκους έπάγων ... κοά απειλών έξελαύνει τόν δαίμονα). And a text on a gold tablet, also from Thessaly like the Philinna papyrus, similarly describes an unusual δαιμόνων ελάτης \"a driver of demons,\" on a house amu-let—the epithet is cognate with our verb έλαύνειν.30 The Phalasarna tablet works its protective magic by also sum-moning one of the more famous of the so-called \"Ephesian Let-ters,\" the powerful Damnameneus, who is to \"tame (or subdue) by force those wickedly constraining.\" The imperative \"tame\" (δάμασον) as well as the adverbial άνάγκφ (\"by force\") provide twin etymological aitia of the god's name: Damnameneus is the one who \"subdues, tames, or conquers\" by constraint.31 The power-ful name of Damnameneus is one encountered often in later magi-cal texts. \"Necessity\" or \"Constraint\" (Anankê) is also the focus of the Thracian tablets in the Alcestis named above. The example of the Phalasarna tablet, though far removed from the later demonology of spontaneous possession, provides us with the earliest formulaic vocabulary of \"exorcism,\" both in its par-is no accident that line 12 of the Phalasarna tablet also mentions a mysterious \"windy promontory\" (άνεμώλιος ακτή), the very place from which the sirens could control the winds and lure (Cretan) sailors to their deaths. All these traits can be explained as cultural translations of the goat-like Semitic séCîrìm/-ìn, and serrât—\"sirens\"—that the Phalasarna spell has rendered as male and female goats (τράγος/αΐξ).

These and other ele-ments of this Greek form of \"exorcism,\" so to speak, shall come up again in many of the exorcistic amulets of later antiquity. First, though, before examining these in some detail, we must direct our focus to the particular notion of Jewish expulsion of demons and exorcism. * # * We find little in the Jewish scriptures that speaks of exorcism of demons, though the story of the evil spirit that afflicts Saul in the Book of Kings provides the classical identification of David as an exorcist par excellence in the tradition of Solomon.32 From this account, and no doubt additional influences, the Qumran Commu-nity of the Dead Sea Scrolls seems to have developed its own liturgical system of exorcism, as mentioned above; however, since these texts are largely in Aramaic and lie outside the scope of this study, we turn rather to the apocryphal Book of Tobit, whose well-known account of exorcism is given in Greek. The Book of Tobit, known from two main Greek recensions of the Septuagint, was probably originally composed around the 3rd century BCE, though perhaps in Aramaic;33 it thus represents a 32 Although an έξορκίζ0>־ί[)Γπηα13 similar to that of Acts 19 is attested several times in more civil or mundane contexts where other human beings, and not spirits, are adjured by oath. The evil spirit that afflicts Saul in the Book of Kings (1 Kings 16:14-16, 23; 19:9) is in feet a \"wicked spirit\" (LXX πνεύμα πονηρόν), though this is one that is sent by the Lord himself, as a form of punishment or trial. David, as an early Jewish exorcist himself anticipating Solomon of later lore, is able to ward off the spirit by singing and playing the kinnor (1 Kings 16:23 LXX: άφίστατο oat' αύτοΰ τό πνεύμα τό πονηρόν). 33 That of Codex Sinaiticus (S = Rs) and that of Vaticanus and Alexandrinus (BA = Rv). A third, textually mixed recension ( = Rc) contains only 6:9-12:22; see D. C. Simpson, \"The Chief Recensions of the Book of Tobit,\" JTS 14 (1912-13): 516-30. The recent publication of some fragmentary Aramaic portions from Qumran may antiquate earlier reconstructions. On Tobit, see Carey A.

Tobias, Tobit's son, while embarking on a journey to Ecbatana in Media, with Raphael the archangel,35 encounters the magical fish at the banks of the Tigris River. The angel exhorts the lad to capture the fish, for its heart, liver, and bile carry certain magical properties; when fumigated, they expel demons. Also, the bile rubbed on the eyes cures the blinding leukoma from which the elderly Tobit suffers.36 After the fumigation, so verse 6:8 insures the reader, every as-sault of a demon shall flee his presence. Although here recension BA does not agree in giving the exorcistic expulsion with this \"flee'-formula, later in 7:17 and elsewhere it does: \"the demon shall smell it and flee and will not return forever.\" Again, at 8:3 when the actual exorcism is performed, recension Β A tells how the demon \"fled\" (εφυγεν) to the uppermost parts of Egypt, where Gabriel \"bound\" (εδησεν) him. The same verse in recension S, however, uses somewhat different wording: \"And the aroma of the fish prevented it, and the demon ran away up to the parts of Egypt, and Raphael went and fettered him there and bound him immediately.\" Of some interest is the fact that recension BA of the exorcism evidently reflects in its ritual instructions and overall diction a dependence upon magico-medical handbooks, much like those 34 It has been argued that the exorcistic sources that lie behind Tobit may be based largely on the Egyptian Bentresh-stele, a propagandistic text that tells of an exorcism of a princess.

Because our example is preserved in its final edited, literary form, and does not come from an actual amulet, some differences can be expected. Thus, for example, no adjuration formulae, nor any form of a spoken exorcism at all, are given. The method of casting out is achieved through fumigation; however, it is not unimportant that Raphael instructs Tobias to remember in the bridal-chamber to pray for God's mercy and deliverance.38 The prayer, then, serves as a kind of protective measure—a blessing—against the demon's renewed assault. We shall encounter the same motif again in the exorcisms of the Great Magical Papyrus of Paris, where it assumes the form of a protec-tive amulet that the bearer is actually to wear. 37 That recension gives, for instance, in 6:4, the instructions \"Take the heart and the liver and the bile and set it aside carefully\" (λαβών τήν καρδίαν κοά. τό ήπαρ K0à τήν χολήν θές άσφαλώς). The aorist participle λαβών preserves the common manner of providing ritual in magical texts. It is, in fact, the very form used in the ritual exorcism of Pibechis, discussed in this essay. Even the adverb άσφαλώς is used in magical instruction-books in this manner. The Sinaitican recension, on the other hand, seems to avoid such ritual language altogether. The explicit references to the demonic possession that the fish-remedies cure also differ in the two recensions. The first (BA) refers to the attack of the demon with the verb όχλέω, \"to disturb, annoy.\" Both the noun δχλησις and the verb are commonly used of demon possession in the papyri and literature. One possessed of a demon is explicitly so called in Luke 6:18 and in Acts 5:16: ό όχλούμενον, \"the one tormented.\" Other exorcistic texts also occasionally use the tram. For example, in the exorcistic interpolations of MS. L of the Testament of Solomon, such a tormented demoniac is to be treated by the very ritual described here in the Book of Tobit: κοά λαβών 6 άναγινώσκων τήν àyíav διαθήκην ταύτην Ιχθύος χολήν κοεπνίσας τδν όχλούμενον λέγ<ε>· διώκει σε Ταφαήλ ό παρεστικός (sic) tvdmον τοΰ θεού, \"And the lector—taking this holy Testament (of Solomon)— after fumigating the fish's gall-bladder over the tormented person, says, 'Raphael who stands before God is chasing you.'\" See Η. M. Jackson, \"Notes on the Testament of Solomon,\" JSJ 19 (1988): 19-60. Here, too, it should be observed, we find the ritual use of λαβών. Recension S, on the other hand, calls the demonic attack an άπάντημα. This term, we shall see, is also widely represented in Greek exorcistic amulets and probably derives from Hebrew/Aramaic פגע, \"assault; affliction\"—the very translation given it in the Hebrew version of Tobit; note Zimmermann, Book of Tobit, 81 n. 8. 38 The ritual prayer, now well-worked into the story's narrative, is made to God after the expulsion of the demon: \"Cry to the mercy of God, and he shall save you and show mercy\" [BA] (or: \"Pray and beseech the Lord of heaven that there might be mercy and salvation upon you\" [S])."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"The occurrence of an oath-formula on a Greek apotropaic amulet of Hellenistic date introduced us to the early use of the adjuration. In the apocryphal Book of Tobit we read of no adjura-tion, but simply of an attack of an evil spirit sent to flight (φεΰξεται) by the fumigated heart and liver of a fish. The rite contains no mention of an engraved amulet, nor of the use of divine names; however, the language of the account does use ter-minology occurring often on engraved amulets,39 and a belief in a demon who seizes possession of a person begins to take shape.40 We also observed above that the formalized expression έξορκίζω σε κατά, \"I adjure you, by the ...,\" has its most frequent attesta-tion in aggressive sexual spells and curses (defixiones) that rou-tinely summon a νεκυδαίμων (\"ghost\") to act on the caller's behalf. Such netherworld spirits serve the magicians by targeting their intended victims in a vengeful and treacherous manner. Similarly, the formula can occur in divinatory spells, which sum-mon oracle-giving deities to grant some sort of esoteric knowledge. But less common is the use of έξορκίζω on general amulets and protective charms for healing named afflictions.41 When the afflictions are demonic assaults, as is almost always the case, the formulaic έξορκίζω σε seems invariably to describe the exorcism of the evil spirit. The procedure—even the religious disposition— 39 One benefit that can be derived from such a literary account is that ritual instructions, which might otherwise be lost to the amulets, provide us with what sort of attendant gestures and acts accompanied the exorcistic pronouncement found on the amulets themselves. Even if our account is cast in the form of a literary romance, its vocabulary of exorcism can easily draw us back to the sort of performative utterances found commonly preserved on extant amulets and phy-laktêria. 40 Recension S reads, \"And they shall never more find an abode with him\" (κοά ού μή μεΐνοχην μετ* αύτοΰ εις τόν αιώνα). 41 When we do find these, they can be shown to represent \"composite\" texts that have confiated the formula from coercive spells with other, more \"benign,\" expressions of healing or deliverance; the result is an often bewildering mixing of stereotypical formulae; cf., for example, PGM XVIIIb: Γοργωφωνας (in wing-formation), έξορκίζω ύμάς κατά άγίαυ όνόματος, θεραπεΰσοα Διονύσιον ήτοι τΑνυς, δν έτεκεν ,Ηρακλία, άπό τη[ν]τός £ίγου<ς> κοά πυρετού ή το[ύ] κα<θ>ημερινοΰ ή μίαν παρά μίαν νυκτερινού τε K0à ήμερι<νού> ή τετρ<α>δ<1>ο<υ>, <ή>δη ήδη, ταχύ, ταχύ, \"Gorgophonas, I adjure you (pl.) by the holy name, to heal Dionysius alias Anys, whom Heracleia bore, from all ague and fever, daily or quartan, now, now, quickly, quickly.\" XXXVI 257-60: Άσστάηλος, Χράηλος, λύσατε πάν φάρμακον γενόμενον κατ* εμού του δείνα, ότι όρκίζω υμάς κατά των μεγάλων κοά φικτρών όνομάτων, κτλ., \"Asstaelos, Chraelos, lose every enchant-ment occurring against me, so-and-so, because I adjure you [pl.] by the great and frightful names.\""},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"of such exorcisms differs considerably from the adjurations that evoke netherworld demons to serve a purpose on the practitioner's behalf, and these shall be the spotlight of the remainder of our discussion. * * * The study of exorcistic amulets must begin with the first of two much-discussed adjurations of the Great Magical Papyrus of Paris (PGM IV). The text (lines 1227-64), of which only the exorcism formula proper is discussed here, shows by its title (Πράξις γενναία έκβάλλουσα δαίμονας, \"Excellent Method for Casting out De-mons\") that it is intended to expel indwelling demons.42 The first lines give a unique ritual in Greek involving the crowning of the demoniac's head with olive branches and then, in Coptic, an invo-cation of the \"god of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\" A widely ac-knowledged interpolation, \"Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, the son of the Father,\" then follows (among other things). The Coptic sec-tion concludes by describing the driving away of \"the unclean demon Satan who is in him (sc. the patient).\" The hallmark of this exorcism is its use of έξορκίζω with spe-cific verbs of expulsion: \"I adjure you (έξορκίζω σε) ... to come out ο/(έξελθάν) . . . and stand away from (άπόστηθι) so-and-so.\" These attendant imperatives, in effect, turn the adjuration itself into a true exorcism, for the imperatives represent the resultant action of the adjuration. The adjuration formula specifically aims at expelling the demon: \"I adjure you out\" (έξ-ορκίζω ... έξ-ελθειν); hence, \"I exorcise you\" (i.e., \"I compel you under oath to come out\").43 Beginning with the Western text of Acts, preserved in manuscripts contemporary with our PGM IV, such a combina-tion of phrasing becomes the standard method of expressing exor-cism on amulets and texts of the period.44 42 See R Merkelbach, \"Astrologie, Mechanik, Alchimie und Magie im griechisch-römischen Ägypten,\" Riggisberger Berichte 1 (1993): 49-62, esp. 60-61: \"Ein christlicher Exorzismus.\" έκβάλλην of casting out demons is also used in the Gospels for exorcism: Mk 1:34,39; 3:15,22,23; 6:13; 7:26; 16:9, 17 (par.). 43 This is the force of έκ- admitted by Webster's Third New International Dictionary. Unabridged, s.v. \"exorcise,\" 798. In Greek, έκ- in compounds can mean both \"removal; out, away from,\" as well as be used to express \"completion: utterly\" (so LSJ, s.v. C). The latter must have been implied in the earliest Greek uses of the verb (i.e., έξ-ορκόω), whereas the former is made explicit by the later, demonological uses (έξ-ορκίζω). 44 Though the verb έξελθείν is used of exorcism already in the earliest strata of the Gospel tradition (in Q and Mark), it is only here in Codex Bezae"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Our rite concludes with instructions for the writing of an amulet aimed at the patient's continued protection during convalescence: \"Having cast out (the demon), tie around NN a protective charm, which the patient is to put on after the demon is cast out: (write) these things on a leaf of tinfoil\" (magic names + \"protect so-and-so\"). The text of the lamella itself, however, says surprising little of exorcism.45 The second exorcism of the long Paris papyrus manual also ad-jures the demons \"to come out of' the sufferer and further rec-ommends the manufacture of a tin lamella as an amulet. It also executes its oaths by adjuring the demon by the name of the Jewish god. The so-called \"Tested Charm of Pibechis for those possessed of demons\" (= PGM IV. 3007-3086) promotes a series of magical words that ends again in the formula \"come out of' (εξελθε).46 The spell then addresses the requisite amulet: \"On a tin lamella write, IAEO ABRAOTH IOCH PHTHA MESENPSIN IAO PHEOCH IAEO CHARSOK, and hang it on the patient. It is terrifying to every demon, a thing he fears.\" The rubric guarantees that the phylactery of tin, containing again only magic names, will prove Cantabrigiensis and p38 in all of the New Testament that the verb is used to-gether with έξορκίζω. It seems that the vernacular of D (and p38) is simply mirror-ing an exorcistic parlance contemporary with the 3rd or 4th century date of the manuscript itself (or possibly contemporary with the 2nd-century date of Acts, as argued above). The most recent, thorough study of the document, that of D. C. Parker, Codex Bezae. An Early Christian Manuscript and its Text (Cambridge: Cambridge University, 1992), 30 et passim, dates it to ca. 400. 45 The words to be written on the leaf are permutations of the magic name PHORBA, PHORPHOR, and BOPHOR, a formulaic name found rather on the more compulsive curses of the aggressive-coercive kind. Is the expelled demon, then, being cursed and bound? The presence of the phrase δοδμον, όστις ποτ\" ofo á also shows the language of a defixio. But appended to this coercive formula, however, is a more tell-tale prophylactic formula, φύλαξον τόν Mva, \"protect so-and-so.\" 46 For this spell, cf. S. Eitrem, Some Notes on the Demonology of the New Tes-tament, Symbolae Osloenses Suppl. 20, 2nd ed.

The potency of putting the demon to flight in fear is double-edged, but the motif of banishment remains single. It is the exorcises great psychological weapon against unseen powers. If it is not the demon,s flight that is mentioned, it will be his fear; the net result is the same, once the patient is seen as relieved of de-mons and healed. The bulk of the Paris spell comprises a long series of short, in-dependent όρκισμοί, adjurations-become-\"exorcisms.\" The series in effect contains a repetition in seriatim of the formulaic έξορκίζω σε, with the demon pounded by a relentless series of divine, \"biblical\" adjurations invoking the mighty character and deeds of the Jewish god; the later Christian adaptations of these exorcisms will name the deeds of Christ.47 W. L. Knox qualifies this sort of biblical adjuration as \"a series of exorcisms following a general type of a kerygma of Judaism, with special reference to those aspects of the action of God which are calculated to impress de-mons.\"48 The \"redemptive\" typology is based largely on the bibli-cal accounts of Genesis and Exodus (Ex 7:8-11:10; 13:2If.), though smatterings of other Septuagintal excerpts are spread throughout the text. Such allusions from holy writ contain the sort of narrative themes found again and again in these and later liturgi-cal exorcisms; they ultimately derive, no doubt, from the Hellenis-tic Jewish synagogue.49 In this sense such exorcisms are truly 47 Conybeare, \"Demonology of NT,\" 598-99, on Justin's (Dial. 247C; Dial. 31 IB; Apol. Π. 45A) mention of Christians using credal formulas to cast out demons; idem, \"Christian Demonology,\" 63-64, on Origen's (Contra Cels. I, 6) naming Christians who also use kerygmatic stories to exorcise (... άλλά τφ όνόματι Ίησοΰ μετά τής άπαγγελίας τών περί αύτόν ιστοριών, ed. Borret). Cony-beare, \"Christian Demonology,\" 590, is the first, to my knowledge, to have noted the importance of the use of creed-like formulations in connection with both exorcisms and healing rites: \"I believe, therefore, that one reason at least for the formation of the earliest creeds was the want of a short and effective formula for the exorcism of demons. Jesus had indeed enjoined the mere use of his name; but his followers soon found that this was not enough; and so Origen informs us that to the name was added ... an announcement of the history of Jesus\"—an announce-ment, we may add, that was rendered more effective by being enchanted over the afflicted. These credal exorcisms are surely formed on the earlier Jewish model of reciting the historia of the god of Israel; cf. also Eitrem, Notes, 21-24. 48 W. L. Knox, \"Jewish Liturgical Exorcism,\" 202. 49 The study of credal and liturgical exorcism within the Jewish synagogue and how this may have come to influence the practice within formative Christian-ity cannot be addressed here. For some introductory comments along these lines,"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"liturgical. The Pibechian exorcism itself even claims its essentially Jewish nature: \"For the formula is Hebraic and continually guarded by pure men\" (lines 3085f.). The first of the serial adjurations exorcises the demon by the Jewish god, an adjuration to which again has been appended a reference to Jesus: \"I adjure you by the god of the Hebrews, Jesus, Iaba, iae, abraoth,\" etc. (όρκίζω σε κατά του θεού των Εβραίων / Ίησου־ Ιαβα: ιαη· αβραωθ, κτλ., lines 3019f.). The name \"Jesus\" might be a late Christian interpolation, for the god of the Hebrews would normally refer only to Iaba (= יהרה). Is the use of Jesus' name a mere addition by Jewish exorcists to empower their spell, as in Acts 19? The exorcisms then continue with only Jewish—not Christian—kerygmatic themes: \"I adjure you (όρκίζω σε) by the one who appeared to Israel in the fiery pillar and a cloud by day and who rescued his people from Pharaoh and brought upon Phar-aoh the ten plagues because of his disobedience ... I adjure you by (όρκίζω σε κατά) the Seal that Solomon placed upon the tongue of Jeremiah and spoke,\" and so on. A litany of biblical accounts of God's redemptive acts are enumerated one after another. The \"Hebraic\" adjurations of the spell as a whole look heaven-ward in their exorcistic method: the scene is consistently one of splendor, radiance, and angelology. The adjurations exorcise the demons, as it were, by a sort of fiery onslaught of divine, celestial incandescence: the god by whom the demon is adjured \"appears in fire\" and \"in a shining pillar;\" is called the \"phosphorescent\" (or \"light-bearing\") god (lines 3045f.); it is he who \"burned up the stubborn giants with lightning\" (lines 3048-60), and he is the one whom \"heavenly powers of angels and archangels praise.\" The heavy emphasis on light certainly looks like the esoterica of a more mystical synagogal Judaism and probably reflects the wide-spread solar worship of Yahweh. But the radiance of fire can prove both infernal as well as sub-limely celestial. Precisely because magical texts draw so often upon incongruous ancient sources, Pibechis' exorcism also gives glimpses of a vestigial Greek netherworld demonology—that of the coercive and binding spells of the chthonian world. Juxtaposed to the de-scription of the \"light-bearing\" god comes a seemingly antithetical Beiname, the god who is άδάμαστος, \"unsubdued, inflexible.\" It is an epithet that not only reminds us of our old Greek \"subduer,\" see R. Kotansky (rev. of Lee I. Levine, ed., The Synagogue in Late Antiquity [Philadelphia: ASOR, 1987]) in Hebrew Studies 20 (1988): 167-74."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Damnameneus, it also represents a title entirely uninfluenced by biblical ideologies of God: Adâmastos is none other than Hades himself; his particular title here is modelled upon an epithet famil-iar from Homer (Iliad IX. 158: δμηθήτω—Άίδης τοι άμείλιχος ήδ' αδάμαστος, \"Let him yield—Hades, I ween, is not to be soothed, neither overcome ,\" tr. Murray). In a word, there is no compromise to be made with death. Netherworld and heavenly juxtapositions continue in the text as if to combine a concept of the Jewish creator god with a Greek nether deity. The Jewish god is not only \"the one who formed of dust the race of humans\" (3047f.), he is also the god who \"packs the clouds together and waters the earth and blesses its fruit\" (3050f.). But the same god appears to be he who also τόν έξα-γαγόντα έξ αδήλων (lit. \"leads out from the unseen,\" line 3048). The reference is cryptic; it does not refer to creation ex nihilo— for this is given later in the spell—nor does it refer to God's for-mation of clouds. Rather, it names one who evokes spirits from the underworld: έξάγειν έξ αδήλων means \"to lead out from unseen places\" and draws upon the mythology of the evocation of souls from the dead, the land of Hades. The phrasing is again based on Homer and mirrored in a fragment of Empedocles that describes the famed wonder-worker's magic abilities, one of which was to \"lead from Hades the spirit of a dead man,\" άξεις δ' έξ Άΐδαο καταφθιμένου μένος ανδρός (Fr. 101 Wright). The expression is immediately recollective of the Psychopomp of Souls described briefly in the Phalasarna lead tablet (above). In another adjuration of the spell (lines 3062-64), the nether realms are again mentioned alongside creative activity, though the precise meaning of the passage is difficult to fathom: \"I adjure you by the one who set the mountain around the sea—a wall of sand— and ordered them not to overflow; and the Abyss heeded—so you also heed, every spirit, demon, because I am adjuring you ....\" As the text stands, the Abyss or primordial Sea obeys this injunction, and so accordingly should the demons acquiesce, demons who, by the inherently magic power of the words contained in this subtle \"like-by-like\" formulation, are to recognize their own limitative status and to observe boundaries: their home is the Abyss, and that is where they belong. It is as if the surly demons had signed an unwritten clause in some unseen cosmological contract, the public reading of which—through the performance of the exorcism—has bound them to their legal obligation. This setting of boundaries between the demonic and human realms again recalls the Pha-"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"lasarna tablet with its command that the demons flee to their rightful domains. The exorcism of PGM IV. 1227-1264, the first of the two Paris spells (discussed above), echoes essentially the same views in its threat to bind up the demon with unbreakable chains and to cast it back to Hades. The exorcised demon is fastened with adamantine chains (έπεί σε δεσμεύω δεσμοις άδαμαντίνοις άλύτοις)—the adjective derives again from the same root as the name of our \"inflexible\" subduer, Adàmastos—and is again returned to his dark chaos (κοά παραδίδωμί σε εις τό μέλαν χάος έν τοάς cm-ωλείαις).50 The very daimones of the coercive spells, daimones who are routinely summoned from graves and infernal regions to work havoc, are now \"revoked.\" This revocation reverses the mechanism by which the writers of curses (κατάδεσμοι) evoke their νεκυδαίμονες and fetter them in dutiful service. * * * These motifs—adjurations by the Jewish creator god combined with more chthonian, Greek elements—recur on other exorcistic texts and amulets contemporary with the Great Magical Papyrus of Paris. It is no coincidence that in the majority of cases, the adjura-tions are to be written onto thin sheets of gold, silver, bronze, or tin. Many such exorcistic lamellae have survived from antiquity.51 Regularly, as well, these exorcisms choose and select one or more of the thematic ingredients accentuated above—the demon as a wild beast, the \"flee\"-motif, the command to the spirit to depart, the mention of Solomon and his Seal, and most importantly, the development of εξόρκιζαν as \"to exorcise.\" In the remaining survey of magical texts, we concentrate on limited aspects of these motifs rather than provide extensive commentary. In so doing, we may be able to discern a certain internal consistency within the particular spells in question, a consistency that may well point to a common origin or cultural milieu. PGM VII. 260-271 provides an excellent example of an exor-cistic formula written on a tin lamella. Here, unlike the exorcisms of the Paris papyrus, an important development occurs: whereas in 50 A knowledge of Greek binding spells is certainly presupposed in the choice of language, such as, \"I bind you\" (δεσμεύω σε), and \"I hand you over\" (παραδίδωμί σε)—technical verbs in the defixiones of binding human opponents. 51 Kotansky, Greek Magical Amulets, Part I, gives 68 examples in Greek (and Latin). A second volume of such texts (in preparation) will increase the figure considerably. See also Kotansky, \"Incantations,\" 107-37."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"both the Pibechian exorcism and the shorter Coptic-Greek exam-pie, the tin phylacteries contained no texts that in themselves described exorcism, the whole text of PGM VII gives an adjuration formula to be engraved onto the tablet itself.52 What was formerly a spoken adjuration has now become a written one. Another noted difference in the text of PGM VII, in fact an adjuration of an unstable, wandering uterus, is that the \"exorcism\" is intended merely to check the malicious activity of the offending creature, not to expel it. It was a widespread, folkloric belief that the uterus represented an uncontrollable entity that could meander arbitrarily throughout the body, wrecking torment and generally tribulating the female patient.53 It had to be controlled, and in this manner is the demon of the womb quietly \"exorcised\" by being admonished to abide in its proper domain. The spell contains all the elements of a typical Jewish exorcism, adjuring the womb by the one established over the primordial Abyss before creation, and by the one over the Cherubim. And just as the demon in the exorcism of Pibechis was adjured not to vio-late (μή ύπερβήναι) the boundaries of the Abyss, so also is the womb-demon, likened to a gnawing beast, made to remain in the \"Abyss\" of its own dark uterus: she is to be returned and restored (άποκατασταθήναι έν τή εδρα) to the place from whence she came, \"to remain in her own lands (χώροι).\"54 A second \"exorcism\" in the spell further adjures the womb by the Jewish god \"who in the beginning made heaven and earth, and all things in them\"—a reference to Exod 20:11 (LXX). Distinctively Jewish, too, is the closing exclamations, \"Hallelujah!\" and \"Amen!\" The same \"liturgical\" citation of Exodus 20:11 occurs in an ex-orcism written on an actual lamella, though this time one of silver, 52 The exorcisms of the Paris magical text gave somewhat detailed instruc-tions, including the exorcistic adjurations to be spoken (not written) during various stages of the exorcistic operation. The British Museum's spell gives none. 53 Jean-Jacques Aubert, \"Threatened Wombs: Aspects of Ancient Uterine Magic,\" GRBS 30 (1989): 421-49; A. A. Barb, \"Diva Matrix,\" JWC1 16 (1953): 193-238. An actual gold lamella from Beirut (cited in translation in Aubert, \"Threatened Wombs\") provides an excellent match to the text of PGM VII. 260-71. Published since 1853, but misread, a new edition of the text is now available in Kotansky, Greek Magical Amulets, Part I, no. 51, 265-69 (the text dates to the 1st cent. BCE/lst cent. CE, or slightly later). 54 The verb άποκατασταθήναι is a compound of the normal exorcistic term άποστήνοα, \"to depart, stand away,\" and the reference to the beast as a biting dog compares the rebellious entity to a rustic, savage beast who rages against passersby in the manner of less citified demons."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"not of tin.55 This Jewish text is genuinely exorcistic: \"I ad-jure/exorcise every evil and wicked spirit, by the great highest god who created the heaven and the earth and the seas and all things in them, to come out of (έξελθέίν) Allous whom Annis bore—she who has the Seal of Solomon, on this very day, in this very hour, now, now, quickly, quickly.\" The exorcistic formula compares closely to that of the Western reading of Acts 19. Further, the naming of the famous Seal of Solomon, with a drawing of the seal on the lamella enclosing mm written in palaeo-Hebrew letters, places this amulet in a special category of itself, a category to which we shall turn again, briefly. A Hebrew-Greek copper bilingual lamella from 'Evron in west-era Galilee56 draws on biblical references to adjure a fever to be banished from the body of its client, Casius. The relevant portions of the spell command \"the great and the small fever to (be) extin-guished\" (άποσβήναι), or \"to stand away from\" (reading άποσθήναι), the owner of the amulet, followed by a second adjura-tion of \"the one who made the heavens and founded earth and established sea, who made all things, Iao Sabaoth.\" The formula, naming again the god of the Jewish scriptures, prosecutes the fever, characterized as a demon, by commanding it to \"stand away from\" the afflicted, much as we find in the account of the evil spirit of King Saul, discussed above. But the charm, as a whole, except for its use of the \"mystic\" names of the holy god in the opening Hebrew vocables, is altogether \"orthodox.\" In its being addressed primarily to God and not the disease itself (as in standard ex or-cisms), the text of the lamella truly preserves a prayer whose focus is upon the divine. The Greek begins with a petition reminis-cent of the \"salvific\" prayer in Tobias' exorcism of the demon, Asmodeus: it reads, \"Holy is the Lord! The god who by his word created all things shall give health and salvation for the whole body of Casius whom Metradotion bore\" (\"Αγιος κύριος׳ αύτός ό θεός ό έν τφ α[ύ]/τού λόγφ κτίσας τα πάντα, έν αύτφ τφ λό/γφ δωρήσε ύγίαν, σωτηρίαν παντός του σώματος Κασίου ού έτεκεν Μητραδ-ώτιον).

This simple adjuration—made by (κατά) the living God—describes the offending demon as an apparition or wild beast (φάντασμα, θηρίον). But such potential beasts, at least, are \"metaphorical\"—they are only ghostly phan-toms that can possess the soul: the spirits are commanded to stand away from the woman's soul (ψυχή)!

I exorcise you, rav-aging tumor, by the one who has 'measured the heaven by the span of his hand and the earth by his hand' (cf. Is 40:12, LXX), by the one who 'holds the world as a vault' (cf. Is 40:22, LXX).\"59 57 Text: Kotansky, Greek Magical Amulets, Part I, no. 67, 383-86. 58 5th-6th (?) cent. CE lead tablet. Text: Th.

The command to \"come out of' is the technical term of the exorcisms underscored above. The repeated reference to the demon not harming the adjurer is found in the early Phalasarna lead tablet, where the oath-taker of όρκόμεν adjures that he not be harmed by such things as the tongue of a λεωδράκων. But here the distinction between the exorcist, ό όρκίζων, and the one being exorcised, ό όρκιζόμενος, indicates something new: it must presuppose the use of a text, like those of the \"case-histories\" of the Paris magical exorcisms, that gave instruc-tions to the adjurer on how precisely to heal his patient. In those texts the patient was referred to separately as ό κάμνων, \"the patient,\" and ό πάσχων, \"the suf-ferer,\" respectively—the exorcists, as the \"one who adjures.\" Of note for the text of the Amorgos tablet is the fact that an exorcism engraved onto a tablet (intended to be worn) gives between its very lines a sort of memento of the performative relationship between the client and the acting officiant."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"In the adjuration of the \"womb-demon,\" and even more so in the Coptic-Greek exorcism of PGM IV, we have observed the notion of handing over the demon to the Abyss—a sort of reversal of magic control. Lines 54-60 of the Amorgos text, though sadly broken, give now the truly Christian adaptation of this netherworld motif: Christ's descensus ad infernos. The text reads, \"I adjure you, ravaging tumor, by the one who descended to the nether places [and] on the third [day rose up].\" Unfortunately, three whole lines of the following text are missing. Nonetheless, Christ, likened to the Escorter of the Phalasarna piece, to Pibechis's god who \"leads out of unseen places,\" and to Empedocles who draws out the souls from Hades, descends as well into the netherworld of the Abyss to redeem souls ensnared by the unclean devils. Those possessed of demons, though living on earth, are enchained in their own private, abyssmal existence, and though in a body they must continue to dwell among the dead like the Gerasene demoniac of the Gospels who makes his habitat among the stoney tombs. * * * A remaining group of texts takes up again specific exorcisms that invoke the power of the Seal of Solomon, a motif seen (above) in the markedly Jewish charm of Pibechis and on the Cologne silver lamella. Solomon, acknowledged as the premier exorcist by at least the 1st century CE, needs little by way of introduction: he is attested in numerous sources, Jewish, Christian, and Arabic, and is known primarily from the Testament of Solo-mon as the great king who compelled an army of demons, one by one, to complete the construction of the Great Temple. A late papyrus in the Vienna National Library (PGM Ρ 10) fol-lows in the tradition of the Exorcism of Pibechis by repeating in liturgical fashion an adjuration (όρκίζω υμάς) directed against \"unclean spirits\" (ακάθαρτα πνεύματα). Like the Kibbutz 'Evron tablet, this spell begins with an exorcism of various types of fever. But in line 9, a single fearful spirit is named and described as having the feet of a wolf and the head of a frog—a bizarre theriomorphic depiction recalling the earlier Phalasarna tablet and other Semitic models. Adjurations are made by the god of Israel—in company with celestial angels—and by the minerals and elements of the \"seven thrones of heaven\" (reading [θρόνους] for Preisendanz's [κύκλους] on the papyrus at line 14). The spirits are adjured, as in the Amorgos tablet, not to \"harm\" the bearer of the όρκισμοί. They are told to depart (άναχωρήσατε)—a technical term derived"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"from the Testament of Solomon.60 The text also gives a sort of catalogue of places where the demons shall not hide.

Ianda 14 (PGM Ρ 17), a confusing pastiche of scrambled verses that mix in the Lord's Prayer with a previously unknown Solomonic exorcism, is noteworthy for its title: \"An Exorcism of Solomon for every unclean spirit\" (Έξορκισμό<ς> Σαλομώνος πρός πάν άκάθαρτον πν(ευμ)α). It is a genre of Solo-monic composition already known to Josephus.63 The two motifs worthy of comment are the likening of the afflicting demon to a cobra, viper, lion, and drakon—again the theriomorphic depic-tions—and the reference to a demonic attack as a πονηρόν συνάν-τημα, the special term first occurring in the Book of Tobit, in the form άπάντημα.64 60 Cf.

After all, nearly all cases of the \"Greco-Jewish\" exorcisms we have been studying were written to expel demons, not to sum-mon them up from the grave; they are therapeutic amulets, not malicious curses. Did the writers of these particular defixiones simply take over amuletic έξορκισμοί from the spells of the Greek-speaking Jews and adapt them for their own purposes? Possibly so. But a more likely solution is to be found in a closer scrutiny of the actual provenance of the lead tablets themselves. 67 The text is here close to the incipit of a long Beirut silver lamella that com-bines adjurations of the όρκίζω σε-type with a long series of invocations of the kind, \"I call upon the one who sits ...\" (επικαλούμαι τόν καθήμενον ...); see D. R. Jordan, \"A New Reading of a Phylactery from Beirut, ZPE 88 (1991): 61-69. The text is clearly exorcistic, but also treats other magical operations and is thus too complex to be treated further in this study; see Kotansky, Greek Magical Amulets, Part I, no. 52, 270-300 for lengthy commentary. Another text not dealt with here is a bilingual exorcism composed of about 38 lines of Aramaic and Greek. It treats a whole host of exorcistic themes, including expelling demons that appear in the \"form of a reptile, bird and cattle, or in the form of a human being\" (line 15), and addressing both David and Solomon as exorcistic figures. It is also clearly liturgical, at least in the Greek portions, and deserves further study as to its complex demonology.

The metropolitan areas from which the texts stemmed must have supported numerous local synagogues, and we suggest that it is Gentile contact with these synagogues that would have contributed to the writing up of these adjurations. It is also entirely possible, however, that Jewish practitioners themselves were responsible for the composition of the curses found on these tablets. There is little in them that militates against the literary integrity of the spells themselves, and the text from Hadrumetum is entirely Jewish.69 The fact that a synagogue at Antioch was built over the graves of the Maccabaean martyrs should alert us to the prospects that some form of necromancy or magic ritual was performed at syna-gogues elsewhere.70 Christians flocked to the synagogues for heal-ing and \"because they were sure that the Jews would make them 68 Curse against charioteers in the circus, from Carthage.

A curse (dated lst-2nd century CE) from Megara75 describes a series of fragmentary anathemas as \"sacred Jewish adjurations\" (ύπό των ονομάτων αβροακών τε όρκισμάτων and όρκίσμ[ασί] τε αβραϊκόίς).

Commencing with the tale of Jewish priests in the Book of Acts—juxtaposed to the apostolic use of (uninscribed) exorcistic handkerchiefs—we have found that the rite of expelling a demon follows a set pattern and uses stereotyped formulae (έξορκίζω, έξελθείν, φεύγειν, etc.).

This development of a sort of \"literary\" magic, though used at first in tandem with the verbal exorcism found in the papyri, shows a need to preserve the texts of the actual exor-cisms themselves. By examining the language of these texts (found on lamellae, papyrus, and gems), we have discovered a remarkable constancy in the conservation of age-old exorcistic motifs. We have further noted that the language of adjuration tends to divide down the middle, in terms of \"Greek\" versus \"Jewish\" appli-cation and utilization. What distinguishes the adjurations of the Jewish \"exorcistic\" type from the \"Greek\" evocation-type depends upon each's own characteristic understanding of the numinous: the Semitic πνεύμα άκάθαρτον is an entity to be expelled from the sufferer (the demon-possessed); the Greek δαίμων is a genie awak-ened from the dead to render service. Further, the coercive Greek netherworld adjurations (written on lead and papyrus defixiones) regularly set oaths upon the ghosts of the dead, compelling them of bitter Necessity (πικρφ Ανάγκη). The Jewish exorcisms, on the other hand, adjure the demons by the great God of Israel, the Lord of Hosts (Iao Sabaoth), a Lord made splendid and alive in the recounting of his mighty deeds of history. But we have also perceived a bewildering crisscrossing of the leitmotivs in our hypothetical scale-models. Certain older Greek ideas of warding off demons—particularly the \"flee\"-motif— persist into the Hellenistic Jewish examples of exorcism (e.g., the Book of Tobit). The image of manacling a demon to a nether domain, or otherwise fencing it within a proper boundary, also overlaps in both our Jewish and Greek constructs. Further, the presentation of demons in theriomorphic form is common to both paradigms. Primarily, however, we have concluded that the \"Greek\" adjurations conjure up the underworld dead to serve. True \"Jewish\" adjurations, on the other hand, cast out (i.e., \"exorcise\") the demons represented as actually indwelling the afflicted. Such a theoretical distinction, however, can become quickly dismantled, once we examine the whole spectrum of magical texts containing adjurations. Exceptions will always force us to reevalu-ate the broader context in which such \"exorcisms\" might have arisen. Jews, as much as Greeks, would have been inclined to curse their enemies as to heal their friends. When dealing with highly individual matters of personal gain or the preservation of health and well-being, synthetic reconstructions of cultural models prove insensitive to racial and ethnic boundaries.

Πάρεδρος is an adjective meaning \"sitting beside or near\" from the verb παρε-δρεύω, \"to wait or attend upon.\" In classical times the adjective was used as a substantive to designate a variety of governmental and military officials.1 In the Greek magical papyri πάρεδρος most commonly refers to a supernatural assistant who serves the practi-tioner of magic.2 In this essay I examine the descriptions of the πάρεδροι found in the papyri, offering a taxonomy and discussion of the interrelationship of their various manifestations.3 A number of terms are used in the Greek magical papyri to de-scribe the πάρεδροι. Unlike other supernatural beings, who may be designated θεοί, δαίμονες, or άγγελοι, and nothing else, the πάρεδροι are never identified simply as πάρεδροι. In each text more than one nature or name is ascribed to them.4 1 See the entries under πάρεδρος and παρεδρεύω in LSJ. 2 The term πάρεδρος or one of its cognate forms appears in the following texts: PGM 1.1-42; 1.42-195; IV.1331-89; IV.1716-1870; IV.1928-2005; IV.2006-2125; IV.2145-2240; VII.862-918; XI a.1-40; and XII.14-95. 3 I would like to thank the conference participants for their interest in this topic and Chris Faraone in particular for his careful reading of an earlier version of this paper. 4 Anywhere from one to four different natures are ascribed to each individual πάρεδρος. There are two examples in which the assistants have only one identity in addition to that of πάρεδρος: PGM IV.1331-89, in which the πάρεδροι are δαίμονες, and PGM VII.862-918, in which the πάρεδρος is an δ/γελος. In the majority of instances, the πάρεδρος is described as having two different aspects. The πάρεδρος has two aspects in PGM IV.1716-1870, IV.1928-2005, IV.2006-2125, IV.2145-2240, XIa.1-40, and XII.14-95. In two unusual texts, PGM 1.1-42 and PGM 1.42-195, the πάρεδρος is given four different identities. It is worth noting that the two texts which ascribe the greatest number of aspects to the πάρεδρος' identity both come from the same papyrus and one of them, PGM 1.42-195, offers by far the most extensive elaboration found in any of the documents of the πάρεδρος' abilities."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"In order to understand the different aspects of the πάρεδροι, it is helpful to separate the various characteristics of each πάρεδρος, for instance as deity and physical object, and to compare the portrayal of each of these aspects to that which is found in the other πάρε-δρος texts. The forms which the πάρεδροι assume may be divided into four broad categories: the divine, the celestial, the spiritual, and the material.5 In the overwhelming majority of instances the πάρεδρος may be considered a divine being. In all but three of the texts, the πάρεδρος is identified at least once as a divinity, a divine being of human form, an άγγελος or a δαίμων of non-specific character.6 The term denoting a divine being which is used most commonly to refer 10 the πάρεδρος is θεός, meaning a god or a goddess. Sometimes the πάρεδρος is identified directly with a well known deity, and called by his name. So, for example, the πάρεδρος is addressed as Eros in PGM IV. 1716-1870 and XII.14-95. In some instances what was originally a descriptive title is used as one of the assistant's names. In PGM 1.26 the πάρεδρος is called 'Αγαθός Δ[αί]μων, the \"Good Daimon,\" who in classical times and later was the protective spirit of a family, household, or individual.7 Simi-larly in PGM 1.164-65, the πάρεδρος is called Aion, a name which appears frequently in the magical papyri as an epithet or title of a god and as an abstraction meaning \"eternity.\" 8 On other occasions the allusion is less direct, as when the assistant is invoked as αγαθέ 5 It is impossible, given the paucity of our evidence, to reproduce entirely the original structure of beliefs regarding the πάρεδροι. I present this analysis primär-ily as a means of facilitating our understanding of the material, acknowledging the uncertainty of whether or not the categories I discern accurately replicate ancient belief. 6 The exceptions are PGM IV. 1928-2005, PGM IV .2006-2125, and PGM IV.2145-2240. It is difficult to know whether the άγγελοι and δαίμονες who are not the spirits of dead people should be considered divine or spirit-beings. In the absence of precise information concerning their status, I classify them under the general category of divine being. 7 The ,Αγαθός Δαίμων appears elsewhere in the magical papyri, for example in PGM ΧΠ.244; PGM IV.1609 and 1712, where the variant Αγαθόν Δοαμόνιον occurs.

In a more ex-tended interchange in PGM 1.160-63, the practitioner requests that the πάρεδρος reveal his name: τί έστιν τό ενθεόν σου δν[ομ]α; μήνυσόνμοι άφθόνως,'ίναέπικαλέσωμαι α[ύτό]. The name of the πάρεδρος is then given: σουεσολυρ φθη μωθ. These individualized names would have been of the utmost value and importance to the practitioner. They are valuable because they provide the practitio-ner with direct access to the assistant. Knowledge of the name of the πάρεδρος enables the practitioner to summon and control him. The practitioner need only utter the assistant's name and he appears, ready to obey.10 These individualized magical names may be divided into two categories for the sake of convenience: names which are relatively short and memorable such as αρβαθ Άβαώθ βακχαβρη and σουεσολυρ φθη μωθ, and the much longer, more conventionalized names which are commonly termed voces magicae.n The voces magicae contain many different elements, such as recognizable names of deities, strings of vowels and syllables, as well as names and words which are usually meaningless in Greek but do sometimes have a meaning in one of the other languages from the cultural milieu of the magical papyri. Both the shorter and the longer magical names are used for summoning and addressing the divine being. In addition to these functions they also display the practi-tioner's knowledge and power.12 In attempting to determine the identity of the πάρεδροι, I exclude the voces magicae from my consideration. I do this not because they are unimportant but rather because they are largely incomprehensible to us, as indeed they may have been to the ancient practitioners of magic.13 9 For this epithet of Anubis see PDM xiv. 17, 35, 400 and 422. 10 As in PGM 1.89-91 and 1.182-83. 11 For an excellent brief introduction to the voces magicae see Fritz Graf, \"Prayer in Magical and Religious Ritual,\" in C. A. Faraone and Dirk Obbink, eds., Magika Hiera: Ancient Greek Magic and Religion (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), 191-92 and 210 a 27 for references to the literature. 12 On this issue see Graf, 191-92. 13 On this point see Iamblichus, Myst. 7.4 , quoted by Graf, 210 η. 27."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"When the individualized name of a πάρεδρος is given, it is in no instance used repeatedly. The πάρεδρος in PGM 1.42-195, for example, is not referred to as σουεσολυρ φθη μωθ throughout the entire text. Instead, the most common and general term for a divine being, θεός, is frequently substituted for the proper name of the πάρεδρος.14 When the πάρεδρος is identified with a well known deity such as Eros, the god's name is used without hesitation. This is because the deity's name is not endowed with the same power as a less familiar magical name. In PGM IV. 1716-1870 and XII. 14-95, for instance, the author frequently uses \"Eros\" or \"the Eros\" to refer both to the deity and the statuette of the god. This may be contrasted to texts such as PGM 1.42-195 in which the deity has an individual-ized magical name, rather than a more familiar one. In one unique text, the πάρεδρος is a being of human form. In PGM XIa. 1-40 the practitioner summons a goddess who is called \"mistress of the house,\" ή θεός ή καλούμενη οίκουρός, and com-pels her to serve him.15 Reluctant to endure this servitude in per-son, the goddess transforms herself into an old woman, sheds the decrepit body like a snake's discarded skin, and then reconstitutes herself as goddess, leaving the old woman in existence as well. This old woman is the πάρεδρος forced to serve the practitioner. Al-though the πάρεδρος assumes a fully human appearance, her physi-cal reality is tenuous. The maintenance of her human shape de-pends upon a magical device: the goddess gives the practitioner two teeth, one from her donkey and one from the old woman. The practitioner is to set the teeth in gold and silver and wear them always. As long as he preserves them, the πάρεδρος maintains her form. If he should ever throw the teeth into a fire, the πάρεδρος will immediately vanish.16 The old woman is not herself a goddess, 14 PGM 1.78, 83-84, 87, 90, 91, 93, 94, 95, 96, 155, 187, 192. 15 This is a literal translation into Greek of the Egyptian name of the goddess Nephthys. See Jan Bergman and Robert Ritner's note 3, GMPT, 150. 16 This magical device is similar to motifs found in many folk tales. In the story of Althaia and Meleagros, the Fates appeared to Althaia when Meleagros was bora and told her that her newborn son Meleagros would live until the piece of wood which was on the fire burned to ashes. Althaia immediately snatched the wood off the fire and kept it safe, until one day after Meleagros had killed his mother's brothers, she threw it back on the fire and caused her son to die (Apollod. I. νίΠ; Ovid, Met. 8. 451-525). Compare Stith Thompson's motif F321.1.4.3: a changeling is thrown on the fire and thus banished; and the general category D712.2.1: disenchantment by throwing into fire. D1741.8 also offers an interesting comparison: a sorcerer's power is lost when his teeth are knocked out (Motif-Index of Folk-Literature: A Classification of Narrative Elements in"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"but she is presented as being the product of divine artifice. As such she may be considered a divine being. After the gods, the πάρεδροι are most frequently identified as άγγελοι and δαίμονες of an unspecified character. These two types of beings occur frequently in the Greek magical papyri.17 The πάρεδρος is called an άγγελος in just two texts, each of which près-ents a different characterization of the άγγελος. In the first, PGM 1.42-195, the term άγγελος is used interchangeably with θεός, essentially as a synonym, and the word does not appear to have any special connotations. The situation is far different in the second instance, PGM VII.862-918. Here the άγγελος is a subordi-nate being who obeys the commands of the goddess Selene. The practitioner is not even sure which άγγελος the goddess will send: he gives a lengthy catalogue of the names of her άγγελοι and the hours of the night to which they are appointed, but he is uncertain which one will perform the task for him. He may expect the άγγελος appointed to the hour during which he is performing his ritual, but this is not clear. Despite the fact that their names are given, these άγγελοι lack individuality and are completely devoid of personality. The contrast between the dutiful άγγελος of PGM VII.862-918 and the vivacious activity of σουεσολυρ φθη μωθ in PGM 1.42-195 could not be more striking. Σουεσολυρ φθη μωθ is a \"mighty angel,\"18 a \"mighty assistant,\"19 \"god of gods,\"20 appar-ently subject to no divine power. This is emphasized by lines 130-31: κοά συνφων[ή]σουσι πάντα οι θεοί· δίχα γαρ τούτου ούδέν έστιν, \"and the gods will agree with him in all matters, for apart from him there is nothing.\" Although the practitioner addresses his πάρεδρος-spell to Helios and Selene, there is no intimation that the πάρεδρος is subject to their control.

[Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1955-58]). 17 A thorough examination of the άγγελοι and the δαίμονες as types of beings apart from the πάρεδροι is beyond the scope of my present discussion. The forth-coming concordance to the Greek magical papyri, currently being prepared by Edward O' Neil, will be the starting point for any examination of the άγγελοι and δαίμονες within the magical papyri. I appreciate Professor O'Neil's kindness in giving me the opportunity to see the entries for these two words in advance of publication and regret that I cannot adequately consider the άγγελοι and δαίμονες here. 18 PGM 1.173. 19 PGM 1.181. 20 PGM 1.164."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"the two άγγελοι is further emphasized by the fact that the άγγελος in PGM VII.862-918 is never called θεός, or god, as the πάρεδρος in PGM 1.42-195 is repeatedly. A comparison of these two texts reveals that what appears to be a simple term designating a class of divine beings can have divergent meanings. The πάρεδροι are frequently identified as δαίμονες, generally the δαίμονες of dead people. There are, however, two texts, PGM 1.1־ 42 and IV. 1331-89, in which the πάρεδρος is called a δαίμων, and the δαίμων is clearly something different from the ordinary spirit of a dead person. As in the case of the two άγγελος texts discussed above, the same term, δαίμων, is used to denote beings of different status.21 In PGM IV. 1331-89, the divine beings are παρέδρους του μεγάλου θεού, τους κραταιούς άρχιδαίμονας, \"assistants of the great god, the mighty chief-δαίμονες.\"22 The author goes on to present a lengthy catalogue of their descriptive epithets before asking them to perform a task. As in the case of PGM VII.862-918, the practitioner in PGM IV. 1331-89 has no idea which δαίμων will actually perform his will. He wants to get one of the deity's lackeys to perform his task; any one of them will do. These δαίμονες are, like Selene's άγγελοι, faceless, subordinate beings, controlled by a more powerful divinity. In PGM 1.1 -42 it is no subordinate δαίμων who is invoked: it is the 'Αγαθός Δαίμων, the Good Daimon. The term is used here as a title or proper name for the πάρεδρος, who is equated with Anubis and Orion, although his individual magical name, αρβαθ Άβαωθ βακχαβρη, is also given in line 36. He is a powerful being, as the text proclaims: \"... you who cause the currents of the Nile to roll down upon and mingle with the sea . . . you who have established the world on an unshakeable . . . foundation . . . you who travel through the pole under the earth and rise, breathing fire . . . \"23 The multitude of titles and references confuses the identity of the πάρεδρος, but his authority is unequivocal. These four texts referring to the assistant as an άγγελος or a δαίμων not of a deceased person reveal some characteristics of the πάρεδροι. The term πάρεδρος is used to designate beings of diverse rank in the divine hierarchy. Some of them are powerful beings: these deserve the appellation θεός. Others are subordinate to dei-ties: these πάρεδροι of lower rank may be termed άγγελοι or δαίμονες, but they are not called θεοί. 21PGM 1.1-42 and IV. 1331-89. 22 PGM IV. 1349-50. 23 PGM 1.30-35."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"In two of the texts from the same papyrus, PGM 1.1-42 and 1.42-195, the πάρεδρος is identified with a celestial phenomenon. In PGM 1.30 the πάρεδρος is addressed as ό άγιος Ωρίω[ν, ό άνακ]είμενος έν τφ βορείψ, \"Holy Orion, lying in the north.\" The reference is to the constellation of Orion, which is seen as shaping and influencing life on many levels. The Orion presented in this text can be described in general terms as a deified and personified constellation.24 The πάρεδρος in PGM 1.42-195 is also identified as a celestial phenomenon, but in this text he is a star rather than a constella-tion. Instead of being a specific, named constellation, he is an unknown, unnamed star.25 It is not until he materializes as an angel and a god that he reveals his divine name, σουεσολυρ φθη μωθ.26 The identification of the πάρεδρος in PGM 1.1-42 with Orion serves to establish the cosmic nature and extent of his power. There are no other references to the celestial aspect of the πάρε-δρος outside of this context. The situation is very different in PGM 1.42-195. Here the nature of the πάρεδρος as a star is not used to emphasize his powers. His abilities are amply described in another context, after the ritual for producing him has been explained. Rather, the references to the nature of the πάρεδρος as a star emphasize that the heavens are his home. The πάρεδρος originates from the heavens, descending to the earth as a star.27 While on earth, σουεσολυρ φθη μωθ is impatient to return home.28 His permanent dwelling place is the air: when the practitioner speaks his name into the air, he hears,29 and when the practitioner dies, the πάρεδρος takes his spirit and carries it into the air with him.30 His nature as a celestial being is developed to an extent not seen in any other text. The image is one of a highly individual being, far different from the stately but stiff portrayal of the πάρεδρος as Orion in PGM 1.1-42. 24 The deification and personification of Orion in this text reflect a variety of Egyptian and Greco-Roman beliefs (Erik Hornung, Conceptions of God in Ancient Egypt. The One and the Many, trans. John Baines [Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1982], 80-81; Franz Cumont, After Life in Roman Paganism [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1922], 126 and 208-13). 25 PGM 1.76, 155. 26 PGM 1.162. 27 PGM 1.75-77. 28PGA/1.186. 29 PGM 1.182-83. 30 PGM 1.178-79. There are numerous parallels between the portrayal of the πάρεδρος in this text and conceptions of the soul in Neoplatonic thought. For an overview of some of these ideas see Cumont, 91-109 and 38-40."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"In four of the πάρεδρος texts the assistant is identified as what may best be termed a spirit-being. Most of these spirit-beings are the disembodied former inhabitants of bodies. They seem to be primarily, though not exclusively, incorporeal entities. Most commonly these disembodied beings are the δαίμονες of the de-ceased.31 The πάρεδρος is identified with a rarer sort of being in PGM 1.42-195. Here he is called an άέριον πνεύμα, an \"aerial spirit.\"32 The practitioner is accordingly addressed as φίλε αερίων πνευμάτων, \"friend of aerial spirits.\"33 It will be recalled that the same πάρεδρος is elsewhere called a star, and that during his so-journs on earth he is anxious to return to the heavens, his dwelling place. In addition to being called an aerial spirit, he is also called ό μόνος κύριος του αέρος, \"the only lord of the air.\"34 The term άέριον πνεύμα occurs again in lines 180-81, where it refers not to the πάρεδρος, but to the practitioner after his death: εις γαρ Άιδην ού χ[ω]ρήσει άέριον πνεύμα συσταθέν κραταιφ παρέδρψ, \"for no aerial spirit which is joined with a mighty assistant will go into Hades.\" From this passage it is clear that the practitioner enter-tained hopes of becoming an άέριον πνεύμα following his death. In six of the texts the πάρεδρος is identified not only as a type of divine or spirit-being but also as a physical object. The material objects which are πάρεδροι take a variety of forms: two are skulls, one is a mummified falcon, two are statuettes of the god Eros, one of which operates in conjunction with an engraved stone, and one is an inscribed metal lamella?5 A distinction is made in these texts between the manufacture, the initial preparatory procedures, the magical activation of the object, and the actual use of the πάρεδρος for a specific purpose.36 31 This is the case in three of the texts. In PGM IV.1928-2005 the πάρεδρος is the δαίμων of a person who died a violent death and in PGM IV.2145-2240, the δαίμων of a person who died a violent or an untimely death. In PGM IV.2006-2125 the πάρεδρος is the δαίμων of a person whose manner and time of death are not specified. It is noteworthy that all of these texts come from the same papyrus, and that the πάρεδροι are not identified with δαίμονες of the dead in any other papyri we have. 32 PGM 1.98. 33 Lines 51-52. 34 Lines 129-30. 35 Skulls: PGM IV.1928-2005 and 2006-2125.

In PGM IV. 1928-2995, one of two skull texts, the practitioner is required to utter magical phrases and burn fragrant substances before using his πάρεδρος. As part of the main procedure, which in this instance is an inquiry, he is to write a magical phrase and to wreathe the skull, an action which I would call in general terms manipulation or handling of the object. In PGM IV.2006-2125, the second skull text, the reader is instructed to perform three actions prior to using his πάρεδρος: utter magical phrases, write magical words, and handle the skull. PGM 1.1-42, the text in which the πάρεδρος is a mummified falcon, prescribes a more detailed preparation than either PGM IV. 1928-2005 or IV.2006-2125. The practitioner must first prepare the falcon by killing and mummifying it. Then he writes and speaks magical phrases, and makes an offering of non-animal foods and wine. He engages in ritual eating and drinking and walks backwards. All three of these texts describe preparatory procedures which involve uttering magical phrases, writing magical words and physical handling or manipulation of the object. Although PGM 1.1-42 involves offer-ing non-animal foods and wine, none of these texts involves ani-mal sacrifice. In PGM IV.2145-2240,37 a text in which the πάρεδρος is a thin sheet of metal or lamella inscribed with Homeric verses, two preliminary ritual activities are required: one entails immersing the lamella, όταν βάψης τήν λάμναν, and the second involves acti-vating the lamella, καθιέρωσις τής πλακός.38 Neither procedure is described in detail.

Then sac-rifice a white cock and place beside it seven cakes, seven wafers and seven lamps. Pour a libation of milk, honey, wine, and olive oil. An object similar to the lamella, a πέταλον χρυσούν, an in-scribed gold leaf, is described in PGM IV.1716-1870. This text is more complicated than PGM IV.2145-2240 because it involves three different objects: the gold leaf, an inscribed magnetic stone, and a statuette of Eros. These three objects act in conjunction with one another. Although separate procedures are mentioned or described for each item, the text forms a coherent unit. In lines 1745-47 the practitioner is told, γλυφέντι δε τφ λίθψ κοά τελεσθέντι χρφ οϋτως, \"use the stone, when it has been engraved and endowed with power, as follows . . . .\" No details are given. However, the preparatory procedure for the gold leaf is described. The procedure entails writing a magical phrase, giving the leaf to a partridge to swallow, and killing the bird. The gold leaf is then ready for use in conjunction with the stone and the Eros. The second Eros text, PGM XII.14-95, contains the most de-tailed instructions for activation of a physical object πάρεδρος found in any of the documents. Here the practitioner must speak magical phrases, engage in ritual eating, provide non-animal of-ferings and arrange a table, handle the object, make a burnt offer-ing and an animal sacrifice of birds. The sacrifice is described as follows: κοά λαβών τή πρώτη ήμέρςι άπόπνιξον ζφα ζ· ένα άλε[κτ]ρυόνα, όρτυγα, βασίλισκον, περιστεράν, τρυγόνα κοά τά ένπεσόντα σοι [νε]οσσά δύο. ταύτα δε πάντα μή θύε, άλλα κατέχων εις τήν χέίραν άποπ[νίξ]εις άμα προσφέρων τφ \"Ερωτι, μέ[χ]ρις ού εκαστον των ζφων άποπνιγη κοά τ[ό] πν[εύ]μα αύτών εις α[ύ]τόν έλθη, κοά τότε έ7ατίθει εις τόν βωμόν τά άπο[πνι]γ[έν]τα [σ]ύν άρώμασιν πα[ν]τοίοις."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Take also on the first day seven living creatures and strangle them: one rooster, a partridge, a wren, a pigeon, a turtledove, and any two nestlings that you can find. Do not make a burnt offering of any of these; instead, taking them in your hand, strangle them while holding them up to your Eros, until each of the creatures is suffocated and their breath enters him. After that, place the strangled creatures on the altar together with aromatic plants of every variety. τή δε δευτέρα ήμέρςι νοσσάκιον άρρενικόν π[ρό]ς τόν \"Ερωτα άπόπνιγε κοά όλοκα[ύσ]τα.

Only the πάρεδροι which are man-made objects with no connection to a formerly living being call for an animal sacrifice, which in each case consists of one or more birds. The presence or absence of an animal sacrifice may point to an underlying difference in conception between πάρεδροι which are man-made objects and those which are the partial remains of a formerly living being. I would suggest that when a magical object has its origin in what was once a human being or animal, it is regarded as intrinsically 39 Porphry's Vita Plotini, chapter 10, offers an interesting comparison to this text, although in this instance strangulation of chickens causes the spirit to depart. Recent evidence from animal burials in Egypt suggests that many animals, such as kittens, were sacrificed by strangulation (Alain Charron, \"Massacres d'animaux à la Basse Epoque,\" REg 41 [1990]: 209-13). I am grateful to Robert K. Ritner for this reference."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"possessing magical power. The purpose of preliminary rituals and spells in such a case is to harness this supernatural power, rather than to endow the object with a power it did not previously pos-sess. Man-made objects such as the metal lamella, the two statu-ettes of the god Eros, and the engraved magnetic stone and gold leaf which act in conjunction with the image of the god, lack this inherent connection to a source of supernatural power. The func-tion of the ritual is to establish a bond between the object and a source of magical power. An elaborate ritual of animal sacrifice is the means which pro-vides this connection. The ritual is most fully described in PGM IV.1716-1870, XII.14-95 and XII.270-350. The animal sacrifice endows the magic object with senses, intelligence and mobility. Once it has been animated through the accomplishment of pre-scribed ritual actions, the man-made object is viewed as magically potent. It is now ready as a πάρεδρος to receive and carry out the practitioner's instructions. Although it is possible to distinguish the various facets of each πάρεδρος as divine or spirit-being, celestial phenomenon, and physical object, the aspects are related and complementary. In two instances, PGM IV.1716-1870 and XII.14-95, the πάρεδρος is both the god Eros and a physical object. The object to be manufactured is in both instances an image of Eros, a wooden statuette in PGM IV.1716-1870 which is to be employed in conjunction with a stone engraved with figures of Eros, Aphrodite and Psyche, and an image made out of wax and aromatic plants in XII. 14-95. The two texts PGM IV. 1716-1870 and XII.14-95 form a pair in which the aspects of the πάρεδρος described in each correspond. The πάρεδροι in PGM IV.1928-2005 and IV.2006-2125 also have two aspects, but in these texts they are a skull and a δαίμων of a dead person, rather than a god and a statuette. In one text, PGM IV.1928-2005, the πάρεδρος is the δαίμων of a person who died a violent death. In the other text, PGM IV.2006-2125, this detail is not specified. The similarities between these two texts must be considered in light of their textual relation to one another: they occur consecutively in the same papyrus, and thus appear to reflect two different versions of a similar procedure. Two texts are interposed between PGM IV.2006-2125 and the next πάρεδρος text, IV.2145-2240. Their character is worth not-ing: PGM IV.2125-39 contains instructions for restraining unsuit-able skulls and preventing them from talking or doing anything similar, and IV.2140-44 contains instructions for interrogating corpses. As with the two preceding and one subsequent πάρεδρος"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"texts, these documents give instructions for practices involving human remains. In PGM IV.2145-2240 the πάρεδρος again has two aspects: the δαίμων of a dead person and a material object. As in PGM IV. 1928-2005, the δαίμων can be that of a person who died a violent death, but in this case another option is also given: the δαίμων of a person who died an untimely death may also be used. The object employed is also different from that in the previous two texts: instead of skulls Homeric verses inscribed on lamellae are used. The two objects have few apparent similarities, although the text does seem to reflect the same beliefs about the πάρεδρος observed in PGM IV.1928-2005 and IV.2006-2125. The two texts in which the πάρεδρος is the most complex, PGM 1.1-42 and 1.42-195, also present a number of similarities to one another. It should be noted that, as with PGM IV. 1928-2005, IV.2006-2125, and IV.2145-2240, these texts occur on the same papyrus. Their physical proximity makes their structural parallels more noticeable and suggests that they too may have a common origin or be variants of one another. In both of the texts the πάρεδρος is called a θεός and is identified with a celestial phenomenon: in PGM 1.1-42 the constellation Orion and in 1.42-195 an unspecified star. The two aspects of the πάρεδρος as god and as celestial phenomenon are closely parallel in these texts. The πάρεδρος in each instance is also identified with other divine beings, but the identifications are not directly compa-rable. In 1.1-42 the πάρεδρος is addressed as \"Αγαθός Δαίμων and in 1.42-195 as both an άγγελος and an aerial spirit. Although the exact nature of these beings is not specified, they clearly may be considered divine or spirit beings of one sort or another. I would suggest that the elaborations upon the nature of the πάρεδρος as a divine or spirit-being in the two texts are structural equivalents.40 Parallelism is more difficult to detect in the fourth aspect of the πάρεδρος in PGM 1.1-42, that of a mummified falcon. As noted before, the dead falcon may be considered an object which was once an animate being. There is no apparent parallel for a physical object as one of the aspects of the πάρεδρος in PGM 1.42-195. It may be that it is not the falcon's aspect as a physical object which is important here, but rather his nature as a formerly living being. This provides us with a basis of comparison to PGM 1.42-195. As I 40 The additional category of being found in PGM 1.42-195 appears to be re-lated to the length and elaboration of the description of the πάρεδρος; PGM 1.1-42 is quite abbreviated in comparison."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"mentioned when discussing aerial spirits, the texts suggest that the aerial spirit may in some cases be the spirit of a deceased person. If this is accurate, PGM 1.1-42 and 1.42-195 would both describe a πάρεδρος who is identified with a formerly living creature, although in one case it is an animal and in the other a human being. This is, however, speculative. What can be said for certain is that both of these texts describe a πάρεδρος who has four aspects, and that two of them, as god and as celestial phenomenon, are the same.41 Consideration of the superficial similarities in the aspects of the identities of the πάρεδροι suggests that there are deeper categorical parallels beneath the surface. These categorical parallels form recognizable patterns. These patterns include the πάρεδρος as a god and as a physical representation of a god; the πάρεδρος as the partial physical remains of a dead person and as δαίμων of a dead person; and the πάρεδρος as a god, celestial phenomenon and physical object. The pattern may be seen in Table 1. A series of formulae determining the traits of the πάρεδρος ap-pears to lie behind the texts as we have them. It is apparent that there are different types of πάρεδροι, and that each type is regarded as possessing certain requisite parts. We might think of the differ-ent types of πάρεδροι as the various declensions of nouns in a language. We can figure out the case endings, in this case the broader categories which encompass the various aspects of each πάρεδρος, for some of the declensions. But we do not know how many declensions, or different basic types of πάρεδροι, there were. It is probable that if we possessed more πάρεδρος texts, the other basic types of πάρεδροι would become clear, and then the texts which currently seem to present an anomalous πάρεδρος, such as PGM XIa.1-40, would be seen to be variations of a consistent formula. The Greek magical papyri display an internal consistency and formulaic character. This has often been observed in the use of fixed expressions, both in instructions to the practitioner and in the spells themselves. My consideration of the nature of the πάρεδροι confirms this impression. The variations between similar πάρεδρος texts seem to be different versions of the same tale, rather than completely different stories.

If we insert an anapaestic- or spondee-shaped word after λύκων (i.e., where κρήνας appears in the mystodokos spell) the charm comprises two full hexameters without, however, any syntactical link between them (see n. 105, for a similar problem in the mystodokos spell). Lines 1-5 of Supp. Mag. no. 88 preserve yet another healing charm that seems at first glance to echo the same theme; a logos designed to combat erysipelas (yet another febrile skin disease) begins with the same words έπτά λύκων, έ[πτά ..., but then veers off to speak of \"great bones\" and the goddess Earth. 3 I give the text as it appears on p. 265 of the second volume of PGM1. The restorations and additions are the combined work of Maas, Preisendanz, and Koenen. In the final hexameter Maas (η. 1) replaced Ισβεσαν with έκοίμισιχν from the late-antique version of the spell (Supp. Mag. no. 88. line 8; see n. 2) because it seemed \"more poetical\" and produced a nice alliteration of kappa in the final line. Koenen (η. 1), using parallels from Egyptian myths (discussed in detail below), supplied the additions at the beginning of line 1 and the end of line 2 to fill out the hexameters. For his restoration of άκρ]οτάτφ see n. 98. 4 PGM1 and Ο'Neil (η. 1) translate the verb κατακάω as \"geriet in Brand/ was set aflame\" and πύρ as \"Feuer/fire,\" but both words have secondary meanings in Greek medical discourse, such as \"to be thirsty or feverish\" and \"fever.\" The rubric recommends the incantation πρό; πάν κατάκαυμ[α, an expression that can refer to a fever or a reddish, burning eruption or rash on the skin, such as shin-gles. The late-antique version of the spell (see n. 2) has the rubric πρός έρυθράν, a word that probably also refers (like τά έρυθρά, LSJ s.v.) to reddish eruptions on the skin. 5 This is the usual translation of the Greek word δρος.

This text is a type of mythological narrative known to students of magic as a historiola,6 here we find an initiate, probably (if the restorations are correct) assimilated to a divine or semi-divine child, who is either immolated on a mountaintop, or (as the paral-lels cited below will suggest) in danger of dying of thirst or fever precipitated by scorpion-sting or snake-bite. Salvation is equated with the quenching of the fire, fever or thirst. The date of the hexametric incantation itself has been debated. The original editor suspected that the final couplet had a \"true Hellenic ring\" to it, but he could not find any Greek source for the activity of the seven waterbearers.7 The mention of the mystodokos (\"initiate\")8 and close similarities to a popular Egyp-tian historiola about Isis and the child Horus have led most scholars to conclude that these verses were borrowed from a hymn or liturgy associated with some late-Hellenistic, syncretistic cult like ever, that in Greek texts from Egypt (i.e., like the \"Philinna Papyrus\") the word δρος can sometimes mean \"desert.\" See W. Bauer, W. F. Arndt and F. W. Gingrich, A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament (Chicago, 1979) s.v. 6 In Greek magical texts, historiolae supply a mythical paradigm for the de-sired magical action, e.g., Theocritus 2.45-46, PGM* TV 1471-79; VII 199-201; LXI 45.

Although there are instances—in the worship of Apollo in Greece and Baal in Syria—of the immolation of sacred buildings (see N. Robertson, \"The Ritual Background to the Dying God in Cyprus and Syro-Palestine,\" HTR 75 [1982]: 335-38), it is difficult to comprehend how the destruction of a building (without any eleventh-hour rescue) can provide an aition for the salvation of the patient in a practical healing charm."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"the mysteries of Isis.9 The arguments for a simple Egyptian provenance, however, overlook the Syrian authorship attested in the rubric of the spell itself10 and fail to consider other indications that the incantation is either of Semitic origin or that it has been significantly altered by contact with Semitic culture. In this essay I first review the arguments for Egyptian influence, and then move on to discuss very similar (and even earlier) Mesopotamian myths that also appear in the context of practical healing rites. Instead of simply replacing one \"single-source theory\" (Egypt) with another (Mesopotamia), I argue for the early synthesis of both traditions in the Levant and the eastern Mediterranean world in general, point-ing out that such myths probably reached the Aegean at least as early as the classical period, in connection with healing and mys-tery cults. I conclude by arguing that this short charm about the mystodokos might very well be precisely what it claims to be: an incantation composed by a Syrian woman living in the thoroughly Hellenized city of Gadara—an incantation that not only synthe-sizes two diverse versions of a traditional eastern Mediterranean healing incantation, but also combines Greek and Semitic poetic forms. In short, this brief and unassuming incantation will provide a small window into the rich and vibrant multicultural world of the eastern Mediterranean basin, where from the Bronze Age onward 9 The groundbreaking study is by Koenen (n. 1), whose additions and resto-rations of the original hexameters are used in both the German (PGM1 XX) and English (O'Neil [n. 1]) translations. In essential agreement are, e.g.: Henrichs (η. 1) and W. Burkert, Ancient Mystery Cults (Cambridge, 1987), 20-21. 10 It is usually assumed that this attribution of eastern origin, like so many others found in Greek magical texts, is simply an invention designed to increase the market-value of a spell by claiming some mysterious eastern antecedent; so Maas (η. 1) 38: \"Syrian origin is just what a forger would be likely to invent for the author of a charm.\" H. D. Betz, \"The Formation of Authoritative Tradition in the Greek Magical Papyri\" in B. F. Meyer and E. P. Sanders, eds., Self-Definition in the Greco-Roman World (Philadelphia, 1982), 61-70, explains the frequent false claims to Near Eastern magical knowledge as a way of gaining authority for what are in fact homemade Greek recipes. There are, however, examples of very ancient Mesopotamian magical lore surviving in Greco-Roman handbooks, see, e.g., A. A. Barb, \"Birds and Medical Magic,\" JWC1 13 (1950): 316-18, and C. A. Faraone, \"Aphrodite's ΚΕΣΤΟΣ and Apples for Atalanta: Aphrodisiacs in Early Greek Myth and Ritual,\" Phoenix 44 (1990): 224 n. 9 (magic rings), 224-25 η. 10 (magic ointments) and 233-36 (erotic spells spoken over apples). Nor should we dismiss out of hand the possibility that a Syrian woman from Gadara might have limited renown for her expertise in healing the sick; see P.

My son, have you seen the flame of the Great One? (But) my mouth has water from the border of a stream! I have come to extinguish the fire!\" This spell is to be recited over honey which has been applied to it. In these Egyptian spells Horus' life is saved either by water car-ried by an unnamed woman at Isis' direction or by Isis' own bodily fluids15—fluids which are clearly assimilated to the waters of the flooding Nile.16 In all of these texts, the incantation is recited over an ointment which is then applied directly to the patient's burn, a common enough combination of logos (verbal action) and praxis (coincident ritual action).17 Similar spells for curing scorpion-sting or snake-bite are found on the bases of the so-called \"statues guérisseuses\" or \"Horus cippi\" first attested in Egypt in the New 15 The fluid is assimilated to both the saliva and the urine of Isis. For the cura-tive effect of the former in Egyptian rituals, see R. K. Ritner, The Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice, Studies in Ancient Oriental Civilization 54 (Chicago, 1993), 74-91, and n. 63 below for Greek parallels. The reference to the water (probably urine) from between Isis' legs is odd, but not unparalleled. For the Greek world, see, e.g., A. B. Cook, Zeus (Cambridge, 1933), 3.333-35, and G. Nagy, Studies in Comparative Greek and Indie Meters (Cambridge, 1974), 231-37, for discussions of a similar Greek belief that beneficial rain was the urine of the sky god passed through a sieve. 16 It is curious that these native Egyptian texts never allude to the celebrated fact, at least among the Greeks and Romans, that the Nile river had seven mouths. Such an allusion would offer considerable help in corroborating the Egyptian origin of the seven dark-eyed maidens in the \"Philinna Papyrus.\" The earliest (and as far as I know the only) use of the number seven in an Egyptian mytho-logical narrative of this type is in two much later Coptic spells (A. M. Kropp, Ausgewählte koptische Zaubertexte [Brussels, 1931], 2.3-9, discussed by Koenen [n. 1] 169-70) designed to assuage another kind of burning—the burn-ing of eros. In both texts Horus complains that he is sleepless and suffering greatly on account of his desire for the \"seven maidens,\" and it is clear that the fulfillment of Horus' desire for water in the form of the seven maidens is to be equated with the operator's successful conquest of his female target. In the first spell, Isis rebukes her son for not calling on her for help (Ρ. Hs. Schmidt 1.14־ 17): \"You have seized a cup of little water, because you have not found me, because you have not found my name.\" Isis seems to imply that the maidens would be an inferior thirst-quencher (\"cup of little water\"), when compared with his mother Isis, who is assimilated to the Nile flood. In the second text, the seven maidens are in fact connected with a non-Nilotic water source, for Horus seems to tell how he first caught sight of these maidens \"sitting near a spring\" (P. Hs. Schmidt 2. 5). 17 J. Scarborough, \"On Medications for Bums in Antiquity,\" Clinics in Pias-tic Surgery 10 (1983): 603-04, discusses the Egyptian tradition of bum oint-ments, some of which contain pharmaceutically active ingredients."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"Kingdom; they, too, contain mythological narratives, in which the sacred child (usually dying from fever or venom) is saved by his mother Isis who rushes to the scene with water.18 Several of these inscribed bases have depressions or basins in their upper surfaces in which water collected after it had been poured over the statue or its inscriptions. This water seems to have been given to sick patients to drink or anoint themselves, in the latter case much like the ointments prescribed in the papyrus spells quoted above.19 This use of Nile water to \"save\" living patients from disease and discomfort has also been connected with the use of Nile water in the mysteries of Isis, where water apparently played an important role in pro-tecting an individual from the fires of the underworld.20 18 Κ C.

See Klasens loc. cit. 5-7 and Scott loc. cit. 203-04 for agreement among scholars that there must have been a recognized body of texts and illustrations from which the designers of the pedestals of magical statues could pick and choose in order to create their particular set of spells. This explains why although no two statue bases are exactly alike, the same favorite passages appear again and again in different order and in various trun-cated forms. The language and orthography of the individual spells also suggest that they originated (or at least were codified) at different points in time. In fact, individual healing spells involving stories about the infant Horus appear in the magical papyri and on the bases of statues in the New Kingdom, e.g., see Borghouts (above n. 14) for a translation and discussion of P. Leiden I 348, a recipe book dominated by such spells, which dates somewhere between 1580-1085 BCE. The more recent studies of Kàkosy (p. 60), Stemberg-el-Hotabi (p. 27) and Ritner (p. 105) all stress the continuity from the Bronze Age down until Roman times. 19 A statue base in the Louvre (E 10777) refers to the patient as \"this man who drinks the water.\" Another in Cairo requires that the spell \"be recited over cool water\" which is subsequently laid over the heart of the patient. See Klasens (n. 18) 5-6 and Ritner (n. 18) 106-07 for discussion. Ritner, ibid. 108-09, sug-gests that some of the smaller copies of these statues were probably immersed i η water and then worn about the neck as amulets. 20 Koenen (η. 1) 170-71, cites inter alia the sprinkling of Nile water in the Isis temple at Rome (Juvenal 6. 526-28) and Apuleius* allegorical tale of Psyche and Eros. After Eros (= Horus) is accidently burned and in danger of dying (5. 28 dubium salutis), he is healed by Psyche (= Isis), who brings water up from the Styx and Kokytus (6.13) to cure him. There was, of course, a very old Egyptian eschatological tradition about the salvific effect of cool water in the underworld;"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"The fact that this Egyptian interpretation of the mystodokos spell has remained unchallanged for thirty years is testimony to its coherence and persuasiveness. There are, however, parallels in healing rituals from another Near Eastern culture that help explain three puzzling details in the Greek spell that find no corollary in the mother-and-child stories discussed above: the use of the number seven, the young age and unmarried status of the maidens, and the peculiar blue color of their water-jugs. In a series of second-millennium Mesopotamian medical incantations the daughters of Ea or Anu are asked to bring water to cure the patient:21 Old Assyrian Spell for uncertain purpose22 (Färber no. 1): see G. Zuntz, Persephone: Three Essays on Religion and Thought in Magna Graecia (Oxford, 1971), 370-76 for a brief overview. Several spells of the Book of the Dead are concerned with the acquisition of water including, for example, Spell 63A, which is entitled \"Spell for drinking water and not being burnt by fire\" and illustrated in the fourteenth-century BCE funerary papyrus of the nobleman Nakht (BM 10471) by a picture of a female deity in a tall tree pouring water for Nakht. See R. O. Faulkner and C. Andrews, The Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead (New York, 1972), 68-70. The so-called \"Cool Water\" funerary inscriptions from late imperial Rome and Roman Egypt contain a similar plea on behalf of the dead with similar eschatological expectations (601η αοι 6״ Οσιρις τό ψυχρόν ϋδωρ) and suggest that the tradition continued (in somewhat altered form) for centuries in Greco-Roman Egypt.

This tradition survived well into late antiquity; see, e.g., the threats addressed to the dead in a fifth-century CE lead defixio from Egypt, a text recently re-edited by R. W. Daniel and F.

This introductory statement is almost always followed immediately by the rhetorical question \"Whom shall I send . ..\" and then an exhortation (in the third or second person) that the named deities come and extinguish or cool the burning discomfort. The second-millennium tradition represented above seems to arise from formulaic folk poetry composed orally and exhibits a great deal of flexibility and variety, especially in the first section of the incantations which are often unique, as the examples quoted above reveal. In the first millennium, however, although these types of spells appear to be even more popular, they are being produced by a more \"bookish\" process, whereby scribes manipu-lated a somewhat limited number of standardized lines or groups of lines in order to adapt the spell to an increasing variety of dis-eases.25 As a result, the later versions usually are \"omnibus spells\" designed to combat a large number of diseases, and they generally take the following form: Standard Babylonian spell for skin diseases (Färber no. 4.1): (spell begins with a list of skin diseases) descended [from the stars (?) cf heav]en and made feverish the young men all day long, made feverish [the baby on the sh]0u1der (?) of the nursemaid.

In several of the more fragmentary texts the name and even the nature of the ailment i s lost (2.1, 2.7, and 3.1-3.3). 25 The earlier process (as Färber describes it) is not unlike the oral composi-tion familiar to us from Homeric poetry, where interchangeable formulaic phrases are the basic building block. In the later tradition, however, whole sentences or groups of sentences are quoted nearly verbatim, a technique that Farber (η. 21) 302-04 aptly compares to the use of \"boilerplates\" in legal and other formulaic documents. Both processes allow for some degree of flexibility, but it is clear that these licenses diminish over time. This two-stage development is also observable in other Mesopotamian incantation series, see, e.g., W. Färber, \"Magic at the Cradle,\" Anthropos 85 (1990): 139-48."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"May they extinguish and may then go away (the list of skin diseases is repeated here). Like the Egyptian spells discussed above, this scribal tradition survives into the Hellenistic period; a spell of very similar type, for instance, is extant in six copies, the last of which was found at Uruk and probably dates to Seleucid times.26 Like the earlier ver-sions, these first-millennium spells begin by describing the cause of the disease in mythic or cosmic terms ( \"it descended from the stars ... and made feverish the baby on the shoulder of the nurse-maid\"), and they then go on to exhort the water-carrying maidens to intervene. These Mesopotamian spells offer some obvious parallels to the vignette narrated in the second half of the mystodokos spell. The daughters of Anu27 are expected to draw \"pure\" water from a sea or a river,28 and bring it to the patient in order to \"extinguish\" or \"cool\"29 his or her disease. Their jugs, moreover, are most often 26 Farber (η. 21) no. 4.4, which is designed to cure a mouth disease. 27 Farber (η. 21) 303 states that the first-millennium spells \"give clear prefer-ence to just one version of the motif, the one referring to the daughters of Anu.\" Of the twenty-one versions of this type of MANNAM LUSHPUR formula (named after the incipit: \"Whom shall/should I send ...\") collected by Färber, eleven call on the daughters of Anu (nos. 2.2-2.6, 3.2, 4.1-4.5). Of the remaining ten, three are too fragmentary to know who is invoked (nos. 2.1, 3.1, 3.3) and the rest seem to be individual variations: \"the daughters of Ea\" (no. 1); \"the dweller in great Apsû\" (2.7); \"Enkidu\" (2.8); \"Asalluhi, the son of Ea\" (4.6); \"Marduk\" (4.7); \"the canal inspector(s) of your insides\" (4.8) and \"Bêlet-sêri\" (4.9). 28 The water is more frequently (7x) described as \"sea water\" or \"water from the sea\" (nos. 2.2-2.4) or \"water from the Ayabba (var. Eulaios), the wide sea\" (3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4), but there are variants: \"[c1e]anse (them) in the river with [pure (?)] water\" (no. 1); \"the plant of life, a waterskin [with cold water (?)]\" (4.6) and \"water from the Tigris, water from the Euphrates\" (variant A of 4.1). Nos. 2.5, 4.3 and 4.5 mention water, without designating a particuliar type or source, nos. 2.1, 2.6, 3.1 and 3.3 are too lacunose to know the source of water and nos. 2.7, 2.8, 4.7-4.9 are designed for discomforts that do not produce a burning sensation (e.g., crying babies or intestinal problems) and consequently make no mention of water. 29 Of the sixteen spells that speak of water (see n. 28), the action is usually described as follows: \"may they draw water, may they sprinkle (it), may they extinguish (the disease)\" (nos. 2.3-2.5, 4.1, 4.3, 4.5) or \"may they sprinkle and cool of the fever, the burning of the eyes\" (4.2). Other variants focus on the cleansing action of the water \"[c1e]anse them in the river with [pure (?)] water!\" (no. 1); \"may they draw water .. . and remove (i.e., wash out?) the sty from the eye\" (2.2); and \"may they let (the water) flow into his mouth, so that there be removed (list of mouth diseases)\" (4.4). Only one spell refers to drinking the water: \"[may they draw pure] water, may they give (it) to drink\" (2.1).

We should, of course, imagine for all of these Mesopotamian incantations some accompanying praxis which involved multiple sprinklings with or immersions in water actually drawn from the rivers or seas men-tioned in the spell.32 *  *  *  If one were to insist upon a single eastern source for the mystodokos spell, Mesopotamia would perhaps seem to be a better candidate, as the Babylonian and Assyrian texts quoted above too fragmentary to reveal how the water was thought to heal the patient. 30 Of the twelve spells which mention the containers that hold the water, seven designate vessels of lapis lazuli: \"their golden potstands, their pots of pure lapis lazuh\"(2.3, 2.4, and 3.2 [restored]); \"their potstands of khulâlu-stcme, their pots of pure lapis lazuli\" (4.1, 4.3 and 4.5); and \"their flasks of khulâlu-stone, their pots of pure lapis lazuli\" (4.2). Variants are: \"[pots] of camelian and potstands of khulâlu-stone\" (no. 1); \"the egubbû-\\tssel of carnelian, the pot of khulâlu-stone\" (2.2); \"their flasks of silver and their phials of gold\" (4.4); \" a waterskin\" (4.6).

The later (Middle and Standard Babylonian) versions simply refer to them as the '\"heavenly daughters of Anu.\" Farber's text no. 1 gives the water-carrying role to the \"two daughters of Ea.\" 32 The Hebrew Bible provides a possible example of just such a rite: at the instruction of Elisha, Naaman the Syrian immerses himself seven times in the Jordan River to cure his \"leprosy,\" as a result of which his flesh becomes clean once more \"like the flesh of a little child\" (2 Kgs 5:1-14). The Hebrew word here traditionally translated as \"leprosy\" can refer to a wide variety of skin diseases, but probably does not indicate modem leprosy (known as \"Hansen's disease\"). See M. Cogan and H. Tadmor, II Kings: A New Translation (Garden City, 1988), ad loc., who point out that Naaman's condition was probably some minor skin disease, since he never loses his access to the king's court at Aram-Damascus.

Scurlock brings to my attention a centu-ries-old Tibetan \"Bathing Festival,\" for which the following aition is given: During a serious epidemic the people prayed to a goddess, who sent seven fairy maidens, who poured into the rivers and lakes of Tibet seven bottles of holy water from the jade vase of the goddess.

There is, moreover, at least one example of this type of Mesopotamian spell surviving into the Hellenistic period (the Seleucid-age spell from Uruk), providing the opportu-nity of direct influence. There are, however, several other factors which counsel restraint and suggest that the whole concept of a single, uncontaminated source (in this part of the world at least) may be itself extremely problematic. First of all, there is good evidence that magical spells, especially healing spells, moved quite easily between Egypt and the Levant. The earliest examples are found in a fourteenth-century BCE Egyptian medical papyrus, which contains a number of curative incantations that appear to be in a dialect of Northwest Semitic and another said to be in the language of the Keftiu, nowadays presumed to be the Minoans of Crete; in each case, the foreign incantations are spelled out ρ ho-netically in Egyptian hierogylphic script.33 Influence was moving in the other direction as well, for the Egyptian Horus cippi, which contain numerous healing spells including variants of the burning Horus spells (discussed above), have been found outside of Egypt in Byblos, Hama and Nippur, although here the extant evidence can only be traced to the Persian period at the earliest.34 There is, however, early evidence that the Egyptian mother-saves-the-child myth was borrowed in the Levant in the context of a healing incantation, and thus may have been combined with the Mesopotamian motifs discussed above. A twelfth-century BCE snake-bite incantation from Ugarit contains a mythological vi-33 London Medical Papyrus spells nos. 27-31 and 33 (the Semitic spells) and no. 32 (the Keftiu spell). See R. C.

Montet, Byblos et l'Egypte, Bibliothèque Archaeologique et Historique 11 (Paris, 1928), 249-32 no. 948. The example from the Syrian city of Hama is dated securely between 161-64 BCE, see H. Ingholt, Rapport pré-liminaire sur sept compagnes de fouilles à Hama en Syrie 1932-38 (Copenhagen, 1940), 132, pl. 40.1. J. H. Johnson, \"Appendix Β: A Hieroglyphic Text\" in M. Gibson, ed., Excavations at Nippur, Eleventh Season (Chicago, 1975), 143-50, publishes the example from Nippur which dates to the Persian or early Hellenistic period.

In both, the victim is described as a weeping child38 suffering from thirst or venom-induced fever, to whom a female deity responds by asking what is the matter or by simply bringing help. Furthermore, if we accept Astour's restoration at line 12 (\"O my 0ff[spring (?)]!\"), the goddess is also (like Isis) the mother of the sufferer.39 Some similar myth also seems to be reflected at Genesis 21:14-19, part of the so-called \"E\" narrative, which is usually dated somewhere between the tenth and eighth centuries BCE.40 After Hagar, Abraham5s Egyptian concubine, is expelled from the house at his wife Sarah's insistence, she carries her son Ishmael on her shoulder and wanders the Negev desert. After her waterskin runs gests (ibid., 83-98) that the Canaanite god Horon, who plays such an important role in UT 607 (the much longer serpent charm found with UT 608), may have been assimilated to the Egyptian god Horus, whose name he would like to restore in the lacuna at UT 608.12 (below, n. 39). 38 That the child Horus is thought to weep in the Egyptian incantation can be inferred from Isis' description of the child in the spell from the Metternich Stele (trans. Klasens [n. 18] 54 line M-170): .. the innocent, fatherless child has moistened the banks with the liquid of his eye \" At line e-1 of the so-called \"Socle Behague\" (an inscribed statue base) a similar spell reads: \"The innocent child wept in distress\" (trans. Klasens [n. 18] 55). 39 Astour (n. 35), ad loc., suggests further that the very name of the victim \"Shrgzz,\" which is attested nowhere else in Ugaritic literature, is a pet name of sorts for Shapash's son Ql-bl, and that it means \"chosen child\" or \"favorite child.\" The two alternate restorations suggested by Brown (n. 35) ad loc. either involve a mother-and-son relationship (yhd, \"only son\") or another direct reflection of Egyptian influence (yhr, \"O Hor!\" i.e., the vocative of the Egyptian god Horus). 40 Scholars of the Hebrew Bible use \"E\" to refer to the documentary source of Genesis that regularly refers to god as \"Elohim\" and not \"Yahweh\" as is the habit of the \"J\" source. \"J,\" which is dated to about a century earlier, preserves (as often happens) a very different version of the story of Hagar in the desert (Gen 16:7-15): Hagar runs away into the desert by herself and sits by a different well, Beerlahairoi (\"The Well of the One Who Sees Me [i.e., Yahweh] and Lives\"), which lies between Kadesh and Bered; Yahweh appears and persuades her to return.

For a history of source criticism and a detailed analysis of the Elohist tradition, see A. W.

Fear not, for God has heeded the cry of the boy, where he is. Come lift up the boy and hold him by the hand, for I will make a great nation of him.\" Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. She went and filled the skin with water, and let the boy drink. The well revealed to Hagar is called Beersheba, a name which originally meant \"Well of Seven\" or \"The Seven Wells.\"43 The kinship between this narrative and the Egyptian and Ugaritic historiolae discussed above is clear enough; in all three narratives a divinity hears or becomes aware of an injured or dying child, and subsequently intercedes first by questioning and encouraging the victim directly and then by providing the needed water.44 Even 41 The Hebrew verb used to indicate Hagar's action is sometimes rendered literally as \"she flung the child down.\" M. Cogan, \"A Technical Term for Expo-sure,\" JNES 27 (1968): 133, points out that it is in fact a technical usage for the exposure of unwanted children, usually newborn. Plutarch (de Is. et Os. 14 = Mor. 356f) relates a much rarer variant of the myth of Isis and her child, in which Anubis is the child. He tells us how Isis, fearful of Typhon (= Seth) after the death of Osiris, exposed Anubis, her newborn child by Osiris (the aorist infinitive έκθέίνοα, proposed by Xylander instead of the non-sensical bœlvo, has been universally adopted by editors). Later on, she uses dogs to find and rescue the child. For other attestations of this tale, see Th. Hopfner, Plutarch: Über Isis und Osiris, vol. 1 (rpt. Darmstadt, 1967), 47-49, and J. G. Griffiths, Plutarch: De !side et Osiride (Cambridge, 1970), 313-19. 42 The translation quoted below is that of the Jewish Publication Society, Tanakh: A New Translation of the Holy Scriptures (New York, 1985). 43 Speiser (n. 40) 159-60, argues that the \"original and appropriate ,Seven-Wells' was later replaced by a popular etymology 'Well of the Oath' on account of the homophone 'sheba' which can mean both 'seven' and 'oath'.\" Both etymologies are hopelessly intertwined in the story that follows (Gen 21:23-32), in which a dispute over the water-rights to the well is resolved by an oath solemnized by a gift of seven ewes. For the use of a plural to designate a single well, see the Enneakrounos (\"Nine-Springs\") in Athens, a special, sacred spring for woman to wash in (Thuc. 2.15, with Gomme's commentary ad loc.) and the \"seven rivers flowing from one spring\" at Rhegium in which Orestes allegedly purified himself (n. 59). 44 In P. Leiden 1.348, Spell no. 37 (quoted in full above), fa־ example, Isis di-rectly encourages and questions her son (\"... let your face not tremble, my son Horus! My son have you seen the flame of the Great One?\") and then tells him, \" I have come to extinguish the fire.\" The Ugaritic spell is lacunose, but we find a similar sort of direct questioning of the child (\"... didst thou fall, Ο my off[spring (?)]? Why didst thou fall into a seizure ... and shedst tears like a child?\"), and we presume that here, too, there is a positive outcome from her intervention (see"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"more telling, however, is the fact that the author of the Genesis passage seems almost self-conciously to point to the original provenance of the myth when he informs us that Hagar is an Egyptian, and that Ishmael will marry an Egyptian and become the founder of the nomadic tribes which inhabit the Negev and the Sinai, traditionally areas of Egyptian political and cultural influ-ence. If, as it seems, \"E\" has tampered with a local Negev legend about the miraculous salvation of a famous ancestor by his divine mother, it would certainly not occasion any great surprise to discover that such a local myth would betray strong Egyptian influence.45 Here, too, however, the Egyptian parallels do not explain the whole story; two details recall motifs present in the Mesopotamian spells discussed above. The most obvious is the name of the well that supplies the saving waters: Beersheba, \"The Seven Wells\" which might faintly recall another version of the story in which the seven streams appeared to the child, much like the seven water-carrying maidens in the Greek spell.46 The other puzzling feature is the fact that Hagar carries the dying Ishmael \"on her shoulder,\" a detail that has stymied biblical commentators since it destroys the chronology of events in this stretch of narra-tive.47 Could this, too, be a faint memory of the Standard Babylo-nian spells, which in their formulaic introductions recount how above n. 36). In the biblical narrative, there is a peculiar splitting of the scene, caused no doubt by inserting Elohim and his angel into the divine machinery of the traditional scene and by demoting the mother from divine to human status. The result is that Elohim hears the baby crying and sends his angel who ad-dresses Hagar in the manner that the children are addressed in the Egyptian and Ugaritic examples, i.e., both questioning and encouraging her (\"What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not for Elohim has heeded the cry of the boy, where he is\"). Elohim reveals the water, but even in this reworked version of the story it is still the mother who draws the water and gives it to the suffering child to drink. 45 Similar historicizing of Canaanite, Assyrian or Egyptian myths is not un-known in the books of Genesis and Exodus (see, e.g., Yahweh's appearance to Abraham and his promise of progeny in Genesis 15 or the \"Potiphar's Wife\" motif). For discussion see, e.g., the pioneering work of F. M. Cross, Canaanite Myth and Old Testament Epic: Essays in the History of the Religion of Israel (Cambridge, 1973). 46 This equation between hydria-cvnying nymphs and actual streams of un-derground water is extremely common in Greek thought; see below for a full discussion. 47 According to the established chronology of events, Ishmael should be about fifteen years old; see Vawter (n. 40) ad loc. and Cogan (n. 41).

I would begin to answer this question by pointing out that there is typically a political dimension to the myths about the infant Horus as well. In the Pyramid Texts, for instance, the pharaohs as early as the Sixth Dynasty assimilated themselves to the infant Horus who tramples on snakes and scorpions (e.g., \"Tety is Horus, the little child with finger in his mouth, he can trample on you\") and who if injured can rely on the help of his mother.50 There are also local variants of the myth, in which the god Horus is replaced by the infant son of a king or a high ranking nobleman, who is similarly saved by Isis. Thus according to yet another historiola preserved in the Metternich Stele, Isis is said to travel incognito with a body-guard of seven scorpions to a town on the Nile delta. When a \"noblewoman\" sees her approaching, she closes her door in the goddess' face, an action that prompts one of the scorpions to sting the woman's infant son. The resulting anguish of the child is described in terms of fire: \"Fire broke out in the house of the lady, there was no water there to extinguish it.\" In the end Isis takes pity and saves the child with an incantatory exorcism.51 Plutarch 48 As the question marie in the translation of the Assyrian spell indicates, however, the word for \"shoulder\" here is not secure. 49 C. Gordon, \"Ugaritic Guilds and Homeric DEMI OER GO I \" in S. Wein-berg, ed., The Aegean and the Near East: Studies Presented to Hetty Goldman (Locust Valley, 1956), Grottanelli (n. 32) 649-70, and W. Burkert, The Oriental-izing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age (Cambridge, 1992), 41-87, argue persuasively for the existence of wandering professionals such as artisans, purifiers, prophets and healers, who moved easily about the eastern Mediterranean basin carrying practical \"technologies\" with them, including forms of sacrifice, divination and other rituals. 50 See Scott (n. 18) 204. Prof. Ritner informs me per litteras that the Pharaoh was regularly assimilated to Horus from the very beginnings of Egyptian history. 51 The longest and most detailed version can be reconstructed by combining the beginning of a long spell in the Metternich Stele, and what appears to be the end of the same spell on the \"Socle Behague.\" For translations and discussions, see Borghouts (n. 12) no. 90 and Klasens (n. 18) 52-53 spell no.

Scholars have usually assumed that Plutarch is giving a late version of the Isis story which has been contaminated by the Demeter myth,53 but more recently Burkert has emphasized the importance of the story in the Metternich Stele and has argued for the reverse process: the historiola was originally an Egyptian one which was borrowed by the Greeks in the sixth century.54 In her Homeric Hymn, Demeter, like Isis in Byblos, disguises herself as a mournful old woman and sits by a well in the Greek town of Eleusis. She, too, becomes the nurse of the infant son of a wealthy noble and subjects it to the same alterna-tion of nocturnal burning and then diurnal ambrosia. In the Ho-meric Hymn, as in the story of Hagar, this treatment is part of an etiological myth explaining and justifying the political prominence of the descendants of the child. The idea is a simple one: the goddess shows favor by nursing and imparts a certain degree of immortality as well.55 52 De Is. et Os. 15-16 (= Mor. 357a-d). Isis disguises herself and travels to Byblos in search of Osiris' body. When she arrives in the city, she sits deject-edly by a spring and weeps until she is befriended by the servants of the king, who arrange for her to become the wet nurse for the king's infant. Isis burns this child in the fire by night, and then feeds him ambrosia by day. Burkert (n. 9) 20-21 points out the parallels between this story and the one on the Metternich Stele. There is some evidence that texts like the Metternich stele were known i η Byblos; Montet (n. 34) 249-52, no. 948, published a small undated fragment of an inscribed Egyptian magical stele found at Byblos, which contains spells very similar to Unes 35-37 and 56-57 of the texts found on the Metternich Stele. The fragment was, unfortunately, not found in its original archeological context and is therefore undatable. For the massive Egyptian influence on the city in the second and first millennia BCE, see nn. 56 and 57 below. 53 See S. Hermann, \"Isis in Byblos,\" ZÄS 82 (1957): 48-55; Griffiths (n. 41) 319-22 and N. J. Richardson, The Homeric Hymn to Demeter (Oxford, 1974), 238. Griffiths (loc. cit. 321-22) suggests that Isis and Osiris were worshipped at Byblos as early as the sixth century BCE and that the influence of the Homeric Hymn could have occurred anytime from the Hellenistic period onward. 54 Burkert (n. 9) 20-21; he accepts, however, that Plutarch's story of Isis at Byblos is due to Greek influence (142 n. 42), i.e., it is presumably some kind of mythic \"back formation.\" 55 Indeed, it has recently been argued that the seventh-century BCE cult of the Samian Hera celebrated the goddess' suckling of Herakles, a motif that probably originated in Egypt and spread in the second millennium into the Levant and Anatolia, adapting itself to local beliefs and practices as it went.

There is, however, much archeological evidence of extraordinary Egyptian influence on Byblos for most of the second millennium BCE,56 and despite the breakdown of Egyptian hegemony in the first millennium, her cultural influence remained profound.57 It is not, then, out of the realm of possibility that at some point during the long history of their close relations an Egyptian myth was adopted and adapted by its close Phoenician ally to legitimize the relationship and the power of the ruling dynasty. Such an implicit political connection would be quite similar to that stated explicitly in the story of Hagar and Ishmael in the desert, where the angel promises to \"make a great nation\" of the child. If we assume that the Elohist narrator has borrowed some local Negev tradition here about the origin of their founder Ishmael, it would make sense that here, too (in an area subject to intense Egyptian political and cultural influence), the rule of Ishmael's line would be legitimized by a myth which identifies him with the infant Horus and narrates his salvation at the hands of the disguised Isis, who like Demeter at Eleusis and Hagar, appears as a beggar woman or a slave. *  * * Some of the folkloric motifs of these early eastern-Mediterranean myths are also reflected in traditional myths and lustral rites performed in the Greek world. If we recall the tradi-tional assimilation of fresh-water springs to water nymphs in Greek thought, there appears to be a number of instances in which 56 Montet (n. 34) catalogues hundreds of Egyptian and Egyptianizing objects found in Byblos; see S. Bondi, \"Origins in the East\" in S. Moscati, ed., The Phoenicians (Milan, 1988), 28-34, for a general discussion. During the Egyptian Middle Kingdom (16th-11th centuries BCE) the rulers of Byblos were the only ones in the East to whom the Egyptians referred as haty-a, \"Prince\" or \"Count,\" a title of great respect that was conferred by the pharaoh alone (ANET p. 229; see Bondi ibid. 30 for discussion). 57 Royal inscriptions from Byblos suggest, for example, that the supreme god-dess and royal patroness Baalath (\"Mistress\" or \"Sovereign\") was equated with the Egyptian Goddess Hathor-Isis. Vehimik, the fifth-century BCE king of Byblos, declares that he owes his throne to her and he begs her for protection, long life and vengeance against his enemies. See S.

There are also several myths in which a person threatened with a fiery death is saved by the timely arrival of fresh water, usually by the miraculous appearance of a spring or stream as in the Ishmael story. In general these tales seem to be connected with a long lived Greek belief in the special efficacy of moving water, especially if it could be drawn from several streams or springs.58 In a few instances we hear of water being drawn from seven different streams for lustration. Medea, before preparing the charm to protect Jason from the fire-breathing bulls, bathes \"in seven ever-flowing streams\" (A. R. 3. 860), and there is a tradition preserved by a scholiast to Theocritus that Orestes was ordered by an oracle to be purified by bathing himself \"in seven rivers flowing from one spring\" (έν έπτά ποταμοΐς έκ μιας πηγής ρέουσιν).59 A third exam-pie is a second-century CE oracle response of the Clarian Apollo which prescribes an elaborate lustration rite for the Lydian city of Caesarea Troketta,60 during which water drawn from seven foun-tains (άπό μεν λιβάδων έπτά) is sprinkled in the houses of the city, either to cure an existing plague or to prevent further outbreak. In each of these instances it must be stressed that the polluted houses or sick people are probably washed or sprinkled with the water and 58 The earliest reference is in a fragment of Empedocles (B 143 D-K) that speaks of drawing water from five springs; compare also Sophocles OC 479 (although the phrase τρισσάς γε πηγάς can also be understood as three lustrations from the same fountain; see the scholia ad loc)\\ Menander, Plasma 54-56 (Körte); and Theophrastus, Char. 16.2 (with the sensible emendation proposed by Borthwick [see below] ad loc.).

It comes as no surprise, I think, that such nymphs also figure in a number of Greek myths about salvation from fiery death by the timely arrival of water (i.e., much like that of the mystodokos). In fifth-century Attic vase-paintings of Herakles' apotheosis, artists depict two or three maidens dousing the fire with water-jars (hydriai) as Heracles mounts a chariot for heaven.65 The painter of a late fifth-century BCE pelike in Munich 61 Burkert (n. 49) 55-64, stresses the fact that both Greek and Near Eastern purification rites were thought to provide cures for a wide variety of mental and physical illnesses. 62 See D. Wortmann, \"Neue magische Texte: Nr. 6: Fieberamulett,\" BJ 168 (1968): 104-05 and Daniel and Maltomini (n. 20) 7-10 no. 2, for a silver amulet which contains the phrase: \"If fever catches hold of him, extinguish (κατασβένοις = κατασβεν<νύ>οις) it once and for all.\" Cf R.

All of the editors cited above provide parallels from Greek medical literature. 63 The spittle of the naked maiden may indicate a lustration like that at Cae-sarea or may recall the water from the lips of Isis discussed above (n. 15); given, however, the widespread belief in the magical efficacy of saliva, neither point can be stressed.

There is another Greek tradition that places this type of timely \"salvation\" from fire at the beginning of life, not near the end. Euripides reports the two births of the child Dionysus, the first prematurely from Semele's womb under a lightning blast, and the second from Zeus' thigh (Bacchae 88-98). Later in the same play, however, the chorus adds a significant detail when they invoke the river Dirke: \"... for it was you who once seized the infant of Zeus in your springs, at the time when Zeus snatched him from the cance because of the discrepancy in the numbers, i.e., there are seven maidens in the mystodokos incantation but only two or three on the vase paintings.

There is evidence that in Euboea and Attica hot baths were regularly connected with Heracles; see especially Ar. Clouds 1050 and the scholia. 68 The hot springs at Himera on Sicily were similarly thought to have ap-peared (in the form of water nymphs) to refresh Heracles when he was weary from his labors in the West (Diod. Sic. 4. 23), a story apparently known elsewhere in the ancient world, judging by the connection of Heracles and water-nymphs at curative springs. See M. Bieber, \"Archaeological Contributions to Roman Religion,\" Hesperia 14 (1945): 272-77, who discusses a type of fountain relief depicting Heracles reclining on rocks that have been covered with his lionskin; in each case, nymphs or satyrs fill his raised cup, or the water-spout of the foun-tain emerges from a water-skin tucked under his arm. Bieber suggests that this type of sculpture, attested only in the Imperial period, is related to fourth-century BCE coins of Himera that depict Heracles reclining near the springs mentioned by Diodorus; for the most recent discussion, see LIMC s.v. \"Heracles\" nos. 1322-28."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"immortal fire (πυρός έξ αθανάτου)..(lines 519-25).69 Plutarch, a native Boeotian, associates this story with the spring Kissoussa near Haliartus in which the \"Nurses of Dionysus\" washed the newborn god (Lys. 28.7); according to another early tradition (one preserved by Hesiod, Hippias of Elis and Pherecydes) five or seven nymphs, known either as the Nysai, the \"Nurses of Dionysus\" or the Hyades, were involved.70 There is, moreover, an early version of this story that places the rescue on Mt. Nysa, \"the highest mountain ... of far-off Phoenicia, near the streams of the Nile.\"71 In most of these accounts, we need perhaps only assume that the nurses swaddled and comforted the infant god. There is, however, one later Greek text that suggests the nymphs actually extin-guished the fire. In a somewhat frivolous epigram about diluting wine (= Bacchus) with water (= nymphs), the Hellenistic poet Meleager, another Syrian from Gadara, seems to allude to this very myth (Pal. Anth. 9.331):72 69 Aeschylus' lost Semele or Hydrophoroi (frags. 219-24 Radt) and Sopho-cles' lost Hydrophoroi (frags. 670-74 Radt) both apparently dealt with the death of Semele and the miraculous birth of Dionysus. In both plays the chorus con-sisted of women who probably arrive at the palace carrying water in hydriai, with which (presumably) they wash the newborn Dionysus. See Diehl (n. 66) 193-94 for the most recent discussion. 70 For the Nysai, see Nilsson (n. 82) 111-12. As for the Hyades, Hesiod frag. 291 (West) names five, while Pherecydes FGrHist 3 F90 and Hippias FGrHist 6 F9 say there were seven and identify them closely with the stars in the head of the bull in the Pleiades constellation, whose heliacal rising was traditionally thought to signal the start of the rainy season in Greece. See RE s.v. \"Hyaden\" and LIMC s.v. \"Hyades\" for a full survey of the later literary sources, especially in the astronomical writings. The action of these nurses is not (to my knowledge) actually depicted in early Greek art, although they occasionally appear as bystanders in scenes where Hermes presents the child to Zeus (LIMC s.v. \"Dionysus\" nos. 696-705). For later depictions of two or more nymphs pouring water from a hydria into a basin over the head or feet of the infant Dionysus, see R. Merkelbach, Die Hirten des Dionysos: Die Dionysos-Mysterien der römischen Kaiserzeit und der bukolische Roman des Longus (Stuttgart, 1988), plates 30 (4th cent. CE mosaic), 43 (1st or 2nd cent. CE relief from Perge), 56 (2nd cent. CE Roman sarcophagus), 58 (2nd cent. CE Roman sarcophagus), and 83 (undated Roman sarcophagus). Nonnus claims they are \"the daughters of Lamus,\" a Boeotian river-god (e.g., Dion. 9.28 and 14.146); see RE s.v. \"Hyaden\" 2621-22. 71 Homeric Hymn 1. 8-9 (the lines are quoted thrice by Diod.

The Nymphs washed Bacchus when the lord leapt from the fire and upon the ashes was just then turning. Therefore when Bromios is with the Nymphs he is friendly but if you prevent their union, you will receive the fire still burning. One must conclude that if it were not for the timely intervention of the nymphs, Dionysus would have continued to burn. Despite the confusion over the names and numbers of the nymphs, the one consistent feature of these stories is that Dionysus is immersed in some kind of water or washed by nymphs immediately after he is removed from the fire. If it now seems less certain that the infant Horns was the mystodokos mentioned in the charm, who is he or she? Demophon has been mentioned as a possibility,74 but his burning takes place indoors, he is (to my knowledge) never referred to as an \"initiate,\" and he is not the \"son of a goddess.\"75 If, however, we restore, e.g., [<αίγιόχου δέ> Διός πάίς μ]υστοδόκος κατεκαύθη to the first line of the incantation instead of Koenen's [<σεμνοτάτης δέ> θεάς πόας μ]υστοδόκος, two possible candidates emerge: Dionysus and Hera-cles.76 Heracles was said to have been initiated into the Lesser Hellenistic Epigrams (Cambridge, 1965), 252 no. 127. For Meleager's Syrian heritage and Gadarene birthplace, see ibid., pp. xiv-xvii. Gadara was fully Hel-lenized in this period—\"an Attica among the Syrians\" (Pal. Anth. 7. 417), as Meleager himself describes it—and was remarked upon as the birthplace of several famous men of letters, including Meleager, the philosopher-poet Philode-mus and the satirist Menippus (Strabo 16.759).

Euripides has Dionysus identify himself as Διός παις in the first line of the Bacchae and he employs altered forms of this phrase twice in the Ion (lines 200 and 1144) to refer to Heracles. He also uses Διός γόνος of Dionysus in one of the chorus's prayers to the god at Bacchae 603. See the comments of E. R.

Given the apparent Semitic influences on this text and its alleged Gadarean prove-nance, the regular assimilation of Heracles to Melqart at Tyre and to Sandon (or Sandes) at Tarsus may be significant; both were apparently thought to be immolated and reborn each year in a celebration that is strikingly similar to the myth and ritual associ-ated with Heracles' immolation and apotheosis on Mt. Oeta.78 Given the connection between Heracles and hot-springs it may be significant that Gadara, too, was renowned for the curative effects of its hot springs.79 1964), on line 1, for the importance of this claim throughout the play. 77 The tradition can be traced at least as early as the end of the fifth century BCE, and it probably goes back even earlier to a lost sixth-century epic kat-abasis of Heracles; see H.

G.

He provocatively traced a pattern whereby human leaders (usually kings) imitate the immolation of the chief god of their city (e.g., Melqart at Tyre, Sandon at Tarsus, and Heracles at Sardis), who is himself believed to have been immolated and then reborn at an annual celebration. Although the larger theoretical framework of Frazer's approach (especially his solar gods and the Year Daimon) have been completely discred-ited, his arguments about this pattern of Near Eastern and Anatolian myth and Heracles' connection with it have persisted, although no one agrees how the Greek and Near Eastern similarities came to be. G. R. Levy, \"The Oriental Origin of Heracles,\" JHS 54 (1934): 47-49, argued for a Near Eastern source for the legend about the pyre on Mt. Oeta. H.

According to early Greek legend he, too, was initiated into a mystery cult—the mysteries of Rhea.80 He was threatened as a newborn child by the fire that resulted from Zeus' thunderbolt and was then saved by a special spring (Dirke) or by the Hyades who also seem to have been depicted in art as hydro-phoroi.*1 Most important, however, is the fact that child initiation was a regular practice at his mysteries in Hellenistic and Roman times, and uniquely so, as far as the rest of the Greek world was concerned.82 Thus in the later periods there is increasing interest in his childhood, and the child Dionysus becomes a prototype of the child initiate.83 If Dionysus is indeed the mystodokos mentioned in the Philinna papyrus, this may help explain a significant variation in the late-antique copy of the spell, which reads έκοίμισαν οά-θέριον πύρ in the final line—apparently a reference to the fire of a lightning bolt.84 As seems to be the case with Heracles, there 80 Eumelus Europia frag. 1 (Davies) and Apollod. 3.5.1.

There is still no agreement as to the exact description of the beliefs expressed in the gold tablets. The tradi-tional label \"Orphic\" (given to the tablets at the turn of the century) has been called into question in more recent times. Zuntz, ibid., 277-86 calls them \"Pythagorean\" while S. G.

In fact, since the story narrated in the charm stands at the end (not the beginning) of a long tradition of eastern Mediterranean incantations aimed solely at curing bodily discomforts, I can see no reason in this instance to insist that the author or her source pillaged a liturgy of a mystery cult and then \"retooled\" it for more concrete medical problems—a traditional type of analysis which employs a theoretical model of \"magic\" as a later degeneration of \"religion.\"87 Indeed, even if the story did figure prominently in the liturgy of a mystery cult, there is no need to label its use in a practical, curative charm as a degeneration of some original, purer sentiment.

The model of a single point of invention and then an orderly ripple-effect of successive borrowings from one neighbor-ing people to the next is far too neat and rigid to reflect the con-tinual cultural give-and-take that has always been typical of the eastern Mediterranean basin, an area (we must remember) of rela-"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"tively small compass. This situation is, in fact, typical when one tries to grasp the relationship between Greek myths or rituals and their Near Eastern counterparts.89 Indeed, recent work on the migration of eastern myths to Greece argues vigorously (and to my mind correctly) against such a \"philological\" approach, pointing out that myths are not inscribed documents like medieval manu-scripts that were physically carried from one monastery to another and that can be arranged centuries later by scholars in a rational stemma.90 If one recalls the close commercial contacts between Egypt, the Levant and the Aegean from at least the Greek Bronze Age onward, it seems much more likely that certain popular myths (especially those linked with practical healing or purificatory rituals) would move quite easily among all three cultures, producing an utterly confusing situation, where different versions of the same myth were combined and recombined in a dizzying variety of forms—a state of affairs that a textual critic might call widespread \"contamination\" if it occurred in a manuscript tradition. It would seem, then, that a Syrian woman living in Gadara could have been influenced by a bewildering array of texts and traditions. There are, however, some readily identifiable patterns in these different traditions which allow us to distinguish (as is often the case of Phoenician art, for example91) two different and compet-ing strands of influence, one Egyptian and the other Mesopota-mian—both at work from early on.92 The Egyptian or Egyptian-izing stories involve a small child dying of thirst in the desert or suffering from the venom of a scorpion or snake; the actual narra-tives usually quote (in first-person speech) the words of the mother Isis, by which we learn that she is rushing to her son's side with a 89 See Zuntz (n. 20) for a careful discussion of the mixture of Egyptian and Mesopotamian influences in the texts of the so-called \"Orphic\" gold tablets. 90 For studies which stress the difficulty and impropriety of applying a phi-10logically-based model of the transmission of manuscripts to the vastly more complicated movement of myths and rituals from the east to Greece, see W. Burk-ert, \"Oriental and Greek Mythology: The Meeting of Parallels\" in J. N. Bremmer, ed., Interpretations of Greek Mythology (London, 1987), 10-40; R.

Markoe, Phoenician Bronze and Silver Bowls from Cyprus and the Mediterranean (Berkeley, 1985), 34-71. 92 This approach to the material is admittedly a simplistic one, which ob-scures the robust syncretism that went on at all points in the eastern Mediterra-nean. It, does, however, have a certain heuristic value, as it broadly mirrors the continual struggle between Assyria and Egypt for political and cultural hegem-ony in the area."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"liquid that is frequently assimilated to the waters of the Nile, to her bodily fluids, or to both.93 The Mesopotamian tradition of healing spells frequently has a similar curative focus on \"cooling\" fever, skin eruptions, or burning eyes with sprinkled water, but the incan-tation itself only involves the exhortation of the daughters of Anu, who are encouraged to bring water in blue jugs and extinguish the discomfort or cool the affected part of the body. The Greek myths and rituals predictably reflect both traditions. The mytho-logical narratives of the salvation of Heracles (at the end of his earthly life) and Dionysus (at the beginning of his) present a situa-tion that is dramatically like the Egyptian stories—the son of a deity is threatened by fire—, but whose resolution (the arrival of an anonymous group of young females who carry water-jugs and who are sometimes connected with the sky god94) is much closer to the Mesopotamian tradition. In the Greek tradition these water-carrying maidens are closely associated in etiological myth with sources of underground water (e.g., the salvation of Heracles or Dionysus) as in the Hagar story. The Greek spell attributed to the Gadarene woman is, given its late-Hellenistic date and the language 93 The twelfth-century serpent charm from Ugarit is closest in structure to the Egyptian incantations; a female goddess, probably the victim's mother, ques-tions the victim who is said to act like a child after he is bitten by the snake. As discussed above, we can only assume that the mythological vignette ended with the cure of the snakebite. There is only one small indication, however, that the effect of the snakebite was related to \"burning\", a consistent component of the Egyptian and Greek incantations; Astour (n. 35) 34-35, defends his translation of npl b sr in Une 10 as \"fell into a seizure\" on the grounds of context and \"because of the availability of a fitting Arabic cognate sawrat, sawar, 'force, fire, violence (of an intoxicating drink, fever, etc.),'\" indicating perhaps that burning or fever may in fact be an important element of Shrgzz' suffering. Brown (n. 35) translates the phrase as \"falls in agony.\" My colleague Prof. D. Pardee also points out per litteras that the North Semitic word for \"venom\" used in this text (hmt) is derived from a root meaning \"to be hot.\" 94 Zeus is the agent behind the rescue of the baby Dionysus, but he seems to have been assisted by water nymphs; the chorus in Euripides' Bacchae invoke Dirke as the goddess who received the infant Dionysus in her streams, after Zeus had plucked him from the fire (lines 519-25). Some vague parallels between the daughters of Anu and the Greek Hyades (\"Rain Nymphs\") are perhaps worth noting. R. D. Biggs, SA.ZI.GA: Ancient Mesopotamian Potency Incantations, Texts from Cuneiform Sources 2 (Locust Valley, 1967), 18-19, discusses a po-tency speU that refers to the \"nalshu of the daughters of Anu,\" which appears to be some sort of liquid faUing from the sky; Biggs translates it as \"dew.\" T. Jacobsen, in his review of Biggs in the Bulletin of the History of Medicine 43 (1969): 384-85, goes even further, suggesting that the daughters of Anu were personified clouds. Landsberger and Färber (both in n. 21) refrain from specula-tion on the matter."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"in which it is preserved, understandably eclectic: an \"initiate\" suffering from thirst or a burn is cured or saved by seven maidens who carry water to him in dark-blue containers. As mentioned earlier, the color blue, the number seven, and the unmarried status of the young women all suggest that a Mesopotamian spell has probably influenced the local tradition reflected in this incantation, since none of these details appear in the pre-Coptic Egyptian texts. The persistent bipartite form of the Mesopotamian spells pro-vides, I think, the best clue to explaining the peculiar combination of Near Eastern motifs that presents itself in the mystodokos incantation. Each spell begins with a description of the malady, often in historic tenses and poetic language, for example: \"(the diseases) descended from the stars of heaven\" or \"the ergot entered into the eye of the young man.\" It is in this first section, moreo-ver, that the composer of the incantation had the greatest freedom to choose materials from popular concepts or myths that were not otherwise intrinsic to this particular type of spell, motifs ranging from a traditional description of the onslaught of disease as an animal95 to imaginative descriptions of the patient's unseen body parts96 or (more importantly for this inquiry) to mythological narratives of otherwise unknown exploits of the gods.97 The sec-ond half of this type of Mesopotamian spell, however, is much more predictable: it invariably begins with the MANNUM LUSH-PUR formula (\"Whom shall I send ... ?\") and then usually goes on to request or describe the arrival of the daughters of Anu with their jugs of soothing water. It is not, I think, difficult to imagine how a 95Farber (η. 21) nos. 1 (\"A black dog is lying on the hill; he waits for the scattered pack. His eyes are fixed on a good-looking young man.\") and 4.4: (\"The bu shânu-dise&se gives the impression of a lion; not quite like that of a lion, the bu shânu-àisease's grip is strong. Like a wolf, it takes hold of the mouth, like a tiger it takes hold of the gums\"). 96 Farber, ibid., nos. 3.2 (\"The heart is strong, the heart is a hero. The strong heart's [eyes] are long, it hoflds] a bowlful of blood\") and 4.6 (\"The door is the flesh, the bolt is the bone,\" apparently a description of a tooth and the surround-ing gjim). 97 Farber, ibid., nos.2.2 (\"In, they say, the square field of Enlil, Sin reaped 70 acres of field, had Shamash gather the yield\"), 2.6 (\"The cow is pregnant, the cow is going to give birth. In the courtyard of Shamash, in the corral of Shakkan, Shamash saw her and could not help weeping, E11ammê [= Sîn] saw her with tears in her eyes \"), and 4.3 (\"They are two, the daughters of Anû; between them stands a [clay] wall. One sister cannot visit [her] other sister\"). Färber suggests (p. 304) that this last description (in a cure for eye disease) of two other, un-known daughters of Anu serves as an imaginative description of the patient's two eyes separated by the ridge of the nose."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"Syrian woman living in Gadara, and wishing to compose a tradi-tional type of spell for burns or skin ailments inserted a popular mother-and-child story (probably, at some point, of Egyptian origin) into the first and most variable part of this traditional type of Mesopotamian incantation, which itself had at some point been rendered in delightful Greek hexameters and stripped of its formu-laic question (\"Whom shall I ...?\"), but nevertheless retained the still recognizable daughters of Anu and their jugs of lapis lazuli. Recognition of an independent source of the first two lines of the spell leads us to one further observation: If we remove the supplements of previous editors (based on the premise of a single source of direct Egyptian influence and designed to restore them to full hexameters), the first two lines contain little traditional Greek poetic diction98 and seem to exhibit a formal parallelism that is strikingly similar to that found in the poetry of the Hebrew Bible and other ancient Near Eastern poetry: [ 6-8 μ]υστοδ<£κος κατεκςι[ΰθη] [ύψ]ς>τάτψ δ' έν όρει κατεκαΰθ[η] The repetition of the main verb, although unattractive to the Greek ear, is one of several types of parallelistic technique that mark the highest form of Semitic poetry.99 In this form we get a relatively short sentence consisting of two brief clauses A and B, in 98 Despite the dactylic cadence, none of the vocabulary in the first two lines of the mystodokos spell appears in Homer or the Homeric Hymns. The phrase άκρ ]ρτάτφ 8 έν άρα (if it is the beginning of a hexameter as argued by Koenen and others) may be a combination of Hes. Th. 7 and 484. It should be noted, however, that Henrichs (arguing that the space is too small for Koenen's restora-tion) prints ύψ]ρτάτφ in PGM1, a word that appears neither in Homer nor in Hesiod. 99 Most of the full-scale studies concern poetry in the Hebrew Bible, but they draw on comparative materials from Ugaritic and other Semitic languages: S. A. Geller, Parallelism in Early Biblical Poetry, Harvard Semitic Monographs 20 (Missoula, 1979); M. O' Connor, Hebrew Verse Structure (Winona Lake, 1980), 88-132; and J. L. Kugel, The Idea of Biblical Poetry: Parallelism and its History (Yale, 1981). Levine and de Tarragon (n. 35) 516-18 point out similar instances of parallelistic technique in the Ugaritic snake-bite spell discussed above, e.g. \"[ ] didst thou fall, Ο my offspring (?)]? Why didst thou fall in a seizure?\"(italics mine). For parallelism in Sumerian poetry, see A. Berlin, En-merkar and Ensuhkesdanna: A Sumerian Narrative Poem, Occasional Publica-tions of the Babylonian Fund 2 (Philadelphia, 1979), 19-28. A similar phenome-non has sometimes been noted in Egyptian verse, see, e.g., J. L. Foster, \"Thought Couplets in Khety's ,Hymn to the Inundation,\"' JNES 34 (1975): 1-29, esp. 8-10."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"which Β often repeats the sense of A, but nonetheless completes the thought or adds some new emphasis to it. Of the dozen or so techniques employed in these parallelistic verses, a common one involves exact repetitions of words or whole phrases in a way very similar to the opening line of the spell under discussion here:100 πρό προσώπου κυρίου οτι ερχετοα δτι ερχετοα κρίνοα τήν γήν. (Psalm 94 [95]: 13-4) κοά άπώλοντο παρά τό μή εχειν φρόνησιν άπώλοντο δια τήν άβουλίαν αυτών (\"Wisdom Poem\" in Baruch 3:28) In both of these examples, as in the opening couplet of the mystodokos spell, the second clause repeats the main verb (άπώλοντο and ερχετοα) and then adds extra emphasis or informa-tion.101 Although this type of technique is best known as a feature of very ancient Semitic poetry, we need not assume that the alleged Syrian author of the Greek spell (or her source) has translated some ancient text, since parallelism of this sort appears in Hebrew poetry continually into the late-antique period102 and seems to have been used in the native Phoenician text (dated in all likeli-hood to the Hellenistic period) which Philo of Byblos translated in the Hadrianic era.103 Indeed, it would be rash even to suppose that the first two lines of the mystodokos spell is a word-for-word translation at all; the first five books of the apocryphal Wisdom of 100 Geller (η. 99) 297-98 and Kugel (η. 99) 35-40. I give examples fom the LXX and the Greek Apocrypha to illustrate how such forms are translated into or composed in Greek in the period roughly contemporaneous with the production of the \"Philinna Papyrus.\" Exact repetition of this type is generally avoided in the Hebrew Bible; the reverse is true for Sumerian poetry, see Berlin (n. 99) 15 n. 23.1 provide one Sumerian example: \"My king has sent me to you; The lord of Aratta. Ensuhkesdanna, has sent me to you\" (trans. Berlin, ibid., 14). 101 It is tempting to suggest that the actual layout of the first sentence of the spell on the papyrus in two short clauses ending with κατεκαύθη indicates that the scribe was trying to preserve its parallelistic form, but this is probably only a coincidence of column width and syntactic sense. 102 Kugel (η. 99) 304-14. 103 A.I. Baumgarten, The Phoenician History of Philo of Byblos, EPRO 89 (Leiden, 1981), 100-04, corrects the notion of previous editors that the parallel-ism in the cosmogony is proof of an early date (10th - 8th centuries BCE) of the Phoenician original."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"Solomon were apparently composed in Greek during Caligula's reign (37-41 BCE) by an Alexandrian Jew who employed tradi-tional parallelistic techniques.104 Since the meter of the last three lines of the mystodokos spell is relatively uncorrupted,105 it seems imprudent to suppose that the same scribe (or his source) mangled the first two as badly as the proposed restorations imply. I suggest therefore that the first two lines of the spell may not have been meant to be hexameters at all, but were perhaps written in paral-lelistic form albeit with some attempt at keeping a dactylic ca-dence. The fourfold variation of the mystodokos spell in form and con-tent is, I think, extraordinary, and well worth examining in sehe-matic form: Mystodokos Section Seven-maidens Section Content Egyptian motif  Mesopotamian motif Poetic Form Semitic parallelism Greek hexameter The thoroughly hybrid nature of this spell gives us stronger grounds, I think, for taking the Syrian provenance of the spell seriously. Given the local Levantine tradition reflected in the Ugaritic snake-charm and the Hagar story in Genesis 21, it does not seem farfetched to suppose that a local Syrian poet had at some previous point recast an Egyptian myth in Semitic poetic form. More difficult, I think, is to understand how the Mesopota-mian motif of the daughters of Anu came to be expressed in such beautifully rendered Greek hexameters. It is tempting to suggest 104 D. Winston, The Wisdom of Solomon, Anchor Bible 43 (Garden City, 1979), 12-25. 105 The third line of the mystodokos incantation (έπτά λύ[κ]ων κρήνας, ort׳ ορ[κτων], έπτά λεόντων), although it is a fine adaption of some epic model—as its parallel in the Homeric Hymn to Hermes 223 suggests: ούτε λύκων πολιών, οΰτ' άρκτων, οΰτε λεόντων—makes extremely poor syntactical sense as it appears in the papyrus. There are two problems: the noun κρήνας has no verb to govern it and the entire Une has no apparent syntactical construction with the preceding line. The proposed restorations are unsatisfactory, because they fail to explain what the poet means by \"seven springs of wolves etc.\"; e.g., Koenen's addition of <πΰρ 8 έλάφυξεν> at the end of the second hexameter. Merkelbach (η. 1) 86 offers the following reconstruction without comment: brrà λύκων <κεφαλαί>, έπτ1 άρκτων, επτά λεόντων /<- - - - κρήνας έφύλαξαν>; he seems to have envisaged a building or architectural facade over the spring which has animal-head protomes looming over it. I think Merkelbach is on the right track in suspecting that the word κρήνας is corrupt or misplaced, but unfortunately no obvious emendation springs to mind. It is interesting to note that the truncated late-antique version of the spell (see n. 2 for text) omits κρήνας, but does so to the detriment of the meter."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"that some archaic Greek poem—perhaps even a lost hymn nar-rating Dionysus' birth on Mt. Nysa in Phoenicia or an epic com-position about Heracles' salvation on the pyre—lies behind these words, but this approach does not do justice to the great poetic skill of contemporary Gadarene poets like Meleager or Philode-mus. It seems to me far more likely that the final couplet of the spell is the work of some well trained local poet—perhaps even the mysterious Syrian woman mentioned in the rubric—writing in Greek during the Hellenistic period, but steeped in local mythologi-cal traditions, perhaps even connected with the creation of the curative springs for which Gadara had become famous. In any event, the content of the mystodokos spell and even its peculiar form can, I think, be appreciated in a much richer and fuller sense if we see it as a reflection of a multicultural tradition whose con-stituent parts can never be completely separated and analyzed.106 106 Earlier portions of this paper were presented at the Annual Meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature in November 1989.

Similar to κατάδεσμος, the root meaning of the word group is \"binding\" or \"constricting.\" That basic significance has diverse applications, one being the binding of oneself under a solemn obligation—a vow.5 As such it is related to, and sometimes synonymous with, the more common word for vow, neder (נדר). When the two are distinguished, especially in the post-biblical language, neder means a vow to do, issar a vow not to do, that is, a vow of renunciation or abstinence.6 This is not the place to engage in a lengthy discussion of the various forms of the issar in biblical and rabbinic literature. The form which will concern us is \"I will not ... (e.g., eat or drink) until ...\" In the following discussion I will first examine such abstention vows as they occur in two dis-tinctive types, which I call \"self-actualizing\" and \"agonistic.\" I will then analyze and compare similar cursing or \"binding\" formulae in Greek erotic magic of the Roman and Byzantine periods.7 I begin with the Homeric passage to which I have already alluded. 4 For אסר in general, see M.

The comment of D. Page, who holds this passage in low esteem, exemplifies scholarly bewilderment: \"More than 180 lines have now passed since luncheon stole the limelight and nothing has been achieved.\"8 The most obvious reason for Achilleus' fasting is mourning Pa-troklos, as he himself states (306ff., 312ff., et al.).9 But the grounds of his abstinence center as much in the future as the past. His grief over the death of his hetairos erupts in rage and headlong determination to gain revenge, a determination which is sealed and consecrated by a pledge not to eat or drink until vengeance is accomplished. It is this forward-focusing aspect of the fast to which he summons the entire army: ή τ' άν εγωγε νυν μεν άνώγοιμι πτολεμίζειν ΰιας 'Αχαιών νηστιας άκμήνους, αμα δ' ήελίψ καταδύντι τεύξεσθαι μέγα δόρπον, έπην τεισοάμεθα λώβην. πριν δ' οΰ πως αν εμοιγε φίλον κατά λοαμόν Ιείη 8 History and the Homeric Iliad (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1966), 314. On his view and others, see M. W. Edwards, The Iliad: A Commentary, vol. 5, bks. 17-20 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991), 253. Edwards himself seeks to understand the passage on the basis of J. B. Hainsworth's observation that in some cases in the Iliad (e.g., 2.399, 8.53f.) the meal consitituted part of the ritual of joining battle. Achilleus' refusal to dine therefore stresses the theme of his differentiation from the rest of the Greeks. 9 Cf. Priam for Hektor, II. 24.601-20, cf. 641-42. The practice appears in nu-merous cultures (E. Westermarck, \"The Principles of Fasting,\" Folklore 18 [1907]: 397-409) but does not appear to be a regular feature of Greek and Roman mourning rites (L. Ziehen, \"νηστεία,\" RE, 17.1.95). To the extent that it does occur, however, the mourning fast may have a strong apotropaic component, since in Greek religious conception, as long as the soul of a dead person is near (which would be the case with one as yet unburied), there is danger from demonic infestation through eating and drinking; cf. Luc. de luctu 24, Apul. met. 2.24, and other material cited by J. Behm, \"νήστις κτλ.,\" TDNT, 4.926; c£ also F. Pfister, \"Daimonismos,\" RE Supp., 7.113; Westermarck, \"The Principles of Fasting,\" 403-07. P. R. Arbesmann (Das Fasten bei den Griechen und Römern, RGW XXI 1 [Giessen: Töpelmann, 1929], 28) wishes to understand the present case of Achilleus in this light (see also idem, \"Fasten,\" RAC, 7.464-65)."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"ού πόσις ουδέ βρώσις, έτοάρου τεθνηώτος.10 (205-10) \"No, but I would now enjoin the sons of the Achaians to go into battle fasting and without food, but at sunset to prepare a great feast, once we have avenged the outrage. But until then, for my part, drink or food will by no means pass down my throat, seeing that my friend is dead.\" Achilleusי obsessive behavior and his wish that the army follow his lead annoy Odysseus as much as modem commentators; his response is vintage Odyssean reasoning (155ff.; 216ff.). He asserts that, were it advisable to mourn the dead with abstinence, the Greeks would never eat, and soldiers need their nourishment to fight. Achilleus, however, is not operating in terms of reason. We will best understand him at this juncture if we see as the basis of his actions the belief that renouncing food and drink until a goal is attained solemnizes one's commitment to that goal and sanctifies its accomplishment within the supernatural realm. In other words, the abstinence and emptiness generates a kind of \"power made perfect in weakness,\" to borrow a phrase from the apostle Paul (2 Cor 12:9), a force which both binds and energizes the resolve to complete the stated task. Recognition that Achilleus is operating within a well-established tradition of vow-taking provides adequate rationale for his actions and should relieve some scholarly anxiety over all the talk of food. Luncheon has stolen the limelight for good reason. The persuasive power of Odysseus, however, prevails as it so often does in the Iliad, and Achilleus stands alone in his resolve. Yet Athene, at Zeus' behest, by distilling nectar and ambrosia within him (19.347-54), vindicates his action against the victori-ous Odysseus. In forsaking human sustenance, he has received the food of the gods, which advances his stature beyond that of the other heroes.11 It enhances his might on the one hand and his isolation on the other, two qualities which also characterize an-other great hero and general of antiquity.

First, the empowering force of the abstinence is focused upon military victory and vengeance,16 which will occur by sundown.17 12 Cf. P. K. McCarter, I Samuel, Anchor Bible 8 (Garden City: Doubleday, 1980), 26-27; W. Brueggemann, \"Samuel, Books of 1-2,\" ABD, 5.963. 13 The translation of the clause reflects the MT. LXX: κοΛ Σαούλ ήγνόησεν άγνοιαν μεγάλην èv τή ήμέρφ έκείνη, \"And Saul committed a grave error on that day,\" which puts a different complexion on the entire passage, indicating that Saul's binding of the soldiers by the vow was misguided. McCarter (/ Samuel, 245) accepts the Septuagintal reading as more congruent with the context and rejects the MT as corrupt. I concur with the earlier judgment of S. R. Driver (Notes on the Hebrew Text and the Topography of the Books of Samuel, 2nd ed. [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1913], 112), that the LXX does not in feet agree with the bigger picture. Indeed the Israelites routed the Philistines con-vincingly that day (v. 31), and Yahweh's displeasure at the breaking of the oath is obvious from the failure of the divination because of sin in the camp (v. 37) and the condemning lot falling upon Jonathan as the guilty party (v. 42); see H. C. Brichto, The Problem of \"Curse\" in the Hebrew Bible, JBL Monograph Series 13 (Philadelphia: Society of Biblical Literature, 1963), 80. 14 The Hebrew אלה can have either sense. Cf. J. Scharbert, \"אלה,\" TDOT, 1.263. Brichto (The Problem of \"Curse\", 45ff.) argues for the latter meaning and understands that Saul merely pronounces a curse upon or \"adjures\" the army, as if he were standing outside the process and inflicting it on others. In the context of the parallels adduced in this paper, however, Scharbert is surely right when he says \"ויאל = er liess das Volk eine Selbstverfluchung sprechen\" (Biblica 39 [1958]: 4 η. 6). This may have taken the form of Saul articulating the curse for the entire community (including himself) and the rest responded with \"Amen,\" a common way of communal acceptance of an oath with its self-imprecation; see S. H. Blank, \"The Curse, Blasphemy, the Spell, and the Oath,\" HUCA 23.1 (1950-51): 89 nn. 53 and 54. 15 Hebrew עם like Greek λαός can bear that sense, which is certainly the mean-ing here. The Hebrew word is so used both for the various armies of the gentiles (Ex 14:6, 17:13; Num 21:33-35, etc.) and, as in our passage, for the hosts of Israel (Josh 10:7; IChron 11:13, 19:11, etc.). With regard to the latter, N. Lohfink examines the phrase עם ית־ה as \"army of Yahweh\" (Probleme biblischer Theolo-gie, éd. H. W. Wolff [München: Kaiser, 1971], 275-303 passim, esp. 281ff.). In general see Lipinski, \"עם,\" TWA Τ, 6.192; H. Strathmann, \"λαός,\" TDNT, 4.34. Similarly the early epic usage of Greek λαός (M. Schmidt, \"λαός,\" Lexikon des Frühgriechischen Epos, 14. Lieferung (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht, 1991), 1638-42; Strathmann, \"λαός,\" 30f.). 16 This is also the focus in certain vows which involve refusing to cut one's hair. E.g., Suet. Jul. 67.2; Tac. Hist. 4.61; Germ. 31; and cf. (although not in a"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Second, Saul, like Achilleus, is concerned with imposing the absten-tion vow on the entire community which, unlike the Achaian hero, he can mandate as king and commander of the troops. Jonathan in the biblical narrative corresponds to Odysseus as the voice of reason; both question the wisdom of renouncing food and drink in the case of soldiers who fight more effectively with nourishment (cf. w. 29-30 with //. 19.160-72).18 The communal abstinence is not simply \"a grandiose gesture of self-denial\" to secure the favor of Yahweh, as P. K. McCarter says.19 Neither the Greek nor the Hebrew warrior undertake the fast in the context of prayer to a deity, or asking a deity's favor. Rather, they both engage in an act of self-cursing or communal self-cursing in which divine names are not mentioned. This will be discussed in greater detail below. Suffice it for now to say that Saul's vow, as Achilleus', effects a solemnizing and empowering of a stated goal by declaring oneself bound to abstinence, an accursed state, until that goal is accomplished. The biblical account differs from the Homeric in the aspect of an impending curse if the vow is not fulfilled, an idea not explicit in Homer, but which appears in a New Testament example of the issar, to which we now turn. Acts 23:12 reads as follows: οι Ίουδοάοι άνεθεμάτισαν εαυτούς λέγοντες μήτε φαγάν μήτε πιάν εως ού άποκτείνωσιν τόν Παυλον, \"The Jews put themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they killed Paul.\"20 The verb which I translate \"put themselves under a curse,\" άναθεματίζειν, is rare in pagan magical texts; I find it only in Audollent 41a.5, 8 (defixio military context) Acts 18:18, with Jeremias, Die Abendmahlsworte Jesu, 205 (Engl, trans., 214). \" On the topos of sundown as the time of breaking the fast, cf. Arbesmann, Das Fasten, 78f.; Westermarck, \"The Principles of Fasting,\" 399. 18 The Achilleus-Saul and the Odysseus-Jonathan correspondence in these two passages (and in some respects in general) is fascinating from a number of angles. The former pair have in common a brooding demeanor which is unpleasing and causes them to pale in comparison with the reasonableness and likableness of the latter two. Achilleus and Saul both experience vindication through divine acts and signs, which does not, however, mitigate the frustration and ill destiny which hovers over them and all of their accomplishments. 19 I Samuel, 249. 20 V. 14 relates their own words, in which the vow element is more emphatic: άναθέματι άνεθεματίσαμεν έαυτούς μηδενός γεύσασθοα κτλ., \"We solemnly impre-cated ourselves to taste nothing \" V. 21 gives another version and says that this band numbered over 40."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"from Megara, c.

The verb belongs chiefly to Greek-speaking Judaism and Christianity as translations of the Hebrew ,חרםi.e., to dedicate to God in the sense of bringing under the divine curse or ban.22 In our passage it means \"a curse in the sense of a vow or solemn obligation, the breach of which will bring them under the ban.\"23 The proper understanding of this passage is that \"the Jews pronounce themselves anathema (i.e., under the ban) //they eat or drink until they kill Paul.\"24 The vow of abstinence solemnizes and empowers their commitment to their task. Thus the perspective here is practically identical with that in 1 Samuel.25 21 A. Audollent, Defixionum Tabellae (Paris: Fontemoing, 1904). 22 N. Lohfink, \"חרם,\" TDOT, 5.180-203. The LXX renders the hrm word group most often (about 35 times) with άνάθημα/άνάθεμα (for,)חרם άναθεματίζην (החרים); other renderings are less frequent; cf also F. Blass, Acta Apostolorum editio philologica [Göttingen, 1895], 244). In classical Greek this word family had a long history of describing things dedicated to the gods, in that άνάθημα/άνάθεμα and άνατιθένοα are well established terms for votive offerings which filled pagan temples. Similar ideas were utilized in pagan magic, in that the magical act of cursing and sometimes the tablet itself on which the curse is recorded are spoken of in terms of a votive offering or object (cf. άνιεροΰν and άνατιθένοα in the family of defixiones from Cnidos, Audollent 1-13). Words such as παρακαταθήκη and παρακατατίθημι are also shared by the language of votive offerings and of magic for depositing things with the gods (cf. Rouse, Greek Votive Offerings, 324; Martinez, P. Mich. 757, 36-37). The LXX and early Christian usage of the άναθε- group is best described as a particular application of a religious/magical terminology well documented in pagan texts (in general see Rouse, Greek Votive Offerings, 323-24, 337-41; J. Behm, \"ανάθεμα κτλ.,\" TDNT, 1.354f.). 23 J. Behm, \"άναθεματίζω, κτλ.,\" TDNT, 1.355f. 24 Their failure to do so does not necessarily imply that they starved. Rab-binic treatises made provision for annulling vows on such occasions. See H. L. Strack and P. Billerbeck, Kommentar zum Neuen Testament aus Talmud und Midrasch (München: Beck, 1924), 2.767. 25TheàvaO- words are used for self-binding or self-imprecation elsewhere in the NT. In Rom 9:3 Paul asserts, ηϋχόμην γάρ άνάθεμα ávca αυτός έγώ άπό τοΰ Χριστού υπέρ τών άδελφών μου ... κατά σάρκα, \"For I could wish myself to be a thing devoted apart from Christ for the sake of my brethren according to the flesh.\" In pronouncing himself devoted from a beneficial deity for the benefit of someone else, Paul intentionally reverses the normal magical formula of pronouncing another devoted to a baleful deity for one's own benefit (cf. Audollent 4A.1f. and Paul's own negative but ultimately redemptive formulae in I Cor 5:5 and I Tim 1:20). The apostle also includes himself in the άνάθεμα which he pronounces in Gal l:8f. on any who preach a different gospel. On Mk 14:71, ήρξατο άναθεμα-τΐζειν κοά όμνύνοα, \"(Peter) began to curse and swear,\" J. Behm ('άναθεματίζω, κτλ.\" 355) remarks, \"άναθεματίζειν is intentionally left without an object to denote both that he curses himself if he lies and also the people if they make out that he is a disciple.\" Cf. also Enoch 6:4, which is similar in format to the issar:"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"The issar could entail abstention from many things besides food and drink. It could include the renunciation of only certain kinds of food, certain kinds of clothing, sleep, sex, speaking, bathing, cutting hair, business dealings, entry into a house or town— anything which, like fasting, produces isolation from normal society.26 A Hebrew psalmist prays (Ps 132.1-5), \"Remember, Ο Lord, in David's favor, all the hardships he endured; how he swore to the Lord and vowed to the mighty one of Jacob, '1 will not enter my house or get into my bed; I will not give sleep to my eyes nor slumber to my eyelids, until I find a place for the Lord, a dwelling place for the mighty one of Jacob.'\"27 *  *  *  In light of the foregoing examples, I offer the following gener-alizations concerning the nature and religious significance of self-actualizing issar, many of which also apply to the subsequent discussion of the \"agonistic\" type. I begin by comparing it with two acts of religious devotion with which it has much in common, fasting and oath-taking. Abstinence from food and drink28 never gained general impor-tance as a cultic act or pious exercise in Greek and Roman religion, occuring only in a limited number of contexts.29 Nor was it vital in ancient Egyptian religion.30 It played a more important role in Judaism, Christianity, and Greco-Oriental mystery religions.31 In most of its cultural expressions some common themes emerge, the most prominent being isolation.

Fasting, therefore, by nature is usually an ancillary discipline, which assists or empowers some other religious exercise. The isolation of fasting often constitutes a necessary purifying process for experiences of divine encounter and disclosure.32 It characterizes the spiritual discipline of shaman figures such as Abaris and Pythagoras.33 Prophets and prophetesses of Greek oracular shrines abstain prior to their divine visitations.34 Moses fasts \"forty days and nights\" before receiving the Ten Command-ments,35 as does Jesus before his testing in the wilderness.36 Thus from the perspective of Greek religion, fasting ritualizes the self-emptying, or ekstasis, which is concurrent with the state of divine possession, or enthousiasmos.

The prophets of the oracle of Apollo at Clarus and the priestess of the same god's oracle of the Branchidae at Didyma fast one and three days respectively (Iamb. myst. 3.11 [125.15, 127.15]). For fasting in preparation for dream oracles, cf Philostr. vit. Αρ. 2.37, vol. 1 p. 79,20ff. Kayser (Amphiarios) and Strabo 14.44 (Pluto and Kore at Nysa). Closely related to fasting for mantic revelation is the use of fasting in magic of the Roman and Byzantine periods; typically, however, one must abstain only from certain foods: \"I adjure you ... not to eat swine flesh, and every kind of spirit and daimon will be subject to you,\" PGM IV 3078-81; cf Arbesmann, Das Fasten, 63-67, and Ziehen, \"νηστεία,\" 94. 35 Ex 34:28; Deut 9:9.

His rejection of food and drink is an aspect of his obsession and self-devotion to his task, which borders on a kind of μανία.38 Yet, Athene's divine infusion notwithstand-ing, no real enthousiasmos accompanies this ekstasis. Achilleus' pledge of abstinence makes no pious claim to divine presence or possession.39 Like the Jewish άναθεματίζειν, his words betray the bleaker image of a man under a curse. There is, however, a kind of manic possession here, borne of the ανάγκη, \"necessity,\" which he imposes upon himself. His pledge of abstinence both consecrates him to his task and, by way of self-cursing, leaves him no choice but to accomplish it. As fasting clarifies the former aspect, the oath assists our understanding of the latter. One who takes an oath does so under the threat of a self-imposed curse. In the the Iliad 3.298-300, the Achaians and Tro-jans, while pouring libations, finalize their oaths swom on the occasion of the duel between Menelaos and Paris with the follow-ing: Ζεΰ κύδιστε μέγιστε, κοά αθάνατοι θεοι άλλοι όππότεροι πρότεροι ύπερ ορκια πημήνειαν, ώδε σφ' εγκέφαλος χαμάδις ρέοι ώς οδε οίνος. from food for the entire day and night, and secludes himself in sanctuaries inac-cesible to the crowd as he begins to be divinely possessed, and through sépara-tion and rehef from human affairs he makes himself undefiled for the reception of the god.\" Cf. also R. Parker, Miasma (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1983), 365. 38 The warrior, like the prophet, is sometimes described as one possessed: \"But he (sc. Diomedes) vehemently rages (μαΐνετοα), and no one can rival him in might\" (Horn. II. 6.100f.; cf. the 0da προθυμία of the mercenaries in Xen. Hell. 7.2.21). In Plato's Symposium Phaedrus employs this language in arguing that ideally the spirit which inspires the warrior is eros for his lover, by whose side he fights on the battle-field: οϋδεις ούτω κακός όντινα ούκ άν αυτός ό \"Ερως ενθεον ποιήσαε πρός άρετήν, ώστε δμοιον Λνοα τφ άρίστφ φύσει· κοά άτεχνώς, δ &)>η \"Ομηρος, \"μένος έμπνεΰσαι\" ένίοις τών ήρώων τόν θεόν, τούτο ό \"Ερως τοίς έρώσι παρέχει γιγνόμενον παρ' αύτοΰ, \"No one is so cowardly that Eros by himself could not inspire to excellence, so that he is like one who is brave by nature. And most assuredly this, as Homer says, that a god 'breathes might' into some heroes, is what Eros provides for lovers, seeing that he is the origin of it (179a-b). 39 This is true for Homer himself. Later Greeks, such as Phaidros (Sym. 179e-180b), viewed the relationship between Achilleus and Patroklos as homosexual, and thus the μανία which empowers Achilleus at this point is that of έρως. In this context, Achilleus' abstinence could be understood as a farm of love-sickness (on which see below)."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"\"Zeus, illustrious, greatest, and you other immortal gods, whoever are first to attack in violation of the oaths, may their brains be spilled on the ground as this wine.\" In the oath, persons or groups pronounce themselves accursed if the commitment is not fulfilled. In the issar they bind themselves to a vow of abstinence, which itself may be viewed as a kind of curse, until a goal is fulfilled. The oath-taker enforces a curse upon himself, if by his actions he brings about accursed circumstances; his state will parallel the evil he causes. The issar, however, pre-sûmes the existence of an accursed state of affairs in the present; for Achilleus, Patroclos' death unavenged; for Saul, incomplete revenge against the Philistines; for the Jewish conspirators, Paul's evangelism. In refusing what is most normal, the vow-taker pro-tests the abnormality of the current situation and by abstaining makes himself parallel to the state of dearth which surrounds him, a situation which will only be righted by a decisive action to which he consecrates himself. Thus, the fasting of the issar is both self-imprecating and self-dedicating, in the same way as Hebrew חרם and its Greek equivalent αναθεματίζει ν tread the tenuous boundary between \"consecrate\" and \"curse.\" To put it differently, both oath and issar involve a kind of self-cursing. The oath projects the curse entirely in the future and conditions it upon failing to accomplish the stated commitment, a failure which will bring about evil circumstances. The issar may include a non-specific future curse, but the differentiating factor is the pledge to abstain, which existentializes the curse and makes it a present experience to parallel the present evil, until some redemp-tive goal is accomplished. As in the previously cited Iliad 3.298ff., the oath often in-volves direct appeals to deities. God or gods are invoked to witness the terms and, if need be, enforce the imprecations.40 The up-holding of oaths is the provenance of the supreme deity in both ancient Greece and Israel.41 Other curse formulae connected with 40 J.

The Torah mandates that oaths be taken by Yahweh alone (Deut 6:13; 10:20). The process of taking an oath itself was a solemn affirmation of Yahweh as the \"one God.\" See J. Schneider, \"δρκος,\" TDNT, 5.459."},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"oaths operate independently of invocations to gods.42 Such is the case for many oaths which are based on sympathetic rituals, such as the following lines from a marble stele which preserves a late seventh-century BCE text concerning oaths taken by the founders of Libyan Cyrene: κηρίνος πλάσσαντες κολοσός κατέκοαον έπαρεώμενοι πάντες συνενθόντες ... · τόμ μή εμμένοντα τούτοις τοις όρκίοις άλλά παρβεώντα καταλείβεσθαί ναν κοά καταρρεν ώσπερ τός κολοσός κοά αύτόν κοά γόνον και χρήματα (44-49). They all came together and, making wax effigies,43 burned them, pro-nouncing grave imprecations, .. . that he who does not abide by these oaths but transgresses them melt and be consumed as the effigies, he and his offspring and his property.44 Such sympathetic formulae function without prayer, not because divine power is absent, but because the words and the sympathetic procedures themselves suffice to activate the realm in which divine power operates.45 Indeed, such curse formulae, much like voces 42 F. Büchsei, \"κατάρα,\" TDNT, 1.449. In the Hebrew Bible, S. H. Blank (\"The Curse,\" 73-82) notes that there are abundant examples both of curse formulae which do not mention God and which derive power through the spoken word alone, and curses which seek to enlist the help of Yahweh in fulfilling them, i.e., imprecatory prayers. 43 For this meaning of κολοσσός, cf. Faraone, CA 10 (1991): 183 η. 65. 44 SE G IX 3 = R. Meigg and D. Lewis, A Selection of Greek Historical In-scriptions, rev. ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988), 5, pp. 5-9 with addendum.

Cf. also A. S. Gow's commentary on Theocritus 2.28, 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1952), 2.44. It is impossible to prove that the fam of the oath curse with-out prayer or invocation of the gods was \"older\" or \"original\" as some scholars have suggested (W. Speyer, \"Fluch,\" RAC, 7.1202; cf. Nilsson, Geschichte, 1.802f.). As our evidence stands the two forms were concurrent. Nor can it be said that the prayerless kind of cursing belongs to the realm of magic but cursing with prayer belongs to the realm of religion. This contention presupposes a dichotomy between the two which the evidence does not support. See in general Faraone, \"The Agonistic Context,\" 4-10, 17-20; C. R. Phillips, \"The Sociology of Relig-ious Knowledge in the Roman Empire to AD 284,\" ANRW, 2.16.3 (1986), 2711-32; Faraone, \"Molten Wax,\" 76-78. 45 Cf. also the curse pronounced by Teucher in Soph.

Similarly, most of the cases of the issar cited above make no direct appeal, nor even reference to deities.46 Many issarim, like many oaths, belong within this ancient tradi-tion of prayerless cursing or self-cursing. Although often they do not directly address deities, abstention vows could be used to exert pressure on gods, God, or others in authority. This brings us to the second distinctive issar type. *  #  *  The \"agonistic\" issar displays a paradoxical transference. In a way similar to the self-actualizing vow, one pledges to abstain, but the actual ανάγκη falls on another. Through abstinence the vow-taker commits to a goal, but at the same time enters into an ago-nistic relationship with another, usually one who is in some posi-tion of authority, and pressures him to supply the means of achieving the goal. This form occurs frequently in the context of business dealings or contractual arrangements. We may take as a case in point a passage from the apocryphal book of Tobit. Raguel has just promised his daughter to Tobias in marriage and asserts that she is rightfully his. He then urges Tobias to sit down and partake of the fare set before him. His guest responds with the following vow: Ού μή φάγω εντεύθεν ούδε μή πιω, \"έως αν δι-αστήσης τά προς έμέ, \"I will neither eat thereof nor drink, until you settle my affairs\" (7:12; א recension, 250/175 BCE47). He refuses to eat or drink until marriage plans are finalized. The issar displays Tobias' resolution and demands action from another party in the context of a mutual agreement.48 oath without citing the ipsissima verba, we cannot be certain of the exact for-mula. 46 Ps 132:1-5 (cited above) is an exception. 47 BA says οΰ γεύσομαι ουδέν ώδε, 'έως άν στήσητε κοΛ σταθήτε πρός με. 48 The use of such vow formulations in the contexts of exerting pressure and invoking action range from the solemn and urgent, such as those above and that of the Demeter hymn below, to the most mudane and frivolous. With regard to the latter type, numerous rabbinical examples are collected by Jeremias, Die Abend-mahlsworte Jesu, 205f. (Eng., 213); cf. the trivializing use of oaths in later Judaism, against which Sir 23:9ff. complains (J. Schneider, \"όρκος,\" TDNT, 5.461). Outside of Judaism, cf. a papyrus letter to a father in which his son de-mands that he send him a lyre, and warns, άμ μή πέμψης οϋ μή φά/ω, ού μή πείνω· ταύτα, \"If you do not send it, I will never eat, I will never drink. So there!\" (P. Oxy. 1119.13ff.)."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"The myth of Demeter offers some interesting variations on these themes. The author of her Homeric Hymn describes her rejection of Zeus' invitation (via Iris) to return to Olympus: ού μεν γάρ ποτ* εφασκε θυώδεος Ούλύμποιο πρίν γ* επιβήσεσθοα, ού πριν γης καρπόν άνησειν πριν ΐδοι όφθοΛμοισιν έήν εύώπιδα κούρην (331-33). For she claimed that she would never set foot on fragrant Olympus, nor let spring up earth's fruit, until she saw with her eyes her fair daughter. These lines underscore two important issar motifs: first, Deme-ter, like David in the Psalm, swears not to go home until she realizes her goal.49 She isolates herself to her commitment, which is the primary motif of the act of abstinence, regardless of what form it takes. Just as important, however, is the second part of her vow. Earlier in the narrative we learn that Demeter, upon discov-ering that her daughter had been abducted and given in marriage 10 Hades by Zeus, roams the earth fasting, mourning her daughter's absence, until cheered by the maidservant Iambe, she finally ends her fast by drinking the kykeon. Her comfort, however, does not last long. Soon after the princes of Eleusis build her great temple, she again begins to mourn, and I believe, although it is not explic-itly stated, to fast. In the lines cited above we learn that, as Achilleus sought to impose his fasting upon the Achaians and king Saul upon the hosts of Israel, she incorporates the larger commu-nity of the human race into her abstinence. The focus of both her refüsal to return home and the imposed fasting is not merely mourning; it sounds two important themes which we have previ-ously seen in these vows, namely, desire for vengeance and invok-ing of action, in this case against Zeus and from Zeus. By imposing the curse of not eating upon the human race, she threatens Zeus with its extinction and the resultant loss of the honors of the cult.50 Demeter, like Tobias, forces the authority in question to do business with her and ultimately to allow Persephone to return. 49 Cf. Horn. Od. 5.177-79; when Kalypso invites Odysseus to build a raft and promises good provisions and fair wind for his journey home, he vows, οϋδ' &׳ έγών άέκητι σέθεν σχεδίης σαβοάην, d μή μοι τλοάης γε, θεά, μέγαν δρκον όμόσσοα μή τί μοι αύτφ πημα κακόν βουλευσέμεν 8λλο, \"Without your good will I have no intention of setting foot on a raft, unless, goddess, you can bring yourself to swear me a great oath that you will not devise some other evil mischief against me. 50 See N.

Wilcken cites Porph. Epist. ad Aneb. 29, where the Neoplatonist expresses amazement at this practice as a peculiarity of Egyptian religion. There are, how-ever, Greek, Roman, and even Christian parallels; cf. H. Bell, \"Popular Religion in Egypt,\"JEA 34 (1948): 96; H. S.

Preisigke s.v. suggests \"den Sohn ausrüsten\" (i.e., equip him for [the Jewish] war). E. G. Turner renders simply, \"see him through\" (CR 11 [1961]: 226). The best sense is given by Wilcken's suggestion \"ganz erhalte (d.h. heil aus dem Kriege zurückbekomme)\"; similarly Versnel's \"unless I have my son back in good health\" (\"Religious Mentality,\" 41 n. 168). Antikleia's description of Laertes refusing to sleep in his bed or wear decent clothing for as long as Odysseus was absent implies that he took a vow similar to that of Derne-ter and Eudaimonis (Horn. Od. 11.187-96). 54 Jeremias and others before him have interpreted the following sayings as issarim or as within the issar tradition (Die Abendmahlsworte Jesu, 199-210 [Eng. trans., 207-18]). In the later editions of his book he prefers the less techni-cal designation \"Versichterklärung\" to \"Entsagungsgelübde,\" since Jesus does not actually use precise Hebrew terminology for vowing (such as \"Corban\" in Mk 7:11). Jeremias also mentions that it is Luke who has positioned these two pledges to abstain correctly, that is, the first before the beginning of the meal and the second immediately following at the passing of the first cup, as opposed to Mark, who places a single pronouncement after the \"words of interpretation.\" For a critique of Jeremias' interpretation of this passage, see H. Patsch, Abendmahl"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"tively discussed \"eucharistie words\" of Jesus Christ are those ut-tered at Mk 14:25: άμήν λέγω ύμίν οτι ούκέτι ού μή πίω έκ του γενήματος της αμπέλου εως της ημέρας εκείνης όταν αύτό πίνω καινόν έν τή βασιλείς* του θεού, \"Truly I say to you, that never more will I drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\" Compare with this the Lukan account: λέγω γαρ ύμίν οτι ού μή φάγω αύτό 'έως οτου πληρωθή έν τή βασιλείς τοΰ θεού. ... λέγω γαρ ύμίν, [ότι] ού μή πίω άπό του νυν άπό τοΰ γενήματος τής αμπέλου εως ού ή βασιλεία του θεού έλθη. \"For I say to you that I shall never eat it until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. ... For I say to you that from now on I shall never drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God come\" (Lk 22:16, 18). Phrases such as \"... until I drink it new in the kingdom,\" \". . . until it be fulfilled in the kingdom,\" \"... until the kingdom of God come,\" are surrogates for \".. . until God establishes his king-dom.\"55 Thus on one level Jesus' vow falls within the agonistic category, in that it invokes the action of another.56 Like Demeter and Eudaimonis, he displays earnest determination by withdrawing from the sacred community. In abstaining from the passover meal in general57 and the bread and wine of the first Christian eucharist in particular, he isolates himself from the most vital cultic activity both of the old covenant in which he participated for his entire life and the new covenant which he is initiating. Yet Jesus does not assume the same kind of threatening posture as the goddess and woman from Egypt. In fact, on another level Jesus consecrates himself to the necessary action, making himself the instrument through which God will establish the new order. und historischer Jesus, Theologische Monographien 1 (Stuttgart: Calwer, 1972), 131 ff. 55 On this point see Jeremias, Die Abendmahlsworte Jesu, 203 η. 3 (Eng. trans., 211 η. 5). Cf. in the Lord's Prayer, \"Let thy kingdom come\" (Mt 6:10, Lk 11:2). 56 Similarly a fragment from Gos. Heb. concerning James, the brother of Jesus (Hier, de viris illustribus, 2): iuraverat ... Jacobus se non comesurum panem .... donee videret eum resurgentem a dormientibus, \"James had sworn that he would not partake of bread, until he saw him risen from among those who slept\" (in general cf. Jeremias, Die Abendmahlsworte Jesu, 207 with η. 1 [Eng. trans., 215 with η. 4]). According to the account as it continues, the risen Jesus honored his vow by appearing to him first. 57 In the Lukan account, immediately before the vow, Jesus says, \"I eagerly longed to eat this passover with you\" (22:15)."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"The consecration is also a curse. Jesus' words accentuate the no-tions of irrevocabilty and isolation. He seals his absolute commit-ment to the apocalyptic age with the vow that he will not partake of the sacred bread and wine until that age is ushered in. By cutting himself off from the holy meal of the cult he begins a process which will culminate in the supreme anathema of the crucifixion.58 At the same time, however, by so extreme a display of determina-tion and commitment to the coming kingdom, he struggles with God and invokes divine action in establishing it, the initial stages of which will be inaugurated by his own death and resurrection. Also, in keeping with basic issar themes, Jesus is recognizing that until the new age comes, the present state of affairs is indeed an accursed one. By his abstinence he dramatizes that recognition by paralleling himself with the accursed state; at the same time he consecrates himself to the divine intervention which will end it.59 58 Jeremias continues to argue from the evidence of the early Christian passo-ver fast that another central reason for Jesus' abstinence was as an act of mortifica-tion and prayer for Israel (Die Abendmahlsworte Jesu, 208-10 = Eng. trans., 216-18). But, the self-dedicating/imprecating nature of the abstention vow is in itself a sufficiently strong tradition to define what Jesus is doing without recourse to later developments within the Christian community. Nothing need soften the blow that Jesus is with these words surrendering himself to an accursed state. 59 For all that these texts are culturally and chronologically diverse, a similar linguistic profile emerges, providing that we take into account the different means by which the Greek language expresses similar ideas at different stages in its development. The pledge to abstain is couched in terms of solemn and emphatic denial, which in the older epic language takes the form of the optative (+ &׳) with (compounded or) intense negation (πριν 8 οϋ πως δν ... 'ιέΐη ... ού πόσις ουδέ βρώσις II . 19.209f.; ούδ׳& ׳ ... άέκητι σέθεν ... έπιβοάην, Od. 5.177), which is further heightened by the intensive έγώ / £γωγε. For this usage of the optative see R. Kühner and B. Gerth, Ausführliche Grammatik der griechischen Sprache, 2 vols. (Hannover/Leipzig, 1898, 1904), 1.233; Schwyzer, Griechische Gram-matik, 2.324; Jebb on Soph. OT 343; and esp. Slotty, Der Gebrauch des Kon-junktivs und Optativs, 132f. (Homer), 143 (Attic); cf. also 93-99. In the koine examples which are related in direct speech (Tobit 7:12; Mk 14:25; Lk 22:16, 18; P. Oxy. I 119.13ff.), the dominant formula is the emphatic ού μή φάγω ού(δέ) μή πίω. This idiom is classical (Kühner-Gerth, op. cit., 2.221-23; Schwyzer, op. cit., 2.317. For the origin of the construction see N. Turner, Grammar of New Testa-ment Greek, vol. 3, Syntax [Edinburgh: T. & T. Clark, 1963], 96; esp. W. W. Goodwin, Syntax of Greek Moods and Tenses [New York: St. Martin's, 1889], 389ff.).

In the self-actualizing type both abstinence and ανάγκη belong to the vow-taker. In the ago-nistic vow, he imposes abstinence on himself, necessity on an-other. In Greek erotic magic of the Roman and Byzantine periods, the operator of the spell inflicts both abstinence and άνάγκη on another, namely, the beloved whom he seeks.

Jannaris, An Historical Greek Grammar (London: MacMillan, 1897), 555. In all of the examples the grammar establishes a clear delineation between two time frames: that in which the abstinence will occur and the accomplishment of the goal which will terminate the vow and the abstinence. These two periods are cast in sharper relief by various intensive expressions (πρίν 7 ... ץtp\\v ... πρίν, h.

Put simply, it is the operator who in reality is bound in hopeless passion, an illness which has robbed him of sleep and taken away his will to eat and drink. It has in effect alienated him from all meaningful human 64 Corpus Medicorum Graecorum 5.9.2, ed. Diels, 207.

Cf. also Galen's famous description of the woman who was sick with love for the dancer Pylades (Prog. VI 2ff, Corpus Medicorum Graecorum 5.8.1, ed. V. Nutton, 100-04). Many texts include fevered frenzy (πυρουμένη) among the symptoms (cf P.

In matters of eros, however, some ancient minds do not make a sharp division between the two. Euripides in the Hippolytos saw the relationship between the ab-stinence of love sickness and the fasting of ritual isolation and purity. The chorus describes Phaedra's suffering as follows: τριτάταν δέ νιν κλύω | τάνδ' άβρωσιςί \\ στόματος άμέραν | Δάματρος άκτάς δέμας άγνόν ίσχειν | κρυπτφ πάθει, θανάτου θ έλουσαν | κέλσαι ποτι τέρμα δύστανον (135-40). 68 For love sickness leading to suicide and death, see Winkler, \"The Con-straints of Eros,\" 222. 69 As love sickness can cause the death of the lover, its transference can ulti-mately lead to the beloved's demise. See PGM IV 136-37, 2449-51, 2495; Winkler, \"The Constraints of Eros,\" 242 n. 105. In Theokritos' second poem Simaitha's magic gives Delphis the choice to knock again on her door (line 6) or on Hades' (160, and see A. S. Gow's commentary, 2.62). 70 Winkler (\"The Constraints of Eros,\" 240 n. 71) points out that the texts in which we get a glimpse of the lover's own torment are rare. He cites in this connection T. Köln inv. 1.78 (Suppl. Mag. I 49). Add also the magical hymn of PGM IV 1400ff., where the spell-operator invokes Hekate-Persephone along with those who have died untimely and violent deaths, όπως αυτόν καρπίσησθε βασάνοις έχόμενον ... άξατε ούν αυτήν βασαναζομένην, \"that you may prosper him who is possessed with torments, ... then bring her in a state of torment\" (1406-13). The importance of this magical role reversal/transference is not that it was the actual mindset of everyone who practiced erotic magic, but rather a romantic archetype which shaped the genre. 71 A remarkable non-erotic parallel for this kind of transference occurs in the headache spell of P. Berol. inv. 21243 ii.26ff. (Suppl. Mag. Π 72): \"Osiris has a headache, Ammon has a pain in the temples of his head, Esenephthys has a pain all over her head. Osiris will not stop having a headache, Ammon will not stop having a pain in the temples of his head, Esenephthys will not stop having a pain all over her head until first he, NN stops completely (?) ...\" (trans. Dan-iel/Maltomini). The operator here threatens that the invoked deities will suffer as he suffers until they cure him."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"And I hear that she for the third day now in fasting of mouth keeps her body pure from the grain of Demeter because of secret misery, longing to depart to the dreadful end of death.72 The poignancy of these lines consists in their play upon έκων and άκων. Euripides couches the involuntary affliction of love sickness in terms of a voluntary act of cultic observance. Phaedra is the unwilling victim of eros, but the loss of appetite associated with her disease is presented in the guise of a willing act of self-dedication and purification through fasting. This portrait mocks her desperation and άνάγκη, especially since the \"purity\" (άγνόν) of her \"fast\" mirrors the sexual purity of the one she desires, Hippolytos: λέχους γάρ àç τόδ' ήμερος àyvôv δέμας, \"To this moment my body is pure from marriage\" (1003).73 Thus, it is a short leap from love as a disease to love as a sacred disease, a form of divine possession and holy madness. Plato in Phaedrus 244aff. asserts that the lover, like the prophet and poet, was possessed by a god-infused μανία, which he calls θείος έρως (266a). It was precisely this understanding which the medical tradition of Hippocrates (as represented by Galen) resisted: μήτε ούν τήν έπιληψίαν οίώμεθα θείον áv0a νόσημα μήτε τον έρωτα* κοά γάρ κοά τοΰτόν τίνες ΰπολαμβάνοντες αληθή μεν έγραψαν ίστορίαν, ώς 'Ερασίστρατος έφωρασε δι' έρωτα τόν του βασιλέως άρρωστοΰντα υίόν, θείον δε ούκ έδίδαξαν οΰθ' υπό 'Ερασιστράτου καλούμενον ουθ' υπό 'Ιπποκράτους ούθ' ύπό άλλου τινός ιατρού τόν έρωτα (In Hipp. prog. 1.4.18). So let us not conceive of either epilepsy or love as a divine disease. For even some who actually believe this to be true have recorded that Erasis-tratos discovered that the son of the king was love sick, but they did not 72 On the entire passage and its difficulties, see W.

In general, the word group describes holiness connected with abstinence or avoidance; cf Hipp. 315-16; Pia. Leg. 6.759c; Jos. Ap. 2.198; F.

The opposite was also expressed paradigmatically; in Theok. 2.45-46 Samaitha prays, \"(Whoever he may be with,) let him forget them, as, they say, in Dia Theseus once forgot lovely-tressed Ariadne.\" 78 In Pia. Sym. 183a Pausanius characterizes the social behaviour which is permissible only for a lover as follows: 'ικετείας te κοά άντιβολήσεις έν toâç δεήσεσιν ποιούμενοι, K0à όρκους όμνύντες, κοά κοιμήσεις bà θύραις, κοά έθέλοντες δουλείας δουλεύειν οίας ούδ' άν δούλος ουδείς, \"Making supplications and prayers in their entreaties, and swearing oaths, and sleeping at his doors, and willingly performing acts of servitude, the likes of which not even a slave would do.\" It i s no accident that such language also characterizes earnest religious devotion (see Bauer/Aland, Wörterbuch zum Neuen Test., s.w. δέησις, δουλεύω 2b)."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters and even his own life as well, he cannot be my disciple.79 Compare the Lukan saying with P.

Make her ... leave father and mother and brothers and sisters, until she come to me, ... loving me with an unceasing god-like love and frenzied devotion.80 When the curse not to eat or drink is viewed in this context, it assumes an expanded meaning, not only as the loss of appetite associated with love sickness, but also as an enforced purifying fast which accompanies an enforced state of possession. What the mantis (in preparation for prophecy) and the vow-taker undertake willingly, the user of love magic inflicts upon the beloved against her will. The result is the same: isolation from the land of the living. Thus the \"neither eat not drink\" prescriptions in the con-text of magically induced θείος έρως straddle the same tenuous boundary between isolating consecration and isolating imprecation as they do in the abstention vows. That disturbing semantic du-plicity of Hebrew hrm (Greek άνάθεμα) of \"consecrate\" and \"curse\" apply to both applications of the formulae. If there is a bright spot in this picture, it is that this isolation which erotic magic enforces, like that of the vow, is temporary.

In magic the issue of time looms large. The linguistic format of both love spells and abstention vows creates a kind of temporal bracketing: \"I will not ... until,\" \"may she not ... until.\" If the desired result is not procured within this framework, the implica-tion is the destruction of the vow-taker or the beloved. Safety and normalcy abide on either side of the brackets. Within them is a threatening state of liminality, a no-man's land between well-being and destruction, life and death.83 It is no wonder that love spells often climax with ήδη ήδη ταχύ ταχύ, \"Now, now, quickly, quickly.\" For the beloved, as with the vow-taker, time is running out. 81 Cf.

In this context the temporality of the \"neither eat nor drink until\" phrases is somewhat illusory. The implied threat, that the only factor which secures the beloved from a new onslaught of the disease is the presence of the lover, may indicate that the \"binding finality\" formulae create a kind of hedge about the Ιρως θείος and insure that it will indeed be \"for the rest of her life.\" 83 Similar, although not identical, is the state of P.

Finally, in line 40, his exasperated mother says to him, \"I will not take you with me, child. Mormo, the horse, bites!\" (ούκ άξώ τυ, τέκνον. Μορμώ δάκνει ίππος). The reference to Mormo is intended to scare the child into quieting down. The scholiast on the passage implies that the mother is reminding the child that demons such as Mormo lurk outside in the dark; another scholiast explains that Mormo was the name of a phasma who killed children.2 In this essay, I will discuss not magic per se, but rather the na-ture of the beast against whom magic was directed—or at least, the nature of one beast: the child-killing demon.3 I will react in par-ticular to the works of two other scholars.

Need we seek them there? The second work is Jonathan Z. Smith's 1978 article \"Towards Interpreting Demonic Powers in Hellenistic and Roman Antiq-uity.\"5 Smith suggested that the scholarly quest for the \"roots\" of Greek demonology among other cultures, including those of the Near East, was misguided; in fact, he noted, it placed scholars in the same situation as the ancient Greeks themselves, who sought to explain away anything dark or mysterious within their culture as having been borrowed from the Persians, Egyptians, Chaldeans, et cetera—as being anything but \"Greek.\" Smith suggested that our energies would be better spent examining how Greek and Roman demonological beliefs functioned within those cultures themselves. In particular, he developed the precepts set forth by Mary Douglas in Purity and Danger by arguing that the demonic frequently serves as a classificatory marker that is part of a larger system of boundaries used to express or reinforce a society's values. Smith sees this as working in one of two ways: \"negative valence is attached to things which escape place (the chaotic, the rebellious, the distant) or things found just outside the place where they properly belong (the hybrid, the deviant, the adjacent).\" He goes on to note that: The most frequent form of demons is that of a hybrid or monster, a pro-tean figure capable of a range of transformations or as a being with super-fluous parts. ... the demonic is frequently characterized by the extremes of being either hard and cold (e.g., Satan's penis which is often described in witchcraft literature as being made of horn or iron and icy to the touch) or squishy and rotten (i.e., overheated). ... To translate this range: de-mons are perceived as being either overdefined or underdetermined. De-mons serve as classificatory markers which signal what is strong and weak, controlled and exaggerated in a given society at a given moment. Smith's suggestions apply well to the study of demons in general. Before we consider the Greek child-killing demons, however, I 4 W. Burkert, The Orientalizing Revolution, trans. Margaret E.

Very frequently, the \"displacement\" of the demonic takes the form of liminality. That is, the demon is not merely outside of any single, given taxon, but situated squarely between two taxa that are considered to be mutually exclusive; the hybrid nature of demons, noted by Smith, is a form of this. The werewolf is a good example: it is far more frightening than either a normal wolf or a normal man would be precisely because it fails to adhere to the taxon either of \"human\" or of \"animal.\" Such juxtapositions of animal and human are disconcerting because they suggest that one of the organizational grids that culture has imposed on the world is liable to flux. (On another level, such hybrids also are frightening because they typically possess the threatening characteristics of both their components: e.g., the wits of a man and the savagery of the wolf.) The common belief that the doorway is a gathering place for demons also expresses the liminal status of the demonic, for the threshold is neither inside nor outside of the house, it belongs to neither the interior sphere nor that of the outside world; cross-roads—the interstices between three or four roads—also are de-mo nie in many cultures.6 Shape-shifting, a common demonic talent, is a diachronic form of hybridism: the demon does not display the traits of two or more taxa simultaneously, but his ability to change from human to horse to fire to tiger, et cetera, nonetheless prevents his secure categorization. In challenging established taxa, of course, the association be-tween liminality and the demonic helps to uphold those taxa by suggesting that anything falling between them is dangerous and must be avoided. Another way in which the demonic can chal-lenge—and thus implicitly uphold—established taxa is by serving as a concave mirror for the human world, a mirror in which perfect inversions of behavioral or physical desiderata are held up to view.7 In this paradigm, \"normal\" demonic behavior = abnormal human behavior. The worldwide tendency to portray witches and demons as indulging in incest and cannibalistic feasts is a good example of this. Such tales send the message that any individual 6See S. I. Johnston, \"Crossroads,\" Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epi-graphik 88 (1991): 217-24. ׳This idea has been explored by some anthropologists, notably Rodney Needham (Primordial Characters [Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 1978], 23-50)."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"who wishes to retain membership within the human race—i.e., anyone who does not wish to be classed a demon or witch—must adhere to the established standards of behavior and appearance. Often, an item, a person or a mode of behavior first is con-demned as demonic because it aligns with one of these two para-digms of exclusion (it is either liminal or inverted), but subse-quently, folk belief elaborates, adding to that item, person or mode of behavior qualities of the other paradigm. One of the simplest examples of this tendency already has been mentioned: demons, who by definition delight in harming people (and who thereby invert the rules of civilized human conduct), often are imagined to manifest themselves in physical forms that are liminal insofar as they are hybrid—the traditional picture of Satan, we recall, is that of a man with goat's horns, feet and tail. Herzfeld, in an article on contemporary rural Greek superstitions, gives an example of the opposite development, whereby a person who inverted one of the structures that underlay his society was suspected of having de-monic powers. A man who refused to reciprocate coffee-house hospitality and who, instead, spent his time talking with tourists (in other words, a man who transgressed the boundaries of his group, preferring the things that were \"outside\" to those that were \"inside\"), was accused of having the \"evil eye\" (a desire and ability to harm the innocent).8 Secondary expressions of either form of displacement—liminality or inversion—can be added to a demonic figure ad infinitum, each one moving it further and further from established norms and, thus, further and further condemning the behavior that made it demonic in the first place. The European tales of witches' sabbats that grew up during the thirteenth to seventeenth centuries are full of inventive examples: not only are the witches incestuous cannibals, but they walk on their hands, eat salt to quench their thirst, easily change themselves into animals to accomplish their ends, and dance back-to-back instead of face-to-face. Having reviewed two ways of approaching the study of Greek demonology—Burkert's quest for Near Eastern precedents and Smith's attention to the way in which the demons functioned within a culture—we can now proceed to examine the Greek child-killing demon. Of course, Burkert's and Smith's methods need not be mutually exclusive. We should consider the possibility that some features of the Greek child-killer were borrowed from elsewhere in 8 M. Herzfeld, \"Meaning and Morality: A Semiotic Approach to Evil Eye Ac-cusations in a Greek Village,\" American Ethnologist 8.3 (1981): 560-74."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"the Mediterranean basin, but must we keep in mind that the recog-nition of such borrowings would become useful only if we took the further step of explaining how they upheld or toppled existing Greek taxonomies and beliefs. Until the question of why something was borrowed has been answered, we have advanced the discussion very little—constructing a genealogy is only the first step in understanding the peculiar quirks expressed by individual members within the Mediterranean family of religious beliefs. Sometimes when we ask the question \"why,\" moreover, we may discover that what looked like a genealogical relationship need not have been one at all; upon deeper analysis we may discover that conditions within the Greek culture made the indigenous birth of a belief completely possible. I have mentioned already the three most common names for Greek child-killing demons: Mormo, Lamia and Gello. These names, and their plurals (mormones, lamiai, gelloudes), can be used as common nouns, but as personal names they designate mythologically crystallized representatives of groups of demons.9 Empousa (empousai) is another female demon often connected with these others by modern scholars, although, as I will discuss below, Empousa's role as a child-killing demon probably was slight and secondary to other aspects of her nature; her name is con-nected with attacks on children only twice and then only indi-rectly.10 There is one more type of child-killing demon, whose name usually occurs in the plural, although it can be found occa-sionally in the singular: the strix or striges. It is likely that \"strix\" was originally a Roman name for the child-killing demon, which 9\"Mormo\" developed in ways that \"lamia\" and \"gello\" did not. First, the word \"mormo\" gave rise to a variation: \"mormolukê\" or \"mormolukia\" The word for \"wolf' is present here; thus, we picture a sort of female werewolf (see further below). From \"mormolukê\" came \"mormolukeion.\" This is used once by Lucian to refer to a monster (Philops. 23.5), but normally had the meaning of \"mask\"; cf. the development of \"gorgoneios\" from \"gorgo.\" Some ancient sources connect \"mormolukeion\" specifically with theatrical masks (e.g., Ar. frg. 31 Edmonds). 10 Gello is called an \"eidolon of Empousa\" at Hsch. s.v. \"Γελλώ\" (Γ 308), which would seem to mean that Gello and Empousa were equated in ancient thought or that Gello was understood to be a type of empousa. The author of the Vita Aeschines (vol. 3 Reisk, p. 10) says that Aeschines' mother \"was accus-tomed to rush out of dark places to frighten women and children, and was nick-named Empousa, therefore, because Empousa was a νυκτερινόν φάντασμα.\" (This may refer to Aeschines' mother's role in some mystery cult [C.

Gelloudes, and probably other child-killers, too, were blamed for the deaths of pregnant women and their fetuses as well as for the deaths of children. The combination is logical, and is found in association with child-killing demons throughout both the ancient and the modem worlds: the demon who brings reproduction to an unhappy end at one point in the process does so at other points as well.12 Let us start with some very general observations about how the Greeks situated child-killing demons within their physical, moral and social kosmoi, and how the demons, in tum, reinforced the rules by which those kosmoi functioned. First, we can say that the ancient placement of the characters called Lamia, Gello and Mormo among the eidola, daimones and phantasmata—within the ghostly or demonic realm, in other words—in itself reinforced the standard Greek opinion as to what the proper role of a woman 11 The second-century CE grammarian Festus (Müller, p. 314) passes down a Greek iambic chant to avert the striges\\ he gives as his source the first-century BCE Verrius Flaccus.

Leo Allatius, de Graecorum hodie quorundam opinationibus epistola [Cologne: 1645], section 3). Some of the magical stones listed in the lithica of Damigeron-Evax are said to protect both infants and pregnant women, which suggests that the same type of demon was responsible for both (1 [aetite], 31 [lynguros], 33 [galactite]).

For other Mediterranean examples of this combination of functions, see the texts concerning Lamashtu collected by West, \"Gello\"; the comments of G.

The etiological myths about child-killing demons delimited the acceptable behavior of a Greek woman even more strictly, however. Zenobius, explaining a phrase used by Sappho, tells Gello's story: \"Fonder of children than Gello\" is a saying used of those who died pre-maturely, or of those who are fond of children but ruin them by their up-bringing. For Gello was a virgin, and because she died prematurely, the Lesbians say that her ghost haunts little children, and they attribute pre-mature deaths to her (Prov. 3.3 = Sapph. frg. 178 Campbell; Campbell's Loeb translation, slightly adapted). Lamia, in contrast, does not die a parthenos, but she similarly fails to reproduce and nurture successfully, because her children die early in life. A full, although euhemerizing, version of her story is given by Diodorus Siculus: At the base of this (Libyan mountain) was a large cave thickly covered with ivy and bryony, in which according to myth had been born Lamia, a queen of surpassing beauty. But on account of the savagery of her heart they say that the time that has elapsed since has transformed her face to a bestial aspect. For when all of the children that had been born to her had died, weighed down with her misfortune and envying the happiness cf other women in their children, she ordered that newborn babies be snatched away from their mothers' arms and straightaway slain. Where-fore, among us even down to the present generation, the story of this woman remains among the children and her name is most terrifying to them (Diod. Sic. 20.41, 3-5 [Geer's Loeb translation, slightly adapted]; cf. Duris ap. FGrH 76 F 17 = Phot, and Suid. s.v. Lamia and the ac-counts of schol. Δ on Ar. Vesp. 1035; Apostol. ap. Leutsch Paroim.

They say that she was a Corinthian woman who, one evening, pur-posefully ate her own children and then flew away. Forever thereafter, whenever mothers want to scare their children, they invoke Mormo (author's translation). The story is similar to that of Lamia, insofar as Mormo bears children but then fails to nurture them successfully to adulthood. This similarity is noted by the scholiast himself, who elsewhere in the passage calls Mormo a type of lamia; the scholiast to Theocri-tus Idyll 15.40 explains the poet's reference to Mormo by saying that \"Mormo\" is just another name for Lamia, as is \"Gello,\" and then telling an abbreviated version of Diodorus' Libyan story.14 Equations of two or all of these demons are found in other ancient sources as well. Such equations should not surprise us; after all, the \"names\" are in reality adjectives that describe the demons as \"fearsome ones\" (mormones) and \"devourers\" (lamiai).15 All of these aitia express the belief that child-killing demons have their origin in mortal women who failed to bear and nurture children successfully.16 Thus, they suggest that it is not enough simply to hold back from the overtly inhuman act of killing chil-dren if a woman wants to retain membership in the human race— additionally, she must bear and nurture children. In other words, the aitia deliver the same message that a Greek woman heard from 14 Elsewhere I have argued that the myth of \"Mormo\" as we see it in the scho-liast to Aristides was influenced by the myth of Corinthian Medea, who pur-posely killed her children and then flew away in a dragon chariot (S. I. Johnston, \"Corinthian Medea and the Cult of Hera Akraia,\" in J. J. Clauss and S. I. Johnston, eds.. Medea (Princeton, 1996). 15 On possible meanings of \"empousa,\" see Waser, \"Empusa,\" PW, 5.2 col. 2542. The original meaning of \"Gello\" is hard to determine, as it bears no similar-ity to any Greek root other than \"gel-\", which produces words that mean both \"laugh\" and \"be an object of laughter.\" Some scholars associate \"Gello\" with the Sumerian/Akkadian \"Gallû.\" See below, however; other scholars of Sumerian/Akkadian languages, such as E. Ebeling, have rejected the derivation. 16 Similar explanations are given for the existence of child-killing demons in other cultures, particularly in the ancient Mediterranean (J. A. Scurlock, \"Baby-snatching Demons, Restless Souls and the Dangers of Childbirth: Medico-Magical Means of Dealing with some of the Perils of Motherhood in Ancient Mesopotamia,\" Incognita 2 [1991]: 1-112; Th. H. Gaster, \"A Canaanite Magical Text,\" Orientalia 11 [1942] 41-79). Egyptian texts mention \"dead men and women\" who come to attack the child; sometimes, a ghost wants to kiss the child or take it into her lap or arms, which may allude to the paradigm of the aoros woman (A. Erman, Zaubersprüche für Mutter und Kind, Abhandlungen der Königlichen Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften [Berlin, 1901], esp. 12-13, 32-33, 39, 40-45)."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"other sources: her goal in life was to become a mother. Failure or refusal to meet this goal amounted to virtually the same thing as an attack against the most important structure by which humanity organized itself: the family.17 The weakening or destruction of the family would allow humanity to slide back to some primitive, lawless, bestial state, as myths frequently sought to demonstrate. Humanity would be human no more. Zenobius and Hesychius specifically call Gello aôros, that is, \"untimely dead,\" one who has died before completing her life on earth.18 This term does not so much express Gello's failure to meet her reproductive obligations to others, such as those within her oikos, as the fact that she had failed to experience those things that defined her as a woman: parturition and nurture. She herself was incomplete; at the time of her death, she had not acquired the characteristics necessary to be considered a full member of the taxon \"woman.\" Because of her death, she would never acquire them, she would never pass into completion. Although Lamia and Mormo are never explicitly called aoroi, it is logical to assume that they were considered to belong to this group as well, for if, as I have just noted, it was not by marriage per se but rather by child-birth and nurture that a female was understood to have fulfilled her obligations to the family and state, then it is probable that her 17 Of course, the aitia associated with the demon also aligned well with the belief in demonic envy that was and still is very common in the Mediterranean basin: the sudden, inexplicable illnesses and deaths of children were attributed to demons who had cause to be envious of the children's successful mothers. 18 Zen.

Helen King has explored this topic in depth.19 Let us be exact about the ramifications of permanent exclusion from the taxon of \"completed woman.\" Death in this state exiles the aoros woman not only from the world of the living, as all deaths do, but also from the world of the dead, leaving her no recourse but to wander restlessly between the two. This is expressed in literary sources as early as Odyssey 11.13-41 by describing aoroi as lingering at the border between the upper world and the Under-world.20 Hesychius tells us that mormones were called planètes daimones (s.v. μορμόνας). The well-known importance of the aoroi in magic rests upon the assumptions that, unimpeded by Hades' gates, they could travel back and forth between the lower and upper worlds more easily than a \"fully dead\" soul, and that, unprotected by it, they were at the mercy of those who knew how to invoke them. Successful death, in other words, just like success-fill life, was open only to the complete, to the taxonomically perfect soul. Life and death themselves were both acceptable states for the soul to exist in, even if death was a somewhat less desirable state than life; it was in the margin between them that the real problems lay. The Greeks structured their cosmos so as to place one of the major sources of demonic interference—the aôroi— between the two most mutually exclusive taxa that any culture confronts: life and death. A comment by the Byzantine scholar John Damascenus suggests that the eschatologically marginal status of Greek child-killing demons, and perhaps of other aôroi, too, had existential ramifications, for he says that gelloudes and striges were believed to retain some, but not all, of their corporality. The wanderings of the child-killing demon did take her into in the world of the living, of course, where she made her presence known in dreadful ways.

There is no standard answer to this question, which, as Charles Stewart has discussed, is quite in accord with the nature of the demonic itself. In his study of the exotikà (demons) of the con-temporary Greek countryside, Stewart notes that their physical traits and behavior patterns vary from locale to locale, from neighbor to neighbor, or even from one statement to the next during a conversation with a single individual. This is because the function of such traits and patterns is not to identify one demon definitively in contrast to all others, but rather to say something about the nature of the demon as it is being experienced by a specific person at a specific moment.21 Demons are clay with which people mold images of their fears and anxieties; in order t ο express the fears and anxieties of the moment effectively, that clay must remain malleable. It is not until those who stand outside of a community begin to make lists of its demons (i.e., demonolo-gies) for their own purposes that any real consistency of traits and imagery is obtained, and it is an artificial consistency, born from a scholar's desire to organize, a magician's desire to control or a missionary's desire to devalue and eventually overcome. For an-cient Greek demons, this process began in earnest with the church fathers. Of course, even if we ignore the artificial constructions of scholars, magicians and church fathers, and attend, so far as we can, only to the reports of those for whom the demons are a real and active force in the cosmos, some consistency of description will emerge over the long run. Some traits symbolize some anxie-ties better than others; thus, those traits are called into use more frequently than others when that particular anxiety is expressed. An example borrowed from Stewart will serve to illustrate this idea. Many different types of demons in contemporary Greece (including lamies, khamotsàroukhoi and neraîdes ) are frequently described as being part goat. Goats are notoriously difficult to manage; for a culture in which herding is important, therefore, the goat is a potent symbol of trouble and possible loss of livelihood. This rather broad connotation makes the goat a symbol suitable for a variety of demons. But other symbols, expressive of some-21 Stewart, Demons, chap. 6. A similar point can be made about ghost beliefs in virtually any culture; see for example, J. J. Winkler on the iconography of Greek and Roman ghosts (\"Lollianos and the Desperadoes,\" JHS 100 [1980]: 155-81, esp. 158-165)."},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"what different anxieties, are sometimes attached to the same demons as is the goat symbol. A neraïda sometimes is described not as a goatish woman but rather as a woman who has abnormally elongated thighs; according to Stewart's analysis, this trait ex-presses her sexual deviancy and the danger she poses to married men.22 To pin down the symbol of the goat to one or two types of demons, or to delineate an exact, standardized iconography for the neraïda, would rob them of any power to express real, everyday anxieties; under such circumstances, a demon becomes a quaint remnant of a bygone culture rather than a vital idiom. The sym-bolic value of any trait associated with a demon, thus, must be evaluated in isolation from the demon as well as in connection with it. The classicist faces two problems that Stewart does not. First, our information is derived primarily from literary and artistic products; the informant has taken special care in choosing what he tells or shows us. A bigger problem is that our information is rela-tively meager: we cannot live among our subjects as Stewart did Neither problem is new to the classicist, but they do become more acute when we are dealing with material that, as I have suggested, is by its very nature fluid; any description of a demon that we possess is just a single—and perhaps very deliberate—selection from a wide range of possible traits. Nonetheless, some broad observations about the significance of the child-killing demon's iconography can be made. As we might expect, like demons throughout the world, child-killing demons generally are described as ugly—indeed, the paroemiographers tell us that Lamia's ugliness was proverbial. Mormo's name, which means \"Frightful,\" conveys the same idea.23 Lamia is portrayed as having disgusting personal habits, too: Aris-tophanes describes her as farting in public (Vesp. 1177; cf. Eccl. 77 and Crates frg. 18 = schol. Ar. Eccl. 77) and as having filthy testi-cles (Vesp. 1035 = Pax 758). This brings me to the next iconographie feature: Lamia was imagined to be bisexual. Not only do we hear about her testicles in Aristophanes' Peace and Wasps, but a scholiast on Ecclesiazusae 22 Stewart, Demons, chap. 6. 23 On Lamia's proverbial hideousness, see Ps. Diogenian. ap. Choirob. in Crameri Anecdot. Oxon. 2.293, Duris FGrH 76 F 17; further at Schwenn, \"Lamia\" PW, 12 col. 545. On Mormo as the essence of fearsomeness or \"mormo\" as a synonym for \"phobos\": Ar. Equ. 693; Xen. Hell. 4.4.17; schol. Ar. Ach. 582; schol. Ar. Pax 474 and often elsewhere; Hesychius and Photius explain cognates of \"mormo\" by cognates of \"phobos.\""},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"77 tells us that the fifth-century comic poet Crates portrayed Lamia with a \"staff' (σκυτάλη). In the Lysistrata, \"σκυτάλη\" is used as slang for \"phallus\" (line 991), and in a passage from the Ecclesiazusae that clearly alludes to the scene from Crates,24 \"σκΰταλον\" seems to be similarly used: some women are busily disguising themselves as men; one woman shows the others the splendid \"σκύταλον\" that she has stolen from her sleeping husband (lines 76-78); this follows immediately upon the other women's proud display of their \"walking sticks\" (βακτηρία; line 74). Stage business regarding that most essential piece of male comic-theatrical attire, the phallus, surely occurred here. A lekythos25 dated to the fifth century shows a naked, ithyphallic26 woman who, tied to a palm tree, is being tortured by satyrs. Her belly sags out over her groin, her breasts are horribly pendulous,27 fang-like teeth make her appearance frightening as well as repulsive. Her facial features and hair follow the conventions used in antiquity to repre-sent blacks. The palm tree and the negroid features suggest an African setting, which would align with the myths that made Libya Lamia's home (see below). The scholiast on Ecclesiazusae 77 tells us that Crates wrote a comedy called Lamia; scholars have sug-gested that the vase illustrates a scene from this or another satyr play about Lamia. (We know that Euripides, too, wrote a play about her; this would be slightly later than the lekythos, but be-speaks her popularity as a dramatic subject.28) Like her ugliness and dirtiness, Lamia's bisexuality obviously runs counter to the standard of the desirable woman. Moreover, as a sexual hybrid, Lamia is disconcerting in a way that she never could be as simply an ugly woman—or an ugly man—because she 24 Aristophanes names the thieving woman's husband \"Lamias\"; one of the thief s friends asks whether the club she stole is the same one as her husband had when he farted. 25 Lekythos in the National Museum of Athens, inv. 1129; discussed most recently by M. Halm-Tisserant (\"Folklore et Superstition en Grèce Classique: Lamia Torturée?\" Kernos 2 [1989]: 67-82), who cites the previous scholarship. The first to propose that the vase showed Lamia was M. Mayer, Jahrbuch des Deutschen archäologischen Instituts 7 (1892): 201. 26 This feature first was noticed by Halm-Tisserant, p. 76. The paint on this portion of the vase is damaged, but incised lines still show the phallus. A satyr holds a torch just under the phallus. 27 The modem Greek Lamia has monstrously large breasts (or else one mon-strously large breast): B.

Shape-shifting and partial theriomorphism, two other traits that, as was discussed above, work to strand demons between taxa, frequently are associ-ated with the Greek child-killing demon as well. Mormo is described by the poetess Erinna as \"having a face that changes constantly\"; several ancient sources credit Empousa with the ability to turn herself into various animals.29 All of the child-killing demons were, according to their myths, once women, and sometimes are por-trayed as having retained human traits. Yet Lamia and Empousa also are called thêria.30 Empousa frequently is said to have the legs of an ass, as is Mormo once.31 Mormo's common alternative name, mormolukê, implies a female werewolf; in the quotation that opened this article, Theocritus associates Mormo with the horse. Erinna's description of Mormo as \"having big ears\" and \"running around on all fours\" would accord with either the wolf or the horse. The strix, with which the Greeks were acquainted at least as early as the first century BCE and probably earlier, frequently is pictured as part woman and part owl or other bird of prey, a trait that other Greek child-killing demons subsequently display: lamiai are shown as birds in a fifth-century CE mosaic; several Byzantine sources describe gelloudes as flying. The Greek association of child-killing demons with nocturnal birds of prey is hinted at in a myth that goes back at least to the sixth-century poetess Corinna: the infanticidal Minyads become a νυκτερίς, a γλαύξ and a βύξα (or a κορώνη).32 29 Erinn.

Let us briefly consider the possible origins and, following Stewart's lead, the significance, of the four animals whose traits the child-killer bor-rows in extant sources: the bird of prey, the horse, the wolf and the ass. The bird of prey: Lamashtu almost always is shown on amuletic plaques with the forelegs and claws of a bird of prey, and some-times with wings, as well. Lilith, too, often is pictured with the features of an owl or other bird of prey.33 However, we must not leap to the conclusion that the Greek demon owes her avian char-acteristics to the Eastern ones. Child-killing demons are associated with birds of prey—and particularly with nocturnal raptors such as the owl—not only in other areas of the Mediterranean basin but in many other parts of the world as well.34 Moreover, many other types of Mediterranean demons have avian features—the Greek Harpies and Sirens, for example, are commonly represented as birds.35 The association is logical: raptors—especially nocturnal raptors—are swift and unusually silent. It seems likely that any culture exposed to owls and their kin would come to associate them with the sudden sorts of illnesses and deaths that the demons were believed to inflict. The horse: In Greece, the horse was strongly associated with Po-seidon, a dark and marginal god, a god of the frightening sea and destructive earthquake.36 According to myth and cultic tradition, the Child-Stealing Witch,\" Folklore 11 (1900): 129-62.

It is true that, particu-larly when ridden, the horse can be a positive icon for the Greeks,38 but its connection with the child-killing demon surely draws, instead, upon these darker and more violent connotations. The wolf: It is scarcely necessary to comment on the signifi-cance of the wolf, an animal that still loomed as a threatening predator of both flocks and humans in Europe until quite recently. It was an animal that the Greeks particularly \"liked to think with\"; the wolf frequently was set in opposition to all that represented civilized culture, the story of Lykaon's cannibalistic feast being a famous example.39 What does require some comment, perhaps, is the relationship between the \"mormo\" and the \"lukê\" of \"Mormolukê.\" \"Mormolukê\" typically has been understood by modern scholars as simply a longer version of the name \"Mormo,\" a version that delivers more information about the nature of the creature; the implication is that Mormo was a female werewolf. This causes problems for our understanding of Theocritus יs de-scription of Mormo as a horse. The key is to remember that \"Mormo\" began as a descriptive term—\"the frightening one.\" The fact that no myth for Mormo survives, except one that seemingly was borrowed from Lamia and Medea (see note 14 above), suggests that \"Mormo,\" in contrast to \"Lamia\" or \"Gello,\" remained a Campbell = schol. Ap. Rh. 4.828) and the daughter of Poseidon himself (Plut. Pyth. Orac. 398 C; Paus. 10.12.1; Clem. Al. Strom. 1.15.70) similarly linked the demon to the frightening, marginal area of the sea. In Byzantine traditions, the child-killing demon (usually called Gello) is chased to or found near the sea.

Given this—and given that demonological beliefs and iconography must remain fluid to serve any function—it is no surprise that \"Mormo\" could be conceived now as lupine, now as equine. We should remember, too, that Erinna described Mormo as changing constantly from one form to another. This expresses the disorienting, hybrid quality of a shape-shifter, but at the same time attests to a basic uncertainty as to which of many \"four-legged creature with big ears\" Mormo would choose to imitate. Perhaps in a given area, \"Mormo\" was associ-ated primarily with one animal; the fact that the use of \"mormolukê\" before the Roman period is restricted to Athenian authors suggests that in Attica, she typically was imagined as part wolf. Elsewhere—perhaps in Sicily, Theocritus's home?—she typically may have been part horse. The paraphrase employed by the scholiast on Theocritus Idyll 15.40, \"ή μορμώ ίππος δάκνει\" (quoted in full in note 1) brings us very close to an imagined \"Mormippos\" indeed. The ass: In contrast to the bird of prey, the horse and the wolf, the ass is not usually a demonic animal in ancient Greece or any-where else—worldwide, it typically has been associated with harm-less stupidity and stubborness. There are two exceptions to this rule. The first is the familiar association of the ass with Egyptian Seth or Typhon. It is possible that this worked to confirm an existing association between the ass and Empousa, but it does not seem likely to have been the origin of Empousa's asinine traits. The second exception is more enticing, for it is Lamashtu. La-mashtu is often shown with ass's teeth and ass's ears on amuletic plaques, and these ears and teeth also are mentioned in ritual texts. Once, she is said to have an \"ass's form.\" Once, she is adjured to \"go away, like a savage ass!\" Body parts of asses can be used in amulets against Lamashtu, which may be a case of similia similibus (see below).40 It is tempting to trace Empousa's asininity back to Lamashtu, but the fact that it most often is expressed specifically by making Empousa's feet or legs asinine is problematic. Feet and legs are not among the parts of Lamashtu that are labelled or 40 W.

As in many other cultures, the Greek child-killer not only was thought to attack infants and pregnant women, but also to seduce and then destroy young men. Thus, for example, when Empousa appears to Xanthias and Dionysus in the Frogs, she manifests herself, inter alia, as a beautiful girl (line 290). The lecherous old woman of Aristophanes' Ecclesiazusae (line 1056) is called an empousa. The demon that attempts to seduce a young philosopher in Philostra-tus' Vita Apollonii several times is called an empousa; Philostratus twice calls her a lamia and once a mormolukia as well (VA 4.25). This combination of functions—seducing men and harming children—has survived today in the demons believed to inhabit the Greek countryside. Stewart discusses the fact that many of these demons are thought to look normal on top, but to have lower limbs that are defective in some way. Thus, modern lamiai are beautiful women with the legs or feet of an ass, or sometimes of a goat or cow. Neraïdes are said to have a single ass-leg or foot, or to have abnormally and displeasingly long legs. Modern striges have legs or feet that are turned backwards. Stewart notes that feet and legs have erotic connotations in contemporary Greek thought, and suggests that the defectiveness of the demons' legs and feet, therefore, symbolizes the bestiality or perversity of their sexual conduct—such demons do not behave as \"good\" women should, sexually and reproductively.42 Could we apply Stewart's interpretation to Empousa, too? This solution becomes appealing when we recall that the ancient Greeks associ-ated both male and female asses not only with stupidity and stub-borness, as many other cultures do, but also with excessive lust and extraordinary sexual ability. An illustration of this connection 41 In the upper right-hand comer of amulets to avert Lamashtu there frequently appears a drawing of an ass's hoof and foreleg. This may represent some sort of offering, however, as do all of the other drawings that are distributed around the plaques (e.g., drawings of spindles, combs, fibulae). Some ritual texts promise Lamashtu an ass on which she can travel away from her victim; the foot and foreleg would be a convenient way of representing an entire animal that might be difficult to inscribe at small scale. Alternatively, as Erica Reiner has suggested to me, the drawing may allude to the use of fetlocks in ritual aversions and purifica-tions. See, for example, a first-millennium spell recorded by R. Caplice, \"Namburi Texts in the British Museum,\" Orientalia 40.2 (1971): 145 (line 46). 42 Stewart, Demons, 180-83."},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"occurs already in Semonides' sixth-century BCE poem on women: god created different types of women from different animals; each displays the characteristics of its ancestor. The woman born of an \"ash-grey ass ... takes on any man when it comes to sex\" (frg. 7.48-49). In Lucian's parody of the Odyssey, some sailors meet beautiful, ass-legged demons who intend to seduce and then con-sume them while they sleep (Ver. Hist. 2.46). The ass-legged de-mon who appears to Solomon in the Testament (line 1320) has the form of a beautiful woman above the knees; she, too, specializes in seducing and then devouring men. (As for the male ass's sexuality, I need mention only the mythic contest between Priapus and a male ass to determine which was the better endowed representative of his gender—a contest that Priapus lost.)43 It is likely that Em-pousa's asinine legs and feet were intended to express her role as a seductress, rather than her role as child-killer, which in any case is less prominent in our sources. Having analyzed the animals with which the demons are associ-ated, we now might turn to the geographical and genealogical associations of one of them: Lamia. In one late source (schol. Ar. Pax 758), Lamia is called not the daughter of Poseidon, as she is in Plutarch (Pyth. Orac. 398 C), Pausanias (10.12.1) and Clement (Strom. 1.15.70), but the daughter of Belos; Burkert took this as an indication that the Greeks themselves recognized her Eastern origins, as \"Belos\" is a Hellenized form of the Babylonian \"Baal\". It seems more likely to me, however, that \"Belos\" functioned here as it does elsewhere in Greek myth—as a stop-gap name in foreign genealogies. In addition to Belos-the-father-of-Lamia, there was, for example, a mythological Belos who was the king of Tyre, a third of Lydia, a fourth of Persia and a fifth of Egypt.44 All that \"Belos\" tells us about Lamia, in other words, is that the Greeks wanted to situate her outside their realm of normalcy and civiliza-tion. Similarly, Lamia usually is said to have come from Libya;45 43 Contest with Priapus: Lact. De Fais. Relig. 1.22, cf. Hyg. 33. According to several sources, asses were sacrificed to Priapus: Ov. F. 1.391 and 440, 6.345; Lact. Div. Inst. 1.21; Myth. Vat. 3.6.26. Pindar P. 10.36 describes the asses which are sacrificed to Hyperborean Apollo as having \"upright wantonness\" (Cpptç όρθία).

Th. 6). Analo-gously, Lamashtu is called a \"foreigner\" and is said to dwell in the swamps or mountains. Egyptian child-killers are believed to come out of Asia.47 The names of the child-killing demons also have been examined by scholars with a view to the East. Most recently, Burkert and West have suggested that \"Gello\" looks back to the Sumerian-Akkadian \"Gallû,\" one type of Underworld demon. Some caution is necessary here, however, for \"Gallû\" denotes an all-purpose sort of male demon held responsible for a wide variety of problems and \"Gello\" a female demon with a very specific role. The relationship between them, if any, is thus limited strictly to a linguistic bor-rowing. It cannot be used to account for any of Gello's defining traits or her significance among the Greeks. Burkert, West and others also have suggested that \"Lamia\" was a development from \"Lamashtu.\" But the scholiast on Aristophanes' Wasps 1035 and many modern scholars suggest that \"Lamia\" is derived from the same root as Greek words for \"gullet\" (laimos and lamos), and thus means something such as \"She who swallows down\" (discussed at Schwenn, \"Lamia\" PW, 12.1 col. 544; cf. Hor. A.P. 340 and the use of \"lamia\" to indicate a type of voracious shark at Arist. HA 540b18); the king of the cannibalistic Laestiygonians similarly is named \"Lamos.\" \"Lamia\" probably began as an appellative noun that was later capitalized, so to speak, into a personal name, as in the case with many demonic names (e.g., \"Harpy\" from \"harpazein     48.(״    mother, by Zeus, of the Libyan sibyl. 46 A different idea is expressed by the scholium to Theoc. 15.40, which makes Lamia the queen of the cannibalistic Laestrygonians (although this surely draws on the fact that in Od. 10.81 and thereafter, \"Lamos\" is king of the Laestrygoni-ans). 47 Myhrman, \"Labartu,\" esp. 147-48; Erman, Zaubersprüche, 14, 22, 24, 41. 48 Burkert, Orientalizing, and West, \"Gello\"; both cite earlier proponents.

The Chicago Assyrian Dictionary (G 19b) notes that the term \"gallû\" originally denoted a police official.

Instead, most of the traits have been shown to accord well with the premises that a society marginalizes that which is undesirable by labelling it de-monic, and then further marginalizes the demonic by attaching to it other marginal traits such as bimorphism. Other traits are logi-cal, for example, her associations with the bird of prey. Recent work, some of it by Burkert and some by other scholars repre-sented in this volume, has argued persuasively that ritual tech-niques travelled extensively and easily around the Mediterranean basin in antiquity—with this premise, I strongly agree. But I hesi-täte to assume that demonic traits can travel as easily. Beliefs that express a culture's fears and desires, as demonological beliefs do, are more deeply embedded in that culture's cognitive map than are technai. Moreover, whereas new technai can be used in concert with old—can supplement the old—beliefs often cannot be. A new belief must either align closely with an old one—in which case it cannot be so new—or displace it completely. To seek analogies for Greek demonological beliefs within other cultures can be prof-itable in that comparisons sometimes point out to us certain fea-tures that would otherwise go unnoticed. But when we seek gene-alogies for them within other cultures, we usually will be on shakier ground, and will fail to reach conclusions that shed much light on Greek beliefs themselves. * *  *  Here I will survey techniques for averting the demons I have just described. It will be seen that, as was the case with most demoni-cally-induced problems, aversion techniques existed from early times, but additional, foreign techniques subsequently were adopted, too.49 49 In addition to the spells and amulets I discuss here, which are directed against demons, we also possess spells and amulets intended to protect the mother, fetus and newborn child against problems of unspecified origin; I will not discuss these because of constraints of space.

When, in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, Demeter describes how she will protect Demophon from demonic attack that brings many ills (έπηλυσίη πολυπήμων)50 and, specifically, from a mysterious demonic force called \"the undercutter\" or \"plant-cutter\" (ύποταμνόν, ύλοτόμον), she says that she knows of an άντίτομον (\"counter-cut,\" i.e., \"counter-root\" or \"counter-plant\") greater than the ύποτάμνον or ύλοτόμον and, more generally, that she knows an excellent means of averting such problems (έσθλόν έρυσμόν) (lines 227-30): θρέψω, κού μιν έολπα κακοφραδίησι τιθήνης ούχ' άρ' έπηλυσίη δηλήσετοα ούθ' ύποτόμνον· όίδα γαρ άντίτομον μέγα φέρτερον ύλοτόμοιο, όίδα δ' έπηλυσίης πολυπήμονος έσθλόν έρυσμόν. I will nurse him, nor do I expect that either a demonic attack or the \"undercutter\" will harm him due to his nurse's negligence; for I know a great antidote root, stronger than the \"plant-cutter,\" and I know an excel-lent defence against the demonic attack that brings many ills. Έρυσμόν is cognate with έρυμα, which suggests that it describes an object that was used as a \"defense\" against something. Like άντίτομον, it probably refers to a specific plant that Demeter will wield to protect the child, for in the only other place where it occurs, in later Greek, it is a name for a plant whose seeds are swallowed by women experiencing difficult labor.51 As noted above, the same demons were thought to attack infants as attacked preg-nant and parturient women; the same means of aversion, logically, could therefore be employed to protect the woman and the child.52 Lines 227-30 of the Hymn noticeably echo magical incantations 50 Discussion of έπηλυσίη as demonic attack in N.

Socrates described midwives as using epaoidiai to insure successful birth (PI. Theat. 149 c-d), and in the Phaedo 77e, he tells Cebes that a child's fear of mormolukeia can be charmed away (έξεπφτητε) by the singing of spells (έπςίδειν). The more detailed aversion spells recorded in post-classical sources, like much Greco-Roman magic, show the influence of Egyptian and Near Eastern practices. Aetite, or \"eagle stone,\" which is mentioned in several sources, is an interesting case in point. The Kyranides, a list of the magical properties of animals and plants that was compiled in Greek during the Imperial Age, says that, when worn, aetite protects the child in the womb and will not allow it to be miscarried (3.1.91-93). The Damigeron-Evax lithica, which probably was composed in the first century BCE, tells us that aetite prevents premature labor and then, when the proper time has arrived, facilitates parturition (1.5-7). \"Aetite\" was and still is the name of a hollow stone in which another, smaller stone is trapped—a special type of geode. The symbolism is obvious: a \"pregnant stone\" protects pregnant women. The lithica goes on to say that aetite also protects infants and young girls: \"Amplius infantes et puellas conservât ... Lim-phaticisque et terroribus nefandis efficit ut nec visa somnientur nec frequenter cadant,\" \"It greatly protects babies and young girls.... it is efficacious against frenzies and unspeakable terrors so that neither will they be seen in dreams nor occur frequently\" (1.13-15). The \"nightmares\" brought on by terrors sound like a rational-istic explanation for what folk belief would call the attacks of child-killing demons, who typically struck while the child was asleep. Aetite's use to protect children against such attacks proba-bly was secondary to its obstetrical use, but such an extension is logical, when we recall that, in Greek belief, the same demons who attacked the pregnant mothers attacked the children. We also know that aetite was used in Near Eastern obstetrical and pediatric magic. Because the logic behind aetite's obstetrical use seems obvious, we might presume that its deployment in each place developed independently.54 The Greeks and Romans had 53 Richardson, Demeter, 229.

Pliny provided three different explanations, the most far-fetched being that the stone is the same color as an eagle's tail (HN 37§ 187; cf. 10§12 and 36§149; cf. further explanations in Barb, \"Birds\"). The real source of the name probably lies, as Barb suggested, in the fact that the Assyrian name for this stone was \"aban eri.\" \"Era\" can mean either \"pregnant\" or \"eagle\"; the Assyrians themselves punned upon this fact by making the eagle the means by which a mythical pregnancy drug was carried to a woman.55 It seems likely that the Greeks first learned of aetite's obstetrical uses from Eastern sources and, when they adopted the stone, also adopted and translated the name. Whether the pediatric uses were associated with it already in the East, or were, rather, Greek additions, is unclear. Other stones mentioned in the Greek lithica can be explained without recourse to the East; I describe only one here. Galactite was to be hung around the neck of a newborn to ward off the eyes of evil-planning \"Megaira\"; another lithica similarly says that galactite protects the infant from the \"horrida mulier\" who seeks to sap his strength; both \"Megaira\" (the \"Begradger\") and \"horrida mulier\" would seem to refer to our child-killing demon.56 These uses of galactite may have grown from galactite's other, less sensa-tional uses in obstetrical and pediatric magic and medicine, where the logic behind the stone's use is self-evident: this stone that extrudes a milky-white liquid when it is soaked in water57 was thought to increase the milk of herd animals such as goats and sheep and also of women. Perhaps it was believed that the same sort of demon that would obstruct milk also would obstruct delivery and attack the nursing child; perhaps the original, specifically associative values of the stone were forgotten, and galactite simply became a kind of stone that helped new mothers and babies, ap-plied in a variety of situations.58 1936), 104-08. 5* Barb, \"Birds,\" 317-18. 56 Orphic lithica 224-25, cf.

Certainly, the hyena played an impor-tant role in Greco-Roman magic by the time of Pliny, who records a number of uses for hyena's body parts; a hyena's tooth, like its eyes, could avert night terrors and ghosts (nocturnos pavores umbrarumque terrorem), and skin from its forehead could avert the evil eye. The hyena was particularly useful in obstetrical and pediatric situations, judging from Pliny's remarks: inter alia, mis-carriage could be averted by wearing white flesh from a hyena tied up in a gazelle skin with seven hyena hairs and a stag's penis (HN 28§27; cf. 28§29). Notably, the hyena is found throughout south-west Asia and northeast Africa but not at all in Europe; Greek and Roman authors most likely borrowed and adapted spells involving hyena parts from either Near Eastern or Egyptian sources. The author of the Kyranides or his source probably inserted the name of a child-killing demoness—Gello—with which he was familiar into a spell designed for obstetrical and pediatric problems in general. Asses' bones and blood are familiar to us from the magical pa-pyri; occasionally, we also encounter an ass's hide, used as a substi-tute for the papyrus on which a spell is to be written. Like the hyena, it also is an animal frequently encountered in the 28th book of Pliny's Historia Naturalis (see especially §77), and like the hyena, it has several obstetrical and pediatric uses. For example, an ass's liver, worn as an amulet, protects babies from epileptic fits, and an ass's hide protects sleeping babies from fears (fecit infantes inpavidos); this looks like a rationalized account of our spell against Gello from the Kyranides (HN 28§78). It probably is cor-rect to explain most uses of ass parts in the magical papyri with reference to the asinine form of Seth-Typhon, for most of them draw on Egyptian sources. It is probable that this significance of the ass eventually became more broadly applied, too, so that it became a sort of all-purpose demonic animal, and its body parts became all-purpose amulets, similia similibus.

A Mesopotamian practitioner seeking to avert Lamashtu from mother and child would take hair from the right side of a male ass, hair from the left side of a female ass and hair from an unspecified part of an ass foal. He would combine it with an insect and hang them in a bundle around the neck of the potential victim.60 I will finish this survey of aversion techniques with an iambic chant recorded by the second-century CE grammarian Festus, who gives the first-century BCE Verrius Flaccus as his source: Go away strix, you night-wandering one; go away from the people, you bird whose name is not to be mentioned. Go away upon swift ships.61 Clearly, as Weinreich62 and others have pointed out, this is a variation of the \"apopompe\" or \"pheuge \" spells well known from other Greek and Roman sources, in which abstract evils such as hunger and famine, or animals that seem to represent diseases— dogs, wolves and beetles for example—are exorcised. But this passage is unusual in that it tells the demon to go away onto the ship. Rituals from the old, middle and new Babylonian periods (approx. 1750-600 BCE) attempted to send Lamashtu away by means of a ship, a donkey or both. The rituals involved dedicating small clay ships and/or donkeys to a statuette of Lamashtu, as well as provisions and gifts such as malt, food, water, spindles, sandals, fibulae and combs, which were supposed to keep her happy on her journey. Some ritual texts tell her to use the ship to \"go across the river,\" which may mean the river that separated the land of the living from the land of the dead in Mesopotamian thought, or \"go across the sea.\" This aversion ritual is reflected on amulets and plaques intended to keep Lamashtu away, which frequently show her standing either upon a ship or upon a donkey that itself stands on a ship, surrounded by the provisions and gifts that the worship-per has given.63 60 Erie Lichty, \"Demons and Population Control,\" Expedition 13.2 (1971): 22-26; Myhrman, \"Labartu Texte,\" 151. 61 Στρίγγ\" άποπομπείν νυκτιβόαν, // στρίγγ\" άπό λαών, // δρνιν άνωνύμιον / / ώκυπόρους Μ νήας.

This reputation, however, largely rests on an episode of necromancy in the sixth book of his docu-drama epic about the Roman Civil War, the Bellum ciuile or the Phar-salia. In this striking segment of the poem—one of its longest episodes (BC 6.413-830)—Sextus, the unworthy son of the Opti-mate general Pompey, consults Erichto, the most notorious among the witches reputed to haunt Thessaly in northern Greece. The witch Erichto has been the subject of a number of concentrated studies, the most often cited probably one by A. Bourgery in 1928.1 Bourgery limited himself to an intense examination of the necromancy in the sixth book and ignored other elements of magic in the epic. A fairly extensive progeny of studies has centered on or dealt in some measure with Erichto in the sixty-five years that have followed Bourgery.2 Precisely this thorough treatment of one episode to the neglect or at least light treatment of another scene of magic in the epic persuaded me to look elsewhere in the poem.3 1 \"Lucain et la magie,\" Revue des Etudes Latines 6 (1928): 299-313. 2 Anne-Marie Tupet gives a fairly detailed bibliography current up to 1974, along with a listing of some studies prior to Bourgery that he overlooked (La magie dans la poésie latine I: Des origines à la fin du règne d'Auguste, [Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1976], 422-26). A more recent study by Richard Gordon also contains a fairly good summation of relevant bibliography up to the date of its publication (\"Lucan's Erictho,\" Homo Viator: Classical Essays for John Bramble, eds. Michael Whitby, Philip Hardie, and Mary Whitby [Bristol: Bristol Classical Press, 1987; Oak Park: Bolchazy-Carducci, 1987], 231-41). 3 W. R. Johnson remaries on the avoidance of the snake episode in \"Lucan's strongest supporters\" because it is \"embarrassing\" (Momentary Monsters: Lucan and his Heroes, Cornell Studies in Classical Philology 47, [Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1987], 52). The subject is not really ad-dressed at all by Marie P. O. Morford, though his book has a chapter on \"Divination and Magic\" (The Poet Lucan: Studies in Rhetorical Epic [Oxford: Blackwell, 1967], 59-74). Frederick M.

Following the account of Pompey's defeat at Pharsalus and assassination at Alexandria, described in the sixth and eighth books of the epic, Lucan tells how Cato undertook to rescue his cause's fortunes by leading troops westward across the Libyan desert from near Cyrene to the city of Leptis near Carthage. After several preliminary passages Lucan recounts how Cato's army sets out across the sands with its commander on foot at the head of the column (BC 9.587-88). The theme of poisonous serpents arises immediately as the army comes upon a water source infested by venomous snakes both on its banks and in the water itself (BC 9.607-10). Cato, seeing that his troops fear that the snakes have transferred their toxin to the water (BC 9.611), assures them that the reptiles can poison only by injecting their venom into the bloodstream. Further, he takes the first drink himself, an exception to his usual practice of drinking only after his troops have done so (BC 9.616-18). To explain the presence of the snakes, Lucan recounts an etiological tale explaining how Africa came to have so many poisonous snakes. When the Argive hero Perseus had cut off the Gorgon Medusa's head, blood dripped as the winged hero carried it homeward, and where the drops of blood fell, seventeen varieties of venomous snakes were born, all enumerated in detail (BC 9.619-733). Now that Lucan is thoroughly warmed up to his subject, he turns to a series of baroque descriptions of the consequences of the bites of seven kinds of serpents. He even gives the personal names of the soldiers bitten and sometimes their original homes (BC 9.734־ 838). This latter detail, as we shall see, will be in one instance of some relevance to our study. The bite-ravaged army now feels despair, but just at this darkest moment in their fortunes hope arrives, as the following translation of Lucan's narrative will make clear:4 single note (Lucan: an Introduction, Cornell Studies in Classical Philology 39 [Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1976], 72-74, 268-71, p. 271 n. 47)4 י Translations throughout are my own."},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"At the last moment Fortune, herself wearied by such danger, brought aid to the miserable men. A nation uniquely immune to the savage bite cf serpents inhabits these lands, the Marmarid Psylli. Their tongues are equal to powerful herbs, and their blood is secure and so powerful as not even to be affected by poison. The nature of the locale bade that they be unharmed though among serpents. They profited by placing their dwell-ing amid poison. They have made peace with death. So great is their confidence in their bloodline, that when a tiny infant falls to earth, out cf apprehension that there is some admixture of foreign parentage, they test the questionable offspring with a fatal serpent.5 ... So the Psylli have proof of their offspring—any infant who has not shuddered at contact with snakes, any infant who has played with the serpents given him (is genu-ine). That race, content not only with their own welfare, watches out fa strangers, and the Psyllan comes to everyone's aid against harmful mon-sters (BC 9.890-901, 906-11). Lucan hereupon tells how the Psylli protect the Roman camp by fumigation, burning herbs, fragrant wood, and the horns of a stag to keep snakes away. While the plants and animal products protect the soldiers by night, for the hours of daylight, when they are on the march, they need help if bitten, and for this I return to a translation: But if someone contracts mortal danger from a daytime misfortune, then take place the marvels of the magic race and the great battle of the Psylli with the poison that has been injected. First the Psyllan marks the limbs with a touch of his saliva, which restrains the venom and keeps it by the wound; then he rolls forth incantations with his frothing tongue in an un-broken murmur, and the progress of the wound does not grant a breath-ing space nor the approach of death allow the least silence. Often, in feet, the poison that has made its way to the blackened marrow flees when chanted over; but if any venom is reluctant to obey and resists when called forth and bidden to leave, then he bends over and licks the whiten-ing wound with his mouth, drawing forth the venom. Then he dries the limbs with his teeth.6 Moreover he successfully spits forth the fatal mate-rial that he has extracted from the chilly body; and the (other) Psyllans 5 \"Falls to earth\" probably means simply \"is bom.\" Cf.

Now we should examine several facets of the episode. First, who were the Psylli? Then, what were the antecedents of their snakebite treatment? Finally, why did Lucan regard the Psylli as magical? In answer to the first question, Lucan's magical snake-charming Psylli, inhabitants of the Libyan desert, should have long since been extinct, according to the earliest account of them in Herodo-tus.8 The fifth-century BCE historian has one of his most curious stories to tell of them, which I translate in its entirety: The Psylli are neighbors to the Nasamonians. They (the Psylli) perished in the following way. The south wind blew on them and dried up all their reservoirs of water. Their whole country, lying inside the Syrtes (sandy shoals on the North African shore), was waterless. They took counsel and by a common decision marched out in battle array against the south wind (—I'm telling you what the Libyans say!—), and when they were in the sand, the south wind blew and covered them. Since they per-ished, the Nasamonians possess the country (Hist. 4.173.1-8). You will note that Herodotus does not connect them with snake charming. His account (in spite of the present-tense \"are neigh-bors to the Nasamonians\" in its first line) implies that he regarded them as no longer in existence. But within two centuries of Herodotus we begin to find writers who regard them as still around, and almost every one of these 7 The startling and unappetizing interpretation of the last two lines of Lu-can's passage as indicated by the words in parentheses derives from A. E. Hous-man's critical apparatus to line 936 in his edition of the Bellum ciuile (1927, reprint; Oxford: Blackwell, 1950) and is now generally accepted. 8 Hecataeus, a predecessor of Herodotus, spoke of the Psyllic Gulf of Libya (Felix Jacoby, Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker, I: Genealogie und Mythographie [Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1957], fr. 332). No explicit indication sur-vives that he mentioned the Psylli or their dealings with snakes, though Lionel Pearson claims that Herodotus used wording \"very probably taken directly from the Periegesis\" (Early Ionian Historians [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1939], 91)."},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"subsequent writers connects them with snake charming.9 The major Hellenistic work on snakes, a didactic poem by Nicander, the Theriaca, the \"beast-lore\" book, to be sure has nothing about the Psylli in its extensive discussion of treatment of snakebite, but a fragment of another work by this same second-century BCE writer gives the basic notion of the Psylli that became widespread in the ancient world: I have heard that in Libya the race of the Psylli themselves does not suffer at all from moidering bites of beasts, (the Psylli) whom beast-nourishing Syrtis feeds, and they aid also other people suffering from bites, not work-ing by roots of herbs, but by contact with their hmbs (frg. apud Aristo-phanes Gramm. 32 l).10 The first-century BCE Roman scholar Varro adds the next ele-ment to our knowledge of the ancient beliefs about the Psylli. He likens them to another snake-handling race, the Ophiogeneis of Asia Minor, whose very name means \"snake-born.\" He tells the story that Lucan repeats, that these two peoples test the legiti-macy of their children by allowing them contact with poisonous snakes (Antiquitates 1.2.1). A poet contemporary with Varro, Gaius Helvius Cinna, whose works are lost except for fragments, has left us a bit of a line about a Psyllus doing something to a sleepy asp, the verb being lost (Cinna frg. apud Aulus Gellius 9.12.12.2). A more important poetic source comes in the genera-tion following Caesar's death, this in the person of Aemilius Macer, an older contemporary of Ovid.11 Ovid tells us in his poetic review of his own life that Macer as an old man used to read him a poem telling about \"what serpent is harmful and what herb helps\" (Tristia 4.10.43). The \"herb (that) helps\" presumably helps to treat snakebite, for we know that Macer did a verse adaptation of Nicander's Theriaca into Latin, and he possibly moved the Greek poet's reference to the Psylli into his rendering of the 9 Aulus Gellius, to be sure, regards them as extinct, Psyllos quondam fuisse in terra Africa conterminos Nasamonibus (16.11.3.4), but he clearly bases his account entirely on Herodotus. 10 Also quoted by Aelian, Natura animalium 16.28; frg. 32 in A.

Fac. 39) and surely much longer than that. Lucan, however, for some reason wanted to exclude them from the canon of snake handlers. He does this not by omission, as Bourgery suggests, but by expressly introducing a Roman soldier from the Marsi, \"Nasidius, a cultivator of a Mar-sian field\" (BC 9.790) who was bitten by the prester, \"the burning snake,\" and died a hideous death.14 It would seem that Lucan wanted to attribute the power of magic healing to the Psylli alone. He never names the Ophiogeneis. How the Psylli dealt with the snakes deserves some attention. Consistent with what Nicander had said in the fragment quoted earlier about the Psylli not using herbs to cure snakebite, Lucan's Psylli use herbs and wood only to fumigate the area of the Roman camp, not to treat bitten soldiers (BC 9.911-22). In spite of what Nicander said of the Libyan people in the fragment I cited, this is not the way he recommended others proceed in the extant Theriaca. There, in addition to preventative fumigation and other botanical and zoological deterrents (35-114), he has specific herbal remedies, and a few made from animal products, for treating the victim, dozens of them extending over 221 lines of verse (Theriaca 493-713). The absence of any of this in Lucan is note-worthy. Let me point out that when Lucan deals with treatments for bites, he specifically calls the procedures magical, \"the marvels of a magic race,\" magicae miracula gentis, in the passage I cited earlier (BC 9.923). Lucan's wording gives me, for the moment at 12 Willy Morel thinks that the poem by Nicander, from which the fragment derives, had already disappeared by Macer's day and therefore could not have been inserted in the version of the Theriaca (\"Iologica,\" Philologus 83 [1928]: 35Π. 13 Macer frg. 8 is clearly the model for BC 9.711 (Fragmenta poetarum lati-norum epicorum et lyricorum, praeter Ennium et Lucilium, ed.

Provisionally I shall adopt a minimal-ist definition borrowed from Anne-Marie Tupet in her study of magic in Latin poetry:15 In the face of the difficulty of ascertaining with certainty the particular fea-tures of magic, in the face of the ambiguity and indecision of its domains as well as of its aims and its procedures, it seems wiser to look for an exterior criterion and to have recourse to the authors. We shall consider as magic what the poets themselves recognize and present as such. I shall not stick with this evasion for the entirety of the paper, but it is useful to recognize that Lucan considers in the category of magic every act the Psylli perform in the episode following the announcement of the \"marvels of a magic race.\" Lucan begins by saying, \"First the Psyllan marks the limbs with a touch of his saliva, which restrains the venom and keeps it by the wound\" (BC 9.925-26). Saliva magic has long been recognized by folklorists, and late in the nineteenth century its Greco-Roman manifestations were the subject of a study by Frank W. Nichol-son.16 He argued that saliva was thought to have primarily a prohibitive function, giving it its ability to inhibit the progress of the poison. The ancients regarded human saliva as particularly effective against snakes and even as being venomous. They thought that a human, particularly when fasting, could kill a snake by spitting into its mouth, a notion that persisted into the seven-teenth century. As Anne-Marie Tupet reports, the belief was tested in a curious set of experiments some time before 1672.17 The French royal physician and pharmacologist Moyse Charas proclaimed, \"We have often spit into the mouths of several vi-pers, even when we were fasting, but the vipers a little afterwards 15 Anne-Marie Tupet, La magie ... xi: \"Devant la difficulté de reconnaître avec certitude les traits particuliers à la magie, devant l'ambiguïté et l'indécision des ses domaines, comme de ses objectifs et de ses procédés, il a paru plus sage de rechercher un critère extérieur, et de s'en remettre aux auteurs. Nous considérons donc comme magique ce que les poètes reconnaissent et présentent eux-mêmes comme tel.\" 16 W. Crook, \"Saliva,\" Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, ed.

Charas' willingness to risk a disastrous bite on the nose thus put the misap-prehension to rest at last. From his first mention of the Psylli Lucan had stressed the im-portance of their spoken formulae in the cure of snakebite. We have seen that he introduced them by saying, \"Their tongues are equal to powerful herbs\" (BC 9.893). True to that predication, the Psyllan \"then ... rolls forth incantations with his frothing tongue in an unbroken murmur, and the progress of the wound does not grant a breathing space nor the approach of death allow the least silence. Often, in fact, the poison that has made its way to the blackened marrow flees when chanted over\" (BC 9.927-31). The place of chanted formulae in the ancient world is too well-known and too extensively commented on to require much treat-ment at this point. Virgil in his magical eighth Eclogue has his love-sick Simaetha, in recounting the powers of singing charms, say, \"By singing the cold snake in the meadow bursts\" (71), but the incantations are far older than that. Niek Veldhuis in the Nether-lands is preparing for publication some charms against snakebite from the Old Babylonian period.18 In a period subsequent to Lu-can, though perhaps reflecting far older folk practices, we find in the Greek Magical Papyri a formula for killing a snake by words and imitative action.19 The same may be said for a Coptic wizard's formula from the Michigan collection.20 Lucan's final curative procedure, standing in the last place in a series as it does (BC 9.931-37), by the rhetorical and poetic prac-tice of his day is meant to bear the chief emphasis in the episode. This is the procedure of sucking the venom out, which I quoted earlier: . . . but if any venom is reluctant to obey and resists when called forth and bidden to leave, then he bends over and licks the whitening wound 18 Personal e-mail message, 2/19/92. 19 \"If you want to kill a snake: Say, 'Stay, for you are Aphyphis.'

Of all the curative procedures Lucan and Nicander recommend, this is in fact the only one that would receive any attention in a modern first aid handbook, granted that it is now regarded as a last resort. Lucan clearly considers sucking out the poison as the crowning piece of the \"marvels of a magic race,\" climaxing a sequence begun with saliva and incantation.21 And to give a final punch to this miraculous procedure he assures us that the Psylli can identify by taste the sort of snake that caused the bite (BC 9.936-37). In classifying the ability to suck out snake venom as magical, Lucan is less than consistent with what he had written earlier of Cato declaring that snake venom taken orally was harmless and thereupon drinking from the water in the snake-infested pool to prove his point (BC 9.607-618). At that moment the serpents' poison would seem harmless when taken orally. Our poet seems t ο have conveniently forgotten this when he tells of the Psylli, in whom the ability to suck out poison orally seems a form of magic. We would, however, be unreasonable to require adherence to con-sistency or toxicological accuracy from this most sensationalist of Roman poets. The purpose of the scene at the snake-infested pool is to enhance Cato's heroic stature. In this scene he wants to stress the marvelously anomalous physical constitution of the Psylli. My remaining purpose is to move beyond Tupet's provisional classification of magic as being what Lucan expressly calls magic, magicae miracula gentis (BC 9.923), and to address the question of why the poet regards the Psylli as magical and his neighbors in Italy, the Marsi, as not. We should base our determination on the status of the Marsi and of the Psylli in Lucan's day. A magical people is socially, geographically, culturally, and politically margi-nalized.22 But the Marsi were a native-born Italian military people and, since they had quit rebelling against Rome and since Italy had 21 \"Iologica,\" Philologus 33 (1928): 351-52.

The answer to this latter is, I think, that the Marsi were no longer marginalized, no longer different in Lucan's eyes, whereas the Psylli, a foreign, nomadic, little-known desert people, fit the requirements much better. On an individual scale the witch Erichto in the sixth book of the epic had been magical for similar reasons.24 She was an old woman, in the remote north of Greece, living apart—the ultimate bag lady, only that her bag was filled with human body parts. Similarly, I conclude that Lucan perceived the Psylli and their actions as magical because they appeared in his eyes as radically other, by genetic make-up as well as by habit, remote, on the periphery of the known world, and different from the normative standards of his culture. 23 Earlier, of course, they had been quite otherwise. See Giulia Piccaluga, \" I Marsi e gli Hirpi,\" Magia: Studi di storia delle religioni in memoria di Raf-faela Garosi (Rome: Bulzoni, 1976), 209. My colleague, Prof. Anthony Cor-beill, suggests that Lucan also might have shared Aulus Gellius' view that the Marsi lost their immunity by miscegenation, a mistake the Psylli avoided by the drastic trial by serpent to which they subject their new-born infants (16.11.2). 24 See the analysis in Richard Gordon, \"Lucan's Erictho,\" 231-41.

Plain narration is only one of the means to appeal to myth. Often myths are simply alluded to, for instance by referring to an appropriate mytheme or by merely quoting names of mythological characters (gods, demons, biblical personages). These allusions, themselves frequently garbled and obscure, present a major challenge to students of ancient magical texts, especially when a myth is otherwise unknown or imperfectly known. They raise, moreover, the question whether an ad hoc mythology could be concocted to fit the occasion.4 How free were magicians to embroider upon, to change or even invent mytho-logical material to make it suit their own purposes? Instead of dealing with these questions on a theoretical level, I propose to 1 I wish to thank the University of Kansas Endowment Association Fund for its financial support during the Kansas conference on Magic in the Ancient World. 2 For a fuller treatment of the historiola, see D.

Even though examples are few in number, they can afford us some idea of what magicians may do with myths.5 *  *  *  Judaism, in the last few centuries BCE, saw the rise and diffusion of myths describing a primeval fall of angels to account for the existence of spiritual beings opposed to both God and the human race.6 These myths acquired vital importance for the development of Christian theodicy and indeed for Christian doctrine as a whole, which may explain their rapid spread and durable impact. In Chris-tian Egypt, too, they enjoyed great popularity. What may be the oldest of these myths, that of the angelic Watchers who fell through lust, deriving from Gen 6:1-6, was, in Coptic mainstream literature, soon superseded by two others.7 According to both of these accounts the devil was originally an angel, even God's first creature (cf. Job 40:19, LXX, on Behemoth). He revolted against divine authority and was expelled from heaven to become the plague of humanity. Both, however, give different motives for his apostasy. In the first and best known myth, the story of Lucifer, it is the devil's pride which makes him aspire to be the equal of God and which triggers his fall. In the second myth, his fall is inti-mately connected with the creation of human being. The angels are summoned to adore Adam, God's own image and likeness, and Satan alone refuses. He claims to be superior to humanity both because of his priority, being created first, and because of his spiri-tual nature, Adam being created out of matter. 5 The term \"myth\" is used here in a strictly neutral and technical sense to de-note any more or less sacred narrative with authoritative and programmatic values, without any judgment on its veracity or inherent qualities. 6 Cf.

Their ultimate fate within the Church, however, differed. The \"Refusal-myth\" was eventually rejected as \"unorthodox,\" although it lost its authority only gradually. In Egypt it remained the object of polemical attacks until well into the 10th century. Probably it owed both its popularity and its \"smell of unorthodoxy\" to its occurrence in two widely read apocrypha, the Life of Adam and Eve and the Questions of Bartholomew* The Lucifer-myth, on the other hand, prevailed, from the 3rd-4th century onward, as the \"orthodox\" version. Among the Fathers, Origen is credited for its classic formulation.9 In a passage like De principiis I, 5, 4-5 (Crouzel & Simonetti, SC 252, 182-94) he succeeds in molding his exegesis of Isa 14 (on the king of Babylon), Ezek 28 (on the prince of Tyre) and Job 40-41 (on Leviathan) into a coherent account of diabolic nature and origins. These are indeed the very biblical texts which shaped the Coptic Lucifer-myth. It is usual in earlier Christian tradition for the story of Satan's fall to take its place either in haggadic Adam-literature or in exe-getical developments of the Genesis-story, for example in hexae-mera. Coptic sources, however, following the lead of earlier Jewish accounts, turn it into a primarily angelological myth. As a rule, the real protagonists of the story are the great archangels whose popular cults represent a deeply rooted and typical aspect of Egyp-tian Christianity.10 Even puristic Shenute (4th-5th cent.), when alluding to Satan's fall in his Diatribe against the Devil, betrays those characteristic angelological interests.11 In Coptic as in older sources, the devil's great opponent is almost invariably St. Mi-chael.12 The Refusal-myth especially brings out in an effective 8 For the Life in Coptic Egypt: M Nagel, La Vie grecque d'Adam et d'Eve: Apocalypse de Moïse (Lille: Univ. de Lille m, 1974), 2. 101-04; M.

Michael s prominent role accounts for the conspicuous military element in the Coptic myths of the fall. Often Satan is depicted as the original com-mander-in-chief of the heavenly armies, who was replaced by Michael only after his apostasy. He is a deserter as well as a rebel, and upon his fall he is stripped of the insignia of his angelic rank and given diabolic counterparts instead. His transgression is often the sign for general warfare between loyal and disloyal angels. This \"first war in heaven,\" as it may be called, mirrors the eschatologi-cal war of Rev 12:7-9, Michael being the hero of both battles.13 Satan's defeat can be solemnly sealed by Michael's investment with the highest commandership. In spite of this angelological perspective, the Coptic myths did not lose their value as a model explaining the origins of evil and evil beings. Within the celestial world Satan's revolt gives rise to a dramatic split. For the first time good and bad powers find them-selves opposed and even at war. The fall of the wicked angels, who are cast out of heaven, accounts for the genesis of a demonic order, an army of evil spirits haunting the lower world or inhabit-ing the pagan idols. For Satan, moreover, just as for humanity, the fall has deep ontological implications. As he turns away from God, he is not just kicked out of heaven, but he also becomes fundamen-tally \"alien,\" excluded from divine grace.14 This is well summed up by the Apocalypse of Elijah. There, Enoch and Elijah, returning at the end of time to combat the Antichrist, address the latter in the terms of the Lucifer-myth and thus mark him as the very villain who fell from heaven in the beginning. Their speech underlines his enmity towards \"the angels and the thrones,\" his perennial \"alienation\" from the heavenly world, as well as the \"change\" (turning from light to darkness) which befell him and his kin.15 27-30, 106-11; J.

The destitution of the devil and his host conditioned their perpetual animosity not only toward the loyal angels but also toward the human race. This is most evidently so in the Refusal-myth. Since Adam provided the occasion for Satan's downfall, Satan would naturally try to bring about Adam's fall. In popular apocryphal books like the Life of Adam and Eve and the Questions of Bartholomew, which inspired the Refusal-myth, the devil liter-ally poisons man. In the latter work, Satan, cast down upon the earth, decides to avenge himself. He collects sweat from his breast and armpits and mingles it into the source of the rivers of Paradise. Drinking from this mixture, Eve gets infected with desire (έπιθυμία), which the Life of Adam calls \"the root of all sin\" (Greek 19:3; cf. Jas 1:15). Only now Satan can seduce her.16 Egyp-tian magicians were well acquainted with the poisoning-myth of the Questions of Bartholomew. Thus, one Coptic love-spell (British Museum Or. 10376)17 aims at provoking in a particular \"daughter of Eve\" \"this desire (έπιθυμία) which Mastema18 pro-claimed loudly (?)19 and which he threw down into the source of the four rivers and with which he drenched (?)... 20 in order that the children of humanity would [drink] thereof and be filled with the devil's desire\" (15-18). Another text (Heidelberg inv. nr. 518) directly invokes the devil who '4went down into [the source of] the rivers and filled them with passion and desire and [ ] and wickedness and love and longing and madness.\"21 These texts bring us back to our subject: magic. 16 Questions IV, 58-59 (Bonwetsch, 26).

M. Kropp after a lost Heidelberg manuscript (inv. nr. 1686).22 Michael himself addresses God: \"... I am Mi-chael! It's me, indeed, who attended to the seven mysteries hidden in the heart of the Father which he performed on the day he created human being according to his likeness and his image (cf. Gen 1:26). After he had created Phausiêl, I came, I, Michael, with all my followers, and we worshipped Atôran, to wit the work of his hands. When we worshipped Arômachrim, that is Adam, Sanatael was disobedient to you. The first creature (^ρΧΗΠλόνΟΛόν)23 you excluded from your holy glory. The son of perdition (cf. John 17:12; 2 Thess 2:3) you excluded from your holy glory, and you shook his foundations. He brought over them (sc. humanity) a great disease so that they did his will. Afterwards he overpowered the human beings whom you created. Afterwards <you> will heal them. Now then, my Lord, have mercy on your likeness and your image, and grant healing to everyone who will carry this holy laudation\" (Kropp, 17, 32-44). In this version of the Refusal-myth,24 Michael and all his angels worship the newly created Adam, who receives several magical names. Only Satanael (here, with a metathesis found elsewhere, Sanatael)25 refuses and is robbed of his celestial dignity. In revenge, he strikes humanity with disease in order to gain power over him. This account appears more or less directly dependent on the Ques-tions of Bartholomew, one of the sources of the Refusal-myth. This seems to be the case, first of all, because of the name Satan-ael. According to the Questions, this was the angelic name of Satan which he bore before his fall (IV, 25; Bonwetsch, 22). Secondly, this dependence seems indicated by the reference to the \"disease\" 22 Der Lobpreis des Erzengels Michael (Brussels: Fondation égyptologique Reine Elisabeth, 1966); for a second MS: M. Pezin, \"Les manuscrits coptes inédits du Collège de France,\" Ecriture et traditions dans la littérature copte, Cahiers Bibliothèque Copte 1 (Louvain: Peeters, 1983), 24-25. 23 In Coptic a frequent epithet of the devil, deriving from Job 40:19, LXX (on Behemoth); cf A.

Thirsty for revenge, Satan—as we saw—infected Eve with desire (έπιθυμία), which allowed him to seduce her. In the present spell, too, the \"disease\" serves as a way of forcing humanity to perform Satan's will, that is, to sin. In our text, Michael pleads before God in his characteristic role of protector and advocate of the human race, thus counteracting the one who, according to the myth, is its prototypical detractor, the devil. His address reminds God of the high dignity of human-kind, on God's behest adored by the angels, and of the healing due to his violated image. The habitual military prowess of Michael does not come to the fore here, but rather his equally traditional care for human health.26 The \"image and likeness\" formula, as a claim on divine protection (cf. Gen 1:26, but esp. Wis 2:23-24), is a standard element not only in angelic intercessory prayers for humanity, but in healing rituals and exorcisms as well.27 The \"disease\" in the myth acquires a double meaning here: the focus shifts from the primordial, moral disease inflicted by Satan to any disease which might, at present or in the future, befall the bearer of the formula. The mention of \"the son of perdition\" may well be a reminiscence of another text implying divine protection, viz. Jesus' prayer in John 17, where \"those watched over\" are con-trasted as a body to the son of perdition who, alone, went to ruin (17:12).28 The devil's exclusion is opposed to humanity's (desired) inclusion in divine protection. At the magician's level, Michael's active sympathy is claimed on account of the strong bond which unites him with the human race from the very beginning. Michael is said to have \"attended to the seven mysteries hidden in the heart of the Father which he performed on the day he created humankind\" (32-33). In accor-dance, again, with the Questions of Bartholomew IV, 53 (Greek; Bonwetsch, 25), this phrase might be taken to refer to Michael fetching the elements (earth and water) out of which Adam's body 26 Michael as a physician already in Life of Adam & Eve (Latin, ch. 41); see further Rohland, Michael, esp. 27-32 (on the Life) & 80-86 (Coptic sources); Baumeister, \"Höhe,\" 199. 27 Examples in angehe prayer Life of Adam & Eve (Greek, 33:5 & 35:2); M.

Details like these bring out the legitimacy of Michael's intervention on behalf of human-ity, while at the same time enhancing, within the ritual context, the authority of the magician. The latter, by showing himself in the possession of \"angelic\" knowledge, raises himself to the super-human level of his model. A passage from the Prayer of the Virgin in Bartos in British Mu-seum Or. 4714, edited by W. E. Crum,31 appears likewise depend-ent on Coptic Michael-lore. Within a narrative framework, bor-rowed from the apocryphal acts of the Apostles, it presents a series of invocations put in the mouth of the Virgin Mary. Fol-lowing a prayer to Christ, the archangels Gabriel and Michael appear at the Virgin's side. Gabriel introduces first himself, then his companion: \"Mary said, 'Who is that one with the golden scepter (βάρδος) in his hand?' And he (Gabriel) said to her, 'That's Mi-chael, the leader of the entire host of the angels.' She then raised a sweet voice and said, '1 conjure you today, Michael, I conjure you by my son, he who took the scepter from the hand of Mastema, and it was entrusted to you, and you were invested with a famous name.32 I conjure you and I will not leave you at peace before you 29 Elsewhere ascribed to Gabriel or to several angels; cf L. Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1946-47), 1.54-55; 5.71-73 (72 n. 15: seven substances employed in the composition of Adam's body); Kropp, Zaubertexte, 3.45-47. There is no trace here of the Gnostic devel-opment of this mytheme. 30 The seven mysteries may be connected with the seven words exchanged between the Father and the Son when the latter descended into the world to create Adam (according to 49-50). The terminology, however, points to the divine performance of celestial liturgy, a motif dear to the author of the text (see especially 45-48 & 75-79). Adoring the \"hidden mystery\" is a principal liturgi-cal task of the seven archangels (Müller, Engellehre, 9-10 and 138, nr. 15). According to 1. 226, the seven archangels \"stood by\" when God created Adam. Actually, our phrase may mean nothing much more, pace Kropp, Lobpreis, 64. 31 \"A Coptic Palimpsest,\" Proc.

May all impure spirits withdraw from him and each of them go to its (proper) place through the power of our holy prayer'\" (Cram, 213-14). This invocation of Michael over water and oil has clear liturgi-cal antecedents.33 It opens with a piece of myth which recalls a familiar scene from Coptic angelological literature, viz. Michael's investment.34 Following his apostasy and defeat, Satan was stripped of his rank and insignia, among which was his scepter.35 These were given to Michael, who was made commander-in-chief \"of the entire host of the angels\" instead. His solemn installation was supposed to have taken place on the 12th of Hathôr, in the wake of Satan's fall (situated at sunset on the 11th). Although this train of thought was severely censured by, among others, the 6 th-century bishop John of Parallos, Michael's investment on the 12th of Hathôr continued to be commemorated in Coptic liturgy.36 In our spell, the \"golden scepter\" changing hands epitomizes his victory over the devil and his hosts. That this episode is evoked in a ritual against demonic diseases and \"impure spirits\" appears highly appropriate. Another ritual against demons, Rossi's Gnostic Tractate, may likewise allude to the angels' primeval combat against the hosts of redazione etiopica délia Preghiera délia Vergine fia i Parti,\" Rendiconti Reale Accademia dei Lincei, serie 5a, 5 (1896): 457-79. 33 Cf.

The epithet \"first creature\" (όφΧΗΠλόΧΛάν) recalls Satan's original priority among the angels and thereby the drama of his fall. By its repeated use in this \"battle-chant,\" the magician may have claimed the first war in heaven as a paradigm for the present one.38 If in the preceding examples, taken from spells against demons and diseases, the magician sides with the loyal angels, elsewhere he may have his reasons for choosing the opposite party. In a Berlin love-charm (P. 8320) demons and the devil himself are invoked in what may be called a \"demonic epiclesis,\" pronounced over a philtre.39 At the end of a series of demonic voces, which open the invocation,40 there appears \"Satanas, the devil, he who beat the earth with his staff against the living God, saying, '1 am a god too.'\" The text continues, \"I implore and invoke you all today that you may come for me over these [vessels?] which are près-ently in my hands in order that, at the moment I will give them to NN and she will eat or drink from them, you will bind her heart and her flesh to me for ever\" (2-7). Here \"Satanas, the devil\" is identified by an allusion to his re-bellion against God, epitomized in the acts of beating the earth with his staff and proclaiming himself equal to God, \"a god too.\" This last motif, as has been recognized by Rosenstiehl (\"Chute,\" 40), pertains to the Lucifer-myth. It occurs in other Coptic ver-sions of the myth of the fall as well41 and derives from such key 37 Text in Kropp, Zaubertexte, 1.63-78, after Carl Schmidt's copy of the lost Turin ms.; the same, with an English translation, in M. W. Meyer, Rossi's \"Gnostic\" Tractate (Inst, for Antiquity and Christianity Occasional Papers 13; Claremont: LAC, 1988). It is neither Gnostic nor a tractate! 38 As was first suggested by Kropp, Zaubertexte, 3.82 & 95. Kropp surmised that these refrains originate from a hymn celebrating St. Michael. However, Gabriel's role as a warrior is well attested, see for example 1 Enoch 40:9; Origen, De principiis 1,8,1; Müller, Engellehre, 36-47. ^9 Text after A.

Beating the earth must have had the same provocative meaning. In a Coptic love-spell ascribed to Cyprian of Antioch, the latter describes how he challenged God by deliberately offensive and diabolical behavior.42 Thus he snorted through his nose, a grave blasphemy imputed elsewhere specifically to the rebellious devil,43 and \"struck the earth with (his) foot.\"44 Beating the earth, either with your feet or with a stick, was for-mally forbidden in Shenute's monasteries as a habit of \"the Chal-deans\" and of \"lazy people lacking culture.\"45 Shenute's \"Chaldeans\" could refer to magicians stamping the ground with their foot, a practice well attested by Demotic rituals.46 From a traditional Egyptian point of view, the forbidden behavior had definitely Typhonian overtones.47 Rather than referring to a specific mythical episode, the act of \"beating the earth\" brings out a boldness and a recklessness as befits the prototypical rebel. An even more compact allusion occurs in another erotic spell, edited by W. E. Crum after Strasbourg ms. copte 135.48 Here a spirit, invoked in order to make a rival impotent and prevent his intercourse with a certain girl, is thus addressed: \"Keuentios-Patilos-Kous-Makous, he who fell from his invisible chariot (?)49 and was cast50 into outer darkness, bind and fasten the penis of (NN), son of (NN)\" (2-5). Otherwise obscure names are connected with a mythical episode of fall and banishment in outer darkness, which scarcely fits anybody but the devil himself or one of his angels, as was already observed by Crum.51 Riding a celestial (\"invisible\") chariot was part of Satan's former archangelic glory,52 which stands in marked contrast to his present infernal 42 Heidelberg inv. nr. 1684, 47-70 (Bilabel & Grohmann, Texte, 306-07). 43 Cf. esp.

In fact, such emphatic contrasts are a constitutive element of the myth of the fall from its very beginning (cf. Isa 14; Ezek 28). That \"Keuentios\" etc. are diabolical names is confirmed by other spells of aggressive erotic magic, which invoke diabolic assistance even more overtly. In the last two texts, the allusions to the myth may be said to outline the character of a demon invoked. In the following exam-pies, the myth is quoted once more in support of the ritualist's overall design. Quite explicit is a spell for separating a couple, a diakopos, from a Heidelberg manuscript (inv. nr. 103 0).53 It urges \"Belso[bo]ul (Beelzeboul)54 the strong one\" to separate the two victims from each other \"like Joseph and his brothers\" (cf. Gen 37) and \"like the devil who separated himself from God and the angels\" (recto, 10-17). In Christian literature and art, the story of Joseph and his brothers had become, from Acts 7:9 and 1 Clem. 4:9 onwards, a stock theme exemplifying envy and hatred.55 Sa-tan's rebellion and fall are, according to the Coptic accounts, specifically acts of alienation and exclusion, ensuing lasting hostil-ity. In separation spells like the present one, exactly these aspects acquire a paradigmatic value. Another diakopos, Louvre Ε 14.250, edited by E. Drioton, shows the same principle at work.56 It is written on a sheet of parchment cut in the form of the blade of a knife or sword. The actual text (there are drawings too) is made up of four formulae. Two (recto nr. 1 and verso) consist essentially of series of demons' names, followed by a request to cause discord between a man and a woman. A third one (recto nr. 2) addresses an unnamed demon who, following the burial of the phylactery near the gate of a possessed a \"chariot of light MOVdviH ),\" which after his fall is trans-ferred to Michael. Michael's chariot: ibid., 24 & 25; Laudation of Michael, 1. 3 (Kropp, 13). On the chariot's symbolism: M Malinine, et al., Epistula Jacobi Apocrypha (Zürich and Stuttgart: Rascher, 1968), 75-78. 53 V. Stegemann, \"Neue Zauber- und Gebetstexte,\" Mus 51 (1938): 74-82. 54 Thus probably in 2-3; 1. 1 perhaps contained one or two more names (a vi-gnette shows two demons, personifying [?] respectively \"destruction\" and \"hatred and dispersion\"). For Beelzeboul's hand in envy, murder and war: Testament of Solomon 6:4 (McCown, 26*). 55 In Coptic literature: J. Zandee, \"Iosephus contra Apionem: An Apocryphal Stoiy of Joseph in Coptic,\" VC 15 (1961): 193-213, esp. 212-13; Coptic textile depictions of Gen 37 are undoubtedly apotropaic scenes against envy (the evil eye), pace L.

The last one (recto nr. 3) invokes a demon named Apolle, plausibly a phantom of the Greek god Apollo who figures elsewhere in Coptic \"black magic\".57 His image, laid under the head of the male victim, should again produce \"hatred and separation.\" In the third and fourth spells the magician, urging the demon to do his job, identi-fies himself with a third person who claims expertise in separation. In the third spell these self-proclamations are heavily damaged58; in the fourth one they run thus: \"I am the strong one (? -ΚόφτδΑΟΝ),59 the one who separates a brother from his brother; it's me who separates a bride from her husband. I am the strong one (?), the one who separated Pharaoh from his nation through the multitude of his powers; it's me who incited Judas against Jesus so that he was crucified on the wood of the cross; it's me who soared up to heaven and exclaimed, 'eloï-eï-êlemas, I am a god too!'—I then, I implore and invoke you today, Apolle, in order that ... (etc.)\" (26-33; Drioton, 485). There can be little doubt that, to judge from his credentials, the expert in separation whose authority is claimed by the magician is none other than the devil himself. The \"multitude of powers\" through which he separated Pharaoh from his people definitely refers to the Book of Jubilees' characteristic rewriting of the Exodus story, which makes \"Prince Mastema\" responsible for Pharaoh's stubborn resistance and its evil consequences. Thus, according to Jub. 49:2, not God himself but \"all the powers of Mastema\" went out to smite the firstborn of Egypt (contrast Exod 12:12).60 The treachery of Judas is directly ascribed, from Luke 22:3 and John 13:2 & 27 onwards, to the influence of Satan. Finally, the one who \"soared up to heaven\" (cf. Isa 14:13-14) and claimed to be \"a god too\" (cf. Ezek 28:2) must be Lucifer in per-son.61 His rebellion which, as we saw before, was very much inter-57 E.g., Bilabel & Grohmann, Texte, 331,1. 52 (next to Zeus and demons). 58 One may conjecture: \"I am [the strong one, the one who] separates a friend from <his> friends; I am [the one who separated the waters of the] sea; I am the one who separates (NN), son of (NN), from (NN), daughter of (NN)\" (13-15; Drioton, 482); 1.14 could refer to Exod 14:21. 59 Very uncertain translation. I hesitate to accept Drioton's reading jpp-τάριον, \"small leaf of papyrus,\" possibly designating the phylactery itself (\"Parchemin,\" 486, η. a). With equal hesitation I propose to read καρτερόν (sc. δοαμόνιον or πνεύμα), which as the epithet of an angel or demon would correspond to common Coptic Αύύίϋρε, \"strong one.\" 60 Cf. M. Testuz, Les idées religieuses du Livre des Jubilés (Geneva: Droz; Paris: Minard, 1960), 81-86. 61 As was recognized by Rosenstiehl, \"Chute,\" 40.

At least one of the demons invoked in this spell carries a tradi-tional magical name. fidOCOVX, usually interpreted as \"Soul-of-darkness,\" is an Egyptian vox, familiar, with many variants, from earlier pagan magic.65 Nevertheless, the ßdOCOVX and 61KAM of our spell are no stray \"survivals.\" They acquired a new and specific mythical role. Their combat against \"the angels and the cheru-bim,\" as a consequence of which they are thrown out of heaven, identifies them definitely as rebellious angels who, during that \"first war in heaven,\" as it can be called, sided with Satan.66 This devil's exclamation is introduced by \"eloï-eï-êlemas\"; for the use of these words in Coptic magic, see Kropp, Zaubertexte, 3.128. 62 Text: Bilabel & Grohmann, Texte, 329 & pl. 7 (left). 63 This drawing is extensively discussed by I.

As prototypical trouble-makers, these rebellious angels are direct successors to the turbulent god Seth-Typhon.67 Indeed, although partly written in Arabic, our spell represents a remarkably traditional type. For its structure and terminology, it may be usefully compared with—for example—the far earlier Greek diakopos of PGMXII, 365-375, which has Seth for its protagonist.68 The mythological background of Egyptian magic may have changed, far less so its aims and techniques. A papyrus from Cologne, nr. 10.235, edited by M. Weber, ex-ploits in a more subtle way the disjunctive elements in the myth of Satan's fall.69 In this spell the magician solicits the means to exert social influence, for both good and evil purposes (cf. 1. 23), from a spirit whose name is lost.70 The latter is thus addressed: \"I invoke you today in order that you may come to me in this place wherein I am for you and that you reveal yourself to me, [that I see] you face to face and that you talk with me mouth to mouth,71 together with your two decans, namely Archôn and Lamei,72 and bring to point out Typhonian connections. Neither are the \"guardians\" (επίσκοπος) in the last Une likely to refer to the έγρήγοροι of the Watcher-myth; the epithet έπίσκοπος too has its traditional background in Greco-Egyptian magic; see Th.

Again I invoke you today in order that you may bring to me the disgrace and the hatred which the Father pronounced upon the head of Satan, to the effect that he excluded him and expelled him [.. .]\" (5-17). Two diametrically opposed moments of separation are evoked: Christ's mission into the world (a scene extrapolated from the Gospel of John)73 and Satan's fall from his celestial station. At first sight, this antithesis may seem reminiscent of those ancient series of paradigms which oppose divine reward to divine punish-ment (an old Christian example is 2 Peter 2:4-9). In such a con-text, the rebellious angels, who were cast down into hell (2 Peter 2:4; Jude 6), could be contrasted with Enoch, who was translated to heaven (cf. Gen 5:24; Heb 11:5).74 In the present case, however, not reward and punishment as such are opposed, but the divine feelings aroused by those two different scenes of farewell: love vs. hatred, favor (χάρις) vs. disgrace. These pairs of opposites appear again in the spell's final invocation, followed by a longer series which includes \"binding-unbinding,\" \"killing-making alive,\" \"collecting-dispersing,\" \"establishing-expelling\" (31-35). To make the range of manipulatory faculties he wants to dispose of as inclusive as possible, the magician asks for the two most sharply opposed extremes of divine emotion. At the negative pole of this rhetorical scheme, Satan's fall summarizes in mythological terms rejection in its most complete and radical form. * * * In exploiting material from the myth of Satan's fall the Coptic magicians invented very little. They merely adapted motifs from a 73 For the Johannine quotes: Weber, 60-61.

Their often sophisticated adaptation of the myth shows that so-called magical texts had firm roots in literary culture. Whatever vagueness may sometimes obscure the identity of the mythical characters or the mythical (narrative) situation appears to stem from conventions imposed by the ritual context rather than from the magician's over-excited imagination or from imprecise knowledge. Thus the use of magical names which are unknown from other accounts of the myth of the fall will have been dictated by a ritual context in which the magician wished to impose his authority. Moreover, the myth is as a rule alluded to rather than recounted. A mere slogan (\"I am a god too\") may evoke the entire story more suggestively than a long abstract. A certain way of purposely blurring the mythical image is indeed proper to ritual and rhetorical discourse, as opposed to plain narra-tive. An instructive example is provided by a fragment of Shenute who, reprimanding his monks for unchastity, states that \"Satan was thrown out of heaven for seeking to perpetrate his abomina-tions.\"75 He is not recounting an unknown variant of the myth of Satan's fall, but merely tells his audience that if they will be \"seeking to perpetrate their abominations\" within the monastery, they will be kicked out. As for its exact role within the magical ritual, the myth of Sa-tan's fall appears to be a multi-functional one. The devil, even when called by phantastic names, can be identified as that primeval mischief-maker by means of a reference to his myth. Although such a gloss may contribute but little to the ritual's argument, it brings out the devilishness of the personage invoked, and in curses and aggressive erotic spells this can be quite appropriate. Beside this labelling function, the myth acquired a twofold paradigmatic value. The first paradigm is closely connected with the figure of St. Michael as the traditional opponent of the devil. In exorcisms and healing formulae the myth represents the primordial defeat of evil spirits, which serves as a model for the magician's hie et nunc, where he too is fighting evil, demonic powers. The second para-digm takes another view: it presents the myth of the fall as the drama of the primordial split within the celestial world and features the ensuing exclusion and hostility. Exactly these aspects deter-mine the magician's appeal to the myth in rituals aiming at sepa-rating people. Both the \"exorcistic\" and the \"disjunctive\" para-75 W. E.

They are shallow bowls of varying size, inscribed with binding spells and invocations, and dating roughly from the 5th to 7th centuries CE.1 The bowls have been classified by their languages and scripts into four main types: Judeo-Aramaic, Mandaean, and two varieties of Syriac. The \"magic\" of the bowls, drawn from the available apotropaic and exorcistic practices of the region, claims to protect a person, family or household from demonic intrusion by declaring a \"seal\" upon the particular persons or places which expels or incapacitates evil forces.2 This practice was \"available\" in the sense that no institution had exclusive authority over its use, and it was adopted by various religious practitioners in the service of their clientele. The bowls survive, therefore, as artifacts of religious competition and rival claims to power.3 The variations in script and content among the bowls show that the technique was employed by Jews, 1 James A. Montgomery, Aramaic Incantation Texts from Nippur (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press,1913), 103-04; idem, \"The Original Script of the Manichaeans on Texts in the Museum,\" The Museum Journal, University of Pennsylvania Museum 3 (1912): 25. 2 \"The text of the bowls very often talks of chaining and pressing the evil en-tities; at the same time it may also bid them go away, leave the house and desist from bothering the house owner. The bowl thus serves both to entrap the evil powers and to reject them; there is no real contradiction between these two propositions\" (Joseph Naveh and Shaul Shaked, Amulets and Magic Bowls: Aramaic Incantations of Late Antiquity [Leiden: Brill, 1985], 15). Self-referential designations found in the bowl texts are \"press\" (kibsha) and \"seal\" (hatma). 3 A wonderful testimony to this milieu is Isbell's Judeo-Aramaic bowl 49: \"And there will cease from this dwelling and threshold of this Parrukdad the son of Zebinta and of Qamoi the daughter of Zaraq, Aramean black-arts, Jewish black-arts, Arabic black-arts, Persian black-arts, Indian black-arts, Greek black-arts, black-arts of the Romans, black-arts which are practiced in the seventy languages, either by woman or by man\" (Charles D. Isbell, Corpus of the Aramaic Incanta-tion Bowls [Missoula: Scholars Press, 1975], 113)."},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"Mandaeans, Christians, and—perhaps—Manichaeans.4 Eighty years ago, James Montgomery of the University of Pennsylvania discovered that one of the two Syriac scripts found on the bowls was identical, for all intents and purposes, to the script used by the Manichaeans.5 Because the content of the bowl inscriptions written in Manichaean script was not doctrinally significant, nor even definitively attributable to Manichaeans,6 Montgomery's discovery has never been followed up and its rami-fications for the history of Manichaeism have never seemed worth pursuing. But a réévaluation of Montgomery's discovery is over-due. Put simply, are these bowls Manichaean, and did the Manichaeans practice \"magic\"? *  *  *  To the cultural establishment of the Roman and Sasanid Em-pires, the Manichaeans who came pouring into their respective realms from Mesopotamia in the 3rd century CE were both de-tested and feared, and they were subject to suspicion and suppres-sion. As objects of loathing and dread, the Manichaeans had but two options by which to survive and advance. The first option was to assimilate, to mask strangeness and learn to speak with a famil-4 The various languages and scripts of the bowls are indicative of the \"magicians\" who prepared them; their clients are not necessarily of the same ethnic or religious community. In fact, the majority of the bowls were apparently prepared by Jewish \"magicians\" for Persian or non-Jewish Semitic clients (Naveh and Shaked, 17-18). In several cases, the same client has in his possession bowls from different traditions, hedging his bets, as it were, by covering himself with power from as many sources as he could arrange (see note 38). 5 Montgomery, 1913: 32-34. Allotte de la Fuye apparently reached the same conclusion independently, but did not report his findings until 1924 (\"Une coupe magique en écriture manichéenne,\" CRAIBL [1924]: 388-99). The Manichaean script is known from extensive texts in Iranian and Turkic languages recovered from Turfan and surrounding locales in Central Asia, smaller Syriac fragments recovered in Egypt, and a single crystal seal found in Mesopotamia reading, in Syriac, \"Mar Mani, the Apostle of Jesus Christ.\" 6 Montgomery concludes that \"there are no Manichaean traces in the bowls\" (1913: 35); cf. \"Original Script ...,\" 28. But it should be pointed out that the position taken by Montgomery and merely repeated by all who have addressed the question since—that the script represents the source from which the Manichaeans developed their own—is untenable. The Manichaean script is traceable to the 3rd century, and hence predates the bowls by as much as three centuries.

The Manichaeans were masters of assimilation, aggres-sive translators, consummate dissemblers. Their reputation in this respect is well established in the history of religions. The second option was to accentuate the exotic, cultivate dread, play upon fear and insinuate power barely held in check.7 The Manichaeans did indeed accentuate their exotic character, not only by claiming citizenship in a supercelestial paradise of light but also by embracing an earthly aura of antiquity, wrapping them-selves in the geographic prestige of Babylon. In late antiquity \"Babylon\" had acquired the reputation of an exotic and portentous land.8 This reputation held true not only in Greco-Roman but also Persian xenology; but in the west it was heightened by the addition of Persian exoticism to the ages-old legend of Babylon.9 Mani, a Parthian totally acculturated to Mesopotamia, used its reputation to best effect in his self-descriptive statements. A biographical text has him declare to the Persian emperor Shapur, \"I am a doctor from Babylon\" (M566 I), and in a self-revelatory poem, he emphasizes his links to the \"gateway of God\" (bab el): \"I originated from the country of Babel and at the gate of truth I am placed ... I was led away from the country of Babel so that I should call out a call in the world\" (M4). In the catechism he wrote for Shapur,10 the Shabuhragan, Mani makes his Babylonian heri-tage key to his prophetic identity: \"this revelation descended and this prophecy came in this last era in the figure of myself, Mani, the apostle of the true God in the country Babylon.\" This special relationship to exotic Babylon is promoted in western Manichaean sources as well. The Coptic Homilies call Mani \"the great presby-ter of the country of the great Babylon\" (54,13-15) and \"the 7 A role of the exotic in the bowls is suggested by the observation that they appear in many cases to have been manufactured by \"magicians\" of one religious tradition for the use of people belonging to another religious tradition. 8 See A.

Pseudonymous literatures of \"Zoroaster,\" \"Hystaspes,\" and \"Ostanes\" thrived in the Greco-Roman market. In the 2nd century, the Chaldaean Oracles did for Babylon what the Hermetic literature was doing simultaneously for Egypt—they rehabilitated the aura if not the substance of a politically subjugated but ancient culture. 10 In this he follows an epistolary tradition in Hellenistic magical literature of \"magician-to-king\" instruction. See Jonathan Z. Smith, \"The Temple and the Magician,\" in God's Christ and His People: Studies in Honor of Nils Alstrup Dahl, eds. J. Jervell and W. Meeks (Oslo: Universitetforl., 1976), 234.

Mani's titles and claims were both prodigious and polyvalent. Religious titles in the ancient world in no way precluded scientific, medical or magical authority. The categories we take such trouble to distinguish were completely permeable in late antiquity. Jacob Neusner has described the rabbis of Mesopotamia in this way: \"They were not merely teachers and judges, therefore, but 'holy men,' who talked to the dead, cursed or blessed effectually, mas-tered occult sciences, healed, and read the secrets of the stars.\"11 Neusner's description is especially appropriate to our subject because of its Babylonian milieu. Mani's various titles place him as heir to the collective wisdom of Babylon.12 Did this wisdom include bowl magic? *  *  *  Did the Manichaeans practice magic? The opponents of Manichaeism, quite predictably, assert that they did. Both the Roman and Sasanid Empires were paranoid, aggressive socio-political orders. The Manichaeans became a disruptive presence in both realms by competing with sanctioned religious institutions and overturning established social norms.13 Diocletian's rescript at the end of the 3rd century defined the Manichaeans as a \"new and 11 Jacob Neusner, The Early Sasanian Period, A History of the Jews in Baby-Ionia (Leiden: Brill, 1966), 2.143-44. 12 Likewise in rabbinic sources, where \"the rabbi emerges as a wonder-working sage, master of ancient wisdom both of Israel and Babylonia, and privy to the occult. He was believed able to cast an evil eye, to consort with the dead, and to interpret the signs and omens not only of the stars but also of the animal and natural world ... His advice covered every aspect of human affairs ... He was learned in the medical traditions of his region, and achieved a wide reputation as an interpreter of physiological phenomena ... such a man would well find venera-tion among the people in his lifetime, and for the dust of his grave after death\" (Neusner, 147). The figure of Samuel bears many of the same categorical ambigui-ties as Mani, his near contemporary, as already observed by Otakar Klima, Manis Zeit und Leben (Prague: Tschechoslowakische Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1962), 145. \"Like the other leading rabbis, Samuel was a sage, physician, astronomer, and magician. He interpreted omens; like Rav, was able to bring death upon those who made derogatory remarks about him, or angered him, and he was believed to (be) able to communicate with the dead ...\" (Neusner, 2.137). 13 Zoroastrian literature depicts the Manichaeans as the antithesis of Persian values, hating everything good, loving everything bad. In the terms of religious hyperbole, Mani was an incarnate demon (druz astak—Denkart 3.200).

See Ramsay MacMullen, Enemies of the Roman Order (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1966), 124-25; Theodor Mommsen, Römisches Strafrecht (Leipzig: Duncker and Humblot, 1899), 640. 15 Mosaicarum et Romanum Legum Collatio 15,3. The anti-Manichaean edict fits into Diocletian's deliberate revival of Roman \"patriotism\" and tradi-tional values, which first manifested itself in the legal sphere by the anti-astrology edict of 294, and culminated in the edict against the Christians in 302. 16 Legal historians have yet to agree on the basis for Diocletian's violent suppression of the Manichaeans; some emphasize the religion's link to Persia, while others note its characterization as a \"magical\" practice. The punishments prescribed fit very closely those appropriate to sorcery (Sententiae receptae Paulo tributae 23.15-18); but burning was also applied to traitors (Digest of Justinian 48.19.8). The distinction may prove academic, since the foreign is by definition magical, the magical by definition foreign, and the common denomina-tor of both tags is their sociopathic character. In any case, the punishments ordered for the Manichaeans do not fit those applied to \"new sects or religious observances unknown to reasonable men\" (SrPt 21). 17 The edict of May 30, 428 (Theodosius and Valentinian to Florentius, Prae-torian Prefect, 16.5.65) is most explicit: \"[T]h0se who have arrived at the lowest depths of wickedness, namely, the Manichaeans, shall nowhere on Roman soil have the right to assemble and pray ... since no opportunity must be left to any of them whereby an injury may be wrought upon the elements themselves.\" Cf Cod. Theod. 9.16.5 against \"magic arts employed to disturb the elements\" issued by Constantius. 18 Ambrosiaster (Comment. ad II Ep. Tim. 3,6) even quotes the edict of the (pagan, anti-Christian) emperor Diocletian in his characterization of Manichaeism."},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"chicanery\" (66.13.6-7). Mani himself, Epiphanius adds, \"was acquainted with, and wrapped up in, the practices of the magi\" (66.88). C. H. Roberts points out an allusion to menstrual magic in an anonymous late 3rd-century epistle against the Manichaeans from Egypt, which warns that Christians must \"be on our guard against these who with deceitful and lying words steal into our houses, and particularly against those women whom they call 'elect' and whom they hold in honor, manifestly because they require the menstrual blood for the abominations (musagmata) of their madness.\"19 In formulae of abjuration, converts from Manichaeism were in-structed to recite, \"I anathematize all the Manichaean books...as full of sorcery (hoia goëteias ousan anapleo) and paying homage to the devil their father\" (Seven Chapters [Cod. Vatopedinus] 2,50). The convert must verbally reject \"their abominable and magical prayers\" (7,216f.)20and \"their abominable and unclean and magic-filled mysteries\" (7,219f.).21 The polemical depiction of Mani which enjoyed the widest circulation in the church, the Acta Archelai, wraps the heresiarch quite literally in the mantle of a barbarian sorcerer.22 The author calls Mani a \"barbarian priest and crafty coadjutor of Mithras\" (40) and reports a scandalous biogra-phy which makes him heir to a line of discredited conjurers.23 None of this should surprise us. The accusation of magic is a 19 C. H.

We can be just as confident that when examining Manichaean literature, we will find accusations and condemnations of magic aimed back the other way; and we do.25 Very little historical weight can be given to such polemical characterizations. For greater historical precision, it is necessary to avoid generic categories such as \"magic,\" and to speak instead of specific prac-tices of apotropaic or exorcistic character. Elsewhere I have dem-onstrated that Mani was as much physician as prophet, and that medical concepts and functions were part of both his identity and his ideology.26 \"Magical\" practices must be added to this mix, since practices subject to the label \"magic\" were intrinsic to the majority of medical efforts in late antiquity. Such practices earned their polemical designation precisely because they were a set of tech-niques cut loose from sanctioned ideological moorings and trans-mitted across cultural boundaries. The same methods of mundane \"salvation\" were utilized by diametrically opposed parties of relig-ious rivalry, but were considered \"magic\" only in the hands of an opponent or the culturally \"other.\" Manichaean literature shows Mani active in the role of exorcist and magical healer. In the Coptic Manichaean Psalm-Book, Mani's voice is characterized as \"The cry of a physician, the cry of a spell-looser\"27 (220,26); he is directly addressed as a \"spell-looser\" 24 David Aune, \"Magic in Early Christianity,\" ANRW, 2.23.2: 1523. 25 Manichaean ethical instruction from various points of missionary geogra-phy unanimously condemns the \"black arts.\" The Xuastuanift confession, recited by congregated believers, classifies \"black magic\" (yilwi) as a sin (VIB). The prohibition (of sihrun) is repeated in the Manichaean moral code recorded in Arabic sources (e.g., Fihrist). In western Manichaean tracts, the prohibition is explicitly against mageia, and is given all the more force by the term's ambigu-ous reference to both \"black arts\" and the practices of the notoriously persecu-tory Zoroastrian hierarchy (cf. Homilies 11.15ff.; Kephalaia 31,25f.: \"magic rites and «)ells of darkness\"; 31,30: \"magic rites of error\"; 143,13ff.). 2° \"A Regimen for Salvation: Medical Models in Manichaean Asceticism,\" Semeia 58 (1992): 109-34. 27 p.hrau n.ou.seine p.hrau n.ou.balhik."},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"(balhik) whose \"healing is not of this earth\" (221,1 f.).

I am the spell-lifter (p.ref.tihik), but you are the striker, the one who lays low. (221,7f.) Just as he first presented himself to the Persian court as \"a doc-tor from Babylon,\" Mani made his last defense at court solely on the basis of his medical-magical services: Many and numerous were your servants whom I have [fieed] of demons (dyw) and witches (drwxs). Many were those from whom I have averted the numerous kinds of fever. Many were those who were at the point cf death, and I have revived them. (M3 V) His disciples, too, displayed such powers.28 Some may suspect this to be pure performance, an appeal to be-nighted, superstitious masses by crafty missionaries. But a close examination of Manichaean doctrine reveals the degree to which this \"magical\" work was integral to the religion as a whole. Manichaeism portrays the world as a battleground between gods and demons, upon which the Manichaean elect roams, half warrior and half medic. The enemy is an army of 140 myriads of devils (Xuastuanift IB), and salvation depends on the overthrow of their control within the body.29 In the Cologne Mani Codex, Mani makes the medical-magical power of laying on hands (cheirothesia) a centerpiece of his divine commission, fully equal to his doctrinal teachings (64,8-11; 70,1-4). In all these sources, Mani is shown actively appropriating and using practices of power available to him from the fragmented and 28 E.g., Adda on his mission to the Roman Empire: \"He performed many mira-cles and (displayed) miraculous powers in those countries\" (M2). 29 The primordial awakening of human consciousness is depicted as an exor-cism: \"The bright Jesus came near to the ignorant Adam, and awakened him fiom the sleep of death in order that he might be saved from the many spirits. And like a man who is righteous and finds a man who is possessed by a powerful demon and appeases (salli) him by his art ('ummanuta), such was Adam like when the Beloved found him, when he was plunged in a heavy sleep, and made him move and shook him, and chased away from him the seducing demon, and took from him into bondage the great female archontess\" (Theodore bar Konay, from Geo Widengren, Mesopotamian Elements in Manichaeism (Uppsala/Leipzig: A.

But unquestionably Manichaean texts recovered in Central Asia display remarkable similarities to the bowls. M781, published by W. B. Henning as one of \"Two Manichaean Magical Texts,\"40 contains a spell against fever which instructs, \"cast a spell in water ... and ashes.\"41 The text adds, \"[if the spirit of fever] does not go [of its own accord], then it will come out [of the body] of NN. son of NN. and vanish in the name of the Lord Isho Aryaman,\" and includes a list of other spiritual beings, including Michael, Raphael and Gabriel.42 This text of certain Manichaean prove-nance follows the general compositional pattern of Montgomery's bowl 34, and could be construed as instructions for the inscribing of such a bowl, or a similar apotropaic device.43 The second spell found in M781 unleashes the Zoroastrian divinity Thraetona (\"Fredon\") who promises to smite \"all the occult things (razart) of the house, all the evil spirits of the house, all the wrathful 'robbers' of the house.\"44 Such a spell functions exactly like the bowl texts and addresses the same concerns as those found in the bowls. Another Manichaean magical text published by Henning is an amulet (zawar) which bears on one side a list of demons (yaksas), giving the name, hour, country, number, and food of each one. The other side of the amulet reads, ... in your name, by your will, at your command, and through your power, Lord Jesus Christ; in the name of Mar Mani the life-giver, the exorcistic healing. 39 Michael, Gabriel and Raphael are three of the most popular angels through-out late antiquity, and turn up together again on amulets from the Cairo Geniza (Naveh and Shaked, 219, 225, 237) and in the PGM (90.1-13).

Tech-niques such as the magic bowls are taken up and modified by syn-thesizing, syncretizing traditions, not made whole-cloth by those traditions. The existing technique already has its own conventions of composition, application and concern which are worked on by new encompassing systems but also resist such reshaping. Certain beings and words of power cross over all bowl types, others are peculiar to a single type. We can see tendencies in the bowls—e.g., the choice of script, vocabulary reflective of a particular commu-nity—but such tendencies do not instantly wash away the basic rules by which these devices are made and used. So nothing in the Manichaean-script bowls (other than the script itself) definitively identifies them as Manichaean, and nothing in them precludes Manichaean composition. Yet we have seen from sources of unquestionable Manichaean provenance that the Manichaeans used apotropaic and exorcistic techniques, that they invoked apotropaic powers, and that they were concerned with \"sealing\" individuals and groups against demonic attack.51 Regardless of our ability to identify the bowls definitively as the products of Manichaean hands, both the bowls and the Manichaean \"magical\" texts employ the same invocational technique and derive from a shared cultural environment and view of human existence. *  *  *  Jonathan Z.

Other \"magical\" Manichaean fragments are known, but have not been edited: M341b, M389, M5568, M7917, M8430. 51 Analogous to such \"magic\" is the central Manichaean discipline of the \"three seals\"—of hands, mouth and breast—which are \"knots\" of control, regulating the transmission of power between the body and the (potentially dangerous) outside world: \"these sure seals that are upon thee, Ο soul, by reason of which no demon can touch thee\" (Psalm-Book 52.28-29). 52 Jonathan Z.

Smith describes as a shift from the \"locative\" to the ״Utopian\"—that is, rather than fix the world, Manichaeans seek to escape it by a transforma-tion of themselves.54 Peterson55 and Segal56 have both noted this attitude of escape and transformation in the materials of the Greek magical papyri; and this attitude is what some scholars have called the religious element in late antique magic. But we could just as well call it, in the case of Manichaeism, the magical element in the religion. The label is irrelevant: in either case we are dealing with specific techniques for overcoming demonic control, both on this earth and ultimately beyond it. Narratives from the Near East in late antiquity show us a world intensely concerned with power and protection, and filled with rival purveyors of sacred security and \"salvation.\" All sides of this religious rivalry employed rites which were liable to the tag \"magic\" at the hands of their opponents.

Within their respective religious systems, these prac-tices were validated and legitimized, but from outside such systems the same practices were disparaged and condemned. The label of \"magic\" is a product of this context of rivalry, and once we step outside the rivalry the category entirely evaporates. What remains are various ritual acts, various rites of power which are \"available\" across the boundaries of individual religious communities, but which are customized by, and more or less integrated into, each commu-nity differently and, from their point of view, exclusively. Manichaeism is itself an exorcistic and apotropaic practice, a technique of exorcising or suppressing demons in the body and \"sealing\" the body against renewed attacks. This technique should be construed not as a metaphor for some \"spiritual\" truth, but as an actual, \"magical,\" literal transformation of the body.57 The promise of such power must certainly have gained broad appeal in the late antique world awash in a sea of demons. The Manichaean elect could scarcely have avoided disseminating their power to the needs of their followers if they were to compete for allegiance with other powerful figures and institutions. They may have appropri-ated the concrete forms of such power dissemination, such as bowls or amulets, from the domestic practices of converts; or perhaps institutional Manichaeism itself developed out of just such prac-tices.

First, many of Priscillian's followers were wealthy aristocratic women. Second, Priscillian was an established and powerful bishop, whose road to execution was marked not by explicit accusations of magic but by allegations that he subscribed to Gnostic and Manichaean heresies. This essay looks anew at the Priscillianist affair in an effort to tease out the curious relation-ships between magic, women, and heresy, and to ascertain what appeared magical to the fourth-century Christian mind. On the whole, modem scholarship has either not addressed the specific questions of magic or has treated magic as a legal device in the persecution of heresy.2 Heresy was not a capital crime, but magic was, prompting Gibbon's verdict that Priscillian was the first heretic to be executed by the state,3 a judgment which has been frequently repeated.4 More recent studies, however, have shown 1 I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. N. B. McLynn, who supervised my initial research on Priscillian, and to H. M. D.

Champion, 1909); J. Davids, De Orosio et Sancto Augustino Priscillianistarum Adversariis (The Hague: A. N.

It is now clear that Priscillian,s teachings and practices, though often unusual, fell within the tolerated norms of ancient Christian orthodoxy.5 Thus, research has turned to sociological and anthropological theory for aid in explaining the accusations of magic and heresy which occa-sioned Priscillian's demise.6 According to this latter approach, accusations of magic and Manichaeism functioned within a system of \"community dynamics\" as measures against those whom the community was unable to assimilate.7 The tools of anthropology have been a boon to historical re-search. But in the case of the Priscillianists, at least, rigid applica-tion of functionalist models has yielded two problems. First, it has led to the assumption that because the Priscillianists were accused of magic they must therefore have been marginal. Second, by focusing solely on conflicts of power, it has neglected the very real theological conflict, obscuring the Priscillianists' affinities with Manichaeism and Gnosticism.8 That is to say, the functionalist approach has pre-empted the question of how Priscillianist prac-tice and doctrine may actually have appeared magical and hereti-cal to fourth-century observers. The accusations of heresy and magic against Priscillian cannot be fully accounted for as a conflict between \"articulate\" and \"inarticulate\" power.9 Priscillian was a well-educated urban aristo-erat who with shrewd manipulation of the imperial power structure was able to frustrate his persecutor Ithacius at almost every turn.10 Priscillian was openly supported by at least five fellow bishops, and possibly counted as informal supporters such prominent ecclesias-5 H.

Thus, we must look again at the case of the Priscillianists in an attempt to determine why this bishop, famous for his female devotees, was mistaken as a purveyor of magic and heresy. In charting a possible matrix of relationships between magic, women and heresy, I hope to shed greater light not only on the Priscil-lianist affair, but also, through tentative generalization, on how 11 Explicitly Priscillianist bishops were Instantius, Salvianus, Hyginus, Symposius, and Vegetinus (Sulp.

The evidence is somewhat problematic. For the most part, we are dependent upon texts outside of the Priscillianist circle. Coun-cils and chronicles—both contemporary with and several centuries after the affair—are hostile to the Priscillianists almost without exception.15 The Priscillianist texts themselves, discovered in Würzburg just over one hundred years ago, can hardly be called magical texts in any remotely conventional sense. The field is thus tricky, and many conclusions will be more approximations than demonstrable certainties. The earliest source of our information on the teachings and practices of Priscillian is the Council of Saragossa, held probably in October of 380.16 The canons of the council make no mention of magic, but are nonetheless of great interest as our earliest and probably most accurate external account of the beliefs and prac-tices that later were to be construed as magical. The councils initial concern is social and ecclesiastical impropriety. Canon 1 censures women for visiting the houses of men to whom they are not related to attend \"readings\" (lectio) for the purpose of \"instruction and discussion.\" The readings themselves are appar-ently not suspect. But canon 7 implies that unauthorized persons are being permitted to teach. And the unauthorized teachers may have included laymen and possibly laywomen; the Priscillianist writings affirm the spiritual equality both of clergy and laity and of men and women.17 The central concern of the Council of Saragossa, however, was unconventional religious practices: fasting on Sunday and with-drawing from consecrated churches during Lent (canon 2), accept-ing but not consuming the Eucharist in church (canon 3), and abandoning the churches and walking barefoot during Advent and Epiphany (canon 4). While magic is not specifically alleged, many of these charges may have carried with them connotations of magic in a fourth-century milieu.18 15 For this reason, in part, my account concentrates on the evidence closest to the affair both in time and geography. Chadwick, Priscillian, gives a full account of all the relevant ancient and medieval sources. 16 PL 84.315-18. The council drew bishops from as far away as Aquitaine. 17 E.g., Prise., Tract. 1.28, 14-24, Canones 55, 61, 39, 48. 18 The other canons decry the acceptance of excommunicants at the altar (5), excommunicate clergy who abandon their duties to become monks (6), and censure virgins who take vows of celibacy and service before the age of forty, or who do not do so formally in the presence of a bishop (8)."},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"Fasting on Sunday—a feast day of celebration—would have smacked of ascetical excess as well as Manichaeism, and may have been seen as having magical associations not identified with asceti-cism more generally.19 Fasting was held to have magical potency and was an important preliminary part of pagan and Christian rites and visions, as well as theurgic possession by the divine.20 The Priscillianists' habit of fasting on a feast day prompted great abhorrence.21 Those outside the sect may have suspected an alter-nate purpose—magical ritual in conjunction with the traditional mass. The withdrawal from established churches carried even more se-rious connotations of magic. Canon 2 expresses suspicions about the apparent Priscillianist practice of retiring to mountain hidea-ways and stealing away to strange villas. Several imperial rescripts condemn those who spurn Catholic congregations, whether for heretical or pious purposes.22 How far these laws applied to Priscil-lian is not clear, for as bishop he was of course the authority of the local Catholic congregation.23 Imperial legislation issued in 382 forbids the convocation of \"secret and hidden assemblies (occultos . .. latentesque conventus),\" and an earlier rescript permitted \"ceremonies of a bygone perversion\" to be conducted, provided they were done so openly (libera luce).24 The Priscillianists' 19 On the Manichaean practice of fasting on Sundays, see Augustine, ep. 36.27. 20 Phny (NH 26.60.93) describes a cure which requires the patient to fast and a poultice to be applied by a naked and fasting maiden.

The countryside and mountains were considered to be the location of illicit activity generally.25 If the Priscillianists retired regularly and in secret to country villas and mountain cells, it is not surprising that they were suspected of magical practices. It is likely that the Council also saw magical connotations in the alleged Priscillianist practice of not immediately consuming the eucharistie elements. As early as the second century Justin Martyr felt compelled to defend the eucharistie rite against charges of magic, and Clement of Alexandria speaks of the transformation of the bread into \"spiritual power.\"26 Long venerated as the central Christian mystery reserved only for those initiated through bap-tism, the celebration of the Eucharist became more elaborate in the fourth century and took on a stronger sense of the effects of consecration.27 John Chrysostom described the Lord's Table as a place of \"terror and shuddering\" worthy of great awe and venera-tion, and Ambrose viewed the consecration of the elements as effecting a real change in the bread and wine.28 The consecrated elements themselves were thus increasingly considered to possess stronger and stronger supernatural power.29 Consecrated elements are known to have been taken home by early modem Christian 25 See CTh. 16.10.16 (399), where country temples are referred to as \"the mate-rial basis for all superstition.\" Many rescripts forbid heretical or superstitious assemblies \"within the towns\": CTh. 16.5.6 (381), 16.5.11 (383), 16.5.30-35 (396-402).

The practice of going barefoot, condemned by canon 4, was a recognized form of ascetic denial. But going barefoot was a more complicated issue in antiquity than we modems might imagine.32 Several late fourth- and early fifth-century sources make it clear that opinions differed strongly as to whether Christians were forbidden to wear shoes.33 At least one sect that preached that Christians were required to remove their shoes, after the examples of Moses and Isaiah, was declared heretical.34 Going barefoot was also widely considered to have strong associations with pagan ritual and to increase magical power. The Pythagoreans held that sacri-fice must be offered with bare feet, and some Roman processions were conducted without shoes.35 Going about with unshod feet may also have evoked suspicions of pantheism and thus pagan nature worship and nature magic. What is most striking about many of the canons of Saragossa, however, is the fact that the Council is at pains to proscribe cer-tain practices not in themselves, but at particular times during the ecclesiastical calendar. Hence, the Council does not condemn fasting per se, but on Sundays (die dominica). So too, the second canon is concerned that the Priscillianists were forsaking estab-lished churches for their mountain hideaways during Lent (quadragesimarum die). Going barefoot, canon 4 emphasizes, as 30 See Κ. V.

As we have seen, the practices condemned at Saragossa had strong associations with magic and indecency. But what most concerned the Council was the proximity of these practices to high Christian holy celebrations such as Christmas and Easter. While \"orthodox\" or at least permissible in themselves, many of the Priscillianists' deeds smacked too strongly of pagan magic when practiced concurrently with the most important Chris-tian celebrations.36 Whether the Priscillianists themselves crossed the line into magic is difficult to say.37 Though suspicious of Priscillian's activi-ties, the Council of Saragossa found itself similarly uncertain; the Council did not make specific accusations of magic, and Priscillian was not censured by name on any count.38 In the years after Saragossa, Spain and southern Gaul saw a con-tinuation of Priscillian's remarkable success. Driven from Spain by imperial command, Priscillian traveled to Rome and Milan and succeeded in having the rescript overturned. His episcopal nemesis, Ithacius, fled to Trier where soon a change in imperial politics would halt the Priscillianists' success. The usurpation of the throne by Maximus allowed Ithacius to resume his persecution. Priscillian and his followers were compelled to attend the council of Bordeaux in 384. Upon Priscillian's appeal to the emperor, the proceedings were resumed under imperial jurisdiction in Trier in 385.39 36 Not surprisingly, the Church was concerned to preserve the purity of its mysteries. Imperial legislation consequently forbids heretics to \"contaminate with profane mind the mystery of Almighty God (profanaque mente omnipoten-tis dei contaminare mysterium)\" (CTh. 16.5.26 [395]) and to \"present the false appearance of mysteries (mysteriorum simulationem ad injuriam verae re-ligionis aptare)\" (CTh. 16.5.15 [388]). 37 Such a judgment begs the question of defining magic and of its utility as a social scientific term, a dispute which I cannot engage here.

Sulpicius Severus does not record the specific complaints lodged against Priscillian at Bordeaux, but he does tell as the charges on which Priscillian was convicted at Trier. In these charges we find the most explicit conjunction of magic, women and heresy. Unlike most sorcery trials, Priscillian was given not one but two full and lengthy trials at Trier. The occurrence of a second trial suggests that Trier was not a kangaroo court and that the prosecu-tion had difficulty proving its case. But the double dose of due process was undoubtedly not welcomed by Priscillian; capital cases regularly employed torture and this case seems to have been no exception.40 In the end, Sulpicius writes, Priscillian was convicted of \"sorcery (maleficii), nor did he disavow that he had studied obscene doctrines (obscenis doctrinis), that he had convened, by night, assemblies of vile and indecent women (turpium feminarum) and that he was accustomed to pray while naked.\"41 Sorcery was a capital charge, and much more than peasant agricultural magic must have been proven to merit execution.42 It is likely that the seriousness of the charges derived from their conjunction. Separately, the charges may have merited only de-frocking or exile. Together, they constituted a dangerous threat. The study of \"obscene doctrines\" need not be taken in a strictly religious sense, though neither should that sense be excluded. Leg-islation concerning magic and astrology tolerated the holding of \"forbidden doctrines\" but strongly condemned the teaching of such doctrines.43 That Priscillian had studied these doctrines smacked of the promulgation of a magical sect with all its conspiratorial over-tones. The same imperial rescript of 370 equated the learning of magical doctrines with teaching them, and punished both by death. Priscillian was said to have been instructed by the disciples of a certain Marcus from Egypt, long recognized as a center of ancient magic.44 In the eyes of his accusers, Priscillian was educated in a 40 Sulp.

Assemblies at nighttime—such as those evidently practiced by the Priscillianists—greatly multiplied the appearance of magic. A rescript of 364 threatens with death those who engage in \"wicked prayers (nefarias preces)\" or \"magic preparations (<magicos apparatus)\" which take place \"during the nighttime.\"46 The further text of the rescript makes it clear that such nighttime assemblies were strongly associated with sacrifices to demonic forces. Had the Priscillianists gathered only during the day, the appearance of nefarious activity may have been reduced. Added to this, Priscillian was accused of praying naked. Nudity in antiquity was held to increase the potency of magic to a degree even greater than that accomplished by bare feet.47 Praying naked also evoked religious objections. Jerome chided Vigilantius for not covering himself before praying for safety during an earthquake, and a monk's improper attire after a bath drew a sharp response from Martin. In both cases, nudity was not only immodest but presumed a sinlessness that obtained only before the fall.48 If the Priscillianists were naked at secret nighttime meetings at which women were present, it is no surprise that charges of im-morality were leveled. We have noted already the suggestion of improper reading groups raised by the first canon of the Council of Saragossa. Knaves often pretended priestly station for purposes of seduction, and even pious priests took care not to visit women unchaperoned.49 Moreover, adultery was frequently held to be the result of magical intervention through the use of love spells and dova and the Origins of Priscillianism,\" Studia Patristica 1 (=Texte und Unter-suchungen 63, 1957): 601-06.

Priscillian was taught, we are told, by a wealthy Spanish woman named Agape, a disciple of Marcus the Egyptian and a purveyor of both magical and heretical doctrine.53 Women were often associated with pernicious doctrines in Christian antiquity, at least in part because of their presumed weakness of mind and character, though we must remember that positive appraisals of female ability are also common.54 The relationship between women, heresy, and moral turpitude among the Priscillianists is highlighted by the fact that the Manichees were widely believed to practice ritual orgies, to have meetings at which men and women prayed together naked, and to mix semen (a common ingredient in magical potions) with the eucharistie bread.55 And, like the Priscillianists, the Manichees were suspected of magic.

According to Pliny, women—naked and sine menstruis—can secure the safety of sailors. Menstruous women, Pliny continues, can drive away hail-storms and other bad weather by standing naked. Women even had the power of pesticides: when menstruous naked women walked through cornfields, agricultural pests fell dead.57 The womb, men-strual blood, and especially fresh embryos had magical power.58 Some measures were taken to moderate the presence of women in the mass; women stood apart from men in the ecclesia, and men-struous women were not to be baptized.59 The large number of women prominent in religious life in the fourth-century West suggests that women may not have been regarded as practitioners of magic in themselves. Nonetheless, it is significant that none of the miracles recorded by the biographers of Martin, Ambrose, or Augustine involves a woman.60 The mere presence of women seems to have increased the possibility of magic. Given the Priscillianist teaching of the equality of men and women and of clergy and laity, it is not inconceivable that Priscil-lianist women celebrated the Eucharist.61 We have no evidence of women celebrants among the Priscillianists, but the prospect of a woman celebrating the Eucharist at secret nighttime nude gather-ings would be a terrifying prospect indeed for a fourth-century observer. Like fasting and bare feet, then, it was the proximity of women to \"orthodox\" religious activities that compounded the appearance of both magic and heresy.

Priscillian mentions the \"crimes of sacrilege\" (sacrilegii nefas) of which he has not, he emphasizes, been formally accused: harvest rituals involving \"magical incantations (magicis praecantationi-bus)\" and \"evil invocations (maledictis)\" to the sun and moon.64 The relatively benign nature of this accusation of agricultural magic led Chadwick to speculate that Priscillian had probably been present at a peasant harvest rite.65 What Chadwick suggests is not impossible; Priscillian's followers included \"many common peo-pie,\" and the success of crops was of prime interest to most nobles and farmers alike.66 But while magic in general was not uncommon among the wealthy and well-educated of the late fourth century, it would indeed be odd for peasant agricultural magic to have played a prominent part in the religious lives of the many well-educated Priscillianists.67 A charge of agricultural (i.e., \"white\") magic, moreover, would have had little shock value.68 Most important, such a charge was of 62 For a full listing of the extant Priscillianist texts see Chadwick, Priscillian, xiii. 63 The eleven Priscillianist Tractates were discovered in a codex in the library at Würzburg in 1885 by G.

An imperial rescript of the early fourth century explicitly exempted from prosecution magic used innocently in rural areas to prevent the natural destruction of crops by rain or hail. The church, for its part, was intent on extending its mission to the countryside by demonstrating Christ's power—sometimes in the form of a holy man—in the protection of crops and animals. The presence of Martin of Tours protected nearby farms from a hail-storm, and cattle were apparently branded with the sign of the cross to preserve them from plague.69 Perhaps more troubling was an amulet worn by Priscillian and described in the first Tractate. The amulet bore the name of Christ in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, with the words \"King of kings and Lord of lords,\" together with the image of a lion.70 Such an amulet is not at all unusual; a large number of Christian amulets survive, and the Priscillianist amulet is illustrative of superstition common to pagans and Christians alike.71 The title itself occurs several times in scripture, and the occurrence of Christ's name in Hebrew, Greek and Latin (as Priscillian himself reminds us) recalls the inscription above Christ at his crucifixion.72 The amulet is clearly designed to emphasize Christ's supreme power in warding off hostile demonic and magical forces. The lion is both an emblem of great strength and an appellation of Christ, \"the Lion of the tribe of Judah\" who has conquered and is worthy to break the seven seals of the scroll.73 The Apocalypse frequently identifies the Lion with the Lamb to denote Christ the conquering sacrifice.74 Recording 69 CTh. 9.16.3 (317-319).

Priscillian is himself apparently aware of this—he takes pains to defend his use of the lion image (\"sed nobis leo non est deus\") by means of allegorical interpreta-tion.77 The Gnostic mythological tradition also associated the lion with the lord of creation and, especially among Gnostic ascetics, with sexual desire and cosmogenic sexual passion. Indeed, the lion was regarded as particularly sexually charged quite apart from Gnostic circles and would have reinforced the perception of Pris-cillianist immorality.78 For our purposes, then, the amulet becomes symbolic of the intersection of Christianity (the proclamation of Christ as \"King of kings\"), magic (the amulet itself), heresy (the Gnostic lion) and women (the lion of lust). The third Priscillianist Tractate (Liber de fide et de apocryphis) does not specifically mention magic but nonetheless enriches our understanding of the relationship between magic, women, and heresy.79 The Priscillianist devotion to the reading of apocryphal scriptures itself smacked of heresy, and Manichaeism in particu-lar.80 But the importance of the apocryphal—and canonical— scriptures for Priscillian lay in their symbolic function as texts for allegorical exegesis.

Women are especially prominent in the Apoc-ryphal Acts, making the Priscillianist defense of apocryphal scrip-tures triply dubious in the eyes of critics.82 The peculiar character of the Priscillianist conjunction of magic, women, and heresy is made clear when we compare Priscil-lian to his contemporaries. St. Jerome, driven from Rome in the 380s by considerable opposition, was never formally accused of magic though he had a large following of ascetic aristocratic women and was later tainted by Origenism.83 The venerable St. Ambrose was associated with no fewer than 12 deaths—many more than any recorded Roman maleficus—yet he suffered no indict-ment for magic.84 The miracles of St. Martin of Tours frequently bear resemblance to pagan nature magic.85 Nonetheless, in spite of severe opposition to Martin's asceticism, the bishop of Tours faced no accusations of magic but was instead revered as a holy man, indicating just how difficult it is to distinguish between holy man and magician in late antiquity. Given the marked opposition which Jerome, Ambrose, and Mar-tin encountered, a functionalist model would lead us to expect charges of magic against them; we do well to remember that their enduring reputations were peppered at the time with the most dangerous fluctuations. Nonetheless, most of Priscillian's contem-poraries escaped the shadow of sorcery; only three other fourth-century bishops were accused of magic.86 Indeed, what is most striking about accusations of magic in this period is the marked infrequency with which they are leveled. Priscillian's conviction at Trier has invariably been seen in modem scholarship as something of a surprise—an unfortunate 81 On Priscillianist exegesis see Babut, Priscillien, 115-35.

Far from being last-minute inventions, the charges of magic were persistent concerns for Priscillian's oppo-nents. What was insinuated at the council in 380 was made explicit by the trial in 385. Saragossa alleged heresy with tinges of magic; Trier convicted on charges of magic tinged with heresy. And while social and political pressures played substantial roles, no purely social explanation will suffice. We cannot exclude the possibility that the conflict stemmed from a legitimate dispute over what constituted the appropriate ritual and intellectual forms of worshiping and speaking about God.88 The motives behind the prosecution of Priscillian surely involved matters of personality and power, but fear of the prox-imity of tainted teachings and practices to orthodox worship suggests that genuine theological differences were of substantial importance. That Priscillian himself saw the conflict in largely theological terms is clear from his defense, where the question of magic is subsumed beneath the much larger question of cosmology and the \"object\" of religious devotion. The first two Tractates, remarkably silent on the question of magic, are dominated by the rejection of every conceivable heresy. Priscillian's rhetoric operates on a thoroughly theological plane. We would expect Priscillian to claim Catholic orthodoxy, but the two Tractates make clear two pur-poses: to refute the religious implications of the \"crimes of sacri-lege\" alleged against him, and to rebuke those theoretical views of the cosmos which invite the actual veneration of demons and give authority to astrology.89 One gathers from Priscillian's defense that magic concerned less the rituals themselves than the supernatural being (or beings) to whom one performed those rituals. That is, magic was seen as a matter of idolatry, as we see in Priscillian's denunciation of the Manichees: \"not heretics, but idolaters and wicked servants of the Sun and Moon\" (non hereticos, sed idolatras et maleficos servos 87A.

The implication is that heretics worship the same God wrongly, while magicians (like idolaters) worship another god entirely.90 In a world in which matters of doctrine—whether pagan philosophy or Christian teaching—profoundly affected the way one lived one's life, and in which the state of one's soul was of the utmost importance, it is of little surprise that Priscillian would see theological disavowals as encompassing a disavowal of magic. It is against this backdrop that the denials of the first Tractate becomes less of a puzzle and more clearly part of a calculated argument, directed in part against suspicions of magic. Magic, then, was a subset of broader theological concerns. Yet it would be incorrect to conclude that the distinction between magic and orthodoxy was the divide between \"our God\" and \"their god.\" For to view magicians and heretics in the single category of social outsiders does nothing to distinguish heretics from magicians. There is abundant evidence for heretics who were not magicians (nor was pagan magic strictly \"heretical\" until it touched Christian circles). Indeed, it is striking that in the Arian controversy the accusations of magic were lodged not against Arius, but against his \"orthodox\" opponent Athanasius, who was twice run out of Alex-andria under the shadow of sorcery.91 Can we go further in isolating the theological elements involved in the peculiar combination of Priscillianist practices and doctrines which contributed to suspicions of magic? The Priscillianist doc-trine of the soul, vegetarian and ascetical practices, and intense interest in numerology and astrology suggest a Neoplatonic mi-lieu.92 Neoplatonic influence on Priscillian would not be surprising given its provenance among educated aristocrats and the acknowl-edged dependence of the Priscillianist writings on Hilary of Poitiers, a convert from Neoplatonism.93 We have seen how the Priscillianist practices of fasting and going barefoot resemble pagan 90 Priscillian, Tract. 11.39, 9-10; cf. Origen, De principiis, 3.3.3-4. 91 Sozomen, HE 4.10: Socrates, HE 1.27-35; Amm. Marc. 15.7.7-8.

Pris-cillian does not seem to have participated in pagan rites, but his emphasis of earthly mortification and divine encounter may have involved pagan methods. And if the Neoplatonic element is près-ent in Priscillianist thought and practice, the Priscillianists may well have been viewed as having theurgical affinities, thus incurring the charges of both heresy and magic.94 In the absence of detailed examination along these lines (and such an examination would be useful indeed), this must remain the most speculative of suspicions. But the possible proximity of theurgic Neoplatonism to Christian worship fits well with our analysis of the relationship between magic, women, and heresy. Conjectures of Neoplatonism aside, Priscillianist asceticism and theological position are rightly seen as mystical.95 And while many will object that I have merely substituted one ill-defined term for another, it seems to me that mysticism is much more firmly rooted in human experience generally and is less likely than magic to have strictly pejorative connotations.96 And while a very fine line often separates magic and heresy on the one hand from mysti-cism on the other, my suspicion is that much of Priscillian's intel-lectual and religious appeal came from the latter rather than the former. How, then, are we to understand the puzzling relationship be-tween magic, women, and heresy? The answer lies, in part, in recognizing a genuine theological difference between Priscillian and his accusers. My suggestion is that the Priscillianist teachings and practices inclined to a mysticism which, to unsympathetic observ-94 On the ancient confusion of philosophers with magicians, see Apuleius, Apologia, 27; Socrates, HE 5.16, 3.1, 3.21.

Not all Neoplatonist philosophers were theurgists, and not all theurgists were philosophers. Many Christian Neoplatonists, among them Victorinus, Ambrose and Augustine, seem to have avoided the theurgical side of fourth century Neoplatonism. 95 \"[M]ysticism is the attempt here and now to partake of the eternal Reality which normally we expect fully to share only after death\": E.

It is easy to see how fasting in conjunction with the Eucharist, nighttime worship services, and mountain retreats would be seen as mystical piety by the Priscillianists, while judged to be heresy and pagan magic by opponents. It is significant that none of our sources attributes malicious \"black magic\" to Priscillian, and he probably did not practice \"magic\" in any way that we usually understand the term. The crucial point is that, to many of his contemporaries, he appeared to practice magic, for the reasons we have discussed. Any one of the Priscillianist practices—most of which were practiced singly by other prominent bishops—would have been insignificant on its own. It was the conjunction of these practices—fasting, going barefoot, meeting with women—with high Christian holy days, particularly in secret and at night, that was viewed as problematic. Imbedded in a theology directed towards a life of earthly denial and heavenly encounter, the Priscillianists were too close, when viewed from a distance by unsympathetic eyes, to abominable heresy and the abhorrent practice of pagan magic. Undoubtedly, the accounts of the Priscillianist affair which em-phasize the vagaries of orthodoxy and the importance of commu-nity dynamics have helped to extend our understanding of magic in antiquity. Our efforts at contextualization and desire to escape Whig historiography are indeed laudable. But in the case of the Priscillianists, the richer matrix of magic, women and heresy has been obscured by approaches which have neglected to consider fully \"the deeper substratum of convictions about the nature of the universe.\"97 We do well to remember that the issues, especially in the history of religions, are at least as much ontological as social, though not exclusively so.

In the following essay I will describe both the mechanisms by which historiolae were as-sumed to work as ritual utterances and the permutations of its form. Ultimately I hope this essay will be part of a larger enter-prise in the description and classification of magical language. *  *  *  Let me begin by offering some illustrations of what is meant by historiola. One of the most striking examples appears among the parallels that Alexander Heidel adduced for the Babylonian créa-tion \"epic,\" the Enuma Elish. It is an incantation for toothache, beginning, \"After Anu had created the heaven, (And) the heaven had created the earth,\" and following this sequence down to the creation of the worm. The worm proceeds to declare his prefer-ence for teeth and jawbones instead of the figs and apricots offered by the god Ea, at which point Ea, or the ritualist, or most likely both, declare, \"Because thou hast said this, Ο worm, May Ea smite thee with the might of his hand!\"4 Then the inscription gives instructions for how to recite the spell and what to put on the tooth. The recitation of the cosmogony itself is therefore meant to heal the tooth. A contrast to this cosmogonie historiola is the Greek Philinna papyrus, whose portentous references do not appear to have spe-cific mythological antecedents: \"The son of the most august goddess, the initiate, was scorched. On the highest mount he was scorched. The fire gulped down seven springs of wolves, seven of bears, seven of lions, but seven dark-eyed maidens drew water with 3 George Foucart, s.v., \"Names (Egyptian),\" Hastings' Encyclopedia of Re-ligion and Ethics (New York: C.

But we can begin to see four basic structural aspects of the historiola in the Philinna papyrus: (1) the past tense suggests that it describes events in mythic time; (2) in contrast to the Babylonian toothache spell, the Philinna papyrus shows that a historiola need not explicitly reflect a well-known mythological discourse like a cosmogony; (3) the lack of explicit application, in the Philinna spell, to a \"real-world\" situation sug-gests that the narrative's power is invoked by implicit analogy; and (4) the fact that this is the entire spell—lacking not only applica-tion, but also invocation or voces magicae —demonstrates that the magical power of the Philinna spell and its analogues is, indeed, contained within the narrative itself, not sacred names, symbols, or commands. These principles operate similarly in Egyptian magical spells. A spell against crocodiles begins like a folktale: Isis struck with her wing; she closed the mouth of the river. She caused the fishes to lie down on the mud-shoal; the waves do not immerse it. Isis became weary <on> the water; Isis arose on the water, her tears fel-ling into the water. See, Horus has had intercourse with his mother Isis! Her tears are falling into the water.... It is Isis that has recited, it is not a crocodile that has done so. Protection! Protection has arrived! (Borghouts #129) Another spell, intended to facilitate bird-catching, reads, \"Horus, son of Isis, ascended a hill in order to sleep. He sang his melodies, spread his nets, caught a falcon, a bank-bird, a mountain pelican.\"6 Other spells, such as those inscribed on magical stelae and statue bases, give lengthy and impassioned accounts of Horus' scorpion-sting in the Nile marshes, and his successful cure by the magical powers and incantations of the gods Isis, Re, and Thoth. These stories are told as events in mythic time, but are punctuated with dramatic monologues delivered by the various deities, giving the narrative a strong \"presence\" if heard aloud. Indeed, it seems that the central \"act\" in the Egyptian historiola is not so much a 5 Cf P.

A particularly large number of historiolae are collected from Christian regions. A Coptic amulet against snakebite declares, \"Christ was bora on the 29th of Choiak (or Dec. 25). He came descending upon the earth. He passed judgment on all the poison-ous serpents.\"9 A Coptic obstetrical ritual includes the following to be recited: \"[Jesus] came wandering [on] the Mount of Olives . . .

They saw king Herod, who said to them: \"Whence come ye, and whither are ye going?\" They answered: \"A king has been born in Bethlehem, and we have come to worship him.\" Then the star fell down in front of them; they went and worshipped the boy who had been born.

What is the \"theory\" of the historiola? At the very least it is clear that histo-riolae as forms of religious speech involve a \"mythic\" dimension of action; a \"this-worldly\" or human realm of problems or needs; and the speech act itself, which draws from the mythic dimension to apply to the human dimension. One might also note that histo-riolae most often are employed in healing spells (as opposed to love or curse spells), perhaps because situations of illness, accident, and childbirth were so dire in antiquity as to require more dramatic invocations of divine power than were possible with mere direc-tives, prayers or commands. Under various names the historiola has long been recognized in folklore and religious studies, although discussions have taken quite 19· Richard Gottheil, \"References to Zoroaster in Syriac and Arabic Litera-ture,\" Classical Studies in Honor of Henry Drisler (New York and London: Macmillan and Co., 1894), 31, in Joseph Bidez and Franz Cumont, Les mages hellénisés, 2 vols.

In his entry on \"Segen\" in the Handwörterbuch des deutschen Aberglaubens, the German folklorist F. Ohrt concentrated on the dynamics of its formal structure, consisting of (1) characters, (2) situation and focal action or words, and (3) application to the present condition.13 The situation is often a crisis (e.g., a deer in labor, swaddling clothes before the fire); and yet in many spells the recounting of this critical event is missing, so that the spell merely reports the focal words of power as they were delivered in illo tempore, with-out any frame or explanation. The focal action or words may appear in the spell as a past accomplishment, subsequently to be applied to the present, or as direct speech (such as the \"living\" dialogues between Isis and Nephthys in Egyptian spells), which effectively collapses the story with the reality of the performance. The application, Ohrt notes, functions linguistically like a sim-ile: \"... thus, just like the accomplishment described, so also let it happen now.\" In one form of application the historiola concludes with an invocation or prayer that is framed as the culminating speech of a character in the story (e.g., \". . . (that you, impaling object,) come out by the power of this prayer that Maria the virgin spoke outside the tomb: ... ,\" from a Coptic spell).14 By uttering the same vital invocation as the character in the story, the practi-tioner or client taps into the power of the entire story. However, the specific declaration to apply the historiola may be only im-plicit, such as an amulet inscribed with a healing account (or image) alone: a person in need of the same healing enacts the \"application\" by the very act of wearing it.15 Ohrtיs observations are based on the important principle that the historiola form is meant to replicate speech—in this case the oral \"telling\" of the historiola during a healing ritual—even in the case of those archaic examples extant only in written texts such as amulets or stelae. In the ancient preparation of inscribed amulets the order in which one uttered the words of power and inscribed them on papyrus, leather, or other medium could vary. The in-13 Cf. F.

One must remember that in a semi- or non-literate society written words are usually not sacred semanti-cally but rather visually—as concrete symbols.18 In classics and religious studies historiolae (though rarely by this name) have been scrutinized for their relationship to myth. So, for example, many classicists have regarded historiolae merely as applied derivations of more well-known narratives or macro-myths. If they find no evidence of a macro-myth, they conclude that the historiola must be, in Arthur Darby Nock's terms, \"invented ad hoc and recounted in magic with complete assurance as though canonical.\"19 But it is to the credit of historians of religions that the historiola has been unpacked as a functional aspect of ritual and not just derivative mythology. Van der Leeuw described a form of ritual speech called the \"magical antecedent\": An event that occurred in prehistoric times, and which now possesses a mythical eternity and typicalness, is by the power of the formula rendered present in the literal sense and made actual and fruitful.20 By this scheme it is the performative aspect of the historiola— its very utterance or inscription—that holds power; its function is 16 See, e.g., Roy Kotansky, \"Incantations and Prayers for Salvation on In-scribed Greek Amulets,\" Magika Hiera: Ancient Greek Magic and Religion, ed. Christopher A. Faraone and Dirk Obbink (New York: Oxford, 1991), 107-37. 17 E.g., PGM IV.2622-2707 typically distinguishes \"the name (to be) writ-ten\" (2636) and the logos, the spell to be uttered (2639). 18See David Frankfurter, \"The Magic of Writing and the Writing of Magic: The Power of the Word in Egyptian and Greek Traditions,\" Helios 21 (1994): 189-221. 19 Arthur Darby Nock, Essays on Religion and the Ancient World, 2 vols., ed.

Mircea Eliade refined this perspective to allow more slippage between the two \"periods\" of mythic time and the human present. Moreover, Eliade placed the \"power\" of the historiola not in the formula per se as Van der Leeuw, but in the very contents of the narrative: a citation of events and acts performed in cosmogonie time (like the Babylonian toothache spell). That is, narrative that describes \"creative\" miracle intrinsically contains the power of that creative miracle. And thus the recitation of such narrative for magical purposes draws those powers into present circumstances: \"the patient,\" Eliade suggests, \"is penetrated by the gigantic forces that, in illo tempore, made the Creation possible.\"21 (Of course, one need not limit this idea to cosmogonie historiolae, which were Eliade's own interest.)22 Insofar as \"magic\" at the very least concerns the manipulation of power, both Van der Leeuw's and Eliade's descriptions of histo-riolae offer quite useful outlines of the invocation of mythic episodes for their particular demonstrations of power. In fact, by understanding the historiola as the performative transmission of power from a mythic realm articulated in narrative to the human present, we might instructively include under the same rubric two other popular forms of amulets in antiquity: iconographie vi-gnettes (such as the holy rider figure or scenes from Christian legend) and the quotations and citations of scripture so common in Jewish and Christian amulets. Both express mythic episodes as continually powerful. The iconography on amulets and pilgrims' eulogia, as Gary Vikan has shown, functioned specifically to draw sacred power from a \"myth\" represented (e.g., a saint's legenda or gospel stories) into the realm of the wearer.23 While many such amulets held generalized, apotropaic value, at least as many were designed for specific ailments and problems.24 21 Mircea Eliade, Myth and Reality, tr.

Yet the problem with the Van der Leeuw-Eliade approach is precisely that it leaves unexamined the nature of this analogy that the historiola establishes between mythic time and present circum-stances.

The histo-riola's link between times is not as important as its link between a human dimension where action is open-ended and a mythic dimen-sion where actions are completed and tensions have been resolved. The historiola, as one Egyptologist puts it, \"formulates a rule that will exert an authority of its own on the events to follow.\"28 And this is obviously a dialectical process: confronted with an unre-solved situation, the ritualist formulates, out of traditional terms and characters, a precedent in which the same situation is resolved. We might describe the process as a kind of \"active analogizing.\"29 *  *  *  How then is the mythic paradigm, once \"narrated\" or developed in a historiola, assumed to work? Here I believe we can get some light from Speech-Acts theory. To begin with, I think we can agree, following Malinowski and Tambiah, that the very words of magical spells—and ritual speech in general—are meant to be efficacious, and are in fact efficacious in the social context of ritual.30 That is, the utterance \"performs\" the action desired. This principle is vividly confirmed for Egyptian ritual because of the very concept of \"utterance,\" \"word,\" \"written letter,\" and even \"magic\" itself in ancient Egypt; and it is probably true for all the Mediterranean cultures which drew upon Egyptian magic. In the terms of J. L. Austin, therefore, the magical spell becomes a per-formative utterance, insofar as \"the uttering of the words is . . . usually a, or even the leading incident in the performance of the act ... the performance of which is also the object of the utter-ance.\"31 27 Malinowski, Magic, Science, and Religion, 63-64; idem, Sex, Culture, and Myth (New York: Harcourt, Brace, & World, 1962), 291, 303-04. 28 Jorgen Podemann S0rensen, \"The Argument in Ancient Egyptian Magical Formulae,\" Acta Orientalia 45 (1984): 8. 29 Cf.

Therefore, lord, do the so-and-so deed by necessity, lest I shake heaven,\" PGM III.536-37), and, on the other hand, one which simply declares a situation as fait accompli (\"A foolish woman was sitting on a fountain, and she was holding a foolish infant in her lap. The mountains dry up, the valleys dry up, the veins dry up, even those full of blood,\" Heim 111). A more evoca-tive example of this declarative type of ritual utterance is the announcement on Easter morning: \"Christ is risen!\" It creates and simultaneously recognizes a certain reality.32 In this particular genus of speech act, a broadening of Searle's \"declarative\" cate-gory that Wade Wheelock designated \"situating speech,\" such an utterance as the historiola not only changes a particular element of the environment, it transforms the entire environment into a mythic situation.33 The difference between the directive utterance and the déclara-tive utterance seems to revolve around the active presence and authority of the ritualist or speaker. In the case of the directive utterance, which includes both prayer and magical command, the speaker's mind-set, preparation, traditional status, and purity are of paramount importance since the force of that utterance explic-itly comes from that \"I\" who says the words. On the other hand, the authority of the declarative utterance—at least insofar as it pertains to the historiola—derives from the content itself: the mythic events that are recounted.34 A good example of the histo-riola 's power independent of its speaker's status may be the magi-cal stelae and statue bases in Egypt, whose power to heal was commonly available to anyone who could pour water over them or touch them, since the power rested in the Isis-Horus narrative itself rather than in a priest's recitation of it.35 32 In general see Searle, \"Taxonomy of Illocutionary Acts,\" 355-56 (directives), 358-61 (declaratives).

If, as I have been arguing, the historiola, as a declarative utterance, \"works\" in a fundamentally different manner from the directive spell or invocation, then perhaps we should consider what to do with those spells which employ historiolae as part of a similia similibus for-mula—\"just as ... so also .. ..\"—for this formula puts the analogy between myth and application right out on the table. For example: \"Christ, who has multiplied the stars in the sky and the water in the sea, multiply also the fruits in the vineyard of Paul,\" reads an inscribed tablet from Sicily.36 \"As Typhon is the adversary of Helios, so inflame the heart and soul of Amoneios\" (PGM XXXIIa.l), reads a Greco-Egyptian love-spell.3\"7 In referring to \"myths\" like Christ's creation of the cosmos or Typhon's hostility to the sun, these spells are surely different from the kinds of instrumentally analogical formulae that we find in curse tablets, which draw upon concrete images like the coldness of lead, the heat of a fire, or the limpness of a rag on a dunghill to bind, kill, or orient 1, Travaux de la Maison de l'Orient 2 (Lyon: GIS-Maison de l'Orient, 1981), 147-50; Claude Traunecker, \"Une Chapelle de magie guérisseuse sur le parvis du temple de Mout à Kamak,\" JARCE 20 (1985): 65-92; Robert K.

However, the similia similibus struc-ture essentially subordinates the narrative portion of the spell to a directive utterance, the part that states, \"so also let it be that ....\" Thus the historiola, if we can still call it that, works in these cases as a guarantee or rationale, an explicit precedent, for the directive utterance, the command, which is the central speech-act in these spells. I would therefore make a preliminary distinction between those historiolae that function by virtue of their narrative—what I would call historiolae proper—and those that function as a subsidiary invocation to a directive utterance, a command or prayer—what we might call \"clausal historiolae.\"39 But having made this distinc-tion, I want to point out that few historiolae remain entirely aloof from the human, performative context—entirely implicit in their analogy to the present problem. *  *  *  The historiola invariably includes some specific links with the immediate ritual context in which it is uttered. The Egyptologist Podemann S0rensen has identified five of these links in Egyptian spells, but we can see them operative throughout ancient magical traditions.40 First, and most characteristically Egyptian, the ritualist himself may, in the course of narrating, enter the narrative by identifying himself as a god. The effect is, therefore, a collapsing of bounda-38 Cf. Christopher A. Faraone, \"Hermes but no Marrow: Another Look at a Puzzling Magical Spell,\" ZPE 72 (1988): 279-86; idem, \"The Agonistic Context of Early Greek Binding Spells,\" Magika Hiera: Ancient Greek Magic and Religion, ed. C. Faraone and Dirk Obbink (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991), 7-8; Sebeok and Ingemann, Studies in Cheremis: The Supernatural, 292-96, on categorization of similia similibus formulae. Faraone (\"Hermes but no Marrow,\" 284) proposes that the articulation of mythical precedent in historiolae is invariably expressed in past tense (e.g., aorist), thus distinguishing it from most examples of similia similibus formulae. But as the Egyptian spells illustrate, the linguistic representation of the \"realm\" of mythic precedent can be in any tense (just as \"myth\" in traditional cultures is rarely so distinct from mundane time as the aorist would imply). The similia similibus formula should thus be viewed as one possible way of \"applying\" historiolae. 39 Cf. Kropp, 3.218 (§374). 40 Podemann S0rensen, \"The Argument in Ancient Egyptian Magical Formu-lae,\" 9-13."},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"ries between the human situation and the mythical dimension; the historiola is effective not by analogy or precedent but by becoming dynamically real within the ritual context. A similar effect may be achieved in those spells using dramatic dialogue: \"Your son Horus has been burnt in the desert!\" \"Is there water there?\" \"There is no water there!\" \"Water is in my mouth, an Inundation is between my thighs. It is to extinguish the fire that I have arrived. Break out, bum!\" (Borghouts #35) Come out of your tomb, Christ is calling you! (PGAÍ XXIIIa.49) In both cases the mythical context of the speech is established in the performative situation simply by virtue of reciting the speech. Its inscription on an amulet would presumably imply the same dynamic. Second, the historiola itself may be, or include, an account of the genesis and initial use of a specific incantation within it, which is then used by the ritualist and/or written on an amulet. Ohrt had noted that a prayer or spell uttered by a character in a historiola would link mythical and performative dimensions when that same prayer or spell was uttered by the ritualist or the client. In late antiquity such a magical \"pedigree\" or \"genealogy\" had broad usage even beyond the framing of specific spells: from a Coptic spell that begins \"The binding words, which Elijah the prophet spoke upon the holy mountain ... ,\"41 to the introduction of the magical ascent text Sefer HaRazim, which traces the very text's origin back to Noah. Third, in a similar vein, the historiola may account for a sub-stance used in the accompanying ritual. In an Egyptian childbirth spell the god Horus describes a statue of the god Bes such as is required in the ritual itself (Borghouts #60, cf. 61). An Old Coptic spell for sexual gratification describes how the goddess Isis is ad-vised to procure \"a double iron nail with a ... head, a thin base, a strong point, and light iron. Bring it before me, dip it in the blood 41 P. Heidelberg 1682, 11. 29-30, in Bilabel-Grobman, 1934:394. See in gen-eral Malinowski, Magic, Science, and Religion, 55-57, 64; A.-J. Festugière, La Révélation d'Hermès trismégiste, 3 vols.

It is reasonable to assume that the accompanying ritual included some such instru-ment, even though this is not explicitly indicated in the extant instructions.42 In these cases it is the instrumental presence of the images in the rituals that \"situates\" the mythical dimension within the performative setting. Fourth, the link may be made with details of the specific prob-lern to be resolved. A Coptic spell describes the nature and origin of the lance which pierced Jesus' side at Golgotha, and then pro-ceeds to identify the lance with a penetrating object in the pa-tient's eye.43 Egyptian spells describe real scorpion poisoning in detail, but attribute the scorpion to the god Seth and locate the suffering in the child Horus. Thus the affliction itself is rendered mythical through a series of declarations, and consequently the power to cure the affliction also must belong to the realm of myth. Fifth, a link may be made by explicitly mentioning, within the narrative, the body of the patient or even his or her name. A common aspect of healing ritual in ancient Egypt was the \"mythical re-definition\" of parts of the body as different gods, who then themselves act in the historiola. A spell to protect breasts begins, \"These here are the breast(s) which Isis suffered from in Khemmis ...\" (Borghouts #64). But throughout Christian spells we find actual names included as dramatis personae in the recitation of historiolae or their preparation in amulets.44 A. A. Barb has discussed a medieval Greek charm against headaches that tells how \"Migraine came out from the sea rioting and roaring, and our Lord Jesus Christ came to meet it\"; when Jesus asks why Mi-graine brings so many ailments to humankind, he replies, \"We are going to sit down in the head of the servant of God, so-and-so\"— that is, the name of the patient. At this point Jesus himself com-mands, 42Cf. \"blood of Osiris\" as wine in PDM xiv.440-41. PGM IV.115ff com-mences an instrumental similia similibus formula \"persuasively,\" comparing the beloved's state to a fire to be made in a ritual brazier. This might suggest that the initial historiola in 11. 94-114 derives from another context (perhaps a revenge spell?). In PGM ΧΠ such \"mythical\" ingredients as \"Blood of Hephaistos,\" \"Semen of Hermes,\" and \"Semen of Ammon\" are translated into more common ritual substances (XII.401-44). 43 P. Rylands 102, in W. E.

The traditional approach to historiolae has always seen them as extrac-tions or applications of pre-existent \"myths,\" such that if one had the historiola one might dig down to the myth it came from. Barb and others have displayed their scholarly prowess by unveiling the \"myth\" behind some otherwise unrecognizable historiolae 46 Yet it is quite obvious that some historiolae refer to no over-arching macro-myths at all, but are compilations and syntheses of diverse lore. Even the Christian spells cannot be said to be direct citations of, or even allusions to, gospel texts. I would say that, as long as we regard historiolae as referring in some sense to a mythic dimension, we may need to redefine what we mean by \"myth\" in the first place. In many cultures \"myths\" as coherent narratives describing supernatural events do not exist except as ritual librettos which are implicitly or explicitly oriented toward the ritual context and its goals.47 For example, the so-called \"myth\" of Isis' rescue of the poisoned Horus to which the magical stelae seem to refer is only extant in such magical spells, as an extended historiola. That is to say, myths only exist in the form of ritual applications; the historiolae \"are\" the myths, rather than 45 F.

The one who composes the historiola cer-tainly considers himself or herself to be, in Theodore Ludwig's terms, \"fit(ting) the specific human circumstance into the larger pattern of sacred existence and power as known in the religion of the people.\"50 Thus at one level, historiolae bespeak tradition broadly conceived; and it is this \"traditional\" factor, the histo-riola 's recognizability, which establishes the historiola's performa-tive value and power—renders its utterance \"felicitous\" according to Speech-Acts analysis.51 But in another sense, historiolae are deliberate acts of blending that tradition—the symbols and motifs that constitute local authority and power—with both \"the specific human circum-stances\" and broader, more abstract concepts of power, cosmology, transformation, and identity. Indeed, they represent a hypostasiza-48 Cf. Marcel Détienne, \"Myth and Writing: The Mythographers,\" Mytholo-gies, 2 vols., ed. Yves Bonnefoy, re-ed.

Mary Mills' recent definition of myth as a \"basic cosmic framework ... [which] indicates where cosmic power resides, what it is called, and so how it can be used\" (in ritual), provides a descriptive model for the present problem, since historiolae become a distinct level of discourse, one which applies or directs cosmic power, while myth itself remains the general \"framework.\"52 However, I would extend Mill's model into several tiers: (1) the abstract set of concepts and relations that might crystallize around or into (2) certain figures, names, places, or folklore motifs according to a culture's current circumstances, and then come into being within (3) a variety of performative settings according to a variety of forms that range from priestly liturgy (like the Enuma Elish) to scribal mythography (like Plutarch) to historiolae, drama, sculpture, or painting. These latter genres are merely the articulations of myth; the myth itself remains at the /?re-articulate level, a condensation of social structure, morality, and existential concerns at the broadest level. The diverse articula-tions of a myth vary in scope and complexity according to their forms or genres of composition; the forms and genres, in turn, are immediately dependent upon the performative context: healing rite, festival recitation, amulet, etc. Finally, the specific terms, symbols, and motifs of composition (my level [2]) do not themselves constitute \"myth\" but rather the authoritative discourse of precedent in a given region at a certain time: stories, prayers, heroes and gods—a discourse that would certainly evolve through time (and particularly as a culture con-verted to Christianity or Islam). The concept \"myth\" therefore serves as a theoretical explanation of structural resemblances, links, and overall relationships among historiolae, liturgical récita-tions, texts, and other forms of mythical expression. *  *  #  How would this approach to myth work in the cases we have examined? The Philinna spell, far from being dependent on any single macro-myth, is evidently a pastiche of mysterious images and Mediterranean motifs composed ingeniously to \"tap into\" 52 Mary E.

It is important to recognize that, whatever the history of the motifs, historiolae themselves function in a present that requires only that they be recognizable. In their sometimes blatant syncretism the Christian spells have always posed an interesting test of one's concept of \"myth.\" In the case of P.Yale 1792, \"Christ was bom on the 29th of Choiak. He came descending upon the earth. He passed judgment on all the poisonous serpents,\" we see not a synthesis or epitome of written gospels or a syncretistic use of Horus cycles, but the author's creation of a prototype of divine power over serpents (the myth) out of the symbols and motifs of contemporaneous Christian folklore (the local discourse of authority and precedent). Similarly, behind PGM CXXIII, \"Come out of your tomb, Christ is calling you,\" lies not one of the extant (canonical or extra-canonical) accounts of Christ's empty tomb or harrowing of hell but a general tradition of the hero Christ liberating the dead. Beyond the Chris-tian story one might trace this historiola to a broader (and indige-nous Egyptian) concept of divine power over human death—what I would call the myth, the essential paradigm this historiola is articulating. Thus its articulation within a local Christian discourse gives the spell immediate authority, while its application for child-birth determines what details should be invoked. One can similarly explain the persistence of indigenous (pagan) gods and their stories in Coptic and other Christian spells (e.g., Hs. Schmidt 1 and 2). Scholars have alternated between taking these as evidence of a still-pagan or syncretistic world-view on the one hand, and dismissing them as culturally meaningless on the other.54 But one might better regard the use and deployment of these names as a \"bricolage,\" at the first level (performance), of symbols and motifs from the second level (the local discourse of authority 53 See Faraone, \"The Mystodokos and the Dark-Eyed Maidens: Multicultural Influences on a Late-Hellenistic Incantation,\" in this volume. Obviously by the present scheme the search for any \"influences\" is superfluous, particularly in light of the commonness of the motifs. 54 Although note the more qualified conclusions of Kropp (3.5-9) and Walter Beltz, \"Zur Morphologie koptischer Zaubertexte,\" Coptic Studies: Acts of the Third International Congress of Coptic Studies, ed. Wlodzimierz Godlewski (Warsaw: PWN, 1990), 56-57."},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"and precedent), that articulates the \"myth\" of divine accomplish-ment in a certain realm of human experience (like love, in the case of the Schmidt spells, or snakebite in others). The use of indige-nous names and motifs simply indicates their continuing availabil-ity and authority. The choice, that is, of Christ or Horus for a particular spell, depends on what was believed necessary and work-able at one point in time in one client-\"doctor\" relationship, not on the presently dominant god in public ritual. The historiola that results from this process is indeed an ad hoc composition by its very nature—one that will vary substantially from the more elabo-rate narratives used in church and temple—but it is a composition that successfully \"narrates power.\""},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"PLATES NEW GREEK MAGICAL AND DIVINATORY TEXTS IN BERLIN"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"P.
