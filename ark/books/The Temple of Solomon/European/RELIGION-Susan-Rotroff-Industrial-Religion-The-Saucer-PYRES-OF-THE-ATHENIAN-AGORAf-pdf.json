She reawakened an interest that goes back to my earliest years at the Agora, when Steve Miller and John Camp excavated pyres in Greek Building Δ and the houses in section Ω, respectively. Determined to understand the purpose behind the deposits, I spent my excavation lunch breaks reading the notebook accounts of earlier discoveries. It was a discouraging enter-prise, so I set aside thoughts of understanding the ritual and concentrated instead on dating the deposits, part of the project of Agora XXIX. Lynn’s discovery that the bone from the pyres is exclusively that of animals, and particularly the species and parts of animals appropriate to sacrifice, coupled with the availability of new material from the excavations north of Hadrian Street and elsewhere in Athens, encouraged me to try again to make some sense of the activities of the people who left these deposits behind. This monograph is the result of that effort.I am grateful, as always, to the staff of the Agora Excavations, who have supported my work in innumerable ways. The director, John Camp, encouraged me to study and publish this material, and conversations with him over the years have helped to shape my ideas about the phenomenon. He also initiated additional excavations in the area outside the southwest corner of the public square, where supervisor Laura Gawlinski spent sev-eral seasons clarifying the plans and stratigraphy of buildings where pyres had been found in the early years of excavation. I am particularly grateful to Laura for the energy and attention she devoted to these important but poorly preserved structures. Craig Mauzy and Angelique Sideris undertook the monumental task of photographing the pyres anew and, between them, supplied me with most of the illustrations in this book. Anne Hooton generously responded to a last-minute plea for a drawing, fitting my request into an already overloaded schedule. Charts and graphs are my own unless otherwise indicated; photographs, plans, and drawings were supplied by the Agora Excavations unless otherwise noted.

In collaboration with secretary Jan Jordan and registrar Sylvie Dumont, they also reorganized and stored the objects more securely. Jan and Sylvie dealt with my requests for access to the material, with the assistance of the guards of the Agora Museum. They cheerfully shouldered the extra work that my inventorying of many new objects visited upon them and often drew my attention to deposits and details I would not otherwise have been aware of. Agora volunteers, especially Joseph Lillywhite and Christine Smith, helped with the task of sorting through material in dusty tins and boxes stored in the basement of the Stoa of Attalos, and foreman George Dervos and his team retrieved and reshelved those same tins and boxes in aid of the project. Essential to it all, of course, was the work of the generations of excavators who devoted meticulous care to the excavation of the deposits—both the supervisors who recorded their discovery and the workers who found them and removed them from the soil.For financial support I owe thanks to the National Endowment for the Humanities, which supported a year of residence in Athens dedicated to work on this project (2009–2010), and to Washington University, which granted me sabbatical leave for that year. I am grateful to the American School of Classical Studies at Athens for the scholarly support it supplies in the form of the Blegen Library, and for a “home” in Athens populated with talented scholars and students with a wide range of interests, whose questions, comments, and advice contributed materially to the development of the project. In particular I would like to thank the former director of the School, Jack Davis, for his invitation to speak about the pyres in the School’s lecture series, giving me the opportunity to draw my ideas together and present them to a knowledgeable audience. The Mobius and Interlibrary Loan systems, together with the Agora website built and maintained by Bruce Hartzler, have made it possible for me to continue my work at home in St. Louis. Bruce’s work has revolutionized the study of Agora material, and he deserves the hearty thanks of this and future generations of scholars for making the excavation records available worldwide.Several colleagues have provided texts or information that I have in-corporated into the manuscript. Maria Ntinou contributed Appendix I, on charcoal from the pyres, and Evi Margaritis arranged for the sorting of the organic remains recovered through flotation (carried out under the supervi-sion of Amber Laughy) and contributed her expertise to the identification of the preserved plant material. Lynn Snyder provided me with information about the animal bone, in anticipation of her planned publication on that material. Phyllis Graham supplied a vivid, firsthand account of an exorcism at Archaia Nemea in 1981. To all of them I am grateful for the generous sharing of their knowledge, experience, and expertise.I am indebted to Elizabeth Pemberton for information about relevant pottery at Corinth, and to Ioulia Tzonou-Herbst and Guy Sanders for facilitating access to it. Jutta Stroszeck kindly enabled me to examine the pottery from pyres at the Kerameikos, which I visited on a stormy day when she had also to deal with major flooding in her offices.

I also appreciate the many observations and corrections contributed by the learned anonymous readers tasked by the American School with the evaluation of my manuscript; they have saved me from many errors and prompted me to a fuller consideration of several features of the pyre phenomenon. For the meticulous care they devoted to the manuscript during the publication process, I would like to thank Gene McGarry, whose contribution went far beyond the usual defi-nition of “proofing,” and my in-house editior, Michael Fitzgerald, whose wise advice resolved many thorny issues and whose gentle humor made light the work. The mistakes that remain are, of course, my own. Special thanks, as always, are due to my husband, Bob Lamberton, who, among many other kindnesses, has patiently helped me talk and think through the many conundrums that the pyres present.Finally, I dedicate this volume to the memory of Eve Harrison and Evelyn Smithson, members of the formidable second generation of Agora scholars who joined the excavations after the Second World War. They were at the height of their powers when I first came to the Agora in 1970, and their work has provided models of intellectual acuity, meticulous observation, encyclopedic knowledge, creativity, insight, and daring that I have tried to emulate but can never match. I owe them a special debt for that, and for the support, encouragement, and friendship they offered me. I hope they knew how important they were to me.Jerusalemacknowledgments"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"chapter 1IntroductionOn the 10th of March in 1933, with the discovery of a small cache of pots in a Hellenistic layer, Eugene Vanderpool encountered a puzzle that has continued to exercise students of Athenian life for three generations. Vanderpool described the event in typically laconic style: “The following vases . . . were found together in a small pocket in the earth below a Hel-lenistic fill at KA:5. A few other fragments found with them, including two pieces of a BG skyphos with lines crossing diagonally on the reserved band above the base, discarded.”1 Two similar discoveries followed in May,2 and in subsequent years the numbers mounted, showing that these simple concentrations of pottery bore witness to a repeated and customary ancient activity. The nature of that activity, however, has remained a mystery. It is the goal of this study to present the complete evidence for such deposits, now numbering about 70, as they are documented at the Agora; to evaluate that evidence in the light of similar deposits discovered in Attica and elsewhere, and against the background of Greek ritual practice as it is known from written and archaeological sources; and to explore the motives that may lie behind the burial of these small but distinctive offerings in the Attic soil.Buried burnt offerings are by no means rare, at the Agora or else-where in the Greek world, and they are not infrequently labeled “pyres.”3 The phenomenon on which I focus here, however, constitutes a specific genus of ritual deposit, clearly defined by its contents and the manner of its deposition. In brief, the deposits consist of a suite of characteristic objects (mostly ceramic) found in shallow pits or clusters, together with burnt bones and other evidence of fire. The presence of burning justifies their traditional designation as “pyres,” though the German term Brand- opfer does them greater justice, suggesting as it does a ritual function and dissociating them from cremation burials, with which they have nothing to do. Although no two pyres are identical in their content, the collection 1. Agora field notebook (hereafter “Notebook”) Z II, p. 265; pyre 25.

Beyond Attica, see the deposits listed in Appendix IV."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"chapter 12of offerings they contain is repetitive; it is this that defines them and sets them apart from other deposits of possible ritual character. The object that occurs with the greatest frequency, a small, plain saucer, provides a further distinguishing label,4 and the term “saucer pyre” has become the standard English designation for such deposits.5 In this specific form, the pyres are a uniquely Attic phenomenon, and with few exceptions they are chronologically limited to the 4th and 3rd centuries.Since these deposits were first recorded in the 1930s, various hypotheses have been put forward concerning the activities that they document, as I will outline below. The behavior that brought them into being has apparently escaped comment in literary and documentary sources, and the pyres now exist only as an archaeological phenomenon, defined purely by the manner of their deposition and the characteristic objects that they include. This study is therefore limited to deposits that share those characteristics, and it excludes others that may well have been laid down for similar motives but differ either in terms of their contents or the way in which they were deposited.A perfectly preserved and excavated saucer pyre would lie in a well-defined pit or cluster, and traces of burning in the form of charred wood, ash, and burnt bone would be present. The pots would be nestled closely together and would include the following characteristic forms: one or more drinking cups, one or more lamps, and ribbon-handled and rilled-rim plates, all in functional sizes; miniature saucers and cooking pots (both the shallow lopadion and the deeper chytridion), and a miniature handleless lekanis (Fig. 1). Only eight of the deposits included in this study conform in every detail to this ideal description.6 Others lack one or more of the distinctive offerings, or have been found dispersed or disturbed, or preserve no evidence of burning or of bone. Whether to include such deposits in the tally has been determined on a case-by-case basis. The most doubtful cases are indicated by a question mark in the Catalogue.Saucer pyres are limited to Attica but not to the area investigated by the Agora Excavations. In addition to the neighborhoods surrounding the public square, they have been found under private buildings just inside the city wall at the Kerameikos, in shops and houses to the south of the Acropo-lis (also within the walls), in the Piraeus, on the central plain of Attica, and perhaps on the island of Salamis (see Appendix II and Fig. 125). In this study I refer to these as “settlement” pyres; they are to be distinguished from “graveside” pyres, similar deposits found in close proximity to graves in the cemeteries of Athens and Attica (see Appendix III and Fig. 126), but that differ in some details from pyres within the city. Although the pres-ent study focuses on the Agora pyres, for which I have the most complete documentation, it also takes those others deposits into account, insofar as the published record permits.4. The saucer is present in about 80% of the pyres found at the Agora, and in about 75% of those found else-where, as far as one can determine from the published information; see p. 25, below.5. Other designations include “pyre burial” (Young 1951b, p. 110), “sacrifi-cial pyre” (Agora XII, p. 45; Shear 1973a, p. 141; 1984, pp. 45–46), “ritual pyre” (Agora XXIX, p. 212), “ceremonial pyre” (Parlama and Stampolidis 2000, p. 92), or just plain “pyre” (Agora XIV, p. 16). The standard German terms are Opferstelle (e.g., Kerameikos XVII, p. 50) or Brandopferstelle (Knigge and Kovacsovics 1981, p. 388); in Greek, τελετουργική πυρά (Eleftheratou 1996–1997), and, folding interpretation into terminology, εγκαίνιον, “inauguration” (Andreou and Andreou 2000; Elefther-atou 2006, p. 8), or εναγισμός, “offering to the dead” (Eleftheratou 1996–1997).6. Pyres 9, 18, 19, 21, 37, 40, 43, 60."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"introduction3ChaLLenges anD methoDoLogyLike all archaeological assemblages, the saucer pyres present challenges to those ambitious to understand the behavior that created them. It is only rarely that a pyre has survived without any discernible disturbance, so that we may be confident that we are unearthing the entirety of what was origi-nally buried. In 17 instances there is reason to believe, from the excavation account or the remaining objects, that there has been little or no significant disturbance of the deposit. In other cases the pyre has been partially cut away by later pits, walls, or even by later pyres; and 14 pyres have been thoroughly dispersed, spread throughout fills or dumped into wells, their existence recoverable now only by the presence of the characteristic shapes. A further problem emerges from the manner in which the pyres were bur-ied. It is clear that the people who made these deposits did not take care to bury everything that they had used in the attendant ceremony. Even in pyres that show no evidence of post-depositional disturbance, both cinders and fragments of relevant pottery have sometimes been found outside the pyre itself, at some distance and on the level from which the pyre was dug.7 In other cases, something is clearly missing (for example, the lekanis that Figure 1. Characteristic pyre shapes: lopadion (P 28508, pyre 60), chytri- dion (P 17696, pyre[?] 45), lekanis (P 18543, pyre 44), small saucer (P 9717, pyre 21), large saucer (P 19870, pyre 35), ribbon-handled plate (P 28494, pyre 62), rilled-rim plate (P 18545, pyre 44), covered bowl (P 18581, pyre 46).

Therefore we must always keep in mind that what is lacking in the archaeological assemblage was not necessarily absent from the living assemblage.It would be useful, nonetheless, to have some idea of the degree to which the different vessel types were thought essential to the procedure. To this end, Table 3 presents the types of offerings found in the pyres and the number and percentage of pyres that contain each type (see be-low, pp. 18–19). The pyres are divided into three categories: the 17 that are most likely to have been substantially undisturbed; those for which varying degrees of disturbance can be inferred; and the dispersed pyres.Modern recovery also presents problems. The Agora pyres have been excavated over a period of nearly 80 years by a cast of at least 20 different supervisors and uncounted workmen and student volunteers, each with different talents and standards of observation, recovery, and recording. Although a pyre is easy to recognize in the ground, understanding its rela-tionship to the contiguous strata can be difficult, and the experienced Greek workmen of the past often had more success than the student volunteers of the present. Recording also varies. The best accounts include generous and perceptive written description and commentary, and plans, sections, and photographs of the pyres in situ. These, however, are rare. Only about half of the deposits were photographed before removal,8 almost none were drawn in any detail, and precise information about the orientation and position of individual pots has rarely been provided. In the worst cases, there is no notebook account at all: as, for example, with pyre 63, found washing out of a scarp by a gardener during the winter,9 or pyre 64, the discovery of which was not described.10The apparent absence of written testimonia that could shed light on these deposits forces us to view the pyres themselves as our texts,11 a pro-cedure that has grown more familiar with the development of cognitive archaeology. Stating what ought to be obvious, but apparently is not, Robin Osborne has written that “archaeologists should not assume that religious practices can be discussed only when there are texts available as guides.”12 In an essay introducing a series of articles on ritual deposits, he lays out a series of fundamental questions that should be addressed. How do we recognize a ritual deposit? How do we account for what was deposited (and, I would add, for the way in which it was deposited)? And why was this place chosen? These are some of the questions that I will attempt to answer in this study of the Agora saucer pyres.8. Only one excavator (D. B. Thompson) provided an explanation: “Miltiades had them [the pots] out before I could photograph” (Notebook Φ VIII, p. 1518; pyre 58).9. Notebook Ψ VII, p. 1379.10. The deposit is known only from the inventoried pottery and a note in pottery notebook Τ XXIX, p. 5622: “disturbed pyre burial. Frags of saucer.”11. That so learned a scholar of Athenian religion as Robert Parker could do no more than style them “enigmatic domestic rituals” (2005a, p. 20, n. 55) suggests that they truly are unattested in written sources.12.

As early as 1935, Rodney Young remarked in his field-notebook account of the excavation of pyre 23 that it might be either a cremation burial, on the one hand, or “merely a dump of pottery, perhaps from a kitchen,” on the other.13 The first published account, in Homer Thompson’s report of the 1947 excavation season, expands on the first of these hypotheses. Thompson described four pyres found among houses to the southwest of the public square,14 remarking on the presence of bone and of pottery “obviously made for funerary use.” Because of the miniature size of much of the pottery and the “thinness of the bones,” he interpreted the pyres as the cremation burials of children and remarked that “the whole series deserves a special study.”15 Such a study was soon undertaken by Young as part of his voluminous examination of the “Industrial District” southwest of the public square, where he had excavated many examples. The pyres, “somewhat reluctantly” interpreted as infant cremations, were published in his 1951 article on burial within the city, most of which was devoted to the Archaic cemetery that lay in the Industrial District.16 From among the two dozen or so pyres that had been excavated up to that time, Young selected 14 of the least disturbed for full publication.In support of his conclusions, Young first noted the similarity of the pyres to deposits he had excavated in the nearby Archaic cemetery, in terms of dimensions, the nature of the burning, and the placement of offerings. He pointed also to the funerary character of some of the objects in the pyres: dummy poros alabastra, clearly symbolic and of a shape frequently associated with burials; and ribbon-handled plates, known from earlier graves but almost totally absent from deposits of household pottery. He noted furthermore that pyre lekanides, chytridia, and lopadia had not been found in household deposits and expressed the opinion that their small size was appropriate to children. He was also able to point to a few examples of such shapes that had been found in graves.17Young’s (and Thompson’s) thesis has met with mixed reviews. Rob-ert Garland accepted the conclusion without reservations,18 while Jean Rudhardt expanded it further, postulating that the deceased were not ordinary children, but those who had died very young, either naturally or by exposure, and that the pyre ritual did double duty as cremation and purificatory sacrifice.19 Donna Kurtz and John Boardman, in their survey of Greek burial customs, were more circumspect; they cited the Agora pyres as a possible rare instance of infant cremation, but pointed out that they could also be explained as remains of burnt offerings, and not necessarily of a funerary character.20Most scholars, however, rejected Young’s conclusions, though some perpetuated the idea of a funerary element. Brian Sparkes and Lucy Tal-cott considered the pyres briefly in the context of their 1970 study of the Archaic and Classical pottery of the Agora. Pointing to similar deposits that had, by that time, been found in Attic cemeteries, they preferred to see the pyres as the remains of purificatory or funerary offerings that might 13.

Wycherley elaborated on this notion, suggesting that the pyres documented ritual meals in memory of the deceased.22 T. Leslie Shear Jr., however, divorced the ceremony from burial ritual, associating it purely with activities in the structures within which the pyres were found. The deposits, he believed, were best viewed as the remnants of sacrifices com-memorating the construction or remodeling of the building, or purifica-tion rituals carried out when old tenants moved out and new ones moved in.23 John Camp later noted, echoing Thompson’s earlier comment, that the presence of animal bones (of which some clear instances had by then been found) and miniature cooking pots pointed to ritual meals, without suggesting their possible purpose.24Meanwhile, similar deposits began to be found outside the area of the Agora Excavations (see Appendix II and Fig. 125). In 1981, Ursula Knigge and Wilfried Kovacsovics reported Opferstellen (offering places) with the characteristic combination of drinking cups and miniature ves-sels, very much like the Agora pyres, under the floors of Building Z, just inside the city wall at the Kerameikos; more pyres subsequently came to light under the floors of two neighboring structures, Building X and Building Y.25 Knigge and Kovacsovics rejected the funerary connection, insisting that the deposits must be related to events in the history of the building in which they were found.26 In her final publication of Building Z, Knigge presented these pyres, along with other groups of objects found under the original floors of the building, as undoubted Bauopfer (build-ing offerings) documenting rituals associated with the construction and, in one case, minor remodeling of the building.27 This interpretation has subsequently been applied to the Agora pyres. Two recent dissertations, by Rita Müller-Zeis and by Stefan Weikart, have included the Agora pyres in their catalogues and discussions of griechische Bauopfer.28 Similarly, Ioanna and Elias Andreou have compared them to deposits of miniature vessels frequently found under the original floors of houses in Ambracia, which they associate with the construction of the houses.29 Because such deposits have been found only in Ambracia, and not in the surrounding settlements, they see the ritual as a Corinthian custom, practiced by the descendants of the original founders of the city, but not shared by the ethnically different population of its hinterland. They attribute the sudden introduction of the custom at Athens (an issue that had not previously been addressed) to the immigration of Corinthian metics into the city at the end of the 5th century.21.

She raises again, however, the issue of the funerary character of the deposits, suggesting that the recipients were chthonic divinities. The pyres, in her view, record chthonic rituals associated with the building, and they are purificatory, apotropaic, or expiatory in their intent.31Back at the Agora, Lynn Snyder’s zooarchaeological analysis of the burnt bone from the Agora pyres, undertaken in response to the discovery of several new pyres in the late 1990s, has confirmed earlier suspicions that it belongs exclusively to animals, and added the discovery that it represents precisely those parts of the animal that ancient texts stipulate, and that sacrificial deposits elsewhere confirm, were the gods’ portion.32In summary, the pyres have generally come to be regarded as building deposits of some sort, associated with construction or renovation of the structures within which they were buried. Before considering the virtues of this conclusion, however, it is necessary to review in full both the contents of the pyres and the stratigraphic evidence for their deposition, as it has been revealed by excavations at the Agora.30. Nine were unearthed in the Metro station excavations, three of which have been published (Elefther-atou 1996–1997; Parlama and Stampo-lidis 2000, pp. 92–103). Pyres from the Acropolis Museum excavations remain unpublished, but one is on display near the entrance of the new museum (Eleftheratou 2006, p. 8).31. Eleftheratou 1996–1997, pp. 115–116.32.

In most cases, identification as a pyre is straightfor-ward, but doubts may be raised in five instances (33, 34, 45, 48, 68, followed by a question mark in the Catalogue), where characteristic shapes or other indicators are absent or counterindications are present. Several pyres had been removed from their original place of deposit, but their existence can be inferred from characteristic shapes, now dispersed in strata or fills (10, 13, 17, 28, 42, 54, 55, 59, 61, 65, 69), in a pithos (57), and in wells (27 and perhaps 68). Although they tell us nothing about the process of deposit, these examples usefully expand the amount of data available for chrono-logical and spatial analysis.Among them, these deposits contain over 1,000 objects, most of them deliberately included as offerings, though items from the surrounding soil may have entered some groups by chance (these instances are discussed case by case in the Catalogue entries). In what follows, I summarize both recurring features and variability in both the stratigraphic situation of the pyres and their contents.sPatIaL DIstrIbutIonSaucer pyres have been found only in the neighborhoods surrounding the public square, never within the confines of the square itself as defined by boundary stones and monumental public buildings (Fig. 2). Their distribution is not uniform. They cluster in two main areas: the industrial and residential district strung along the “Street of the Marble Workers” that departs from the square at its southwestern corner; and in a less well defined area to the north of the square, behind the Stoa Poikile and north of the Square Peristyle Building that preceded the Stoa of Attalos as an eastern boundary of the public area.

To the southwest of the square, pyres have been found in the House of Simon and in a complex of three long, narrow buildings of uncertain purpose just to its south; in the so-called Strategeion across the street from this and southwest of the Tholos; in the large Poros Build-ing farther to the south; and in Houses B–D and G, in the heart of the Industrial District excavated and published by Young.1 Houses C and D illustrate another curious phenomenon, the fact that a few buildings host disproportionately large numbers of pyres: 10 such deposits were found within the walls of these two houses, which at one point in their histories communicated through a connecting door. An even more impressive concentration was unearthed in the Classical Commercial Building to the north of the square, with 13 pyres inside the structure and five more in its immediate vicinity. Three pyres were found in a similar shop building (Greek Building Δ) north of the square but farther to the east.Pyres have also been found in two groups of houses south of the square: a block of dwellings in excavation section Φ, just south of South Stoa I; and three houses along an east–west road farther to the southeast, in excavation section Ω. The numbers of pyres there are modest, though one of the Φ houses hosted three. Isolated pyres in the same area were probably located in similar structures that have since disappeared. Other single instances occur in a workshop (House 3) on the northern side of the Kolonos Agoraios and under a mosaic floor on the southern side of the hill, both in areas profoundly disturbed by Roman, Byzantine, and modern construction. The House of the Greek Mosaics, south of the Areopagus, also had at least one pyre. Only a few pyres have been found to the east of the square, mostly associated with shop buildings along the street leading east toward the area of the later Roman Agora.moDes oF DePosItIonNearly three-quarters of the Agora pyres were uncovered in what appear to be their original places of deposit. Nonetheless, they present significant problems of stratigraphic interpretation, for some had been severely dis-turbed and others were only summarily recorded. A complete sequence pre-serving the pyre and the stratigraphy around and above it is rarely preserved or documented. In the best cases, however, the excavators’ descriptions, along with photographs taken at the time of excavation, make it possible, within limits, to reconstruct the ways in which the deposits were formed.In his 1951 publication, Young remarked that the “typical pyre . . . was made in a small shallow pit dug for the purpose.”2 The subsequent years of excavation have revealed more diversity than this statement suggests (Table 1). In over half of the cases, excavators were unable to discern a pit, even though their accounts sometimes indicate that they looked for one. Rather, the pyre deposit was perceived as a concentration of objects and burnt material within a stratum that was apparently spread over and Figure 2 (opposite).

Pits may, of course, have gone undetected, either because of the nature or in-tegrity of the surrounding stratigraphy or the inattention or inexperience of individual excavators. Both types of deposit (in a pit or apparently not) exist throughout the documented period, there is no difference in the types of offerings they contain, and the numbers of offerings and their state of preservation in both is about the same. The concentrations, however, are on average slightly smaller than the pits in all dimensions (Table 2), as would be the case if an enclosing pit (necessarily somewhat larger than the clump of objects within it) had once existed, but had escaped detection. It is hard to believe, however, that so many different excavators overlooked the existence of a pit, and it may be significant that burning in situ was much less frequently reported in the case of concentrations. It is likely, therefore, that at least two different procedures were followed: burning or deposition within a pit, and burning or deposition on a floor or the ground. It also appears that in some cases the pit was dug into a floor and then filled, leaving a patch in the preexisting floor, while in others a whole new floor was laid over the pit when the ceremony was completed. The possibilities, then, are as follows:1. A pyre is deposited in a pit dug through a floor, which is then patched. Pyre 35 in House G in the Industrial District provides a clear case of this practice. There a pit was dug into a floor, then filled and tamped down after the pyre was deposited, leaving a dark patch in a preexisting floor surface whitened by marble dust.2. A pyre is deposited in a pit, over which a new floor is laid. Pyres 32 and 52 illustrate this procedure. A new floor directly covered the pit of pyre 32 in the Poros Building, and an unbroken road strosis ran over the pit that contained pyre 52.3. A pyre is deposited on a floor or the ground and a new floor is then laid around and over it. Two pyres found north of the pub-lic square illustrate this procedure.

Similarly clear is the case of pyre 6, in room 2 of the Classical Commercial Building, burnt on the ground and embedded in the makeup of the original floor of the room (see Figs. 24, 30).Burning is a recurring feature of the pyres. Cinders, charcoal, ash, and charred logs, twigs, and bone are almost always present, though in widely varying amounts. Even when the notebook accounts fail to mention it, or when disturbed pyre pottery has been found in secondary deposits, the condition of the vessels bears witness to burning.3 This effect, however, is usually slight, most commonly consisting of dark patches on the surface or a grayish tinge to the ceramic; rarely is a vessel seriously burnt. Young concluded from this, and he must be right, that the pottery was placed on the embers after the fire had burnt down considerably.4 It may also mean that in some cases the fire was not a large or a strong one, though the thoroughly calcined bone in others indicates that a high temperature was sometimes reached.In several cases it was observed that the floor or sides of the pit or the earth below the pyre deposit was very hard and/or red, an indication that the pyre had been burnt in situ (Table 1).5 Young described this feature repeatedly in his excavation of the pyres in Houses B–D and G in the In-dustrial District. It has been noted in only two pyres elsewhere, however: one in the Classical Commercial Building (6) and one across the street from it to the west (19). Young had extensive experience with the excavation of cremation burials, having dug not only the Archaic cemetery southwest of the public square but also many Geometric graves. It is therefore likely that he was particularly sensitive to this nuance of the stratigraphic record. Others may not have noticed it or, if they did, failed to record it or to recog-nize its significance, and indeed burning in situ can sometimes be inferred from other evidence. In six cases (five in the Industrial District [pyres 22, 36, 40, 49, 50] and one in the Classical Commercial Building [pyre 16]), the pottery lay atop a stratum of burnt material. Even though hardening of the earth was not observed, these pyres must have been burnt in situ, for such a stratigraphic sequence is unlikely to have been preserved if the burnt pyre had been swept up and then dumped elsewhere.Excavators did not always mention the location of burnt material in the deposit, but in 15 cases it was described as distributed throughout the pyre rather than localized below the offerings. This suggested to some observ-ers that the pyre had been burnt elsewhere and the material subsequently swept up and deposited at the findspot.6 Two such pyres, however, show by the telltale burning on the walls of the pit that they were burnt in situ 3. Only two pyres lack all evidence for burning: 24 (badly disturbed) and 53.4. Young 1951b, p. 111.5. Pyres 6, 19, 35, 38, 39, 41, 43, 44, 46, 47, 52.6.

Young thought pyre(?) 45 was more likely a rubbish dump than a pyre, “chiefly because the cinders, though some of them were large, were scattered through this fill and not all in one place—thrown in rather than burned on the spot” (Notebook NN XXII, p. 4348). He also remarked on the lack of hard-ened, reddened soil in the pit. D. B. Thompson commented of pyre 56, “The contents had clearly been burned elsewhere and deposited” (Notebook Φ VIII, p. 1504), despite a layer of char-coal below the pottery."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"the agora pyres: the data15(38, 47). Furthermore, there is little difference in the completeness of the pottery in deposits burnt in situ and those with burning throughout, as there should be if the latter had been transported from the site of the burn-ing. It is thus difficult to establish, as a certainty, the practice of burning in one location and deposition in another. It is an attractive explanation, however, for those pyres where cinders and ash are minimal and scattered throughout the deposit.The above details suggest that different procedures were followed in different instances, and there is some evidence that different groups of dedi-cators preferred one or another. As Table 1 shows, most of the pyres with definite evidence of burning in situ are located in the Industrial District, southwest of the public square; the same is true of pyres buried within pits. This raises the possibility of a small difference in ritual behavior between the inhabitants of the Industrial District and others who lived and worked around the square.In any event, it is clear that many of the pyres were burnt either within pits or on the ground. If, as Snyder’s zooarchaeological analysis indicates, the bone of the pyres is that of sacrificial victims, this procedure is un-usual, since a raised altar was the normal site for burning sacrificial meat. Sacrifices burnt within pits (bothroi) are rarely attested; they are always directed at chthonic entities, and are most commonly holocausts (which is not the case here).7 Sacrifices may repeatedly have been burnt in escharai on the ground in sanctuaries of the Herakleidai at Athens and Archegetes on Delos, but these are rare instances of the practice.8 The ritual practice of the pyre dedicators, therefore, is not perfectly aligned with normative Greek sacrificial procedures as we understand them.No pattern can be observed in the placement of the vessels, which may be upside down, right-side up, or on their sides. Those who observed them in the ground sometimes commented that they had been “thrown in” or lay “higgledy piggledy.”9 This is also the testimony of the excavation photographs, where the pots usually lie in a jumbled mass (e.g., in pyre 18; see Fig. 47). Sometimes, however, there is evidence of more care: lopadia or lekanides right-side up with their lids in place, indicating that they had been set down rather than tossed, or plates and saucers stacked or nested within one another in a position that does not look haphazard (see Figs. 32, 38, 83, 89, 112).10Most of the pottery found in the pyres is broken. Only about 60 vessels survive intact, 6% of the ceramic corpus, and usually the sturdier forms: chytridion, lopadion lid, lamp, and lekanis. Not a single plate escaped breakage, and only 19 of the 344 saucers recovered from Agora pyres are intact. The question emerges whether this breakage was a deliberate part of the rite or a result of fire, the weight of the earth resting on the pottery, and the passage of time. A definitive answer is not possible, but excavation photographs often show broken vessels with all the fragments in place, a certain sign that breakage occurred after they were deposited (see pyres 12, 36, 60; Figs. 38, 75, 112). Only very rarely do joining fragments of mended vessels show different degrees of burning, indicating that breakage took place before the vessel came in contact with fire.11 The evidence thus favors the conclusion that breakage was unintentional.7.

E.g., a ribbon-handled plate (P 18547) in pyre 44.

In a number of cases, however, there is no evidence for bone, either in the notebook accounts or in surviving material. Eight such cases are of pyres apparently burnt in situ; if bone was among the items consigned to the fire, it should have left some noticeable trace. These instances include the first three pyres excavated (25, 29, 30), located in the trapezoidal complex of buildings south of the Tholos. Found in 1933, before this deposit type had been recognized as a recurring phenomenon, they were accorded only terse descriptions of one or two sentences in the notebooks.12 Excavating another pyre (26) in the same area some 20 years later, D. B. Thompson reported “a ‘saucer grave’ among a little ashes” but no bone.13 No bone was recorded for the disturbed and somewhat dispersed deposit 28, probably the remains of a pyre located in the same area.14 Perhaps in these cases small fragments of well-calcined bone were overlooked or not thought worthy of mention,15 but it is intriguing that all five deposits are located within the same complex of buildings. Pyre 24, a disturbed pyre in the nearby House of Simon, apparently contained neither burning nor bone, and it is likely that this is evidence for another instance of diversity in the practice of the pyre ritual, and that the sacrifice of an animal, or the burning of animal parts, was not a universal element of the ritual.16Another detail of interest is the incompleteness of the pyre deposits. Pyres 1 and 44 are rare instances where all of the objects recovered were intact, complete, or nearly so. More frequently, some part of the original assemblage is clearly missing. Pyre 35, for example, burnt in situ in a pit and apparently undisturbed, contains the lids of a lopadion and a lekanis but lacks the bodies, and half of one of its chytridia is absent. In pyre 43, burnt in a pit and covered over by a floor strosis, large pieces of a ribbon-handled plate, a skyphos, and a saucer are missing. Many other pyres are even more fragmentary, especially those that were not placed in pits. Al-though some of the absences may be attributed to undetected disturbance, or even to careless recovery, the recurrence of the phenomenon suggests that it reflects some feature of the ritual activity. It lends weight to the suggestion that pyres could be burnt in one place and deposited in another, and that no special care was taken to collect and deposit all of the material for final burial. Even when a pyre was burnt in situ, some objects escaped the assemblage. Young noted in several cases the presence of both cinders and pottery outside the pit,17 left on the surface after the pyre was buried.Finally, there is evidence that in some instances the pyre ceremony was doubled in some way.18 In two cases, pyre 19 west of the Classical Commercial Building and pyre 46 in House C, excavators noted that the pottery was arranged in two distinct layers. Both of these pyres include unusually large amounts of pottery (38 items each), and several of the of-ferings appear to be doubles, features that link them to a third instance, pyre 21 on the northern side of the Kolonos Agoraios. In all three cases there are two lekanides instead of one, and the two are unmatched. Pyres 21 and 46 include four chytridia, clearly two pairs. They also contain larger numbers of ribbon-handled plates than the usual assemblage, again easily recognized by their details as pairs: two pairs in pyre 46, three pairs in pyre 12.

That bone can be present but denied is indicated by the case of pyre 58: although the excavator explic-itly stated that there was “not a shred of bone” (Notebook Φ VIII, p. 1518), a scrap of bone today remains in the lot. The deposit was recovered on two dif-ferent days, and the bone fragment may have been found after the excavator wrote this comment.16. Bone is absent from descrip- tions of two additional pyres. H. A. Thompson’s brief account of pyre 70 mentions only ash. Pyre 50 was badly disturbed and excavated by two differ-ent archaeologists in two different seasons.17. Young 1951b, p. 111.

In all three cases the number of lopadia is also unusually high (three or four). The stratigraphic situation of pyre 21 is not very clear, but the excavation notes hint at two different concentrations of burning, further support for a double ceremony. Together, the stratigraphy and contents of these deposits suggest a variation from the usual procedure. There is no perceptible difference in date within the objects in each pyre, and it does not seem likely that these instances represent the chance burial of a later pyre directly over an earlier one, as is the case with pyres 14 and 15. Perhaps two different groups performed the ceremony together, each bringing its own offerings; or the ceremony was performed twice, though within a very short span of time, before the two sets of offerings were buried together. All three of these double pyres date within the first third of the 3rd century, and it is possible that this reduplication of the ceremony was limited to that time.the oFFerIngsPyre offerings are so regular and so distinctive that the existence of a now widely dispersed pyre can be inferred from their presence alone. Most are ceramic, and the number of shapes that occur regularly is very restricted, although a much longer list of types is occasionally found (Table 3). The “regulars” (Fig. 1) can be classified in two size groups: vessels of utilitarian size, and smaller vessels that I term miniatures, the function of which can only have been symbolic. In what follows, I consider each of the object types offered, investigating their contexts and distribution within the At-tic and wider Greek world, with an eye toward a greater understanding of their place within the pyre ritual and in the arena of Greek ritual practice in general.MiniaturesThe miniature vessels were made specifically for ritual use, and at the Agora are found almost exclusively in pyre deposits. While smaller than functional vessels, they should be differentiated from the very tiny miniatures that accumulated in large numbers at some sacred sites19 and appear in pyres only rarely (pyres 3, 12, 28). The pyre miniatures clearly evoke the service of a meal: two types of cooking pots for its preparation, a covered vessel for its presentation and preservation, and the eponymous saucers on which to serve it (Fig. 1).Cooking PotsIn a general sense, the cooking pots replicate the full-size vessels used in the contemporary Athenian kitchen: a capacious round-bodied stew pot (chytra) and a shallower lidded pan (lopas). These two shapes dominate the cooking ware of Classical Athens (and elsewhere in Greece as well), and although other shapes occasionally appear, these two were apparently all that was needed for the basics of Greek cooking.2019.

From about 500 onward, it regularly occurs in burials, almost without exception the burials of children.22 The association is so strong that, when the shape does occur with an adult, it is tempting to conjecture that an undetected newborn shared the grave.23 It was also at least once used as the place of deposition for a curse tablet, an association that underlines its connection with the powers below.24 At the Agora, chytridia have also been found in the Crossroads Enclosure and the Crossroads Well on the north side of the public square, with their rich deposits of votive objects dedicated to an unknown, but perhaps female and probably chthonic divinity.25 The shape does occur in domestic contexts of the 5th century, but not commonly;26 sooting on two of these shows, however, that chytridia could be functional vessels, despite their small size.The history of the miniature lopas (conventionally designated as a lopadion) is quite different, though it also involves the graveyard. Unlike the chytridion, the lopadion does not imitate large-scale models in detail, and its origin is a bit of a puzzle. The vessel is broad and shallow and fitted with a marked flange on the inside of the rim to receive a lid (Fig. 1; see also Fig. 6); a lid is often present as well. Details of the profile vary, but 21. See Agora XII, pp. 224–225, where it is called “common type.” The similarities between the full-size vessels and the chytridia can be appreciated on pl. 93.22.

These differences are too great to be dismissed as attempts at simplification, and the evidence is that the lopadion did not originate as an imitation of the familiar lopas of the Athenian kitchen.Chronology supports this conclusion. The first full-size lopades of the familiar form at the Agora occur in deposits dating ca. 440–425, when the shape was introduced as an import from Aigina and was quickly copied by local potters.27 Smaller lopades, however, with a single vertical handle and a plain profile like that of many of the lopadia of the pyres, may ap-pear slightly earlier. Probably the earliest examples are two vessels from a household well that was filled around 440.28 They are a bit larger than the pyre lopadia (14.5 cm in diameter in comparison to no more than 12.5 cm for pyre lopadia) and have a flattened bottom, but otherwise are quite similar to them. A fragmentary example, again slightly larger than pyre lopadia but closer to them in shape, comes from a pit filled with pottery from a public dining place in the wake of an earthquake in 426.29 The shape continues to appear, sometimes in large quantities, in deposits of the last quarter of the 5th century, including at least 22 in a well containing debris from the Tholos, another place of public dining.30 It would be difficult to dismiss these and other examples of the same period as strays from undiscovered pyres; clearly the lopadion arose and developed independently of the full-size lopas as a functional vessel before being adopted for use in the pyre ritual and concurrently abandoned as a secular vessel.Possible models exist at the Agora in the form of two larger vessels of the same profile, but with two horizontal handles attached to the rim (Fig. 3). Both are imports, probably from Aigina, and one is Archaic in date;31 there is no indication that the shape in its larger version was ever imitated locally. The pyre lopadion, however, is not simply a smaller version of that shape; rather, it has been redesigned with a single handle, since two would have been superfluous for handling the smaller vessel. It is difficult to imagine its function, however, since the lopadion seems too small for 27.

The early examples show little trace of burning, and it is possible, despite the ware of which they were fashioned, that they were not used for cooking at all.Although the above account demonstrates that the lopadion had a place (however ill-defined) in daily life, the shape also has clear connec-tions with the cemetery. A lopadion of standard pyre shape was found in a late-5th-century cremation in the Eridanos cemetery,32 and a possibly much earlier example was found in a child’s larnax grave dated to the decade 480–470.33 Small lopades of different shapes, often more closely resembling the full-size cooking pot, occasionally furnished graves there as early as the second decade of the 5th century.34In terms of raw numbers, slightly more lopadia than chytridia have been found in pyres at the Agora; precise counts are difficult because of the fragmentary state of the material, but the ratio appears to be about 7:6 in favor of lopadia. Similarly, more pyres contain lopadia than chytridia (43 vs. 35), but the difference is not large. The same is true of published pyres elsewhere within the city. Curiously, however, the lopadion is more commonly included in graveside pyres, while the chytridion is by far the more common gift of the two within the grave itself, at least to judge from the published cemeteries at the Kerameikos. Lopadia and chytridia occur together in slightly less than half of the Agora pyres, and in many cases they were probably given in pairs, with equal numbers of each of the two shapes (e.g., in pyres 1, 21, 32, 35, 37, 41, 43, 44, 49, 60, 62). The two oc-casionally occur separately, although in most settlement pyres this might be explained by disturbance,35 and in some cases they are lacking altogether. The latter scenario is most commonly the case in the earliest (e.g., 38) and latest pyres (e.g., 2, 23, 66). A pyre may contain anywhere from one to four examples of either shape, though it is rare to find more than two (e.g., in pyres 21 and 46 there are two matching pairs of chytridia, indicating pos-sible double pyres; see pp. 16–17, above).Because the earliest chytridia and lopadia are made of cooking ware, a special fabric adapted for contact with fire, rather than the more common ordinary household ware, and because they resemble the two basic cooking shapes of the Greek kitchen, it seems clear that their symbolic meaning is as tools for food preparation. It has been suggested, however, that the chytridion is a miniature pitcher rather than a cooking pot, and therefore refers to pouring rather than meal preparation.36 Classical Athenians did occasionally make round-bottomed jugs out of cooking ware; Sparkes 5 cm0 Figure 3.

In view of this, it is more likely that the chytridia replicate the chytra, which they more closely resemble in profile and proportions. Many preserve traces of burning, but this is as likely to be the result of having been cast into the fire as it is to be evidence that they were used to heat food.LekanidesAbout three-quarters of the Agora pyres include some form of covered bowl among the offerings, most commonly a small (Diam. 5.0–7.7 cm), handleless lekanis, the rim offset on the outside to receive a lid that slips down over the vertical lip.38 The earliest examples are well glazed and have a ring foot, and their lids have a neatly profiled knob on a low stem (e.g., P 15882, P 19468, P 35592, in pyres 53, 42, 18; see Fig. 6). Although the pyre lekanis replicates no full-size shape precisely, models exist in a variety of small covered bowls current in the 5th and 4th centuries, mostly as grave furniture. The only one that had much currency in domestic pottery is the Lykinic lekanis, a small, elegant vessel with two upcurved handles, made from the mid-5th to the mid-4th century.39 Aside from the handles, the shape is the same as that of the pyre lekanis, and its lid sometimes had a profiled knob similar to those of the earliest pyre lekanides.40 The connec-tion is further supported by the inclusion of a Lykinic lekanis in the earliest of the Agora pyres (38) and of two in a graveside pyre at the Keramei- kos dating to ca. 430.41 Another possible source of inspiration for the pyre lekanis, however, is the handleless covered bowl. This occurs in two versions: one with a ring foot, the other with a low stem and a projecting rim.42 The former resembles the pyre lekanis in both shape and the absence of handles, although it is usually slightly larger (Diam. 7.4–12.2 cm) and differs in the forms of the knob. The shape is often found in Athenian graves, especially graves of children, from ca. 490 to the end of the 5th cen- tury,43 surviving just long enough to have had a possible impact on the develop- ment of the pyre shape.Small lekanides of other types also occur in early pyres (black-gloss ribbon-handled lekanides in pyres 22 and 25 and a wishbone-handled le-kanis in pyre 38), and a larger handleless lekanis appears once (in pyre 56), 37.

It is found in about two-thirds of the Agora pyres; published accounts suggest that the incidence is less (about one-half ) in pyres elsewhere within the city and pyres in the cemetery. It is unusual for more than one lekanis to be included among the offerings;44 when this does happen, the two are not twins; they often differ from one another considerably, something that is generally not true of items that occur in multiples. It is possible that in these cases the ceremony was doubled in some way (see pp. 16–17, above).In antiquity, the larger covered bowl that the pyre vessels imitate was probably designated by the word λεκανίς or a closely related term, so we are justified in turning to the written sources in an investigation of its function.45 Those sources indicate that its primary use was as a receptacle or container, and a wide variety of contents are attested, ranging from jewelry and toys to foodstuffs. References to food are particularly numer-ous: the lekanis and its cognates held cooked food, rabbit meat, fowl, and honey cakes.46 In published scholarship, the glazed and figured versions are generally associated with toiletries, the larger household-ware vessels with food—but this is a modern distinction, and the black-gloss surface of the pyre lekanis need not classify it as a jewel box or a powder bowl. Given that it is in the company of vessels for cooking and eating, it is likely that the pyre lekanis represents a food container. Sanne Houby-Nielsen has come to the same conclusion about the small black-gloss covered bowls discussed above, based on the fact that they occur so commonly in children’s graves in the company of shapes used for eating and drinking.47SaucersThe saucer, the eponymous shape of the deposits, is the most common pyre offering, with over 340 instances. Most are extremely simple, with a flat, string-cut base, a nearly vertical or spreading wall (depending on the diameter), and a plain rim. Diameters range from 4.5 to 12.0 cm, with smaller saucers (Diam. <8.5 cm) more common, and larger ones very rare before the last quarter of the 4th century. Within individual pyres deposited after that date, there are often groups of smaller and larger saucers (e.g., in pyres 1, 35, 41, 46), often present in even numbers. Although there is little variation in shape, a group of larger saucers from three pyres have profiled rims, concave on top (in pyres 12, 30, 51), and two have rilled rims (in pyres 44, 49); both probably imitate the larger plates with these features. Bases are normally flat, but small saucers from three pyres have a low disk foot (in pyres 6, 8, 39). The earliest saucers have a good coat of gloss, but 44. This is documented with assur-ance in four pyres (18, 19, 21, 46), though small fragments of a second lekanis have been found in some other instances (40, 57, 60). See also the multiple lekanides in graveside pyres: Kerameikos XIV, pp. 17–18, nos. 18.4, 5, pl. 30 (two lekanis lids), p. 38, nos. 25.33, 34, pl. 36 (two lekanides), p. 40, nos. 28.2, 3, pl. 37 (a lekanis-lid pair and an additional lid), p. 126, nos. 159.28–30, pl. 54 (three lekanides); Schlörb-Vierneisel 1966, pp. 91–92, nos. 160.3, 4, pl. 58:3 (two lekanides). In some of these cases the lekanides are not mismatched, suggesting another possible difference in practice between cemetery and settlement.45.

Unglazed saucers are common after 325 but also occur earlier in the 4th century.Saucers have been found in over 80% of the Agora pyres, where any-where from one to 17 may be present, and this is consistent with other pyres found within the city. They are more frequently absent in graveside pyres, where they are sometimes replaced by small black-gloss bowls,48 but when present, they may be even more numerous there.49 They were omit-ted from some late pyres, where offerings are typically restricted to a cup, a lamp, and a rilled-rim plate (pyres 2, 3, 23, 47, 52, 66). Other pyres from which they are absent show signs of disturbance, and they were probably a very regular item through the first third of the 3rd century.Taken in conjunction with the other miniatures—two cooking pots and a food container—the saucers are most obviously to be read as serving plates, completing the equipment necessary for a meal in miniature.Other MiniaturesThe tiny miniatures that are common in some other votive deposits were apparently not thought appropriate to the pyre ritual, for they appear only rarely in pyres. Pyre 12 includes a miniature two-handled cup of a type very common in 4th- and 3rd-century votive deposits.50 Here, however, only a tiny fragment is preserved, and it is likely to be an intrusion in the deposit, which was considerably disturbed. It is noteworthy, however, that similar cups are included in two other pyres: one discovered in the Acropolis Metro station excavations, the other a graveside pyre in the Kerameikos.51 A miniature two-handled bowl in pyre 3 is largely complete and may be part of the original assemblage (see Fig. 21).52 Whether such simple min-iatures were intended as symbolic gifts in their own right or as containers for some small offering (grain, seeds) is of course unknown. A much more puzzling piece was found in the dispersed pyre 28: a shallow plate with two ribbon handles, a ring foot, and a small ring in the center of the floor, like the cup of a kernos (P 35723, left of center in Fig. 63). The yellow clay resembles Corinthian fabric, and a similar vessel was found at Corinth in a votive deposit excavated in 1937, together with covered bowls similar to those found in some of the Athenian pyres,53 perhaps a hint of an elusive Corinthian element in the custom (see p. 88, below). In Athens, another parallel comes from a 4th-century grave along the Hiera Odos, suggesting a chthonic dimension for the shape.54 An unusually small miniature plate was another unique find in pyre 28.48.

Plates, drinking cups, and lamps recur regularly, while a few more shapes are found in one or a few examples. Many of the vessels are indistinguishable from pottery of daily use found in domestic deposits, though some had a more restricted ritual function.PlatesAmong vessels of normal size, the plate is the functional type that occurs most frequently, present in one form or another in about 90% of the pyres. Its function as a vessel for the presentation of food seems beyond doubt, enabling or at least alluding to the worshipers’ participation in the meal signified by the miniature assemblage, whether or not such sharing actually took place. Occasionally a standard black-gloss form will be used (with a rolled, broad, or thickened rim), but the ribbon-handled and the rilled-rim plate are the standard offerings (Fig. 1).While the rilled-rim plate makes up part of the normal Classical and Hellenistic ceramic assemblage, the ribbon-handled plate is exclusively a cult shape during the period under consideration. It is a simple vessel with a flat or disk base, a straight wall, a plain rim, and two ribbon handles at-tached horizontally at the rim. Exteriors are unglazed and, except in late examples, interiors are decorated with concentric gloss bands (see Fig. 7). Diameters of plates in the Agora pyres range from 11.4 to 22.0 cm, and examples larger than 15.0 cm are rare and early. The shape is virtually unknown at the Agora except in pyres; in 1951, Young could point to only three examples found in non-pyre contexts,55 and I am aware of only two more that have been discovered since;56 all are probably displaced from pyres.This simple shape has an extraordinarily long history. Its ancestors can be recognized in large vessels with well-formed ribbon handles that emerged in the second half of the 8th century.57 While the interiors are occasionally banded,58 like those of later pyre plates, serious decoration is concentrated on the outside of the vessel: bands, swastikas, or leaves on the wall, and stars, wheels, or rosettes on the underside. Although they are a staple of the cemetery, ribbon-handled plates are also well represented in domestic deposits of the time, and the decorated exteriors suggest that they were intended for proud display, hung by the handles on the wall.59 The shape continued through the 7th century, sometimes smaller in size, and increasingly simple in decoration: bands or wavy lines outside, glazed 55.

Plates with simple banded interiors, perhaps arising as a further simplification, first appear in graves and their attendant offering places shortly before the end of the 5th century.67 They show up in Agora pyres within the next decade.Ribbon-handled plates appear in nearly three-quarters of the Agora pyres, most commonly as a matched pair, though single instances are not unusual, and as many as six may be present.

A derivative version, with a reserved rim and lacking the offsets and moldings of the original plates, was common in pyres from ca. 375 onward and may have been developed especially for ritual use. If so, it was soon adopted for domestic use as well and developed into a common household shape of the Hellenistic period.72 The rilled-rim plate thus counts as the only plate of the standard household assemblage that is regularly associated with pyres. The association was clearly a strong one, for the plate is included in a group of small 3rd-century pyres where the characteristic miniatures are absent (pyres 2, 5, 23, 47, 52, 66). Overall the rilled-rim plate occurs in about half of the Agora pyres and is reported from about a third of the graveside pyres at the Kerameikos.73 Most commonly there is only a single example, but nine Agora pyres preserve two, and larger numbers (up to five) were occasionally dedicated. Simpler forms of the plate, where the rim is concave or convex on top, could be substituted (e.g., in pyres 24, 54; see Figs. 56, 102);74 these are rare and probably were made only for ritual use.Other plates from the standard black-gloss repertoire are rarely found in pyres. The rolled-rim plate—probably the most common table form of the 4th century—occurs three times (in pyres 7, 12, 35).75 Pyre 25 includes a broad-rim plate, largely an Archaic shape and rare even in the 5th century;76 its presence in so late a context (ca. 375) is surprising and possibly deliberately archaizing. Pyre 40 contains an unglazed plate with a thickened rim—a normal household shape, despite the lack of gloss.77 An unusual variant of the same form, this time glazed, was included in pyre 63a. A fragment of a fish plate was found in pyre 18, of the first half of the 4th century, but it may be intrusive from surrounding soil.Drinking CupsDrinking cups are very common, occurring in all of the undisturbed pyres and in over 70% of the Agora pyres as a whole. It is these vessels, most frequently, that supply the date for a pyre, since parallels can be found in the well-dated sequences of table ware published in Agora XII and Agora XXIX.

Bolsals and cup-skyphoi (Fig. 4:4, 6) join them in the first quarter of the 4th century, to be replaced by the varieties of kantharoi and cup-kantharoi and the related calyx cup introduced in the course of the century (Fig. 4:7–13). Skyphoi (Fig. 4:2, 3) are the most common cup offerings, documented from the 5th century to the first quarter of the 3rd, with a slight preference for the Corinthian type. A Corinthian skyphos occurs in the Agora’s earliest pyre (38), the Attic version only a little later, in the last quarter of the 5th century (in pyre[?] 48). Both continue into the 3rd century (e.g., in pyres 21, 62) but are then replaced by Hellenistic shapes: the West Slope skyphos (in pyre 66; Fig. 4:14) or, more commonly, small Hellenistic kantharoi with either angular or baggy contours (e.g., in pyres 2, 37; Fig. 4:15, 16).Occasionally these contexts shed further light on the function or even the dating of the cups. It has been debated whether the one-handler was used to serve food or drink;78 its repeated presence in the pyres argues strongly that here, at least, it was a drinking cup. In another case, the pyre assemblages suggest a small adjustment in the terminal date of the squat-rimmed cup-kantharos. Sparkes and Talcott limited this uncommon variant of the shape to the second and third quarters of the 4th century.79 The cup in pyre 1 (see Fig. 17) is similar in profile to their latest example, which they dated ca. 325,80 but it was found with chytridia and lopadia made of household fabric,81 an innovation that was not introduced until ca. 315. The cup’s resting surface is slightly worn, allowing a few years of use before deposit ca. 315, but the likelihood is that it was made after 325.Although some of these cups are identical in all respects to those found in ordinary domestic debris, many are smaller than the average. All of the Hellenistic kantharoi belong to the small series of the shape, under 9.0 cm in height, in contrast to 11.0 cm or more for the shape in general. None of the bolsals measures over 10.0 cm in diameter, which puts them among the smaller of the Agora examples, overall,82 and the bolsal in pyre 39 (Diam. 6.4 cm) almost qualifies as a miniature. Most of the Classical kan-tharoi and cup-kantharoi are of normal size, but those in pyre 46 are small in comparison to contemporary examples. The cup-skyphos in pyre 7 is also much smaller than normal, and the one-handlers in pyres 25 and 39 are near miniatures. The Corinthian skyphos of the 4th century is a small shape; the average height of those published in Agora XII is a little over 9 cm. Some of those in pyres, however, take this to an extreme (e.g., those in pyre 21), and conform to what was clearly a simplified, votive version of the shape. Two of the Attic skyphoi are full-size (in pyres 7 and 33[?]), but most examples are small, of a size paralleled in votive deposits (e.g., in pyres 16, 42, 43, 62).83 In sum, there is a range from ordinary vessels that would not look out of place on the table, to small but functional ves-sels, to a few that seem to be true votive or miniature versions of standard shapes. Perhaps people selected smaller vessels when they chose cups for use in the pyre ceremony, but more probably all of these smaller versions were intended from the beginning for cult purposes. The cups suggest libations,84 but they could also have functioned to provide a small drink of 78. Agora XII, p. 124; Agora XXIX, p. 155.79. Agora XII, p. 120.80. P 28557, cf.

Most of the cups show no trace of wear on their resting surfaces; they were new (a stipulation that occurs in some sacred laws for more canonical rituals),85 and, like the rest of the assemblage, purchased specifically for the pyre ceremony.LampsLamps are a regular feature of the pyres, present in 10 of the 17 undisturbed pyres and in about half of all pyres excavated at the Agora. Although this percentage indicates that they were not essential to the assemblage, it is noteworthy that when, in the latest pyres, the assemblage is reduced to only a few shapes, the lamp is almost always present (pyres 2, 23, 47, 52, 66, 69), Usually there is only one lamp in the assemblage, but five pyres contain two (pyres 3, 9, 21, 31, 46).86 The pattern is about the same for settlement pyres found elsewhere in Athens and Attica.87 Lamps are surprisingly rare, however, in graveside pyres,88 which again points to differences between the cemetery and settlement pyres; nor are they common offerings in con-temporary Athenian graves.89 They are, however, found in large numbers in sanctuaries, particularly of Demeter, Artemis, and Athena. There they are generally classed as “votives,” but may also have played a role in ceremonies and provided light for ritual dining.90The practical function of a lamp is unambiguous—it provides light—and it has been suggested that the presence of lamps in the pyres indicates that the ritual took place at night.91 Lamps might also have been called for if the ceremony or some part of it took place in a closed and therefore dark space. Among undisturbed pyres, only four that were located within buildings are lacking lamps (1, 32, 44, 62), and one of those may have been buried when the house was in a ruinous state and perhaps roofless. But whether activities took place inside or at night, a single lamp could hardly have shed enough light for the sacrifice and butchering of an animal and the attendant activities. Torches would have been needed for any significant 85.

Observation of signs of use on the lamps raises further questions about how they were utilized in the ceremony. A few have battered bodies and worn resting surfaces, suggesting extensive past use92 and indicating that those lamps were chosen from among the furnishings of the home. Most, however, lack any trace of wear on their resting surfaces, and, like most of the other offerings, must have been purchased specifically for the ritual. While post-deposition burning often makes it difficult to determine whether these lamps were ever lighted, it is rare that extensive traces of burning can be detected on the nozzles.93 A similar absence of burning has been observed on lamps found in the sanctuaries of the Eleusinian goddesses. Eva Parisinou speculates that they may have been lit only once, at the time of their presentation, and that the light itself, rather than the lamp, was the gift.94 The pyre lamps, then, may be more symbolic than utilitarian; if they were lighted, it was only briefly and in the context of the ritual, not to provide lasting illumination for the activities involved.Covered BowlsA broad, shallow bowl with a rounded bottom and a rim fitted for a lid (Fig. 1) occurs as a singleton or pair in three pyres (4, 41, 46), and small fragments have been found in two or three others (pyres 54, 55, and perhaps 3).95 The shape is found in graveside pyres and in at least one grave as well,96 but also in household debris, so its association with the pyres is not exclusive. It probably served as a food container, paralleling the symbolic function of the pyre lekanis, in the same way that full-size plates parallel the miniature saucers. The ware is unusual: hard and very thin-walled, with gloss on the inside only, features that associate it with the banded lebes, another shape that is found in both pyres and domestic deposits. The two were probably made in the same shops. Surprisingly, closely similar vessels frequently furnish graves and votive deposits on the Lipari islands,97 and they have also been found at Corinth.98 Roger Edwards thought the latter were of 92. E.g., L 6133 in pyre 19, the sur-face and resting surface worn; L 1727 (Agora IV, p. 96, no. 415, pls. 15, 41) in pyre 23, battered and lacking the end of the nozzle; L 4021 (Agora IV, p. 75, no. 318, pls. 11, 39) in pyre 49, with traces of burning on the nozzle and a somewhat worn resting surface.93. The same is true of lamps from pyres at the Acropolis Metro station excavations (Eleftheratou 1996–1997, p. 116), and of the three lamps from the Building Z pyres, in contrast to lamps found elsewhere in the building (Kera-meikos XVII, p. 75).94.

A variety of small bowls and saltcellars, about the same size as saucers, may have served as upscale versions of the same. Shallow bowls with a broad resting surface (“broad-based bowls”)100 occur in single examples in three Agora pyres (7, 11, 57; see Fig. 36). They are much more common, however, in Keramei-kos graveside pyres, where they often appear in multiples.101 Saltcellars, with single examples in pyre(?) 45 and pyre 49 (see Figs. 90, 97), again are represented more abundantly in the graveyard.102 Small bowls with thinner walls, distinguished from saucers only by their ring feet, occur in pyres 22 and 28 (see Figs. 52, 63) and are also found occasionally in cemetery pyres.103 Diminutive echinus bowls, larger than saltcellars but smaller than the usual table size, are found twice as well (in pyres 7, 15; see Figs. 31, 42).Larger black-gloss bowls, probably duplicating the function of the plates, are rare: the Agora pyres preserve one example each of a large saucer with a projecting rim (in pyre 5), a bowl with an outturned rim (in pyre 30), and an echinus bowl (in pyre[?] 45) (see Figs. 27, 66, 90).104Another dimension of the offerings, however, is suggested by a small number of ceramic oil containers: squat lekythoi (in pyres 6, 38, 42, 45[?]; see Figs. 29, 84, 90), gutti (in pyre 41 and perhaps in pyre 14; see Figs. 41, 82), and an askos (in pyre 59; see Fig. 110) in the Classical pyres, and gray unguentaria in Hellenistic ones (3, 19, 37; see Figs. 21, 48, 76). Although they crop up in no more than 15% of the pyres, they demonstrate that the offerings of oil referred to symbolically by the dummy alabastra (see pp. 35–37, below) were sometimes made in earnest. Oil vessels are oc-casionally reported from settlement pyres elsewhere,105 but are more com-mon and diverse in shape in graveside pyres,106 and the squat lekythos and unguentarium are of course extremely common grave gifts.10799.

It is a rare shape, and other examples from the Agora were not found in ritual contexts.109 The extremely thin walls, however, make one wonder about the functionality of these vessels, and Sparkes and Talcott point out that the fabric is similar to that of the covered bowls closely associated with pyres, and like them they are glazed only on the interior.Occasionally a vessel of more general ritual function furnishes a pyre. Two fragmentary thymiateria, vessels used for burning incense in both ritual and secular contexts,110 have been found in Agora pyres. One, preserved as fragments of the hollow stand, rim, and lid of a common Hellenistic form,111 comes from pyre(?) 45 (see Fig. 90, lower right), a deposit that deviates significantly from the canonical; the only exclusively pyre vessels it contains are two chytridia, and it is possible that it reflects a different ceremony. The thymiaterion in pyre 12 (see Fig. 37, front row, second from left) is of the Classical form, where the bowl rests on a thinner, solid stem.112 Only the lower stem and foot are preserved, and it may be an intrusion from the sur-rounding soil. The thymiateria can therefore not be used as firm evidence for the burning of incense as part of the pyre ritual. Single kernoi, also fragmentary, were found in pyres 15 and 26 (see Fig. 42, middle row, second from left, and Fig. 61, left). Margaret Miles has recently reasserted Frank Brommer’s argument that these vessels, which are closely associated with the Eleusinian divinities, are properly termed plemochoai, and were used for libations.113 They could well have fulfilled that function in the pyre ceremony.other types of offeringsAlabastraYoung pointed to alabastra as indicators of the chthonic character of the pyres,114 an observation that remains valid, although they occur in only six pyres at the Agora (21, 36, 41, 43, 44, 49; see Figs. 51, 82, 85, 87, 97) and, among published settlement pyres elsewhere, in three at the Kerameikos.115 Their representation is limited to the span of ca. 350–275, and thus they do not appear to have been part of the original pyre assemblage as constituted 50 or more years earlier. All of the alabastra from the Agora pyres are local products made of poros, rather than the more costly and usually imported 108. For the form, see Agora XXXIII, pp. 73–76.

Although the shape is frequently represented in scenes of women’s activities on Athenian figured vases, and ceramic alabastra with figured decoration are common in domestic deposits, the stone vessels are almost never found within settlements, either in Athens or elsewhere.117 Hollow alabastra made of alabaster118 furnished graves throughout the Greek Mediterranean from the mid-6th century on, included there as containers of gifts of perfumed oil, often imported.119 They occur with some frequency (though they cannot be called common) in both male and female graves in Athenian cemeteries of the later 5th through the early 3rd centuries, and occasionally earlier.120 Judging from published cemetery contexts, the solid substitutes were rarely deposited within the grave itself,121 though they do occur alongside functional vessels in other funerary deposits, as a way of expanding display without excessive cost.122 Alabastra are also an occasional item in graveside 116.

In a review of the diffusion of these objects throughout the Mediter-ranean, Elia and Cavallo (2002, p. 11, n. 5) cite only three instances: Olynthus XIII, pp. 422–423, nos. 1068–1069 A, pl. 256; Himera II, p. 84, no. 1, pl. XIII:1; and an unpublished alabastron at Epizephyrian Lokris. Six alabastra are listed among furniture and textiles on the Attic stelai, documenting their presence in a house (Amyx 1958, pp. 213–217). I know of five fragments of alabaster alabastra from the Agora: ST 343 (from a 5th-century sacrificial pit); ST 565, in the Middle Stoa build-ing fill, which was brought into the area from elsewhere; ST 808 and ST 816, fragments found in a commercial area east of the public square, possibly awaiting sale; ST 1018, a small frag-ment in fill under the southern end of the Stoa of Attalos and (coinciden-tally?) found in the layer into which pyre 70 was dug. The latter three may be related to the perfume trade that operated outside the southeast corner of the square (Agora XXXIII, pp. 139–140). An unfinished alabastron and a core drilled out to form one (ST 465 and ST 753, both made of marble) show that marble alabastra were manu-factured at Athens (see also n. 119, below).118. The term is used loosely to refer to either true Egyptian alabaster (calcite, onyx) or gypsum, similar in appearance but softer; distinctions between the two are not generally made in the archaeological literature (Carter 1998, p. 761).119. Carter 1998, pp. 757–761; Elia and Cavallo 2002; Cavallo 2004. Im- port of the vessels and their contents from Egypt is likely, but tubes of ala-baster representing cores drilled out for the manufacture of the vessels have been found on the Pnyx, indicating local manufacture from imported ma- terial (Davidson and Thompson 1943, p. 99, no. 11, fig. 44).120. E.g., they are reported from about one-sixth of the graves published in Kerameikos XIV (nos. 8, 13, 16, 22– 24, 27, 31, 32, 42, 46, 47, 53, 55, 59, 64, 65, 68, 88, 89, 92, 101, 107, 110, 114, 133, 142), dating between ca. 400 and 275, but from only seven of the ca. 140 Classical graves in the Eridanos cem-etery (Schlörb-Vierneisel 1966, nos. 74, 131, 132, 141, 145–147), with a date range of ca. 440–325. They are listed in only three of the over 600 graves pub-lished in Kerameikos VII.2, pp. 63–66, 73–74, 82–83, nos. 234, 261, 282 (525–430).

It is tempting to conclude that alabastra were added to the assemblage only when the introduction of the poros dummy alabastron—which is not, to my knowledge, documented before the middle of the 4th century—made available a cheap substitute for a more expensive offering.CoinsCoins have been found in association with 10 undisturbed or minimally disturbed pyres at the Agora (2, 3, 5, 15, 18, 34[?], 44, 45[?], 58, 62), though they have rarely been published from pyres elsewhere.124 Most are single instances, but the number may be as high as five or six, and all are small change, bronze coins of local, Athenian issues. Such coins often come to light in domestic floors and other strata and could easily have found their way into a pyre with the earth that covered it over. They occur with sufficient regularity, however, to suggest that the coins were deliberately included.Coin votives are well attested throughout the Greek world and in Athens in particular. The Acropolis inventories list them in large numbers, and they made up about one-sixth of the votives listed in the Asklepieion inscriptions.125 Coins are documented as building dedications, beginning with the famous deposit of early coinage at the Temple of Artemis in Ephe-sos,126 but also in less elevated circumstances, under the floors of ordinary houses.127 More relevant to the case at hand, they have been found in mixed deposits of ash, burnt bone, and votive vessels that clearly represent the residue of sacrifice.128 Viewed in this light, the deposit of coins would not be inappropriate to the pyre ritual.123. Kerameikos XIV, pp. 41, 44, 45, 59, nos. 28.25–27, 36.7, 8, 37.16, 41.4, 5, 57.15–17, pl. 37. The cemetery also contained two offerings consisting exclusively of alabastra (Kerameikos XIV, pp. 42–43, 46, nos. 34, 43, pls. 39, 41).124. Two coins are listed among the contents of a possible pyre south of the Acropolis, on Erechtheion Street (ArchDelt 23, B ́1, 1968, p. 57). A sub-floor deposit in Building Z contained a bronze coin and a skyphos; due to the lack of the characteristic pyre shapes, it has been excluded from the present study, though it may reflect a similar ritual (Kerameikos XVII, p. 174, no. 457). Four bronze coins were found in the large deposit, “grosse Grube,” in precinct XIII of the Eckterrasse, clearly a funerary offering of some sort, but with no trace of burning and lacking the distinctive pyre assemblage (Kera-meikos XIV, pp. 117–118, nos. 119.93–96).125. For a useful summary of the practice of dedicating coins, see Nemea III, pp. 34–35.

These have been found in three pyres: single instances in pyres 12 and 33(?) (see Figs. 37, 71), and a pair in pyre 4. The two single instances are smooth spheres, while the pair is more irregular, more like pellets than true balls. Such objects are rare enough at the Agora to suggest that their occurrence in the pyres is not haphazard, and that they should be considered as part of the votive deposit.Similar but larger balls have been found in graves and wells of the Geometric period and the 7th century,129 where they have been interpreted as toys, weights, or marking crayons. John Papadopoulos has published three smaller, unglazed clay balls from the dump of a 7th-century potter’s workshop;130 he makes no suggestion about their function, but their context opens the possibility that they had something to do with the potter’s craft.Classical and Hellenistic examples are rare but enjoy the same diversity of context and interpretation. Eight small clay balls, about a centimeter in diameter, were found in a male cremation grave in the Kerameikos, dating to about 340,131 and four of poros, ranging from 1.8 to 2.1 cm in diameter and interpreted as possible gaming pieces, in the sarcophagus burial of a child(?) of the mid-5th century there.132 A similar marble ball was found in the cistern and well associated with the House of Menon and Mikion, which was occupied by marbleworkers and coroplasts, possibly suggesting its use in an industrial setting.133 Marble balls ranging in size from 1.5 to 2.2 cm in diameter and found in both domestic and funerary contexts on Delos and Rheneia have been interpreted as gaming pieces.134 Finally, a clay ball from the Agora measuring 1.7 cm in diameter (like the largest of the pyre balls) has been published as a kleroterion ball; the sole support for this is its size, the same as that of bronze balls associated with allotment both by their inscribed letters and their findspots.135 Funerary and craft associations might make sense with the pyres, but the function of the balls remains obscure; possibly they are the only physical remains of some object largely constructed of perishable materials.LoomweightsLoomweights have not been found in undisturbed Agora pyres, but in two instances occur in association with dispersed pyre material. A chytridion, a lopadion, and fragments of pyre lekanides, ribbon-handled plates, and pyre saucers testify to the existence of a pyre, redeposited in the fill over and around the east wall of a house south of the Agora square (pyre 59; see Fig. 110). Two loomweights were found with them. To the southwest of the public square, in Early Building II, a lopadion, ribbon-handled plates, pyre saucers, and fragments of a pyre lekanis were found together with three mismatched loomweights (in pyre 28; see Fig. 63). Loomweights are very common and need not in these two cases be part of the original assemblage. One of the pyres in Building Z, however, and four of those in the Eckterrasse cemetery at the Kerameikos include loomweights,136 so we should not dismiss the Agora finds out of hand. Loomweights are 129. Kerameikos V.1, p. 213, pl. 15 (Geometric child’s grave); Brann 1961a, p. 123, no. L 44, pl. 22 (Geometric well); Young 1939, p. 192, no. C 176, fig. 142 (7th-century well).

They are occasionally found in graves and, although weaving is generally associated with women, occur in both male and female burials.137 In the former case, it has been suggested that they refer to the profession of the deceased,138 and it may be that the loomweights found in pyres, if they are not strays, refer to craft activities.Metal ObjectsMetal objects are rarely reported from published pyres,139 but items made of bronze, iron, and lead were recovered from five Agora pyres (2, 3, 11, 18, 24). The more frequently occurring metal is lead, and it is perhaps worth mentioning that lead objects, when present, sometimes appear in multiples: two in pyre 24 and five in pyre 18. All of the pyres in question were located in industrial areas, where metal waste was not uncommon, and small metal pieces may have come from the surrounding fill: e.g., three small pieces of lead cut into curved forms in pyre 18, a small sheet of iron in pyre 3, and a piece of bronze in pyre 2. The two bronze tacks in pyre 18 and an iron nail in pyre 3 could also have strayed from the workbench, but tacks and nails are also found in some of the graveside pyres at the Kerameikos.140 That a certain amount of magical symbolism was attached to the nail is witnessed by its use in the preparation of curse tablets, through which nails were often driven, perhaps to make the spell more painful to the recipient, or simply to increase its binding and fixative power.141Some of the larger metal items must be intentional inclusions in the votive deposit. A fragmentary lead lamp holder found in the badly disturbed pyre 24 (see Fig. 56) bears witness to an absent lamp.142 The same pyre contained a small cylindrical lead vessel, probably a pyxis.143 A small lead disk from pyre 11 may be a pyxis lid (see Fig. 36, center), and an unequivocal pyxis lid, with a downturned edge and a knob handle (IL 2044), lay not far away. Although it was not found in direct association with the pyre, it was accompanied by fragments of a pyre saucer and may ultimately come from that pyre or another. It is intriguing that a paral-lel situation exists elsewhere, in House D to the southwest of the public square; there a pyxis lid (IL 1009) was found in the layer just above pyre 39, where a lamp belonging to the pyre was also unearthed (L 4440). This gives us three pyres with some association with a lead pyxis, a shape that is not 137.

There is some ancient evidence to indicate that the coldness, heaviness, and color of lead sometimes associated it with death and the underworld;146 most such indications are Roman in date, however, and it is uncertain that these concepts existed in our period. Lead was a cheap, common, and malleable material, which provides sufficient explanation for its presence in pyres.TextilesMicroscopic examination of vessels from two recently found pyres (4, 15) has revealed evidence of textiles.147 The structure of the textile is preserved in pseudomorphs, in which it appears that soil minerals have replaced the textile through a process that is not yet understood. Conservator Julie Unruh, who first noticed this phenomenon, reports that the textile docu-mented on pottery in pyre 4 has a thread count of about 10 x 13 threads per cm, probably a plain weave of Z-spun yarns with a diameter of about 0.6 mm.148 Some of the pyre ceramics, it seems, were wrapped in cloth before they were deposited.149 In some cases the textile appears to extend onto a broken edge, which may indicate that the pot in question was already broken when it was wrapped and laid to rest. Since these fragile traces survive only in the soil on the surface of the pot and are completely removed by the conventional washing with which pyres found earlier in the history of the excavation were treated, it is possible that such wrap-ping was a more common feature of burial than we can now document. A mid-5th-century law from Selinous describing rituals for purification stipulates the laying of a table with a clean cloth for the entertainment of divinities;150 such a practice could explain the textiles here, though this is admittedly speculative, and other roles for the cloth could be imagined.Miscellaneous ObjectsA miscellany of artifacts made of bone, glass, and clay may be chance inclu-sions intrusive from the surrounding soil. A small fragment preserving the lower leg of a frontal Pan, perhaps from a terracotta plaque, was found in the earth surrounding pyre 9. Although figurines are represented in subfloor 144. A search through the records reveals only four analogous lids, none of them published (IL 565, IL 626, IL 1304, IL 1779).145. A lead pyxis from the necropo-lis of Chatby in Alexandria contained a greasy blackish substance, presumed to be some sort of cosmetic or toiletry (Breccia 1912, p. 174), but the shape no doubt served to hold a variety of sub-stances.146. Scholars have discussed the significance of the use of lead for curse tablets for over a century (Watson 1991, p. 195, with references to ancient sources and earlier bibliography). Recent opinion is skeptical about any special resonance of the material, at least before the Roman period (Gager 1992, pp. 3–4).147. Unruh 2002, pp. 31–33. Such traces have been observed on a ribbon-handled plate and a small unglazed saucer in pyre 4 (P 34058, P 34089) and on a ribbon-handled plate in pyre 15 (P 35428).148. Unruh 2002, pp. 31–33.149.

Probably also chance inclusions are a brown glass bead in pyre 49, a bone cylinder, perhaps a furniture joint,152 in pyre 9 (see Fig. 34, lower right), and a bone disk decorated with concentric ridges in pyre(?) 45 (see Fig. 90, center, bottom), perhaps a furniture appliqué or a large button.153 Two bone rings in a possible pyre (33; see Fig. 71) may also be buttons or eyelets for shoes or armor.154 A single ring of the same type was deposited with seven alabastra as a graveside offering at the Kera- meikos,155 hinting that the inclusion of the rings in pyre(?) 33 could be intentional.organic MaterialThe recovery of organic material was not a priority in the earlier years of the Agora excavations, so it was something of a surprise to discover that a fair amount of bone and charcoal from pyres had been saved along with the uninventoried context pottery. Flotation of the earth from some of the pyres excavated since the 1980s has recovered more bone and charcoal, along with a small collection of other organic remains. A sample of this mate-rial has been examined, enabling a preliminary discussion of the organic contents of some of the pyres.The presence of bone is documented either by written account or physical presence in two-thirds of the pyres, and in well over half of these instances it is still extant. It is currently under study by Snyder and will form the basis of a future publication. Often the bone had been so thor-oughly burnt that only small fragments remained, suggesting that it was placed on the fire well before the other, more lightly burnt offerings joined it. Preliminary results indicate that the burnt bone is exclusively that of ovicaprids156—a common choice for private offerings157—and represents the meat-poor parts of the animal that were routinely burnt in Greek sac-rificial practice.158 Although simple pieces of meat could have been burnt as offerings, the uniformity of species and the selection of body parts is a strong indication that the pyre ritual included the sacrifice of an animal, at least in some cases. The price of such an animal would have been in the range of 10 to 17 drachmas,159 perhaps a considerable outlay for an 151.

At least one victim was far from the “perfect” animal one envisions for sacrifice: a sheep with a damaged leg and an abscessed jaw in pyre 4. If price was the most important consideration in a choice of victim, the sacrificer in this instance must have been very constrained for funds. Snyder has also noted a bias toward the left side of the animal.160 This may be a reference to the chthonic character of the recipients of the sacrifice. Greek sacred laws, however, often stipulate the right side of an offering for officiating priests or priestesses,161 so the statistics may instead reflect a desire to retain the right, and more auspicious side, for the living. Whatever the motive, a preference for the left side of the victim has also been attested in the zooarchaeological record elsewhere.162Maria Ntinou has examined the charcoal from eight pyres (3, 4, 7, 8, 12, 32, 35, 49). Details of her analysis are given in Appendix I, but the most striking result is the high representation of olive. Given the ubiquity of the tree and its intensive cultivation in the Attic countryside, this is perhaps to be expected. As Ntinou points out, however, the association of the olive with Athena and the history of Athens may also have made it particularly appropriate for ritual use.163 Other fuel includes other agricultural products (grapevine, perhaps pear tree), but wild species (evergreen oak) also occur.Further plant material has been identified in flotation samples from pyres 4, 5, 11, 12, 16, and 18. Evi Margaritis examined these and was able to identify, along with a few fish scales and bones, the remains of fruits in four pyres (fig, grape [raisin?], and olive), nuts in three (almond, walnut, pine nut, and acorn), grains of wheat and/or barley in four, and single instances of pea and perhaps broad bean. All of the fruits could have been dried, so they give no clue to the season in which the offering was made. Whether these should be considered as offerings or as remnants of a real meal following the sacrifice is uncertain, but these findings contribute to the richness of our picture of the pyre phenomenon and add specificity to comments made by one excavator about the possible presence of food remains in two pyres.164160.

Only the right side was represented in a single deposit, and a mixture of left and right in the other three (Snyder and Rotroff 2003).161.

MacKinnon (2010) has re- ported on the left-sidedness of offer-ings to the hero Opheltes at Nemea. He contrasts this with offerings to gods, which often favor the right side, arguing that the left side was deliber-ately chosen for underworld deities. Note, however, that the left horns of goats predominate in the remains of sacrifices to the very Olympian god Apollo at Dreros (Marinatos 1936, pp. 241–244; Deonna 1940). One- sidedness is also attested for the Kera-ton at Delos, an interwoven altar made of horns, supposedly built by Apollo himself, using exclusively either the left (Plut. Thes. 21.2) or the right (Plut. De soll. an. 35.9) horns. For the possi- ble identification of this monument, see Délos XL, pp. 59–79.163. Preference for a particular wood for sacrifice is documented, for example, at Olympia, where only white poplar was acceptable (Paus. 5.13.3, 5.14.2).164. D. B. Thompson listed “some carbonized wheat(?)” among the con-tents of pyre 21 (Notebook ΛΛ I V, p. 704) and “some carbonized food” in pyre 58 (Notebook Φ VIII, p. 1518)."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"chapter 3Chronologythe evIDenCe For DatIngWhen present, full-size, black-gloss vessels—especially drinking cups and, to a lesser degree, lamps—provide the surest evidence for the dating of sau-cer pyres. The chronology presented here is largely based on that evidence, occasionally bolstered by coins. Even when such indicators are lacking, details of selected votive shapes can help define the probable chronological range to which a given pyre belongs. The following chronological indicators are drawn from observation of the Agora pyres and from published details of pyres excavated elsewhere in Athens.Chytridion and lopadionFabric and potting technique are decisive chronological pointers for the miniature cooking shapes. The earliest were handmade of gritty cooking ware, while the latest were made on the wheel of plain household fabric, and the switch from one to the other fabric can be pinpointed with some accuracy. The occurrence in pyre 44 (see Fig. 87) of cooking-ware chytridia together with household ware lopadia, one of them with a cooking-ware lid, demonstrates that this was a period of transition. Fortunately, a kantharos and a calyx cup provide robust evidence for the date of the pyre, which must have been buried in the course of the last quarter of the 4th century. Further evidence comes from the pyres of the third phase of Building Z at the Kerameikos. Lopadia and probably also chytridia in the earliest pyres there, associated with the construction and the earlier part of phase 3 in the third quarter of the 4th century, are of cooking ware, while those in two later pyres, dating shortly before the destruction of the building no later than 307, are made of household ware.1 Vessels of plain household ware 1. Pyres with cooking-ware lopadia: Kerameikos XVII, nos. 449, 450, 453, 454, 456. Pyres with household-ware lopadia: Kerameikos XVII, nos. 455, 460, the latter directly under the later floor 5 of the phase. The pattern appears to be the same for chytridia, but the fabrics are more difficult to determine from photographs in this case, since the forms of cooking-ware and household-ware chytridia can be similar."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"chapter 344probably do not occur before about 315.2 Miniature cooking vessels made of cooking ware are rare after 315 and do not occur after 300.3Shape is generally not a decisive dating factor, but one form of the cooking-ware lopadion, with a flaring rim, is restricted to the end of the sequence of cooking-ware vessels, possibly not occurring before ca. 340 (Fig. 6:A).4 It occurs in pyres 11, 29, 35, and 51. Down to about 300, household-ware lopadia have rounded bottoms, following the precedent of cooking-ware lopadia. After 300, however, the undersides of lopadia were trimmed on the wheel to form a flat resting surface or a slightly raised base (Fig. 6:B).5lekanisLekanides of forms other than the pyre lekanis are not documented in pyres buried after about 360, at the Agora or elsewhere. Among pyre lekanides, a ring foot is very rare after ca. 350,6 when it is replaced by a solid disk 2. The earliest instance among cem-etery pyres (Schlörb-Vierneisel 1966, pp. 91–92, nos. 160.31–33, pl. 58:3) is consistent with this conclusion, if it was buried at the latter end of its published date (early fourth quarter of the 4th century, an approximation based on the pyre’s stratigraphic position).3.

Unglazed pyre lekanides occur only after 300. The form of the knob of the pyre lekanis offers some broad guidelines (Fig. 6:C). The profiled knob does not appear after 315, and most examples date before 330.7 With one exception,8 a cylindrical knob on a low stem is found only in Agora pyres dating to the span of ca. 325–275. In the Eckterrasse grave precincts at the Kerameikos, however, this form occurs with some regularity from at least 350 onward,9 so the Agora distribution may be due to chance. The simplest form, a plain flaring knob, occurs sporadically in the third quarter of the 4th century, but most examples date between ca. 315 and 260.10ribbon-Handled PlateThe form of the foot and the patterns of glazing provide hints for the dat-ing of the ribbon-handled plate. The ring foot is found only on the earliest plates, dating to the beginning of the 4th century.11 A well-finished disk foot is typical of the first half of the 4th century. It occurs less frequently after ca. 330, when it is less carefully made and the string marks are no longer smoothed from the bottom. A flat base may occur at any time in the sequence but is very common after 340, almost always with string marks.Most of the plates are decorated with gloss bands on the floor, but the practice barely survives the end of the 4th century.12 An unglazed version occurs in the Agora pyres only after 300, though there are some slightly earlier instances in the Eridanos cemetery.13 Plates with gloss only 7. I suspect that an example in one of the later pyres of phase 3 of Building Z (Kerameikos XVII, p. 173, no. 455.28, pl. 102), dating shortly before the de- struction of the building before ca. 307, may in fact come from the earlier pyre that lay directly below it (Kerameikos XVII, no. 454). See p. 60, below.8. The only instance perhaps from an earlier pyre is an uninventoried frag-ment found in association with pyre 57. The bulk of that pyre was probably originally buried ca. 375, but it is in a secondary deposit, with one piece (a type 25B lamp) dating no earlier than 340. The fragmentary lekanis may therefore be later.9. Kerameikos XIV, pp. 17, 40, 60, nos. 18.4, 5, 28.2, 3, 60.2, pls. 30, 37, 45.10. A fragmentary and much better made predecessor occurs in the dis-turbed pyre 59 (P 34417), which ap- parently dates within the first half of the 4th century. One or perhaps two come from the earlier series of pyres of the third phase of Building Z, proba- bly buried before ca. 325 (Kerameikos XVII, pp. 170, 172, nos. 450.8, 454.21, pls. 100, 103, but see p. 60, below, for the possible displacement of the latter). The only instance that may be earlier is in a graveside pyre in the Eckterrasse (Kerameikos XIV, p. 43, no. 35.2, pl. 39), which Kovacsovics places in phase 1d of the precinct, ending with the deposit of layer e1 (for the stratigraphy, see pp. 25–27); he dates layer e1 to the middle of the 4th century, and the pyre therefore shortly before 350. This is puzzling, since the bowl-kantharos in the pyre (p. 43, no. 35.1, fig. 76, pl. 39) looks considerably later. It is deeper and has a narrower foot than Agora XII, p. 285, no. 688, fig. 7, pl. 28 (dated 350–325 by Sparkes and Talcott), sug-gesting a date at least as late as the latter part of the third quarter of the century. Kovacsovics dates a pyre with a closely similar bowl-kantharos (Kera-meikos XIV, p. 71, no. 79.1, fig. 77, pl. 48) to the early 3rd century (though I would place it slightly earlier, perhaps just within the 4th century). I therefore think it likely that Kerameikos XIV, no. 35, should be dated later, perhaps ca. 335–325. Even so, it presents an early context for a pyre lekanis with a flaring knob.11. E.g., P 32981, from pyre 6, dated ca. 400–390. A second plate with a ring foot (P 36563) came from the disturbed and poorly dated pyre 61.12. Only two examples certainly date after 300: two plates in pyre 21, cur-rently placed ca. 300–275. Two banded plates were found in a graveside pyre in the Westpfad of the Eckterrasse, there dated to the early 3rd century (Kera-meikos XIV, p. 72, nos. 79.8, 9). The incurved rim of the bowl-kantharos in that pyre, however, suggests a date before the end of the 4th century.13. Schlörb-Vierneisel 1966, pp. 92, 95, nos. 160.5, 6, 168.2, pls. 58:4, 59:4; the published date of both pyres is the early fourth quarter of the 4th century. Both include lopadia made of house-hold ware, making a date after ca. 315 likely. No. 168, however, cannot be too much later, for it also contains a cup-kantharos with a squat rim, a shape that probably did not survive until the end of the 4th century (Schlörb-Vierneisel 1966, p. 95, no. 168.1, pl. 59:4)."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"chapter 346on the handles are documented briefly, during the span of ca. 315–275 (Fig. 7).rilled-rim PlateEarlier examples of the rilled-rim plate have gloss on all surfaces except the rim and the resting surface, while in later plates only the floor is glazed.

Glazing patterns show some limited chrono-logical development. Thick gloss can occur at any time, but a thin wash is not documented before ca. 385. Unglazed saucers are first found at that time also, but most date after 325.ChronoLogICaL DeveLoPmentSaucer pyres are largely limited to the 4th and 3rd centuries, but the pre-cise dates at which the custom was introduced and at which it fell into abeyance are difficult to pinpoint. The earliest fully canonical pyres at the Agora were buried in the first decade of the 4th century (6, 53), but there are some earlier instances. Pyre 38, a deposit consisting of two drinking cups (a Rheneia cup and a Corinthian skyphos), two lekanides, a rilled-rim plate, and fragments of a squat lekythos, was buried around 430–425 under the floor of the court of House D of the Industrial District.14 The date is anchored by the Rheneia cup, a shape that went out of use well before the end of the 5th century; Sparkes and Talcott compared the cup in pyre 38 to one dating ca. 430–425.15 Furthermore, differences between the Corinthian skyphos in pyre 38 and that found in the next-earliest certain pyre (pyre 6) document a gap in time between the deposit of the two.16 Like later pyres, pyre 38 lay in a pit with a fire-hardened floor, contained both pottery and Figure 7. gloss patterns on ribbon-handled plates P 20064, P 28559, and P 2007, from pyres 32, 1, and 30, respectively.

Furthermore, Snyder reports that the bone is consistent with that of later pyres. Although none of the forms unique to pyres occur among its contents, shapes that it does in-clude—Corinthian skyphos, rilled-rim plate, squat lekythos, and Lykinic lekanis—are well documented in Agora pyres, and a single fragment of a pyre saucer was found in the floor directly above the pyre and may belong to it. It is likely, therefore, that pyre 38 reflects the same ritual activity as the later pyres, but was deposited before the characteristic pyre vessel forms had been developed.A second early pyre, approximately contemporary with 38, was discovered under the floor of the second phase of Building Z at the Kerameikos.17 Two drinking cups, two small bowls, and a lopadion lay in a pit with burning in a possible courtyard of the building. The drinking cups (here too a Rheneia cup and a Corinthian skyphos) closely parallel those in pyre 38 and pinpoint the date around 425. Less closely datable, but within the last quarter of the 5th century, is another deposit at the Agora: three drinking cups, a lamp, and a chytridion found in House B, southwest of the public square (pyre[?] 48). The chytridion suggests a connection with the pyre phenomenon, but no traces of burning or bone were reported, so identification as a pyre must remain tentative. In any event, present evidence indicates that the pyre ritual may have been initi-ated as early as ca. 425, but was performed only intermittently during the subsequent quarter century.18The canonical pyre assemblage emerged around 400, and thereafter pyres were dedicated with regularity. Eight Agora pyres can be dated with confidence in the first quarter of the 4th century,19 and, as Figure 8 and Table 4 show, the custom maintained its popularity throughout the 4th cen- tury and into the first half of the 3rd. It then declined dramatically; only three or four pyres can be dated in the second half of the 3rd century (2, 17. Kerameikos XVII, pp. 43, 161, nos. 399–403, pl. 94; see Appendix II, no. 1.18.

The latest pyre found at the Agora was buried in Greek Building Δ around 175 (3). Figure 9 combines this data with that of the published settlement pyres found elsewhere in the city. It tells a similar story, with a peak in the second half of the 4th century reflecting the many pyres in Building Z at the Kerameikos. Differences at the end of the span are discussed below.Some developments can be observed within this span. Pyre 38 (see Fig. 79) suggests a formative stage, with participants using small versions of common household shapes rather than vessels specifically designed and produced for the rite. By the early 4th century, however, a specialized “pyre service” had been devised; saucers, ribbon-handled plates, chytridia, and pyre lekanides were being offered (pyres 6, 53; see Figs. 29, 101), to be joined only slightly later by the lopadion (pyres 39, 42; see Figs. 80, 84). Although the individual forms of this votive pottery evolved to some de-gree, the assemblage remained remarkably stable over more than 100 years. There was a slight change in the last quarter of the 4th century, when large saucers became much more common and the chytridion and lopadion began to be made in household rather than cooking fabric, but the same types and numbers of vessels continued to be dedicated. A major shift occurred, however, in the second quarter of the 3rd century, with the disappearance of the original pyre assemblage and its replacement by a smaller group of less distinctive vessels. The latest large pyres with conventional pyre vessels (pyres 9, 19, 30, 37; see Figs. 34, 48, 66, 76) are about contemporaneous, dated no earlier than ca. 275 by lamps of type 29A (in pyres 19, 30) and Classical kantharoi similar to those found at Koroni (in pyres 9, 19, 37).20 One (pyre 37) contains two small Hellenistic angular kantharoi dating no earlier than ca. 275. That these pyres were dedicated not far into the second quarter of the century is indicated by the presence in two of them (9, 37) of type 25D ́ lamps, a form that went out of production around 270. Thus it is possible to pinpoint the abandonment of the classic pyre assemblage closely, around or not long after the year 270.The new assemblage that replaced it was smaller and limited to three shapes: a lamp, a rilled-rim plate, and a small cup (most commonly a kantharos), usually in single examples but sometimes in pairs. It is first 20.

With the exception of a single fragmentary saucer in pyre 5, these late pyres include none of the distinctive pyre shapes. The latest pyre at the Agora (pyre 3; see Fig. 21), buried around 175, points toward further change, with the addition of a miniature two-handled bowl and several unguentaria, a form that had ap-peared only twice before, in single examples in the latest canonical pyres (19, 37).Published pyres at the Kerameikos suggest a similar history for the graveside deposits (Fig. 10). A possible predecessor to the canonical de-posits, furnished with ribbon-handled plates, lekanides, and drinking cups but lacking the distinctive pyre vessels, dates around 430,21 and the pyre assemblage emerges in the early years of the 4th century.22 Subsequently many pyres were dedicated in cemetery precincts, though the numbers of published examples show a steady decline from the first half of the 4th cen- tury to the first half of the 3rd. The latest pyre with the conventional as-semblage, a remarkably large deposit in the precinct of the Messenians in the Eckterrasse, was offered in the first quarter of the 3rd century, perhaps to mark the termination of the use of the precinct.23 The single later in-stance, buried in the Eridanos cemetery in the 260s, is small and, like the late Agora pyres, lacks distinctive pyre shapes.24The abandonment of the pyre assemblage of earlier times poses a problem for the recognition of later pyres, which might easily be mistaken for ordinary household debris. No candidates dating after ca. 175 have been identified at the Agora, but two later deposits unearthed in excavations for the Acropolis Metro station document the further survival of the pyre ritual.

The published description accords well with the pyre profile: the walls of the pit in which it lay were burnt, and the deposit was accompanied by ash and carbon and included animal bone (sheep or goat), though that bone was only superficially burnt. The later pyre, buried no earlier than the end of the 2nd century, is small, like the late Agora pyres, containing only a cup (a long-petal moldmade bowl), two lamps, and a table lekythos, though disturbance may have removed some of its original contents.27 It is rumored that more, and even later, pyres have been unearthed in the adjacent excavations for the new Acropolis Museum; until they are pub-lished, however, little can be said about the further continuation of the pyre custom, if that is what they document. Similarly, the incomplete publication of much later Roman deposits at the Kerameikos characterized as burnt offerings precludes further comment.28Whatever the case with the later history of the pyre ritual, the Metro station discoveries clearly indicate its survival at least to the end of the 2nd century, and prompt us to ask why no later pyres have been found at the Agora. Later disturbance provides a partial answer. Roman builders destroyed much of the Hellenistic stratigraphy throughout the Agora area, so later traces were often swept away.29 In the “Strategeion,” for example, little survives above the level of the building fill. The Hellenistic floors of the Poros Building and the Classical Commercial Building were present only in scraps; none dating after the mid-3rd century survive in the latter build-ing, except in its southernmost room. Most of House G in the Industrial District was destroyed by Roman construction, and Roman overbuilding likewise spared little of the Classical houses in section Ω. The filling of cisterns and wells in section Ω may signal their destruction in the early 2nd century,30 but little else is preserved of the post-Classical phases here.Another factor is the apparent depopulation of some of the neighbor-hoods around the public square. Houses B–D in the Industrial District and the House of Simon to the northeast had been abandoned by the end of the 3rd century, and the construction of the Middle Stoa around 26. The dating is problematic. One of the moldmade bowls can be assigned to workshop A, which probably ceased to function not long after 175 (Agora XXII, p. 28); the unguentaria are of Agora category 5, distinguished by a groove near the base of the stem, a form that was produced from ca. 180 to 100 (Agora XXXIII, p. 154); and one of the lamps approximates Howland type 33A, datable between ca. 220 and 150 (see Agora XXIX, p. 501, for the date). An imported gray-ware lamp, however, seems to be later; Eleftheratou points to a close parallel from a grave of the second half of the 2nd century (Phili-monos-Tsopotou 1980, p. 83, no. 6, pl. 25:β; color photograph in Phili-monos-Tsopotou 1994, p. 135, fig. 7). It is surprising to find vessels of such different dates together in a pyre, and one wonders if the lamp is intrusive. Whatever the date, however, the pyre is certainly later than the latest pyre found at the Agora (3), where most of the unguentaria are of an earlier variety.27.

South of the square, the house in section Φ was abandoned in the middle of the 3rd century. The small neighbor-hood of bronzeworkers and other artisans on the north side of the Kolonos Agoraios lay in ruins by the second quarter of the 2nd century. North of the public square, Greek Building Δ was abandoned in the first half of the 2nd century (see Table 6). It was rebuilt soon thereafter, but none of the surviving later floors preserves evidence for pyres there. A combination of reduced population around the square and extensive Roman disturbance may thus be sufficient to account for the absence of later pyres at the Agora. It is also possible, however, that the custom went into decline and was not practiced as commonly in the later part of the Hellenistic period as it had been in earlier years."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"chapter 4toward a new InterpretationThe stratigraphy and contents of the pyres enable us to sketch out the rite that led to their deposit during the heyday of the pyre custom. Any such outline, of course, must contain more than a few grains of fantasy, but it can present at least one set of actions that could have left behind deposits such as the ones I have described in the preceding chapters. Considerable planning must have gone into the occasion. Savings had been dipped into for the purchase of a suitable sacrificial animal, worth a week or two’s wages, and for the material gifts, most of which had been acquired new for the oc-casion. Last-minute additions—a lamp, perhaps, or a drinking cup—might be snatched hurriedly from the household cupboards. Other necessary equipment had also to be supplied: at the very least, a knife, but presum-ably other sacrificial equipment and supplies as well: a bowl for washing the hands, barley to sprinkle on the victim, and fuel for the fire, garnered from prunings or gathered on the Attic hillsides. Add to the list wine for libations, and olives, nuts, and dried(?) fruits for the meal or as additional offerings. On the day of the ceremony, the participants, probably a small group, gathered at or in a private building, where a fire of olive branches and twigs had been laid and lit, either on the ground or within a shallow pit. Libations were poured from the unused cups, occasionally augmented with offerings of oil, and sometimes a lamp was lit briefly.The main event, however, was the sacrifice, which presumably fol-lowed the standard sequence:1 a prayer stating the request, casting of salt and barley over the victim, the symbolic snipping of a few hairs from the animal’s brow, and finally the slitting of its throat, with the blood directed to flow into the pit or the fire burning on the ground. The animal was then skinned and cut up, and selected parts were offered to the divinities or spirits in question by placing them on the fire, perhaps with bloodless offerings as well. Perhaps a meal followed; its remains, if not deliberately buried, would not be distinguishable from ordinary household debris in the archaeological record. The repast may, however, have been enjoyed only by the spirits below.2 In any event, the fire had burnt down to embers by the time the ritual vessels were placed on it, occasionally with other objects, such as coins and small pellets of clay, perhaps wrapped in a cloth that may have served some purpose in the proceedings—a tablecloth, perhaps, for 1. For a summary of the standard sequence, see Bremmer 2007, pp. 133–138.2. Compare the ritual puppy dinners of 6th-century Sardis, which, like the saucer pyres, were buried in pits in functioning residential and commercial neighborhoods. There too it is uncer-tain whether the feast was delivered exclusively to the deity or was shared by humans (Greenewalt 1978, esp. pp. 26, 31–39)."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"chapter 456the vessels laid out for the divine meal. If the pyre had been burnt on the ground or in a pit, it was then covered in place, either by patching over the pit, laying a new floor surface, or raising the floor level over and around the pyre. If it had been burnt elsewhere, the remnants were collected and buried in the same way.Having established the outlines of what the participants did, it remains for us to explore their identities and motives. Who were these shadowy figures placing their offerings on the dying fire, and what did they hope to accomplish through their actions?Pyres as buILDIng DePosItsSnyder’s identification of the bones from the pyres as animal rather than human, and as animals of the species most favored for sacrifice, has defini-tively laid the hypothesis of baby cremations to rest. Of the theories that have arisen to replace it, the most fully explored is the contention that the pyres represent Bauopfer, deposits connected with the construction of the building in which they were found. Several recent studies have focused attention on deposits of this type, demonstrating without a doubt that special offerings sometimes attended the construction of both public and private buildings in the Greek world.3 The practice can be traced back to the Bronze Age, though it may have been reintroduced into Archaic Greece from the East, where it is best documented. One perhaps thinks most readily of official ceremonies analogous to our modern laying of the cornerstone, but excavation has revealed a considerable range of activities that may fall under the rubric of Bauopfer, or foundation ritual. As Weikart defines the term Bauopfer, it embraces all archaeological finds that can be related to a ritual activity directly connected with construction of a building,4 and it is in this sense that I will use the term “building deposit.”Both Weikart and Müller-Zeis include the Agora saucer pyres in their catalogues of building deposits. Müller-Zeis places them within her category of Baubegleitende Opfer, private offerings made at any point during construction, by workers or anyone else with an interest in the construction process.5 She is mostly concerned with demonstrating that the Agora pyres are not child burials, and offers no positive arguments for their identification as construction deposits. Weikart, however, provides a sensible list of criteria for the identification of a building deposit: it should be incorporated within the building, or at least located in its very near vicinity; the stratigraphy and the means of deposit must make it clear that it was put in place before or during the building activity; and the content and arrangement of the objects should not be of a sort that could be con-nected with some other ritual activity. He devotes a lengthy discussion to the saucer pyres, based on published examples from the Agora and the Kerameikos,6 and he identifies them as unambiguous building offerings for the following reasons: most are located inside buildings; they can, in his understanding of the evidence, often be connected with construction or reconstruction activities; and their contents identify them as the remains of offerings rather than chance discards.3. Müller-Zeis (1994), combining documentary testimonia and the evi-dence of excavation, develops a typol-ogy of building offerings, from the Geometric to the Hellenistic period. Weikart (2002) follows the custom from Minoan to Hellenistic times. A third study (Hunt 2006), focusing on post–Bronze Age Greece, examines foundation deposits of sacred buildings and their Near Eastern precedents.4. Weikart 2002, p. 13.5.

Andreou have also identified the Athenian saucer pyres as building deposits, comparing them to similar subfloor deposits that have repeatedly come to light in rescue excavations in Ambracia.7 These deposits lay in pits under the lowest floor of the houses, filled with burnt material and large numbers of miniature pots imitating a wide range of household vessels. There is normally only one deposit per house, though there is at least one instance of three deposits in a single dwelling. The position of these Ambracian deposits, sealed in by the earliest floors of the houses in which they occur, seems to confirm that the offerings were made in connection with the original construction of the house. Closely similar deposits have been found within houses on Leukada, though no details have been published,8 and domestic subfloor deposits are known from a handful of other sites as well (see Appendix IV ). This suggests that Greek householders did sometimes mark construction, or reconstruction, of their dwellings in this way, and we must ask whether the Athenian pyres bear witness to such activities.the Pyres of Building Z (Kerameikos)A good place to begin the inquiry is with Building Z in the Kerameikos, where subfloor deposits of what can only be a ritual character occur in all three phases of the building. By the reckoning of Knigge, who excavated and published the building, at least 21, but perhaps as many as 28 Opferstel-len (offering places) lie under its floors.9 She does not comment in detail, but unhesitatingly identifies them as Bauopfer. Direct connection with the construction process is once vividly indicated by the placement of objects in the packing for a threshold block.10 These Opferstellen vary considerably in content and mode of deposit, and it is not always possible to distinguish with certainty between deliberate offerings and casual discards. In what follows, I concentrate on the clearest examples, excluding those that the excavator herself queries, as well as a few others that seem to me unlikely as offerings.11 The remainder are distributed throughout the first three phases of the building: four are associated with its original construction around 430 (nos. 112, 114–116), three with a rebuilding about a decade later (nos. 275, 277, and the group nos. 399–403), and 13 were laid in the third phase of the building, in the second half of the 4th century (nos. 447– 450, 452–460).Of these, one offering associated with phase 2 (nos. 399–403) and seven of phase 3 (nos. 449, 450, 453–456, 460) have all the hallmarks of 7.

Knigge tags Kerameikos XVII, nos. 117–120, 276, and 451 as ques-tionable, and the stratigraphy makes it impossible to assign no. 447 to a phase with certainty. I also exclude Kerameikos XVII, no. 113 (a fragment of a cup-skyphos found in the packing below a threshold, 50 years old at the time of burial and possibly residual) and no. 446 (a horos inscription and a collection of broken transport-amphora handles that make for odd votives). But I would add a group of five ves- sels under the floor of phase 2, which Knigge hesitates to identify as an offer-ing (Kerameikos XVII, p. 161, nos. 399– 403, pl. 94)."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"chapter 458saucer pyres (see Appendix II, nos. 1–8). They contain the familiar suite of vessels, buried in shallow pits, and they are distinguished from other subfloor deposits in the building by several details. All show evidence of fire, a feature encountered less uniformly in the other Opferstellen,12 and two contained burnt bone, also rarely reported in non-saucer-pyre deposits.13 It seems, then, that the ceremony documented by the non-pyre Opferstel-len was different from the pyre ritual; it usually did not involve an animal offering and objects were often not placed on the fire, but simply buried. The objects offered are also different. Terracotta figurines, virtually never present in saucer pyres, play a large role in the other deposits. Most impres-sive is the collection of seven figurines buried together with 13 miniature skyphoi below the floor of room X of phase 2,14 but figurines also feature in offerings no. 112 of phase 1 and no. 277 of phase 2, and two figurine vases were buried in Opferstelle no. 448 of phase 3.15 Another recurring gift in these other offerings is the olpe, found in connection with both phases 1 and 3,16 but absent from saucer pyres.Buried offerings, then, are a regular feature of all three phases of Building Z, but it is only in phase 3 that clear instances of saucer pyres are numerous. With seven examples, this constitutes another pyre “hot spot,” comparable to the Classical Commercial Building north of the public square, in which 13 pyres have been discovered, and Houses C and D in the Industrial District, with 10 pyres. The short and apparently simple his-tory of the third phase of Building Z, however, makes it possible to relate the pyres to that history in a way that cannot be done elsewhere. Knigge associated all but one Opferstelle with the initial construction of this phase, when Building Z was re-erected over the ruins of its predecessor after a gap of more than half a century. According to her reading of the stratigraphy, six pyres were put in place before the original floor of this phase (floor 7) was laid; she associated the seventh pyre, lying between floors 7 and 5, with a raising of the floor level in the last quarter of the 4th century, perhaps in conjunction with minor architectural alterations.17 This scenario leads to difficulties, however, since not all of the six supposedly earlier pyres are contemporary, and Knigge is consequently hard put to pinpoint a date of construction.18 Close examination of the contents of the pyres suggests a more complicated sequence and weakens the case for the identification of all of these deposits as building offerings pure and simple.The saucer pyres of phase 3 of Building Z in fact fall into three chronological groups (Fig. 11). Closely similar Attic skyphoi show that pyre nos. 450 and 456 are closely contemporary, probably dating 12. Eight other (non-saucer-pyre) deposits show possible evidence of fire: no. 116 (patch of burning with frag-ments of a Rheneia cup) and perhaps no. 114 (underside of the phiale per-haps burnt), both associated with the first phase of the building; no. 275 (traces of burning on a single object) and no. 277 (single terracotta figurine deposited on a burnt clay layer) in the second phase; and nos. 447, 448, 451, and 457 in the third phase, all with ash or other clear evidence of burning.13.

The position of a third pyre (no. 453), however, is unambiguous: it was cut through the floor makeup of floor 7 and then sealed over by its surface.21 It must therefore date to the time of the laying of the original floor of phase 3, and it is surely significant that it appears to be considerably earlier than the two pyres discussed above.

Unfortunately, no. 456 does not appear on any of the published sections, floor 7 was recognized only in some parts of the court where no. 456 was located, and the elevations of the two floors are very close together here.21.

A second pyre (no. 454) may be as early, although its stratigraphic position is obscured by the fact that another pyre (no. 455) was buried directly above it. Its black-gloss kantharos finds its best comparanda around 350,24 and the profile of its lopadion is paralleled in Agora pyres of the second quarter of the 4th century.25 It is possible, then, that only no. 453, and perhaps no. 454, were buried at the time of the initial construction of phase 3, around or slightly before the middle of the 4th century, and that nos. 450 and 456 were added a generation later.Two or perhaps three pyres are later still and are probably to be associ-ated with a renewal of the floor (floor 5). No. 460 lay directly under this new floor;26 it signals its later date by the profile of the kantharos, comparable to late-4th-century examples,27 and the household fabric of the chytridia and lopadia (nos. 460.2–6), typical of pyres dating after ca. 315. Pyre no. 455 is also late. It had been buried directly atop no. 454, not immediately, as Knigge thought, but after some time. A date after ca. 315 is indicated again by household-ware chytridia and lopadia (nos. 455.4–11), and by the profile of the cup-kantharos (no. 455.1), comparable to a cup in Agora pyre 1, buried around 315. The profiled knob of the lekanis lid (no. 455.28) is unusual at such a late date, but I suspect it may be intrusive from the pyre that lay below (no. 454). There may even have been a swap, either in dig-ging or recording, as the lekanis from the lower pyre (no. 454.21) has the later form of lid, with a plain knob, closely comparable to the lekanis in pyre 460 (no. 460.20).28 The third pyre (no. 449) is more difficult to date, but the lid of its unusual two-handled lopadion (no. 449.2) resembles lids of household-ware lopadia rather than those of the earlier cooking-ware ones, and unglazed large saucers like the one in this pyre (no. 449.5) are rare before the end of the 4th century. Stratigraphically it could belong either before or after the laying of the second floor of this building phase.Close scrutiny therefore shows that the association of pyres and build-ing history is not as straightforward as it appears at first sight. One or two pyres were probably laid at the time of construction and warrant identifica-tion as Bauopfer; others were added during the lifetime of the phase, some in connection with the raising of a floor, but others on unknown occasions.Pyres at the agoraThe situation at the Agora is even less straightforward. The extreme distur-bance of the area has obscured the construction history of most of the private buildings there. Absent stratigraphic evidence that a pyre is associated with building activity, the coincidence in date of an approximately dated pyre with an approximately dated construction phase cannot be decisive. Neither is it conclusive that the date of a pyre does not correspond to a recognized period of construction; the evidence for the buildings is so lacunose that some phases of reconstruction may have gone undetected. What we can say is that, with one exception, none of the Agora pyres is associated with the original construction of any building, so they cannot be foundation de-posits in the strictest sense. The exception is pyre 6, in the corner of room 2 of the Classical Commercial Building. It rests on what was probably the 24. Kerameikos XVII, p. 172, no. 454.1, pl. 103. Cf.

Alone of the Agora pyres, then, it fits all the criteria for a deposit laid in the course of a ritual associated with the original construction of a building.29 All of the other pyres in the Classical Commercial Building date considerably later (see Fig. 22), and there is little evidence either for or against their association with architectural renovations. Pyre 5, however, lay directly below a stucco channel in room 1. It may commemorate the installation of that feature, and possibly a raising of the floor level that was part of the same project. Table 5 summarizes the relationships between Agora pyres and the histories of the associated buildings.Of all the structures at the Agora in which pyres have been found, Houses C and D in the Industrial District have the best-documented con-struction history, and it is here that we can best investigate the relationship between these deposits and episodes of construction or reconstruction (see Fig. 78; and for the construction phases of the houses, see Tables 9 and 10). No pyre accompanied the construction of these houses, which took place before the middle of the 5th century, at a time when, as far as we can determine, the pyre ritual did not yet exist. The earliest pyre (38, ca. 430–425) was buried in the course of the first phase of House D, though it was covered with a new floor surface, and thus associated with at least this degree of refurbishment. The approximate dates assigned to pyre 42 in House C (ca. 385–375) and pyre 39 in House D (ca. 390–375) make it possible that these two deposits inaugurated this second phase of both houses (dated early in the 4th century), though the stratigraphy cannot confirm that conjecture. In House C, although the estimated date of pyre 43 ca. 340–325) would allow it to be contemporary with a second remodeling (shortly after the middle of the 4th century), the stratigraphy precludes any connection, since the pyre, which clearly was found in its original place of deposit, lay higher than the floor associated with the remodeling. Things become even more uncertain in the latest phase of the house. Pyre 44 (ca. 315) in room 6 was dug into a layer that covers some of the house walls (see Fig. 88), and consequently Young dated it after the abandonment of the house. This conclusion, however, is called into question by a thin clay layer that ran over it, identified by Young as a deliberate house floor and therefore indicating continued occupation, at least in this part of the house. The pyre might, then, be associated with an episode of remodeling. There was no reflooring, however, over the approximately contemporary pyre 45 (if it is in fact a pyre), in the court of the house, so most likely it was buried after abandonment of this part of the house. Reflooring is also absent above pyre 46 (ca. 285–275), though Young reported that the surface above it showed indications of continued use. The latest pyre (47, ca. 250) is located in (or perhaps just outside) room 12, a space opening onto the Street of the Marble Workers to the west, and apparently in use as a shop until the first part of the 2nd century. Next door, in House D, there is no evidence to connect pyre 40 (ca. 375–360) with construction activities; chronologically it falls in the course of the house’s second phase. Pyre 41 (ca. 315–300) was dug into a fill that runs over house walls and 29. Pyre 21 in House 3 on the northern side of the Kolonos Agoraios presents a possible second instance of a pyre associated with original construc-tion. Unfortunately, the history of this extremely ruinous building cannot be reconstructed with any confidence, and it is not possible to be certain that the pyre was sealed by the original floor.

To summarize: of the 10 pyres in Houses C and D, only three can plausibly be connected with episodes of major renovation: pyres 39 and 42, perhaps inaugurating the second phase of both houses (though this requires some adjustment to the beginning of that phase); and pyre 44, possibly marking a late re-modeling of House C.Elsewhere at the Agora, a number of pyres are approximately contem-porary with documented episodes of remodeling of the structure where they are located and thus are candidates for building deposits. Pyre 25, which lay just outside Building E southwest of the Agora (see Fig. 57), dates close to the proposed date of the reconstruction of the building in the early 4th century. Since it was outside the building and apparently behind it, however, it may instead relate to structures to the south that no longer exist. South of the public square, the third phase of a house in section Φ was inaugu-rated by a reconstruction in the first half of the 4th century (see Fig. 105, Table 12). Two of the pyres found there (56 and 57) date within these rather broad limits, although pyre 57 was not found in situ, having been redeposited in an abandoned pithos later in the 4th century.

Pyre 60, dug into a bedrock floor of the central house, is roughly contemporary with a reconstruction in the second half of the 4th century. The conjunction of the dates of reconstruction and pyre is closer in the case of pyre 62, buried in the easternmost house around 300–290, a date that coincides very closely with a reconstruction that probably took place around 300 (see Table 13). More concrete is the association of pyre 32 with the reconstruction of the Poros Building (see Figs. 67, 70, Table 8). The deposit lay directly below the lowest floor associated with the northern wall of the northwest room, constructed as part of the mid-4th-century renovation of the building. Finally, pyre 22 lay directly below a pebble mosaic floor on the southern slopes of the Kolonos Agoraios. Although nothing is preserved of the house to which this floor belonged, it is possible that the pyre was offered immediately before the floor was installed, a procedure that is likely to have been accompanied by other renovations.Several pyres can be associated with the renewal of a clay floor (e.g., 1, 2, 9, 21, 38, and perhaps 8, 11, 13). Such refloorings might have been initiated in response to a variety of events, such as the arrival of new ten-ants, redecoration associated with minor damage, wear and tear, change in the street level outside a room, or some more dramatic event that had taken place in the room. There is no evidence that the renewals coincided with architectural modifications, though it is a fact that repeated reflooring must eventually be combined with reroofing to avoid an excessively low ceiling. The evidence for the connection of the Agora pyres with significant episodes of reconstruction is therefore limited; some pyres seem to have coincided with such events, but it is difficult in most cases to demonstrate it with certainty. Stratigraphical and chronological evidence furthermore indicates that, far from marking the construction of a building, some Agora pyres postdate its abandonment. The investigation of this question is com-plicated by the fact that pyres have sometimes been taken as evidence—often the sole evidence—for the abandonment of a building, based on the axiom, expressed by Young in 1951, that “it would seem beyond the realm of possibility that such pyres could have been burned within the houses while they were still standing roofed.” 30 Consequently, it is sometimes difficult to disentangle the history of the structure from that of the pyres. The matter is worth pursuing, however, especially in light of the suggestion that some graveside pyres may have commemorated the abandonment of the grave precincts in which they were located (see pp. 73–74, below).Before we can pursue this question, an examination of Young’s axiom is in order. As discussed above (pp. 14–15), most pyres either were burnt somewhere other than their place of deposit, or were burnt in situ with a fire that was not strong enough to have left any trace on the earth on which they rested, and therefore did not threaten the structure or seriously inconvenience its occupants. In some cases, however, earth hardened and/or reddened by fire or the location of charcoal below the artifacts indicates that the pyre was burnt in situ.31 One of these (6) was laid during construction, while others were located in courtyards (in Houses D and G) or other un-roofed areas (35, 36, 38, 40, 52), or unquestionably postdate abandonment 30. Young 1951b, p. 113. Young (1951a, p. 225) relied almost solely on the pyres in Houses B–D for the date of their abandonment; Crosby (1951, p. 181) regarded the existence of pyre 32 an obstacle to the survival of the Poros Building beyond the mid-4th century; and Shear (1973a, p. 141) took the three pyres in Greek Building Δ as possible indicators of abandonment.31.

Yet others were located in structures that are so poorly preserved that their histories cannot be reconstructed with confidence or in buildings that have disappeared altogether (19, 22, 49, 50). There remain only four candidates for burning in situ within an intact building, and they invite closer scrutiny.Pyre 16, described as “set into a fill with charcoal and burnt bone” and thus likely to have been burnt in situ, was located in one of the northernmost spaces (room 6[?]) of the Classical Commercial Building (see Fig. 22). This part of the building is poorly preserved, and it is not certain that it belongs to the same structure as the more southerly rooms. A chunk of iron slag perhaps from the bottom of a hearth was found nearby,32 indicating metalworking, so it may be that the space was unroofed or vented. In any event, excavation photographs do not show evidence of heavy burning, which, along with the absence of reddening on the pyre floor, indicates that the fire was not a large or strong one. Pyre 47, in room 12 of House C (see Fig. 78), assumed to have been burnt in situ on the evidence of its fire-hardened floor, may have lain outside the boundaries of the room as it operated late in the history of the house, and here again the small size of the pit and its deposit—with only three items—suggests that this was not a major conflagration.Pyre 39 in the southeastern room of House D, presents greater dif-ficulties (see Fig. 78). Here, again, reddened earth confirms burning in situ, in a pit 0.45 m in diameter, and the fire was probably considerable, to judge from the notebook account, where Young underscored the words “a great deal of burning.”33 He dated this pyre at the end of the third quarter of the 4th century,34 which allowed him, just barely, to place it after the abandonment of the house, which he dated in the third quarter or second half of the 4th century.35 Reexamination of the pottery has indicated a substantially earlier date for pyre 39, however, in the first quarter of the 4th century, while the house was still certainly in use. Either this part of the roof had been temporarily removed in an otherwise undocumented renova-tion, or the pyre was burnt within a roofed room. A pyre in the southern corner room of House C (43) presents a similar situation. Here the pit was larger (0.65 x 0.75 m) and, along with the usual reddening of the earth, included pieces of firewood up to 0.10 m in diameter, all indications of a substantial blaze. Young dated the pyre near the end of the 4th century,36 and thus could easily place it after the abandonment of the house. Here too, however, the pottery is now dated earlier, in the third quarter of the 4th century. To place this pyre after the abandonment of the house would call for a surprisingly (though not impossibly) short duration for the third phase of the house, which was initiated after the middle of the 4th century.Indoor fires were a commonplace in antiquity. Permanent hearths were rare in Athens but are occasionally attested in both public and private 32. The hemispherical piece of iron slag is similar to others found in the general area (IL 2003, IL 2007).33. Notebook ΝΝ XXXVII, p. 7310.34. Young 1951b, p. 117.35.

Pyre 24 lay on the final floor of the House of Simon (see Fig. 55), along with workshop debris associated with its last days. Although it cannot be dated precisely, it probably falls close to the final years of the house’s occupation, and may have been buried at the time of its abandonment. Deposit 45 (see Fig. 78) in House C (not certainly a saucer pyre) lay under a red fill that was itself covered by disintegrated mud brick; it must have been placed there in the interval between the abandonment of the house and the collapse of its walls. Similarly, pyre 3 was covered by a layer of collapsed mud brick signaling the collapse of Greek Building Δ (see Fig. 15). In other instances, however, burial took place long enough after abandonment that one or two strata of earth had accumulated over the foundations of house walls. Examples include pyre 41 in House D, dug into the layers that ran over the foundations of the room where it was buried; pyre 46, within a layer that ran over the foundations of House C, and covered by disintegrated mud brick; and pyre 30, which lay on the surface of a stratum that covered the walls of room A of Early Building II (see Fig. 65). In these cases, although the pyres may have been placed in the shells of abandoned buildings, the ceremony is unlikely to have com-memorated the act of abandonment, which was some distance in the past when they were buried. It thus takes on another complexion altogether, as a rite performed in what may be thought of as waste space. The precise history of three more instances is even more difficult to resurrect, though the possibility of association with abandonment exists. Pyre 35 was dug through the marble chip layer that marked the final phase of House G (see Fig. 67). Interpretation is complicated, however, by the nearby and slightly later pyre 36, overlaid by a trodden surface bespeaking continued activity in the area. It may be that the structures had been abandoned as dwellings but continued to be used by artisans or squatters; the buildings may have been ruinous but not deserted. Finally, pyre 58 is about contemporary with the abandonment of the house in section Φ (see Fig. 105), though the stratigraphic situation there is unclear.These examples are enough to demonstrate that not all saucer pyres can be explained in terms of construction or reconstruction. The building-deposit hypothesis also leaves some features of the pyres unexplained: the chthonic nature of the deposits, which emerges clearly from their contents; the distribution of the pyres, which, as we shall see, favors buildings associ-ated with industrial or commercial activity; and the large numbers of pyres concentrated in single buildings and even in single rooms. Thus, although the pyre ritual was sometimes performed at the time a building was constructed or abandoned, it clearly had other applications as well, and this prompts further exploration into the motives of those who dedicated these offerings.37. E.g., a small hearth in room X of South Stoa I, with ash and charcoal on the floors of some of the other rooms (“as if from braziers,” Agora XIV, p. 77); and an unusual rectangular built hearth in one of the eastern rooms of the western house in section Ω (see Fig. 109; Shear 1973a, p. 147).38. Edward Dodwell’s account of a visit to a smoky house in the village of Kastri in the early 19th century illus-trates the point: “The cold was extremely piercing, and the house which we occupied had neither chim-ney nor glass to the windows; the smoke was so painful to our eyes, that in spite of the inclemency of the weather, we were obliged to keep the shutters open; but the people of the house were so inured to this nuisance, that they beheld our fastidiousness with a contemptuous smile” (Dodwell 1819, p. 169). I am grateful to John Camp for bringing this passage to my attention."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"toward a new interpretation67the ChthonIC nature oF sauCer PyresIt was Young’s perception of the chthonic nature of saucer pyres that led him to identify them as baby burials (see pp. 5–6, above). Although that conclusion has now been abandoned, this chthonic—or, perhaps more precisely, funereal—character has emerged even more clearly from discov-eries and research carried out since Young wrote. The publication of the Eridanos and Eckterrasse cemeteries at the Kerameikos, in particular, has made available a rich body of material for comparison with the saucer pyres. Such comparison confirms and abundantly illustrates Young’s contention that, in the Classical period, ribbon-handled plates occur in only in graves, graveside pyres, and saucer pyres. They also, as noted above (pp. 26–27), have an association with funerary ritual that reaches back to the Geometric period. Likewise, stone alabastra, handleless lekanides, chytridia, lopadia, and pyre saucers are found in pyres (both in the city and the cemetery) and graves, but rarely or never elsewhere. The chytra, in particular, has a strong association with chthonic and funerary ritual. The third day of the Anthesteria was named Chytroi,39 and the associated rites involved boiling a collection of seeds in a chytra and sacrificing to Hermes Chthonios on behalf of the dead.40 Women called ἐγχυτρίστριαι performed ceremonies of an unknown sort at early Athenian funerals.41 The chytra was also sometimes used in what appear to have been magical rituals, as in the case of a full-size chytra inscribed with a long list of names and containing the partial remains of a chicken.42The left-sidedness of the animal bone may also point to a chthonic recipient, although, as mentioned above (p. 42), this may have as much to do with sacrificial conventions as with the character of the sacrifice. It is also surely significant that some of the sacrifices were burnt within a pit, rather than on an altar.43 Literary evidence, beginning with Odysseus’s famous sacrifice in the first Nekyia (Hom. Od. 10.517–542, 11.23–50), suggests that rituals in and around pits are exclusively aimed at contact with inhabitants of the underworld, whether the deceased or chthonic divinities.44 A recent review of the sources concludes that such bothroi were usually small and shallow, dug for the purposes of a single rite—like the pits of the pyres—and were aimed at propitiation of underworld forces and the aversion of an imminent danger.45 With the pyres, however, we are dealing with what appears to be a mixed rite, for the victim was not entirely destroyed, as was the usual procedure in sacrifices to underworld 39. Perhaps after the vessel, but see n. 41, below.40. Theopompos, FGrH 115 F 347; Parke 1977, pp. 116–117; Burkert 1983, pp. 238–243; Parker 2005a, 295–297.41. Garland (1985, p. 144) summa-rizes conjectures as to what these women did.

Another, buried in the wall of the House of Menon and Mikion (Miller 1974, p. 210, n. 80, pl. 35), contained the bones of a canid, possibly a purificatory sacrifice.

Ekroth 2002, pp. 69, 72."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"chapter 468entities,46 and the one most frequently (though not exclusively) attested in association with bothroi.47The Kerameikos publications have also made clearer the prominent role of graveside offerings, termed Opferstellen (offering places), in 4th-century funerary ritual (see Appendix III and Fig. 126). The Eridanos and Eckterrasse cemeteries, for example, preserve close to 50 of these, about half of which contain the characteristic pyre assemblage—miniature saucers, lekanides, chytridia, and lopadia, joined by drinking cups and ribbon-handled and rilled-rim plates—usually resting on a bed of ashes and cinders mixed with animal bone. Only rarely can they be associated with a specific burial, but their location within walled grave precincts and in close proximity to burials ensures that they formed a part of a ritual or rituals associated with the dead. Weikart dismisses the similarities between these graveside deposits and settlement pyres as insignificant, arguing that the same assemblage of offerings could serve different purposes in different contexts.48 This is certainly true, but it ignores the fact that not only was the pyre assemblage used in rituals directly associated with death, it also contains many vessel types that are otherwise associated only with death. It is, in short, a strongly marked mortuary assemblage, and I doubt that it lost that character entirely when removed from the graveyard.In Mesopotamia, where texts inform us about some of the details of building deposits, foundation rites could have a chthonic dimension, ex-plained by the fact that building involves digging, and digging encroaches on the territory of the gods of the underworld, whose wrath needed to be turned aside with gifts.49 I know of no evidence that this concept was shared by the Greeks; but even if it was, the Agora pyres, if they are associated with construction at all, are mostly related to rebuilding or to minor revisions such as new flooring, which did not require excavation and hence were unlikely to provoke the irritation of the spirits below. We may also note that the building deposits at Ambracia, which provide the closest parallel to the saucer pyres, lack any chthonic element. Although the same minia-tures are found in shrines and on the altars and hearths of public buildings there, they do not appear among grave gifts in the cemeteries of the city.50 The clear chthonic character of the Athenian saucer pyres suggests that we should seek further for an explanation of the ritual, and furthermore that we conduct part of that search in the cemeteries of the city.Precedents at the KerameikosThe close similarity between the saucer pyres of the Agora and elsewhere within the city and the Opferstellen of the Kerameikos cemeteries indicates a relationship of some sort between the two phenomena and the rituals that produced them. Unlike the pyres in the city, however, which seem to appear suddenly and without precedent, the graveside pyres have a long history. At the Kerameikos, that history can be traced back to the last quarter of the 8th century, when the practice of burning offerings at graveside in trenches (Opferrinnen) arose.51 These were long, narrow ditches, lined with mud brick and usually fitted with a mudbrick slab at the center that, with posts, supported a tablelike structure for the display 46. For chthonic ritual, often indi-cated by the verb ἐναγίζειν, see Guthrie 1950, pp. 221–222; Parker 1983, pp. 328–329; Burkert 1985, pp. 199–203. More recent scholarship, however, has tended to erode the simple binary distinction between Olympian and chthonic (e.g., Schlesier 1991–1992; Ekroth 2002, pp. 310–313, with pp. 74–128, on the wide varieties of application of ἐναγίζειν and its cog-nates; Henrichs 2005; Parker 2005b), or to define it in new terms (Scullion 1994). The sacred law from Selinous, for instance, describes a mixed proce-dure in which one sacrifices “as to the immortals,” but allows the blood of the victim to flow into the earth ( Jameson, Jordan, and Kotansky 1993, pp. 16–17, col. B, lines 12–13, with comments on pp. 45, 63–66).47. Ekroth 2002, pp. 67–69.48. Weikart 2002, p. 100.49. Hunt 2006, p. 190, citing Ambos 2004, pp. 70–71.50. Andreou and Andreou 2000, pp. 306–308.51.

The gifts included an impressive assemblage of pottery made for the occasion, small animals and shells, and no doubt other objects that were completely destroyed in the ritual. Beds of small branches provided the fuel for the incineration of the offerings, which collapsed in place in the shallow trenches, usually less than 0.15 m deep—just deep enough to accommodate the burnt offerings while ensuring ventilation. The debris of the conflagration was covered with a layer of earth and then a layer of white plaster and thereafter left undisturbed. Close analysis of the stratigraphy of the ditches and the graves, mounds, and monuments associated with them indicates that the ritual took place at the same time as the funeral; in the case of cremation burials, it is suggested that the deceased and the offering ditch were burnt simultaneously.Unlined offering pits (Opfergruben) may attest to the same ceremony, carried out on a less lavish scale, but a second type of ceremony is docu-mented by another group of offering places (Opferplätze), areas of burning that are usually not within a pit but on the surface of the layer that covered the grave.52 Sometimes multiple burnt strata alternate with layers of earth, indicating that, unlike the offering ditches, these offering sites were used more than once. Although they, too, contain pottery and animal bones, their stratigraphic position—on the surface of the stratum that covered the grave or the mound—indicates that they reflect postfuneral offerings, and sometimes repeated ones.The most lavish of the above installations, the offering ditches, are largely limited in time and space. Most have been unearthed in the Ayia Triada cemetery, just west of the Tritopatreion, though a few have been discovered elsewhere at the Kerameikos and in the Attic countryside.53 The earliest examples date to the last quarter of the 8th century; the practice then escalated, becoming common (at least in the Ayia Triada cemetery) in the 7th and early 6th century. Thereafter, offering ditches were very rare, though the custom never quite died out, and a few instances dating to the 6th, 5th, and early 4th century have been excavated.54 During these centuries Opferplätze are more common, usually consisting of concentra-tions of burnt material either on the surface or in shallow pits. Even these are infrequent, however, and it is often impossible to associate them with a specific grave or to determine whether the ceremonies to which they bear witness were performed at the funeral or at a later time.55Near the end of the 5th century and escalating markedly in the 4th, the custom of graveside burnt offerings was revived.56 These deposits, now 52.

The variety observed at the Kerameikos may reflect a multiplicity of rituals, carried out at different times for different purposes; I assume that those who conducted the ceremonies had reasons for choosing specific offerings, leaving behind nothing but alabastra, or burnt organic material, or plates in some cases, but a full pyre assemblage in others. In what follows, therefore, I concentrate on those Opferstellen that contain the assemblage now familiar from the saucer pyres. These pyrelike Opferstellen share several features with the offering ditches, pits, and places of earlier times: proximity to the grave, burial in shallow pits, the presence of animal bone, vessels specially produced for the occasion, and vessels clearly as-sociated with dining. They also share—in profoundly altered form—some of the vessel types that occur in the 7th-century offerings (covered bowls, ribbon-handled plates, skyphoi),58 and they display the same tendency for vessels to occur in pairs.59 These features combine to support the conten-tion that the later offerings represent the resurgence of an earlier custom rather than a complete innovation. It cannot be coincidental that pyrelike Opferstellen arose in the cemetery at about the same time that saucer pyres appeared within the city, and the examination of the Kerameikos deposits thus has a direct bearing on the exploration of the Agora pyres.graveside and settlement PyresThe long ancestry of offering places at the Kerameikos suggests that, although pyres appeared at the Kerameikos and at the Agora at about the same time, the custom began in the cemetery. Precedents excavated there support this contention. A graveside offering of about 440 in the Eridanos cemetery consists of a ribbon-handled plate and a squat lekythos, two shapes that later appear in pyres at the Agora.60 Within the next 20 years, two other relevant offerings were laid down. One, deposited around 430 in a triangular pit to the west of the Rundbau, included 12 pots, among them two ribbon-handled plates, two or three drinking cups, and two Lykinic lekanides, along with pieces of bronze and iron weaponry suggesting that it commemorated the burial of a warrior.61 The other, containing at least 27 objects and probably associated with the burial of a young woman, 57.

Like pyre 38 at the Agora, these deposits predate the formulation of the pyre assemblage, but seem to point forward toward it. Smaller deposits, more like the later pyres in their content, date in the last two decades of the 5th century, probably slightly earlier than the earliest unequivocal Agora pyres of ca. 400–390.63 The dates, of course, are only estimates, but if the Kera-meikos pyres do take chronological precedence, this is another indication that the deposits laid down within the city were modeled on those already being offered in the cemetery.A close comparison of the contents of the two sets of deposits further supports such a relationship between the two. The cemetery pyres are more diverse in their contents, and the objects they contain sometimes more costly. Alabastra (found in four graveside pyres) are functional and prob-ably imported vessels made of alabaster, rather than the locally produced solid poros dummies of the Agora pyres.64 In addition, while no settlement pyre contains more than a single alabastron, multiples are common in the graveside deposits. The ribbon-handled plates in the cemetery pyres are often larger, and sometimes more lavishly decorated, than anything in the Agora pyres.65 Standard black-gloss vessels also occur more frequently at graveside than in the settlement: rolled-rim plates are more common, and small black-gloss bowls or saltcellars accompany or replace pyre saucers in about half of the graveside pyres. Diversity emerges in the occasional dedication of shapes absent from the Agora pyres: the hydria, oinochoe, basket-handled jug, and aryballos.66 Preliminary studies also suggest a wider range of animal offerings in the Kerameikos pyres, including pigs and birds.67 Although some graveside pyres are as unpretentious as any found at the Agora, the overall impression is of a slightly more lavish as-semblage of offerings.Once established in the city, the custom of offering such pyres grew in popularity there and subsequently outlasted the cemetery offerings upon which it was based (Fig. 12). After a peak in the first half of the 4th century, cemetery pyres show a steady decline, disappearing altogether by about 250. 62.

This continued vigor of the custom is also attested by pyres excavated elsewhere within the city walls, most of which date after ca. 350 (Fig. 9).the Purpose of the graveside PyresThe coincidence between these two sets of offerings in both typology and date encourages speculation that they could have shared a purpose or func-tion as well. We know, for example, that ceremonies both in the cemetery and in the home accompanied a burial.68 Might the saucer pyres in the city document one of these rituals, mirroring a parallel ceremony carried out in the cemetery, as Sparkes and Talcott suggest?69 Before we try to answer that question, we need to explore the purpose of the graveside pyres. Here we are in difficult territory, for, while the archaeology of the Kerameikos Opferstellen has been described in meticulous detail, little attention has been paid to the reasons that lay behind these deposits. It may be that they functioned much as their predecessors did; but although those have aroused much more interest, no consensus has been reached as to their purpose or purposes.70 Karl Kübler, for instance, saw the Opferrinnen as repositories for grave gifts, analogous to objects that otherwise would have been placed within the grave itself.71 Others have connected them with the funeral banquet,72 or with the various ceremonies of commemoration at set points after the funeral (τὰ τρίτα, τὰ ἔνατα), as described by written testimonia,73 or to the presentation of gifts to the dead as heroized ances-tors.74 Recent discussions have turned to the social aspect of the ceremony, seeing it as the family’s means of demonstrating the status of the deceased as an agathos, a position defined in part by elite dining, or his embrace of a leisured lifestyle and the luxurious banqueting customs of the East.75 As for the Opferplätze, Kübler associated them with rites performed later, after 68.

Kistler has suggested that by the end of the 7th century the functions of the offering ditch and the offering place had melded and the rite had lost its original significance; both now served simply as a lavish way to advertise gifts given to the dead, in addition to, or instead of, objects buried in the grave itself.77It would be difficult to ascribe such a meaning to the much humbler offerings of 200 and more years later. The general assumption, expressed in passing in the literature, seems to be that the Opferstellen represent offerings either to the deceased or to undefined chthonic powers.78 Houby-Nielsen, the only scholar to comment on them in depth, sees the Opferstellen as part of a nostalgic, archaizing revival; together with the renewed use of ash-urn burials and the construction of tumuli, they served to create links to an aristocratic past.79 She believes the ritual took place at the funeral, not later, but does not speculate on its nature.The closely crowded conditions of the 4th-century and Hellenistic grave precincts often make it impossible to recognize relationships between Opferstellen and specific burials. Physical proximity, stratigraphy, and ap-proximate contemporaneity, however, suggest possible links between graves and pyrelike Opferstellen in the Eckterrasse and Eridanos cemeteries,80 al-lowing for the possibility that the ritual was at least sometimes associated with a specific burial, rather than with the grave plot as a whole. Such pieces of stratigraphic information as are available indicate that the Opferstellen were put in place after the grave was filled.81 In two instances in the Eri-danos cemetery, Opferstellen precede the construction of a tumulus.82 Since they are not in direct contact with the grave in question, it is impossible to know if they were prepared during the funeral or later; but since they lie under the mound, it was probably not much later. The lavish Opferstelle, perhaps a particularly large pyre, in the precinct of Dionysios of Kollytos, who died between 345 and 338, was deposited after work had begun on his grave monument but before the grave precinct had been completed.83 The evidence thus suggests that some of the rituals documented by the Kerameikos pyres were connected with individual burials, and at least sometimes took place shortly after the burial.Other pyrelike Opferstellen, however, seem to have played a different role. A deposit of about 100 offerings with burnt animal bone in a small oval pit constitutes the latest feature in the precinct of the Messenians, in the Eckterrasse. Kovacsovics conjectured that the burying group, obliged by unknown circumstances to relinquish the precinct in the first quarter of 76. Kerameikos VI.1, p. 92.77. Kistler 1998, pp. 43–45, 59–50.78.

Some served to terminate the burial place, some were performed for specific indi-viduals at about the time of their burial, but for others we can imagine yet other purposes, associated perhaps with maintenance of the family plot and honors for its collective dead. Because they are located in the cemetery, we can be confident that they are concerned with death or the dead, but every-thing beyond that is speculation. It is curious, however, that the number of pyrelike Opferstellen—or of Opferstellen of any description—is much smaller than the number of graves in both of the extensively published Kerameikos cemeteries.87 Shallow pyres were doubtless more susceptible to loss than graves, but the discrepancy in numbers—about five graves for every pyre in the two well-published cemeteries under consideration—seems too large to explain away in this manner. Certainly the number is smaller than would be expected if the ritual in question was performed for every burial, or was a regular obligation, or was carried out in the context of an annual festival.88 But if not for all the dead or on regularly occurring occasions, then for whom, and when? One possible answer is that the ceremony was performed only for some special subclass of the deceased. Support for this notion comes from precinct VII in the Eckterrasse, where a pyre has been linked to the amphora grave of a newborn and the nearby sarcophagus burial of a woman who, Kovacsovics conjectures, may have died giving birth to the child.89 A curse tablet in the fill of her grave90 suggests that her death was considered premature, for those who died before their time were thought to be appropriate messengers for maledictions. An Opferstelle featuring three lebetes gamikoi, a pyxis, and a lekanis decorated with scenes of the epaulia, the gift-giving ceremony that followed the wedding day, is probably to be associated with a woman who died around the time of marriage, another victim of untimely death.91 Perhaps also in this category 84.

An anonymous reader of the manuscript suggested, for instance, that the pyres were offered in the con-text of the Genesia, an annual Attic festival honoring the ancestors (for the festival, see Parker 2005a, pp. 27–28). It is an attractive idea, but I cannot reconcile it with the irregular distribu-tion of the pyres and their association with industrial activity.89.

Although he had already served as an official on Samos, his epitaph tells us that he left behind a living mother, and the remains discovered in his sarcophagus were those of a man not beyond his early 30s.92 Weapons included among offerings buried just north of the Rundbau suggest that the recipient died in battle, perhaps another special case.93 The evidence is admittedly slight, but it is arguable that the pyre ceremony sometimes marked deaths that were untimely or unexpected.a new exPLanatIon: InDustrIaL reLIgIonAs I have argued above, saucer pyres have more than a superficial funereal dimension and, while the purposes of the graveside pyres that they mir-ror are as impenetrable as those of the settlement pyres, the relationship between the two must be taken into account in searching for a plausible explanation of the pyre phenomenon. A final set of data that may be queried in a search for the meaning of the saucer pyres is their spatial distribution. If the pyres were dedicated to protect or consecrate building activities in general, we would expect them to be evenly distributed in buildings around the Agora and elsewhere. Or, if they were dedicated in the course of a funerary ritual echoing ceremonies carried out at the grave, we would expect them to be located in houses, and again to be more or less evenly distributed among preserved residences. As we shall see, neither of these expectations is met.the spatial distribution of the agora PyresSaucer pyres found within the city walls exhibit a markedly skewed distribu-tion. They are never found in the public buildings within the boundaries of the Agora square, and probably not in any buildings with an official public function. Within the “unofficial” sphere, however, they are not restricted to dwellings, but occur also in buildings with a commercial or industrial function. Furthermore, pyres cluster in certain buildings—both houses and shops—while they are absent from others of similar plan.Over two-thirds of the Agora saucer pyres were found in or in close association with buildings (Fig. 2).94 Some of these buildings are only partially excavated, or are so poorly preserved that an adequate plan cannot be recovered: for example, House 3 and House G, where the label “House” is no more than a convenience,95 or the western shop building in section ΡΡ, known from only a few scraps of walls. In those cases where enough is known or preserved for identification, however, the building types divide into two clear categories: private dwelling houses and shop buildings. A total of 19 pyres have come to light in houses, identified as such by their plans, which conform to those of dwellings known in Athens and elsewhere. They include Houses C, D, and probably B in the Industrial District southwest of the public square (see Fig. 78);96 the House of Simon at the southwest entrance to the square (see Fig. 55); and four houses in sections Φ and Ω, 92.

Remains of a pyre were also noted during the cleaning and reconstruc-tion of the House of the Greek Mosaics, farther to the south, which had been excavated by Wilhelm Dörpfeld in the 19th century (see Fig. 103).Slightly more pyres (23) have been found in buildings of an entirely different character. They are distinguished by rows of rooms of the same size, side by side, sometimes single and sometimes paired, in combination with a corridor and/or a courtyard. This plan, in its simplest form like a commercial stoa without its colonnaded porch, can be recognized elsewhere in the Greek world as well, in buildings commonly located in or around agoras.97 It seems clear that this building type served commercial purposes, as a structure consisting of independent rooms that could be rented out to tenants for the conduct of a variety of crafts and businesses. Such structures are probably to be recognized in the “shops on the street” (τούτων τῶν ἐπὶ ταῖς ὁδοῖς ἐργαστηρίων) mentioned by the Athenian orator Aischines (1.124). Whether built by the city to encourage commerce and enhance revenue or by private entrepreneurs as a business venture,98 they were a regular feature of the architectural landscape surrounding the public square at Athens. Among them are the Classical Commercial Building just north of the Stoa Poikile (see Fig. 22), Greek Building Δ farther east on the north side of the square (see Fig. 15), across the street from the Square Peristyle Building, and the ΡΡ shop buildings along the south side of the street that led eastward from the square toward the area of the later Roman Agora (see Fig. 119). Perhaps also to be recognized as belonging to this type are three buildings (Building E and Early Buildings I and II) set around a trapezoidal space southwest of the square (see Fig. 57).Objects found in and under the floors of the Classical Commercial Building and Greek Building Δ provide abundant evidence of industrial use: marble dust and chips, fragments of unfinished sculpture, metal fil-ings and slag, terracotta molds, lumps of pigment and pigment contain-97. For brief comments on this architectural form and its relationship to the stoa, see Coulton 1976, pp. 86– 87. Examples of such freestanding buildings may be found near the mar-ketplaces at Priene (a row of rooms of equal size opening south onto an alley, west of the agora; Wiegand and Schra- der 1904, p. 296, pl. XXI, rooms 12– 17); Pergamon (shops along the Haupt-strasse containing large vessels, hearths, and mills; Dörpfeld 1904, pp. 120–121, pl.

For literary and archaeological evi-dence of Athenian shops and work-shops, see Bettalli 1985; Rotroff 2009.98. We have no direct evidence for these arrangements. The fact that Xenophon (Ways and Means 3.13) urges the Athenians to build such shops suggests that public ownership was conceivable in the mid-4th cen-tury: εἰ δὲ καὶ τοῖς ἀγοραίοις οἰκήσεις τε καὶ πωλητήρια κατασκευασθείη καὶ ἐν Πειραιεῖ καὶ ἐν τῷ ἄστει, ἅμα τ ̓ ἂν κόσμος εἴη τῇ πόλει καὶ πολλαὶ ἂν ἀπὸ τούτων πρόσοδοι γίγνοιντο (Again, if houses and shops were put up both in the Piraeus and in the city for retail traders, they would be an orna-ment to the state, and at the same time the source of a considerable revenue [trans. E. C. Marchant, New York, 1925]). Conversely, Athenian inscrip-tions refer to ergostasia (workshops) in private hands. E.g., Agora I 1749 describes property confiscated from Philokrates of Hagnous, a prominent citizen who had left town rather than stand trial and had been condemned in absentia. The accused had owned two ergostasia in the deme of Melite, bounded on the north and east by two houses (also his property), on the west by a workshop owned by someone else, and on the south by a road leading to the agora (Agora XIX, p. 114, no.

An identification as civic offices has been urged on the basis of their proximity to the Tholos complex,102 but plastered basins, stone-lined pits, and a pit of sand at the east end of Early Building I and fire-hardened pits in its floor are consistent with industrial work, and the alternative of industrial use for the complex remains attractive. However that may be, it is clear that this building type accommodated craftspeople and perhaps businesspeople of other persuasions, and the distribution of the pyres indicates that this group of people frequently dedicated saucer pyres.There are only two relatively well-preserved buildings supplied with pyres that do not at first seem to fall into either of the two categories of house or shop building. At least two and perhaps four pyres (31, 32, 33[?], 34[?]) were buried in the Poros Building (see Fig. 67), a large structure consisting of two rows of rooms along a corridor, a large courtyard, and an annex of four rooms, and located along the street leading to the industrial neighborhood southwest of the public square. Because of its size and the large poros blocks used in its construction, various attempts have been made to identify it as a public building: a law court, civic offices, or, most recently, the state prison.103 Its same-size rooms, set side by side, and its courtyard find parallels, however, in shop buildings, like the smaller Greek Building Δ on the north side of the square, and I would submit that com-mercial/industrial use has as much, or more, to recommend it than any of the other suggestions.104 But whatever its identity and function at the time of its construction in the 5th century, the Poros Building was occupied by marbleworkers in the 4th century, when its pyres were buried. Its northern part was choked with marble debris, interspersed with fragments of pigment and unfinished marble objects, demonstrating that sculptors occupied the premises after its rebuilding in the early 4th century. A pithos and a lekane set into the floor of the northwest room may also be industrial installations (see Fig. 70).105The second anomaly is a similarly large though much less well pre-served building somewhat to the north of the Poros Building (labeled “Strategeion” in Figs. 2, 53), where a single, 3rd-century pyre has been unearthed (pyre 23) and numbers of displaced pyre saucers have been found.

Identification as both the Strategeion (the office of the ten generals) and as the Poleterion (office of the poletai, financial officers) has been suggested.106 A large deposit of marble chips in the northern part of the building, however, shows that marbleworkers were active there in the late 5th or early 4th century, and an extensive system of drains debouching into the Great Drain is easier to explain in terms of workshops than of offices.107 A hoard of late-4th-century coins that recently came to light in the building is open to various interpretations, but it could reflect banking or commercial transactions.108 As has long been recognized, the building’s plan, insofar as it can be recovered, is not unlike that of the Poros Building: rows of rooms of equal size, a corridor, and a courtyard.109 The “Strategeion” too, then, may have been built as a shop building; but even if it was not, it may have been functioning as such when pyre 23 was buried. If we add the pyres in the Poros Building and the “Strategeion” to the list of deposits found in undisputed shop buildings, the total rises to 26–28. Even without these, however, over half of the pyres associated with buildings of identified form were found in structures that were not designed as dwellings, but as workplaces (Fig. 13).The association with craft activities that this distribution indicates is further supported by the observation that craftsmen also practiced their trades within some of the houses where pyres have been found.110 Marble chips and metal waste attest to stonecutting and metalworking during the second phase of House D (see Fig. 78), in the industrial neighborhood, and a large hearth inserted into the court in its third phase shows that some of this activity continued, probably until the house was abandoned.111 Four pyres were buried in the house, at least two of them (39, 40) during the time for which industrial activity is attested; it is reasonable to imagine that pyres 38 and 41 had similar associations. There is no evidence of craft activities in House C, to the south. In its second phase, however, it communicated with House D through a door,112 and it was during this time that displaced pyre 42 must have been buried. Pyre 47 is located in (or possibly just outside) an independent room that was entered from the street and prob-ably functioned as a shop.113 Farther to the north lies the House of Simon 106.

There is also evidence of industrial activity in some of the houses south of the public square. The court of the house in section Φ (see Fig. 105), a structure that housed three or more pyres (56–58), had been plastered in such a way as to direct liquid toward pithoi set into its floor, and the floors in the room south of its courtyard were particularly rich in coins, including one of silver, suggesting repeated and perhaps significant commercial transactions. A tank and a tiled floor in the westernmost of the three houses in section Ω (see Fig. 109) may have served industrial purposes;115 the pyre material found here (59) was out of place, in a room of the house but also spread over its dismantled east wall, but it may have originated within the structure, and an isolated pyre saucer was found elsewhere in the house. It is worth mentioning in this connection that Building Z at the Kerameikos, which housed the only fully published concentration of pyres outside the Agora, is a houselike structure that was serving commercial purposes at the time the pyres were buried (Fig. 11). Although the original function of the building is debated, scholars are in agreement that in its third phase it was functioning as a weaving workshop, a tavern, and probably as a brothel as well.116 Two caches of terracotta molds found in the neighboring Building Y, which hosted at least two pyres, suggest that crafts were practiced there too.117There is also clear evidence of industrial activity in some of the build-ings commonly termed “houses” but whose plans cannot be recovered. Massive amounts of marble dust in House G on the west side of the Street of the Marble Workers leave no doubt as to the craft of its occupants.118 Two pyres there (35, 36) were cut into floors made up of marble waste; a third (37), found in fill just north of the building, may also be connected with this building. The northern side of the Kolonos Agoraios, where House 3 of section ΛΛ is located, was an industrial neighborhood as well, and the remains of a workshop for the casting of small bronzes has been identified in the area of House 3, 119 in which pyre 21 was buried. Although only a small part of the building survives, it includes plastered floors and basins that are earmarks of craft activities (sketched in the notebook by D. B. Thompson; see Fig. 50). There are also pyres that lack an architectural context but where industrial activity is attested by fragments of slag in the surrounding soil (18, 19).The evidence described above is summarized in Figure 14 and represented graphically in Figure 2, where those buildings with craft as-sociations are shaded yellow. A total of 44 pyres (1–16, 18, 19, 21, 23–41, 47, 56–59, 69) can be positively associated with industrial or commercial 114. Thompson 1960.115. Shear 1973a, p. 150.116.

This bias toward industrial settings does not support the thesis that the sole purpose of the pyres was to sanctify the construction or renovation of buildings, plain and simple (though some of the pyres probably played that role). Nor does it conform straightforwardly to the suggestion that the pyres are the physical remains of ceremonies performed in parallel at the home and the graveyard. In what follows, I attempt to come to terms with this distribution in developing a third hypothesis about the function of the Athenian saucer pyres.Industrial religionTwo salient facts about the saucer pyres emerge from the above. First, they are related to deposits, and therefore probably to rituals, that took place in the cemetery. Whatever the unknown details of those rituals, they were performed in reaction to an untoward event, such as a death (perhaps an unusual death) or the abandonment of a burial place. Secondly, saucer pyres are more frequently found in buildings associated with industrial or commercial activities, or in close proximity to industrial debris, than in purely domestic structures. We may add that the one construction event with which pyres are regularly and undoubtedly (though not universally) associated is the laying of a new floor.T. L. Shear Jr. long ago suggested that the saucer pyres might bear witness to a purification ritual enacted when a floor was renewed or when the premises changed hands.120 A new floor is exactly the sort of minor re-furbishing that one would expect to accompany a change in tenants, and the smoking of the surface of the room that would have accompanied burning of the pyre would have been unimportant if a new coat of whitewash was to be applied. The hypothesis is furthermore supported by the bias toward commercial and industrial premises demonstrated by the archaeological record. It is a logical inference that tenants would change more frequently in commercial buildings than in private houses; indeed, Aischines suggests as much in his comments about “shops on the street” alluded to above (p. 76): “If a physician moves into one of these shops on the street, it is 120.

But if he moves out and a smith moves into this same shop, it is called a smithy; if a fuller moves in, a laundry; if a carpenter, a carpentry-shop; and if a pimp and his whores move in, we call it a brothel” (1.124).121 If tenants changed more frequently in commercial buildings than in private houses, the ceremonies would have been performed more often in such buildings, resulting in the multiple pyres that we sometimes observe.This otherwise very appealing explanation, however, does not account for the markedly funereal character of the pyres. Eleftheratou, the only scholar who has addressed this aspect of the deposits in any detail, reads the deposits as offerings to chthonic entities, aimed at purification and probably apotropaic in nature.122 Perhaps such a ceremony was simply good policy when one moved into a new house or shop, and our search for an explanation should stop here. But I would like to explore in more detail the reasons why this particular type of ritual, with its funereal overtones, might have been deemed appropriate, and to consider whether the saucer pyres within the city, like the pyres in the cemetery, are reactions to an untoward event rather than a general prophylactic against future misfortune. At the same time I want to continue to pursue possible connections between the pyres and industrial activity.As argued above, pyres are too uncommon, both in the cemetery and the city, for the pyre ritual to have been enacted in response to every death. I have also argued, however, that they may have been thought appropri-ate in special cases, where a death was unexpected or out of the ordinary. Unusual or untimely deaths are obviously not restricted to artisans, but the workplace does expose craftsmen to unusual dangers, for they work with heavy loads, sharp objects, caustic substances, and fire, all of them items that are difficult to control. Deaths as well as serious or frequent accidents must have been a part of an ancient artisan’s experience. There was also the threat of the failure of the craft process, resulting in economic crisis for the workman and his family. It is perhaps in this region that we should seek at least part of the answer to the pyre mystery.There is no doubt that ancient Athenians undertook rituals when they thought they were in need of protection from malign forces. Theophrastos’s superstitious man (Char. 16) frequently purifies his house against incur-sions of Hekate and assumes from a small piece of misfortune—a mouse getting into his supply of barley groats—that apotropaic rites are in order. This, of course, is presented as an example of ridiculous behavior, but it hints that bad luck or a series of accidents might elicit a ritual reaction.123 The pyre deposits—or a good number of them—may, then, form part of what we might term workers’ ritual practice, a suite of activities designed to protect the artisans and their industrial enterprises.A full exploration of those practices is beyond the scope of this study,124 but a few examples will help to put the hypothesis in context. Accidents in the ancient workplace have sometimes left evidence in the form of thank offerings for the survival of the victim. For example, a mule driver memo-rialized recovery from his injuries in a plaque dedicated to Asklepios at the end of the 5th century.125 A generation earlier, according to Plutarch (Per. 13.7–8), Pericles dedicated a statue to Athena Hygieia in thanks for the miraculous survival of a workman grievously hurt during the construction 121. ἐὰν δ ̓ εἰς ἓν δήπου τούτων τῶν ἐπὶ ταῖς ὁδοῖς ἐργαστηρίων ἰατρὸς εἰσ- οικίσηται, ἰατρεῖον καλεῖται· ἐὰν δ ̓ μὲν ἐξοικίσηται, εἰς δὲ τὸ αὐτὸ τοῦτο ἐργα- στήριον χαλκεὺς εἰσοικίσηται, χαλκεῖον ἐκλήθη, ἐὰν δὲ κναφεύς, κναφεῖον, ἐὰν δὲ τέκτων, τεκτονεῖον· ἐὰν δὲ πορνο- βοσκὸς καὶ πόρναι, ἀπὸ τῆς ἐργασίας αὐτῆς ἐκλήθη πορνεῖον (trans.

Parker (1983, pp. 222–232) discusses such purifications, speculating on bad luck as a context for ritual puri-fication (p. 224).124. For a preliminary study of the topic, see Smith 2009. A.-C.

Artisans and workers gave material gifts to the gods in thanks for the success of their work,128 but there is also evidence that there were ritual reactions when the outcome was not good: when the injured person did not recover, injuries occurred with unwonted frequency, or the work did not proceed well.A few, and often-cited, pieces of evidence help to throw light on the attitude of ancient artisans toward the causes of and cures for workplace successes and failures. The first is a short poem entitled Κάμινος (The Kiln), which survives in the Suda and in the Pseudo-Herodotean Life of Homer. It is thought to have been composed in Athens in the 5th century,129 perhaps not so long before pyres began to be dedicated. Encountering a group of potters, the poet offers, for pay, to perform a poem inviting Athena to protect the kiln and its products, ensuring a successful firing and a good profit. He also gives a sample of the curse he will perform if the potters do not take him up on his offer. Summoning five demons specializing in the destruction of pottery in the making, he will invite them to destroy the kiln and the pottery it contains, and furthermore to scorch those tending the kiln.130Noting the similarity of the language and syntax of the kiln poem to those of actual (rather than literary) curses, Christopher Faraone has argued that the poem is in reality an anthology of three separate curses, of the sort that really were leveled at craftsmen in antiquity.131 Many such curses are preserved on lead defixiones, or curse tablets, with spells “bind-ing” the persons, work, and products of a variety of artisans, including net makers, metalworkers, potters, and carpenters.132 A possible example of the early 4th century even came to light in the excavation of House D, a structure rich in pyres.133 Strabo, writing considerably later, illustrates the 126.

Wolters (1891, p. 160) sug-gested the plague as a more credible motive for the dedication.128. Van Straten (1981, pp. 92–95) cites offerings from the proceeds of one’s work (unspecified work, a catch of fish, goat herding), of the work itself, and the tools employed.129.

Possible portraits of such demons have been recognized on a graffito from the workshop of Phidias at Olympia (Mallwitz and Schiering 1964, pp. 237–247, fig. 68, pl. 79; Papa-dopoulos 2003, p. 192, fig. 3.1) and, more controversially, on a Boiotian black-figure skyphos (Athens, National Museum 1114-2624 [442]); see Papa-dopoulos 2003, pp. 193–195, fig. 3.4); both of these sources contain further discussion of protective measures invoked by craftsmen, to which what follows here is indebted. For the Ro- man idea that curses could break pot-tery, see Plin. HN 28.4. A much later scene on a moldmade bowl (2nd cen-tury) shows five figures disrupting work in a flour mill (Sinn 1979, pp. 117– 119, MB 64, MB 65, fig. 10). It is thought to derive from the poetic tradi-tion of the kinaidoi, but the number five and the workshop setting are intriguing.131. Faraone 2001; see also Gager 1992, p. 153.132. Gager (1992, pp. 151–174) collects a representative sample of curses related to crafts and businesses. A large number of these were found in Athens and Attica and, interestingly, they cluster in the 4th century and the Hellenistic period, contemporary with the Athenian pyres.133. Young 1951a, pp. 222–223. The tablet dates in the earlier 4th cen-tury and curses two individuals charac-terized as τὸν χαλκέα, perhaps smiths, but possibly citizens of Chalkis (Curb-era and Jordan 1998, p. 217). It was found in the melted mud brick (layer 4) over the floor of room 5 of House D (see Fig. 78). The layer is considerably later than the curse tablet, which must therefore be out of place; Young conjec-tured that it had originally been placed under a floor or in the foundations, and later displaced by people scavenging in the ruins of the house. Curbera and Jordan (1998, pp. 215–216), however, noting that the normal place of deposit for such tablets at this date is in a grave or a chthonic shrine, doubt that its original place of deposit was within the house. They suggest that it has been"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"toward a new interpretation83effectiveness of such curses in an anecdote about the Telchines, mysteri-ous and sinister figures associated with craft, who also had a reputation for witchery. According to some sources, writes Strabo, they got this reputa-tion as a result of the curses of rival workmen, who were jealous of their excellent craftsmanship.134There is also evidence for the measures that ancient craftsmen took to protect themselves against such curses.135 A variety of written testimonia mention the βασκάνιον, a charm mounted near the furnace or kiln or in front of a workshop. The fullest description is provided by rather late sources. Pollux (7.108) writes that “it was the custom with blacksmiths to hang up, or plaster on, in front of their forges certain laughable objects in order to avert envy. They were called baskania or amulets.” He goes on to quote two lines of Aristophanes (“unless one bought a furnace amulet from an unwilling blacksmith”136), thus demonstrating that the custom goes back to Classical times. Phrynichos elaborates that “it is a contrivance of human shape but varying slightly from it, which craftsmen hang up in front of their workshops to avoid any ‘overlooking’ [βασκαίνεσθαι] of their work.”137 Scholia on Aristophanes, Birds, line 436, further gloss the word ἐπιστάτης as a molded clay figure of Hephaistos set up beside hearths or furnaces to watch over the fire.Much earlier visual documentation illustrates some of these devices. A kiln pictured on a terracotta plaque from Penteskouphia, near Corinth, is protected by the owl that sits on its vaulted roof and by a small bearded figure (satyr?) on the stoking tunnel who grasps his erect penis.138 The figure is an aggressively apotropaic device of the sort that one might expect to be effective against curses like that in the kiln poem and the demons that they invoke. A mask garlanded with boughs protects the kiln of a potter’s workshop painted on an Attic black-figure hydria of the last quarter of the 6th century;139 a running satyr that adorns the metal furnace on a somewhat later red-figure krater plays the same role.140 A larger set of protective de-vices accompanies the furnace on the famous Berlin Foundry cup, painted inadvertently included in the fabric of the mud brick; this, however, begs the question of why mud for bricks would have been excavated from a grave or a shrine. Another possible provenience, however, is the disturbed pyre 39, lo- cated in the same room, and, like the tablet, dating in the earlier 4th century. Some of the material from that pyre had strayed into layer 5, the floor layer above which the curse tablet was found. For the association of a curse tablet with a typical pyre offering, see Jordan and Rotroff 1999; in this case a curse tablet (IL 1504) was placed inside a chytridion (P 27880) found in a two-room building north of the houses in section Ω (see Chap. 2, n. 24).134.

When workmen experienced more inju-ries than usual, and injuries of an uncanny (θειότερον) sort, the Knidians suspected divine opposition. Consulting Delphi, they were told not to cut through the isthmus, for Zeus would have made Knidos an island if that was what he had wanted. The Athenian craftsman, however, could not desist from his work; when things continued to go wrong, he had to find some other solution. Like the superstitious man with his barley bag, he may have consulted a religious authority; or tradition may have provided advice. It is my conjecture that this advice may have included the saucer-pyre rite. In this connection it is worth pointing out the possible association of magical inscriptions with two pyres. As mentioned above (p. 82), a curse tablet possibly directed against bronzeworkers was found in room 5 of House D, and may originally have been deposited with the disturbed pyre 39 in the same room. In a similarly tantalizing situation, a lamp inscribed with a list of names written backwards, probably with magical intent, was found in the house in section Φ, not far from pyre 58; Homer Thompson speculated that it may have been buried as a curse.145If my conjecture is correct, the ritual documented by the pyres may, at least in some instances, have been enacted to turn away malevolent entities, and was probably perceived as a species of purification. Two well-preserved sacred laws describe rituals of this nature as they were performed at Selinous and Cyrene in the mid-5th and late 4th centuries, respectively.146 Although they concern rites performed at a different level and in places distant from Athens, they shed light on Greek practice that may be relevant to the Athenian pyres. Both inscriptions contain provisions for purification from an unwanted supernatural visitant.147 In the Cyrene inscription, this entity is envisioned as having been sent against the victim by someone else, 141.

In both cases the visitant is offered a meal, and at Selinous the meal is followed by a sacrifice. A papyrus fragment of a mime of Sophron (second half of the 5th century), outlining the procedure for removing an unnamed goddess, presumably Hekate, from the household, hints at a similar sequence;148 along with a collection of purificatory and protective items (salt, laurel, asphalt), a meal and a sacrifice are offered. These two ritual acts—sacrifice and a meal—are both represented in the saucer pyres. The animal bone attests to the former, and, as discussed above, the pottery assemblage contains all the items nec-essary for a feast in miniature. It is intriguing that another section of the Selinuntine law, also dealing with purifications, specifies the spreading of a cloth (perhaps to be recognized in the textile attested in pyres 4 and 15) and the preparation of a honey mixture in new cups, like those commonly found in the pyres; a further similarity is that the cups are subsequently to be burnt.149 If the texts are any guide, other activities may have included libation (perhaps attested by the cups commonly included in the pyres), fumigation (which would be the effect of the fire within a closed space), aspersion, and anointing. What does not seem to fit with such a ritual is the burial of the remains within the building. The remnants of the feast at Cyrene were to be removed to an unworked wood, and the Athenian custom of offering meals to Hekate involved taking the food out of the house and placing it at the crossroads, presumably to entice the goddess away from the home.150 So little is known of these rituals, however, that perhaps retention of the remains within the building is not as unusual as it seems. It is perhaps of some interest, in this connection, that one pyre (52) was buried near the meeting place of four roads,151 the sort of location where shrines of Hekate were customarily located, and some pyres were buried in the remains of ruined buildings (see p. 66, above).unanswereD QuestIonsThe hypothesis developed above, whatever its merits, still leaves a number of questions unanswered. If the ritual was closely associated with craft and industry, how can we account for pyres found in buildings that, from their plans, must be dwellings, and where there is no indication of such activities? Conversely, why are pyres lacking in other buildings where there are clear indications of commerce and craft? Furthermore, this hypothesis, along with all the others that have been advanced to date, does not address the issue of the introduction of the custom in the late 5th century, or the reason for its apparent abandonment, or at least its significant decline, after the middle of the 3rd century.148.

House C, with six deposits, is a pyre “hot spot” (see Fig. 78). Some of its pyres may have been laid down after the house was abandoned (45[?], 46, and perhaps 44) and one (47) is located in the northwest room with external access that probably served as a shop. Two, however, were without a doubt buried while the house was occupied (42, 43). Pyre 42 dates near the beginning of phase 2, when House C communicated with House D, where metalsmiths and marbleworkers were active. Pyre 43, however, postdates the blocking up of the communicating door, and thus has no demonstrable connection with industrial activity. One or two pyres (49, 48[?]) were found in House B, south of House C. We know nothing about activities that went on there, but there is no positive evidence of industrial or commercial activity.Several pyres were found in the three houses of section Ω (see Fig. 109). The western house, the probable source of one or more disturbed pyres dispersed in fill over its east wall (59), preserves possible traces of indus-trial activity in the form of a tank and a tiled floor, but there are no such indications in the other two houses, where at least three pyres were buried (60–62). The houses had been very greatly disturbed by later construction, and almost all of the Classical floors had disappeared,152 taking with them whatever evidence they may have had to offer about activities within the houses. The large central house, however, had relatively lavish appointments, including an andron and three mosaic floors, which do nothing to invite the reconstruction of a workshop within its walls. It is true, however, that one of these floors was later stuccoed over,153 so the house could have been converted to other uses. The House of the Greek Mosaics (see Fig. 103), which hosted at least one pyre (55), was an even more elegantly appointed dwelling than the central Ω house, and as such an unlikely venue for in-dustry. In sum, a total of five structures—Houses B and C, the House of the Greek Mosaics, and two houses in section Ω—lack evidence of craft or commercial activity. Poor preservation may be enough to account for this, but it is also important to remember that many craft activities would have left no trace. In any event, I do not argue that the pyre ritual served only a single purpose; it is indeed probable that such offerings were made on a variety of occasions, not all of them necessarily associated with disasters in the workroom. Accidents and untimely deaths also happen in the home. It should also be pointed out that any structure, while under construction, is a workplace, and many so-called foundation deposits may have been dedicated by the builders, rather than owners or prospective occupants of a structure, and aimed at the protection of their work rather than the consecration of the building.Industrial Buildings without PyresA related question is why some industrial buildings, like the Classical Commercial Building and Greek Building Δ, are well supplied with pyres, while the offerings are absent in others with similar plans and apparently analogous uses. No pyres came to light in the commercial building located immediately to the west of Greek Building Δ. So little of the structure was 152. Shear 1973a, pp. 147, 150, 154; the plans (figs. 4, 5 on pp. 148–149) give a good idea of the poor state of preservation of the two eastern houses.

Pyres are also absent from the mudbrick shop building under the Stoa of Attalos,154 built and then soon demolished within the second quarter of the 2nd century to make way for the Stoa. It was located just south of the Square Peristyle, the southern-most corner of which lay under the brick building’s northern wall. Slight remains suggest that another building similar in plan preceded it on the site, though nothing can be determined about the date of its construction. The plans—rooms of equal size set side by side—suggest a commercial function for both buildings. The later, better-preserved structure had five pairs of rooms, each pair consisting of a square front room opening to the north and suitable as retail space, and a much smaller room to the south. Iron slag in the westernmost front room attests to the presence of metalworkers, while a concentration of braziers and vessels for food preparation and wine service, dumped to the south of the second room from the west, suggests the presence of a tavern.155 Fill under the floor of the building is similar in nature, so the predecessor may have served the same purpose. The absence of pyres here may be a function of the late date. Although the Acropolis Metro station excavations have demonstrated that the dedication of pyres continued into the 2nd or even the 1st century, present evidence indicates they became much less common after the middle of the 3rd century, and the disappearance of the characteristic pyre vessels of earlier times also makes them more difficult to identify. These factors may explain the absence of pyres from the mudbrick building.More difficult to dismiss is the case of the House of Menon and Mikion, located southwest of the public square, about halfway between the House of Simon and Houses C and D. Abundant marble waste and sculptor’s tools attest to the use of the house by generations of stonework-ers, from the second quarter of the 5th century to the first quarter of the 3rd.156 No pyres have been found in the ruins of the house, and the fills of the cisterns and well that served it do not contain vessels of the typical pyre assemblage.157 Menon and Mikion, it appears, felt no need to enact the pyre ritual, despite the fact that others in their neighborhood who were engaged in the same business did so repeatedly. One possible explanation is that practice of the pyre ritual was restricted to a limited segment of the 154. Agora XXVII, pp. 107–112, fig. 14.155.

There are five rilled-rim plates in cistern F 16:8 (e.g., Miller 1974, pp. 206, 236, nos. 41, 42, fig. 5, pl. 32), but, as we have seen, this shape is not confined to pyres. Several miniature vessels came to light there as well, but except for a chytridion (p. 238, no. 63, pl. 34), none conform to the pyre assemblage. Cistern F 16:1, which also served the house, contained a rilled- rim plate and two concave-rim plates (P 28217–P 28219), a small Corinthian skyphos (P 2551), and a small unglazed pyre saucer (P 2535), but only the latter of these can be connected unambigu-ously with a pyre. Deposit F 16:7, buried in the line of the southeast wall of the house, apparently after the wall was dismantled (and thus probably not by the occupants of the house), has been published as a pyre (Miller 1974, p. 210, n. 80, pl. 35, marked with a cross in fig. 1). It differs in many particulars, however, from the standard pyre assem-blage. It consisted of a full-size chytra, covered by a rilled-rim plate and con-taining an olpe and the bones of a puppy. Although I once argued that its purpose may have been similar to that of saucer pyres ( Jordan and Rotroff 1999, p. 148), it now seems more pru-dent to assume that it represents a ritual deposit of some other nature. Farther afield, a small pyre saucer (P 776) was found in the street to the east, but it contained traces of red coloring and was probably serving as a paint pot. Across the street and farther to the east, fragments of two lopadia and several possible pyre saucers were found in well G 16:1 (P 2554 [Agora XII, p. 374, no. 1974, pl. 95], P 36051, and unin-ventoried fragments in lots ΣΤ 112, ΣΤ 115, ΣΤ 119) and in a chytridion in cistern B 16:3 (P 741, Thompson 1934, p. 341, B 32, fig. 12), too far away to imagine any connection with the house."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"chapter 488population—to metics, for instance, or to incomers from a limited range of localities. Because metics could not own land, many made their living as artisans, builders, or traders;158 the spatial association of the saucer pyres with venues associated with crafts and commerce suggests that many of those who practiced the pyre ritual were not Athenian citizens. It is also worth mentioning that individual religious belief and practice would have varied over a broad spectrum, from atheism to piety and superstition;159 less god-fearing households would leave behind fewer traces of religious observance.the appearance and disappearance of PyresA final pair of puzzles involves the introduction of the custom and its disappearance. As outlined above, pyres appear in Athenian houses around the turn from the 5th to the 4th century, with one or perhaps two earlier instances recognizable in pyres 38 and 48(?) at the Agora and another in the second phase of Building Z at the Kerameikos, dating close to 425.160 One plausible explanation of the seemingly sudden introduction of an un-precedented custom is that it was brought in from elsewhere. As mentioned above, many of the craftsmen of Athens were metics and slaves, and if the pyre custom has a special relevance to industry, the notion of its enter-ing Athens with incomers from abroad is all the more likely. I. Andreou and E. Andreou, noting that the custom of burying caches of miniature pots under the floors of houses is shared by Ambracia and Leukada, both Corinthian colonies, have suggested that at Athens the custom originated with Corinthian potters who had established themselves there.161 There are, indeed, some tantalizing links between Athenian pyres and Corinthian ceramics. Two 4th-century deposits in Corinth contained covered bowls seemingly identical in fabric and surface treatment to the ones found in Athenian pyres, though slightly different in shape.162 An unusual kernos-like miniature plate in the dispersed pyre 28 finds a very close parallel, in both shape and fabric, in one of these same deposits.163 Nothing else in the pyres, however, has any resonance with Corinthian votives, which tend toward tiny miniatures in a range of shapes unparalleled at Athens.164 In response, it can be argued that the residential areas of Corinth remain largely unknown, and that votives appropriate to more public shrines might have been quite different from items offered in a private context. Despite the hostility between Athens and Corinth during precisely the period in question, there is evidence of movement of craftsmen between the two cities at that time. Sometime in the last two decades of the 5th century, the Suessula Painter, who usually worked in Attic clay, decorated a bell krater made of Corinthian clay and found at Corinth,165 evidence that he established himself at Corinth during this period. Another small hint comes from a stamp motif shared by Attic and Corinthian black-gloss vessels, pointing, in Pemberton’s opinion, either to a “traveling Athenian or returning Corinthian.”166 Athenian craftsmen, it seems, certainly worked in Corinth, though I am unaware of incontrovertible evidence for Corin-thians in Athens at the same time. But if not Corinthians, then perhaps other migrants, such as country dwellers who moved into the city at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War, brought their customs with them.158. Evidence suggests a mixture of citizens and metics in these profes-sions. Whitehead (1977, p. 117) com-ments that most metics were probably banausoi, though not all banausoi were metics. A very old analysis of building accounts of the late 5th and 4th cen- tury revealed a ratio of 50 citizens to 80 metics involved in these activities as entrepreneurs, makers and furnishers of materials, and artisans (Clerc 1893, pp. 391–392); metics were also prom- inent in commerce and banking (pp. 396–410).159.

The only way around this difficulty would be to suggest that the practice of dedicating pyres was brought by outsiders, but that they adopted an Attic assemblage, developed for graveside pyres, in its performance. Such an argument would be more convincing, however, if we could point to another site or region where subfloor ritual deposits display the same bias toward workshop spaces.The other possibility—that we are witnessing a native florescence, growing out of the custom of graveside devotions that, although it had never gone completely out of use, had been practiced at only a very reduced level for the past century—presents its own set of problems. Houby-Nielsen’s explanation of the phenomenon as a nostalgic recreation of earlier funerary customs does nothing to explain why the practice should have moved into the settlement. Certainly the last third of the 5th century was a time of enormous stress for Athens. The first recognizable pyres are closely contem-porary with cataclysmic events: the beginning of the Peloponnesian War, the crowding of the city as people moved from the countryside to the greater security its walls afforded, and the plague that resulted shortly thereafter. Although any detailed scenario would be speculative, it is highly likely that some combination of these pressures encouraged the development of the pyre ritual, even though most of the preserved pyres were buried when those events were in the past. Established in times of crisis, the ritual may have continued to serve a purpose once those times had passed.At the other end of its history, full comprehension of the disappearance of the custom is hampered by the incomplete publication of the pyres from the Acropolis Museum and Metro station excavations, where pyres later than any at the Agora have been found. It therefore remains impossible to know whether the apparent decline of the custom after the middle of the 3rd century reflects the true trajectory of the practice, or is instead an artifact of the local history of the neighborhoods around the public square, several of which were abandoned in the 3rd century. The question is further complicated by the reformulation of the pyre assemblage that took place shortly after 270, eliminating the easily recognizable miniatures and thereby making it more difficult to identify pyres in the archaeological record. But if, as I conjecture, the pyre ritual was primarily carried out by craftsmen, a decline in the 3rd century is not at all surprising. Andrew Stewart has drawn attention to the emigration of Attic sculptors in the 3rd century, as the fortunes and population of Athens declined and sculptural commis-sions became fewer.167 Based on a study of signed statue bases and literary references to Athenian sculptors active in the period 320 to 210, Stewart found a marked reduction in the evidence for work in Athens after ca. 270, along with evidence that these artists continued to be active abroad. Those men, of course, were dependent upon major commissions, while most craftsmen were engaged in producing the necessities of everyday life and hence were not subject to the same pressures. Several of our pyres, however, are associated with metal- and marbleworking, and it is possible that part of the livelihood of those who buried them derived from involvement in larger sculptural projects. A sculptor leaving town would surely have taken a 167. Stewart 1979, pp. 5–7."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"chapter 490considerable team of skilled coworkers with him, resulting in an appreciable decrease in the number of artisans active in the city. A similar decrease in the pottery industry is implied by the decline of Athenian fine-ware exports after about 270.168 Local potters, of course, continued to produce vessels for domestic use, but the loss of export markets must mean that they were doing so at a lower quantitative level. At the same time, we see the begin-ning of a greater dependence upon imported plain-ware vessels.169 The reasons for this are unclear, but the observation again translates into less work for local potters. We may therefore conjecture that there were fewer potteries, and therefore fewer artisans employed in this craft as well. These factors thus indicate a decrease in the population responsible for the pyre dedications, and may figure in an explanation of the decline of the custom.It is perhaps not coincidental that the stresses on the artisan population discussed above are precisely contemporary with the change in the pyre assemblage around the year 270. This points to a change of some sort in the ritual, though it is impossible to say how profound that change may have been. The material record tells us that pyre pottery was no longer being produced. It could be that the potter or potters who had supplied this material went out of business for any number of reasons (accidental destruction of the pottery, the death of the potter, economic pressures), or were among those craftsmen who sought employment abroad. In that case, however, surely other producers would have stepped in to respond to demand for these vessels, if such demand existed. It may be that the groups that had participated in the ritual constituted a limited part of the society, and that as they died out, assimilated, or departed over the six or so generations during which the practice flourished, demand for these special vessels disappeared.Another possibility, however, is that the ideology behind the ritual changed. Kistler’s analysis of the assemblages dedicated in the Opferrinne ceremony of the Late Geometric and Protoattic periods presents a parallel case.170 The original assemblage documented in deposits dating between ca. 720 and 650 invariably combined vessels for mixing, drinking, and pouring, along with a fourth mixed category (food presentation and storage, oil). Af-ter 650, however, this complex was no longer maintained. Kistler reads this as a change in the ideology behind the offerings, which no longer stressed the leisurely and luxurious lifestyle evoked by the original assemblage.The original pyre assemblage alludes primarily to cooking, eating, and drinking. The smaller assemblage of the 3rd century maintains the reference to food and drink by the inclusion of the rilled-rim plate and a drinking cup, but food preparation is no longer represented, and the absence of multiple miniatures seems to point toward individual rather than group participation in the rite. We might also postulate a greater emphasis on light, for the lamp, present in fewer than half of the earlier pyres, is almost always included in the later offerings. The concepts behind these changes, however, remain opaque.168. Agora XXIX, p. 223.169. Agora XXXIII, pp. 61–64.170.

The roadside shrines common in present-day Greece are a case in point. Although their forms vary from a simple metal box on stilts to an elaborate miniature church, all are sited on the verge of a road or track and contain a similar range of objects, and the first-time visitor might assume that they represent a uniform class. Yet they serve a range of quite different purposes: as me-morials to the victims of traffic accidents; as votives in thanks for surviving such accidents; as outposts of a nearby church, chapel, or monastery, enabling passersby to pay their respects or make a donation without turning aside from their journeys; or as less closely defined expressions of religious faith.1 The pyres are different, in that they were never intended to be seen—their message, unlike that of the shrines, was not directed toward the living—but, like the shrines, they most likely document responses to a variety of events, and the ritual(s) that produced them fulfilled a variety of needs. Some were enacted when a building was built or rebuilt (by the workmen, or the own-ers, or the future inhabitants?), others when floors were renewed (during ordinary redecoration, or when tenants changed?), others when buildings were abandoned (by the departing inhabitants?), still others, I argue, when accidents or a death indicated that malign forces needed to be appeased.Archaeologists working in Greece frequently turn to modern customs in an attempt to understand ancient phenomena. There is no doubt that an abyss of time and profound changes, populations, creeds, and ways of life separate present-day Greece from its ancient past; but some concerns are shared by all human creatures, and, like our predecessors on this planet, we still struggle to protect ourselves from the blows that fate delivers. Modern responses to these age-old concerns can be invoked as analogies to ancient ones, providing—if nothing else—ways of envisioning past realities. In ex-panding upon their interpretation of the pyres as building deposits, I. and E. Andreou describe analogous modern rites, involving sacrifice, libations, gifts, and a blessing as the foundation is laid.2 Contemporary Greek culture offers another analogy that helps to dramatize the pyre ceremony as a response to problems in the workplace. The Greek Orthodox Church provides the rite of exorcism against the powers of evil, whose work can be seen in the many mishaps and disasters that befall human beings. The following account, supplied by Phyllis Graham at my request, describes the distressing events that led to an exorcism at the museum at Nemea in the summer of 1981:1.

Apparently wondering what it took to detonate the small “blasting caps” used to make holes on poured concrete walls and floors, he placed one on the floor and struck it with a hammer. The charge made a deep wound in the palm of his hand, traumatizing him, and thoroughly unnerving all bystanders. The victim was hospitalized in Corinth for several days. Soon afterward, an electrician, pulling overhead wires in the museum’s main workroom, fell backwards from an upper mezza- nine when a railing gave way against his weight. His head struck the pottery tables below, which collapsed, with his already convulsing body, to the cement floor of the workroom. The photographer and two museum staff members at the scene saw immediately that his skull was fractured on one side, above the ear. Someone ran to call for help from the director and workmen in the field, while others attempted vainly to make the victim comfortable, speaking the few words of Greek they knew, holding his hand, cradling his head, and praying that he was somehow beyond pain and terror as he lay mor-tally injured. He was taken to Corinth, and a few days later to Ath-ens, where he died without ever regaining consciousness. He left a widow and children in the nearby town of Argos. Already saddened and sobered by these events, the American staff and their village neighbors soon experienced another shock early one evening when a farm vehicle—the very unstable freza, not much seen these days, that combines features of a tractor’s front end with a cart or wagon—carrying a family home from the fields, overturned in a deep ditch near the dig house. Two adults and a small child were trapped underneath. Crowds came running to lift the vehicle, blankets were rushed from the dig house to the scene; the fright was palpable, as was the immense relief when the family miraculously emerged with only light injuries. Accidents this frequent and this serious naturally took a toll on the morale and confidence of the excavation workforce, both Ameri-can and Greek. Feelings of deep unease were conveyed to the director through the foreman and respected elders among the crew. No one was without a sense of foreboding about the final weeks of the project. It was as much a relief to the non-Greek, non-Orthodox as to the locals when a priest was eventually summoned to conduct rites of exorcism in the pottery room at the site where the electrician fell. The ceremony took place late one afternoon, with all members of the excavation assembled and quietly attentive—much more so than during any normal Sunday liturgy in church—while the officiator intoned and cast incense about the afflicted space. The need for pro-pitiation, although most directly associated with the building where the fatality had occurred, clearly extended to all work areas and func-tions, both indoors and out. It was only after ritual had neutralized whatever demons of the workplace had been afoot that the project regained some sense of equilibrium as the season drew to a close."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"afterword93The ancient world, of course, was very different, but its denizens faced the same problems, and their belief that evil forces could thwart human endeavor but also could be controlled by ritual was surely no less.

Within each building, pyres are listed in chronological order, with one exception, the Classical Commercial Building north of the public square. The rooms of that structure apparently did not communicate with one another, so each functioned as an independent space. Therefore these pyres are listed first by room, then by date.Buildings in which pyres have been found are shown in Figure 2, with the catalogue numbers of the pyres and references to the pertinent figures. Red crosses denote the locations of the pyres within the buildings. Pyres without architectural associations are indicated by red crosses with their catalogue numbers.Each building is introduced with a brief history of its development, comments on its function, and a summary of the pyres found within it. Lengthy accounts of Houses B–D and G in the Industrial District were published by Rodney Young in 1951; I use his published nomenclature for houses and rooms but refer to the notebook labels for strata within the houses, which he did not discuss in detail in his publication. Similarly, in the case of buildings that still await final publication, I have adopted the terminology and numbering for structures and stratigraphy used in the notebooks, which varies from excavator to excavator. This means that I do not follow a uniform system; layers, for instance, are sometimes numbered"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"catalogue96from top to bottom, sometimes from bottom to top, sometimes with Arabic numerals, sometimes with Roman ones.Each catalogue entry presents a deposit, usually a pyre, but I also include a few larger deposits (strata, fills, wells) in which pyre vessels have been found. A question mark has been added in cases where identification as a pyre is in doubt.Entries include the following information: Agora deposit number (a reference to the “new” 20-meter grid followed by a colon and a number); excavation section and specific location, according either to the old ex-cavation grid (using Arabic and Greek numbers) or the new grid (using letters and numbers), with elevation above sea level (masl) where recorded, and the pottery lot for uninventoried contents of the pyre (Greek let-ters and numbers). Because standards of excavation and recovery have evolved over time, I also include the initials of the excavator and the year of excavation (e.g., RSY, 1949); a key to the initials is given below. The condition of the deposit (undisturbed, disturbed, dispersed) is also noted; this information is important for some of my conclusions, and is tallied in Table 1. Previous publication follows. Dimensions are given where known, but often these were not preserved, and when preserved they were not uniformly recorded. The main body of the entry describes the pyre, its contents, its stratigraphic situation, and its relationship to the building in which it was found, and discusses any problems involved in its interpretation. Phrases in quotation marks are taken from the ac-counts in the field notebooks.Artifacts are listed, with brief comparanda and dates where appropriate. The approximate number of objects present is given, but precise counts are difficult, since it is impossible to be sure in some cases whether nonjoining fragments come from a single vessel, or whether a body and a lid go together. Matching lids and bodies are counted as a single object, although they have sometimes been given two different inventory numbers; as a result, the number of objects may not match the number of inventory numbers listed. If an object has been published, I give an abbreviated reference to that publication in parentheses, with a date if the object in question is in-dependently datable. If it is not independently datable, when feasible I pro- vide an estimated date, followed by the comparanda (usually from Agora I V, XII, or XXIX) on which that date is based. I use the lamp typology of Agora IV (Howland types), but the dates reflect the adjustments that both Scheibler (Kerameikos XI) and I (Agora XXIX, pp. 493–516) have suggested. Coins are identified by Agora XXVI varieties; most of the identifications were made by John Kroll.Information about surviving organic contents varies from pyre to pyre. The bones are being studied by Lynn Snyder, but she has not yet produced a final report. In anticipation of this, I note the presence of surviving animal bone; preliminary information that she has given me is credited as (Snyder). Maria Ntinou analyzed the charcoal from several pyres. Her results are given in detail in Appendix I and credited in the entries as (Ntinou). Flotation was carried out on some of the more recently excavated pyres, and in a few cases identifiable organic remains were recovered.

I also quote notebook descriptions of bone and other organic material that is no longer extant, either discarded or misplaced at the time of excavation or lost over the years.Entries conclude with an estimated date for the deposit, with the main evidence for that date given in parentheses. Needless to say, all dates are approximate, but I have not qualified spans with “ca.” All dates are b.c. unless otherwise indicated.Coins, organic material, uninventoried fragments, and some invento-ried objects preserved only in fragments are not illustrated.

It had a long life, from at least the 5th century to the Roman period, but with periods of decline and abandonment. Two different histories of its development have been advanced (Shear 1973a, 138–144; Milbank 2002). Shear believes that Building Δ was constructed in the late 6th century, rebuilt after the Persian invasion, and then extensively remodeled in the late 5th century. This phase, lasting from the late 5th to the 3rd century, saw minor adjust-ment and frequent relaying of floors. In his view, the building went into decline and was abandoned in the course of the 3rd century; it was then rebuilt around the middle of the 2nd century. Shear sees the pyres, as well as a mid-3rd-century dump of amphoras in room 6 (deposit P 6:7), as evidence of this decline and abandonment.Milbank, who does not use the pyres for the reconstruction of the histo-ry of the building, concludes that it was first built after the Persian invasion (Table 6; see Milbank 2002, pp. 88–102, for his summary of the building’s history). Its first phase lasted until the early 3rd century, and pyre 1 was"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"catalogue98laid with the latest floor of that phase. The building was expanded east-ward in a second phase, which lasted into the 2nd century; pyre 2 was laid in the course of this phase. The building was abandoned after ca. 175 (pyre 3 may coincide with that event), to be rebuilt some years later (in the third quarter of the 2nd century). I use Milbank’s phasing in the descrip-tions below.Figure 15. Plan of greek building Δ, with pyres marked and coded for date. Drawing S. I.

Several pyre objects were found in the floor makeup (careless definition of pyre? or real dispersal in layer?). Milbank (2002, pp. 46–47) associates the pyre with the laying of layer 8, which he identifies as the latest floor of phase I; if so, the pyre predates the renovations of phase II. The floor in which the pyre was embedded is the earliest to show evidence of commercial and industrial activity: coins and a piece of bronze slag.Seventeen artifacts: cup-kantharos with squat rim, slightly worn resting surface (after ca. 325, cf.

Milbank dismisses the moldmade bowl fragment as intrusive, and concludes that the pyre was dug from a higher level, despite the failure to discern a pit during excavation.

Failure of a careful excavator to identify a pit is probably due to the fact that this strip of stratigraphy was dug by tunneling under later Roman remains. The room is thought to have gone out of use considerably later, after ca. 175 (Milbank 2002, p. 27). The burial of the pyre thus predates the abandonment of the room, and probably took place sometime during the course of phase II. An amphora dump of the mid-3rd century (deposit P 6:7), along with a heavy concentration of coins near the entrance, suggests this room may have been a shop for foodstuffs.Seven artifacts: type 46E lamp (225–200, cf.

Large pocket of pottery, bones, carbon, and ash, partly cut away by later wall; no pit identified. The pyre was encountered below layer 2 (lot ΒΔ 238), a red fill with mud bricks, probably to be associated with a destruction of the building, but difficult to date: pottery ranged from Archaic (possibly from mud bricks) to first quarter of 3rd century, with two later fragments (Cypriot sigillata, piece of glass). The pyre lay directly above a fill of sand and gravel (lot ΒΔ 240) that covered and continued down into a rectangular pit (lot ΒΔ 241, ca. mid-3rd century). The pyre is later than this fill and therefore not directly as-sociated with the filling of the pit, but its position below disintegrated mud brick suggests that it may be associated with the abandonment of the building. Industrial activity is indicated by a plastered basin in this room, and an iron tool(?) (IL 1916) from fill ΒΔ 240 below the pyre. There was also abundant miltos and lead in the Sullan destruction level higher up in the room (lot ΒΔ 237).Twelve artifacts certainly from the pyre: type 46B lamp, worn resting surface (225–190), type 43B lamp, worn resting surface (225–180), small fragment of covered bowl(?), five fusiform unguentaria (four of category 3 [200–175], one of category 5[?] [180–100]), two rilled-rim plates, miniature two-handled bowl, Figure 20.

(unguentarium probably of category 5, combined with the dates of lamps and wear on their resting surfaces)Classical Commercial BuildingAs so far revealed, the building consists of a row of rooms, side by side, opening westward onto the north–south street that leaves the Agora square along the west end of the Stoa Poikile (Shear 1984, pp. 43–50; Camp 1999, pp. 274–279; 2003, pp. 247–249) (Figs. 22–24). The plan of the southern part of the building is clear (rooms 1–3), the northern part (rooms 4–7[?]) much less so. Excavation is ongoing, so no final study of the structure has been conducted, but it is thought to have been built in the early 4th (Shear 1984, p. 44) or late 5th century (Camp 1999, p. 277). Differences in wall construction in various rooms leave open the possibil-ity that it was built piecemeal (Camp 2003, p. 249), but the chronology of such a process has not yet been explored. In this connection, it might be meaningful that none of the pyres found in situ in the northernmost five rooms date before the middle of the 4th century—though material dispersed over the northern end of the east wall bears witness to an earlier pyre (17a).Ten floors were excavated in the southernmost room (room 1), in-dicating continuous occupation down to the 1st century a.d. No floors dating later than the mid-3rd century have been excavated elsewhere in the building. Twelve pyres have been found in situ, with evidence of at Figure 21. Pyre 3, ca. 175?

In addition, fragments of pyre-type vessels frequently came to light in the stratigraphy. The pyres are spread throughout the use-life of the structure. One (6) dates very early in the building’s history, and can be associated with its construction. The other pyres cannot be associated with major architectural events in the building’s history.There is abundant evidence of industrial activity. Room 1: shallow pits containing iron and bronze slag, patches of pigment on floors, terracotta molds, a Y-shaped drain in the original floor, and, in the 3rd century, marble dust and chips (Shear 1984, p. 45), as well as fragments of lead and pumice in the floor makeup.

The pyre overlaps the footing trench for the south wall. A large disturbance had removed all higher floors in this area. Except for a large and certainly intrusive piece of a 3rd-century plate (cf. Agora XXIX, no. 659), the floor level with the toichobate contains only small chips of pottery, none necessarily later than the 5th century. Although the position of the pyre suggests an association with the earliest floor, the date of the material in the pyre indicates that the pit was dug from a higher level, possibly from floor 8 or 9, at ca. 51.90 and 51.87 masl (late 4th century, lots ΒΕ 805, ΒΕ 806). Otherwise (i.e., if the pyre is contemporary with the floor level in which it was discovered), it would date construction of the south wall of the building after ca. 325, which is contrary to other indications of its date.

The best preserved are two structures (Houses 2, 3) on the brow of the hill, the westernmost of which contained pyre 21.House 3 in Section ΛΛA building conventionally called “House” 3 was located along a cul-de-sac on the northern side of the Kolonos Agoraios, next door to a better-preserved building across a narrow alleyway to its east. Only one corner of one room survives, probably a courtyard (Fig. 50). Evidence for its date comes from two preserved floors, suggesting that the structure was built some time in the 4th century and refurbished in the early 3rd; it may have remained in use until the first quarter of the 2nd century, but the neigh-borhood was deserted thereafter. The area was peppered with industrial installations, including casting pits; industrial activities within the building itself are documented by a plastered tub with a settling basin and plastered areas of floor with tile borders.Figure 49.

The pyre lay below two floors: a lower floor with only six fragments of pottery, not closely datable (strosis 4, lot ΛΛ 34); and an upper floor with pottery largely of the 3rd century, with one moldmade bowl fragment of ca. 200 or later, and some fragments of pyre pots (strosis 3, lot ΛΛ 33). It is not clear from which level the pyre was dug, but it is certainly sealed in by at least the upper floor, if not the lower floor as well. Cross-sections sketched in the notebook show the lower floor in place above the pyre; but the notebook account describes it as partly broken away, and the fact that fragments of pyre pots were found in the makeup of the upper floor suggests that this surface was laid immediately after the pyre had been deposited. The pyre is thus more likely to be associated with a reflooring and perhaps installation of the basins than the original construction, but certainty is impossible. The notebook refers to a second concentration of burning and “identical votive dishes etc.” to the north, and a marginal note seems to suggest joins to material from our pyre (Notebook ΛΛ, p. 625). The size and constitution of the pyre, along with two foci of burning, suggest this assemblage may represent the remnants of two different pyres (cf. 19, 46). There are several disparate pairs, with significant and obvious differences between them: the four chytridia and the four lopadia consist of two pairs of each; the four large saucers are two pairs (two with thin wash, two unglazed); the eight small saucers break down into two groups (four with thin wash, four unglazed); the six ribbon-handled plates fall into three pairs (two pairs of unglazed plates Figure 50. notebook sketch plan of house 3 showing cemented floor and basins, with casting pits to right (west).

Either a later pyre disturbed a slightly earlier one, or two separate pyres were offered at about the same time and buried together.

Pyre 22 was found under a pebble mosaic floor (mosaic A) of a house that faced south onto the southern street. All that remains of this structure are patches of mosaic floor (mosaic A as well as others at higher [B] and lower [C, D] levels, indicating more phases of the house, none of them well dated); and a two-chamber cistern system (C 14:1), one mouth of which was within the area covered by mosaic floor A.

A purported fragment of mosaic floor A was found in well B 13:8, which was filled about 260 (Agora XXXIII, p. 344); if that identification is correct, the house was out of use by that time.22 (C 14:3) Fig. 52Section ΠΘ, 96/ΚΖ, no lot; RSY, 1936.

The building is poorly preserved and has never been thoroughly studied, but additional excavations in 2005–2008 clarified some details of plan and chronology (Whitley et al. 2006, pp. 7–8; Camp 2007, pp. 657–660; Whitley et al. 2007, pp. 3–5, plan, fig. 1). A few white poros limestone blocks on the northwest, southwest, and southeast sides and a substantial cutting back of the slopes of the Kolonos Agoraios give the building’s outline; traces of interior walls and cuttings in bedrock and fill suggest the possible interior arrangements. The building was roughly trapezoidal, with rows of rooms on its northwest-ern and southeastern sides (apparently three on the northwest, four on the southeast), a corridor between them, and a forecourt to the northeast. It was served by a cistern system and a well and drained by five drains leading into the Great Drain to the east (some at least are not part of the original plan). Fill brought in to level the whole area before construction suggests that the building was erected after 440–430 (fill E–F 12–14, Agora XII, p. 389, with red-figure fragments of 440–430; Agora XXX, nos. 317, 325); Camp (2010, p. 51) now places its construction shortly after the middle of the 5th century. Few of the building’s floors are preserved, so almost nothing of its history can be reconstructed. The well in the courtyard, filled with roof tiles and other debris along with early-1st-century pottery, sug-gests that it was destroyed by Sulla (see Agora XXIX, p. 450, under F 13:3).Identification as a public building is suggested by: the building’s location, just 22 m from the Tholos; its large size (26.00 x 20.80 m); and the scale of the project (cutting back of the Kolonos Agoraios and the substantial poros blocks that make up part of the building’s construction). Its tentative identification as the Strategeion is based on the findspots of several inscriptions that were to be set up in front of that building, which suggest that the office of the generals was located somewhere on the west-ern side of the public square (Dinsmoor 1954, p. 296, n. 36; Agora XIV, pp. 73–74; Crosby [1951, pp. 183–187] notes the similarity of the plan to that of the Poros Building and discusses the identification of the two in tandem). A fragment of a marble ship’s eye found in late-5th-century fill under the floor of the building may hint at public use, since an inscription carved a century later documents the transfer of naval equipment to the “Strategeion” (Carlson 2009, pp. 349, 361, no. 3, fig. 3; IG II2 1479, lines 64–67). The presence of the ship’s eye is open to other interpretations as well, however, and cannot be decisive for the identity of the building. Camp has recently pointed out that inscriptions recording the work of the poletai also cluster impressively in this area and has raised the possibility that the building might be their office, the Poleterion (Camp 2007, pp. 658–660).The presence of a pyre within the building argues against a public function at the time of its burial, since these deposits are rigorously absent from known official structures. That other pyres were once present as well is suggested by many fragments of pyre saucers found during recent excavations (e.g., P 35610).

In any event, even if it was not built as a commercial building, there is evidence that it hosted artisans at some point during its history. A pit full of marble chips in the northeastern part of the building, found together with a mason’s lead pencil (IL 2031), shows that marbleworkers were busy here within 50 years of the building’s construction (lots Γ 354, Γ 383, late 5th–early 4th century; Whitley et al. 2007, p. 5; Rotroff 2009, p. 46). The nearby floors that produced the ship’s eye also preserved occasional pieces of possible industrial debris (bone eyelets [BI 1299–BI 1301], two small lead weights [IL 2035, IL 2036], and scraps of iron, bronze, and lead), and a figurine mold (T 861) was found in well F 13:3. The well and the cistern system indicate heavy water requirements, and the large number of drains is unusual and suitable for industrial processes. Their apparent insertion at some point during the life span of the building hints at a possible change of use. An impressive and uniform hoard of Athenian coins of the second half of the 4th century unearthed below the building’s floor (Camp 2007, p. 658, fig. 32; Kroll 2006, pp. 57–58) could point to either public or commercial use.23 (F 13:1) Figs. 53, 54Section Β ́, 69/ΙΖ, no lot; RSY, 1935.

Large numbers of iron hobnails, some bronze tacks, and bone eyelets in three of the floor levels of the court (lots ΜΣ 172–ΜΣ 175) indicate that it was the shop of an artisan, possibly a cobbler, and a heavy concentration of coins in these layers bears witness to commercial activity. The house had gone out of use by the end of the 3rd century (if not before), when the road above the west branch of the Great Drain ran over its northern walls. The single pyre may be associated with abandonment of the house, but displaced pyre vessels in floor levels suggest that pyres were also buried during the life of the house.24 (I 12:3) Figs. 55, 56Section ΜΣ, at east end of Horos Terrace Trench, lot ΜΣ 132, actually at east edge of square H 12; DBT, 1953.

The remains are exiguous and the buildings have not been studied in detail; both their reconstruction and chronology are uncer-tain. In particular, the chronological relationship of walls at the north end of Early Building II and the western end of Early Building I remains obscure.The northern and southern buildings (Early Building I, Building E) were probably built in the 5th century, then rebuilt in the early 4th cen-tury, at which time the western building (Early Building II) was added, encroaching on the west end of Early Building I and sequestering a trap-ezoidal courtlike space between the three structures. The northern and southern buildings went out of use first, while Early Building II probably survived until the Early Roman period. Building E and Early Building II are associated with pyres, and pyre material was found in a well in front of Early Building I.Figure 56. Pyre 24, 325–300?

RotroffThe purpose of these structures has been debated. The plans, insofar as they can be recovered, do not resemble those of private houses. H. A. Thompson suggested that they were public offices (Agora XIV, p. 74), but also admitted the possibility that they were shops, and Langdon sug-gested they housed the poletai (Agora XIX, p. 66). More recently, Camp has urged an early use as offices, perhaps associated with legal affairs, and a later commercial use (Camp 2010, p. 52). The plans of Building E and Early Building II are similar to those of known shop buildings. Industrial installations in Early Building I and modest amounts of workshop debris in Early Building II lend some support to this identification.Building EBuilding E, which forms the southern border of the complex, is an ir-regularly rectangular structure with a plastered courtyard with a well at the west (G 13:4, Thompson 1934, pp. 313–315) and two rooms at the east. It was built in the 5th century and substantially renovated when Early Building II was constructed to its west, perhaps in the early 4th century. The period-of-use fill in the well covers the span ca. 325 to the end of the 3rd century, although most of the material dates before ca. 260; a dumped fill above dates in the first half of the 2nd century (for the dates, see Agora XXII, pp. 107–108; Agora XXIX, p. 453, under G 13:4).

It was built before the middle of the 5th century, then partially dismantled and remodeled ca. 380, at which time two wells in the courtyard south of the building were filled (27, H 13:4). The date of its destruction is uncertain, but a north–south road that crosses the building may go back to the 3rd century, and the building was certainly out of use by the beginning of the second quarter of the 2nd century, when the Middle Stoa was built over its eastern end. Industrial activity is indicated by plastered basins, stone-lined pits, and a pit full of sand at the eastern end of the building, under the west end of the Middle Stoa (visible in Travlos’s 1958 plan of the area, Fig. 58), and by three small ash pits surrounded by fire-hardened soil in the floor of room B. Bronze and clay tokens from well 27 point to official activities (B 2210, MC 1789, MC 1804), but a kiln support(?) (MC 1790) and pigment suggest industry.No pyres have been found within the building, but several characteristic pyre vessels were found in well 27, just to its south.27 (Well H 13:6) Figs. 57, 62Section Γ, H/6,7–13/7,8, lots Γ 430, Γ 431, Γ 458, Γ 459, Γ 462, Γ 464; LG, 2009.

It consisted of two rows of rooms, but it is impossible to reconstruct the plan in detail. Renewed excavation was undertaken recently, but the remains have deteriorated significantly since the first explorations (compare Figs. 58 and 59, drawn in 1958 and 2009, respectively). The southeastern part is clearest, with two approximately square rooms of about the same size (rooms C, D; Fig. 57); their south wall continues far enough toward the west to reconstruct a third room perhaps of similar size and shape beside them. The northwestern part of the building, north of the median wall, was partially destroyed by the later course of the Great Drain. What is preserved indicates perhaps a court or open space at the northern corner (room B), with a smaller room beside it (room A). Farther to the west (room E) the plan is obscured by the addition of a tile-chip mosaic floor bordered by drains (a washing platform or perhaps a latrine) in a later phase of the building (after 86?), over what may have been another room in the northwestern series in the first phase. Published plans (e.g., Agora XIV, pl. 6) show the building continuing farther to the southwest, on the basis of wall fragments that may represent the continuation of the median wall, and a series of blocks on the line of its northwest, street wall. A jog in the southeast wall, however, suggests that walls farther to the west may belong to a different structure. Whatever the plan, the walls are remarkably thick given the small size of the rooms.The structure was probably built in the early 4th century, at the same time that Building E and Early Building I were reconstructed; how it relates to Early Building I at its northern end is unclear. Some of its walls encroached on the area of the western room of Early Building I, the western wall of which lay under a fill of the late 5th–early 4th century, demonstrating that it was abandoned in the reconstruction. The 3rd-century pyre 30 was found in a fill that covered the southeast and southwest walls of room A of Early Building II, so the northern part of that building must have been abandoned by then (Fig. 65). Further complicating the picture is the fact Figure 62. Pyre vessels from well 27, 400–380. P 36000 (chytridion), P 35994 (saucer), P 36002 (skyphos).

Large amounts of pottery over the floors and walls suggest a final destruction no later than the Augustan period (lots Ζ 855–Ζ 862).The building’s contents provide few clues to its function. In the poorly preserved southwestern area, beyond the rooms that can be assigned to the building with confidence, D. B. Thompson excavated a floor covered with enough marble chips to make her suspect the presence of marbleworkers, but at a date previous to the building (lot Ζ 843, 5th century). Finds from the floors of the building (mostly from rooms A and C) are ambiguous. Consistent with workshop activity are: small amounts of marble and lime-stone chips here and there, but nowhere in quantity; a few bone eyelets (BI 1318, BI 1320, BI 1332) similar to those that occurred in large numbers in the House of Simon; and bone and bronze tools (B 2195, BI 1319). Clay and lead tokens (MC 1769, IL 2052), however, bespeak official operations. A miscellany of lead weights of different types (IL 2023, IL 2041, IL 2042, IL 2054) is consistent with industrial, commercial, or official use.Three pyres have been found in the building: two in room E, one in room A.28 (G 13:14) Figs. 57, 63Section Γ, G/11,12–13/8,9, at 57.88–58.28 masl, lot Γ 448; LG, 2008.

A lopadion, ribbon-handled plates, pyre saucers, and tiny fragments of a pyre lekanis suggest that much of this material comes from a pyre. Other objects, however, are of types otherwise unknown in pyres: a tiny miniature plate, an unusual two-handled plate with a central recipient (like that on a kernos) and made of a pale yellow, non-Attic clay, a clay button/bead, and loomweights. A possible parallel for the kernos/plate was found in one of the Ambracian pyres (Andreou and Andreou 2000, pl. 150:β, lower left), another in an Athenian grave (Kapetanaki 1973, p. 278, no. 1, fig. 4:α). As far as one can tell from the coordinates (recorded in two different systems), pyres 28 (excavated in 2008) and 29 (excavated in 1933) are in about the same location (though the elevation of the latter cannot be determined), and it is possible that they are somehow related. No bone was recorded. A bowl containing pigment was found in the same layer.Figure 63. Pyre 28, 375–350. Back row: P 35722 (plate), P 35731 (lopa-dion).

The fragmentary state of some of the pottery in the pyre suggests some disturbance.

It consists of a large courtyard and two rows of square rooms on either side of an unroofed corridor. Four rooms at the northeast (the “annex”), which have a different orientation, may belong, or may be part of a different building (Crosby 1951, p. 170).Built around the middle of the 5th century, the building was badly damaged at the end of the century. Heavy deposits of marble chips and dust show that marbleworkers subsequently occupied the northwest room and northern corridor and the annex (which shows no sign of a late-5th-century destruction). The building was remodeled in the 4th century (after about 350?), and it is perhaps at that time that a pebble mosaic was laid, traces of which were found here and there throughout the building. Later floors are largely lacking, and the history of the building cannot be traced through the Hellenistic period. Evidence for marbleworking, however, does not continue past the 4th century. The building was destroyed in the 1st century, probably by Sulla, and not rebuilt.The Poros Building has generally been taken for a public building on the basis of its size and the eponymous blocks—more monumental, it is thought, than would be likely in a private structure.

None of these identifications is convincing, although the last (with the sensational name “Prison of Socrates”) has gained currency. For a variety of reasons, however, it should be abandoned. At the time of Socrates’ execu-tion, the building was occupied by marbleworkers; thus any descriptions of the prison in Plato’s Phaedo are irrelevant to this particular structure. Wherever Socrates died, it was not here, and the much later statuette identified as Socrates and found in the ruins is there by chance, not as a commemoration of his death place. The medicine pots that Vanderpool saw as hemlock containers date in the 3rd century (Agora XXIX, p. 198) and are more likely to have held an ointment or liquid than a dry prepara-tion. For additional critique of the identification, see Koumanoudes 1984, Hunter 1997, and Hall 2013.Two certain pyres were found in the Poros Building and two more probable or possible ones; they cluster in the northwestern part of the structure. At the time they were buried the building was functioning as a workshop, and, in view of the plans of other industrial and commercial buildings around the public square, it is possible that this was its function from the beginning (Rotroff 2009, pp. 44–45). Iron slag in the destruction debris in the northeastern part of the building (Crosby 1951, p. 183) bears witness to ironworking here in the later Hellenistic period.31 (D 17:7) Figs. 67, 68Section ΟΟ, 58/ΛΑ, no lot; MC, 1949.

The fill topped by roof tiles represents tile fall from the late-5th-century destruction of the building, which, if the pyre was found more or less in situ, was in the past by the time the pyre was burnt. It is probably too early to be associated with the laying of the pebble mosaic, but rather was disturbed when the mosaic was laid.

The pyre thus postdates the arrival of the marblework-ers, and may be associated with the 4th-century reconstruction of the building. It contained scattered carbon and there was a heavy ash deposit in the chytridion. Some of the pottery is burnt; there were also fragments of burnt mud brick or clay.

The pyre postdates the 4th-century reconstruction of the Poros Building. Clay balls like the ones found here have come to light in two other pyres (4, 12), but this assemblage lacks most characteristic pyre objects, and its skyphos is full-size (rare but not unknown in pyres).

Concentration of artifacts, ash, carbon, and a few bones in stratum, no pit discerned. The contents rested on or above a layer that is said to be at about the same level as the pebble mosaic floor, and thus the pyre probably postdates the laying of that floor. It was probably burnt in situ, though it is badly disturbed. The concentration of burning, burnt bone, and pottery suggests a pyre. That is how the excavator interpreted it in the notebook, and the lamp and angular kantharos represent two-thirds of the classic pyre assemblage of the mid-3rd century. The lamp is moldmade, however, and may be significantly later than the kantharos, which cannot date much later than the middle of the 3rd century. Moldmade lamps were probably introduced around 250, but type 42D is not one of the earliest. No lamps of this type have been inventoried from deposits laid down before ca. 200 (though uninventoried fragments may exist in the lots). Howland suggests, however, that type 42D was contemporary with type 42C, with which it shares technical details (Agora IV, p. 132). If this is correct, it may have been introduced earlier, perhaps in the third quarter of the 3rd century, and it is just possible that the lamp and the kantharos were in use at the same time. The coin is much earlier, but bronze coins often circulated for some time.Four artifacts: type 42D lamp (Agora IV, no. 537, dating uncertain), small Hel-lenistic angular kantharos, fresh resting surface (ca. 250, cf.

It lay on the west side of the Street of the Marble Workers, across from the Poros Building. Its western side was completely obliterated by Roman construction; all that remains are the two rooms that form the east side of the building, part of a courtyard, and a freestanding shed on the north side of that court. The structure may have been built in the 5th century and seems to have functioned throughout the 4th century; it was also occupied in the Hellenistic period (Young 1951a, pp. 234–236).Figure 72.

The pyre was found in digging layer 7 (lot ΝΝ 868), probably the floor associated with the second phase of the house. The stratigraphy above it was disturbed, and the pit may have been dug from a higher level. Disturbance is attested by the absence of a lekanis and lopadia to go with lids, as well as fragments of more pyre vessels, perhaps from this pyre, dispersed in layers 7 (lot ΝΝ 868, fragments of three rilled-rim plates and at least four small saucers), 6 (lot ΝΝ 867, fragments of rilled-rim plate and small saucer) and 5 (lot ΝΝ 866, lamp L 4440, fragments of three ribbon-handled plates, one large saucer with convex rim). Except for L 4440, these are not included in the list of objects below. Chronologically the pyre belongs within the second phase of the house. Young conjectured, however, that the pyre had been dug from the level of layer 6 (which was not present above the pyre), a layer that ran over the foundation of the wall between rooms 2 and 5 and therefore should date after the abandonment of the house (Young 1951b, p. 116). An abandonment date as early as 375 seems unlikely, however; the presence of pyre material in up-per levels is probably to be explained by later disturbance. A lead defixio (IL 997, Curbera and Jordan 1998) was found in the postdestruction debris in this room, along with some fragments of pyre material (layer 4, lot ΝΝ 534; Young 1951a, pp. 222–223). It is possible that the curse had originally been deposited in this pyre (cf. Jordan and Rotroff 1999). The hard red earth under the pyre indicates that it was burnt in situ, but a few centimeters of earth between the floor of the pit and the vessels suggests vessels were cleaned out and then thrown back in.Nineteen artifacts: type 24C lamp (Agora IV, no. 257, 400–375, from layer 5, above pyre), Corinthian skyphos (ca. 390, slightly later than Agora XII, no. 322), small bolsal (400–390, cf.

Excavation recovered its complete plan, consisting of a series of rooms arranged around a courtyard and entered from the west (the Street of the Marble Workers). It was built in the 5th century, prob-ably before its middle, then remodeled when the Great Drain was built to its east, in the early 4th century. During this second phase, a door was cut connecting House C with House D to the north. A second remodeling took place shortly after the middle of the 4th century. Young regarded the pyres that were burnt in situ in the main part of the house (43, 44, 46) as evidence for its abandonment, which he therefore dated “some time in the second half of the fourth century” (Young 1951a, p. 224) or “by the end of the century” (Young 1951b, p. 113). Pyres 44 and 46 were dug through layers that passed over interior walls of the house—probably an indication of abandonment, but a remodeling is also possible, and seems to be indi-cated by a floor over pyre 44. Whether abandonment or remodeling, the event dated no later than ca. 315, when the earlier of the two was buried.The house fell into ruin in the course of the 3rd century. Reexamination of pottery from the trenches above the south wall of the court and the south wall of the house, which Young had dated in the “first part of the 3rd cen- tury” (Young 1951a, p. 225), revealed fragments dating as late as the last quarter of the 3rd century: from lot ΝΝ 558, a rim fragment of a West Slope baggy kantharos (cf. Agora XXIX, no. 234); from lot ΝΝ 570, two fragments of an early floral moldmade bowl (cf. Agora XXII, p. 50, no. 49, pls. 8, 73). Red layers immediately above the floors of the house, some of them composed of decayed mud brick, contained pottery mostly from the 4th century, but characteristic 3rd-century material also occurs (e.g., moldmade bowls, West Slope kantharoi and hemispherical cups, dating as late as the end of the century), sometimes along with one or two later Hellenistic or Early Roman pieces in their upper parts (mudbrick layers: lots ΝΝ 506, ΝΝ 518–ΝΝ 520, ΝΝ 563; layers immediately over floor: ΝΝ 502, ΝΝ 507, ΝΝ 521, ΝΝ 534, ΝΝ 557). Some sort of subsequent use of the area is indicated by the well in the courtyard (B 19:9), which remained open throughout the Hellenistic period, to be filled with what may be Sul-lan destruction debris (very fragmentary) around 50.tabLe 10. buILDIng Phases oF house CPhaseDate of PhaseCommentsPyre (Date)Phase 1Before mid-5th century to beginning of 4th century––Phase 2Beginning of 4th century to shortly after mid-4th century or slightly laterConnected to House D42 (385–375)Phase 3Shortly after mid-4th century or slightly later to later 4th century–43 (340–325)Abandonment/ remodelingCa. 315 or later–44 (ca. 315)45(?)

A well in the room also contained fragments of pottery dating as late as the first quarter of the 2nd century (lot ΝΝ 500).Pyre 42 was buried during phase 2 of the house, though it was dispersed in the course of later building activities; if the initial date of this phase can be stretched somewhat later than the estimated early 4th century, the pyre might be associated with the reconstruction itself. Pyre 43 falls within the third phase of occupation, or conceivably just after its abandonment, if the third phase was a short one. Pyres 44–46 date late in the history of the house, though at a time when the area was still in use (though possibly ruinous).

This layer and the one below it (lot ΝΝ 593) run over the wall between rooms 9 and 10, so either they postdate the destruction of the house or indicate yet another change in its plan. In either case, the trodden surface suggests that the area continued to be used. The tile layer dates to the early 3rd century or slightly later (two Classical kantharoi with flaring handle spurs, one possible Hellenistic baggy kantharos fragment). The pyre, however, is contemporary with the second phase of the house, and, if the beginning of the phase could be downdated a bit, could be connected with this reconstruction. However that may be, it was subsequently disturbed and some of the objects tossed into later floor makeup/debris. Some of the pottery shows signs of burning.

The date of the pyre, however, probably not later than 325, requires either that the house was abandoned rather shortly after the initiation of the third phase, or, more likely, that the pyre was buried during the span of phase 3.

Layer 4, however, appeared to be a deliberate clay floor (in Young’s estimation), suggesting continued occupation, with the pyre associated with floor renewal.

The pyre may be associated with the abandonment of this part of the house. The lack of a hard reddened surface in the pit suggests that it was not burnt in situ. Young interpreted the deposit as a rubbish dump rather than a pyre because of the dispersed pattern of burning and the presence of what he identified as chicken bones. It is also true that some of the objects are of types not, or only rarely, found in Agora pyres (echinus bowl, saltcellar, squat lekythoi, thymiaterion, button). The wear on the resting surfaces of the cups is also unusual. The combination of chytridia and cups suggests, however, that it is a pyre. Lekythoi, though rare, do occur in pyres (see 6, 38, 42), as do coins (see 2, 3, 5, 15, 18, 34[?], 44, 58, 62), and, in one other instance, a thymiaterion (12).Seventeen artifacts: cup-kantharos, worn resting surface (Agora XXIX, no. 54, 315–300), Classical kantharos, slightly worn resting surface (325–300, cf.

Layer 4 ran over the foundation of the wall between rooms 5 and 6 (see 44); a layer of decayed mud brick covered layer 4 (lot ΝΝ 520). The pyre seems to have been dug into layer 4, which was then patched and continued in use. A new floor was not laid, however, so the pyre may have been buried between the abandonment of the house and its collapse. Reddening of the floor of the pit indicates burning in situ. Young recorded that “the pots at the east side of the cutting lie about 0.10 m higher than those at the W.

It lay ca. 0.15 m below the level of a terrazzo floor in this room, associated with phase 3, but no floor levels were preserved over the pyre. Room 12 is thought to have continued in use after the rest of the house was abandoned. On the basis of an east–west cutting through the mosaic floor, which he read as evidence of a new south wall, Young concluded that the size of the room had been drastically reduced and that the pyre lay outside the area of continued use (Young 1951a, p. 226). Whether or not this is correct, the pyre predates the fill of the cistern in the room (B 18:13, where the lower fill, possibly from its time of use, dates 250–190), and it is therefore contemporary with continued activity there.

Its western part was destroyed by later structures and little of the plan can be recovered. The house was built around 470–460; the possible pyre 48 was buried during its first phase. A remodeling took place in the early 4th century, when the Great Drain was built to the east. At this time the house was extended eastward, and a new east–west wall probably divided the house in two. Pyre 49 belongs to this second phase and is located in the southern house. Young took this pyre as evidence of the abandonment of the house “by some time in the third quarter of the [4th] century” (Young 1951b, p. 113). There is no other evidence on this point, but the house was being dismantled by the end of the 3rd century. Robbed wall trenches contain pottery chiefly of the 3rd century, with the latest sherds dating around 200 or a little later (lots ΝΝ 571–ΝΝ 573), and a patch of decayed mud brick found over the northern part of the house (lot ΝΝ 598) included about 15 3rd-century pieces (dating down to the third quarter of the century) and a beveled bowl of ca. 175 (cf.

Pottery, a little burnt bone, and patches of charcoal in shallow, roughly rectangular pit in stratigraphic sequence. The pyre was located near the north side of Piraeus Street, west of the bridge over the Great Drain. It was uncovered in digging a thin layer rich in marble chips (layer 7, lot ΠΠ 246, 0.04 m thick, 3rd century, with fragment of moldmade bowl), and had been dug into another similar level (layer 8, lot ΠΠ 247, 0.02–0.03 m thick, to mid-4th century with intrusive long-petal bowl fragment). Cinders were found spread through layer 7 beyond the shallow pit, demonstrating that they were somewhat dispersed before the pit was covered over by that layer. The excavator interpreted the successive thin layers of marble chips here as road-building material. Possibly, however, marbleworking took place just outside a house to the north, against the wall of which these layers run. Other indications of industrial activity include a fragment of a mold for a terracotta figurine in layer 7 (uninventoried, in lot ΠΠ 246) and a piece of metal slag and an abraded amphora handle that had been used for polishing in layer 8 (P 34759). A pit, possibly for a small pithos or a lekane, was found nearby, and had been filled when layer 8 was laid. It is noteworthy that the location is close to the point where two thoroughfares cross, a place where objects associated with purification rituals were frequently discarded (Parker 1983, p. 229; Johnston 1991).

B. Thompson immediately after the end of the season (D. B. Thompson 1958; see also Thompson 1959, pp. 99–102, pls. 16, 17), revised to take changes in coin and ceramic chronology into consideration. The house, in the northeast corner of a block of several dwellings, was originally built in the 6th century (phase 1) and destroyed by the Persians (Fig. 105, Table 12). After a period of abandonment, it was rebuilt on approximately the same plan around the middle of the 5th cen- tury (phase 2). It was remodeled in the first half of the 4th century (phase 3) and subsequently underwent minor changes throughout the century. Pottery in the earth above the latest floor in the south central room dates around the middle of the 3rd century, showing that the house had been abandoned by then. Industrial activity is indicated by installations in the court of the house (two pithoi and a plastered floor). Large numbers of coins found in the south central room hint at commercial activity here throughout the 4th century. Over 30 were recorded in stroseis 5–9 there, including a silver tetradrachm from the same strosis in which pyre 58 was found (Φ-389, Agora XXVI, no. 15a, 390–295).Figure 104. Pyre 55, 315–260.

The pyre is approximately contemporary with the renovation of the house that initiated phase 3 in the first half of the 4th cen- tury, so it could be associated with that event.

The pyre is substantially later, however, and must have been dug down into strosis 9, although no pit was detected by the excavator. The alternative is to downdate the floor, which is difficult to reconcile with the other stratigraphy in the house. The date of the pyre indicates that it could be as-sociated with the abandonment of the house, which took place in the first half of the 3rd century. The pottery shows signs of burning.

The area had been overbuilt by a Late Roman villa, leaving only scraps of walls and floors of the earlier structures intact. What remains attests to a larger and well-appointed central house flanked by two smaller dwellings. Single pyres were found in situ in the central and eastern houses (60, 62), with a concentration of displaced pyre vessels in the eastern house attesting to a second pyre there (61). Considerable remains of a dispersed pyre came to light in and beyond the eastern part of the western house (59). Scattered instances of pyre vessels suggest that more pyres were once present in these houses.Western HouseThe westernmost of the houses in section Ω is of irregular plan, with a court and several rooms. Preliminary analysis (Shear 1973a, 147–150) sug-gests that the house was built in the early 5th century, partially destroyed by the Persians and rebuilt, then substantially remodeled at the end of the 5th century. Some partition walls were rearranged in the second quarter of the 4th century and the floors raised in the third quarter.

Pyre pots in very fragmentary condition were noticed by Barbara Tsakirgis in later analysis of pottery that had been excavated in 1938; no mention of them was made at the time of excavation. The fill in which they were found lies partly over the continuation of the eastern wall of the house. Another group of pyre pots excavated in 1969 immediately to the east is probably part of the same disturbed group(s). It is likely that more than one pyre is involved: the two rilled-rim plates do not match and there are three lekanis lids (rarely does a pyre contain more than two lekanides). If originally associated with this house, the pyre(s) could be related to the 4th-century remodeling.

In his preliminary report, Shear (1973a, pp. 150–151) suggests that it was built in the second quarter of the 5th century and remodeled in the last quarter of the 4th century. The only evidence for the date of the remodeling is a small deposit of pottery outside the north end of the east wall of the building (Q 20:5; Shear 1973a, p. 151, n. 67), now probably to be dated ca. 300. This deposit has been interpreted as a foundation deposit (Müller-Zeis 1994, pp. 56, 96, no. 37; Weikart 2002, pp. 91, 174–175, no. V 6 a), although the excavation account is laconic and does not describe the relationship of the pottery to the wall in any detail. The deposit includes one complete vessel (a small Attic skyphos) and a small collection of fragmentary pottery ranging in date over a century. No bone or burning was reported, and the deposit does not resemble a saucer pyre, but if it is in some way connected with the remodeling, the second phase of the house must have begun around 300. The later history of the house cannot be reconstructed. One pyre (62) lay in place in a small room on the western side of the house; traces of another, earlier one (61) were found dispersed nearby, in the area of the court. Pyre 61 was buried during the first phase of the house; 62 could have coincided with the renovation that inaugurated its second phase.61 (Q 20:6) Figs. 109, 113Section Ω, lot Ω 456; JMC, 1971.

Their remains, discovered under the floors of a Roman street stoa that was built about a.d. 100, were best preserved in their eastern part (Shear 1975, pp. 346–361). Traces of walls suggest a three-room building at the west. It may be part of another complex yet farther west, under the Roman Library of Pantainos (for a possible reconstruction, see the plan in Lawall 2000, p. 6, fig. 2), but nothing of its history has been traced and its function cannot at this point be documented. The plans and history of two more buildings to the east, however, can be reconstructed in some detail. In both the plan consists of pairs of rooms placed side by side along the street onto Figure 118. Pyre 66, 270–260. P 13371 (plate), P 13372 (skyphos), L 3502 (lamp). Scale 1:4Figure 119.

The smaller, easternmost building was erected first, between 430 and 420, with at least five rooms (the easternmost part is poorly preserved). The central building, to its west, was added before the end of the century, at which time the two were apparently part of a single complex (though this would change over time). The central building was larger, with two pairs of small rooms and one pair of larger ones, which were further subdivided during some phases. One of the larger spaces had a well in the earlier phases of the building (well 68, filled in ca. 380, at the end of the third phase of the complex) and was perhaps a courtyard. The two buildings went through several reconstructions, the last in the middle of the 3rd century (about contemporary with 69), when pebble and mortar floors were inserted into three of the rooms. This floor level was maintained until the destruction of the building in the Sullan sack of 86.The fill of well 68 (Shear 1975, pp. 356–361) bears witness to some of the activities that occurred here in the early 4th century. It included debris from a tavern, a wine shop, a butcher shop, and from the workshops of horn- and boneworkers and a coroplast. Concentrations of perfume vessels in the fills of wells and cisterns farther west suggest that the area was used by perfume sellers and/or makers from the early 5th to the 2nd century (Agora XXXIII, pp. 139–140). This area was also a venue for wine selling in the late 5th and early 4th centuries, as well as later, judging from the large numbers of wine amphoras with commercial graffiti found here (Lawall 2000).All pyres associated with these buildings are disturbed. Pyre 67 was located in the western part of the poorly preserved westernmost building. Pyre 69, though displaced in Late Hellenistic times, was found in one of the southern rooms of the eastern building, at about the level of the mid-3rd-century floors, with which it is contemporary. A single chytridion (P 29943) found over bedrock in the area of the easternmost room, and mistaken at the time of excavation for a Roman jug, probably bears witness to a 4th-century pyre. In addition, pottery of pyre types was found in the dumped debris in well 68 in the central building.67 (R 13:7) Fig. 120Section Ι, lot Ι 189c; HSR, 1947.

A few vessels of characteristic pyre types were found in the fill of the well, which was 17.42 m deep and con-tained over 500 inventoried objects, as well as thousands of uninventoried ones. A deposit of mud brick in the lower part of the well probably derives from the construction of the building at the beginning of the 4th century; shortly thereafter the well was put out of use by a collapse of the bedrock. Over the ensuing decade or so it served as a dump, containing material ranging from the last quarter of the 5th century to the first two decades of the 4th. The absence of rouletted decoration on the pottery gives a terminal date no later than ca. 380 (Shear 1975, p. 361). Either the pyre objects come from one or more displaced pyres, or they were part of the inventory of a potter’s shop in the immediate area.

Within an archaeological context, wood charcoal is a macro remain associated with human activities (fire building, construction, etc.). The study of wood charcoal recovered in excavations is making a growing contribution to the reconstruction of past environments surrounding the sites and the use of timber.1The observation unit for charcoal analysis is any single wood-charcoal fragment. The first step of the analysis, before results and interpretation are gained, is the identification of wood charcoal recovered during excavation. Anatomical identification of wood is based on the unique structure of basic elements, which varies between families, genera, and even species.2 Wood charcoal preserves the anatomy of wood, and the basic elements can be observed in three anatomical sections—transversal, longitudinal tangential, and longitudinal radial—thus offering the possibility of identification to genus and, in some cases, species level.3 Wood-charcoal samples from the Agora pyres were processed for charcoal analysis in order to gain infor-mation about the firewood used in private rituals identified in houses and workshops of the Agora area.Samples from a total of eight pyres were analyzed at the Wiener Lab- oratory of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens under an incident light microscope with dark/bright field and 50x to 500x magnifica-tion lenses. Qualitative and quantitative results for each pyre are presented in Table 15.As can be observed there, some of the samples included various charcoal fragments, while only a single fragment was present in others. Qualitatively, the samples overall show the presence of five taxa in total, a number that when compared to the total number of fragments analyzed (130) would characterize the plant list as rich. A closer look at the individual assem-blages of each pyre, however, shows that in no instance are more than two taxa represented. 1. Chabal 1997; Chabal et al. 1999.2. Schweingruber 1990.3. Chabal et al. 1999."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"appendix i184The taxa identified are, in alphabetical order: cf. Arbutus sp. (strawberry tree), Maloideae-Pyrus/Sorbus (pear/serbal), Olea europaea (olive tree), Quercus evergreen type (holm and/or kermes oak), and cf. Vitis vinifera (grapevine). In the case of cf. Arbutus sp. there is only one fragment, which is very small. Although it presents the anatomical characteristics of the genus, there is still some doubt concerning the identification, given that the scalariform perforations occasionally seen in the longitudinal radial section were not observed in the specimen from the Agora. In the case of Maloideae we have used the generic subfamily name with the indication that the wood-charcoal fragments analyzed might belong to the Pyrus/Sorbus genera, which, among other genera of the same subfamily, most frequently present biseriate rays in the longitudinal tangential section. However, the generic Maloideae is preferable in cases where the wood-charcoal material is not abundant and therefore observation is limited. In the case of Quercus evergreen type, the taxon includes all the evergreen species, since for the Quercus genus a distinction can be made only between evergreen and deciduous types, each of which includes various species. For cf. Vitis vinifera, the fragment was very fine and small, and the large vessels were obstructed by fine sediment or ash, which made observation difficult. Basic anatomical elements such as scalariform perforations and/or perforation plates were observed, but for the reasons mentioned above we still maintain a degree of doubt.The results of this analysis contribute to the assessment of two topics: the provisioning of firewood and the selection of fuel for ritual purposes. First, it is worth mentioning that all the taxa represented are common in the Greek landscape; they are major components of the natural vegetation of the thermomediterranean bioclimatic zone in which the region of Attica is located.4 Therefore, it is likely that the provisioning areas for firewood were the surroundings of the city of Athens, either olive groves or plots of woodland and maquis regulated and managed for firewood. It is pos-sible that Attica was self-supporting in fuel, as there is no mention of fuel famine in the sources.5 The Athenian lowlands would have been widely cultivated to support the increasing population, especially from the Archaic 4.

Evergreen oak, strawberry tree, and wild pear logs, together with abundant pruning from olive groves and vineyards, would have found their way to the city. There may be a very brief reference to the firewood trade in a speech attributed to Demosthenes (42.7) in which, according to Meiggs,6 Phainippos, the owner of a marginal estate (eschatia), appears to be transporting and selling firewood to Athens.The analysis indicates that in most cases people used olive wood for the fire of the pyre ritual. In some of the pyres, together with olive wood there is evidence for the use of strawberry tree, grapevine, and wood of the Maloideae subfamily, probably the pear tree. Other pyres attest to the use of firewood from any of the evergreen oak species (Quercus ilex, Quercus coccifera), which grow in all lowland Greek landscapes. In all assemblages for which relative frequencies have been calculated, the dominance of Olea europaea, the olive tree, is striking (Fig. 124). This is not unexpected, given the nature of the pyres, which corresponds to single, instantaneous burning events. Hearths, pyres, funerary fires, and other closed burning contexts usually show an overrepresentation of a single taxon because they probably preserve the carbonized firewood remains of the last, or the last few, burning events.7If, as seems certain, the cultivation of olive trees was a major agricul-tural activity, a great part of the firewood stock of Athenian households and workshops would have been provided by olive groves and the care or treatment of the trees in them (e.g., pruning). Olives and olive oil would have been among the most important products of ancient Attica, and by the Archaic period, the area would already have had more olive trees than needed for home consumption. This we might deduce from a decision made by Solon, who, in order to protect essential food supplies, banned the export of all the products of the land except oil (Plut. Sol. 24.1).8 Ol-ive trees were protected and considered sacred, and any attempt to clear away a tree or even an olive stump would have been punished with exile 6. Meiggs 1982, pp. 205–206.7.

Therefore, olive trees would have been abundant in the landscape of Attica, and the demand for wood and charcoal for cooking and heating at Athens would have been met in great part by Athenian farmers and the by-products of their olive groves. The use of prunings for firewood is a common practice in Mediterranean agriculture-based environments today, and this has probably been the case since the time of the first well-documented olive cultivation, the Late Bronze Age.Yet the Agora pyres are associated with private rituals, and it is possible that the use of olive wood was influenced by factors beyond mere practicality. Herodotos (5.82) describes the unique qualities of the Athenian olive trees, the wood of which, on account of its sanctity, was chosen by the people of Epidauros for carving the statues of the fertility goddesses Damia and Auxesia. The ancient image of Athena Polias on the Acropolis was made of olive wood,9 and Lysias’s reference (Lys. 7.5, 7) to sacred olive trees may be significant with respect to the pyres. For the Agora pyres we cannot exclude the possibility of a preference for olive wood for reasons related to its history, its links with the city’s history, and/or the attribution to the wood of particular qualities associated with well-being and prosperity. These postulated motivations are difficult to confirm without support from written sources, but there might be symbolic and ideological connotations in both the pyre ritual and its components, for which the archaeological record basically consists of pottery, animal bones, and the remains of firewood.9.

Most date to the late 4th or early 3rd century, but a few Archaic, earlier Classical, and Hellenistic examples have also been found. There is usually one deposit per house, and the deposits lie under the earliest floor. The offerings are mostly miniatures, imitating a wide variety of domestic objects: cups, kraters, jugs, amphoras, plates, bowls, footed bowls, lamps, mortars, trays. There are also sometimes figurines of humans, animals, and furniture. The excava-tors interpret the deposits as building or foundation deposits.The Ambracia deposits resemble Athenian pyres in deposition under a floor, the presence of bones and burning, and the inclusion of miniatures, though the types of miniatures are different and far more varied than those of Athenian pyres. The occurrence of a single pyre per house, under the lowest floor, also suggests a different purpose.2.

One, of the second half of the 5th century, included miniature jugs, hydriai, a krateriskos, a footed bowl, a lamp, and a miniature wine press. The other, Hellenistic in date, had 39 miniature vessels: cups, one-handled bowls, plates. The deposits have been interpreted as building offerings.

They await full study, but have been collected and discussed in considerable detail by Nina Mekacher in the context of her publication of the terracotta figurines from the Swiss excavations at the site. Metzger (1978b, pp. 86–87) connects the largest of them with the celebration of the Anthesteria, a hypothesis that finds no support in the material evidence (Themelis 1983, pp. 342–343; Gex 2003, pp. 120–121; Mekacher 2003, p. 75). Other explanations include infant burials (Metzger 1978a, p. 4; Kalligas 1983, p. 115) or offerings from a small shrine (ArchDelt 24, B ́1, 1969, p. 197; Themelis 1974, pp. 40–41).Mekacher divides the deposits into two groups: (1) three large deposits, ash layers covering as much as two square meters, with animal bone, pottery, lamps, and terracotta figures (Mekacher 2003, p. 72, G1–G3); (2) eight smaller deposits characterized as small pits, pockets, or lenses of burning (pp. 72–73, K1–K8), which are more closely similar to the Agora pyres. Seven of the small pyres are spread through various residential quarters, while the eighth is located in a necropolis just outside the walls. The contents include charcoal, burnt fruits and seeds, and calcined bone (birds and an adult human tooth have been identified). Most contained mul-tiple terracotta figurines, usually of girls and boys; some also contained pottery of various shapes (cups, lekythoi, unguentaria), as well as astragaloi. Of those clearly dated, one belongs in the third quarter of the 5th century, the others at the turn from the 4th to the 3rd century. In light of the figurines, Mekacher suggests that the small deposits represent offerings associated with children. She interprets the large deposits, which contain large numbers of mammal bones and table wares, as the refuse of ritual meals; the figurine types present (siren, mourning woman, pomegranate, eggs) suggest a connection with funerary cult.4. Euboia, Dragon House on Mt. OchiMoutsopoulos 1992, p. 50, fig. 9.At least six one-handled cups were found under the disturbed pavement of a “dragon house,” a small and remote stone structure of uncertain purpose. Moutso- poulos believes the deposit was placed there at the time of the undated first de-struction of the flooring of the building.5. NemeaMiller 1975, pp. 148–149, pl. 33:a, b, d, e.An area measuring 0.50 x 1.00 m of bones, ash, and pottery was found during cleaning in the southeast corner of the “Xenon,” a building of unknown purpose in the sanctuary of Zeus. The location, in a sacred precinct, puts the deposit outside the parameters of this appendix, but I include it in consideration of the unknown and possibly residential function of the building in which it was found. The deposit is cut by the south wall of the building and therefore predates it; it has been interpreted as a building deposit by Müller-Zeis (1994, p. 102, no. 79). Of 50 inventoried objects, a full-size skyphos and one-handler, four small bowls, 37 miniature cups, and two small figurines are illustrated. The deposit also included a coin and a fragmentary strigil. It is similar to Attic pyres in the presence of bone and ash, the combination of full-size drinking cups with miniatures, and the inclu-sion of a coin.

The vessels were neatly placed, upside down, in two corners of the room: 21 in the southeast corner and 14 in the southwest corner. The report makes no mention of burning or bone. The vessels are mostly of normal size or small, but not miniature. Shapes include a skyphos, one-handlers, saltcellars, a broad-based bowl, a rilled-rim plate, a pyxis lid, duck askoi, and lamps. Most vessels date in the third quarter of the 4th century, but a lamp is considerably earlier.
