After publishing my first book, The Astrologers and Their Creed (London: Hutchinson, 1969), I was looking for another subject within the study of western esotericism—a field that was then in its early infancy and still largely outside the academic pale. Within the recent history of esotericism Eliphas Lévi (alias Alphonse-Louis Constant) was an important name. A few decades after his death he was enough of a legend to get a lengthy mention in Somerset Maugham’s novel The Magician (1908) and a briefer one in H.P. Lovecraft’s novella The Case of Charles Dexter Ward (written in 1927, first published in 1941), where he is referred to as “that cryptic soul who crept through a crack in the hidden door and glimpsed the frightful vistas of the void beyond” (op. cit., Part III, Ch. 6). Yet very little had been published in English about Lévi’s life and work. It seemed to me that the time had come to fill the gap with a proper study of Lévi. The natural publisher was Rider, then part of the Hutchinson group, especially as Lévi’s own works had appeared in English under that imprint. My friend and editor at Hutchinson, Dr. Daniel Brostoff, who was then in charge of Rider, was receptive to the idea but suggested that I extend the scope somewhat to include the wider occult revival in France, of which Lévi was part. I followed his suggestion accordingly, and when I began my research for the book I soon realized what an immensely rich subject I was dealing with.Various countries have had their esoteric heydays, but the one that took place in France between approximately the late 18th century and the early 20th was one of the most fruitful. At its beginning stood a remarkable constellation of esoteric Freemasons, illuminati, mystics, alchemists, and ritual magicians, from whose milieu came movements such as Martinism. Their successors in the 19th century, apart from Lévi himself, included the occultist Papus (alias Dr. Gérard Encausse), whose influence stretched as far 33684 Levi FM.indd 91/10/11 9:57 AM"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"as the court of St. Petersburg, the counter-Pope Eugène Vintras, and the colourful Rosicrucian magus Joséphin Péladan, organizer of a cultural movement including art exhibitions that were closely connected with the Symbolist school of painting.Any of these figures would deserve a biography to himself, but I chose to give pride of place to Lévi because of his particularly seminal influence both within France and internationally. Many of his ideas were admired by Madame Blavatsky and passed into Theosophy. The magicians of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn were strongly influenced by him, as were writers such as Huysmans, Baudelaire and W.B. Yeats. And Aleister Crowley believed himself to be Lévi’s reincarnation. As an artist he also has his place in esoteric history, if only because of his famous drawing ofBaphomet or the Goat of Mendès, which has been reproduced innumerable times in books and magazines dealing with magic and the occult. This drawing was not included in the first edition of this book, but I have now made good the omission, and the picture is shown in Fig. 1. In the iconography of esotericism it has become one of those instantly recognized images like—in a wider context—Leonardo’s Vitruvian Man, Salvador Dali’s melting watches or Munch’s The Scream. I even saw a plaster version of it in bright red, placed in the middle of a sort of Voodoo altar that had been set up as a museum exhibit. It is often—quite mistakenly—interpreted as a satanic image, and here I would like to correct this misconception.The image symbolizes the process of working with the “Astral Light,” a key concept for Lévi. The Astral Light is another name for the notion of an invisible, all-pervading fluid or medium on which thoughts can be imprinted and through which phenomena can be influenced. For Lévi it is the basis of all magical workings. In order to work with the Astral Light the magician has to be balanced between the forces and polarities that surround him, and it is this balance that is conveyed in the Baphomet image. The goat represents dense, earth-bound nature, but has angel’s wings representing heavenly nature. It has female breasts but a male phallus. The four elements are shown by the hooves resting on the globe (earth), the fish scales on the belly (water), the wings (air) and the torch rising from the head (fire). Darkness and light are present in the black and white crescent moons and in the black and white serpents curled around the caduceus-like phallus.

First the light must be fixed and concentrated (coagula) and then projected as a flow of energy (solve). In the centre of the goat’s forehead is a pentagram, which for Lévi represents the dominion of will over the Astral Light. To see how quickly Lévi’s drawing was misinterpreted one only needs to look at the 15th trump card, Le Diable, in the Tarot pack designed by Oswald Wirth and published in 1889 (Fig. 3). Here a grotesque caricature of Lévi’s Baphomet appears as the Devil. It now has bat’s wings instead of angel’s wings, and the arms are pointing in the wrong directions—coagula should of course point to the earth and solve to heaven, as in Lévi’s drawing. Wirth’s picture was the forerunner of many subsequent distortions of Lévi’s image.It may seem surprising that—at least to my knowledge—no movement or school has emerged to perpetuate Lévi’s ideas. This may be because it is rather difficult to extract a coherent message from his works. Lévi’s writings poured from his pen in an inspired but often careless flow, and he hardly ever re-read or corrected drafts and printed proofs. Consequently his books are often rambling, verbose, badly structured and marred by mistakes. Nevertheless, if one perseveres with them one finds that they contain some fascinating ideas, which must have appeared new and exciting to his contemporaries and which continue to speak to many readers of today.The appearance of this edition gives me the opportunity to add an important bibliographical reference. At the time this book first appeared it contained the only biography of Lévi in English, but in 1975 the University of Alabama Press published Eliphas Lévi: Master of Occultism by Thomas A. Williams, an excellent and most engaging study of Lévi and his ideas. In his preface, Williams, an American professor of romance languages, wrote: “Occult and esoteric thought has become an inescapable part of our contemporary intellectual climate. It is time for all of us to find out something—something reliable—about it ... but even as we set out to educate ourselves in this dark domain we confront a basic question: where do we begin? The path is dim and the forest obscure.”Today the path is a good deal less dim and the forest is progressively being charted, as esotericism becomes increasingly Preface to the New Edition/Acknowledgments933684 Levi FM.indd 111/10/11 9:57 AM"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"accepted within the academy as a legitimate area of study, as the re-appearance of this book in the SUNY Press Series in Western Esotericism shows.

I feel that the time has come for a morebalancedjudgement.In viewofall this it may be asked why I have not confinedthis book to EliphasLevi.The reason is that, while I feel a studyofLeviwas necessary, I also felt that he needed to be set in his"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"12Introductioncontext and that both tasks could be accomplished in onevolume. My readers willjudgewhetheror not I have succeededinthis attempt.Levi,as I say, needed to be set in his context, forhe was partofan occult revival whose antecedents can be tracedback to the years preceding the FrenchRevolutionand whosesubsequent developmentcan be followed forward to the FirstWorldWar.Thereis,ofcourse,something artificial aboutdividing thecontinuumofhistoryup into sections in this way,but this is the only way thatthe historian can proceed, and Ibelieve that the term 'occult revival'can meaningfully beused in relation to the period underdiscussion.Partsofthegroundcoveredin this book have beenablychartedalready,but theterritoryhas never been mapped outin its entirety. This is surprising, as the French occultists wereextremely influentialboth in theirowncountryand abroad,and tracesoftheir influence can be found in art, politics andliterature.Theyalso madecertain verysignificant contributionsto the occult tradition which are now taken for granted bymodernoccultists.The Tarot, for example, as a magical system,is an entirely French invention.Itwas Courtde Gebelin,writingin the late eighteenth century, who first presentedit as an occultdevice to the public,and it was EliphasLeviwho connected itwith the Cabala.The book on the TarotwrittenbyLevi'ssuccessorPapusis still a standardwork on the subject today.The French occult revival is also interestingfrom an historicalpointofview.Why,we may ask, didsuch a revivalbeginin the scepticalclimateofeighteenth-century France? Wasit partly perhapsbecausethe scepticis more vulnerable to per-suasion than the religiousman?A personwho has astrong faithrooted in an acceptedreligious traditionwill, in a sense, beinoculated against outlandishbeliefs. The sceptic,on theotherhand, weakens hisdefencesby denying a fundamental partofhis nature, namelythe needfor religious belief; thus he is aneasy prey for the self-appointedprophetor messiahwith somecolourful new cult to offer.This, however, is only partofthe explanation.One mustalsotake into account thesocialand political crisis that wasbrewingup in Franceat the timeofthe beginningofthe occultrevival-and indeedcontinued to come to the boil at intervalsthroughoutthe nineteenthcentury.

The same conditions pre-vailed in Rome during the periodofpolitical turbulence thatpreceded the coming topowerofJulius Caesar; and againlater onwhenthe Roman Empire was crumbling.

At agathering in Paris Saint-Germain was introduced to the Countessvon Georgy, who, fifty years earlier, had been to Venice whereher husband had been posted as ambassador. Recognising thenameofSaint-Germain, she askedifby any chance his fatherhad been in Venice at that time. Saint-Germain's reply wassurprising: no, but he himself had been in Venice fifty yearsago and,whatwas more, had paid court to the Countess., \"Forgiveme,\" said the Countess, but that is impossible; theComteSaint-Germain I knew in those days was at least forty-fiveyears old, and you, at the outside, are that at present.\", \"Madame,\" replied the Count, smiling,\"Iam very old.\",\"Butthen you must be nearly ahundredyears old.\"B"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"18EliphasLeviandtheFrenchOccultRevival,\"Thatis not impossible,\" theCountreplied, and recountedsome details which convinced the Countess, who exclaimed:'''Iam already convinced. You are a most extraordinaryman, a devil.\", \"Forpity's sake!\" exclaimed Saint-Germain in a thunderingvoice.\"Nosuch names!\"'He appeared to be seizedwitha cramp-like trembling inevery limb, and left theroomimmediately.'Similar stories about the strangeCountcrop up all overEurope. Evidently he was in England during the JacobiteRebellionof1745,and was arrested and held for a time as aspy. Horace Walpole confirms this in a letter to Sir HoraceMann, dated 9th December1745:'Theother day they seized an odd man who goes by the nameofCountSaint-Germain. He has been here these two years, andwill not tell who he is or whence, butprofessesthat he does notgo by his right name. He sings and plays on the violinwonder-fully, is mad and not very sensible.'TheComtede Saint-Germain represents a recognisabletypeofsemi-legendary figure who appears frequently in history.He has hiscounterpartin AppolloniusofTyana, the Greeksage, healer andwonder-workerofthe first centuryA.D.;and in Christian Rosencreutz, the shadowy medieval figure,supposedly the founderofthe Rosicrucian movement. Likebothofthese men, and like many another miraculous figure,Saint-Germain was credited with ajourneyto the East and aseriesofinitiations into oriental mysteries. For example, at thecourtofthe ShahofPersia he is supposed to have gathered hisprodigious knowledgeofprecious stones, and in India hisknow-ledgeofalchemy.Itis impossible to say how manyofthe stories about Saint-Germain are true, but the very existenceofthe legend at thisperiodofhistory is significant.Itmay seem surprising that therational eighteenth century, and particularly the ultra-rationalFrance, should encourage such a legend. But the fact is that thehuman mind abhors the absenceofirrational belief,just as natureabhors a vacuum. Thus, the intellectuals who had initiated therevolt against the Christian Church were, by the middleoftheeighteenth century, already becoming tiredoftheirownscepti-cism and were looking around for a new faith to replace theone they had abandoned."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"TheRebirthofMagic19Onemanifestationofthissearch wasthegrowthoffree-masonry;anditissignificantthatSaint-Germainiscreditedwithhavingbeena leadinglightinthemasonicmovement.Accordingto oneaccount,forexample, he wasoneoftheFrenchrepresentativesatthegreatmasonicconventionthattookplaceinParis in1785.Heis also said tohaveinitiatedtheItalianoccultistCagliostro,using a Templarritual.Althoughclaimingto beofthegreatestantiquity,thefree-masonicmovementin itspresentformdatesfrom1717whentheGrandLodgeofLondonwas established.FromEnglanditspreadquicklythroughoutEuropeand alsoreachedNorthAmerica.ThefirstFrenchlodge,thatofBrotherhoodandFriend-ship, isbelievedto havebeenstartedatDunkirkin1721.Butit wasnotuntilovertwentyyearslaterthata lodgeofficiallyrecognisedbytheEnglishGrandLodgewas set up in Paris.Thisprobablytookplace inabout1743.In1756TheGrandLodgeofFrance wasfounded.Thislatersplit upintofactions,butwasreassembledin1771bytheGrandDukeofLuxem-bourg.A yearlaterit wasreconstitutedastheGrandOrientofFrance.BythetimetheRevolutionbrokeoutin1789therewerebetweensix and sevenhundredlodgesin France, totallingabout30,000members.sOneoftheleadersofthemovementwastheDukeofChartres,thefuturePhilippeEgalire,whosidedwiththerevolutionaries,butwaseventuallyexecutedin1793.In1773he wasmadeGrandMaster,and his sister, theDuchesseofBourbon,wasGrandMistressofthewomen'slodges.Intheprovincialcities,andespecially in Lyons,freemasonryhadastrongfollowing.Becauseoftheclose-knit, federalstructureofthe masonicmove-mentithadtheappearanceofa counter-Church,and tobeginwithwasopposedbytheauthorities,thoughit fairlyrapidlycameto betolerated.Abullagainstfreemasonrywas issued in1738byPopeClementXII,butit wasnotrecordedbytheFrenchparliamentandhadlittleeffect.In1789twenty-sixlodgeswerepresidedoverbypriests, andtherewereevenlodgeswithincertainreligioushouses,\"It wasnotuntilthenineteenthcenturythatfreemasonrywas tocomeintoseriousconflictwiththeChurch.Themainappealoffreemasonrylay inthefactthatit claimedto bethesolerecipientandguardianofanancientandpowerful"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"20EliphasLeviandtheFrenchOccultRevivalsecret handeddownfrom antiquity.Theprecise nature andprovenanceofthis secret was naturally a matterofsome dispute,and when themovementbegan to split into factions it was in-evitable that each new order that appeared should lay claim tobeing the only'true'masonry.The ideaof'ancient wisdom' was not new.Ithad beenpropa-gated during theRenaissanceby the scholars who revived theHermetic teachings and espoused the Jewish Cabala.Whatwasnew about masonry was the fact that it constituted a widespreadesotericmovementwhich, in spiteofits warring factions, had astrong elementofcohesion and central direction.Mostofthe leading occultistsofthe eighteenthcenturyweremembersofmasonic or quasi-masonic fraternities.

It is certain,however, that he was a Catholic, as there is a recordofthe bap-tismofhis son.Thereis evidence that he wasbornin the parishofNotre-Damede Grenoble, and that his father was a school-masterofLatin in the town. Pasqually's follower, J.-B.Willer-moz, denies that he had any Jewishblood.Ofhis childhood andyouthalmost nothing is known, butonce again there is thewell-wornlegendofa journeyto theOrient, and the acquisitionofhidden wisdom in Egypt, Arabia,Palestine and China.

He was not allowed, exceptwithmoderation,to indulge the senses, and had to eschew fornication.The choiceofthe name 'ElectCohens'reveals the JewishinspirationofmuchofPasqually's doctrine. Pasqually believedthat the Jewishtraditionhad beenpervertedby itsorthodoxpractitioners,butthat certain'true Jews' had preserved it in itspurity. Clearly he believed that hisorderwas in some sensehelping to restore the true Judaism, by which he may have meantthe Cabala as histheoryofspirits corresponds closely to cabalisticdoctrine. In the Cabala thenumberten is given greatsignificance-thereare, for example, ten sephiroth,or spheres, on theTreeofLife. Pasqually believed in tenclassesofspirit and held thatten was the divinenumberparexcellence.Pasqually continued to lead hisgroupuntil the year1772whenhe sailed for SantoDomingoin the Caribbean, on amission connectedwithsomepropertyhe had there, leavingthe Elect Cohens in the handsofhischiefdisciples,Bacon andWillermoz.He neverreturnedand died atPort-au-Princein1774.Hisorderdied soon afterwards.

His name was Louis Claude de Saint-Martin, later tobecome famous for his writingsunderthe nameof'Le Philo-sopheInconnu'.Saint-Martinrecognised in Pasqually the master he waslook-ing for, and in due course he was initiated into the Elect Cohens,the initiation taking placebetween3rd August and zndOctober1768.In1771heabandoned the military profession to devotehimselfentirelytocontemplationand study.At the timeofPasqually's death, Saint-Martin was living inParis andwritinghis first treatise,OfErrorsandTruth,inwhichhe set out to teach the hidden principles behind allknowledge.Itwas thebeginningofa long campaignofpreaching hisownhigWy individual brandofmysticism all over Europe.Thegreatest influence on hisideaswasJacob Boehme, the seventeenth-centuryGerman mysticwhomhe regarded as'thegreatest"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"26EliphasLeviandtheFrenchOccultRevivallight that has appeared on earth since One who is the lightitself'.ll Saint-Martin believed in an ideal society based on a'natural and spiritual theocracy' governed by men who wouldbe chosen by God and who would regard themselves as 'divinecommissioners' to guide the people. He died in1803,havingremained a strict Catholic all his life, in spiteofthe fact that hisfirst treatise was placed on the Index. He left behind him alarge volumeofwriting which continued to influence mysticsand occultists rightthroughthe nineteenth century.While Saint-Martin was writingOJE\"orsandTruth,and Baconand Willermoz were going their separateways, the faithfulAbbeFournier was busy trying to contact his departed master, Pas-qually. He tried for a long time in vain, then one daysuccesscame. He described the event inCequenousavonsete:'At length, on a certain day, towards ten o'clock in the even-ing, I, being prostrated in my chamber, calling on God toassistme, heard suddenly the voiceofM. dePasqually,my director,who had died in the body more than two years previously. Iheard him speaking distinctly outside my chamber, the doorbeing closed, and the windows in like manner, the shutters alsobeing secured. I turned in the directionofthe voice, being thatofthe long garden belonging to the house, and thereupon Ibeheld M. de Pasqually with my eyes, who began speaking,and with him were my father and my mother, both also dead inthe body. God knows the terrible night which I passed!'Fournier relates that these visionsofhis parents and Pasquallycontinued for many years.Another interesting group that flourished at this period wasAntoine-Joseph Pernety's Illumines d'Avignon. Pernety was acolourful character whose life is rather better documented thanPasqually's.He was born on 13th February1716at Roanne-en-Forez into a rather poor lower-middle-classfamily,He receivedhisfirst education from his cousin, theAbbeJacques PernettiofLyons, and early in life displayed unusual intellectual ability.Like manyproInisingyoung men from the lower ranksofsociety he was oriented towards the Church and in 1732 hebecame a Benedictine, entering the abbeyofSaint-Allire deClermont. Later he was sent to the abbeyofSaint-Germain inParis to collaborate in the writingofa religious book.At that time alchemy and the hermetic tradition were much invogue, and in1742appearedL'Histoiredefaphilosophieher-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"TheRebirthofMagic27metiquebytheAbbeLanglet-Dufresnoy,whichenjoyedgreatpopularity.Pemetycame across thebookinthelibraryatSaint-Germainand read it avidly.Thefascinationofalchemicalsym-bolismtookholdofhim, and heimmersedhimselfin thestudyofit.

In theothergrades the candidatewas takenthroughrituals based on Pernery's interpretationsofancient mythology. He lateradded another grade,ChevalierduSoleil,whose ritual, he claimed, contained a complete courseofhermetism and gnosis.Avignon at that time was still on papal territory, and the anti-masonic bull issued by Pope Clement XII in1738was enforceablethere. Masons were thereforein constant dangerofpersecution.Finding that his situation was becoming perilous,Pernetyleft Avignon and made his way to Berlin where Frederickthe Great, who was a francophileand a loverofphilosophy,was extending a warm welcome toemigreFrench intellec-tuals. Frederick madePernetyamemberofthe RoyalAcademyofBerlin and gave him the postofcuratoroftheroyal library.Pernety quickly made contact with occultists in Berlin and indue course became headofa small groupofdistinguished peoplewho gatheredtogethertodiscusshermetic matters and to searchfor the philosopher's stone. He believed himself to be guidedinhisresearches by an angel calledAssadaiwho waspreventedfrom returning to the higher regions until Pernety had discoveredthe secretofthe GreatWork. The group were also in touchwithan entity called the HolyWordwho informedPernetythat hewas destined for the GreatWorkand that he would becomea 'childofSabaoth'. The entity also told him that a society wouldbe formed as the nucleus for the new peopleofGod, and thathe and his friends had been chosen to be the centreofthis society.Newinitiates were to be admitted by a ceremonyknownasconsecration which was to take place on a hill near Berlin andwas to continue every morning for nine days. The candidateswere required to set up an altarofturfand to burn incense andswear to consecrate themselves to the serviceofGod. Variousmembersofthe groupwentthroughthis ceremony.Pernety left Berlin inNovember1783and, after further travels,was instructed by the HolyWordtoreturnto Avignon.Onhis return he became friendly with the Marquis de Vaucroze,whoinstalled Pernety in a little house on his estate at Bedarrides, afew miles from Avignon. Thisterritorywas in oneofthe threefiefsofthe archbishopricofAvignon which, although partof"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"TheRebirthofMagic29papalterritory,were, by a strange anomaly, not under papaljurisdiction. Pernetywas therefore able to carry on his activitieswithoutfearofpersecution. The house, which he calledThabor,was the birthplaceofthegroupthat had been predicted in Berlinby the HolyWord.The new fraternity,which was called theIllumines d' Avignon, was soonflourishingwithahundredmembers, allofwhomwere freemasons.Theyincluded Dr.Bouge, grand masterofthe lodgeofSaint-Jeand'Ecossealavertu persecutee, the Marquis deThome,wholater founded aSwedenborgianrite, and EspritCalvert, professorofphysiologyand anatomy at the facultyofmedicineofAvignon. UnlikePernety's earlier rite, the Illumines consistedofonly two grades,noviceandilluminemoyen,the leaderofthe group beingknownasmage.Thehouse wasequipped with a temple where the GreatWorkwaspursued.The sortofalchemical activities thatwenton there can be deduced from a manuscript signed by Dr.Bouge setting out the procedure for making the elixirofthephilosophers. This manuscript,which is still extant,is quotedby Joanny Bricaud in hisfascinatingstudyofPernety,LesIllumines d'Avignon.Partofit reads as follows:'Take ten partsofphilosophical mercury, place it in a matrass[glassvessel witha roundor ovalbody and a long neck] or aphilosopher's egg,togetherwith one partofgold beaten intoleaves; the gold will dissolve on the spot. Sealthe vesselher-metically and expose it to the first degreeofheat,and in fortydays it will take on a black colour, blacker than the blackoftheblessed Raymond Lully, which is the raven's head that the philo-sophers talk of.

Soon after that itpresumably died a natural death. One relicofPemety'sinfluencedid, however, remain in freemasonry. The highest gradeofhis original rite which he had operated before going toBerlin, namely the gradeofChevalierduSoleil,was dividedinto two degrees and made the twenty-seventh andtwenty-eighth gradeofthe Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite.Pernery's writings also continued to be read long after hisdeath.Pernery's group was only oneofan enormous proliferationofmasonic and occult orders which grew up all over France inthe latter half of the eighteenth century. There was, for example,the RiteofthePhilalethes,founded by Savalette de Langes,keeperofthe royal treasury, in1775.This combined the doctrinesofPasqually with thoseofSwedenborg. It was also,like Pernery'srite, tinged withalchemicaldoctrines. The rite had twelvedegrees,ofwhich the ninth was thatoftheUnknownPhilo-sopher; this did not refer to Saint-Martin, but was the nameofaspirit familiar to the celebrants ofPasqually's rituals.Itis possiblethat this was the original inspiration for Saint-Martin'snomdeplume.Thenthere was theso-calledEgyptian masonryoftheSicilianCagliostro, whose strange life has been the subjectofmore thanone biography. He claimed to have received, at the pyramidsofEgypt, a full initiation into the 'mysteriesofthe veritableGrandOrient'and to be able to make gold and silver, renewyouth, give physical beauty and evoke the spiritsofthe dead. Healso proclaimed that he had lived for2000years. Cagliostrofound France an ideal environment for his posturings andenjoyed enormoussuccessin thesalons."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"TheRebirthojMagic31Cagliostro's Egyptian rite, having been rejectedinEngland,was receivedenthusiasticallyinFrance, and soon he had installedhimself as High Priestofa Temple ofIsis in theRuede la Son-diere in Paris. In1785he declared, apparently on Egyptianprecedent, that women might be admitted to the mysteriesofthe pyramids, andindue course Madame de Lamballe and otherladies from the upper ranksofFrench society were admittedat the vernal equinox amid the oriental luxury of the templeofIsis.Cagliostro later moved toRome,where he was arrestedby the Inquisition and died in prison.A visionaryofa rather different kind, who also had aninflu-ence on French occultism, was the Swede Emanuel Swedenborg,who poured out his strange doctrinesinArcanaCoelestis,TheApocalypseRevealed,FourPreliminaryDoctrines,andThe TrueChristianReligion.He held that since man is, inessence,a spirit,he is able to communicate with the instructed by spirits andangels,provided that God grants him thenecessaryreceptivity.Swedenborg claimed that he himself enjoyed this privilege.Notonly had he conversed with many types of spirit, but hadbeen conducted by them to other planets,ofwhose inhabitantshe gave detaileddescriptions.At the same time as Pasqually wasrecruiting his first adepts, Swedenborg's writings were havinga wideinfluencein France.Another foreigner whoinfluencedFrench occultism was theAustrian Franz Anton Mesmer(1734-1815),the pioneerofhypnotism. Mesmer had taken a medical degree at ViennaUniversity, and for his doctorate had written athesisentitleddePlanetarumInfluxu inCorporeHumano(OJ theInfluenceoj thePlanetson theHumanBody),inwhich he postulated the existenceofa subtlefluidpervading all bodies and manifesting itself inthe motionsofthe planets, and in tidal and atmospheric changes.Whenthe ebb andflowofthisfluidwithin the human bodywas outofharmony with the universalrhythmnervous ormental disorders resulted.Soon after qualifying Mesmer began to apply this theory tothe treatmentofhis patients, attempting to control theflowwithin the sick person by applying magnets to the body and bydirecting thefluidwith a wand. He soon achieved some startlingcures, the most famous being thatofa young girl who had be-come blindthrougha nervous disorder.

One pieceofapparatus was anoak barrel pierced with anumberofholesthroughwhichpro-truded movable rodsofiron. The patients sat round the barrelin a dimmed room, their handsjoinedand their knees and feettouching to ensure the circulationofthe magnetic fluid. Atthe same time each patient would touch theaffiictedpartofhisbodywith oneofthe iron rods. Appropriate music was providedsometimes by Mesmer himself who was an expertperformeronthe glassharmonica, a curiousinstrumentconsisting basicallyofaseriesofglassbowls, varying in sizeto provide a scale. From timeto time Mesmerwouldwalk round the circle, gazingpene-tratingly at each patient, speaking in a low voice, and wavinghis wand over their bodies. He wore a robeoflilac silk,trimmedwithlace. A featureofhistreatmentwas the inducingofa'crisis' in the patient, after which the disorder supposedlydisappeared.Throughhis Frenchdisciple,Charles d'Eslon, he wasintro-duced to thechiefmedical menofFrance, in the hope that hewould gain in Paris the recognition that had eluded him inVienna. In justificationofhis theories hewroteaMemoiresurladecouvertedumagnltismeanimal.But the Paris medical faculty,like the Vienna one, turned down his theories. A long struggleensued, during which d'Eslon found himself outlawed becauseofhis support for Mesmer. Finally, mainlythroughthe influenceofMarie Antoinette, a Royal Commission was appointed fromthe French AcademyofSciences consistingofa numberofdistinguishedscientistsincluding Lavoisier, Benjamin Franklinand the infamous Dr. Guillotin.

But secretsocietiestendto get blamedfor the illsofthe world, and those who later looked for some-where to lay the blame for the Revolution found in the masoniclodges andothersecret groups an ideal target for their accusations.Anexpatriate priest by the nameoftheAbbeBarruel, who hadtaken refuge in England from the ravagesofthe French Revo-lution, was the firstproponentofthe theory that the Revolutionwas the resultofa secret conspiracy on the partofa numberofsinister occult groups.

This, accordingto Barruel, was a dangerous group, dedicated to the spreadingofpropaganda against religion, morals and government. Hequotes a letter from Voltaire to Helvetius, dated zoth April1761,in which occurs the passage: 'Let the Philosophers unite inabrotherhoodliketheFree-Masons,let themassembleand supporteach other; let them be faithful to theassociation.' This is aninteresting remark, for it shows that thefreemasonsdid seta kindofexample to those who wished to band together for thereformofsociety.Inorder to discover how much truth there is in Barruel'sassertionsit is necessaryto examine the whole positionoffree-masonry in the years leading up to theRevolution. Whenwe"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"40EliphasLeviandtheFrenchOccultRevivallook closely at themovementwe see that it occupied a uniqueposition in the socialstructure;for in freemasonry the idealsofdemocracy and autocracy met.AsIhave mentioned, the GrandOrientofFrance was finallyestablished in1772;and an examinationofits constitution isimportantto an understandingofthe natureofmasonry.Theconstitution provided that each lodge would elect a venerable tolead it. The lodges would be represented at the GrandOrientby the venerables or by deputies chosen by the members. Theserepresentatives formed a kindofcentral legislative council,which intumvestedday-to-dayexecutivepowerin a smallergroup headed by the Grand Master and composed mainlyofseniorofficers.A circular issued by the GrandOrienton rSthMarch1775expressed the idealsofthe constitutionwhenit stated:'TheGrandOrientis nothing more than a body formed by the unionofthe free representativesofall the lodges: it is the lodgesthemselves and all the masons belonging to them who, viatheir representatives, give laws which they enforce with onehand and obey with the other. No one obeys a law that is notself-imposed. It is the most just, the most natural, and conse-quently the most perfectofgovernments.'In spiteofthis claim there was a strong monarchical elementin the constitutionofthe GrandOrient. The Grand Master wasimmovable, as was hissecond-in-command,theAdministratorGeneral. Gaston Martin, in his masterly studyoffreemasonryand the Revolution.! says'Theassemblywas more like the councilofa monarch than aChamberofDeputies.Thesimilaritywentfurther: corresponding to the four traditional councilssurround-ing the sovereign were four chambers: the lodgeofcouncil;the chamberofParis; the chamberofthe provinces; and thechamberofadministration.'Nevertheless the masonic lodges provided anenvironmentwhere membersofdifferent social strata could mix on more orless equalterms-aremarkableinnovationconsidering thefossilisedrigidityofsocial divisions in France at that time.Althoughthe earliest lodges were confined to the nobility thissituation did not last, and the bourgeoisie were admitted infull force. But theworkingclassremainedexcluded for thefollowing reason: the doctrine was held that the freemasonwas a free man and that those who depended on others for"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"TheOccultand theRevolution41their living were not free. Many lodges were dominated bya single profession. For example, at Rennes, the ParfaiteUnion was composed largelyofmembersofthe legal pro-fession,while the Parfaite Amitie was made up primarilyofmerchants.The outstandingcharacteristicofthe movement at this timewas the highintelleetuallevelofthe members and their recep-tivenessto new ideas. As Martin says, 'Freemasonry incontestablyrepresented the intellectual and moraleliteofthe nation.' Acertain prestige came to be attached to belonging to the fraternity,and membersofthe bourgeoisieeager to display their intellectualsuperiority rushed tojoin.Itwas not surprising, therefore, thatbefore long themovementhad developed a vast and influentialnetwork reaching into every sectionofFrench society.Therewere lodges in the army and, as I mentioned before, even anumber in religious houses. Many important names are to befound in the listofmembersofthe Grand Orient. Among themwere Voltaire, Bailly, Danton and Helvetius.In1779,a year after its formation, the GrandOrienthad104lodges:23in Paris,71in the provinces, and10in the army. By1789its strength hadgrownto a totalof629lodges. This rapidgrowthwas explained partly by the infiltrationofmembersofother organisations who wished to manoeuvre the GrandOrientandtumits powerful influenceto their own ends.The aimsoftheinfiltrators divided themselvesinto three categories: quasi-mystical,religious, and political.Thequasi-mysticalinfluence originated from the ideasofsuch men as Cagliostro, Mesmer, Swedenborg and Saint-Martin,whose teachings Idiscussedin the last chapter. The religiousinfiltration came mainly from the Jesuits, whose plan was asubtle one. Since themovementembraced both Catholic andProtestant, the Jesuits hoped to attract large numbersofProtest-ants into masonry and then gradually orient themovementback towards Catholicism, thus drawing the erring Protestantsback into the fold. The political influences came to a largeextent from German revolutionaries such as Weishaupt andBode, who wanted totumthe whole masonic movement intoan instrument for political reform.Things came to a head at the great masonic congress atWil-helmsbad in1782.Here the rationalistrevolutionaries, headedby Bode, were fmally defeated by the moderates, causing a"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"42EliphasLeviandtheFrenchOccultRevivalsplit in themovementin which the Bode faction alliedthem-selveswiththe Bavarian IlluminatiofWeishaupt. But the defeatofthe political faction did not mean that the centralbodyofmasonry ceased to have any political importance.Thefactthatorthodoxmasonry in France, as representedby the GrandOrient, had renounced any extremerevolutionaryaimsprobablyenabled it in the end to have a greatereffect politically.Theinfluenceoffreemasonryon theRevolutionwas notthroughany secret conspiracyofthe kind envisaged by theAbbeBarroel. Nevertheless masonry did play animportantpart inpaving the way for revolution.Oneofits mostimportantfunc-tions was to act as a kindofprovinggroundfor the idealsofthephilosophers.Inthe masonicmovementthese were transformedfromabstract speculation into practical action. This is how Martinsums it up:'Inthis transformationofphilosophical principles into politicalrules theroleoffreemasonrywasofprimaryimportance. Thisimportance can be illustratedby the following comparison:withregard to the doctrinesofliberty and equality freemasonryplayed the same role as a parliamentarycommission doeswithregard to a proposedlaw .H avingreceiveda setofabstracttheories, freemasonryextractedtheirpracticalpossibilitiesandpaved the way for their realisation.'In1789the King decidedtosummonthe StatesGeneral,adecisionin which the masonsmayhaveplayed a part, consideringthenumberwhowere membersofth eKing'sentourage.Duringthe electionsto the StatesGeneralthe freemasonsusedtheopportunityto put forwardtheirschemesfor reform.Theydid this, not directly, butthroughthecahiersdedoleances,listsofgrievances thatw ere drawnup ineach election district fortransmission to the assembly. The speedwith which thesecahiersappeared and the cogency with which they werewrittenindicated that the freemasonshadlong beenpreparedfor suchanopportunityto propagateth eirideasofliberty and equality.The masonic influence continuedwhen the States Generalassembled. A largenumberofmasons were elected, and in theThirdEstate they were in a majority. As therevolutiongatheredmomentum,however,forces began to build up that even themasons were powerless to check.

Finally a curious compromisewas reached: the paper was signed but not printed; it was thenput awaywithoutdiscussionand not mentioned for ten years.A second commission reported in August1837,and a prizeof3000francs was offered to anyone who could readwithoutusing his eyes. The fact that nobody was able to do this resultedin the Academy deciding to ignore in future anything to dowith animal magnetism. ' The transpositionofthesenses', theAcademy declared, 'does not exist in magnetism; thus thereis nothing certain and scientific to look for in this kindofphysiologicalexperimentation.'Magnetism has its enemies not only in thescientificcommunitybut also in the Church, and many polemics against it werepublished in books, pamphlets and articles writtenby clergymen.One such polemic wasL' Anti-maonetismeanimal,byP.H.

These romantic ideas mayhave owed something to theAbbeBarruel.Many candidates offered themselves as pretenders to thethrone, but the most persuasive was Charles Edouard Naundorff,who styledhimselfthe Due deNormandieand bore a strikingresemblance to his alleged father, Louis XVI. He arrived fromPrussia in the early1830Sand lived in France until1836whenhewas banished by Louis Philippe. He sought refuge in England,wherehe lived for a time at Camberwell. He died in1845atDelft, in Holland, and was buried as Louis XVII. It is significantthatNaundorffwas also a religious visionary.

First the Archangel Michael appeared to him,then he had a visionofthe Blessed Virgin Mary and St. Josephin which he received thecommandmentto preach the newgospel, which was to be called the'WorkofMercy'. He was togatherroundhim a groupofdiscipleswho would aid him inthe taskofsaving theworldfrom disaster and setting up a newkingdomofGod.Soon after his first vision he set up anoratoryin thecardboard-box factory at Tilly,wherehe kept Hosts which he claimed hadbeen sent to him by people who wished to save them frompro-fanation by evil-minded persons. The dangerofprofanation wasproved, Vintras claimed, by the fact that these Hosts exhibitedsignsofhaving miraculously bled real blood.Such was thepowerofVintras's personality, and the abilityto persuade peopleofthetruthofhis visions, that he soongathered about him a large following, amongwhomwerecertain membersofthe clergy, such as theAbbeCharvoz,CureofMontLouis.

He was able to receive visits and to maintain contact withhisdisciples.But meanwhile things were not going well for thegospel.On8thNovember1843PopeGregoryXVI issuedabriefcondemningthe sect.

The area has changed little since that time; the streetsare still filled with the aroma from the foodstallswhere theConstant family must have shopped; and a little way down thestreet from where they lived stands theCafeProcope, the oldestcafein Paris, where Constant's predecessor,Courtde Gebelin,doubtlessdiscussedthe occult arts with d'Alembert and Diderotin the days before the Revolution.The boy grew up in a poor but happy familyenvironmentand seems to have cherished a deep affection for his parents.Later, in oneofhis poems, he glorified thesatisfactionoflivinga virtuous and simple life such as they had led. In the poem hedescribeshow his father had given twoSOllSfrom his meagreearnings to feed a starving neighbour. 'He believed in God withall his heart', says Constant 'and taught me myprayers.\"Ifhis father set him an exampleofkindness and humility, hismother, with her intelligence and morefanaticalpiety, instilledin himself-disciplineand a profoundly religious outlook..Shedivided her time betweenworkand prayer and must have beena powerful personality.In the introduction to his bookL'Assomptiondelafemme(1841)Constant wrote as followsofhis early years:"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"74EliphasLeviand theFrenchOccultRevival'Mychildhood was weak anddreamy;I never took part inthe gamesofotherchildren; I stood apart and meditated vaguelyor tried todraw;I became easily enthused by a toy or picturewhich afterwards I broke or tore up; the need to love intenselywas alreadytormentingme; I did notknowhowto explainmy malaise.'This solitary existence nourished a precocious intelligence, andConstant was fortunate in that from an early age he was placedin the handsofteachers who gave direction to that intelligence.At the ageofabout ten he was lucky enough to beadmittedto oneofthe schools in Paris run by priests who gave freeeducation to the childrenofthe poor. These schools wereknownascommunautes.The one which Constant enteredwas run by theAbbeJ-B.Hubault Malmaison in thepresbyteryofthe churchofSaint-Louis-en-l'Ile. He thrived at the schooland became an outstanding pupil as well as showing the begin-ningsofa remarkable eloquence and a ready wit.At the ageoftwelve Constant took his firstcommunion,and the splendourofthe Catholic religion took holdofhim.'Throughthe mysteriesofCatholicism', he laterwroteinL'AssomptioudeLafemme'Icaught a glimpseofthe infinite; myheart became impassioned towards a God who sacrificedhimselffor his children and transformed himself into bread to nourishthem;the gentle figureofthe immolated Lamb made meshed tears, and already the tender nameofMary made my heartpalpitate.'He confided his feelings to theAbbeHubault, who saw in hispupil an ideal candidate for the priesthood. 'He easily persuadeda childoftwelve to take up a supernatural vocation dedicatedto continence and prayer...'Consequently, inOctober1825,Constant entered the seminaryofSaint-Nicolas duChardonnet.In doing so he put familylife behind him for good. In hisownwords: 'I engaged on afatal road which was to lead me to science and to unhappiness.'A clue to Constant's laterdevelopmentcan be found in thefactthatthe principalofthis seminary, theAbbeFrere-Colonna,was oneofFrance's leading authorities on animal magnetismand related subjects. For many years he carried out detailedresearch into theseheresies-forso he consideredthem-and in due course published his findings in a book entitledExamendumagnetismeanimal(1837),in which he concluded that"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"TheEarlyYears75featsofmagnetism and divination were due to the interventionofthe Devil. In hisclassesat the seminary he was fondofen-larging on his theories about these forbidden arts.Oneofhis most attentive pupils in these lectures was thefifteen-year-old Constant, whose thin, tight-lipped face and largepale eyes took on a lookofexcitement when theAbbespokeofMesmer and his strangeskills. Hadheknownwhat was passingthroughthe boy's mind the priest would certainly have beenalarmed, for the young student was beginning to experience acuriosity about these mysterioussubjects-acuriosity all themore compelling because they were being presentedto him asheresies.Constant never forgot the impression that the priest made onhim, and later wrote the followingpassageabout him:'Hewas the most intelligent and sincerely pious priest I haveeverknown:thus it was he who was the best and the worstinfluence on me.'Thebest, in that he broke for me the tight reinsofmy firstCatholiceducation, to open before me the vast arenaofpro-gress and the future. He was inconsistent in that he taught adoctrine that was inspiring and fullofmovement and yet atthe same time professed a blind obedience to men and ideas thatbelonged to the past. I did not at first see that he was in error,and leaning on his faith I walked for some time along afalseroute.'ThedoctrineoftheAbbeFrerecan be summarised as follows:humanity, fallen from the bosomofGodthroughoriginal sin,returns towards him by a process which tears him away frommatter andspiritualiseshim by degrees. . .'Thus, for theAbbeFrere, the historyofreligion was dividedinto four great epochs: the epochofpenitence, or the ageofthe deluge and the curseofCain; the eraoffaith, thatofthecallingofAbraham, fatherofbelievers; this era lasted, passingthroughthe desert with Moses, until the comingofChrist, who,in dying on the cross bequeathedto his beloved apostle hisMotherand hope; then, under theauspicesofthe Holy Spirit,the third personofGod, not yet wholly revealed, there appeareda glimpseofa future centuryofhappiness,in which Man,seated in the shadeofthe apple treesofthe new Eden, wouldfeel his forehead refreshed by a breathoflove under the beatingwingsofthe mysterious dove, final symbolofthe Divinity."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"76EliphasLeviand theFrenchOccultRevival'Onecan easily imagine how, under the guidanceofsuch amaster, I was able to dreamofthe Catholicismofancienttimes and to feel myself as exalted asthoughI were living inthose early ages.

This doctrineofthe Paraclete was one that became very popular in certainquarters, and Constant was to be oneofits most articulateproponents.It was at the seminaryofSaint-Nicolas that Constant firstbegan to grasp the elementsoftheHebrewlanguage, which wasto stand him in such good stead as an occultist. At the ageofeighteen he was already able to read the scriptures in the original.Destined for the theological collegeofSaint-Sulpice,Constantwas first required to take atwo-yearcourse in philosophyinacollege at Issy, which he entered in1830.It was here that hemade his first sorties into literaturewitha biblical drama,Nemrod,and a poem entitledLaPetiteceuvtedesSavoyardsaBordeaux.Whenthe time came for him to enter Saint-Sulpice,affairsat home were grim.

Evidently someofthe priests attendedthese gatherings and encouraged the young singers.Norwas the syllabus at Saint-Sulpice entirely barrenofinspir-ation. Twice daily each seminarist had to make his'examinationofconscience' which was based on maxims and precepts con-tained in theGoldenVersesofPythagoras,4oneofthosenon-Christian works which, like theMeditationsofMarcus Aurelius,had been taken up by Christians for the universalmoralityand wisdom they contained.

As the mysteriousvisitor was leaving he had turned and said: 'Before long, youwill hear something . . .

Here heworkedon hisHistoiredelamagie,which was published in1859.Healso continuedto givelessonsin occultism, but was alwayscareful to warn his pupils in advance that he did not indulgein the performanceofspectacular magical feats. Nevertheless,despite these warnings, his pupils sometimes had difficultyin keeping their magicwithinreasonable bounds. The followingincident is related inLevi'scorrespondence.'Aworkernamed Maurice, who was fondofevocations,had received from me a prayer which he had been instructedto read before going to bed in the evening in order to driveaway the spiritsofdarkness and to bringhimselfcloser to thespiritsoflight.

After qualifying as a doctor, Rozier haddeveloped a passion for travel and had spent seven years as aship's doctor.Onhis return he hadestablisheda practice in Paris.He later became oneofthe foundersofthe movement createdby the occultist Papus in1885.Rozier andLevitogether carried outexperiments in alchemy,oneofwhich is described in the following account by Rozier:'As far as I canrememberit was in1859or1860,the exactdate isoflittle importance; let usjust say that it was a long timeago.EliphasLevihad been struck by the resemblance betweenpyrites and certain hermetic figures. This mineral is composedofcrystalsofferrous sulphur grouped together so as to imitate,to a fault, an apricot; everything is there, even the stalk. Thisresemblanceofa mineralto a fruit seemed to him to bea sig-nature.'There was also something even more suggestive: gold isoften found in this mineral.'Finally, there was themotto:VisitaInterioraTerraeRectifi-candoInveniesOccultumLapidemVeramMedicinem,3whoseinitial letters spell out the wordVitriolum.This was the crowningpieceofevidence: pyrites could be nothing else but thefirstmatter,thesubstanceon which one had to work to obtain thephilosopher'sstone.'Anotherobservation addeda newpossibility.Pyrites, leftin humid air, deteriorates, producing a white powder which isa mixtureofferrous sulphate and free sulphuric acid; I cruellydiscovered this when I noticed, one fine day, that my supplyhad leaked into a drawer where I kept my linen.

The sphere was buried up to theneck in a massofpyrites, broken up into thin pieces, then thewhole thing was left to itself until the pyrites had been reducedto a magma composedofferrous sulphate, sulphuric acidand a residueofpyrites, not yet attacked; all this took severalmonths.' At the endofthis time I removed the sphere with ajusti-fiable feelingofcuriosity, and inside I found... thepowderofpyrites which I had put in: it had undergone no change. Onceagain the philosopher's stone hadfailed to be discovered.'I repeated this experiment several times, varying the con-ditions, but I never obtained anyresult-whichI am bound tosay did not astonish me in the least.' One day, however, EliphasLevibelieved that he saw a lighttintofblack; thepowderhad taken on a darker colour.

One evening EliphasLeviwas sitting at his desk thinkingofParacelsusandwonderingwhy, in the worksofthesixteenth-centurysage, he had beenunable to find anymentionofthe Tarot, for he was convincedthat the great man must have been familiarwiththe'BookofHermes'. In the midstofthese contemplations he fell asleepand awoke in his dreams in an alchemist's laboratory. A majesticfigure appeared; it was noneotherthan Paracelsus himself.Levitold the apparitionofthe question in his mind, and Para-celsus replied by reaching into a little purse hanging from hisbelt and extracting a copper medallion which he handed toLevi.Onthe outsideofthe piece was represented what appearedto be thejuggleror magus, the first keyoftheTarot;on theotherside was an alphabet.Havingshownhim the coin,ParacelsusbeckonedEliphastofollow him. Traversing the streetsofParis they came at last toa point near the PontNeufwhere the sage pointed to a spot onthe pavement.The following dayLevi,rememberingthe dream, went insearchofthe coin. Passing along the Quai Conti, near thePontNeuf, he came to the place that Paracelsus had indicated, nowoccupied by a stall selling medallions and coins. He searchedthroughthe merchandise and there, among a quantityofmiscel-laneous pieces, he came upon the very one that he had seen inhis dream.Such an experience would be enough to convert most peopleto a belief in spiritualism. YetLevirefused to accept any irra-tional explanation. As he explained to Mackenzie: 'I have nodoubtthat upon purely natural causes the wholeofthis singularvision may be explained. I had fallen asleep with theworkofParacelsus in myhand-whatmore natural than that my mindshould recur to such circumstances as I knew connectedwithhim?' As for the questionofthe coin, 'I was well acquaintedwiththe fact that the coin dealer habitually exposed his wares onthe quay beside the bridge.

Finally he did succeed in finding,ifnot an anchorage,then amethodand a pointofview. But beforeassessinghiscontributionto occultism we must also consider inturntwootheraspectsofLevi:the radical polemicist and the literarystylist,bothofwhomdeserve modest recognition.As a radical thinkerLeviintroducedno very original ideas.Buthe was in many ways aheadofhis time and he differedfrom manyofhis fellowsocialistsin adhering firmly toCatholi-cism and inattemptingto basehis political philosophy onChristian principles.Thoughhe was not capableofconstructinga profoundpoliticaltheoryhe did have the ability to see certaintruths and to point them out in a succinct and pithy way. Forexample, inLesPortesde l'avenir,he says: 'Liberty, Equality,Fraternity! Three words which seem to shine and are in factfullofshadow!Three truths which, in coming together, form atriple lie! For they destroy one another. Libertynecessarilymanifests inequality, and equality is a levelling process thatdoes notpermitliberty,because the heads that rise higher thanothers must always be forced down to the mean. Theattempttoestablish equality and libertytogetherproduce an interminablestruggle...that makes fraternityamong men impossible.'When,however, it comes to drawingup any kindofpoliticalprogramme,EliphasLevibecomesnaive and extravagant. InLesPortesdel'avenir,he recommendsa seriesofreforms, in-cluding the following:'Thatpublicscandalsbe no longer tolerated.'Thatwomenwithoutestate who live idle and luxuriouslives be taught toworkin housesofcorrection.'Thathonestwomenbe protected by law and be admittedto anyjobwhich theycan do as well as a man, so they nolongerhave to resort toprostitution.'Thatmen who live off prostitutes be imprisoned.'Thatthe death penalty be replacedby a longer, harderpunishment: lifeimprisonmentin a dark holewithouthumancontact and only bread andw ater to eat and drink.'Thatthere be a federationofall peoples and that disagree-ments between nations be settled by arbitration, not war.'Thatmen reduced to begging bejudged:ifit isthroughtheirownfault they should be imprisoned,ifthroughthe faultofothers, Society should make amends.'Apart from thesomewhatinhumane suggestion about re-"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"EliphasLevi:AnAssessment143placing the death penalty, mostofthese ideas would be totallyimpossible toputinto effect. Someofhisrecommendationsare,however,more sensibleand far-seeing. He suggests, for example,thatprimaryeducation be free and obligatory. He also saysthat the electionofChurchdignitaries should be by universalsuffrage-averyrevolutionaryproposal coming from one whoprofessed strict obedience to the Pope.LesPortesdeI'avenirwas,ofcourse,writtentowards the endofhis life. His earlier political writings such asLeTestamentdelalibertecontain very little constructive politicalthoughtand agreat dealofrhetoric.Theyrepresent impassioned reaction toinjustice rather than acoherentpolitical philosophy.Neverthe-less they helped to stir up movements forreformat a time whenthey were much needed, and the fact that hewentto prisonthree times for his views shows that he was sincere.The qualityofhis literary style is as erratic as thatofhispoliticalthought;it ranges fromemptyverbosity topassagesofpowerand simplicity. There is no doubt that he is at his worstwhentrying to write in a sensational manner about occultmatters.Thefollowingpassage,from chapter18oftheRitueldeLahautemagie,is an example:'Let usnowadventure in Thessaly, thecountryofenchant-ments. Here was Apuleius beguiled, like the companionsofUlysses, andunderwenta humiliating metamorphosis. Here allismagical-the birds that fly, the insectshummingin the grass,even the trees and flowers.

Throughouthis writings he gives the impressionofpresenting certainopinions for public consumption andwithholdingcertain otherswhichmightbe dangerous to the uninitiated. In certainofhismanuscript writings he criticised the Church and also expressedhis respect forotherreligions. The key to his real pointofviewis to be found inLibrespenseessurdesideesnouvelleswherehe says that there is an exterior and an interior morality.Theexteriormoralityis the observanceoflaws and customs; theinterior morality is piety which, he declares, 'is absolutelyindependentofreligious formulas and priestly prescriptions'.Observanceofthe exterior forms is no usewithoutinterior piety.ButLeviwas always very cautious when it came to ideas thatmight conflictwithCatholicism, and he had a peculiar trickofappearing tobowtoorthodoxybut in fact leaving the wayopen forwhateveropinion he wished to profess.Anexample isthe following passage in chapter2oftheRituel.'I am aware that Christianity has for ever suppressedCere-monial Magic, and that it proscribes the evocations andsacrificesofthe old world. It is not therefore ourintentionto furnish anew basisfor their existence by revealing their antique mysteriesafter a lapseofso many centuries...From the standpointofthetribeofLevi,the exerciseofHighMagic must be considered as ausurpationofthepriesthood;and the same reason has causedthe proscriptionofOperativeMagic by everyofficialcultus.To demonstrate the natural foundationofthe marvellous andto produce it at will is to annihilate for the vulgar mind thatconvincing evidence from miracles which is claimed by eachreligion as its exclusivepropertyand its finalargument.'This passage is equivocal in the extreme. A priest reading itK"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"146EliphasLeviandtheFrenchOccultRevivalwould probably be reassured that the author shared theorthodoxview in outlawing ceremonial magic. But in factwhatLeviseems to be saying is this: all so-called miracles are caused byperfectly explicable phenomena. And thesephenomenacanbe manipulated by anyone who knows the techniquesofmagic.Therefore, to the initiated, magic is a marvellousdemonstrationofthe unityofall religions; but for an uninitiated person itcould merely lead to rejectionofhis own particular creed.Therefore it isprudentfor the adept not to reveal theinnermostsecretsofmagic to the public.In his letters to Spedalieri, he is less guarded about expressinghis views onorthodoxreligion and the Catholic Church.The following letter is especially revealing:'I fail to understandhowour talk theotherday could makeyou fear a whirlofreactionary Catholicism, nor, above all,whatrelation there isbetweenthat grand book theZohar,which 1 read to you, and the rosary, which you are almostafraid to use. 1oughtto have a rosary somewhere orother;itis a respectable child's toy. TheChurchgives it insteadofa bookto thosewhocannot read and to those who are afraid to think.Are you among the latter? Butwhyshould you be? The rosaryis the littleturning-tableofprayer;it represents the indulgenceand indulgencesofthe church for the little ones, the aged, theidiotswhodowhatthey can and who onlyknowjustenoughto be always stammering out to God the perpetual syllablesofchildhood;papa, mamma.Withoutblushing, nay, even with acertain tendernessoftears, 1 couldjoinmyself to the almostbaa-ing prayerofthis flockofinvalids and little ones. A rosaryhad no greater terrors than agrimoire,and 1 do not think theseare old-fogeyish or reactionary opinions.'ForLevi,the trappingsoforthodoxyplayed a part in thatthey supplied the religious needsofthemasses.But they could bedispensed with by the elect who had the intelligence and boldnessto wish to go beyond thenarrowconfinesofdogma.HowmuchLevihimselfknewofthe magicaltraditionhasoften been disputed.Judgingby his published works one mighteasily conclude that he knew next tonothingand covered up hisignorance bypretendingthat he was holding back secretsthroughcaution; but an examinationofwhat he wrote for hisdisciplesand a careful readingofhis published writings showthat he did have a teachingofsorts."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"EliphasLevi:AnAssessment147MuchofwhatUviwrote was basedon ideasthat werecommoncurrency in western occultism as expounded in the worksofsuch writers as Trithemius,Paracelsusand Cornelius Agrippa.All the traditional notions on which magic is based are to befound in hiswork:that man is a microcosmofthe universe;thatallthings are bound together by a networkofinner corres-pondences; that there are entities on a different plane which canbe evoked and manipulated by the useofsigns andtalismans.ButUvidid not adhere very strictly to traditional magicaldoctrine. He was quite willing to change the accepted schemewhere it suited his ideas. For example, traditional cabalismholds that there are four worlds emanating from God in thefollowing orderofdescent: first comes Atziluth, the worldofemanations; second, Briah, the worldofcreation; third,Jet-zirah, the worldofformation;and fourth,Assiah,the worldofaction in which we live. In chapter3oftheDoctrinehe gets theorder right:'TheJews term these three series or degrees in theprogressofspirits [advancing from lower to higher],ASSIAH,YETZlRAH, BRIAR• • •The supreme circle was namedATZILUTH.'But in a frontispiece to theeusmajeuresetclaviculesdeSalomon,Uvishows Briah as the lowest world with Jetzirah above it andAtziluth on top, leaving outAssiahaltogether. This must havebeen a deliberate departure from orthodoxy, because Levi'sletters to Spedalieri show that he was very familiar with themaincabalistictexts. Another interesting point on which hedeparts from traditional cabalism is revealed in a letter toSpedalieri containing the following passage:'Theword you could not read in oneofmy previous letters isthe word science-knowledge. It is the firstofthe giftsofthe HolySpirit, and corresponds to faith in the enumerationofthe sevenChristian virtues.'Youknowthat Knowledge is not oneofthe Sephiroth, butis themirrorwherein are concentrated the rays from themall.It is named Daath.'The letter contains a diagramofthe treeoflife showingDaath placed in the middleofthe abyss between the first andsecond triads.Whatis interesting about thispassageis that Daathis not stressed by the oldcabalisticwriters and plays little partin the traditional system, being regarded as a 'false sephira'.Modemoccult groups using the Cabala, however,lay greatemphasis on it, and this may date fromLevi."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"148EliphasLeviandtheFrenchOccultRevivalButLevi'smost startling innovation was in connecting theCabala with theTarot. Modern occultists take this connectionso much for grantedthat it tends to be forgotten that there isabsolutely no historical evidence that the two were in any wayrelated.Courtde Gebelin does not mention the Cabala in hissection on the cards; and Etteilla, though he was a practitionerbothofthe Cabala and the Tarot, did not make any systematicattemptto relate them.Levi,therefore, appears to have beenthe first to do so. In hisDoctrineetritueldelahautemagieheconnects thetwenty-twotrumps with thetwenty-twolettersofthe Hebrew alphabet and the four suits with the four lettersofthetetragrammatonor NameofGod and the ten numberedcardsofeach suit with the ten Sephiroth.

Oneofthe novels in which this idea is emphasised isCurieuse(1886),which inspired de Guaita to write, in hisEssaisdessciencesmaudites:'Curieuseis reminiscentofSeraphitus-Seraphita,but this,mystery, which Balzac stammered outthroughintuition, M.Peladan formulateswiththe serene boldness andauthorityofonewhoknows, notwiththe feverish enthusiasmofonewhodivines.'The heroineofCurieuseis the Princess Paule Riazan,whohasa love affairwithan individual calledNebo,a painter-aesthetewho is a discipleofMerodack,Itis conceivable thatNebowas to some extent modelled on de Guaita, who also adopted"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"166EliphasLeviand theFrenchOccultRevivalthe name NebowhenwritingtoPeladan,Neboat first resistsadvancesofthe Russian princess, but finally succumbs afterpreparing his studio for the occasion.Theroomis litwithdazzling copper lamps, andperfumedby the aroma from sub-stances burning on a tripod. The walls are paintedwithHebrew-Phoenicianphallic symbols. In this exotic settingNebo,wearinga Chaldean tiara and swinging a censer, approaches the princesswho, titillated by the smellofthe incense, imagines herselfto be 'the great Ishtar, the aphroditeofChaldea'.Thefirst volumeofLaDecadencelatinewasLeVicesupdme,which appeared in1884.It made a strong impression on deGuaita, whowroteas follows toPeladan,'Itis yourVicesupremethat revealedto me (me, a sceptic,thoughrespectful to all holy things) that the Cabala andHighMagic can be more thanjusta mystification. I knew EliphasLeviby name; Iimmediatelyobtained his complete worksand have been meditating onthem-toosuperficially-duringmy rustic exilewithmymother(at thechateauofAlteville)...Permitme to tell you again, my dearSir, that Ishall never forgetthis fact: that it was owing to your book that Iundertookthe studyofHermetic science which seems to me, at first sight,so beautifuland fecundin sublime symbols.'This slightly conflicts with the letter quoted earlier in whichhe says that EliphasLevi'sworks gave him his occult awakening.It seems likely that he was anxious to impress and flatter Peladan,for he concludes the letter by saying:'Ina fortnight, Sir, I shall be back in Paris.Ifyou will be sokind as topermitme, I shall come to ask for some advice toguide the researches which 1 hope to make.'!Evidently Peladanwroteback inviting hisyoung admirerto come and see him, for in a subsequent letter de Guaita said:' You do me a great kindness in offering to let me have a chatwithyou aboutHermetism,something which I have wantedto do for a long time. I do not claim untilnowto have beenanything more thana mere admirerofthe highersciences,who has studied them attentively and perseveringly; it willtherefore be a greatjoyfor me to be able to talkwitha trueinitiate-whois greatlymy senior in cabalistic studies.'After his interviewwith Peladan, de Guaitawrote:'I am grateful to you for having sacrificedseveralprecioushours...you havepleased, interested and obliged me.'"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"TheHeirsofEliphasLevi167The correspondence from which thesepassagesare quotedisextremelyinteresting as it shows the master and pupil re-lationshipbetweenthe two men, a relationship which wasplayeddownby certain writers on de Guaita and doubtlessby de Guaita himself after the two broke up.Meetings between Peladan and his disciple became frequent,and the toneofthe correspondence became more intimate.In one letter de Guaita said:'I am very uneasy about you and would be greatlycomfortedto see you again. You are becoming very seldom seen.'In another, he waxed eloquent in praiseofPeladan:'I know, I sense, that you are an intelligence superior tomine . .. you have the geniusofspontaneity and synthesis; Ihave the talent for patience andanalysis.'Later the friendship came to be more like one between equals,and de Guaita eventually considered himself close enough toPeladan to be able to criticise him. One characteristic to whichde Guaita objected was Peladan's extreme hatredofGermanyand things German, a hatred which was exacerbated by thedeathofhisbrotherAdrienowingto an erroneous prescriptionby a German doctor. In a funeral oration which hewroteforthe occasion he castigated the German nation.Whende Guaitawas sent a copy hewroteto his friend reminding him that therewere good things about the Germans and telling him not toforget Mesmer, Goethe and AlbrechtDurer.De Guaita also took Peladan to task for his amorousexcesses.'Yoursoul', hewrote'is perpetually haunted and obsessed byridiculous sentimental cravings. Can you not live for one weekwithoutyourspirit being preoccupied with these futilities?'Theyalso disagreed over astrology, which was coming backinto vogue under the influenceofEly Star'sLeslHysteresdel'horoscope(1887);this taught an onomantic, cabalistic astrologysimilar to thatofPaulChristian. Peladan laid great stress onastrology in his works and made frequent allusion to the doctrineof'signatures' according to which all earthly things have theircelestial counterparts. De Guaita's attitude was made clear ina letter:' . . . I do not believe inastrology for the reasons I have given,thoughI do believe completely in the possible virtueoftalismansand in the odic medicineofParacelsus,because here there isadirect actionofthe doctor on the sick person, an application"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"168EliphasLeviand theFrenchOccultRevivalofthe will to cure, a will which is formulated by a correspondingsign.'But in spiteofhis scepticism, de Guaita still expressed a desireto have his horoscope cast by the occultist and clairvoyantEugeneLedos,thoughhe was reluctant to pay the fee required byLedos when, as hewroteto Peladan,he doubtedwhethertheresult would be as accurate as ahandwritinganalysis.At a certainpoint in the friendship de Guaita began to addresshis letters to'Merodack'and to sign himselflNebo'(a referenceto Nabu, the Babylonian godassociatedwith Mercury). In somecases these names are companied by the planetary sigils.Manyofthe letters are alsodottedwithotheresoteric signs: there areHebrewletters,Chi-Rhomonogramsand in one case an Indianlingam and yoni symbol, signifying sexual union. This is accom-panied by the question:' W hat news? Daphne?

Some light isthrownon this question by Baron Pirmin van den Bosch, who claimedthat he had been given by Huysmans a detailed accountofthelatter's researches into satanism.

There follows a longresumeofSwedenborg's lifeand doctrine.Becker then relates how oneofSwedenborg'smost ardentdiscipleswas a certainBaronSeraphitus,'TheBaron',he explains,'wasthe most ardent followeroftheSwedishprophetwho hadopened in him the eyesofthe InnerMan and had given him a longing for a lifeconformingto thehigher order.'

Shesoon quarrelledwithher fellow high priestess, Diana Vaughan,and things came to a head during aninitiationceremonyinPariswhenDiana refusedtoperforma partofthe ritualthatinvolvedspitting on a consecrated host and transfixing itwitha dagger. This led to Diana's leaving the original Palladiumand organising herown'Luciferains Independants etRegeneres'-anassociationwhichowedallegiance to Lucifer butnottoSatan. A'convent' was established inLondonand apropagandaorganisationset up underthe guidanceofDiana.Onz rst March1895appeared the first issueofa new periodicalentitledLePalladiumregenereetlibre-Directrice:MissDianaVaughan.In reality,ofcourse, it wasJogandwho had launchedthejournal.It enabledhimto lend credence to his story andalso, under the guiseofDiana Vaughan, to get in a few mis-chievous piecesofblasphemy.Thedoctrineofthe new sect, asoutlined in thejournal,was as follows.There aretwosupremebeingswhostruggle forsupremacy:Lucifer, theprincipleofintelligence andlight;and Adonai, the principleofmatterand death. Adonai is thecreatorofman's physical body, whileLucifer giveshim his intelligence andpowerofreproduction."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Satanistsandanti-Satanists2IIThesoul is an emanationofLuciferwhich Adonai seeks con-stantlyto seduce.

This event willbe followedby a yearofwar in which the Catholics will beexterminated.Thenwill come a celestialstrugglebetweenthetwo powers resulting in a victory for Lucifer and the banishingofthe defeatedones to the planet Saturn.Jogandmust have enjoyed concocting thishotch-potchofratherchildish blasphemy with its crude reversalsofthe tradi-tional good and bad attributions.

Then,with the greatestself-possession,he began to speak:'ReverendFathers, Ladies and Gentlemen:'I must firstofall offer my thanks to my colleagues and to theCatholic Presswhohave given support to my campaign duringthe past twelve years.'Butnow, in addressing myself to you, I must confess thatthat campaign is something quite different fromwhatyousupposed it to be.WhenDr. Bataille publishedLeDiableaudix-neuviemesiicleyou believed him to be devoted to the Catholiccause, and you believed that he was uncovering the dark secretsofMasonry .

Even my wifewasignorantofwhat I was really doing.WhenI repudiatedmy anti-clerical writings I had to be very careful. The Anti-clerical League, which I founded, expelled meonJuly27, 1885,for infamous conduct and treason against the society.

My friend Dr. Baudon is herethis evening I believe. He waswithme all the time I was inItaly, and knows that I never visited the Vatican, and he alsoknows that I saw muchofGeneral Canzio-Garibaldi, son-in-lawofthe great Garibaldi, and was loyal to the anti-clericals andthe republicans.

I convinced averyworthypriest, a simple soul, about this, and afterwards aJesuit who was formerly a military almoner and was a muchmore difficult proposition. He told me to practise the spiritualexercisesofSt. Ignatius. I knewnothingabout them, but I hadto study them so as to make the right impression.'All this happened after I hadwrittenmy book on Freemasonry.Therewas no mystification about that. I think Masonry isindebted to me for the serviceIdid it in publishing the rituals.It seems to me that enlightened Freemasons must find all thathocus-pocus ridiculous andwouldbe glad to see it suppressed.'This is by the way, and we mustreturnto the facts.

It is all verywell to say that I imposed upon the credulousnessofthese people.Theyforced me into it.

A chestofdrawers, which hadbeen pushed against the wall and coveredwitha red clothserved as an altar.Onit stood a champagne glass, a small platecontaining some hosts and a lighted candle in a candlestick.Onthe wall above the altar was pinned a clothembroideredwiththe four lettersoftheTetragrammaton,to the leftofwhich hung a framedportraitofVintras.The celebrant was barefooted and dressed in a long red chas-uble over which he wore a large cross madeofwhite cloth, thecross-pieceofwhich hung below his belly to symbolise'thecrucifixionofthe phallus'. He wasassistedby his wife, alsobarefoot, who was dressed in a white tunic and green cape.Onlytwootherworshippers were present.The priest began by reciting prayerswithhis wife givingtheresponses.Having invoked the Archangel Michael, hepoured some white wine into the champagne glass while hiswife filled another glass with redwine-whitewine apparentlywas a privilege reserved for the male priesthood.
