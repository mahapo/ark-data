GENIUS AND NUMEN* ... hinc ad vina redit faetus et alteris te mensis adhibet deum; te multa prece, te prosequitur mero de/usa pateris, et Laribus tuum miscet numen uti Graecia Castoris et magni memor Herculis. (Horace, Odes 4, 5, 31-36) The interpretation of this passage has led to protracted discussion. Horace's primary meaning is plain enough. Among the honours voted by a grateful senate on the victorious return of Oct avian from Actium was one of particular significance for the future development of the ruler cult. Henceforth libations I were to be poured to his genius at all banquets public and private.2 • Harvard Theological Revie w 62 (1969), 356-367 (revised). I For the accompanying acclamation see Ovid, Fasti 2, 637f.: et \"bene vos, bene te, patriae pater, optime Caesar\" / dicite suffu so per sacra verba mero; cf. Petroni us, Cena Trimalchionis 60, 7: rati ergo sacrum esse fe rl/lculum tam religioso apparatu perfusum, consurreximus altius et 'Augusto, patri patriae, fe liciter', diximus. In Petronius the acclamation comes before the dessert, in contrast to Horace's alteris mensis. Traces of the cups associated with the libation are published by V. von Gonzenbach, \" Genius Augusti-Theos Sebastos\" , Opuscula: Stockholm St. in Class. Arch. (Festschrift K. Kerenyi) 5 (1968), 81-117. For the Hellenistic background see K. Scott, \"The Deification of Demetrius Poliorcetes\", A JPhii49 (1928), 137-166 at 150ff.; W. W. Tarn, \"The Hellenistic Ruler-Cult and the Daemon\", JHS 48 (1928), 206-219 especially 21 1ff. S. R. F. Price, \"Gods and Emperors: The Greek Language of the Roman Imperial Cult\", JHS 104 (1984), 79-95 at 92, understands multa prece in the sense of a prayer to the emperor rather than an acclamation. 2 CD 51, 19, 7: ... \"rou� \"rE [EPEex� xext \"rOt� [EpE(ex� tV \"rexr� UltEP \"rE \"roo IhllLOU xext \"rij� �OUAij� EuXexr� xext Ultl.p tXtLVOU OILO(w� ti'XECl9exL, xext tV \"ror� ClUClClL\"r(OL� OUX O\"rL \"ror� XOLVOr� OtUOt xext \"ror� lo(OL� It(iV\"rex� exu\"r<j> '11tEVOELV tXEAEuClexV.

On this view, then, one must suppose that the senate in 30 B.C. decreed the same honour to Oct avian as that paid by the Athenians to Demetrius Polyorcetes and his favourites-one which Demochares at least places in the same category as altars and shrines; cf. Scott (above, note I) 150, 152 n. 69, citing Demochares ap. A then. 6, 252f.-253a. The more usual view is that, while the acclamation certainly refers to Augustus, the libation was technically to his genius, in which case the honour will have been in line with the establishment of a thanksgiving on his natalis, the chief festival of the genius (CD 51,19,2). So Wissowa, RuKR' 173, n. 5, 177 with n. 7; Taylor, Divinity 151,182, cf. A. D. Nock, Gnolllon 8 (1932), 514f.; I.

To the household Lares, figurines of which were set upon the table at mealtimes and received offerings of food, has now been added tuum numen-here surely the Genius Augusti. 4 In striking support of this we have the evidence of a painting from a private house at Pompeii. On one wall the genius of the paterfa milias is represented pouring a libation in the presence of members of his family, while a second genius on an adjoining wall, carefully preserved at the time the room was renovated, is likewise clad in a toga but holds a cornucopia as he pours a libation upon a lighted, cylindrical altar; below, evidently in explana­tion, is a graffito EX SC (elL 4, 5285). On the convincing interpretation of Mau, the second figure is that of the Genius Augusti and dates from soon after the senatorial decree of 30 B.C.5 There is no sign of the Lares, but the two pictures together certainly seem to reflect the admission of the emperor's genius into domestic cult. If so, what is of particular interest in Horace's stanza is that the Genius Augusti is here described as tuum numen.

Liebeschuetz, Continuity and Change in Roman Religion, Oxford, 1979, 68f. The only comparable use of \"ltEvOtw in Dio is in 62, 26, 4-a libation of blood to Zeus Eleutherios-but it is clear from other authors that the dative is regularly used of the deity to whom the libation is poured; cf. Liddle and Scott s.v. In any event the association of the emperor's genius with the libation seems clear from Horace, o.c. 34f. Dio is of course writing much later and the distinction between a man and his genius may not always have been safe: so Liebeschuetz 69; see also inscriptions attesting cultores Larum et imaginum Augusti (rather than genii AuguslI); cf. AlfOldi, Lorbeerbiiume 26, n. 109 with bibl. Taeger 42 takes the offering to Marius to have also been to his genius; cf. Taylor, Divinity 48, 151, n. 23; A. D. Nock, \"Synnaos Theos\", HSCP 41 (1930), 1-62 at I, n. 1 (= A. D. Nock led. Z. Stewart], Essays on Religion and the Ancient World, Oxford, 1972, I, 203, n.1)\" ... a private observance, not much beyond the limits of drinking healths\". Von Gonzenbach, I. c. follows Taylor, Divinity 264, in seeing a Hellenistic model in the customary libation to the ruler's daimon at mealtimes. See further Nock, Gnomon (above) ibid. l For the cult of the Lares see Wissowa, RuKR' 166ff.; D. G. Orr, Roman Domestic Religion: the Evidence of the Household Shrines\", ANRW 2, 16,2 (1978) 1557-1591 at 1563ff. with bibl. 4 So F. Bomer, \"Der Eid beim Genius des Kaisers\", Athenaeum 44 (1966),77-133 at 101, n. 55; cf. Alfoldi, Lorbeerbiiume 42. Mommsen's view that Horace refers to the Lares Augusti at the crossroads is untenable; cf. Niebling (above, note 2) 329 with refs.; Fraenkel, Horace 446. For the institution of this cult in 7 B.C. see \"Augustus and the West\", above, Vol. I, I, 84f. A connection is nevertheless clear from the circumstance that the reception of the emperor's genius into household cult in a sense pointed the way for the cult at the compita; also that in domestic cult twin Lares flank the genius of the paterfamilias, which now wears the toga praetexta appropriate to the Genius Augusti. See Wissowa o.c. 173; AlfOldi, Lorbeerbiiume 55f. ; Orr (above, note 3) 1568; D. P. Harmon, \"The Family Festivals of Rome\", ANRW 2, 16,2 (1978) 1592-1603 at 1595 .

Mau, Pompeii in Leben und Kunst', Leipzig, 1908,278, citing other possible instances; d. G. K.

(Ep. 2, I, 15f.) Mommsen took Horace to be alluding to the widespread practice of swearing by the Genius Augusti, now included in the oath formula with Jupiter Optimus Maximus and the Penates.6 The theory has been challenged by Weinstock, who supposes an early attempt to introduce an oath by the emperor's numen.' Yet a similar oath by the genius of Caesar had been introduced in 44 B.C. (CD 44,6, 1; 50, 1) and Tiberius' refusal to allow men to swear by his genius (CD 57, 8, 3) could well be consistent with his policy of opposing what he judged appropriate for Augustus alone.8 It is true that Gaius swore by the numen of his sister Drusilla (Suet., Cal. 24, 2), but she was dead and deified at the time and such an oath would be in line with the later practice of swearing by the numina of the divi;9 Gaius himself enforced the oath by his own genius (ibid. 27, 3), which then became standard procedure under later emperors. On the whole, then, the likeliest view is that Horace refers to the Genius Augusti in Ep . 2, 1, 16 exactly as in Odes 4 , 5, 34f. Both passages therefore illustrate that to employ numen of the emperor's genius is normal and acceptable usage. But a number of commentators have gone on to conclude that because the emperor's genius can perfectly well be called numen, therefore the Genius Augusti and the Numen Augusti are one and the same thing.lo This raises an important question central to the whole problem of the emperor's \"Divinity\". What the evidence strongly suggests is that on the contrary the two neither were nor ever could be wholly identical. II • Th. Mommsen, Romisches Staatsrecht, Leipzig, 1887 (1963), 2, 809; cf. Heinen (above, note 2) 160, n. 2; Taylor, Divinity 191f.; Liebeschuetz (above, note 2) 71f., noting that the oath by the emperor's genius probably arose spontaneously. 1 Weinstock, DJ 213; cf. ibid. n. 7 \"the first attempt to introduce the cult of the Numen Augusti\". This is surely unlikely at so early a date; see further below pp. 378f. • See \"Divus Augustus\", Vol. I, I, 158-163. Weinstock, ibid. n. 6 with refs., notes that the Greeks certainly swore by the Tyche of Augustus. For the later development see DJ 214. • See D.

The extent to which the two have been identified may be judged from YCS 7 (1940), 176, n. 822, where as evidence for the cult of the genius the editors quote an inscription set up by the cohors XX Palmyrenorum with the formula numini ac maies[tati eorum).

Caesar aram Divo] Aug(usto) patri dedicavit. (lnscrIt 13, 2, 115; cf. 401) Alfoldi argues persuasively that the ceremony took place in A.D. 6, when Tiberius was in Rome at this time of the year for the dedication of the temple of Castor and Pollux (CD 55, 27, 4_5).'3 Whatever the precise year may have been, a date about this time is of relevance for present purposes to the extent that it tells strongly against the possibility that Horace could have been referr­ing to the numen of Augustus twenty years or so earlier in Odes 4, 5, 34f. or Ep . 2, 1, 16. As for the associated rites, our knowledge is restricted to the men­tion of victims in the calendar. In itself this is little information on which to base any judgement of the relationship between the Numen Augusti and the Genius Augusti, so one must turn to whatever traces of the early cult of the numen survive outside of Rome. As it happens, these are remarkably few. An inscription from Lepcis Magna, dated 1st July-30th June A.D. 11-12, records that a local college of quindecemviri sacrorum dedicated to the emperor's numen a calchidicum (sic) and other structures, the costs of which were supported by Iddibal Caphada Aemilius, an imperial priest: numini imp(eratoris) Caesaris divij(i1i) Aug(usti) ... (lRT324).'4 Apart from attesting the appearance of the numen so soon in Tripolitania this offers no help. Equally unilluminating is a small (Augustan?) altar from Tarraco inscribed in Toutain and others have marked the opposition between the two notions en passant; cf. Etienne's refs., Culte imperial 315, to which add C. Koch, \"Gottheit und Mensch im Wandel der Romischen Staatsform\", in H.

By far the most important record is an inscription from Narbo attesting an altar to the Numen Augusti vowed on 22nd September, A.D. 11, and dedicated in AD 12/13: T. Statilio Taur[o] I L.

Certainly there are parallels. Incense and wine played an impor­tant role in the cult of the genius, and the offering of a victim to the genius of the living emperor is amply recorded in the Acta Fratrum A rvalium , though not before the time of Nero.19 Further, one of the main festivals at Narbo, 23rd-24th September (here as elsewhere a two-day feast), celebrates Augustus' birthday, which, of course, was the chief festival of the genius. Even so there are diff erences sufficient, in Taeger's opinion, to confirm that what is regulated here is a new and separate cult. 20 In particular the cult has \" See in general M.

The decisive point arises in any case from an inscription of A.D. 18, attesting the decision of Forum Clodii to institute rites associated with an altar to the Numen Augustum (CIL 11, 3303 = ILS 1 54), a term surely to be taken as a variant on Numen Augusti,22 rather than as attesting an independent divinity.23 As at Narbo, the natalis of Augustus is celebrated on 22nd and 23rd September by the sacrifice of vic­tims, and on the birthday of Tiberius a calf shall be sacrificed; but the key clause is II. 10-12; et ut natalibus Augusti et Ti. Caesarum, prius quam ad vescendum \\ decuriones irent, thure et vino genii eorum ad epulandum ara \\ numinis Augusti invitarentur \\. If the genii of Augustus and Tiberius have to be invited to dine at the altar of the Augustan numen, clearly the Genius Augusti cannot be identical with the Numen Augusti. 24 This in turn surely implies a distinction between the two at Narbo also. 21 Cf. 11. 29-31 (principal face): ... quod ea die ... iudicia p/ebis decurionibus coniunxit ... , with the commentary of Kneissl (above, note 16) 301-306. \" This conclusion is imposed by the sheer weight of statistics. Throughout the whole of the second century, which is when the cult of the numen really begins, and into the early part of the third there occurs no certain example of numini Augusto. Instead, the form in all cases where the formula is given in full is numini Augusti or numinibus Augustorum (AEpig, 1965, no. 195 is misprinted). It is true that the full form of the singular occurs relatively seldom, but Augusti can often be deduced with certainty from some accompanying epithet or from the emperor's actual name. Hence, when some abbreviation is used (as in CIL 3, 3487 below), analogy surely requires that one expand numini Aug(ustl) or Aug(ustorum). Otherwise, there are perhaps five examples of the term in the first century; the inscription at Forum Clodii attesting the form numini Augusto (A.D. 18); the earlier altar at Narbo to the Numen Augusti (A .D. 1 1112); so also CIL 4, 3882 (= ILS 5146); CIL 13, 389; RIT 48: numini August(l). Given that the adjectival form at Forum Clodii is therefore unique, it may best be viewed as simply a variant found at a time before the personal form Augusti had become the stereotype. 21 Contra Taylor (above, note 12) 189, who suggests that the Numen Augustum was \"a collec­tive divinity which included the genii of the emperor and the prospective heir to the succession and perhaps too the Juno of the empress\". But there appears to be no other evidence than this inscription for a Numen Augustum which on Taylor's interpretation would be something dif­ferent from the Numen Augustil Augustorum. In the second and third centuries Augusti (usually abbreviated) always denotes the living emperor, just as Augustorum denotes either the living emperors or the living emperor(s) in conjunction with the dead. It seems very probable, however, that the reference at Forum Clodii is to the numen not of Tiberius but of Augustus himself, in which case the fact that in A.D. 18 Augustus was already four years dead may account for the use of the impersonal adjectival form. The suggestion that the Numen Augustum includes the genii of Augustus and Tiberius is perhaps based on the invitation extended to these to dine at the altar on the natalis of Augustus and Tiberius. But, if the Numen Augustum were in fact a collec­tive divinity of the kind suggested, then the altar at Forum Clodii was in part at least dedicated to the genii of Augustus and Tiberius, since these are included in the Numen Augustum. In that case would these have had to be invited to dine at the altar in which they shared? One would have thought that the clause in II. 11-13 rather implied that the genii of the emperor and his heir were, so to speak, outsiders invited to an altar dedicated to a distinct, though closely associated, con­cept. That the genii of Augustus and Tiberius should on their feast-days be \"commemorated\" in this way at the altar of the Numen Augustum is reasonable enough, especially if Augustum refers to Augustus himself. ,. Taeger, ibid."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"GENIUS AND NUMEN 381 Further evidence confirms and corroborates this conclusion. An occasional inscription, for example, records a dedication to both the numen and the genius of the same person. Thus a stone from Bourges, the text of which is not entirely certain, seems to attest both the numen and genius of Lucius Caesar: n(umini) et I g(enio?) L.(?) Ca I esari(s) [.] Rufinius Adnam(etus) Africani I f(i/ius) I d(edit) d(edicavit) (IL TG 160) . To ascribe numen to Lucius Caesar is rare but understandable in view of his position as Augustus' heir.2l With this may be compared a dedication from Aquincum which the college of Augustales set up in A.D. 138: numini Aug. et I genio imp. Caes. T. Ae[/.] I Hadr. Antonini ... (ClL 3, 3487). Here Aug. may be singular, in which case it refers to Hadrian, or plural, in which case it includes the living emperor along with past emperors collectively. 26 On either interpretation both the numen and the genius of Hadrian would seem to be joint but separate reci­pients of cult. If, then, numen means exactly the same as genius, it may fairly be asked why in both inscriptions two different words are used to denote one and the same thing.27 The second text brings out a further point concerning the later development of both cults. Although inscriptions occasionally show that the dead can have a genius, sharply distinguished from the manes,28 it is consistently the genius/genii of the living emperor(s) that is the object of cult, not the genii of deified emperors.29 Dedications to the numina Augustorum, on the other hand, are to be interpreted as denoting the numina either of joint emperors, or (more commonly) of all emperors, the present emperor(s) in company with past emperors. 30 This again points to a fundamental distinction between the Genius Augusti and the Numen Augusti. What the evidence suggests, then, is that as far as one can tell from the actual ritual of the cults, genius and numen seem to have been recognized as distinct and separate concepts. If so, this can only be a practical reflection of the fundamental distinction between the two at the theoretical or theological level.

What should emerge is how it comes about that the Genius Augusti can be called numen while clearly being distinct from the Numen Augusti. For the purposes of the present discussion the most significant aspect of the genius32 is that it was conceived as something not internal but external to a man: his comes, guiding star, or spiritual companion, under whose tutela he lived.33 Whether it was imagined as a man's own procreative force or the force that begat him is debatable, but the earliest references in literature make it abundantly clear that the genius is a divinity, much resembling the Greek OCXLfLwII, which was worshipped along with other deities such as the Lares, Penates, Manes and Olympian Gods.34 One prays to one's genius, swears by it, and makes offerings to it-usually of unmixed wine, flowers, cakes or incense - particularly on birthdays, the high festival of the genius. With the generalization of the original concept not just humans but places, buildings, towns, groups of men or things, even the Roman people3s or the Senate were thought to have a genius, which sometimes was identified with a particular god - Hercules or Apollo, for example. Gods, too, were on occasion credited with a genius, though naturally the genius of a god would be overshadowed 31 Further discussion in \"Augustan Blessings and Virtues\", below, pp. 465-471. 12 See Otto's authoritative treatment (above, note 28) 1155-70; further Dar.-Sag. 2, 2 (1896) (1963) 1488·1494; Wissowa, RuKR' 175 -181; Cesano (above, note 19) 449·81; A.

As a result, the genius is often represented artistically in corporeal form.36 Thus the genius of a place or dwelling (elL 9, 1545; 10, 378 et passim) appears in literature as a snake; whereas statues, reliefs and wall­paintings portray the genius of a man as a Roman clad in toga with cor­nucopia and sacrificial vessel, often in the act of sacrificing. This is the form of the famous \"Genius Augusti\" in the Sala Rotonda of the Vatican Museum (PI. LXXV b).37 In contrast numen was in origin a very different concept. 38 Numen is a dif­ficult word to translate; perhaps the nearest is \"power\" or, as Rose put it, \"a result of the existence of power\". 39 As such, it seems to belong among the oldest Roman religious concepts, though the word itself is first attested in Accius.40 By the Augustan period numen can be attributed to a wide variety of things-in fact anything, inanimate as well as animate, considered to have this special property: a fo untain, a tree, a boundary-stone, a place, a poet, the emperor. But preeminently numen is the functional property of a god and therefore akin to vis divina, sanctitudo.

If this is not simply a plural created for metrical purposes,42 it presumably means the various ways in which the god manifests power or activity. The most interesting develop­ment from the point of view of the ruler cult is that under the late Republic numen began to be applied to the human understanding (Lucretius 3, 144) or to an association of humans: thus Cicero uses numen of the senate (Phil. 3, 32; cf. Livy 7, 30, 20), the Roman people (Or. post red. ad Quir. 8, 18) or the Pontifices (De domo sua 39, 104). It was a relatively short step from this to attribute numen to individual humans, the living Octavian or Augustus.43 Crucial to the main point at issue, however, is that in Augustan literature and later numen began to be used not only to denote the essential property of a god but by a metonomy the god or divinity himself; that is, from meaning the impersonal property of a god numen can now denote a personal god or divinity.44 In this sense the name of the god is sometimes found in simple apposition (luppiter numen), sometimes in adjectival form (numen Idaeum, numen Herculaneum). By a further extension numenlnumina can be used absolutely to denote the god or divinities in general who dwell in a particular locality denominated by a pendant genitive. Thus inscriptions refer to the numina castrorum and Tacitus calls the Eagles propria legionum numina (Ann. 2, 17, 2). It is significant, too, that when numen denotes a personal god, one can in this sense speak of the genius numinis, whereas there seems to be no example at all of numen genii. 45 Why this should be so is difficult to say. Perhaps the reason is that the genius was a minor divinity that never evolved into a fully developed deity. Both the original and the derivative sense of numen bear directly on our problem. When Horace applies the term to the emperor's genius in Odes 4, 5,34f., he is clearly using numen in the later, developed sense of a divinity. A simple proof of this may be advanced. If correct, it would follow that the Lares could also be termed numina in precisely the same sense. Ovid does in fact do this: Mille Lares Geniumque ducis qui tradidit ilIos, urbs habet et vici numina trina colunt (Fasti 5, 145f.)\" 42 Cf. Weinstock (above, note 38) I. c. ; Fasciano (above, note 38) 259, n. 10, 268ff. 4.' For examples see J. R. Fears, Princeps a Diis Electus: The Divine Election of the Emperor as a Political Concept at Rome (MAAR 26), Rome, 1977, 179, n. 74. On the attribution of numen to the emperor see Niebeling (above, note 2) 329f. \" Rose (above, note 39) aptly compares the modification of \"Providence\" from impersonal to personal.

The two passages are not wholly parallel since, as already stated, the Lares of Odes 4, 5, 33f. are clearly the household gods, but mutatis mutandis the point holds good for either case. Furthermore, it is reasonable enough that Horace should use numen of the Genius Augusti in Ep . 2, 1, 15f. since for purposes of oath-taking the emperor's genius ranked alongside Jupiter Optimus Maximus et al (above, p. 377). But numen used of the Genius Augusti in this sense is something very different from the Numen Augusti. For it is patently in the original sense of a property that numen can be attributed to the living emperor; this is why, for example, there are no pictures of the Numen Augusti. 47 The best proof of the point, however, is that with the single exception of the Forum Clodii inscription (above, p. 380) one never finds numen Augustum,48 and under no circumstances numen AugustuS:49 instead the usage is (almost) always numen Aug(ustl) or, when multiple emperors became the fashion, numina Augg(ustorum). The same applies to the very fre­quent dedications to the numina of all emperors, past and present included, even when, as is normal in Africa, a singular numen is attributed to all emperors comprehensively;50 in all cases the genitive surely implies that numen is a property of the single, multiple or collective Augusti, and there seems to be nothing to support the thesis of E. Beaudoin that the Numen Augusti, though certainly abstract, was conceived as a sort of divinity distinct from the emperor and having an existence of its own.5 I On the other hand, the fact that the ' 'divine power\" of the emperor can be the recipient of prayers and sacrifices as at Narb052-where the intention is that the Numen Augusti shall be volens and propitium (elL 12, 4333: ll. 33f. , lateral face)-certainly seems to show that it was conceived as a divinized abstraction to be treated in the same way as a traditional god,53 though immanent in the emperor rather than concomitant like the Genius Augusti. 54 47 Cf. Kunckel, Genius (above, note 10) 23 . .. See above, note 23 . .. For a poetical example of Augustum numen see Ovid, Pont. 3, I, 163: e quibus ante omnes Augustum numen adora. The easiest interpretation here is that numen is in apposition to Augustus (\"Augustus, the deity\"); cf. Fasciano (above, note 38) 288, n. 165. This seems con­firmed by 3, I, 97f.: numen adorandum est, non ut mihifiat amicum / sed sit ut iratum quam fuit ante, minus; cf. 4, 6, 10: numen ad Augustum supplice voce loque. Possibly Ovid's wife, whom he tells to perform acts of cult to Augustus, Tiberius and Livia (3, I, 161-164), had statuettes corresponding to Ovid's own (4, 9, 105-110).

Both genius and numen can be applied equally well to so many things-gods, men, localities, towns, human associations-that one suspects the two were often enough considered simply as synonyms. 56 A case in point is CIL 3, 7435 (= ILS 1856): I. O.M. I et num. Aug. n. I et p(ub/ici} p(ortorii} ... (A.D. 182). On Pfister's interpretation numen portorii denotes \"die pers6nlich gedachte Gottheit\" which dwells in the portorium. 51 Yet neither Pfister nor anyone else would want to claim that numen Aug(ustl) means a deity of this kind dwelling in the emperor, nor surely would anyone want to credit the property of numen to the public portorium in the same sense as to the emperor. Given that the inscription was found at Nicopolis (Moesia Inferior), a more likely solution would be that numen was considered more or less synonymous with genius and the text simply saved a word com­pared with CIL 3, 7434 (= ILS 1855), an earlier dedication from the same place: Numini Augustor. et genio p(ub/ici} p(ortorii} ... (A.D. 161/8). But it would be illegitimate to conclude that genius and numen are identical concepts simply because some particular inscription happens to blur theological niceties. It remains to assess the significance-religious, theological and constitu­tional-of this fundamental step from genius to numen. As we have seen, the cult of the Genius Augusti attributed to the princeps the shadowy, guardian spirit which every man had and to which every man could make offerings. 58 That of the emperor was inevitably of special concern since it was vital to ensure the protection of the monarch who was so necessary to the well-being of the world.59 But to pay cult to the Numen Augusti was worship of a very different order. 60 For it was no longer the emperor's divine comes but a divine property (one might almost say the divine property) immanent within him that was the object of rites and the effect can only have been to focus attention more sharply on the person of the living emperor and to enhance the charisma Augusti or specializations of the concomitant Genius Augusti.

H. 2, 18).64 To credit Augustus with numen is the highest honour possible. But this did not make Augustus a god, any more than Cicero made gods of the senate or the Roman people in attributing to them numen. In strictly theological terms Augustus now became a 9ErO� (Xv�P, an inspired man, one with deity in him, and the emperor's \"divinity\" must be understood not as the conferring of divine nature upon Augustus but rather as the working of divinity through the agency of the human emperor. 65 Augustus himself never made the ultimate step from manhood to godhead, from possessing numen to being a numen; even after Tiberius dedicated the Ara Numinis Augusti he still needed cae/estes honores.66 From the point of view of the constitution, on the other hand, the cult of the numen set Augustus on the highest eminence to which humans could aspire: exce/sissimum generis humanijastigium, to borrow from Pliny again (N.H., Praej. 11). The fact that he accepted this \"superman\" status towards the very end of his reign is doubtless an indication that he felt politically safer than thirty years before. At all events it marks a distinct development in Augustus' own thinking and contrasts sharply with the psychological background to the settlements of 27 and 23 B.C.

NUMINA AUGUSTORUM* Shortly before the death of Augustus, Tiberius dedicated the celebrated Ara Numinis Augusti, thus formally enshrining the numen of Augustus within the Imperial Cult.' The step was a radical one, fundamental to the whole develop­ment of the emperor's \"divinity\". Whereas the cult of the emperor's genius had continued a traditional Republican practice,2 to ascribe numen to the princeps was to establish Augustus as a 9Eto� cXv�p, through whom divinity could function as an intermediary.3 For to pay cult to the Numen Augusti was to ascribe to the human emperor the quintessential property of a god.4 The cult of the numen seems, however, to have been slow in establishing itself as a popular form of worship and to have been restricted in the areas where it took hold. S In the north-east and the east it occurs rarely, apart from the late formula devotus numini maiestatique eiusl eorum, 6 and is attested only to a very limited extent in Africa, where numini Augustorum gives way in the third century to D.N.M. Q.E. 7 Spain has produced scores of examples of the devotus formula, yet extremely few direct dedications.8 But in Narbonensis and more especially in the Celtic provinces of the north-west evidence for the worship of the Imperial numen is very great indeed. In no other quarter of the Roman world, in fact, does the Imperial numen appear so frequently in dedications of the widest variety. The major concern here is with the form the cult took and what exactly this implies. In the vast majority of cases dedications are made to the Numina • Classical Quarterly 20 (1970), 191-197.

First, a look at the problem in the context of the ruler cult as a whole within the general area of the Celtic World. It is important to observe that in the Oauls, the Oermanies and Britain emperor worship was something different from what it was in the Romanized provinces of the West. In Narbonensis, Baetica and Proconsularis, fo r example, a great deal was originally left to local initiative and the establishment of an official provincial cult deferred until the time of Vespasian.12 But in newly pacified territories the cult per­fo rmed the important role of focusing loyalty on the person of the emperor and helped to further the process of Romanization; hence its installation at • On the expansion of the various abbreviations and the general nature of the cult in Britain see \"The Imperial Numen in Roman Britain\", below, pp. 397-422.

It may also be true of the centre at Camulodunum, where (whatever the technical status of the temple) there is the possibility of an earlier altar cult that will presumably have been to the living Claudius-doubtless with Roma; though so far there is no trace of the goddess here. I. One would suppose that it also held true for the abortive foun­dation at Ara Ubiorum in the Rhineland, not that anything definite has accrued to prove a cult of Roma and the living emperor. I 5 By the end of Hadrian's reign the situation had altered at Lyon to the extent that a temple had been added and past emperors were now included in the worship, apparently both at the altar and at the temple.I6 Towards the close of the second century, however, it would appear that the altar was once again reserved for the living emperor(s), whereas both past and present rulers shared in the temple cult. I 7 This is the period when dedications to the Numina Augustorum become plentiful on the continent, though occasional inscrip­tions may be earlier. In Britain, on the other hand, the cult of the Numina Augustorum begins in the surviving evidence in ca. A.D. 133-7 (RIB 824f.). Since at least six and perhaps twice as many inscriptions of this type are dated before A.D. 161-that is, before the first reign of double emperors-it is clear that deified emperors must certainly be included in the cult. Yet Britain remained what it was, a distant outpost of dubious loyalty, and it is significant that in the second century as in the third such abstractions as Imperial Virtus, Victoria, Fortuna and Disciplina, which can only refer to the living ruler or rulers, occur relatively frequently in military dedications. IS By the early third century the pendulum had swung the other way once again and the emphasis was now on the numenlnumino of the living emperor(s) to the exclusion of the past. A somewhat similar development is observable at this time on the north-west frontier. In Belgica and the Germanies the cult of the Numina Augustorum is less frequently attested than in Aquitania and Lugdunensis, and again mainly in the late-second and early-third centuries, when there are 1) See \"Roma et Augustus\", above, Vol. I, I, pp. 97-130. 14 \"Templum Divo Claudio constitutum\", above, Vol. 1, 2, pp. 200f.

Significantly, there are no dedications in this area set up to the numina by soldiers, though the devotus formula was popular enough in military cult. The score or so instances of D.N.M. Q.E. that have come to light are, how­ever, third-century and, of course, relate specifically to the numen of the liv­ing emperor or his house. What appears to have replaced the numina as the main facet of the Imperial cult in this region is the domus divina.'9 Inscrip­tions in honour of the Imperial house occur in very great numbers-all told close to 100 by soldiers and more than 250 by civilians, with far more in Belgica and the Germanies than in Aquitania and Lugdunensis. Once again the bulk of examples date from the first half of the third century, relatively few coming from the second. The picture that emerges from the inscriptions, then, is that in the first cen­tury and the third the main emphasis of the ruler cult in the Celtic world was emphatically on the living emperor. In the second century and to some extent in the third the divi certainly had their place in the cult, but at no stage and in no province of the north-west is there any possibility that deified emperors would have been paid cult to the exclusion of the living. Even in older prov­inces such as Tarraconensis the living emperor and Roma had been added to the earlier cult of the divi under Vespasian,2° and when this was the trend in the Romanized west it is impossible to think that the divi would ever have eclipsed the living emperor in Britain, Gaul, or the Germanies. As a result, the general development of the ruler cult makes it a priori most unlikely that Augustorum could have denoted past emperors exclusively whenever the plural does not seem to indicate multiple reigning emperors (A ugg/ Auggg). Indeed to exclude the numen of the living ruler would have almost amounted to a rejection of his legitimacy. Such a situation is inconceivable at times when dynasties tended to be short-lived. Could then numinibus Aug.! Augustorum apply solely to living emperors, even without reduplication of the G? Such is certainly the view of some recent commentators, who on this basis have attributed inscriptions bearing the for­mula to the reigns of double emperors of the second and third centuries.21 For a decisive answer one may turn to the arguments of E. Meyer, who in a series of articles had demonstrated that Augustorum frequently occurs in inscrip­tions that are earlier than the first double reign (therefore before A.D. 161), and hence must refer to successive emperors or emperors in general, past as \" For analysis of the term see \"Domus Divino\", below, pp. 423-435. ,. \"Flomen Augustorum\", above, Vol. I, 2, pp. 276f. \" So M.

In Hither Spain, for example, the titlesflomen Aug(ustorum), f/amen Romae et Aug(ustorum), f/amen divorum Augustorum, and flamen divorum et Augustorum all occur within the Flavian-Trajanic period and must therefore be considered simply as variants, all of which denote a provincial priest charged with one and the same form of cult. Since Roma is normally associated with the living Augustus, it would appear that from the time of Vespasian onwards the provincial cult at Tarraco included Roma and the liv­ing emperor along with deified past emperors. Hence Augustorum must embrace both past and present Augusti: for at this period Augusti cannot denote mUltiple emperors reigning jointly and successive rulers are ruled out by the fact that a provincial priest served only one year. Similarly at Lyon, the priestly titles suggest that the cult of Roma and the living emperor at the great altar became that of Roma and the Augusti shortly before the erection of the temple, which served only the expanded worship. One at least of these inscriptions (ClL 13, 1706) looks datable by its lettering well before A.D. 161; more securely, the construction of the temple itself can be tentatively assigned to the period beween A.D. 121 and ca. A.D. 130-36. It thus becomes impos­sible to take Augusti in the sense of two living rulers, and successive rulers can be excluded for the same reason as at Tarraco. Finally, in the late-second and third centuries a further change is reflected in the title sacerdos ad arom Caesoris nostrilCaesarum nostrorum apud templum Romae et Augustorum. This can only mean that the altar was reserved for the living ruler or rulers whereas the temple was dedicated to Roma and the Augusti. But by the Augusti is surely meant, as in the second century, the divi with the inclusion of the living emperor(s), since to limit Augusti to the divi now that the altar catered solely for the living ruler(s) is surely to impose a different interpreta­tion on templum Romae et Augustorum in the third century from the one it bore in the second.24 Here again, therefore, Augustorum denotes emperors in general; nor is there any obvious contradiction in holding that, whereas the \" id., \"Augusti\", Chiron 5 (1975), 393-402 with refs in n. 2. \" Cf. \"F/amen A ugustorum\" , pp. 274f.; \"The Severi and the Provincial Cult of the Three Gauls\", pp. 326f. \" Kornemann, \"Herrscherkulte\" 109.

Thirdly, can one demonstrate from individual inscriptions that numina Augustorum includes the numina of both past and present rulers? One negative point in favour of this view is that numini Aug./numinibus Augg. (or a variant) never occur in conjunction with numinibus Aug. While this does not necessarily prove that the numenlnumina of the living emperor(s) is included in numina Aug., it would certainly prove that numinibus Aug. is restricted to deified rulers, if the two ever appeared together in the same dedication. Furthermore, CIL 8, 5177 is one text at least that lends support to the general thesis by explicitly linking the numen of the living emperor with the numina of deified emperors in a common dedication: numini divor. 1 Augustorum 1 sacr. et 1 imp. Caes. divi Traliani Parthic. f 1 divi Ner. nep. Tra 1 iani Hadrian. 1 Aug ... (Zattara, A.D. 121).2s In the great majority of dedications, however, one is confronted with the simple formula numinibus Augustorum (or an abbreviation), with the result that any conclusions can be based only on the general content of the inscription. An occasional text offers reasonable possibilities for analysis: for example, CIL 13, 1752 (= ILS 4132): I I I I I Inuminib. Aug. totiusque 1 domus divinae et situ [sic] c. C. c. 1 Aug. Lugud. 1 tauribolium [sic] lece 1 runt dendrophori 1 Luguduni consistentes I ... (Lyon, A.D. 190) (PI. LXXVI a). Since this is a taurobolium, it almost certainly began with the pro salute formula: the editors supply pro salute Imp. Caes. M. Aureli Commodi Antonini Aug. Now with the pro salute formula one commonly finds et domus divinaeltotiusque domus divinae immediately following the emperor's name, often with that of specific members of his family; that is, the dedication is made for the salus of the emperor, his wife and/or near relatives, and all Divine House.26 Here the emphasis is wholly on the living: there would be no point in concerning oneself for the welfare of dead members of the imperial house.27 Sometimes, too, pro salute is coupled with devotus numini eius; that is, the numen of the living emperor; cf. CIL 13, 6549: [pro] sa[l]u[t(e)] im[p(eratoris) 1 Sev]eri colle 1 [giu]m iuvent 1 [ut]i(s) devotissi 1 [m]i numini eiu 1 [s] sacrant ... But in elL 13, 1752 we have numinib(us) Aug(ustorum) sandwiched between pro salute and the genitive of the Divine House. One possibility is that the wording is jumbled and the formula totiusque domus divinae is to be taken as following in sense after the emperor's name. If so, it is difficult to think that a taurobolium on behalf of the salus of the reigning emperor and all his family \" Cf. Th. Mommsen, Hermes 19 (1884), 232, n. 3. \" Cf. elL 12, 1782; 13, 1753f. ; 14, 41; 8, 8203 (= ILS 4130, 4133-6). 27 For pro salute domus divinae see RIB 91; elL 13, 5042. That the emphasis is on living members of the ruling house is even clearer in the rare formula pro salute et incolumitate d. d. (cf. elL 13, 520). See further \"Domus Divina\", below, pp. 427ff."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"394 BOOK II could appear alongside a dedication to the Numina Augustorum, from which was excluded the key numen of the reigning emperor. The other interpretation would be to take -que at its face value as linking totius with Aug(ustorum) in the sense of a dedication to the numina of the Augusti and all the Divine House. In that case it is impossible to believe that Augustorum does not include the present emperor. The formula \"and of all the Divine House\" surely implies a prior mention of some specific member or members, a series that in all cases begins with the emperor himself;28 hence the common expan­sion of the formula to totiusque domus divinae eiusl eiorum or variant; cf. RIB 897,919, 2066 et passim. In this instance, then, the living emperor must be included under Augustorum (the date precludes the possibility of joint emperors), for otherwise one would have a dedication to the numina of dead emperors and of other members of the Divine House-excluding (apparently) the emperor himself. To all appearances, therefore, the altar commemorating the taurobolium performed by the dendrophori who had their locale at Lugdunum would appear to have been dedicated: \"[For the welfare of the Emperor Caesar Marcus Aurelius Commodus Antoninus Augustus], to the divinities of the Augusti (the divi and Commodus) and of all the divine house, and for the [prosperityJ29 of the colony Copia Claudia Augusta at Lugdunum ... \" One would think the same interpretation, that the Augusti include the living emperor, applies to numinibus A ug(ustorum) et dom(us) div(inae), for example; cf. CIL 12, 2596.30 There remain one or two hard cases which might seem to jeopardize the conclusions reached above. A dedication from Nescania in Baetica, for exam­ple, reads: numini divorum Augg. I C. Publicius Fortunatus I Iiber[t]us m(unicipii) F(lavii) Nesca[niensis] I aram solo pub(lico) I s(ua) p(ecunia) d. d. d. (ClL 2, 2009). At first sight it might appear that this was a dedication to the numina of divinized emperors and that here was one text where the liv­ing emperor's numen was certainly not included. Two considerations strongly suggest that this inference would be false. In the first place C. Publicius For­tunatus was a freedman of the Flavian municipality of Nescania. Whatever the precise date of the inscription may have been, then, it was certainly Fla­vian or post-Flavian. Now under Vespasian a provincial cult for Baetica was established at Corduba, the object of which was in all probability the living emperor in conjunction with the divi, who had already been paid municipal cult under the lulio-Claudians.31 The interesting point is that, in nine out of the sixteen cases we have, the title of the provincial priest of Baetica is given 28 See Calza's lists, Diz. Epig. 2, 3 (1910) (1961) 2063. \" Reading statu for situ; ef. Dessau ad loc., n. 2. 10 The point still holds if the sense is rather numinibus Aug(ustorum) et dom(ui) div(inae) (ef.

As argued earlier, this title is synony­moUS with Jlamen divorum et Augustorum and, first appearances to the con­trary, does not imply a cult of the divi to the exclusion of the living emperor. 32 Equally striking is that CIL 2, 2344 (Trajan) and AEpig (1966) no. 181 (A.D. 191) both attest the formulaJlamen divorum Augg., which in neither case can denote joint ruling emperors. While there is nothing to show that the double G is deliberately intended to signal the inclusion of the living emperor, it is clear that divorum Augg. in the titles of provincial priests certainly does not denote past emperors exclusively. It may therefore be suggested that the for­mula divorum Augg. in the Nescania text may echo or even be consciously modelled on the formula commonly employed at the provincial centre. If so, in this case too divorum Augg. must include the living emperor with the divi.33 An objection to this might be that in the Zattara inscription (above, p. 393) numini divorum Augustorum certainly denotes deified emperors exclusively since the numen of Trajan is explicitly mentioned in addition. Yet this text is hardly comparable with the Nescania dedication. For one thing the most com­mon form of dedication in Africa is numini Augustorum and there are no African examples of dedications numini divorum Augustorum tout court;3' for another, in contrast to Baetica or Tarraconensis, the titles of the provin­cial priests of Africa ([lamen/ sacerdos p. A ... ) do not attest any currency for the formula divorum Aug. Indeed, taken as a whole, the Zattara text rather supports the thesis that, in the cult of the numen, dedications are made to the numen/numina either of the present emperor or emperors or of both past and present emperors, never of past emperors alone.35 Nevertheless it does not follow that numina divorum Augustorum must in every context be taken to include the living emperor. A wooden tablet from Egypt, for example, reads: ... iuravitque per I(ovem) O(ptimum) M(aximum) I et numina divorum Augustorum I geniumque Imp. Caesaris Traiani I Hadriani Augusti ...

If, then, one considers that this formula is unique in the Celtic world, that the evidence overwhelmingly favours the view that the numen of the living emperor is included in the numina Auguslorum, and that in Baetica and Tarraconensis divorum Aug. includes the living empero':' in any case, it is difficult to think that the Keynsham stone is an isolated exam­ple of a dedication to the numina of past emperors exclusively. Where this for­mula came from (had G. Indutius Felix encountered it in Spain, for example?) it would be idle to speculate, but all analogy suggests that here, too, the divi Augusti include the living emperor, Antoninus Pius (?)39 Certainly it would be illegitimate to conclude either from this text or from the Nescania inscription that cult was normally paid to the divinities of past emperors exclusively. The verdict stands that, wherever one encounters dedications to the Numina Augustorum, the Augusti should be understood to include the liv­ing emperor along with the divi.40 J7 For the development of the formula see, for example, AEpig (1973) no. 138; (1974) no. 274.

THE IMPERIAL NVMEN IN ROMAN BRIT AIN* With the welcome appearance of The Roman Inscriptions oj Britain, Vol. I: Inscrip.ions on Stone, by R. G. Collingwood and R. P. Wright, the major part of the epigrapbical evidence for the Roman presence in Britain has at last been clearly and conveniently assembled under one cover. An Index, compiled by R. Goodburn and H. Waugh, I now gives easy access to the numerous black and white drawings of the stones and their texts and it is a comparatively light task to add later inscriptions published in the annual report of the Journal oj Roman Studies from 1955 to 1969 and from 1970 onwards in Britannia. The following remarks have been occasioned by a survey of British inscriptions attesting the worship of the Imperial numen. They are not concerned, except incidentally, with the religious doctrine underlying this concept. 2 The main purpose is rather to consider some of the epigraphical problems resulting from the various ways in which the cult of the numen is recorded in order to establish a basis on which to discuss the nature and significance of this par­ticular form of worship in Britain. 1. The Numen oj the Emperor Let us begin with a fundamental assumption. This is that to one emperor can be attributed one numen and one numen only. The principal scholar to maintain the contrary, namely that several numina can be attributed to one emperor, was D. M. Pippidi, whose remark \" ... bon nombre d'inscriptions portent numinibus Augusti ... \" has been responsible for a good deal of confu­sion on the point. 3 In a recent paper J. Deininger has rightly emphasized that the key inscription on which this thesis turns is EphEp 7, 946 (= RIB 611) (PI LXXVII a), a dedication on an altar found at Kirkby Lonsdale but now lost, the text of which is very much in doubt. 4 The version given by Pippidi from De Ruggiero, Diz.Epigr. 1, 518 reads [Nu]minibus [August]i et [Gemlo col­legii [A]pollinis ... , which is based on W.

Whatever the original text may have been (see below, p. 420), it may be observed at once that numinib(us) Augusti is a form of dedication without parallel elsewhere in the Empire.6 As F. Pfister has shown,7 only in poetry can the plural numina be attributed to a single god or (more rarely) an emperor, a usage which may well have been invented to suit the requirements of hexametric poetry;8 cer­tainly there are no instances where several numina of some particular deity are epigraphically attested in dedications. With Roman emperors the rule is clear enough: one emperor, one numen.9 The conclusion to be drawn from this is fundamental to the following discussion. Whenever numinibus is written in 6 A possible exception is CIL 8, 1357, 1.6 (= ILS 679: Testur, A.D. 31617): ... co/(onia) Bisica Lucana devota numinibus I maiestatique eius; but the inscription is known only from a nineteenth-century copy of dubious quality in M. Hoffmann, Index gramm. ad Africae ... titu/os Lat., Strasbourg, 1878, 105. It is true that most of the other British inscriptions which Pippidi cites (CIL 7, 83, 87, 239, 506, 638, 639, 640, 755 = RIB 235, 193, 656, 1330 [not 1368!), 1584, 1585, 1586, 1786) do in fact appear in the Index of CIL 7, p. 33 1, s.v. numina Augusti. But in not a single case is Augusti written in full: only the abbreviation Aug. The same point applies to CIL 8, 9040; 12,2224; 13, 1318, which Pippidi also cites in support of his thesis. Furthermore, in none of the British inscriptions above does RIB give the expansion numinibus Aug(usti) (there is a misprint in 656; see below, p. 419). Instead, we have the form numinibuslnumini(bus) Aug(ustorum): that is, in reading [nu) minib(us) [A u)g(usti) in 611 RIB breaks its own normally correct practice. Similarly the supplements to CIL 7 in EphEp correctly expand numinibus I numinib(us) Aug. to numinib(us) Aug(ustorum); cf. Deininger, (above, note 4) 140, n. 22 quoting EphEp 7, 505; 9, 742. , RE, 17,2 (1937) 1277f., 1283. For numina with a single emperor, see Verg., Georg. I, 30; Statius, Silv., 3, 3, 183f.; 4, 4, 57 and 8, 61f; 5, 2, 154. • Cf. Weinstock in JRS 39 (1949), 167; D. Fasciano, \"Le numen chez Ovide\", Rivista di CII/tura classica e medioeva/e 15 (1973), 257-296 at 268ff. , E. Birley, \"The Deities of Roman Britain\", ANRW2, 18, I (1986) 3-112 at 34f., accepts the thesis of 1. C. Mann, Britannia 2 (1971), 313, that the multiplication of the emperor's powers might be expressed in popular thought through the notion that he possessed mUltiple numina. For the view that numen is the essential power or divine force that makes a god a god-therefore by metonomy the deity itself-see \"Genius and Numen\", above, pp. 383f.; \"Augustan Blessings and Virtues\", below, pp. 470, 472; further Oxford Latin Dictionary 1202 s.v., 3-6. Logically, therefore, the word should be predicated of the emperor in the singular, as confirmed by the for­mula devotus numini maiestatique eius or the occasional attribution of numen in the singular to a plurality of Augusti; for the early cult of the Numen Augusti see \"Genius and Numen\", above, pp. 378ff. Confused theology is perfectly possible, of course, at a popular level, but the ascription of numina to a single Augustus does not seem to be securely attested in inscriptions (above, note 6); the problem is naturally complicated by the use of abbreviations. For numen explicitly applied in the singular to a single emperor see, for example, CIL 2, 1516; CIL 8, 5177; ILA/g I, 1028; IR T 324 (a); AEpig (1957) no. 338. Under the circumstances, then, to infer a plurality of numina for a single emperor in a particular inscription, as in RIB 707 (Birley, o.c. 35, n. 1 17) or RIB 1330 (Birley, ibid n. 120), seems arbitrary. Weinstock's judgment that the concept of numen developed late (followed by Mann, I. c. ) was countered by H. 1. Rose in HThR 44 (1951), 109- 120. See fur­ther \"Genius and Numen\", above, p. 383 with notes 38-40; D.

The same is also true of the Three Gauls and the Germanies and to a lesser extent of Narbonensis. The formula applies to the totality of emperors worshipped in the cult, occasionally designated divi Augusti: cf. RIB 181 (PI. LXXVI b).'3 It is important to observe that the converse of this basic assumption does not apply, namely that wherever the plural Augustorum is found one must necessarily presuppose the plural numina. Examples of numini Augustorum or numini divorum Augustorum, if much rarer than the normal numinibus Augustorum, certainly occur; 14 the devotus formula can also on occasion link a singular numen with the plural pronoun eorum.'s To attribute numen in the singular to divinities in the plural is a usage going back at least as far as to Cicero, '6 and would seem to imply that the divinities in question are treated collectively. But it creates a difficulty in inscriptions where numenlnumina is abbreviated and Augustorum written in full or plainly plural (Augustor.ldivor.Aug.). What is the proper expansion of the abbreviation in these cases-in the singular or in the plural? Clearly any degree of certainty on the matter is out of the question, but if one looks at the general practice of a province, it becomes possible to make a reasonable judgement. In Africa, for example, the odds in favour of an expansion to numini Augustorum would be relatively high; in the Gauls and even more so in the Germanies an expansion to numinibus Augustorum would be far more likely. '7 This argu­ment applies a fo rtiori to Britain where no examples of the formula numini Augustorum have yet been found and where as a result the plural numinibus 10 Though sometimes given as an expansion (e.g. elL 13, 1379), the form numinibus Augustis seems to be nowhere attested in full and may therefore be excluded from discussion-AEpig, 1965 , no. 195 should read numinib(us) Aug(ustis), not Aug(us)tis. The singular form numini Augusto looks to occur with certainty only at Forum Clodii, elL 11,3303 (= ILS 154); cf. Pid­didi (above, note 3) 101.

One final point must be raised in this connection. While one finds a singular numen with the plural Augustorum or divorum Augustorum, cases where a singular numen is applied to two or more living emperors collectively and exclusively are extremely few.18 The rule with living emperors seems to be to attribute numen individually to eachl9 and hence the regular form is numinibus Augg.l Auggg. 20 So much for inscriptions involving two or more Augusti, either living or combined living and dead. Now to dedications attesting the numen of a single reigning emperor. That this form of cult certainly existed in Britain is clearly shown by the following inscriptions: Deabus Matribus Tramarinis I et n. imp. Alexandri Aug. et ... (RIB 919) Deo Marti Ocelo et I numini imp. �!?�{JfJt;lri Aug. I et ... (RIB 949) (PI. LXXVII b) Deae Gar I mangabi I et n. OQr[t;lil(lfJi Aug. n. (RIB 1074) Deo MI ar[t]e et n. I Aug. n. P.F.

(JRS 59, 1969, p. 235, no. 1) In all of the above the reigning emperor is either mentioned explicitly by name or the singular can be inferred with a high degree of probability from his title. There are also three examples of dedications to the numina of two reign­ing emperors where it is perfectly clear from the date who the reigning Augusti were: RIB 327 (A.D. 244), 627 (A.D. 208), 2042 (A.D. 253-8). (RIB 918 and 1596, which also record the numina of living emperors give no indication of date). If the numina of two reigning emperors are epigraphically recorded, it would be reasonable to expect a cult of the numen of a single reigning emperor. even if we had no actual text to prove it. Lastly, there are four examples of the formula devotus numini maiestatique eius (or a variant) \" ClL 8, 14395, which is dated A.D. 209 and refers to Severus and his sons, gives the text [arcum fe cit) et numini Aug. earum dicavit. This again is an inscription from Africa, where a singular numen with the plural Augustarum seems much more common than elsewhere in the Empire. At Volubilis an unusual text even attributes one genius to the three Severi: AEpig (1957) no. 204. \" For an explanation see W.

Theoretically this could be an abbreviation for numini A ug(ustorum) , but since no certain example of this particular form of dedication occurs in Britain the more likely expansion is numini Aug(usti). Otherwise what one finds on all stones which certainly attest the numen of a single reigning emperor is that an abbreviation is used either of numini or of Augusti or of both.

How is one to know that an abbreviation fo und in some particular text does in fact denote the formula for which that abbreviation seems normally to have stood? This caveat applies particularly to the present discussion when the issue hangs on the fine distinction between singular and plural. The most one can hope to do in the circumstances is to establish whether or not the use of these abbreviations conforms to a consistent pattern and, if so, to apply the results with the above proviso to doubtful cases. In the main this means that we must argue on the basis of dedications where the proper expansion can be determined from other features of the inscription. First, the two main theories in the field. The earlier was that of Mommsen formulated in a note to EphEp 7, 1941 (= RIB 1594) (PI. LXXVIII a), which Mommsen transcribed as follows: Deo I Marti et duabus I Alaisiagis et n(uminibus) Aug(ustorum) I ... For the sake of clarity Mommsen's words are best given in full.23 \"Dies ist die korrekte Auflosung der auf britannisehen Inschriften sehr haufigen, sonst nieht gerade ge1aufigen Formel. Der Plural numinibus ist vielfaeh sieher bezeugt, der Singular auf keiner britannisehen Insehrift vollstiindig gesichert (denn VII, 170, 936 [= RIB 458, 2040] sind nicht ausreichend beglaubigt) und aueh ausserhalb Britannien findet sieh zwar beides, aber uber­wiegt entsehieden der Plural.

Aug., Dessau applied his thesis to both n. Aug. and num. Aug., whereas Deininger is mainly concerned with num. Aug. Thus on this interpretation, which may conveniently be called \"Mommsen improved\", both n. Aug. and num. Aug. are to be taken as abbreviations of the plural numinibus Augustorum. The main objection to this theory is that it does not allow for the possibility that the numen of a single reigning emperor may be intended in inscriptions where abbreviations cannot be expanded with certainty. To expand all abbreviations in the plural in effect excludes this possibility. Yet we have seen 2 J Hermes 19 (1884), 232, n. 3. 24 Dessau ad ILS 4538, 9302; Deininger, l. c."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THE IMPERIAL NUMEN IN ROMAN BRITAIN 403 that the numen Augusti was certainly paid cult in Britain and that in cases where there is no possibility of doubt abbreviations were certainly used. Fur­thermore, Mommsen's statement that on no British inscription is the singular numini certainly attested is simply incorrect (though it is true that numini Augusti is nowhere attested in full). There seems no compelling need to doubt the singular in CIL 7, 170 (= RIB 458), even though the stone is now lost, nor again in CIL 7, 936 (= RIB 2040). The singular is likewise attested with certainty in RIB 949 and 1692, also in JRS 59 (1969), p. 235, no. 1. The three of these are in the same category as the \"exceptions\" Mommsen quotes (RIB 919, 1225, 1983), to which add RIB 1074 and 1100, where a singular numen can be inferred from the emperor's title.25 Given that the numen Augusti is certainly found in Britain and the very real possibility that this may be intended in some cases where abbreviations are used, the problem is not whether an abbreviated form can be expanded in the singular but which. One answer to this question is that given by RIB ad 152 (PI. LXXVIII b). The editorial note to this inscription reads as follows: \"Mommsen... took the view that N. AVG stood for N(uminibus) Aug(ustorum), while observing certain British examples (though not all, e.g. RIB 2040), in which the singular NVMINI A VG(VSTI) is plainly meant. In an abbreviated form, however, the sole means of distinguishing between the Numina of two or more reigning Augusti and those of deceased emperors treated collec­tively would be to use for the former the normal AVGG or AVGGG, and for the latter AVG with the plural NVMINA. AAVVGG clearly refers to Severus and Caracalla on RIB 627 (Greetiand) dated to A.D. 208; and the frequent examples of such plurals might suggest that when it was desired to dedicate to more than one reigning emperor care was taken to state this unambiguously, as Roman ritual practice would enjoin. This may explain the difference in treatment.\" On this view, then, the formula whenever two or more living emperors are concerned is numina Augg. / Auggg. For \"deceased emperors treated collec­tively\" (RIB does not include the numen of the living emperor among the numina Augustorum26) it is numina Aug. What then is the abbreviated form for the numen of a single reigning emperor? This is nowhere stated explicitly, but in RIB 152 n. Aug. is expanded to n(umini) Aug(usti), and a similar expansion of n. Aug. with reference to the same editorial note is given in other examples of this abbreviation.27 Furthermore, the same statement of doctrine (\"For this expansion of n. Aug. in the singular see note to RIB 152\") is invoked where the abbreviation used in the inscription is not n. Aug. but num. 21 This excludes RIB 978, 1706,2066 where numini occurs in the de votus formula; also RIB 979, with Birley's conjecture ... temp/um numlini eius vetusl tate ... \" See above, note 13. \" RIB 623, 1593f., 1882, 1904 , 1987, 1991,2063 (in 640, where the expansion of n.

Aug. and num. Aug., that both are interchangeable, that both are to be expanded in the singular, and that both are equivalent to numini Aug. 30 Thus whereas on the theory of \"Mommsen improved\" both n. Aug. and num. Aug. are to be expanded in the plural, RIB goes to the opposite extreme in expanding them (for the most part) in the singular. The explicit part of this theory, referring to inscriptions where we have the plural with numina written in full, works well enough.

The point is true at least of the late second century and later32-before then, that is before the possibility of double emperors had been conceived, Augg. could certainly include deceased emperors; cf. elL 2, 2344 (time of Trajan): f/amen divorum Augg.-but so also AEpig (1966) no. 181 (A.D. 191}.33 The main weakness of the statement, however, is that it begs the central question of how one is to distinguish between the cult of a single living emperor and the cult of the Augusti collectively when both numinilnuminibus and Augustil Augustorum are abbreviated. Consistently to expand both n. Aug. and num. Aug. in the singular assumes that there is no possibility of an abbreviated form of numina in the cult of the numina of all emperors past and present. Yet in RIB 181 (PI. LXXVI b), where the Augusti are expressly designated divi, num. is certainly taken to be an abbreviation for num(inibus}: num(inibus} divor(um} I Aug(ustorum} ... Similarly in 627, where two living 28 RIB 309, 657, 1083, 2103 . \" RIB 1983 (partly restored), 2040. lO This is, indeed, confirmed by the note to RIB 1692. \"Some of the altars dedicated num. Aug. do not specify the name of the emperor but after Aug. or D.N. give the dedicator's name.\" This clearly shows that, on the view of RIB, num. Aug. is an abbreviation for num(im) Aug(ustl). 31 Th.L.L. 2, 1385, S.V. On imprecision in the usage see B. E. Thomasson, \"Zum Gebrauch von Augustorum, Augg. und Aug. als Bezeichnung der Samtherrschaft zweier Herrscher\", ZPE 52 (1983), 125-135. 12 Th.L.L. 2, 1386, s.v.; Augg . (sic) refers to Postumus on a milestone from Margam, Glamorgan: JRS 27 (1937), p. 248f., no. 12. If a reference to the numina is correctly restored in AEpig (1983) no. 643, then Augg. must refer to living and deceased emperors since the dedica­tion is dated A.D. 221. 1l See further E.

Again, RIB gives a plural expansion of num. Aug. in its partial restoration of 940; cf. also RIB 2264; JRS 47, 1957, p. 230, no. 19. But ifin fact num., if not n.,3' can sometimes be plural, how is one to tell what is the proper expansion when it is followed by Aug.? For Aug. can be a normal abbrevia­tion equally well for Aug(usti) as for Aug(ustorum). 3S The rule of thumb fol­lowed by RIB seems to be to expand in the singular in all cases except when a plural is definitely indicated, as by Augg., divor. Aug.36 (b) The best approach to the problem is surely to observe the various examples of a particular abbreviation and to see whether any consistent usage can be determined. As has been stated, this means that in practice most emphasis must be placed on texts where the proper expansion can be determined with some degree of probability from the intrinsic features of the inscription. Fur­thermore, since Aug. can equally well be singular or plural, it also means that much will depend on whether the use of n. and num. can be shown to conform to a consistent pattern. For the sake of convenience the abbreviations are treated in order ranging from shortest to longest. N.A VO. If we include examples where the emperor is actually narned or his title given, there are fourteen instances in all of this abbreviation in RIB. Of these the following permit the expansion n(umini) with certainty: ... I et n(umini) imp(eratoris) Alexandri Aug(usti) (RIB 919; PI. LXXVIII c). The singular is certain since the numen is that of Alexander Augustus . ... I et n(umini) 09rl4!l(1lJi Aug(usti) n(ostri) (RIB lO74). Again, the name of Gordian, which has been intentionally erased, permits the certain expan­sion of numini in the singular . ... I et n(umini) I Aug(usti) n(ostri) P(ii) F(e/icis)(RIB 1100). The emperor is not named, but his title suggests a singular emperor and therefore a singular numen. 34 R1B gives a plural expansion for n. in a restoration to 913. \" P. Collart and D. van Berchem, \"Inscriptions de Vidy\", Rev. Hist. Vaudoise47 (1939),127-1 45 at 128 . .. Similarly R. Cagnat, Coursd'Epigraphie Latine', Paris, 1914, 447f., treats both n. and num. as an abbreviation of numini. Also, in AEpig, num.

Equally illuminating is an inscription dated 23rd September, A.D. 244, in the reign of the two Philippi. The dedication is to the Deities of the Emperors and the Genius of the Second Augusta, which would have celebrated 23rd September, the birthday of Augustus, as the birthday of the legion. nn. I Augg. I genio I leg. I II Aug. (RIB 327; PI. LXXVIII d). The interesting feature of this text is that a double n. is used to denote the plural numinibus, just as the double g. denotes the plural Augustorum. Not only does this confirm the principle of one numen per emperor, but the use of the double n. confirms that a single n. is the abbreviation for numini. A further example where the abbreviation can be expanded with some prob­ability is the inscription from Bath to which RIB appends the statement of doctrine quoted above: locum reli I giosum per in I solentiam e I ru tum I virtuti et n(umini) I Aug(usti) repurgaltum reddidit (RIB 152; PI. LXXVIII b). Since virtus, like other imperial virtues, is attributed only to the living emperor, 37 it seems highly likely that n. Aug. also refers to the living emperor. It is true that virtus in the singular is attributed to two reigning emperors (A ugg.) in RIB 1466, but here the single g. of Aug. means that Aug. is in all probability short for a single reigning emperor. Aug. could of course denote the totality of emperors worshipped in the cult (Augustl) but then virtus would be attributed to dead emperors as well as the living. We may therefore take it that the holy spot was restored to the Virtue and Deity of the living emperor and that n. is short for n(umim). Thus in six out of fifteen examples (if we include RIB 327) it is clear that n. is the abbreviation for numini. It would seem then more likely than not that n. is also short for numini in other inscriptions where the abbreviation is indeterminable. That n., the shortest possible abbreviation of the word, should stand for the singular is reasonable enough.38 Where the simpel for­mula n. Aug. is used, the expansion n(umini) Aug(ustorum) would in theory be possible, but in practice the possibility is remote, given that numini Augustorum is rare throughout the north-west and has yet to be attested in Britain. We may therefore fairly assume that in inscriptions where analogy is the only criterion available n. Aug. should very probably be expanded to n(umini) Aug(usti). 17 See the discussion by Etienne, Cuffe imperiaf320-34 with refs.; further \"Augustan Blessings and Virtues\", below, p. 00. \" N. is, of wurse, always the abbreviation for ,,\"mini in the formula D.N.M.Q.E."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"THE IMPERIAL NUMEN IN ROMAN BRITAIN 407 This conclusion is strikingly confirmed if next we turn to examples outside Britain.

(Wuilleumier, IL TG 160). A similar abbreviation to that in RIB 327 occurs at Trier and admits of the same conclusions: nn. [Augg.] Dea[e Dia?] I n(a)e (CIL 13, 3639). It may also be observed that in the Three Gauls and the Germanies, where the cult of the numina Augustorum is so predominant, there are no examples of n. Aug. in the Germanies, only one in Belgica, and perhaps three or four in Lugdunensis.39 These may be dedications to the numen of a single living emperor, for which there is some slight direct evidence in Aquitania and perhaps in Belgica;40 but it is equally possible that the reference is to the numini Augustorum, which we have seen to be occasionally attested on the continent and which is best taken as a variant on the normal numinibus Augustorum. Whichever view is correct, there is nothing in the north-west, nor for that matter elsewhere in the empire, to prejudice the hypothesis that n. is the normal abbreviation for numini.4I On the whole, it would seem that n. is the standard abbreviation for numini equally well outside Britain as within.42 NVM.

Again, Hirschfield ad elL 13, 1742, notes a horizontal bar above the single N and remarks \"linea supra N. i.e. n(uminibus) fortasse casu effecta\". A similar line occurs above the N in elL 13,3527, and above the second N in elL 13,3639; also over the double NN in RIB 1452: 10 [M] I Dol. I pro sal. Augg. nn.

Cf. 459, 1596, 2042 where the plural numina is certainly attested with Augg. or Auggg. ). A plural is also very probably to be understood in an inscription from Somerdale, Keynsham, where the Augusti are designated divi: num(inibus) divor(um) I Aug(ustorum) (RIB 181; PI. LXXVI b). A singular numen referring to the divi Augusti collectively would in theory be possible, but we have seen that no certain example of such a formula has yet been found in Britain. These seem to be the only examples in Britain where num. can be expanded with any degree of probability. On the continent the following examples per­mit the expansion num(inibus): nu(minibus) A (u)gg. deo Marti Vorodo (elL 13, 1497) (nu. Agg. seems to be a stylistic variant on num.

The same argument applies as above. Num(inibus) Augg. et I deo Mercu I rio Felid (AE pig, 1973, no. 342; cf. 341: Numinibus I Augg. et ... ). In the overwhelming number of examples from the Three Gauls and the Ger­manies the cult takes the form of dedications to the numina Augustorum.

The first (a) reads: num. Aug. I deo Merleurio Sal bini ius(su) I Carissa I ar[am ... J : d.s.p. The interpretation to be placed on these inscriptions is surely that (a) is dedicated to the numina of all emperors worshipped collectively in the cult, whereas in (b) Sabinus has paid his vow to the numina of two living Augusti. On this view num. is used consistently in both and num. Aug. in (a) is a further example of the very common formula num.lnuminibus Aug. with which so many dedications begin in the north-west. Wuilleumier, however, expands num. Aug. in (a) to num(ini) Aug(usti). This would mean that (b), which seems to have been cut later than (a) (BCTH, 1928-29, 73f.), employed the same abbreviation as that already on the stone to denote a different form.

Aug. is as a result seldom attested throughout the area and not at all in the Germanies. The regular short form is num. Aug., which if only on the basis of statistical probability must therefore be taken as in most cases equivalent to num(inibus) Aug(ustorum).44 If so, it would seem very likely that num. Aug. should be similarly interpreted in Britain, which could be expected to have followed the continental practice in such matters. A further factor to be borne in mind is that, although the cult of the numen Augusti is relatively rich in Britain, it is still very much outnumbered there by the cult of the numina Augustorum (above, p. 399). If, then, n. Aug. is the short form for n(umini) Aug(usti), it is hardly likely that num. Aug. should also be regularly expanded in the singular. For in that case we should have two short abbreviations for what is statistically the less common form of the cult and no short abbrevia­tion for what is by far the more frequent. It is worth noting in this connection, too, that, although one finds nn. (= numinibus), there are no examples of numm. in this sense; which would certainly indicate a possible singular for num., if any in fact occurred. If lastly one considers the fact that in at least six instances in Britain and the north-west num. can be expanded to num(inibus) with great probability, if not certainty, the case for expanding num. in the plural where analogy is the only criterion seems fairly strong. Against this must be weighed two examples where num. might possibly indicate the singular. Both come from Britain. The first is an inscription found in Nicholas Lane, London, later lost from the Guildhall museum, and now known only from the drawing reproduced in RIB. The transcript reads: num(ini) C[aes(aris) Aug(usti)] I prov[incia] I Brita[nnia ... \"To the Deity of the Emperor the province of Britain (set this up)\" (RIB 5). Who the Caesar Augustus was is not clear, but the singular would certainly require the expansion of num. in the singular rather than in the plural, which we have taken to be the rule. Much depends, therefore, on whether the pro­posed restoration is acceptable. Clearly the reference would have to be some early emperor, since the later style, when the emperor is not actually named, is numini Augusti nostrilnumini domini nostri Augusti (cf. RIB 1100, 1225). RIB notes that Caesar Augustus is used to denote Claudius at Rome (elL 6, 5539 = ILS 1786) and either Claudius or Nero at Rome (elL 6, 8943 = IL S 1838) and Atina (elL 10, 5056 = ILS 977). If either were intended here, this would put the inscription almost a century before the earliest datable example of num. Aug. in Britain (RIB 824f.)-possibly even longer before the formula became common on the continent. In that case so early a usage of this abbreviation would hardly affect the argument regarding its expansion during .. Deininger (above, note 4) 139f. with statistical data."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"410 BOOK II the later period when the cult was so widespread in Britain.4s But it is very questionable whether a dedication of this kind could actually have been made to Claudius or Nero. If the stone was set up by the province of Britain this would surely imply the existence of a provincial council (cf. CIL 13, 3162), which if it existed at all in the first century would have had its seat at Col­chester rather than at London.46 Inscriptions attesting two provincial patrons (CIL 11, 383: Hadr.l Ant. Pius; 14, 2508: Caracalla) may indirectly point to the organisation of a provincial council in the mid-second and early-third cen­turies;47 but the only real evidence to connect the council with London is the possibility that provinc(ialis) is equivalent to servus provinciae in RIB 21.48 Whatever the merits of this hypothesis, it may be doubted that Caesar Augustus can refer to any second-, much less any third-century emperor. Fur­thermore, although the formula numen Caesaris Augusti occurs in CIL 12, 4333 (= ILS 112), where the reference is to Augustus himself, the altar dedicated at Narbo in A.D. 12113 was to the numen Augusti, not the numen Caesaris Augusti; cf. CIL 11, 3303 (= ILS 154): numini Augusto (A.D. 18). A dedication numini Caesaris Augusti is, in fact, unparalleled. 49 Nor for that matter do there seem to be any instances where numenlnumina is combined with CaesarislCaesarum: which would tell against HUbner's sug­gested restoration: num(ini) C[aes(aris) et genio] I pro v [inciae] I Brita[nniae] .Equally unlikely would be num(ini) C[laudi . .. since Claudius would undoubtedly have been styled Ti. Claudius ... In the circumstances, then, there is ample room to doubt that C (?) is the initial letter of C[aes(aris) - at least if num. is an abbreviation for some form of numen rather than the middle or final syllable of some other word (though the sketch certainly seems to show that the text began with num). With the original stone lost the problem is probably incapable of satisfactory solution. For present purposes it is sufficient to have shown that this inscription does not materially affect the argument over the proper expansion of num. Aug. The same point also applies to the second text, a dedication set up at Netherby by the First Aelian cohort of Spaniards. The relevant section of the transcript reads: ., One might compare the Cogidubnus inscription (RIB 91), which is also very early (? reign of Vespasian) and records the rare formula pro salute domus divinae; cf.

Here again the singular eius requires that numen be singular. Two points are worth making none the less. In the first place the dedication is now lost and known only from a manuscript copy. To judge from the facsimile reproduced in RIB from Cotton Julius MS. the reading num. (as opposed to numim) is far from certain-at least pro I [-- - ] devotione [ - --] I num. eius is writ­ten with dots below the line. Secondly, this is not a dedication of the num. Aug. type but an example of numen followed by the relative pronoun; cf. RIB 978, 1706 (nu[mi]ni eius). For both reasons, therefore, this inscription also would hardly seem to prejudice the conclusion that in Britain num. Aug. is more likely than not an abbreviation for num(inibus) Aug(ustorum). It must be stressed, however, that this thesis holds true only for Britain and the north-west: it does not follow that num. is necessarily to be taken for the plural throughout the Empire. What one would expect is a fa irly consistent usage within a province or within several provinces of a particular area. Thus in Africa N is certainly to be interpreted n(umini) in the formula D.N.M. Q.E.

Instead, as noted ealier (above, p. 399, cf. p. 395), it takes the form of dedications to the numen Augustorum or, in one instance, numen divorum Augustorum with the numen of the living emperor mentioned in addition. 52 Hence, if one ap­plies the same principles in Africa as in Britain, one would expect num. to be short for num(ini).53 Similarly in the north-east and the east, where there is little evidence for the cult in any form apart from the devotus formula, there is a single example in which num. must be an abbreviation for num(im) : I. O.M. I et num. Aug. n. I et ... A.D. 182 (CIL 3, 752 = 7435 = IL S 1856). Once again, however, it is striking that the cult of the numina Augustorum tout court does not seem to be attested at all in CIL 3.54 The situation seems to be then that the only examples where num. Aug. is definitely to be expanded in the singular occur in areas where there is little or no trace of I. Cf. ClL 8, 7009f., 18905, 22076, 23415. <, Cf.

Aug. in the plural. The discussion thus points to the conclusion that, where epigraphical abbreviations are used to record the cult of the Imperial numen in Britain, their expansions fall into two main categories: certain and probable. To the former belong: nn(uminibus) A ugg(ustorum) num(inibus) Augg(ustorum) numinib(us) Aug(ustorum)/ Augg(ustorum)/ Augustor(um) numinibus Aug(ustorum)/ Augg(ustorum) Probable expansions, which can in many cases be determined only by analogy are: n(umini) Aug(ustij numini Aug(usti) num(inibus) Aug(ustorum) There is also a single example of a further abbreviation, of which the expan­sion numin(ibus) seems certain: Deae Su Iii Min(ervae) et nu I min(ibus) Augg.

That a province or group of provinces should attest the operation of definite conventions regarding abbreviations is perhaps a surprising conclu­sion; certainly it has wider implications for epigraphy in general. Contrary to the standard view it would appear that the choice of some particular form was not left to the mason guided by the length of the line, physical characteristics of the stone, etc.; for, if it were, one would have to attribute to sheer chance the fact that, wherever one can tell, these abbreviations do seem to conform to a standard system. The argument would seem to be particularly relevant to the thesis first established by J. Mallon.'6 On this hypothesis the lapicide \" Num. must also indicate the singular in the following example, since a singular numen is always attributed to the domus Augusta: Num. dom. Aug.

Furthermore there is little likelihood that an ordinator would have decided upon any particular abbreviation himself. From the way he misread such standard abbreviations as H. S.E. (the misreading then being beautifully engraved to the confusion of epigraphists) it seems that the abbreviations were given already in the original cursive text. Granted such a system, it would be reasonable enough that, when it was necessary to distinguish between singular and plural, there should be standard abbreviations for numini or numinibus rather than a whole range of possibilities that could be used indiscriminately for either. This is not, of course, to say that some particular convention was standard throughout the empire: in Africa, as we have seen, num. seems consistently to denote the singular rather than the plural.

The Cult of the Imperial Numen A few observations may be appropriate at this juncture on the general char­acter of the cult in Britain. The most obvious point arises from the foregoing discussion and has already been touched upon more than once, namely the profusion of the �ult throughout the north-west in general and Britain in par­ticular. In no other quarter of the Roman world are dedications to the Imperial numen so plentiful. The popularity of the cult was matched by its longevity.

Dated or datable inscriptions attest the collective numina Augustorum from well before the middle of the second century and continue thereafter for over a hundred years. The cult of the numen of the living emperor or emperors seems, on the other hand, to be exclusively third­century, and within this to have flourished particularly in the period from Alexander Severus to Valerian. As a result, the abbreviation n. is restricted to the third century, whereas num. appears in the second and third centuries with the cult of the numina Aug., but also in the third century with that of the numina Augg. To expand num. in the singular would surely be impossible in the case of texts belonging to the second century, a period when there is no firm evidence for a cult of the living emperor's numen. The table also throws light on the distribution of inscriptions between soldiers and civilians. In Britain both are represented in roughly equal numbers in dedications to the numina Augustorum, but to judge from surviving stones the cult of the numen of the living emperor or emperors seems to have been a predominantly military practice. This contrasts sharply with the picture on the continent where datable evidence begins somewhat later. 61 In the Three Gauls and the Germanies the numina Augustorum were paid cult by civilians on a very wide scale; but there are more than twice as many inscriptions from Lugdunensis and Aquitania as from Belgica and the Germanies and not a single dedication by soldiers. The cult of the numen Augusti, if this is how n. Aug. is to be inter­preted on the continent, is very poorly attested and what little there is may well be first- or second-century (above, p. 407). There is certainly no evidence for a third-century cult of the numen Augusti comparable to what is observ­able in Britain and no dedication n. Aug. by the military. What one does find is a score or so examples attesting the devotus formula-normally after the emperor has been mentioned by name. But Britain also has yielded four, perhaps six, examples of this type, a number that compares not un favourably in proportion to the total number of inscriptions found in either area. This difference in practice raises an important question. What on the north­west frontier has taken the place of the third-century vogue of the numen Augusti in Britain? The obvious answer is inscriptions honouring the domus \" For dated inscriptions with the formula numinibus Augustorum see F. Stahelin, Die Schweiz in romischer Zeit, Basel, 1948,360, n.!. While this list seems complete for elL 13, it omits several from Britain given above. Furthermore, in the Gauls and the Germanies a great many dedications to the numina Augustorum are undated and it is not impossible that in some cases these may have been set up in the earlier part of the second century. Editorial observations on the letter-forms of some inscriptions tend to strengthen this hypothesis. One would hesitate to claim, therefore, that the formula numinibus Aug. ! Augustorum indicates of itself a date ca. A.D. 200, even though most of Stahelin's list belong to this period. Contra E. Howald and E.

Here again it is notable that far more instances of the formula in h.d.d. , or a variant, occur in Belgica and the Germanies than in Aquitania and Lugdunensis-where conversely the cult of the numina Augustorum was stronger. Furthermore, the bulk of these belong to the first half of the third century, relatively few dating from the second century or later than the middle of the third.67 This contrasts sharply with the situation in Britain,68 where only five references to the divine house by civilians have been recovered (RIB 89, 91, 707, 1700, 2066) and three by the military (RIB 897, 916, 919); to which can now be added a fragmentary text from Kirby Hill (Britannia 9, 1978, p. 474, no. 6). Again, while several of these in Britain are also from the first half of the third century, three at least are very much earlier: RIB 91 (?reign of Vespa­sian), 707 (A.D. 140-4); Britannia 9, no. 6 (Antoni nus Pius or Caracalla).69 It would therefore appear that whereas the cult of the numina Augustorum was popular with civilians on both sides of the Channel, there was no con­tinental counterpart to the military cult of the numen Augusti in third-century Britain. The devotus formula might be said to have partly filled the gap in Belgica and the Germanies, but the same formula is also attested in Britain in proportionately comparable numbers. The most popular practice on the north-west frontier was to honour the divine house and military practice and civilian were clearly interrelated. This would seem to imply a diff erence of emphasis at least in the first half of the third century. For while the domus divina included all members of the imperial family,70 the cult of the numen Augusti in Britain focused attention directly upon the emperor or emperors in person. How this phenomenon should be interpreted is difficult to say, but Britain is also notable for the evidence it has yielded for the cult of disciplina, at least two instances of which belong to the third century; RIB 1127, 1978.71 Perhaps then similar factors contributed to the development of both cults, ..

Beyond this it is difficult to isolate any further features of the cult that are peculiar to Britain. Both the collective numina Augustorum and the numen of the living emperor or emperors are attested with gods and godlings of every kind and there is nothing to show that one or the other was particularly associated with traditional Roman, imperial, oriental or Celtic divinities. It is interesting to observe that at Caerleon in A.D. 244 the senior centurion made a dedication to the numina of the two living Augusti and to the genius of the second Augusta in honour of the Eagle (RIB 327), and that a few years later (A.D. 253-8) Caelius Vibianus, commander of the unit of Aurelian Moors, associated the numina of the two Augusti with Jupiter Optimus Maximus and the genius of the unit in a similar dedication at Burgh-by-Sands (RIB 2042). Again, the numen of the living emperor is associated with the standards in a third-century dedication by the first Aelian cohort at Birdoswald (RIB 1904). In the third quarter of the second century, on the other hand, a comparable dedication at Lanchester had associated the genius of the First Loyal Cohort of Vardullians with the collective numina Augustorum (RIB 1083). Similarly at Maryport the formula num. Aug. is linked with Jupiter Optimus Maximus on a series of second-century altars apparently erected in connection with the annual renewal of the oath of allegiance to the emperor on January 3rd (RIB 815, 824f.; but see 1983: January 1st, A.D. 241 - Castlesteads).72 Attention might also be drawn to a formal difference in the style of dedication. Whereas the plural numina Augg. and numina Aug. occur both in first and in second position when combined with another deity or deities, in only two (RIB 458, 1991) out of twenty examples does the singular numen of the living emperor stand first. This would be a further consideration against expanding num. in the singular whenever it stands first, though further discoveries may of course alter the picture in this respect. One final point of more general interest might be raised here in passing. At least four British inscriptions (RIB 919, 949, 1593-4) attest the numen Augusti and two (RIB 978, 1706) the devotus for­mula during the reign of Alexander Severus, A.D. 222-35.

Transcription of Abbreviations It remains to suggest modifications to the transcripts of a number of texts given in RIB. As had been emphasized throughout, what we are dealing with in many cases is simply the probable expansion of an abbreviation based entirely on analogy.

Birley is surely right in giving the plural Aug(ustorum) after [nu]minib(us) , but a double difficulty arises over n(ostrorum). If a single n. is to be read here, it was presumably preceded by a single g. in Aug. (Augg. n. is hardly possible).79 Aug. can occasionally refer to double emperors (Th.L.L. 2, 1385 s.v.) and n. sometimes denotes the plural (for example: CIL 5, 8056); but the far more frequent form is Augg. nn. and there seems to be no other example in Britain where Aug. n. could denote more than one living emperor. (N. does, of course, restrict the discussion to the living emperor or emperors). More decisive, perhaps, is the circumstance that n. or nn. is unprecedented in association with the plural formula numinib(us) Augg. N. occurs in connection with the numen of a single living Augustus in 1100, where the emperor is also styled Pius and Felix, and in 1225 we have n(umini) d(omini) n(ostrij Aug(usti); cf. 1692; CIL 3, 752 = 7435. There is also RIB 1983, where the text is much restored, though n. can be read with certainty: [/. O.M.] I et numi[ni Aug(usti)] I n(ostrij .... But there seems to be no parallel to numinib(us) Aug. n.! Augg.nn. (cf. 326, 1452). In fact n. is so awkward with the plural numinibus that it may be questioned whether this reading is, indeed, correct in 611. As we now have it, the text is based on Machell's drawing of the stone at a time when it was used as a seat in High Street, Kirkby Lonsdale, and (presumably) worn and weathered. Further­more, the facsimile reproduced from Machell MS II seems to show that the mason may have blundered in the first place with the engraving of co/igni. Even more significantly, a diagonal stroke connects IB in [nu]minib(us) thus ] MIN�; which in turn suggests the possibility that what looks like l'E in line 2 may be nothing of the kind. In the circumstances it may be suggested that what we have in 611 are the traces of an original mason's blunder for Aug. or Augg. or an imperfect reading of the stone made by Machell under difficult circumstances-or a combination of the two. All analogy would seem to suggest that the original dedication was simply to the numina Aug.! Augg. and the genius of the college. The following transcript may come close to what was first intended: \" Augg. n. seems unparalleled with numinibus; for Augg. n., Augustorum n., Auggg. n. with servus / verna see H. Chantraine.

RIB normally expands this abbl'eviation to num(ini) Aug(usti) with reference to the statement of doctrine ad RIB 152. In 181, however, there is a departure from this practice and we are given an expansion in the plural.

Valerius Maximus had no scruples about using \"divinitas\" of Tiberius and, whereas Seneca had riduculed Gaius' claims to be \"our god Caesar\", the medical writer Scribonius Largus, writing before A.D. 48, addresses the emperor on no less than three occasions as deus noster Caesar; 11 even an entry in the AFA refers to Claudius as [djivini principis.'2 All the same, to describe the imperial family en bloc as \"divine\" would be a startling usage in an inscription of the latter years of Tiberius, especially when the term had not yet become established even in the poets. The true implication of divina as applied to the domus imperatoria (at least initially) can best be understood by analysis of the parallel term domus Augusta, which though rarer than domus divina occurs contemporaneously and must be considered analogous. 13 That a close correspondence exists 7 Henzen, AFA (\\874) CXVI ff. cf. p. 484, nn. 56-9 et passim • Diz.

Ovid makes the mean­ing explicit in Ex Ponto 2, 2, 74: ceteraque Augustae membra valere domus (cf. 3, 1, 135), but the implication of Augusta reveals itself equally in the inscriptions. Thus a dedication from Coela dated A.D. 55 reads numini domus Augustae (CIL 3, 7380), whereas a similar inscription from Ostia uses the form numini I domus I Augusti (CIL 14, 4319; cf. numini domus Aug., ibid. 4320). In other inscriptions from Rome the formula numini domus Augusti/ Augustorum is frequent,'s while saluti/pro salute domus Augustae is interchangeable with pro salute domus Augustorum, as is in honorem domus Augustae with in honorem domus Augusti. On the other hand the form domus Augustae seems the norm after flamen, jlaminica, sacerdos, ponti/ex, cultores.'6 Of particular interest is the inscription of C. Iulius Spartiaticus (above, p. 423), recording that his career was crowned by the post of archiereus domus Aug. [in] perpetuum primus Achaeon; that is, he was the first to be chosen by the koinon of Achaeans as high priest in perpetuum of the Imperial house.17 That domus Aug. (whatever the expansion) must mean the house founded by Augustus is confirmed by the title given Spartiaticus in two Greek inscriptions. The formula given in one from Athens is &pXLf.Pf.UC; 0f.wV I:f.�cxa'twv xcxi j'ivouc; I:f.�cxa'twv ...

Spartiaticus was therefore priest of the deified and living members of the imperial house,'8 the Latin title archiereus domus Aug. being an umbrella for­mula which omits the details we have in the Greek versions.

In the first place divinus is clearly the corresponding adjective to the noun divuS, 21 which was originally, like deus, the word for any god before it came to have the restricted sense of a deified mortal (Varro, De Iing.lat. 3, 2 fro (4 [6]); Servius, ad Aen. 12, 139).22 Secondly, to replace the genitive of a noun with the corresponding derivative adjective is common practice. It occurs with priesthoods based on the names of gods:23 flamen Dialis, Mar­tialis, virgo Vestalis, sacerdos Veneria; with place-names, especially in poetry: Tuscula tellus, Amiterna cohors; above all with personal names: domus Augustana, Augustiana, Tiberiana, ostium Tiberinum, sevir Augustalis, horti Sallustiani, horrea Galbiana, tempora Neroniana, Venerius nepotulus, pars Herculanea, bellum Iugurthinum. Sometimes the actual name is used in what had been its original function as an adjective: lex Antonia, basilica Aemilia, Via Appia, Via F1aminia, Forum Iulium-hence by analogy mensis Augustus, domus Augusta, fo rum Augustum; also in such formulations as filiUS erilis, ferrea aetas, patria domus, flaminia aedes. One peculiarity here is that the genitive rather than the adjective is found with aedes, fa num, templum­showing that these were thought to be properly in the possession of a god since they were dedicated to him. Otherwise when a building or locality was simply named after its founder the adjectival usage is preferred. This is particularly true of the Classical period when such forms as colonia Agrippinensis (as opposed to oppidum Ubiorum) were the vogue. Similarly the adjective was normally preferred to the genitive as a means of indicating the type, character­istics, origin of the noun it limits. \" Cf.

The inscription of Cogidubnus in particular could be expected to have correctly followed the official line. 27 If this is the case, then domus divina can originally have hardly had any other meaning than that suggested.28 What is conclusive here is Tacitus' report that Tiberius objected violently when a courtier referred to the emperor's duties as divinas occupationes (Ann. 2, 87). Suetonius has the same story but in his version the offending word is sacras, for which Tiberius pointedly substituted laboriosas (Tib. 27). Even if the term first occurs in the provinces, therefore, the appearance of domus divina in the reign of Tiberius must be placed in the same context as the construction of the temple of Divus Augustus by the Palatine, or the permission given the Spaniards to erect a temple to Divus Augustus at Tarraco.29 In other words it echoes the fact that the primary concern of official policy was with the cult of Tiberius' predecessor, now duly enrolled among the State gods.30 Despite the fact that divina refers notionally to Divus Augustus, at least initially, there can be no question that the emphasis of the term is squarely upon living members of the house. That is self-evident in dedications on \" The expression would therefore be unlikely to occur under Vespasian, when the reference would still have been to Divus Augustus; cf.

But by this time domus divina seems to have meant little more than \"godlike house\", a commonplace formula for the domus imperatoria (below, pp 430f.), and it is difficult to think that other than living persons could be included after the pro sa/ute formula.

The same conclusion might be drawn whenever IN H.D.D. is coupled with numinibus Augg. (cf. AEpig, 1891, no. 142: A.D. 245) or pro salute imperatoris follows immediately upon IN H. D.D. (cf. CIL 13, 8019: A.D. 295). The question consequently arises whether divinus shifted at some stage, perhaps quite early, from its initial meaning.40 While the central role of the divi in the later development of the ruler cult might be thought to support the original implication of the word,41 one point beyond question is that in con­trast to, say, Neronianus, which is plainly analogous to Neronis, divinus means not only \"of the divus\" but also (and more commonly) \"divine\". We have seen that in the literary sources this sense of the word is usually self­evident, also that Tiberius was alive to its political dangers. One would suspect, too, that when Phaedrus first refers to the domus divina (5, 7, 38) he means \"divine\" not \"of the divus\" (cf. Appendix Perottina 12, 6; 28, 7). Similarly the context of Statius' remarks in Silvae 5, praef. makes it extremely likely that divina domus means \"divine house\", a phrase appropriate to the court of Domitian. There can at any rate be no mistaking the sense of [Epa OLXt(X or oIxOI; SEtol; in Greek inscriptions (above, p. 423).42 Even granted that the term began its career with the meaning suggested, then, the possibility of a different interpretation would have been obvious from the first and the more usual sense of divina could be expected to have predominated.

In the first place the sacred basis of the family is clear from the inclusion of the Imperial house in the formulae of oaths and official vola. 44 Furthermore, just as the emperor, who was himself related to a line of divi, could normally expect posthumous apotheosis, so Gaius, Nero, Titus, Domitian, the Antonines and the Severi extended the same right to a widening circle of their own nearest relatives, particularly females.4s As a result, the domus imperaloria already possessed in life a kind of right by relationship to divinity after death,46 so to speak of the \"divine house\" by prolepsis would befit a family destined for eventual divinity. Equally, it would be in keeping with the fashion of comparing the emperor and his kin with Olympic and other deities already in their lifetime. The origins of this practice go back to the early principate but it reached its climax under the Severi and is of a piece with the development of an official vocabulary that hedged the emperor, his house and everything he touched with divine character. 47 Typical of the age is the inflation of official language with such terms as att6'tcx'to�, ltpw'tcx'to�, oO'tw'tcx'to�, sanclissimus, sacralissimus, and the like, which now became common stock.48 The underlying idea appears to be that, since the emperor is like a god, whatever he does is thought of as godlike,49 and it is significant that such amplification of official phraseology coincides with a period of increasing central intervention on the one hand and diminished imperial credibility on the other. Of particular interest in the pres­ent context is the use of the word divinus. The term seems to have come into more general use in the later Flavian period but now is applied broadly to everything with which the emperor has to do, particularly in administrative documents. With the Greek equivalent atrO�, it can be used not just of the emperor's qualtities but also of his proposals, pronouncements, decisions, orders and rescripts, his palace, finances, arrival, expeditions, constructions 44 Mommsen (above, note 5) 819, n. 5; 825f.; Eitrem (above, note 6) ibid. ; A.

The point reinforces what has emerged earlier, namely that the emphasis of the term domus divina is squarely upon living members of the house; for if the divi were involved one would have expected cult rather than honour. What is equally pertinent, the vast majority of these inscriptions comes from the north-west: Britain, Belgica, the Germanies and Raetia;60 that is, the formula was of special significance in a region where civilians and soldiers were presumably of little or no education and could hardly be expected to have grasped an obscure reference to descent from a line of divi. 61 It might also be observed that a great many (though certainly not all) examples are military and that, to judge from the dedications they have left, troops took little interest in the cult of the deified deceased;62 also that in Britain contemporary dedications to the imperial numen stress the numen of the living emperor(s).63 Why the formula should be abundant in the north-west but almost entirely wanting elsewhere is difficult to say. What the evidence could suggest is that the formula took hold among the military and spread from the camps to the civilian population; but, if so, it remained a localized fashion that had a relatively restricted range.64 One may compare the formula Aug. sacr(um) which was popular in Gallia Lugdunensis but much less frequent elsewhere.65 The bulk of the inscriptions of this type are Severan,66 yet the possibility that the Severi deliberately propagated such formalized expressions of loyalty seems remote. \" Cf.

More fundamentally, the evidence for all inscriptions is most plentiful in the Severan period, when the epigraphic habit was evidently at its height. 61 In any event the overall impression is that the formula was mechanically copied to the point where it became a stereotype often barely understood.68 Herz points to a dedication at Kongen beginning I. O.M. 1 I. N.H.D.D. (CIL 13, 11728),69 and a similar instance of senseless division between the I and the N occurs at Neustad: I.N.D.D. (CIL 13, 6116-following IN H.D.D.); cf. I. HO.NO. REM. D.D.

D.D. a stereotyped convention, occasional inscriptions throw a very dif­ferent light on the significance of the domus divina within the imperial cult. These are traces that plainly attest the cult of the \"divine house\" as an entity on a par with the emperor himself. 10 In the first place one finds numen attributed to the domus Augusta/ Augustil Augustorum, which we have seen to be equivalent to the domus divina. Such a step clearly lifts the Imperial House above the ordinary human level by ascribing the intrinsic property of a god.\" We have seen that at Coela in the Thracian Chersonese (above, p. 425) a balneum was dedicated in A.D. 55 numini domus Augustae (CIL 3, 7380).

Of particular interest are dedications made directly to the domus divina. In some cases where the dative is employed, honour rather than worship is surely implicit.

AUGUSTO UT DEO A number of inscriptions from the provinces of the Latin West attest the association of the living emperor with some local or Roman divinity in a dedication or the payment of a vow. The familiar combination of Roma and Augustus (certainly in the dative case) appears on coins portraying the great altar at the sanctuary of the Three Gauls by Lugdunum (Vol. I, 1, Pis. I, XII­XVII).1 Whether this corresponds to an actual dedication formula in bronze letters, clamped onto the altar itself,2 must remain uncertain, but it is likely enough that the altars at Ara Ubiorum and Arae Flaviae were similarly dedicated, perhaps also the altar before the temple at Camulodunum. In a few instances the emperor is linked with a deity other than Roma such as Mer­curius or some local godling, with Augustus standing now in first place, now in second-in some cases one even finds Augustus replaced with a roster of personal names and secular titles. But by far the largest group is made up of inscriptions beginning Aug(usto) sacr(um) followed by the dative of a deity. Most examples of the latter that happen to survive are in the form of \"ex­voto's\"; the rest are dedications on statue-bases or from temples or other structures. Apart from their number, inscriptions of this type are remarkable for the fact that the great majority originate in the same general area of Gallia Lugdunensis. How such evidence is to be interpreted raises a number of questions of cen­tral interest to the cult of the Roman emperor. Toutain took the view that an official Imperial divinity (Augustus) is here associated with another deity: in other words the emperor is in all cases paid cult ut deus. 3 If so, the vast majority of these inscriptions would be in conflict with the rule laid down by Augustus that he might be worshipped only in company with Dea Roma (Suet. Aug. 52)-not that such a development would be so very surprising in itself. Both communities and individuals were free to worship the ruler as they saw fit (even without Roma)' and to link the emperor with a variety of gods in dedications would be no more irregular per se than to set up a statue assimilating him to a particular deity. But is Toutain's analysis, followed in large part by others, wholly acceptable? Does the emperor invariably appear 1 \"Roma et Augustus\" above, Vol. I, I, pp. 104 with note 50, 125f. 2 \"The Temple of the Three Gauls\", above, Vol. I, 2, p. 308, note I. , J. Toutain, Les eultes palens dans I'Empire romain, Paris, 1905-07 (1967), I, 225f. , 232. He treats dedications to the numen Augusti or numina Augustorum as a variant on those to the emperor invoked under the title Augustus or even with his human names. The cult of the numen should surely be kept separate; cf. \"Genius and Numen\", above, pp. 378-382 . • Chr.

Wherever it is clear that an altar or a statue serves the cult of the emperor, a dedication Augusto must naturally be understood as the dative appropriate to dedications to a god. It will be convenient to use the regular term \"votive dative\" in this context, though in practice the emperor seems not to have been the recipient of gifts dedicated ex voto.6 The way the votive dative had evolved needs no elaboration. 7 Greek statues are known to have been originally in the nature of Otvot9Tj(J.ot'tot with an inscription on their bases to the effect (usually) that A has dedicated (the statue of) B to the god C. But when statues came to be erected elsewhere than in the sanctuary the name of a par­ticular deity gave way to a loose notice of the gods in general (9wtc;), which itself was eventually dropped, leaving an honorific formula in the accusative: A has set up (a statue of) B or honoured B (with a statue). On the other hand with true dedicatory inscriptions-dedications to a god, that is-the dative of the deity was retained as the natural way of signifying that A has dedicated X to be god B. The usage was subsequently copied by Latin inscrip­tions to show that the object dedicated-a vase, tablet, metal plate, statue, altar, temple-has been given over to the deity. 8 In both Greek and Latin inscriptions the genitive can also be used to signify that the deity is now the owner. The force of Augusto in the double dedication formula at Lugdunum is therefore not in question: the altar is plainly dedicated to the emperor ut deus alongside the goddess Roma, with whom he shares the services of a priest. The same combination, originally in bronze lettering, occurs on the architrave of the municipal temple at Pola, where Augustus is also styled Caesar, divifilius, and pater patriae: Romae et Augusto Caesari divi fOlio) patri patriae (CIL 5, 18 = ILS 110; PI.

Iud. 1, 414).'4 One might also compare the juxtaposition of emperors with gods in iconography, as commonly in the third century.' 5 Dedications to Augustus alone (Augusto) seem of infrequent occurrence in the West but a temple to Augustus is attested at Puteoli (CIL 10, 1613),' 6 while the language of a dedication from Ilici seems to imply that the Emperor is put on the same level as a god: Augusto divi f I [C.] Maecius C. f Celer I [d]edit dedicavit (CIL 2, 3555). With these may be compared an inscription on a marble cippus at Perusia: Augusto I lucus I sacer. (CIL 11, 1922=ILS 5434). Then there is the formula Aug(usto) sacr(um) with which the centuria Petronia begins a dedication at Puteoli (CIL 10, 8178 = ILS 6321); also at Nola where the Laurinienses cultores d(omus?) d(ivinae?) have restored an earlier monument at their own expense (CIL 10, 1238; cf. CIL 11, 1923). A similar example is provided by the dedication of the freedman sevir C. lulius Martialis at Narona (CIL 3, 1769). All these texts could well refer to Augustus himself whereas similar instances of Aug. sacr., particularly in Lugdunensis, look to be mostly of a later period (see below, pp. 443f.). What the formula implies is clear from the definition of Gallus Aelius in Festus (Lindsay, p. 424, 14): sacrum est ... quod dis dedicatum atque consecratum est; so also Macr. Sat. 3, 7, 3: ... nam, quidquid destinatum est dis, sacrum vocatur (cf. 3, 3, 2). Sacrum is therefore appropriate to whatever is held to be the property of II Cf.

But the ambiguous position of the emperor-above men but below the gods-plainly led to incongruities. This is shown by a sample of dedications in which sacrum ought to imply an offering to a god, yet the emperor is given his normal roster of secular titles. Significantly several examples seem to refer to altars: [llmp. Caesari I divi j. Augusto I pontj. maxim. (sic) I [t]rib. potest. XXXVII I cos. XIII p.p. sacrum (CIL 5, 852: Aquileia); imp.

[a]edem et signa de sua pecunia fa ciunda curarunt (CIL 11, 3040 = ILS 106). Despite the level of the divine evoked by sacrum or the purpose of the structures and objects dedicated or financed, the wording of these various epigraphical texts makes clear that the emperor is addressed in his \"menschliche Wesenheit\". The association of the emperor with a deity other than Roma can present a rather different situation. The original Greek votive dative seems to have eventually weakened to the point where in many cases it became no more than an expression of honour or respect. 20 Thus there are inscriptions where (a 17 Wissowa, RuKR' 385 with n. 4, cf.

From about the time of Sulla inscriptions on marble tablets or statue bases, originally formulated in the accusative case after the Greek fashion, begin to have the name of the person honoured in the dative, which was to become the standard form of tituli honorari. 22 The usage is extremely common in buildings of a ll kinds, where it appears as a copy of a degraded or laicized form of an original votive dative.23 In consequence, inscriptions of this type-dedications to the emperor in the extended sense of the word-ought properly to be translated \"for\" rather than \"to\", especially in double ascriptions. For while the dedication or votive offering is to the god in question, it is clearly fo r the emperor, who is simply accorded an honorific mention.24 In terms of the analogy drawn 7) 83, compares the modern practice of inscribing a book with the name of the recipient or of dedicating to someone a thesis, for example; cf.

CIL 6, 12892 = ILS 8064; ClL 10, 6300 = lLS 8066a et passim). He suggests (187, cf. 233) that the text attempts to express an assimilation or identification. While such may be implied by the statue of Claudia, the word order surely combines the dative of honour (Claudiae Iustae) with the votive dative of the deity (For­tunae). This looks confirmed, for example, by CIL 2, 23 (= ILS 3175), cited by Wrede (p. 192): Veneri I victril ci Aug. sacr. I in honorem Lu I ciliae Lepidinae I Flavia Ti tiafiliae I pientissimae; d.

In most instances where the emperor is given his personal names in a com­bined dedication it seems likeliest that the dative should be treated as one of honour rather than of worship. This interpretation is sometimes supported by the word order such as when the names of the emperor appear in first place and are not connected by et with the votive dative of the deity. Thus an inscription from Vindonissa records the dedication of an arch in honour of Vespasian and to various divinities: imp. T. Vespasiano I Caesar. Aug. VII cos. I Marti Apolloni Minervae I arcum I vicani Vindonissenses I cur. T. Urbanio Mattoni ... I ... (there follows a laterculus of names) ... (ClL 13, 5195). A similar example should possibly be recognized on one of four altars from Paris: Tib. Caesare I Aug. lovi Optum[o] I Maxsumo[ ... ] I nautae Parisiac[ll I publice posieru I n[t] (sic) (CIL 13, 3026a = ILS 4613d).21 It is true that the name of the emperor appears in the ablative but, as Mowat noted long ago,28 normal practice would have called for the number of the con­sulship or the trib. pot. if a date had been intended. One might preferably treat the ablative as a provincialism (cf. maxsumo, posierunt) intended for the honorific dative alongside the votive dative of the deity. Again a fragmentary inscription from Abusina (Raetia) begins with a dedication to [Caracalla, Geta] and Julia (all in the honorific dative)29 fo llowed (without et) by a votive dedication to the Capitoline Triad and the genius of the Cohors III Britan­norum, to whom the prefect T. Flavius Felix has set up an altar on 1 st Dec., 211 in fulfilment of his vow (CIL 3, 5935). There can at any rate be no doubt of the dative of honour in a third dedication where the (abbreviated) name of Gaius is linked with the votive dative of the local deity Etnosus, to whom Anavus had paid his vow by erecting a statue: [C.] Caesari Ger l manici [{. ] Aug.

Vibius Martialis, centurion of the Legio X Gemina and his fellow soldiers of the vexillum of the same legion under his care associated Vespasian, Titus and Domitian with Hercules Sax­sanus, to whom he set up an altar in accordance with his vow: Herculi Sax­sana et I imp. Vispasiano (sic) I Aug. et Tit. imp. et I Domitiano Caesari I ... (CIL 13, 4624 = IL S 3453: Mediomatrici). The essential point of these inscriptions is that in associating the emperor with a deity they combine an expression of homage with an act of divine worship. That dedications linking (et) a deity with Augusto tout court should also be treated in the same way is one possibility which certainly deserves considera­tion. Augusto (usually in second place) would then be as much the dative of honour as imp. T. Vespasiano Caesar(i) Aug(usto) above and the combination of an honorific with a votive dative would not be in conflict with the Augustan regulation (above, p. 436). There can at any rate be no question of a joint cult as would certainly be the case if, say, priests of Augustus and Mercurius had left their traces.30 But inscriptions of such a kind are few in number and this fact, together with the circumstance that they mostly occur in a region of Lugdunensis where we find a concentration of dedications beginning Aug. saer.,3' strongly suggests that they should rather be treated in conjunction with the much larger class. As it happens, the term sacrum is occasionally recorded: lovi et Aug(usto) I sacrum (CIL 13, 2583b: Matisco; PI. LXXXII a); cf. Mercurio I et Augusto I sacrum (ibid. 1514: Ager Arvernorum), so it is not impossible that one should understand sacrum in other inscriptions where it is not actually engraved. If such were the case, it would accord with the general practice of tituli saeri, which attest the votive dative both with and without sacrum. As for the implication of the term, there can be no doubt that, formally at least, it puts the emperor in the category of a deity by apply­ing to him the same dedicatory formula as would be appropriate to a god.32 On the face of it, Aug(usto) before sacr(um) is a true votive dative, parallel to lovi sacrum, and the same looks to be true of inscriptions of the type Mer­curio et Augusto (without sacrum).33 Significantly the formula is applied to JO On the difficulty of telling whether the emperor actually shares a cult or is simply associated with a deity out of homage see Veyne, o.c. 83, n. 3 with examples. 31 Taeger, Charisma 252f.; Toutain (above, note 3) 45, noting examples in Tarraconensis and Dalmatia, 226; cf.

Index p. 926, s.v. Mercurius)-this despite the use of a punctuation stop after sacrum. As for the formula Augusto sacrum, commonly abbreviated Aug. sacr.,36 one point self-apparent is that it is mostly a conventional formality. In some instances this feature is clear from the physical layout of the inscription such as when Aug. sacr. is inscribed on a part of the stone away from the main body of the inscription. On a small column from Gissey-le-VieiJ, for instance, the formula appears supra capitulum removed from the main text, which is an \"ex-voto\" dedication to dea Rosmerta (elL 13, 2831 = lLS 4611). Again on the bronze base of a statue presumably of deus Bellatumarus(?) both Aug. sac. and v.s.l.m. appear on the back whereas the principal inscription appears on the front (elL 13, 11224: Cavillonum). Here one has the impression that the formula is added almost as an afterthought since it hardly makes sense at this point in the word order; in the majority of cases it appears at the begin­ning of the text, very often on a line to itselp7 though this is naturally deter­mined by the shape and size of the stone.38 It follows that in the many instances where the inscription ends v.s.l .m., the vow is paid to the deity in question and has no relation whatsoever to the emperor, a circumstance occa� sionally recognized in the Corpus when the text is given in extenso with a period after Aug(usto) sacr(um) (cf. elL 13, 2840 = lLS 4657). Thus in an inscription from Fontes Sequanae Aug. sac. is set apart on the upper portion of a stone on which Flavius Flavialis pays to dea Sequana the vow he had vowed on behalf of the salus of Flavius Lunaris(?), his nepos (elL 13, 2862; cf. 2863). Then there is the text pricked out on a bronze lagoena in which Sextus Mart(ius?) Cocillus specifically states that he pays his vow to Deus Albius and Damona ex iussu eius (sc. eorum); the inscription nevertheless l4 Above, note II. II G.

Jullian, Inscriptions romaines de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, 1887, I, 3-13, suggests that the association of the emperor with the genius of the civitas implies the emperor is himself considered a tutelary genius. The situation is surely that the emperor is treated ut deus-on level terms with the Genius Civitatis. \" So CIL 13, 566, 2608f., 2636, 2656, 2887, 2891, 2898, 2899, 2900, 2903f., 11223, 11225f., 11233 (= 2840), 11240, 11239a; ILTG 314; cf.

(CIL 13, 2901); similar examples occur passim.39 This interpretation will be equally valid of \"ex-voto's\" beginning Mercurio et Augusto or vice versa (without sacrum),40 where the vow is surely paid not to the emperor and the god but to the god, alongside whom the emperor is given a reverent mention: cf. IL TG 344: fragmentary but apparently reading [Aug(usto)] et I M[art]i Mu [I(loni)] I ex c(onsilio) or c(onsulto) dei ... The point becomes all the plainer in the case of statue-bases bearing a dedication to a deity since the statue of the god will in most instances have stood above. The statue with its base has no direct connection with the emperor-there is again no question of joint cult-yet the inscription includes the Aug. sacr. formula. Thus the base of a statue of Apollo (of which only the feet survive) has the dedication: Aug. sacr[um] I deo Apo[lIiml (CIL 13, 2898: Ager Senonum) and much the same text is inscribed on the bases of the two statues which Sextus Orgius Suavis set up to deus Mercurius and deus Hercules respectively (CIL 13, 2608f.: Cavillonum).41 With these one may compare the dedication Mercurio I et Augusto I sacrum engraved on the torso of a bronze statue of Mercury bearded, holding the marsupium (CIL 13, 1514: Ager Arvernorum). The argument applies a fortiori to the dedication of a temple to the Celtic deity Epona, goddess of horses (CIL 13, 2902 = ILS 4839: Intaranum), or to the dedication of a wall between two arches by Mediusacer, son of Mediannus, who associates with dea Clutoida the vicani Masavenses'2 (CIL 13, 2895 = ILS 4702). The conclusion to be drawn is that, although the formula does formally imply a cult act, it is nevertheless a stereotype much resembling IN H.D.D., which can also preface a dedication to a god. Despite the fact that, technically speaking, sacrum puts the emperor on equal terms with a deity, the phrase is no more than a formal gesture-as though some sort of obligation was felt to make a reverent nod in the direction of the ruler. 43 The psychology underlying these inscriptions is essentially the same as that at work behind the conversion of gods of all kinds into Augustan gods;44 and, just as with the epithet Augustus, it may be suspected that the J9 Cf.

There remain one or two oddities that call for comment. The base for a statue of a three-horned bull found near Augustodunum is inscribed Aug. sacrum I Boiiorix I dae (sic) sua pe l cunia (CIL 13, 2656). On the face of it the piece is dedicated to the Augustus; in practice this is more probably a repetition of the stereotype and the name of the animal deity to whom it was dedicated has simply not been inscribed.

The dedicants Vitalis and his wife then record the payment of a vow to some divinity whose name is not disclosed. The meaning cannot be that the vow has been paid to the Augustus. Lastly, an epigraphical poem from Bonn is of particular significance for the ideological background of the ruler cult; it records that [C.?] Fulvius Max­imus, leg.

One might compare the association of the emperor with the gods by the placing of his statue in the cella of some divinity-even beside the idol,47 or the way in which Roman emperors are placed uncompromisingly on a par with the Olympian gods in the panels of the Sebasteion at Aphrodisias.48 There is no indication of date, but it has been proposed that Fulvius Maximus might have been one of the consules ordinarii for A.D. 227 or 263.49 If so, the poem illustrates how a high Roman official could refer to Caesar at a period characterized by the outright identification of the imperial family with a wide range of divinities and by the increasing application of sanctifying terminology to the emperor. so 4l Taeger's suggestion (above, note 5) that Aug. saer. is a local variant on numini Aug. runs into the difficulty that inscriptions to the Imperial numen are generally of a much later date. 46 Occasional instances occur in Aquitania; cf. elL 13, 566. \" \"Liturgy and Ceremonial\", below, pp. 540-550. 4' R.

AUGUSTAN GODS The term \"Gods\" applies in the first instance to the major deities of the Olympian circle that are styled' Augustan' on inscriptions; but with the exten­sion of the fashion to Celtic and other regions of the empire it later includes Greek, Oriental, and astrological divinities together with an endless prolifera­tion of local gods and godlings. Not included under the normal definition of Augustan Gods are Augustan Blessings and Virtues even though these too are certainly minor deities. I A god could be made Augustan in either of two ways: by attaching the genitive Augustil Augustorum or by applying the epithet Augustus/Augusta. That any subtle distinction was intended seems most unlikely when both forms are found with a particular deity: for example: Her­culi Augusti (elL 3, 3305); Herculi Augusto (ibid. 3390).2 The average Roman or provincial who set up an inscription was neither a semanticist nor a theologian, nor for that matter were the officials responsible for the legends on coins. Still, the use of the genitive clearly referred the deity to the emperor more directly, less equivocably,3 and it may well be for that reason that the form was considered too outspoken or extravagant for Roman tastes. At all events what the bulk of the evidence we have suggests is that the adjectival usage was the preferred form with major deities.4 The significance of the adjective Augustus/a has given rise to a good deal of discussion. In an occasional case, preserved under the Republic, the word seems to mean nothing more than 'august' or 'sacrosanct', S but in most cases the reference must be the reigning emperor;6 to label a deity' Augustan', that is, stamps that deity as profoundly associated with the emperor. Wissowa's interpretation was that to add Augustus to Hercules, for example, implied that the god was paid cult in the same way as the devout emperor worshipped , See \"Augustan Blessings & Virtues\", below, pp. 455ff. , For other examples of the genitive see elL 13, 1728: deo Apollini Augusti; elL 3, 10914: Spincibus Augg.; elL 3, 10975: Fortun(a)e Mercurio Silvano Augg.; perhaps also elL 12, 2595; elL 3, 5531: see below, note 19.

As a rule, the more remote or outlandish a divinity, the less likelihood there is that those who set up the dedication had any real understanding of the purpose or implication of the Augustan qualification. By far the most satisfactory theory is that to apply the qualification Augustus/a is a continuation of a custom that already had a long history at Rome-one for which there is a good deal of earlier precedent. Radke, now followed by Fears, has shown that a god's epithet was a necessary means of defining the sphere of his or her peculiar powers: for example, Lucina, Sospita or Matuta applied to Juno specify the characteristic activity of the goddess.lo In other cases a suffix drawn from the name of another deity creates a link between their individual spheres-Ianus Quirinus or Quirini, for example. Of particular interest are examples where a family name was attached to that of some god or goddess: Ianus Curiatius or Lares Hostilii. II The implication of the gentile adjective was that the deity operates within the sphere of the family, which consequently enjoys the special protection or assistance of its patron deity; hence the occasional use of such epithets as meus, suus, domesticus indicating a privileged association with the deity.

Whether they understood it or not, then, those using the epithet were loyally asking the deity to bless the emperor, whose welfare was vital to every member of the empire. 1 S But what one suspects is that in the great majority of cases this was simply not understood and that the adjectival form, like the genitive Augusti, came as a result to mean simply 'Royal' or 'Imperial' .16 Thus the habit of making a god 'Augustan' must be viewed as little more than a mechanical process, a conven­tional gesture that fl attered the emperor or expressed passive sympathy with the state and its policies.

The astonishing range of Augustan deities, some of them known only from a single record, can only increase as inscriptions accumulate and new gods are attested.20 Surely what was uppermost in the mind of the worshipper setting up a local dedication was not the emperor, but Acionna (elL 13, 3063), Haos (elL 8, 4641), or Gesacus (elL 13, 3488), Augustus being added mechanically as a standard convention. Even with the Olympians the case for identification is very dubious wherever an Augustan divinity is associated with a temple. For example the temples of Minerva Augusta at Tarraco (elL 2, 4085) or of Jupiter Pantheus Augustus at Nescania (elL 2, 2008)21 must be the shrines of Minerva or Jupiter Pantheus, not of the Roman emperor. Objections become overwhelming whenever a dedication to an Augustan deity is coupled with the pro salute formula.22 What sense would there be in paying cult to the emperor in the guise of Aesculapius (elL 8, 12228) or Hygia (elL 8, 14874) on behalf of his own salus? Such a combination rather confirms the view that an Augustan god is one whose protection is sought for the emperor-here explicitly pro salute imperatoris. This interpretation is strengthened and outright identification simultaneously excluded in an inscription from Pisaurum where Hercules Augustus is stated to be the con­sors of Aurelian (elL 11, 6308).23 The point would also apply to formulations 17 F. Stahelin, Die Schweiz in romischer Zeit', Basel, 1948,505, n. 2 with refs . Cf. M. M.

CIL 3, 5531: Herculi Aug. n . Stahelin (above, note 17) ibid. argues that this is decisive for the view that the emperor is here identified with Mercury. But in both instances the genitive may well be intended-Aug(usti) n(ostri)-thus associating the deity to whom the vow is paid (v.s.l.m.) with the emperor. Alter­natively the use of noster might correspond to that of meus, suus, domesticus (above, p. 447) if the meaning is MercuriolHerculi Aug(usto) n(ostro). 20 Green observes (above, note 9) that there are one hundred and eleven gods modified by the word Augustus in the ThLL. \" Etienne, Culte imperial 338. 22 For example, CIL 8, 4674, 12094, 14465, 14546, 14791 , 14874, 15512, 17837: 3, 8086. \" Identification is also impossible in a dedication to Hercules Augustus on behalf of the salus o f the three Augusti: CIL 3, 3390: cf. 3427."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"450 BOOK II such as that apparently on an inSCrIptIOn from Narbonne: [Ap] 01/[11 ni Au[gusto] I let num]ini [Augusto]rum I sac[r]um I ...

These considerations help to clarify a number of variations on the standard formula of an Augustan deity that occur with some frequency, particularly in the provinces of the north-west. A glance through the examples listed in ThLL will show that Augustus sometimes precedes the deity: for example Augustus Acionna, Augustus Rudiobus (PI. LXXXIII a), Augustus Apollo, Augustus Mars Mullo, Augusta Minerva;25 and the fact that this occurs in regions where the epithet more often follows the god's name rules out any possibility of a basic theological distinction between the two. Augustus Mercurius can be no more than a stylistic variation on Mercurius Augustus. But what one fre­quently finds both in the Celtic world and elsewhere is that the word deus is placed before the name of the divinity, a practice that is usually taken to indicate a local god, not a Roman.26 There is no difficulty then in recognizing deus Mercurius Augustus (elL 13, 2606), or deus Mars Augustus (elL 12, 2653) as the local Mercury or Mars made into an Augustan god by the epithet AugustuS.27 It follows that the same must be true of such formulations as Augustus deus I.O.M. (elL 13, 3184), which is simply a variant form of an Augustan Celtic divinity. 28 But what if the name of the god was not known or at least not given? Of particular interest in this connection is a group of African inscriptions with the bare formula Dis Augustis,29 among them the dedication from the frieze of a small temple that was constructed in the open area of the portico behind the theatre at Lepcis.30 As the dedication can be assigned to A.D. 43 \" So rightly M.

Exactly how an inscription, as opposed to a statue or relief, would in practice indicate his outright identification with, say, Mercury or Hercules raises an interesting question since secure examples where one can observe the process in operation seem infrequent in Latin inscriptions.

AUGUSTAN BLESSINGS AND VIRTUES The deification of concepts or qualities is a phenomenon characteristic of both Greek and Roman religious belief. I At what stage such entities found a place in Roman religious development is very much debated. Wissowa theorized that abstractions (to use the conventional term) set out in life as aux­iliary functions of major deities and became detached, the functions then being worshipped as independent godheads.2 Specialized activities, identified by epithets, were at first attributed to Jupiter or Mars, only to split off in the course of time and become separate divinities as the specializations became increasingly prominent-Victoria, for example, began as an off-shoot of Jupiter Victor. Firm evidence for such a process is nevertheless very thin and J. R. Fears in particular has made a strong case against assigning Fides, Vic­toria, Iuventas or Fortuna to the earliest stratum of Roman religion.3 Against this explanation must be weighed the doctrine more popular among modern scholars of the original concept of an impersonal, all-pervading divine power or numen, as it came to be called, with special agencies-numina-that pro­duced the condition or performed the function which their name describes.4 The attraction of this view is that it chimes with the way \"Blessings\" and \"Virtues\"S look to have come into existence: as a response to the com­munity's need for some particular condition or quality. Thus Concordia arose from the need to end the civil conflict brought on by the Licinian-Sextian laws.6 Such Sonderg6tter were continually recognized as historical experience dictated and are typical products of the Roman religious mentality. 1.

Per­sonifications had been deified in early Greek poetry and represented in art as early as the archaic period but in the city-states of classical Greece they were objects of cult as well as political slogans.9 Of greatest significance is the place of such concepts in the ideologies of Hellenistic monarchies. Confrontated by the achievements of Alexander and the Diadochi, men could only believe that their deeds were manifestations of divine favour; hence the development of a philosophy of kingship that emphasized the god-like qualities of the ruler, through the exercise of which the state was made prosperous, efficient, safe and victorious.1o From the second Samnite war onwards the Romans came more and more into contact with such Greek concepts as Homonoia, Eunomia, Eirene, Tyche, Dike, Nike and many more, a programme of ideas that they imaginatively took over and adapted to their own purpose through the medium of the cult of abstractions. The most striking example is the introduction of Nike-Victoria\" but, as Fears has demonstrated, other deified abstractions at Rome also reflect the influence of Greek political theory and statecraft: Genius Publicus, Mens, Iuventus, Salus, Spes, Fortuna, Fides, Libertas, Pietas.12 The most important development for present purpose is the personalization of abstractions, their attachment to a particular statesman or general rather than to the Roman people as a whole. 13 By the end of the Republic the practice of associating specific concepts with the charismatic individual was an estab­lished tradition.

The concepts that stood behind these names found expression in the earthly deeds of the monarch, entitling him to be paid extraordinary honours, but there seems to be no example in the Hellenistic Age of the cult of the king's Virtues parallel to later Greek cults of the Virtues of a Roman emperor; 14 one honoured the monarch himself rather than his qualities. The reverse idea was more in tune with Roman conservatism. So Fabius Maximus was early associated with Mens, Scipio Africanus Maior with Pietas, and from the time of the Gracchi leading families sought to link their gens with a specific concept: the Scipio's with Virtus for example. Sulla adver­tized the favour of Felicitas, to whom he attributed his rise to power, by tak­ingfelix as cognomen and appropriating her attribute the caduceus on coins. The name of Metellus Pius likewise played on his connection with Pietas. But the dissociation of abstractions from the state and their transfer to an individual is seen most closely in Cicero's De lege Manilia, where the qualities of Pompey are the justification for the unprecedented powers conferred upon him. Lastly, Caesar's achievements are commemorated by celebrating his qualities on coins or in the names of the colonies he has established.

No label is entirely satisfactory but it will be convenient for pres­ent purposes to appropriate Cicero's distinction between res expetendae and virtutes, despite the difficulties this sometimes raises (De leg. 2, 11,28).37 The more prominent \"Blessings\" or \"desirable conditions\" would then be Abun­dantia, Adventus, Aeternitas, Annona, Bonus Eventus, Concordia, Disciplina, Fortuna, Fecunditas, Felicitas, Hilaritas, Laetitia, Libertas, Pax, Perpetuitas, Quies, Salus, Securitas, Spes, Tranquillitas, Victoria.

Some features of these deified abstractions are hardly in contention. The suggestion has been made that, as mental concepts, impersonal qualities or states unsupported by myth, they can never have passed for supernatural beings-that they were \"a non-descript and shadowy crowd\" in whom no intelligent pagan, educated or not, could possibly believe.38 Yet the very fact that Arnobius ridicules the Romans for turning the blessings they prayed for into divine powers or that Lactantius had to insist such qualities were not of themselves divine surely confirms that at least some people did believe in them.39 Absurd as they were to the sophisticated intellectual, Virtues and Blessings were evidently felt to be real, independent godheads, deities in the full sense of the word, who could be the object of sincere cult paid both by state colleges and private worshippers.4o That no essential difference was made between them and the Olympians is clear from the way they were recog­nized and treated in cult practice. Just as temples were founded under the Republic to Concordia, Victoria, Salus, Fortuna, Spes, Honos, Virtus, Mens and the rest (above, pp. 455f.), so under Augustus and Tiberius altars were raised to Fortuna Redux, Pax Augusta, Providentia Augusta, Pietas, Amicitia and Clementia.41 In the same way their festivals are indistinguishable from those of other deities in the calendars42-even priests are occasionally \" For discussion see Wissowa, RuKR' 327f.; Axtell.

These confirm that from the Julio­Claudians to the Severi such abstractions as Felicitas, Salus Publica, Pro­videntia, Concordia, Aeternitas Imperii, Honos, Clementia, Fortuna Redux and Victoria were invoked or received sacrifice on the same footing as \"real\" gods; in other words they ranked alongside the Capitoline Triad, Mars, Nep­tune, Vesta, Divus Augustus, the Genius of the Emperor or of the Roman People as major deities, whose goodwill and favour were vital to the well­being of the state.44 Significantly, such recognition was accorded by leading senators in their capacity as Fratres Arvales.45 Private cult presents a comparable picture. The best index to popular piety is the offerings made to Virtues and Blessings in fulfillment of a vow. Whereas in the Republican period one finds private ex voto's to Fortuna and Victoria in particular, but also to Felicitas, Honos, Spes and other qualities, under the empire it is Imperial abstractions that attract widespread devotion.46 Augustan Fortune and Victory in particular receive dedications and ex voto's not just from those in the emperor's service but from men and women of all manner of occupation and at every level of society. What is more significant such vows were made for the private intentions of the individual as well as for the emperor's salus.

Essentially they are a separate class of god heads rec­ognized simply from the manifestation of their numen and invoked by the name of the benefit the worshipper is seeking. 50 In consequence it is surely right to characterize such functional numina as shadowy, less substantial entities than the Olympians. How precisely would the average Roman have conceived of the deity Tempestates?51 Theological issues become more complex once Blessings and Virtues are made specifically Imperial. This can be achieved in either of two ways: by qualifying the abstraction Augusti/ Augustorum or Augustus/Augusta. Both forms correspond to the standard Roman practice of designating the function of a god by the addition of an attributive epithet, of defining in this way the sphere in which the god performs his special function. \"Die zweiten Glieder eines Doppelnamens vermogen also den funktionalen Bereich der im erst en Gliede genannten Gottheit anzugeben\". 52 The Blessing or Virtue is thus intimately associated with the emperor, just as major Olympian or other deities are made the emp��01 Sondergotter by the defining suffix Augustus/ a or the genitive Augustil Augustorum (usually the former).53 As archaic practice makes clear, either form can be employed to this end: for example Ianus Quirini occurs with Ianus Quirinus, Nerio Martis with Numisius Martius, Moles Martis with Heres Martea; Fears adds that the same holds for later creations such as Genius Publicus, Genius Populi Romani. 54 It seems clear then that no significant distinction in usage can be made between the two, and the same must be true of Augusti/ Augustorum and Augustus/a.55 Both forms equally well declare and define the Victory, Peace, Virtue, Clemency, Justice, Providence and so on that operate within the \" Mattingly, BMC 2, xxxvii; 4, xxvi. ,.

One would doubt, for instance, that Ceres Augusta \"proclaimed the divine power manifested in the imperial annona\" (Fears 894). The meaning is surely Ceres, who is a special god of Augustus, giving him assistance in everything connected with the grain supply. A. D.

S6 As a result, it has been conclud­ed more often than not that both forms are identical in meaning, that Pax Augusti and Pax Augusta, for instance, mean exactly the same thing. S7 The contrary case has been argued by Mattingly, who holds that the genitive relates the personification directly to the emperor, whereas the adjective implies a looser association with the imperial system in general:s8 on this view Pax Augusti would be \"the Peaceableness of the reigning Emperor\" and Pax Augusta \"Imperial Peace\". This is really an adoption of Strack's thesis that the genitive has a close and clear reference to the emperor, the adjectival form being looser. S9 For example, Strack would interpret Felicitas Augusti as the goddess that watches over the Augustus and his undertakings, Felicitas Augusta as the blessed circumstance that goes out from the Augustus.6o Whether such a distinction between the genitival and adjectival forms would have been recognized by the general public is an open question but the point that A ugusti makes a Blessing or Virtue very personal is surely correct. 61 It is substantiated in a negative way by the fact that the genitive rarely appears with major deities, presumably because so close a link between the emperor and a deity would have given offence;62 instead the adjective is preferred. Similarly Augustus opted for the more general Victoria Augusta rather than the personal Victoria Augusti, consciously breaking with the practice of Caesar in this respect,63 and under Tiberius the altar erected on the twenty­fifth anniversary of his adoption by Augustus was that of Providentia Augusta.64 On the coins it is li kewise the adjectival form that first takes the field and an early departure from this practice could be seen as a deliberate 56 For example, on the suppression of Sejanus in A.D. 31 dedications were made at Interamna to Salus Perpetua Augusta along with Libertas Publica Populi Romani, the Genius of the municipality, and the Providentia of Tiberius (ILS 157).

Aberration from the norm under his immediate successors may also attest a perceived difference, but even under Augustus exceptions to the adjectival usage suggest that the distinction very early broke down or at least was not generally recognized. Weinstock notes that an altar at Capua was dedicated to Victoria Caesaris Augusti, as also were games at Iguvium.70 Thereafter the regular practice is for Victoria to be coupled with the name of the reigning emperor in the genitive (Victoria Claudii, Galbae, Othonis, Vespasiani), just as Augusti is applied to abstrac­tions on coins.

It is very doubtful, too, whether Augusta, as applied to an abstraction, could allude directly to Livia, who was herself consecrated Augusta after death. Even should Livia be identified on coins with Pietas Augusta or Salus Augusta,15 A ugusta is surely feminine because it refers to the deity, where it has the implication we have seen-not because of any primary reference to Livia.'6 Even when a lady of the imperial household bears the title Augusta in her lifetime and is identified or associated with, say, a Virtue qualified Augusta, the epithet must still apply in the first place to the abstraction, though it will naturally have had the secondary connotation of a title. 71 Critical to the theology of Augustan Blessings and Virtues is the precise way in which these were conceived to exercise their divine influence upon the emperor. Here it is possible to distinguish between two diff erent ideas. Which way a particular Blessing or Virtue was imagined to function would appear to depend at least to some extent on the degree to which it was personified, but in many instances evidence is insufficient to allow one to determine either way, in others the testimony we have is conflicting. In the first place a Blessing or Virtue can be conceived as the emperor's comes or guiding star, a tutelary deity that accompanied him and under whose protection he stood.'8 The comparison with the personal genius is very obvious; in fact abstractions imagined along these lines appear almost as specializations of the genius. The concept of a guardian deity can best be illustrated by citing a number of examples where the theology seems reasonably clear. Of all examples of the comes the most similar to the Genius Augusti is Fortuna Augusti-Fortuna comes, as Lucan calls her (Phars. 5, 510).'9 Fortuna Aug. first appears on the coinage of Galba,80 who had a per­sonal devotion to her and kept a bronze statue of the goddess, more than a \" Grant, Imperial Money (above, note 4) 155, 162, 167. \" Pietas Augusta: Weinstock, DJ 255, n. 8 with refs.; Salus Augusta: ibid. , 172, n. 7, cf.

Pius 12, 5, cf. Marcus 7, 3). The story is repeated of Septimius Severus, who reportedly thought of having two statues made but in his last hours had the one figure alternate daily between his two sons (SHA, Sev. 23, 5f.). Such a representation of a deity was a talisman that could be worshipped and offered sacrifice (cf. Suet., Galbo 4, 3). Its reported existence emphasizes the role assigned to Fortuna Augusti as a divine companion, who attached to each individual ruler during his reign, then passed to his successor when he died.82 Through the favours of Fortuna came Felicitas;83 in fact it has been argued that in some respects the ideas of Fortuna and Felicitas overlap or approach identity, though in general the two terms seem to have been kept apart. 84 At all events Felicitas was clearly imagined as daimon-hic habitat Fetidtas (elL 4, 1454)-and Felicitas Augusti, like Fortuna Augusti, seems to have been conceived a goddess that accompanied the emperor on his enter­prises and brought him luck.85 This is particularly true of military successes; cf. the inscription Fetidtas Tiberi on the shield shown on the sword-sheath of \"Tiberius\" from Mainz (PI. LXXXIV).86 The supernatural companion par excellence was Victoria Augusti, who was personal to each ruler in turn (see below, 471f.) and went before to render func­tional assistance;87 victories won in the field would thus be attributable to the working of her numen.

(Trist. 2, 169-1 76) The character of Victoria is likewise brought out in the poet's description of the war between Minos and Nisus: Et pendebat adhuc belli fo rtuna, diuque Inter utrumque vo/at dubiis Victoria pennis. (Met. 8, 12f) Literary imagery aside, it is surprising that she is not called comes more often, but the term appears on coins of the emperors of Gaul, Postumus, Victorinus and Tetricus I and II, also on those of Carausius and Allectus in Britain.91 With these may be compared two late inscriptions: Victori I ae divinae I Vir­tutis I comiti Auggg. r(es) p(ub/ica) c(oloniae) L(ambaesitanae) (CIL 8, 18240 = lLS 381 1; Lambaesis: time of Constantine?); Victoriae Augustae I comiti dominorum I principumque nostror(um) I ...

The text that best illustrates her nature perhaps is Pan.Lat. 6 (7) 5, 4, (Baehrens p. 204): \"ita pervectus ut non comitata ilium sit sed praestolata Victoria\".

Cicero classifies Spes, Salus and Ops with Victoria as faculties to be sought from the gods, though it is by no means clear that he envisions them as com­panion deities.96 Valerius Maximus portrays the sanctissimum Pietatis numen as accompanying Tiberius en route to Drusus,97 while a coin of Carausius pro­vides a late and isolated instance of Providentia as comes.98 As Fears notes, Virtus, Honos or Concordia can be represented in imperial art as companions attendant, like Victoria, upon the emperor.

On the interpretation of R. Turcan it was under the Empire of the Gauls that the political theology of the Di Comites was enlarged and defined more precisely, anticipating in a way the Jovian-Herculean theology of the Tetrarchy.'04 Conversely the deceased emperor Divus Claudius II can himself be described in panegyric as deorum comes (Pan.Lat. 6 [7], 2,2). On the whole, then, the notion of a Blessing or Virtue as a companion deity must be considered the exception rather than the rule. In the great majority of cases, where no firm evidence for the idea of comes exists, it seems best to think in terms of the general theory of the emperor as a 6&ro� �V6PW1tO� through whom divinity can function. lOS On this view the Augustus would be a kind of vessel in whom and through whom a deified quality or condition finds earthly expression.106 Thus Cicero categorizes Mens, Virtus, Fides and Concordia as deities having their seat within ourselvesl07 and, in applauding the arbitrary deification of Mens, Pietas, Virtus and Fides, he remarks that temples have been publicly dedicated to these at Rome ... ut ilia qui habeant ... deos ipsos in animis suis conlocatos putent (De leg. 2, 11, 28).

What the above discussion has tried to show is that ideas differed as to the precise way in which a particular deified concept was conceived. Careful sif­ting of all the relevant literary, epigraphic and numismatic evidence might reveal further traces of Virtues and Blessings conceived as comites, but clearly one must be prepared for a good deal of flexibility in the way these god-heads were imagined.

If a more strongly personified abstraction, such as Victoria, accompanies the emperor, then it is through the help of his comes that the emperor wins vic­tories. Yet, even if her numen is not exactly within him, it is through the vic­tories of the emperor that Victoria manifests herself.

One subordinate question merits passing notice at this point, since the theory has attracted a considerable following over the years. Gage has argued that, just as victory belongs to each individual victor (Victoria Sullae, Caesaris), so the Victoria Augusti is the personal victory of Octavian, not of his successors. I 16 As a result, Victoria Augusti became the object of a dynastic cult under succeeding lulio-Claudian rulers, and this continued to be the case under the following dynasty except that the Victoria Augusti was now adopted by the house founded by Vespasian, who in this way laid claim to the vic­torious power by which the empire was governed. Thus even under the Fla­vians Victoria is the goddess that had helped Octavian and Augusti still refers to Augustus himself, long since deified. Only at the end of the century, when the dynastic principle gives way to the adoptive, does Victoria become autonomous and Augusti apply to each current emperor in turn, who has his individual Victory watching over him. The difficulty with this view is that it rests too much on the unprovable interpretation of uncertain details, particularly in the artistic composition of the sword-sheath of \"Tiberius\", the Grand Camee de France, or the Camee de Vienne; 117 the literary sources offer no help on the point whatsoever. Nothing in Gage's arguments proves conclusively that Victoria Augusti was believed to be the Victory of Divus Augustus, the power of which continued to work after Augustus' death by raining down from heaven upon one ruler after another. Nor does there seem any reason to doubt that Augusti denotes, as usual, the current reigning emperor rather than the first Augustus, who would surely be described after death as Divus Augustus. liS What the discus­sion suggests is that Victoria Augusti was not a companion of Oct avian exclusively but a comes who gave her help and was attached to each successive ruler in turn.'19 Like the name Augustus, Victoria, too, became transmissible, assuming an important place in the legal formulation of an emperor's powers. The simple fact that Victoria Claudii, Galbae, Othonis, Vespasiani and so on 116 Gage (above, notes 57, 90) throughout; cf. id., \"Divus Augustus.

If the Pro­videntia Augusti of Augustus himself provided for the succession of Tiberius, it was the Providentia Augusti of Vespasian or Nerva that provided for a suitable successor. A fo rtiori it was certainly the Providentia of the reigning Augustus that was evinced in different ways under succeeding emperors. I\" 3. Abstractions and the Imperial Cult It remains to stress once more the key place of deified abstractions within the Roman imperial cult. The rule was for direct worship of the emperor to be withheld until after death, when he had been enrolled among the state gods by due process of deification. 122 In life his role was that of a superman who occupied an ambiguous, intermediary position between Heaven and Earth, between gods and men. As such, he was venerated through the cults of his genius and numen or of Augustan Virtues and Blessings, which we have seen to resemble the Genius Augusti or Numen Augusti insofar as they were con­ceived as concomitant or immanent. To pay cult to the deified qualities of a man was something new, apparently without precedent in the Hellenistic World (above, p. 457), though it is possible that a Republican forerunner is to be seen in the cult of a magistrate's virtues by Greek cities in Asia Minor, a practice attested in the case of Cicero's brother Quintus (Ad Q.Fr. 1, 1, 31).123 This was the system the first Augustus hit upon and it was developed and extended by later rulers, especially the Antonines, who invented and multiplied Imperial abstractions.124 To worship the godheads whose numen found expression in the activities of an individual was clearly more moderate than to worship the man himself and afforded an effective outlet for the emo­tions felt towards an emperor whose personal characteristics were vital to the well-being of his subjects. Yet to exalt the princeps in this way was more than just an advanced form of flattery. On the theological level the emperor was clearly set above the rank of an ordinary mortal by having divinized Blessings and Virtues as his special companions or immanent within him; in one way or the other he is brought near to or associated with a special class of divine 120 Weinstock, DJ 112, n. 3 with refs.; cf.

It can thus be seen that Blessings and Virtues played an integral part in the attempt to portray the emperor as a charismatic, beneficent monarch.'2s They contributed to the imperial mystique just as did the assimilation or iden­tification of the emperor with gods or the placing of his head on the obverse of a coin, the side of honour reserved for gods up to the time of Julius Caesar.'26 Popular belief might well conclude that the emperor enjoyed the special protection of his divine companions or was divinely inspired by the gods who had their seat within his soul. 127 In conclusion it is worth calling attention, in passing, to the final develop­ment of Blessings and Virtues into titles. Already in the first century A.D., when the legal character of the emperor's titulature was uppermost, honorific titles are already apparent in his \"unofficial titulature\"; even Augustus or pater patriae belong more to the sphere of veneration or adulation.128 The trend from legalistic to honorific, fr om positive to superlative, becomes more prominent with the conferral on Trajan of the titles optimus and maximus linking the emperor and his rule with the supreme god Jupiter.129 The con­tribution of imperial abstractions to the development is very clear. Thus the title piissimus, sometimes attributed to Nerva, has an obvious connection with Pietas.'3o Felix begins its career as a title with Commodus and is associated thereafter with almost every emperor, often in conjunction with pius or fo r­tissimus; in the 3rd century A.D. pius, felix and invictus occur alongside imperator and Augustus as a regular part of imperial titulature.'3' A similar development can be seen in the case of other virtues.

By the fourth century A.D. such forms were common as Providentia Tua, Clementia Nostra, Vestra Pietas, Vestra Tran­quillitas.

LITURGY AND CEREMONIAL Literary evidence on the forms and observances of the ruler cult in the Latin provinces is practically non-existent, no more than a few half-sentences scat­tered in authors mostly of a late period. Such direct testimony as we happen to have is restricted to sundry echoes in the inscriptions and bas- reliefs, which of themselves are insufficient to provide a basis for reconstruction. Never­theless by comparing these fleeting traces with evidence from Rome, Italy and the eastern provinces, where the picture is often much clearer, it becomes possible to piece together a reasonably clear outline of the liturgy and ceremonial of the Western imperial cult. I While it would be dangerous to assume that the development in the Latin West was necessarily parallel to that in the East2, cautious inference from the rites of the Greek-speaking provinces is surely in order, particularly when similar usages can already be identified in the ritual practices of Rome and Italy or when Roman practices have been adopted locally in the East. 1. Insignia and Costume Tacitus records that Segimundus, provincial priest at the Ara Ubiorum, dramatized his defection from the Roman cause by tearing his fillets: quippe anna quo Germaniae descivere sacerdos apud aram Ubiorum creatus ruperat vittas, profugus ad rebelles. (Ann. 1, 57, 2). These vittae3 must correspond to the woollen bandalettes with which a Romanflamen had to bind his head out of doors whenever he did not wear his distinctive hat-for example, because of hot weather (Serv. ad Aen. 8, 664). Such fillets were mystic attributes and a badge of priesthood; hence the significance of Segimundus' action. But on festival days-and necessarily when sacrificing-a Roman f/amen donned a skin hat (galerus, pileus) ending in a spike of olive-wood (apex), which was itself enveloped by a thread of wool (apiculum).4 The term apex came to be applied to the entire headgear and one of the quainter restrictions on the I Military rites are omitted from consideration except for comparative purposes as they are best treated in the context of military ruler cult in general (Vol. Ill, 4). , Cf. s.

That the hat of the provincial high priests closely followed the Roman fashion is confirmed by iconographic evidence from the temple at Tarraco, where a frieze is decorated with the apex of the provincial f1amen; cheek straps for tying under the chin are clearly displayed (Vol. I, 1, Pis. XXXI, XXXII a). S Municipal priests, too, wore a similar cap, as attested by the apex shown on the cippus of a localflamen at Apta (CIL 12, 1 1 14), also by the base of C.

The model from which the head-gear of imperial priests was copied is well exampled on the Ara Pacis, where what are evidently the three Flamines Maiores and the new flam en of Divus Iulius wear the galerus with apex.7 From a passage in Fronto it would appear that priests had to wear their hats within the city (Ad M. Caes. 4, 4, 1: Naber p. 67): at least he reports seeing an inscription on the city gate of Anagnia (Italy) reading flamen sume samentum-a local Hernican word for the pelt of the sacrificial animal which the priest placed on his apex when entering the city. 8 As the provincial priesthood looks to have been modelled in many respects upon the flaminate of Juper (below, p. 478), it can hardly be doubted that imperial high priests were likewise expected to wear their peaked caps out of doors.

Epictetus, for instance, advises that wearing such a crown is not worth the money it will cost (1, 19, 26-29)'3 and the golden crown bearing the image of Caesar is at the centre of the story of Thecla, who com­mitted sacrilege by knocking it from the head of the Syrian Alexander, priest of the imperial cult at Pisidian Antioch (Acts of SS.

Otherwise Tertullian refers to the golden crowns of provincial priests (De id%/. 18, 1) and inscriptions from Dacia and Africa begin to attest the term coronati from the third century. 17 Actual examples of a crown of this type in the West are provided by two statues, now in the Louvre, believed to represent the later emperor Julian (PI. LXXXV c). On Piganiol's interpretation he wore as Caesar in Gaul the crown he had worn at Athens as archiereus agnothetes.18 To these can be added the crown worn by an imperial priest, who is rep­resented as presiding at the games he has given, on an ivory diptychon of ca. A.D. 400, likewise in the Louvre (PI. LXXXVI a, b).19 By far our most informative source on the provincial priesthood is the fragmentary Lex Narbonensis (elL 12, 6038 = ILS 6964; above, Vol. I, 2, PI.

In this he followed the precedent set by the flamen Dialis, who likewise wore the praetexta, a purple-fringed robe that was really the costume appropriate to a magistrate and hence reflects the close association of the priesthood with the magistracy.24 From the Lex Narbonensis it is clear that in subsequent years a past provincial priest was entitled to parade in his robes on the days of public spectacles (II. 15f.): which will have meant in practice a whole block of clergymen wearing the praetexta.

In the East at any rate the purple robes of the high priest are very much in evidence31 and it looks to have been the purple himation in the Greek style that Domitian sported at the Capitoline games (above, p. 478). The discussion would be put on a different footing if the letter after p is in fact an e, as has recently been proposed. The attire of municipal priest likewise followed closely the Roman fashion. Thus a sentence in Pacatus records that, when Theodosius visited the city of Emona, he was met by ... conspicuous veste nivea senatores, reverendos municipali purpura flamines, insignes apicibus sacerdotes (Paneg. Lat. 2[12]: 37, 4). With this one may compare a comment of Minucius Felix: templa ut busta despiciunt, deos despuunt, rident sacra, miserentur miseri (si fas est) sacerdotum, honores et purpuras despiciunt, ipsi seminudi (Octav. 8, 4). The wording of Pacatus, particularly the contrast with the white robes of the senators, could imply an all-purple garment rather than just purple-fringed,32 perhaps therefore the laena or trabea. We have no information on the dress of the wife of the municipal flamen or the jlaminica33 but it is reasonable to suppose that, like the wife of the provincial flamen (above), she will have worn white or purple. What we do have is a bust from Nimes showing that her coiffure was enveloped by bandelettes corresponding to those around the hair of the flamen when he took off his apex (Esperandieu, Recueill, no. 478 \" De Idolol. 18, I: igitur purpura ilia et aurum cervicis ornamentum eodem more apud Aegyp­tios et Babylonios insignia erant dignitatis, quo more nunc praetextae, vel trabeae, vel palmatae, et coronae aureae sacerdotum provincialium, sed non eadem condicione.

The name given to this striking hair style was tutu/us, perhaps in origin the term for a sort of bonnet covering the hair. 34 According to Festus, the vitia of the municipal priestess was purple: tutu/um voeari aiunt f/aminiearum eapitis ornamentum, quod fiat villa purpurea innexa erinibus, et extruetum in altitudinem (Lindsay, p. 484, 32). To this evidence can be added the golden crown of Vibia Modesta (above, p. 478) cor­responding to the crowns worn by high priestesses of the imperial cult in the East. JS The counterpart to the vestments of priests and priestesses is the holiday dress of the common people. What form this took in Rome and Italy is fre­quently described by the literary authorities. Thus at supplications, when the whole community participated, the men wore wreaths and carried a laurel branch, the women went with loosened hair.36 Similarly in 42 B.C. a law was passed that Caesar's birthday should be celebrated by everyone, each wearing a laurel wreath and making merry; sanctions were imposed on those who failed to comply (CD 47, 18, 5).37 Suetonius describes the scene in the bay of Puteoli, when passengers aboard a ship from Alexandria paid their respects to Augustus shortly before his death: ... eandidati eoronatique et tura Iibantes ... (Aug. 98, 2);38 while Dio describes the arrival of Tiridates in Rome to make submission to Nero, with the people drawn up in tribes and wearing white clothes and laurels (CD 63, 4, 2). We have a similar picture of festive garb in Herodian's account of how the Italian cities sent out delegations of their prominent citizens, clad in white and wearing laurel wreaths, to meet Pupienus Maximus at Aquileia in 238 (8, 7, 2). Tertullian on several occasions condemns the wearing of garlands, particularly military garlands, as idolatrous39 and it is clear that on the occasions of both private and state festivals doorposts too were decked with laurels.4o Even though no direct testimony has accrued, then, one can hardly doubt that similar attire will have been typical of imperial occasions celebrated in the western provinces.4l 34 Dar.-Sag.

Calendar and Anniversaries We have seen that one clause of the Lex Narbonensis (above, p. 479) enables a former flamen to wear his priestly vestment on the days he had made sacrifice when still in office (1. 16). A second stipulation (11. 19f.), while partly dependent on a restoration, lays down that the replacement for aflamen shall perform rites for the remaining part of the year in the order followed by the annualflamen.42 Both provisions clearly suppose a calendared order of obser­vances.43 The precise occasions are not revealed in the Narbonese charter but the presumed Antonine copy of the inscription of the Ara Numinis Augusti at Narbo (ClL 12, 4333 = lLS 112) preserves regulations prescribing cult acts on certain anniversaries: the Kalends of January, Augustus' first assumption of the fasces (7th January), his reconciliation of the people and decurions of Narbo (31st May), and the two days when his birthday was celebrated (23rd-24th September).44 What this brief list makes clear is that, apart from the occa­sionallocal anniversary, the festivals celebrated in the civic cult of Narbo were based upon those observed in religious practice at Rome. As the discussion will show, the Roman calendar did in fact provide the pattern not only for municipal cult in Italy but also for festivals celebrated in the provincial and municipal cults of the empire as a whole. Even where direct evidence is lack­ing, therefore, it becomes possible to sketch a general picture of the imperial anniversaries that will have been observed both in the eastern and in the western provinces, though the precise selection of festivals will naturally have diff ered to some extent from one locality to another.4s Fortunately, the man­ner in which the ruler cult was observed at Rome can be largely reconstructed from the surviving Acts of the Arval Brethren.46 These cannot have been the \" ...

By comparing occasions of the living emperor with similar anniversaries in the early AFA it can be seen how the accompanying rites had been maintained or modified in the long interval from A.D. 70 down to the reign of Alexander. 86 What stamps the Feriale Duranum as a unique document, however, is the preponderance of festivals relating to the divi and the divae-some 21 out of 41 extant entries.87 As this makes abundantly clear, contemporary state religion must have pre­served the cult of consecrated members of the imperial families far more extensively than was once thought to be the case.88 And whereas dated inscrip­tions reflect only individual festivals or the AFA give occasional notices of a single celebration for all deified personages in common (each receiving an individual victim), the Dura Jeriale provides a composite picture of the place of this large and important class of anniversaries in the state calendar as it had evolved down to the period of Alexander Severus. For the final development of the state ruler cult we have the evidence of two late calendars both preserved in manuscript: the Fasti of Philocalus (written in A.D. 354) and the Fasti of Polemius Silvius (written in A.D. 448/9).89 These confirm that even at this late date some occasions of the living emperor were still observed, in particular the birthday, the dies imperii, and various victories of Constantius II and the natales of Theodosius II and Valentinian 111.90 More surprisingly, the birthdays were kept up of a remarkable number of divi going back to Julius Caesar, Augustus, and other emperors of the first century; even the natatis of Faustina, wife of Antoninus, has an entry in the Jasti Silviani. 84 For evidence in support of this thesis see below, \"Dated inscriptions and the Feriale Duranum\" Appendix I, pp. 593-608. \" For the character of the /e riale see \"Fer.

As is clear, however, from the lex coloniae Genetivae: LXIIII (ClL 2, 5439 = lLS 6087), municipalities could set their own list of festivals and accompanying rites, so that the extent to which these followed or diverged from the Roman calendar will be arbitrary. 91 How the observances of the capital might be followed else­where is graphically illustrated by a calendar from Cumae dated A.D. 4-14 (CIL 10, 8375 =ILS 108 = Degrassi, Inscrlt 13, 2, no. 44). This has usually been connected with the municipal temple of Augustus, though in the absence of evidence for such a building Degrassi suggested it could be the jeriale of some local collegium. 92 At all events the selection of imperial festivals to be celebrated relates to Augustus and his family and marks such events as Augustus' own birthday and those of Divus Iulius, Tiberius, Germanicus, and the Younger Drusus, along with other anniversaries of the living emperor, in particular his assumption of the toga virilis and the jasces, his first con­sulship, his first victory and imperial acclamation,93 his appointment as Pon­tifex Maximus, and the bestowal of the name Augustus. The year itself may now have had its start at Cumae on some imperial occasion.

Thus official directives, preserved on papyri, give detailed prescriptions for the celebration in Egypt of such special occasions as the accessions of Nero, Avidius Cassius or Pertinax.l09 Athens celebrated the accession of Geta, Aphrodisias that of Decius and Herennius, while at Ephesus the beginning of Antoninus Pius' reign was marked by a decree establishing a festival on his birthday.\"° But other imperial celebrations took place on a regular basis, often annually but also every two or four years. III Sometimes the emperor would be joined to a local deity and the two celebrated together; a good exam­ple occurs at Ephesus, where one of the inscriptions relating to the donations of Gaius Vibius Salutaris shows how the imperial cult was grafted on to that of Artemis. 11 2 In other cases the emperor might be honoured alone at Sebasteia, Kaisareia or similar festivals named after a particular emperor. 113 In many instances these coincided with important imperial occasions such as the emperor's birthday, especially that of Augustus, but it is clear that other recurring imperial anniversaries were also celebrated locally in the East on the model of the state-religious practices we have seen to be followed in Italy.

With these local calendars of the imperial cult may be compared the sur­viving financial records from the Arsinoe temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, the only Roman god on whose cult in Egypt we have precise data. 122 The entries are for the year A.D. 215 and cover income and expenditures of the temple for various days throughout the months of January to June. Apart from local Egyptian celebrations such as the N<'LAotLot and the festival of the town god Suchos (Pag. VI, 22f.), the occasions celebrated are predictably Roman with a preponderance of imperial anniversaries. In addition to the Kalends of January (Pag. I, 4) and the nata/is of Roma (Pag. XII, 8), the days observed include the nata/es of Caracalla (Pag. X, 9f) and of his father Septimius Severus (Pag. XI, 8), perhaps also, if WiIcken's restoration can stand, the day when Caracalla was named M. Aurelius Antoninus and elevated to the rank of Caesar (frag. I, 1Of.). Local recognition of Septimius Severus in Egypt may lie behind an entry for 13th February (Pag. IV, 6_8),123 while the entry for 19th February clearly refers to the victory at Lugdunum, A.D. 197 (Pag. IV, 11-13). In addition there are various days honouring Severus or Caracalla;124 and the conferring of the title mater castrorum on Julia Domna is commemorated on 14th April (Pag. XI, 15-17).

As a whole, they constitute an evolving jeriale of imperial festivals-the complement to our two calendars of particular years-and to the extent that they were officially inspired show how the state list in Rome was continually updated from reign to reign. While papyrological evidence is naturally restricted to Egypt,128 both here and elsewhere in the Greek East we have numerous inscriptions that can be seen to reflect the observances of the Roman calendar exactly as in the municipalities of Italy. Thus the whole chronological system of Asia was remodelled in 9 B.C. on the proposal of the proconsular governor, Paullus Fabius Maximus: the year was now to begin on 23rd September, the anniver­sary of Augustus' birthday and \"the beginning of all things\" (OGIS 458).129 Many municipal calendars in the province followed suit. Even more striking is an epigraphical list of anniversaries from Gortyn dated to the reign of Marcus Aurelius (IGRR 1, 1509 = I Crete 4, 333, no. 300).130 With the help of the foundation bequeathed by T.

A notice from a wall of the baths at Lambaesis records that annual gymnasia were provided on the anniversary of the natalis (11 th April) of Septimius Severus (AE pig, 1912, no. 19). Whether these are gymnastic displaysl51 or free distributions of supplies required for gymnastic exercises (oil, for instance),152 it is clear that the gym­nasia add to the enjoyment of festival occasions. With this brief text may be compared a Severan inscription at Tebessa (ILAlg 1, 3041) preserving an extensive calendar of dies gymnasiorum when gymnasia were provided to the general public through the benefaction of 250,000 sesterces which had been willed to the city by C. Cornelius Egrilianus, Prefect of the legio XlIII gemina (ibid. 3040).153 Some sixty-four days appear to have been originally set aside through the year, many of them coinciding with imperial occasions (prin­cipally natales or dies imperii) or other public festivals of the Roman calendar, others perhaps feast days of purely local interest. There is no reference to any cult acts in honour of the emperor but the very existence of this epigraphical feriale, added to the calendars from Egypt and Dura we have reviewed above, strongly supports the thesis that calendars of various kinds and at various levels were in use in the Western provinces just as in the East. 154 One might note in this connection a (?Severan) pictorial calendar of the months found at Thysdrus in Tunisia,155 and it is also relevant that in the Roman period a calendar in the Gallic language, with lunar months of 29 or 30 days, was inscribed on a bronze plate found at Coligny (PI.

It is at any rate certain that imperial anniversaries were well-known and considered appropriate occasions on which to set up an honorific inscrip­tion or dedicate an altar or statue.

Imperial Celebrations The ceremonies by which imperial festivals were observed can likewise be expected to have followed the Roman model-the calendars themselves, which we have assumed to be in the hands of imperial priests in the West, may well have indicated the rites appropriate to a particular occasion.

Gaius' approach to the imperial cult went well beyond the bounds of established Julio-Claudian practice but the fact of sacrifice in the western empire is established by a fragmentary clause of the Lex Narbonensis (CIL 12, 6038 = ILS 6964) referr­ing to sacrifices performed by the provincial high priest (I. 16, cf. 19f.). There is no clue to the form these may have taken at the provincial centre but very exact regulations are laid down in the inscription of the municipal Ara Numinis Augusti at Narbonne (above, p. 482). These prescribe what sacrifices shall be made by the corporation of three equites Romani a plebe and three tibertini, also by the coloni and incolae. On major anniversaries the corporation is to offer victims (23rd September, 31st May) or incense and wine and victims (7th JanuarY),170 each member one animal, but they have also to supply incense and wine to the coloni and incolae for supplications on every anniversary-including 1st January.171 In keeping with the vow made in perpetuity by the inhabitants of Narbo (numini Augusti votum susceptum a plebe Narbonensium in perpetuom (sic): 11. 4-6) these offerings are made each year in renewal of the deorum placatio (qui se numini eius in perpetuum col­endo obtigaverunt: 11.

Thus an altar of the Numen Augusti at Tarraco bears representations of the urceus, patera and lituus, all beautifully executed (AlfOldy, RlT 48; PI. LXXIV b, c).

A glance at this, together with comparable evidence from the East, will therefore provide the appropriate background against which one can fill out such fragmentary evidence from the West as happens to have been preserved.

This can hardly be the temple (then under construction) of Divus Augustus, which is represented as gabled and hexastyle on the type of Gaius sacrificing (above, note 59), and on the restored series of Antoninus Pius as gabled and octostyle upon a podium of four steps (BMC 4, p. 350, no. 2051; cf. p. Ixxiii); but it may well be the temple of Vesta as originally proposed by H. Dressel, \"Numismatische Analekten (I)\", Zeitschr. fur Numis. 22 (1900), 20-31. Subse­Quent research seems to have concluded that, if so, this must be the shrine of Vesta in foro rather than a supposed aedicula on the Palatine. for a review of the discussion see above, Vol. I, 88, note 37; R. T. Scott, Historia 31 (1982), 458f. As there is further iconographical evidence, in par­ticular reliefs from Sorrento and Palermo, for the association of the ram and the bull with the temple of Vesta, it seems very possible that Prudent ius has misunderstood their significance and mistakenly introduced them into the cult of Divus Augustus, which was so closely associated with that of Vesta. Alternatively he may simply be repeating a popular misconception, itself inspired by the coin. On the persuasive interpretation of M. Guarducci the ram and the bull flanking the temple are in fact signs of the Zodiac relating to the periods 21st March-20th April (Aries) and 20th April-19th May (Taurus): \"Enea e Vesta\", MDAI(R) 78 (1971), 73-118 at 103ff. for the link between the cults of Vesta and of Divus Augustus see M.

II, I. 18), also (surprisingly at this date) the anniversary of Germanicus' birthday (Col. II, I. 12); who was the recipient of the supplication on such days is generally not stated.208 Such use of the sup­plicatio to mark an anniversary will have long since become a standing prac­tice.209 In the surviving Jasti of the early principate similar occasions are celebrated by animal sacrifices but, though the evidence is very limited or inferential, supplications must have been common by the time of Claudius, who in fact reduced their number (CD 60, 17, I; cf. Tac., Ann. 13, 41, 5).2 1 0 We have noted the preponderance of supplications among the cult acts pre­scribed in the inscription of the Ara Numinis Augusti at Narbo (above, p. 502). As in military practice or in municipal cult, this form of celebration no doubt gained popularity because of its cheapness and may have been the standard observance elsewhere on many occasions that were marked at Rome by animal sacrifice. Further evidence for the rites of the ruler cult in Rome occurs in the form of reliefs illustrating various religious ceremonies; fortunately for present pur­poses imperial ritual was a popular theme of early imperial art. 2 11 Thus a bull and a steer, possibly offerings to the Genius Augusti and Divus Augustus, appear in the Cancelleria relief showing a procession associated with some lulio-Claudian ritual event, conceivably the founding of the altar of Pro­videntia or of Pietas. 2 1 2 Sacrifice to Divus Augustus alone may be represented on a coin type of A.D. 37-38, perhaps adapted from a monumental relief,213 while the scene on a relief in the Vatican has been thought to show a similar rite to Divus Claudius;2 14 both portray a supplication, preliminary to the offering of a victim, along with assistant religious personnel. The altars from the vici, on the other hand, clearly depict sacrifice to the Lares and the Genius Augusti.

This freedom of movement further emerges in the way communities celebrated imperial festivals. Whereas animal sacrifices are a mark of the cult paid by the Arvals,218 the jeriale of Cumae (ibid.) shows that local practice was to celebrate the natales of imperial princes and most other occasions with the cheaper rite of a supplication to Vesta, Jupiter, Mars, or some abstrac­tion.

Much the same conclusions follow from the observances at Forum Clodii in A.D. 18 when Augustus was already four years dead (elL 11, 3303 =lLS 154); two victims are to be offered at the altar of the Numen Augustum on the days of Augustus' birthday festival, while on Tiberius' natatis the sacrifice of a calf is prescribed.222 The recipient is not stated but presumably will have been the Numen Augustum, to which the altar is dedicated. In addition on both occasions, before the decurions go to their meal, the genii of Augustus and Tiberius are to be invited thure ac vino to dine at the altar; that is, the ritual on the birthday of each emperor included a supplication to both their genii. This last rite must be a purely local arrangement,22J for neither in the Feriale Cumanum nor at Narbo is there any mention of the cult of the genius and only under Nero do the Arvals sacrifice to the emperor's genius along with other gods (above, p. 506). That festivals celebrated by local colleges were likewise marked by supplications is confirmed occasionally by their own regulations, for example those of the collegium cultorum Dianae et Antinoi at Lanuvium: item placuit ut quinquenna/is sui cuiusque temporis diebus solemn[ibus ture] let vino suppticet (elL 14, 2112 = ILS 7212: II, II. 29f.). On the other hand a well-known inscription attests direct sacrifice to Augustus himself at Naples following the procession of competitors and officials to the imperial sanctuary on the day of the games (I Olympia 56, II. 48_52).224 The rite is clearly in line with the prescription of the Feriale Cumanum on Augustus' natalis but in this case we have Dio's explicit comment that the Neapolitans were emulating Greek customs.22' Imperial rites are also well attested in the surving iconography.

As the Lares appear on the two shorter sides of the altar, there can be little doubt that the recipient of the sacrifice is the Genius Augusti. One may compare an altar with a similar scene at Soriano del Cimino.221 The Lares Augusti themselves are the focus of the rite por­trayed on a relief from Aquileia showing three veiled priests standing at a small square, lighted altar (PI. XCI b). 228 In the left hand the two outer figures carry a long branch of laurel (?), presumably for purification purposes, and in the right an offering bowl; the middle figure sprinkles on the altar grains of incense which he has taken from the acerra in his raised left hand. The association of the rite with the Lares is assured by the inclusion of a pig pro­truding from behind the feet of the left-hand figure; while to the left in front of the altar sits a cock.229 The scene is striking parallel to that on the reliefs at Ptuj and Nimes (above, p. 503f.), where, however, the victims are omitted, and compares closely with the scenes of sacrifice by four vicomagistri that are portrayed on exterior walls at the compita of Pompeii.230 Some ceremony of the municipal cult of the emperor may be shown on the altar before the temple of Vespasian at Pompeii. 23 I This preserves an elaborately executed representation of the sacrifice of a bull, showing the preliminary libation by the priest, the lictors, victimarii, attendants and flute­player; on the shorter sides appear priestly attributes and the paraphernalia of sacrifice. The rite might be associated with the dedication of the temple (though the suggestion of a temple of the Genius Augusti can draw on little supporting evidence) or mark an annual celebration of some sort in the municipal cult. If the relief is Flavian rather than earlier, possible recipients of the offering would be the Genius Augusti or Mars.2J2 Again, at Vercelli a second-century relief, perhaps from an altar of the well-attested municipal cult, shows a similar sacrificial scene, but in this case the priest wears his apex on top of the short toga (?Iaena) veiling his head as he performs the '\" Scott Ryberg.

On the other hand several details link the rite with Greek rather than Roman practice: in particular the head of the priest is not veiled but bare and laureate. Such iconographical traces provide tan­talising glimpses of municipal cult in the Western provinces and hence, inferentially, of local civic cult in the Western provinces. 238 (c) East Evidence from the Greek East is less relevant in so far as it generally reflects long-established Greek ritual practice rather than Roman, though often enough the two will have broadly corresponded.239 The rites appropriate to the ruler cult in the Eastern empire had a long history running from the early civic cults of the Greek city-state or the dynastic cults of Hellenistic monar­chies down to the cults of Roman administrators and similar cults of Roman power under the Republic.240 Price has stressed the central importance of '\" Scott Ryberg 93f.

At a very early stage Greek observances may even have pro­vided the model at one or two centres in the West, though as a rule we have no idea how far these were imitated; Naples provides the obvious exception (above, p. 510). Conversely, and more importantly, there are clear instances in the East of Roman rites that have been imported and adopted locally and are consequently of particular relevance to the overall picture of imperial ritual in the Latin West. 243 We have seen that at Brundisium, Tarraco and Massilia a Greek paradigm for imperial ritual was on public view in the form of a copy of the decree of the Mytileneans (IGRR 4, 39).244 This calls for animal sacrifices to be made to the emperor on his monthly birthday just as to Zeus (I. 21: a), except that, if Price is right, the victims offered the emperor had special markings. The Mytilene example thus parallels the observance in the Feriale Cumanum, not that there is anything to prove the regulation at Cumae was copied directly from Greek practice. On the whole, however, the evidence Price has assembled seems to suggest that direct sacrifice to the emperor alone was avoided at the provincial level-at least it is not recorded245-and was relatively uncommon in civic cult; though the data might be increased by inference from imperial altars, certainly by the inclusion of sacrifices to the 26f.

The rite is conducted here by a Roman official, but during the imperial festival at Gytheum in the Peloponnese the ephors similarly sacrificed a bull at the imperial shrine \"on behalf of the safety of the rulers and the gods and the eternal duration of their rule\". Whether it was for the same intention that a second sacrifice was performed in the main square is not stated, but incense was then offered before the images of Augustus, Livia and Tiberius at the theatre, again for the preservation of the rulers (SEG 11, 1954, no. 923).248 Similar examples can be adduced elsewhere.2 49 But the most striking evidence for the importation of Roman forms into the Greek World relates to the annual vota of 3rd January.2S0 Fragmentary inscriptions from Cyrene and Ptolema'is show that the ceremonies performed here were an exact copy of those we know from the Acts of the Arvals with prayer formulae spoken and then recorded in Latin.2SI Nothing could show more clearly how the Roman model might be applied elsewhere, even in a Greek-speaking context; a fo rtiori then in the Latin West.

(d) West Observances The ceremonies by which imperial festivals were observed in the Latin prov­inces must also have followed the Roman model, with specific rites performed on particular anniversaries by provinces and municipalities. The inference imposes itself by comparison with the picture at centres in Italy, also to some extent in the Greek East, and is directly confirmed at Narbo, occasionally else­where, if in very fragmentary fashion. Expense will undoubtedly have been a major concern and one would expect the sacrifice of a victim to have been limited to a few major feast days, with other anniversaries observed by the cheaper rite of the supplication. 2 54 The living emperor's birthday in particular must have been a greater festival than that of some long-deceased divus or diva. On certain days the ritual can be inferred without difficulty. Thus 3rd January was the occasion for empire-wide celebrations pro salute imperatoris. We have seen that the AFA preserve records of the observance followed at Rome in the first and second century and that inscriptions show how exactly the same ritual was in use at centres in Cyrenaica (above, p. 514). Pliny like­wise confirms that the provincials joined in making and paying vows for the emperor on the same day (Epp. 10: 35f.; 100f.).2SS It can hardly be doubted, then, that parallel rites will have marked the ceremonies of 3rd January in the Latin West. Presumably special occasions such as the accession of a new emperor or the adventus of Hadrian or Septimius Severus will also have been celebrated. Such was certainly the case in the East, 2 56 where several directives of Roman administrators are preserved, even prescribing the specific rites to be followed. 2 57 Then there are the days that were observed by the Arvals for a particular reason such as imperial recovery from illness or the detection of '\" Above, note 171, at 107f., cf. 87.

Events of this nature occasionally find an echo in the inscriptions of the Latin provinces (cf. elL 13, 4635), so it is possi­ble that they were celebrated at one period or another in provincial or municipal cult, whether by sacrifices or supplications to the gods. The living emperor's natatis was one of the major celebrations of the year and had been made a public festival in 30 B.C. (CD 51, 19, 2).2 58 We have seen that the day was marked by the Arvals with animal sacrifice to various gods, to whom were later added the emperor's genius and assorted abstrac­tions (above, p. 505f.). At Cumae, and occasionally at centres in the East, the birthday of Augustus was celebrated with an offering directly to the emperor. On the other hand at Narbo the two-day festival was celebrated with offerings to the Numen Augusti, on which the cult centred: victims the first day and incense and wine on both (above, p. 482, 502; PI. LXXV a). Similarly at Forum Clodii it must be the Numen Augustum to which animal sacrifices are offered on the natatis of the deceased Augustus and the living emperor Tiberius; we have noted the additional rite of a supplication at the altar to the genii of both emperors on the same occasions (above, p. 510). No further direct evidence exists but it seems reasonable to infer that similar sacrifice of a hostia, no doubt with a preliminary supplication of incense and wine, will have marked the reigning emperor's birthday generally in the West, both at provincial and at municipal centres. Who received the offering must remain an open question for lack of evidence. Analogy would seem to suggest that sacrifice will have been made to the emperor with Roma or even to the emperor alone,259 depending on what form a cult happened to take; certainly at Pergamum the regulations of the choristers speak of \"the sacrifices of Augustus and Roma\" (IORR 4, 353d, I. 14). On the other hand both the reci­pient and the category of sacrifices tend to vary in the joint cults of a god and the emperor in the East. 260 At all events nothing goes to show that the offering will have been to the emperor's genius exclusively as has sometimes been claimed.261 The cult of the genius is in fact sparsely attested in the Western provinces even though the genius is a co-recipient on this day in the AFA of the time of Nero and onwards, as indeed it is much later in the Feriale Duranum (above, p. 506f.).

Similar occasions must have been celebrated elsewhere in the West, though hardly by the sacrifice of an ox to Jupiter and the gods as in the practice of the Arvals. Other anniversaries of the living emperor-his dies imperii, tribunicia potestas, assumption of the fasces or toga virilis, and so on-will no doubt have been marked either by the offering of a victim with a supplication as at Narbo (above, pp. 482, 502) or more probably by a simple supplication as at Cumae or in the Feriale Duranum (above, pp. 507f.).262 Similarly the victory celebrations of 4th(?) September263 and 15th April are marked at Cumae by supplications, in the latter case to Victoria Augusta. No doubt the nature and quality of the sacrifice will have been graded according to local estimation of the importance of the festival. The recipient on such occasions is not usually stated in the Feriale Duranum but at the Narbo altar the offering is clearly to the Numen Augusti on 7th January. At Cumae the supplication prescribed on imperial occasions is usually to a god or deified abstraction/s but it was to the emperor himself on the day Octavian was named Augustus (16th January). It seems not impossible, therefore, that in, say, a cult of Roma and Augustus the offering will have been made to both at least on some occasions of the reigning emperor, perhaps also to various deities or abstractions. If that was not the case, one would suppose an offering to the gods on behalf of the emperor. When a cult included the divi as in the provincial worship at Tarraco ab initio or at Lugdunum from the time of Hadrian, they may also have been co-recipients on such days; at least this is true of the rites of the Arvals, who sacrified additionally to the emperor's genius (above, p. 507). Deified members of the imperial house may have been honoured in their own right on their birthdays just as were Augustus and Livia at Forum Clodii or a whole litany of divi and divae in the Feriale Duranum. Once again the cheaper rite of a supp/icatio is to be expected rather than the sacrifice of an ox, except perhaps in the case of Divus Augustus himself in the years immediately following his death; the rite at Forum Clodii is a case in point. As for other occasions of the Roman calendar, it can hardly be doubted that these too will have been celebrated with appropriate rites. At Narbo, for example, 1st January was marked by a distribution of incense and wine to the coloni and incolae for individual offerings, just as on other anniversaries. We have seen that the day is connected with the Lares Augusti and that there is iconographical testimony for supplications to the Lares Augusti at Ptuj and Nlmes; the anniversary was even observed by the choristers of Pergamum '6 2 For the celebration of Trajan's dies imperii (28th January) in Bithynia see Pliny, Epp. 10, 52, mentioning prayers to the gods for the emperor's well-being; cf.

Lastly, local festivals such as the anniversary of the dedica­tion of the Altar of the Three Gauls will surely have figured in the calendars and been the occasion for imperial rites. Thus at Narbo Augustus' reconcilia­tion of the people and the decurions (31st May) was celebrated by offerings to the Numen Augusti: the sacrifice of victims by the corporation and sup­plications by the townsfolk.264 If much of this reconstruction is necessarily conjectural, a rough outline of the rites appropriate to specific dates in the calendar does begin to emerge, one that future epigraphical discoveries may help to correct and fill out. On the other hand with evidence largely inferen­tial, so provisional a model provides no possibility whatsoever of determining to what extent imperial ritual may have reflected the ambiguous status of the emperor, on the lines of Price's analysis in the Greek East. 265 Cult Places The Acts of the Arvals are also instructive in revealing exactly where sacrifices were performed.266 The most common locus is in Capitolio, but specific locations are occasionally mentioned, in particular in pronao Iovis Optimi Maximi, ante eel/am Iunonis Reginae, in aedem (sic) Opis, ante arcum [?Iani gemini]. Other sites include the Palatine and the new temple (of Divus Augustus), but also in fo ro Augusto, in campo ad aram Pacis, ad aram Pro­videntiae Augustae, ad theatrum Marcelli ante simulacrum Divi Augusti, ante aram gentis Iuliae and even in sacra via ante domum Domitianam. As we have seen, sacrifice at the altars of the vici is attested by surviving reliefs (above, pp. 508f.), and the temples of individual divi must similarly have been the location for sacrifices addressed to a particular divus; so too the templum divorum (above, p. 486). Where precisely ceremonies were performed in the Western ruler cult will naturally have been determined by the character of the local worship. The practice of the Arvals gives a broad range of possibilities and with these can be compared the sites of imperial ritual in its Greek idiom, as analysed by Price: sanctuaries, altars, temples, but also special rooms in gymnasia and porticoes.267 At Tarraco, for example, the municipal cult centred on the altar '\" At Forum Clodii (above, p. 490) the anniversary of the dedications of the statues of the Caesars and of Livia (kept on 10th March) was observed by the distribution of honey-wine and sweetmeats to the decurions and the people (cf. below, p. 614), but there is no mention of rites.

XCIV) and Arles.268 An Augustan complex in the Jardin de la Fontaine at Nimes, on the other hand, centred on a platform supporting an altar, presumably of Roma and Augustus, and sur­rounded by an artificial lacus, perhaps with fountains; other amenities, including a portico and a monumental entry hall, evoke on a reduced scale the Caesarea, Augustea or Sebasteia found at Alexandria, Antioch and elsewhere in the east. 269 Similarly, local altars of an Augustan god (PI. XCII a-c) or an Augustan abstraction will have served as the focal point of specializations of the ruler cult. At the provincial level offerings must have been made at Lyon on the great altar within the federal sanctuary, (above, Vol. I, 1, PIs. I, XIff.), whereas in N. W.

Iud. 1, 414; Ant. Iud. 15, 339).280 As this account makes clear, such statues were usually ultra humanum modum and often fashioned of precious metal so as to accentuate their religious character and impress the awestruck worship­per. 281 In some instances, too, it is clear that an imperial temple could have a divided cella with a cult statue in each part; such is the case with the temple of Roma and Augustus at Lepcis Magna (Pis.

In any event cult idols are to be distinguished from the honorific statues of the emperor and his family (cf.

Similar arrangements can be paralleled at temples in the East. 285 Whether imperial rites were ever performed at local Capitolia in the West we have no idea, though certainly that at Narbo looks to have been adjacent to the municipal imperial temple.286 In any event the practice at Rome itself makes it clear that, as well as at altars and temples, cult could be paid to the emperor in other locations: the Forum Augustum, the Campus Martius, the Theatre of Marcellus (above, p. 518). Similarly in the East, Price has shown that all the major centres of a city could be the scene of imperial ritual: the central square, the council house, the theatre, even stadia and gymnasia.287 So Tacitus remarks of Sejanus colique per theatra et fora effi gies eius interque principia legionum sineret (Ann. 4, 2, 4; cf.

Similar cult places linked with the scaenae frons, summa cavea or porticus post scaenam have been identified at other theatres (Volterra, Herculaneum, Lep­cis Magna) and must have been the focal point of rites on imperial occasions. More strikingly, a theatre is frequently linked physically with a temple, which can be situated either at the back of the scene, as is the temple of the Oi Augusti at Lepcis Magna, or at a short distance from it: at Aventicum, for instance, the orientation and dimensions of the imperial sanctuary and the facade of the theatre correspond exactly (PI. XCVIII a).292 This combination or association of theatre and temple raises the possibility of processions link­ing the two, a point that applies equally to amphitheatres associated with cen­tres of the imperial cult (below, pp. 556f.).

Interestingly, both these monuments show the augur's Iituus, which was used in marking the original boundaries of the temenos of a temple. 306 Whether this might echo a connection with a local temple of the imperial cult is impossible to say. Presumably the laurel branches held by the figures in the Ptuj relief were used for sprinkling the altar, offering and officiants with water (/ustratio) before making sacrifice; this preliminary purification is further attested by the aspergil/um of the provincial priest on the temple frieze at Tar­raco, also in reliefs at Nimes and Narbonne (above, p. 504). The Lex Narbonnensis twice mentions sacrifices (above, p. 502) and victims are prescribed for the celebration of major festivals at the municipal altar at Narbo. The cast of personnel is familiar enough from reliefs at Rome and elsewhere in ltaly:307 the priest capite velato, attendant camilli, victimarii and popa, clad only in fringed apron down to the calves, the flute player (tibicen), whose music appeased the gods and drowned out other sounds, the victim itself to be despatched with axe, mallet or knife (above, pp. 508f., 511 f.). All of these appear on one or other of the reliefs fr om Nescania, Emerita, Tarraco, Rusicade and Carthage (Pis. LXXXIX-XC), and it is possible that the Tar­raco bell is also to be brought into connection with the complex ritual (PI. XCIII). For the actual immolation of the victim there is testimony in the form of bucrania on the municipal altar and the temple frieze at Tarraco (above, Vol. I, 1, Pis. XXXI, XXXVII b), also in the headless bull and ram on the altar of Augustus Mars Britovius at Nimes (PI.

Roman ritual did, of course, require exact conformity to detailed prescriptions since mistakes and aberrations constituted a piaculum. 309 So if the ritus Romanus was used in the ruler cult of the Latin West, it will necessarily have conformed to practice in Rome. This must be particularly true of the prayer uttered just before slaying of the victim. 31 0 That the imperial priest and other participants would have partaken of the sacrificial meats seems extremely likely. 311 To consume the victim was standard practice in the ritus Romanus and appears as such in the Martyrdom of Sts. Agape, Irene and Chione (3, cf. 5).31 2 There is also the possibility that the cult image will have been adored. No direct testimony has accrued from the Western cult but Prudentius asserts that worshippers prostrated them­selves before the pulvinar of Divus Augustus at Rome (Contra Symm. Drat. I, 248). We know, too, from Josephus that the Jews refused to allow foreigners to offer sacrifice on behalf of the emperor and prostrate them­selves-presumably before his agalma (Bell. Iud. 2, 414; cf. 409), also from Pliny that recanting Christians were required to adore the emperor's imago; that is, his representation as a man (below, p. 533). Proskynesis before the images of the gods is at all events a frequent theme in Christian martyr­doms. 313 Thus Polycarp was accused of teaching the multitude not to sacrifice or do reverence(1tpOaXuvErv),314 while Apollonius was urged to worship (ai�ELY) and venerate (1tpOaXuVErV) the gods that all men worship and venerate.31S Similarly in the anti-Christian movement at Alexandria in 249 A.D. Quintia was led to the temple of the idol and forced to do reverence (Eusebius, Hist. J08 Hano (above, note 215) 2365-7. J09 Dar.-Sag. 4, 2 (1911) (1963) 978f. )0.

Even when prostration was not involved, it seems certain that at least bowing of the head was required on occasion-in particular in the rite of supplicatio. 31 6 Two texts in the Martyrdom of St. Crispina are explicit on the point: ... subiuga caput tuum ad sacra deorum Romanorum (1, 4); cf. ... ut in templis sacris flexo capite diis Romanorum tura immoles (2, 1).317 To suppose that such acts of reverence were taken over from the cult of the gods and incorporated within the cult of the emperor would therefore appear not unreasonable.31 8 (ii) Participation The extent to which there was more general participation in the celebrations of the imperial cult is less certain; entertainment is better documented (below, pp. 579f.). At the provincial level the performance of rites was essentially the responsibility of the high priest with his assistants,319 just as at Rome it was the concern of priests and magistrates. One might compare military ritual in which cult acts were carried out by a tribune, centurion or other officer on behalf of the men.320 But there is good evidence for the occasional interven­tion of the provincial governor. At Emerita, for example, the governor of Lusitania joined with the provincialflamen in dedicating what must be a gold bust of Titus,32 1 while the much-restored text of the Lex Narbonensis seems to require the permission of the provincial governor before a retiring priest can use the surplus from funds destined for rites, for the purpose of placing statues or busts of the emperor within the provincial temple (elL 12, 6038 = ILS 6964: 11.26-28).322 In the same way P. Cornelius Scipio celebrated the Caesarea at Messene (above, p. 514) and Pliny presided at the vow-taking of 3rd January or observed Trajan's dies imperii (Epp . 52f., 102f.). Many people must have been present simply as onlookers. Just as members of the priestly colleges at Rome watched the ritual performed by a few of their number, so presumably representatives of the provincial council will have attended such rites as took place during the annual meeting of the assembly. As for the local population, all ceremonies performed by the high priest and his assistants '16 See in general Wissowa in RE 2, 7 (1931) 942-945 s.v. supplicatio.

Municipal cult presents a similar picture, with the rites themselves the responsibility of the priest and his associates together with the local magistrates324 and attendants, but the possibility cannot entirely be excluded that provincial governors also may occasionally have joined in municipal rites. In the East at any rate we have a letter of the proconsul of Asia offering to come to Aphrodisias and sacrifice to the ancestral goddess of the city on behalf of the emperor and his mother. 32S That the different sections of the municipal populace will have been represented whenever or wherever the town paid cult to the emperor seems inherently very probable, though we have no idea of the numbers in attendance. P. Veyne has argued that iconographical confirmation is in fact provided by the allegorical figures of two togati, an older man (in some cases represented as the celebrant), and an adolescens, that are shown on the reliefs at Nescania, Emerita (PIs.

Similar figures appear elsewhere: on the passage of the Beneventum arch assisting at a ceremony marking the emperor's projectio: on a panel from the quadrifrons arch at Lepcis Magna, where Septimius Severus and Julia Domna join with the troops in sacrificing to the Capitoline gods, the empress in the role of priestess; again on a relief from the theatre at Sabratha representing a scene of joint sacrifice with the troops. On Veyne's interpretation the figures are those of Ordo and Populus, who together epitomize the crowd of bystanders formed of members of the town coucil and onlookers from the local population who were nor­mally present on such occasions. 326 As for participation by the individual, Tertullian makes it clear that in prin­ciple everyone was expected to take part but all that was required was to wear festive attire, notably crowns, and to hang the door of one's home with laurels and lamps.321 In the same way Roman citizens had been compelled to wear laurel wreaths and make merry at the celebration of the natalis of Divus Iulius 123 Hopkins, Conquerors (above, note 45) 206. 324 Scott Ryberg, Rites 93, interprets two togati to the left of the priest on the Vercelli relief (above, p. 511) as the municipal duumviri.

It is not clear that there was any obligation to join in feasting (see below, pp. 584ff.), nor was there any compulsion to attend provincial or municipal sacrifices, magnetic though such spectacles may have been.328 Above all, formal participation did not, as a rule, impose any obligation to perform rites; individuals were free to pay cult or not as they chose. In prac­tice it seems clear that everyone did join in, even the elite, to some of whom the emperor cult might appear laughable or offensive.329 We hear of no sec­tion of the populace that refused to participate except the Christians and Ter­tullian maintains that these too celebrated imperial festivals, though conscien­tia potius quam lascivia (Apol. 35).330 On certain occasions, however, there is clear evidence that the ordinary man in the street did perform rites. Sometimes this was as a result of specific instructions from the provincial governor. In Egypt, for example, a proclama­tion of A.D. 54 invites the people of Oxyrhynchus to wear wreaths and sacrifice oxen in gratitude to all the gods for the accession of the new emperor Nero; and an edict of A.D. 193 orders the men of Alexandria to sacrifice 1totV­OTjILe.( and pray for Pertinax and his whole house: wreaths are to be worn for fifteen days beginning at once.331 What is striking is that on such occasions special distributions were often made of wine and incense in order to allow people to perform rites on an individual basis, a custom which implies that such rites would not otherwise have been performed; presumably most people were either unwilling or unable to pay out of their own pockets.332 Thus at Rome we hear of donatives to the people on the occasion of supplications of the old kind (Livy 10, 23, if.),333 likewise of the distribution of suffimenta in 1 28 P.

In a letter to the town of Ephesus the proconsul of Asia, L. Venuleius Apronianus, approves the town's decision to observe the birthday of Antoninus Pius by holding shows for five days and distributing a donative of one denarius to each citizen for daily sacrifice (OGIS 493: A.D. 138). A similar instance of widespread distributions in vary­ing amounts is attested at Lagina in Caria.336 But there seems to be no evidence in the West of the special libation bowls that were apparently used for such purposes in Asia Minor (above, p. 514), nor is there any trace in the Latin provinces of the individual small altars on which householders offered sacrifices as a procession passed. 337 Sacrifice by individuals was thus a characteristic of special occasions and depended largely upon support by local authorities. But this by no means excludes the possibility of individuals participating of their own accord, out of personal zeal or fervour. Martial speaks of voluntary acts of piety on festival days-he hopes that Silius may often observe the festivals of Mercury and Diana as he already does that of Vergil's birthday (Epig. 12,67)-and similar acts may well have occurred in the ruler cult. The difficulty is that what little evidence we have is of very uncertain value. Vergil's description of the monthly sacrifice of a lamb in Eclogues I, 7f, 43f., bristles with problems338 and in any case belongs to the period before a calendar of imperial anniversaries had become established. But if Tityrus is after all Vergil and the benefactor he calls a god is Octavian, the text is of interest in attesting the notion of monthly sacrifice-apparently directly to Octavian along with the domestic Lares-of an uncommon, more expensive victim, one that the Arvals, for example, offer to Dea Dia as a culminating rite.339 The lines might 'l4 F.

Then there is Suetonius' description of the spontaneous gesture to Augustus in his last days by the passengers on board a ship en route from Alexandria; candidati coronatique et tura Iibantes (Aug. 98, 2). The episode coincides with what we know of Roman cult practice, though the words of acclamation addressed to the emperor-per ilium se vivere, per ilium navigare, libertate atque Jortunis per ilium Jrui (ibid.)-may well have been spoken in Greek and drawn from the liturgy of the imperial cult at Alexan­dria.340 More relevant is Ovid's description of the rites he performed before the silver likenesses-probably statuettes-of Augustus, Tiberius and Livia that had been sent to him by Cotta Maximus (Ex Ponto 2, 8, 1-10; cf. 4, 9, 107f.).341 Each day at dawn he offers incense and words of prayer: 342 His ego do totiens cum lure precantia verba Eoo quoliens surgil ab orbe dies.

Other evidence attests the private cult of li kenesses of Saturninus, Servilius Ahala, and even of Cassius and Brutus.353 On the proclamation of Elagabalus members of the senate offered incense and wine in the senate house before an enormous picture (?tondo) of the new emperor portrayed as a priest making sacrifice to the Emesene god (Herodian 5, 5, 6f.), and later examples show that the usage continued down to Constantine and beyond.354 Whether such supplications will have been regularly accompanied by prostration or the pro­found bow before the imperial imago must remain an open question, though comparative evidence certainly points in that direction.355 In the collision between Christian and State veneration is frequently linked with sacrifice as a decisive proof of loyalty to the state.356 Thus Pliny writes [Hll quoque omnes et imaginem tuam deorumque simulacra venerati sunt ... (Epp . 10, 96, 6), while Pionius states in his speech of defence: \"And so for this reason we do not worship your so-called gods, nor will we prostrate ourselves before the golden idol\" (Acta Pionii 4, 24). The reference is clearly to the emperor's imago, though the phrase naturally recalls the story of the three young men and the statue of Nebuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel, an incident popular in Christian art. 357 The soldier Dasius was even ordered to venerate the feet of the emperor-that is the feet of the imperial statue (Acta Dasii 7)3S8-and Origen affirms that Christians were also required to kiss the hand, a typical gesture in venerating a statue (Exhort. ad mart. 33).359 Here one can see a cor­respondence with the older form of supplication in which the worshipper pro­strated himself, clutched the knees of the cult image, and kissed the hands and feet. 360 Part at any rate of this ceremonial was evidently absorbed into military practice: Vegetius states explicitly prima cohors ... imagines imperatorum ... venerantur (2, 6; cf.

How far such a cult may have penetrated the Western provinces is impossible to judge with available evidence so slight. The imperial imago itself is represented by a chance survival from Neuilly-le-Real in the territory of the Bituriges Cubi. 3 62 Two small bronze busts of inferior workmanship but dating from the lifetime of Augustus, to judge from their accompanying inscription, bear features that purport to be those of Augustus and Livia (PI. XCIX). The bases are inscribed respectively Caesari Augusto I AtespatusCrixi jil. v.s./.m.; Liviae Augustae I AtespatusCrixijil. v.s./.m. (ClL 13, 1366).363 The mediocre workmanship, combined with the name Atespatus, son of Crixus, points to an owner of modest means. What was the original context of these pieces we have no idea but it is striking that two bronze busts, identified as portraits of the young Octavian and his wife Livia, were found deposited in a native sanctuary at the Iberian town of Azaila.36' A much superior example365 is the well-known gold bust from Avt:nches, which must originally have been mounted on some sort of foot (PI.

Here the dative case led Hirschfeld to conclude that Atespatus had made his vow to Augustus and Livia ut deis: \"Quod Augusto eiusque uxori deorum more votum solvitur, in Gallis, ubi iam a 742 ara Romae et Augusti condita est, offensionem non habet\". Rather than impute effective divinity to the emperor and his wife it seems preferable to understand datives of honour that served in practice to identify the busts; cf. ClL 2, 5264 (= IL S 261); CIL 6, 3756 (= ILS 5160). Atespatus then records that he has paid his vow without, however, naming the god to whom the vow was due-a superfluous detail, if in fact the busts were originally placed in a temple. For similar instances recording the fulfilment of a vow, yet omitting mention of the deity, see CIL 13, 588, 920, 959, 1421. On the fulfillment of a vow by dedicating an object see Wissowa, RuKR' 385. Certainly nothing in the dedication formula or the way that Augustus and Livia are portrayed suggests that Atespatus thought of them as gods who had responded to prayer.

The emperor is shown in military dress wearing a breast plate in the centre of which is a Medusa head, a type in line with one of the commonest ways of representing the emperor. J67 One may compare a very similar, silver-plate bust from Marengo, Turin, showing Lucius Verus likewise in military dress (PI. C b). 368 The precious metal of which these pieces are fashioned is often stressed in inscriptions, which give precise figures of the weight, 3 69 and would seem to confirm their cultic use (below, pp. 543f.). What is critical, of course, is the original context but in neither case does the find­spot give any firm indication of the place where either of these might have stood. The Aventicum bust was rescued from a drain crossing the court of the sanctuary of Cigognier (PI. CI), but whether the piece stood in the cella of the temple (perhaps the likelier possibility: below, p. 547) or, say, in a cult room in the portico must remain an open question. A clearer picture emerges from the occasional epigraphical record. Near Sitifis in Mauretania, for example, P. Cere (sic) Saturninus funded and dedicated an altar and imagines, evidently of M. Aurelius and L. Verus since the accompanying inscription is on behalf of their salus (elL 8, 8409). There is no indication of where the imagines were kept but in other instances inscrip­tions attest the construction of a shrine in which imperial images are to be placed. Thus, at Msaken in Tunisia, Namgiddo, son of Camillus, made and dedicated an aedes Augustorum and a silver imago in celebration of his perpetual flaminate; presumably the imago was of Trajan, who is the subject of the dedication formula with which the text begins (AEpig, 1938, no. 43). This seems to be the only example of its kind in the West but a number of inscriptions from Rome and Italy likewise record the construction of a special shrine intended to house the imperial image or images. For example, three soldiers of the Twelfth Urban Cohort made at their own expense imagines of Bildnis (above, note 10) 78; E.

Similarly the inscription attesting the altar of the Numen Augustum at Forum Clodii (above, p. 510, cf. 516f.) also mentions an aedicula with likenesses (here statuae) of the Caesars (Augustus and Tiberius) and Livia (CIL 11, 3303 = ILS 154), while near the Fucine Lake the imperial freedman and procurator Onesimus looks to have made an aedicula and imagines of the emperor and the Lares, which he then donated to the college of cultores Dei Fucini (CIL 9, 3887 = IL S 3626). Again, a partially preserved inscription at Bovillae associates imagines aureas, evidently of the emperor, with an aedicula (CIL 14, 2416).370 Whether other epigraphical traces should be grouped with these examples rather than with votive offerings in a temple is impossible to tell from the content of the text. 371 We have rather more information on another dimension of the cult. An honorific dedication to Hadrian from Tipasa, Numidia, attests a group of cultores Larum et imaginum Aug. who stress that they are Roman citizens (CIL 8, 17143 = ILS 6778; A.D. 128), while at Poetovio in Pannonia the inscription of a decurion of the colony records that he has provided a place of assembly for the collegium magnum Larum et imaginum domini n.

The purpose of the assembly place is defined as ad sollemnes dies conjrequentandos, so it can be reasonably inferred that cult was to be paid to the Lares and imperial imagines on the festival days of the official calendar. Confirmation is provided by four earlier inscriptions of this same corpus traiectus Rusticeli, all from the same complex of the praedia Rusticeliana (CIL 14, 4553-56).377 These record the gift and dedication of likenesses of members of the imperial house, including the later emperor Lucius Verus, perhaps also Commodus, while the significance of dies solemnes in the Severan inscription is brought out by the dates on which the imagines were dedicated; at least two of these are certainly imperial festivals: the birthdays of Lucius Verus (15th December) and of Antoninus Pius (19th September). From the information provided by the text of C.4554-56 it would appear that the imperial image took the form of a kneeling Atlas holding above his head an imago clipeata showing a representation of the emperor. An imago of Marcus Aurelius, dedicated in the lifetime of Antoninus Pius, is attested by a further inscription (CIL 14, 5328).378 While there is no direct evidence, the likelihood is that, in line with normal practice elsewhere, the cult paid to these likenesses took the form of offerings of incense and wine and it is also possible that the imagines will have been carried in procession (see below, p. 556). To fill the picture out we have the evidence of numerous inscriptions that imperial busts were also in the hands of colleges whose primary concern was not directly with the cult of the emperor. 379 Thus Tiberius Claudius Secundus, the coactor, along with his son and namesake contributed the funds for a club house cum statuis et imaginibus ornamentisque omnibus for the viatores of the tresviri capitales and quattuorviri viarum curandarum (CIL 6, 1936 = ILS 1929).

Though it does not directly concern an imperial likeness, a further inscription seems to reflect the cult of the imago at Nemausus, where someone requests permission from a collegium to set up an imago of a worthy local townsman sub specie nobilissimi principis (CIL 12, 3312). Unless we are explicitly told so, there is nothing to show whether other colleges in the Latin West might have possessed imperial imagines but it is dif­ficult not to believe that such were in the hands of the cultores domus Aug. at Volubilis (lAM 2, 377: A.D. 158; cf. lA M 2, 490: cultor August.) perhaps also the collegium Divi Augusti at Lucus Augusti (CIL 2, 2573). One might compare the imagines of the imperial family that were placed in military scholae in the main camp at Lambaesis, evidently the centre of a particular devotion to the domus divina. 386 In any event the collegial cult of imperial imagines belongs in a separate category from the ritual associated with imperial statues or imagines that have been deposited by groups or individuals within a temple or a specially built aedicula.

Actual examples of statues in imperial temples are preserved in the likenesses of members of the family of Tiberius that stood in the temple of Roma and Augustus at Lepcis Magna (above, p. 52lf.). A rather different situation is reflected in texts attestiQ.g the placing of an imperial likeness in the temple of some Greco-Roman or other deity. For example, three votive altars, similarly inscribed at Lugdunum, record that M. Herennius Albanus set up an imago of Tiberius Augustus alongside two signa of Mercurius Augustus and Maia Augusta in the aedes which he financed on public ground (elL 13, 1769 = ILS 3206; PI. CII a-c).39O The practice is attested on a very much larger scale at Lambaesis, where an inscription, dated by Wilmanns under Elagabalus or Severus Alexander, preserves a lengthy laterculus of troops who had made imagines sacras aureas-clearly of the imperial house in view of the local cult of the domus divina (elL 8, 2586 = ILS 2381).391 Presumably these were placed in the temple of Aesculapius and Salus, near to which the inscription was found, perhaps on behalf of the salus of the emperor. One of the beneficiar;; consulares is called q(uaestor), so will have been in charge of the treasury instituted for funding the imagines. As noted above (p. 535), two bronze imagines, thought to be of Oct avian and Livia, were actually found in situ at a native sanctuary at Azaila, where they had been deposited.

Good examples we have met are the imperial busts at Avenches and Marengo (above, pp. 535f.). The basic distinction between simulacrum on the one hand and statua or imago on the other comes out in Tiberius' familiar prohibition that statues and images of himself might not be placed among the simulacra of the gods but only among the ornamenta of shrines (Suet., Tib. 26, 1),,01 To have set the emperor's likeness beside the temple idol would presumably have put him in too close proximity with the gods, in contravention of Tiberius' explicit policy on divine honours (Tac., Ann. 4, 38, 1),.02 and the question arises whether irregularities had already occurred. Domitian, as it turned out, was to be guilty of precisely this excess: ... cum incesti principis statuis permixta deorum simulacra sorderent (Pliny, Paneg. 52, 3).403 The distinction is also implicit in Pliny's correspondence with Trajan regarding the testing of Christians, where the emperor's imago is carefully distinguished from the simulacra of the gods; [Hi] quoque omnes et imaginem tuam deorumque simulacra venerati sunt ... (Epp. 10, 96, 6),,04 The material of which imperial likeness were made is of central interest. 40S In the same passage of the Panegyricus, for instance, Pliny remarks of Trajan itaque tuam statuam in vestibulo [ovis optimi maximi unam a/teramve et hanc aeream cernimus. The use of bronze preceded that of marble and continued to be employed, particularly as a medium for imperial likenesses, but gold and silver images are often mentioned in the sources, and statues and busts can be of gilded or silvered bronze to give the impression of solid metal;406 even marble might be gilded.407 What was the significance of the different metals Suet., Tib. 13, 1; Titus 4, 1; and in inscriptions passim.

At one end of the scale bronze seems to have been considered a sign of modesty, though in itself it was costly enough; the imperial effigy in the shrine at the legionary principia, for example, was usually of bronze. 408 At the other end the use of precious metal, gold or silver, must be seen against its psychological background. Gold in particular was valued for its relative rarity and the intrinsic value that it tended to retain even in times of economic crisis;409 hence it was associated with whatever was optimal or exceptional, such as a Golden Age. Here one must distinguish between gilded statues and those of solid gold.4lO In Rome the latter were evidently the prerogative of the emperor or members of the imperial house (at least post mortem: Suet., Titus 2),411 though in the provinces private individuals could certainly have statues in solid silver after death, if not already in their lifetime.41 2 Otherwise, it would appear that an ordinary per­son, no less than the emperor, was at liberty to have a gilded or silvered likeness of himself. 413 In a secular context this implied no automatic claim to divinity, as once believed.414 But in a temple a cult image of the emperor-like that of any deity-might be of precious metal and an imperial statue or bust of gold or silver would have a divine connotation, the more so if placed in the cella beside the simulacrum. 415 As Pliny's own adulation of Trajan makes plain, it was consequently con­sidered bad form on the part of 'absolutist' emperors that they raised no objection to adulatio in the form of li kenesses in precious metals, whereas 'constitutional' rulers generally refused gold and silver statues in their lifetimes as an excess acceptable only post mortem. 41 6 Claudius, for example, refused a gold statue (andrias) of Pax Augusta Claudiana as reflecting badly on himself by association, though he did allow the Alexandrians to carry in procession another gold statue, possibly of Messalina.417 One of the clearest <0.

XCIX). In the context of precious metals and their significance it is striking that the letters of the emperor's name on a statue base are occasionally found coloured in yellow rather than red-clearly as a substitute for the more costly gilded lettering.422 The oppo­site extreme is attested by a passage of Suetonius recording his acquisition of an old statuette of Augustus with the name Thurinus: ... nactus puerilem imagunculam eius aeream veterem jerreis et paene iam exolescentibus litteris hoc nomine inscriptam (A ug. 7, 1: cf. above, p. 533). The practice of placing a statue in a temple is in fact very 01d.423 Already under the early Republic it was customary to dedicate the imagines clipeatae of illustrious ancestors in temples (Pliny, N.H. 35, 12), and Livy reports that the honour of an ivory statue in the cella of Jupiter Capitolinus was decreed for the Elder Scipio, who refused it, however (38, 56, 12; cf. Val. Max. 4, 1, 6);424 an andrias of the Elder Cato, celebrating his achievements as censor, was actually set up by the people in the temple of Salus (Plut., Cat. Maior 19, 4). Similarly Caesar, who placed a beautiful eikon of Cleopatra beside the cult statue in the temple of Venus Genetrix (Appian, B.C. 2, 102), himself had an eikon in the temple of Quirinus, and according to Dio his statue was to be set up in all the temples of Rome and in the cities of ltaly.425 Octavian's statue also appears to have been placed beside the cult idol in the temples of the Italian municipalities.426 In the Imperial period the image of the emperor could likewise be placed in the temple of a god.

Statues of later emperors are likewise reported to have stood at Rome in the temples-Constantine had his removed to Christian churches.428 With these examples taken from the literary authorities can be compared epigraphical parallels such as the silver imago of Trajan that C. Iulius Nym­phius placed in the temple of sanctus Silvanus at his own expense and dedicated along with other gifts on the Ides of January, A.D. 115 (elL 6, 543 = lLS 3544), or the gold likenesses of Vespasian, Titus and Domitian that were to be placed (presumably in a temple) by the terms of the will of a cen­turion of Legio III Augusta, stationed in Africa (elL 6, 932 = ILS 246). Whether the imagines of members of the Severan family that were gladly deposited by members of the Cohors IV Vigilum at Rome also belong in this category is impossible to tell from the fragmentary state of the inscription (elL 6, 643). What is particularly striking is that even private individuals outside the imperial family could have their likenesses placed in a temple. Augustus' physician, for example, was rewarded with a statue beside the cult image of Aesculapius (Suet., Aug. 59), and the case of L. Volusius Satur­ninus, consul in A.D. 3, is particularly notable. On his death in A.D. 56 at the age of ninety-three the senate decreed, on the motion of Nero himself, that no less than nine statues should be raised to him in various guises, including two in the temple of Divus Augustus and one in that of Divus Iulius (AEpig, 1972, no. 174).429 In the same wayan inscription records that, on the motion of M. Aurelius and Commodus, the senate set up a statue of M. Bassaeus Rufus in two different temples, possibly those of Divus Antoninus Pius and Mars Ultor (elL 6, 1599 = lLS 1326). Outside of Rome much the same pic­ture is attested at Mt. Eryx, where the verses of L. Apronius Caesianus, consul in A.D. 39, reveal that he dedicated an effigies of his father and, along with his father, an effigies of Tiberius in the temple of Venus Erycina, where the inscription was found (elL 10, 7257 = ILS 939).

Flavius Postuminus, a distinguished local citizen, in the basilica (here apparently the portico) of Mars Mullo at Rennes.433 Yet if this was the usual place, it is clear that the statue of a ruler or benefactor could, on occasion, be placed in the cella as a mark of special honour; even the statue of a deceased relative of the benefactor could be allowed there.434 The highest honour, one so advanced that it was unacceptable to Tiberius or Trajan (above, p. 543), was to have one's statue placed beside the cult simulacrum with the clear implication of exalted status by association with the divine. Pliny was scandalized that Domitian, like Gaius earlier, had no inhibitions on this score.435 To put Roman usage into perspective and at the same time bring out its pur­pose and intent it is worth glancing at what is known of corresponding prac­tice in the Greek East.

Finally, what was the purpose behind placing a statue or bust in the porch or cella emerges with reasonable clarity. One element in entrusting gold or silver items to temples was obviously that the sanctity of the location rendered it relatively safe fr om theft, though temple servants kept a close eye on the precious things displayed there.448 But that is a side issue. In theory at least such an object was essentially an offering to the deity \"dedicated in ac�ord­ance with ancient custom for vows or pious reasons\". 449 Occasionally this is stated explicitly, as in the case of a statue of Augustus that the demos of the Athenians and the inhabitants of Delos dedicated to Apollo, Artemis and Leto; though whether this particular piece was actually placed in a joint tem­ple is not in evidence.450 The same interpretation must also be true of Roman usage, and the various examples we have noted of statues and busts set in temples in the Western provinces are consequently to be explained as offerings to the deity of the temple. This holds true whether the temple was one of a Greco-Roman or other deity-or indeed imperial: that is, of Roma and Augustus, a deified emperor, or Roma and living and deified emperors con­jointly.

In Asia Minor we have a Hellenistic prototype at Commagene in the biannual procession of the people to the holy place of Nemrud Dag, where they sacrificed and partook in a meal provided by the priests.461 The most explicit testimony of the Roman imperial period comes from Ephesus, where a decree of the Council refers to the carrying of the type-statues (apeikonismata) and images (eikones), including images of Trajan, Plotina and Divus Augustus, from the temple of Artemis to the theatre on assembly days and on various occasions of the liturgical year; here they were to be displayed at nine set places in the audience, three to one pedestal. 462 The cortege itself, which pro­ceded to the theatre by way of the Magnesian Gate and returned via the Cores­sian, is vividly described in the second century A.D. novel of Xenophon of Ephesus, who lists the members of the procession, including the bearers of various sacred objects (1,2, 2_5).463 At Ephesus the white-clad porters of the type-statues and imperial busts are called 'gold-bearers'464 but elsewhere the standard term is 'imperial-bearers' (sebastophoroi).465 How images could be subject to wear and tear in all this is illustrated by a letter of Marcus Aurelius '\" Wilcken (above, note 81) (1885) 458 ad Frag.

On each of five successive days the festivities began with a procession in which painted eikones of Divus Augustus, Livia and Tiberius were escorted by participants, wearing white clothes and crowns of bay, from the temple of Asklepios and Hygieia to the imperial shrine and thence via the agora to the theatre.470 At Athens and Tanagra such bearers of the imperial busts are called o\"E�OtO\"'tocp6pot, as in Asia Minor, and are attested among the ephebes in connection with the imperial cult. 471 An explicit mention of the rite is contained in the letter of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus to the Athenian gerousia (above, p. 545), in which the emperors accept bronze protomai of moderate size so that on holidays these can be easily transported to wherever was wished on every occasion-for example to the popular assemblies. It is worth remarking in parenthesis at this point that the reception of the imperial likeness was evidently an important event in the life of local com­munities in the Eastern provinces, where it had the character of a popular festival.

After Germanicus' death it was decreed that his ivory image should be transported in the pompa circensis (Tac., Ann. 2, 83, 1) and his chair bearing an oak wreath was placed in the theatre at the ludi Augustales;493 Drusus, Agrippina Maior (Suet., Gaius 15, 1) and Britannicus were all given similar honours. More startling is the cult image of his dead sister Drusilla that Caligula ordered to be drawn by elephants on a carriage into the Circus (CD 59, 13, 8).494 But such rites could also be spontaneous. Tacitus reports that on the occasion of a demonstration on behalf of Agrip­pina and her son Nero the crowd carried around their effigies (An n. 5, 4, 3), and imagines of Octavia, sprinkled with flowers, were likewise borne by people on their shoulders and placed in the forum and in the temples (Ann. 14, 61, 1) .. In the same way on news of the death of Otho and the supremacy of Vitellius a demonstration on behalf of the dead Galba included the carrying of his imagines with bay-leafs and flowers around the temples (Hist., 2, 55; see further Plut., Otho 3, 1). As for the ruler cult itself, the best known example of such a procession is that of the Romaia Sebasta at Naples (above, p. 510). In the complex regula­tions for this important festival (/ Olympia 56) there is no mention of the transportation of the imperial image but some form of the rite in connection with the cortege of competitors and officials to the Caesareum (II. 48ff.) would certainly have been appropriate. It has already been suggested that at Ostia, for example, the imagines and statuae given by members of an unknown college (A Ep ig , 1940, no. 62) will have been kept in the aedes of the collegial schola and quite possibly carried in procession by the members on solemn days such as imperial birthdays (above, p. 539). Similar rites can be also supposed elsewhere in Italy, particularly on the part of associations of cultores of the Lares Augusti and the emperor's imago. There seems every justification, then, for pursuing this line of reasoning further and to infer that similar processions with the carrying of imperial likenesses-a practice ingrained in Roman cult-will have marked the major imperial occasions of the year in the Latin west, very much as they did in the Eastern provinces of the Roman Empire. Both at the provincial and at the municipal level such public demonstrations must have been factors con­tributing significantly to social cohesion and imperial unanimity.

The details we have of provincial festivals in the East with their contentious pro­cessions of delegates to the koinon, who accompanied the high priest in his purple robes,496 provide a paradigm of what could be expected to have taken place at Lugdunum, Narbo, Tarraco and elsewhere. That other sacred objects, such as sacrificial utensils, were also transported is no more than an attractive hypothesis, but such would certainly have been in line with Roman practice.497 Nor do we know whether such processions might have included the transportation of the actual cult image(s); all that can be said is that such was a regular procedure at Rome and is attested on occasion in the municipalities of Italy. 498 The rite is also documented at Arsinoe, not that Egyptian practice is of any direct relevance (above, p. 551). Evidence in support of such a thesis is extremely scarce but there is enough to suggest that it approximates to the facts. No direct testimony in the form of imperial likenesses has survived at the sanctuary of the Three Gauls but we have seen that coins struck at the local imperial mint show the federal altar crowned with what appear to be busts, perhaps also statuettes, on either side of two central aediculae that conceivably held representations of Roma and the Augustus (above, Vol. I, 1, Pis. XIII-XVII).499 As noted earlier, the transportation of an apparently similar baldachin is illustrated on a wall fresco from Pompeii (above, p. 554; PI. eIII a). It seems very possible, then, that these will have been carried in processions which were deployed on the steps at either side of the great altar and proceded to and from the adjacent amphitheatre within the federal sanctuary (above, Vol. I, 2; PI. LXIII a). Significantly, vomitaria give access from the direction of the altar into the arena, where processions would have made their entrance directly facing the tribunal, the seat of the emperor (if present) or of the high priest of the Three Gauls (cf. Vol. I, 1; PI. XXII). Where the holy things were kept on other days is unclear but the likeliest possibility is at the council house (curia), con­ceivably in some sort of shrine;soo on the coins the images and baldaquins are presumably shown in ritual use: that is, displayed on the altar before or after being carried in procession.

SOl At Narbo the busts and statues attested in the provincial charter (above, p. 540) are clearly ritual objects since the context makes it clear that they were financed out of the surplus from funds destined for ritual purposes; the inference that they may have been kept in the provincial temple (I. 28) fits exactly with what is known of standard practice elsewhere (above, p. 547). Here again it seems reasonable to suppose that processions will have linked the temple with the nearby amphitheatre on appropriate occasions (above, Vol. I, 2, PI. LIII). Similarly at Emerita what looks to have been a gold bust of Titus fits nicely into this reconstruction. A small marble base found there at the seat of the provincial cult records that the province (that is, the provin­cial council) has dedicated a gold object of five pounds weight to Titus, son of Vespasian, probably in the summer of A.D. 77; both the provincial priest and the propraetorian legate are associated in the act of dedication (CIL 2, 5264 = ILS 264). S02 Presumably this piece too was housed in the provincial temple known from coins (above, Vol. I, 1, PI. XXXVI), and solemnly car­ried on feast-days between there and the amphitheatre. A comparable picture no doubt also holds true of Corduba, where the amphitheatre may likewise have been part of the provincial monumental complex. SOl Lastly at Tarraco the statues of Trajan that were to be gilded by Cn. Numisius Modestus (above, p. 541) doubtless stood in the provincial temple and were meant to be transported in processions that wound their way from here on the upper level of the Roman city down to the amphitheatre located to the south-west on a lower slope (above, Vol. I, 1, PI. XXXV). S04 It need hardly be added that similar rites can reasonably be presumed at Camulodunum, Gorsium, Car­thage and provincial centres elsewhere, where evidence has not yet emerged. A parallel rite at the municipal level can also be inferred with a strong degree of probability despite the almost complete dearth of direct evidence. At Tarraco, for example, it seems very possible that on high feast-days proces­sions will have connected the centre of the municipal cult-originally the 'altar of Augustus', later possibly a temple-with the theatre situated on a promontory just outside the town wall, less than two hundred metres to the south-east of the lower forum (PI. CVIIa; cf. above, Vol. I, 1, PI. XXXV). Here dramatic performances were staged, as confirmed by an inscription attesting a mimographus (CIL 2, 4092 = RIT 53).

Such statues may well have been kept in the municipal temple if in fact one existed at Tarraco parallel to that by the forum of Emerita. sos Whether the celebrations of the civic cult included the amphitheatre (and circus?) within their scope or whether the latter facilities were reserved solely for provincial ceremonies can hardly be said. In any event it is attractive to propose a similar reconstruction at Lugdunum, where processions could have descended from the municipal temple to the theatre and odeon (PIs. CIX, CXI), likewise at Emerita with its municipal temple, great theatre and amphitheatre (PI. CXa; cf. above, Vol. I, 1; PI. XXXVI), and at dozens of other leading centres with their monuments throughout the provinces of the Western empire-Aries or Nimes, for example. In all of these, processions-with the carrying of imperial images-will have been a principal feature of imperial high festivals and one can picture the municipal priest resplendent in cap, head-bands and purple vestments, doubtless accompanied by the jlaminica and other civic functionaries. S06 Two cities are of particular interest in this regard. As Etienne has pointed out, S07 it is striking that at Amiens the amphitheatre has been constructed, despite boggy terrain, at the west end of the forum in such a way as to provide a close connection on its east side with the forum and its imperial temple (PI. CIII b). Here, in much the same way as at Lugdunum (above, p. 557), a vomitorium provides oblique, inclined access from the forum into the arena, where processions would have arrived before the tribunal of the editor muneris, often enough the local imperial priest. The overall architectural design thus emphasizes the ritual link between the amphitheatre and the tem­ple. More impressively still, a tiled way, evidently intended for processions, leads from the entrance of the temenos to the steps of the temple podium at the imperial sanctuary of Cigognier (PIs. CI, ClII c). S08 Outside the temenos is an apparently open space before one arrives at the rear of the theatre facade, which we have seen to be aligned and of equal dimensions with the south end of the temple portico (above, p. 523; PI. XCVIII a). Very possibly, then, the processional way continued beyond the court of the temple across 50' For possible traces of a municipal temple at Tarraco see D.

Etienne, drawing on the model of the Secular Games (17 B.C.) in particular, tentatively proposes that processions will have departed from the cella, perhaps dividing into two to pass along the portico; the general public, men on one side, women on the other, he sees standing on the three tiers that connect the portico with the court, from which elevation they would have commanded a view of the rites performed below. 509 Imaginative as this is, it may well come close to what actually took place. However, one might suggest that the 4.40m. by 4.70m. base, which straddles the processional way some 33m. from the podium, could be that of a square altar rather than of a piece of statuary; it looks from the drawing at least to be placed where the altar in front of the cella ought to be. One category of evidence deserves special mention in this context. In Britain a number of small, bronze heads of emperors has been found, one of which in particular shows Antoninus Pius (PI. CIV a) and comes from a Celtic rustic shrine at Willingham Fen, Cambridgeshire:510 other examples, perhaps also originating from shrines, include a head of Hadrian (?) and a yew-wood, female head of uncertain identity. 51 1 Items such as these, when found in shrines, belong in the category of statues deposited as offerings in temples (above, pp. 540ff.), but the fact that they were evidently mounted on sceptres strongly suggests that they are to be interpreted along the lines of the semeai at Side and elsewhere (above, p. 552).512 In other words they were intended to be carried in procession on local festive occasions, some of them no doubt imperial as in the cult of Artemis at Ephesus (above, p. 551).

S1 6 No such official is attested in the Latin provinces but some sort tendance can be safely assumed as mandatory, perhaps performed by a temple aedituus or a functionary of the provincial council. In any event images will also have needed cleaning, especially in preparation for feast days. In Palestine, so a late work reports, imperial statues set up in the theatres and the circuses were cleaned by a man whose appointment gave him his livelihood and an impor­tant place among government officials. S 17 But the most helpful source is the bequest of G. Vibius Salutaris, SIB in which a clause records the payment of thirty denarii to the cleaner, whose services are required each time the type­statues are carried back to the sanctuary (II. 281-3); another clause even men­tions a kind of silver polish (II. 542, 549). One may compare entries in the tem­ple accounts of ArsinoeS19 regarding expenses for oil to clean statues on the greater feast-days and the payment of aXo(Axoupro� to do the job of cleaning (Pag.

Direct evidence for the cleaning of imperial statues or busts is lacking in the western provinces but oiling is frequently mentioned by the literary authorities as a preliminary to decking with flowers;S20 Pliny in particular describes how on festive days the military stan­dards were cleaned of dirt and dust with oil (NH 13, 4, 23).

The garlanding of statues was the high point of the Rosaliae Signorum, a festival taken over from civilian life by the military; the day is commemorated in the Feriale Duranum by a supplicatio, which will have followed the ceremony of hanging chaplets of roses on the standards grouped by the altar.523 While our sources are again silent on the point, everything suggests that the portable imagines or statues of the emperor will also have been wreathed on due occasion. Certainly the garlanding of images is mentioned by Tacitus in connection with the popular demonstrations of A.D. 62 and 69 (above, p. 556),524 and as late as the sixth century the image of Constantine was carried in procession and crowned. 525 The practice was in fact widespread throughout the Greco-Roman world. In the temple accounts of Arsinoe, for example, there is provision for the crowning of statues on every single feast­day throughout the year/26 while at Elephantine crowning looks to have been one of the duties of the civil strategos (?).527 A similar rite was performed by the gerousia of Istros, S28 inferentially by the imperial choir at Pergamum, S29 and is attested at Beroia in Macedonia, where an inscription refers to \"the crowned images of the Sebastoi\". S30 As for clothing, statues of the gods had been adorned with clothes from the earliest times in both Egypt and Greece-the pep/os of Athene Parthenos is a familiar instance among many others that are recorded. 531 The practice naturally persisted in the Roman period, right down to the late empire. Perhaps the best known example is the golden statue of Caligula in his own temple, which had to wear the same clothing as the emperor himself (Suet., '\" \"Fer.Dur.\" 115 -120 ad Col. II, 14; cf.

More to the point for present purposes, Suetonius mentions that on the death of Nero there were some who, in contrast to the public rejoicing, displayed his imagines praetextatas on the Rostra (Nero 57, 1); and an inscrip­tion from Bovillae has the phrase additis vestibus, which conceivably attests the clothing of gold imagines (presumably of the emperor) within an aedicula (CIL 14, 2416), unless the reference is to some other image within the shrine; cf. CIL 6, 927 (= lLS 236), ClL 9, 3887 (= lLS 3626). Quite clearly, then, statues and busts of the emperor were treated in exactly the same way as the statues of the gods. That such a practice will have been incorporated into the ruler cult of the Western provinces seems highly likely. Pekary has indeed pro­posed that a reference to golden clothes is pr eserved in the dedication to Divus Verus at Tarraco (above, p. 559)-not to golden statues as restored by G. AlfOldy.S32 Whatever the merits of that suggestion, we seem to have a clear case within the ruler cult at Mactar in Tunisia, where an edictum sacrum men­tions the temple of Roma and Augustus:S33 here a statue, quite possibly of the emperor, is to be clothed in a tunica aurea like the clothes put on a statue (?) of Caesar (AE pig, 1957, no. 55). If the latter is the cult signum of the emperor beside the image of Roma, this will be an example of a statue which has been placed, technically as an offering, in an imperial temple and clad in clothes to match those of the cult idol-very much as the clothing of the cult idol within the temple of Caligula matched the clothes of the emperor himself. 534 There remains the possibility that in imperial processions the emperor's likeness will have been accompanied by torches, candles or lamps, no doubt also by incense burners.535 Such a usage is, in fact, standard procedure in Greek, Hellenistic and Roman ritual. At Ephesus, for example, we know from Xenophon's account (above, p. 551) that torches along with sacred objects, baskets and incense burners were transported in the procession marking the festival of Artemis. AlfOldi has assembled evidence for the rite in Roman practice and shown that the ceremonial use of candles and torches as a way of honouring the emperor and his representation became increasingly com­mon under the Roman empire; in particular it played a key role in the cere­mony of the adventus or the reception of the labratum (above, pp. 552f.).536 Even under the Republic magistrates had enjoyed the right of having their way home at night lit by torchlight, and coins confirm that, as sacerdos of Divus Augustus, Antonia Minor had the privilege of two torches.

S38 Despite the lack of direct evidence, therefore, it seems very possible that lights of one form or another will have been an integral part of the cortege whenever imperial likenesses were transported in provincial, municipal or collegial cult. Whether musicians also participated we do not know but the possibility cannot be entirely excluded. S39 Certainly horn blowers, lyre players and flutists were featured in the pompa circensis, and Tertullian rails that in the case of the ludi scaenici the procession to the theatre set off a tempUs et aris et ilia infeUcitate turis et sanguinis inter tibias et tubas (De spectat. 14). On the other hand there seems to have been nothing in the ruler cult to correspond to the armed dancers (Iudiones), who according to Dionysius of Halicarnassus marched in both the circus and theatrical proces­sions (2, 71, 3_4).540 Finally there is the question of what rites, if any, might have been per­formed before these imperial images. Comparable evidence from the East is straightforward up to a point. At Gytheum, once the procession had reached the theatre, incense was offered before the images of Augustus, Livia and Tiberius preliminary to the start of proceedings: I. 5 of the VO!LO� (EpO� refers to a 9uILtcx'tTjpwv which is to be placed on a table in the middle of the theatre. 54l Similar rites before an imperial likeness are occasionally attested by papyri and inscriptions. Thus Claudius permitted the athletes and Dionysiac artists to pay cult to his eikones (P. Oxy . 27, 2476: II. 2-3) and an honorific statue to a certain Hoplon from the township of Adadae in Pisidia has an inscription on its base: 1tpo9uO\"cx� oE xcxt 'tWV 9tCwv dxovwv xcxt &ywvcx Em'tE)'EO\"cx� oLxo9EV (IORR 3, 371).542 The fact that this record was found just north of the imperial tem-S l7 Gall.

The procession had gone from the temple of Asclepius and Hygeia to the imperial shrine, where the ephors sacrificed a bull, and thence to the main square, the scene of another sacrifice, before arriving at the theatre (above, pp. 514, 552). The sequence compares closely with the sacrifices offered at the beginning, in the course, and at the close of the pompa circensis (Tertullian, De spectac. 7; cf. Dion. Hal. 7, 72, IS, referring to sacrifices after the pro­cession). On thymiateria see recently P. Gros and D. Theodorescu, \"L' \"autel\" du forum d'Assise\", MEFRA 99 (1987), 693-710 at 701 ff.

The point is confirmed at another town in Pisidia (?Pednelissus), where the title 1tpo9u't7jc; 'tWV :E&�ota'twv is certainly con­nected with the ruler cult (SEG 2, 1925, no. 718, cf. 717). Whereas Robert took it that the office of the prothytes was to offer sacrifice to the imperial images, Price suggests that the pro implies sacrifices on behalf ojthe emperor. In that case offerings would have been made on behalf of deceased emperors at Pednelissus (?) since the divi are here included in the Sebastoi. Strange as this idea seems, it is attested in the Gytheum inscription. 54) In any event it is clear that the prothytes served the cult of the emperor and that rites associated with the imperial images consisted of sacrifices. As for what form these took, only incense is mentioned at Gytheum, but there appears no good reason to doubt Robert's assumption that the normal offering will have been both wine and incense.544 In the Roman world we have already noted the rites performed before the statues of the Gracchi and Marius Gratidianus, for example, or by Ovid at his Lararium in Tomis (above, p. 532). Interestingly, the metrical inscription of Ursus even mentions the kind of wine that it would be appropriate to offer before a statue: ... et merum projundite nigrum Falernum I aut Setinum aut Caecubum ... (CIL 6, 9797 = ILS 5173: II. 9f.). Such evidence not only relates to the private cult of the imago but has a direct bearing upon the rites that may conceivably have been performed before the portable likenesses of the imperial house. The testimony of Pliny in particular, with its account of how those indicted as Christians were required to supplicate the emperor's image ture ac vino, is especially relevant (Epp. 10, 96, 5f.). Similar rites before imperial imagines also played a role in formal submissions545 to Roman authority or the recognition of new emperors.546 That images carried in pro­cession on festival days will have been paid cult under comparable forms in the Latin West seems therefore very possible. Just as at Gytheum, a sacrifice may well have marked their arrival at the amphitheatre or theatre of Lugdunum, Narbo, Tarraco and other major cities of the western provinces.

On the other hand the outside possibility that a supposed further rite at Gytheum could also have had a counterpart in the Western ruler cult is best left out of consideration. At the conclusion of the sacrifices beginning each day's celebration at Gytheum the eikones of Divus Augustus, Livia and Tiberius were installed on some sort of support and it has been proposed that these were not pedestals as at Ephesus (above, p. 551) but couches (xATIiOtt, lectus), a procedure that outwardly at least would resemble the ritual of the lectisternium. 5 47 Nothing in the evidence from the Latin provinces gives the slightest hint of a parallel practice in the Western ruler cult, though the ceremony itself is, of course, a familiar feature of Roman ritual. 548 (vi) Other Rites We have seen that the busts and statues attested at Lyon, Narbo, Tarraco and Emerita will have been cleaned, annointed, crowned, possibly clothed, and accompanied by lights, perhaps also music in processions. There remains the strong probability that much the same ten dance will have been extended to the cult image within the cella of an imperial temple. Certainly the idea can be supported by comparative evidence from the Greek East including Egypt, where the cleaning, annointing, crowning and clothing of cult statues was traditional practice.549 That such attention was commonly extended to statues in temples elsewhere in the Roman world is confirmed by numerous passages in the authors, particularly a sarcastic diatribe by Seneca on the shameful nonsense that went on at the Capitolium (frg. 36: Haase, p. 24). If the sug­gested interpretation of an inscription at Mactar is correct (above, p. 563), we may even have direct evidence for the clothing of the cult statue of the emperor in the local temple of Roma and Augustus (AE pig, 1957, no. 55). One feature that demands special notice is the illumination of precincts and temples in general and its place within the ruler cult in particular. Nilsson has traced the background to the use of torches and lamps in pagan divine service and shown that, whereas the lighting provided by torches was originally more common in Greece, by the end of the Hellenistic period the lamp had developed from a votive offering to a deity such as Demeter into a standard 54' Rostovtzeff (above, note 407) 12-16.

Prudentius, Cathem. 5, 149-56). SSI What role the lamp could play in imperial rites is illustrated by an inscription from Teos attesting a combined cult of Dionysus and Tiberius: along with hymn-singing at the opening of the temple of Dionysus, the daily rites include the offering of incense, libations and the lighting of the lamps by the priest of Tiberius on both opening and closing. SS2 So, too, at Pergamum Pleket has suggested that, in celebrating the mysteries of Divus Augustus, the dead emperor's image will have been suddenly illuminated by the glare of lamps and adduces parallels for the technique from the Eleusinian and other mysteries.

Here the ceremony was carried out by priests, whereas at Athens illumination of the eikones may have been one of the duties of the zakoros (above, p. 561). In the Roman world candles or lamps were commonly used in the household cult of the Lares, Penates and Genius, but lamps can also be dedicated to the Genius of a municipality or even to Jupiter-the image of Tutela in particular was hallowed with candles and lamps, as also were the altars of Saturn. SSS The early link of illumination with the cult of an individual is clear from Cicero's comment on the reaction of the people to the benefits conferred by the praetor Marius Gratidianus in 86 B.C.: omnibus vicis statuae, ad eas tus, cerei. quid multa? nemo unquam multitudini fu i! carior (De off. 3, 20, 80). Candelabra, presumably for cult purposes, occur among the gifts of members of a college of hand workers (?) at Ostia (AEpig, 1940, no. 62: II, I. 18}SS6 and, just as Constantine's statue was honoured with burn­ing lamps and incense, so the emperor's picture is shown in the Notitia Dignitatum with two lighted candles on candlesticks at either side (PI.

Rites resembling those within the temple of Jupiter Capito linus at Arsinoe could well be the best explanation of the Lychnapsia, the lamp festival of Isis which is recorded in the calendar of Philocalus for 12th August. 558 Whether some form of lighting played a role in the ruler cult of the Western provinces must remain no more than an attractive speculation but the possibility seems supported indirectly by finds of candelabra associated with other cults. Thus in Britain a bronze, twelve-sided dodecahedra from Lydney and small enamelled stands found at temple sites suggest the use of candles or tapers in cult ceremonies.559 Similarly inscriptions occasionally attest the role of illumination in the cults of Mercury560 and Aesculapius,s61 for exam­ple. No doubt future discoveries will contribute to a fuller picture. Along with lamps, incense and libations, hymns in honour of the gods were a standard feature of a wide range of Greek cults and were customarily sang or chanted at festivals or on special occasions.562 Singing and instrumental music accompanied the passage of processions, while at temples hymns were evidently sung at set hours, particularly in the morning-very much as in the Christian liturgy of today. 563 Choruses of men and women, boys and girls per­formed,564 and societies such as the hymnodoi of Artemis at Ephesus were a privileged and distinguished group who shared with the local senate and gerousia in the distribution of funds.565 A well-known inscription of the imperial period from Stratonicea in Caria records the selection of thirty boys of good birth who, clad in white garments, wreathed and with olive shoots in their hands, are to sing before the images of Zeus Panamaros and Hekate, the city gods (ClO 271 5a).566 ' \" Alfbldi, Repriisentation 114 with Abb. 10, cf.

Parodoi, presumably the processional entrances of a chorus singing or reciting, are scheduled in the Tetubnis papyrus in celebration of certain imperial feast days;567 while competitions in prose or verse encomia for various emperors (Hadrian, Trajan, Nerva) and the house of the Sebastoi are attested at the Isthmian Caesarea.568 The institu­tion we know best, however, is the imperial choir of Asia. S69 Originally a voluntary organization formed to sing hymns in honour of Augustus, it was later recognized and funded by the whole province of Asia.570 A Hadrianic text (above, p. 514) shows that members of the college at Pergamum, where it had its own building and two hymnodidaskaloi, paid a very high entrance fee, unless they were the sons of old members, and that most of them (thirty­two out of thirty-six) were Roman citizens. S7I They thus formed an elitist, largely hereditary body that sang on imperial occasions such as 3rd January and the natales of emperors, and still celebrated the birthdays of Augustus and Livia each year, also on a smaller scale that of Augustus each month; on the first day of Augustus' annual, two-day birthday celebration (22nd-23rd September) a 7t<XP<X�WfLWV is to be sung. Presumably hymns were sung as the performers approached or stood about the temple or sanctuary but we have no idea of the content or wording of their hymns, whether at Pergamum or elsewhere. S72 However, it is possible that the triple invocation addressed to Augustus when he happened to be seen in the bay of Puteoli by passengers and crew of a ship from Alexandria, besides concealing an assimilation of the emperor to Zeus, may echo the ritual acclamations that were chanted at the Caesareum of Alexandria.573 Similar ixq>wv�ae.L� occur in the divine honours '\" Above, note 79; cf.

CD 59, 16, 10). Choirs of noble children and women of repute likewise sang at the funeral services for Septimius Severus (Herodian 4, 2, 5) and hymns and choruses are recorded to have welcomed various emperors on entry into Rome or appearance at the theatre or games.576 A diff erent facet of the overall pic­ture is the chanting of acclamations, a theme traced by Alfoldi from the Republican period down to the Empire, when rhythmic acclamations were a feature of the emperor's adventus, meetings of the senate, and games.577 Whereas Augustus tried to curb the practice (Suet., Aug. 53, 2), fifty years after the spontaneous demonstration in the bay of Puteoli this Hellenistic custom had made such inroads that Nero organized his Augustiani, a special chorus to lead the applause at the theatre and elsewhere (Suet., Nero 20, 3; 25, 1; Tac., Ann. 1 4 , 15; CD 61, 20, 4). Under Nero at least such acclamations culminated in calling the emperor by the name of a god (CD 63, 20, 5):578 which would put them in the same category of divine honours as assimilations in iconography or epigraphy.

Certainly the verse form of occasional dedications suggests that elevated language typical of hymns was considered appropriate to the gods.580 MacMullen may also be right that a reference in Firmicus Maternus to hymn% gos et qui /audes deorum eum iaetantiae ostentatione deeantent (Math. 3, 5, 33) applies generally to the Latin West as a whole.581 At all events nothing seems to preclude the hypothesis that hymn-singing or acclamations, perhaps in association with the processions marking imperial festivals, may have been an integral part of the ritual at Lyon, Tarraco and other leading centres of the Western imperial cult. S82 In addition to hymns we also hear of speeches, which were an established part of mystery cults in particular. Inscriptions record only the title 9e.oA6yo<; but there can be no doubt that the role of these functionaries was to deliver 'theologies'-essentially prose hymns celebrating the virtues of the gods.S83 A theology would tell the story of the god's birth, how he got his name, what his precise nature was and so on, as is clear from some of the speeches of Aristides Rhetor, also from a guide to the composition of theologies written by Menander of Laodicea. At Epidaurus, for instance, a the%gos may have given a sermon on certain feast days in praise of Asclepius just as the the%goi at Ephesus eulogized Artemis,584 whereas in the mysteries of Demeter Thesmophoros at Smyrna two female the%goi not only praised the goddess but may also have danced the parts of Demeter and Core.585 In the ruler cult itself the%goi, who often were also hymn% goi as in other cults (cf. OGIS 513, n. 4 with refs.), are attested at Pergamum (IGRR 4, 353: A 1. 32) and Smyrna (IGRR 4, 1431: 1. 38; ?1398: 1. 2) and were organized in colleges.586 All analogy suggests that their function was to praise the emperor in a sermon as part of ceremonies on festival days;587 significantly the title of 179 L.

Related officials called 9e.O\"fL'!l06t appear to have eulogized the emperor in verse at the provincial Augusteum of Ephesus.59o What these inscriptions illustrate, then, is the place of the panegyric within the imperial cult.591 In the Western empire competitions in Greek and Latin prose declamation as well as in music, riding and gymnastics, were an important part of the Capitoline games instituted by Domitian in A.D. 86 (Suet., Domit. 4, 4),592 while from late antiquity a whole series of panegyrics has come down.593 In Roman Gaul local interest in oratory generally is shown by a small figure of a seated orator in bronze applique, found at Fendeille (AI Rec), its base inscribed at the back with the opening words of Cicero's First Catilinarian Oration (PI. CV b). 594 The significant evidence for present purposes, however, is the competition in Greek and Latin oratory which took place during the games given by Gaius at Lugdunum in A.D. 39/40. Suetonius, who alone makes reference to the incident (Gaius 20), records simply that eccentric penalties were reserved for the losers, who had to lick off their writings or erase them with a sponge and could even be beaten with rods and thrown into the river. A line of Juvenal suggests that, half a century later, \"speaking at Lyons\" had come to mean being in a tight spot or something of the sort.

Juvenal, I.e.). The possibility arises, therefore, that the competition in which Gaius took such a personal interest, was designed to find a rhetor whose services would be put to use in delivering a panegyric on the emperor at the federal centre. If so, it is conceivable that behind this odd tale may lie a western equivalent of the sebastologos who delivered the eulogy on the emperor Gaius at the celebrations of the provincial ruler cult at Didyma. Regrettably no evidence beyond Juvenal has so far accrued to support the existence of such a rhetor. Lastly, the performance of mysteries597 within the imperial cult is attested at Pergamum and has left its traces in inscriptions from Bithynia and Ancyra in Galatia.

Whatever their particular affiliation, games helped to integrate society, to bring about a rapprochement of the social classes by uniting them in harmony around the person of the emperor61°-whether he was physically in attendance himself or represented by his statue or empty chair;6 11 here was where the empire materialized, seated with the princeps according to social status. 61 2 Such gatherings were an occasion for public demonstrations of unanimitas with the imperial house, and at both the theatre and the amphitheatre pro­ceedings regularly began with collective homage (cf. Pliny, Paneg. 54,1f.).613 Since they were customarily held on major imperial festivals such as the emperor's birthday, games also took on an empire-wide dimension that helped to sound the theme of imperial oecumenism; the success of this could be gauged by attendance, which seems to have been heavy.614 The point is true of provincial and municipal games but especially so of international events such as the Romaia Sebasta at Naples, which had been established in line with a new universalist mystique. One should also give weight to a psychological link with the ruler cult.

The association of games with the emperor specifically is attested at Rome in the ludi circenses that marked Augustus' birthday (23rd September) from 13 B.C., the ludi Augustales (3rd-12th October) first introduced in 11 B.C., and the private games instituted by Livia in honour of Divus Augustus and held every year on the Palatine (eventually 17th-22nd January); these ludi Palatini continued to be celebrated down to the late empire in affirmation of unity with the founder of the empire. 61 1 Similarly Gaius gave two days of ban­quets, spectacles and horse races to mark the dedication of the temple of Divus Augustus in A.D. 37.618 At a lower level Livia's birthday was marked at Rome by gladiatorial games and a public banquet given by the decurions and the Augustales in A.D. 108 (elL 6, 29681), while elsewhere in Italy monuments of the Augustales show processions, gladiatorial combats, the tribunal of the sevir presiding at games, a section of the benches occupied by spectators, and so on.619 All of this is key evidence for the contribution of well-to-do Augustales in putting on games in honour of the emperor and his family, and to iconography can be added the testimony of inscriptions, notably at Puteoli, Caere and Falerii.620 Similarly games are prescribed at Forum Clodii for 13th-1 8th August in the inscription of the altar of the Numen Augustum (elL 11, 3303 = ILS 154, I. 14) and Constantine entrusted an imperial priest with the provision of scenic and gladiatorial games at Hispellum in Umbria in connection with the aedes gentis F1aviae he had built there (elL 11, 5265 = ILS 705).621 A striking example of the practice outside the cult of the emperor is the additional day of gymnastic games and the plac­ing of his seat in the theatre at scenic games that were awarded as posthumous honours to M.

Civic Sebasteia or Kaisareia, which also bear particular names such as Hadrianeia, Antoneia, Antoneia Geteia, Severeia, Alexan­dreia, were celebrated with games, usually at intervals of two or four years, and attracted wide-spread acclaim and appreciation.624 Likewise at the provin­cial level high priests tried to enhance the lustre of the festivals they organized by adding plays, gladiatorial combats, venationes and animal fights, which might continue for days or even weeks on end. These events brought prestige and a life-long title such as Asiarch, to which one's descendants would refer in inscriptions, but so high were the costs a priest incurred that in the end they became prohibitive and had to be split among several individuals.62S Among the best known games are those associated with the provincial festival of Asia, which appears to have been held annually at a different centre each year: Pergamum, Ephesus, Smyrna and so on. A good example in a client state is the quinquennial festival instituted by Herodes in 9 B.C. to celebrate the new city of Caesarea;626 an amphitheatre and theatre, perhaps also a stadium and circus were constructed for the holding of games (Josephus, Bell. Iud. 1,415; Ant. Iud. 16, 1370. A darker side of the picture is the martyrdom of Chris­tians, which took place in the context of games linked with imperial festivals or put on by imperial priests.627 It was in the amphitheatre that condemned prisoners were decapitated, burned alive or exposed to the beasts, so the set­ting was appropriate for the punishment of those who refused to pay cult to the gods of Rome, one aspect of which was the cult of the emperor. 628 '\" L.

Thus the Acts of the Christian Martyrs record that early in the third century St. Perpetua was thrown to the beasts at Carthage during games marking the birthday of Geta,629 and the deaths of bishop Fructuosus and his two deacons Augurius and Eulogius took place in the amphitheatre at Tarraco on 21st January, A.D. 259, possibly an imperial occasion of Valerian not otherwise attested.6lO A similar instance may be the martyrdom ca. A.D. 304 of Fabius in Caesarea during the persecution of Diocletian; the con cilium of Mauretania Caesariensis plays a prominent role in the story.631 The best known martyr­doms of all are described in what purports to be a letter written by \"the ser­vants of Christ who dwell in Vienne and Lyon in Gaul to our brothers in Asia and Phrygia\". It describes the deaths of members of the Christian community at Lugdunum-bishop Pothinus, the deacon Sanctus, Blandina and others­in the course of games that are usually assigned to A.D. 177 (Eusebius, Hist.

The event clearly fell into two episodes (1, 44f.), the second of which evidently coincided with the August festival at Lugdunum \" populous with people assembled to it from all the nations\" (1, 47), when the con cilium of the Three Gauls held its annual reunion.632 A possible date for the first episode may be the games marking the natatis of the emperor Marcus Aurelius (26th April);6 33 this was celebrated by a three-day festival (24th-26th April) at Nimes (ClL 12, 5905: A.D. 161; PI.

Otherwise the scattered evidence we have adds up to a similar picture to that in the East. Provincial games were a liturgy of the high priest,637 who is shown presiding at them on an ivory diptych of ca. A.D. 400 (above, p. 478; PI. LXXXVI a, b); but similar munificence was also expected at the civic level of municipal priests and priestesses638 and the provision of games was one of the expenses supported by the freedman organizations of Augustales.

A.D. 176 de sumptibus ludorum gladiatoriorum immuendis, a copy of which is preserved on a bronze tablet found at Italica in Baetica (CIL 2, 6278 = ILS 5163; cf. AEpig, 1909, no. 184 = lLS 9340: Sardis). The tablet records the speech of a senator in support of the measure, following the reading in the senate of an address by Marcus Aurelius and his son and colleague Commodus (cf. SHA, Marcus 27, 6; cf. II, 4).640 To reduce costs high priests might purchase gladiators from their predecessor and sell them to their successor and the distribution of combats during the various days of the games is now officially regulated. It has been argued that the priests of the Three Gauls also had the special privilege of substituting cheap, condemned prisoners (?trinqui) for expensive gladiators-which in turn would suggest a connection with the Christians punished at Lyon in A.D. 177;641 but the thesis lacks confirmation in the letter at least. In contrast we have an example of ostentatious expense on the part of a high priest of the Three Gauls in the eight pairs of gladiators that T. Sen­nius Sollemnis displayed at Lugdunum on each of four days ca. A.D. 220 (IL TG 341; above, Vol. I, 2, Pis. LXXIIf.).642 The prominence of the enter­tainment side of the priesthood also comes out in Augustine's comments on the provincial priesthood of Apuleius at Carthage,643 and after the triumph of Christianity games became the principal activity of imperial priests.644 That Gaius himself underwrote the costs of the games he gave at Lyon in A.D. 39/40 seems very likely (above, p. 572); on this occasion there is no explicit mention of gladiatorial contests, though Dio reports that he had taken gladiators along with him to Gaul (59, 21, 2). On the other hand Vitellius is described by Dio as simply a spectator of gladiatorial games here in A.D. 69, so presumably these were paid for by the high priest (65, I, 2a).645 On a more general level attention may be drawn to the precise location of amphitheatres.646 The fact that at Tarraco and Narbo, for example, these 619 Gayraud, Narbonne (above, note 20) 392, 395f.; Williamson (above, note 20) 182 . • \" Deininger, Provinziallandtage 105 with n. 2 and refs., 160; Robert, Gladiateurs (above, note 623) 273f., 282, 284; Le Glay (above, note 632) 20f. with n.

CXI a-b, CXII).667 The clearest evidence of all comes from Nimes, where bi-lingual inscriptions from the Augusteum (above, pp. 519, 523) attest the presence of a synod of Dionysiac artists which evident­ly had close relations with the sacred, thymelic Hadrianic synod (elL 12, 3232 = IG 14, 2495) at Naples (above, pp. 510, 556).

All of these different links and associations surely confirm that scenic games in honour of the emperor were performed at regular intervals in the adjacent theatre, which was itself an in­tegral part of the Augusteum. Quite apart from any direct connection with the worship of the emperor, theatres did of course further imperial aims by spreading the dominant Greco-Roman culture through presentations of various kinds-for example, the Querolus, which is known to have been pro­duced in Gaul-and the reprise of pieces from the Classical repertoire.668 In so doing they hastened the process of acculturation in a way which served as a useful adjunct to the ruler cult. (b) Banquets An idea common to both Greek and Latin cults was that the god might join in communion with worshippers eating together at a fraternal meal; the presence of the deity-manifestly in attendance at a lectisternium or sellisternium-contributed to feelings of joy and fellowship during a sacred epulum at which votaries consumed such parts of the sacrificial animal as had not been reserved for the god.669 Out of this practice developed the festive banquets attached to various sacred games, notably the ludi plebei (13th November) and ludi Romani (13th September).670 Senators had the privilege '\" In addition to the discussion of Etienne (above, note 292) see further Clavel-Leveque 2551, noting that at Glanum the theatre was opposite the imperial temple and that the theatres at Orange and Aries were closely linked with the imperial cult; Addenda, pp. 618f.

CD 39, 30, 4), whereas at the ludi Megalenses, for example, the votaries themselves partook of a communal meal. 671 Once the religious side of such ceremonies sank into the background, however, banquets were held not just at sacred festivals but on the anniversaries of temples, following the sacrifices of the great priestly colleges, on birthdays, at funerals and at triumphs. The whole people might take part, sitting at tables set up throughout the forum (Livy 39, 46, 3). Thus Gaius gave a feast for the senators with their wives and for the general populace to celebrate the dedication of the temple of Divus Augustus in A.D. 37 (CD 59, 7, If.), and we have a vivid account by Josephus of the feasting that marked the victorious entry of Vespasian into Rome (Bell. Iud. 7, 73). The end result was that sacrifices became more and more a pretext for a good meal, religious anniversaries simply an occasion for a free dinner when one might indulge oneself in over-eating and over-drinking.672 Communal meals that produced a spirit of association and reconciliation among the populace were clearly occasions that, like games in the amphitheatre or circus, could be put to the service of the regime. Hence the early attachment of banquets to imperial anniversaries such as the birthdays of the emperor or of members of his family. This development is attested by 13 B.C., when the praetor Iullus marked Augustus' birthday by entertaining both the emperor and the senate on the Capitol (CD 54, 26, 2), and may already have begun as early as 30 B.C.;673 in the Fasti Pighiani (A.D. 31-37),674 for instance, the natalis of Augustus on 23rd September is annotated epul(um).675 In the rest of Italy communal meals or the distribution of delicacies in connection with the ruler cult are well in evidence. For example, a fragmentary inscription from an unknown colony, perhaps Trebula, records that Livia's birthday was marked by games and a public banquet given to the decurions and Augustales by the seviri (elL 6, 29681: A.D. 108);676 the inscription of the altar of the Numen Augustum at Forum Clodii (above, p. 510) attests the distribution of honey-wine and pastries on the birthday of 671 Degrassi, Inserlt 13, 2, pp. 127, 437: Fasti Praenestini, 4th April; cf. pp. 289, 297: Menologium Rusticum Colotianum/Vallense, Sept.

In the municipalities largesse of this kind depended upon private munificence, which explains why the giving of epulae or strationes was among the benefactions expected of imperial priests and priestesses and particularly the Augustales.677 This is brought out by an inscription from Petelia recording a legacy to the city by the patron of the Augustales, the interest from which will pay for furniture for use at public banquets given by members of the college; in addition they are given a vineyard for the provision of wine on these occasions (CIL 10, 114). A similar legacy to the Augustales at Aquileia seems to bequeath urban and country estates along with sixty casks of wine (CIL 5, 985). Presumably these donations will also have been put to good use at the private celebrations of the college.678 Such at any rate seems to be the case with an inventory of gifts to a college at Ostia (above, p. 539) that includes tables, benches, stools, candelabra and various cooking utensils-evidently intended for their private banquets. That these will have marked official, imperial anniversaries as well as the personal anniversaries of club members is extremely likely (A Ep ig , 1940, no. 62).679 In the Eastern provinces banquets are likewise a familiar feature of the ceremonies of the imperial cult. 680 Feasting commonly took place near the imperial temple, as at Ancyra, but gymnasia too were often the scene of com­munal meals held in celebration of imperial occasions, notably the dies imperii and natalis of the emperor and the birthdays of other members of the imperial house or of Roma.681 Thus an inscription of the provincial council of Asia found at Hypaepa shows the choir of Asia celebrating the birthday of Tiberius with hymns and sacrifices and holding banquets (/GRR 4, 1608c), and meals and presents of money and wine are recorded on the island of Syros in connection with Commodus' birthday (/G 12, 5, 663: A.D. 183). We have seen that the festivities at Apollinopolis Heptakomia on Hadrian's accession included inter alia a banquet (above, p. 583), while at Pergamum eating and drinking in common figure largely in the celebration of the imperial mysteries by the imperial choir (above, pp. 573f., cf. 562, 567); on some occasions vari-677 Duthoy, \"\"Augustales\" (above, note 620) 1302f.; cf.

IG 12, Suppl. 124) and of imperial priests in particular. Once again, then, it is hard to avoid concluding that the religious side of sacrifices became overshadowed by the feasting that accompanied them.683 To turn to the Western empire, finally, here too banquets attached to the ruler cult are relatively well attested. In Spain a scattering of inscriptions record that the local flamen684 or flaminica685 has provided an epulum, and to these traces can be added a considerable number of examples elsewhere, notably in the provinces of Roman Africa.686 We have seen that in the first year of the joint reign of Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus the birthday of Marcus Aurelius was celebrated at Nemausus by a banquet and other liberalities (elL 12, 5905; above, pp. 497, 578; PI. LXXXVII b). For a literary description of such an event in Tingis we can turn to the opening passage of the Acta Marcelli: In civitate Tingitana procurante Fortunato praeside, advenit natalis imperatoris. Denique cum omnes in conviviis epularentur ... (l: A. Recension M).687 Such celebrations in Roman Africa are precisely what Tertullian denounces as incitements to riotous and licentious behaviour: Grande videlicet officium, focos et toros in publicum educere, vicatim epulari, civitatem tabernae habitu abolefacere, vino lutum cogere catervatim cursitare ad iniurias, ad impudentias, ad libidinis illecebras (Apolog. 35, 2).688 That a similar picture held true of other parts of the western empire can hardly be doubted despite the lack of explicit information. The interests of the regime clearly called for imperial anniversaries to be occasions for enjoyment, memorable for their feasting as for their blood sports, races or gymnastic displays.

Nevertheless, despite the hypothetical nature of much of the discussion, a general outline does begin to emerge, one that can be proposed with caution and reserve, yet not without a degree of confidence. We have seen reason to believe that both the provincial and the municipal worship of the Roman emperor was based upon an official calendar applicable with local variations throughout the empire; the 3rd of January in particular with its vows on behalf of the emperor must have been a day of ecumenical significance. On high feasts, particularly on the natalis of the reigning emperor, rites were no doubt celebrated on a more elaborate scale than was normally the case. First and foremost the provincial or municipal priest will have offered sacrifice, in all probability a victim, the recipient being determined by the character of the cult in its particular form or specialization. Wine and incense may also have been distributed to the townsfolk to enable them to perform private acts of devotion, conceivably wearing wreaths. At Lugdunum, Narbo and, presumably, other major centres elsewhere portable images of the emperor, perhaps annointed, clothed and decked with flowers, might be carried in procession (with candles and hymns?) from their lodging­place in the temple or elsewhere to the amphitheatre or the theatre, there to receive sacrifice and view the games or spectacle proper to a great occasion. Finally, when the images had been escorted back to the temple on completion of the games, the celebrations will have culminated in feasting and enjoyment. Processions with images may well have been a limited phenomenon but the inscriptions and papyri confirm that games and banquets were a staple appurtenance of major festivals of the imperial cult throughout the empire­particularly special occasions such as the accession of a new ruler. Such folk festivals must nevertheless have been limited in number and one would presume that on minor anniversaries, that is the majority of days observed throughout the year, the proceedings were restricted to rites conducted by the imperial priest at the associated temple or altar. Expense being an item, ceremonies must on most occasions have been restricted to simple supplica­tions of incense or wine, which had little or no impact on the community at large. On the other hand the cult of the emperor's likeness, whether by groups or individuals, may well have had a wider vogue than one would guess from the meagre traces it has left behind. On imperial days in particular it is possi­ble that rites were performed publicly before it, say in the theatre, the forum, the porticoes of temples or at the crossroads of vici, as well as at special shrines, in the club-houses of colleges, or even in private homes.

Such in profile appear to have been the principal characteristics of the liturgy and ceremonial of the imperial worship in the Western provinces, evidently patterned in careful detail upon the rites appropriate to the tradi­tional cults of Roman religion.689 No doubt future evidence, as it steadily accrues, will allow one to confirm or modify this tentative reconstruction to the extent that the ascertainable facts dictate. In conclusion attention might be drawn to a papyrus from Elephantine preserving the official day-book of the local governor (O\"'tpct't7j)'oc;) Aurelius Leontes (P.

The description of the temple with the carved reliefs on its doors is clearly related to the shrine of Apollo on the Palatine (see Addenda, p. 619), but the earlier verses may be cited as a poetic foreshadowing of what could be expected at a centre of the imperial cult in the Latin provinces. in medio mihi Caesar erit templumque tenebit. illi victor ego et Ty rio conspectus in ostro centum quadriiugos agitabo ad Jl umina currus. cuncta mihi, Alpheum Iinquens lucosque Molorchi, cursibus et crudo decernet Graecia caestu. ipse caput tonsae Ji liis ornatus olivae dona Jeram. iam nunc sollemnis ducere pompas ad delubra iuvat caesosque videre iu vencos, vel scaena ut versis discedat Jrontibus utque purpurea intexti tollant aulaea Britanni.

DATED INSCRIPTIONS AND THE FERIALE DURANUM* On the view taken by the editors, the Feriale Duranum is the solitary sur­viving example of a calendar of festivals valid for all military units throughout the Roman empire: the papyrus preserves \"a standard festival list for the army, simply one representative of a type issued to every camp and gar­rison.\" I In that case it was presumably sent to every detachment down to the level of cohort at least, given that it was found in the possession of the cohors XX Palmyrenorum stationed at Dura. The date of the preserved copy is set by internal evidence within the reign of Severus Alexander, possibly between A.D. 225 and 227, but the more important debate centres on the question of when the calendar was first drawn up. The circumstance that the papyrus was recovered from a room (W13) of the Temple of Artemis Azzanathkona, which evidently served as a repository for the auxiliary records, shows that it is a sur­vival, possibly an outdated version; while the traditional character of the festivals, some of which go back to the Republican period, has led to the sup­position that its origins go back to the early principate.2 Several features of the text tell in favour of the view that what we have is in fact a Severan redac­tion of an Augustan regulation. Certainly the jeriale was not compiled with Dura in mind, for it bears no particular relation to local conditions at a distant outpost of empire nor does it register local gods of Dura or for that matter any deities appropriate to troops drawn from Palmyra. On the contrary, only Roman gods and Roman festivals are listed along with a wide selection of anniversaries commemorating the occasions of the reigning emperor, the divi and the imperial women. By far the likeliest possibility, then, is that thejeriale dates to the time when Augustus was bent both on standardizing the various features of military service and on reviving the practices of traditional Roman religion.

The fact nevertheless remains that this interpretation is no more than a hypothesis; so far at least no comparable document has appeared that would definitely confirm the classification of the feria/e as a standard calendar in empire-wide usage rather than an isolated roster of festivals peculiar to a single unit. Not surprisingly, therefore, the interpretation of the editors has been challenged from time to time, most recently by R. MacMullen, who observes that nothing goes to show that a uniform calendar was in force for the single province of Syria or even the whole station at Dura. As he correctly emphasizes, the Palmyrene cohort worshipped their own gods when off duty: their religious practices, that is, had no relation whatsoever to an antique register of Roman festivals appropriate to Roman citizens in Rome and Italy two or three centuries earlier. 3 The same point can be confirmed elsewhere. Inscriptions set up privately by military personnel in Britain, for example, clearly show that troops followed very much their own fancies in religious matters and that, with the possible exception of dedications to Dea Roma or Roma Aeterna (below, p. 596), these bear no obvious relation to a list of festivals comparable to the Feriale Duranum.4 More particularly, Britain has not yet produced a single military dedication to a deified emperor or emperors whereas anniversaries of the divi or the divae amount to no less than twenty­one of the forty-one entries in the official list. S In contrast military dedications in Britain tend to focus upon the living emperor, though here again the epigraphical record is at variance with the traditional form of cult prescribed in the feria/e. Only a single inscription records a dedication to the imperial genius (RIB 915); the vast majority of military inscriptions testify to the wor­ship of the numen Augusti or the collective numina Augustorum, a term which appears to have included the numina of both living and deified emperors.6 The important point here is to draw a clear distinction between the practices of soldiers acting in a private capacity-these are what the inscriptions largely reflect-and the corporate rites celebrated by troops at headquarters on vari­ous occasions throughout the liturgical year. Private and public observances are separate categories that need not show any obvious interaction. The fact , R. MacMullen, Paganism in the Roman Empire, New Haven, 1981, 110; cf.

On the convincing interpretation of T. Pekary this shows the tribune Iulius Terentius (his name is clearly recorded on the fresco) accom­panied by Roman soldiers and making a very Roman offering of incense before imperial statues, perhaps those of Pupienus, Balbinus and Gordian III. 10 So, too, elsewhere. Evidence can be assembled which, directly or indirectly, suggests that similar provisions to those in the Feriale Duranum were in fact observed in various parts of the Roman Empire. While individual traces are too few to serve as a basis for inference in themselves, their cumulative impact is to build up an overall picture that goes far to confirming the standard nature of the feria/e, even in the absence of a second copy. One obvious fact hardly deserves mention. The cult acts prescribed in the calendar call for supplications of wine and incense or more rarely sacrifice of an ox or cow in celebration of a particular festival or anniversary. Evidence for the performance of such rites is of course perishable and therefore irrecoverable but what one might hope to find is a reflection or recollection of a particular rite that chances to survive because it was painted on a wall or carved in stone. We have one such instance at Corbridge, where the decorative sculptures from a third-century military headquarters have been interpreted by Richmond as referring to the festival of the Rosaliae, when the signa were garlanded with chaplets of roses. II As it happens, this particular festival is prescribed in the feria/e: Col. II, II. 8,14.1 2 Testimony of a similar nature is provided by a series of altars found at Maryport, where they were dedicated to Iuppiter Optimus Maximus by resident , On Romanization and the purpose of theferiale see Nock (above, note I) 203-208 (= Essays 749-754); Helgeland (above, note I) 1487; Gilliam (above, note 2) 184-1 86. , Nock, O.c. 200-202 (= Essays 747-749); Helgeland, o.c. 1496-1500. , Nock, ibid. ; R.

CXIII a). '3 The altars were found buried on the edge of the parade-ground and may be compared with similar relicts from Birdoswald on Hadrian's Wall (RIB 1874-1 896). The occasion to which these relate is not entirely certain but it was most likely the annual renewal of the soldiers' oath of allegiance, a ceremony which was originally scheduled on 1st January (Tac., Hist. 1, 55) but, on the evidence of the jeria/e, then moved at some stage later than A.D. 69 to 3rd January: Col. 1, 2-6. The climax of the ritual was the ceremonial erection of a new altar overlooking the parade ground and the solemn interment of the obsolete altar from the previous year. 14 To these can be added a dedication to Dea Roma from High Rochester (RIB 1270; PI. CXIII b), where the dup/icarii of a troop of scouts stationed at Bremenium have set up an altar in fulfilment of their vow on the actual birthday of Rome-n(atali) eius-scheduled in the jeria/e on 21st April: Col. II, 1.5. One might compare similar military altars to Roma Aeterna from the Maryport district (RIB 812, 840), also three third-century sculptured stones from Corbridge which were used as building ballast in a roadway constructed in A.D. 369 and may have come originally from a pedi­ment and a panel in a dismantled shrine to Dea Roma. I s It is difficult to explain these traces except as a reflection of the festival celebrations laid down in the official calendar; certainly local troops at Bremenium and elsewhere were not homesick for Rome. Rather, the prescription emphasized a per­sonification of Eternal Rome that would have made a powerful impression upon troops who observed the anniversary, presumably with the appointed sacrifice of a victim and the feasting which that entailed. As Helgeland notes, a Roman camp on the frontier was regarded as a city and a religious microcosm of Rome, the archetype for all military camps.'6 Lastly, a well-known series of dedications unmistakably attests an order to troops that they should follow the instructions of the oracle of Apollo of Claros: dis deabusque secundum interpretationem oraculi C/ari Apollinis (or variant).'7 What is of key significance here is that copies of the inscription Il L.

This particular text thus confirms that orders, issued centrally from Rome, could be sent to troops in di fferent parts of the Roman world, a fact which strongly supports the possibility that the Feriale Duranum could indeed by a standard directive, issued and applicable to troops generally. Evidence of a more indirect kind is provided by military inscriptions which bear a particular date that happens to coincide with one of the festivals listed in the Dura calendar.'8 While none of these is conclusive in itself, they collectively present a composite pattern of actions taken by troops in different parts of the world on the occasion of important imperial and other anniver­saries. In other words they suggest that the activities recorded stem from acquaintance with or observance of anniversaries prescribed in copies of the same document. For the sake of clarity the inscriptions are presented in the sequence of the calendar which they seem to echo, with multiple examples listed in chronological order wherever possible. Excluded are dated records of remote relevance to the corresponding festival in the calendar, also inscrip­tions dated on fixed days (Kalends, Ides, Nones) unless the possibility exists that such a day was also the occasion of an imperial festival. Conversely the list includes several which give the dates of festivals that were conceivably scheduled in the missing portion of the jeriaie. Where the precise date of a festival, which was evidently listed in the calendar, is uncertain, it is clearly impossible to argue a link with a particular dated inscription, even though a surviving text might in fact reflect the occasion in question. A similar dif­ficulty occurs with imperial festivals which may be echoed in military inscrip­tions but had fallen out of the calendar by the time of the copy which has been preserved at Dura.

THE AUGUSTALES AND THE IMPERIAL CULT A phenomenon widely attested in the western provinces of the Roman empire is the presence of local municipal colleges called variously magistri Augustales, Augustales and seviri Augustales.' These were largely composed of freedmen, though ingenui occur in numerous towns, and to judge from their nomenclature, social status, composition and activities developed on the model of the magistri that are found among emigre Italian negotiatores on Delos after ca. 150 B.C., and at a wide range of centres in Italy, especially in Campania. Such organizations called themselves after a particular deity­magistri Mercuriales, Martiales and so on-but, in addition to religious activities, notably the erection of statues or the cura of altars and temples, gave games and supported public works. In some cases it seems clear that an existing organisation such as the magistri Herculanei undertook the cult of the emperor; they then style themselves magistri Herculanei et Augustales or simply Herculanei Augustales, Augustales Mercuriales. But already in the Augustan period one finds new organizations of magistri Augustales, soon abbreviated to Augustales, which were founded independently and specifically concerned with the cult of the emperor. With the spread of the politically more significant ruler cult these soon eclipsed the older organisa­tions of magistri. In some cases, markedly in middle and north Italy, they evidently copied the six-man organization of local municipal seviri, the func­tion of whom lay entirely outside the religious sphere.2 Hence the name seviri Augustales, though it is possible this sometimes means that the same individual served both as Augustalis and as municipal sevir. The name Augustalis makes it perfectly clear that organizations of this nature served the cult of the emperor; one may compare the later titles sevir Tiberianus, Claudialis, Neroniensis, Fiavialis, Nervialis. 3 What form their I R.

Two comments by the scholiasts on Horace, Sat. 2, 3, 281 are germane but at first sight offer little help: lusserat enim Augustus in compitis deos Penates constitui, ut studiosius co/­erentur. Erant autem libertini sacerdotes, qui Augusta/es dicebantur (Pseudo-Acron). Ab Augusto [enimJ Lares, id est dii domestici, in compitis positi sunt, et libertini sacerdotes dati qui Augusta/es sunt adpellati (Porphyrion). Their statements clearly associate the Augustales with the cult of the Lares but are in error on two scores. It was neither the Oi Penates nor the domestic Lares that Augustus established at the crossroads; what he did was to set his own genius between the existing Lares Compitales. Furthermore both the iconographic and the epigraphic evidence confirm that the cult at Rome was put in the hands of the vicorum magistri with their slave ministri.4 Never­theless it will become clear that behind the confusions of the scholiasts may lie significant testimony to the religious functions of the Augustales, here called sacerdotes. Further evidence is provided by the inscription of the Ara Numinis Augusti at Narbo (elL 12, 4333 =ILS 112), which records the cult paid to the Numen Augusti by a six-man board; evidently the rites were still in force under the Antonines, the period of the presumed copy that has survived. S This organiza­tion is either one closely modelled on the Augustales and similar bodies or, on the closely reasoned arguments of P. Kneissl,6 that of the Augustales them­selves; in which case the text could be considered the foundation charter of the seviri Augustales at Narbo. A number of points tally closely: the social niveau and organization of the board; its pre-occupation with the ruler cult; the distribution of wine and incense to the people, an activity in keeping with the social dimension of the Augustales. Even the combination of three freedmen with three equites Romani a plebe can be paralleled in the mixed groups of ingenui and Iibertini found elsewhere, especially in the early prin­cipate (above, p. 609), though Premerstein noted that the numerous seviri Augustales otherwise attested at the town seem to be exclusively freedmen. 7 Whichever interpretation is correct, the text throws light, directly or indirectly, on the religious activities of the Augustales; in particular it • A.

But should one go on to conclude that a principal preoccupation of the Augustales in general was to pay cult to the Numen Augusti? Such is the inference drawn by Kneissl, who would enlist this testimony in support of Duthoy's view that the Augustales paid cult to the genius of the emperor or to the Numen Augusti in line with the original policy of Augustus, who sought to avoid direct personal cult in Rome or Italy during his lifetime.8 Duthoy mentions in passing the Narbo inscription but lays more emphasis on one from Aquincum: numini Aug. et I genio imp. Caes. T. Ael. I Hadr. Antonini coil leg. Augustal. impen I dis suis fecerunt praelfect. c. lui. Crescente I I.p.d.d.d. (CIL 3, 3487: A.D. 138). Two epigraphical texts are very little evidence on which to base so sweeping a generalization but it so happens that direct evidence for the cultual practice of the Augustales is otherwise non­existent: that is, if one is to exclude the fifty or so inscriptions that seem to relate to their activities in a private rather than a corporate capacity. 9 The main objection to Duthoy's thesis is that the general development of the ruler cult tells against it. The emperor's genius did not receive a public cult, for example on the part of the Arvals, before the reign of Nero,lo and is sparsely attested throughout the West under the principate. II The cult of the Numen Augusti, on the other hand, fi rst appears at the very end of Augustus' life and is attested in a small number of instances under Tiberiusl2 but then seems to drop out of sight until re-emerging in the Antonine period I J and, much more abundantly, under the Severi and later. The obvious reason for this is that none of Augustus' immediate successors possessed the prestige and charisma to justify a cult that came close to outright deification in life. One would have thought it unlikely, then, that the principal concern of the Augustales should have been with specializations of the ruler cult that were uncommon, if not actually defunct, for so long. A further objection at Narbo is that there are so few days when the board actually performed rites, only two imperial anniversaries, the kalends of January, and a single local occasion (which could of course have varied from one centre to another).

On the whole, therefore, it seems preferable to hold that the Narbo text attests a specially-created board, modelled on organizations already in existence elsewhere, and that the seviri at Narbo were appointed to serve a special cult based on the altar of the Numen Augusti at Narbo, where the people had a special relationship to Augustus. They are not the Augustales but to the extent that they parallel the magistri Augustales, Augustales, and seviri Augustales, here or elsewhere, their activities are helpful for present purposes in illustrating the forms of cult that could be expected of such organizations. As we have seen, the name Augustalis must surely indicate, at least originally, a cult that centered on Augustus, just as the terms Tiberianus, Claudialis and so on focus on the person of the current emperor; 14 presumably later Augustales are concerned with the reigning emperor of the time, cf. f/amen Augusti, sacerdos Romae et Augusti.15 But what one finds by the Antonine period, if not earlier, is that the Augustales could also serve in close association with or even among the cultores domus divinae. 16 This develop­ment is confirmed by inscriptions attesting the combination sevir et Aug(ustalis) s(ocius) c(ultor) d(omus) d(ivinae) (CIL 5, 6518: Novaria); cf. seviri August(ales) socii cultores domus divinae (CIL 5, 6657 = ILS 6741a: Vercellae). There is a single example at Novaria of sevir inter cultores domus divinae (CIL Suppl. Ital. 1, 883 = ILS 6741) but elsewhere the offices are simply in apposition-either in the plural form: se]viri August[al(es) cu]lt(ores) domus divin[ae (CIL 5, 6648: Vercellae) or, more commonly, in the singular, especially at Milan and its environs; sevir Aug(ustalis) c(ultor) d(omus) d(ivinae) (CIL 5, 5465, 5749, 5844, 8922; AEpig, 1974, no. 345); cf. sevir sen(ior) et Aug(ustalis) c(ultor) d(omus) d(ivinae) (CIL 5, 6349: Laus). Premerstein held that this association with the cultores domus di vinae coin­cides with the period when new formulations based on the name of the current emperor cease to be coined. However that may be, it seems clear that the cult paid by the Augustales originally focused on the person of the living emperor but later came to include other members of the domus imperatoria. If so, these groups of freedmen can be seen as parallel associations to the cultores \" See in particular CIL 3, 1835 recording a sevir Augustalis, Flavialis, Titialis, Nervialis at Narona: cf. CIL 3, 1768. Mommsen (C. p. 291) took this to mean that the cult offered by the local Augustales included all the divi; cf. id., Hermes I (1866), 59, n. I. It seems preferable to hold that C. Vibius Ingenus pater boastfully gives himself all the successive titles that the office has carried at Narona. \" Cf. Premerstein (above, note 7) 854f. \" Duthoy (above, note I) (1978) 1301.

What one would expect, then, is that cult paid by the Augustales, at least within their own organizations, will have approximated to that of the cultores and indeed of most colleges. IS This would call for supplications of incense and wine, perhaps occasionally animal sacrifices, on imperial or other anniver­saries,19 very much on the lines of the ritual prescribed at Narbo. All analogy suggests that such rites will have been performed at the interior altar within the club schola and before the imperial images. It is very possible too that on dies solemnes the images may have been carried in procession, perhaps in combination with municipal rites. This is suggested by the fact that the shrines of the Augustales are located as a rule near the forum, within easy reach of the municipal altar or temple of the imperial cult. Certainly, the general char­acter of the cult offered by the Augustales in a private capacity is in keeping with such a hypothesis20 and nothing excludes the possibility of corporate cult offered on occasion under other forms, as evidenced by the dedication to the imperial numen and the emperor's genius at Aquincum, for example 17 Cf. a confraternity at Volubilis that calls itself variously cultores domus Aug.

L. Berni Brizio holds that the reference can only be to the deceased grandsons of Augustus, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, and that placing their likenesses within the schola is consistent with the steps taken to secure the quasi-deification of the two after their deaths.23 Comparison with similar references,24 in conjunction with a date just less than a month before the death of Augustus, suggests that the Caesares may rather be Augustus and Tiberius.25 The inscription includes a list, apparently of newly admitted members, and the three individuals that are named at the beginning of the text are charged with a special cura. In view of the freedman membership of the group, the known presence of Augustales at Trebula Suffenas, 26�and strong evidence of interest in the imperial house27 there is good reason to believe that this is a body of Augustales, despite the omission of the term in the surviving text. In that case the inscription throws important light on the rites performed by the Augustales and corroborates the proposed model of the cult forms that can be inferred from the practices of similar organizations. The possibility nevertheless remains that, in some municipalities at least, \" For an Antonine relief showing sacrifice by two seviri to Jupiter Optimus Maximus, there­fore perhaps for the safety of the emperor, see 1.

The expansion Cae)sarum nevertheless looks very probable."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"THE AUGUSTALES AND THE IMPERIAL CULT 615 members of the Augustales also performed the same functions as the magistri vicorum at Rome.28 On the negative side there is no epigraphical trace of the magistri vicorum at Pompeii, for example, which certainly had a cult of the Lares Augusti at the crossroads:29 here the Augustales are well in evidence,30 whereas they are entirely absent from Rome. It is striking, too, that like the magistri the municipal Augustales seem to have taken up office on 1st August (elL 10, 112 = lLS 6467). Positive evidence includes a minist(er) Lar(um) Aug(ustorum) et Aug(ustalis) Merc(urialis) at Grumentum (elL 10, 205; cf. Ep hEp 8, 269, where et is omitted); in this instance the older organization of the Mercuriales has taken over the cult of Augustus and one of their number is minister of the Lares Augusti. 31 With this may be compared an example at Ostia of a sevir Augustalis and quinquennalis of the college who is immunis Larum A ug(ustorum) , that is (presumably) exempt from the duties connected with the cult of the Lares Augusti (elL 14, 367: A.D. 182). Similarly the title sevir magister Larum A ugustalis is attested in several inscriptions at Tarraco.32 Dedications to the Lares Augustj33 record private rather than corporate activity by members of these associations and are conse­quently inadmissable as evidence (see above, p. 611) but attention may be called, for example, to the gift of Lares Augusti by three Herculanei Augustales to the cultores domus divinae et Fortunae Augustae at Tibur (elL 14, 3561), also to the munificence of two Augustales at Luceria, where they have paved forty feet of road ad vicum Laris at their own expense (elL 9, 808). The supposition that the Augustales superintended the cult of the Lares Augusti in some municipalities34 would thus clarify the testimony of the scholiasts (above, p. 207), who have simply confused a municipal arrange­ment with that at Rome. It would further follow that the veiled figures shown sacrificing to the Lares Augusti on the Ptuj reliefs (above, p. 503) may in fact be Augustales; the name is at any rate attested locally (elL 3, 4107).

As Premerstein showed, some Augustales are attested before 7 B.C.,35 the effec­tive date when Augustus put the cult at the Compita in the hands of the magistri vicorum. At other centres inscriptions show that the Augustales did not have charge of such a cult, Spoletium for instance (elL II, 4815 = ILS 6638). Generalizations are always risky and a piecemeal analysis clearly provides the soundest approach, but it seems safe to say that within their own organiza­tions the magistri Augustales, Augustales and seviri Augustales will have offered the emperor a \"Bilderdienst' in the form of sacrificial rites performed before the imperial image(s) on important anniversaries; in addition they may in some towns, if not many, have supervised the cult of the Lares Augusti at the crossroads. The fact that nothing in all this was particularly remarkable no doubt explains why their cult activities have left so few traces. By far the most significant feature of these organizations was that membership catered to the ambition of the freedman class, whose wealth could then be put to the use of the community in supporting largesse or public works. 36 It is hardly sur­prising, therefore, if the social and economic dimensions of such activities are what are customarily reflected in their inscriptions or on sepulchral reliefs (cf. PI. LXXXVII b).37 \" Above, note 7, ibid. , citing CIL II, 3200: Nepet, 12 B.C. (= ILS 89). \" Scott Ryberg, Rites 98-103; D.

The surviving text mentions various structures including an aedicula (?within the aedes) , also gold imagines, evidently of the emperor. Despite the lacunae, the involvement of the Augustales looks consistent with the proposed outline of their own cult activities."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"III. ADDENDA TO VOLUME II, 1 pp. 477, note 15; 478f., notes 22f.; 480, note 31; 5l3, note 242; 551, note 465; 564, note 541 An inscription found in 1967 near the village of Kemerarasl in north­western Lycia is of the greatest significance for the various documents it records relating to the foundation of a local, pentaeteric contest and accompa­nying festival by C. Iulius Demosthenes, a citizen of nearby ancient Oenoanda. The text, which holds numerous points of interest for comparative purposes, has now been published with detailed commentary by M. Worrle, Stadt und Fest im kaiserzeitlichen Kleinasien: Studien zu einer agonistischen Stiftung aus Oenoanda (Vestigia 39), Munich, 1988. Like the festival of the Caesarea at Gytheum (above, pp. 552, 564, 565f.), Demosthenes' themis is a thymelic contest but remarkable for its unusual length (over three weeks) and for the range of competitions offered: trumpeters, heralds, encomiographers, poets, aulos-players with chorus, comic and tragic actors, citharodes, a com­petition oLa 7tcXv'twv for winners irrespective of category, mimes, shows etc. (II. 38-46; cf. Worrle 227ff.). A concluding, supplementary athletic contest, which is confined to citizens, seems to lie outside the main competitions since no prizes are given (I. 46), while a lamp-race for teams of boys clearly belongs to the ritual of the festival (II. 65-67). What is of special significance in the present context is the close association of the event with the emperor and the imperial cult and the resulting correspondance of various details of ritual with features one observes elsewhere in the Greek world. The following are of special note: The agonothete is to wear a crown with portraits of Hadrian and Apollo very much like the crowns worn by provincial imperial priests in the Greek East: II. 52f., 56f. (above, p. 477; W. 187f.). His dress shall be of purple, again like the costume of provincial priests: I. 57 (above, p. 480; W. pp. 192f.). 'Acts of piety' to Hadrian and Apollo are to be performed by the agonothete at the ceremony marking New Year's Day, which is called Sebaste: II. 57f. (above, pp. 494f., 5l3f.; W. pp. 193f.). The agonothete shall take part in the procession along with other officials-on the model of processions at local and provincial festivals else­where: 1. 58 (above, pp. 550-553; W. 193f.). He is to have a seat of honour (7tPOEOPEUELV) at the theatrical shows dressed in his official robes, a feature we have noted at Narbo: I. 59 (above, p. 478f., cf. PI. LXXXVI a, b; W. p. 195)."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"618 APPENDICES Ten Sebastophoroi, appointed by the agonothete and wearing white garments and crowns of celery, are to carry the emperor images and the image of the ancestral god Apollo, very much as porters carried emperor images and statues of Artemis at Ephesus or images of Divus Augustus, Livia and Tiberius at Gytheum: II . 6lf. (above, pp. 551, 564, 565; W. 216-219). They are also to bear in procession a silver-plated altar (funded by Demosthenes and bearing an appropriate i'1scription: cf. II. 53f.). Presumably sacrifice was made on the altar when the procession was completed, much as at Gytheum (above, II. cc. ; W. 190-192). A cortege consisting of the agonothete and other officials is to proceed through the theatre and sacrifice together on the days of the festival, again very much as at Gytheum: II. 68f. We are given extensive details of the various sacrifices to be made by the different officials, including the agonothete and the municipal imperial priest and priestess; the victim is in every case an ox: II. 69-80 (cf. above, p. 513f.). Interestingly, sacrificial animals from other cities, at whatever times they are sent in, are to be lead also through the theatre and publicly announced, and the agonothete is to send confirmation of their participation in the sacrifice to the cities that had been responsible for contributing them: II. 83-87 (W. pp. 198ff.). Past agonothetes are to join with the present incumbent in having special seats at the festival (auV1tPO&OPU&LII), again very much as at Narbo: l. 87 (above, p. 479; W. pp. 183, 198). Taken as a whole, this new inscription adds substantially to our overall pic­ture of local Greek competitions and festivals and their link with the cult of the emperor. Mutatis mutandis it also contributes to the picture that can be built up by analogy of corresponding liturgy and ceremonial in the Latin West.
