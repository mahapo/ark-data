The line between the scientific and the magical was blurred. According to popular lore, magicians of the Middle Ages were trained in the art of magic in “magician schools” located in various metropolitan areas, such as Naples, Athens, and Toledo. It was common knowledge that magic was learned and that cities had schools designed to teach the dark arts. The Spanish city of Toledo, for example, was so renowned for its magic training schools that “the art of Toledo” was synonymous with “the art of magic.” Until Benedek Láng’s work on Unlocked Books, little had been known about the place of magic outside these major cities. A principal aim of Unlocked Books is to situate the role of central Europe as a center for the study of magic.magic i n historyU n l o c k e d B o o k sp e n ns t a t ep r e s sL á n gLáng helps chart for us how the thinkers of that day—clerics, courtiers, and university masters—included in their libraries not only scientific and religious treatises but also texts related to the field of learned magic. These texts were all enlisted to solve life’s questions, whether they related to the outcome of an illness or the meaning of lines on one’s palm. Texts summoned angels or transmitted the recipe for a magic potion. Láng gathers magical texts that could have been used by practitioners in late fifteenth-century central Europe.B e n e d e k L á n g is Assistant Professor in the Department of Philosophy and History of Science, Budapest University of Technology and Economics.jacket illustration: Planetary figures from the Picatrix, BJ 793, fol. 190r.

Looking atthe long list of the names, one might think that this work is more of a communaleffort than the fruit of individual re search. Indeed, the following book was born—more than most scholarly achievements—as a result of collective work, withoutimplying, of course, that any conscious plagiarism has been committed.I am first of all indebted to Gábor Klaniczay, not only because he was the super-visor of the doctoral dissertation on which this book was based, but also becauseit was in his seminars where I first read in the secondary literature that medievalmagicians (whoever they were) actually produced written material. I am no lessgrateful to Paolo Lucentini, who introduced me to the complicated tradition ofHermetic texts, letting me consult his library and giving me access to the unpub-lished material of the “Hermes Latinus” editorial project. My third guide in thelabyrinth of medieval sources was Charles Burnett from the Warburg Institute,who supplied me with a great number of unpublished articles and microfilms.My chapters on the notion of magic and the Central European use of the arsnotoria—a medieval genre of ritual magic—owe enormous debts to Claire Fanger,who made an exciting discovery in my own field, a “trouvaille” that I hope I wouldhave made, had I been more thorough in my research (see my chapter on the royalprayer book of King Wladislas). Much scholarly advice was offered by RichardKieckhefer, who also provided me with helpful instructions on how to restructurethe book to make it accessible to an audience that extends beyond a modest circleof specialists. No less helpful and useful were the kind suggestions and correctionsof György Endre Szőnyi, who helped me over a number of years, by reading andimproving my writings and by introducing me to the vast secondary literature per-taining to Renaissance magic.Ae approach to magical sources shown in my work rests on the conviction thatno meaningful account can be given on learned magic unless we situate it in theframework of the history of science of that period. Ais conviction is the fruit oflong and regular consultations with the philosopher Márta Fehér, who provided mewith philosophical training that has always had a profound influence on my work.A00 Front:Sample.qxd 10/10/2008 8:51 AM Page ix"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"I would also like to express my gratitude to those doctoral candidates whoshared their research with me. Ae help we gave one another with common prob-lems and with finding manuscripts and secondary literature usually proved as use-ful as reading the oeuvre of the great scholars. I especially profited from readingthe theses of Sophie Page and Frank Klaassen, both of whom set an example ofhow to write on the medieval use and readership of magical texts. My present workowes a great debt to their studies as far as its structure and terminology are con-cerned. I also benefited from the inspiring conversations with Isabelle Draelants,Håkan Håkansson, David Juste, David Porreca, and Julien Véronèse.My overview would be much less “Central European” if the doctoral studentsof the Central European University (CEU) had not helped me in various ways.Ae most appreciated contribution came from Jolanta Szpilewska, who tirelesslyrendered the Polish secondary literature accessible and readable to me. I greatlyenjoyed the scholarly and friendly discussions with Renata Mikołajczyk, whoseresearch on the medieval doctors of Kraków was a model for my own work.Furthermore, I would like to thank my friend Péter Banyó, who helped me inso many ways that I cannot even start recording them here, and to further alumniof the Medieval Studies Department of the CEU, Ottó Gecser, Petra Mutlová,Dóra Bobory, Marek Klaty, and Gábor Kiss Farkas, all of whom have participatedin one way or another in my research. I also thank the staff of the Medieval StudiesDepartment. I owe special thanks to Réka Benczes, Andrew Lewis, and MatthewSuff, the lectors of this book, who have a particular gift for raising a text with afew changes to a considerably higher level of elegance.I am no less indebted to and grateful for the kindness and intellectual help ofKrzysztof Bracha, Anna Kozlowska, Mieczysław Markowski, Grażyna Rosińska, andHanna Zaremska in Poland; Milena Bartlová in the Czech Republic; ChristopherLigota, William Ryan, and Jo Trapp in London; Paul Kunitzsch in Munich; Ger-linde Huber-Rebenich in Jena; and Vittoria Perrone Compagni in Florence, whogave me in valuable advice through personal discussions or e-mail.A medievalist who wants to see his sources and develop his research in well-supplied libraries has to be either wealthy or very fortunate when applying forgrants.

Aere it states that Faustus, “whenhe was a student in Kraków, studied magic, as this art was at the time widely usedand publicly practiced there.”2Ais statement appears in Manlius’s book as part ofcommon knowledge, and it soon became in fact generally accepted. Another, slightlylater source relying heavily on Manlius, the Dies caniculares by Simon Maiolus, re -peats the claims that a Johannes Faustus studied magic in Kraków, where—accord-ing to Maiolus—it was publicly taught.3Ae general approval of a proposition, however, is not necessarily related to itstruth value. Ais sentence, for example, has a number of untrue implications. Itasserts, first of all, that the man who was to become the archetype of human deal-ings with the devil did exist and was called Johannes. Now, philological investiga-tions have established that the historical Faustus did indeed exist, but he was notcalled Johannes at all, but rather Georgius. Second, Manlius says that he studied inKraków—at least for a time. Again, this seems to be false, for there is no historicalI: I S  M S1.

Ais was where the Western world had been confronted with—andstarted to translate—the Arabic scientific corpus. Ais cultural import included atleast as much astrology, talismanic magic, and alchemy as mathematics, philoso-phy, optics, and physics. It is not surprising, therefore, that a whole tradition oftopoihad presented Toledo as an international center of the black arts, divination,and demonic magic, ever since the first scientific and magical texts were translated.6Ais conviction was so strong that the “notory art,” described in a widespread textof medieval ritual magic, the Ars notoria, was also called the “art of Toledo.”7Togive another example: a source pertaining to the same genre of learned magic, theLiber iuratus Honorii (Sworn Book of Honorius)purports to report a general synodof magicians arriving from three cities: Naples, Athens, and Toledo. Even as lateas the sixteenth century, François Rabelais wrote of a “faculté diabologique” func-tioning in Toledo.8However, why Kraków had a reputation as a center of magic is far from being so2I4.

While it might have been a commonplace in Manlius’s times that Krakówhad once been a center for magical studies, it is far from evident today what thesource of this conviction was. Did Kraków really possess a particularly magicalmilieu?My book has succeeded if, by its end, its readers feel that they have received suf-ficient information to answer this question. More precisely, I will focus on notonly Kraków but all of Central Europe, as seen through contemporary manu-scripts. Even though I cannot promise to identify a public school for the black artsfunctioning in the medieval territories of Poland, Hungary, or Bohemia—as magicwas never instructed officially and openly in any medieval school or university inEurope—a large number of instructive cases will compensate the reader for thefrustration caused by the lack of a department of necromancy: among them, a kingsummoning angels and peering into a crystal ball in order to learn the hiddenintentions of his people and the secrets of the material world; an engineer design-ing terrifying siege-guns and powerful catapults, whose military manual containsthe first medieval depiction of the Archimedes’ screw, but also various magicalmethods to occupy castles (one of which requires the fat of a hanged man); an exe-cutioner and torturer who starts collecting handbooks on magic and reeducateshimself as a magician; an alchemist of a royal court who finds the text of the Chris-tian Mass the most convenient model for describing the secret process of trans-mutation; and a medical doctor educated in the best schools of Montpellier, onwhose advice princes and peasants collected snakes and frogs with their bare handsand consumed them for medicinal purposes. Nevertheless, the main focus will bethe university masters whose libraries include—besides a large number of scientifictreatises—some surprising items pertaining to the field of learned magic: hand-written notes scattered in the blank pages of the codices on how to learn about theoutcome of various enterprises or illnesses; human hands drawn with great careindicating the main lines of fate for the purposes of palmistry; texts of naturalmagic which include various recipes using animal substances used for magical pur-poses; the earliest surviving version of the great handbook of talismans and ritualmagic, the Picatrix,which is in fact the only copy containing the illustrations ofthe half-animal half-human creatures described in the text; and finally the Liberrunarum( The Book of Runes) containing the names of angels transcribed in Scan -dinavian runes, which bear special powers and are supposed to be engraved on talis -mans in order to activate their benign or malign influence. Aus, although Faustusprobably never studied magic in Kraków, Prague, or Buda, it is possible to com-pile a bibliography of the texts he would have used if he had.For the sake of clarity, the texts under investigation will be classified into cer-tain categories. Ae first comprises the relatively innocent practices of natural magic,which operate through the secret correspondences of the world and the hiddenI S  M S300 Front:Sample.qxd 10/10/2008 8:51 AM Page 3"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"properties of objects. Aen come the more manipulative methods of image (inother words, talismanic or celestial) magic, which work with names and figuresengraved in specific stones and metals. Ae last is that of ritual (or ceremonial) magic,which relies on the invocation of angels and demons, and which is somewhere onthe borderline between magic and religion. Aese categories, with which I willoperate throughout my study, will be carefully defined in the Chapter 1. For themoment, it is enough to emphasize that although the threefold distinction of nat-ural, image, and ritual magic is a helpful framework for the classification of medi -eval magical texts,9the borders between these subcategories will not always be clear.It is much harder to account for the inclusion of two further categories, the div-inatory material (including geomancy and palmistry) and the alchemical sources.Aese arts share with magic the characteristic of being frequently condemned; nev-ertheless, they were not necessarily seen as branches of magic, and—as it will beargued in due course—were condemned for reasons different from those mar-shaled against talismanic and ritual magic. But as the borderlines in the field ofmagic are fuzzy, I tended to be inclusive rather than exclusive. Aerefore, divina-tion is also incorporated in this study, considering the fact that texts on divinationoften traveled together with texts on natural and image magic. Evidence of alchemy,as provided by a couple of Central European sources, will also be presented, firstbecause it seems to supplement the picture on the readership of magic in that era,and second because I—like most modern readers—am somewhat imprisoned inthe modern categorization of magic, which undeniably includes alchemy. It isimportant to always bear in mind that the modern and medieval categories ofmagic, science, and religion do not necessarily coincide.No similar admission is made in this book regarding purely astrological texts,even though nowadays astrology might also seem to be a part of magic. It is of pri-mary importance to remember that there is no necessary link between the twofields. Astrology was taught in certain universities,10magic never, or at least not aspart of the curriculum. Even though certain elements of astrology provoked serious4I9. When applying this distinction, I generally follow the structure of two recently defended doc-toral dissertations: Frank Klaassen’s “Religion, Science, and the Transformations of Magic: Manu-scripts of Magic, 1300–1600” (Ph.D. diss., Department of History, University of Toronto, 1999)—its published version is forthcoming in the Magic in History series by the Pennsylvania State Uni-versity Press, and Sophie Page’s “Magic at St. Augustine’s, Canterbury, in the Late Middle Ages”(Ph.D. diss., Warburg Institute, University of London, 2000). It is worth adding, however, that FrancesAmelia Yates has already applied a somewhat similar threefold typology to her Renaissance mate rial:natural-celestial-ritual magic. See, for example, Frances Yates, Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tra-dition(London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1964).10. On general overviews concerning the role of astrology (interrelated with astronomy and med-icine) in university curricula and the medieval philosophy of nature, see Richard Lemay, “Ae Teachingof Astronomy in Medieval Universities, Principally at Paris in the Fourteenth Century,” Manuscripta19 (1975): 197–217, and Lemay, “Ae True Place of Astrology in Medieval Science and Philosophy: 00 Front:Sample.qxd 10/10/2008 8:51 AM Page 4"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"theological debates, such as the concept of the Great Year (which implied thatearthly history is fundamentally periodical, which contradicted the teaching of thechurch)11and the effect of the stars on particular events and on human free will,12general astrological principles in a more innocent form were relatively well acceptedas a part of medical training, and as functional elements of natural philosophy.13Ae idea that the incorruptible, perfect, and divine celestial regions exercise aninfluence over the corruptible earthly bodies was supported not only by the argu-ments of Aristotle and Ptolemy—the two main authorities of antiquity in the fieldof celestial sciences—but also by empirical evidence. Celestial causal superiority isevident in the influence of the sun on temperature, rain, and the cycle of seasons;or the power of the moon on the ebb and flow of the tides; not to mention that asophisticated system had been worked out relating the sections of the zodiac, theplanets, and the various parts of the human body. In addition, experience—under-stood in the medieval sense of the word—suggested that celestial virtues influ-enced metals (think of the behavior of the magnet, which was a frequent subjectin the discussions of natural philosophy), and the association of planets with met-als (the sun with gold, the moon with silver, and so on) was regarded as valid ingeneral, not just in alchemical considerations.Second, astrology is excluded for regional reasons: although the readers andscribes of magical texts in Central Europe were often concerned with the celestialsciences, and are to be found among the circle of university professors, students ofastrology, and courtly astrologers, this correlation does not work in the other direc-tion: the majority of these astrologers were not involved in magic. In brief, astrologywas a fully fledged discipline in its own right in the fifteenth century, but magic wasnever officially studied or practiced, and if certain philosophers (who will be intro-duced in the next chapter) proved tolerant of some of its forms, magical texts neverentered the university curriculum. Aerefore, I will frequently touch upon the issueof astrology while looking at the use and the codicological context of magical works,but I will not, however, include astrological sources in the textual analysis.I S  M S5Towards a Definition,” in Astrology, Science and Society: Historical Essays,ed.

Ae focus of the research is pre-dominantly on Latin texts. Ais is not due to the complete lack of vernacularsources. Although no such examples have been found in Hungarian, the fifteenthcentury no doubt witnessed the translation of divinatory and natural magic textsinto German and Czech. Again, these sources will not be ignored completely; how-ever, proper research into the vernacular texts of learned magic (finding the Latinoriginal, identifying the additional elements coming from local sources, and so on)would require a separate study.14Nevertheless, the presentation and close reading of basic texts form only the firstobjective of my investigations. Once the examples of magic have been collected,and their codicological contexts examined (to determine which texts travel alonein the manuscript tradition, and which ones occur together with other genres), themain concern of the book is to explore and characterize the circle of people whowrote, copied, collected, used, and read these manuscripts to the extent that theevidence will permit. Ae historian’s work is then to identify which texts travel inde-pendently in the codices, and—provided two or more magical texts find them-selves bound together regularly—what characteristics of theirs made the collectorbelieve that they belong together.15While only in some exceptional cases are the specific owners known, it is oftenpossible to identify the social stratum to which they belonged. Richard Kieckhe-fer calls the owners and users of manuscripts of magic the “clerical underworld”;16others attribute this practice generally to the lower clergy.17William Eamon speaksabout the rise of an “intellectual proletariat, a group composed of university-educated laymen who had failed to find useful or permanent employment.”18An“underworld of learning,” clerics, medical doctors, and members of universities6I14.

Aeir curiosity in experimental and occult studies, theireducation, profession, background, convictions, and wishes can be inferred fromthe books they collected. And then, reconstructing the university careers, training,interests, and libraries of the compilers and owners of the given texts helps usunderstand the role of the magical books that lined their shelves and the place ofmagical beliefs in their conceptual schemes.Similar questions are to be raised in a Central European context. What is knownabout the people who wrote, copied, and used magical texts? Did Central Europehave its own magicians, or was the presence of sources on magic nothing more thanthe result of simple incidental curiosity of well-known intellectuals at the univer-sities and the courts? In other words, in what stratum of the social hierarchy shouldone look for the readers: among the anonymous clerics and ordinary masters, orin the group of highly respected scholars? Did the scribes add their own inven-tions to the field of magic, or did they merely follow Western practices? Did theybelong to the local “clerical underworld”? (And on a more general level: what arethe boundaries of this underworld?) Furthermore, were the compilers and the col-lectors educated at Polish, Bohemian, or Hungarian universities? Did they possesssuch handbooks for personal use or out of pure curiosity?19Aroughout this study, “Central Europe” will designate the geographical andpolitical entity that lies beyond the limits of the first expansion of the Western bar-barian peoples, the Carolingian Empire, but which did not belong under the directsphere of Byzantine influence, and could therefore join Western Europe around.. 1000.

Strictly speaking, the territory covered here should bereferred to as “East-Central Europe,” since what is usually understood as “CentralEurope” is supposed to include Austria, Italy, and—partially at least—Germany aswell. In the following, however, for the sake of simplicity and brevity, I will refrainfrom operating with such difficult expressions.

Eastern Germany, Austria, and Italyare historically and politically closely related to Hungary, Bohemia, and Poland.Culturally, these countries formed an organic unity; Polish, Bohemian, and Hun-garian students frequently studied in German and Italian universities, while Germanand Italian humanists and professors often came to Central European institutions.Apparently, political boundaries did not present any obstacle. However, the sourcematerials provided by Italy, Austria, and Germany are substantially different bothin quantity and quality. In the present study, I intend to rely on a well-defined anddelimited Polish, Bohemian, and Hungarian sample. It follows that I will not pre-sent a systematic survey of the magical manuscripts of Vienna23or Erfurt,24for ex -ample, because such an attempt would go beyond the scope of a single book, butwhenever the traces lead to the West, I intend to follow them naturally, and I willinclude occasionally material from beyond the western limits of my area. Ae reasonfor this is that Central European universities were founded at much the same timeand in much the same way as the universities of the German-language area (Heidel -berg, Cologne, Leipzig, and Erfurt), and that political boundaries did not stop thewandering students of the fifteenth century. Aeir “homeland”—the university—was an international formation,25and they traveled freely, without paying muchattention to national divisions, carrying their books, that is, my sources, with them.Having thus acquainted ourselves with the idea of Central Europe, it is still notquite clear why this region should be treated separately as far as the texts of learnedmagic are concerned. In other words: what is so distinctive in this region withrespect to the field of magic?Two answers can be given to this question. Ae first is related to a tendencyalready pointed out by the scholarship dealing with the diffusion of Arabic magi-cal texts in Western Europe: copies of magical texts “found an attentive audienceonly after about ... 1400in Central Europe.”26Put differently, the answers to thequestions posed in this book can be found in fifteenth-century manuscripts. Aesecond characteristic feature of this area is a relative tolerance shown toward textsI S  M S923. Ae exclusion of Vienna may seem particularly arbitrary, since the University of Vienna wasfounded roughly the same time as the universities of Prague, Kraków, and Pécs, and Vienna itselflies almost two hundred kilometers east of Prague, and thus must be considered Central European.My reasons, I repeat, are merely functional; Vienna alone possesses more extensive manuscript hold-ings than all the libraries where I carried out systematic searches.24. A fruitful field of research might be based on the twenty treatises on magic in the fifteenth-century library of Erfurt. See David Pingree, “Ae Diffusion of Arabic Magical Texts in WesternEurope,” in La diffusione delle scienze Islamiche nel Medio Evo Europeo,ed. B. Scarcia Amoretti (Rome:Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, 1987), 58 n. 1.25. On the metaphor, see Klaniczay, “Late Medieval Central European Universities.”26.

Ais tolerance—which I definitely do not want to overstate—is to be understood by Western European standards. While in Paris, statutes andtheological declarations condemning various forms and practices of magic wereissued one after the other in the later Middle Ages, in Central Europe it was appar-ently without the slightest sign of fear of prosecution that university students andprofessors kept magical items in their libraries.Because the two phenomena are closely related, they can be investigated in par-allel. In order to understand why magical texts arrived in Central Europe withsuch a considerable delay, it is necessary to observe the particular traits of the intel-lectual history of the area. Roughly speaking, the use and copying of magical textspresupposes the presence of a certain learned culture, and the emergence of a suffi-cient number of learned scribes, compilers, and book collectors to sustain such aculture requires an intellectual milieu that only universities, monasteries, and royalor episcopal courts can provide.Ae date suggested as the arrival of the magical texts in Central Europe coin-cides with the time of the reorganization of the University of Kraków (originallyfounded in 1364). After the death of its founder, King Casimir the Great, the uni-versity fell into a state of decline that ended only thanks to a new stimulus receivedfrom Queen Jadwiga, in the last years of the fourteenth century. Ais renewal openedup a golden age in the life of the university, in which, in the first half of the fif-teenth century, two private chairs were founded especially for the studies of astron-omy and astrology. Aese chairs yielded many new astronomical and astrologicalworks, and provided the history of science with several generations of astronomers,while supplying various clerical and secular courts of Central Europe with thor-oughly trained astrologers. Because of this flourishing, the University of Krakówbecame an international center of astronomy as well as of astrology, and it had anextensive relationship with other centers in Bologna, Paris, Vienna, and the royalcourt of Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary. Probably without exaggeration, thecontemporaries merely noted that “Kraków is stuffed with astrologers.”27Ae Prague milieu, in contrast, was somewhat less astrologically oriented. Onthe one hand, interest in alchemy was already present in Bohemia two hundredyears before its late sixteenth-century apogee at the time of Emperor Rudolf II.Ais interest or even practice of the science of alchemy was probably stronger thana pure curiosity on the part of a confined intellectual circle, because we have analchemical work dating from the middle of the fifteenth century written in thevernacular, that is, in Czech.28On the other hand, natural and image magic, as10I27. “Cracovia astrologis referta est.” Aleksander Birkenmajer, Études d’histoire des sciences en Pologne,Studia Copernicana 4 (Wrocław: Zakład Narodowy im.

Apart from the university, the monasticcontext must have also provided fertile ground for an interest in magic: a number ofmagical texts have come to us from the Augustinian libraries of Třeboň and Brno.Finally, the southernmost intellectual center of the time (no less interested inthe celestial sciences) was the court of King Matthias of Hungary. King Matthias’senthusiasm for Renaissance Neoplatonic philosophy, his fascination with Hermet -ism, reflected also by the books of his famous Corvinian Library, his enthusiasticcorrespondence with Marsilio Ficino, the other Italian humanists staying and work-ing in his court, are described by contemporary sources and researched by modernstudies. According to Antonio Bonfini, one of the learned Italians staying in theroyal household, members of the court were deeply concerned with Neoplaton-ism, and the names of Plato, Pseudo-Dionysus the Areopagite, Hermes Trisme gistos,Zoroaster, Orpheus, Plotinus, and Pythagoras were mentioned in philosophicaldiscussions on a day-to-day basis.29It is also often emphasized that King Matthiasinvited great experts of astronomy and astrology, such as the Pole Martin Bylicaof Olkusz, the Königsberg-born Johannes Regiomontanus, and perhaps even theItalian Galeotto Marzio to the newly founded university in Pozsony (present-dayBratislava), the so-called Academia Istropolitana.30Astrology was taken so seri-ously that Matthias consulted his court astrologer before campaigns and had thehoroscope of his new university prepared.Ais was the institutional milieu that served as fruitful soil, not only for thedevelopment of the celestial sciences, but also for a deep interest in magic. Aeintellectual centers listed so far copied and produced a considerable number of textsbelonging to each branch of magic. In various courts of kings, archbishops, bishops,dukes, and princes, as well as in the newly founded Central European universities,a new type of intellectual found himself in a peculiar and convenient place for sat-isfying his interest and getting involved in research.Yet is it possible to claim that Central Europe was the birthplace of a “center ofmagical studies”?31Anticipating one of the negative conclusions of my research (partly in order toavoid hasty misinterpretations), let me emphasize here that there is no reason tosuppose that magic played any genuine role in late medieval Kraków, Prague, orI S  M S1129.

Interest in various forms of magic did not constitute a unified or coherentmovement either inside or outside the courtly and university life. If we take theextant manuscripts as starting points, and plot their locations on a map of Europe,we will see that Central Europe—especially Kraków—deserves special attention.By pursuing these lines further, we can then address the general issues of who pro-duced and preserved these sources. On the other hand, however, if we proceed inthe opposite direction, and wish to provide a general picture of the intellectual activ-ity of the region, we can talk about a strong, consistent concern in astrology, butthis claim cannot be extended to the question of magic, examples of which willremain relatively scattered and isolated.Ae succeeding chapters follow the former of the two procedures. I start witha careful study of the sources themselves, presenting the main genres of magicalliterature one by one, then describe the extent to which the categories are repre-sented in the surviving Central European source material, and examine whetherthe texts are mere imports from the Western manuscript tradition, or whether onecan find local products, examples of “original” texts. Ae codicological context ofthe particular magical texts will also be questioned as veritable sources: the positionof certain kinds of magic in the framework of learning can be better understoodon the basis of the tracts that occur or travel together with them. In addition, anexcursusdeparting from the main body of the argumentation of the book will focuson the visual material contained in the sources.Part Two concentrates more on the human and institutional elements. Twochapters will be devoted to the role that magic played in monastic milieus androyal courts, while a third will survey the patterns of the founding of universitiesand go deeper into the secrets of the personal libraries of university professors andstudents. Special attention will be paid in two excursus,first to the question of thecriminalization of practice of magic, and the dangers awaiting those who did notmake a secret of their interest in the occult, and second to the transformation ofthe figure of the magician, as demonstrated by a historical example closely relatedto the Kraków material. Here is where we return to the person of Faustus.Ae present work can expect basically two kinds of readers: the first has a goodknowledge of the sources and genres of magic, but is supposedly less acquaintedwith the history of local universities and royal courts.

It has beenfrequently pointed out that “magic,” when applied in secondary literature, expressesthe preconceptions, the ethnocentric projections, and the historical distortions ofthe researcher, rather than the content of what it purports to signify.1Defining magic, however, is not a simple task. Modern experts on the history ofmagic have emphasized various components of medieval magical practices. Someof them gave general and necessarily true definitions with which one can only agree.;e fairly inclusive description for example, given by Lynn ;orndike, the classicauthority of the field early in his career, can hardly function as a definition: “Magicappears as a human art or group of arts employing varied materials in varied rites,often fantastic, to work a great variety of marvelous results, which offer man a re -lease from his physical, social, and intellectual limitations, not by the imaginativeand sentimental methods of music, melodrama, and romance, nor by religion’s1.

Richard Kieckhefer, for example,argues that in the Middle Ages magic was considered as a “rationally explicable prac-tice with objective rationality.”4Similarly, William Eamon looks for an inner qual-ity of the practice of magic, namely that it serves to understand and manipulatenature through its secret correspondences beyond the abilities of ordinary humans,5while Bert Hansen speaks about technology and a special kind of instrumentalityemerging in magical practices.6It is worth adding that on the north tran sept foreportal of Chartres Cathedral, magic is portrayed as one of the four mechanical arts.7William Ryan, although not intending to give the perfect definition, emphasizesan external, legal point of view: the disapproved (or even criminalized) characterof the practice of magic.8To cut this introduction short, I quote William Ryan again, who, in turn, appliesto the question of magic what Gábor Klaniczay wrote on the attempts at present-ing a general theory of witchcraft: “;e wide array of theoretical explanatory toolsand comparative sets stand in puzzling contrast to the ease with which each general18P O: M2.

In any given historical period it is the widercircle of the learned community that determines what counts as a religious ritual,a scientific endeavor, or a magical act.10Nonetheless, while theoretically oriented studies have become fully aware thatthe term “magic” itself is deeply problematical, a strong consensus seems to haveemerged on why it should be kept as a useful research category.11One helpful wayof getting out of the labyrinth while keeping this word in the scholarly terminol-ogy is to describe specific cases of magical practice (or, to be more precise, genresof the literature of magic), instead of defining sharply what is and what is not magic.Giving up the hope of finding one common constituent in every instance of magic,we can recognize a complicated network of various resemblances that—as Wittgen -stein would say—“overlap and criss-cross,” linking the particular examples. ;eseexamples are without sharp borders and form a family that we can call, for the sakeof convenience, magic.12In consequence, I will approach magic through its various textual manifes -tations. Instead of trying to work these forms into modern definitions, my pointof departure will rather be a few medieval attempts at understanding, defining,classifying, and eventually condemning magic (authors such as Richard of Four-nival, William of Auvergne, and the author of the great catalog of astrological andtalismanic literature, the Speculum astronomiae [Mirror of the Celestial Sciences]will be considered here).

If the approach was condemna-tory, magic was seen as a perversion of religion, one that also operated with ritualtools, but one that, instead of abiding by the true aims of religion, tended to turnto demonic forces. ;e second tradition associated magical practice with science,and often presented it as an alternative, or mistaken (even bastard) science, empha-sizing—in contrast to demonic intervention—the occult powers, natural forces,universal sympathies, and secret correspondences that it utilizes.13Advocates of the first approach usually went back to Augustine’s theory, whichwas indeed the first attempt at a sophisticated and comprehensive model of mag-ical action.14In this model, magic appears in the context of the theory of signs asan act of communication with demonic powers (while Christian rituals are also actsof communication, but only with the divine sphere). ;us, all superstitious prac-tices, including divination and astrology, presuppose an implicit or explicit pactwith demons. ;is is valid even in the case where the operator—deceived by thedemons—is not aware of the pact, because this pact is secured by the magical lan-guage, signs, and rituals he has applied. For a reader of Augustine, basically everyinstance of magic—however innocent it may seem—seems to be ultimately asso-ciated with idolatry and demonolatry, and becomes consequently harmful. Augus-tine was well aware of the common features and elements of the rituals of magicand those of religion (prayers, sacraments, and the cult of relics). It is true—hewrote—that what magicians do is often similar to what saints do: the differencelies not in the visible realm but in what is secretly implied. While saints communi -cate with divine powers for the greater good, magicians seek their own, selfish ends.;is categorical rejection of a wide range of magical practices as ultimatelydemonic prevailed in the early Middle Ages, and remained a strong conviction evenafter new theories challenged its monopolistic position. A vast debate developedin the theological and scientific discourse on the nature and power of demons, onhow they can be compelled, and on the dangers threatening the invoker.

Johannes of Franco-fordia, a professor of theology at the University of Heidelberg (between 1404 and1440), added an interesting point to the subject when treating the question whetherdemons can be compelled with the help of characters, figures, or words.16He pointedout that the demon—thanks to his extensive knowledge in the field of herbs,stones, and other elements of the world—is the best doctor.17A native of Polandand a former student of Padua, the thirteenth-century Witelo, who is otherwiseknown as the author of a comprehensive work on optics, also arrived at a note-worthy conclusion.18In his long and philosophical letter on the nature of demons,Witelo put forward the idea that demons are intermediary creatures between humanbeings and the angels, that they are mortal but very long-lived, and that they havean exceptional knowledge of the world and possess superhuman power.19;ere isD  C2115.

Instead, the consensus of theologians echoed the famous1398 conclusions issued by the theology faculty of the University of Paris: it is nottrue that good, benign, and omniscient demons exist, nor is it true that demons canbe bound by magic arts: they just pretend to be compelled.21A few years later, JeanGerson (1363–1429), the chancellor of the University of Paris and a man of greatlearning, arrived at the same conclusions in his systematic study on magic: demonscannot be compelled by magic arts; they only pretend that they are compelled sothat they will be adored like gods, and will be able to deceive their invokers.22While the demonic understanding of magic had a privileged position in theearly Middle Ages because of the twelfth- and thirteenth-century impact of thetransmission of Arabic magical and divinatory works, the condemnations becamemore differentiated, and the classifications more elaborated.23;is was the age whenthe second, scientific interpretation of magic emerged. As a result, every magicaltext had the opportunity to pretend to be less demonic than it was in reality, andthey could consequently find toleration in some calm and unnoticed area of thecomplicated typologies.

As time progressed, there was a growing ten-dency to differentiate, categorize, and tolerate; as a rule, however, we can say thatthe Christian reception of magical literature was more complicated than a simpleimport of the theory of Al-Kindi. ;omas Aquinas (1225–74), for example, in hisletter to an unknown Italian soldier, admits the licit function of certain astrolog-ical causality and accepts the occult power of some earthly objects (such as therhubarb, the magnet, or the relics of saints), but ascribes the effect of images andformulas to the activity of demons.28Aquinas’s impact is undeniable. However, if we want to observe the receptionof the magical works in a more detailed way, and if we want to set up a thoroughtaxon omy of these texts, the best possible method is not to turn to the great the-ologians, because even though they expressed their opinion on magical texts, theyrarely had firsthand knowledge about them. Instead, we should rather rely on theworks of those—perhaps lesser known—authors who had the opportunity to studythe texts carefully, and had consequently a direct acquaintance with the sources theywrote about.L  F?

Here he reports a number ofexperiments relying on the hidden power and secret correspondences of herbs,stones, and animals, all belonging to the field of natural magic, which do notimply demonic intervention, or rely on curiosity. (We should bear in mind thatcuriosity for the medieval theologian is not identical with the positive and apprais-able attitude of the scientist who questions the natural world, it is rather viewedas a vain desire to accumulate knowledge of things that are not necessarily meantto be known.)35He concedes that not every branch of magic is as innocent as nat-ural magic. Divinations performed with the help of demons and judicial astrology,which purports to predict particular events falling under free will are to be con-demned, as Augustine insisted, because they do not function according to the orderof nature.36;e bishop is also very critical of magical operations that make use the powerof images, figures, and characters.37;ose, for instance, who attribute virtue to theimages and try to expel scorpions with the image of a scorpion are mistaken. ;esemethods belong to what he calls magisterium imaginum,38and what we will callimage magic.39William condemns image magic because, in his opinion, images and talismanshave no power in spiritual matters or over earthly objects. Under this category, helists a number of texts attributed to Hermes, Belenus, and Toz Graecus in whatamounts to a bibliography of the medieval Hermetic corpus. ;is was first men-tion in the Christian West for some of the titles in his list.40;e numerous andscattered references he provided proved to be particularly useful for posterity: basedon this inventory it became possible to reconstruct the library of Hermetic worksavailable in the thirteenth century. ;ese works were translated in the twelfth cen-tury, some from Hellenistic Greek texts, but the majority from ninth-century Ara-bic sources on talismanic magic.

As ithas been recently pointed out, the author was most probably consulting the excep-tionally rich book collection of Richard of Fournival (ca. 1201–ca. 1260), astron -omer, physician, mathematician, poet, book collector, and the chancellor of thecathedral of Amiens. ;e catalog of his library has come to us from the pen ofRichard himself. In the Biblionomia (again a bibliography!), Richards guides hisreader through his collection, displaying his thematically arranged books. ;oughnot explicitly, and certainly without the intention of its author, the Biblionomiahappens to be a classification of science and magic, just like the Speculum.Readingit, we can imagine accompanying the owner, who shows us his books classifiedinto the categories of philosophy, rhetoric, arithmetic, medicine, law, and theology.However, at a certain point he brings the tour to an abrupt halt: he bars us fromhis collection of secret books, kept in a special section of his library. ;ese books,he explains, cannot be exposed to the public eye because of their “profundity”—a term probably meant to refer to their dangerous magical content. We can onlywonder what this dangerous content may have looked like, given that the Libervaccae( The Book of the Cow) for example—with all its recipes for generatingbees and cows one from another, for fecundating the latter in order to give birthto homunculi, for turning a man into the shape of a beast, and for other unusualexperiments45—was not off-limits; indeed, it was classified with the medical books.46Fortunately, modern philology has established that the secret book section inRichard of Fournival’s library was a primary source for the author of the Speculum,28P O: Mfound in Glenn Michael Edwards, “;e Liber Introductoriusof Michael Scot” (Ph.D. diss., Univer-sity of Southern California, 1978).

Although he was killed when his house was bombed in 1941, and his paperpartly destroyed, a copy of his transcription (partly in proof copy, partly typed, and partly hand-written) is preserved in the library of the Warburg Institute.45. From the extensive literature on the Liber vaccae,I have found the following particularly use-ful: David Pingree, “Plato’s Hermetic Book of the Cow,” in Il Neoplatonismo nel Rinascimento, ed.Pietro Prini (Rome: Istituto della Enciclopedia Italiana, 1993), 133–14; Pingree, “From Hermes toJābir and the Book of the Cow,” in Magic and the Classical Tradition, ed.

Ifwe took the author’s claim seriously, that he did “not have a perfect memory”48regarding this literature, we would be puzzled by the quantity and accuracy of thereferences. He classifies these works into the abominable and the detestable, onthe one hand, whose images derive their power from demonic influences, and theacceptable, on the other, whose images obtain their virtue solely from the celestialfigures. Nevertheless, the author declares—rather surprisingly and somewhat incon-sistently—that even the truly necromantic works should be preserved, not destroyed,until the time arrives when it will be useful to have them inspected. But even then,their inspectors should be wary of using them.49With the birth of modern philol-ogy this time has apparently arrived. Historians of science and scholars of magicfind it most useful to inspect that small portion of the “abominable” and “detest -able” magical texts which has not perished, and consequently the eleventh chap-ter of the Speculumcontaining their titles and descriptions enjoys today a nobleposition in every citation index of medieval studies.As it has been previously mentioned, the threefold distinction of this chaptertakes place within the category that is called magisterium imaginum by William ofAuvergne, scientia imaginumby the author of the Speculum,and image magicthroughout the present book. ;e abominable branch is considered such becauseit requires suffumigations (ritual burning of various essences, literally: from below)and invocations, and therefore cannot be anything but demonic. ;e second cat-egory—“somewhat less unsuitable, nevertheless detestable”—is only slightly better;it is “effected by means of inscribing characters which are to be exorcised by cer-tain names,” and regarding this practice “it is suspected that something lies underthe names of the unknown language, which might be against the honor of theCatholic faith.”50Much scholarly work has been done to find the reasons why—and according to what principles—the author differentiates between the two,rather similar categories. On the basis of their references to the talismanic texts,an attempt has been made to identify the first, abominable division with Hermeticmagic, and the detestable one with Solomonic magic, the texts of which are usu-ally attributed to the wise Solomon.51D  C2947.

It comprises the two famousbooks of talismanic magic that flirt openly with demonic help, the Liber prestigio-rum ( The Book of Talismans)52and the Liber lunae ( The Book of the Moon), aswell as a number of lesser known technical texts attributed to legendary authoritiessuch as Hermes or Belenus. Many of these sources are not explicitly demonic; theyjust give precise instructions on the preparation of talismans or magical rings. ;eseusually correspond to the seven planets, and they are supposed to be manufacturedout of the proper metal, by engraving the appropriate image in the correspondingmaterial, whether this material is the metal itself or an inlaid gem. Some of theHermetic texts, however, go deeper into the realms of demonic magic: suffumiga-tions and invocations to spirits are not entirely missing in the preparation processof certain planetary images, and these details may well account for the criticalapproach of the Speculum.While the Speculum astronomiae condemns a great number of talismanic texts,it also saves two items, and the tolerated texts may prove to be even more infor-mative about the author’s classificatory schemes than the ones condemned. Besidesthe abominable and detestable categories, there is a third one created precisely forthose images which do not require suffumigations, incantations, or the use of un -known words: their power is taken only from celestial signs.53;us, the author givesa certain leeway to natural talismans (a notion without any meaning for Williamof Auvergne), that is, to image magic relying on exclusively natural powers. ;isspace, however, is not too large: only two—albeit quite widely disseminated—textsfind refuge here.54;e first is the De imaginibus (On Images, or in a probably better translation,On Talismans) of ;ebit ben Corat in the translation of John of Seville. Its attri-bution to the historical ;ābit ibn Qurra, ninth-century scientist and philosopherof the city of Harran,55is still an unsettled issue. Even though two, rather different,Latin translations of the work have survived—the De imaginibus by John of Seville,30P O: M52.

Paolo Lucentini,Ilaria Parri, and Vittoria Perrone Compagni ( Turnhout: Brepols, 2003), 369–84.53. Weill-Parot devotes a considerable part of his book to proving that the notion of imago astro-nomica—which is the notion that becomes the differentia specificaseparating the last, relatively inno-cent, and licit category from the dangerous and illicit necromantic works—was created by the authorof the Speculum;see WP 27–219. See also Nicolas Weill-Parot, “Causalité astrale et ‘sciences desimages’ au Moyen Age: Éléments de réflexion,” Revue d’histoire des sciences 52 (1999): 205–40.54. For a detailed analysis of this category, see WP 62–83.55. I use the Latin form “;ebit ben Corat” when discussing the Latin texts attributed to thisArabic scientist, and the Arabic form “;ābit ibn Qurra,” when discussing the historical figure.01 Chapter 1:Sample.qxd 9/24/2008 11:17 AM Page 30"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"to be found in the natural category in the Speculum astronomiae,and the Liberprestigiorum by Adelard of Bath, with a considerably more demonic content, clas-sified in the first, abominable category—the Arabic original has not.56As the Latintext of De imaginibusstands now, it is a rather ambitious talismanic work. In itsintroductory paragraph, it refers to no lesser authority than Aristotle and claimsthat the “science of images” is higher and more precious than geometry and phi-losophy.57Following this statement, the author gives the procedures (under whatconstellation, with what words uttered) for preparing and using magical images,or statuettes. ;ese images serve rather common purposes within the genre of imagemagic: to drive away scorpions, to destroy a city, to find missing objects, to influ-ence a king, and to stimulate love or hatred between two persons. Indeed, there isno explicit reference to demons. ;e second tolerated text bears the rather similartitle Opus imaginum ( The Book of Talismans), and is falsely attributed to Ptolemy.Pseudo-Ptolemy’s talismans are described in a more elaborate way than those of;ebit, and arranged according to different principles, but they are otherwise verysimilar in their function and significance.58In this case, however, the author of theSpeculum gives his seal of approval more carefully; he considers it innocent for thetime being, but views it as virtually useless, and warns us that if there is any, thus farhidden necromantic (that is: demonic) detail in it, this text will also be intolerable.Finally, a few words on the impact of the classification of the eleventh chapter.It has been noted that the two talismanic works accepted (and, in the case of ;ebit’sDe imaginibus,excessively quoted) by the Speculumcan be found much more fre-quently than the condemned ones; they occur not only together but adjacent inseveral manuscripts.59On our part we can add to this list a partly astrological,partly magical handbook from Kraków, BJ 793, in which both texts occur (the Deimaginibus even twice)60without any of the condemned abominable or detestablebooks. Could it be that the fifteenth-century compiler of this codex (or the scribeof the manuscript from which this one was copied) included them because he re -spected the judgment of the Speculum astronomiae?It is true that the Speculum waswidely copied in Europe.

Let us take a closer look at two such examples.;e first, a short enigmatic treatise extant in a manuscript from Prague (whichis, however, not necessarily a Central European product)63resembles De legibus,De universo, and the Speculumin intent, but goes even further in tolerance.64;eauthor takes as the starting point of his argument the often quoted ninth premiseof the Centiloquium(Hundred Statements) attributed to Ptolemy: “;e images ofthe lower world are subjected to the images of the sky.” Numerous works werebased on these words—proceeds the author—which were falsely considered necro -mantic by their ignorant posterity, even though they contain the great secrets ofthe ancient philosophers.65Among these misinterpreted but valuable books, he lists32P O: Mchapters, copied in the thirteenth or fourteenth century (the year 1298 is mentioned), in a mathe-matical context; and BJ 2496, from the fifteenth century, in an astronomical-astrological context; thelatter manuscript also contains the Epistola de iudiciis astrorum of ;omas Aquinas.

At first sight it is an ordinary hand-book of an average student. However, inserted between the scientific treatises,Egidius copied many works of image magic as well,69and on one folio he even lefta booklist, which sheds some light on his interests. ;is list is unknown to us fromother sources, and it seems very likely that Egidius compiled it himself. It startswith a fourfold classification of the occult and “exceptive” arts into the divinatory,the necromantic, the magical, and the natural.70;is term, the ars exceptiva,wasintroduced in a basic text of ritual magic, the Ars notoria, and refers to the magi-cal arts.71Since the term is not used to mean anything else in medieval Latin, itsappearance in the Dresden text seems to indicate that Egidius knew something ofthe notory art.What is more exciting, however, is that after finishing with the four types ofdivination, the author proceeds to the other magical categories listed in the incipit,and introduces a number of book titles as belonging to nigromantia, magica,andnaturalia.;is list is a particularly rich collection of magical works, including oftenenigmatic titles.

It seems evident that he wasacquainted not only with the Ars notoria but also with the Speculum astronomiae.As we have seen, the Dresden text operates with four categories, but in the firstof these, consisting of the four kinds of divination, book titles are not mentioned.;e remaining three groups (magical, necromantic, and natural works) by and largecorrespond to the three (abominable, detestable, and natural) categories of theSpeculum.;e necromantic and magical groups include most of the rejected texts ofthe Speculum,following its attitude rather faithfully, but in the natural category thereis an important difference. In both cases two texts are called natural, the first ofwhich is ;ebit’s De imaginibus;however, the author of the Dresden text is not inter-ested in the other text, the Opus imaginum of Ptolemy, about which the author ofthe Speculum had already expressed his ambivalence. Instead, Egidius gives—as themost perfect among all books—a text unknown to the author of the Speculum forsimple chronological reasons, the great and famous handbook of magic, the Picatrix.While the author of the Dresden text follows the text of the Speculumrelativelyclosely, he occasionally gives titles that do not appear in his main source (such asthe Clavicula Salomonis and the Liber Semphoras,as well as, of course, the Picatrix),and indicates the content in cases when the Speculum gives only the incipit. ;ese34P O: M01 Chapter 1:Sample.qxd 9/24/2008 11:17 AM Page 34"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"signs imply that besides being acquainted with the text of the Speculum,he hadprobably also a direct knowledge about some of the books attributed to Solomon,Hermes, Muhammed, and ;ebit, and in all probability he knew the content ofthe Picatrix.It is also worth mentioning that there is one more major differencebetween the Speculumand the Dresden text: the latter does not show the slightestsign of condemning the books it lists. It admits that most of them are magical ornecromantic and contain demonic magic, but there is no reprobation in these lines.What William of Auvergne, the Speculum astronomiae,the Biblionomia,thePrague treatise, and the Dresden text have in common is that they show an expliciteffort to systematize and classify the literature of magic, and to find a convenientplace for those magical items that accompanied the huge scientific corpus offeredby the Greek and Arabic tradition. ;ese authors have a secure and firsthand knowl-edge of the magical texts, but apart from the authors of the Prague treatise and theDresden text, they abstain from legitimizing all what they have read. A growingtendency toward differentiating, categorizing, and tolerating certain kinds of magicis apparent, however. William of Auvergne accepts only natural magic, while re -jecting image magic and Hermetism. Richard of Fournival satisfies his curiositywith collecting magical works, but he does not make them accessible to the pub-lic, and he remains silent about their titles and content. ;e Speculum astronomiaeis no longer silent about the same sources, and it even accepts some of the leastdangerous examples of image magic. More than a hundred years later, the Praguemanuscript seems to accept even the hitherto rejected items, but avoids discussingthe most demonic ones, while the Dresden text, written probably by Egidius ofCorintia in 1488, approaches them in a completely neutral manner. If we trace aline from Augustine through the thirteenth-century authors to the late medievalclassifications and booklists, it seems reasonable to talk about an articulate ten-dency of “positivization” of magic,72as a result of which late medieval intellectualsD  C3572. See Claire Fanger’s discussion in Fanger and Klaassen, “Magic III”: “While ‘magic’ was usedas a term of opprobrium from antiquity, by the later middle ages it begins to be possible for intel-lectuals to argue in a limited fashion for the positive benefits of some types of theory and practicethat are connected to the idea of magic (though the word ‘magic’ might still be avoided by somewriters interested in praxis, and negative uses of the word continued as before). . . . It should betaken as axiomatic that in any era alongside any positivized view of magic there will be found neg-ative views, and that positive and negative views, varyingly configured, can coexist in the same timeperiod, the same social circles, and even in the same person. ;us in the early modern period, whenarguments for positivized forms of magic were more common than they had been before, the con-demnation of magic (as ‘maleficium’) was also harsher than it had been before. . . . In outlining the‘positivization’ of magic in the later middle ages, we will thus be describing the recasting of an oldproblem, not its elimination. If the voice of condemnation is often the loudest voice heard, the intel-lectual climate in the later middle ages nevertheless undergoes an alteration in its attitude to magicon a deeper level, recuperating from Arabic and Hebrew sources some of the bases on which the syn-theses of magic with philosophy and theology are constructed in the early modern period.”01 Chapter 1:Sample.qxd 9/24/2008 11:17 AM Page 35"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"could safely incorporate a growing portion of magical texts in the framework ofscience.T  T  M TTaking into consideration the overcharged connotations of the word “magic,” inthe following chapters we will try to stick to more neutral (or at least less burdened)expressions and categories, which were—with a single exception—established bymedieval authors.We will use the expression “natural magic” in a scientific sense of the word,close to William of Auvergne’s usage. ;e practices of this branch are based on theconviction that different parts of the world are in occult correspondence with eachother. ;us, through the secret relations between various items of nature (that is,celestial configurations, days of the week, parts of the day, parts of the human body,herbs, animals, metals, stones, gems, and so on), it becomes possible to learn abouttheir hidden but natural virtues. With a strong understanding of natural magic,one can even go further and use the correspondences to manipulate the objects ofthe world. ;is genre of magic finds its sources in the Greco-Roman tradition ofnotions of occult powers and processes in the natural order, its main ideas and com-ponents occur in medieval encyclopedias, works of natural philosophy and med-icine, lapidaries, bestiaries, books of marvels, books of secrets, and even weatherpredictions. ;e most widespread text of natural magic is the Experimenta(or Liberaggregationis) attributed to Albertus Magnus, which became the source of manyother texts belonging to this branch, such as the Experimentaof Nicholas of Polandand the Bellifortis of Conrad Kyeser, to name two Central European examples.As a rule, we can say that natural magic makes use of the natural power ofearthly entities rather than demonic forces. Since this understanding of magic isconnected with its “scientific” interpretation, sometimes—as expected—it is diffi-cult to decide whether a certain experiment belongs to the field of manifest pow-ers, that is, the area of natural philosophy and medicine, or falls into the domainof occult powers, that is, natural magic.Reading further into William of Auvergne and the Speculum astronomiae,wearrive at the world of talismans, that is, at image magic, which is situated halfwaybetween natural and demonic magic, and between tolerated and illicit practices.;e works devoted to magical images—as we have seen in the case of the De imag-inibus of ;ebit and the Opus imaginum of Ptolemy—apply magical characters,small statues, seals, numbers, combinations of letters, and strange circular and quad-rangular figures that were to be engraved on rings, metals, and gems under well-defined astrological circumstances.Interest in image magic is inseparable from natural philosophy and astrology;36P O: M01 Chapter 1:Sample.qxd 9/24/2008 11:17 AM Page 36"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"indeed, the chief—and usually rather short—texts on image magic are often in -serted in the space left free between treatises in these genres.73;e astrological ori-entation of this category is also underlined by its favorite attributions: ;ebit andPtolemy were famous authorities on the celestial sciences.But there was no consensus on the exclusively astrological orientation of imagemagic, and debates emerged about whether all talismans rely entirely on astrolog-ical principles and natural powers. ;e Speculum astronomiaewas certainly rightto distinguish several subclasses of this branch. Although procedures of image magicare usually not explicitly demonic, they often flirt with demonic forces and incor-porate suffumigations and invocations addressed to spirits—as is, for example,unambiguous in the De imaginibus of Belenus. Consequently, just as between sci-ence and natural magic, it is difficult to distinguish between image magic anddemonic magic (sometimes called necromancy), and indeed astrological images wereoccasionally called necromantic. ;ere are, however, a number of basic differencesbetween talismanic texts using spiritual help and handbooks containing invoca-tions to demons. One of them is the codicological context, which is rather infor-mative about the attitude of the scribes and collectors: as a rule, talismanic textsand demonic handbooks did not travel together.74A second reason to make a dis-tinction is internal: the degree of involvement of demons is certainly much greaterand more explicit in texts of demonic or ritual magic, and the methods of invok-ing and binding them are more elaborated, while texts of image magic may oftenpresent themselves plausibly as purely astrological works. ;ird, while the prereq-uisites for successful magical practice involve previous learning and scientific edu-cation in the case of image magic,75they involve ritual and religious activities indemonic and angelic magic, such as chastity, confession, periods of silence, fasting,and meditation.76In short, image magic and ritual magic are two distinct literarygenres.D  C3773.

Divination was understood as includinggeomancy, palmistry, name magic (onomancy), and the numerical and combina-torial practices contained in the books of fate. Since the main objective of thesetechniques was to foretell future events that are hidden but foreordained, one caneasily understand the unanimous rejection of divination by Latin authors, start-ing with Varro (ca. 116–ca. 27 ..) and Isidore of Seville, through the Speculumastronomiae until Johannes Hartlieb (ca. 1400–1468), who viewed its methods asa usurpation of divine prerogatives. While Varro and Isidore did not make mucheffort to distinguish the divinatory arts from magic, and became subsequentlyresponsible for a close association of the two fields, the canons of early medievalchurch councils, as well as several later medieval authors, such as Hugh of SaintVictor and ;omas Aquinas, treated them separately. However, they saw in bothof them the operation of demons, and consequently condemned their use.77Interestingly, alchemy is the art where Central Europe proved to be the mostoriginal. While texts belonging to other genres are usually imports from the West,alchemical texts are rather regional products and bring up interesting local issues.It is important to emphasize, nevertheless, that alchemy is not connected to nat-ural, image, or ritual magic with regard to its codicological context and readership;nor was it necessarily seen as a part of magic by the medieval authors (as it hasalready been mentioned): still I believe—and I hope to be able to prove—thatexcluding it from an overview of Central European magical texts would deprivethe final picture of one of its crucial elements.Up to this point we have been operating with categories that were partly or en -tirely constructed in medieval discourse. Conversely, the expression “ritual magic”—which is the focus of our last chapter on the genres of magic—is a modern prod-uct, and we will stick to it only for pragmatic reasons.

It is no wonder that a whole debate developed on the issue of the iden-tity of spirits between the magicians, who were experts in the invocations, andtheir opponents, who carefully analyzed the conjuring handbooks before eventu-ally burning them. Plenty of testimonies survive on the critical standpoint of thechurch authorities, while there is only one explicit account that shows the conflictfrom the magicians’ point of view. ;is can be read in a curious book, the Liberiuratus Honorii (Sworn Book of Honorius), which reports of a great gathering ofeighty-nine magicians from Naples, Athens, and Toledo, who reject the unfairaccusations of the pope and his cardinals, and emphasize that the principles of theirmagical art are “in the cause of truth.” As this apology of necromancers implies, itis not the magicians but the representatives of the church who are led by demons,and that this demonic inspiration is the reason why they spread false and unlikelystories about their adversaries.80Hopefully, we will not be accused of siding withD  C3978. “Magic in a Christian framework” is an expression Sophie Page uses in “Magic at St. Augus-tine’s,” chap. 6.79.

In this subtype we willclassify such books as the widespread Ars notoria,its derivative, the Liber visionum( The Book of Visions) of brother John, a monk of Morigny, and the relatively rareLiber iuratus Honorii, which also relies in part on the text of theArs notoria.Nevertheless, there are books that do not even pretend to be nondemonic. Whiletexts belonging to the tradition of the Ars notoria situate themselves in a holy con-text, call the beings invoked spirits or angels, and aim to obtain seemingly inno-cent abilities such as better memory or knowledge in the liberal arts, other authorsprovide openly demonic techniques of all kind. ;ese techniques serve for trea-sure hunting, for the discovery of thieves or stolen goods, for obtaining a horse, aboat, or right away a castle, for obtaining a woman’s love, or for conjuring a spiritwho refuses to appear. ;e texts do not refrain from giving advice on how variousdestructive and harmful aims can be achieved: the reader may learn how to makesomeone lose his senses, or how to foment hatred between friends. While meth-ods are usually similar to those found in the Ars notoria (prayers and invocations),the objectives and the intentions are so different that modern secondary literaturetends to differentiate between two subdivisions: “angelic” and “demonic” magic.81Both refer to the art of obtaining various kinds of benefits with the help of spiritualbeings, but while angelic magic puts great emphasis on the ritual preparations for themagical act, such as confession, fasting, and meditation, claims not to use demonichelp, and tends to bring divine entities down to earth with the help of prayers toGod, Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the order of benign angels, demonic magic in -volves the invocation of demons, and uses magic circles, powerful words, secret seals,suffumigations, sacrifices, and conjurations in order to obtain benefits, to causeharm or disease, to become invisible, or to manipulate the emotions of others.Even this superficial acquaintance with their content makes it easy to under-stand why manuscripts with explicit demonic content had a much lower chanceof survival.82In Central Europe, for example, no example of this genre is knownat the moment; therefore, we will not elaborate the subject of demonic magic fur-ther.

One important term remains unex-plained, however, which is perhaps one of the most often used expressions: necro-mantia.;is term, which originally served simply to refer to divination by the dead,became a much richer expression in the Middle Ages.84By the thirteenth or four-teenth century the meaning of necromancy had become at least threefold. It wasused first as a rhetorical designation of something illicit, harmful, and rejected.;is meaning was emotional rather than conceptual; it was practically indepen-dent of the content of the text, and said more about the standpoint and intentionsof the person applying the term: he sees demonic intervention or wicked aims ina certain practice which he calls accordingly forbidden magic, that is, necromancy(the term “black magic” was not used until the Renaissance).;e second meaning has more to do with the content of a text called necro-mantic, and refers to what we have just defined as the second, demonic subtype ofritual magic. It should be added, however, that secondary literature uses the term“necromancy” sometimes in a wider sense, including the other, “angelic” branchof ritual magic, or even certain demonic practices of image magic.It might sound surprising, but “necromancy” in its third meaning was long asuccessful applicant for denoting a widely accepted part of science. ;e great sum-mary of Arabic magic, the Picatrix, defines it in a rather wide and naturalistic senseD  C4183. See Nicholas Watson, “John the Monk’s Book of Visions of the Blessed and Undefiled VirginMary, Mother of God: Two Versions of a Newly Discovered Ritual Magic Text,” in Fanger, ConjuringSpirits,esp. 164.84. ;is is why Jean-Patrice Boudet suggests that a distinct modern form, nigromancy, should beused as the synonym of black magic, while necromancy would remain to refer to the original mean-ing, that is, the invocation of the spirits of the dead.

In an early twelfth-century work on the educa-tion of clerks (Disciplina clericalis), written by Petrus Alfonsi (fl. after 1106), a Jew-ish convert to Christianity, necromancy appeared as one of the seven liberal arts.Another work, written especially on the classification of sciences by DominicusGundissalinus (fl. 1140), mentioned “the science of nigromancy according to phys -ics” as a subdivision of natural science together with medicine, astrological judg-ments, the science of images (meaning talismans), agriculture, navigation, the science of mirrors (that is, optics), and alchemy.86Petrus Alfonsi and DominicusGundissalinus are by no means atypical; their works were not peripheral pieces ofthe literary production of the twelfth century. Alfonsi’s text served the educationof clerks, while the work of Gundissalinus was used in the university curriculum;and therefore, the authors’ views on the importance of necromancy gained no lit-tle publicity. Taking a look at their background, the source of these strange viewswill quickly become obvious. ;e idea that necromancy might be considered as apart of science is a conceptual import from the Arabic tradition. Petrus Alfonsiwas a translator of Arabic scientific texts, while the De divisione philosophiae byGundissalinus relied heavily on De ortu scientiarumattributed to al-Farabi (870–950). Nevertheless, this friendly reception of the word was not universal amongthe Latin philosophers and theologians. It took quite a while to decide which partsof the Arabic knowledge could be admitted into the Christian scientific corpus,and necromancy was not among the lucky candidates. ;e two previous meaningsof necromancy are better indicators of the European fate of this discipline thanthe one used by Alfonsi and Gundissalinus.Instead of getting lost in the labyrinth of the complex implications and under-tones of the words “necromancy” and “magic,” the chapters that follow will ratherstick to the five categories introduced above, categories which hopefully will notbecome so easily misleading. Nevertheless, while we attempt to classify our sourcesin these categories, we should always bear in mind that this typology of the various42P O: M85.

Booksare not merely containers of secret studies and arcane knowledge; they are oftenregarded in their physical existence as magical objects, amulets, or relics and, con-sequently, as dangerous entities in their own right.1They may function as instru-ments of power, having special abilities to protect, help, instruct, or deceive theirreaders.2Subsequently, the very possession of magical books is often criminalized:as it happened in the cases of Henry the Bohemian and Nicholas, the Krakówhangman, whereas monks of various orders were repeatedly threatened with severepunishments for possessing alchemical writings.1.

The royal prayer book of Wladislas—thesubject of Chapter 6—attests to have been written and composed with special ora-tions, fasting, with the utmost reverence, and with all sorts of ceremonies.A Kraków codex of encyclopedic content and of necromantic fame, the Liberviginti artium(Book of the Twenty Arts) of Paul of Prague, was believed to bearthe traces of the touch of the devil.4Its demonic power was so feared even in theeighteenth century that the book was hidden under a stone for some years so thatit could not be read; other reports claim that it was chained to the wall in thelibrary of Vilnius. From time to time, the book is believed to possess sinister pow-ers as if malign demons might reside in it. Various descriptions have come to usreporting that when such books were burned, bystanders heard the voices of escap-ing demons. Opponents ascribed a certain personality to them and viewed themas agents. Nicholas Eymeric, the Catalan inquisitor who had a close acquaintancewith necromantic books, since he read, condemned, and burned a great numberof them, handled these codices as if they were active participants in the sinisterrites they described. The burning of such books might have been perceived as akind of exorcism, as well as an imitation of the punishment that magicians de -served.5Thus, the controversy on magic is also a battle of books in which theyeither succeed and survive, or fail and perish.However, we do not necessarily need to hear escaping demons to view magiccodices with a certain interest (or suspicion). As the main vehicles of secret andforbidden knowledge, they are responsible for the dissemination of learned magic,and their destruction or survival greatly depends on the picture they construct.Sometimes their attempt at legitimating their magical content by creating a mostholy image remains unsuccessful and leads to the formation of an opposite, dia-bolical impression. We will see this (at least partly) failed effort in the case of theArs notoriaand the Liber visionum, the latter of which was not only condemnedbut also burned in Paris.

They portray themselves as scientific works, insertingthe magical texts between practical works on astronomy and natural philosophy.Thanks to this structure, they identify their scribes’ and owners’ interest, even if theydo not identify the men themselves. They tell us whether the texts were intendedfor daily use or copied by simple coincidence, in abhorrence of blank space (a spe-cial kind of horror vacui) left between the longer pieces of scientific literature.They represent the conceptual scheme of the scribe, his tacit classification of sciences, and the place he assigned to magic within the framework of a system ofsciences. Occasionally, this classification is not even tacit. For example, ConradKyeser’s work on magical warfare, the Bellifortis, ends with a detailed taxonomy,in which the author places magical sciences among the less questionable disci-plines. Kyeser’s Bellifortisis furthermore a good example to illustrate the foregoingpremise: the text is not a prisoner of the book containing it. Whereas the originalversion of the Bellifortisinsulted the greatest enemy of Kyeser, Emperor Sigismund,one later copy of this work, surviving in a codex in Buda, became disassociated withthe intentio auctoristo the extent that it was eventually dedicated to the emperorhimself. Apparently, the two versions of the same text adopted different strategiesof survival in the complicated political contexts of those decades.The chapters that follow have two aims: first, to describe the content and thehistory of magical texts found in Central Europe, and second, to show what themanuscript codices that—primarily or accidentally—comprise them can add to thishistory. In a separate section I will address the question of how the writing andvisual decoration of a book of magic determine its character as a “representationalobject.”We will concentrate on the historical and sociological context of the given epoch’sscientific knowledge. An attempt will be made to determine what counts as sci-entific knowledge in a particular age, where its boundaries are drawn, and what canbe found within and outside these boundaries. Thus far, we have gotten acquaintedwith the theoretical arguments of accepting or rejecting a text that wished to enterthe domain of legitimate science. We witnessed how a group of scholars struggledwith the question of demarcation, that is, the problem of drawing the frontiers ofaccepted science and of establishing what can be considered a part of it. In PartTwo, in contrast, we will examine the mechanism of acceptance and rejection asit can be reconstructed from the manuscripts themselves. We have perhaps lesssociological evidence than the historians of later epochs have to find out how thescholars who accepted the demarcation criteria established by a larger communityof intellectuals were rewarded and how those who were reluctant to accept themI: T S  M4902 Chapter 2:Sample.qxd 9/24/2008 11:18 AM Page 49"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"were excluded (the sporadic evidence we do have will be presented in Part Three).Yet we can apply a somewhat analogous approach that can be labeled as the soci-ology of manuscripts.Instead of reconstructing the norms followed by a learned soci-ety or an academy when accepting or rejecting an applicant, in the following fivechapters, we will rather examine the norms a medieval codex followed when accept-ing a text on its folios, and a library followed when tolerating a book on its shelves.Exploring which texts survived in many copies and which ones only in a few, andtaking a look at the texts neighboring a given treatise of magic will perhaps bemore informative about where the limits of science and magic were in fact drawnthan reading the explicit theoretical literature on the demarcation issues.50P T: T  H02 Chapter 2:Sample.qxd 9/24/2008 11:18 AM Page 50"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"E F  S  K: T C  N  PA small medical scandal took place in 1278 in a region of “Lesser Poland” nearKraków. A certain Nicholas from the local Dominican monastery did not followthe proper and accepted way of examining and curing medical problems: he didnot inspect the urine of the sick, but instead turned to less established methods.He suggested that people should consume snakes (serpens), lizards (lacerta), andfrogs (rana) in order to cure the various illnesses they suffered from. Instead ofproperly examining human urine, which was indeed a most widespread methodin medi eval medicine, he used a closed pouch, the contents of which nobody wasallowed to check, and he hung this pouch at night above the bed of the sick person(or perhaps around his neck like an amulet). If the patient sweated and had dreamsduring the night he stood a chance of being cured; otherwise, he was doomed.Zese methods were taken seriously; and with Nicholas’s encouragement, peo-ple collected reptiles and amphibians with their bare hands. He acquired some fol-lowers in the circles of the local Dominicans at the monastery of Kraków, and evenLeszek the Black, the duke of Sieradz, and his wife Griphina became convinced ofthe advantages of the new approach. However, maintains the chronicler RocznikTraski, who recorded these events in 1341, some people were horrified by all thatNicholas did and initiated.11.

Zough it is not known whetherhe earned a doctoral degree there, his works witness a deep familiarity with theacademic medical tradition and a good mastery of the Latin idiom. However, hewas by no means a follower of the mainstream tradition.Two Latin texts are known to have been written by him. His theoretical work,the Antipocras, is a versified critique of the conventional Hippocratic system taughtin the university curriculum at that time, the rejection of which is spelled out inits very title: anti hippocras.4In this polemic text, he lays down the theoretical foun-dations of his alternative medicine, the practical aspect of which is illustrated bya collection of actual cases in his second work, the Experimenta.5In addition, thereis also a German collection of recipes attributed to him, the Cyrurgia, which 52P T: T  Hnoctem, et qui sudabunt ex huius suspensione et quedam videbant sompnia curabantur, et qui non,non.

Nicholas givesdetailed instructions on how to pulverize them, how to mix them with oil, wine, andvarious other liquids, which the patient is supposed to drink in turn, and how to pre-pare pills and other medicaments from these ingredients. Different kinds of snakes,scorpions, lizards, and frogs are good for different medical problems: toothache, dif-ficult childbirth, deafness, illnesses of the eye, and so forth. To cure an open wound,he recommends taking an “aquatic frog,” cutting open its stomach, and attachingthe animal together with its innards to the injury, which will eventually heal.It is obvious even for those who are not familiar with the finer details of themedi eval history of science, that snakes and frogs in such a concentration do notconstitute the procedures of Hippocratic medicine. Indeed, in his poem Antipocras,Nicholas expresses his skepticism regarding the methods of the scholastic, “rational,”and academic physicians, who rely on authorities such as Galen and Hippocrates,instead of following a “natural” and “experimental” practice.9Ze importance ofhis personal experience as opposed to the purely theoretical methods is also empha-sized in the not very modest incipit of the Experimenta: “Here begin the Experi-ments on animals of friar Nicholas, medicus[medical practitioner] from Poland,who spent twenty years in Montpellier, and who was a person of such experience[who was so proficient in experientia] that no similar person is believed to havelived before him, nor is that hoped in the future—as it appears from his miraculousworks while performing great and unexpected cures in various lands and regions.”10N M536.

Zere is, however, one copy of the Experimenta in KMK M XIV (Podlaha 1367), fols.9r–18v. In this manuscript, as in some other surviving copies of the text, Nicholas is called Nicolausde Bohemia. Neither Nicholas’s works nor their sources can be found in the Dominicans’ library inKraków, where he had been a medical practitioner, which is not surprising, since this collection ofmedieval manuscripts was almost entirely destroyed in a fire in 1850; only forty-five codices sur-vived.

If itworks efficiently, do the same with toad-powder, and if that works too, try scorpion-powder, but always the suitable quantity.” To illustrate what the adequate quantityis, we are provided detailed instructions on the pulverization process. “Take threeor four toads, put them in a new pot, close it with clay so that they cannot evap-orate, and then put it close to the fire, in a way that its content does not get singedjust desiccated, and if you shake the pot, you will know from its sound when it isdesiccated enough to get pulverized. Zan take it from the pot, and if it is not dryenough, desiccate it perfectly in a shadow in the wind, and then smash it minutelyin a mortar, and finally put it in a closed glass vessel so that it cannot evaporate.You can prepare serpent or scorpion powder in a similar way.”Ze Antipocras offers a clear explanation of why Nicholas is so fascinated bysnake flesh, and why he recommends eating or drinking it—if possible—twice aday: occult virtue is conferred in all earthly things, especially in snakes, frogs, andscorpions. Ze ultimate source of this spiritual virtue is the goodness of God.11Similar to the claims of William of Auvergne on natural magic, the Antipocrasspecifies that demons are not involved in the occult relationships of the objects ofthe world.12Nicholas accuses scholastic medicine of attributing too much impor-tance to the causes; indeed, he does not attribute any, and admits that he does notknow why the celestial and divine virtues exercise any effect on the earthly mate-rial.13However, he emphasizes that the path leading toward the secrets of natureis definitely not that of ratiobut empirica,and the people to whom God revealedhis secrets are not the academic physicians but the ordinary people of villages, whoare closer to empirical matters.14Does it follow from his critique of Hippocratic medicine that Nicholas was anoutsider with no serious sources and with no connections to any theoretical tra-dition? Not quite.

Nevertheless, itsoperation is sometimes good sometimes bad, as science becomes good or badaccording to the aims it is used for. Two conclusions can be drawn from this, thefirst being that the science of magic is not bad [evil], because thanks to its cogni-tion bad things can be avoided and good things can be pursued.”19Zen follow the three main sections of the book, which are devoted respectivelyto the description of plants, stones, and animals (primarily birds). Each paragraphin the first part starts as a proper encyclopedia entry: we are provided with theChaldean, Greek, and Latin names of the given herb. Having clarified the termi-nology, we learn the virtus mirabilis (marvelous virtue) attributed to the plant thatmay be applied for a wide variety of personal objectives. Collecting and preparingthe herb appropriately, the user can achieve various interesting results: he will beaddressed only with friendly words, he will become invisible, a sick person aboutto die will sing loudly, dogs will lose their ability to bark, and so on.

Besides the usual objectives such as becoming invisible, defeating theenemy, pacifying the tempest, acquiring wisdom and getting rid of folly, seeingthe future, and curing melancholy in someone, we find other wishes too, whichare not as benign as the apology for magic in the prologue had promised, andwhich recommend specific stones if we want to burn someone’s hand without using56P T: T  H18.

Ze tongue of the sea cow,for example, may be used to prevent the bad opinions of others,20while the heartof the owl is an efficient aid when we want to interrogate someone.21When looking for the direct sources of the theories and practices of the Exper-imenta Alberti,we are informed immediately in the prologue that the author hadtaken all these truths from the book titled Kyranidis(veritatem suppono ex libroCyranidis). Ze Kyranides,which has been addressed here, is a Late Antique col-lection translated—after an eventful and complicated history—into Latin in 1169in Constantinople. Claiming to contain knowledge originating from Kiranus, kingof Persia, from Harpocration of Alexandria, and ultimately from Hermes Trisme -gistos himself, it offers recipes for the medical application and magical propertiesof the elements of nature.22As a systematic catalog of the natural world, the firstbook of the Kyranidesgroups a bird, a fish, a plant, and a stone under each letterof the Greek alphabet. It specifies their therapeutic virtues, and explains how a tal-is man based on these virtues should be prepared. Ze three remaining books con-centrate on remedies made from quadrupeds (including serpents!), birds, and fish.While the Experimenta offers a great variety of methods that were by no meansconventional in medieval science, legitimate natural philosophy, medicine, magic,and revelation are utterly mixed in the Kyranides.Among its goals we find clearlymedical ones (curing baldness, encouraging erection, making a woman conceive,ensuring that a woman does not conceive) besides others which could rather becalled magical (to expel demons, to perform a miracle so that someone will seemrobust and glorious to all, to make a dream come true).Even within the realm of magic, this work can be classified as easily under nat-ural magic as under image magic, since besides describing the specific occult vir -tues, it also explains systematically the preparation of talismans. What is more, theKyranides even contains a few invocations: for example, having caught an eagle andbound its feet, you should whisper in its ears the following words: “O aquila, amicahominis, nunc macto te ad omnis infirmitatis curationem, coniuro te per Deumcaeli et terrae et per quattuor elementa ut efficaciam habeas ad unum quamqueN M5720.

Having uttered this invocation, youcut off its head with an iron sword that had been plunged previously into honey.Not only its details but also its structure reminds the reader of the Experimenta.Contemporary book collectors and scribes also noticed this connection, and thusthe two texts appear frequently in the same manuscripts, their traditions are ofteninterrelated.

To thecasual observer it is a usual piece of “Mirror for Princes” literature, in which thephilosopher gives advice to the ruler on various political and moral topics. Zeseinclude issues such as a taxonomy of kings according to their generosity, the waya ruler should conduct himself, the importance of justice, the ministers (of whoma ruler should have five), the ambassadors, the army officers, and the strategy andtactics to be followed in a war. And it was indeed seen by many as a summary ofthe art of ruling: among the few codices surviving from the library of the AngevinLouis the Great, king of Hungary (1342–82) and Poland (1370–82), there is acopy of the Secretum secretorum depicting the king in the first initial, H.2458P T: T  H23.

Ze book “On ministers” includes a detailed cosmogony ex -plaining the place of God, man, the minerals, the vegetables, and the animals,while in the chapter titled “On the conduct of war,” Alexander is provided with aname-magic formula, with which he can calculate from the number of the lettersof the opposing generals’ names, who will win the battle (though this section ofthe Arabic original does not occur in the Latin translations). Finally, book 10 ofthe Arabic version (the content of which is scattered in books 2 and 9 in the Latintexts) is entirely consecrated for the occult sciences, starting with an apology ofthe science of the talismans, continuing with alchemy, and arriving at what can becalled the essence of natural magic: a lapidary and a herbal listing of the occultproperties of the particular stones and herbs.All in all, the Secretum secretorum—with all its teachings on political matters,medicine, physiognomy, astrology, magical gems, the virtues of herbs, amulets, andrecipes—was an exhaustive compendium of general information as useful for aruler as for anyone else. Ze name of Aristotle, the pretense of secrecy, and theencyclopedic character all equally contributed to the process, which had the resultthat the Secretum was viewed as a reference work. It circulated in two Latin versions,a longer and a shorter one, translated first only partially by John of Seville in thetwelfth century, and later on completely by Philip of Tripoli in the thirteenth.What is common in the three texts described? Zeir histories are quite different.Ze Secretum claims to be of Greek origin, but apart from the Latin copies onlyits two Arabic versions have survived, and we do not know whether there was anyGreek original; the Kyranides is originally a Hellenistic product, which was thentranslated from Greek into Arabic,26and in turn into Latin; while the ExperimentaN M59( The Oxford Codex of King Louis the Great, the Age and the Illuminator of the Viennese Illumi-nated Chronicle), Magyar Könyvszemle37 (1930): 382–93.25.

Nonetheless, allthree contain certain Greek elements, and are mainly based on Arabic materialinterpolated with Christian components.As it has been pointed out, the matter of these texts cannot be sharply demarcatedeither from the content of works on medicine, or from that of medical formularies.Recipes, experiments, the use of animal substances, and the objectives to be achievedrelate them to medical literature. Furthermore, in their organization they follow thestructure of encyclopedias, bestiaries,herbaria,and other works on natural phi-losophy. However, the emphasis on the marvelous, occult, and secret elements, onthe virtus mirabilis and occulta,as well as on the universal sympathy linking all theterrestrial and celestial bodies, and finally the undeniably (and even by medieval stan -dards) magical purposes for which they provide help, detach them from the genreof purely scientific literature and assign their place in the realm of “magic dealingwith the natural world.” Because of the impact of the twelfth- and thirteenth-century Arabic translations, and in contrast with the earlier trends of natural phi-losophy, texts on natural magic insist on their experimental and practical character,a trait that is rather alien from the mainstream medical and scientific works thatfound their main reference in theoretical principles and previous authorities.One last point needs to be especially emphasized here, because it has often beenmisinterpreted. Curiously enough, the experimenta literature is not particularlyex perimental! Experimenta,that is, the “experiments,” should not be interpretedas being analogous to our modern concept, which implies the personal observa-tion of the author of a scientific publication and his special attitude to systemati-cally question the elements of nature. Ze main source for experimentaand secretain the Middle Ages remains what ancient books and authorities claimed; actualexperience, repeated experiments, and concrete counterexamples do not play a con-siderable role in judging the authenticity of the recipes.27Zerefore, this textual tra-dition should not be defined as a practical genre, but as “theoretical literature thatspeaks about practice.”28It is exactly this bookish character of the experiments, recipes, and laws (goingback to ancient authorities such as Galen, Hippocrates, and Aristotle) that Nicholas60P T: T  HKyranis des Hermes Trismegistos und die griechischen Parallelen herausgegeben, übersetzt und kommen-tiert (München: Herbert Utz Verlag, 2004).27.

He undeniably relies on the literature that has been defined asnatural magic, he probably read all three of these texts, and in his person we canperhaps see the first author demonstrating the influence of Pseudo-Albertus’s ideas;yet the reader of his methods will find something unknown from these sources,something really experimental and well-tested. It seems from his texts that Nicholasnot only copied and adopted the reports on the medicinal virtues of snakes, butactually also worked with serpent’s flesh, grounded his Experimenta in direct expe-rience, and probably prepared his own snake powder and snake oil.29T D  MFew medieval sources enjoyed a wider dissemination in the medieval era than theExperimenta Alberti and theSecretum secretorum.Full versions and fragments ofthe Experimentahave survived in more than a hundred manuscripts,30and a further indication of its popularity is its one hundred and twenty distinct printededitions from the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries.

In two manuscripts,for example, which once belonged to a medical doctor from Kraków, AndrzejGrzymala of Posnania (ca. 1425–66),38we find the Secretum secretorum and theExperimenta surrounded with medical treatises. Both BJ 813 and 805 are the fruitsof the first golden age of the University of Kraków; they were collected around1364 and owned first by another medical doctor, Professor Herman z Przeworska.In addition to our two tracts of natural magic, they contain mainstream texts ofthe medical curriculum written by—or attributed to—Hippocrates, Galen, Phi-laretus, and Arnald of Villanova. Besides these classics, there are also a few practi-cal works on the inspection of urine, on the pulse, on the interpretation of dreams,on human anatomy, and also astrological and astronomical items on comets, onthe use of astrolabes, and on constellations.

It is important to emphasize that the weirdest example of the genre of natural magic, the Libervaccae,which explains the artificial generation of various animals and homunculi,cannot be foundin the medical manuscript from Prague, PNK X H 20, even though a text copied on the folios 230v–238v—in fact, De sexaginta animalibus of Rasis—is entitled Liber vaccein the codex. See TK 1688,incipit: “Verbum Aristotelis et Diascoridis est in collo leonis,” and HMES, 2:762. Zis text in thePrague codex includes a number of recipes on how and for what purpose various animal parts maybe used. Among the animals, we find cows, sheep, leopards, bees, elephants, deer, hoopoes, camels,eagles, and basically every living being that populated the medieval world. Various substances madeout of the members (eyes, tongues, horns, and so on) and fluids (blood and semen) of these animalsserve for medical and magical goals. None of this differs radically from the common tradition of nat-ural magic. David Pingree, in his “Plato’s Hermetic Book of the Cow,” mistakenly lists this text as oneof the twelve surviving copies of the Liber vaccae.38.Polski Słownik Biograficzny(Polish Biographical Dictionary), ed.

Zis “compendium”describes the therapeutic properties and the astrological correspondences of sevenplants.40Ze Compendium aureum is linked to the Kyranidesby its subject matter,but the connection between the two works is further underscored by the fact thatthe Kyranides itself explicitly states that a book on seven herbs and seven planetsshould precede it.In a fourth medical codex from the Jagiellonian library, BJ 817—owned by theastronomer and medical doctor Matthias of Miechów, who traveled to Italy in1483, the year of the birth of the codex—Kyranides (or rather Kiramidis) plays acentral role as a personified authority. In addition to the integral version of theKyranides itself, this manuscript also contains Zebit’s De imaginibus and—as astarting text—the De tonitruis libellus (Small Book on the Zunders) by the Ven-erable Bede.41What is interesting here is first the exceptional attribution of Bede’swork: “Incipit Kiramidis de iudiciis tonitruorum” [Here starts Kiramidis’s book onthe assessment of thunders],42and second, that at the beginning of Zebit’s workon talismanic magic, instead of “Dixit Zebit ben Chorat” [Zebit ben Choratsaid], we read “Dixit Kyramidis” [Kyramidis said]. When looking at this versionof the name, we should bear in mind that the original name of the alleged authorof the book was Kiranus or Kiranis, and the word “Kyranides” is already a deriva-tion of this form referring to the text, not to a particular king of Persia. Zus,“Kyramidis” used as a personal name is a derivation of an already derivative form.In this manuscript, whoever “Kyramidis” might be apparently took over theauthorship of the texts surrounding his own! A possible explanation for the con-fusion caused by the occurrence of Kiramidis as the author of the De imaginibusmight be provided by the prologue of the Experimenta Albertithat lists the Kyranidesand Zebit one after the other as the main sources of its content (“veritatem sub-pono quo ad aliqua ex Chyramdis libro et libro Alcorat”).43Ze impression thatthe profound connection of these two texts was recognized by the medieval scribesN M6339.

Zis is, however, not an exclusiverule: texts of image magic, such as Zebit’s De imaginibus,might be also associatedwith natural magic. Let us finally take a closer look at two manuscripts, one fromPrague, one from Kraków, to explore more in detail how natural magic is con-nected to the nonmagical contents of the codices.Ze Prague manuscript PNK XI C 2 ( Truhlář 2027) is a compilation fromaround 1440 on various subjects of the natural world.45It contains both medicaland magical material, in both Latin and Czech. Ze Czech portion comprisesrecipes on balms, descriptions of the celestial signs, comments (which are in Latin)on several herbaria,a lapidary,46and a few medical formulas. Among the Latin texts,we find calendars, a number of astrological and astronomical treatises, a treatiseon wine and vinegar, an illustrated and comparative system of urine samples, anda table indicating under which zodiacal sign it is suitable to erect buildings, cas-trate animals, start a journey or dispute, and so on.47Zere are also a few texts ofdivination: some geomantic tracts with explicatory tables,48and a rather commononomantic device, the Rota Pythagorae, the methods of which are based on the let-ters of the name of the questioner and on the numbers belonging to the planets.49Ze divinatory material finally includes an important piece of the literature of geo -mantic divination, Sortes regis Amalrici (Prophecies of King Amalricus).50Ze practices of natural science and natural magic are practically inseparable.64P T: T  H44.Experimenta, fols. 143v–148v; De imaginibus of Zebit, fols. 140v–143v; another copy ofthe same text being on fols. 61r–63r.

Zey fell asleep and woke up miraculously two hundred yearslater, during the reign of Zeodosius. Zeir story is described by Gregory of Tours,and it is included also in the Golden Legend.

Zis claim is supported by a further medical handbook (BJ 778) fromaround 1425, owned and partly copied by Johannes of Dobra, a professor and rec-tor of the University of Kraków.62Countless marginal notes, addenda, remarks,short recipes, and excerpts sketched by the owner confirm the impression that itwas used as a manual and as a notebook for actual medical practice.63Ze codexcontains among other works two short Hermetic herbaria related again to theKyranides:the Liber de septem herbis (Book of the Seven Herbs), attributed to Alex -ander Magnus,64and De virtutibus herbarum (On the Virtue of Herbs) of Zessalus.65It has already been mentioned that the former work describes a correspondencebetween the medical and magical properties of the seven herbs and the qualitiesassociated with the planets.

See Draelants, “Un encyclopédisteméconnu,” 2:553–63. It should be added that both texts bear detectable similarities to an authenticwork of Albertus Magnus, the De mineralibus(written between 1245 and 1263), which is usuallybelieved to be a source for the Pseudo-Albertian Experimenta,while its source, in turn, had beenArnoldus’s lapidary. As far as we know, Arnoldus Saxo (or Arnoldus Luca) was one of the encyclo-pedists and natural philosophers of the thirteenth century, active in the middle of the century inGermany and France. As is probable after Isabelle Draelants’s research, he might have been one ofthe collaborators of Albertus Magnus (although one should note that while we can identify the intel-lectual circle in and with which Zomas Aquinas worked, very little is known about the socii of Albertthe Great), and it is also likely that Albert borrowed from Arnoldus Saxo’s lapidary when compilinginformation for his own De mineralibus.62.Polski Słownik Biograficzny,10:449–50.63.CBJ,6:36–55.64.

But it is not only natural magic that concerns itselfwith such objectives; Zebit’s De imaginibus provides talismanic methods for con-quering territories and destroying cities. Zus, we should not be surprised if we findmilitary technology and magical means side by side in certain handbooks. Zereis no real contradiction in the mixture of such remote interests; in the Middle Agesand in the Renaissance, the combination of medical astrology, engineering, andmagic was viewed as rather natural. Mechanical inventions often had supernaturalconnotations. Medieval popular imagination attributed a certain magical notori-ety to technological interest: one may think of the miraculous inventions of RogerBacon, which are not independent of his later reputation as a magician, but wecan also mention the legends surrounding Virgil or Gerbert d’Aurillac (later PopeSylvester II), in which the alleged magician uses his power for creating automataand miraculous mechanical devices.Ze same association of craftsmanship and engineering with magic can be doc-u mented in official education, too. Medical astrology was a well-established disci-pline in the universities, which successively became connected with a technologicalproblem, the improvement of the clock—which was needed, inter alia,for castingmore accurate horoscopes. It was not exceptional that the mechanical interest of med-ical astrologers culminated in military technology, as the works of the fourteenth-century Italian physician Guido da Vigevano and those of his contemporary, themedical astrologer Giovanni de’ Dondi testify. Since these two works are the onlytechnological texts surviving from the fourteenth century, the combination of thesefields is certainly more than a simple coincidence. Further examples for somekindof combination of astrology, medicine, technology, military engines, alchemy, clock -works, magic, and metallurgy can be found in the fifteenth century in the worksof Giovanni Fontana of Venice, Jean Fusoris, and Henry Arnault of Zwolle, untilwe arrive to the last famous meeting of medicine and technology on the pages ofDe re metallica by Georgius Agricola in 1556.69Technology—not a university subject in the Middle Ages, as a matter of fact, noteven scientiain the Aristotelian sense of the word—had always been surroundedby the aura of secrecy and mystery. In addition, it shared with magic the feature ofbeing practical and manipulative, unlike mainstream science (or rather, philosophianaturalis), which did not tend to interfere in the natural processes it studied, andwhich relied more on observation than on manipulation and experi mentation.

He composed hiswork in exile in the first years of the fifteenth century.71He was not a nobleman,but born of burgher parents he acquired a university education, and his professionwas originally medicine.72As a practicing engineer he was present at the Battle ofNicopolis in 1396, where the Turkish armies triumphed over the united Chris -tian forces. He blamed—not entirely unfairly—Sigismund, king of Hungary, forthe defeat.73He lived at several courts, including that of Wenceslas, Holy RomanEmperor and king of Bohemia, as a free intellectual, an engineer, and probablyaffecting a bit the role of a magician. For political reasons, and supposedly accusedof sorcery, Kyeser was forced into exile in a small community in the Bohemianmountains in 1402. Zis happened when Sigismund deposed his brother, Wences-las, and started the systematic dismissal of the latter’s supporters from the Imperialcourt as potential menacing factors.74Fortunately for Kyeser, some unemployed N M7170.

Whether it was to be used as a manual in military conflicts or simply to entertain its peaceful reader with its tech-nical, literary and magical material, is still a matter of debate.75In any case, itdescribes and depicts a number of martial instruments, ladders for the siege of castles, machinery to help horses cross a river, catapults, rockets, arrows, arbalests,nails, scissors, clasps and horseshoes, and recipes for preparing various kinds offires (for one of the instruments, see fig. 2). Ze reader is also shown some—atleast in the context of engineering—unexpected pictures that seem to be some-what less related to military affairs: a female chastity device, a tool for castratingmen, the black queen of Sheba, a goose fastened to an anchor, and a few pictureson how to prepare a bath appropriately. Some of the machineries bear fantasticfeatures; among them a huge wheeled cat with a long destructive pike in its mouththat might have served to frighten the enemy (fig. 3).Further elements are explicitly magical, and this is where the Bellifortis is greatlyindebted to the experimentaliterature, that is, to the genre of natural magic.Kyeser’s familiarity with this literature originates probably from the time of hisstudies in medicine. He takes paragraphs word for word from the pseudo-Albert-ian corpus, not just from the Experimenta Alberti,which we examined earlier, butfrom a text that often traveled together with it, the De mirabilibus mundi (On theMarvels of the World).76Zis pseudograph starts with a theoretical introductionto magic, continues with random recipes incorporating material from the Liber vac-cae,and finishes with more systematic paragraphs taken from the Liber ignium(Book of Fires) of Marcus Graecus. Among the experiments of the De mirabilibusmundi,Kyeser is mostly concerned with those which provide methods for prepar-ing magical lamps that cannot be extinguished either by water or by wind. Zeserecipes make use of various animal substances, such as the flesh of a frog, the tailand blood of a serpent, the blood of a turtle, the tail of a dog and of a wolf, not tomention the brain of a bird.77As fire is usually a crucial element in late-medi evalwarfare, and tracts on fires were consequently important sources of military tech-nology, it is not surprising that the Liber ignium—a collection of instructions on 72P T: T  H75.

Secondary literature identifies the per-son summoning the demons from the tower with Kyeser himself, comparing thepicture with his portrait on the last page of the manuscript.80But this identifica-tion is only one of the many reasons why we can view Kyeser not only as an activeengineer but also as a practicing magician.With this information, we should not be astonished by how Kyeser closes thebook—he casts his own horoscope—or by his inclusion of the magical arts amongthe sciences. In this classification, after having listed the seven liberal arts, and beforegetting to the mechanical sciences, Kyeser mentions theurgy and the “exceptive”arts as basic branches of science.81Ze use of the word ars exceptivaimplies—aswe saw in Chapter 1—that the author was familiar with the terminology of thenotory art. One more feature supporting this impression is that Kyeser gives thelist of sciences in the same order as the Ars notoria:liberal, exceptive, and mechan-ical arts. In the next paragraph, he explains each of the liberal arts briefly; after thedescription of loyca, rhetorica, arismetrica, geometria, musica, astronomia,we readabout a method of divination, geomancia.All this is again followed by theologia,philosophia, leges, jus canonicum, phisica,and then comes alchimia.Ze list of sci-ences are completed by the artes theurgice, that is, magic, which is called “the mostsophisticated branch of the mechanical arts,” and finally—since we are actuallyreading a book on military techniques—by the ars militaris.82Ze university sub-jects, the mechanical sciences, and the magical arts merge into each other ratherorganically, without any attempt to condemn or exclude the latter ones.It is not just modern philologists who consider Kyeser’s book noteworthy; accord-ing to all indications, it provoked considerable interest among its contemporaries,too. Rather exceptionally in the distribution of medieval manuscripts, at least fourearly drafts from the time of the very composition of the Bellifortishave survived,and a relatively large number of copies and excerpts from the following decadeshave come down to us.83Zis shows that however isolated Kyeser might have felt76P T: T  H79.

Ze extant pages—kept in Budapest at present—contain illustrationsdepicting the astrological planets symbolically, as human figures on horseback withflags in their hands.85Fortunately, Kyeser had died before he could have faced thetrauma that the illuminator of this fragment depicted his greatest enemy, the em -peror, as the knight symbolizing the sun (the Budapest fragment is the only Belli-fortismanuscript known to us that contains the portrait of Sigismund). Nothingcould have been further from the author’s intent. Kyeser belonged to the court ofWenceslas IV, whom Sigismund deposed; moreover, he dedicated the Bellifortis toRuprecht of Pfalz (briefly emperor between Wenceslas and Sigismund, and far fromfriend of his successor). Kyeser’s hatred of Sigismund dated from the time of themilitary failure in Nicopolis, and his expulsion from the Imperial court did noth-ing to improve his attitude. To ensure that the reader would not misinterpret histrue feelings, he characterizes Sigismund in the opening pages of the Bellifortis as“false-hearted and good-for-nothing” (fallacem et nequam). It should be added thatthis passage is missing from those copies of the Bellifortis made after Ruprecht’sdeath (1410) and Wenceslas IV’s reconciliation with his brother in 1411. Zeywere probably omitted from the Budapest manuscript as well.Sigismund is not the only Central European monarch with whom these sur-viving pages can be linked; we have all the reasons to suppose that they spent afew decades on the shelves of the famous Corvinian Library of King Matthias ofHungary. Zese fragments of theBellifortis were found in the nineteenth centuryin the archives of Constantinople. Ze only way they could have gotten there wasif they had belonged to the Corvinian Library, a great portion of which wasbrought to Constantinople in the sixteenth century, when the Ottomans occupiedHungary. Consequently, it is plausible to consider the Budapest fragments ofKyeser’s military handbook as the remains of a Corvinian codex.

During his stay, he took the opportunity to visit thePolish royal castle, the Wawel, and described some strange pictures he admiredthere: “J’ay veu une partie d’autres signes en peinture contre les parois d’une cham-bre, à la court du Roy de Pologne en Craco qui éstoient de forme monstrueuse,dont les membres éstoient composez de diverses espèces d’animaux, et éstoit écritauprès Signa Hermetis, c’est à dire les signes d’Hermes.”1We are not in the position anymore to verify what exactly Stevin saw when hewrote of the monstrous figures, because these decorations perished in a fire twentyyears later. On the basis of the written source material, however, it becomes pos-sible to reconstruct what the “signs of Hermes” may have looked like. Je zoo -morphic creatures composed of various different animals described by the Flemishsavant are most probably the depictions of certain planetary figures, the so-calleddecanic spirits. Jese demons of Egyptian origin are supposed to rule the decans,arcs of ten degrees, thirty-six of which constitute the ecliptic. Je artist may havehad various different astrological models for his work, since the concept of decans—originally introduced in Europe through Arabic astral magic—was quite wide-spread; it appears not only in works of image magic of Arabic origin, such as the1.

However, itis worth underlining that it is exactly the Picatrix which introduces the decanswith the following words: “Modo sequuntur imagines Hermetis,” and it is exactlya Kraków copy of the Picatrix,which—singularly—not only describes the decanicspirits but even provides pictures of them. Jerefore, it is highly possible that theSigna Hermetis,after which the zoomorphic figures of the Wawel were modeled,were exactly the decanic figures of the Kraków Picatrix, extant in the collection ofthe University of Kraków, on the folios of the codex BJ 793.2Before concentrating our attention on this particular codex, it is worth surveyingits wider contexts—first, the science of talismans as it can be learned from the liter-ature of image magic and from the Hermetic texts, and second, the extant manu-scripts which incorporate image magic in a scientific—astronomical-astrological—context, and which help us figure out how far the monstrous figures of the Picatrix,the runic spirit names of the Liber runarum,and the demons enclosed in magicalrings of the Hermetic Liber de spiritibus inclusis( The Book of Enclosed Spirits)were taken seriously.T S  T“Je earthly figures are subjected to the figures of the sky, and this is why the wisemen who construct images observe the entry of the stars in the celestial figures.”3Shorter than the philosophical explanations of the De radiis stellarum of Al-Kindi,more concise than the definitions of the Speculum astronomiae, this single sentencecan be seen as the quintessence of the underlying assumptions of every practice ofimage magic. And the source of this statement is not a magical work, nor is it anapology of magic, but hardcore science. It enjoyed serious legitimacy, being thefamous and often quoted ninth sentence in the collection of the hundred aphorisms,the Centiloquiumof—or so it was believed during the Middle Ages—the greatauthority of astronomy and astrology, Ptolemy.4Teaching that wise men actuallymake images, that is, talismans, and that while doing so, they study the changes ofthe celestial constellations, it provided astrological justification for all operationswith talismans and lent authority to all texts of image magic.Getting acquainted with the philosophy behind them, we can now ask a ratherpractical question: how can we recognize the talismanic texts at first glance when80P T: T  H2.

Paradoxically, what seems to be their maincommon characteristic, namely the use of images and the preference for using pic-torial representations, cannot be employed as a differentia specifica of image magic.5Visual elements play a rather important role in simple divinatory texts that havelittle to do with talismans, necromantic circles are typical elements in demonicmagic, and notae—comprehensive charts representing the relations of notions andserving as tools for meditation—are extensively applied in the tradition of Ars noto-ria.Strangely enough, images seem to be less characteristic of works on imagemagic than of works in these other fields of magic.What texts of image magic truly have in common is their origin. A library of textson the use of talismans was formed in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and con-sisted almost entirely of Latin translations of Arabic works. Je sources arrived inSpain in several waves, the first in the twelfth century, the second—including thePicatrix itself—through the court of Alfonso X, king of Castile (1252–84).6Froma purely scientific point of view, these texts were regarded as fairly acceptable; andeven though some of them raised serious theological concerns, as we have seen inthe Speculum astronomiae, this genre supplied astrological and scientific codiceswith a range of relatively well-tolerated and keenly copied tracts.Je second common element in these texts is the imago (talisman or seal) itself,around which the instructions are organized. In modern terminology, one mightdifferentiate between amulets and talismans. An amulet takes its power, not fromthe image engraved on it, but from the material of which it is made. Je use of theappropriate material (usually a metal) is no less important in the case of the talis-man, but the main source of the force of this second type of object is the imageengraved on it, and the manner of the act of engraving itself.7In medieval sources, the most often used term is imago,frequently spelled ymagoand abbreviated as “y” or “o” in the manuscripts. An imagois not necessarily atwo-dimensional image drawn or imprinted as a seal; the term can also refer to asculpted, three-dimensional object, a statuette, as it does in Jebit’s De imaginibus.Further elements of the medieval terminology of talismans are the sigillum (an imageengraved or imprinted, in other words, a seal), the character (a letter, a planetarysymbol, or a geometrical form), the figura (a character constructed using geomet-rical principles), and the anulus, often spelled annulus (a ring or an image of one).8Je classic tracts on image magic are first of all the two texts accepted by theI M815.

Jis very short list might be supplemented bythe Liber sigillorum (Book of Seals) by Jetel, the De lapidibus (On the Stones)ascribed to Ptolemy, the Hermetic Liber lunae,and a number of tracts ascribed toHermes Trismegistos, Toz Graecus, and Belenus, among which the Liber de xv stel-lis, xv lapidibus, xv herbis, et xv imaginibus ( The Book of Fifteen Stars, Fifteen Stones,and Fifteen Images) is the best known.As a historian of image magic has remarked, “Jese texts do not make for excit-ing reading.”9Jey are usually short, strictly practical, and very systematic pieces.As a rule, they are organized according to the purposes for which the talismans canbe applied, but in some cases their structure follows the sequence of the materialsout of which the talismans are constructed, and occasionally—as it happens in thecase of the Hermetic De imaginibus sive annulis septem planetarum (On the Imagesor Rings of the Seven Planets)—the succession of the celestial bodies with whichthose materials are associated. Each paragraph specifies the material (stone or metal)of the given image, the exact moment and the astrological conditions under whichit is to be prepared, the words to be uttered when creating or burying the figure,and the effects of the talisman. From time to time—as the author of the Speculumrightly noticed—angelic names, orations, and suffumigations are also involved.Jis happens quite explicitly, for example, in Belenus’s De imaginibus septem plan-etarum (On the Images of the Seven Planets), where the preparation of the talis-mans includes the uttering of various charms addressed to the planetary spirits.What might the medieval collectors of these texts have had in mind? What werethe motivations of the scribe copying a given list of talismans: an aversion to blankfolios, or genuine interest in the practice?10While no definite answers can be givento these questions, we can at least underline a common feature of the texts onimage magic: their brevity and the relative ease with which they might be insertedbetween longer texts in a manuscript. What we see on the final pages of a printedbook from Prague can only happen to such short practical talismanic texts. At theend of a printed book from the first years of the sixteenth century that once be -longed to the Franciscans of the monastery of Krumlov, and which included theDe scientia motus orbis (On the Science of the Orb’s Motion) of Messahala and theDe vita libri tres ( Three Books of Life) by Marsilio Ficino bound together, elevenfolios were attached with a rather considerable selection from the bibliography ofimage magic.

Inother cases the scribe’s original intention to copy a text can be obvious; in BAVPal. Lat. 1375, sufficient space is preserved for the full text of Hermes’ De imag-inibus,although the scribe, for unknown reasons, did not finish the transciption.Je neighboring texts are good indicators of the scribe or collector’s intentions.Texts of image magic are usually compiled with practical astrological and astro-nomical works, books of experiments, and lapidaries, which is a telling correlationconcerning the place of talismans in the framework of medieval science. Je cod-icological context leads to the conclusion that scribes “regarded magical images asa potentially legitimate part of natural philosophy, a practical extension of astrol-ogy, an adjunct to lapidaries or alchemical works, or a feature of the natural world.”13While we cannot claim with confidence that the prescriptions for the use of talis-mans were always followed in practice, and that our manuscripts were once usedas handbooks, we still might be able to judge how serious the involvement of thescribes was when incorporating such a text.

Let us start our survey witha most famous manuscript, kept in the Biblioteka Jagiellońska, BJ 793. Jis man-uscript is a typical handbook, a compilation of practically oriented texts arrangedwith great care, supplied with many charts, figures, indices, and cross-referencesin the margins, as well as with special green (a rather rare color in codicology) andred notes helping the reader to find what he is looking for. Large geomantic tablescomposed of point-diagrams help the user to find answers to his questions, and con-centric movable wheel systems provide combinatorial and mnemo technic methodsfor remembering the truth once learned. Je rich variety of circular and quadran -gular figures, mystical characters, and letter-combinations make the handbook visu-ally appealing as well (see figs. 5–10).17Bound together around 1460, this selection comprises common astrological textson the one hand, and treatises of a magical nature belonging mostly to the area ofimage magic on the other.18Je long list of the works starts with texts on nativi-ties and astrological medicine (De urina non visa—On Urine Not Inspected,Deaegritudine—On disease) and continues with considerations on the nature of thesigns of the zodiac and the effects of the moon on human life. So far nothing isexceptionally magical; the codex seems to be one of the many astrological and med-ical items held in the Biblioteka Jagiellońska compiled or written in the fifteenthcentury.

In Cardano, the smallest square belongs to theMoon; while Agrippa,22the Kraków manuscript, and a rather similar Cambridgecopy start with Saturn.23Je composition of the squares differs, too, in the variouscopies of the text. While there is only one arrangement of numbers for constructinga third-order magic square (discounting its mirror images and rotations, obviously),there are 880 ways to make a fourth-order square; and this number increases dra-matically with the larger squares.24Most of these complicated arrangements canbe composed only with the help of a computer, medieval and Renaissance scribescould use only algorithmic methods to construct the simpler squares. As a conse-quence, we often find similar squares in the sources; the fourth-order square of theKraków manuscript, for example, is identical with that of Dürer’s engraving. How-ever, few copies of this text are identical as far as all the seven squares are concerned.While the scribes enjoyed a certain freedom while constructing the squares,some combinations are simply not correct. Jis is the case in the Kraków manu-script with the square of five belonging to the planet Mars and with the square ofnine corresponding to Mercury, where sums of the rows and columns do not alwaysmatch the sum indicated in the text. What is even worse, the same number occursmore than once in some of the squares, violating one of the basic rules of the con-struction—in an nth-order square, each number from 1 to n2may be used onlyonce. Jese errors suggest that the scribe did not really understand the way thenumbers are arranged. At first glance, even stronger statements seem justified: asa historian of magic squares claimed, the scribe of the Kraków text “did not havethe slightest idea how the system was supposed to work, . . . obviously he was copy-ing something that he failed to understand.”25However, if we read the Krakówtext to its end, we will find a paragraph attached to the instructions that explainshow the scribe may double-check at the end whether the construction of a squarewas successful or not.26As the explanations testify, the scribe or the author of thegiven copy was apparently aware that the sum of the numbers should be identicalin every direction, that the largest number occurring in a square is supposed to bethe square of the order of the given square, and also, apparently, that each num-ber is to be used only once. Jis clearly shows that he was familiar with the rulesat least on a theoretical level. Perhaps he failed to apply these rules in practice, buthe certainly had some ideas about the functioning of the system. Either he madethe errors himself, or—more probably—he simply copied what he had in front of92P T: T  H22.

He may have identified the inconsistency, but he probably did not dare to cor-rect any part of the talisman, exactly because a talisman is supposed to work onlyin the form given by the sources.Even though a complicated arithmetical procedure is involved in the construc-tion of such a talisman, the magical content of the squares is not rooted in numerol-ogy; the secret properties of numbers play a relatively small role. Magic resideselsewhere in the procedure. Having inscribed each square on a thin metal plate orcoin, one can reach a number of aims, not all of them harmless. Je figure ofMars, for example, is made for war, battles, and destruction. It is to be engravedon a thin piece of copper in its hour and on its day (which is Tuesday, of course),and then it should be suffumigated with some menstrual blood, or with the cloth-ing of a man hanged or killed with a sword, or—in the event that neither men-strual blood nor such clothing is available—with mouse or cat excrement.27As aresult of these preparations, the talisman is ready to exert its powers: if it is placed ina building, the building will not be inhabited but left deserted, and it can be equallywell used to destroy a business or to cause hatred between two merchants who werefond of each other. And these are just the powers of the figure of Mars engravedon a metal plate and suffumigated appropriately; there are six more talis mans, eachwith its own uses. Je last figure—composed of nine rows, and associ ated with themoon in the Kraków manuscript—for example, if written on parchment and pre-pared according to the instructions, is appropriate against evil and thieves, and itis also good for expelling someone you hate, provided cucumber and watermelonseeds are applied properly in the procedure. Its preparation requires both conjura-tion and suffumigation. For expelling someone from a city, the teaching goes as fol-lows: “And speak thus: May N, the son of N leave, and then name the village or thecity from where he should be chased away, and say that he shall never return to thatcity, village or country.”28Although demons are not named explicitly, this text goestoo far. It contains far too many beheaded cocks, ritual instructions, suffumigations,and conjurations, which leave no doubt that the author of the Speculum astrono-miae, if he had known about it, would have found it intolerable or unnatural.Jese multifunctional planetary seals are followed by the great classic of imagemagic, the De imaginibus by Jebit ben Corat (or as the manuscript calls him,Jebith Benthorath), which is no less ambitious than De septem quadraturis plan-etarum seu quadrati magiciin its claims—as we have seen in Chapter 1.

Being so widespread, the lion as a seal used for medical prac-tice and therapeutic purposes provoked serious concerns in theology. Jean Gerson,the chancellor of the University of Paris, devoted a whole treatise of his series ofpolemical works to the question of this particular talisman. In his Contra supersti-tionem sculpturae leonis (Against the Superstition of the Lion’s Engraving),34heattacked a doctor practicing in Montpellier, who used a seal with the image of thelion for curing renal pains. Je main reason behind his attack on this practice wasthat he suspected an expressed or occult pact with demons in the functioning ofastrological seals. Je philosophical debate, in which Gerson’s intervention was onlyone element, was not the first in the medical circles of Montpellier. Roughly onehundred years earlier, another controversy along the same lines took place, andthis was also the time and the place when and where Jewish doctors introducedthe De duodecim imaginibus Hermetis into medical discourse.35Such an interest inthe talisman with the image of the lion left not only written evidence: a medievalseal kept in the Kunsthistorisches Museum of Vienna depicts the sun in the signof the lion, with the inscription astronomicum sigillum leonis ghoe around it.36Returning now to the contents of BJ 793, the series of talisman descriptions isfollowed by a new thematic section, a set of geomantic texts and tables, which re -inforce our impression that the book was copied for actual use.37Whoever the owner of the codex was, he must have been interested not only inmanipulating the objects of the world by magical procedures, and not only in pre-dicting the future, but also in the conservation of youth (De consideratione quin-tae essentiae—On the Fifth Essence, by Johannes of Rupescissa), in the water oflife (De aqua ardenti—On the Ardent Water),38in the secret power of stones (Delapidibus,attributed to Ptolemy, and the anonymous Lapidarius Mercurii—JeI M95professors of the university as well as shorter hermetic tracts (SLB N. 100, fols. 172r–173r). How-ever, the first paragraph of this text had a tendency to travel separately, and achieved a much widerdissemination. In addition, the whole De duodecim imaginibus Hermetis was also incorporated in thePicatrix;therefore, the same instructions on the seal of the lion circulated in various medieval man-uscripts under three different redactions. As for the Picatrix,see Picatrix, 82–83. Je translation ofthe Picatrix was finished in 1258, but there are good reasons to suppose that the section De duodecimimaginibus Hermetis was inserted only after 1300. Je De duodecim imaginibus is also quoted in fullin Hieronymus Torrella, Opus praeclarum de imaginibus astrologicis non solum medicus verum etiamlitteratis viris utile ac amenissimum (Valencia: Alphonso de Ortu, 1496), fols. miir–miiiv.34.

Je Picatrixwas translated from Arabic into Castil-ian at the court of Alfonso the Wise sometime between 1256 and 1258, and fromCastilian into Latin probably shortly thereafter. It is more than a collection of workson talismanic magic or a simple compilation of recipes. It contains a great varietyof other elements too: theory of science and magic, classification of magic, theoret-ical justification of amulets, prayers to planetary spirits, and methods for constrain-ing demons, not to mention further rituals.40Je circulation of the Picatrix in medieval Europe is by no means ordinary.Although it was translated in the mid-thirteenth century, mysteriously no textualquotation of it can be identified in Latin authors before the humanists, and onlya few of its copies survived from before the second half of the fifteenth century.41One of them is the version preserved in BJ 793. Je first two hundred years ofthis basic handbook of astral magic are practically hidden from our eyes.Earlier extant instances of the Latin Picatrix are without exception short frag-ments and excerpts, and the majority of the copies come from the sixteenth andseventeenth centuries.42Interestingly, one of these fragments happens to be today96P T: T  H39.

It survived in the binding (as fragments usually survive)of an unknown book, and is kept at present in the Literárny Archív in Martin (atown in the present-day Slovak Republic).43While the Kraków copy is the earli-est surviving Picatrix that is longer than a few folios, the Martin copy is one of itsearliest fragments, dating from the fourteenth century. It is possible that the frag-ment has a local origin and was copied somewhere in the region (meaning UpperHungary, or southern Poland). Je binding comes from the Piarists of Podolin(Podolinec), which was part of the historical Szepes County, given by the Hun-garian king Sigismund to Kraków as a mortgage. Can we conclude from this his-torical connection between Upper Hungary and Kraków that there is a connectionbetween the Martin and the Kraków copies of the Picatrix?It is not out of thequestion that the Martin copy was the source for the Kraków codex, though itwould not be easy to prove this connection, especially because the fragment con-tains exactly those parts of the text (the end of book 2 and the beginning of book3) which were not included in BJ 793. At the moment, there is more evidence foran Italian origin for the Kraków text.As it has been mentioned, the Kraków version is unfinished; it contains onlythe first two parts of the Picatrix,including the chapter on the meaning of necro-mancy, the description of images serving various magical purposes (eternal love,destroying cities, expelling snakes, and separating friends), and the chapters on howone can learn the science of images. Although the Prologue promises all four books,the text is interrupted in the middle of chapter 10 of the second.44Before the break,the text describes and the pictures depict the images of the seven planets accord-ing to various different traditions. Je illustrations match the text perfectly.How-ever, after the first figure of the last planet but one, the text breaks off, only theimages are provided, still faithfully depicting what the text—as reconstructed onthe basis of other manuscripts—contains.Now, what is unique in our manuscript, and what brought it worldwide repute,is that although the text stops unexpectedly, the following folios contain the pic-tures of the planetary and decanic figures—just as the text instructs. Jis Krakówmanuscript is the only illustrated Picatrixknown to us; indeed, when illustratinghis critical edition, the editor could not but borrow from this copy of the text (seeI M97fasciculumwith astrological and talismanic material, such as the Pseudo-Albertus Magnus’s Secretum desigillo leonis,and an excerpt from Hermes’s Centiloquium,and these folios were later inserted in a longercodex containing astronomical charts, tables, and celestial coordinate systems (see CBJ,6:252–74).Je third fragment from Martin (not known to Pingree either) is described in the main text.43.

Janks toSimon Stevin’s testimony, it can be claimed with confidence that the frescos of theWawel depicted similar—if not the same—zoomorphic decanic representations asour manuscript. In the history of medieval manuscripts, rarely if ever can the cul-tural impact of one single codex be detected so directly.Je rich pictorial material of BJ 793 also helps us trace its history. Accordingto the art historian, the clothes in the pictures point to the fourth decade of thecentury, depicting the Bohemian style.46In contrast—as it happens—the text edi-tor supposes that the codex was copied from one or several Italian sources.47Jeonly certain fact is that the manuscript was copied by a Polish scribe, because herefers to his Polish environment and also because the codex contains a few texts ofPolish origin, such as the astro-meteorological work on the disposition of the airsby Petrus Gaszowiec, a Polish astronomer-astrologer.48In the absence of any con-crete indication of the owner of the manuscript, we can only speculate about him.On the basis of the character of the collected texts, we can conclude that he was alearned person, probably a professor of the university. If the assumption that thecodex is the copy of an Italian book is correct, then it must have been brought toKraków by one of the many students and professors who had traveled to Italy.According to the most convincing conjecture this person was Petrus Gaszowiec,the author of one of the works inscribed in it, De mutatione aeris (On the Changesof the Air).49Petrus Gaszowiec (before 1430–74) was an astrologer, astronomer, and physician,and served as rector of the University of Kraków on three occasions.50He camefrom a noble family, and was one of the many wandering students of the fifteenthcentury. He received a doctorate in medicine in Perugia (1452–54), continued hismedical studies until 1456 at the University of Cologne, and then returned toKraków just before the creation of the manuscript.

However, mostof the texts are undeniably reproductions of well-known Western writings. Jewhole codex might be viewed as a selection of Gaszowiec’s favorite treatises, eitherbecause they were connected with his own De mutatione aeris, or simply becausehe found them stimulating. In a word, if Gaszowiec was not the owner of this codex,the real author was probably a man of similar background, another master of astron-omy or medicine at the University of Kraków.To sum up, BJ 793 can be seen as a representative handbook of image magic,a good starting point for anyone wishing to familiarize himself with the science oftalismans. In a scientific and astrological context, the scribe included a long list ofdivinatory methods, the classic texts on images. But why did he not choose to in -clude the whole Picatrixin this anthology?Perhaps, consciously or not, he was following the distinction made in theSpeculum astronomiaebetween natural and demonic talismans—that is talismanswhich take their power only from the heavens, and talismans which use demonichelp. Je system of the Speculum was known and to a certain extent adhered toin Kraków. We may recall furthermore that Egidius of Corintia’s booklist deviatedfrom the system of the Speculumon one occasion, when he referred to the Pica-trixas one of the two tolerated and natural texts on image magic.51If we accept that there was a nondemonic understanding of the Picatrixin fifteenth-century Kraków, we will not be surprised by the fact that the scribe of BJ793, while compiling a representative handbook of image magic, included thosesections of the Picatrixwhich contain the general reports on the classification andlearning of magic and the instructions on the preparation and functioning of images,but omitted the third and the fourth books containing the more risky ritual ele-ments: suffumigations of the seven planets and guidelines on how the planetaryspirits and demons should be addressed.While modern secondary literature does not seem to emphasize this differencebetween the first and second half of the Picatrix,a fifteenth-century reader of thetext was apparently aware of it. Je Florentine philosopher Marsilio Ficino, whencompiling the third book of his Liber de vita tres,titled De vita coelitus compa -randa(On Obtaining Life from the Heavens)—which was the most magical in con-tent among the three books—relied heavily on the Picatrix.However, even in theI M10351. Needless to say, the Picatrix does not appear in the classification of the Speculum astronomiae,since it was translated from Arabic into Castilian in 1256–58, just a few years before the Speculumwas written, and although the Latin translation quickly followed the vernacular one, its dissemina-tion—as we have seen—was very slow in the first centuries.03 Chapter 3:Sample.qxd 9/24/2008 11:19 AM Page 103"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Florentine milieu, where Hermetic philosophy gave certain legitimacy to talismanicmagic, the reception of the Picatrixwas not simple. Jere was no problem withthe “natural” explanation for the functioning of talismans—as it is explained inthe second book of the Picatrix,talismans are objects into which the influence ofthe celestial bodies has been introduced—but when more ritual elements emerged,such as suffumigations, orations, and open invocations to spirits, fifteenth-centuryreaders became more ambivalent.Je critical point is exactly where the decans are described, not only because itis exactly around the decanic pictures where the shift of emphasis takes place inthe text of the Picatrix,but also because these strange beings seem to leave the safeterritory of the natural planetary influences and bear too much resemblance toplanetary spirits. And these spirits, not to say demons, apparently require animalsacrifices, suffumigations, invocations, and veneration in exchange for their will-ing cooperation.52Jese features of the decanic spirits are exactly those which theSpeculum astronomiaeviewed as explicit signs of demonic intervention.It seems plausible to suppose that the mid-fifteenth-century scribe of BJ 793 andhis contemporary, Ficino, had fairly similar reservations concerning talismans. Jesereservations—going back to the arguments of the Speculum—account for the factthat Ficino introduces in his book the images of the planets, the images of the zodiac,but abstains—with one single exception—from describing the decanic figures, theso-called faces of the signs. He is—as Frances Yates put it—“not sure whether it isright to use” them. Je same reservations account, I believe, for the sudden endingof the illustrated Picatrixin the Kraków manuscript. Concentrating on planetaryimages and avoiding decanic images, Ficino and the Polish scribe start hesitating atthe same place, and this hesitation is “related to the avoidance of demonic magic.”53O H TJe Latin texts54that comprise medieval Hermetism were attributed to such leg-endary authors as Hermes, Toz Grecus, Belenus, Jessalus, and Kyranus, as well 104P T: T  H52.

Jis group is not to beconfused with the somewhat more celebrated Renaissance Hermetism. Je philo-sophical-religious Renaissance Corpus Hermeticum,translated by Marsilio Ficinofrom the Greek in the fifteenth century, originates in Late Antique Hellenism. Incontrast, the medieval Hermetic texts, which had a stronger accent on pragmaticmaterial, were translated during the twelfth-century renaissance, from the Arabic,mostly by anonymous authors.56Je major part of these tracts is the fruit of nota Late Antique, but a later redaction, produced by a group of Neoplatonizing Ara-bic intellectuals, one of whom was Jābit ibn Qurra, who worked in ninth-centuryBaghdad. Most of the anonymous Arabic authors, however, were not active in Bagh -dad; they were probably ninth-century Sābians, who lived in the town of Harrānat the Upper Euphrates, and who claimed Hermes as their god.57Je philosophersof this town played a crucial role in the history of Arabic science; first, as transla-tors from Greek and Syriac into Arabic, second, as authors of new works on nat-ural philosophy and astral magic, and third, as being responsible for the fusion ofPersian, Syrian, Greek, and Arabic theories of nature. Jese are the Harrānian cos-mological beliefs, their cult of planetary spirits, and the rituals of the Sābian religionthat are mirrored in the medieval Hermetic and pseudo-Aristotelian literature aswell as in the Picatrix,and these elements differ substantially from the HellenisticEgyptian-Greek doctrines on nature, astrology, and Hermes, which re emerged inthe Renaissance.

And we will find that animportant portion of these texts had been copied in Kraków.Je name of Hermes Trismegistos was more than well known to the masters ofthe University of Kraków in the fifteenth century. In a vast number of scientifictreatises, they frequently made reference to Hermes. Quoted in an astronomicaland astrological context, he was first of all a legendary authority, an expert in thefield of astral studies. Along with Ptolemy, Hali, and Guido Bonatus, he was seenas one of the recognized prisci astrologi (ancient astrologers).61His Centiloquiumin particular was frequently quoted, copied, and commented upon in the astro-nomical production of the university.62We have already recorded the success ofHermetic texts belonging to the area of natural magic: the Kyranides,the Com-pendium aureum of Flaccus Aureus, and the Liber de septem herbis ascribed toAlexander the Great. Entering the field of image magic, we should add to this listthe basic compilation on talismans, the Picatrix, which is not strictly speakingHermetic in attribution; however, it incorporates a variety of Hermetic material.63In the following, we will concentrate on the fate and the codicological context ofsome other, less widespread Hermetic or quasi-Hermetic practical texts on imagesthat appear in three manuscripts: the Dresden SLB N. 100, and the Vatican’s BAVPal. lat. 1439 and BAV Pal. lat. 1375.Putting aside for a moment their common talismanic content, there are otherconnections among these codices that reinforce the impression that they belong106P T: T  H59.

About Egidius, the scribe of the Dresden manuscript,virtually nothing is known apart from the fact that he graduated in Kraków.66Johannes Virdung of Hassfurt (ca. 1463–1538), in contrast, left to us a whole libraryof books (kept in the Palatine collection of the Vatican), which not only testify to hisscientific and magical interest, but also contain a number of autobiographical notesthat provide us with a detailed account of his curriculum. Virdung—who becamethe court astrologer of the elector palatine—was a well-known figure of his time,and was often mentioned in the correspondence of his contemporaries.

His works were popular, widely read, and keenlycopied by the students and the professors of the University.

One of them is the unfinished Summa Astrologiae,68vari-ous parts of which can be found in the Dresden and the Vatican manuscripts.69Asfor Gaszowiec’s De mutatione aeris,it is a scientific treatise on the astrological rulesof weather forecasting, dedicated to his professor at the University of Cologne,Gerardus of Hamont. Generally, it seems that any codex containing a copy of Gas-zowiec’s treatise will also contain works on the topic of image magic. Consequently,Gaszowiec’s presence is a good index of magical treatises, while his text itself seemsto be rather “innocent.”70Further astrological and astronomical elements common to the three manuscriptsare the works of Italian (Johannes Bianchini)71and Central European (JohannesRegiomontanus, Georgius Peurbach, Albertus of Brudzewo) astrologers, the Sphaeraof Johannes Sacrobosco, texts by Guido Bonatus, and some treatises on the com-position of astrolabes that were important readings in the Kraków curriculum.Both BAV Pal. lat. 1439 and SLB N. 100 contain an astrological text attrib uted toHermes, the Liber de stellis beibeniis(Book on the Fixed Stars),72translated intoLatin by Salio of Padua,73which is a traditional treatise on the qualities of persons108P T: T  H68.

(For a visually expressive accounton the comparison of the manuscripts, I recommend consulting the comparativetable in Appendix 2.)After this digression on the parallel structure, codicological context, and histor-ical background of the manuscripts, we finally turn to the texts on the operativetalismans they contain. Let us start our examination with a rare tract on the mag-ical use of Scandinavian characters, the Liber runarum ( The Book of Runes).77JeLiber runarum explains how to write the names of the spiritual forces of certainplanets in a cryptic alphabet, the letters of which are called runaeby the author.Je names constructed from these clearly recognizable runes carry magical power.Je complete versions of the text go fairly deep into the field of astral magic and givedetailed directions on how to inscribe the angelic names on the metals and stonesassociated with every planet.78Such practices are, of course, based on the idea thateach planet has a spirit through whom it influences the objects of the lower realms.I M10974.

Jereare finally some very interesting pages on astrological magic, which explain how to find hidden orstolen objects by looking at the ascendant and following a detailed set of instructions (pp. 229–35).Je codex was copied and occasionally commented on by a certain Clemens of Piotrkow, again astudent who graduated from Kraków (in 1473).

Je first study on mag-ical runes occurring in a Hermetic context was written by Charles Burnett, “Scandinavian Runes ina Latin Magical Treatise. Postscript by M. Stoklund,” Speculum58 (1983): 419–29; reprinted inBurnett, Magic and Divination, VIII. In his source (Sloane 3854, a manuscript of Italian origin, nowin the British Library), the Liber runarumseemed to be an appendix of the Liber antimaquis qui estliber secretorum Hermetis.Later, however, three more—actually longer—copies of the Liber runarumnot associated with the Liber antimaquis were found, one in Vienna (ÖNB Cod. lat. 12834, fols.1r–6r), and two in our two codices in question: BAV Pal. lat. 1439, fols. 346r–347v, and SLB N.100, fols. 198r–200v.78.Liber runarum,444–45: “Habitis nominibus spirituum planetarum, videndum est quomodoipsa nomina metallis sive lapidibus planetis attributis insculpi debeant per figuras, ita quod naturefigurarum sequantur se ad invicem sicut et signa et triplicitates.” SLB N. 100, fol. 199v; BAV Pal.lat. 1439, fol. 346v.

We are told that if one wants to operatewith the power of the planets, he has to inscribe the name of the appropriate angelson the proper metal, and invoke the angels and ask them for help to achieve thegiven aim—which is, obviously, in the case of Venus talismans, winning the love ofanother.79Je list of runes corresponding to their planets and angels appear next tothe main body of the text, and in the case of the Vatican manuscript, they also appearon a rota runarum,which is copied quite separately, one hundred and fifty foliosbefore the main text (for the runes, see figs. 15 and 16; for the rota,see fig. 17).80Je originality of the Liber runarum does not consist in the magical use of Scan-dinavian characters. Revealed to the Scandinavians by the god Odin, runes weregenerally believed to have sacred power and occult virtues. Jese magic signs wereoften applied on talismans, amulets, and on all sorts of other objects and writtensources from the early Middle Ages onward.81In a peculiar German manuscriptfrom the late fifteenth century, runic characters are used extensively for transcribingvarious names and notions of the medical, divinatory, prognostic, and occasionallydemonic, material of the book. Apart from the content of the manuscript, how-ever, the magic of the runes also lies in their cryptographic application. In a demonicinvocation written in normal German, for example, those terms which are sup-posed to remain secret are spelled in runes. If we decipher them, we will see thatthese terms include the most dangerous names of the devil to be invocated, suchas boes geist(malign spirit), diabolo diaboliczno, satana sataniczno,and the majorperformative terms, such as kum her zuo mir.82But the author of the Liber runarum went beyond simply using runes as a secretalphabet; he offered a unique combination of Scandinavian runes with Hermetic ele-ments. Not only did he use runes to refer to planetary angels, he also applied them110P T: T  H79.Liber runarum,447: “Nunc restat dare exempla sculpturarum ex premissis, et ego nonponam nisi unum, scilicet de Venere, secundum quod poteris per quamlibet planetarum, sicut pre-dictum est, operari si volueris.

Another, less patient medieval report on the Liber runarum is written by Johannes Trithemius(1462–1516), who, in his Antipalus Maleficiorum,refers to it as a vain and superstitious text. I amgrateful to Paolo Lucentini for calling my attention and giving me access to this rare edition. IanusBusaeus, ed., Paralipomena opusculorum Petri Blesensis et Joannis Trithemii aliorumque(Mainz: Bal -thasar Lippius, 1605), 299: “Item est alius liber de compositione nominum atque characterum malig-norum sprituum, similiter vanus et superstitiosus, cuius nomen autoris non inveni, et sic incipit. Adhabendum scientiam, experimentum.” Je text has recently been edited by Paola Zambelli, “Pseu -depigrafia e magia secondo l’abate Johannes Trithemius,” in Marchetti, Rignani, and Sorge, Ratio etSuperstitio, 347–68.88. See Lucentini’s introduction to the Liber runarum, in Bos et al., Hermes Trismegistus,406–7,for descriptions of L-PC 70–73, 64–66, and 76–78.to Arabic and Hebrew spirit names, and thus he extended the principles of astralmagic to encompass the sacred qualities of the runic alphabet.83As Charles Burnettwrote about the anonymous author, “It must have been a rare person who couldcombine a knowledge of the runic alphabet with the oriental secrets of Hermes.”84Strictly speaking, however, the Liber runarumis not a Hermetic treatise; it doesnot contain the usual attribution either to Hermes, or to Belenus and Toz Graecus,and what is more, instead of being a translation from Arabic, it seems to be a Latinproduct probably inspired by the Hermetic writings. Nevertheless, it occurs gen-erally in the company of basic Hermetic texts: in a London manuscript it appears asan appendix of the Hermetic Antimaquis,while in the Dresden and Vatican codicesit was copied next to the Liber de stellis beibeniis.85In addition, the Liber runarumis mentioned together with other Hermetic texts on talismans in the apology forimage magic found in PNK VIII G 27, a Prague manuscript discussed in Chap-ter 1 in connection with medieval taxonomies of magic texts.86Je tract on theuse of Scandinavian runes is one of those texts the author defends as falsely con-sidered necromantic by ignorant posterity.87Besides the Liber runarum,he namesthree other Hermetic works also unjustly slandered: the Liber lunae,the Liber deimaginibus et horisof Hermes, and the Liber de imaginibus diei et noctis of Belenus.88It is striking that half of the four extant sources of the Liber runarum,namely,the Dresden and the Vatican manuscripts, were copied in Kraków. On the groundsof philological proofs—common errors, wording, and spelling forms—it can beshown that the versions in these two manuscripts were copied from the same source,while the two other versions are more distant relatives. Indeed, the table in Appen-dix 2 reveals a very strong connection between them. If we compare one specificpage of the list of runes in the two codices, it will be obvious that although thehandwriting is different, the setting of the graphic elements and the arrangement03 Chapter 3:Sample.qxd 9/24/2008 11:19 AM Page 114"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"I M115of the inserted words appear in a completely parallel structure.89Furthermore,although both scribes promise to give only one single example at the end of thetext,90unlike the two other copyists they add in fact four instances of invokingplanetary angels, using practically the same words. Such small details91make itcertain that these two students of the university copied their codices around 1487–88 from each other, or, what is more likely, from a common source, which seemsto have been an astrological-magical handbook circulating among the Krakówstudents.Je interest in technical Hermetism attested by one of these scribes, JohannesVirdung of Hassfurt, can be further demonstrated by the third codex under inves-tigation, BAV Pal. lat. 1375. Like BAV Pal. lat. 1439, Virdung copied this one inKraków in 1488 when he was a student at the university. Its content is also quitesimilar: classics of astrology and astronomy, planetary tables, and descriptions ofastronomical devices. Since the exploration of Virdung’s scholarly and magical careerand his concern with magic will be the focus of another chapter, here we will con-centrate only on a few folios of this manuscript.BAV Pal. lat. 1375 contains four, similarly structured tracts on talismanic magic,two of which are clearly Hermetic, one ascribed directly to Hermes, the other toBelenus.92Je Hermetic one, De imaginibus sive annulis septem planetarum—whichwe will remember as having been found abominable by the author of the Specu-lum—is in its complete version a systematic description in seven paragraphs ofhow the magician is to prepare a talismanic ring for each of the seven planets, usingthe metal and the precious stone associated with that planet.93An image, describedin detail in the manuscript, is to be engraved on the stone, or occasionally in themetal, in order to make the talisman capable of certain magical goals that are alwaysin harmony with the well-known properties of the given planet.94Je version of89.

Comparing this versionwith other surviving examples of the same two paragraphs, we find that Hassfurt’stext places more emphasis on the astrological circumstances of the fabrication of thering, but makes no mention of which gems to use for the sun and the moon.Jis tract is preceded by a work of a virtually identical title that the author ofthe Speculum should have found even more abominable had he known it: the Deimaginibus septem planetarum, attributed this time to Belenus (or as the manuscriptcalls him, Belemith).95Jis text, occupying one folio in the manuscript,96onceagain follows the order of planets as an organizational principle, and indicates thehour in which each talisman should be prepared, as well as the materials of whichit is to be made. Unlike the previous text, it contains explicit ritual elements, cer-tain actions should be performed “cum flexis genibus” (with bent knees), while suf-fumigations, orations, and summonses to planetary spirits are also involved.97Jeaims are the usual ones of image magic: to appear powerful in battle with the helpof a talisman of Mars; to retain a woman’s love with the help of a talisman of Venus;to make someone appear abominable with the help of a talisman of Saturn, andso on. Je novelty here is that the name of the person on whom the benign ormalign effect of the spirits should be exercised is to be written on the image. Je textends with a list of the “ymagines et karacteres planetarum” (the planets’ imagesand characters), consisting of an alphabet of magical signs (not runes this time)most of which is crossed out and made unreadable by a later hand in the Vaticanmanuscript (see the partial copy of BAV Pal. lat. 1375, fol. 270v, on fig. 18). Jiscaution is not surprising; the characters are most powerful. As the text instructs,they play a rather crucial role in the functioning of the talismans, being the chieffactors of constraining the spirits of the planets.Much longer sets of the same magical characters—crossed out again—may befound in the third of our four texts under study, the Liber de spiritibus inclusis ( The Book of Enclosed Spirits).

A whole world of correspondences can be inferred fromit. After a short and general description of what is common in the methods of fabri -cation of the seven planetary rings, the text—rather economically, in a three-columntable—indicates the specific ingredients to be used and the special instructions tobe followed in order to create each ring. Under each planet the author lists, inorder, the animal to be sacrificed, the material to be suffumigated, the metal of whichthe ring is to made, the figure to be engraved on the ring (which are similar tothose described in the tenth chapter of book two of the Picatrix), the character ofthe planet (later crossed out), and a list of exorcisms of the spirits to be invoked.Je names of the spirits seem to be angels’ names and greatly resemble the names 18De imaginibus septem planetarumby Belenus: karacteres planetarum.

Fortunately, it can be identifiedwith an item in Johannes Trithemius’s contemporary bibliography of necromancy,the Antipalus Maleficiorum:“And there is also the Liber prestigiorum [Book of Tal-ismans] of a certain Jomas, in which miraculous things are promised to be pro-duced from rings constructed in characters according to the eight mansions of themoon and with vain fumigations, and which starts like this: ‘Ego Jomas omniumscientiarum amator. . .’ [I, Jomas, friend of all sciences . . .].”101Much like theothers, it describes the making of talismanic rings, and calls for various invocationsand rituals (certain actions are to be performed with “bent knees” as usual), but itis less systematic than the previous works discussed.What is remarkable is that Trithemius names exactly these texts: the De imaginibusseptem planetarum of Belenus,the De imaginibus sive annulis septem planetarum ofHermes,the work on talismans of “magister Jomas,” and the Liber de spiritibusinclusis by an anonymous author, “whose name—says Trithemius—I did not find.”102Of the last two, we have only the copies found in Virdung’s manuscript. From whereTrithemius might have known these texts (and the equally rare Liber runarum), allpresent in his friend’s library, is a question that cannot be entirely answered. Je twowere friends, but the incipits provided by Trithemius for these works do not com-pletely correspond with the initial sentences of the versions in Virdung’s codex. Onthe other hand, it is most unlikely that Trithemius and Virdung were interested inthe same talismanic texts independently. As we will see in detail in Chapter 9, theytook ample opportunity to discuss various magical issues, and thus we can take itfor granted that they did not abstain from consulting each other’s library.It is time, however, to return to the initial themes: that of the Vatican codex inparticular, and that of medieval operative Hermetism in general. To sum up the03 Chapter 3:Sample.qxd 9/24/2008 11:19 AM Page 118"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"I M119available evidence, we can claim with confidence that just as BJ 793 represents areliable handbook of image magic, BAV Pal. lat. 1375 incorporates a good selec-tion of readings from a somewhat narrower category, that of Hermetic talismans.If we look at the extant texts of Hermetic image magic, we can see a rather strangephenomenon. Because most of our copies of Hermetic texts are from the fifteenthcentury, it seems that the dissemination of the medieval texts ascribed to Hermesis contemporary with the rise of RenaissanceHermetism. Although the texts be -longing to these two realms are different in nature and orientation, the new concernraised by the humanists and particularly by Ficino might have indirectly encour-aged the copying of the texts of the Arabic Hermes in the late fifteenth century. Afew decades later, however, the picture changed, and Hermetism started to gain a more philosophical sense, the meaning given by Ficino.103For example, in hisanthol ogy compiled in the opening years of the sixteenth century, Bernard of Lub -lin included extracts from the Asclepiusand certain elements of the Pimanderfromthe Ficinian Corpus Hermeticum,together with parts of Plato’s dialogues, translatedagain by Ficino, and some works by Aristotle.104Both the texts individually andthe character of the anthology as a whole demonstrate a preference for the syn-cretic and the theoretical in keeping with the Renaissance and quite different fromthe late medieval interest in operative Hermetism. Similarly, King Matthias of Hun-gary did not include practical tracts of image magic in his library, but—partly asa consequence of his correspondence with Ficino himself—he was more open tothe newly translated works of Renaissance philosophical Hermetism.105As a resultof these changes, the word “Hermetism” (used sometimes in the form “Hermeti-cism”) became synonymous with a post-Ficinian, religious-philosophical preoc-cupation with the originally Greek corpus of Hermes Trismegistos, and lost slowlyits association with the Arabic-medieval Hermes.T T   SWe have the clues we need to reconstruct the interest in Hermetism and operativetalismans in the university circles of Kraków. Relying on the evidence examined,it seems that—at least for some students of the university—this interest was neither103.

Even though the texts of Hermetic image magic are ofteninserted in the space left blank between longer scientific treatises, and occur usu-ally in the last quarter of the manuscripts, this rule has more to do with the natureand shortness of the talismanic texts than with a lack of interest and respect. Inmany cases (such as for example in BJ 793), long continuous sections were devotedto image magic, which became an organic element of the composition of the codex.In other cases (BAV Pal. lat. 1375, for example) a folio is deliberately left blankfor the second part of a Hermetic text on talismans, and whatever the reason wasfor the omission of this part, apparently it did not follow the original intention.Je scattered, sporadic arrangement is most explicit in the Dresden manuscript;however, in this case, the inclusion of works about talismans in the codex is clearlya result of the coherent curiosity of its scribe. He copied (or perhaps rather, wrote)a short notice on magical arts, with the intention of helping the reader in the ori-entation, in which—as we have discussed in Chapter 1—he attested a deep famil-iarity with the text of the Speculum astronomiae,he seemed to have consulted agreat range of Hermetic and Solomonic magical books, and finally, he referred tothe Picatrix as a work of image magic.Before closing this chapter on the texts of image magic, one last point is to beaddressed on a more general level. What could be the place of this category of magicin the conceptual framework of those scientists who filled their codices with thesetexts? Where did they put Jebit’s De imaginibus,Hermes’ invocations of spirits,and the Picatrixon their bookshelves? Did they consider the works on operativetalismans to be at the same level of reality as the astronomical and scientific tractsof the same manuscripts?Je question is obviously not whether medieval people generally took talismansseriously, because the answer to that question would be a simple “yes.” Various piecesof pictorial evidence depicting powerful objects hanging from the neck or carriedelsewhere on the body, and a large number of talismans, amulets, and rings—con-taining stones, teeth, crosses, shells, hair and bones, and other herbal and animalmaterials—have survived from medieval times,106indicating that people in the Mid-dle Ages—just as today—constructed and used talismans. Jese objects are ofteninscribed with numbers, letters, and sacred characters, or engraved with images(mag ical circles, squares, stars, and demonic figures) and seem to indicate an actualapplication of the teachings of Jebit, Hermes, the Picatrix,and other texts onimage magic.However, this well-documented fact does not answer the initial question; while03 Chapter 3:Sample.qxd 9/24/2008 11:19 AM Page 120"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"I M121it is obvious that people used talismans with a general assumption that these objectswould protect them, we may still ask ourselves whether university students and pro-fessors could have believed that a given image, engraved and suffumigated prop-erly, might function in specific cases too. Did they believe, for example, that itreally served for the destruction of a given city, the defeat of a given army, or thefailure of a given business in a well-defined moment?Literature might have provided certain legitimization for image magic. Togetherwith the instructions on the creation of talismans, the Latin Middle Ages importedremarkable stories about the actual use of images from the Arabs. Je commen-tary of Haly on the ninth sentence of Pseudo-Ptolemy’s Centiloquium(a text thataccompanied the hundred aphorisms most of the time) tells of a soldier who alsohad the fame of a sage, and who knew the nature of stones and herbs very well.Janks to his expertise, this soldier-savant saved the life of a person stung by a scor-pion, with the help of a golden ring with a Bezoar stone in which a picture of thescorpion was engraved. Upon inquiry he was ready to explain in which hour andunder what constellation he prepared this ring.107Another story, related to the per-son of Jābit ibn Qurra himself, involves the intervention of personal planetaryspirits and the use of powerful talismans against the ill will of enemies, for makingoneself invisible, and also for acquiring marvelous powers of sight.108Nevertheless, it seems logical to suppose that for the medieval reader these oldArabic stories were as fabulous, and as difficult to credit, as they are for a modernaudience. Jis is why certain anecdotes written in the Latin world at the end ofthe fourteenth century deserve serious attention, and may shed more light on whatthe scribe may have had in mind. Jese anecdotes have a surprisingly similar con-tent to that of the Arabic stories, involving the application of images for expellingenemies from kingdoms, cities, and castles.109Je difference is that they are toldby a contemporary Italian author (living in France actually), who situates the sto-ries in a “modern,” that is, late medieval, context, and does not claim to have recy-cled them from ancient mythical reports.110Je events of the first story are relatedto Jomas of Pizan living in the second half of the fourteenth century, father ofthe famous Christine of Pizan, and doctor of astrology and medicine in the serviceof the French king, Charles V.

Although we will return on a morephilosophical level to the questions of applicability, success, and failure of the dif-ferent magical procedures in our conclusion, we should accept for the time beingthat talismanic texts in the Middle Ages were copied with the assumption that theywere applicable, and also that talismans were usually believed to possess not onlya general protective power, but also concrete efficacy that could be put into oper-ation in specific, say military, cases.03 Chapter 3:Sample.qxd 9/24/2008 11:19 AM Page 122"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"D: D  A\u0011e term “divination” will be used to denote the procedure of foretelling the futureand discovering hidden knowledge through the interpretation of signs.1\u0011ese signsmight be at one’s disposal in several ways. In many cases, they are written some-where in the natural world, most often encoded on various zones of the body. \u0011us,among the popular divinatory techniques, we find the reading of the lines on thepalms of human hands—this art being called palmistry or chiromancy—as well asthe interpretation of the signs occurring in particular divisions of a sheep’s shoul-der blades (scapulimancy).2\u0011e justification of such divinatory procedures is thatGod created a world of universal correspondences, in which, through the interre-lation and necessary connection of all things, future events and hidden secrets mightbe revealed by deciphering various indications.3In other cases, the signs are generated artificially by the inquirer himself—or per-haps herself, since we are speaking of widespread techniques, not privileged by writ-ten culture, and equally present in folk beliefs. \u0011is happens in the art of sortilegium1. A wider understanding of divination is also possible. Laurens Pignon, for example, in his fifteenth-century Contre les devineurs, includes a wide range of magical practices besides the interpre-tation of signs in order to reveal future and occult phenomena. \u0011is particularly wide category ofdivination involves every kind of prognostication, judicial astrology, practices of ritual magic, invo-cation of demons, and the use of stones, herbs, and words for curing diseases. Pignon seems tounderstand divination as a synonym for magic and superstition in general. See Veenstra, Magic andDivination.2. For this latter practice, see Charles Burnett, “Scapulimancy (Divination by the Shoulder-bladesof Sheep),” in Burnett, Magic and Divination,XII, 1–14, and “Arabic Divinatory Texts and CelticFolklore: A Comment on the \u0011eory and Practice of Scapulimancy in Western Europe,” ibid., XIII,31–42.3.

Halfway between thenaturally and the artificially created codes, we find a form of divination that oper-ates with the numerical value of human names. In this case, the signs are rootedto a certain extent in the human will (that of the name giver), but are indepen-dent of the actual conditions of the inquirer. Gazing into crystal balls (crystallo-mancy) and other ways of scrying (such as catoptromancy, that is, divination bymeans of a mirror) are also frequently listed as branches of divination. However,since these practices rely on much more sophisticated rules, and—unlike the pre-vious forms of divination—they use spiritual aid explicitly, they will be discussedseparately.Divination was considered a distinct category of magic; it was usually treated,classified, and eventually condemned in distinct tracts. When looking for the medi -eval secondary literature on divination, we do not turn to Augustine or Williamof Auvergne. Neither is it helpful to read Isidore or Hugh of Saint Victor. Eventhough these latter authors listed the methods of divination according to the fourelements (geomancy, hydromancy, aeromancy, and pyromancy), they rather reliedon Classical authors (Cicero and Varro) than on actual practice or concrete texts.4For a more realistic and detailed description of divinatory techniques, we haveto wait for the later Middle Ages, when discourse on divination became more differentiated. An instructive source is Das půch aller verpoten kunst by the earlyfifteenth-century author, Johannes Hartlieb (ca. 1400–1468).5Hartlieb wrote hishandbook between 1456 and 1464 in Munich, and described the divinatory meth-ods of the seven forbidden arts—geomancy, hydromancy, aeromancy, pyromancy,chiromancy, scapulimancy, and necromancy—in great detail, illustrating his descrip-tions with exhaustive reports on concrete practices. In his categorization, Hartliebwent back to a text of an alumnus of Prague University, Nicolaus Magni of Jawor(d. 1435), who had written a treatise on superstitions (Tractatus de superstitionibus)while living in Heidelberg.6124P T: T  H4.

Obtain-ing knowledge of hidden and future things that are known only to God requiresthe implicit or explicit help of the devil; and therefore, theologians felt obliged todepict divination as a most dangerous and demonic practice. Etienne Tempier, inthe prologue of his famous condemnations in 1277, explicitly condemned a geo-mantic tract, the Estimaverunt Indi ( The Indians Estimated), rejecting it togetherwith books containing necromancy and invocations of demons.7It is worth mentioning that the fourteenth chapter of the Speculum astronomiae,devoted solely to the problem of prognostications, was somewhat more ambigu-ous. It did not condemn categorically all kinds of interrogation concerning whethersomeone is alive or dead, or whether rumors are true or false; as far as they con-cern the truth already determined, these queries are acceptable. And even thoseinterrogations which concern contingent things subject to free will, queries thatdo not seek for advice but want to learn facts about the future are compatible withfree will, just as divine providence is reconcilable with it. Still, after this apology fordivination, the author admits that these methods aim at learning those things thatGod wanted to keep hidden from our eyes; and therefore, this art is not to be fol-lowed. ( The author speaks primarily about astrological prognostications, but thetheological concerns he raises are similar in the case of other genres of divination.)8Despite such tolerant views, the rather unanimous negative attitude of theol-ogy toward the art of divination exercised such an influence on medieval codicesthat divinatory techniques copied on the folios were often later rendered unread-able by pious hands. In a manuscript from Kraków (BJ 551), for example, a shortLatin text of palmistry and a picture of a human hand are thoroughly crossed out(fig. 19), while on the previous folios we find various magical recipes in Latin andGerman, among them a text that belongs to the tradition of the Ars notoriaandinvolves explicit invocations to spirits.

But he made more hands than he needed, and the last couple of palmsare left blank.19An odd case of “chiromancy” can be found in another of Virdung’s codices,copied when he still resided in Kraków (BAV Pal. lat 1375). On a folio, just belowa set of geomantic figures there is a circle filled with numbers and notes (fig. 21).20\u0011is circle and the text belonging to it have a title, ciphered in secret letters. For-tunately, with the help of alphabets scattered throughout the manuscript that showthe corresponding real and secret characters (fig. 22, for example),21we can deci-pher it: “Hec est operacio ciromancie” [\u0011is is the operation of chiromancy]. Weshould be careful not to believe immediately what this title declares: the circularfigure is a divinatory device indeed, but it has nothing to do with the figures of thehuman hand; it operates with the numerical value of names, and indicates whetherthe person inquiring about his own fate will die or recover from his illness. It canbe equally well used for any other issue that might have a positive or negative out-come, such as a battle, an examination, a marriage, or any other enterprise. \u0011enumerical equivalents for each letter are arranged in a circle, where it was possibleto find the numerical value of the name of the client. \u0011is value is then subjectedto a series of mathematical operations, the result of which we should find eitherin the upper or in the lower hemisphere of the inner part of the circle: if it is inthe upper part, the patient will survive (the length of his recovery being determinedby the column in which the number occurs), but if it is in the lower part, he willdie (sooner or later, depending again on the column). \u0011is diagrammatic deviceof onomancy (divination based on the numerical value of someone’s name) is usu-ally attributed to Pythagoras or Apollonius; as a matter of fact, the Latin text of theVatican manuscript copied by the circle gives a proper title: “Hec est spera Pythagoreplatonici quam descripsit Apollonius in libro ethicorum” [\u0011is is the Sphere of theplatonic Pythagoras which Apollonius describes in his books of ethics]. \u0011is—obvi-ously false—attribution could have seemed quite plausible in the Middle Ages:Pythagoras was famous for the numerological nature of his philosophy, and thetheory that numbers (or numerical values of letters) might correspond to aspects ofreality appeared as a residue of the Pythagorean worldview.22\u0011us, the Sphere of130P T: T  H19.

Skeat puts it, books of fate are simply“systems comprising a fixed table of specific questions with a fixed number of alter-native answers to each question.”29Let us finally take a look at a codex in which pieces belonging to the genre ofsortesliterature appear in great concentration: an early fifteenth-century Hungarianmanuscript currently kept in Munich.30\u0011e greater part of this codex is taken upby Guido of Columna’s Historia Destructionis Troiae (History of Troy’s Destruction),which is followed by a medical and a divinatory division, both of them composedof several short pieces.31\u0011e opening piece of the first, medical, section is titledRegimen sanitatis (Health Regimen), and it is an abstract of the “De conservationecorporis” (On the Conservation of the Body) chapter of the Arabic version of thePseudo-Aristotelian Secretum secretorumtranslated by John of Seville in the twelfthcentury.

Wheels were subsequently used to represent the cyclesof months and seasons, to calculate the date of movable ecclesiastical feasts, and alsoas a pedagogical tool for visualizing the order and the orbit of planets. Combina-tions were easily expressible in circular form too; certain rotaehelped determinethe validity of a syllogism; the combinatory wheels of the Catalan philosopher,Raimundus Lullus, functioned as thinking automata, generating new combinationsof letters and concepts, and ultimately directing the user to new theories and truths.Finally, a special case of visual aids arranged the text itself in a tabular or chartform. \u0011is could happen with the intention of visualizing, for example, the com-bination of the four elements of which the whole world is constructed, or simplyfor didactic purposes in a table of contents, or by listing the major points and head-ings of a text.40Magic texts applied virtually the same diversity of diagrams and figures, oftenwith similar purposes: for facilitating the understanding of a method, for didacti-cism, for the representation of combinations and the classification of the elementsof an area, for helping to memorize the material, or—an objective unknown inscientific handbooks—for meditative purposes. In the following paragraphs, weare not going to deal with those pictorial representations which possess a certainartistic value—such as the pictures of the planetary spirits in the Kraków Picatrix,and the colorful illuminations of Conrad Kyeser’s Bellifortis—discussed in the pre-vious chapters; instead, we will concentrate on figures and diagrams that are usu-ally less artistically elaborated and often left without mention by the catalogs, andwhich, nevertheless, play an essential role in magical procedures.136P T: T  H39.

It is worth adding, however, thatfor the mere functioning of this procedure, the figure would not necessarily needto be a circle; as a matter of fact the same method is sometimes presented in a non-circular form, the tetragonus subjectus.45Nevertheless, onomantic circles were muchmore widespread and perhaps more appealing throughout the Middle Ages thantetragonal figures of name magic.A special subclass of pictorial elements within the literature of magic is the alpha-bet of secret letters, which might be applied not only as a cryptographic means,but also to designate spirits.

Magical circles—frequently appearing in modern literature andfilms—are the most famous tools from the inventory of the magician who wishesto invoke demons. \u0011ese circles serve to protect him from the harmful intentionsof the spirits, provided, of course, that in or around the circle he draws the othernecessary elements, such as angelic names, swords, pentagrams, and various astro-nomical characters correctly. Unfortunately, apart from one single small magic ringin a Prague manuscript (fig. 25), this particular inventory item does not figure inany medieval Central European manuscript, and therefore we shall not go into moredetail here.52\u0011e other subbranch of ritual magic, the notory art, attributes a completely dif-ferent significance to diagrams. \u0011e notae,as its geometrical figures and charactersare called, are not just auxiliary elements of the rituals. A set of diagrams of cir-cular, triangular, and tree forms are assigned to each branch of learning. \u0011ese notaenot only serve to represent the links between the different elements of the text, butalso function as visual aids for meditation, through which the operator is able tocommunicate with the celestial powers. \u0011is twofold operation corresponds to thedouble intentions of the notory art: it promises to provide knowledge of all theliberal arts, while offering a means of communication with the spirits. None of thefew Central European examples of the Ars notoriais supplied with notae,and con-sequently we will not concern ourselves more with this issue.53But before we leave the notae for good, a third function of theirs deserves moreattention, because it leads us closer to the functioning of scientific and magicaldiagrams. \u0011e geometrical arrangement of the elements of the main text of the Arsnotoriain these figures might have helped the operator to remember the detailswhen he tried to reconstruct the structure of the procedure without having hishandbook in his hands. Hence, it is not a pure coincidence that the work knownas the Ars notoriaoften appeared with the title Ars memorativa.In a parallel way,the use of arboresand rotae in all kinds of scientific and magical literature had muchto do with the art of memory in a culture when the importance of rememberingplayed a different and more fundamental role than it has since the invention of print-ing.

Observing the general tendencies in the tradition of diagrams, wesee that they often lost their links to the texts that explained their functioning:they started a new and independent life on the folios of manuscripts. It is hard toexplain how those charts and circles were used when the scribes copied them with-out the quite complicated textual instructions. One can only speculate whetherthe methods were so well known that the explanations were seen as superfluous,whether the figures could be reproduced in an easier way from memory than fromthe accompanying texts, or—a third option—whether darkness and mystificationformed such a crucial element of divinatory methods that the lack of instructionswas only one of the elements that rendered the actual employment of the diagramsdifficult. Whichever answer we choose, it seems that the history of pictorial rep-resentations in magic is related to, but not subject to, the history of magical texts.Pictures and diagrams can teach us something about which the texts are usu-ally silent. \u0011ey provide us with information to a certain extent whether the givenmagical text was used or simply copied. \u0011e difference is crucial. We are very wellaware that from the mere presence of a specific magical text in a collector’s librarynot much can be concluded about his interest in magic or his secret practices. \u0011eproblem has not changed much since the Middle Ages. No one could correctlyreconstruct my scientific interest merely on the basis of the books that can befound in my private library. What does it mean, for example, that a book on prac-tical astrology on my bookshelf is in the company of a work of German literature?Does that mean that I like reading about astrology? Does it mean that I even prac-tice it occasionally? Did I receive this book as a present for my birthday? Can therebe any conclusions drawn from what other books occur in its immediate vicinity?Was it situated in the context of German literature with some specific purpose?Or is it there just by chance? It would be rather hazardous to give any answer with-out directly asking me, the owner of the given volumes.In medieval manuscripts, of course, we have a few more external indicationsthat may help us answer these questions. Among such indications is the fact thatcopying two texts beside each other reveals a stronger association than simply put -ting them on the same shelf, not to mention that copying something by our ownhands shows a deeper commitment than simply buying a book. Still, difficulties142P T: T  H54. See John B.

Extensive use of divinatory tables and charts in a manuscript that is full ofcross-references and indications in the margins seem to testify that the given scribeprepared his book with the definite purpose of concrete use, that is, foretelling thefuture. Copying prognostic diagrams without including their instructions seems toimply an operator who is skilled or experienced enough to use the diagram with-out referring to the instructions. Sketching thirty human hands for the purpose ofcollecting chiromantic information from other handbooks is equally a sign of activeinterest.In other cases, the attempt to destroy a figure, not the figure itself, may be ofrelevance. Crossing out spirit names spelled in secret characters is a telling indica-tion of the conviction that such signs possess hidden powers of unpredictable anddangerous effect. Making a text of palmistry unreadable and leaving the adjacentangelic invocations undamaged refers to the fear that the actual use of divinationby another reader was a real possibility.All in all, it seems that the visual material scattered in the magical texts, evenmore than the codicological context of the same texts, helps us reconstruct a cer-tain interest in operative talismans and divinatory procedures. It is obvious that—at least for some book owners—this interest was neither secondary nor acciden-tal. \u0011ese examples provide insight into the readership and impact of the magicalliterature. \u0011ese pieces of evidence show a manifest and active magical concern bythe readers and owners, who apparently used these books, followed the instruc-tions they read in them, or wanted to hinder other readers from following theseinstructions by eliminating certain elements of the rituals. \u0011e presence of the tal-ismanic and divinatory material on the folios of these codices reveals a strongercommitment to using them than their accidental presence on a bookshelf.D  D14304 Chapter 4:Sample.qxd 9/24/2008 11:20 AM Page 143"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"T A M\u000ee text of the Holy Mass opens with the following, startling announcement meantto be sung to the tune of the Gaudeamus: “\u000ee basis of the Art is the dissolutionof the bodies.” A few lines later, a Kyrie follows: “Our Lord, fount of goodness,inspirer of the sacred art, from whom all good things come to your faithful, havemercy. Christ, Holy one, blessed stone of the art of the science, who for the sal-vation of the world hast inspired the light of science, for the extirpation of theTurk, have mercy.

Indeed, the text, the beginning of which we have just quoted, was notissued by the church authorities but from an entirely different source. A mysteriousauthor from early sixteenth-century Transylvania, Nicolaus Melchior Cibinensis,found this most religious and rather unusual literary genre for elaborating hisideas on alchemical science. His Processus sub forma missae (Process in the Form ofthe Mass), dedicated to Wladislas, king of Hungary and Bohemia, is a curious incor-poration of the alchemical process in the framework of the Mass. \u000ee headings ofhis text are the usual components of the Christian liturgy (Introitus Missae, Kyrie,Graduale, Versus, Offertorium, Secretum, and so on), but under them we findsome rather unorthodox material: vitriol, saltpeter, the philosopher’s stone, marriagewith the moon, and the sperm of philosophers wishing to copulate with the Virgin.\u000ee Sequentia Evangeli contains an elaborate alchemical process in which the primamateria perishes, revives, copulates, conceives, and rejuvenates.

In this international history of the royal art, Melchior is cho-sen to represent Hungary among the twelve most famous alchemists of the world,and thus he appears in the noble company of Hermes Trismegistos, Maria the Jew-ess, Avicenna, Albertus Magnus, Roger Bacon, and Raimundus Lullus.4He is men-tioned and quoted by such authors and editors of the sixteenth and seventeenthcenturies as Daniel Stolz von Stolzenberg, Petrus Borelius, Libavius, and AthanasiusKircher. Even Isaac Newton was acquainted with Melchior’s name; relying on Maier’sdescription, he incorporated a number of Latin notes on a wide range of alchem-ical authors and myths in one of his many alchemical manuscripts, among thesea few references to the alchemist of Transylvania.5Last but not least, the alchemical Mass was deeply analyzed by Jung as an exampleA1451. To my knowledge this is the only example in medieval and early modern times of using theCatholic Mass for alchemical purposes. However, there are cases of using it for other magical aims.See, for example, Lea Olsan’s paper delivered at the \u000eirty-ninth International Congress on Medi -eval Studies at Kalamazoo, “\u000ee Appropriation of Liturgy for Healing Charms and Amulets,” on acase of healing magic in Lincoln Cathedral MS 91, fol. 296r–v (ca. 1425–50).

Indeed, Christ appears in the pages of the alchem-ical Mass as the “blessed stone of the art of science who for the salvation of the world[hath] inspired the light of science, for the extirpation of the Turk.”7Melchior’s workprovides Jung with weighty evidence for the lapis–Christ identity, and also for theconcept that the arcanum of alchemy is somehow concealed in the Virgin. In fact,Melchior’s alchemical paraphrase appears as a hymn to Mary, in which a correspon-dence is made between alchemical transmutation and Christian transubstantiation.On the circumstances of the birth of this exceptional text, virtually nothing canbe established with complete certainty. Who was the author, how could this workbe dedicated to a king, and how could it happen that alchemy was chosen as thetheme of such a basic liturgical genre as the text of the Mass? Before speculatingon the authorship and origin of the alchemical Mass, let us briefly survey the prestigethe royal art enjoyed in late medieval intellectual circles.

But there is one important peculiarity of the local spread of this dis-cipline: it inspired more original works than the fields of magic did.Although the “royal art”—unlike astrology—was never incorporated into theuniversity curriculum, it was by no means a neglected topic in codices belongingto clerics, students, and professors. In order to see what might have induced a uni-versity master or a monk to deal with alchemy, and to examine what strategies thealchemical texts themselves applied to become integrated in the medical, techno-logical, or religious content of the codices, let us briefly survey a few concrete man-uscripts from the libraries of university masters and clerical practitioners.In many cases, the reason to include alchemy in a scientific manuscript was clearlyits medical relevance. In our often-cited magical handbook, BJ 793, we find a cru-cial source of alchemical medicine: Johannes of Rupescissa’s De considerationequintae essentiae (On the Fifth Essence).9Rupescissa’s text was a frequent item inmedieval manuscripts; it was also printed several times in the sixteenth and sev-enteenth centuries. Although he is undeniably speaking about alchemy, he does notaim to explain the secrets of transmutation; instead, he concentrates on a medicalissue, the preparation of the elixir of youth, the aqua vitae.10Taking into consid-eration a number of scientific and philosophical arguments, Rupescissa comes tothe conclusion that the human body cannot be preserved with the help of some-thing corruptible, but only with a material that is the terrestrial correspondent ofthe eternal and perfect element of the heavens: the fifth essence, the quinta essen-tia.\u000eis terrestrial equivalent of the fifth essence, which has strong preservativevirtues, is nothing other than the aqua ardens,the “ardent water,” that is, alcohol.Now—and here comes alchemy strictly speaking—aqua ardens cannot only be pre-pared as a result of repeated distillations, but can be also extracted from organicand inorganic materials, for example from minerals: inter alia, from gold. \u000eis themeexplains why this treatise of Rupescissa is followed in the Kraków codex—as wellas in many other sources—by a short recipe for preparing aqua vitae.11A different way of applying alchemy for medical purposes can be detected inBJ 823, where a great number of short alchemical recipes are scattered among awide range of medical instructions and theoretical writings on medicine.12Similarly,in a codex originally from Buda alchemical and medical recipes follow a number ofmedical texts—a “health regimen,” Zacharias’s De passione oculorum (On Eye Disease),Bruno Longoburgensis’s Chrirurgia magna (Surgery)—as well as AlbertusMagnus’s De mineralibus(On Minerals) and Roger Bacon’s Epistola de retardationeA1479.

As a mat-ter of fact, many scholastic authors were convinced that alchemy, with its practi-cal orientation, experimental character, eagerness to manipulate the objects of theworld, and motivation to replicate natural products, was alien from the theoreticallyoriented scientia taught at the universities, and belonged—if anywhere—rather tothe realm of technology, the ars mechanica.19It is instructive that alchemy couldappear as a noble branch of human knowledge in a technical and military work,Conrad Kyeser’s Bellifortis.And Kyeser’s concern for alchemy was not limited toits mere inclusion in his classification of useful sciences. Since the recipes for Greekfire and other incendiary weapons were closely related to the tradition of alchemy,the royal art played a central role both in Kyeser’s chief source, the Liber igniumof Marcus Graecus, and in his own descriptions of the different kinds of fire.20To be sure, alchemy might have also occurred in medieval codices alone: we haveexamples of anthologies consecrated exclusively to either anonymous alchemicalrecipes (as, for example, in the case of a Prague codex from the fourteenth cen-tury),21or to the writings of the great authorities of the field (Hortolanus, Bubac-carus, Raimundus Lullus, and Roger Bacon), as it happens in the case of a codexcompiled by a Kraków student, Johannes Adam of Bochnia (BJ 5465).\u000ee examples presented thus far were owned by either independent intellectu-als or university masters.22However, in two cases—those of BJ 823 and the Budamanuscript—we identified monks belonging to the Cistercian and CarthusianOrders as possessors of alchemical texts. We should not forget either that Johannesof Rupes cissa, the author of the first text discussed here, was a Franciscan. Onecan also add that the first genuine alchemical texts from Bohemian territories, theProcessus de lapide philosophorum (On the Philosophers’ Stone) and the Aenigma delapide (Enigma on the Stone), were also written by a monk, Johannes TicinensisA14919.

However, we do know that Conrad was the target of severeenvy because of his rapid rise in the hierarchy and the great favor he enjoyed at theimperial court; many rumors were spread about his magical practices, which arenot otherwise supported by any historical evidence.31Consequently, it is possiblethat his name was used in the same way, though to a lesser extent, as that of Rai -mundus Lullus, who did not write a single alchemical tract, yet became the ascribedauthor of a large corpus of such literature.While it is possible that the archbishop of Prague was unjustly suspected ofpracticing alchemy, there is ample evidence to suggest that members of both theregular and the secular clergy were indeed interested in the field.32Among theusual testimonies, we have the repeated condemnations, the surviving alchemicalhandbooks, and further written materials. \u000ee archaeological type of evidence, how-ever, that survived from an alchemical-metallurgical laboratory unearthed in a placecalled Oberstockstall, forty miles northwest of Vienna, counts as fairly exceptional.A15129.

When John, the honest alchemist, recognized the abuse of the royal art and reproached her, Barbara attempted to have him imprisoned,and he escaped only with great difficulty. \u000eis story—printed in the eighteenthcentury and allegedly originating in 144045—is not independent of or unconnectedwith the malign rumors concerning Empress Barbara, and even if it has little todo with what actually happened, it is quite informative about the usual conflictsbetween alchemists and their protectors (or protectresses).46If we are looking for more contemporary and more trustworthy sources aboutthis alchemist’s life, the last paragraph of another of his works, the Tractatus secun-dus aureus de lapide philosophorum(Second Golden Treatise on the Philosophers’Stone) written in 1448, tells us that he was a pupil of a certain Antonius of Flo-rence, who was killed in Bohemia because of his chemical art.47\u000ee most important conclusion that we can draw from this piece of informationis certainly not that fifteenth-century Bohemia—where John was said to be pros-ecuted by Empress Barbara and where Antonius was murdered—was particularlyunsafe for alchemists, but rather that Italy constituted an important intellectualresource of Bohemian alchemy. \u000ee fact that John was a disciple of Antonius ofFlorence is also supported by the text of “\u000ee Rightful Way.”48Here Antoniusappears as a prospector searching for ore in the Bohemian mountains, but appar-ently he was also involved in transmutations. Now, whether John was really a pupilof this person or just claimed to be so, the role that the Italians and the activity ofmining played in the Central European reception of magical arts is quite striking.In Bohemia, we can refer to Antonius, while in Kraków—as we shall see in Chap-ter 8—a certain Monaldus de Luca seems to have been involved in treasure hunt-ing, undertaken together with Polish university masters who were also associatedwith gold mining.What these stories teach us is that the three conceivable ways of searching forgold—the practice of alchemy, the hunting of treasure, and mining—were closelyrelated to each other in the fifteenth century, and this threefold activity seems tohave been fostered by Italian masters both in Kraków and in Prague.A15745.

As the adjective Cib-inensis in his name indicates, he was from the town of Nagyszeben (Hermannstadt,Sibiu, Cibinium)50in Transylvania.51Hereafter we can only rely on speculations.52In his biography of Hungarian medical doctors, Stephanus Weszprémi iden -tifies Melchior with Nicolaus Olah (1493–1568), a most important personality in sixteenth-century Hungarian history.53Olah was a counselor to Queen Mary of Habs burg, for a short period the regent, and in the last decades of his life thearchbishop of Hungary (1553). He was not only an influential politician and anecclesiastical leader, but also a well-known humanist of his time, in frequent cor-respondence with other humanists of Europe, among them Erasmus.He was in -deed born in the town of Nagyszeben, just as Melchior was, but there is no evidencethat he was interested in alchemy, even though he explored as broad a variety oftopics as any humanist and was proficient in many literary genres.\u000ee question remains whether we should really view the Processusas a text writ-ten by a future archbishop and addressed to his king. Is that not too ambitious froman alchemical treatise? In her recent study, the Romanian scholar Cristina Neaguprovides convincing arguments to support Weszprémi’s conviction that Melchior158P T: T  H49. On Cardinal Melchior Brixiensis, see HMES, 4:348.50. Founded in the twelfth century by a Saxon population on the site of an abandoned Romansettlement known as Cibinium, Nagyszeben became one of the Saxon seats in Transylvania in themedieval kingdom of Hungary. In German it was called Hermannstadt, in Hungarian Nagyszeben,and its present-day Romanian name is Sibiu.51. His alchemical Mass, however, is not mentioned in the scholarly study on the Sibiu missals.See Karl Reinerth, Missale Cibiniense.

Melchior wasfrom the same place as Olah, and he was probably also a man of the church, acleric of higher rank, because, as Neagu points out, “\u000ee viewpoint taken by theProcessusis that of a priest saying Mass.”55\u000eey must have been more or less con-temporaries: while the Processus was dedicated to a certain (not specified) Wladis-las, king of Hungary and Bohemia, we know that Olah arrived in Buda in 1510and spent six years at the court of Wladislas II, who reigned in these two coun-tries between 1490 and 1516. In addition, both authors were concerned with thethreat of the Turks, and both were committed to acting against this threat on apolitical level. Finally, Cristina Neagu supports the possible identification of the twopersons by pointing out stylistic resemblances between Melchior’s alchemical Massand writings known to be by Olah.In fact, it was by no means inconceivable in the Middle Ages to associate cler-ics at the higher levels of the ecclesiastical hierarchy with the royal art, at least atthe level of gossip, rumors, and accusations. We have already mentioned an alchem-ical text attributed to another Melchior, the bishop of Brixen, and another attrib-uted to Conrad of Vechta, the archbishop of Prague. We can now add that AbbotTrithemius, in his Chronicle of the Monastery of Hirsau,lists several bishops andarchbishops who either supported alchemists financially or practiced the royal artthemselves.56\u000eerefore, Nicolaus Olah would not have been the only archbishopof the region who appears as an assigned or real author of an alchemical work.However, while there is indeed a strong correlation between the data we haveabout Melchior and Olah, there is further evidence—not known to Neagu—thatshould also be taken into account. László Szathmáry, a Hungarian historian of chem-istry and alchemy, examined the issue of their identity as early as 1928, but sincehis book was published only in his mother tongue, his considerations remained vir-tually unknown to historians of alchemy outside Hungary.57Szathmáry collectedA15954.

First, he argued, theProcessus sub forma missaewas dedicated to King Wladislas II, and if Melchior wasreally Olah, he could not have been older than twenty-three (his age when Wladis-las died), and pages at this age hardly dedicate their writings to their king. (Neaguis aware of this counterargument, and claims that the gifted and ambitious Olah,who was appointed as the canon of Pécs as early as 1518, must have had a higherposition in the previous years than that of a mere page.) Second, as Szathmáry wenton, Olah did not mention alchemy in his extensive correspondence with otherhumanists, nor was any alchemical work in his library.Nevertheless, Szathmáry’s third argument is the strongest one. \u000ee Processus subforma missae survived not only in its printed edition, as Weszprémy supposed inthe eighteenth century and as Neagu maintains today, but also in two early mod-ern manuscripts kept today in Vienna.58One of these manuscripts, which seemsto originate from 1604 and contains a wide range of alchemical literature, pro-vides some new information about the life of Melchior.59A short, though fairlyobscure, notice preceding the text of the alchemical Mass claims that the ProcessusChymicuswas offered by the last Bosnian king, Stephen (d. 1463), to the Hun-garian and Bohemian king, Ladislaus V Posthumous (1440–58), whose (unnamed)chaplain redacted it. \u000ee text was allegedly found many years later by Melchior(in the manuscript he is called Nicolaus Matzerus Cibinensis Transsylvanus), who,together with a Bohemian nobleman, Andrea Schampasa, forged coins which weremore valuable than those of the king. As a result of the fakery, he was executed in1531 by Ferdinand Habsburg, who was king of Hungary between 1526 and 1564,after the reign of Wladislas’s son, Louis II (1516–1526). If we accept this report—which is the most contemporary thus far—as authentic, Melchior could obviouslynot have been the same person as Olah, and he was not even the author of thistext of Bosnian origin, only its reader, transmitter, and unfortunate user.60160P T: T  H58.

Interestingly, Jung gives somewhat similar details about Melchior without referring to anyprimary or secondary source (Psychologie und Alchemie, 536). Jung declares that a “Nicolaus MelchiorSzebeni” was the chaplain (!) and astrologer at King Wladislas’s court from 1490. He stayed at thecourt after Wladislas’s death (1516) under Louis II. After the defeat at Mohács, he fled to the courtof Ferdinand I in Vienna, and he was executed in 1531 by the latter monarch. Since this information05 Chapter 5:Sample.qxd 9/24/2008 11:49 AM Page 160"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Relying on the present evidence, it is impossible to determine who NicolausMelchior really was. He was definitely from Cibinium, and he seems to have beena cleric who played some role at the court of the Hungarian king Wladislas II. Fur-thermore, he was apparently concerned about the Turks, and he tried to use hispolitical influence—however great or small it was—to exhort his fellow Hungar-ians to resist the Turkish threat. He does not seem to have been an outsider, a fool,or an anonymous magician, but rather a respected figure of his time, who dedicatedhis work to the king. If the name Melchior was the pseudonym of a sixteenth-century humanist, we may infer that this person is known to us under a differentname. On the other hand, if this was not a pseudonym, the task is to identify anew actor in late medieval Hungarian courtly culture. In this case, however, it maybe possible to find the person who was actually called Nicolaus Melchioris Cibi-nensis on the basis of the source evidence provided by his home town.61To come to a conclusion, as far as the practice of alchemy is concerned, we canrecord a serious involvement of the clergy on all levels. Simple monks were oftenfound pursuing the royal art, but even clerics of higher ranks were concerned withalchemy both in the West and in Central Europe. Melchior, the bishop of Brixen,our Melchior, the Cibinensis—whether he was a simple chaplain or the archbishopof Hungary—and finally Conrad, archbishop of Prague, were all real or assignedauthors of alchemical works. It can be probably assumed that this preoccupationwith alchemy might provide some explanation of how alchemical thought was in -corporated in the Christian liturgy (or perhaps how Christian motifs were integratedin the framework of alchemy) both in textual and pictorial sources.62A161(particularly the Hungarian place name Szeben and the idea that Melchior was a chaplain) does notappear anywhere in the literature, and nor is it completely identical with the statements of the man-uscript quoted above but agrees well with the account of Szathmáry, who simplified what he foundin the Vienna source, it seems reasonable to suppose that Jung might have taken this piece of infor-mation directly or indirectly from Szathmáry’s Magyar alkémisták, probably through the intermediaryof their mutual friend Károly Kerényi.61. \u000eis was the aim of the research carried out by Cosmin Popa-Gorjanu. In the city archives ofNagyszeben, he identified several individuals bearing the name Melchior whose profession was goldsmithand who could have authored the Processus.See Kiss, Láng, and Popa-Gorjanu, “Alchemical Mass.”62. It should be added to the Central European history of alchemy that two fragments, each fourpages long and originating from the same alchemical manuscript, have survived in two differentHungarian libraries. \u000ee remains of a copy of Pseudo-Plato’s Liber quartus cum commento HebuhabesHamed(Budapest: Egyetemi Könyvtár U. Fr. l. m. 60) and those of Pseudo-Geber’s Summa perfec-tionis (Központi Szeminárium S. Fr. l. m. 36) were found hidden in the binding material of two dif-ferent early modern printed books. Interestingly, a portrait depicting Plato in the first fragment ispartly blackened by later hands. \u000ee fourteenth-century manuscript that originally contained thesetwo fragments was in Hungary in the early decades of the seventeenth century. However, we do notknow its earlier history; that is why I did not include them in the main text on medieval Hungar-ian alchemy.

However, Ganszyniec found thesource of one prayer (“Summe deus pater piissime”) in the Ars notoria.7Ye Ars notoria, which is ascribed to Solomon and his “friend and successor”Apollonius, is a fairly widespread work of medieval ritual magic and theurgy.8Ifwe are not trained in the field of learned magic, we will easily mistake it at firstglance for an innocent religious text, because the ritual of the Ars notoria is noth-ing other than an elaborated liturgical program composed of prayers and orationsaddressed to transcendent agents. Only a closer look reveals that the text, by meansof its large variety of prayers, invocations of divine and angelic names, and numer-ous rituals, actually promises intellectual perfection, learning, the acquisition ofmemory, and the ability to understand difficult books. To use its procedures onemust first practice a course of confession, fasting, chastity, penitence, and the cul-tivation of physical and psychological purity lasting several months. However piousthis text may seem, its emphasis on the efficacy of words and names of God tohelp the user attain power, and the purposes for which a user might turn to it—the acquisition of absolute knowledge, moral perfection, and unlimited memory—bring it close to other magical arts.Being an “ars artium, scientia scientiarum,” the notory art is a metasciencethrough which all the other sciences can be mastered: the seven liberal arts, as wellas the mechanical and the so-called exceptive—that is, divinatory and magical—disciplines. Ye last, exceptive category comprises necromancy as well, even thoughit is reserved to those adepts who would use it only for good aims. To be sure, rit-ual magic is not the only art that claims to be such a metascience; every mnemo -technic method that helped the reader remember and reproduce textual and visualdata in a culture where books were rare and precious did so as well.9Hence, it isnot a pure coincidence that the Ars notoriawas called Ars memorativa, amongother places, in a Kraków fragment.10R M  C1657.

Briefly, theurgy is the art of bringing down celestial beings (angels) through the use of prayerson the one hand, and of ecstatic ascent toward union with God, on the other.9. Among mnemotechnic metasciences, the Ars magna of Raimundus Lullus is no doubt themost famous.10. BJ 2076, fol.

Yis text is not present in the earliest versions of the Ars notoria, butwas added later. It appears as a closing prayer in the first printed version, whichcan be read in a sixteenth-century edition of Cornelius Agrippa’s Opera Omnia.11What is interesting here, and what leads us to certain speculations, is the fact thatthe very next prayer in the prayer book of Wladislas also contains an excerpt fromthe Ars notoria(“O lux mundi”),12which can be found in Agrippa’s edition butfifty pages earlier than the “Summe deus,” not right next to it.13However, the twoprayers do appear together another Polish codex, BJ 551, in a short version of theArs notoria.14Yus, either there was a direct relationship between BJ 551 and theprayer book, or—more likely—a short version of the Ars notoria containing thesetwo prayers next to each other was in circulation, and the compiler of the prayerbook worked from a text similar to that of BJ 551.15Ganszyniec left a number of prayers unidentified, but he claimed that the authorworked in a continuous and uniform way, borrowing pieces of texts from his sources,but did not compose a single prayer himself. Ye author, who is consequentlyrather a compiler, seems to have been satisfied with introducing formulaic para-graphs into the imported texts. More recently, Urszula Borkowska examined theprayers of Wladislas in the context of other prayer books of the Jagiellons, and shenoted that “Marian devotion is particularly developed in it, and the angelologicaltexts, rarely developed in prayer books, are extremely interesting.”16Ganszyniec and Borkowska cannot be blamed for failing to identify the mostimportant source of the royal prayer book; they were simply not in a position to166P T: T  HQuat trocento,” in Szczucki,Magia, astrologia e religione nel Rinascimento, esp. 102; MS Cambridge,Trinity Coll. 1419, Liber de arte memorativa sive notoria.11.

It may be added that it was Ganszyniec’s impression that the compiler downplayed magic asmuch as possible. He omitted the obviously forbidden elements, the methods of suffumigations, andthe most explicit rubrics of magic, since these were condemned by medieval penitential books asvane superstitiones.Yus, the compiler constructed the appearance of a regular prayer book, makinguse at the same time of the ritual character of this genre. As a result of this cautious balance, themagic contained in the book was invisible to everybody except the compiler. See Ganszyniec, “OModlitewniku Władysława,” 78–82. Although this conclusion seems to have become outdated, sincescholarship has established the category of ritual magic and since it has been exploring the purify-ing methods of John of Morigny, Ganszyniec was certainly right in identifying a conscious programof reinterpreting magical texts in a Christian framework.16.

As he describeshimself in the prologue of his Liber visionum,he had been a poor student in hisyouth, and unable to afford books, he turned to the methods of the Ars notoria,which thus became for him a real instrument of learning.18Later, however, afterbecoming a monk, he became convinced that the Ars notoria was inspired by demonsand abandoned it. His doubts concerning the Ars notoria arose when malign spir-its began tormenting and terrifying him and his sister, a certain Gurgeta, who wasalso practicing the nortory art, in her case to learn more quickly to read and write.But even after these visitations, it took a while for even the Virgin and Christ him-self to convince him of the wickedness of these arts (before that he had even turnedto necromancy, and had written a book on the topic and and prepared a “ring ofSolomon”).19At last, inspired by the Virgin Mary, he decided to prepare a puri-fied version of the Ars notoria,and thus he compiled an exceptional collection ofMarian visions, the Liber visionum.Brother John was apparently positive that by omitting the suspicious unknownwords (verba ignota) of the notory art, and by sticking to understandable Latin,he had—with the Virgin’s help—resolved all the difficulties of the Ars notoria,andexpunged every demonic element.20Indeed, he was so sure of this that he wroteunder his own name and did not attempt to keep his work secret. However, whilethe prayers and the invocations of angels became more or less orthodox, the de -pendence of the Liber visionumon the Ars notoria was still undeniable. Its structuremirrored that of the “Flores aurei” (the first of the two principal chapters of theArs notoria); it used the same technical vocabulary, and above all, promised thesame results: the swift acquisition of a stronger memory, greater eloquence, andR M  C16717.

However, if we take a look at the con-stantly growing list of surviving copies of the Liber visionum, we see a considerabledistribution of the work in the libraries of the following centuries, which indicatesan increasing interest on the part of readers and collectors. John of Morigny wouldhave certainly been pleased to see this, but he would also have been puzzled torealize that one of his readers not only copied his work, but—situating it in a newcontext, reinterpreted and somewhat restructured it—and actually further purifiedhis already purified book.As Claire Fanger and I discovered, almost one-third of the prayers in Wladislas’sprayer book go back to Brother John’s text.23Yese prayers are addressed to God,24the Virgin Mary,25the four archangels (“I ask you Archangels Michael, Gabriel,Raphael, and Uriel, and invocate you, that you illuminate this crystal”),26and thehierarchy of angels (“Oh all of you, blesséd spirits and benign, glorious, kind, andgentle angels, who stay in the order of angels, in the lower ranks and stages of thehierarchy”).27Although the borrowings are somewhat unsystematic and in mostcases the author did not adapt complete prayers, but rather mixed, interpolated,and abbreviated excerpts from various parts of the Liber visionum,nevertheless, theorder of the extracts more or less follows the original sequence.Interestingly, the author of the prayer book incorporated those parts of the Libervisionum where John describes how he—blindly—used to practice the notory art,168P T: T  H21.

It is mainly this positioning that seems to indicate that theauthor of the prayer book must have known John’s whole text, and consciouslyimitated the structure of the Liber visionum,as well as John’s passage from theSolomonic art in his own angelic system.29Ye impression that John and conse-quently our author are no longer offering diabolically motivated magic in theirbooks, but are trying to do something nondemonic and divinely inspired, is rein-forced by many later claims in the text, among them: “Let me be able to avoid andpowerfully overcome all diabolic temptations, all frauds and magic arts.”30Another interesting motif of the prayer book borrowed from the Liber visionumis the emphasis on the care with which the book itself had been prepared. Relyingon the text of the Liber visionum,although somewhat altering it, our author alsostresses that the book was written, made, and composed with great diligence andthat he prepared himself for the endeavor with several days and nights of vigilance,fasting, special orations, complete reverence, and many ceremonies.31Yis ritualis-tic attention to the preparation of the book is unknown in the tradition of the Arsnotoria.For parallels we have to turn to other magical sources, either to the Liberconsecrationis, in which the book is not only prepared with such care, but is also con-secrated,32or to the Liber iuratus Honorii, at the center of which we find again aconsecrated book. Ye latter one—as we have already seen—narrates a great synodof necromancers and magicians where they chose from among themselves a leader,Honorius, son of Euclid, who wrote a book on the magical arts which contains thehundred sacred names of God. Yis book is called the sacred or sworn book of Hon-orius, because—as the text stresses—it is consecrated by God and His angels.33R M  C16928. “Oro te, supplico tibi, rogo te toto corde meo, quia prius et antea, quodam suffocacionedemoniaca tentatus decepcione, illo prevalente, cecatus, quasi hesitans, non credendo revelacionessacras et moniciones michi ex bono spiritu, operacione et arte, quibus ignoranter vacaveram esse fac-tam, et in detrimentum anime mee ad diversas peccatorum operaciones quasi scienter cucurri et,prochdolor, adhesi mei in contumeliam creatoris.” Ibid., 18–19.

One ofthese is a prayer addressed to Adonay (“Most potent king, ruler of all visible andmortal creatures”),34which appears in a significant position—between the prayertaken from the Ars notoriaand the first passage borrowed from John, while it alsoincorporates the “O lux mundi” excerpt from the Ars notoria. Yis prayer is richin magical elements; among them we find a main motif of natural magic: theoccult virtue of gems and herbs induced by God (“You, who implant the virtue inall the gems and herbs, give to this crystal the virtue of your omnipotence).35Yese paragraphs are either composed by the compiler himself, or borrowed froman as yet unidentified magical source. One more reason why they are of interestfor us is that they contain some interesting details about “the crystal,” details thatare not to be found in the other parts of the book. Fairly surprisingly, the crystalappears here as a quadrangular object (“who illuminates this quadrangular crys-tal”), and functions—as the text goes—through the “holy” (or perhaps rather, mag-ical) names of God: Agla, Sabaoth, Tetragrammaton, Emanuel, and Messias.36 It iswidely known that these names of God are often used in magical rituals.37It maybe plausible to suppose—although it is far from being explicitly stated—that thesedivine names that offer their virtue to the crystal and function as powerful cata-lysts of the process are physically engraved either directly on the gem or on a metalframe surrounding it.38Although the crystal is undeniably at the center of the practices described by theprayer book, we can only conjecture about its appearance. Since there is no crys-tal involved in the practices of the Ars notoria,nor in those of the Liber visionum,the sources of the prayer book identified thus far do not offer much help. Neverthe -less, a recently found and exceptionally well preserved object may help us in our spec -ulation.

It is clear from this report that the practices of seek-ing visions or knowledge in crystal balls (crystallomancy), magical mirrors (catop-tromancy), and other shining bodies (such as fingernails, swords, ivory objects, andbasins filled with water) were not viewed as mere subbranches of natural—that isto say, nondemonic—magic or pure divination. Ye detailed methodology, thewell-defined procedures of ritual invocations of angels and demons, and the useof young male and female mediums place these practices squarely in the realm ofritual magic.41In 1376, Nicolaus Eymeric, the famous Catalan inquisitor, reported about invo-cations performed “by tracing a circle in the earth, by placing a boy in the circle, byfixing a mirror, a sword, an amphora, or other small body before the boy, and withthe necromancer himself holding a book, and reading, and invoking the demon.”42In his exhaustive catalog of divinatory techniques, Das půch aller verpoten kunst,the German Johannes Hartlieb, mentioning basically the same elements, reportscases of scrying with steel mirrors: these should be consecrated, and then—accord-ing to the magicians—angels and not demons appear in them. Interestingly, Hart -lieb classifies catoptromantic and crystallomantic experiments under the headingof “pyromancy,” that is, originally, the divination with fire.43Ye anonymous necromantic manual published by Richard Kieckhefer, usuallyreferred to as the “Munich handbook,” also contains accounts of experiments basedon gazing into crystals, which aim at obtaining information about uncertain things,such as identifying a thief.44Yis crystal is put to work, or rather “switched on,”by the various names of God (Adonay, Sabaoth, Hel, Hely, Sother, Emanuel, Alphaet O,and so on), and if all the indispensable ingredients are at the disposal of themagician, he may start conjuring angels who will tell him the truth.45One of these172P T: T  H41.

One can further add five experiments withmirrors (called the Mirror of Floron, and the Mirror of Lilith) presented by the same source, becausemirrors function in the same way for similar purposes, with the involvement of angels and virgin boys.Ibid., 104–6.45. Ye endurance of these traditions is well demonstrated by an interesting seventeenth-centurybook written in Hungarian on ritual magic, which contains instructions on how to find treasure,money, and precious stones hidden under the earth with the help of prayers and invocations. Sum-moning the appropriate angels and archangels (a different one for each day), the operator is to turnto the sun, give a mirror or a crystal to a virgin boy or girl, and iterate (flexis genibus,as usual) a longlist of prayers and a set of divine names (Agios + Otheos + Yschiros + Athanatos + Eleyzon + Ymas + 06 Chapter 6:Sample.qxd 10/10/2008 8:52 AM Page 172"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"elements necessary for the crystallomantic and catoptromantic activities (as wellas for a wide range of other divinatory experiments and invocations described bythe necromantic handbook) was a virgin boy.46Yat young boy mediums areessential in many magical rituals is testified by other sources as well. John of Salis -bury, Johannes Hartlieb, and Nicolaus Jawor all mention the use of virgin boys asmediators of the divine message,47John of Salisbury having the most personal expe-rience among them, since he himself was used in his youth by a priest as a recip-ient of divinatory information (Policraticus,bk. 2, chap. 28).48As it is apparent from the sources, a comprehensive and detailed procedure ofcrystallomancy had been constructed by the High Middle Ages.Very probably,this is the real context in which we are to imagine how the Mecklenburg magicalcrystal was used by its owner. Ye angels summoned by the practitioner were sup-posed to appear in the crystal to answer his questions, which was usually about thelocation of hidden treasure or stolen articles but occasionally concerned muchmore important matters, such as “the highest truths” about the world. Virgin boysserved as mediums, magical handbooks provided the appropriate formulas to beread, and consecrated crystals were engraved with the secret and powerful names ofGod. Yese elements went far beyond the “legitimate science” of natural magic (asWilliam of Auvergne defined it); consequently, they provoked serious attacks fromthe side of official theology. Inquisitors and university statutes condemned crystal-lomancy; and its practitioners—as we will see in Chapter 8, examining the trials ofJean de Bar and William Byg—were arrested, forced to confess their error, and evenoccasionally executed. Yus no historian should expect to find a handbook of crys-tallomancy that was not only tolerated but used by official authorities and kept ina royal library. Yet the royal prayer book of Wladislas is just such a handbook.We read very little into the text when we suppose that the crystal—if it actuallyexisted—looked very much like the Mecklenburg mirror. Although we cannot becertain that it existed, we have every right to suppose so. Yere are no instructionsin the prayer book on how to prepare the crystal, and what is more, at one point—R M  C173Szentczeges Isten). His objectives extend beyond the simple wish to find treasure; he wants the angelsto satisfy all his wishes and requests, provided—the text hastens to stress—that his goals are notmalign, vain, or indecent.

Ye picture put together from these small bits of information is ratherobscure. Ye angels invoked through the prayers enter and amplify the crystal,51then clarify, illuminate, and illustrate,52 and at the end of the preparatory stage forthe vision, they even open it.53A last important detail is provided by the statementthat the angels are also supposed to consecrate the crystal.54Now, the consecrationof a magical object, be it a crystal, a sword, or a book, can be easily accounted for,and the clarification and the illumination of a crystal by the angels in the verymoment when it becomes a means of communication between terrestrial and celes-tial agents would still be understandable. But what do amplification (dilatare) andopening (aperire) mean?Taking a look at the fourteen miniatures inserted among the prayers does notshed much light on this obscure picture. On most of them, we see a young manwearing a crown with a white eagle on his coat of arms, which is indeed the sym-bol of the Jagiellonian family. He is kneeling and praying in front of the Madonna(the orientation of the Liber visionum is faithfully adapted), to the crucified or theresurrected Christ, or to various saints.55One of these illuminations—filling thespace exactly between the Ars notoria prayer and the first Liber visionum text, whichtells how Wladislas turned away from his previous magical practices—depicts theyoung crowned man with a sword (an important part of the magician’s inventory)174P T: T  H49.

Ye next to last miniature shows the same man kneel-ing in his chamber in front of the same object on a table, and behind the table threewinged angels appear, while a Godlike figure seems to supervise the whole procedure(fig. 30). Yese angels are supposedly just in the process of illuminating, clarifying,and entering the strange object, which does definitely not resemble the crystal as itis described in the text, but looks like a trefoiled bowl, a frequent object in royalhouseholds, often made of precious materials, such as alabaster or quartz for exam-ple. Since the illuminator worked several decades after the text had been written,such discrepancies between the pictures and the text are not surprising.Another late medieval magical text might hold a clue to why the object depictedin the prayer book does not bear any resemblance to the German mirror, and whyit is not even quadrangular as the text claimed. Ye shape of the depicted objectis not very far from the “circles” described in the Clavicula Salomonis ( The LesserKey of Solomon), in which four smaller circles are situated at the four corners ofa square.56In its chapter on the construction of the circle, the Clavicula first in -structs the operator to draw a circle with a consecrated magical sword,57and thenrecite several prayers to God (Lord Adonai) asking Him to enter and consecrate thecircle, which is marked out with His most powerful and holy names, and also tomagnify and extend upon the operator.58I do not want to imply, of course, that the author of the prayer book had an earlycopy of the Clavicula Salomonis in front of him. Ye point I am trying to make issimply that while the prayers mix three traditions (the Ars notoria,the Liber visi -onum,and common prayers), the crystallomantic formulas inserted in them inte-grate at least two different sets of terminology: on the one hand, that of the actualpractice of divination by means of a crystal, as represented by the Mecklenburg mir-ror, and on the other, that of magical circles used for the invocation of angels—apractice similar to what is described in the Clavicula—where entering and magni-fying by angels makes more sense than in the case of a crystal.59In both traditionsthere are divine names written on the object, but while the metal frames of the crys-tal which survived in Mecklenburg may more easily rationalize why our crystal is“quadrangular,” the tradition of the Solomonic circles may better explain the cir-cular form depicted on the pictures, as well as the strange terminology of the text.R M  C17556.

Ye Jesuit’s answer surviveson the blank folios of the prayer book immediately following the text.61Yese foliosinitiated a long scholarly debate that has not yet concluded. Ferrandus clearly rec-ognized that the codex had been owned by a Polish king, Wladislas, and suspectedthat among the many Polish kings called Wladislas, it must have been the first one,Jagiello, the grand duke of Lithuania from 1377 to 1401, king of Poland from 1386to 1434, and creator of the Polish–Lithuanian commonwealth. He gives four rea-sons for believing this, but admits that it is no more than a conjecture. Just like themodern reader, the Jesuit was puzzled by the magical content of the seemingly devo-tional book. Furthermore, he did not see how the crystal might have been quad-rangular,62and he also found the crystallomantic practices to be in opposition withthe Christian faith. His main concern was similar to the worries of the Paris author-ities who had ordered the burning of the Liber visionum in 1323, namely the curios-ity and vanity of the operator who asks for total, divine, and eternal knowledge.Ye great book collector, Richard Rawlinson (1690–1755), purchased the codexat some point between 1719 and 1726, while traveling on the Continent. He leftit to the Bodleian Library together with a huge collection of medieval manuscripts,medals, and coins in 1755, in the year of his death. Ye sudden growth of thequantity of books in the Bodleian was a real shock for the librarians; for more thana century they could not even catalog the Rawlinson manuscripts.63But all this evidence is secondary to the question of who may have first com-missioned the compiling of this text, that is, who Wladislas was. Yis name in thefifteenth century would not yet have crossed the borders of Poland, and the coatof arms present on all the miniatures clearly belongs to the Jagiello family; conse-quently every scholar agrees that the owner of the book was one of the several kingsof Poland of that name and family.Traditionally, the codex is associated with the Jagiellonian king of Poland andHungary who died in 1444 in the Battle of Varna (hence it is called the PrayerBook of Wladislas Varnenczyk).64Yis attribution is supported by the evidencethat the handwriting of the codex dates indeed from the 1430s, and that the young178P T: T  H60.

Yisis clearly not the portrait of Wladislas II (1456–1516), king of Bohemia and Hun-gary, a corpulent bald man who otherwise is also often identified as the owner ofthe prayer book. Ye miniatures, however, in contrast to the script, seem to datefrom the 1490s, and the reign of this Wladislas.65As both of these kings were alsoHungarian rulers, Hungarian codicologists have contributed, unfortunately, to bothsides of this debate.66Ye text of the prayer book, especially the ceaseless repetitions of crystalloman-tic formula, is to some extent revealing about the owner, but at the same time itadds further confusion to the picture. Most of the prayers—in the first person sin-gular—let slip some information on Wladislas, not very consistently, however. Inthe crystal Wladislas wants to see the intentions and acts of not only his subjects,that is, people of lower rank who like or hate him, but also of his equals and supe-riors, among them kings and princes.67We learn that he has both spiritual (eccle-siastical) and secular superiors,68which implies that his is not the highest place inthe political hierarchy, and he is not a ruling king. Among his equals, he lists mainlydukes,69but on one occasion—rather inconsistently—even kings.70Dismissing thisas an error on the part of the scribe, Ryszard Ganszyniec came to the conclusionthat the owner of the original text, which was, according to him, later copied inour codex, was a duke, more precisely a Silesian duke (as Ganszyniec identifies anumber of Germanicisms in the text), probably Wladislas of Opole (1356–1401).71It would be difficult at the moment to offer a scenario for the fifteenth-centurystory of the text (and the codex) that could be satisfactory in every respect; any ofthe possible solutions leaves open at least as many questions as it answers.

If our text is a copy,then the owner of the original could have been anyone. However, if we chooseWladislas I, who was in power during the period from which the handwriting canbe dated, then the question is who and for what purpose did illuminate the codexwith his picture and coat of arms fifty years after his death. And finally, if we wantto arrive at a compromise between these solutions, proposing that the text an dthebook can be related to more than one king called Wladislas, perhaps even to three ofthem—this series of owners might account for the confusing terminology of kingsand dukes in the text—but then the number of other problems only multiply.72Solving the problem of ownership might shed some light on the no less obscureissue of authorship, and vice versa. More precisely, it is not an author we are look-ing for in the sense that he composed the prayers, but rather a compiler, who hada number of magical and devotional texts in front of him, and who interpolatedthem in one final collection, incorporating the short crystallomantic formula, andsubstituting the usual “N,” which stands for the operator in the magical literature,with the name Wladislas. Although we do not know his identity, we do knowsomething of how he worked and what kind of person he was.His work reveals first of all that the Liber visionum—which, despite its Frenchorigin, has survived primarily in copies of North Italian, German, and Austrianprovenance73—had a certain Polish (or Silesian, or eastern German) circulation inthe late fourteenth or early fifteenth century. Not only did our compiler know it,he knew it well, and apparently even recognized its close relationship with the Arsnotoria.It is possible that he put the two texts next to each other on his table (hemay have owned only a shorter version of the Ars notoria), or had one manuscript180P T: T  H72. Ye Jagiellonian coat of arms was probably added to the miniatures in the prayer book in the1490s. As it is generally known, several unfinished codices of the library of King Matthias were com-pleted in Buda under his successor, Wladislas II. Ye royal workshop, of course, replaced the Corvin-ian raven with the Jagiellonian eagle on the decorations. For further details, see Csaba Csapodi,“Quando cessò l’attività della bottega di miniatura di Mattia?” Acta Historiae Artium Academiae Sci-entiarum Hungaricae (1968): 223–33; Csapodi and Csapodiné Gárdonyi, Bibliotheca Corviniana,29–30. For examples of the Polish white eagle inserted in the codices of the Corvinian library, seeibid., plates 41, 51, and 57. Either this prayer book was one of these inherited codices or one thatthe new king brought with him from Kraków to Buda, in which case it was never in the CorvinianLibrary. Wladislas II, however, was certainly not the first owner of the codex. It was written or copiedduring the reign of a previous king, Wladislas I (the “Varnenczyk”), adapted perhaps for his pur-poses. Now, either the identity of the copyist and the author coincide, and in this case we have arrivedat the point of origin of the text, or the prayer book was copied from an earlier example, which mayhave been commissioned by a Jagiellonian duke, Opole, or the grand duke of Lithuania.73. On the surviving copies of the Liber visionum,see the lists of manuscripts in Fanger and Láng,“John of Morigny’s Liber visionum,” and in Claire Fanger and Nicholas Watson, “Some Further Man-uscripts Containing Copies of the Liber visionum of John of Morigny,” Societas Magica Newsletter 12(2004): 4–5.06 Chapter 6:Sample.qxd 10/10/2008 8:52 AM Page 180"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"in front of him containing both works.74Yese two works, however, cover onlypart of the magical content of the prayer book. From that we may conclude thathe also had a profound acquaintance with other magical experiments involvingcrystals, mirrors, and circles. He managed to combine two components: prayersto angels borrowed from the Ars notoria and its derivatives on the one hand, andthe practice of crystallomancy on the other. What makes his literary product re -markable is that for this combination we had known no earlier example than theangelic conversations of John Dee in the late sixteenth century.75Yis person, an attentive reader of the Ars notoria and the Liber visionum,fol-lowed the terminology of his sources (as far as his own terminology can be observedat all, since he constantly incorporated alien paragraphs in his texts): he used therare expression ars exceptiva to designate the magical arts;76he used the term “spir-its” in order to avoid mentioning demons, used arsto refer to the notory art,77andemphasized the power of words and divine names.78He was, furthermore, commit-ted to the goals of his sources (for which the Liber visionum had been condemned):he sought perfect knowledge, and he wanted to know “all the secrets which arecontained under the four elements.”Ye scribes of texts of ritual magic tended to make new works by combining,rearranging, and revising material taken from one or more older ones.79Yus, theauthor of Wladislas’s prayer book used material from the Liber visionum, which inturn had been constructed using material taken from the Ars notoria.And just asthe Ars notoria was considered heretical, so too was the Liber visionum. If this is so,then why was Wladislas’s prayer book, made up as it was from materials taken fromboth, not condemned as well? Ye difference lies in the reception and the distri -bution of each. Unlike the other two, the prayer book was intended for a reader-ship that was much smaller than that of the Ars notoria and much more tolerantthan that of the Liber visionum.Ye compiler of Wladislas’s prayer book, like John of Morigny,80was a R M  C18174.

Both seem to havebeen practitioners, and although the fifteenth-century compiler is not as forthcom-ing about his own experience as the fourteenth-century Brother John (or, moreprecisely, says nothing in his own words), both offer an insight into the world of thereaders and operators of the techniques of the Ars notoria.Finally, neither of themintended to write a popular handbook of magic aimed at the satisfaction of dubi-ous needs. Instead, they created a genre in which it is hard to decide whether magicor religion plays the more important role. Beyond this, of course, there are alsomany differences between them—one of them was a real author, while the otherwas a compiler, among other things—which I will not go into here.As to who the compiler of the prayer book was, or where he lived, it is possibleto speculate with some confidence. From what we know about the disseminationof magical texts in this part of Europe, I think it unlikely that the references andresources he would have needed would have been available at the court of a Polishor Lithuanian duke in the fourteenth century. However, if this text was written inthe fifteenth century, then we have a candidate for its authorship. In 1429 a mem-ber of the household of King Wladislas I, Henry the Bohemian (Henricus Bohe-mus), was accused of and condemned for practicing crystallomancy and keepingnecromantic books. Like Conrad Kyeser, the author of the Bellifortis,Henry wasa respected figure at a royal court whose political influence was greater than hisrank. And as an influential member of the royal court, he was present at the birthof Wladislas I and stayed close to the future king when he was yet a child, that is,when Wladislas still had superiors. And finally, he was from Bohemia, which mightaccount for the Germanicisms in the text. At any rate, in the 1440s he was againliving freely in Kraków, where he had plenty of opportunity and the necessary ref-erences at his disposal, as well as a background in crystallomancy to compose aroyal prayer book for Wladislas I.Before completing our analysis, we can pause for a moment to speculate aboutthe reasons why such a source was copied at all. Was it meant to serve actual prac-tice or a mere reading? In the case of the magical manuscripts, usually no definiteanswer can be given to the question of whether the inclusion of magic in a givencodex indicates actual practices or simple curiosity. Yese texts do not specifywhether their scribes tried to test their instructions, and fabricated talismans. As arule, medieval folios do not tell us the intentions of their scribes. Fortunately, theprayer book of Wladislas is not so silent, and contains internal evidence indicat-ing actual application. In the texts of ritual magic the operator is usually designatedmerely by the letter “N” (implying that the actual user has to substitute his namewherever he reads “N”): in the royal prayer book, “N” is always replaced with“Wladislas.” In the Liber visionum John of Morigny explains that each person whowishes to use the prayers of his book must copy his own volume by his own hand,182P T: T  H06 Chapter 6:Sample.qxd 10/10/2008 8:52 AM Page 182"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"substituting his name for that of John, and then consecrate the copy. Of course,John is aware that his name is fairly frequent, and therefore he stresses that eventhose persons who are also called John must reproduce the book with their ownhands if they really want to use it.81Indeed, most of the extant copies of the Libervisionumare not mere copies of the original version, but handbooks copied andused by a certain Albertus (of Judenberg),82a Petrus,83a Bernardus,84and othermedieval readers with different names. Yus the substitution of the name Wladis-las in the prayer book seems to imply that it was made for real use, it was conse-crated, and its crystallomantic formula and angelic prayers were probably indeedapplied by a certain Wladislas.85It is not likely, of course, that a king copied thetext with his own hands in order to render the prayers effective, but this is not aproblem, because according to John, the actual work of copying may be done byanother, as long as it is done under the name of the prospective user.86In conse-quence, certain copies of the Liber visionum and the prayer book of King Wladis-las constitute those few cases when magical texts themselves expose the fact thatthe books containing them were consecrated and used as real manuals.U  A  M PWe have manuscripts and testimonies on the notory art in Western Europe thatdate back to the early years of the thirteenth century.

As usual, the closer something is to orthodoxy, the morevigilant resistance it provokes. Official Christianity saw the magical reinter pre -tation of its own prayers as an intolerable abuse, refused to accept the notory artas a holy procedure, and found its aims—intellectual and mental perfection—dangerously ambitious. Nonetheless, the condemnations rarely turned into actualprosecutions (the case of John of Morigny being one exception), a fact that explainshow a number of high-quality manuscripts survived. When we compare this rateof survival and the beauty of the illumination of some Ars notoriamanuscriptswith those of demonic magic, the difference is striking. Contrasted, for example,with the relatively schematic drawings of the necromancer’s manual published byKieckhefer, the artistic value of the notae of many of the surviving copies of theArs notoria—as well as the regularity of the handwriting—indicate that they weremade with great care and patience, which was only possible in the professional cir-cumstances provided by a scriptorium.88Ye artistic quality and the breadth of dissemination of these texts indicate apersistent interest in a nonscholastic way of acquiring knowledge. But whose inter-est is this? Where are we to look for the practitioners of the notory art? Ye unde-niably religious nature of the Ars,its devotional goals, as well as its emphasis onritual preparations, purity, confession, and abstinence, point to the monasteries.Indeed, owners of Ars notoriatexts can be identified among the monks of the SaintAugustine monastery in Canterbury, who incorporated this art in volumes of devo-tional collections. Ye prologue of the Liber visionum by John of Morigny alsooffers—from a unique and personal perspective—evidence to support the suspi-cion that monks and students were among the enthusiastic readers of works onritual magic, and particularly of the Ars notoria.His account also supplements ourpicture on how ritual magic was transmitted: John practiced it in the company ofJohannes, a Cistercian monk, and Gurgeta, his own sister. Apparently, the notoryart was taught and learned in a monastic community, one monk introducing theother to the practices, and it was indeed seen as a ritual system of acquiring knowl-edge. Ye presence of the Ars notoriain such religious contexts may make us think,nonetheless, that its pious aspects were taken as seriously as its magical components,if not more so.89But monks and clerics were not the only ones who read (and recited?) its prayers.Yere were copies of the Ars notoriain royal and ducal libraries, among them, thelibraries of Charles V and Charles VI of France. It was also found appealing by thedukes of Milan: as their three book lists testify, they had at least two copies of the Ars184P T: T  H88.

Despitethe fact that most of the extant Liber visionum manuscripts were written only afew hundred kilometers to the west of the region studied here, that is, in the HolyRoman Empire, apart from the sections in the prayer book of Wladislas, no copiesof John’s text are known to have been made in Poland, Bohemia, or Hungary. Asfor the Ars notoria,only one example of it was known until recently: the afore-mentioned one-page-long Kraków fragment, which was written in the fourteenthcentury and survived in the binding of a medieval codex.93Yet we should not forget that versions of the genre of ritual magic are highlydivergent, they occur under numerous titles and incipits, and we have every hopethat an increasing number of new sources will be identified in the future. Indeed,two more copies of the Ars notoriahave been found recently, one in Prague andone in Kraków.Ye Prague manuscript (PNK I F 35) contains the first part of the Ars notoria,the Flores aurei. Yis text is unique in the region for two reasons: first, it is the onlyversion that is longer than a few folios; and second, it is the only version with anillustration—a drawing of the most wise Solomon’s magical rings (Plate 25). YeFlores aureiis followed by a text called the Ars memorativa,a usual alternative titlefor the Ars notoria,but this time it refers to the real art of memory.94Both texts werecopied by the owner and actual author of some of the works in the codex, FraterMattheus Beran, in 1431. Yat the inclusion of the Flores aurei in this collec-tion of useful texts was not accidental, but a result of conscious editorial work, isR M  C18590.

In the explicitof the text, for example, Beranmakes it clear that he himself copied “this most holy divine art,” and calls thereader’s attention to what has frequently been emphasized in the text, namely thatanyone who wishes to practice it must go to confession, lead a chaste life, fast, andpray with bent knees in front of the cross. In addition, though the prayers in -cluded in the text are something of a departure in tone from the scientific orien-tation of the volume, the promises of this art to introduce its user to the liberalarts fit the general character of the whole book perfectly, and its emphasis on theart of memory makes it a suitable neighbor to the survey on the methods of remem-bering that follows it.Ye Kraków Ars notoria occurs in a codex that has already been examined onseveral occasions in the previous chapters. BJ 551 is an otherwise astronomicallyoriented collection of scientific texts compiled in Prague in the last quarter of thefourteenth century, which came after some travels into the possession of a Krakówstudent at the end of the fifteenth century. (It is an interesting coincidence thatErfurt and Vienna, two places mentioned in relation to the history of the manu-script, are also the cities where Mattheus Beran, the owner of PNK I F 35, seemsto have studied.)95On the empty folios between the astronomical treatises, how-ever, someone has inscribed alchemical recipes, Latin and German magical for-mulas, a treatise on chiromancy later crossed out, parts of the Secretum mulierumof Pseudo-Albertus Magnus, and finally, embedded in this magical context, a rel-atively short work belonging to the Ars notoriatradition.96Ye rituals presentedin this excerpt are supposed to start at a new moon, and the practitioner—havingfulfilled his duties concerning fasting, chastity and physical and mental purity—is to settle himself with bent knees while reciting prayers to Eloy, Adonay, Athanatos,Tetragrammaton, Pantheon,and other names of God in order to attain the usualobjectives of the notory art: intellectual perfection, learning, the strengthening ofmemory, the ability to solve scientific problems, and the ability to understand dif-ficult books. To achieve this last-mentioned goal, for example, the practitioner isto write the letters alpha and omega on his right palm before starting the rituals.Yis action will give a dream telling him where he should open the book the nextmorning to acquire its content directly.97Naturally, all these practices are strictlymandated under the control of Christ and God.Yis four-page-long section on understanding difficult books is not found inthe earliest extant versions of the Ars notoria, but seems to constitute a slightlylater addition, which apparently did not always travel with the Flores aurei and the186P T: T  H95.CBJ, 3:344–45.96.

Yis codex is anotherexample of the tendency of abbreviated versions, and excerpts, of the Ars notoria,to travel in the company of works on astrology, alchemy, natural philosophy, andchiromancy, un like full-length versions, which tended to travel alone, or in thecompany of other works of ritual magic.99Indeed, this is what happens in BJ 551:excerpted Ars notoria prayers and rituals are integrated into a scientific, medical,and alchemical context.Before we conclude our chapter on the magical use and misuse of Christian for-mulas, it is worth mentioning a text that does not belong strictly to the traditionof Ars notoria,one which, however, constitutes a completely original piece of Chris-tian ritual magic. In a one-page-long fourteenth-century manuscript bound to a codex of the Biblioteka Jagiellońska,100a woman called Elisabeth prays to God to secure—or perhaps to regain—the love of her husband Yeoderic.101Ye textstarts rather innocently, as an ordinary prayer: God, Christ, and the Holy Trinityare begged to assure the feelings of the couple so that neither man, woman, northe devil can stand between them. After this, however, the prayer turns into a con-juration: Elisabeth conjures her own husband with the power of divine names, suchas Ely, Eloy, Eloe, Yosdy, Sabaoth, Adonay, Tetragrammaton, Saday, Messyas, Sother,Emanuel,and even Yskyros, Athanatos, Arethon, Melchar, and Stramchon,so that—as a deer wishes to come to the fountains—Yeoderic may desire to come to Elis-abeth, and act according to her wishes.102Ye uniqueness of this text lies in its alleged author: it is a woman who per-forms a Latin conjuration; it is she who uses Christian formulas for the purposesof love magic. Why is that so exceptional? Because, while love magic was mostlyattributed to women in the Middle Ages, the actual manuscripts, paradoxically, tendto take the viewpoint of men, except for perhaps this single source. It is very likelythat this Latin text, signed in a rather official way by both spouses, may have beenR M  C18798.

Andreas Costen, forexample, a student at the University of Kraków and the scribe of a Prague codexthat contains texts on astrology, weather forecasting, and the Centiloquium ofHermes, made his copying principles fairly clear in the explicitof the text. Whilecollecting and copying these texts, Andreas remarks, he omitted the mystical andtheological sense, and concentrated consequently on the practical side.4MattheusBeran, a monk from the monastery of Rudnicz and a former student of medicineat the University of Prague, concludes his great Confundarius,containing medicaland magical readings, with the following words: “/is has been written with myown hands, through many years, in different countries and various places, and frommarvelous exemplars.”5/at is to say that he made considerable effort to collectall these works on the occult power of stones, herbs, and animals, as well as a copyof the Ars notoriafrom various sources and lands, which effort—as it is implied—makes his collection of texts a rather rare and precious reading. To give a furtherexample of how the interest of a book owner may be reconstructed, we can referto the case of Jan Oswiecim (d. 1488). Oswiecim, a master of the University ofKraków, purchased a number of books with mostly medical and astronomical, butpartially magical content. /ese books belonged formerly to Oswiecim’s older con-frère,Andrzej Grzymala, and were sold when Grzymala died in 1466. Oswiecimprepared accurate tables of contents in each of his new acquisitions, but interest-ingly, he omitted the divinatory texts from the list of titles. It seems, therefore, thatthe magical content of these medical codices reflects the interest of the former own-ers (for example, that of Grzymala) rather than that of Oswiecim.6Usually, however, scribes and collectors did not want to divulge to us what theirviewpoint was when selecting their sources. In the absence of a suitable quantityof such records, we can—and as a matter of fact, we did—approach the issue of themotives of scribes in another way. /is consists of observing the tendencies of mag-ical texts to occur together or in the company of texts of certain, well-defined schol-arly genres, for example, astrology.

Second, as Frank Klaassen has put it, “It would behazardous to assume that any codex containing a single magical work represents acompiler or scribe with active and practical magical interests.” In addition, “/eexistence of a particular manuscript version of a work of astrological image magictells us only that someone wanted a copy of it and does not, in itself, suggest thescribe’s attitude towards it. /e question remains as to why it was copied, what theother interests of those responsible might have been, and how they chose to inter-pret, categorize, and employ the treatise.”7/e manuscript evidence on its own does not tell us whether a text of magicwas just an accidental part of the codex containing it or whether it was includedthere with a specific and active interest in the topic.Looking for a satisfactory answer to these questions—an answer not providedby the examination of the manuscript context of the magical works—leads us toa third strategy of approaching the motives of scribes. In the following chapters, Iwill attempt to proceed along this line of investigation: instead of single manu-scripts, I am going to concentrate on book collections; instead of individual scribesand collectors, I am going to focus on their social context. /is means that for-merly discussed sources and persons will occasionally turn up again in the three fol-lowing chapters; the approach, however, will be different.

In two excursus, two interesting side-problems will be discussed.First, we will examine to what extent and in which cases the interest in and the prac-tice of learned magic became an issue in court cases, in other words, to what extentthe use of magic was criminalized. Second, we will take a closer look at a phe-nomenon little known in the Middle Ages but which thrived in the Renaissance:we will see how self-appointed magicians consciously constructed their image, andthen—with conscious manipulation of their public—increased their fame as magi-cians and spread reports of their magical expertise and achievements.I: T M  I  S 1937.

He became a prior in 1432, and five years later he waselected the abbot of the Benedictine monastery of Seitenstetten, which is a remark-able ecclesiastical career for someone who had had such an intimate relationshipwith demons. He died as abbot of Seitenstetten in 1441.From the Formicarius it seems that the conversation between Nider and the monktook place at some point when Benedictus was already a prior but before he be -came an abbot. Since Nider was in Vienna between 1434 and 1436, this is prob-ably when they met, which furthermore means that the future abbot had practicednecromancy around 1424–26 (that is, a decade earlier), just slightly before hebecame a monk. Nider’s account is corroborated in other small details, too: forexample, Benedictus must really have been a gigantic man, as his large tombstonetestifies to this. Various further reports, data, and pieces of information have sur-vived about this strange individual; his name is mentioned in the Catalogue of theSeitenstetten Abbots,in theNecrology Notesof the Vienna Schottenkloster, and—rather understandably—on his tombstone in Seitenstetten.4If all this weren’t enough, he appears once again in a curious story, but only ina supporting role. /e story is told this time by Martin von Leibitz, abbot of theSchottenkloster between 1446 and 1461.

Still, there is something magical in her appearance: by tellingthe nobleman the exact date of his death, her role—however blasphemous it maysound—is somewhat similar to the functioning of the famous onomantic device,the Sphere of Pythagoras, which is used to foretell whether someone will die ornot, and whether death will arrive in one, two, or three weeks.Nevertheless, the Virgin Mary, the involvement of the sisters, and the torment-ing demons would certainly not constitute parallels strong enough for supposingthat there is more here than pure coincidence. /e main reason why the questionof these analogies should be raised at all is that the cloister where Benedictus becamea prior, the Vienna Schottenkloster, hosts one of those few monastic librarieswhere the Liber visionum of John of Morigny and the Ars notoriasurvived. /ecodex, which contains the first and some excerpts from the second, is dated to1377, that is, before Benedictus’s lifetime.6(It is even more remarkable that themonastery of Seitenstetten, where Benedictus later became abbot, also keeps a fairlyearly copy of the Liber visionum; this one, however, was acquired by the abbeymuch later, in all probability, not before modern times.)7On the basis of all this,I would not exclude the possibility that the Liber visionum and the Ars notoriacould be among those libri demonum de nigromantiathat Benedictus, the formernecromancer and future abbot, possessed according to the account of JohannesNider, and I would even conjecture that he himself might have played some rolein the chain of events that brought these texts to Schotten Abbey.8M   C C197pestilenci tam diu aegrotarent et tandem morerentur, quin infra convaluerunt; tamen sicut dixit itafactum fuit.

Interest in learned magic is apparently detectable inthe church on a higher level, too. As we have seen, in Abbot Trithemius’s ChroniconHirsaugiensisthere is a whole list of bishops and archbishops whose names were—rightly or not—associated with alchemy, to which list of alleged or real “alchemists”the names of Conrad of Vechta, the archbishop of Prague, and that of NicolausOlah, the archbishop of Esztergom, can also be added.9A certain theoretical interest in the functioning of magic can be reconstructedin the case of the fourteenth-century Hungarian archbishop of Csanád, Jacobus ofPiacenza. Jacobus’s curiosity lay not so much in the actual practice of magic as inits “secondary literature.” /e archbishop, who was also a medical doctor, led quitean eventful life. He studied medicine in Bologna, where in 1319 he was accusedof having participated in stealing a corpse—supposedly in order to satisfy his inter-est in anatomy. Returning to Hungary, he became the doctor of King CharlesRobert in 1332, somewhat later he was elected to be the archbishop of Csanád,and he died in 1348 as the archbishop of Zagreb.10An indication of his highstanding at the royal court was that he accompanied the king on his travels toItaly, and that he was sent on a diplomatic mission to meet the pope in Avignonin 1343. It was in Avignon that he ordered the copying of a number of manu-scripts of medical content, which he brought to Zagreb, possibly with the inten-tion of founding a medical school.One of these codices contains the earliest surviving copy of Arnald of Villa -nova’s Letter on Necromancy.11/is letter was written around 1280 to the bishop198P T: R  Cthere is a real link between Benedictus’s necromantic interest and the presence of the Liber visionumin the two monastic libraries.9.

Only with reservations. /e reasons for skep-ticism are to be found in the author’s life. Milíč was by no means an ordinarypreacher. A former member of Emperor Charles IV’s chancery and a self-appointedpreacher, Milíč had quite a strange career. Among the many novelistic events ofhis life, we can mention that he—together with his ex-prostitute disciples—man-aged to take over a famous brothel in Prague known as “Venice,” consecrate it, andrebaptize it as “Jerusalem.”17He then decided it was necessary to share his viewsof church reform and the coming of the Antichrist with the highest church author-ities as soon as possible. He went to Rome, but when he began to preach publiclyin Saint Peter’s, he was arrested by the Inquisition. He summarized his apocalyp-tic ideas in a small book titled Libellus de Antichristowhile still in prison. He waslater released, went back to Prague, but returned to the eternal city with his reformideas several times in the following years. He died on the return leg of his finaljourney, this time to Avignon, where he met Pope Gregory XI.Such motifs were not, however, the only reasons why his person became the sub-ject of controversies. In his many sermons delivered in Czech, German, and Latin,Milíč openly criticized the corruption of the clergy and the morals of the mendi-cant orders. He did not refrain from accusing priests of neglecting their duties,drinking too much, visiting brothels, practicing simony, and so on, and he wassubsequently accused of accusing too many. Once again, what we can maintainabout the content of his sermon is no more than that clerics wereactually criticizedfor their magical activity and for abusing the liturgy for superstitious practices.

Unfortunately, at thepresent stage of research, no Central European monastery can rival the reputationof St. Augustine’s of Canterbury, where the concentration of magic books in thelibrary—copied and collected by the monks—was so high that David Pingreesimply called it a “center for magical studies.” /e modern historian of this libraryis in an enviable position indeed: not only did a large portion of the magical codicessurvive, but even the specific donors and owners can be identified, their role in thehistory of St. Augustine’s described, and their attraction toward magic in the frame-work of the monks’ interest in sciences and religion contextualized.18No Polish, Bohemian, or Hungarian monastic collection can be compared tothe library in Canterbury, either with regard to a well-definable magical interest,or to the abundance of the evidence that has come down to us. Even though theircodices usually did not survive, cloister libraries of the region can be reconstructedto a certain extent: often the lists of manuscripts survived even when the manu-scripts themselves did not.19And as far as one can judge from a mere list of titles,these libraries in Central Europe rarely included magical items. Here, however,serious methodological problems arise. First of all, in such lists, most manuscriptsare indicated by a single title, even when they contain from two or three to fifty orsixty distinct works. Sometimes manuscripts are not even mentioned by title butby a description, such as “medical texts” or even simply “various texts.” Did suchmanuscripts contain treatises on talismanic or divinatory magic scattered amongthe scientific tracts, as many of the codices thus far examined did, or not? And themanuscripts described only as containing “liturgical texts”? Is it not often in suchvolumes that copies of the Liber visionumhave survived?

Among the positive examples one can mention the ampleevidence for the considerable role that alchemy played in the life of certain monks(a question explored in detail in Chapter 5), and also a few manuscripts containingdivinatory practices that once belonged to the Augustinians in Brno.20A bit moresurprising perhaps, is a Bible found in the library of the Franciscans in Gyöngyös(Hungary) that betrays an interest in treasure hunting quite out of character for amendicant order. On the blank pages of this printed Latin Bible, someone recordedan “experimentum,” in fact, an incantation in Hungarian, sometime between 1529and 1541. /e addressee of this charm is no other than a divining rod, over whichthe operator first makes the sign of a cross, then orders and obliges it—in the nameof God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit—not to become a “struggler” inwhat is asked from it, and to reveal the locations of all hidden treasures.

However, just as in the case of the Gyöngyös Bible, this attribution is notunchallenged.27Besides these singular and isolated examples, when neither the scribes nor theprecise readership of the texts can be identified, there is basically one single monas-tic community in the region that shows a relatively coherent interest in learnedmagic,28the Augustinian monastery of Třeboň (Wittingau), in southern Bohemia,founded by the early Rožmberks in 1367.29/is Bohemian aristocratic family wasalways generous with its monastic libraries as far as book donations were concerned.Reports indicate that since the mid-fourteenth century, the erudite members of thefamily had enriched their monasteries scattered all around South Bohemia, namelyČeský Krumlov, Zlatá Koruna, Písek, and first of all Třeboň, with manuscripts writ-ten and decorated in their own scriptoria.30Among those Prague manuscripts that were surely in Třeboň in the fifteenthcentury, we have already mentioned the Confundarius(A Compilation, or A Mix-ture of /ings) written and collected by Mattheus Beran, as containing the onlylong Ars notoria text in the region. Mattheus Beran was a medical doctor.31He wasa member of the Augustinian monastery in Rudnicz (Roudnice) and educated atthe universities of Paris, Vienna, and Erfurt. He became a medical doctor at somepoint before 1418, after which he returned to his monastery. Like John of Morigny,he was both a student and a monastic, and was explicitly interested in the notoryart, but unlike John, he incorporated it openly in his medical manual. For reasonsunknown to us, this manual went later to the cloister of Třeboň, and arrived finallyat the private library of the Rožmberk family. It is difficult to say whether the Flo-res aurei,that is, the first section of the Ars notoria copied in the last part of theConfundarius,was consulted by the monks in any of these monasteries. What makesthe case interesting, nevertheless, is that both Třeboň and Rudnicz were Augus-tinian cloisters, just like the Canterbury monastery, so it seems that the relatively204P T: R  C27.

Beran repeatedly claims in various points of the codex that he collected thetexts with considerable effort, carefully choosing them on the basis of their effi-cacy. In the explicitof the whole codex, at the end of the text of the Ars memora-tiva,he further adds that the selection and the copying were carried out throughmany years in many places from many exemplars, and his aim was to include thetexts in one single book, the Confundarium maius.32He is so confident about theutility of the content of his book that in the beginning of his own lapidary text heeven feels obliged to explain that when he had put this knowledge of stones intopractice, it proved so effective that those who saw the result, believed it was gen-uine necromancy.33/e table of contents on the first page, which lists the titles in alphabeticalorder and gives their page numbers, reinforces the impression that he meant hiscodex to be used as a handbook. Finally, the practicability of the manual was alsoserved by the fact that the compiler included the Czech translation of many Latinterms (for example, the name of herbs) in the margins, and also that he consis-tently arranged his inventories of stones, plants, trees, animals, and their influenceon the health of men in alphabetical order./e codex contains texts from different disciplines of the science of nature,most of them concentrating on medical issues.

Yet, indirectly, we may be able toexplore the circumstances of such an obscure case by surveying what learned magichad to do with royal courts, and what place books of magic occupied in royal bookcollections.,e royal court as a genuine place for magical practices and divination wasalready a central theme in the second book of John of Salisbury’sPolicraticus (1159).During his long career at various courts of the twelfth century, John had the oppor-tunity personally to observe the temptation magic posed for the ambitious courtierswhose insecure life depended too much upon the quickly changing will of theirseigneurs,and who in consequence often consulted magicians in order to learntheir futures or turned to magic to further their careers.2Indeed, magic was alwaysready to offer the appropriate means: pleasing the king, gaining his benevolence,changing the attitude of one’s lord, influencing the opinion of others, gaining thelove of one’s mistress, that is, all the objectives that a courtier may have wanted toreach, were among the usual motives that the basic texts of image magic promisedto their readers. ,e permanent needs of the courtiers in these fields provided sta-ble employment for court magicians. Not less decisive might have been the rulers’own desires: to foresee the outcome of complicated political conflicts, to reveal thehidden intentions of the subjects, or simply to know the most appropriate momentto establish a university were issues belonging to the competence and “research field”of a court astrologer or a personal magician.3,e next two sections focus on specific actors of the courtly life who can beviewed as magicians and divinators satisfying the needs listed above. ,is will be fol-lowed by an excursuson such cases when these magicians, such as Nicholas the Hang-man, found themselves in front of a tribunal. ,e final section investigates the extentto which the book collections of royal libraries reflected the interests of rulers andcourtiers in magic.T K   “M”Learned magic was available in royal courts in the form of written texts in thelibraries on the one hand, but it was also present in the activity of its practitioners,210P T: R  C2.

In manycases, magic appears only in the phase of the accusation; the high respect of a sim-ple scientist or a court doctor can be easily undermined with the accusation ofmaleficiumby the jealous opponents even if the doctor in question was never inter-ested in this topic.,e history of Central Europe provides abundant examples of such cases. As anexample of the magician offering his intellectual abilities to his sovereign, we haveseen the case of the author of Wladislas’s prayer book. One can only speculate aboutthe influence such a learned man could have had at his disposal, a person who com-piled a book of a most intimate and devotional nature for his king, a book whichpromised superhuman power to its reader. It is probably not an exaggeration tosuppose that the knowledge possessed by such an individual might have seemedfairly precious for his lord. In other cases, the magician’s intellectual contributionhad not only religious but also political overtones: Melchior, the author of thealchemical Mass, the Processus sub forma missae,dedicated a book to his king thatcontained not only alchemical elements and liturgy but also exhortations againstthe military threat of the Turks.Magic, when something went wrong, could cause the magician flee from thecourt. ,e alchemist John of Laz had to escape the wrath of the Empress Barbara,the reasons being precisely related to the practice of alchemy.

However, there might have been other reasons for Kyeser’sdismissal. As his masterpiece, the Bellifortis, testifies at several points, Kyeser con-sciously played the role of the court magician. Besides the technical mechanisms,his handbook contains magical recipes, amulets, methods to cause the enemy tosee visions, and devices against demonic activity. In one of the pictures he himselfappears in a castle tower invoking spirits (Plate 4). Even the engines and machin-ery that he describes have a terrifying appearance, one looking like a marvelous cat,the other like a monster. In an epitaph composed for himself, his fate seems toanticipate that of Faust: his fame has shone forth everywhere, and his Bellifortisovercame whole armies, but as a price for his mastery in this science, his death willbe most horrible, and he will be “cast down to Wrath.”4,e inspiring (althoughfar from being proven) theory put forward by Eamon is nothing other than theidea that it was Kyeser himself who was responsible for his own expulsion. “Delib-erately projecting an image of himself as a powerful sorcerer,” he became the victimof this image, which could have been used against him in a politically motivatedtrial.5Proficiency in magic could have lead to royal appreciation at one point, andto banishment from the court at another.In other cases, it was not any actual magical interest, but only rumors and gos-sip about alleged practices, that forced someone into the role of the magician. Itwas rather easy to accuse someone that he abused magic in order to gain politicalinfluence when there was no other visible reason why a simple, non-noble uni-versity doctor had advanced suddenly from obscurity to a high position in thepolitical hierarchy. At the court of Emperor Wenceslas, there were two such cases,that of Conrad of Vechta and Albicus of Uniczow, two scientists who subsequently(and consecutively) became archbishops of Prague.Conrad of Vechta (originally from Westphalia) appeared in the circles of KingWenceslas in 1395, in three years he became a member of the royal council, between1401 and 1405 he was chancellor, after 1408 bishop of Olomouc, and finally in1413 archbishop of Prague.6His swift ascent to a position of power and influencehad caused considerable amazement and envy: contemporary political pamphletssuggested that Conrad’s good reputation in the eyes of the king was simply due to212P T: R  C4.

He was born around1360, earned a master’s degree from the Faculty of Arts of the University of Praguein 1386, and three years later further degrees both in law and medicine.9He ad -vanced very quickly at the royal court, and earned the respect of two emperors: hebecame the personal physician of Wenceslas IV in 1404, and probably kept thisposition under Wenceslas’s successor, Sigismund. When the previous archbishopdied in 1411, and there was an urgent need for a successor, Albicus’s appointmentprovoked some shock; nevertheless, he held the office for only a year.10A few yearslater, when Wenceslas died in 1419, Albicus left Prague and went to Buda, wherehe died in 1427.11His literary output is ample: he wrote a great variety of medicaltracts, more than fifty health regimens, recipes, descriptions on illnesses and bodilyproblems, treatises on the plague, and so on.12His Latin and German writings werewidespread in medieval handbooks; several of the manuscripts discussed in thisbook contain them,13and three of his works were even printed.Albicus was involved in political intrigues, and his enemies were numerous.Among them, we find his own pupil, the famous court astrologer and future uni-versity rector, Christian of Prachatitz.14All in all, it is not surprising that Albicuswas accused of a number of crimes: simony in order to earn the archiepiscopalposition, avarice, and disqualification. Certain stories went as far as accusing himof practicing necromancy in the company of his king and protector. AlthoughM   C C2137. F. M.

Sincethis was not the first time he had brought to trial on such charges, his life was inserious danger, his execution a real possibility.Henry was not an average personality of Polish history. “Magister Henricus genereBohemus” (Master Henry from the Bohemian nation)—as Jan Długosz, the greatPolish historian, reports—was a talented astronomer residing at the royal court ofWladislas Jagiello from 1423 to the autumn of 1427. He was held in high respectand was close to Queen Sophie. ,is is shown, inter alia,by the fact that he wasallowed to be present at the births of the king’s three sons and even cast their horo-scopes.20In spite of this high esteem, in 1429 Henry was accused of Hussitism,using astrology and magic to find hidden treasure (apparently with demonic assis-tance), and possession of forbidden necromantic books.214P T: R  C15.

In his per-son, a rather important figure of the Polish Middle Ages undertook the duty of theinvestigations. He was the first rector of the renewed University of Kraków and asevere polemist in matters related to the Hussite movement. He had also partici-pated at the Council of Constance, and he was—at the time of Henry’s trial—thevicar-general of the archbishop of Kraków.21He was a most adequate person forthis task, not only because of his proficiency in theological issues related to Hus-sitism, but also thanks to his competence in magical issues, primarily concerningpopular practices.22In Henry’s case, however, Stanislas was faced with a slightlydifferent set of problems: instead of folk charms and spells, instead of agriculturalmagic and divination from the candle, instead of midwives and superstitious womenwho walked around their fields with crosses,23here he was faced with learned rit-ual magic and its usual inventory: necromantic books, magic circles, a crystal, anda young boy. He was in the position of handling Henry over to lay authorities asa heretic and irrecoverable backslider, which would have meant the end of theastrologer’s life. However—as Stanislas diplomatically implied—the royal dynastywas also involved in the trial thanks to Henry’s good standing at the court and hispopularity in Kraków as an astrologer, and this protection saved his life: he was“only” imprisoned for life.24M   C C21521.

He devoted one of his many sermons (Magistris non incli-navi aurem meam) to the question of superstitions, and he also advanced some original theologicalarguments against the popular practices of magic. It is significant that these arguments are not bor-rowed from Nicolaus Jawor’s De superstitionibus,which was already a classic antimagical text by histime.

How-ever, Henry is not mentioned either in the Album studiosorumor in the Liber pro-motionumof the University of Kraków, and even Stanislaus of Skalbimierz impliesthat Henry was not actually a magister.35Whether he brought his title from Pragueis dubious and depends greatly upon which of the many astronomers of Bohe -mian history called Henricus he might have been.36Since there is no consensus onthis question, we can only claim that at least three, but possibly four, persons inthis company of magicians had university educations.Henry’s crystal-gazing and treasure-hunting methods, as well as his books, indi-cate an expertise in magic as elaborate as, and in many respects similar to, thatwhich we find in the prayer book of Wladislas (see Chapter 6). ,ese two examplesof Polish crystallomancy are strikingly close to each other in time. ,us it remainsnow to examine whether there is any evidence supporting our earlier conjecturethat Henry was the author of Wladislas’s prayer book.First of all, we should remember that King Wladislas Warnenczyk, whom wehave identified as a possible owner of the prayer book, was one of the three princeswhose birth Henry had attended. We furthermore see that at the end of his trialHenry avoided capital punishment, and even though he was finally jailed, some-what later he managed to leave prison, and lived freely in Kraków.37In the ActaOfficialia Cracoviensis several notes report that Henricus Bohemus astronomuswasalive in 1440.38It seems that he did not give up his magical interest completely:Johannes of Dobra, a medical doctor, reports in one of his medical handbooks thatHenricus Bohemus talked to him about an Armenian who lived for four hundredyears thanks to a special medicine.39Being experienced in the field of crystallomancy, possessing books of magicalcontent, a good friend of King Wladislas, and living freely in the early 1440s, Henrythe Bohemian could easily have been commissioned to produce a special prayerbook on an omniscient crystal and on “clarifying” angels in order to satisfy the“magico-devotional” purposes of the king. Taking into consideration the fact thatthe extant text of the prayer book was written in the 1430s or 1440s, one couldeven reverse the question: who else, experienced enough in these fields, could have218P T: R  C35.

Even though the authorcannot be identified with complete certainty, at the moment Henry the Bohemianis the most plausible contender for this role. He was a most learned man in medi -eval magic: he possessed the texts of the Ars notoria and the Liber visionum andhad a close acquaintance with crystals.

Imprisonment and execution were real dangers threat-ening those interested in magical practices. One of the most paradigmatic instancesfor the condemnation and execution of an intellectual involved in learned magicin Western Europe was the famous case of Cecco d’Ascoli. Cecco d’Ascoli was auniversity master and an astrologer burned at the stake by the Inquisition in Flo-rence in 1327.40As his commentary to the otherwise strictly cosmographical andastronomical Sphera by Sacrobosco shows, he was seriously interested in variousfields of image magic and astral necromancy; his knowledge testifies to a deepacquaintance with books of magic.41Although it sounds logical that Cecco’s mag-ical interests were responsible for his execution, the real reasons of his prosecutionare still unknown. Executing a university professor, however much he had beeninterested in learned magic and judicial astrology, and even if he went as far as cast-ing Christ’s horoscope, was rather exceptional at the time. Political reasons andstruggles for courtly influence, or simply personal conflicts, may have also accountedfor his somber end. Cecco’s magical teachings might have been among the reasonsindeed, but they were certainly not the only ones. If magic or astrology alone hadbeen enough, not many astrologers would have avoided capital punishment in theMiddle Ages, and his example would not be so exceptional. ,e main moral of thecase of Cecco d’Ascoli for our present investigations is that the relationship be -tween the condemnation of someone and the magic that he practiced is far morecomplicated than a simple causal nexus.,e mechanism of criminalization, the relationship of the practice of magic andits prosecution, was no less complex in Central Europe.

A number of examplesseem to support this opinion. First of all, Henry the Bohemian was found guiltyof possessing necromantic books and looking for treasure with a boy medium, andhe was thus imprisoned. Second, Nicholas the Hangman had a whole arsenal ofmagical tools and books, and as a result he too had to stand trial. ,ird, ConradKyeser was interested in (and perhaps practiced) certain kinds of magic, and—probably because of this—he had to leave the Imperial court and go into exile.To this fairly consistent list, we can add one more university professor, Paulusde Praga or Paul the Jew. In the early modern times, Paul had the fame of a magi-cian, he was considered to have been in contact with the Devil, and his life wasassociated with the Faust legend.42What we actually know about him is that heobtained a doctor’s degree from the University of Padua in medicine, and beforehe came to lecture in Kraków in 1451, he had taught at several other universities,and had spent some time in Bohemia as a gynecologist. He was finally imprisonedin the bishop’s jail in Kraków, where (or slightly after which) he wrote his famouscompendium, an extensive encyclopedic handbook, the Liber viginti artium ( TheBook of the Twenty Arts). ,is book was even more notorious than its author; itwas often called the Book of Twardowski—after the diabolical figure of that namein Polish myth. It was, reportedly, either locked away in a separate chamber in Vil-nius chained to the wall, or—as other reports claim—hidden under a pavementstone so that nobody could read it. It was also believed to bear the trace of the Devil’stouch. Indeed, with minor philological research we can discover the black spots onfolio 151r in the surviving codex, which gave ample opportunity for speculations.43Taking all these cases into consideration, it does not seem too hasty to concludethat practicing magic had legal consequences. To confirm this argument, we canalso compare these cases to cases in Western Europe involving treasure hunting,crystallomancy, the invocation of demons, and the possession of magical books.A little-known English text on crystal scrying resembles documents from thecase of Henry the Bohemian so closely that it could have been copied from a Pol-ish original. ,e text is again a confession, this time made by William Byg, alias220P T: R  C42.

As his fame grew, he was soon standing before the vicar-general of the arch-bishop of York accused of heresy—just as Henry was accused by the vicar-generalof the archbishop of Kraków, Stanislas of Skalbimierz. In his confession made infront of the Commissary Poteman in 1467, William Byg admitted how he had per-formed his practices with the help of a sixteen-year-old boy, with a crystal stone,and through prayers to Christ and the angels.45As a result of all the preparations,the boy could see one or two angels thus invoked appearing in the crystal, andthese angels were willing to answer questions about the location of numerous pre-cious stolen properties belonging to various noblemen.46,e question to be askedof the conjured angel is spelled in English in the otherwise Latin confession: “Sayme trewe, chylde, what man, what woman, or what childe hase stolne yis thyng,and shewe me thing in his hand.” Like the confession of Henry the Bohemian,this text also ends with a statement that all these methods were learned from mag-ical handbooks, and that the angels appeared while reading these books.47Confessing all the experiments he had done, William finally avoided being exe-cuted and was merely forced to walk around with a torch in his right hand and a rodin his left with his books dangling from it. Inscriptions were also attached to his bodyannouncing that he was a sortilegus and an invocator spirituum.He was also requiredto secure his abjuration of magic by throwing his books into the flames. ,is embar-rassing but relatively moderate punishment was probably due to the fact that somenoblemen of the area were also involved in Byg’s practices. As in Henry’s case, themagician avoided his well-deserved death thanks to his aristocrat protectors.A fairly analogous picture of crystallomantic procedures involving a similar mag-ical apparatus emerges from the documentation of a somewhat earlier legal pro-ceeding against a real or alleged magician; this is the well-known and often citedM   C C22144.

Finally, like Henry and William, Jean speaks about hismagical books: “En mes livres sont plusieurs erreurs contre nostre foy, comme direque aucuns dyables soient bons et benign, aucuns tous puissans et tout saichant,aucuns n’en enfer, n’en paradis, et que bons angelz ont revelé teles sciences et que lessains prophetes et autres ont fait les miracles et dit leurs prophecies par telz arts.”52It is worth pausing for a moment with the eventful history of the books collectedby these two magician-owners: William Byg left his codices to the library of the lateHumphrey, duke of Gloucester (d. 1446), who was himself suspected of an interestin magic, and whose collection formed the main core of the Bod leian,53while it ishighly possible that Jean de Bar’s handbooks of ritual magic were confiscated by thelibrary of King Charles VI.54To put it shortly: noblemen, kings, and ultimatelyuniversity libraries inherited the written inventory of condemned magicians.Having arrived at this point in this comparative analysis, we are sorely tempted222P T: R  C48.

But let us not yield to this temptation so easily!As scholars dealing with these issues have pointed out, both Jean’s and Henry’scases are far more complicated than simple condemnations of simple magicians.As for Jean de Bar, in the same year when he confessed his errors, the Faculty of,eology of the University of Paris issued twenty-eight articles on condemned mag-ical arts,55which correspond structurally, thematically, and occasionally even wordfor word to the declared sins of Jean de Bar.56Among these condemned supersti-tious beliefs and activities, we find virtually all the elements confessed to by themagician: the conviction that demons may be good, benign, and omniscient; thatGod constrains demons through the art of magic; the use and consecration of rings,magic mirrors, books, and clothes; the charting of figures on given days and at givenhours; the use of the blood of the hoopoe; and the proclamation that the use ofmagic is good.Were these articles inspired by the trial? Was the confession inspired by the arti-cles? What was the role of Jean Gerson, the chancellor of the university, in the accu-sations, who inserted some years later the whole list of the condemned articles inhis De erroribus circa artem magicam ( The Errors Concerning the Art of Magic),57and whose codex contains the only extant copy of Jean de Bar’s confession?58Ger-son’s role is still under research, but it seems that Jean de Bar’s condemnation wasa result of a very complicated political situation.59While Henry the Bohemian andWilliam Byg survived the legal process thanks to their influential connections, Jeande Bar—perhaps because he was tooinfluential at the royal court—was executed.His case was not the only one prosecuted against magicians in Paris in those years,and apparently his confession was influenced by many other factors besides hisactual crystallomantic practices.Similar complications arise in the Central European cases. It would be mostreasonable to suggest that the practice of magic was the main reason for Kyeser’sdismissal from the court and Paul of Prague’s imprisonment.

Paul’s codex of the Liber viginti artium,whichhas come down to us, is no more than a general encyclopedia, incorporating amixture of medieval and new scientific knowledge, including grammar, medicine,and music. For those readers who are inspired by the wicked fate of the book, itscontents will be fairly disappointing; it does not involve any special magical mat-ter. Considering the strong conviction about Paul’s contact with black magic, it isfairly plausible that there were originally two books, the surviving one containingthe description of sciences in alphabetical order, and another one which provokedthe bad rumors. But it is even more plausible to suppose that there was no othercodex at all, and the stories about it were forged later. As the written sources men-tioning the magical fame of the codex and its author are not contemporary, but datefrom as late as the eighteenth century, Paul’s imprisonment might have had nothingto do with magic at all, and everything to do with political or personal conflicts.60We have even less grounds to examine the mechanism of criminalization in thecases of Conrad of Vechta and Albicus of Uniczow, since there is no record thatformal charges were ever brought against either of them. ,ese accusations—as wehave seen—remained on the level of slander and innuendo.,e accusation and rumor of magic as a means for getting rid of rivals in courtlyconflicts had considerable future in Central European courts. Erotic magic mayhave seemed especially useful for undermining the political influence of a femaleprotagonist.61Queen Beatrix of Hungary accused a woman called Borbála—whojust happened to be the lover of Beatrix’s husband, King Matthias, and the motherof the king’s natural son, John of Corvin—of bewitching her in order to make herbarren.62,e king managed to smooth down the quarrel, but somewhat later, inter-estingly, the rumors spread by the queen came back to haunt her. Her claim tohave been rendered incapable of bearing children gave the next king, Wladislas II,an excuse not to marry her. In the sixteenth-century history of the Polish kings, thereare three cases—all related to Augustine Sigismund (1520–72)—of royal lovers andqueens being accused of using love potions and poisons, abusing their womanlyand political influence on the king, and practicing love magic.63,anks to their224P T: R  C60.

All these developmentsconstitute important chapters in the history of the criminalization of magic, theyare not, however, very informative about the actual practice of magic in royal envi-ronments, since they follow rather the logic of courtly plots and intrigues.,e case of Henry the Bohemian provide more details and better insight intothe role magic played in the course of a condemnation, and yet the complicationsare still there. Did Henry really perform crystallomantic treasure hunts, or shouldwe rather suspect that the mention of necromantic books and the invocation ofdemons in the accusations served mere argumentative purposes? Were they not sim-ply means of stigmatizing him and some further suspicious figures and universitypersons of Kraków?A careful reading of the sources shows that we should not be that skeptical.Henry’s magical practices played only a secondary role in his condemnation; thejudges did not need the charge of necromancy to inflate the indictment: Hussitismwas quite enough.64Stanislas of Skalbimierz put more emphasis on Henry’s contactswith Hussite thought; magic is left in the background, and he explicitly specifiedthat Hussitism was the main reason behind the sentence. Of course, he discussedmagic as well, and going through a detailed argumentation, referring to the Bible,Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Albertus Magnus, Pope John XXII, and various fur-ther authorities, Stanislas concluded that invoking demons in order to find hiddentreasure is a heretical activity. It seems that the accusations had some real founda-tion, and Henry had indeed put his knowledge of crystallomancy and the invoca-tion of spirits into actual practice. To be sure, we cannot rule out categorically thatthe trial was a result of a conflict among the various political powers, in which anastrologer’s freedom was sacrificed on the altar of the fight for courtly influence;however, it is more probable that magic was not a major concern for the judges andthat we should view the case as a regular condemnation of someone involved in theteachings of the Hussite movement who was actually also a magician.,is is not to deny that the practice of magic was a crime in late medieval Kra -ków just as it was elsewhere. Even though it played a secondary role in Henry’s case,we have seen, for example, that in the case of Nicholas the Hangman, who was notin such a good position, magic was treated as a criminal activity, and that the merepossession of magical handbooks, crystals, and mirrors was enough to indict him.Still, while magic was criminalized both in Central and Western Europe, there seemto have been differences in the extent of its condemnations.In Paris, magical handbooks accessible for the students interested in the fieldwere already a major worry for William of Auvergne.

In the following three decades, the chancellor of the univer -sity, Jean Gerson, dedicated a series of treatises to the problem of magic, divination,medical astrology, judicial astrology, medical amulets, lullism, and similar topics.Around the year 1400, magic caused no little disquiet in theological circles.67OnGerman soil, Johannes of Francofordia, Nicolaus Jawor, and Henricus of Gorkumall dedicated theoretical works to the question of popular superstitions, the issueof demons, and that of magical practices.68While all these decisions and treatiseswere being produced, the royal court of France saw a number of executions of allegedand real magicians, one of whom was Jean de Bar.69Generally speaking, in comparison with the Western developments, less empha-sis seems to have been laid on the criminal nature of magic in Central Europe, andcondemning learned magic had a more modest tradition in this region. In the his-tory of the universities of Central Europe, no list of condemned magical practicesand books was issued: in the absence of sources, we cannot tell whether the mag-ical books provoked a similar concern or not.In various records there is some mention of persons practicing magic, divinationor alchemy, and that some of these concern instances in which the person wasaccused or condemned for doing so.

In Prague, issues related to this field—such as foretelling the future,practicing “piromancia, hydromancia, geomancia, nigromancia, spatulamancia,”or the use of amulets, herbs, and stones against demons—could serve occasionallyas themes for university quodlibets,75however, there seems to have been no needto condemn such practices in statutes. Meanwhile, a growing intellectual interestin the magical arts is detectable in various informal groups related to the courts anduniversities, but while works on natural, image, and demonic magic, as well as div-ination and alchemy, could be found on the shelves of the Central European bookcollectors, such interest did not provoke the great anxiety it did in Paris.Besides legal prosecution against magicians, their subsequent confession, anduniversity statutes, there are of course further sources on the prohibition of magic:penitentials, preachers’ postilles, tracts of theologians, and inquisitorial sources.76Penitentials are less useful for the present inquiry: on the one hand, they are lessexplicit on the actual practices of courtly and university intellectuals than on theconvictions and fears of canon lawyers, and on the other, their Central Europeancopies show little specificity and no originality: they mainly repeat the beliefs, prac-tices, and folk customs listed in their Western sources, and are subsequently ratheruninformative for us.77Examples of this genre in medieval Kraków and Prague,confession handbooks, and lists of questions to be put at the visitation of the bishop,show the same general patterns as the Western penitentials, including the use ofamulets, baptizing of images, invocation of demons, divinations, incantations, heal-ing practices, and so on.78228P T: R  Cprognostications became widely accepted, and professors of theology, such as Johannes of Glogovia,viewed astrology as a useful art.

Althoughbibliophilism became a central characteristic of courtly culture only in the four-teenth century, it had its roots in some thirteenth-century royal collections. ,ecourts of Emperor Frederick II in Sicily and of Alfonso X (the Wise) (1252–84)in Castile were famous for the respect books enjoyed, and this respect was inspirednot least by the Arabic model. Both courts were places of important translatingactivity, which gave open access to the Arabic learning entering Europe, and—accordingly—both were responsible for the import of learned magic (the Picatrix,for example, was translated at Alfonso’s court). ,e library of another thirteenth-century collector, King Louis IX (Saint Louis) of France, developed into the largestroyal collection by the fourteenth century. Under Charles V (the Wise) (d. 1380),this library contained more than nine hundred volumes, it was as rich as the collec-tion of the Sorbonne, and—as we would expect from a proper institutional library—it had its own permanent librarian.82Approximately one-third of this large col-lection was on science and medicine, and more than one-tenth of the books indi-cates the king’s interest in astrology, divination, and magic.

We have already seen, for example, that an illuminated copy of thePseudo-Aristotelian Secretum secretorum was among the books prepared for theHungarian king Louis I of Anjou (1342–82), but we also saw that it would be toohazardous to suppose that this is a proper evidence indicating certain magical inter-ests: the Secretum was such a widespread book that it was present in virtually allthe larger libraries, and it was so rich in various other kinds of material—not tomention that it was viewed as a king’s mirror—that its mere presence says very lit-tle about the curiosity of the collector, especially if he is a king.84One of the oldest courtly libraries, which may be—even though only partially—reconstructed, is that of the last Přemyslids, the Bohemian royal house that died outin the early fourteenth century. According to the supposition of Karel Fischer, amongthose items that Nicolaus Cusanus purchased in 1444 in Nuremberg, a numberof astronomical tools—an astrolabe, an armillary sphere, and a torquetum—andsixteen astronomical and astrological manuscripts originated from the Bohemianroyal court of Ottokar II (1253–78) and his son, Wenceslas II (1278–1305). ,eseitems—the hypothesis goes—entered the possession of the newly founded Uni -versity of Prague (1348) but were physically left in the royal castle in the possessionof court astrologers. It was Emperor and king of Bohemia Sigismund who broughtthem with him to Germany in 1420, where Cusanus had the opportunity to buythem.85As a result of thorough and detailed codicological research, Alois Krchňák provedthat only five manuscripts, the Codices Cusani (and indeed the astronomical in -struments), were demonstrably from the collection of the Bohemian kings.86,esebooks, prepared in a Prague scriptorium, contain a wide range of readings in theArabic and Greek celestial sciences, written by (or ascribed to) Alfraganus, Al-Kindi,Ptolemy, Hippocrates, Hali, Messahallah, Albumasar, Alkabicius, and so forth,mostly translated in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.87From these sources,M   C C23184.

Moreover, this connection was an intellectual cooper-ation as well; the manuscripts testify that several Spanish astrologers were active atthe court of Wenceslas II around 1300.88It would be reasonable to expect that interest in the celestial sciences at the Bohe -mian court emerged—similarly to the Arabic history of science and to the prefer-ence of the Spanish translators—in close connection with divination and imagemagic. Since there is also a human aspect in the relationship between the two courtsinvolved (the Spanish astrologers), this joint interest could have been transmittedeasily from Toledo to Prague. Disappointingly, however—apart from the fact thata magico-therapeutic lapidary dedicated to King Wenceslas II claimed to have beena translation from Greek89—the very little knowledge we have on the library ofthe Přemyslids does not satisfy these expectations. For such a satisfaction we have towait another hundred years, for the library of Wenceslas IV, Holy Roman Emperorand king of Bohemia.,e reconstruction of the library of Wenceslas IV is only slightly more developedthan that of the Přzemislid book collections: only eight extant manuscripts can beidentified with complete certainty as once belonging to the emperor.90Just like theearlier kings of Bohemia, Wenceslas showed a considerable interest in astrology.91232P T: R  Cthe figures, see Krchňák, “Die Herkunft der astronomischen Handschriften,” 121–23.

It is important to underline first of all that Matthias playeda rather particular role in the succession of Hungarian rulers. He was the only kingof the country who was not born of royal blood, but belonged to the lesser nobil-ity. His father, Johannes Hunyadi (ca. 1407–56), was a real “newcomer,” a talentedpolitician and general, a legendary hero in the eyes of the Christians, who defeatedthe Turks many times in various spectacular battles, and who—as a result of hisvictories—became a powerful baron, and the regent of Hungary (1446–53) whilethe previous king was young. Johannes’s prestige was a primary reason why hisyounger son, Matthias, was proclaimed king in 1458, at the age of eighteen. Mat -thias became a real Renaissance king, leading a particularly active foreign policy,attacking virtually all the countries surrounding Hungary. Wishing to become em -peror, he even occupied Vienna for a few years. Despite the continuous warfare,his reign is remembered as one of the most glorious periods of Hungarian history.Matthias himself received a humanist education, and one of his chief goals wasto establish his court as a center of humanism comparable to those of Cosimo(1389–1464) and Lorenzo (1449–92) de Medici, where the greatest Italian human-ists participated in huge banquets during which they listened to music and engagedin philosophical discussions. Hungary was probably never so “up-to-date” as far ascultural life is concerned; the intellectual relations between the country and therest of Europe were never so close as in those days. Matthias’s Renaissance courtbecame the first humanist center outside Italy, and thus an integral part of the cul-ture of Western Europe. ,e Italian humanists were present in Hungary not onlythrough their books: they were in correspondence with the Hungarian elite, andsome of them—if Ficino himself could not be convinced, Galeotto Marzio andFrancesco Bandini and other members of the humanist generation—even visitedthe king’s court in person.,e appreciation of astrology in this Neoplatonic milieu is well known andthoroughly researched.100Although the patronage of cultural life was centralized in234P T: R  C100.

Vitéz also arrangedan astronomical center and observatory in Várad, which was later transferred toEsztergom. From his archiepiscopal court, there is also pictorial evidence for hisfascination with the celestial sciences: a fresco on a surviving archway was decoratedwith the signs of the zodiac.103Pozsony (Pressburg, Istropolis, today’s Bratislava) and the newly founded univer -sity, the so-called Academia Istropolitana,104was another crucial intellectual centerfor a short period (1467–72).

Whatever the university was called, itwas a real institution with faculties, scholarships, and a building.105. ,e secondary literature of this Hungarian attempt to found a university is very extensive;it suffices here to mention Xystus Schier, Memoria Academiae Istropolitanae seu Posoniensis(Vienna: 08 Chapter 8:Sample.qxd 9/24/2008 11:51 AM Page 235"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"to cast a horoscope for the university, predicted a flourishing future for the newinstitution.106Unfortunately, this prophecy turned out to be wrong, and the Aca -demia Istropolitana could not avoid the fate of the earlier Hungarian attempts toestablish universities in Pécs and in Óbuda: after a very short golden period it beganto break up. ,e dissolution of the university is a sad story; conflict arose betweenthe humanist king and his humanist prelates—Archbishop Vitéz and Bishop JanusPannonius—who organized a plot against their ruler. ,ey were deposed and forcedto flee, and died soon after. ,eir deaths discouraged the rest of the professors, thestudents left Pozsony, and the university began a long and painful decline. Simul-taneously, the somewhat disappointed king removed the Hungarian humanists fromhis court and surrounded himself with humanists from abroad, mainly Italians,among them his second wife, Beatrix of Aragon. Matthias was also aware that a realRenaissance king was expected not only to support scientists and artists but alsoto found a library as a source of mental nourishment and a site of learned debate.If we consider a library as the mirror of its collector’s literary and scientific in -terests, we have every right to expect that a significant portion of Matthias’s bookswould be on astrology and a lesser but still significant part of them on learnedmagic. King Matthias’s enthusiastic interest in the sciences, including astrology andthe occult arts, and the scientific orientation of his Corvinian library was widelyadmired by his contemporaries and has been widely studied by scholars.107Reportsleft by the actors of Matthias’s court contain a variety of exciting hints regardingthe intellectual attitudes of the king. ,e famous Italian humanist Galeotto Marzio,who spent long years in Hungary as a guest of the court, gave an enthusiasticaccount of Matthias’s Neoplatonic, scientific, and astrological interests.108AnotherItalian humanist and guest of the court, Antonio Bonfini (1427–1502), specifiesin his Symposium that the intellectual debates held in the court were often organizedaround the topic of Neoplatonism and focused on such authors as Plato, HermesTrismegistos, Zoroaster, Plotinus, and Pythagoras.109236P T: R  CKurzbök, 1774); Leslie S.

First, the typical Western universities (butnot the Spanish ones, or the University of Naples) emerged gradually from previouseducational structures: their birth was a result of spontaneous development in thecourse of which masters and students tried to secure their privileges and obtain legalprotection. In contrast, their fellow institutions in Central Europe were foundedfrom above, as fruits of the will and the conscious educational program of a givenruler, who wanted to satisfy his administrative needs, or to create an intellectualelite educated inside the country, or to enhance his personal prestige.Second, and as a sad consequence of the previous point, the continued existenceof these newly founded institutions depended too much on the quickly changingintentions of their protectors and on unpredictable economic and political cir-cumstances: they usually fell into a state of decline (or even ceased to exist) aftera few decades, unless they were refounded and reorganized by another royal bene-factor. Hungary, for example, seems to enjoy a rather privileged position on anymap representing university foundations. With its three universities (Pécs, Óbuda,and Pozsony—today’s Bratislava),8to which we can add a second foundation atÓbuda (1410) and a last attempt in the 1470s (by King Matthias in Buda), Hun-gary outshone all the other countries of the region. What this imaginary map can-not express is that as the result of an unfortunate combination of many factors—lack of persistence, unreliable financial backing, and so on—none of these attemptsat establishing a studium generalein Hungary attained any sort of permanence: threeuniversities disappeared after a short period of existence from the history of learn-ing and the fourth never even opened.ee third peculiarity of Central European universities is their relatively nationalcharacter. While in Oxford and Paris, both the ius ubique docendi and the systemof the academic nations around which education was organized expressed theinternational and privileged position of the masters and also the independence ofthe institution from the given monarchy, Central European universities dependedmore on dynastic and national factors, bore generally a greater amount of national M   U C2438.

Central European universities did notjust appear; on the contrary, they were planned consciously by the greatest nationalmonarchs of the area: Emperor Charles IV was the founder of Charles Universityin Prague;10Casimir the Great, king of Poland, established the University of Kra -ków,11which was later reorganized by Wladislas Jagiello (and in 1817 renamedJagiello University); and the names of the Hungarian university founders—Louisthe Great, Sigismund of Luxembourg, and King Matthias Corvinus—are no lessprominent in the history of the region.Not just kings but queens as well took an active role in the foundations. Jadwiga(Hedvig), queen of Poland, was an important benefactress of the reorganized Uni-versity of Kraków, while her sister, Maria, queen of Hungary, became enthusiasti-cally involved in the 1395 project of establishing a university in her own city, Óbuda,even though both of them died before their respective universities actually opened.Was this queenly enthusiasm a compensation for their bad conscience, felt becauseof the negligence of their father, Louis of Anjou, who had let both of his univer-sities fall into decline? At any rate, Jadwiga left generous endowments to the Uni-versity of Kraków; she even bequeathed to the university her personal jewels, thefamous Angevin collection—one of the largest in Europe at that time. As a conse -quence, Kraków became the best-funded university in Central Europe. ee partic-ipation of queens was important for one more reason: the new universities, whichappeared late and were organized artificially from above, had no organic place in244P T: R  C9.

However, when (respectively) Louis of Anjou, Sigismund, and KingMatthias no longer had enough energy, power, or motivation to support their newlyfounded institutions, they perished quickly. ee reasons for the royal negligencecould be various: (1) the given university was in a remote city of southern Hun-gary (Pécs) and the king (Louis of Anjou) concentrated rather on his wars; (2) thesovereign’s attention turned toward dynastic and political conflicts (Sigismund); (3)the king broke with his almost omnipotent archbishop, whose educational proj -ect was no longer appreciated, and the disgrace extended to the university as well(as was the case with Matthias, Vitéz, and the University of Pozsony); or (4) mostprosaically, the king simply died (Casimir the Great in 1370) and the successorsdid not pay much attention to the development of his cultural program.Regardless of the energetic beginnings of the universities of Prague, Vienna, andKraków, in spite of the fact that the organizers of the Academia Istropolitana invitedall the notable scientists of the region, no matter that the studium generale of Óbudacould be represented in a considerable delegation of professors in the Council ofConstance (1414–18)—in the absence of consistent support, the students migratedtoward other centers, and the universities of Central Europe fell into obscurity (asthe Hungarian institutions) or suffered a period of stagnation until they got a newstimulus (as Vienna in 1384, and Kraków around 1400).A last peculiarity common to Central European universities that we address hereat some length is a surprising blossoming and even dominance of the natural sci-ences in the intellectual production of the universities:13among them physics, med-icine, but first of all astronomy and astrology.

In 1365,the Parisian Master Albert of Saxony became the first rector of the university, andafter a twenty-year period of half-existence, it was reorganized by the German Hein -rich von Langenstein (Henry of Hesse 1325–97), another master who studied inParis.14Interest in astrology was prevalent from this second foundation onward.Although Langenstein himself denied the validity of judicial astrology, the influ-ence of the Habsburg family as founder and patron of the university encouragedthe study of astrology considerably. A number of professors became involved in thecelestial sciences and astrological medicine during Langenstein’s career. ee Habs -burg courts—the imperial court of Frederick III (1440–93) and the royal court ofWladislas Posthumous (1452–57), king of Hungary and Bohemia—created a de -mand for skilled astrologers, and the astrologers trained at the University of Viennawere available to satisfy that demand.15Among the astronomers/astrologers appearing at the university and in the Habs -burg courts, one can name Johannes Gmunden16and Johannes Nihili of Bohe -mia,17as well as the two leading scientists of the time: Georgius Peuerbach andJohannes Regiomontanus.18While becoming the protagonists of a new chapter inthe history of astronomy,19they also became involved in astrological affairs, Peuer-bach becoming the court astrologer of Wladislas Posthumous, and Regiomontanuscasting the horoscope of Maximilian, the son of Frederick III and Empress Eleanorof Portugal. In the next generation, the prophet-astrologer Johannes Lichtenbergershould be mentioned, whose predictions were highly esteemed in the Habsburgcourts.20Pozsony—being halfway between Vienna and Kraków—served as a convenientmeeting point for German and Polish astronomers.21During the short existence246P T: R  C14.

An indication of the high esteem astrology enjoyed in the new institu -tion is the fact that astrologers were officially commissioned to cast the university’sown horoscope.Finally, as far as the University of Kraków is concerned, its reorganization in1400 was the start of a golden age that lasted for more than a century.23From thepresent point of view, the history of two special private chairs is to be underlined.ee first was founded in the first decade of the fifteenth century through the gen-erosity of Johannes Stobner, a citizen of Kraków (1360–1405),24and was desig-nated particularly for the study of geometry, arithmetic, the theory of music, optics,and astronomy. ee collegae Stobneriani,however ,were mainly concerned withmathematical and astronomical studies.One of them, Martin Król of Żurawica (1422–53),25moved first to Praguewhile still a young magister,then traveled to Vienna, Leipzig, and Padua, to finallyreach Bologna, where he studied medicine and taught astronomy. It was probablyin Italy that he became deeply involved in astrological studies. Later he appearedin Hungary as a physician at the court of János Hunyadi (the father of King Mat -thias), and finally returned to Prague to take over the chair of Stobner. Some yearslater, just before his death, he founded another chair especially for astrological stud-ies. eis chair started functioning in the late 1450s.26In this new department ofthe university, the lectures were based on such astrological and astronomical worksM   U C24722.

Virtually all of the medieval man-uscripts kept today in the Biblioteka Jagiellońska originally belonged to fifteenth-century university professors.41Meanwhile, although the collection of the National(earlier University) Library of Prague underwent a serious expansion thanks to dona-tions, purchases, and the incorporation of monastic libraries, a considerable portionof the codices kept today in the Klementinum goes back to the collections of theprofessors of Charles University.42eis means that most of the Kraków and Praguecodices discussed in the second part of this study were originally copied, collected,and owned by university masters.We have already seen in the case of Henry the Bohemian how university peo-ple were involved in magical practices, treasure hunting, the invocation of demons,and crystallomancy: Monaldus of Luca, Nicolaus Hinczonis, and perhaps evenHenry himself graduated in a studium generale, and—as the sources testify—theypossessed necromantic books.

What these two cases can teach us is that universitymasters played a central role in the dissemination of texts of learned magic. eemain objective of the present section is to take a second look at those magicalmanuscripts already discussed which once were part of the collection of a studentor a professor.In our surveys of natural magic, but first of all in that of image magic, we exam-ined a number of codices that were copied or owned by Kraków magistri.Amongthem, the Dresden manuscript deserves special attention because of the numberof magical texts it contains. As it can be recalled, in an extensive collection ofastrological works written by the Kraków professors there were included some geo -mantic texts, a copy of the rare Liber runarum,the Hermetic Liber de stellis beibeniis,a bibliographical list of magical books, and other astrological and divinatory liter-ature.43ee errors and idiosyncrasies44in the Liber runarumattest that the bookwas copied from the same model as another copy of the same text copied by Johan -nes Virdung of Hassfurt in Kraków in 1488.45We know, furthermore, that theDresden manuscript was copied at the same time by a certain Egidius of Corin-tia, student of Kraków, but unfortunately nothing is known about this person: hisname does not appear in the lists of Kraków students.46No less frustrating is the lack of evidence concerning another book of imagemagic ,BJ 793. eis codex , which contains an early copy of the Picatrixand anoutstanding set of images of the planetary and decanic figures, as well as the twobasic texts of image magic accepted by the Speculum astronomiae,that is, the Opusimaginum of Pseudo-Ptolemy and eebit’s De imaginibus,along with a represen-tative selection of geomantic books of fate, is one of the most interesting hand-books of magic in Kraków. It has survived without its first page, and while it is obvious that it was owned and copied by a Kraków master, we cannot say forsure who this master was. Even the supposition about possible Italian sources isconjectural, since the codex or codices that served as the archetype(s) of this man-uscript do not seem to have survived.

Some of the texts contained in BJ793 are identical with various parts of some other codices of the Jagiellonian Library,such as BJ 566, 805, and 813. All three belong to the library of a Kraków professor,Andrzej Grzymala, and attest to a similar interest in magic, medicine, and astrology.BJ 813 is a handbook on medical and astrological texts composed of two parts.50ee first is a curriculum handbook containing standard texts on medicine by Hip-pocrates, Galen, and Philaretus, and probably served the needs of a medical student.The second contains some classic texts on natural magic and astrological divination,the Secretum secretorum attributed to Aristotle, Introductio in iudicia astrologiae(Introduction to Astrological Judgments) by Arnald of Villanova, and Messahala’sDe occultis (On Occult eings),51and De occultatione annuli attributed to the first-century astrologer, Dorotheus Sidoneus. As for the two other codices, BJ 805 con-tains among other pieces the Centiloquium of Hermes, a treatise on geomancy,52and the Experimenta (or Liber aggregationis) attributed to Albertus Magnus,53whileBJ 566 is a simple reader in medical astrology.54Among these books ,BJ 813 and 805 belong to the earliest collections of uni-versity professors; they were collected around 1364 and owned first by the profes-sor Herman z Przeworska.

Alsoamong those ancient and precious books that he obtained from Grzymala, we findBJ 839, which contains the Liber geomantiae(Book of Geomancy) of Hugo of San-talla, and another Experimenta Alberti.It is worth mentioning that Oswiecim pre-pared a table of contents for both BJ 805 and 813, and in these lists he omitted thegeomantic text, the De occultis by Messahala, the De occultatione annuli attributedto Dorotheus Sidoneus, and the De aqua ardente.eerefore, it seems likely that themagical contents of these medical codices reflects Grzymala’s interests rather thanOswiecim’s.56Andrzej Grzymala of Posnania (ca. 1425–66)57graduated from the Universityof Kraków, and just like Gaszowiec, he spent some years in Italy (1460–61), partlyin Rome and perhaps also in Perugia. In 1453 and 1458 he was the dean of theFaculty of Arts, in 1464 dean of the Medical Faculty, and finally in the winter termof 1465/66 the rector of the university. Taking into consideration the fact that PetrusGaszowiec was the dean of the Medical Faculty in 1459 and 1462, and the rectorof the university in 1464 and in the summer term of 1465, it is plausible to sup-pose that they knew each other quite well.58Grzymala was an important donor tothe university library; two dozen manuscripts of the Biblioteka Jagiellońska havesurvived from his collection, including the three codices just discussed.59ee extantcopies indicate that Grzymala consciously and persistently built up his professoriallibrary mainly by purchasing medical manuscripts, some of them rather expensive.60One more person can be related to the group of Grzymala, Gaszowiec, andOswiecim: Mikołaj Wodka of Kwidzyn or Nicolaus Marienwerder61(ca. 1442–94),M   U C25355.

Taking an overall look at these sources, noth-ing supports the idea that the inclusion of such texts, as the Experimenta Alberti,the Secretum secretorum,and the texts on geomancy and palmistry, are due to a par-ticular interest in magic, and I would suggest that they rather constituted an inte-gral part of the general medical theme in the library of professors.67In contrast, the two previous manuscripts, the Dresden SLB N. 100 and BJ 793,even though oriented generally toward astrology, show a consistent interest inimage magic and divination.

His Pal. lat. 1439—as we have already seen—containsone of the few extant copies of the Liber runarum,a text on manipulating plane-tary spirits for all kinds of benign and malign aims with the help of talismans, inwhich the spirits’ names are to be engraved on metal plates in a runic alphabet.Unique to this copy of the Liber runarum is a sophisticated circular diagram show-ing the correspondences between the letters of runic and Latin alphabets (fol. 199r;see Plate 17). Since this rota runarum does not strictly belong to the main text ofthe Liber runarum,it is possible that Virdung himself composed it in order to facil-itate the understanding of the complicated relations of runes and spirits detailedin the text.Virdung was apparently also interested in practical Hermetic texts. His copy ofthe Liber runarumin Pal. lat. 1439 follows the Liber de stellis beibeniis,an astro-logical work on the fixed stars attributed to Hermes, while another of his Vaticanmanuscripts, Pal. lat. 1375, contains two magical Hermetic texts copied with hisown hands in Kraków: De imaginibus sive annulis septem planetarum of Hermes,and De imaginibus septem planetarum of Belenus (Plate 18).72eese classical worksof talismanic magic are preceded in the manuscript by an otherwise unknowntract on imprisoning spirits of the planets in rings with the help of animal sacri-fice, pieces of metal, exorcisms, characters, and engravings on gems.73ee fourthitem of this series on magical images is a so far unidentified text attributed to“Master eomas,” which contains similar elements to the previous ones, togetherwith explicit conjurations addressed to the spirits. Against the background of thisexplicit interest in talismans, it is not surprising that Virdung acquired a codex in1500 containing a copy of the relatively widespread De imaginibus of eebit.74Finally, Virdung’s manuscripts also contain a range of divinatory material: thesummaof the basic rules of chiromancy collected by him from various texts of palm-istry (Plate 20),75the Sphera Pythagorae,which is also called the sphere of life anddeath (Plate 21),76geomantic figures,77and, on numerous folios of his manuscripts,256P T: R  C71. eorndike, “Giovanni Bianchini in Italian Manuscripts.”72.

Later he became the mathematicus, that is, the court astrologer, ofthe elector palatine,83he produced yearly prognostications, and taught mathemat-ics ,astronomy , and medicine at the University of Heidelberg.84After his death, hismanuscripts passed into the library of the elector palatine, and in 1622, in the mil-itary whirl of the eirty Years’ War, the whole manuscript collection of Heidel berg,including the codices of Virdung, was taken to the Vatican, where it forms todaythe Palatinus latinus collection.85Did such a career in the field of astrology predestine Virdung to be fascinatedby the magical sciences?

Besideshis countless prognostications, Virdung also published a few books on astrologi-cal medicine, but these works do not contain the slightest sign of their author’sinterest in talismans and planetary spirits.88However, turning back to the manu-scripts and consulting other sources, one can see that Virdung’s interest in imagemagic texts was consistent and long term. ee Pal. lat. 1375, for example, was writ-ten by Virdung in Kraków, but contains later additions from Heidelberg.

We learn from a letter ofJohannes Werner, astronomer and mathematician from Nuremberg (1466–1522),addressed to the humanist Konrad Celtis (1459–1508) in 1503, that Virdung,after having borrowed a precious astronomical book from Werner, disappeared to -gether with the book, and went to England to learn magic.92eere is evidence forVirdung returning from England and resuming his activities in Heidelberg: noth-ing is known, however, about his magical studies in the British Isles, nor do weknow whether he finally returned the book.Konrad Celtis and Johannes Virdung were two members of a circle of human-ists grouped around the court of Heidelberg. Both of them were alumni of theUniversity of Kraków, and both were interested in magic and Hermetism. Celtisspent three years as a student in Kraków (1489–91), where he participated in themeetings of leading humanists grouped around Filippo Buonaccorsi, aliasCalli-machus Experiens.93When he moved to Heidelberg, he founded another circle oflearned humanists, which included intellectuals such as Johannes Reuchlin (1455–1522), the famous Hebrew scholar, and Johannes Trithemius (1462–1516), abbotof Sponheim. ee Heidelberg humanists were under the influence of the Neopla-tonic and Hermetic writings of Ficino and Pico della Mirandola; interest in Her-metism, cabbalist philosophy—especially in its christianization à la Reuchlin—,natural magic, and numerology played a fairly important role in their intellectuallives.94In Heidelberg, Virdung found a most convenient place to consummate hisacademic interest.eat Trithemius and Virdung were friends is further attested to by their corre-spondence, which included occult issues. eis intellectual contact can answer a ques-tion about the dissemination of the Liber runarum (raised in Chapter 3).

Faus-tus—writes Trithemius—dared to call himself the foremost of the necromancers,and he even composed a calling card in order to send it to the important person-alities of his time.97Trithemius further suggests that Faustus is not only an unstablecharacter and a vagabond, but is also sexually perverted, being an active admirerof young boys.98eese harsh words have enjoyed great scholarly attention in mod-ern times, because Trithemius’s letter contains the first mention of the historicalperson called Georgius Faustus, whose notorious life and constantly growing leg-end furnished material for so many literary texts. Trithemius is the first of Faustus’scontemporaries to provide bibliographical data on the basis of which Faustus’s life,his early career as a student at the University of Heidelberg, and his later activityas a magician can be reconstructed.99From the letter it appears that Virdung had received Faustus’s card, and was keenlyinterested in meeting the magus who called himself the prince of necromancers,but before they met, he had cautiously inquired of the abbot whether he knewanything about this person.

In these lines, Virdungappears as a “mathematician of the Count Palatine, who is living today at Budoriswith his prince Ludwig.”100( That Virdung was in Lyon is also attested to by a letterwritten by the kapellmeister of the court of Elector Ludwig, in which he informshis lord that Virdung brought some music from Lyon, where the French royal courtwas residing.)101Reading Trithemius, we can see that the foolishness and haugh-tiness of Mercurius was no smaller than that of Faustus.102He arrogantly wishedto be called Mercury, his wife, his children, his servants, and himself were clothedin linen, and they all wore iron chains around their necks.103Although illiterateand uneducated, he claimed not only to possess all the science, mystery, and arcanaof the ancient sages, but also to surpass them. All this happened—he stated—notwith demonic help, but through the art of natural magic.104He was amicablyaccepted in the French court, and when the doctors of the king examined him,they found that he was indeed proficient in all fields of human knowledge eventhough he was without an adequate knowledge of Latin.105ee parallel of the descriptions of these two magicians, the explicit wish to dis-credit them, and the hatred Trithemius expresses are manifest, and seem to be sur-prising at first glance. Trithemius, when collecting nearly two thousand volumesfor his abbey at Sponheim, included numerous magical items in this impressivelibrary. In addition, as his literary production attests, the abbot himself was deeplyinvolved in the field of Hermetism and learned magic, and thus his criticism ofmagicians should not be seen as the disapproval of a furious outsider, but as thewrath of a rival.

Faustus furthermore called himself the princepsnecromanticorum and the fons necromantiae.Both Faustus and Mercurius manip-ulated their public: by sending around calling cards and generating rumors, theyconstructed their fame, which outshone their actual personalities. In an age whenthe media were not yet invented, a calling card listing all the titles by which onewanted to be remembered was a useful way of propagating one’s fame and to be -come the main subject of gossip. Provoking the public, both persons risked acquir-ing enemies: when Faustus sent his card to Virdung and Trithemius, and whenMercurius marched gloriously into Lyon, they were certainly aware that their recep-tion would not be unanimously positive. However, attaining fame is a greaterachievement than becoming popular.Fame and legend became superior to historical reality. ee image of Faust wasformed by Luther, Melanchton, and posterity in general: new details were addedto the life and especially the death of this magician, new opinions emerged abouthis relations with the Devil. Even his name changed through the decades of thesixteenth century: from Georgius Faustus to Johann Faust. By the time of Goethe,hardly anybody remembered that a real historical figure stood behind all thesebeliefs.But the shift in favor of the legend can be demonstrated even more expressivelyin the case of Mercurius: according to certain modern theories, his legend was somuch more essential than his reality that we can even suppose that the magiciandid not exist altogether. An argument was put forth in 1938 that Johannes Mer-curius was a fictive character, his fame being simply constructed by a contempo-rary, Lodovico Lazzarelli (ca. 1450–1500).109Lazzarelli wrote three prefaces in whichhe claimed that Mercurius had been his master.110Lazzarelli either invented the fig -ure of this genius magician or magnified an otherwise insignificant person, spread-ing rumors about him, in order to cover his own authorship of some Hermetictexts by attributing them to this Mercurius.

Johannes Virdung of Hassfurt was present at the birth of this new typeof self-appointed magician.111He himself, however, remained a passive witness tothis process: magic was always one of his main interests, but it was never his pri-mary interest. He was a typical member of the Central European circle of medicaldoctors, university members, and courtly astrologers concerned with magic, onewho copied, read, and collected the magical and Hermetic techniques and who per-sonally met the exponents of these fields. We are quite fortunate to have all thesetraces that Virdung left us about his occult interests.

First, I intended to provide a catalog andan analysis of the texts of learned magic that have survived in Central Europe, andsecond, I wished to characterize the circle of those persons who can be related tothese magical texts. #ese two objectives can be divided into two sets of questions.To provide a catalog and an analysis of the texts of learned magic that have sur-vived in Central Europe, it was necessary to ask:1. What texts of magical content (belonging to the fields of natural, image, andritual magic, as well as to those of alchemy and divination) can be found and iden-tified in the manuscript collections of Central Europe?2. What texts that have not survived, but which surely existed, since we haveevidence of their fifteenth-century existence from the extant source material, canbe identified?3. And to what extent does this group of magical texts represent an “original”intellectual production of this region? In other words, were these texts written in thisregion by local authors, or were they simply imported from the West by local scribes?To characterize the circle of those persons who can be related to these magicaltexts, it was necessary to ask:4. Who are those persons who were in one way or another responsible for theemergence of the magical sources, that is, who were their authors, scribes, owners,readers, and users? How can we describe the circle of these persons? Were theymagicians, outsiders, marginal figures living on the periphery of society, or ordi-nary monks, average courtiers, and everyday university people?5. What was the place of learned magic in their interest: primary or accidental?Why were these sources copied or written: to put them into practice or just forcontemplation?

Remaining still with the issue of the collectors’ fascination for magic, onecan ask a question that might be considered both anachronistic and naive, and yeteveryone dealing with medieval texts of magic will sooner or later ponder on it.Why didn’t these collectors see that it was impossible to learn the seven liberal artsthrough the prayers of the Ars notoria,that it was impossible to expel scorpionsfrom Bath or destroy cities with the help of #ebit’s De imaginibus,and that themagnet does not say anything about the chastity of their wives? Or should we rathersuppose that the methods did actually work in their time?7. And finally, did the scribes, collectors, and authors of magic texts form a co -herent group of practitioners, or a company of interested friends? Did they copythe texts from each other’s codices, did they discuss the content, did they put thiscontent into practice together, or were they isolated intellectuals with no visibleconnections?Let us see systematically what the answers to these questions are, as offered bymy research.1. I believe that my study has convincingly shown that Central European man-uscript collections offer fewer, but an equally rich variety of, magical texts as West-ern European libraries. Polish, Bohemian, and Hungarian scribes and collectorsincluded natural and image magic, alchemy and divination, as well as various typesof ritual magic in their codices not just by mere chance. #is is the region whichpreserved, inter alia,the first long version of the famous handbook of magic, thePicatrix, which is also the only illustrated copy we have, and two of the four extantcopies of the Liber runarum,a short tract combining Hermetic talismans with Scan-dinavian runes. In addition, this part of Europe gave birth to the following: aunique version of ritual magic, the prayer book of King Wladislas, which incor-porates crystallomancy, and long paragraphs of the Liber visionumof John ofMorigny; the Bellifortis of Conrad Kyeser, a source of technology and military engi-neering that is rich in magical elements; the Antipocras of Nicholas of Poland, a the-oretical work on the borderline of medicine and natural magic, which recommendsits reader to consume snake flesh for medicinal purposes; and Nicolaus Mel chior’sProcessus, which combines the text of the Christian Mass with the alchemical pro -cess. #ese four texts of “local authorship” inspired wide interest among Westernscholars, too.#e only category of texts missing from these manuscripts was necromancy perse, the genre which contains long invocations to benign and malign spiritual agents,offers explicitly demonic procedures, and operates with an inventory of magic cir-cles, animal sacrifices, suffumigations, summoned and bound demons, and so on.( To be sure, texts of image magic may also contain such elements, although in dif-ferent contexts and in different concentrations.) However, demonic magic was fairlyrare even in the West; texts such as the Munich manuscript published by Richard266C10 Conclusion:Sample.qxd 9/24/2008 11:52 AM Page 266"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Kieckhefer and the MS Rawlinson 252 are considered singular survivors, and it isby no means surprising that no such examples have been found so far in CentralEuropean manuscript collections.2. Some of the extant source materials contain clear indications that certainother magical works were in use and had been read in late medieval Central Europe.Precise textual borrowings in the Bellifortisattest that Conrad Kyeser, when writ-ing and compiling his work, had in front of him a copy of the Liber vaccae,andtwo texts attributed to Albertus Magnus, the Experimenta,and the De mirabilibusmundi.We have every right to suppose that the latter two texts were consulted withgreat attention also by Nicholas of Poland, the doctor from Montpellier. #e Libervisionum of John of Morigny, a (perhaps incomplete) copy of the Ars notoria,andsome further magical and crystallomantic texts were without doubt on the table ofthe author of the prayer book of Wladislas, who incorporated long paragraphs fromthese sources in his handbook. Nicholas the Hangman and Henry the Bohemianwere both accused in Kraków of possessing magical books (one of these was writtenby a certain Matthias, a necromancer); and even though these books cannot beidentified today, we may suppose that they belonged to the field of ritual magic.Finally, the author of the short book list of the Dresden manuscript—whom I believeto have been the scribe of the codex, Egidius of Corintia—was well acquaintedwith the eleventh chapter of the Speculum astronomiae,where the author of theSpeculumestablishes the classifications of Hermetic, Solomonic, and natural liter-ature; he must have also read the Picatrix;and he seems to have had firsthand in -formation about at least some of the magical and necromantic books he lists, suchas the Clavicula Salomonis, theLiber Semphoras, the Liber quattuor annulorum Salo -monis,the De arte eutonica,the Liber ad demoniacos, the Liber machometi de septemnominibus, the Liber institutionis Raziel, theLiber lunae, and the Liber Almandel.Even though these texts have no trace in the extant book collections, we can plau-sibly suppose that they were accessible for a Kraków student at the end of the fif-teenth century.3. It is perhaps naive but certainly reasonable to inquire about the originalityof this wide range of magical texts. Bearing in mind that discerning between orig-inal authorship and mere compilation has little relevance in a medieval context ingeneral, and therefore any answer to such a question is necessarily misleading, wecan say that in the fields of medicine and astronomy, Central European scholarsproved to be most fruitful and “original,” and their scientific outcome constitutesan important chapter of the history of science, but their texts on natural and imagemagic as well as on divination were, as a rule, mere reproductions of the well-knownWestern material. We have only a few, albeit striking, examples when a text is nota simple copy of an Italian, French, or German codex. Such examples are the Bel-lifortisof Kyeser and the royal prayer book of Wladislas—even though this bookS Q26710 Conclusion:Sample.qxd 9/24/2008 11:52 AM Page 267"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"is at least ninety-five percent compiled from other texts, the act and the aspects ofthe compilation can be regarded as “original,” which is the usual type of original-ity in the genre of ritual magic. Interestingly, alchemy proved the most inspiringtopic for the authors of this region: besides reproducing Western texts, such as theworks of Johannes of Rupescissa, Central European scribes had the opportunityto copy local products, too, whether they were the Latin works by Johannes Tici-nensis, the Czech Rightful Wayof John of Laz, or the alchemical process in the formof a Christian Mass by Nicolaus Melchior. While we have less reason to speak aboutCentral Europe’s own group of magician-authors, the region certainly had a con-siderable number of practicing alchemist-authors.4. Having identified the individuals who can be related to magic, we can observethat virtually none of them can be seen as a real outsider, that is, a marginal fig-ure of the society. In Poland, Bohemia, and Hungary, we find mainly insiders relatedto manuscripts of magic: university professors, monastic figures, ecclesiastical andcourtly officers, medical doctors, and engineers—that is, intellectuals whose activ-ity was not monopolized by the topic of magic. Even Nicholas of Poland, whosemedical methods and obsession with snake flesh shocked and terrified many, andcaused no little scandal around Kraków, was a doctor trained in the best schoolsof his time, and nobody considered him an obscure magician.Among the three places where readers of magic gathered—the monastery, theuniversity, and the court—the monastic milieu yielded the least evidence for a re -construction of some magical interest. Alchemy was certainly a recurrent concernfor the monks of Central Europe (as it was for monks in the West), and so wasnatural magic (probably as a form of medical knowledge), but no monastery of theregion can rival the richness of magic sources in St. Augustine’s in Canterbury. Asfar as one can judge from the extant list of titles, monastic libraries in Central Europerarely included explicitly magical items. #e courtly context was a much more fer-tile soil for a curiosity about learned magic, and this curiosity was not limited totelling the future. Courtly intellectuals were in the position of being able to reada wide range of magical materials, as it is attested by Wladislas’s prayer book, Kyeser’smilitary handbook, and the court case of Henry the Bohemian, who was accusedof invoking spirits in order to find treasure.#e greatest number of tracts, however, appears in the codices of the masters ofthe newly founded Central European universities, especially in the milieu of thechair of astrology in Kraków. #e Picatrix,the Liber runarum, the ExperimentaAlberti, and a variety of other magical works may be found in the late medievalprofessorial libraries of the region. To be sure, the predominance of university mas-ters in the role of the collectors and scribes of magical texts might have several otherreasons than their greater interest in magic. First, professors usually owned morebooks than other readers in the Midle Ages. Second, compared to other medieval268C10 Conclusion:Sample.qxd 9/24/2008 11:52 AM Page 268"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"book collections, their libraries enjoyed the best chances of survival, and are con-sequently the easiest to reconstruct. Modern national libraries, such as the Biblio -teka Jagiellońska in Kraków and the National Library of Prague, which were themain “suppliers” of this study, were originally based on private and institutionalmedieval book collections related to the university.5. #e fact that most texts of magic survived from the libraries of university peo-ple explains their codicological context, too. Generally speaking, works on naturalmagic and talismans became integral constituents of medical and astronomicalmanuscripts without being considered particularly magical or problematic, andthis reflects the fact that they had an equally organic place in the scientific interestof the collectors. Analysis of the library of a Kraków student, Johannes Virdungof Hassfurt, has proven that a clear awareness of the magical character of talismansdid not discourage some masters from including image magic in their books. Vir-dung’s collection of Hermetic and talismanic texts is especially rich even by West-ern standards. While we do not know whether he practiced the methods that hestudiously copied on the blank folios between the scientific tracts, the great num-ber of these texts, along with his later interest in the magicians of Europe, indicatesthat he was an attentive reader of image magic, and that he thus turned to the tal-ismans with deep intellectual interest.#e scientific context of magical works is almost universal: texts of philosophyand theology rarely occur together with magic. Perhaps related to this fact, the theo -retical reflections on magic, such as Al-Kindi’s De radiis stellarumand the Speculumastronomiae, also occur separately, never in the company of texts of practical magic.An exciting exception from this rule is the book list of magical works in the Dres-den manuscript, which is copied in the company of astronomical, astrological, tal-ismanic, and divinatory texts. #is difference of codicological context is one of thereasons why I think that the book list was the scribe’s own intellectual production,with the purpose of orienting the reader in the mass of magical texts partly con-tained by the same manuscript.In most cases, we are simply not in the position to decide whether the occur-rence of a magical text in a codex indicates actual practices or simple curiosity. #ePicatrixor #abit’s De imaginibuscontain no indication whether their readers con-structed talismans. Some sources are, fortunately, more talkative. #e long list ofsuccessive manuscript pages representing geomantic charts inBJ 793 among otherexamples, the sophistication with which these charts are elaborated, the indicationsand cross-references in the margins, and the omission of theoretical introductionsto the methods of divination not only point to a general, theoretical interest indivinatory methods, but indicate expertise in their concrete application. In a word,I am convinced that at least some sections of BJ 793 were copied with the definitepurpose of fortune telling. More interesting perhaps, actual use of ritual magic,S Q26910 Conclusion:Sample.qxd 9/24/2008 11:52 AM Page 269"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"crystallomancy, and the invocation of angels may also be revealed. External evi-dence—legal documents and confessions—is not the only way to prove that some-one attempted to apply the methods of crystallomancy and demon invocation;but internal evidence left in the magical texts may also show such application. Aswe have seen, in the case of the royal prayer book of Wladislas, the consequentsubstitution of the name of the operator implies that the text was prepared withthe intention of making it suitable and ready for real use, and it was in all proba-bility even consecrated.6. Once we identified the collectors of natural magic, talismanic, divinatory,alchemical, and ritual magic texts as learned monks, court intellectuals, and uni-versity masters, that is, as intelligent individuals capable of reflection, it is ratherobvious to inquire: how can we account for the fact that these persons were neverfaced with the problem that the methods they copied did not work in practice?Did they not see that the mechanism of magic is obviously false, and that its fal-sity can be easily shown with the help of simple experiments? Or did the methodsperhaps actually work?While such questions about the past might seem somewhat present-minded andthus illegitimate, the real danger is not to ask questions inspired by the concerns ofthe present (such important research fields as the history of women, childhood, oreveryday life are typically inspired by the concerns of the present), but to give answersdistorted by these concerns. We can therefore freely raise our naive questions, eventhough there is something anachronistic in such inquiries, we only have to be care -ful when answering them.In fact, we are not looking for one single answer to explain why the methodsof magic could have been seen as effective, but rather a group of interconnectedanswers. What we can claim in general, however, is that those magic practices sur-veyed in this book fitted quite well into the scientific-religious conceptual frame-work of the Middle Ages.We have already touched upon the issue of efficacy in the case of talismanic magicin Chapter 3. #ere is no point in doubting that belief in the generalprotectivepower of talismans was prevalent in the Middle Ages, and, in addition, a numberof stories support the idea that the same talismans were believed to have sufficientvirtue for concrete—for instance military—purposes, too. It happened that womenstarted feeling affection for someone, that castles were occupied, and that scorpionpopulations decreased. Success in such cases might have been attributed to magic.In other words: magic in some cases actually seemed to work. And this was closelyrelated to the fact that processes of natural and talismanic magic were not as alienfrom the contemporary natural philosophy as they are from our modern naturalscience. #e underlying assumptions behind the mechanism of talismans and magicstones, the occult virtue of herbs, and the healing power of animal substances formed270C10 Conclusion:Sample.qxd 9/24/2008 11:52 AM Page 270"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"part of the same correspondential worldview that was typical of many fields of medi -eval science. Our first answer to the initial questions is therefore that in many casesusers certainly regarded magic as effective.But what happened when such a technique manifestly did not work? Here, wehave to differentiate according to the type of magic we are discussing. Taking ritual magic first: to ask why its practitioner did not get disappointed when hisprayers to the angels did not lead to success is quite the same as to ask religiouspersons whether they become atheists if God does not accomplish what is askedin the prayers. Faith needs obviously different kinds of proof—if it needs any. Toconstruct scientific experiments with the intention of testing what percentage ofprayers turns out to be successful—even though such an experimental approachwas subject of fairly heated debate in late nineteenth-century England1—soundsbizarre both in the fifteenth century and today.To continue with the experimentaliterature and the talismans, we see a more basicdisagreement between the medieval and the present attitudes. #e self-criticismand the readiness to exclude those methods which repeatedly failed to produce theexpected results was not a particularly central idea in the natural philosophy ofthose times. As we have seen in Chapter 2, what counted as an experiment was notwhat was tested in a number of controlled experimental situations, but what theold philosophers and authorities described, and what was generally accepted aboutnature. Even for those philosophers who taught that demons—having exclusivelyspiritual and not corporal existence—are not perceivable, it was the experience, thatis, the general conviction, that proved their existence.2Against such a background, it is not surprising that relatively fantastic convic-tions could be considered through the centuries as sufficiently confirmed scientificfacts.3An instructive example is the conviction that magnets will loose their powerof attraction if they are rubbed with garlic. #is “fact” was repeated many times asa self-evident “proof” for the theory of antipathies by authors over fifteen centuries,from Plutarch to the sixteenth century. A convenient worldview (in this case thetheory of sympathies and antipathies) and a sufficiently strong textual traditionbe came more efficient means for this conviction to gain epistemological statusthan practical tests.

Even in suchcases, however, it would be anachronistic to expect them to abandon the given the -ory; various strategies less drastic than rejecting the core hypotheses of magic wereavailable to explain the failure. One could always argue that the operator had notsufficiently or correctly prepared to perform the given magical task: he had not fastedenough or attained a satisfactory level of bodily and spiritual purity. It was alsopossible to argue that the constellation at the moment of the experiment was notfavorable. Or perhaps everything happened as it was described in the handbooks,only the person was not right one. Such experiments were not conceived in thedemocratic way of the modernity (according to which an experiment carried outunder the same specified conditions can be repeated by anyone, anywhere, regard-less of gender, race, and origin): only the initiated, the adepts, could perform them,and the pupils were not necessarily in the possession of such abilities. If the givenresult was expected from a helping angel or demon, the argument could have beenmade that the spirits were able, just not willing, to do what had been required fromthem. Finally, one could always say that the instructions—originating usuallyfrom texts written several hundred years earlier—were not understood properly (justas we have serious problems in understanding Galileo’s descriptions of experiments),or that the text was simply not transmitted—copied or translated—correctly (asthe talismans of the magic squares were copied indeed with many errors).All in all, there are many reasons why the methods of magic described in thehandbooks could not be falsified, and even though I do not exclude that there mayhave been some skepticism about some methods, in general, there is no reason todoubt that most of these texts were copied with a fairly strong conviction that themethods written in them would work.7. #e last issue to be addressed here concerns the relations and links of the per-sons who can be associated in one way or another with learned magic. To put itdifferently, the question is whether any cooperation, correspondence, or intellectualcontact of magicians is detectable. If so, it remains for us to speculate whether we272C4.

My conclusionis that however ample the evidence we have concerning an intellectual interest inlearned magic in Central Europe, and especially in Kraków, there is no sufficientreason to call any of the intellectual foci and institutions a “center for magical stud-ies,” and no coherent and institutional study of magic is detectable in the region.Still, although there was no public chair of learned magic in the heart of the Uni-versity of Kraków, we can point to the presence of some important cooperationrelated to magic. It can be reconstructed in detail that in the early fifteenth centuryHenry the Bohemian worked together with other university people, a certain Stan -islas, the Italian professor Monaldus of Luca, and the Polish Nicolaus Hinczonis ofCasimiria, on his crystallomantic treasure-finding projects in the royal gardens.Sixty years later, Johannes Virdung of Hassfurt copied talismanic texts in thesame year and from the same sample book as another student of the university,Egidius of Corintia. Whether they were acquainted cannot be proven, but the sim-ilarities of their interests and the resemblance of their manuscripts suggest at leastsome intellectual contact, and one can easily imagine how they got involved in thediscussion of the content of the Liber runarumor of the Hermetic Liber de stellisbeibeniis.Virdung’s manuscripts and Egidius’s Dresden codex both contain repre-sentative selections of texts on image magic and Hermetism and surprisingly simi -lar collections of astrological texts. In addition, Egidius’s list of magical titles testifiesto a certain theoretical interest in the issue of classifying magical texts, which mayhave also easily been a topic discussed among the students of the University ofKraków. We cannot reconstruct the rest of Egidius’s life, but we know that Virdung,upon returning to Germany, took steps to become acquainted with all of his con-temporaries who were interested in magic on a technical or on a spiritual level.#us, he was in contact with Abbot Trithemius, the English necromancer Nicolausde Pulchro Monte Schonberg, and the humanist Konrad Celtis (who had also beena student at Kraków). He probably also met Johannes Mercurius and GeorgiusFaustus.If we remain with the question of the cooperation among “magicians” and thetransmission of magical ideas and texts, we cannot discount the effects of Italy andS Q27310 Conclusion:Sample.qxd 9/24/2008 11:52 AM Page 273"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Germany. #e Bohemian alchemist John of Laz claimed to be a pupil of a certainAntonio of Florence, killed in Bohemia because of his alchemical practices. In Kra -ków, the Italian Monaldus of Luca took part in the treasure-hunting practices ofa circle of university masters around Henry the Bohemian. In Hungary King Mat -thias was in correspondence with Marsilio Ficino, whose pupil and fellow in theFlorentine Academia Platonica, Francesco Bandini, even visited the royal court ofBuda; another Italian Platonist, Callimachus spent several years at the Universityof Kraków. Last but not least, the mysterious BJ 793, containing many texts onimage magic and divination, as well as the Picatrix,is probably a copy of an Ital-ian codex. Italian masters and manuscripts seem to have played a crucial role asexternal factors promoting the Central European reception of learned magic, whichreception was also facilitated by the fact that students of the region often visitedItalian universities. #e role of Germans was somewhat different, rather modeledby the Faust legend. Konrad Celtis and Johannes Virdung of Hassfurt as youngstudents went to Kraków, and although they did not study magical arts at the uni-versity, they clearly got involved in learned magic, and the manuscripts they foundin Kraków became a source of their fascination with certain genres of magic.One of the reasons why Central Europe could have seemed an adequate place fora student to satisfy his interest in magic, and why especially the University of Krakówcould have been an institution where magical texts were frequently copied, could bethe relative tolerance of magical activity in the region. I am still not arguing that Cen-tral Europe provided the students andcourtiers with a particularly magical milieu ascompared to Western Europe; however, it is undeniable that it was a relatively calmerplace with regard to criminalization. #e practice of magic did lead to court casesin several occasions—as we have seen in the cases of Nicholas the Hangman andHenry the Bohemian—but there were no such severe condemnations on the partof the university or other authorities as we can observe in contemporary Paris.A second—rather global—reason for the emergence of magical texts in the fif-teenth century might be a general European tendency, namely that from the twelfthcentury on certain forms of magic had more and more opportunity to cross theborderlines of legitimate science. It seems that the notions of both science and magicwere (and are) historically changing, dynamic constructions, and it was not ahis-toricallygiven what counted as scientific knowledge teachable at universities andwhat was excluded as dangerous and harmful, and what was seen as rational enter-prise and what was considered irrational. While arguments against certain practicesand ideas related to magic reflect a growing severity, more and more frequentlyother forms of magic in other sources were labeled as scientific. #is tendency—called the “positivization of magic”5—can be well exemplified by such classifications274C5.

As a result, the readers of magic in Central Europe are not to be lookedfor primarily within the circles of the Faustus or Mercurius-type of full-time, semi -literate, and self-made magicians, nor in that of anonymous university memberswhose number “outran the demand” and who remained without jobs. Partly be -cause local higher education started functioning in the Central European area rela-tively late, there was no time in the fifteenth century for the emergence of a surplusof university masters and an “underemployed and largely unsupervised clericalunderworld,” as had happened in the West.6As nearly as we can reconstruct thepicture, the late medieval collectors and readers of magical manuscripts of the regionbelonged to a high and respected intellectual stratum, benefited from the tolerantmilieu of the Central European universities and courts, and apparently did notfeel obliged to lock the door of the room in which they kept their books of secrets.S Q2756.

Besides his pact with the Devil, his unusual endas well makes him a real precursor of the legendary Faust-figure: in line with thecontract he signed with the magician, the Devil finally came for his soul. How-ever—as some version of the legend says—an angel, fairly incorrectly, interfered,and helped the magician violate the contract, thereby saving him from hell. Sinceno one with a past like Twardowski’s could have been allowed to enter heaven, themost convenient solution seemed to be to confine him to the Moon, where he stillresides, gazing down at Kraków.,e story is less realistic than famous, but it may have definitely been amongthe reasons why Kraków could have seemed a particularly magical town at the endof the sixteenth century for such authors as Manlius. By this time a number ofWestern European intellectuals—among them the famous English scientist, math-ematician, and angel-invoker magus John Dee—had somehow been convincedthat Central Europe was a place where practitioners of the magical arts and alchemywere particularly welcome. In fact, several centers provided some basis for suchaspirations, offering generous “research opportunities” and fairly good financial sup-port to individuals studying those arts. What these centers had in common wasthat they were not located at universities, but rather at the courts of kings andnoblemen, and that in all cases the emphasis had shifted toward alchemy, whetherpractical or spiritual.One of these noblemen was the Hungarian magnate Boldizsár Batthyány (Bal -thasar Batthyany), a great book collector, patron of book printing, fervent devoteeof the natural sciences, and not least an active student of practical alchemy. Bat -thyány (ca. 1537–90) developed a real humanist court in Németújvár (today’sGüssing in Austria) at the time when—under the reign of the Habsburg family—E: W C E W F C  B  C M S11 Epilogue:Sample.qxd 9/24/2008 11:53 AM Page 276"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"the royal court moved out from the territory of the Hungarian kingdom, settleddown in Vienna, and the country was left without an intellectual center. Batthyány’scourt did welcome wandering scholars persecuted in the West for their religiousconvictions, among them Johannes Manlius, the printer from Laibach, the sameperson who recorded for the posterity the commonplace that Kraków hosted aschool of magical studies, and the Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius, who trans-formed the count’s rosary into an exceptional botanical garden, which was the firstone in the region where paprika and perhaps even potatoes were grown, a gardenwhere vegetables were cultivated systematically not for their use but on account oftheir exotic nature.Batthyány’s intellectual relations reached far beyond the boundaries of his court;he was in correspondence with a large number of humanists, medical doctors, book-sellers, and alchemists of Western and Central Europe (among them Elias Corvinus,the Viennese professor, and Augerius de Busbeq), the chief preoccupation of hisletters being the natural sciences, in particular: alchemy. His library—the fifthlargest in Hungary at the time—was a result of a conscious selection process inwhich both the count and his book collectors played important roles. ,ese col-lectors, scattered all over Europe, had to make serious efforts on some occasionsto find a certain book at the request of the count. ,anks to his book collection,Batthyány was fairly up-to-date as far as Hermetic philosophy and the literatureof alchemy were concerned. He was a follower of the new, Paracelsian methods,and he himself performed alchemical experiments in the laboratory of Németújvár.1Batthyány’s laboratory did not survive, but we can reconstruct how it mighthave looked like from the documentation of the archeological findings from a con-temporary and fairly close alchemical laboratory, the one excavated in the chapelof the castle of Oberstockstall (Kirchberg am Wagram), in Lower Austria. Overeight hundred objects were recovered from the dig, among them ceramic and glassapparatuses, alembics, receivers, crucibles, and cupels. Active in the second half ofthe sixteenth century, this laboratory was built, sponsored, and run by a sequenceof local parish priests. But these were not ordinary priests, Urban von Trenbachfor example, during whose priesthood (1552–61) the laboratory was already active,E2771. Szabolcs Ö.

He was definitely too busyto remain involved in the alchemical experiments, but he certainly continued tosupport the activities of the laboratory through his followers, among them mem-bers of the famous Fugger family.2A third center was the court of the last Rožmberks. ,e Rožmberks were themost important Bohemian magnates, the highest representatives of the aristocracyin the sixteenth century, their court second only to that of Rudolf II. ,eir interestswere very similar to the emperor’s: they were great collectors, educated humanists,and patrons of culture, and they also shared the enthusiasm of Rudolf for theoccult arts. ,e last two members of the family, Peter Vok (1539–1611) and hiselder brother Vilém (1535–92), were both practicing alchemists; cabalists and magi-cians gathered together at their court (which traveled around in South Bohemia,the last stops being Krumlov and Třeboň). Distinguished guests were invited:Heinrich Khunrath was Vilém’s court physician, while John Dee and his medium,Edward Kelley, organized séances in the Rožmberk household.3,e magical auraof Třeboň was further accentuated by the occult nature of the Rožmberk bookcollection: this library, which contained more than ten thousand printed and man-uscript volumes—according to Václáv Březan (d. 1618), the archivist and librarianof the family who was instructed to prepare its catalog—was enriched by a greatdeal of cabalistic and alchemical manuscripts and early printings purchased by thetwo brothers.4Count Albert Łaski, Polish aristocrat, politician, humanist, and patron of artists,was yet another host of the traveling John Dee. Just like his Hungarian and Bohe -mian fellow aristocrats, Batthyány and the Rožmberks, he was fascinated by the phi -losophy of Paracelsus, and he maintained an alchemical laboratory in his birthplace,278E2.

A signof his interest in the magical arts is that during his trip to England he participatedin Dee’s famous conversations with angels in the magician’s home at Mortlake.5All these centers are, nonetheless, of secondary significance when compared withthe splendid court of Emperor Rudolf II (1552–1612). A most controversial per-sonality, Rudolf is certainly not remembered as an energetic and talented politician;however, the cultural, scientific, and magical bustle of his Prague court has givensufficient material for a number of illustrious expositions in our times. ,is wasthe court where Arcimboldo the artist, Giordano Bruno the philosopher, the astron -omers Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler, Johannes Jesensky the physician, andmagicians like John Dee and Edward Kelley preferred to spend as much time aspossible. Just this short list of names shows how international Rudolf’s court was—even by Renaissance standards: local, Italian, German, Danish, Polish, and Englishscholars and artists populated it. Most of them were deeply involved in Hermetic,Neoplatonic, and magical philosophy in one way or another; all were searchingfor the lost ancient wisdom. If we follow the career of the inner circle of physicians,astrologers, and librarians grouping around Rudolf, we will see that most of themshared the emperor’s enthusiasm for the occult arts, the Kabbalah (Johann Pistorius),emblems (Jacopo and Octavio Strada), astrology (Kepler), and alchemy (MichaelMaier, Tadeus Hájek, and Martin Ruland).6John Dee’s expectations concerning the prestige of magical arts and his ownprospects in Central Europe may have been somewhat overoptimistic, and in factit was not without frustration that he traveled back to England after his five-yearsojourn. On the other hand, even though not everything happened according tohis intentions, and he was not granted the title of “Royal Mathematician” in Prague,the English doctor by no means spent this period as an outcast magician, but en -joyed considerable support and respect from the local aristocracy.7Although thereis no evidence that the region hosted public schools of magic in Faustus’s time, wecan easily understand why a century later people believed that it had.E2795.

In 1241, when Richard of Fournival became the chancel-lor of the cathedral of Amiens, he compiled a catalog of his library, the Biblionomia.\u0017is source was published in the nineteenth century by Léopold Delisle, who282A 4.

Regrettably, the catalog was silent about this section, and this silence forcedmodern scholars to try to find these books of secrets.11Pingree, who managed toidentify some of the libri secretorum,argued that these texts were precisely thosethat were consulted by the author of the Speculum and described in detail in theeleventh chapter.12According to Bruno Roy, instead of postulating two authors forthe two catalogs, the Biblionomia and the Speculum,we should think of one sin-gle writer, Richard of Fournival, who described his collection twice, in two differ-ent ways for two different purposes.13\u0017e question of who authored the Speculum has been so controversial that no -body knows what the scholarly consensus (if any) will be in five years. \u0017is is thereason why Nicolas Weill-Parot calls the author simply Magister Speculi.14I M\u0017e list of secondary literature on image magic starts with one medieval and oneRenaissance book: the Speculum astronomiae and the Opus preaclarum de imagini -bus astrologicis of Hieronymus Torrella. \u0017e Speculum, as we have seen, classifiesthe texts on talismans according to internal criteria (involvement of ritual elements,demons, and suffumigations) by examining the methods applied.

Kieckhefer does not use it consistently as a technical term,21while \u0017orndike, Pingree, and Burnett apply the category of “talismanic texts” with-out showing special preference for this expression.Regarding finally the specific research questions related to the field of imagemagic, I would like to emphasize three fields that have been in constant develop-ment in recent years. \u0017e first of them is the issue of Hermetic texts, which is atthe center of scholarly interest and editorial practice, as it is described in Chapter 3.\u0017e second concerns a specific text, the Picatrix,which, because of its complexity,cannot be viewed as a simple practical talismanic text, but rather as a compen -dium of natural, talismanic, and ritual methods. \u0017e wide scholarly interest in thePicatrix,dating at least from the time of Aby Warburg, did not result in a criticaledition of the Latin version to accompany the Arabic original22until Vittoria PerroneCompagni published parts of the text in 1975.23In 1986 David Pingree publishedan edition of the complete Latin text.24Perrone Compagni and Pingree have goneon to produce studies on the sources, compiled elements, and medieval diffusionof the Picatrix that have proved indispensable for any understanding and researchof the text.25\u0017e third developing field in contemporary research concerns the most basictext of image magic, \u0017ebit’s De imaginibus.26\u0017ābit ibn Qurra, this productivetranslator of Aristotle, mathematician and astronomer, lived in Baghdad in the ninthcentury. \u0017ābit’s work on manufacturing talismans, the Arabic version of whichis lost, survived in two Latin translations, one by John of Seville (De imaginibus)and one by Adelard of Bath (Liber prestigiorum).27( The medieval translators usedprestigiumas the equivalent for the Arabic word meaning “talisman.”) Translationsof the same text cannot differ more than these two: it is rather instructive that theauthor of the Speculum,while accepting John of Seville’s version as nondemonic,B E  C D28521.

Charles Burnett,who also prepared an edition of the Liber prestigiorumof his own, has researched thesources of Adelard and the reasons for the differences between the two versions.29Most recently, Vittoria Perrone Compagni identified new sources of Adelard’s ver-sion, the Hermetic Liber lunae and the Liber solis from the collection entitled Liberplanetarum ex scientia Abel, which were supposedly translated by Adelard himself(as terminological parallels between the three texts indicate). With this discoveryand supposition, she seemed to refute the idea that Adelard’s version is closer to theArabic original text of \u0017ābit.30\u0017e question still remains: were the elements of theLiber prestigiorum borrowed from other Hermetic works inserted by Adelard (as Per-rone Compagni claims), or did he translate a version of \u0017ābit’s text on talismanswhich already contained these additions (in accordance with Burnett’s theory)? \u0017isdebate does not have a direct effect on our present research, since as far as it can bejudged at the moment, no manuscript of the Liber prestigiorum (which had a moremodest circulation than the De imaginibus) is preserved in any of the Central Euro-pean countries. Ultimately, however, it does concern us, since the local success andsurvival of magical texts depended greatly on the role they played in the Western tex-tual tradition, and on whether they were deemed as natural and tolerable, or de -monic and abominable.R MModern scholarship divides the literature of ritual magic into two subgenres: thedemonic and the angelic. The difference lies not only in whether the spirits invokedare malign or benign in nature, but also in the purposes of the given art and in thetechniques applied.31In the absence of Central European examples for the demoniccategory,32we will limit the present discussion to the second type, and particularlyto the notory art—a branch of magic performed in a Christian framework.33286A 28.

However,at the moment no evidence supports the idea that these theories could have beentransmitted in any indirect ways (through Greek, Byzantine, or Arabic-Spanishmediation); therefore, in the absence of any bridge over the gap between the LateAntique Greek and the medieval Latin theurgy, two possibilities remain: either theArs notoria is an endogenous phenomenon with no direct influence from Neopla-tonic philosophy as Boudet suggests,46rejecting the argument on the resurgence of288A 42.

As we remem-ber, the eleventh chapter of the Speculum astronomiaecondemned a set of texts asdetestable for a number of reasons, and on the basis of the attribution of the textsreferred in this section, David Pingree labeled this category as Solomonic magic.It would be logical to expect the author of the Speculum to include the Ars noto-riain this category, since it is the most famous magical text attributed to Solomon,but he does not, it is left to us to decide whether or not he should have. NicolasWeill-Parot’s answer is positive: the Ars notoriais ascribed to Solomon, as it con-tains unintelligible words and obscure language in the prayers, as well as imagesfor contemplation, that is, all the basic traits characterizing Solomonic magic.50Incontrast, one could argue that while the author of the Speculummakes it clear thatthe detestable texts bind and compel spirits (as opposed to the Hermetic texts, whichpersuade them), the orations and prayers to God and his angels in the Ars notoriado not actually contain any constraint; instead, they are humble appeals similar tothe attitude of Christian liturgy. \u0017e adept of the art does not conjure spirits, butmodestly addresses divine power through holy and mystical techniques; so, accord-ing to the terminology of the Speculum,the Ars notoria,paradoxically, is Hermeticrather than Solomonic. Finally and most important, the question of why the authorof the Speculum astronomiaeneglects the Ars notoriamay be seen as misleadingaltogether: why should he mention it at all? As Frank Klaassen stresses, there is noreason to expect the eleventh chapter of the Speculum to include the notory art,since the Speculumconcentrates on texts involving imago astronomica,which thenotae in the Ars notoriaare not.51\u0017e Speculumis concerned with texts on astron-omy and astrology (mostly of Arabic origin), while the Ars notoria simply does notbelong to this category.While it does not strictly concern the medieval circulation of the Ars notoria,the research carried out by Stephen Clucas is worth mentioning.

JosephH.

Although the Ars notoriapresented itself in a Chris-tian framework, John of Morigny found it demonically inspired, and purifying itby the Virgin’s help, he gave birth to an exceptional collection of Marian visions,the Liber visionum beate Marie.Even though it has been discovered just recently, andwas virtually unknown to earlier scholarship, a number of accurate studies pub-lished since the 1990s seem to make up for this previous disregard considerably.Dupèbe had already discussed an incomplete version of this text and its earlycondemnation,55but Sylvie Barnay was the first scholar to show a deeper interestin the text, and who had access to the whole text including its autobiographicalprologue.56While Barnay examined the Liber visionum from the point of view ofmedieval Mariology and situated it in the history of the apparitions of the BlessedVirgin, several of the studies in Claire Fanger’s book dedicated to the questions290A 52.

However, thegeographical dissemination of the Liber visionum manuscripts and the casual rein-terpretations and recontextualisations of its text are domains still waiting to beresearched.As scholarship on this text develops, new manuscripts turn up continually, inwhich full, partial, or adapted versions of the prayers of John the monk occur.58Inthe meantime, Claire Fanger and Nicholas Watson are preparing an edition of theLiber visionum.So far, however, only its autobiographical prologue is accessible.59But even this prologue has proven to be a particularly rich source of informa-tion. In it, Brother John describes in great detail that before redacting his own ver-sion, he used to practice the Ars notoria,and what is more, he even composed anecromantic book.60\u0017erefore—as Fanger observes—when he condemns this mag-ical practice, his attitude is not merely academic, and his standpoint not simplytheological: he speaks through personal experience.61John goes on to inform usthat when he finally realized the wickedness of the Ars notoria,he gave up its prac-tice. He had no fewer than three reasons to do so: personal, angelic, and theolog-ical ones. \u0017e personal reason is presented in the autobiographical prologue: John’ssister, called Gurgeta, was also an active practitioner of the Ars notoria,in order tolearn to read and write with extra speed. But after she started this accelerated methodof learning, she had horrible visions and malign spirits haunted her, which—asJohn concludes—is a sign indicating demonic involvement in the notory art.62Asa result, she renounced the Ars notoria, and the devils consequently withdrew.John’s angelic reasons were no less explicit: in a number of visions, he heard thevoice of supernatural powers, especially the Virgin Mary, telling him that he shouldnot let himself be persuaded about the most holy nature of this art—which it claimsto be—because it is deeply evil, and should be abandoned.63John’s third worry in relation to the art may be called theological: on the basis B E  C D29157.

Aquinas condemns the notoryart for its use of figures and unknown words (verba ignota)64—assuming that thesecomponents are means of communication between the practitioner and demons.\u0017ese are exactly those elements that John got rid of in his revision. Two surpris-ing conclusions may be drawn here—and are indeed drawn by Claire Fanger.65Onthe one hand, Aquinas was unexpectedly well prepared in the topic he is condemn-ing; he knew very well the aims of the notory art (acquisition of earthly knowledgein a very short period), and the arguments with which the practice defends itself(it is a holy practice, acknowledged by God, presenting no demonic danger). Onthe other hand, John, a practitioner of ritual magic, was well aware of the theo-logical problems his methods can raise, and was careful enough to remove the ele-ments responsible for these problems. In other words, there is more intellectualcontact between the official Christian orthodoxy and those involved in magicalpractices than scholarship had believed. It is also possible that this contact actuallyturned into a theological debate, in which the Liber visionum was an attempt atcreating the genre of a nondemonic ritual magic.66Finally, it should be mentioned that Jean-Patrice Boudet and Julien Véronèsehave collaborated on an article that provides a helpful overview on the whole genreof ritual magic.67In it they survey all of the basic texts of the genre, such as theClavicula Salomonis,the Liber Almandal,the Liber Raziel,the Ars Notoria,the LiberJuratus,and the Liber visionum.292A 64. \u0017omas Aquinas, Summa \u0016eologiae,2a–2ae, q. 96.65.

The line between the scientific and the magical was blurred. According to popular lore, magicians of the Middle Ages were trained in the art of magic in “magician schools” located in various metropolitan areas, such as Naples, Athens, and Toledo. It was common knowledge that magic was learned and that cities had schools designed to teach the dark arts. The Spanish city of Toledo, for example, was so renowned for its magic training schools that “the art of Toledo” was synonymous with “the art of magic.” Until Benedek Láng’s work on Unlocked Books, little had been known about the place of magic outside these major cities. A principal aim of Unlocked Books is to situate the role of central Europe as a center for the study of magic.magic i n historyU n l o c k e d B o o k sp e n ns t a t ep r e s sL á n gLáng helps chart for us how the thinkers of that day—clerics, courtiers, and university masters—included in their libraries not only scientific and religious treatises but also texts related to the field of learned magic. These texts were all enlisted to solve life’s questions, whether they related to the outcome of an illness or the meaning of lines on one’s palm. Texts summoned angels or transmitted the recipe for a magic potion. Láng gathers magical texts that could have been used by practitioners in late fifteenth-century central Europe.B e n e d e k L á n g is Assistant Professor in the Department of Philosophy and History of Science, Budapest University of Technology and Economics.jacket illustration: Planetary figures from the Picatrix, BJ 793, fol. 190r.
