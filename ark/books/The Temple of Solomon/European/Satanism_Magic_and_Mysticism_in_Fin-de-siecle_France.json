Huysmans once explained that what sparkedhis interest in the occult and supernatural was a wish to find “somecompensation for the horror of daily life, the squalor of existence,the excremental filthiness of the loathsome age we live in.”1Horrifiedby the trend toward secularism and money worship, he had seen thecrooked streets of Paris made straight, robbed of their charm, the city’sbeauty destroyed by Baron Haussmann’s geometric urban grids. Humaninteraction, with its complexity and richness, had given way to busi-ness dealings with their emphasis on profit. Even the sacraments hadbeen profaned by tradespeople and merchants, who diluted Commu-nion wine by adding alcohol and alum and who substituted oat flourand potato starch for Eucharistic wheat. It was Huysmans’s ambition touse his art to mask the vulgarity of life that explains in part his fasci-nation with the aesthetics of Satanism. It is also what motivated him touncover the clandestine practice of devil worship in turn-of-the-centuryParis, what fueled his research into the monstrous crimes of medievalSatanist Gilles de Rais.Born in Paris in 1848, Huysmans was baptized in the Latin Quarterat Saint-Séverin, a church that would figure prominently in his laterreligious writings. Huysmans’s early work gave little foreshadowing ofhis eventual turn toward supernaturalism. Instead, books likeSac au dos(Knapsack1878), which fictionalized his service in the Mobile Guardduring the Franco-Prussian War, his rollicking account of working-classlife and romance inLes Soeurs Vatard(The Vatard Sisters1879), situatedthe fledgling novelist squarely in the emergent naturalist camp. How-ever, Huysmans’s association with Emile Zola and his inclusion in theMédan group proved short-lived as he soon judged naturalism as pre-senting an incomplete picture of human life. Huysmans’s metaphysical1"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"2Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Franceruminations, his plumbing of the unconscious are already evident inhis gaudy masterpiece,Arebours(Against the Grain1884), and in thelabyrinthine dream narratives woven into the country novelEn Rade(Becalmed1887). Huysmans’s growing interest in religion and the occultwas in part motivated by a need to explain the mystery of suffering.In the years following the publication ofEn Rade, the health of his long-time mistress, Anna Meunier, worsened dramatically. Literary colleaguesand close friends like Barbey d’Aurevilly and Villiers de l’Isle-Adam diedin quick succession, the latter after a painful, protracted illness. Suffer-ing to Huysmans could not be a matter of accident or circumstance, andinstead presupposed a supernatural causality that gave it purpose andmeaning.At the same time, Huysmans’s impatience with the aridity of natural-ist aesthetics moved him to investigate the domains of the diabolicaland sublime. However, his immersion in esotericism was inspired bymore than disillusionment with the triumph of materialism in fin-de-siècle France. Unable to find in Catholic teaching an explanationfor the apparent cruelty of God, impervious to human suffering andslow in returning to save the downtrodden, Huysmans evolved a per-sonal belief system grounded in mystical eschatology, whose adherentsformed an aristocracy of self-sacrifice and genius. The problematic deityfound by Huysmans and his fictional heroes in Catholic orthodoxywas the heartless, detached, impassive figure mentioned inArebours.Like des Esseintes, Huysmans had been scandalized by the doctrineof original sin, revolted by the apotheosis of the scoundrel and theoppression of the innocent. He thus agreed with Schopenhauer, whohad famously observed: “If a God did make this world, I should notlike to be this God, for the misery of the world would break myheart.”2By following Huysmans’s evolution as an esotericist and man of faith,one finds that – more than any other public figure – his career followedthe trajectory of fin-de-siècle occultism. He stands out as the authorof the most notorious Satanic novel of the era,The Damned(Là-bas1891); he interacted with virtually all of the leading hermeticists of theday; he engaged in necromantic warfare with his diabolical adversaries,warding off their spells with magic apotropaion and exotic, mystic rit-uals. Huysmans later became conversant with the apocalyptic doctrineof Eugène Vintras, adopting from the heretical cultist a belief in thecoming Third Age of the Paraclete. Following his conversion and appar-ent return to traditional church dogma, Huysmans evolved a personalview of Catholicism as a religion of martyrdom and miracles, in which"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Introduction3supernatural wonders fought eternally with monstrous evil, striving fordominion in the daily lives of ordinary people.A denizen of the French capital, Huysmans spent much of his life as afunctionary at the Ministry of the Interior. This unremarkable career asa government employee contrasts with his colorful and turbulent rolein the world of fin-de-siècle mysticism and art. First a full-throated par-tisan of Emile Zola and the naturalist cause, Huysmans proclaimed thatthe artist’s place was in the raucous confusion of the world, among realpeople whose coarseness was grist for naturalist depictions. Naturalism,in Zola’s view, was a democratizing force, a scientific instrument used todiagnose social evils and prescribe remedies. While Huysmans dismissedthe theory in Zola’sLe Roman experimental(The Experimental Novel1880),he had welcomed naturalism’s interest in the lives of common people,had embraced the goal of examining the plight of the poor and dispos-sessed. Defending Zola, whoseL’Assommoirhad been characterized aspornographic, Huysmans argues that a writer should escape the prisonof Romantic subjectivity: “we go into the street that teems with life; wetry to plant on their feet beings of flesh and bone, beings that speak thelanguage that was taught them, beings that throb with life.”3From 1879 to 1880, Huysmans, increasingly involved in art criticism,had taken to championing the innovative works of the Impressionists,writing laudatory essays on Gustave Moreau and Odilon Redon, pub-lishing a collection of his reviews inL’Art moderne(Modern Art) in 1883.Huysmans’s own subjectivist aesthetic placed him at odds with Zola,his erstwhile mentor. Yet his disaffection with naturalism had more todo with its scientific apparatus, its diagnostic methods, and utopianpretentions.InLà-bas(The Damned1891) Huysmans’s protagonist, the novelistDurtal, denounces naturalism’s emphasis on appetites and instincts, oninsanity and sex. It had degenerated, as Durtal argues, into a “senti-mental surgical support, a spiritual truss.”4While naturalism had takenHuysmans outside, into the streets, his Decadent masterpiece,Arebours,barricades him in a cloistered world of artificiality. For the hero, JeanFloressas des Esseintes, art’s realm is an aestheticizing consciousness. Vis-itors are forbidden in his retreat at Fontenay. Soundless servants wearingslippers are consigned to the mansion’s upper floor. Surviving on a dietof rare perfumes, flowers, and poetry, des Esseintes admits no mistresses,etherealizing women into memories.But with elimination of the outside world came a craving for unreality,as des Esseintes furnishes his bedroom with the austerity of an anchorite,collecting religious bibelots, consecrated custodials, and chasubles – and"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"4Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Franceintuiting that beyond literature lies the domain of the transcendental.Sharing the author’s skepticism, des Esseintes had scoffed at the “psy-chology of mysticism,” yet had toyed with the idea of worshippinga divinityarebours, summoning God by invoking Satan, following aliturgy of sacrilege. Fantasies had come to him of “shameful and impureabuses of the holy water and the holy oil.” He had imagined God’santagonist, “a rival full of vigor, the Devil, [...] cabbalistic excesses,black masses, witches’ Sabbaths, thoughts of exorcism, all these cameinto play.”5Foreshadowed by des Esseintes’s dilettantish interest in diabolism,Huysmans’s own path toward conversion had led him to an investi-gation of the Satanic, both in medieval history and in the reality ofcontemporary Paris. In Huysmans’s blockbuster novel on the mysteriesof devil worship, he presents a picture of the occult world in fin-de-siècle France. There, as Richard D. E. Burton claims, Huysmans’s “readergains access to a curious and disturbing (anti)religious underworld, partreal, part inverted, in which spiritualism, sexual perversion, and mad-ness intersect, populated by men and women who, thirsting for somekind of absolute gratification but despairing of or hostile to orthodoxChristianity, turn to Satanism as a way out of the ‘materialist prisonhouse’ of late nineteenth-century France.”6Biographer Robert Baldick questions whether Huysmans ever wit-nessed a Black Mass of the kind he describes in a memorable chapterof his novel. However, Baldick’s commentary underscores the ambigu-ous status of Huysmans’s book, as well as the complex reaction it elicitedfrom the public. Part novel, part documentary on contemporary Parisianmores, part archeological reconstruction of medieval Satanic practices,Huysmans’s text became popular by appealing to audiences’ love of sen-sationalist invention as well as to serious readers’ concerns with thereligious problem of good and evil.In his book, pederast choirboys with powdered cheeks and carminedlips attend a priest presiding over a ritual enveloped in the smoke oftoxic incense. In a later scene, Huysmans’s hero is taken to a squalidchophouse, to an upstairs bedroom whose filthy mattress is strewn withdesecrated Hosts. Huysmans’s hero had been sickened by the ignominyof contemporary devil worship, and while Satanism as it was practicedin the distant Middle Ages had been haloed with the sulfurous mysteryof conjecture, the Black Mass Durtal witnesses enacts only the banalityof evil.By 1887, Huysmans’s research into the occult had put him into con-tact with the foremost magicians of the day. Stanislas de Guaïta, with"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Introduction5his vast knowledge and personal wealth, had established himself as theEminence Grise of the esoteric movement and would publish in 1890AuSeuil du mystère(On the Threshold of Mystery), an encyclopedic overviewof Occidental occultism. Gérard Encausse, whose pseudonym, Papus,was taken from the works of Apollonius of Tyana, had authored popu-larized analyses of the Kabbalah and the Tarot, and, in 1888, togetherwith Guaïta, he had founded L’Ordre de la Rose-Croix, intending toreawaken the traditions of Rosicrucianism and alchemy in turn-of-the-century France. Most important was the acquaintance Huysmans madewith the visionary Jules Bois, author ofLe Satanisme et la magie(Satanismand Magic1895), for which Huysmans contributed an important intro-duction. There Huysmans chronicles the spread of nineteenth-centuryLuciferianism, warns of the malignancy of Palladism, a Satanic cultlinked to the Freemasons and which was later exposed as an impostureperpetrated by master hoaxer Léo Taxil.However, it was not until Huysmans made contact with the notoriousJoseph-Antoine Boullan, whose expertise in Satanism Huysmans viewedas essential in documenting his novel, that the author finally pene-trated into the dark heart of fin-de-siècle necromancy. One of the finde siècle’s most colorful figures, Boullan had been the target of criminalprosecution and the object of church sanction on numerous occasionsbefore Huysmans began corresponding with him in 1890. Co-founderin 1859 of the Society for the Reparation of Souls, Boullan had becomeinfamous for his sorties into supernaturalism and sacrilege. Accusedof ceremonial child-murder, of authorizing orgiastic rituals, Boullanwas allegedly an accomplished exorcist conversant with an array ofoccult practices. Aware of Boullan’s spotted reputation, yet wishing tobe accurate in his writing, Huysmans had set aside his reservationsand had written directly to the controversial cleric. Huysmans’s hopehad been to disprove materialism’s impoverishing principles, to demon-strate that the devil did exist, to “show Zola, Charcot, the spiritualists,and the rest that nothing of the mysteries which surround us has beenexplained.”7After an extended exchange of correspondence between the clericand the writer, Boullan, in 1890, sent his housekeeper, the eccentricoracle Julie Thibault, to inquire about Huysmans’s intentions in aninterview conducted face to face. Not long after Julie had delivered apositive report to her employer, Huysmans had been inundated withinformation about the secrets of black magic: incubism, succubism,bewitchments, and counter-spells, ceremonies for warding off attack bydeadly larval beings."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"6Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FranceHuysmans’s indebtedness to Boullan as his initiator into occult mat-ters had led him to take sides in the ensuing conflict between initiates.Years before, Guaïta’s ally, fellow occultist Oswald Wirth, had infiltratedBoullan’s sect with the goal of exposing its sacrilegious practices, rit-uals devolving into adultery and incest. Having found Boullan guiltyand passed a death sentence against him, Guaïta dispatched against thepriest a host of invisible assailants. Warned by ornithomantic messagesand astrological charts, Boullan had protected himself by conductingthe Sacrifice to the Glory of Melchidedek. Huysmans had been chal-lenged to a duel, Guaïta and Bois had exchanged pistol shots, andBoullan had died mysteriously in 1893, “done to death by magic,” asHuysmans would steadfastly maintain.8WhenLà-basfirst appeared in February 1891, it became an instanta-neous bestseller catapulting the author into fame. While some readersofL’Echo de Paris, in which the book appeared in serial form, weresufficiently scandalized to cancel their subscription to the paper, thenovel’s reception was generally favorable, and the controversy surround-ing Huysmans’s work resulted in impressive sales. Several prominentoccultists disputed the authenticity of Huysmans’s research, as Péladandismissed the book as fraudulent invention, and Papus claimed thatHuysmans’s sources had largely been encyclopedias on Satanism. Yeteven these acrimonious denunciations had generated publicity, andHuysmans’s star continued rising as his novel flew off the shelves. “Andwhen, on its publication in book form in April, the Bibliothèque desChemins de Fer banned the novel from its railway stalls, its success wasassured,” as Baldick adds by way of summary.9Yet Huysmans’s association with Boullan and his visionaryhandmaiden, Julie Thibault, continued to direct the author’s spiri-tual evolution long after his anatomy of Satanism was published.Huysmans’s disgust for reality and its enshrinement in naturalist arthad prompted him to seek escape into the otherworldly and supernatu-ral, “anywhere out of the world,” as Baudelaire described it. And whileHuysmans’s misanthropic temperament had made the truth of Satanismseem more plausible, once the writer had explored the netherworld, hehad turned his eyes heavenward,là-haut(up there).Little by little, Boullan had instructed Huysmans in the doctrine ofthe notorious heretic and prophet Eugène Vintras, whose controversialteachings on sexuality and suffering had continued to affect discipleslong after Vintras’s death. The so-called “Prophet of Tilly,” relentlesslypersecuted by the church, Vintras had advanced a powerful messageon the imminence of the apocalypse, attracting important members to"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Introduction7his messianic cult. Boullan shared Vintras’s unorthodox views on adul-tery and redemption and professed the same mystical expectation ofthe forthcoming world’s end, and, following Vintras’s death in 1875,Boullan had successfully positioned himself as his successor.It was from Vintras that Boullan drew his views on expiatory suf-fering on behalf of others. And so, when Huysmans’s mistress, AnnaMeunier, had declined into insanity and had been interned in the asy-lum of Saint-Anne in 1893, he likely recalled Boullan’s explanation ofthe doctrine of Mystic Substitution. Boullan’s theory was that Anna’sordeal had been divinely ordained, and that those whom Christ lovesbest are those he allows to suffer most. As Baldick remarks, it was fromBoullan and from his coreligionist Léon Bloy – “those two apostles ofpain”10– that Huysmans was initiated into the mysteries of Dolorism,the belief that suffering was a privilege, a mark of election – that thetorments of a few purchased the redemption of the many.Huysmans’s meditation on the expiatory plight of Anna Meunier –his admiration for the pilgrim/prophetess Julie Thibaut – had soft-ened the antipathy for women he had exhibited for so long. Initially,Huysmans had been infected by Schopenhauerian misogyny, believ-ing that the female animal was what imprisoned man in a world ofinstinctual automatism. Like many of his Decadent contemporaries,Huysmans had despised woman “in her pure carnal existence.” He hadcome to believe that sexual passion could be experienced only “on thelevel of culpability,” that it could be understood only as “a privilegedexpression of Satanism, a fundamental impulse toward self-debasementthat constitutes true perversity.”11However, in the teachings of Vintras,Huysmans had found an image of women as avatars of the MaterDolorosa, intercessors whose bodily suffering secured a deliverance ofthe spirit.When, in 1891, Huysmans’s spiritual quest first put him in contactwith Abbé Arthur Mugnier, the priest who would guide him towardhis eventual conversion, the novelist was still torn by his warringimages of women: as the Beast of Revelation, the Maenad or the Harlot,a Schopenhauerian instrument of man’s utter degradation, or as theembodiment of compassion who mourned her son beneath the Cross.During his visits to Mugnier’s residence, Huysmans confessed to hissexual obsession with a prostitute, Fernande, transposed in his unpub-lished novel,Là-haut, as the boyish sex worker, Florence, “who with hertomboy’s open face goes about with her nose up in the air.”12The drama that played out in much of fin-de-siècle fiction – inthe works of Léon Bloy as well as in the pre-conversion books by"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"8Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FranceHuysmans – describes male authors as helpless pawns of Satanic LustGoddesses or as grateful beneficiaries of the expiatory trials of femalemartyrs. In Bloy, these roles are often played by an identical femalefigure: the prostitute rescued from the street who undergoes a spec-tacular awakening, becoming a saint whose tears wash the author’ssins away. Transformation of man’s pruritus into a glorious salvation –effected by a woman who suffers unspeakable torments on his behalf –suggests that Dolorism is supported by an unconscious sadism, aswomen are made to suffer to redeem the men whose perdition theyhad caused. Huysmans’s ambivalence toward woman takes the formof a Manichean drama: “Lust and the Church, however implausible itseemed, worked together to share him equally. Wishing to possess him,they raised themselves up and resolutely joined in the struggle.”13Vintras’s alleged institution of the ritual of theladder of life, wherewomen use their sexuality as the instrument of the Fall, in order toraise the sinner up and ensure his spiritual redemption, illustrates what,for Huysmans and other fin-de-siècle mystic writers, would define Eve’srelationship to Mary.Huysmans’s conversion and retreat at the Trappist monastery ofNotre-Dame d’Igny (begun on July 12, 1892), a sojourn recounted indetail in his autobiographical novelEn Route(1895), marks a disappear-ance of the she-devils who formerly had tortured him and whose evilmajesty he had heralded in his essay on Félicien Rops (Certains1889).These give way to gentle soul-guides like Durtal’s housekeeper, MadameBavoil, or to Warriors of the Lord, the mystic Sin-eaters, thegluttons forpain, who were propitiatory victims transmuting guilt into forgiveness.Already inLà-haut, Huysmans had contemplated undertakingawhitebook,a counterweight to the biography of the medieval child-murderer,Gilles de Rais: “he jumped at once from one extreme to another, andafter digging into medieval Satanism in his study of the Maréchal deRais, he had found nothing interesting left to probe than the life of asaint. It was then that a few discoveries made in Gorrès’sMystique Divinehad launched him on the trail of the Blessed Lydwine, in search of newdocuments.”14From the brothel to the church, from Fernande to the Virgin,Huysmans moves from the black book of the devil to a hagiographyof suffering immaculacy. Published in 1902,Sainte Lydwine de Schiedamdescribes not only the end of Huysmans’s journey from misogyny tohyperdulia. It also marks the humbling of the foremost Decadent super-naturalist, whose name and narrative presence are eclipsed by the gloryof his subject."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Introduction9Huysmans’s remarkable reconstruction of the life of the fifteenth-century Dutch visionary is both a clinical record of religion aspsychopathology and a study of the operation of a soteriologicaleconomy – of suffering as it redresses the balance of good and evil inthe universe. It also illustrates a dialectic at work in fin-de-siècle super-naturalism, between elitism and fraternalism, isolation and the gift ofself. A generation of artists who had started with a sense of solidar-ity, resolved to go into the streets and tell the stories of those theysaw there, had become an aristocratic coterie of occultists and Magi,inaccessible in their fortresses of esoteric wisdom. Huysmans’ charac-ter, Durtal, had climbed into the bell-tower of Saint-Sulpice where, withhis initiate-acquaintances, he had discussed the odiousness of life, theoafishness of common people, and the dawning of the Third Age of theParaclete.Huysmans’s apparent confusion, manifested during the writing ofLà-bas, between exorcists and necromancers, Satanists and their adver-saries, might be expressive of an underlying ambivalence toward thedevil – not as the champion of the rich, not as the vassal of the banker,but as the spokesman for the ostracized, as Huysmans’s friend Jules Boisdescribes him. In certain centuries, as Bois says, humanity sometimesfalls so low, humanity dishonors itself so much that it calls on Satan, noton God. Herein lies the devil’s power: “he suffers” as Bois concludes.15Indeed, suffering is the leitmotif in the mystical writings of the fin desiècle. Although it is endured alone and thus defines an aristocracy ofchosen victims, it is welcomed and undergone on behalf of an anony-mous collectivity of sinners. From Vintras and Boullan, Huysmans hadreceived the message of apocalypticism, and in the opening ofSainteLydwine, he describes the harrowing of fifteenth-century Europe, theascendancy of despots, perverts, and blasphemers whose transgressionsmust be counterbalanced by the agonies of saints. The turn of the nine-teenth century, like the conclusion of Lydwine’s era, saw the weight ofevil grow so great that God would soon unleash his vengeance.Included inLà-haut, with the account of Huysmans’s 1891 pilgrim-age to La Salette, is the text ofMélanie’s secret, the message delivered bythe Virgin to the unlettered cowherd Mélanie Calvat at the time of theApparition on September 19, 1846. Warning of dire events to come –famine, pestilence, church turmoil – if the clergy did not reform itselfand the faithful failed to observe the Sabbath, the Virgin’s message rein-forced the millenarianism of numerous fin-de-siècle Catholics. Amongthese were Huysmans and his nemesis, Léon Bloy, both of whom seemedto long for a detergent Armageddon."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"10Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FranceThe era of the Holy Spirit, as envisaged by Vintras, is explained in adiscussion among intellectuals and occultists inLà-bas. With the conclu-sion of the Second Age of the crucified Redeemer, the need for expiatorysuffering would similarly end. No longer would man be the slave ofhis sexual desires and, in accordance with a mystical eugenics, onlythe elect would reproduce. Having served as redemptive martyrs or asinstruments of Satan, women would usher in the Paraclete at the sametime that their roles became obsolete. Yet in professing Vintrasian doc-trine, Huysmans had not moved beyond his original misanthropy, hisloathing for the insolent triumphalism of the “fetid bourgeoisie,” “theapotheosis of crooked politicians and financiers.”16It was only in the aftermath of his conversion that Huysmans lefthis novels’ center stage, that the voice of the aesthete grew less clam-orous and shrill. Huysmans had resembled his occult brethren for whommagic was an insignia of distinction, for whomGnosisor privileged wis-dom permitted membership in a new elite. Yet in the writings of hiscontemporaries, there had been a willingness to go down among thepeople. Guaïta had referred to the need to descend the ladder of secretknowledge. Papus had assumed the role of popularizer of arcane doc-trine. And Joséphin Peladan, the most overweening of the hermeticists,had seen the need to mentor neophytes in writingComment on devientmage(How One becomes a Magus1892).When Huysmans next had heard the devil speak, it was after histaking of Communion, when a disputatious voice had denied theauthenticity of the sacrament. Whereas, inArebours, des Esseintes islocked in his soliloquizing consciousness, pleased to pursue a dialogueexclusively with himself, Durtal inEn Routehears his own voice as thedevil’s, and so prays for inner silence so that he can hear the wordof God.The decentering of Huysmans’s character is traced by his positionalrelocation. In his historical analysis of the architectural symbolism ofChartres (The Cathedral1898), the narrator does not expand to fill asumptuous Thebaïd but is dwarfed by the magnificence of an edificebuilt by a mystic collectivity. In 1889, Huysmans became an oblate at theBenedictine Abbey of Saint-Martin in Ligugé, living outside the cloister,adjacent to, but not belonging to, the Order – moving toward it (ob), as isetymologically suggested by his title, remaining marginalized by choicein the practice of his faith. And finally, inLes Foules de Lourdes(TheCrowds of Lourdes1906), the last novel of Huysmans’s life, his narrativealter-ego, the self-analyzing Durtal, finally disappears so that the writer’ssubjectivity ceases to be his sole material."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction11The naturalist who, in the street, had mingled with the people “throb-bing with life,” becomes a naturalist observer of the crowds of pilgrimswho throng to Lourdes. Wishing to emulate Claude Bernard in usingfiction as diagnostic medicine, Zola had proposed that his methodol-ogy treat the sick and the insane, curing poverty and alcoholism withscience-based enlightenment.In the writings of other fin-de-siècle Satanists, occultists, and mystics,the suffering of the poor emerged as a prominent concern: in the com-passionate revolt of Jules Bois’s empathetic Lucifer, in Vintras’s imageof the downtrodden as the crucified members of Christ’s body, in LéonBloy, for whom the flesh and blood of the poor were Eucharistic sub-stances. On the one hand, monsters and pariahs sought compassionfrom the devil; on the other, martyrs’ pain was the alchemy that turnedself-pity into altruism.In Huysmans’s last book, he returns to naturalism that had beenthe point of his departure. He goes out in the street, studying thosedeformed by lupus, ravaged by cancer, twisted by paralysis. In writingLydwine, Huysmans had learned that suffering only prepared the way forrapture and that, in being crucified with Christ, the martyr was blessedwith mystic ecstasy. For the saint, the only sickness she is impatient thatChrist relieve is the affliction of corporeity, the martyrdom of life.Already in the spring of 1900, Huysmans had begun to exhibit symp-toms of the cancer of the jaw that would take his life seven years later.By 1905, when he undertook his work onLes Foules de Lourdes,hisphys-ical condition was little better than the invalids who made their way tothe pilgrimage city.In Lourdes, Huysmans describes repairing to the clinic of DoctorBoissarie, seeing a physician trace the interface between medicine andmiracle. Charged with scientifically ascertaining the authenticity ofdivine cures, the doctor applies his medical knowledge to determinethe point at which it fails. Fin-de-siècle occultism is positioned onthis threshold – between science and supernaturalism, chemistry andalchemy, mathematics and Kabbalism, empiricism and magic. However,the most important boundary that the Magus learns to cross is betweena self immured in pride and others needing comfort. More than the Vir-gin’s miraculous healing of diseased organs and shattered limbs are theacts of solicitude and kindness done by people for their brothers.Huysmans had never felt God’s presence more strongly than when hewitnessed wealthy women leaving home and coming to Lourdes to serveas caregivers and nurses.

The benighted female animal, controlled byignorance and instinct, becomes an intercessor whose suffering allowsher empathy and compassion. This is the occult miracle Huysmans seesdone every day in Lourdes: selfishness fired away in the crucible of pain,then ennobled and transmuted into generosity and service. The occultistjourney, guided by the mystery of suffering, moves from the self intothe street, from introversion to fraternalism. Sharing in the Passion ofthe Savior or in the bereavement of his Mother, the decadent occultistbecomes an adept in the divine alchemy of pain. “After the necessaryperiod of incubation,” as Huysmans writes inLydwine, after self-loveturns to service, “the Great Work is completed.” From the retort of thesoul comes the purity of gold, which Huysmans equates with Love thatcures “despondency and tears.” This is the true Philosopher’s stone,”he writes in a coda to the era:17suffering that ends suffering and inau-gurates the Holy Spirit’s Reign. “Neither shall there be mourning norcrying anymore,” after an elite joins their stricken brothers to completeGod’sworkonearth.Following J.-K. Huysmans in his migration through the rarefied, some-times infernal precincts of fin-de-siècle supernaturalism, this volumebegins by touring the devil’s lair, then visits the austere chamber ofthe Magus, and finally climbs to the celestial plane of miracles andmysticism.In turn-of-the-century France, an encounter with the devil ofteninspired the seeker to begin a quest for the divine. Chapter 1 exploresDecadent Satanism both as an aesthetic and a belief system. Seriousoccultists like Stanislas de Guaïta and Gérard Encausse (Papus) ini-tially dismissed the devil as nothing but a bugbear that appealed todeviants and fools. Jules Bois, in his masterly study of both tradi-tional and modern Satanism, evokes a colorful image of the countrySabbath as an anarchic, rollicking event, yet depicts clandestine BlackMasses celebrated in nineteenth-century churches as despairing, cold,and evil ceremonies inspiring only respectful dread and horror. At thesame time, the devil who captivated artists of the era as an urbanesophisticate emerged as a charmingly wicked reflection of the authorhimself.In an age in which both faith and art had been robbed of majesty byscience, the aesthetics of diabolism were held up as a source of expressiveinnovation. Thus, the mysterious allure of Satanism set in the remote-ness of the Middle Ages, the sacrilegious banality of fin-de-siècle devil"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Introduction13worship, and the rehabilitation of the Evil One as a glamorous avatar ofthe writer are themes explored in an analysis of Huysmans’s bestsellingexposé on Satanism.While Satanism provided material for serious literature, it was alsoperceived as a genuine threat by the church, re-energizing an institu-tion recently demoralized by the ascendancy of reason and materialism.Perpetrated over a number of years, Léo Taxil’s elaborate and masterlyhoax – his invention of the Luciferian cult of Palladism – is the objectof study in Chapter 2. Reconstituting Taxil’s imposture as a source ofpopular entertainment, this examination also describes it as a responseto the prevailing culture of xenophobia and anti-Semitism, and as fuelfor the propaganda campaign waged by Pope Leo XIII, who warns of theevils of Freemasonry in his 1884 encyclical,Humanum Genus.“Emerg-ing from the shadows of an occult conspiracy,” the Freemasons, as Leowarns, had enlisted Satan’s aid in order to separate the interests of thechurch and the state, and to promote “the monstrous systems of theSocialists and Communists.”18As is argued in Chapter 3, the leading esotericists of the day oftensought to distinguish magic, as an initiatic discipline, from necromancy,deemed a refuge for criminals and pariahs. As the aesthetics of Satanismhad promoted an ideal of urbane transgressivity, occultism also pic-tured the Magus as a narcissistic character, a superior, if lonely, being.However, in the works of Stanislas de Guaïta, Gérard Encausse, EdouardSchuré, and Joséphin Péladan, the Magus is shown as learning the virtueof self-sacrifice, mingling with the people whom he edifies.Chapter 3 traces the evolution of the fin-de-siècle thaumaturgeas an adept conversant with the numerological secrets of theKabbalah, the hidden symbolism of the Tarot, the esoteric traditionsof Rosicrucianism. However, the Magus is also depicted as a pedagogueand mentor, obedient to the church, respectful of its doctrine, willing tobestow his privileged knowledge on the people whom he serves.Chapter 4 explores the process by which this ideal of self-abnegationwas carried to the extremes of penitential martyrdom. Explaining thepractice of mystic substitution, whereby the suffering of innocentsredeems the guilt of unrepentant sinners, this chapter reviews thecontroversial and little-known teachings of heretical cultist EugèneVintras. While Vintras began by denouncing the Vatican, excoriating aPontiff regarded as immoderate and self-glorifying, the way in whichVintras’s teachings influenced the generation of fin-de-siècle mysticswas by elevating the poor, stressing the sanctity of human suffer-ing, and according a special status to women as the Lord’s sacrificial"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"14Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francevessels. Touched by Vintras’s precepts, writers like Ernest Hello (Prièreset méditations[Prayers and Meditations]), J.-K. Huysmans (Sainte Lydwinede Schiedam), and Léon Bloy (La Femme pauvre)[The Woman Who wasPoor]) adopted an unusual brand of mysticism predicated on anti-intellectualism, rigorous self-mortification, and an embrace of sufferingallowing the visionary to re-enact the Passion of Christ.The end of the era of Decadence – with its celebration of an aristoc-racy of aesthetes, its apotheosis of an elite of artists and intellectuals –was also accompanied by a renunciation of literature as a forum forprivate and exclusive expression. During the flowering of fin-de-siècleoccultism, what had been the proud solipsism of the Decadent aesthetewas translated first into the hauteur of the Magus with his esoteric wis-dom, and then into the raptures of a saint whose religious visions wereindescribable in the profane idiom of the people. However, as Chapter 5establishes by way of concluding, the fin-de-siècle emergence from thefortress of the self, the mingling of a privileged subject in the throngsof fellow-sufferers signaled the end of occult practices as exclusiveand incommunicable. When Huysmans departed from his sanctuary ofscholarly monasticism and recorded his sojourn at the pilgrimage siteof Lourdes, his chronicle marked a redefinition of turn-of-the-centurysupernaturalism.Non sibi: extraordinary blessings were shared with theunfortunate, secret wisdom was imparted to earnest seekers, miracles,experienced collectively, were performed as good works done on behalfof one’s fellow man. Occultism, ceasing, as is etymologically suggested,to mean knowledge that is hidden, became a gift the initiate henceforthconsented to shower on his brothers."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"1The SatanistPerhaps the most spectacular manifestation of fin-de-siècle supernatu-ralism was the country-wide explosion of reports of the meetings ofsecret cults and the bloody rituals of Satanic societies. So deep wasconcern over the spread of devil worship that the Catholic ChurchpublishedLa Revue du Diable, whose mission was the exposure of clan-destine Satanic practices. Among its targets, a prominent socialite, LucieClaraz, was excommunicated in 1895 for engaging in Satanic activi-ties. Another object of religious and legal sanction, a farmer, Bernard,from the Département of Allier, was convicted as “a sorcerer in scien-tific relations with the Devil,” and sentenced accordingly to six months’imprisonment.1Counterbalancing anxieties over Satanism as a metaphysical threatwas a perception that the devil was an instrument used by impostorsskilled at profiting from popular fascination with supernatural evil. Dis-missed by detractors as scandal-mongering or hysteria, the fad of devilworship was also widely regarded as being sustained by an interest inthe commercial exploitation of the public.In Britain, renowned occultist Alfred Waite characterized France as fer-tile ground for the spread of black magic since it was, as Waite believed,a place where gullibility and superstition flourished. While creditingthe authenticity of J.-K. Huysmans’ssuccès de scandale Là-bas, an 1894exposé of devil worship in contemporary Paris, Waite devotes attentionprimarily to recording instances of imposture, chronicling growing con-cerns over the malignant influence of Freemasonry. Waite focuses inparticular on the origins and history of the Luciferian sect of Palladism,describing at length the paranoid extravagances of Dr. Bataille’sLe Diableau XIXe siècle(The Devil in the Nineteenth Century), a compilation of15"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"16Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francespurious memoirs about Satanism and its rituals, practices occurringfrom Charleston to Ceylon.Serialized in the press, beginning in 1892, and devoured by a publicthat made it one of the decade’s bestsellers, Bataille’s work purports to bethe diary of a ship’s physician recording manifestations of Satanic activ-ity in France and around the world. A sprawling 2,000-page excursusdenigrated by Waite as “a perfervid narrative issued in penny num-bers with illustrations of a highly sensational type,”2Bataille’s book isreplete with colorful anecdotes of the kind that Waite reports: a witchdoctor’s cottage tenanted by a Tamil-speaking ape, the summoning ofBeelzebub that culminates with the emergence of zombie fakirs, “eatento the bone by worms,” dragged out among skeletons “while serpents,giant spiders and toads swarmed from all parts.”3Waite’s dismay isclearly offset by a measure of amusement so that, ultimately, his pan-ning of Bataille has the effect of popularizing an already successfulpopularization.The often-contradictory reactions to Bataille’s treatise on Satanismshow how the issue of devil worship was viewed at the turn of the cen-tury from a surprising variety of perspectives. For serious practitionersof the occult sciences like Waite, the question of the devil’s existencewas primarily a matter of truth or deception. Refusing to judge Bataille’snarrative as entertainment or diversion, Waite argues that the book con-tained no believable miraculous material. It is absurd, Waite asserts, thatapes should talk, in familiar or exotic languages. It is impossible, Waiteremarks about another tale Bataille tells, that a “female pythoness, aged152 years, should allow herself to be consumed in a leisurely mannerby fire.”4Failing to evaluate Bataille’s work on the basis of the pleasureafforded readers, Waite asserts the obvious in dismissing its contents as“transparently fabulous.” “To attribute a historical veracity to the adven-tures of Baron Munchausen might scarcely seem,” Waite summarizes,“more unserious that to accept thisrécit de témoin[eye-witness account]as evidence for transcendental phenomena.”5Lively and protean in popular narrative, the fin-de-siècle Satanbecame repellent and cold in first-hand accounts – like those doc-umented in Huysmans’sLà-bas.Unlike the devil who presided overcontemporary ceremonies – banalized by witnesses’ experiences – theuncertain Satan of folklore was the product of the imagination of thepeople invoking him. From an overview of literature on the fin-de-siècledevil, one sees the being first threatened by science, then assaulted byskepticism, and finally revitalized in art works whose creator worshipedthe devil inhabiting his mind."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The Satanist17Those who disputed the reality of the devil’s existence were motivatedby different concerns. There were the dabblers in the dark arts whowished to avoid criminal prosecution or the threat of excommunica-tion. And there were serious occultists condemned as Satanists or fraudswho therefore sought to uphold the legitimacy of their own study. Thus,a broad confederacy of rationalists, intellectuals, occultists, doctors, andscientists often spoke in similar terms when denying the devil’s exis-tence as a physical being. A psychiatric disorder, a crude appeal to afoolish and credulous public, a symbolic embodiment of the humanpropensity toward cupidity, violence, and lust, the devil was widelydescribed as the product of a primitive and disordered brain.However, the Decadents also intuited that Satanism was not just anissue of fact, and that – more than an entity whose existence wasdemonstrable – the devil was the product of fear and nostalgia. TheSatan who receded into the remoteness of history, who withdrew intothe implausibility and vagueness of folklore, could be summoned forthby those whose creativity cast him in the shape of their desire. As Satanmigrated from the domain of ontology into the realm of fiction andfantasy, he grew in stature, his avatars multiplied, and his majesty wasenhanced by style and artistry.The multifaceted richness of the devil who presided over the fin desiècle is most thoroughly represented in Huysmans’sLà-bas,aworkwhose own genre complexity emerges as one of the story’s underlyingthemes. Part autobiography, part history, part fiction, the novel resem-bles the devil it pictures, showing that what empiricism makes pooris what conjecture enlivens. Huysmans’s lessons are echoed by con-temporaries like his nemesis Stanislas de Guaïta, who also realized theconnection between fantasy and evil. Guaïta may dispute the factualityof Huysmans’s account of a Black Mass seen in Paris, showing himself“anxious to bring a corrective to Huysmans’s affirmations,”6yet in hishistoric overview of sorcery, Guaïta’s anatomy of Satan shows him tobe a rich and complex figure. Guest of honor at midnight Sabbaths, thedevil known asMaître Léonardmutates from a creature the size of a squir-rel into a monstrous goat with twisted horns. With his body emitting “avague fluorescence” that radiates in spirals, pestilential effluvia envelop-ing him in “a pale atmosphere,”7the devil baptizes the Sabbath bridewith urine on a plain lit up by torch-fire. This is a different devil fromthe being who, to modern intellectuals, is only a symbolic embodimentof human ignorance and vice.Following Huysmans, Guaïta traces the evolution of the devil who,from the fearsome Sabbath sovereign, dwindles into a ridiculous"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"18Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Franceanachronism, the Decadent devil characterized as a petty charlatan andpervert. Despite their antipathy for one another, Huysmans and Guaïtawere in agreement that only art could save an Evil One imperiled bysophisticated cynicism. A study of Huysmans’s novel and Guaïta’s his-tory of Satanism discloses the future of the Decadent devil, who, havingvanished from the text of ancient grimoires, emerges on the page of animaginative artist.The devil deniedFor purportedly serious occultists like Papus (Gérard Encausse) andGuaïta, the issue of the devil’s existence first had to be framed in away that credited the morality and authenticity of their own practice.Seeking to counter the slanderous, if comical, characterizations givenby Bataille of Protestants, Buddhists, thaumaturges, and metaphysi-cians held in thrall by malevolent powers, these writers confronted thedilemma of arguing that occult study involved neither diabolism norimposture.Typical of the strategic campaigns of the devil-deniers is Papus’s 1896polemical tractLe Diable et l’Occultisme(The Devil and Occultism). A pro-lific writer, Papus had established his credentials as an occultist withlinks to the French branch of Madame Blavatsky’s Theosophical Soci-ety and the Golden Dawn. Together with Guaïta and Péladan, Papushad founded in Paris the Kabbalist Order of the Rose-Croix, emerg-ing as one of the leading voices in the occult movement of the turnof the century. While characterizing him as leading spokesman for theoccultist movement, Jean Pierrot deprecates Papus’s esoteric knowledge,describing him as a vulgarizer whose learning was broad but often super-ficial: “Largely devoid of original ideas and endowed with only a limitedknowledge of philosophy and literature,”8Papus, in Pierrot’s view, wasnonetheless an influential figure. Author of a study of the Tarot and aninterpretive analysis of the Kabbalah (1892), Papus stood in the fore-front of the disseminators of esoteric teachings who were sensitive toaccusations that occultism and Satanism were synonymous.While Papus begins his book by refuting the most preposterous ofBataille’s allegations, he further issues a challenge to Positivists fordenying the authenticity of the supernatural, and to Catholics for stig-matizing occultists for their heterodox beliefs. A regrettable by-productof the triumph of empiricism, for Papus, was the enthronement ofirreligion and materialism. Conversely, Papus argues, in cultivating anti-intellectualism, the church had rejected the good offices of its natural"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Satanist19allies. Whereas “[o]ccultists sought to bring back France’s intellectualelite to a belief in the Beyond and in the existence of an immanentjustice,”9the Catholic hierarchy had attacked hermeticists for linkingreligion to the practice of diabolism. Blamed by both sides, occultists likePapus had been forced to counter claims made by scientists that magicevidenced no more than megalomania and delusion, while disprovingallegations made by sensationalists like Bataille that any unorthodoxpractice entailed paying obeisance to Lucifer. “People accuse magiciansin vain of these preposterous designs; Satanism and Magic stand atopposite poles, and only several generations of scientists will be able torestore them to their rightful place in the field of human knowledge.”10Used as a forum for self-exonerating clarification, Papus’s bookdevotes little attention to Satanic ritual and belief. Fearing to be asso-ciated with Bataille’s commercial ambitions, Papus retreats to the moreintellectually defensible position of characterizing diabolism as theabsence of God. As Papus reasons, the devil is no more than anabstention from virtuous action, blindness to the divinity at work inCreation. Scientists, church leaders, occultists like Papus all illustrate theapothegm that the devil’s greatest triumph is to convince the faithful hedoes not exist. Like the psychiatrist who diagnoses Satanism as hysteria,the occultist equates the devil with the inoperativeness of God’s will.“There is no personal Devil in the ordinary sense of the word. The beingmystically referred to as the Devil is the negation or the opposite ofGod. God is Light, Truth, Order, and Harmony. Consequently, the Devilis darkness, deceit, discord, and ignorance.”11In Papus’ sensible assertion, one sees foreshadowed the impendingfate of the Decadent devil – put to death by the enlightened pronounce-ments of medicine, marginalized by occultists stressing the delusionalselfishness of devil worship. Similarly, in his apprentice manual,Com-ment on devient mage(How One Becomes a Magus), Joséphin Péladandenies the reality of spell-casting and necromancy. He deprecates theefficacy of sorcerers’ violence, impugns the credibility of the vision-ary prophet Eugène Vintras, and mocks Huysmans for engaging in anexchange of spells with his enemies. Huysmans’s occultist/mentor, AbbéBoullan, referred to as Doctor Johannes inLà-bas, stands in relationto Huysmans, his acolyte/protégé, Péladan says, as would “a propheticTartuffe in face of a mystical Orgon.”12With his apocryphal Chaldean ancestry, his vatic bombast, flowingtoga, and prodigious beard, Sâr Péladan emerged as the most contro-versial and flamboyant of the Decadent occultists.

For Péladan, evil is manifested as anunquestioning acquiescence to the values of militarism, nationalism,and materialism. In Péladan’s view, the devil is not witnessed at BlackMasses. Instead, Satan’s temple is thecafé-concert, the newspaper office,the gambling den, the brothel, or the racetrack.Péladan also dismisses the authenticity of black magic, which he char-acterizes as social or mental pathology. “Keep this in mind, my disciple,”he admonishes a follower, “that sorcery comes from an exaltation of ner-vous energies among people who are at once believers and criminals.”13Rather than learning secret techniques for the manipulation of objects,the Adept achieves mastery through the exercise of self-control. While,in his fiction, Péladan ascribes to his Magus-hero a host of impressiveoccult abilities – chiromancy, magnetism, anesthetic insufflations, div-ination, astral travel – to his student, Péladan insists that such powersare fake. Adopting the reductionist idiom of science, Péladan claims thatsupernatural evil is only criminal imposture: “Those claiming to be sor-cerers are simply thieves and murderers, magnetizers of people unawareof their own guilt, spiritualists, all of whom suffer from a form of mentalalienation.”14As Decadence augurs the extinction of Occidental culture, the fin-de-siècle devil is similarly an endangered entity, threatened with anni-hilation by doctors and skeptics, reduced to the burlesque antics ofswindlers and imbeciles. But, as Decadence reassigned value fromknowledge to beauty, engaging less in truth-seeking and more in aes-thetics, the Decadent devil migrated from the realm of religion andsensational literature to art. Rejecting the capering caricature of tabloidaccounts, the Decadents relocated the devil to the iconography ofhistory.The people’s devilIn Decadent fiction – in fin-de-siècle treatises on occult tradition – thedevil is most animated, most implausible and entertaining when heappears in folktales, legendary accounts, and popular stories of inde-terminate provenance.

Bois’s floridly exuberant image of the traditionaldevil gives way to the descriptive poverty of the contemporary Satan:“As soon as the Black Mass moves from the open air into a church, itbecomes hypocritical and refined, losing the grandeur which came fromits essentially human element.”15Like the readers of Dr. Bataille’s fanci-ful narrative, Bois yearns for the devil who justifies descriptive excess, aSatan as picturesque as the language that celebrates him.Bois’s own writing alternates between naturalism’s detached neutral-ity, clinical analyses of scenes like those Huysmans witnessed, andrevelry that abandons all pretense of objectivity, as when he picturesa Sabbath at a forest crossroads or in a moonlit cemetery. On an earlywinter evening, hordes of malcontents and pariahs aspirated up chim-neys climb on goats or straddle broomsticks and set off across theland. No embittered aristocrats or intellectual cynics flood the lividback roads of the country at night, but a ragtag gang of freaks andgrotesqueries: “gypsies, peasants, vagrants, jugglers, false clerics,”16spec-imens not offered hospitality in respectable literature. The rural SabbathBois pictures is part Miracle Fair, part circus, and features mounte-banks and exhibitors of dancing bears: showmen skilled in amusingan audience like Bataille’s: “everything needed to delight the people’sfoolishness.”17Uncircumscribable because unseen, the devil is a collective projectionof his worshippers, misshapen like hunchbacks, ridiculous like idiots.Bois’s devil also animates the gamut of the medieval bestiary, assum-ing the theriomorphic richness of anathema and fancy. Wolves, toads,and roosters, basilisks, and serpents, symbols of perfidy, bodies of dis-gust, creep, and yelp, and crow. Bois’s ceremony involves a universalconfusion, a commingling of opposites, a collapsing of dichotomies.Metaphors regress to meanings and the objects that they signify. Thevulpine treachery of witches reconverts them into foxes, and gender dif-ferences are obliterated by indiscriminate copulation: “the sorcerer andsorceress, in their intimacy, become one.”18Taboos normally structuring a world of antinomy and separation areviolated as corpses are disinterred from their resting places in grave-yards, and engage, not in the coupling of Decadent Luciferianism, butin carrion banquets consecrating incest and necrophagia.

Corpses undressed of shrouds are dismembered bytheir pillagers. Their intestines are devoured or are saved for later use asingredients in kitchens or “the den of alchemists.”19Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel, in her analysis of Devil Religion, linksperversions like incest, bestiality, and necrophilia to a metaphysi-cal objective to undo divine creation, recreating original chaos fromwhich new worlds can be fashioned. Judeo-Christian interdictions onintercourse with children, on mating with animals, on breaking bodyboundaries are violated so that everything coalesces and blends together.In Bois’s picture of the country Sabbath, disorder reigns supreme. Wordsare retransformed into referents like stomachs reconverted into food.As Chasseguet-Smirgel suggests: “perversion represents a magical pro-cess aimed at a return to the state of indistinction, a manifestation ofhubris, of man’s desire to discredit the Father-Creator, and to shape anew reality from chaos.”20Bois’s picture of the Sabbath is one where anything can happen andwhere anything can be said. It authorizes a liberation from rote thinkingand bland expression. At the Sabbath, Schopenhauerian pessimists aregladdened by reawakened possibility. Touched by Pan’s scepter, “everysick or melancholic human being reels blissfully to the beat of thecosmic dance.”21Representations of the Decadent devil are more colorful and animatedwhen they are oriented along an axis of retrospection and nostalgia.Take the moribund Satan soon to be euthanized by science, the devilneutered by the imaginative sterility of his followers, and dress himin his erstwhile glory, in the multifariousness of the absurd. Infinitein the inchoateness of worlds still unmade, he is greater than a Godconstrained by the singularity of his Creation.Bois himself asserts the regenerative potential of Satanic metanoia.Under the rubric of Criminal and Scientific Excuses for the Sabbath,he cites the fecundating benefits of disassembly and undoing. Like thenineteenth-century anarchists intent on assassinating presidents, onsubverting social institutions, and exploding received ideas – seekingto re-establish atabula rasaundefiled by law or government – Satanistssow confusion, throw “the bombs of their evil spells.”22Driven, not bya hope in social engineering, but by ontological despair, they seek to ridthe universe of what Bois calls “that human leprosy.”23More beautifulthan the building blocks of creation unbegun is the wreckage of an oldworld reduced to broken limbs and rubble.

But whereas the Positivist heralds man’s progress towardenlightened self-knowledge, the devil-worshipper practices scienceàrebours, seeing “man’s origins as an animal, his reversion to the statusof animal, whose instincts he retains and with whom he maintains anaffinity.”25For the anarchist who burns with ideological intransigence,for the writer outraged by the senescence of his art, “Satan is the greatrevolutionary working doggedly to transform creation.”26The Decadent devilIn fictional representations of the fin de siècle, the heroic, triumphant,demiurgic Satan of folklore has largely disappeared, replaced by a devilmirroring the Decadent himself. In J.-K. Huysmans’s critical essay onFélicien Rops, nostalgia for the exuberant devil of popular narrative isevident in the author’s praise for the erotica of Thomas Rowlandson.On the one hand, the devil is eclipsed by his priestess, “the terrible faunof Lust,”27who excites the writer’s misogynistic loathing. Huysmanscharacterizes the demoness as “a fornication machine,” recalling the“medieval concept of woman as aninstrumentum diaboli.”28On theother hand, evidence of Huysmans’s sexual anxieties are offset by hisenthusiasm for Rowlandson’s picture of “a surprising uproar of ruttingcrowds,”29an image recalling Bois’s depiction of the country Sabbath.Instigated by a devil who is either a participant or a witness, thisdebauchery evokes a Satanism that is riotous and festive – far removedfrom the devil worship Huysmans chronicles inLà-bas, where thecelebrants are old and worn, pathetic and hysterical.Bois’s image of the jubilance of the open-air Black Sabbath suggeststhe retrospective yearning of the Decadents, whose sins are unenthu-siastic and cerebral, who rarely couple in the moonlight but cultivateperversions of the mind. Huysmans seemingly deplores his contem-poraries’ intellectualized transgressions, and despite denying that vicebelongs to the realm of medical investigation, he still classes mor-bid delectation as both a sin and a disorder: “Cerebral erethism, saysscience.”30What, in Bois, had been the implied homology between the devil andhis worshippers becomes more overt in Huysmans’s picture of fin-de-siècle evil, where lassitude, cynicism, arrogance, and ennui replace therobust loins and sweaty bodies seen in Rowlandson."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"24Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FranceIt is in Rops’s work that Huysmans finds the weary Satanism of theDecadence – where the devil is personified as “a gentleman in a blacksuit.”31The work of the Belgian painter heralded by Huysmans andadmired by Péladan was most responsible for establishing the fashionof Satanism in pictorial art. The Satan of the Middle Ages, symbolized asthe zoomorphy of man’s sins – the surreptitiousness of cats, the lecheryof goats – gives way in Rops to a debonair devil, ironic and disabused.According to Huysmans, in Rops’s watercolors, the devil is subordi-nated to a Lust Goddess, as man’s prurience is projected as the objectthat inspires it. Rops’s pictures suggest Decadent ambivalence about evil,locating sin in the devil, in man, and in the woman who arouses him.The terrible energies and infernal glory that were the appanage of Luciferare re-gendered and resituated in the fin-de-siècle Sataness.In “L’Enlèvement” (The Kidnapping), Rops harkens back to his ownart’s antecedents – showcasing, not the urbane devil resplendent in for-mal dress, but a more traditional embodiment of instinctuality andsatyriasis. The elements of Rops’s painting, reproduced in detail inHuysmans’s commentary, recall Bois’s crossroads Sabbath pullulatingwith monsters from nightmares. The lushness of Huysmans’s wordpainting suggests the critic’s excitation, as his imagination is disengagedfrom the picture he is contemplating and, unmoored, sets off in reverieabout rituals of bygone eras. At the Sabbath, Huysmans imagines natu-ral life forms all commingling: the mandrake root, valued as a narcoticand aphrodisiac which – with its resemblance to the human form –symbolizes a phylogenetic interface, “the point where vegetable andanimal kingdoms meet, as Madame Blavatsky would observe.”32Toxicbeverages brewed from henbane, from selenaceous plants, philtres com-posed of menstrual blood, cats’ brains, hyenas’ bellies, orgies devolvinginto infanticide and sodomy show the overflow of Huysmans’s text fromthe picture he is analyzing.In Rops, the devil as a male figure is increasingly decentered. Like thebeliever who, in the fin de siècle, is marginalized by science, the devil isthreatened by rationalism, subordinated to the demoness. Huysmans’smeditations on Rops’s art express Decadent insecurities about the obso-lescence of the aristocracy, the discrediting of religion, the emasculationof men by the virago and the gynander.

The germinating force that promotes a harvest isnot male seed but thelarves de femmeshe shakes out of his apron.In Huysmans’s response to Rops’s painting, the devil is nochameleonic figure assuming the face and form of the people whoinvoke him. He is the proleptic incarnation of the Decadents’ dyingfaith, their belief that when science kills religion, the devil will accom-pany it. While he towers over the city, the devil is ancient and emaci-ated, planting his skeletal legs over the unsuspecting populace. Whilethe devil is the past – Decadent evil wasted into an osseous frame offutility – the future is the seed of women from which lust and evil spring.In Huysmans’s essay, Satan is eclipsed by the Harlot of Revelation, “thepoisonous, naked Beast, mercenary of the Darkness, the absolute serf ofthe Devil.”33Huysmans’s writing confirms the aphorism that the devil exists, thatSatan is strong, only to the extent that power is accorded him by man.Huysmans’s gynephobic rhetoric identifies Decadent anxieties that manis most susceptible to evil’s blandishments when they are embodied inwoman.Finally, in “Sphynx,” evil’s transitivity is evidenced by the devil-woman, as Satan is a just caricature of the ineffectual fin-de-siècle male,only able to reap the harvest of sin planted by his female counterpart.Sidling up to a Sphinx frozen in the hieratic dignity of centuries, a nakedwoman whispers, urging it to reveal its timeless secrets. On the otherside, a monocle-wearing Satan waits passively to hear the informationhe is powerless to extract. Huysmans’s appreciation of Rops’s work mayconvey the author’s anti-feminism, but it also shows the writer’s senseof the shrunken majesty of Satan.

Apart from the issue of Huysmans’s narrative verac-ity, his interest is in opposing the pageantry of medieval Satanismand the perfunctory sacrilegiousness of a contemporary Parisian BlackMass. The drabness of the nineteenth-century devil is a projection ofSatanists and their literary investigators – as inglorious and banal astheir sense of themselves. The devil called forth at Canon Docre’s BlackMass reflects a fin-de-siècle worldview laundered of mystery. BecauseHuysmans’s protagonist despises his countrymen’s venality, he seesSatan and his partisans as petty and mean: a renegade priest wearingonly black socks under his chasuble, pederast choirboys, their cheekscaked with make-up, the devil no more than an impossible symbol ofmaterialism.Because what Durtal witnesses is a dismally ordinary ceremony – ugly,common, blasphemous, and profane – the physical reality of the devilis never at issue. On the other hand, because Gilles’s Satan is unascer-tainably distant, he gains in prestige, grandeur, and mystery. As Gilles’sslaughter of children becomes more compulsive and nightmarish – as hefills his sepulcher-dungeons with skeletons and peoples the landscapewith mothers weeping for their lost sons – the devil for whom this trib-ute is paid becomes more frightening and real. Because the historicalrecord of this Satan is partial, the contemporary imagination finishes apicture that is at once gripping and vivid.On the night the devil is summoned by a sorcerer in Gilles’s employ,the Maréchal and another magician stand transfixed at the door, listen-ing to the imprecations and howls that come from inside. And whenthe cacophony subsides and they enter, they find only the victim’smangled limbs and crushed head. The marauding Satan of fifteenth-century Normandy is as boundless as his worshippers’ imaginativepowers.InLe Temple de Satan(Satan’s Temple) Stanislas de Guaïta also com-ments on the compromised prestige ofle Satan fin-de-siècle– a bogeymaneliciting hilarity and ridicule. If not consigned to non-existence, thenineteenth-century Prince of Darkness is more hesitant to reveal himselfto scoffers and unbelievers. As Guaïta writes: “these days, the Demonshows some reluctance to manifest himself in person to an irreverentpublic, capable of laughing in his face, if he were to show it.”35Born in 1861 into a noble Italian family, Guaïta had first begun hisresearch into esotericism as a student in Nancy, where he had taken upa study of metaphysics and the Kabbalah. Guaïta’s own interest in dia-bolism had taken him from youthful attempts at versifying on Satanic"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Satanist27themes to an immersion in the writings of Eliphas Lévi. Independentlywealthy and therefore free to devote himself to esoteric research, Guaïtahad steeped himself in theosophy and magic, acquiring an impressivebreadth of knowledge. Freed by his personal wealth from suspicions ofcharlatanism, Guaïta had offered his home as a gathering place for theprominent esotericists of the day, successfully advancing himself as thedeepest and most erudite thinker of the occultist movement.Despite Guaïta’s effort to establish his credentials as an historian ofmagic, he still devotes a long chapter inLe Temple de Satanto under-scoring the sorry predicament of a devil reduced to the predatorymachinations and opportunism of a pervert. Citing a recent work bythe magisterially named Chevalier Gougenot des Mousseaux, Guaïtarefers back to transcribed accounts of a recent manifestation by thedevil. Seventeen young girls of problematic virtue had been persuadedto summon a stranger to their sexual frolics. Called forth by a maleacquaintance reading from Albertus Magnus, a bon vivant of attractivemien had appeared inexplicably in the room. The devil, Guaïta writes,“had that day the face of a young man in his thirties, wearing a suit of anelegant cut, and having no more and no fewer claws than any flirtatiouswoman.”36The narrative recording the devil’s 11-year liaison with one of thegirls is followed by another story of his appearance at a séance, wherehe caused the skirts of buxom ladies to balloon and rise immodestly,and where he had touched them above the knee, as the chevalier writesdiscreetly.More than the drollery of Guaïta’s tales, the tone with whichhe tells them conveys the modern devil’s plight, his displacementby nineteenth-century nymphomaniacs, his expedient incarnations asdeviants and roués.Guaïta concurs with Papus in assigning Satan certain impersonal,abstract qualities. Responding to the atheist who claims the devil man-ifests himself to the feebleminded, materializing in the fog of sicklyimaginations. Guaïta echoes Papus in denying the existence ofun Diablepersonnel[a personal Devil]. Embodying the defects of the gullible, Satan,as Guaïta reasons, “in his metaphysical form is Error, in his psychic formis Egotism, and in his perceptible form is Ugliness.”37The bulk of Guaïta’s treatise consists of a history of religious myth,a cultural anthropology of postlapsarian evil.

Guaïta’sessay marks the convergence of Decadent aesthetics and epistemology,where Truth-as-Beauty displaces the despairing lessons of empiricism.For Guaïta, the dabbler in necromancy, the Magus-dilettante may beseduced by the arcane imagery and mystery of Satanism. Occasionaltourists in the realm of devil worship, they may be captivated by art’sshimmer, but “they limit themselves to the superficial picturesquenessof the grimoire; their teeth bite only into the skin of the forbiddenfruit.”40Papus, Guaïta, Péladan, all self-styled occult masters, admonish thecasual seeker to abandon his vain quest. The paradox of these propadeu-tic manuals of occult science is that they beckon the initiate and warnthe curious away. The unique character of Decadent magic is to combinetitillation and frustration, to offer the forbidden fruit that ultimately iswithheld. It is like all of Decadent art that tempts with the sparkle ofillusion, entrancing audiences with the incantatory beauty of its lan-guage while concealing what lies beneath, either mysterious truths ornothingness.Guaïta identifies the devil operating in fin-de-siècle art as the principleof cunning, immorality, and nihilism. Invoking Baudelaire, founder ofthe poetics of nineteenth-century evil, Guaïta describes the poisonousblooms growing on the edge of the abyss, flowers that adorn the ravinewall and lead up to the pit. Heedless infatuation with black magic maylead the artist to perdition: “There is a fantastically ideal quality even inthe mystery of abomination that has captivated people in all times.”41The poetry of evil is spoken by the Great Seducer.

The devil’s dominion is apparent in the prevalence of cynicism,in the loss of what Baudelaire calledconsciousness in acts of evil.ForGuaïta, the effects of the inflexible logic of Goetia are recognizable “asthe progressive loss of man’s moral sense, as the proselytizing powerof the negative philosophies of free will.”42What Péladan heraldedas the approaching end of western civilization –la décadence latine–is the blasé fashion of transgression, casual vices indulged by Rops’smonocle-wearing gentleman.Guaïta discerns the devil’s influence in the voguishness of Buddhism:the consecration of the individual’s dissolution of the self, the equationof abulia with the ecstasy of ego-death, a celebration of “the suicideof one’s true personality.”43The perversion of religion whose practicesare misconstrued, the confusion of weakness and passivity with Nirvanashow the workings of the Evil One at the turning of the century.Materialism, skepticism, immorality, unbelief – supernatural evil evi-denced as a denial of the supernatural – lead Guaïta to idealize thenaïveté of past centuries, to long for a restoration of magic practiced, notby wizards, but by children. In a catalogue of supernatural horrors com-mitted through the ages, Guaïta concludes with an apostrophe to theperson who regaled him with fairy tales: “Grandmother, tell us anotherstory of the olden times.”44An unusual feature of the fin de siècle, this overlapping of fantasyand esotericism shows the Decadents’ competing interest in occult sci-ences and folklore. The romanticizing of childhood, the privileging ofimagination over knowledge, pervades the fin de siècle and explains theDecadent nostalgia for the past. In Huysmans’s preference for the Mid-dle Ages over the aridity of his century, in Jean Lorrain’s evocation of thefolktales recounted by his cook (Princesses d’ivoire et d’ivresse[Princesses ofivory and intoxication]), in Marcel Schwob’s account of Monelle and hernomadic band of waifs, searching for the White Kingdom of comfortinguntruths, the Decadents display their love of innocence, their detesta-tion of truth and fact. The Decadents are like the little girls nestling byMonelle around a campfire: “They wished for nothing more than perpet-ual unawareness. They wanted to devote themselves eternally to games.The work of life brought them despair. For them, there was nothing butthe past.”45"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"30Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FranceWhat else is Decadent diabolism with its pentacles and grimoiresthan a rejection of truth and work, than a re-enactment of childhoodgames?

Havingestablished his credentials as an historian of esotericism, Guaïta endshis book by citing the benefits of unknowing. Schwob’s proscriptionagainst self-awareness (“Know thyself not”)46is echoed by Guaïta in thetribute to his grandmother, who had spoken “the hereditary languageof the unintelligent.”47A castaway on the beach of Decadent rational-ism “where the waves of this brutal century wash up,”48the Decadentssought oases of miracles and horrors, in stories of Sleeping Beauty oraccounts of witches’ Sabbaths.At the conclusion of Guaïta’s volume, there comes a conspicuous shiftin emphasis: from the historical, moral, and epistemological characterof Satanism to Satanism as narrative and the strength of audience recep-tion. Guaïta aligns himself with others of his contemporaries for whomthe devil assumes reality as a function of his remoteness and the descrip-tive virtuosity of the authors recreating him. Since, inLà-bas,Durtalassembles the devil from archival debris, the evil he imagines is morecreatively compelling than the evil he experiences. Similarly, in Bois’soverview of necromantic ritual, Satan is more eloquent, more enter-taining, and believable at open-air Sabbaths featuring sorceresses anddead babies. Even when engaging in the controversy over Satanism, theDecadents countered science less with arguments from religion – lesswith defenses of the legitimacy of occultism – than with the iridescenceof their style. As Guaïta comments, “Art also has its magic – shadowy orsplendid, beneficial or deadly.”49In the works of Eliphas Lévi, the century’s greatest popularizer ofhermeticism, authors are celebrated as belonging to a sacerdotal brother-hood, whose language reinforces the operational power of theLogos.Itis“the creative Word that constitutes man’s true resemblance to God.”50One can easily imagine the writer’s profanation of art’s purpose, mag-nifying, not God’s work, but the expressive cleverness of his epigone.In the wheedling tone of Satan-Panthée, Guaïta hears an echo of thewriter’s voice. Reflected in the weeping face of Satan, as Bois imag-ines him, is the wretched likeness of the outcasts and criminals whovenerate him.The final perversion of doxology seen in Guaïta’s book on Satanism isthe encomium he directs, not to God, but to the storyteller.

In preferring arti-fice to nature, “this mirror of divinity,” the artist engages in a narcissisticadoration of the image. When eurhythmy and grace no longer celebratethe Creator, art abjures its sacred purpose and becomes a form of taboomagic. “Substituting the discordancy of individuals’ evil intentions forthe wise harmony of general laws,” art, as Guaïta argues, “becomesSatanic in its ugliness.”51In the Decadents’ cult of the individual, in their practice of art forart’s sake – in privileging the image over the rightness of a principle –Decadent art risks degenerating into self-worship and iconolatry. Whenthe Satan of Decadent literature no longer inspires respectful horror butbecomes, as in Bataille’s book, a figure of curiosity and amusement, thedevil inhabits authors as their self-satisfied insouciance. This is the posi-tion taken by writers like Guaïta, who still contest the physical reality ofSatan. When the response to Huysmans’sLà-basis skyrocketing salesand increased fame, Satan manifests himself in the materialism andvanity Huysmans professed to despise.In their treatment of Satanism, the Decadents were pulled in twodirections, pandering, on the one hand, to public hunger for sensation-alism, disseminating, on the other hand, information on the meaningof occult teachings. Papus may strike a doctoral tone when he describesthe devil as Non-being, but the Satan who thrived in the literature andpictorial art of the fin de siècle existed more intensely as the vividnessof the image.In Denis de Rougemont’s 1944 work,La Part du diable(The Devil’sShare), he characterizes the appeal of creative work as fundamentallydiabolical: “In truth the will to create, the need to write [...] coin-cides deep down with the Luciferian temptation: to become like God,to make oneself an author, to authorize oneself in an autonomousworld.”52Along with pursuing the demiurgic project to compete withGod as a creator, the Decadents neglected the idea in preference to itsexpression. Shifting emphasis from God’s domain of material realityand moral values to the human realm of artifice and stylistic inge-nuity, they succumbed to the devil’s lure and began to worship whatthey fashioned. This, as C. G. Wallis writes in a review of Rougemont’sbook, is the “dialectical diabolism” inherent in the act of writing:“to forget the thought in developing the image or trope in which itmust be expressed, to lose sight of what is signified and see only thesymbol one is using.”53A clever thought that teaches nothing, a gra-tuitously elegant turn of phrase: these are demon spawn, the artist’soffspring, a father’s pride.

It is the art work whose progenitor loves the devil ashimself.J.-K. Huysmans’sLà-basThe establishment of the Decadent devil as a product of the creativeimagination – a projection of the artist who worshipped Satan as hiswork – can be traced back to the conditions in which turn-of-the-century diabolism flourished. Repelled by the explanatory aridity ofscientific methodology, the Decadents rejected a model of the world asa cold, inhuman mechanism and proclaimed instead the existence ofmysteries not susceptible to any analytical elucidation.It was against this backdrop of epistemological discord and philosoph-ical strife that fin-de-siècle authors began recording instances of Satanicactivity, as they sought to confirm the veracity of supernatural phenom-ena and justify their awarding the devil a special place in their worksof art. In 1887, renowned psychiatrist Jean-Martin Charcot had com-plained that in contemporary art, manifestations of hysterical neurosiswere presented, not as illness, “but as a perversion of the soul due tothe presence of the demon.”54In response, J.-K. Huysmans, in his pref-ace to Jules Bois’sLe Satanisme et la magie, denounced the shortcomingsof psychology in explaining genuine manifestations of evil. Whereas, inearlier centuries, as Huysmans elaborates, “demonologists had confusedcertain hysterical episodes with Satanic phenomena,” in the present day,“doctors attribute to hysteria incidents that belong more properly to thedomain of the exorcist.”55Huysmans argues that, in an effort to distinguish the insane fromthose possessed by the devil, medicine had adopted an absolutist pos-ture and, in so doing, had blinded itself to incontrovertible evidence ofSatanic activity.In support of his assertion, Huysmans furnishes numerous accountsof desecrated sanctuaries, sacrificial murders, sacrilegious acts: the 1891assassination of a Trappist monk, the violation of Notre-Dame de Parisby an unnamed woman who had absconded with two ciboria contain-ing consecrated hosts. According to Huysmans, thefts of the Eucharisthad spread to the four corners of the country: “In la Nièvre, in leLorient, in l’Yonne, tabernacles had been forced open and the Eucharistseized.”56Since no ascertainable financial motive could be found forthese transgressions, Huysmans concluded that they could have onlybeen an attack on Christ’s body and that the stolen hosts were intendedfor use in works of black magic."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Satanist33By the time that Huysmans prepared his comments for the pref-ace to Bois’s book, his name had already been indissolubly linkedto contemporary Satanic practices. The notoriety Huysmans garneredfrom the publication ofLà-bashad gained the attention of writersthroughout Europe, including occultist Alfred Waite, who cites exten-sively from Huysmans’s text as evidence of the rise of devil worshipin France. Describing Huysmans as “the discover of Modern Satanism,”Waite proclaims: “Under the thinnest disguise of fiction, he gives in hisromance ofLà-bas, an incredible and untranslatable picture of sorcery,sacrilege, black magic, and nameless abominations, secretly practicedin Paris.”57Seeking to establish a parallel in nineteenth-century Paris withmedieval Satanism and the atrocities committed by the legendary Gillesde Rais, Huysmans had learned of the exploits of Abbé Louis van Haecke,prototype for the figure of Canon Docre inLà-bas,acharismaticfigurewho reportedly had confided his knowledge of devil worship during theauthor’s visit to Belgium. Beginning in 1889, Huysmans’s acquaintancewith Joseph-Antoine Boullan, successor to Eugène Vintras, the mysticprophet and founder of L’Ordre de la Miséricorde [the Order of Mercy],had also afforded the writer access to a secret world of necromantic prac-tices. Huysmans had become embroiled in warfare with another secretfaction led by occultists Oscar Wirth and Stanislas de Guaïta. Already,in 1887, the two had collaborated in writing an exposé denouncingthe master’s arcane doctrine. Wirth, having professed admiration forBoullan and gained his confidence, had betrayed Vintras’s successor,while Guaïta had accused Boullan of engaging in “adultery, incest andbestiality,” of promoting the practice of “incubism and onanism.”58After appointing themselves Boullan’s judges and pronouncing sum-mary judgment, the two set about enforcing the sentence of death. Theoccult warfare between the rival camps had been ongoing for two yearswhen Huysmans first made contact with the controversial cleric. Soonthereafter he found himself involved in a mystic battle of spells andcounter-spells, during which he complained of being attacked by hos-tile spirits emanating from the astral plane, feeling himself beleagueredby invisible forces, experiencing hallucinations that affected both theauthor and his cat.Huysmans’s successful entrée into the forbidden world of nineteenth-century Satanism had earned him the fame and money he dep-recated, sometimes unconvincingly, in his novel.

This was a devilwho, to Huysmans, consecrated a value system and advanced a percep-tion of reality that seemed patterned on positions held by Positiviststhemselves.Indeed, inLà-bas, the first mention of diabolic influence comes in acomment on the nature of capital, whose capacity for self-multiplicationis seen as monstrous and infernal. To Huymans’s protagonist and alter-ego, Durtal, money contaminates its user, perverting its function as asymbol, and occulting the physical reality it overvalues and replaces.Possessions, hyper-invested because of their temporary renunciation,become more desirable, more entangling because they are unavail-able. The most modest and virtuous pauper, undefiled by attachments,comes by money and then is tainted by greed that thrives on disposses-sion. Unlike language, sublimating reality into beauty and significance,money does not purify the world by ridding it of objects. Instead,by abstracting material reality into value, price, and number, moneyexacerbates consumers’ hunger for the things for which it substitutes.In Huysmans, money talks, and the things it takes away are madepresent by covetousness whose eloquence is diabolical.An examination of the link between the evolution of Huysmans’sfaith, the post-naturalist novel’s movement toward greater purity ofexpression, and the triumph of Christian mysticism over the influenceof the devil reveals the effects that Satanism had both on Huysmans’sfiction and religion. Whereas the devil claims to reward the poor withpleasures and possessions, it is the Catholic artist’s work that lifts himout of the realm of sensuality. Not promising material satisfactionbut matter’s transmutation into intelligence, divinely inspired creationbecomes, in Huysmans’s later works, the true instrument of redemption.However, following other fin-de-siècle figures for whom art itselfbecame Satanic, Huysmans’s characters had to learn the dangers ofdiabolical aestheticism. Captivated by the beauty of the artifacts he fash-ioned, the artist risked succumbing to the sterile worship of himself astheir creator. Only when the work was recognized as a means of commu-nion with an audience could the writer escape the cult of self and resumehis true task, producing art that enlisted readers in the magnification ofthe Creator."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Satanist35Satanism and materialismFrom the beginning ofLà-bas, Huysmans’s protagonist intuits that thedevil manifests himself as the human tendency toward iconolatry:the writer’s adoration of his text, the materialist’s enslavement to hiswealth – attachments that turn the sinner from an appreciation of thedivine and encourage his obsession with objects that are acquired ormanufactured. The worship of false gods brings no happiness or satis-faction, as Durtal realizes in his rumination on the Midas touch. A poorman’s house whose cleanness is evidenced by its vacancy, is soiled – asis his soul – when it is affected by acquisitiveness. Vice, which had beenstarved of opportunities for indulging it, is fed by money, which Durtalcalls “the greatest nutrient imaginable for sins.”59Despite replacingobjects, money sustains an economy of self-replenishing materialism.The parthenogenetic agent of its rebirth, “it breeds all alone in a bankvault.”60Huysmans, whose artistic ideal was of bodies spiritualized into noth-ingness, was appalled by money’s fecundity, its ability to fuel material-ism. As Durtal reasons, “either money, as master of the soul, is diabolicalor it is impossible to explain.”61Despite their affiliation with warring camps, the occultist Papusshared the view Huysmans imputes to Durtal: that Satan inspired theunbeliever’s cult of money: “On earth, the Adversary’s true priest is theatheist-materialist, for whom all spiritual forces manifest a mental weak-ness tending toward mysticism. The ascendancy of these people, whobelieve in nothing but the need to satisfy their appetites in any waypossible, will be characterized by a cult of force and violence consideredas the only law, by a love of money considered as the only good.”62Implicitly, Huysmans treats money like language, as a symbolic sys-tem endowed with magic power. Yet Huysmans’s experience of Satanismis that, like money, it reversed the power of literature – and that, asa counter-aesthetic – it re-embodied what artistic intelligence enno-bled. Unlike Grünewald’s Christ, whose crucified flesh is converted intoradiant spirit, the Satanist’s tormented soul refocuses him on worldlypleasures. Huysmans’s eschatological art proclaims the coming of theParaclete, its succeeding the era of the agony of the Redeemer incarnate.As history’s confusion yields to fiction’s order, so space will be evacuatedof succubi and larvae, and the world will be transfused with divine glory,love, and light.After Zola’s opus, whose effect “had been to turn literature into anembodiment of materialism,”63will come the intermediate epoch of"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"36Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle France“naturalisme spiritualiste” (Spiritual Naturalism). This will pave the wayfor the supersession of all art, made obsolete in a messianic time ofmystical inexpressiveness. Then, Durtal believes, there will be no moreformulaic adultery novels, no more stories of sex and madness. Thenwriters and consumers, once separated by the book, will be able toexperience the transparency of communicating face to face.In Durtal’s analysis of the diabolical toxicity of capital, he refers tomoney as the exchange medium for the forsaken and dispossessed.Whereas Durtal characterizes capital as an obese idol squatting in theshrine of the cash box, Canon Docre vilifies Jesus as the “favorite vassalof the banks.”64What, for Durtal, is an investor’s god, a trickster turningcommodities into banknotes, is identified by Docre as Christ, the lackeyof the rich. Docre accuses Jesus of violating the spirit of the covenant,offering his disciples only the counterfeit currency of misery: “You wereto have redeemed man, and You have not. You were to appear in Yourglory, and instead You sleep.”65In Docre’s lexicon of blasphemy, redemption means conversion intocash, worshipping a devil who endows the penniless with wealth. Durtaldespises money as an illusory instrument of happiness, seeming toempty the world of forbidden objects and desires but in reality onlyhiding them behind a “black veil” of the word “capital.” For Durtal,capitalism is materialism without matter, an ideology all the morevirulent because it conceals the object of worship. Unlike language,which destroys the things it resurrects as meaning, money is fat withcommodities whose consumption is just postponed.For Huysmans, the Satanist is a materialist exiled from a world sat-urated with satisfaction. Unlike him, the Catholic artist imagines lifepurified of excess, in which the ringing of church bells drives out malig-nant spirits. Space for him is empty, not seething with unseen larvae, notpermeated with the destructive energy of spells and counter-spells. Ideasperfectly expressed, material elevated into literature cease to exist, andwhen Baudelaire or Balzac dies, their souls do not inhabit a transitionalzone where they are available to imbeciles who contact them at séances.Death brings extinction, a purifying disappearance. There is no rein-troduction of cadavers into an economy of necrophagia, no dismalreincarnation, no activation of the food chain: “it seems to me one lifeis enough,” as Durtal opines. “I’d rather have nothingness, a hole, thanall these metamorphoses.”66Huysmans’s picture of a Satan who consoles embittered paupers is thesame as the one that Jules Bois gives in the volume Huysmans prefaced.A versatile essayist, playwright, and proto-feminist, Bois devoted much"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The Satanist37of his career to examining elevated states of consciousness and inves-tigating manifestations of the supernatural. Already in 1894, the yearbefore the publication ofLe Satanisme, Bois had patiently researched thecovert practice of devil worship inLes Petites Religions de Paris(The LittleReligions of Paris).Despite professing concern over Bois’s religious views, Huysmanspraises his book as an indispensable tool for those seeking to arm them-selves with knowledge in order to defend their faith. “While he maynot profess the most orthodox ideas,” Huysmans writes of Bois, “he is atleast an ardent and committed spiritualist who has alerted the church’sexplorers of the need to map out the countries of Lucifer.”67Indeed, Bois’s description of the first of the Three Satans is the sameas that evoked by Docre in his attack on the Christ of plutocrats. Boisprofesses horror for “the Satan of profanations, enchantments, spells,and shameful love.”68It is this Satan whom Bois refers to as “the mostdesolate of Anarchists”, the devil who presides over necromantic rituals,and who is “the god of Gilles de Rais.”69For Bois, the Satan of the Lost offers a poisonous compensation.Benighted souls who adore matter are rewarded for their sacrilege withmaterial satisfactions. Yet, inLà-bas, Huysmans shows that the gift ofriches can be spoiled, as it is in fairy tales, when the beneficiary expe-riences the disappearance of his appetite.Là-basoffers a miscellanyof moralistic lessons on the disappointments of the dreamer whosefantasies come true. Handmaiden of the devil, Madame Chantelouveawakens Durtal’s dormant sexuality, but when he finally possesses her,he is disenchanted and disgusted. The imperturbable bachelor whoseideal of femininity had been the virtuous Madame Carhaix with hersteaming cider and beef stew is roused to life by the demoness withher volcanic lust and icy skin. Part succubus, part maenad, MadameChantelouve does the devil’s work – re-appropriating a romance oncesublimated into conjectural narrative, then re-embodying it, as in Zola’snovels of insanity and rutting. The teleology of Catholic authorshiptakes flesh and refines it into insight, transmuting the desultoriness ofhistorical data into the ordering and intelligible structure of fiction.In Durtal’s relationship with Madame Chantelouve, this relationshipis reversed, when a love affair initially pursued as a distant exchangeof letters is reconverted into a collision of bodies that scratch and sweatand pant.

As Jean Borie writes: “It is by the intensity of theauthor’s erotic imagination that Huysmans’s Devil manifests himself.”70It is in space emptied of the desired object that Satan first appears:lines of text written in Madame Chantelouve’s myrtle green ink, the vasthalls of Tiffauges where Gilles, his debauched cohorts, and his alchemistadvisors gorge themselves on salmon, beer, and peacocks – where, “inthat womanless castle” they sink into “monstrous dreams.”71Solitude unfilled by women, indigence unrelieved by the provisionof physical necessities are filled by the Evil One and the material sat-isfactions that he promises. Citing unnamed “professors of mysticaleroticism,” Bois claims that the experience of succubacy “depends onauto-suggestion,” and that “a subtle form of onanism” affords “the illu-sion of possessing whomever one wants, living or dead, provided onehas a clear enough image of them.”72InLà-bas, Durtal sees Madame Chantelouve as infernal because sheis nothing that becomes something, an epistolary mystery vulgarizedand explained as sacrilege and perversion. Durtal’s mistress is neverexperienced as more bewitching and seductive than when she is afigment of her lover’s imagination, “a non-existent being, a chimerainvented by his brain in a moment of crisis.”73But by bringing herto life and introducing her into his bed, he puts the fantasy to deathand refrigerates the heated image, turning intercourse into a diaboli-cal celebration of necrophilia. Despite her ember eyes and burning lips,Durtal finds himself “embracing a corpse, a body so cold that it frozehis own.”74In Huysmans, possession is simultaneously financial, sex-ual, and demonic: the man whose Midas touch turns the desired objectinto gold, bloodless, inorganic, metallic, and cold, is like the lover whosesated lust turns a woman into the cadaver of his indifference. The suc-cubus, writes Bois, is a desire “dressed in flesh that haunts,” having thecolor, shape, and smell of “an actual being.”75Diagnosed in the psychi-atric idiom for which Huysmans professed antipathy, invoking demons,inviting succubi requires only morbid ideation.The Satanist’s aim to reincarnate what is rarefied as spirit opposesthe literary project of changing historical accident into explanatorynarrative and the lover’s mission to refine his lust into dialogicromance.Satanism and the bodyCentral to Satanic liturgy is a desecration of the Eucharist, literalizingthe symbol of Communion as spoiled food or poison sustenance.

It was Vintraswho proclaimed the advent of the era of the Paraclete, the Third Reignpreceding the return of Christ in glory. Purporting to be a reincarnationof the prophet Elijah, the visionary Vintras claimed to administer bleed-ing hosts in which mystic words and images appeared. Abbé Boullan,who succeeded Vintras as leader of the sect, instructed Huysmans in theprinciples of Dolorist reparation, whereby Christ, whose continued suf-fering was manifested in the bloody Eucharist, was linked to consumersof the hosts who participated in the Passion.In his preface to Bois’s book, Huysmans cites as evidence of the devil’scleverness his ability to inspire people to deny the fact of his existence,asserting that Satanism thrives on the difficulty one has in convincingthe public of its danger. Whereas the devil works like money by hid-ing his material reality, the writer destroys that reality by exposing anddenouncing it. Concurring with “the old axiom from Magic, that oncea secret is divulged, it is lost,”77Huysmans endorses Bois’s attempts toventilate the obscene truths of Satanic ritual: “the Spirit of Darkness livesin the muddy night of the soul, and he is paralyzed, rendered powerlessonce a spotlight is thrown on him.”78This is the obliterative goal of Huysmans’s literary project as a whole:to annihilate the squalid realities of life by converting them into text.For Huysmans, Christ is revealed through his emancipation from theflesh, as the Savior’s corpse is found to have vanished from the Sepul-cher. During the era of God, the Son, sinners are redeemed by martyrs’suffering. This age will end when Vintras’ hosts are healed and whenChrist is freed from his prison of food. Until then, the Messiah will bethwarted by evildoers who re-concretize Him as symbol – who denyhis transcendence, not by discarding “round wafers of bread,” but bydefiling and violating “the very flesh of Christ.”79InLà-bas, Satanists opposing the soul’s ascendancy over the bodyinvert high and low, and, like Docre, tattoo the Cross on their feet.They relocate from the aerie in which the ringing of church bells isa tintinnabulary exorcism that purifies the air of larvae.

The celebrantsof Black Masses who purport to attack Christ in the body are more accu-rately described by Huysmans as “abbés Verbicides” (priests who murderthe Word).80Là-basmarks a new stage in Huysmans’s religious thinking, since –while Huysmans’s fictional counterpart, Durtal, may dream of a spir-itualized alternative to Zola’s physiology-based naturalism – he alsoacknowledges that creation necessarily entails embodiment. In addi-tion to housing clean, inchoate thoughts in the debased, democraticallyaccessible idiom of the people, books also behave like bodies in being cir-culated among readers who soil sublime ideas by passing them throughtheir minds. Artists once sequestered in the ethereal realm of inspira-tion are compelled to re-descend to the squalid milieu of the bookstore.Obliged, “once their book is in print, to see it exposed to the filthy gazeof the masses,” they experience publication as “a rape of the little theyare worth.”81Passages like these show Huysmans’s Christological identificationwith a martyr who suffers in a body devoured by his disciples. J. HillisMiller explains how the sacrament of Communion enacts the fate of thewriter whose work is “broken, divided, passed around, consumed by thecritics.”82Huysmans’s aesthetic is therefore not ascensionally orientedalong a vertical axis; it does not represent the artist disincarnated asthe beauty of his creation. Having risen as Spiritual Naturalism, art is re-appropriated by its audience when the text, as tortured body or bleedinghost, is eaten by its readers.In this way,Là-basdescribes the homology of the mystic and theSatanist, both condemned to suffer in the flesh that they simultaneouslyexalt and vilify. However, unlike the Satanists who deny the Resur-rection by sexualizing Christ’s body and impugning his divinity, theDolorist adopts a different system of positional inversions, showing theHigh Man who comes down again in the communion with his follow-ers. This is what the astrologer Gévingey tells his listeners in Carhaix’sbell-tower, when he explains the meaning of Dr. Johannes’s celebrationof the sacrifice of the Glory of Melchizedek, where the officiant’s robeis adorned with a symbol “in the form of an upside down Cross.” Likethe Hanged Man represented in the Arcanum of the Tarot, the invertedCross “signifies that the priest Melchizedek must die in the flesh so thathe can live again in Christ, assuming the power of the incarnate Wordwho was made man and died for us.”83"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The Satanist41Unlike the embodiment of the Word as flesh and blood the faithfulconsume, the Satanist’s aim is to intellectualize desire and invent newtransgressions of the soul. This is what Huysmans, inCertains,identifiesas the singular vision of Félicien Rops who, in his seriesSataniques,cap-tures lust that goes beyond the physical. As Huysmans remarks, the devilis manifested in desires that transcend corporeity – that illustrate morbiddelectation whose effect, Huysmans says, is to “spiritualize ordure.”84Abstention from sinful acts promotes a monstrous inflation of guiltyimpulses, a truth that Rops communicates in his illustration forLe Vicesuprême(Supreme Vice). There, the author, Joséphin Péladan, describesthe ultimate in evil in terms like those Huysmans uses in his analy-sis of Rops: “To adore the demon or to love evil; these are concrete orabstract expressions of an identical act. There is blindness in instinctualsatisfaction, there is madness in the perpetration of sinful deeds, but toconceive of or theorize evil requires a calm operation of the mind. Thisis the Supreme Vice.”85The semioclastic crimes done by worshippers of Satan elevate physicalacts of violence to the level of the metaphysical. Diabolical infanticides,like the theft of consecrated wafers, are attacks on bodies as well asattacks on purity as symbol. The murderers who cut a child’s throat,drink his blood, or eat his heart seek to rematerialize the sacramen-tal meaning of the Eucharist. They do what Léo Taxil accomplisheson the level of blasphemy-as-ridicule when he calls Communion bread“Jesus grub.”86Satanism and the restoration of chaosIn opposition to the anti-spiritual objectives Huysmans ascribes toLuciferians, he proposes his own work as a dialectic of raising andlowering, the creative sublimation of art’s material and its subsequentre-embodiment as textual sustenance. At the same time, he contrastsSatanism’s movement toward chaos and incoherence with the unifyingprinciple of literature that replaces contingency with meaning. In hercommentary on the demiurge, Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel contrasts theprocesses of divine creation, which emphasize ordering, naming, sepa-rating, and structuring, with the anarchic aims of Sade’s hero, whoseobjective, she says, is “not to annihilate things but to dissolve andmetamorphose them after breaking down the molecules.”87In oppos-ing God, who replaces nonsense with intelligence and who gathersdisparate entities into recognizable forms, the Satanist seeks a restora-tion of randomness and fragmentation. By shattering whole bodies into"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"42Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Franceconstituent parts, by privileging atomization over totalizing perfection,the Satanist tries to compete with God and so “entertains a belief in thepossibility of creating a new kind of reality out of original chaos.”88InLà-bas, Durtal is advised that Satanists fill the air with invisiblemalignancies, evil particulates, deadly, unseen agents targeting the vic-tim of a spell. As Gévingey explains: “Space is inhabited by microbes. Isit any more surprising that it should be teeming with spirits and larvae?”Like vinegar and water, “which are saturated with animalcules,” air alsoseethes “with beings that are more or less corporeal, with embryos thatare more or less fully developed.”89For psychiatrists like Charcot, the man who believes himself attackedby evil spirits may suffer from a paranoiac horror of the infinitesimallysmall. But the person targeted by a bewitchment or a curse feels he isbesieged by criminal thoughts and murderous intentions.Like archival minutiae which are the by-product of history and whichthe fictional biographer rearranges as his narrative, larvae are hostilethoughts collected by a spell-caster and directed by his will toward asingle destructive goal. Negatively complementing Huysmans’s pictureof the devil-worshipper – assembling spiritual pathogens into a deadlyforce governed by his intelligence – the biographer/historian collectsthe existential debris of time, scattered documents that coalesce intoa coherent explanation of the past. As a convert who chose Christianteleology over an impression of life’s adventitiousness, Huysmans wasrepelled by the senselessness of raw experiential data. Opposing thedevil, who embodies meaninglessness, Christ symbolizes suffering madepurposeful.Joanny Bricaud describes the aftermath of Abbé Boullan’s quar-rel with Stanislas de Guaïta, who allegedly targeted Huysmans, therenegade priest’s confederate, with spells that were transported byswarms of unseen larvae. Despite celebrating a sacrifice to the Glory ofMelchizedek, Huysmans for years reported being terrorized by invisibleassailants, feeling himself pummeled “on the head and face with fluidicfisticuffs.”90To Huysmans, spiritual evil was represented by small things, bits ofsinful ideation, unfocused thinking, guilty reverie. Without discipline,work, or prayer to illumine or eradicate them, these fragments of iniq-uity came to saturate the spiritual plane. Bois describes these larvae as“human wishes or dreams shaken out of their astral sheaths, crumbs ofthoughts, the detritus of anger and hate.”91Inconsequential and disor-ganized, these unformulated impulses are largely harmless, suggestingonly the moral pusillanimity of their sources."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The Satanist43Bois elaborates on what he terms “the ridiculous terror of larvae” byciting extensively from the writings of Charles Berbiguier, who com-plained of harassment by maliciousfarfadets, goblins who stole histobacco box and garter buckles, inflicted flea bites and induced sneez-ing. Huysmans is similarly disinclined to dignify small sins, feeling agreater affinity for the Satanist whose rebellion was majestic and whoaspired to greatness in his wickedness just as saints aspired to greatnessin their sacrifice. Unlike imps diffusely pullulating on the astral plane,heroic evil is ordered by intelligence and clarity. “The Devil,” as Boissays, is “the collectivity of larvae,”92multiplicity made unity regimentedby design.Art and alchemyThroughoutLà-bas, Durtal continues to remark on the gemmation ofexceptional malefactors and visionary Christians, describing Gilles him-self as high and low, sublime and monstrous, never common: “fromthe most exalted mysticism to the most aggravated Satanism, it isonly a short step.”93Durtal’s meditation on the sinisterly occult prop-erties of capital may shed light on Gilles’s passage from Christiansoldier to raving butcher, performing hecatombs in the dungeons ofTiffauges. Illustrating Durtal’s apothegm about the diabolical influenceof money, his research on Gilles shows how materialism had corruptedthe Maréchal. Bibliophile and collector of priceless art treasures, Gilleshad squandered a fortune in dressing a sumptuous table and decorat-ing an opulent chapel. Unstinting in attempts to satisfy the appetitesof the body and the soul, he had assembled a vast library containingprecious Latin manuscripts, attracting to Tiffauges a princely entourageof clergymen whom he had outfitted in rare surplices and sacerdotalornaments.Yet Gilles’s profligacy had not been directed just at fulfilling hisown desires. Instead, with his legendary hospitality, he had welcomedpoets and pilgrims on whom he bestowed his largesse and whom heshowered with rich gifts. Gilles’s profligate generosity had evidenced aself-cancelling materialism, as he disposed of wealth as carelessly andfeverishly as he acquired it. As money destroys the objects it changesinto the symbol of itself, Gilles exchanged symbolic riches for theplenitude of possessions, then recklessly consumed them or gave themaway to others. Unlike the speculator growing fat on wealth whoseenjoyment he puts off, Gilles had practiced an indulgently ruinousasceticism, spending everything, consuming everything until his coffers"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"44Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francehad been emptied. In the mystic who renounces the material satis-factions of this world, in the writer who destroys the reality that hetransforms into beauty, in Gilles, the madman, whose extravagancebetrays a metaphysical revolt, Huysmans identifies the spiritual brethrenwhose stories he narrates inLà-bas.Yet Durtal is careful to observe that Gilles’s first dabbling in alchemyhad not been motivated solely by the debtor’s panicked desperation.While in his demonic invocations and holocaustic human sacrifices,Gilles conducted alchemical experiments to regain the riches he haddissipated, his initial occult studies aimed at his spiritual ennoblement.Indeed, as is thematically developed in the novel, alchemy acts as ametaphor for the competing goals of Satanic ritual and Christian mysti-cism. On the material plane, it transforms vulgar substances into gold;on the level of literature and religion, it turns confusion into knowl-edge. In the imprecations he directs at Christ as enemy of the poor,Canon Docre invokes the rights of the indigent to pleasures and posses-sions. Yet Docre’s Satan is like the bank vault god who produces wealthexchanged for virtue.In the tradition of Paracelsus, whom Durtal praises in the novel, thegold the alchemist manufactures is a symbol of a symbol – a catalystthat does not multiply what the experimenter has but that effects apurifying change in what the experimenter is. Manly Hall provides asummary of alchemy’s higher aspirations, saying that, through art, “themental body of ignorance” is purified by being “tincturedwith under-standing [...] through faith and proximity to God,” adding that, in thisway, “the consciousness of man may be transmuted from base animaldesires [...] into a pure, golden, and godly consciousness.”94For the Satanist, and for Gilles, gold is wisdom’s body re-materialized.This is what explains the devil-worshippers’ rejection of transcendence,their insistence on the abject physicality of a Redeemer hypostatizedas adulterated food mixed with menstrual blood and semen. Desiringpleasure and satisfaction, they maintain that the body is all there is.Conversely, as spiritual alchemy, Christian art is operational, engagingin the dynamic interaction of material reality and human intelligence.Driving out the larval swarms of fetal dreams and ambitions aborted bylaziness and cowardice, it refines the body of ignorance into the light ofunderstanding.In Bois’s taxonomy, there are three Satans: one for the poor man, onefor the lecher, one for the self-exalting intellectual, all joined by theirsubordination of others to the self. These people make no commitmentto refine themselves into better beings but wish to cheapen the external"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The Satanist45objects they take in and assimilate. The Satanist, as Bois writes, “believesthat his miserable self is the only truth, he cries out that the universe isnothing but a pale reflection of himself, while before him, the universerises up in its splendid mystery.”95Even in Durtal’s pre-conversion state,he sees the writer as an artifex, his text as the crucible in which realityis not paid for but embellished and redeemed by elegance.Art and communionThe final difference that Durtal discerns between the Satanist andChristian has to do with the former’s isolation and the latter’s selfless-ness and solidarity. While the greedy man wants to acquire goods andthe lecher desires to possess women, the Catholic artist bestows his writ-ings on others and so works in imitation of his Master. He is unlikethe Magus, Mérodack, in Péladan’sEthopée, a gloomy, imperious figure,lonely in his contemptuous aloofness.Forgoing the pleasures of sex and the solace of friendship, the Maguscontemplates the spectacle of human depravity with Olympian dis-dain. Bois also describes the Magus as an anti-social figure: “he is trulyalone, at once superhuman and inhuman, unfortunate and inaccessible.Without a wife, without pleasures, without weaknesses, he is only eyesuntouched by emotion or sleep, only a mouth that never smiles, onlyhis hands and his intelligence.”96It is in Huysmans’s study of superhuman evil and divinely inspiredself-abnegation that he first shows his hero joining in a communityof like-minded seekers. No longer is Huysmans’s character isolated, likedes Esseintes, in the opulently appointed sanctuary of his aestheticiz-ing consciousness. Durtal is still an elitist who loathes the democraticcrassness of his era, but even in the solitary work of authorship, he inter-acts with others with whom he shares a spiritual and artistic kinship.InArebours, des Esseintes is so secluded in his sickly superciliousnessthat he is unable to produce anything: a work of art, a new idea,a fresh perspective on a memory. Des Esseintes’s ambition to attainperfect autonomy is exemplified by his fantasm of the nourishing pep-tone enema, the desire to consume nothing and make nothing outsidehimself.InLà-bas, Durtal initially presents himself as a descendant of desEsseintes, clinging to a fantasy of self-sufficiency, authoring literatureintended only for his own enjoyment – defining himself, not as a childof God, but as the father of himself. Like the diabolical capitalist whosewealth begets more wealth, Durtal sires the book he takes as his bride."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"46Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FranceLiterary creation begins as forbidden endogamy, a refusal of Christ’sself-sacrifice for a fallen humanity. Durtal himself describes his autho-rial activity as transgressive and taboo, boasting to Chantelouve andhis wife of inventing the new sin of Pygmalionism which, he says,achieves a synthesis “of cerebral onanism and incest.”97While profess-ing reluctance to pimp his book by displaying it in bookstore windows,he also incubates the fantasy of violating the daughter of his soul. Afterfathering his work on Gilles, Durtal entertains two options: either com-promising the virginal integrity of his textual offspring by marketing itto the public, or keeping it for himself, refusing to set it free. The workon Gilles becomes another aliment-as-excrement, self-administered likethe peptone enema, affording solitary pleasure.Durtal’s denial of art’s function as communion marks the moment inLà-baswhen the appeal of Satanism is the strongest. Beyond acting asa ritual profanation of innocence, the devil-worshipper’s immolation ofchildren – disemboweled and sodomized like Gilles’s victims – stands asa symbolic rejection of the independent externality of the other person.Before he can grow and mature, the child is slaughtered, dismembered,his body parts eaten and incorporated by celebrants of the Black Mass.Devouring one’s progeny, raping the daughter of the soul enlists thehelp of the devil, who encourages the criminal in the adoration ofhimself. Pygmalionism, as Durtal theorizes, is a refinement of incest,since it involves no actual intercourse, since the child is exclusively thefather’s product, “the only one he could have sired without the flesh andblood of another person.”98There is even an adumbration of Huysmans’sadomasochistic hagiography of The Blessed Lydwine (Sainte Lydwinede Schiedam1901), the pleasure he takes in enumerating her physicaland spiritual torments: “Suppose an artist paints a saint with whom hethen falls in love. That would involve a crime against nature as well as asacrilege, whose consequences would be enormous!”99This onanistic pleasuring of the self through the medium of art ispresented inLà-basas the ultimately Luciferian perversion. Withheldfrom interaction with undiscriminating readers, texts are unassimilatedto the “ochlocratic art” that Péladan abominated. But having listened toDurtal’s explanation of Pygmalionism, Chantelouve dismisses the possi-bility of inventing a new sin, saying “the book of vices and virtues is aneditionne varietur.”100He refutes Durtal’s assertion that the Pygmalionistis master of his work, claiming that, in the relationship of text andauthor, it is the former that retains control.By projecting parts of himself into the body of his work, the artistperforms a self-bewitchment, becoming the object of his own spell."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The Satanist47Transposition of a self objectified as artwork is analogous to the sor-cerer’s modeling of theVolt, the talismanic doll, the wax effigy of hisvictim on whom his hostile thoughts are trained.

Like the figurine of an enemy fashioned with fingernails and hair, itis a metonym that its creator has endowed with magic power.

It is seen in Huysmans’sembrace of the fame and fortuneLà-baswon him, in the denunciationof these vain things that he expresses in his novel. It is apparent in theintellectual pride that joins him to his work, and in his recognition thathis work is what spiritually bonds him with his audience.Là-basenables Huysmans to identify and overcome temptation.Indeed, as Chantelouve remarks, the Pygmalionist is less the rapist ofhis soul-child than the object of the malevolence that his work directsat him. Pygmalionism “is nothing more than a refined expression ofsuccubacy,”101which, like art, involves the embodiment of obsessions,giving form to larval thoughts that the imagination brings to life.At first, the author’s relationship with his work is onanistic, allowinghim the illusion of possessing an idea “provided that he has a clearimage of it.” It is the artist who is captivated, transfixed by his creation,the author held in thrall by his text’s seductive power.So, notwithstanding his misgivings, Durtal accepts that he must com-plete his book, that the textual child, having reached maturity, mustbe released into the world. While creativity retains the value of analchemical transmutation, refining the stuff of life into the gold ofits expression, the finished work is a false god whose blandishmentsmust be resisted.

Sin’s bookis an editionne varietur.Satanism only codifies this incomplete creation, narcissism thatnever culminates in parturition and delivery. Unlike the Christian whorejoices in the nativity of Jesus, the Satanist delights in the persistenceof disorder, “the distress of an enormous Fetus that never becomes theChild.”102Like Huysmans’s writing ofLà-bas, his prefacing of Jules Bois’s bookshows the author moving between the realms of experience and fic-tion, as Durtal navigates between historic research and literary inven-tion. What distinguishes reality from imagination, religious faith fromscience, is a belief that elevates the seeker onto the plane of the transcen-dental. At the conclusion ofLà-bas, Durtal and Huysmans’s conversionis uncompleted, but when he finishes his book and acquiesces to itspublication, it is as if he already models his artistic practice on the cel-ebration of Communion. He participates in a modest version of theEucharistic feast when he leaves his bachelor’s quarters and climbsup into Carhaix’s bell-tower, joining friends and commensals in con-versation and beef stew. Huysmans’s characters predict the victory ofChristianity over Satanism, anticipating the dawning of the Third Ageof the Paraclete, when man’s emulation of Jesus and suffering the Pas-sion will give way to disincarnation during the reign of the Holy Spirit.Then Lucifer’s dominion, the cult of pleasure and materialism – symbol-ized, as des Hermies says, by the heart’s resemblance to the penis – willbe succeeded by an era when only the pure can reproduce. As Gévingeyexplains, citing the doctrine of Vintras: “The action of the Paraclete willextend to the generative principle. Divine life must sanctify those organswhich henceforth will procreate only the elect, those exempt from orig-inal sin, those beings no longer needing to be tested in the furnace ofhumiliation.”103It is as if the novel’s final chapters foreshadow the growing matura-tion of Huysmans’s faith, anticipating the time when his isolation in abody will be over. When fulfillment of the messianic promise absolvesliterature of naturalism, there will be no more opposition of high andlow, of flesh and spirit.

Huysmans went on to abet the fin de siècle’s most accomplishedhoaxer, Léo Taxil, by publicizing stories about the secret Luciferian sectof Palladism, an entity whose existence Taxil had fabricated. Rewardingreaders with a frisson of sacrilege, the pleasurable horror of debauch-ery, Huysmans incorporates into his laudatory preface to Jules Bois’sLeSatanisme et la magiean exposé of the cult that allegedly flourished inthe forbidden lodges of nineteenth-century Freemasons.Unlike Satanists, whom Huysmans describes as solitary agents,Palladists, he says, joined together in an army preparing for the arrivalof the Anti-Christ. A worldwide force of evil, they had established ahierarchical order which, like the church, possessed an “anti-Pope, acuria, a College of Cardinals” that together formed “a parody of theVatican court.”1With a liturgy and prescribed rituals, Palladism was aninverted mockery of Christianity: Catholicismàrebours,asHuysmanswrites, alluding to his 1884 Decadent masterpiece. Describing the per-petrator of this massive fraud as a blasphemer whose anti-clericalismwas as contemptible as it was grotesque, Huysmans contributes his con-siderable influence to perpetuating the mystification which marked theculmination of the Satanism craze of the fin de siècle.Nineteenth-century occultism: freemasonry and the devilThe reason to analyze the climate in which Léo Taxil raised up histowering imposture is that it yields an understanding of the culturalconditions that fostered interest in the occult.

What reasons did Taxil’s audience have for investingin his magisterial travesty? What prejudices did it play to? What appetitefor entertainment did it satisfy?The Catholic reactionaries drawn to the occult in the fin de sièclewere altogether different from their predecessors from the Romanticgeneration. As Eugen Weber writes in his study of nineteenth-centurysuperstition, messianic thought in the aftermath of the Revolution hadoften been coupled with a utopian socialism that espoused “a chiliasmof hope.”2Drawing its source material, as Weber says, from Swedenborgand Saint-Martin, Romantic occultism expressed “fashionable themesof eschatological thought: a new last age, the end of days, the cultof woman as redeemer.”3Despite differences in ideological orienta-tion, these same beliefs informed the thinking of the Decadent mystics,whose apocalypticism was nonetheless considerably more pessimistic.On the one hand, fin-de-siècle Catholics regarded Positivism as theirenemy, since for empiricists, God was only an archaic vestige of a bygoneera of magic thinking. On the other hand, because of the historic linkbetween occultism and utopian socialism, Catholics viewed their left-wing counterparts as practitioners of black magic, “revolutionaries whodisestablished the church, persecuted the Pope, executed the king, wereclearlysuppôts de Satan[instruments of Satan].”4Huysmans’s preface to Jules Bois’s book begins with a recurrent Deca-dent trope: that in a scientific era where religion had been supplantedby psychiatry, where Satanism had been diagnosed as a disorder, andevil had been pathologized, cases of possession were classified underreassuring etiological labels. Huysmans’s comments underscore a com-mon worry among Catholic believers that, if devil worship was seen asthe product of mental aberration, then the whole of institutionalizedChristianity could be discredited as delusional. According to Huysmans,the faith that healed could be healed itself by science.In Huysmans’s rebuttal of criminologists and Charcot’s disciples at theSalpêtrière, he cites sacrilegious acts that could not easily be classifiedas civil offenses.

Communion wafers which, for the unbeliever, held nocommercial value had been stolen, while gold ciboria and pyxides wereleft untouched. Attacks upon Christ’s body as Eucharistic bread were“acts of execration” that led one inevitably to conclude in “the certainexistence of Satanism.”5Given the Decadent Catholics’ investment in the material species ofthe Eucharist, it is not surprising that demonophobia drew on fears ofassaults on Christ’s body. Thus, in Taxil’s portrait gallery of Palladism’sleaders, he notes a fondness for displaying amulets containing conse-crated Hosts used for ritual defilement. One such talisman, engravedwith Luciferian hieroglyphs and symbols, bore the image of a pontificaltiara being vomited on by a Chinese monster. As Taxil says, it had con-tained a hidden cavity fitted with needles which, when closed, impaleda Host, thereby re-enacting the nailing of Christ’s hands and feet.The tone of Huysmans’s preface conveys the Catholic preference forfighting the mysterious abominations of Satanism rather than refut-ing the principles of atheistic rationalism. What Weber sees as theRestorationists’ tendency to disparage the values of the revolutionaries –their belief that “democracy looked like demonocracy”6– could haveeasily led to mistrust of an order like the Freemasons, with their embraceof democratic values and their tendency toward secrecy. Long disap-proved for their advocacy of religious tolerance, the Masons had comeunder attack by the church in the final decades of the nineteenth cen-tury. In Pius IX’s epistle,Scite profecto, published in 1873, the Vaticanfor the first time explicitly linked Freemasonry to Satanism. In 1877,an order promulgated by theGrand Orient de Parisrescinded an articledeclaring the Masons’ obligation to believe in God and the immortalityof the soul, reinforcing long-held impressions of the Order’s promo-tion of unbelief. Finally, in Leo XIII’s 1884 encyclical,Humanum Genus,laying out the Pope’s broad understanding of Masonic doctrines andobjectives, he had urged the faithful to combat its deleterious teach-ings. Leo’s message described a Manichean struggle between Christianityand Luciferianism, combatants willing to defend the church and ene-mies wishing to return to paganism. In concluding his encyclical, Leohad admonished all the bishops of the Catholic world to unmask “theiniquity of Freemasonry and to expose it in all its somber truth.”7Against this backdrop of anti-Republicanism, anti-rationalism, and anti-secularism, Catholics came to see the church as an imperiled andbesieged institution, allowing Taxil to resurrect the familiar hobgoblinof Freemasonry as a vehicle for perpetrating his hoax."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The Hoaxer53Taxil, the pranksterBiographical studies of Léo Taxil may explain the origins of his anti-clericalism, yet they fail to account for his virtuosity as a peerless hoaxer.NéGabriel-Antoine Jogand-Pagès in Marseille in 1854, Taxil adoptedhis nom de plume as an early expression of insubordination, reject-ing patronymy in a way that extended from the family head to churchelders. A refractory student, Taxil was placed by his father in the handsof Catholic educators; however, attendance at a Jesuit school was hardlyan unusual occurrence among Taxil’s artist contemporaries. Recallingthe misadventure that befell the young Octave Mirbeau at the schoolof Saint-François Xavier in Vannes (an incident transposed in Mirbeau’sautobiographical novelSébastien Roch[1890]), the alleged sexual abuseof a student by a predatory teacher might have kindled the anti-Catholicism of two otherwise dissimilar writers. While supplying littleprobative detail, Michel Berchmans makes this argument by innuendo,explaining that Taxil’s animus toward priests came from experiencing“the indiscretion of a chaplain who took in hand something morethan the spiritual interests of his pupils.”8Yet Taxil’s denunciationof the Vatican and church officials does not single out the pedophileas the most dangerous malefactor but instead encompasses a broadarraignment of the clergy as pan-sexual deviants and hypocrites. Beforeimplementing the Palladism hoax, Taxil had pennedLes Amours de PieIX(The Loves of Pius IX), a catalogue of Papal excesses, had describedLeo XIII, who would later welcome the supposed penitent back into thebosom of the church, as guilty of poisonings committed during his pon-tificate. More tellingly, as Alfred Waite points out, Taxil had authored abook onContemporary Prostitution,which Waite characterizes as a “col-lection of revolting statistics upon,inter alia, the methods, habits, andphysical peculiarities of persons who practice pederasty.”9Like the judge-penitent Jean-Baptiste Clamence in Albert Camus’sLaChute(The Fall) Taxil coupled the practice of confession and incrimina-tion, mystification as gratuitous perversity and as a hygienic regimenfor establishing fact. As Weber writes: “Taxil enjoyed Voltaire, whom heoften cites in hisConfessions, notably when it came to justifying the artof deception, which the two practiced with consummate skill. ‘Lying,wrote Voltaire to his friend Thiérot, ‘is a vice only when it is harmful.It is a great virtue when it is beneficial.

Beginning with youthful pranks, he describes thegreat shark hoax that had sown panic in the coastal city of Marseille in1853. Deluging the desks of Marseille’s editorial offices, letters of alarmhad reported sightings of voracious sharks terrifying bathers and intim-idating fishermen. Explaining the proliferating swarms of bloodthirstypredators in the waters of Marseille: a Corsican vessel’s accidental jetti-soning of its cargo of spoiled smoked meat. In response to public panic,a certain General Espivent had assembled 100 intrepid citizens to mana tugboat and clear the harbor. But when they reached the site, not asingle shark was seen. And at the postal addresses from which the let-ters were sent, not a fisherman was found who might have reportedthe danger.Taxil acknowledges that General Espivent, the dupe in the matter, hadpreviously suppressed publication of Taxil’s lampoon,Marotte, journaldes fousand had therefore been the target of what its designer called “aninoffensive act of vengeance.”12Sharks or devils – bodies of diffuse anxiety, fears coalescing as a child’snightmare terrors – Taxil’s inventions materialize what lurks in thesubconscious, inadmissible nemeses and forbidden desires. A narrativeelaboration of hallucinations, which are themselves the product of awish or a fear, the hoax re-presents a fantasmatic absence.The second of Taxil’s early fabrications also involved inducing visionsof something not there. Here again, the hoax elicits a creative responsefrom the victim, confirming reception theory’s foundational princi-ple that fiction, in its attribution of meaning, originates as much inconsumers as in producers of works. One fine day, Taxil explains,excited announcements began circulating through the scientific com-munity relating the discovery of a submerged city at the bottom ofLake Léman, between Nyort and Coppet. Citing apposite passages fromtheCommentariesof Julius Caesar, historians had identified a settlementconstructed at a time when the diameter of the lake had been smaller.Now swallowed up beneath the waters, the sub-lacustrine village becamea magnet for scholars and curiosity-seekers. Boatmen taking touristsout to the center of the lake spread oil over the surface of the waterto facilitate vision. Visitors told of seeing underwater intersections andthoroughfares, and a Polish archeologist proclaimed his discovery of anequestrian statue."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The Hoaxer55Taxil’s mystifications, thriving in a fin de siècle in which miracles werecommon, in which bewitchments were performed, and in which thedead were contacted at séances, drew on the popular disposition towardauto-suggestion. Infestations of sharks, apparitions by Asmodeus, car-tographic explorations of submerged Roman towns – all are fictionsconcocted by a master-impostor and cultivated and completed by animaginative audience. Abhorrence of reason on the part of Catholicintellectuals, the prevalence of superstition among the uneducated andcredulous, the timely resurgence of supernatural evil for the church tocombat: all created a climate hospitable to the emergence of Palladism.There was money to be made, there were books to be written, there werejokes to be told on the subject of Satan. As Papus writes in his essay ofdemystification: “The Black Mass imagined by Mr. Huysmans laid outthe path to follow. One could exploit in every possible respect people’sterror of Lucifer.”13Palladism: The history and doctrine of an imaginary cultIn his detailed anatomy of the origins of Palladism, Alfred Waite enu-merates the central elements in Taxil’s great hoax. According to Waite’schronology, Palladism, as an offshoot of Freemasonry, had been estab-lished in France as early as 1737. Already initiating women designatedas Companions of Penelope, Palladism had expanded the membershipof Freemasons to include androgyne orders.Thereafter, Waite comments, the historical trail of Palladism hadgrown faint until, having been reconstituted in Charleston, SouthCarolina, it had flowered again as the Scottish Rite of Perfection andHerodom under the leadership of legendary politician, man of letters,and esotericist Albert Pike, elected Grand Master of the Ancient andAccepted Scottish Rite in 1859. Operating secretly and independentlyfrom the Order of Freemasons, Palladism had effected a radical schis-matic break with its founding organization, as it proceeded to imple-ment heretical changes: establishing a central directorship, formalizingits religious aims, and propagating what Waite calls its “transcendentalteachings.”14Initially impervious to campaigns of debunking, Taxil’s master-narrative had strengthened its credibility by integrating elements ofhistorical fact, incorporating the well-known figure of Pike, establish-ing ties and enlisting the collaboration of Monseigneur Léon Meurin,Archbishop of Port Louis in Mauritius and author ofFreemasonry: TheSynagogue of Satan, a farrago of episodes of outlandish deviltry liberallyinterlarded with anti-Semitic rants."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"56Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FranceMarianne Closson has chronicled the growing anti-Jewish senti-ment pervading the fin de siècle: the association of Freemasonry withSatanism as part of a worldwide Jewish conspiracy, paranoid preju-dice that reached a level of paroxysmal intensity with the convictionof Alfred Dreyfus for treason in 1894. Meurin’s somber divagationsabout the Kabbalah and its underpinning of the secret body of Masonicdoctrine – his assertion that the head of an occult group known as thePatriarchs of Judea was none other than the “famous unknown head ofthe Freemasons”15– came in an era that had already witnessed publi-cation of a host of polemical exposes and fictional depictions of malig-nant Jewish schemes threatening France and the church. Taxil himselfdeplored anti-Semitic prejudice, callingla juivomanie(Jew-mania) themanifestation of “a new form of mental alienation.”16However, heshowed no reluctance in welcoming the support of bigoted fanatics andpropagandists like Meurin in perpetrating his merry prank.It was in part as a result of the publication of works like Meurin’s thatthe association of Kabbalism, Freemasonry, and Satanism crystallized innineteenth-century popular consciousness. Huysmans’s description ofPalladism as Catholicismàrebourshad been illustrated by the rhetoric,apparel, and ritual practices of Canon Docre inLà-bas, where the rene-gade priest, naked under a chasuble adorned with an inverted cross, hadofficiated at a Black Mass while standing beneath a statue of a tumes-cent Christ. Genuflecting when required by liturgy, Docre seemed tobe presiding, as Huysmans’s protagonist, Durtal, says, over a simpleLow Mass.But apart from its symbolic and ceremonial inversions, Palladism, inits ritual and dogma, involved more than a profession of obedienceto, and adoration of, the Evil One. Jesus, whom Docre had decriedas deaf to the cries of the hungry and poor, is identified as the truemonster, “Abstractor of stupid purities, cursed Nazarene, feckless king,cowardly God.”17Conversely, Lucifer is honored for rewarding theabused and humiliated, for empowering them with the capacity for vio-lent retribution: “Satan, it is you that we adore: God of logic, God ofjustice.”18In Taxil’s exposition, Palladism is structured by a rigorouslyManichean binarism, following Zoroastrianism with its conflict betweenOrmuzd and Ahriman. In the beginning, Adonai, true God of darkness,had dethroned Lucifer, God of Light, expelling him from heaven. Whilehallowed by Christians as the principle of clemency and righteousness,Adonai reigns over an accursed world of suffering and turmoil in whichthe misbegotten raise up their cries of just petition.

Waite argues that such “an instruction would[not] seem to recommend itself to a numerically powerful following.”19But from Gérard de Nerval’s affiliation with the chthonic gods living inunderworld darkness to the Romantics’ adoption of Satan as a heroicfigure symbolizing revolt, the central doctrines of Palladism had alreadyproved to be popular.Building on this foundation – working in a climate of metaphysi-cal anxiety and xenophobic fear-mongering – Taxil went on to finishthe architectural masterpiece of his fraud – identifying Albert Pike asthe Grand Master of the Supreme Council of the Ancient and AcceptedScottish Rite headquartered in Charleston, locating other directoratesin Washington, Montevideo, Naples, Calcutta, and Port Louis, produc-ing such a wealth of detail that the truth of Palladism seemed to manyincontrovertible. “Even if one remembers that it is only a mystification,even if one keeps his mind alert, there emerge from these pages suchminute facts, such detailed anecdotes and citations that one has theimpression they are true. No doubt Hacks and Taxil were accomplishedhoaxers, but they were also, in their own right, genuine novelists.”20Docteur Bataile andLe Diable au XIXe siècle(The Devilin the Nineteenth Century)While Taxil continued to publish journalistic revelations of the alarmingpervasiveness of Luciferianism, the primary vehicle for propagating thePalladism hoax was a serialized exposé by Charles Hacks, writing underthe pseudonym of Dr. Bataille, that appeared from November 1892to December 1894. With Taxil’s public renunciation of Freemasonryand conversion to Catholicism, he had earned an audience with PopeLeo XIII, who hailed the repatriation of the reformed prodigal. Taxil’sembrace of his childhood faith had been all the more dramatic since,in the first confession to his spiritual mentor, Taxil admitted to hav-ing murdered an entire family, a crime so exorbitant that his confessorbelieved it to be true.

In order to secure the collaboration of Hacks,an old school friend working as a ship’s doctor when Taxil rediscoveredhim in Paris, Taxil had taken Hacks into his confidence, explaining thefoundation and history of the swindle, finding in his comrade an ama-teur of occultism already conversant with popular beliefs in demons andwerewolves. As a counterweight to Taxil’s sometimes laborious exposéof Masonic ritual, he had solicited the doctor’s assistance in present-ing Palladism in the form of an extended travel narrative: “publishingrituals doesn’t offer the same interest as narrating adventures that havebeen witnessed first-hand, especially if these adventures are full of magicmumbo-jumbo.”22While Taxil had assumed responsibility for supplying the technicaldetails, drawing up the identities and histories of its innumerable pro-ponents, he asked Hacks to flesh out these elements in an exotic travelphantasmagoria: descents into dungeons swarming with reptiles andspiders, journeys into jungles, a visit to a munitions plant in a secretesite beneath Gibraltar. It was the genre complementarity of Hacks’s seri-alized novel and Taxil’s exhaustive analysis of Palladism’s doctrine andinstitutional structure that ensured the believability of the improbablefabrication.As Closson rightly comments, readers of nineteenth-century popularromances readily accepted the effacement of boundaries between realityand fiction: “already accustomed to works whose novelistic and ideolog-ical stakes were inextricably intertwined,” they were familiar with storiesinformed by a political agenda: “pro-military, pro-clerical, anti-clerical,anti-Semitic: readers so unused to the distinction between fiction andinformation – especially when, in the fin de siècle, such informationrarely aimed at objectivity – certainly contributed to the success of LéoTaxil’s mystification.”23The divergent audiences for which Taxil tailored his imposture, fromthe Vatican court to consumers of what Waite calls the “penny dread-ful,” show the genius of a mystifier purveying both propaganda andentertainment, purportedly earnest religious treatises and action melo-drama.

The chance acquaintance withan Italian passenger, Gaetano Carbuccia, once hale and happy, nowhaggard and prematurely aged, is the pretext for Bataille’s introduc-tion to the terrible mysteries of Freemasonry. Carbuccia, persuaded bya friend to seek initiation into the Masons, had – upon payment of200 francs – acceded to the status of 33rd grade, subsequently becom-ing Grand Commander of the Temple, Sublime Hermetic Philosopher,member of the New Reformed Palladium, and associate of the Societyof Re-Theurgists. In Ceylon, reports Carbuccia, he had participated in atrue Luciferian ritual, during which the fallen Angel of Light had man-ifested himself in human guise. Induced to appear by the offering ofthe three skulls of mummified missionaries, he had heaped impreca-tions on Adonai and blessings on Baphomet. Accompanied by claps ofthunder, Lucifer appeared in his effulgent nakedness, complimentingworshippers, encouraging them to persevere. Bataille’s theatrical effectsovershadow the venality of the confraternity, willing to invite to themost solemn ceremony and grant the highest rank to an unknownoutsider, in return for a small price. Indeed, Bataille – committed toexposing the blasphemous truths of Palladism – had obtained the 90thMisraim grade himself for 500 francs, thereafter gaining access to themost secret Masonic enclaves and obtaining instruction in their mostarcane practices.In Taxil’s own revelations of recondite Masonic ritual – the inductionof female members into the Order of Penelope – he underscores thedisparity between pompous ceremony and vulgar motivation. Lengthyre-enactments of Greek myth or Biblical drama precede the sexual ini-tiation of the fledgling Masonic Sister, staging the story of Judith andHolofernes, for example, as a dramatic aperitif for ensuing orgies.Thereafter, Bataille, fortified with good intention and equipped withthe passport of his lofty insignia and grade in the Masonic hierarchy,proceeds to travel throughout the world, penetrating into the mostimpregnable Palladian sanctuaries and Luciferian lairs. In Bataille’s inau-gural encounter with the supernatural, he repairs to a hut at the heartof the desert, greeted there by a vampire bat, a cobra, a black cat, and anape fluent in Tamil.

Bataille and Taxil often work with a familiar principle of theoccult: that everything signifies more than it seems, that nothing isplain, monosemic, or evident. Phylogenetic gradations of intelligenceare wiped away when apes speak languages unknown to the subject,when nothing is gibberish, and Abracadabra opens locked doors. In theworld of the occult, outsiders are always disadvantaged by their sta-tus as the uninitiated. Lost and amazed – wandering in a labyrinth ofunreadable hieroglyphs and unanalyzable wonders – the neophyte ishandicapped both by his ignorance and interest. Obsessed with know-ing and despised for his ignorance, he is told there is a secret and wantsto know what it is. Thus, Bataille’s narrative is freighted with picturesquedetail signifying nothing – hiding from readers the secret that Lucifer isdestroyed by indifference to the fact of his existence.Rewarded for his participation in the mysterious Ceylonese auto-da-fe,Bataille is given a winged lingam, itself an omnibus signifier of untrans-latable esoteric power. A representation of the Hindu goddess Shiva, alingam in Sanskrit means a mark or sign. A signifier of significance, atautological expression of its importance, the lingam, unsurprisingly,is also a figure for the phallus, a passkey, a sign of recognition amongmembers of the priestly elect.Continuing his voyage to Pondicherry, Bataille encounters his nextmystical guide, Ramassamiponnotalmy-palé-dobacha, bearer of thelingam of his onomastic phallus, whose length is all-important andwhose size is what matters. When asked where he comes from, he says“From the eternal flame.” When asked where he is going, he answers“To the flame eternal.”24Cryptic palindromic utterances whose conclusion returns to thebeginning recall the ouroboros, the serpent biting its tail, symbol ofself-regeneration and cyclical recurrence. An image of completeness,perfection, or infinitude, the circle is also a zero, the numeric of worth-lessness; “a reunion of opposites,”25it is pregnancy of meaning that atthe same time denotes insignificance.Palladism and tabooBataille’s vagabond narrative also incorporates familiar elements offantastic transgressivity: violations of taboos eliciting disgust and dis-approval.

On the otherhand, devil religions, of which Palladism is a model, work to restore anoriginal state of undifferentiation, namelessness, and confusion, as inthe institution of androgyne lodges within the order of the Freemasons.Bataille’s Luciferians also follow the example of Sade in seeking a returnto chaos oranomos: that which is without a name, a teleology, orstructure. As Chasseguet-Smirgel says in comments that could apply toBataille: “Subversion of the law, the parody of a religion devoted to theworship of God, seeks to reverse the way leading from indistinctness toseparation and demarcation. Here we are very close to the [...] religionsof the devil. A black mass is a parody of the sacrifice of Christ. In it thecross is placed upside down, or facing the wall; the mass is said back-ward and the Tetragrammaton is pronounced the wrong way round andis accompanied by sexual orgies.”26Interdictions on incest, necrophilia,and bestiality are broken, and old laws are defiantly overthrown. If notculminating in the re-ascendancy of Lucifer to the throne of heaven, arestoration of the state of unity preceding creation of the world mani-fests itself, as Mircea Eliade says, “in a supreme act of regeneration andan enormous increase in power.”27Of course, along with exploring the Palladists’ demiurgic ambitions,Bataille’s narrative exploits “the Grand Guignol dimension of theseanecdotes,”28moving from an examination of metaphysical revolt to anindulgence in gratuitous exercises in the comic and grotesque. Bound-aries between life and death are blurred by representations of unendingdecomposition and temporal stasis. In Pondicherry, Bataille takes part ina ceremonial invocation of Baal-Zeboub, a ritual showcasing fakirs “inadvanced stages of putrefaction.” As Waite writes: “Most people are sup-posed to go easily to the devil, but these elected to do so solely by way ofa charnel-house asceticism and an elaborate system of self-torture. Somewere suspended from the ceiling by a rope tied to their arms, some werepermanently distorted into the shape of the letter ‘S’,” and the holiestof holies had “legs covered with gangrene, ulcers, and rottenness.”29The Satanic rituals that Bataille describes elicit laughter or revulsionyet still draw on the rich resources of cultural anthropology and archety-pal symbolism. In one of the Seven Temples of Sheol, a celebration ofthe sin of Eve re-enacts the Biblical origins of thefelix culpa. But ratherthan formalizing in the Exile the separation of the Creator and the crea-ture, the Grand Master and Vestal couple dialogically, in words whoseexplicitness compels Bataille to censor them."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"62Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FranceThe Fifth Temple consecrated to the Pelican, symbol of Christ’s self-immolating generosity, is a site profaned by a Masonic discourse on thevirtues of promiscuity. Bataille then visits the Temple of Rosicrucianism,historically associated with the Freemasons. As Manly Hall remarks:“It is probable that Rosicrucianism is a perpetuation of the secret tenetsof the Egyptian Hermes, and that the Society of the Unknown Philoso-pher is the link connecting modern Masonry, with its mass of symbols,to ancient Hermeticism, the source of that symbolism.”30Yet Bataille’sdescription contains no elucidation of the Rosicrucian mysteries, onlyalluding to more Vestals, more mummified fakirs, and more yawningsepulchers. Taxil credits his collaborator with considerable knowledge ofesotericism, but Bataille’s travel narrative seems aimed at atmosphericsand theatrical effects, and offers no initiatory detail about the historiclink between Rosicrucianism and Masonry.From Pondicherry, Bataille continues his tour of Palladism, travelingnext to China, which, the doctor says, is the entryway to hell, a landwhose inhabitants, despite their innocent appearance, are temperamen-tally Satanic and iniquitous by birth. Here Bataille pauses to remark thatno matter what exotic place he visits, no matter what diabolical sect hestudies, devil worshippers across the world “belong to one and the samesecret, demonic religion.”31In this way, Bataille illustrates a commonfeature of ethnocentricity: the demonization of the stranger, a tendencyto homogenize those most unlike ourselves, to find in alterity an ele-ment of sameness, to perceive in alien races and cultures a uniformunreadability. Among Chinese and Indian Satanists, there is the sameuse of intoxicants, the same exorbitant cruelty, the same magic reani-mation of the dead, oracular skeletons, zombie cannibals, mummies stillsusceptible to torture. Those who most resemble us are agreeable to lookat. They are distinguishable by little differences in physiognomy andbehavior. Those different from us are collectivized by fear and incom-prehension. Asians, Jews, and Africans all resemble one another andserve the Evil One. Thus, Taxil, taking his cue from Occidental prejudice,gathers outsiders “into the same group. Thus, Hindu fakirs, Chinese,Jews, Protestants, carbonieri, Russian or French anarchists, independentor organized Satanists like Guaïta or Péladan are all devil-worshipperswhether they belong to secret Palladian Lodges or not.”32It was precisely because of the Masons’ proclivity for secrecy that theyappeared uncanny.

What was outside is assimilated and then expelled again asexcrement, and cannibalism incorporates us into the triumphant other.As David Frankfurter writes, this “signifies the Other’s most profounddanger to us [....] In antiquity, ritual expression meant sacrifice, thecentral religious act by which a community achieved reciprocity withthe supernatural world by transferring some body or substance. But sac-rifice often implied – in the imagination of the Other – transgressionof humanity, ecstatic states when such barbarians would come togetherand, through frenzied dance, lose their reason and engage in bestial actsof violence.” Sacrifice suggested “what ‘they’ might do to ‘us.’ Ritualmight then imply the deliberate mockery or inversion of human [...]customs, and then [...] an alternative supernatural world, a dangerousand chaotic one, reciprocity with which might bring real and destructivepowers into the arena of the human and domestic.”33It is no won-der, then, that in a fin de siècle dominated by millenarian fantasies,by fears of the looming extinction of Occidental culture, by apocalypticexpectations of the coming of the Anti-Christ, there should have beensuch a proliferation of spectacular conversions, when renegade outsiderswere joyfully repatriated into a Catholic community that felt fragile andimperiled.In China, as Bataille reports, the ceremonial counterpart of the initi-ation of neophytes is the ritual slaughter of missionaries sent abroad toconvert the godless heathen. As invocations of the devil are often Massesrecited backwards, the Chinese sacrifice that Bataille witness involvesthe manufacture of a Jesuit dummy on which devotees inflict imagi-nary torture. Next, inverting the Passion, they enact the crucifixion of apig.

An English territory, Gibraltar was anatural site for debauchery and demonolatry, since to the French, theBritish were perennially the most insidious outsiders, similar in appear-ance to civilized Catholics from the continent, yet also exceptionallydepraved and given to all manner of perversion.Ante-chamber to the underworld, Gibraltar was like Charleston’s sub-terranean temple: criss-crossed by mazes of tunnels, housing alveolarworkshops in which devilish business was transacted. “The particularcharacteristic of Gibraltar,” writes Taxil, “is to be like a giant stonesponge, a human beehive with thousands of openings, riddled from sideto side, from top to bottom, with cavities, holes, grottos, and gulfs allinterconnected by a tangled network of corridors.”34In Taxil’s axial structuring of evil, Gibraltar is the place of repres-sion, the underground where transgressive acts are perpetrated out ofsight. Encounters with the monstrous require a defamiliarizing of thelandscape, trips to a terra incognita where Leviathans lurk beneath thesurface, descents into cellars, mines, and crypts where guilty impulsesare buried alive.Unlike the monster of hyper-semiosis, the creatures toiling in thesubterranean laboratories of Gibraltar are the shocking bodies of equiv-alency, between what they do and what they are. The metalworkers,smiths, and metallurgists producing obscene Palladian amulets and stat-uary are embodiments of theirpraxis, incarnations of their work site.Subconscious, subhuman, subterranean, subliminal: they are uglinessso shameful that it is unspeakable and invisible."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Hoaxer65In the Luciferian laboratories of Gibraltar, Taxil observes the arcanescience of an alchemyàrebours. Rather than expediting the refinementof base matter – acting, like the alchemist, “as the brotherly saviorof Nature,” assisting her “to fulfill her final goal, to attain her ‘ideal’,which is the perfection of [her] progeny – be it mineral, animal, orhuman – to its supreme ripening” as gold,35Palladian toxicologists per-form a science of regression, reversing the maturation of substances,returning them to the undifferentiation and formlessness of monstrousprimordialism.In the enormous stone sponge of Gibraltar, beneath a giant fuligi-nous statue of Baphomet, workers shape infernal stuff with monstrousimplements, as agent, tool, material, and design all coalesce into an evilwhose exceptionality begets a failure of description. Sublimations thatmake man bipedal, articulate, and beautiful are undone as workers turnback into hairy beasts that grunt and howl. Demonic industry engen-ders demonic laborers whose work is overseen by a goat-faced foremannamed Tubalcain, “the ancestor of Hiram, according to Masonic legend,the diabolical patriarch of iron and forges, the older brother of Vulcanfrom pagan mythology.”36Finely executed work brings a raise in salary, an increase in the alcoholration given to cynocephalic brutes. Poisoned with the devil’s elixir ofunrepression, they are released from their work cells to cavort and raveon the Gibraltar coasts amidst the devastation of hurricanes. Droolingalcohol and sweat and crime, they join together in “an infernal sara-bande of circling creatures who hold hands, whirling in the midst ofclouds, torrents of rain, and lightning bolts.”37The dance of revelers evokes images of the traditional witches’Sabbath held at country crossroads at midnight. Here again, Taxil drawson a Satanic economy of limited archetypes and plethoric meanings.When evil moves toward the absoluteness of malevolent intention andexpression, it devolves into chaos, hybridization, the disintegration ofnamed entities into excrement and confusion. Stability and coherencegive way to centrifugality and vertigo, as riotous creatures spin in cir-cles, and the witness’s nominative and analytical powers are submergedbeneath theunnamed and the unnamable.Since there is no human language adequate to convey the hideouswork of the Palladians, they evolve their own idiolect, the infer-nal lingua franca of Volapuk. Like the universal tongue pre-existingthe destruction of the Tower of Babel, it represents, Waite says, “anirreligious attempt to produceordo ab chaoby a return to unity ofspeech.”38"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"66Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FranceAmong Gibraltar’s bacteriologists – scientists who are human, artic-ulate, evolved – there is no animal instinctuality, no whirlwind dancebeneath the moon. Here chemists creating solutions that spread choleraand typhus live in cells that are tastefully decorated to give an illusionof refinement. Yet they, too, are depersonalized by the abolition of theirnames, as they are designated by two letters of the secret alphabet ofthaumaturgy. Patiently cooking and breeding new bacilli, seeds of theapocalypse, they work in up-to-date facilities, not over dusty alembics,but with test tubes and glass vials, the latest in laboratory equipment.In Taxil’s description of Palladian research into epidemiological catas-trophism, he preys on fears about the unholy alliance of the scientistand the necromancer. The medieval wizard, draped in his black robeadorned with anchors and half-moons, is telescoped into the toxicolo-gist with his white coat and gleaming instruments. What Eliade refersto as the soteriological purpose of alchemy, accelerating the pace of nat-ural processes, purifying base matter, is perverted by the Satanist whoseeks the confused state of thenigredo. For the true alchemist, matter iscrucified in the retort and, like Christ, is then reborn in higher, noblerform. “Initiatory death and mystic darkness thus [...] possess a cosmo-logical significance; they signify the reintegration of the ‘first state’, thegerminal state of matter, and the ‘resurrection’ corresponds to the cos-mic creation.”39However, in Gibraltar,material primais not tortured andbroken down in preparation for its aurefaction and ascent into perfec-tion and immortality. Rather, secret knowledge is applied in developingkilling microbial cultures which can wipe out an entire population ofseveral thousand.Taxil’s picture draws on Catholic concerns about science as the trueenemy of faith, unlike devil worship that legitimizes the religion itendeavors to destroy. The secularizing influence of medicine, chemistry,pharmacology is harnessed by Palladians, who use science in the ser-vice of the demonic. Replacing the faith that heals is the laboratorymethodology that exterminates.Yet Taxil does not persist in exploiting the paranoia of the devout, butin an effort to prove his axiom that “human stupidity knows no limit,”follows his mapping of Gibraltar’s catacombs with tales of séances andinvocations that return the narrative to the domain of the burlesque.Historians of the fin de siècle who have studied Taxil’s hoax delight inretelling the episode of the calling up of Moloch.

The ensuing voyageto Sirius, covering 52 million leagues, takes Pike to another universe, ofwhich Lucifer is the architect and in which Adonai reigns only over theunknown planet Oolis.Taxil’sSoeurs MaçonnesAt this point, Bataille’s narrative gives way to Taxil’s delineation of thestructure and ritual of contemporary European Freemasonry, beginningwith the struggle for succession after the death of Albert Pike. Taxildevotes much of his narrative to highlighting the starring role of theMasonic Sisters, assigning pride of place to the diabolical feats of twoleading Luciferian priestesses, Sophie Walder and Diana Vaughn, bothproducts of Taxil’s mendacious creativity. Taxil’s fabrication of these she-devils may well have come in response to the fin-de-siècle tendency toportray women as conduits of the supernatural and instruments of theoccult. Against a backdrop of Catholic inflexibility in matters of insti-tutional order and doctrinal orthodoxy, Catholic mystics had turned tocultivating an acute form of hyperdulia. Focusing on Mary, who warnedof the approaching world’s end, publishing treatises on medieval mar-tyrs, they also accorded a central role to female visionaries in theirfiction, as with the Satanic Madame Chantelouve in J.-K. Huysmans’sLà-bas, and Clotilde Chapuis, advocate of mystic suffering in Léon Bloy’sLa Femme pauvre(The Woman Who Was Poor). So inextricably linked wassupernaturalism with prophetesses and female oracles that Taxil’s read-ers would have easily credited Mistress Templars with astral voyages andmetaphysical revelations. To Taxil, the mysteries of Palladism were nomore preposterous than those of Christianity: “Asmodeus transportingMiss Diana Vaughn to an earthly paradise is no more extraordinary thanSatan carrying Jesus Christ himself to a mountaintop from which heshowed him all the kingdoms of the world.”41While being entirely apocryphal, Sophie (or Sapho-Sophia as sheis called by her occult soubriquet) is given a genealogical historythat establishes her predisposition toward Luciferianism.

Then a serpent encircling her neck like an ophidian collar formsletters along her spine with the coils of its tail, mystic phrases respond-ing to the queries posed by onlookers. Sophie’s function as an oracledraws on the fin-de-siècle stereotype of women as preverbal beings,unguided by intelligence. Moved by somatic impulse, by inexpressibleintuition, Sophie’s body, like those of hysterics, is a text on which occultmessages are inscribed.Besides channeling communiqués from denizens of the underworld,Sophie played another role in which she was also denied autonomy –as the matrilineal vehicle for the coming of the Anti-Christ. Wombsand lips delivering the flesh and word of Lucifer, Taxil’s women aregestational containers of beings they are incapable of fathoming.Taxil’s self-deflating comedy often interrupts portentous reports ofcosmic warfare, announcements of the coming Armageddon and theenthronement of Christ’s nemesis, with anecdotes that strain thecredulity of his most committed readers. The same vacinatrix who issuesthe following ominous message: “from me will be born, on the eighthday of the month of Paophi, in the year of the True Light 000896, adaughter who will be the grandmother of the Anti-Christ”42also receivesfrom Sister Hebe, goddess/nymph of foolishness, a bottle of holy waterwhich, if drunk, induces the vomiting of flames. Encircling the bottleis a typed note greeting Sophie, a message ending with the salutation:“Long live joy and fried potatoes!”43On the one hand, Taxil pushes the limit of hisjoyous mystification,astonished at his audience’s taste for incoherence and absurdity. On theother hand, the Palladism hoax provides a platform for analysis of thementality from which the fin-de-siècle occult craze arose. A universewhose majesty had been impoverished by science, a church desiring tofight an enemy less impalpable than empiricism, a public hungry for thetranscendental, craving entertainment and escapism – titillating hor-rors, guided tours of hell – gave hope that the end would be announcedwith the pyrotechnics of an apocalypse, not the refrigerated boredom ofentropy and exhaustion.Diana Vaughn, high priestess of PalladismTaxil’s history of Palladism contains another story of wayward-ness, transgression, repentance, and redemption, one vindicating thechurch’s power to recuperate and save. Different from the unregenerate"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The Hoaxer69Sophie, the other Masonic priestess, Diana Vaughn, seemed to re-enactTaxil’s own inspirational drama of the reformed prodigal. While Sophiehad been “a myth,” as Taxil confided to Bataille, Diana, who assumed aprominent role in the hoax, needed to be physically present, availableto church officials wishing to verify her existence and confirm the sin-cerity of her spiritual rebirth: “since at a given moment, this Luciferianwas to undergo a conversion, it was necessary to have a flesh and bloodwoman in case she needed to be introduced to someone.”44As Taxil explains, it was the professional necessities of his work thathad first put him in contact with Diana, a stenographer employed inEurope by a manufacturer of American typewriters. Lively, intelligent,cosmopolitan, quick-witted, Diana had impressed Taxil as an ideal col-laborator, and to his delight, he had found that, once apprised of hisplan, Diana enthusiastically offered her cooperation: “correspondingwith bishops and cardinals, receiving letters from the Sovereign Pontiff’spersonal secretary, telling them all kinds of impossible stories, informingthe Vatican about sinister Luciferian plots filled her with indescrib-able mirth, and she thanked me for including her in this colossalmystification.”45So convincing was Diana in her role as a Grand Palladian Mistressthat after an announcement of the appointment of Adriano Lemmi asnewly elected Pope of Freemasonry, certain Italian members of the secretorder – most notably Domenico Margiotta – reported having alreadymade the acquaintance of the Luciferian priestess and of having mether in 1899, at a reception at the Hotel Victoria in Naples.A dupe enlisted to serve as co-author of Taxil’s deception, Margiottahimself produced a detailed and engrossing anatomy of the secret soci-ety:Le Palladisme: Culte de Satan-Lucifer dans les triangles maçonniques[Palladism: The Cult of Satan-Lucifer in the Triangles of Masonry] (BibliotecaEsotérica Herrou Aragón, 1895). There Margiotta expands on the imag-inary liturgy and dogma of Palladism, documenting its history andderivation from Gnosticism, including versified hymns to Satan pennedby benighted Satanists: “Christ is the force that inspires faith, the forcederiving from perfection itself! But the God of real force, the God oftrue force, is Satan – Satan who personifies grandeur and extermination,Satan, the God of legitimate revolt!” As Margiotta concludes, “Satan isthe other half, the complement of Christ. Together they form a singlebeing, an identical whole.”46Implacable enemy of the usurper Lemmi, Margiotta had tasked him-self with unmasking Palladism, refuting its teaching that genuine saints"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"70Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Franceare those reunited withle Dieu bon, or Lucifer, living with him forever“in his kingdom of eternal fire.”47Margiotta was among those hailing Diana’s conversion and the ensu-ing collapse of Palladism. With his elaborate exposition of a secretPalladian alphabet modeled on the alphabet of the Magi of Alexandria,with his explanation of the doctrine of metempsychosis and his repro-duction of Satanist prayers, Margiotta had demonstrated that the bestperpetrators of hoaxes are often victims themselves.As for Diana, Taxil acknowledges that after assigning her the leadrole in his mystification, her influence and popularity had soared, espe-cially since, after having played the sorceress, she professed to be apenitent. As Taxil had won the trust and support of the church byconfessing to murder, Diana convinced the Vatican of her sinceritywhen she denounced Masonry as an abomination, rejected Lucifer, andembraced her childhood faith. Earlier, Diana had seemingly exhibitedindependence and piety by refusing to impale a consecrated Host on adagger, as Sophie Walder had commanded her. Declining to participatein the symbolic murder of Christ – “to kill Him palladically”48– she hadshown she was not beyond redemption, promising to serve as a futurecrusader against the iniquitous Palladian cult. As with other reformedsinners, the more heinous the wickedness, the more glorious theredemption.In herMémoires d’une ex-palladiste[Memoirs of an Ex-Palladist], Dianadescribes a miraculous colloquy with a statuette of Joan of Arc. Pledgingnever to write or speak a word disrespectful of the Virgin, beloved ofJoan, Diana had seen materialize before her eyes Baal-Zeboub, Astaroth,Moloch, and Asmodeus, still cloaked in their customary guise as angelsof light yet with faces contorted by rage. Calling Joan to defend her,Diana had heard the air rent by the roaring of lions, and the demons,reverting to their true forms as monsters with hooved feet, horns, andtails, had disappeared into the blackness while issuing the imprecationsof the damned.Accounts of such apparitions, combined with Diana’s devotion toMary, offered Catholic skeptics powerful testimony of the sincerity ofher conversion. The 1895 publication of Diana’s saccharineNovena ofthe Eucharistfurther ingratiated her to clerics proclaiming that onlydivine intervention could have saved the erstwhile Masonic Sister fromthe infernal mechanism in which she was caught.

Taxil’s explanation of the motives that inspired him toundertake his imposture is maddeningly simple, evasive, and imprecise.Claiming that his youthful aversion to Catholicism might have beenunfair and misplaced, he claimed to have sought to win the church’sfavor by infiltrating the Masons and exposing their diabolism. Moreoften, Taxil remarks on his inveterate tendencies as a joker, pleads foraudience approval of his innocent love of fun, admits to a certain per-versity in deceiving the public for no reason, and claims that playingtricks and lying are proclivities of his countrymen: “one is not a child ofMarseille with impunity,” he maintains.49No doubt the same demiurgic impulses imputed to Masons andLuciferians – the wish to topple institutions whose rules structure anddivide – appealed to Taxil as much as it did to the Palladists he invented.There is an anarchic intent in Taxil’s deflation of popes and generals,an anti-authoritarianism impelling him to castrate fathers with ridicule.Just as monumental and elaborate as the body of church law is Taxil’stowering structure of untruth that effects that law’s subversion.Taxil’s campaign treats Catholicism and Satanism equally – as massivesystems characterized by inflexibility, pomp, and dogmatism. No lesspretentious than the ceremony and hierarchical stratification of theVatican are the rigid order and stylized depravity of the secret Masonicandrogyne lodges.InLes Soeurs Maçonnes(The Masonic Sisters), Taxil describes theritual induction of theSublime Ecossaise(the Sublime Scotswoman)whose virtue had been eroded in ascending the many grades of theMasonic sisterhood. While re-enacting biblical scenes in the initia-tion pageantry – while answering questions posed by lodge officialswith ostentatious titles (President of the Aeropage, Grand Elect KnightKadosch), the inductee is initiated into the mysteries of wantonness.A secret vocabulary is learned, canticles to Venus are intoned in “ahodge-podge of declarations and chants, with low-cut costumes andtheatrical scenes of dissolute behavior worthy of the most disreputablecafé-concert.”50Like magic, whose clavicles are mysterious and unalterable, theMasonic celebration of the initiate’s induction foregrounds the disparitybetween grandiose ritual and vulgar aim.

Similarly, Taxil’sconversancy with the tenets of Satanism, his giftedness as a fabulistwhose romance adventure spanned the world highlight the authentic-ity of a talent used in the fabrication of a counterfeit. Yet as with everymystification enjoying plausibility and appeal, the artistry requiredbelongs equally to the audience. As reception theory teaches, fiction ispersonalized by consumers: embodiment of an image and visualizationof a setting are imaginative acts that singularize a text according to thereading subject. So Taxil’s hoax, in persisting both as a fabrication andits disassembly, is meaningful in accordance with the predisposition ofinterpreters.As Closson notes, Taxil’s hoax explodes the myth of JewishLuciferianism, yet the enormity of the fraud also helped to reinforceits credibility: “one reader has reproached Taxil for ‘creating the issue ofthe devil in the way that Edouard Drumont created the issue of the Jew.’This disturbing suggestion invites us to ask ourselves about the conse-quences of the Taxil affair. Did it forever cover with ridicule this typeof allegation? Or did it sow enough suspicion in people’s minds that itcontributed to the myth of a Judeo-Masonic plot that has itself becomea form of modern demonology?”51Among others, Huysmans comments that the devil shows the greatestingenuity in persuading intelligent people that he does not exist. Whatcould be more diabolical than confessing to having authored the mythof Palladism? Zombi fakirs, serpent writings, trips through space withAsmodeus are make-believe made comical at the audience’s expense.Having fooled the Pope the first time by pretending to disaffiliate fromthe Freemasons, did Taxil fool him again by convincing him that hisimposture was authentic?In his bookAesthetics of Fraudulence in Nineteenth-Century France,ScottCarpenter claims that mystification serves to inculcate incredulity. “Thiscorrosion of authority leads the victim of a hoax to experience a loss offooting – that well-known experience of having the rug pulled out fromunder one’s feet. This is, in short, the great function of mystification: itdrives cracks in the edifice of authority; it promotes a potentially cre-ative instability, pushing its victims to become ever more critical andever less inclined to take authority for granted.”52Whether the Palladism hoax spread the myth of Judeo-Satanism orwhether it undermined the same myth with derision and hyperbole, it"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"The Hoaxer73sensitized the public to the urgency of the controversy.

It was against abackdrop of Republicanism, rationalist Positivism, and the increasinglaicization of French society that interest in the occult began to flour-ish in the final decades of the nineteenth century. Among the educated,there was a growing belief that science was poised to identify the exactlaws governing the origins and destiny of the human species. Findingsin the domain of geology, astronomy, and paleontology seemed to setscience in conflict with traditional Christian teachings, opening to ques-tion, as Jean Pierrot observes, “the vision of the origins and evolutionof the world found traditionally in the Bible.”1In opposition to thistrend, occultists writing at the century’s end heralded the superiorityof supra-rational knowledge, the Gnosis that, in their view, was notattainable through reason and analysis but came only through spiritualillumination.Recourse by artists to ancient occult teachings was also motivatedby the liberalization of institutions and enactment of democratic laws.Monarchists’ receding hopes for a restoration of the true king com-bined with Catholic nostalgia for a return to conservative doctrine. Fromthese reactionary impulses emerged the Naundorff imposture, allega-tions by the self-proclaimed heir to the French throne that he was thetrue Louis XVIII, an avatar of the God who was unrecognized and dis-owned, “an example of the Lord’s Anointed suffering in ignominy, thegreat man thrown down from his high seat.”2In the works of Joséphin Péladan, the obsolescence of the aristoc-racy as a social class resulted in the cultivation of a new meritocracy ofaristes: visionaries, poets, craftsmen, priests, composers, and hermeticists74"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"The Magus75whose privilege and entitlement derived from the superiority of theirgenius.In the domain of politics, the cabinet of Jules Ferry implemented poli-cies that were anathema to the right. Liberalization of laws governingthe press prompted Péladan’s fulminations against journalism, a profes-sion, he wrote, “in which one smokes and drinks and sees lots of people,and which would resemble prostitution if only it were held in higherregard.”3Foremost among Ferry’s educational reforms was the establishmentof a system of public schools independent of the church, another secu-larizing measure perceived to be part of the government’s overtly anti-clerical positions. While often criticizing the inadequacies of Catholicinstruction, the occultists wrote their own works of mystical pedagogy,manuals for an intellectual elite destined to become the prophets, seers,and Magi of the future.The head of the church himself, Pope Leo XIII, did nothing tohelp bolster the failing spirits of the monarchists forming the coreof the occult brotherhood. In his 1892 encyclical to the faithful, Leodiscouraged Royalist resistance to Republicanism and dashed hopesof Vatican support for monarchical restoration. Urging Catholics “todesist from attacking the Republic, to accept the existing form ofgovernment, and to concentrate upon obtaining from it in consti-tutional manner the repeal of the laic laws.”4Leo’s message onlystiffened the resolve of the clergy and nobility to pursue their existingagenda.The January 1889 election of General Georges Boulanger, animpassioned adversary of the monarchist cause, further disheart-ened the intellectual aristocracy who turned increasingly from poli-tics to the timelessness of mysticism and magic. At the conclusionof J.-K. Huysmans’sLà-bas, raucous cheers of “Long live Boulanger”had risen up from the street, while, high above, in the bell-tower ofSaint Sulpice, Huysmans’s elite cadre of astrologists, doctors, novelists,and bell-ringers lamented the decline of Occidental civilization andexpressed impatience for the dawning of the era of the Paraclete. Onecan only hope for better things, as the physician des Hermies opines, for“this century does not give a fig for the coming of Christ; it adulteratesthe supernatural and vomits over the otherworldly.”5However, despite their disaffection with science and their predilec-tion for esotericism – despite yearning for the stratified society of abygone age – fin-de-siècle occultists often made common cause withthe same church officials who condemned their writings as heretical."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"76Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FranceIn place of an aristocracy of birth, they proclaimed an aristocracy ofenlightenment. And in place of magic as a practice of initiatic exclu-sionism, they affirmed the superiority of the wisdom they acknowledgedmust be shared with the people they once despised.Intellectual and spiritual nobility, formerly defined by privileges with-held, was henceforth demonstrated by generosity bestowed. Pervadingthe practice of magic was the principle ofnoblesse oblige.Astheymodeled themselves on a Messiah who had embraced the pauper, theprostitute, and the pariah, the Decadent occultists came down fromtheir high places, proclaiming “that the Gospel, the absolute type ofperceptible light, can and must be preached and heard by all men.”6Modifying the esotericism that had turned them within, they acceptedthe faith redirecting them toward their less gifted and advantaged broth-ers.Latria, or worship as service, turned the knowledge jealously guardedby the few into a new Gospel that would henceforth be preached tothe many.However, it was only gradually that the fin-de-siècle occult movementbegan to embrace the idea of selflessness and service. Indeed, the inclina-tion of Decadent writers had always been to celebrate the unique geniusof an exalted subject. In the domain of epistemology, art, politics, andsocial theory, fin-de-siècle France had hitherto witnessed a consecrationof the exceptional individual. Rejecting Emile Zola’s science-based beliefin optimism and social progress, the Decadents viewed with scorn theagitations of the masses. Despising the collectivity – reviling the ochlo-cratic expression of its will – the Decadents recoiled from social actionwith a moue of contemptuous disgust. While endorsing a theocracystructured by divine principles, administered by a priesthood of illu-minati like themselves, the reactionary Decadents approved of secularauthority only when it was concentrated in the hands of a superior,highborn ruler. As Joséphin Péladan admonishes his disciple inCom-ment on devient mage: “Governing a people must be the duty of one man:Royalty.”7As the king was the hereditary depository of wisdom, grace, andpower, the Magus was the descendant of an immemorial line of wonder-workers. Accountable to no one – detached from society and its convul-sions – the Decadent Magus assumed the task of ascetic self-perfection.Like a sovereign, the thaumaturge was autonomous and alone. Butwhile a monarch administered to an often restive and unenlightenedpopulace, the Magus accepted few disciples and acted principally forhimself.

As Péladan says:“Magic expresses the power of ipseity.”8Despite the self-ennobling rigor of his initiatic discipline, the Magusin Decadent literature is often pictured as ineffectual, endowed witha prescience that brings no ability to affect the future. The exclusive-ness of his coterie of visionary brethren precludes interaction withthose who are virtuous but weak. The enlightenment of a king ben-efits the collectivity of his subjects, but the Magus is selfish in hisquest for knowledge that is private and inaccessible. Etymologically sug-gesting his inward orientation, his esotericism directs him toward therefinement of himself.In his 1895 study,Le Satanisme et la magie, Jules Bois comments sim-ilarly on the aloofness of the Magus. Denied the solace of affiliation,love, and friendship, the Magus, as Bois describes him, appears inflex-ible and inhuman. Unlike his diabolical counterpart, the sorcerer orwizard – rooted in the telluric world of instinct, flesh, and nature – theMagus ascends to a rarefied plane of contemplative impassivity. “When,out of pity, you lower your head, heavy with eternal thoughts, towardephemeral humanity, you cause your doom. The cry of desire, the sobof mercy, the gesture of consolation bring your undoing.”9This is the paradox of fin-de-siècle white magic: the need to reconcilethe flamboyance and exhibitionism of the Magus – a self-dramatizingpersonage like Sâr Péladan – with the impenetrable hermeticism of thedoctrine he espoused. While disseminating knowledge steeped in a his-tory of secrecy, the Magus-author simultaneously aimed at concealmentand disclosure. Discouraging the profane and proselytizing the elite, heaccompanied his sibylline messages with coy gestures of explanation,setting himself above the world while deigning to address it. The publi-cation of occult treatises suggests this contradictory objective: solicitingthe curiosity-seekers whom the author warns away, promising hiddentruths to a public deemed unworthy of receiving them.The fin-de-siècle hermeticists who styled themselves as authors differ-entiated the privileged information they enveloped in cryptic languageand the book itself, which was made available to an undiscriminatingpublic. Turn-of-the-century occult literature problematizes the impor-tance of itself as product. Is the work of art the strengthened character,the enlightened mind of an adept? Is it the elevation of the writer’sstatus through the bestowal of his knowledge? Is it the text which, inbeckoning readers, passes outside the initiatic dialogue?On the one hand, the Magus/artist, in communication with an audi-ence, is able to escape the isolation to which his superiority relegates"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"78Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francehim.

In his instruction manual, Péladan assumes thisChristological role, suggesting that an author’s masterpiece is not a workbut his soul redeemed: “man has the power and the obligation to cre-ate himself anew, in accordance with what is good. One asks what theobject of life is. For a man who thinks, it can only be the occasion andthe means to remake the soul that God has given him: to sculpt it intoaworkofart.”10The sacrifice of an old identity, the second creation of oneself:Péladan’s language suggests a marriage of occult theory and Catholicism,reconciling New Testament doctrine with the highest aims of alchemy.As Manly Hall remarks in referring to the Bible: “[U]nless the elementsfirst die, the Great Work cannot be achieved; [...] unless a man be bornagain, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”11On the one hand, theMagus’s goal is the apotheosizing of himself, ascending to a higher planein the manner of a divinity. On the other, it is celebrating a commu-nion with his followers, distributing himself as the gift of knowledge heconfers on those who seek it.Following the spagyrical step of breaking down the base material, theinitiatic process begins with disassembling the apprentice, burning awayimpurities left by a regimen of social conditioning. Like baptism, whichrids the soul of original sin’s uncleanness – like fire which refines thesubstance at the bottom of the crucible – the lessons of the Magus erad-icate his disciple’s existing flaws: “Magic removes from the individualthe scoria that education left on his personality.”12Péladan deplores the fact that magic, as spiritual aurefaction, hadbeen perverted by subordinating principle to technique, substitutingthe tricks of magic and the material benefits they bring for the thau-maturge’s higher aim of sanctifying himself as a work of art. So insteadof practicing hermetic pedagogy that offers the initiate wealth and fame,promising to transform talismans and charms into gold, Péladan teacheshis follower to become the king of soul and body.The scientistWhile fin-de-siècle occultists renounced magic as showmanship, theperformative aspects of their discipline received the most popular atten-tion: clairvoyance, telekinesis, magnetism, divination.

In the com-ing hour, man would witness a synthesis “of the opposing fields ofhuman knowledge, the solemn reconciliation of two enemy sisters:Science and Faith.” So predicted Stanislas de Guaïta in an article inInitiationin 1890.13Writers like Jules Lermina, inLa Science occulte(Occult Science), arguethat esotericism was in no way incompatible with materialism. In hisargument, Lermina rejects the traditional body/spirit dualism, suggest-ing that the soul is merely matter in a subtler form. Other Decadentsadopted the Darwinian principle of evolutionary progress, positing thatthe development of the human species would result in the emergenceof more enlightened beings.Investigations into the phenomena of electricity and magnetism alsoprompted interdisciplinary research that had crossed traditional bound-aries. Belief in astral bodies, magnetic fluid, magic volition was oftenunderpinned by scientific theory bridging the visible and invisibleworld, illuminating what Jean Pierrot calls “hitherto unexplainable phe-nomena, the doubling of the medium, the power of suggestion, theability to act on bodies at a distance.”14While wishing to rehabilitatetheir studies with an aura of scientific legitimacy, writers like Papusand Péladan expressed ambivalence about the theatricality of magic.This is only one of many paradoxes characterizing turn-of-the-centuryoccultism: (1) the incompatibility of the Magus’s reclusiveness andsecrecy and the self-dramatizing ostentation of a “mystic impresario”like Péladan; (2) the occultists’ condemnation of materialism and ratio-nalism and their interest in reintegrating the physical and metaphysical;(3) the self-exalting superiority of the Magus and his recognition of thevalue of service and instruction; (4) the wish to reconcile magic as anart objectified as works and the primary goal of the Magus to effect hisrebirth on a higher plane.The most influential occultist of the century, Eliphas Lévi, was thefirst to try to resolve these conflicts, endeavoring to create a harmonybetween empiricism and mysticism. Lévi’s “true greatness,” as AlfredWaite asserts, “centres in his bold attempt to establish a harmonybetween religion and science by revealing to reason the logical necessityof faith, by proclaiming to faith the sanctity of natural reason.”15Né Alphonse-Louis Constantin, Lévi was born in 1810 in modestcircumstances as the son of a shoemaker.

Study of the Kabbalah, adoption ofthe prevailing Symbolist aesthetic helped to shape Lévi’s evolving anduniquely personal brand of esotericism.However, the capital event that allegedly turned the fledglingMagus to an immersion in supernaturalism was the manifestation,by Appolonius of Tyana, to Lévi and fellow-occultist, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, during a discussion on magic the two were pursuing one eveningin London in 1854. As Bulwer-Lytton, in the aftermath of this mirac-ulous apparition, went on to develop the Rosicrucian theory that ledto the establishment of the Order of The Golden Dawn, so Lévi, inthe interval between 1853 and 1863, produced books on magic thatwould inform the thinking of the leading occultists in fin-de-siècleFrance.As Waite argues, Lévi’s proposal to map a confluence of rationalismand magic led him to posit the existence of a vital force or subtleenergy, which – following Lévi – fin-de-siècle hermeticists often asso-ciated with magnetism. They believed that this force, when subjected tothe Magus’s will, was capable of effecting seemingly miraculous phe-nomena. Variously described as fluidic emanations, astral light, thealchemists’ Azoth, it was described by the Austrian von ReichenbachasOdwhich, in Sanskrit, means “all-penetrating.” It is this energythat operates on the boundary between the natural and supernatu-ral world, between the human and divine, and which Reichenbachsees as the point “where the demarcation between body and spiritdisappears.”16Virtually indescribable, this agency enables the Magus to intuit thecorrespondences between the material realm and a higher world. In lan-guage both imagistically rich and laboriously obscure, Lévi characterizesthis energy as “a universal plastic mediator, a common receptacle for thevibrations of movement and the images of form, a fluid and force whichmay be termed [...] the imagination of nature.”17Despite the difficultyof articulating the properties of this force, Lévi anticipates his succes-sors in stressing the Magus’s ability to harness it, to guide it with hiswill, and re-create himself in the Creator’s likeness. As Waite summa-rizes: “To know how to master this agent so as to profit by and to directits currents is to accomplish themagnum opus,tobemasteroftheworld,andthe depository even of the power of God.”18However, when entrusted to the hands of the ignorant, this energycan become a force leading to perdition.

It crowns the initiate but enslaves thefool. “It is a serpent but also a nimbus.” To master it, as Lévi writes, “wemust set a foot upon its head.”19The exclusiveness of the priesthood of fin-de-siècle Magi is rein-forced by such messages of admonishment and dissuasion. Stanislas deGuaïta, inAu Seuil du mystère, notes the inauspiciousness of dilettantism,frivolous dabbling in the occult. Like Lévi, he decries the spiritualists’evocation of the dead, which he sees as motivated by greed and dis-credited by charlatanism. He remarks that even the most experienced ofesoteric researchers may succumb to crippling acedia, undergoing peri-ods of depression: “Even an adept like Eliphas confessed, after a curiousattempt at necromancy made in 1854, to having felt a profound andmelancholy attraction to death, without, however, being tempted tocommit suicide.”20The Avant-Propos of Guaïta’s book serves the complementary purposeof cautioning seekers of hidden knowledge moved by ambition, pride,or lust, and reproving unbelievers who equate magic with gullibility.Submitting his treatise to the derision of the uninitiated, he suggestshis teachings can be unriddled only by those whose interests are sin-cere. Guaïta does not dismiss the value of magic as performance, sincea virtuoso’s demonstrations may prove convincing to the skeptic: “Theexperimenter who calmly says: ‘My heart has only to beat faster: theinvisible force that noisily moves furniture is an odic current subjectto my control. The human form that comes together in the vaporsof these scents is just a fluidic coagulation, a colored reflection of mymind’s dream, a creation of the Azoth produced by the expressionof my will.”’ Such an actor, Guaïta says, need not be denigrated asa showman, a commercial medium staging séances to entertain thecredulous. Such a one incurs no blame; instead, “he deserves the titleof Adept.”21Whether fictional characters or prospective apprentices in the occultsciences, fin-de-siècle initiates are directed toward primal causes, seekingto discern first things and understand cosmogonic origins. Study ofthe Kabbalah focuses on identifying Creation’s building blocks. Hav-ing poured over the Book of Splendor, Péladan’s Magus/hero, Mérodack,pursues his initiatic program and so “asks numbers for their laws, asksletters for their esoteric secrets.”22Returning to the oldest Kabbalistic text predating even theZohar,the Decadent occultists immerse themselves in theSepher Yetzirah,theBook of Formation translated by Papus in 1888. A foundational text orincunabulum, theSepher Yetzirahproceeds from the nameless state of"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"82Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francebeing, referred to asAin Soph, to the ten properties of the created uni-verse formed by letters, sounds, and numbers. It is the Sephirotic Treewhich, as Eliphas Lévi claims, offers the key to man’s diversity, knowl-edge of God, the world, and the self. Mystical wisdom obtained fromstudy of the Sephiroth leads back from the created world to the Cre-ator, from material reality to generative principle: “Examine all thingsby means of the ten Sephiroth. Restore the Word to Its Creator and leadthe Creator back to his Throne.”23The Decadents’ intuition of a looming end of things motivates theirquest for origins. Thus, the search for primary substances, the originalelements of Creation, syllables in the utterance by which God producedthe world leads Guaïta to infer an onomasiology of the divine. Seekingthe hieroglyphic meaning of the four letters of the Tetragram, he dividesJéhovahintoIod, God as the masculine principle of creation, the Scepterin the Tarot, the Sulfur of the alchemists;Hé, the feminine element offertility, the Cup in the Tarot, alchemical Mercury;Vau, the conjugationof male and female, the Sword in the Tarot, the Azoth of the alchemists;andHé, the fecundity of nature, completion and fulfillment, the Coinin the Tarot, the Salt of the alchemists. Following the Kabbalistic prin-ciple of letters containing endings and beginnings, the components ofGod’s name spell out the enactment of his work, letters associating “theidea of God with the idea of the universe as finality.”24Likewise, Papus,inLe Tarot des Bohémiens[The Tarot of the Gypsies], uses the elements ofthe sacred name to interpret the meaning of the Arcana: Kings, Queens,Knights, Pages, to which he assigns Pythagorean numeric values, com-menting that this first word confers on the person who pronounces it“the key to all human and divine sciences.”25The occultist’s circular itinerary is represented by the Kether, theCrown, from which God’s names all emanate, and by the ouroboros,“prototype of the primitive wheel of the Zodiac.”26These convey aninexhaustible dialectic, an endless chain of life and death orienting theoccultist toward a mythical anteriority. The quest for an inexpressiblebeatitude, a prelapsarian innocence, contrasts with the looming menaceof the apocalypse at the century’s end. Edouard’s Schuré’s biographies ofthe prophets whom he callsThe Great Initiatesbegins with the AryanCycle of Rama and concludes with the story of Jesus. Guaïta’s history ofesotericism seeks to position Decadent hermeticists along a continuumbeginning with ancient Magi, suggesting an unbroken transmission ofsecret knowledge. There is an effort to connect a present moment, inwhich magic had been discredited, to a Golden Age of wisdom knownto disciples of Solomon and Zoroaster."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The Magus83The foolFin-de-siècle occultists also wrestled with the contradictory image ofthe Magus: the evolutionarily enlightened being in possession of time-less wisdom, and the delusional dupe whose secret knowledge was onlybombastic, empty nonsense. They tended to identify with prophets whohistorically went unrecognized, ambiguous figures simultaneously dis-missible and sublime, like Maître Janus in Villiers’sAxëlwhose namesuggests his complex status.In the Tarot, the Arcanum signifying epistemological origins is theZero Card, the Fool Card, in FrenchLe Bateleur, a figure whose youthfulaspect situates him in an immemorial past – at the dawning of creationwhen confidence was wedded to intelligence. Read hieroglyphically, asLévi writes: “His head and arms form the letterא; around his head, thereis a nimbus in the form of∞, symbol of life and universal spirit; beforehim are swords, cups and pentacles, and he raises toward the sky hismiraculous staff.”27Other occultists like Papus have linked the Fool to Ain Soph, theUnknowable First Cause pre-existing God’s manifestation as his Cre-ation. The ambiguous representation of the figure, dressed in the jester’smotley garments, suggests the Decadent occultist’s plight, his being anobject of derision. The Zero Card thus images the transitional status ofthe neophyte, his standing on the threshold between ignorance andwisdom. The juggler’s costume is a bright illusion that misleads theuninitiated: “This world is a Mardi Gras – a pageantry of divine sparksmasked in the garb of fools.”28However, the Card’s significance may reside not in the image, but inthe seeker’s interpretation. To the profane, the Card is part of a deckused for amusement and distraction. The quest for knowledge is just agame when only fools decide to play it. “We must admire the wisdomof the Initiates,” as Papus has remarked, “who utilized vice and madeit produce more beneficial results than virtue.”29To the serious studentaddressed by Papus and Guaïta, the surface image of foolishness concealsa message of grave import: that Truth is not in substances, but in thecommitment to discovering it.This is the reason for Péladan’s campaign against spurious sophisti-cation, the true foolishness of those imbued with social prejudice. Theindispensable first step in “the creation of the self” is undoing a facti-tious persona that is a patchwork of erroneous ideas. The restorationof a zero state of innocence and receptivity is analogous to return-ing to the Kabbalists’ Ain Soph, and is a precondition to the work of"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"84Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Franceintelligent self-remaking. Having eliminated impostor selves and recov-ered the simplicity of being no one, the seeker undertakes the rebirth ofhis identity as a Magus. Thus, Lévi and others cite Christ’s call to his dis-ciples, his saying that those who follow him should become again likelittle children.The alchemistFor the fin-de-siècle occultist seeking to transform the Fool into the WiseMan, there was a natural fascination for the secret science of transmuta-tion. Adopting Christian teachings, alchemy described the Great Workof redemption, as the experiment also followed the death and resurrec-tion sequence, with base substances being broken down, put to death inthe retort, in preparation for their reappearance in the nobler form ofgold. Matter’s putrefaction is dressed in the blackness ofnigredobeforesuffering’s fire cleanses it and makes it subtler and more ethereal. Thus,in citing an unidentified philosopher, Jung states inAlchemical Studies:“The tortured thing, when it is immersed in the body, changes into anunalterable and indestructible nature.”30The idea of the Magus sublimating base desires, refining corruptedconsciousness buffeted by accident and impulse, is often translatedinto the image of the alchemist’s alembic. Commenting on Lévi, Waitedescribes man’s will as the Great Arcanum: “The transmutation of thephilosophical metals is not, from this standpoint, a chemical process;rather, it is a process of transcendental and mystical chemistry by theapplication of the [...] emancipated will.”31In fin-de-siècle occult writing, esotericism’s cryptic messages are oftendescribed as relating to the initiate’s moral education. Instead of acquir-ing secret knowledge enabling the adept to amass wealth and power,magic requires self-mortification, self-restraint, and self-control.Péladan’s goal is to controvert the rumor that the Society of theRose+Croix was literally engaged in alchemical experiments. Clarify-ing his position, he admonishes his disciple: “the Philosopher’s Stoneconsists in simplifying, reducing matter to its quintessence so that con-tingencies no longer affect us. Magic performs the ascetic operationof sublimating the palpable into the spiritual.”32If occultism movesalong a spectrum from elitism to humility, Péladan’s teaching of self-differentiation may occupy one extreme, while on the other, antitheticalto the individual’s quest for glory, is the devotion to service that requiresanonymity and self-effacement.In J.-K. Huysmans’s novels that deal with mysticism and Satanism, healso refers to spiritual growth as alchemical ennoblement. Taking the"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The Magus85occultist notion of mortification and self-discipline, he describes suf-fering on behalf of others as transmuting sin into redemption. At theconclusion of his hagiographic narrative of the life of Blessed Lydwine,Huysmans characterizes the saint’s torment as akin to the MagnumOpus. Enduring tumors, cancers, abscesses, weeping tears of bloodthat harden as stalactites on her cheeks, she offers her pain to has-ten the emancipation of souls from Purgatory. “The formula for thedivine alchemy of suffering is self-abnegation and self-sacrifice. After aperiod of incubation, the Great Work is accomplished. Out of the soul’sretort comes the gold of Love that consumes despondency and tears.”Lydwine’s tortured flesh becomes a catalyst. As Huysmans writes, “thetrue Philosopher’s Stone is this.”33In Huysmans’s promulgation of the doctrine of Mystic Substitu-tion, one sees how far the fin-de-siècle idea of alchemy had evolved.No longer does the adept withdraw into scornful isolation – immuredin misanthropic pride in his anchoritic lodging: “a high-ceilinged,unadorned room, with its austere wood paneling.”34Guaïta’s guidebookof instruction for the followers of Saint-Just, Péladan’s apprentice man-ual for the thaumaturgic neophyte still ostensibly address an exclusiveaudience ofaristes. But the fact that these works are published at allpresumes a dissemination of occult teaching, suggesting a reorientationfrom aloofness to collaboration. The magical asceticism that liberatesinitiates from the solicitations of the flesh becomes, inLydwine,anembrace of sinners through expiatory self-abnegation.The apocalypticThe path of the initiatic quest ceases to be circular and repetitive andinstead assumes a linearity that aims at eschatological completion. Fin-de-siècle temporality incorporates a sense of inevitable exhaustion, anirreversible decline toward hopelessness and entropy. Informed by aphilosophy of catastrophism, the mentality of the Decadents had ini-tially cast the future as a murderer of the present: “a hecatomb ofpossibilities that, one after another, are fulfilled.”35This is why theDecadent occultists adopted a model of cyclical renewal, ancient knowl-edge perpetually re-transmitted by the Magi of the present day. Thissense of history as a continuum, of magic as a confraternity of wisemen, emerges as the central principle structuring fin-de-siècle encyclo-pedias of esotericism: Schuré’s lives of the Initiates, from Krishna toPythagoras, Guaïta’sAu Seuil du mystèrethatmovesfromHermestoMadame Blavatsky, from the Emerald Tablet to Tibetan Buddhism and"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"86Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francethe lessons of theosophy. There is no end or death but passages overthresholds of mystery, ascent to a higher plane and a return to men-toring and writing The knowledge of earlier visionaries is constantlyre-acquired, complemented by insights gained from modern disciplinesand new sciences.InComment on devient mage, Péladan acknowledges his indebtednessto his predecessors while still emphasizing the uniqueness of each prac-titioner of occultism. The ascetic regimen governing the neophyte’sformation includes a program of meditation that structures daily life.The endpoint of the evolution toward spiritual perfection is completionof the initiate’s self-awareness and self-definition. There is no ecstasythat collapses the walls of individual consciousness, no ego dissolutionin the totality of things. The closer the student moves toward the light,“the more he is himself. Theosophists wrongly see evolution ending ina kind of collective Nirvana.”36Péladan’s instructions signal the tension pervading fin-de-siècleoccultism between the Magus’s development as a member of a mysticalelite and his desire to utilize his powers for the betterment of mankind.For Péladan, the initiatic process involves introspection and self-analysisthat is literally dependent on dissociation from one’s peers. At day’s end,Péladan counsels the student to take leave of his acquaintances “in orderto reclaim a personality diminished by their caresses.”37The initiate isunlike the fool who has a plethora of experiences, yet never reflects onthem, never converts their senselessness into meaning. For Péladan, self-study is like Lévi’s application of the will, an alchemical transmutationof existential data into insights. Péladan distinguishes the mystic – beat-ified by surrendering to God – and the Magus, whose spiritual disciplineentitles him to glory. Problematizing the value of catechistic writinglike his own, he says that enlightenment does not come from study-ing others’ works, but from authoring a unique self, from the “sculptingof one’s soul.”Of all the fin-de-siècle practitioners of esoteric doctrine, Péladan wasthe most concerned with his pedigree as a master. He advises appren-tices against immersion in the theory of their predecessors, warningthat study of Eliphas Lévi brings only superficial knowledge. Learningthe teachings of Paracelsus, Cornelius Agrippa, Heinrich Kunrath maycreate a learned man, but not a Magus, in Péladan’s opinion. Wisdom isnot acquired, not handed down from one’s antecedents. It is producedanew as the unique achievement of every individual. “You must createyour own magic, not because your efforts are motivated by vanity, butbecause you are seeking in yourself the originality of a work of art.”38"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The Magus87The CatholicPerhaps the most striking feature in the evolution of fin-de-siècle magicis the reconciliation of arcane practices, deemed heretical by the church,and the embrace of Catholic principles that require service to human-ity. The Magus, once a lonely figure in his elevated genius, accepts theneed to pass among the benighted masses he once disdained. Redefininginitiatic knowledge that had been the exclusive property of the elect,the occultist becomes a proselytizer who, through the sacrifice of hispride, proves his superiority by sharing his privileged knowledge withthe world. In Péladan, this becomes the missionary duty of the Magus,“our daimonic work, which is to serve as an intermediary between thisworld and the other.”39For Péladan, the development of a cadre ofaristeshad implied from itsinception the principle of its transcendence. Four years later, in the pref-ace toLe Vice suprême, Péladan’s inaugural work of fiction, he announcesmagic’s supersession by Catholic orthodoxy. Péladan resolves the tra-ditional antagonism between occultists and Catholics – the formercondemned by the clergy for heretical iconolatry, the latter taxed byhermeticists for anti-intellectualism. Péladan stipulates that Christ hadsupplanted the Wise Men who came to worship at the nativity: “Theadoration by the Magi means that esotericism must cede to the Truth.What is true and fecund in magic is found in the words that Jesusspoke, and the Gospel annuls all the clavicles and grimoires becauseit supersedes them.”40Péladan had previously subscribed to a view prevalent among theDecadents: that religious education fostered uncritical submissiveness,acquiescence to church doctrine that bred incurious passivity. As Papuswrites in defending magic against denunciations by the church: “AtSaint-Sulpice, one does an admirable job of shaping the will andstrengthening the heart. The education of the soul is conducted to per-fection, but the mind is completely neglected. Worse than that, it isfeared, and what is taught is ignorance.”41In his instruction manual, Péladan strives to achieve a working syn-thesis between the intellectual training required of the initiate andobedience to Catholic teaching expected of the faithful. He no longermakes a distinction between the mystic and the Magus, between theego mortification of the saint and the apotheosis of an adept crowned inglory. Having schooled his students in the discipline needed for the re-creation of the self, Péladan acknowledges that they are shaped by forcesmore powerful than themselves: “In vain the selfish person wishes to"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"88Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Franceraise himself up without dedicating himself to anything; the dilettanteseeks to gain refinement without ever loving others. The highest stagein any journey can be completed only through an act of self-sacrifice.”42Following the ordering principles of much of occult teaching,Péladan’s initiatic stages are based on God’s three successive Kingdoms.According to Vintrasian doctrine, the era of the Paraclete – the Ageof the Holy Spirit – following the Age of God, the Father, and God,the Son – will fulfill the messianic promise and usher in a time ofspiritual perfection. According to Papus, these ages correspond to thetripartite organization of human beings: the physical body, “which sup-ports all the elements constituting an incarnated man;” the astral bodythat animates them, and the psychic energies that move them – “theMind, synthesizing in itself the three preceding principles, is enlight-ened by Intelligence and served by Will and thereby governs the entireorganism.”43In Péladan’sTernaire du Saint-Esprit(The Ternary of the Holy Spirit),he begins with the time of God, the Father, when man was ruled byinstinct, when humans had not evolved beyond their bodily existence.An era of commandments and punishments had served to regulatecorporeal beings, dominated by sexual urges and homicidal impulses.Original sin, for Péladan, is nothing other than the state of incarnation:“Thus, in order to wipe away original imperfection, we must use our willso that we rise from the level of an organism to the level of a species, nolonger limiting ourselves to living from sensations that are exclusivelyorganic.”44Péladan’s depiction of this early phase in the development ofmankind becomes a pretext for more vituperation against jingoisticpatriotism, the false god of the nation/state repudiated by the Magus,“the faithful knight of Providence.”45InLe Vice suprême, Father Alta, the spiritual confederate of Mérodack,tells his congregants that the age of spiritual crusades is not over: “Onemight answer me by saying that this is no longer the age of the defenseof the Holy Sepulcher. But as long as there is a duty to fulfill, as long asthere is a weak person to help, there is a place for the crusader. If civi-lization has taken away your sword, take up the pen. Raise your voice inorder to magnify the Word of God in a work, as long as it is useful.”46Following the Reign of God, the Father, the age of instinctual repres-sion, comes the age of God, the son, who teaches Christian love oragape.Until the Messiah returns in glory, the survival of man’s spiritual beingentails Dolorist suffering, by which the world’s sins can be redeemed. ForHuysmans, this continuation by the faithful of Christ’s Passion enactswhat Christian Berg refers to as a “victimal theodicy,” whereby original"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The Magus89debt is liquidated, “offset by suffering and sorrow.”47Péladan charac-terizes this era as one where mercy succeeds justice, and severity givesway to humility – “harshness toward oneself must not be extendedto one’s neighbor.”48The ascetic rigor with which the Magus con-trols his appetites is a personal manifestation of Christ’s “voluntaryholocaust.”49Heralding the dawning of the era of the Paraclete is a definitive over-throwing of ochlocratic rule. Tyrants will be cast down, the state will nolonger subjugate its citizens, and the church will no longer be guided bythe unlettered and superstitious. After the Father’s Kingdom, groundedin a discipline of the body – after the era of the Son that witnessed a flow-ering of brotherhood – comes the Third Age of the Holy Spirit crownedby a triumph of intelligence. “Future saints will be theosophists andgeniuses; the power of the simple is no longer. The future belongs tothe sages.”50Esotericism, no longer required to disguise its majesty with gim-mickry, stands revealed, and the Fool is superseded by the Arcanumof the Magus. The card itself suggests the hierophantic role that hewill play: transmitting celestial knowledge, indicated by the right handpointing skyward, delivering it to the people, toward whom his left handis directed. The Magician, simultaneously oriented toward the heavensand the earth, becomes a figure illuminating the occult principle of uni-versal Analogy. As it is above, so it is below.Quod superius sicut quodinferius.Jean Pierrot cites the centrality of this fin-de-siècle occult tenet, as itdefines the operational role of the Magus asmicroprosope, “creator of thesmaller world.”51The doctrine of Analogy, as Pierrot observes, informsthe theory of the Symbol, “which, through the interplay of vertical cor-respondences, makes each object in the visible world the material sign ofan invisible reality.”52Likewise, the Magus/poet, armed with knowledge,ascends to a plane of higher truth, before returning to the phenomenalworld where he disseminates his insights. The book of occult teachingretains this referential property, revealing in material form, dressing inthe language of the tribe, a transcendental wisdom that is essentiallyinexpressible.Like Péladan, Jules Bois affirms that the ascendancy of the Maguswill coincide with the inauguration of the reign of the Holy Spirit. Butwhile Péladan boasts of descending from a line of Chaldean initiates,while he insists on the formation of an apostolate of artist/geniuses,Bois asserts that the future Magus will be divested of his pomp.

The ThirdAge of the Paraclete may see the adept’s vindication, but until then,the sage must acquiesce to his imprisonment in the senses, as he com-mingles with the people to whom he prophesies of things to come.By interacting with the public, by accepting the fact of his incarnation,he rejects the Gnostic heresy and joins Christ in suffering the Passion.Stripped of the opaqueness of secret symbols, the guiding principleof fin-de-siècle magic is to hasten man’s rebirth as a more disciplinedmoral being. Right action, fraternal love disengage him from the flesh,enabling the “etheric, fluidic body” to clarify and grow lighter, allow-ing an escape from the dismal cycle of embodiments, establishing the“kingdom of glorified souls and pure spirits above and below, in heavenand on earth.”54The teacherHere, the Decadent hermeticists justify the redemptive value of theirteachings, books that elevate readers out of their instinctuality andautomatism, that effect man’s death to his animal nature and his resur-rection as light and spirit. The magic catalyst, the Philosopher’s Stone,is not the content of these writings, but their transformative capacity tochange enslavement into freedom.In Eliphas Lévi, this agent is referred to asle Verbe, the divine languageof theLogosacquiring transitivity and power. “In the beginning was theWord, says the Gospel of Saint John,” a word which, as Lévi says, “expressesat once both being and action.”55For Lévi and his followers,le Verbeis the agent of a magical trans-formation, liberating meaning hidden in the heart of experience."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The Magus91Transmuting existential data into intelligibility and significance,l’alchimie du Verbe(the alchemy of the Word) effects a passage from fleshto spirit.

Likewise, God, the Son, suffers so that he may reappear asLogos.If, as Jung notes, the “lapis may [...] be understood as a symbol of theinner Christ,”57that being may be freed when man undergoes a baptismby fire.The fin-de-siècle occultist, in his attention to catalytic forces – poeticvisions of the coincidence of the Analogic planes of high and low –emphasizes magic, not as wisdom to be possessed, but as energies to bereleased. Purification of the astral body enables decomposed matter to beregenerated. Poetry effects the rebirth of referents transmuted into sym-bols. These processes augur the end of the era of the incarnated Christand the beginning of the age of the Holy Spirit when, as Huysmans’shero, Durtal, forecasts, there will be beings unstained by original sin,beings who will no longer need to be tested in the fires of pain andsuffering.Turn-of-the-century occultists, who focus on movement and transi-tion, climbing and descending, passing between the upper and lowerrealms, saw their writing as raising up the ignorant, as bringingdown knowledge from above. Even the dubious Vintrasian doctrine of“redemptive ascension” works on the Christological model of transmut-ing instinct, sin, and license into purification and self-sacrifice. Thus, asGuaïta reports inLe Serpent de Genèse, the great secret and foundationalprinciple of the sect, is to work this transformation: “It was as a conse-quence of a guilty act that the Fall in Eden came about; it is through an act oflove performed in the name of religion that Redemption will be achieved.”58Guaïta may condemn the rite for authorizing all manner of orgiasticexcess – bestiality, adultery, incubism, and incest. But in its conception,ascensional redemption enacts the occultist goal of joining high andlow, since one engages in acts of love: “with higher spirits, the elect ofthe earth in order to ‘celestify oneself’ [“se célestifier”] and with profaneor inferior spirits, of an elemental or animal nature, in order to ‘celestify’these fallen beings.”59While reproving Vintras’s followers for their cynical acts of sacrilege,Guaïta patterns his own mission on a similar premise, moving along“Jacob’s double ladder whose highest rungs are lost in the clouds.”60Like God, who so loved man that he became flesh and gave his Son,the Magus/prophet is an archangel re-descending from the firmamentto the world. These men come down, “like Moses, who, having seen the"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"92Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francelight, wears its reflection on his face.”61Modeled on Christ, “son of theWorld,” they bear witness to the truth and thereby create “the childrenof Heaven.”62For many fin-de-siècle esotericians, the requirement to do serviceinspired attempts to wed magic and faith. As Eliphas Lévi writes, knowl-edge and intuition, reason and devotion are the two pillars of Solomon’sporch. Separate, Lévi writes, “they are one sustaining force, but joinedtogether, [they] mutually destroy each other.”63The objective of theMagus is to effect a synthesis of opposites, to overcome dualities, andthereby recreate the Androgyne.Among the fin-de-siècle Catholics who ventured into occult studies,Villiers, Péladan, and Huysmans all ended by subsuming initiatic knowl-edge to orthodox Catholic teaching. Moving from grimoire to Gospel,they made professions of their faith, continuing their occult practicesonly when they served the interests of the church. Péladan advises hisacolyte never to “leave the bosom of the church,” adding that magic,the crown of faith, “would have no foundation without the edifice ofreligion.”64InLe Vice suprême, Péladan illustrates the alliance forged between theMagus and the priest, when, in an effort to stem the spiritual degenera-tion of western culture, Mérodack, the thaumaturge, visits the visionaryFather Alta and, in the sacristy, the two embrace and pledge mutualcooperation.The spiritual itinerary of J.-K. Huysmans follows a similar trajectory.After the early stirrings of religious hunger, the nostalgia for belief, revul-sion for the material crassness of his era, Huysmans had been attractedto Catholicism by his love of iconography, by the moving simplic-ity of plainchant, by Chartres’s soaring Gothic architecture. However,Huysmans’s spiritual awakening was also sparked by his exposure tothe secrets of sorcery and the rituals of Satanism. It was only afterhis descentlà-bas– into the sordid underground of necromancy –that he was propelledlà-hautin his quest for the immaculate anddivine.Like other contemporary artists, Huysmans was disheartened by thearidity of rationalism, but the course of his conversion had been slow,and faith elusive. It was his exposure to black magic, fictionally trans-posed inLà-bas, that had raised the skeptical naturalist out of hisdissatisfied incredulity. In his dealings with Joseph Boullan, successor toVintras, Huysmans had been introduced to demonomancy and bewitch-ment. Embroiled in occult warfare with Stanislas de Guaïta, he believedhe was besieged by malignant larvae, subjected to invisible attacks, and"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The Magus93so had learned of apotropaic magic that warded off spells cast by hisenemies.InLà-bas, there is an overlap of Catholic and occult practices thatshows the author sensitized to supra-rational phenomena. Huysmans’sprotagonist, Durtal, is instructed by an astrologer in the techniquesdeployed in exchanges of spells. He hears of the ornithomantic use oftercels, sparrow-hawks, and falcons that alert a potential victim that adanger is approaching.Ceremonial magic was embedded in Catholic liturgy, and cryptic bib-lical allusions appealed to Huysmans’s sense of mystery. Enactment ofthe Sacrifice to the Glory of Melchizedek had warded off the evil spiritsby which Durtal felt himself assailed, reminding Huysmans’s characterof the Genesis King of Salem, who, as Christ’s precursor, had performeda variation on the Eucharistic feast. “He is without father or motheror genealogy, and has neither beginning of days nor end of life, butresembling the Son of God he continues a priest forever.”65Huysmans’s experience with Satanism had persuaded him of a truththat Péladan advances at the conclusion ofle Vice suprême,thatevilis done aggressively, while good can only act defensively. Likewise,Eliphas Lévi, in his endorsement of Catholic doctrine, confirms thatonly religion can be a force for good, whereas magic is often mis-used, its teachings perverted and profaned, its techniques utilized formaterialistic, selfish purposes.The frequent fin-de-siècle supersession of magic by Catholicism isattributable in part to disenchantment with Positivism’s clarity. Theimpenetrability of much of occult doctrine – the concealment ofalchemical operations in theriomorphic symbols, the Kabbalists’ assign-ing value to the relation between letters and numbers – is used tofrustrate dilettantes and confound the profane. The unfathomabilityof religion, inhospitable to reason, expresses “a reaction against scien-tific literature and its insolent denials of the spiritual.”66Rather thanthe orderliness of liturgy, the comprehensiveness of dogma, it was themajesty of mysticism that beckoned the fin-de-siècle seeker, drawinghim to matters otherworldly and sublime. The intuition of analogies,the apprehension of correspondences afforded knowledge not obtain-able through observation and analysis. “It was a matter of re-affirmingthe importance of certain aspects of the human soul, everything havingto do with sensibility, everything affecting the imagination, every-thing that the evolution of western thought had tended to repress.”67Exceptional states of consciousness – hallucination, synesthesia, hyp-nagogic trances – allowed glimpses of the beautiful that were only"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"94Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francecommunicable in poetry. In its marriage of art and magic, fin-de-siècle esotericism ended by turning toward expression, communion, anddisclosure – renouncing the concealment of knowledge etymologicallysuggested by the wordoccultism.Villiers de l’Isle-Adam’sAxël(1890) illustrates the false dichotomyencountered by the Decadents in their experiences with magic. On theone hand, there is the power conferred by learning the mysteries ofRosicrucianism, and on the other, the liberating submission to therequirements of Catholic faith. In his own life, Villiers had been trou-bled by the prerequisites for conversion: sacrifice of intelligence, blindconformity to church doctrine, acceptance of a life of obedience andpenury, ascetic renunciation of the pleasures of the senses.A native of Saint-Brieuc, Villiers was born in 1838 into an illustriousand increasingly indigent Breton family, and the material challengeshe encountered in childhood only worsened over time, ending whenVilliers died of cancer in a hospice for the poor in 1889. Villiers’saristocratic ancestry, his militant antipathy for Comtian positivismprepared the place he would assume in the fin-de-siècle occultist move-ment. Profoundly influenced by Charles Baudelaire, whom Villiers metin Paris in 1860, an impassioned devotee of Richard Wagner, Villiersevolved his own brand of turbulent Romanticism that would be fur-ther refined by his study and appreciation of the esoteric works ofEliphas Lévi.Axël, Villiers’s posthumously published drama, offers the fullest expo-sition of the author’s belief in the magic power of personal thoughtand will. Opposing the masses’ herd-like submission to the demandsof objective reality, Villiers asserts the prestige of the Magus’s superiorintelligence, the acuity of his higher perceptions. Thus, in the drama,the postulant Sara is summoned by the Archdeacon to relinquish “thearrogant insistence on contemptible reason.”68The profession of one’sfaith is both a suicide of the intellect, and the ultimate creative act,as the Archdeacon explains: “Isn’t believing the same as projecting theobject of belief and realizing oneself in it?”69In Villiers’s book, religious affirmation is like the Magus’s self-engendering: authorship of a second self that is boundless and divine.As crucifixion precedes rebirth, an abandonment of the search forknowledge is a necessary precondition to spiritual awakening. Humil-ity leads to exaltation. Renunciation bestows life everlasting. But likethe fin-de-siècle occultist who rejected the immolation of the thinkingself, Sara declines the Archdeacon’s offer of Light and Hope and Life,choosing to complete alone the work of personal self-perfection."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The Magus95For Axël, the tempestuous aristocrat in his impregnable forest castle,the appeal of supernaturalism involves initiatic training by the Magus,Maître Janus. The Rosicrucianism popularized by Péladan and Guaïtahad appealed to Villiers, and references to the secret sect proliferate inhis drama. During her conventual interment, Sara had poured over for-bidden Rosicrucian texts. And when she escapes, she arrives at Axël’scastle bearing a rose that had blossomed in the snow. Laying it over acruciform dagger she was wearing on her belt, she comments on theRose and Cross, and their ancient mystic symbolism: “a Sign that, longago, had caused the proudest empires to crumble.”70In his interpretation, Alan Raitt asserts that these esoteric referencesare used atmospherically, suggesting at most a figural marriage of roman-tic love and spiritual suffering. But when combined with Villiers’sfrequent allusions to alchemical transmutations – when set in the con-text of a drama centering on the symbolic discovery of a fortune ingold – the Rosicrician thematic assumes a new and deeper meaning.In his encyclopedia of occultism, Manly Hall reproduces an illustra-tion of the Rosicrucian Rose from the foundational text theGeheimeFiguren des Rosenkreuzer. Showing a rose, symbol of fecundity and purity,whose ten petals are open and separated, the picture, Hall says, suggestscompletion of the process of “spiritual unfoldment.” In a manifest ref-erence to alchemy, “the golden heart within the midst of the flower”corresponds, Hall adds, to the “spiritual gold concealed within [...]human nature.” In a story concluding with the two lovers’ suicide andthe simultaneous celebration of their servants’ nuptials, the idea ofdeath and rebirth is conveyed by the setting of the last scene at day-break, as the sunlight of a new dawn glints off gold coins rolling acrossthe flagstones. In this context, Hall’s comments on the mystical Roseassume a greater significance, since for the Greeks, the flower symbol-ized “sunrise,” while in Apuleius’s theGolden Ass, the donkey is cured of“his foolishness” – is able to regain “his human shape by eating a sacredrose given him by Egyptian Priests.”71In Villiers’s text, Axël declines the role of the Magus and is insteaddisguised as a Fool, until he attains what he believes is the golden radi-ance of spiritual purity, rejecting material things and choosing deathout of love. Villiers’s novel unfolds inThe World of Religion,The Worldof the Occult,andThe World of Passion, and each realm requires of itsadherents an absolute sacrifice of self and will. The theme of suicideinforms each part of the narrative: the postulant taking the veil consentsto her inhumation in the convent’s in-pace, as she is asked “to crucifyher mortal life by eternally re-enacting the divine sacrifice.”72Likewise,"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"96Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FranceJanus entreats the initiate to renounce “the double illusion of Gold andLove,”73disengaging himself from time and Becoming, thereby escapingthe curse of cyclical incarnations. Speaking in the esoteric idiom of theadept, he urges Axël to rise into the Increate and realize himself in hisastral light.Like Péladan, who had deprecated magic as technique, Janus urgesAxël not to overvalue the material evidence of occult knowledge, notto equate it with protective pentacles, electuaries, potions constraininglove, the Elixir of Long Life, “la Pierre Philosophale,” the Magisterium ofthe Sun. The true Magus, Janus says, does not know passion. He is notentangled in attachments. Housed “beneath the veils of an organism, ina prison of relationships,” he aspires to die “as an ascetic, of the deathof the Phoenix.”74So, like Sara, when Axël is called to profess his com-mitment to esotericism, accepting the Light, the Hope, and the Life, he,too, says no. As interment in the cloistered life had been presented as aform of suicide, so the vocation of Magus also entails self-annihilation,abandonment of humanity, a renunciation of affection, singularity’s dis-solution in the universal. The fruit of the Tree of Knowledge is cold, asAxël says.Thus, when Villiers presents the climactic scene in which the loversswallow poison, then fall to the floor, the suicide motif has alreadyassumed a deeper resonance. Like magic, whose secrets are inexpressible,love is selfish, private, an expression of an impulse toward social suicide.Rather than death, what Villiers’s text extols is the beautiful expressionof a death wish, literature’s surviving the morbidity of its material.In the epithalamial duet that Axël and Sara perform together, theytranspose their love into poetry. Speech assumes the poignancy andsensuality of lived experience, as Sara intuits that describing imaginaryidylls in remote places is preferable to visiting them, to living a lovedoomed to disenchantment. She hymns a fantasy of a lovers’ hideawayin Ceylon amidst vermilion towers enveloped by flocks of macaws withplumage the color of fire. She dreams of founding a new religion onthe riverbanks of the Ganges. She imagines a strange and distant lifetogether in the porcelain edifices of Yeddo. Villiers’s text illustrates thealchemical power ofle Verbe, refining lived events, sublimating theminto poetry, transfusing the characters’ deathly love into the vitality ofits description.Sara’s sumptuous language issues an invitation to a banquet, cups ofhappiness to drink, bouquets of pleasures to pick. But Axël sees herwords as putting to death the experiences they call to mind, sayingthat her dreams are too beautiful to come true. However, the fact that"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"The Magus97Villiers’s text survives the suicide of his characters shows the fate of turn-of-the-century magic, both as knowledge and expression. What Axëlspurns as a compromise, a profanation of idealism – the banality of alife only servants need experience – emerges in Villiers’s drama as a trea-sure of coins and diamonds, a valueless existence aurefied by purposeand sacrifice.ConclusionIn Huysmans, the Dolorist martyr’s gift is to live and suffer, not tohurry death that delivers her into ecstasy and silence. The Magus, whosesuperior knowledge raises him above the uninitiated, does not finishhis formation until he comes back down, passing among the peopleto whom he imparts his wisdom. For Péladan and Guaïta, the enno-bled sage is elevated, reborn as a teacher. The lesson of Christ’s life asrecounted in Schuré is that the Master, Son of God, accepts his missionas the Son of Man. For the Magus, the privileged self must die to bereincarnated as his servants.InComment on devient mage, Péladan still strikes his prideful tonewhen he predicts the evolution of a new art that will be loftier and finer:“literature, science, art: all must be raised above the level of the massesso that a new aristocracy may appear, that alone will be literate, thatalone will be knowledgeable, that alone will be creative.”75But by itsexistence, Péladan’s text bears witness to his wish to disseminate occultteachings and expand the circle of initiates. As with gold, which is atonce a metal and a symbol of higher consciousness, the occult workis an object which catalyzes spiritual growth. The Magus may remainenclosed in the austere solitude of his knowledge. The mystic may dis-appear into the blissful autism of his vision. But the Magus/mentor likePéladan, the author/convert like Huysmans leave behind their work asa treasure enriching those that find it.

By magnifying qualities that"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"98Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Franceset apart a privileged subject, the Decadents celebrated uniqueness asboth a stigma and a sign of election. In literature, Remy de Gourmontdeveloped an overwrought style that strove for lexical singularity andexpressive individualism. In philosophy, Villiers de l’Isle-Adam pro-moted the idea ofIllusionism, the conviction that every person, confinedto the prison of his consciousness, was free to create a world in harmonywith his beautiful subjectivity: “Henceforth every consciousness wouldbe locked inside its own representations, unable to decide if they corre-sponded to an objective reality or if they were nothing more than emptyphantasms.”76From Villiers as well came a philosophical formulation of radical sub-jectivism that gained currency among his Decadent contemporaries.Propounded most explicitly inTribulat Bonhomet, Villiers’ view com-bined the Hegelian principle that “the essence of the real is by naturespiritual”77with Eliphas Lévi’s view that the superior man shapes theworld with his will, and that his intelligence extends onto the astralplane and into the world of the dead. Those influenced by Villierssaw religion as personally determined, asserting that doctrine no longerdepended on the incontrovertibility of revealed truths but was indistin-guishable from what each worshipper willed himself to believe. SinceGod was a divine concept, since the reality of that concept derived from“the will and intellectual perspective particular to each living being,”78the divinity was brought to life by the convictions of the faithful.However, Decadent epistemology became increasingly undemocratic, asartists retreated further into the shrine of their point of view. The real-ity of other people – deemed illusory and chimerical – was regardedas a matter that was both undecidable and uninteresting. Whereasnaturalism advanced the view that knowledge was collectively sharedand ratified, the Decadents turned to information sources that wereprivate and exclusive.The fin-de-siècle fascination with occultism reflected the Decadents’gravitation toward intellectual claustration, as the highest truths wereseen as those attainable to the fewest, and articulation of those truthswas the prerogative of an elite. Between Huysmans’s des Esseintes(Arebours1884), the embodiment of self-sequestering aestheticism,and Mérodack, Joséphin Péladan’s model of thaumaturgic misanthropy,there is little difference in the characters’ jaundiced outlook on theworld. Both feel like exiles in a materialistic era of herd-like conformity.Both are vatic predictors of the coming cultural apocalypse, forecast-ing the shipwreck of civilization in a sea of ochlocracy and irreligion.Yet, whereas des Esseintes is made sick by his prideful isolation, feeling"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The Magus99oppressed by being cut off from the metaphysical truths he intuits butcannot grasp, Mérodack is serene in his self-sufficient wisdom.However, the development of Péladan’s character follows the refine-ment of his views on magic, as he gradually abandons the Decadents’insistence on a self-immuring subject and comes to harness occultismto a commitment to work in the service of his brothers.A native of Lyon, Péladan (1858–1918) was born into a familygiven to occult pursuits and dire prognostications of France’s future.An ardent Legitimist and self-styled disciple of Nostradamus, Louis-Adrien Péladan, father of the author, exercised an enduring influenceon his son with his Catholic Illuminism and his predictions of anapocalypse soon to engulf Paris in a rain of fire and sulfur. Imbuedwith his progenitor’s reactionary political views and prophetic mys-ticism, Péladan fils embarked for Paris in February 1881, making theacquaintance the following year of Barbey d’Aurevilly, who appreciatedPéladan’s fiction but deplored the obscurantism of his views on magic.In the capital, Péladan maintained a liaison with Henriette Maillat, themodel for Huysmans’s Satanic Madame Chantelouve, who appreciatedthe Sâr’s visionary insights while complaining of his unremarkable viril-ity. He collaborated with Stanislas de Guaïta in his esoteric researchand became a member of the Occult Council of the Twelve of theKabbalistic Rosicrucians, who banded together to deflect the mysticassaults ostensibly launched against them by the diabolical Abbé JosephBoullan.Undertaken in 1884, Péladan’s multi-volumeEthopée, La Decadencelatine, provided a forum for his singular theories on androgyny, sacredprostitution, and neo-Albigensian Gnosticism. As an art critic, a strik-ingly histrionic personage, a mystic pedagogue, and indefatigable nov-elist, the Sâr captivated the public with his vestimentary eccentricities,alienated his fellow hermeticists with his bombast and flamboyance,and deluged fin-de-siècle students of magic with writings at once pre-posterous and profound, comical and insightful. When Péladan died ofcomplications of an alimentary infection in 1918, he had bequeathedon the public a breathtakingly diverse collection of sacred tragedies,treatises on theocracy, lovemaking, and politics, as well as some thirtyvolumes of occult fiction.It is primarily by following the arc of Péladan’s novels that readers canbest appreciate the Sâr’s evolving view of magic, as it changes from a signof privilege and specialness segregating the adept from the uninitiated,to a set of skills used collectively for the betterment of mankind. In thedifferent facets of Péladan’s identity as a metaphysician and a showman,"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"100Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Franceone can trace the development of his creative ideology. After projectingan image of an impenetrable and self-isolating sage, Péladan describesthe Magus as increasingly interacting with the public, an audience sus-taining him in the displays of his superiority. Both Péladan and hisfictional avatars address a circle of cognoscenti: the politically enlight-ened, admirers of sublime art, a select community of Catholic brethrenwho share his ideas about religion.The first stage in the Sâr’s development as hierophant and teacherended with a realization that the Magus not only accumulated secretknowledge but also needed to recruit disciples with whom that knowl-edge could be shared. The theatricality and flamboyance of the Sâr’scontroversial public image conveyed an awareness that the prophet’swisdom required disciples to appreciate it – intuition by the narcissistthat he could not do without his mirror.The second phase of the Sâr’s career was marked by his develop-ment as an aesthete, and was defined by his activity as an art critic andorganizer of Salons, which Ingeborg Kohn describes as “artistic extrav-aganzas that combined the visual arts, musical programs and theatricalperformances.”79Yet when not confined to the domain of ostentatious exhibitionsand performances – celebrating Wagner and popularizing elitist art –Péladan used his works as vehicles to voice his anti-Republican senti-ments. An enemy of Jules Ferry and his policy of colonial expansion,the Sâr was similarly antagonistic to Pope Leo XIII, whom he saw as tootepid a partisan of the Royalist agenda. Péladan’s positions on divorce,his denunciations of tauromachy, his belief that the Papacy need notbe centered in Italy but that it should represent Catholicism worldwidewere themes he incorporated into his polemical fictional works. In hislater novels, Péladan’s heroes embark on reckless political intrigues,ill-thought-out campaigns that inevitably meet with failure.The derision that usually greeted Péladan’s unsuccessful forays intopublic life no doubt caused him to refocus his proselytizing efforts.Not surprisingly, the final phase of Péladan’s authorial development sawhis heroes leave the treacherous world of political agitation in favor ofthe controlled domain of occult Catholic pedagogy. Notwithstandingthe Sâr’s profession of adherence to church orthodoxy, he defined hisrole as restoring the original purity of Catholic doctrine, returning thefaithful to the integrity of the church’s foundational principles. Untilthe end, Péladan perceived his role as an enlightened pastoral oracle,a visionary whose superiority was proved by the generous bestowal ofhis wisdom. But in his conception of the Magus as a missionary and"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The Magus101a teacher, Péladan was finally able to embrace the idea of sacrifice andservice.In his fiction, Péladan ultimately shows how magic and religion com-bine in a syncretistic fusion, as the Rosicrucian brotherhood that hisprotagonist, Mérodack, establishes seeks to advance the Catholic prin-ciples that the church, as an institution, could not implement. Fromsingularity to community – from individual impotence to group action –magic is increasingly utilized as a tool that ameliorates and instructs.Masters of arcane teaching still constitute an aristocracy, but they makecommon cause to promote art and thwart iniquity. Acting in imitationof Christ, the Magus accepts the noblest hardship in the immolation ofhis pride. Thus, Péladan’s sage displays his greatness in acquiescing tohis diminishment “for the highest expression of the will is to consentto pain and death even at the expense of one’s dignity. There is nothinghigher than self-sacrifice on behalf of an impersonal ‘everyone.”’80Magic as powerHowever, at the outset, the Sâr seemed disinclined to accept such fra-ternalist self-abnegation, and in the opening chapter ofComment ondevient mage, he conveys no Christian self-deprecation. Despite denyingthe heterodoxy of his beliefs – despite professing submission to Catholicdoctrine – the object of the Sâr’s encomium is his own worthiness andglory. While Christophe Beaufils notes that Péladan came from “oldProtestant stock”81and counted among his ancestors shoemakers, farm-ers, and hatters, the Sâr himself stressed his affiliation “with the sacredrace of the Chaldeans.”82Already defining the Magus’s role as both tutelary and sacerdotal,Péladan claims that studying occult tradition accomplishes a secondbaptism. While the sacrament washes away original sin, magic absolvesthe initiate of the blemishes of social conditioning, undoing the damagecaused by a university education, by the homogenizing effects of mili-tary training, rescuing the neophyte from the ignominy of a career inpolitics or journalism.Personality types governed by planetary influence and labeled withthe names of the leading characters in theEthopée, Péladan’s studentsare divided by seven astral signs, determinants of temperament, spe-cial skills, and vulnerabilities. While describing the neophyte as a childof the constellations, Péladan claims that magic is a technique which,when mastered, can counteract “the malignant influence of a star thatdetermines in an individual his irresistible propensities.”83More than"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"102Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francethe forces of astrological predestination, what Péladan deplores are thebaneful effects of socialization. In frequenting the racetrack, the brothel,thecafé-concert, the gaming table, Péladan’s disciple succumbs to thelure of stupefying pleasures. It is in order to combat these deleteriousinfluences that the Sâr lays out his program of magic as metaphysicalhygiene, returning the catechumen to a state of innocence before under-taking his regimen of spiritual retraining. Péladan contrasts the worldof men, with its vices and distractions, and the exclusive realm of theoccultist, set apart by secret knowledge.InL’Occulte catholique(The Catholic Occultist1902), Péladan’s decriesmagic’s appeal as spectacle or show, satisfying a practitioner’s desires tomystify and dazzle. He denounces the use of magic to enrich oneself andenslave another: “Grandier’s enchanted Rose, Flamel’s acts of transmu-tation: these are what sustained the Maréchal de Rais in his abominableundertakings and what continue to dazzle the minds of weak-mindedpeople up to the present day.”84But elsewhere in his writing, Péladanexalts the Magus as dramatic hero, whose displays of esoteric skillsenchant and terrify his peers.Despite pro forma condemnations of magic as performative virtuosity,Péladan uses his fiction to showcase the Magus’s dramatic capabilities.Péladan’s alter ego, the impenetrable Mérodack, exhibits an impressivearray of arcane skills: harnessing magnetic energies to disarm an adver-sary, observing disturbances on the astral plane, using a clairvoyant torecount the details of a secret crime, performing insufflations to mitigatethe trauma of a victim. After he disables a perpetrator, spell-casting pre-pares for Mérodack’s fashioning an effigy orVolt, a wax figurine which,when violently manipulated, carries out the execution of the malefac-tor. Metonymy as magic – the manufacture of statuettes made with teethand nails, the deciduous body parts of one’s enemy – compels an evac-uation of “the astral body of the bewitched, drawn out by impalpablethreads, expelled by the winds of attraction.”85Attacked with pincers,thorns, knives, shards of glass, or a headband encircling the skull, anevildoer is burned, impaled, or crushed – dying, as Jules Bois writes,“at the same time that the last vestiges of his wax double are meltingaway.”86While Péladan initially conceived of magic as skills that provedmastery and conferred election, his early works still adumbrate a real-ization of the limitations of occult power.

Indeed, in Péladan’s initial representations, theMagus is almost indistinguishable from the sorcerer, driven by hatred“to sacrifice the joys of life in order to repay evil with evil.”87Scornfuland self-glorifying, Mérodack is diminished by his narcissism, transfixedby the exceptionality of his knowledge and the scope of his powers.In his early incarnations, he is the opposite of the true spiritual seeker.As Péladan writes: “In the domain of magic, man seeks himself insteadof God, and what he finds is often madness or another cause of hisperdition.”88A disciple and admirer of Eliphas Lévi, Péladan studied the claviclesand grimoires in order to master techniques that isolated and pro-tected. Control over what Lévi calls “the great instrument of magic”equips the thaumaturge with powers that are primarily defensive.Rather than multiplying his force for good, integrating him into acircle of adepts who propagate virtue, wisdom, and health, the mas-tery of magic and disposition of the Azoth combat the contagionof vice, thwarting the action of magnetic currents whose effect, asLévi says, “is to attract and excite impressionable people with over-wrought nerves and temperaments disposing them to hallucinations orhysteria.”89The Sâr’s protagonist shuns the society of men and only mingleswith the profane in order to fight the evils that infect them. InLeVice suprême, Mérodack wishes to administer a Mithridatic inoculationagainst the tepid iniquity of his contemporaries and so chooses to liveamong princesses of sacrilege and artists of perversion. Succumbing to“his curiosity about evil,” he can do no more than delay the impend-ing collapse of western culture. In Péladan’s inaugural novel, the Magusacquires strength only when he works in cooperation with a priest andwhen the two establish jointly a confraternity of geniuses and visionar-ies. As Rabbi Sichem, Mérodack’s mentor, says: “However powerful hemay be over individuals, the Magus cannot act on the multitudes unlesshe works with people of pure will, unless he forms part of a magneticchain.”90Magic as performanceWhile Péladan’s Magus admits reluctantly the need to work with otherpeople, becoming a single link in the chain of enlightened beings, theSâr himself was temperamentally ill-suited to a life of solitary occultstudy.

Péladan’s abandonment of his view of magic assecret practice was surely in part motivated by his exhibitionist procliv-ities. Transposed as his persona, the Sâr presents an image of the Magusas an incongruously august figure with his striking features and strangeapparel.Mérodack’s initial manifestation at a social gathering inLe Vicesuprêmeis a moment of hierophanic drama, acoup de théâtrecarefullyorchestrated, eliciting wonderment and stupefaction among the dis-abused participants. With flowing, ebony curls veiling his forehead,with his hypnotizing gaze, his nose “with its gentle Judaic curve,” withthe red slash of his mouth, and his beard divided “in two points,”Mérodack’s entrance arrests conversation; “his appearance astoundedthe assembly.”91Like Péladan himself, who produced astonishment inonlookers with his vestimentary strangeness, his hirsutism, and the-atrical mannerisms, his protagonist constructs a persona calculated toproduce the maximum effect.Occultism, with its etymological connotation of hiddenness andsecrecy, was not easily reconcilable with Péladan’s grandiose extro-version. Many theories have been adduced for the Sâr’s collaborationwith Papus and Stanislas de Guaïta, who together founded L’Ordrede la Rose+Croix Kabbalistique in 1888. But one reason for whatwould escalate into Rosicrucian factionalism was the Sâr’s refusal tobe eclipsed by other prominent hermeticists. From the start, Péladangravitated to more colorful literary figures – like his mentor, Barbeyd’Aurévilly, the Constable of letters, prototype of the fin-de-sièclescandal-monger/dandy. Philosophical disagreements with Papus andGuaïta, who did not share the Sâr’s commitment to a re-Christianizedform of occultism, might have led to a falling out among the threenotable adepts. Similarly, Péladan might have put off by Guaïta’s rolein theaffaire Boullan, but most likely, he was motivated by a wish forgreater visibility and fame.Ingeborg Kohn suggests the Sâr was influenced by the popularity ofEdouard Schuré’sThe Great Initiates, an occult treatise on the leadingprophets and visionaries of history. Appealing to Péladan’s messianismand hunger for publicity, the book might have prompted him to wish topresent himself as the world’s next spiritual leader. Having overcome hissense of oedipal inferiority on the occasion of Barbey’s death, Péladanhad noisily proclaimed his merit and preeminence: “No longer will I callanyone in this world Master,” he had pledged. As Kohn writes, this wasthe moment for Péladan to “set up his own constabulary.” An estab-lished figure in the world of esotericism, literature, and art, Péladan was"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The Magus105ready to seek the notoriety he had desired for so long. “Why not as aGrand Initié,” Kohn asks, “a prophet of his era?”92Magic as artIt was this need for mirroring and approval that drove Péladan tocombine art and esotericism. Indeed, as the founder of le Salon de laRose+Croix, Péladan himself believed that the occult could attract theneophyte with the appeal of beauty and knowledge. Despite the Sâr’sdubious taste, his vociferous excommunication of the Impressionists,his promotion of obscure artists with an indigence of talent, Péladanaffirmed his role as a proselytizer whose responsibility was to strengthenthe church and glorify the Savior, disseminating works that were other-worldly, elitist, and sublime. “In opposition to naturalism which wasleading the West to its undoing, it was necessary to initiate a current ofmystical art ablaze with Catholic fervor. Modern man had lost his faith,but the divine could still speak to atheists through the medium of amasterpiece.”93This was the belief informing Péladan’s establishment ofa new brand of Rosicrucianism: since, across the Cross, Passion’s symbol,lay the opening petals of Art’s Rose.Rigorous in its repudiation of nature and its celebration of spiritu-ality as artifice, Péladan’s aesthetic was enshrined in the exhibits ofRosicrucian art from which were banished all works of soul-degradingrealism: “all ostensibly bourgeois subjects: historical scenes, militaryscenes, contemporary or rustic settings,”94as well as portraiture, humor-ous material, and canvases by women.Despite its elitism, Péladan’s conception of art as spiritual inspirationis what informs his changing image of fin-de-siècle magic, as it movesfrom a specialized body of knowledge, accessible to the few, to a meansof uplifting the selfless in their crusade to spiritualize the many.At the conclusion ofLe Vice suprême, Father Alta admonishes his con-gregants not to lament the obsolescence of an aristocracy of birth orfortune. He claims that the modern-day Crusader wields a pen, and nota sword, affirms that as long as there are suffering people needing help,God’s work is still unfinished.Péladan’s notion of art-as-magic effects a synthesis of faith and aes-thetics, as creative work allows for a reconciliation of emotion and intel-ligence. Like Papus, who had complained about the anti-intellectualismof the church (Le Diable et l’occultisme), Péladan regrets the divorcebetween the Catholic’s artistic sensibilities and his faith. WhereasPéladan lauds the mystic, guided by his conscience, not his intellect, heis saddened to see the church “show no interest in beauty.”95This is why"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"106Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FrancePéladan idealizes the Magus for re-consecrating art used to usher in “thereign of God,” for announcing the dawning era of the Holy Spirit, whichwould witness a second apotheosis of an adept functioning as a saint.Whereas religion had cultivated the soul and magic had disciplined themind, the Magus will achieve a union assimilating the masterpiece andthe miracle, likening “artists to priests, and the arts to sacred rites.”96In Péladan’s conception of an aesthetic of holiness, he insists that thegenius be an evangelist of Paracletism. Art will not be debased in order toappeal to the multitudes, expressing transcendent truths in meretriciousimagery, dressing divine precepts in the cheap apparel of a commonidiom, in order, Péladan says, to seduce “the rabble of humanity.”97Instead, Catholic occultism will elevate an audience still incapable ofappreciating it, touching them with a work “of so high an order thatthe people can sense it without actually understanding it.”98Over the course of Péladan’sEthopée, Mérodack assembles his bandof Rosicrucian workers: sculptors of events, poets of dream, alchemistsof history, those ready to advance their cause with unorthodox, forbid-den weapons, willing to serve God “by what one calls from the pulpitthe tools of the devil.”99Yet Mérodack alone seems able to harness theessential energy, the telesma or “plastic mediator” of which Eliphas Léviwrites. However, his disciples, who are members of a modern-day guildof hermeticists, still use their art to influence what Péladan calls “secondcauses,” actions whose consequences are manifested on the astral planeand whose effects, to the uninitiated, can often seem miraculous.The disciples that Mérodack assembles adapt their work to sacredgoals. For them, art is neither petitionary nor doxological. It is a bla-zon on the shield of the Christian warriors of the apocalypse, a toolused by those whom Mérodack calls “the hidden workers of the HolyTemple.” Art affects what Papus describes as the higher levels of man’snature: “The Psychic Being that is guided by Instinct and that mani-fests itself to the Mind by Inspiration.”100Guiding neophytes on theirpainful ascension to elevated consciousness, art ignites noble feelingsthat are ratified by the mind. As Mérodack advises his brothers: “We areconscious passions that assume mastery of unconscious passions. Usingpeople’s weaknesses, taking control of errant forces, we use our giftsto usher in the kingdom of the One who pardons everything that isconceived by intelligence and consented to by charity.”101In the final volumes of his series, Péladan shows that the Magus’snoblest aspiration is the disciplined sculpting of his identity, subli-mating the instincts, raising the mind toward God so that the soulbecomes a masterpiece.

Thus, thehighest form of art is the perfection of the self: “All true magic is per-formed in the Magus. He is his own phenomenon, the object of his ownconquest.”102Yet this refinement of identity brings a realization that theMagus cannot rise to a higher plane unless he first engages with hisfellow-men in an attempt to lift them up.Magic as politicsWhile the Magus’s talents are best utilized in the purification of hissoul, Péladan shows that when his intelligence is directed outward andhis arcane powers are trained on the world, his ambitions become mis-guided and his projects always fail. However worthy their objective andrarefied their skills, the Rosicrucian brotherhood that Mérodack com-mands is powerless to extend their influence into the realm of politicalintrigue. As Péladan remarks, the role of the Magus is not to changereality but himself: “Man becomes an angel by developing his highestfaculty: ideality.”103InFinis Latinorum, Mérodack’s ill-conceived conspiratorial effort toselect the successor to Pope Leo XIII, to turn the church away from itsmissionary violence and democratizing values, had required the kind ofMachiavellian practicality that is alien to the Magus. Plotting, after theexpected death of Leo, to infiltrate the College of Cardinals and cam-paign for the installation of a pontiff willing to repudiate aggressionand envisage the Vatican, not as an Italian entity, but as the center of aglobal Catholic community, Mérodack had reflected Péladan’s own dis-agreements with church policy. Despite his professed acquiescence toPapal authority, Péladan had long voiced a wide array of complaints,advocating the abolition of bullfighting, arguing for a deprivileging ofJudaism as the ancestral precursor of Catholic dogma, which the Sârmaintained owed as much to the Bhagavad Gita as to the Torah.Apart from the fruitlessness of his plot, there is an unseemliness tothe Magus’s interference in matters of policy and church governance.As a follower of Mérodack proclaims in one of Péladan’s more incongru-ous phrases: “there can be no possible copulation between our will andfatidic matters.”104Uncomfortable in the hothouse world of Decadent vice, Mérodack isalso out of place in ecclesiastical cabals.

Identifiedby the Jesuits as a conduit to the spirit world, a certain Sister Mariede Gonzague of the convent of the Paraclete glimpses in a somnam-bulistic vision the dismal outcome of the Rosicrucians’ machinations.Leo, whose demise was expected to be imminent, is seen to be alive foryears into the future; Mérodack’s covert work to elevate a successor isrecognized as premature and pointless. The most impressive display ofclairvoyance is exhibited, not by the Magus, but by an unschooled nunwhose previous visions had been of her superiors’ sexual indiscretions.After being left to contemplate the ruins of their undertaking,Péladan’s artist/magicians are forced to recognize the problematic wis-dom of direct political action. Reorienting their efforts toward magicas personal enlightenment, they define art as inspiration, not as a plat-form for revolution. When Mérodack takes leave of his disciples, it isthe thought of their company that consoles him, the confraternity ofOelohites that compensates for their fruitless undertaking. As the traincarrying Mérodack departs from the station en route to Florence, hisfollowers line the track and salute him as he passes. Their failed enter-prise is only the manifest part of a hidden dialectic of occultations andappearances, the burial of seeds that one day will rend the earth, rebornas jewels: “Gemmatus resurgam,” Mérodack’s acolytes proclaim. Whileit may be unrealized in its execution, a noble project is still beautiful.Implementation may be unsuccessful and a justification still sublime.An action is still an art work irrespective of its consequence, and thosewho foretell a better future are poets of the Messiah. “Prophecy involvesvision, not reason,” as one avows. “as done by those who dream nobly,by those who strive heroically.”106Magic as teachingWhen Mérodack summons his apostles to leave behind the secular worldof intrigue, he defines their role as bridging the phenomenal and spiri-tual planes.

This newfigure will be able to preach and pray, follow liturgy and decipher gri-moires, uplift the heart and focus the mind, retreat into himself andthen come out again, bestowing his insights on a community of seek-ers. As Mérodack and Father Alta are complementary halves of a mysticwhole, the new Magus will perform a multiplicity of tasks that hadonce led men of God down different paths. Becoming “austere ceno-bites, monks who preach and teach,” they will imprintaristeswith theinsignia of royalty and holiness.To Mérodack, the adept is able to affect the future, not by tracing thebond between his physical and astral body, but by using his persuasive-ness to inspire the thinking of his successors. Mérodack performs hisgreatest feats of magic in Péladan’s first book,Le Vice suprême,whenheuses magnetism to paralyze an attacker, charts an apostelematic map ofhis future, casts a spell on an evildoer. Thereafter, his role as figurehead islimited to assembling a group of acolytes whose later interventions willbe more fruitful and effective. Mérodack compares himself to Moses, tooinfirm to reach the Promised Land, yet resolved to teach his followershow they themselves can complete the journey: “let us conclude thatthe hour has not yet come for our ideas to pass from potentiality intoaction.”107The occult visionary may die and migrate to a shadow worldwhile surviving as his word. As Péladan writes in a vindication of hisrole as an author: “writing prolongs discourse indefinitely; the abstractembraces the future as it does the present.”108In Péladan’s later novels, the secret powers that were once withheldacquire value through their communication to another. How far Péladanhas evolved in his depiction of the occult leader, a figure no longerisolated by narcissism and aloofness, a man whose goal is not self-aggrandizement, not the maximization of his difference.

In moving toward aview of magic as ministry and latria, Péladan advances his own ideasof sex magic and friendship magic. Once systematically anti-feminist,Péladan’s later views include a conception of erotomancy that elevatesthe women formerly seen as base.InComment on devient mage, the advice given apprentices hadinvolved minimizing contact with women. Desire, with its superveningsexual exertion and disappointment, had led Péladan to recommendthat a woman be disembodied as an ideal, domesticated as a friend,evaporated as her perfume. The only worthwhile intercourse was theartist’s conjugation with his work: “Art alone should satisfy your dreams.Live exclusively with masterpieces. Ask a woman only for her heart. Askthat she temper your sensibilities.”110Over time, however, as Péladan’s views on magic became less eli-tist and exclusive, accommodating the possibility of comradeship andromance, the Sâr elaborated his unique idea of “sacred prostitution.”Despite its condescension, Péladan’s rehabilitation of the occult soul-mate recognizes the intelligence and subjectivity of women acting inconcert with the Magus. Péladan’s notion of the mistress as sexual ves-sel and mystic weapon is encapsulated in his notion ofla fée(the fairy)as the counterpart ofle mage.As early asLe Vice suprême, there is an occult explanation of desire’sdynamic, with woman characterized as “an unconscious magnetizerwho uses the law of sexual attraction.” On the astral plane, desire actsan “an electric radiance,” which, after targeting a woman, reboundsonto the person coveting her, causing what Mérodack calls, “a counter-shock.”111Submitting to “her amorous servility,” the woman becomes amagnetizer fully conscious of the occult energies she channels. Enemiesof sublimity are crippled by the power of their guilty impulses, van-quished by women who see their vulnerability as “replacing a daggerwith their love.”112Placing themselves in the hands of their mas-ters, Péladan’s female characters become instruments of male magic,weapons cognizant of their destructive power. Practicing “selfless sex-uality,” the woman once patronized is raised up. No longer a blind,unconscious force of SchopenhauerianWille, exiling man to the darkkingdom of instinctual automatism, women become helpmates and col-laborators, “mystical lovers using their caresses, not simply as a source ofpleasure, but as the instrument of the destiny of a doctrine – the sourceof pleasure for a despot who is all the more formidable since he is gen-tle, calm, incapable of cruelty, able to conceive of only the most elevatedideals.”113"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The Magus111By the end of theEthopée, Péladan has grown distant from his hero.While the author recognizes the value of comradeship and romance,Mérodack has not tempered his insistence that the Magus fortify hispower by renouncing women’s company. Summoning artists of theGnosis, monks of the Ideal, he appeals to them to sacrifice desire tothe perfection of the order. Péladan’s own thinking reflects the schismwithin the Rosicrucian brotherhood, as Mérodack’s followers reject hisinsistence on chastity and assert love’s esoteric properties: “Love is anelement of the Great Work,” as one maintains.114With the revalidation of sex, love, and partnership, Péladan’s fic-tional corpus ends with the Magus’s re-integration into the temporalworld, as the initiate turns outward to serve humanity, not himself.Heroic and dehumanized, estranged by his absolutism from the broth-erhood he founded, Mérodack alone clings to the notion of magicas uncompromising mysticism. Initially established as a separatist cultinformed by the neo-Albigensian principles of abstinence, an embraceof death as deliverance from the body, the Rosicrucians renounce theideal of Eros and accept the Christian notion of Agape, love of one’sfellow man as strong as the love of oneself. From the untransmit-table truths of occult teachings and the ineffability of private rapture,Péladan’s works describe a descent back to the domain of service andsolidarity, interdependence and communion with the fallen people oneresembles.As Denis de Rougemont writes, in this world, to love “is to shed self-ishness and the desirous and anxious self; it means the death of thesolitary human being, but it also means the birth of our neighbor.”115What had been the marriage of Christ and the church, the visionary andhis disciples, is re-enacted as the marriage of man and woman, the forg-ing of a bond between friends. From magnifying the One, the uniquebeing,ipsissimus, Péladan grounds his thinking again in the idea of acommunity of the faithful. Himself the author of a scholarly volumeon Catharism (Le Secret des troubadours[The Secret of the Troubadours]1906), Péladan models his own utopian order on the twelfth-centuryheretical movement, naming the fortress/sanctuary where Mérodackand his followers are housed after Montségur, the stronghold where theAlbigensians had been headquartered. Mérodack also professes a Gnos-tic belief in the heterogeneity of earth and heaven, the soul’s unhappyincarceration in a terrestrial body from which it seeks deliverance, anescape into the increate world of light, and a return to a prelapsar-ian state of spiritual unity. He, too, performs the ritual by which theAlbigensians recognized one another, bestowing the Kiss of Peace, the"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"112Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FranceConsolamentum, by which they sealed their vow “to renounce the world,[...] to devote themselves to God alone, never to lie or take an oath,never to kill, or eat of an animal, and finally everto abstain, if married,from all contact with a wife.”116Thus, when Mérodack arrives at Montségur, “the Great Master, accord-ing to the Albigensian Rite of the Consolamentum, kneels in turnbefore each brother, kisses him on the mouth, and lifts him upagain.”117Thereafter, the divergent practices of the two orders are more appar-ent. The Round Table, like that at which Arthur’s knights assembled, isset with meat, along with the fruits and wine the brotherhood partakesof. Women, still banished from the company of the Elect, are evident intheir embellishment of the castle, with tapestries sent by one illustrat-ing the martyrdom of Saint Ursula, chasubles and sacerdotal ornamentsprovided by another, a bejeweled paten in the form of a rose and a crossat the center of which sparkled “an alchemical diamond.”118While resolving to abstain from procreation, the Rosicrucians are stillforgiven for the sins of fornication and adultery because, as they claim,love inspires greater piety and creation, because it is “beautiful like avirtue” and strengthens “the striving for perfection.”119When Mérodackinvites his disciples to accept “The Way, the Life, and the Truth,”120they refuse, claiming that chastity murders art and that poetry is love’sexpression.Along with indicating a moderation of his anti-feminism, Péladan’sinclusion of women as artists’ handmaidens confirms his view of magiccollectively practiced as a religious aesthetic. The Magus who hadworked alone with the alchemist’s retort, who had poured over thehieroglyphs in the Arcana of the Tarot, becomes an artist whose specialtalents enrich the experience of his peers. Collaboratively authored, amagic artwork acquires a synesthetic fullness: the sculptor’s clay is beau-tified by the poet’s sense of eurhythmy; a writer’s novel is structured bya musician’s sense of a leitmotif from Wagner. Symmetries and tonalitiescreate a universal harmony manifesting the analogy of the earthly anddivine.Fellow-artists become more than visionaries working together sideby side. They are elements which, when combined, form somethingwhole and indivisible, like the predestined gender complements whichtogether form the Androgyne. Each artist sees his brother as one whomirrors and completes him: “the companion of his thought after beingthe companion of his soul, the brother of a work inspired by sacredambition.”121"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"The Magus113On the social plane, this synergy produces art that is more complex,purer, and higher, greater than the sum of its components. On thetheological level, it models the dynamic interplay of the will of manand the grace of God. Like his counterpart, Stanislas de Guaïta, Péladan’sMagus climbs up and down Jacob’s ladder, materializing his inspirationas a sacrament shared with consumers: “the spirit clothes itself to comedown and undresses to rise up.”122For Péladan, the work of art serves a referential purpose since, as abody, it evokes a spiritual perfection that it only partially manifests. Likethe woman who, in theEthopée, is honored and respected, it is a terres-trial thing inspiring longings for the sublime. The axial orientation ofPéladan’s work, moving from magic to religion, abandons the incommu-nicability of Ain Soph for the accessibility of literary language. Likewise,horizontally, it abandons the exclusivity of arcane knowledge in orderto embrace the exotericism of art as a proselytizing agent. Péladan pro-poses that in the coming era of the Holy Spirit, there will be a conflationof the saint and thaumaturge who formune aristie nouvelleand carry onthe soteriological work of Christ. He echoes Huysmans in proclaimingthat art aims at reflecting God’s glory, reproducing “the divinity evenin its feeble mirror.” While it diminishes the uncompassed majesty ofCreation, art still strives to achieve perfection, becoming “identical toGod himself.” Mérodack also refers to his brothers as “profound mir-rors” who capture the divine light and reflect it in “the radiance ofamasterpiece.”123Who among us, he asks, would be the shadow ofhimself “without the book, the monument, the statue, or the paint-ing?” Since illumination comes from God, “let us become luminous; letus work.”124ConclusionIngeborg Kohn, in tracing Péladan’s career trajectory as a creator andan occultist, notes the pivotal moment when the Sâr first sought areconciliation of art and magic. Collaborating with Papus, Jules Bois,and Stanislas de Guaïta, Péladan had initially adopted a brand ofRosicrucianism indebted to Eliphas Lévi, who, Kohn says, “based hisoccult system on the Kabbalah, Swedenborg, theCorpus Hermeticum,and the Tarot.”125However, for numerous reasons including his friends’distaste for the Sâr’s flamboyance and the exchange of spells betweenHuysmans and Boullan, Péladan had turned away from the secrecy ofesotericism and had sought instead to harness creative work to a cam-paign of Catholic reform. “With the founding ofL’Ordre de la Rose+Croix"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"114Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Franceet Kabbalistiquein 1888, there began a new period in Péladan’s career,characterized by an intense search for spiritual values, and for ways [...]to achieve a new synthesis between religion and art.”126As with Mérodack, Péladan’s advocacy of a spiritual aesthetic largelycame to nothing. With his mania for Wagner, his bombastic mani-festoes, and preposterous persona, he earned the ridicule of his detrac-tors, not the reverence of his acolytes. Péladan’s Salons were responsiblefor showcasing the Decadent sensibility of Fernand Khnopff and for pro-moting painters who imitated Gustave Moreau and the Pre-Raphaelites.But over time, critics concluded that Péladan championed art thatwas derivative, and excoriated him for his fatuousness, pomposity, andsnobbery. As Kohn wonders, with Péladan’s “meridional expansiveness,overbearing nature, effusive mannerisms, and florid [...]prose,[..]how could one take the Sâr seriously?”127Yet in his fiction, Péladan was unique in proposing a synthesis ofCatholic orthodoxy and occultism as the goal the Magus strives for.Having begun by embracing magic because it proved superiority andconferred power, Péladan had then shown himself dissatisfied withoccultism’s emphasis on secrecy. Temperamentally disposed to theatri-cal self-display, the Sâr had gravitated toward a version of magic thatassigned precedence to spectacle. An outlandish public figure, Péladanhad also stressed his conviction that the Magus’s greatest work of art wasthe perfection of his soul.Péladan’s exhibitionism had led him to take on the work of artcritic, arranging the Salons at which his own person was on display.The impulse to involve himself in public causes and social actions hadprompted fantasies, illustrated in several of his novels, to conspire toaffect affairs of state and set the course of Vatican policy. But the metic-ulousness and secrecy required of these machinations had been beyondthe Sâr’s abilities, resulting in the miscarriage of his plans. Ultimately,Péladan’s view of magic as privilege and duty had caused a reconcilia-tion of esotericism with a view of Catholicism as service. Péladan’s heromay insist on inhuman principle and purity, but the author himselfprofesses greater fraternalism and compassion.At the conclusion ofLa Vertu suprême, Mérodack – having alienatedhis disciples by requiring of them the abstinence practiced by theirAlbigensian forebears – sets out in the twilight with the gloomy gaitof Ahasuerus. Intransigent, uncompromising, arrogant, superhuman, here-enters the immaculacy of his solitude. But having founded the broth-erhood and promulgated an ideal of initiatic art, he embarks in a nightilluminated by a star of hope and promise: “grandson of the Magi who"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The Magus115came to Bethlehem,” he is a witness and a precursor.128Having cele-brated exceptionality, Péladan elevates the Magus as a genius whosesuperiority is isolating, then shows him exiled from the world, as hiswork is completed by his followers.As an expression of the fin-de-siècle goal of the self refashioned as amasterpiece, the Magus in Péladan had initially become his own ideal.Lofty, uncommunicative, he had left the realm of literature in order toimmure himself in a fortress of knowledge shared with no one. Yet inchoosing to act as a mentor, a pedagogue, and prophet, Péladan’s charac-ter finally puts magic to use in the service of other people. In submittingto the authority of the church, he acknowledges that revelation super-sedes occultism’s secret knowledge. Noting that his predecessors hadworshipped at the scene of the Nativity, he proclaims: “The adorationof the Magi marks the abdication of esotericism to the Incarnation ofthe Truth.”129Like his Decadent peers, Péladan foresaw the approachingworld’s end, had foretold the imminent extinction of a vitiated westernculture. But theFinis Latinorumthat is augured by the prophet alsoannounces the beginning of a new age of intelligence and holiness, theera of the Paraclete when saints would be theosophists and artists. Thisis the gospel spread by Péladan’s transfigured Magus: pride that dies inorder to be reborn as devotion, subordination of an exalted self to theincommensurability of the divine, loss of the superior, lonely man inthe “Infinitas Christi.”130"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"4The MysticEugène Vintras and the Order of MercyThe history of fin-de-siècle mysticismThe historical backdrop against which Eugène Vintras’s bizarre hereticalcult made its first appearance in France in the 1840s was one marked bya forceful resurgence of secular rationalism. Opposing Auguste Comte’sPositivist assertion of mankind’s progress toward scientific enlighten-ment, the fin-de-siècle mystics who were influenced by Vintras vaunteda higher knowledge they claimed was obtainable only from divinesources, insights that were yielded only by non-rational intuition.Instead of a confident march toward technological mastery, Vintras’s fol-lowers believed that time itself was ending, overturning governments,hurling a church corrupted by materialism into the abyss of fire thatwould open with the coming apocalypse.At the turn of the century, when Vintras’s teachings began to exercisetheir greatest power among Catholic artists and intellectuals, the riseof Republicanism and scientific reason produced a backlash that drewthe disaffected to the heretical prophet’s message. In the aftermath ofthe 1879 election, with the rise of Jules Grévy, the declining politicalinfluence of the Royalists was further sealed by the death of the Countof Chambord, definitively dashing Legitimist hopes for a re-accession ofthe king. Despite the persistence of factionalist conflict between Radicalsand Moderates, the latter assumed continuity of power between 1879and 1885 when, under the leadership of Jules Ferry, a series of liberallaws was enacted. During the time of the Third Republic, the influenceof the aristocracy diminished significantly in a government adminis-tered by members of the middle class, “lawyers or physicians, teachers orjournalists, industrialists or financiers – well-educated and comfortably116"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"The Mystic117well-to-do” – but having “no noblemen or clergy-men amongthem.”1Among the reform laws passed at this time, the ideal of democraticeducation endorsed by the state was countered by vigorous expres-sions of anti-intellectualism on the part of reactionary Catholic artists.Superior to the profane insights gained by analytical reason, theybelieved, were the inexpressible truths unearthed in dreams, glimpsedin ecstatic visions, or received directly from God. Republicanism, withits penchant toward hierarchical leveling, was rejected in favor of there-establishment of a new elite comprised of prophets and Mages.Accompanying the decay of a hereditary aristocracy of breeding was theascendancy of a plutocracy of Philistines, loutish bourgeois millionairesbesotted by self-indulgence, unmindful of the beauties of the transcen-dental, ignorant of the true nobility of self-denial. Caricatures of thesefigures began to proliferate in the literature of the period, from Villiersde l’Isle-Adam’s Tribulat Bonhomet to Octave Mirbeau’s Isidore Lechat.In the minds of authors and zealots, charity and altruism, suffocated byan atrophy of the soul, were sacrificed as the price exacted by scientificprogress. This new materialist ideology, as Carlton Hayes has noted, fos-tered “popular indifference to Christian [...] practices by concentratingattention upon the ‘marvels’ of human achievement, by exalting engi-neers over preachers or priests, and by stimulating a greater ambitionfor creature comforts than for personal holiness.”2In reacting against the laicizing influence of liberal democracy, thechurch during the pontificate of Pius IX (1846–78) began to warn ofthe dangers of modern civilization. In his 1864 encyclicalQuanta Curaand the accompanying Syllabus of Errors, Pius condemned the enshrine-ment of individualism, intellectual independence unguided by churchteachings. Inveighing against free-thinkers and agnostics, bemoaningthe noxious diffusion of anti-clericalism, deploring the anarchic irrev-erence of Freemasons, who advocated a relativist view of religions – allseen as superfluous and interchangeable – Pius had called for a returnto the ideal of a Christian state, one in which the authority of Catholicleaders was recognized as paramount. As a matter of dogma, Pius’s posi-tion was not new, but it still reinforced popular perceptions of theChurch’s defensive inflexibility.Perhaps the matter that most galvanized the antagonism of fin-de-siècle mystics toward the church and that drew the most vehementresponse from Vintras himself was Pius’s promulgation of the doctrineof Papal infallibility. In the 1869 Vatican Council, Pius had advancedthe claim that, when speakingex cathedra, the Pope, “by virtue of his"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"118Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francesupreme apostolic authority,” was possessed “of that infallibility withwhich the Divine Redeemer willed that his Church should be endowedfor defining faith or morals.”3Excoriating the Pope for his hubris, Vintras responded by decryingthe institutional arrogance of church leaders more intent, he alleged,on consolidating their authority than on articulating sound principle.Affirming the inherent doctrinal validity of the Immaculate Concep-tion, Vintras denounced the Pope for refusing “the divine authority of asacredly explicit resolution.” Vintras questioned the need to invoke thePope’s apostolic authority in upholding dogma whose incontrovertibil-ity seemed to require no church approval, assailing what he denouncedas this “act of lèse-majesté against God.”4The Decadents who, in succeeding generations, adopted Vintras’sviews, would echo the prophet’s hostility toward Rome, integratingit into their own notions of decentralized religion. Believing in theheightened spirituality of the exceptional individual whose wisdom hadbeen tested by the fire of self-discipline, they championed the figure ofthe mystic, who might be obedient to the church but was also moreenlightened than its leaders.In his analysis of the origins of the Vintrasian cult, Richard Griffithsnotes the Decadents’ embrace of a new form of Gnosticism. Vatic pre-cursors, Griffiths says, they believed themselves to be in possession of“higher knowledge [...] not attainable by ordinary intellectual processesbut only by spiritual enlightenment.” Rather than acknowledge theinfallibility of the Pope – able to think for his flock, anxious to makedecisions on matters of faith, insistent on prescribing an understandingof the divine that disallowed direct experience – Vintras and his follow-ers invoked the gifts of the seer, asserting his direct access to the realm ofthe miraculous. This sense of “being a minority,” Griffiths writes, “mayhave been one of the causes for the desire which we often find in them,a desire to be themselves the depositaries of a true knowledge unknownto others.”5It is ironic that Vintras should have deplored the presumptuousnessof Papal inerrancy while proclaiming himself to be a manifestation ofthe prophet Elijah. Appointing himself as the founder of a new church,Vintras also claimed to disseminate divine truths received in dialogueswith Christ. However, his disaffection for the Vatican left an indeliblemark on his successors. Decadent mystics, influenced by the secret dis-closed by the Virgin in an apparition to the shepherdess Melanie inLa Salette, had cited her denunciation of a clergy tainted by material-ism, pandering to the wealthy, theprètres propriétaires(property-owning"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"The Mystic119priests) against whom Léon Bloy would fulminate inLe Sang du Pauvre(The Blood of the Poor).To the Decadents, the appeal of this once-unlettered vagrant istraceable to Vintras’s promotion of a religion rooted in a personalapprehension of the divine, a controversial heterodoxy that glorifiedsacrifice and extolled the penitential suffering that distinguished anaristocracy of holiness from a bourgeoisie of hedonism. Disenchantedwith Republicanism and the moderating influence of leaders like Ferry,exasperated by the waning influence of traditional Catholicism and bythe liberalizing of laws on the press, the Decadents were strengthenedin their Restorationist aspirations, their orientation toward a religionshaped by esotericism, their quest for secret knowledge divulged only toa privileged few. Like Vintras, the Decadents professed beliefs not sanc-tioned by the Pope, sought knowledge not mediated and approved bychurch fathers. Wishing to reformulate an Eternal Gospel delivered tothem directly, they were resolved to heed, not the pronouncements ofthe Vatican, but the voice of Christ himself.Despite their penchant toward intellectual elitism, what distinguishedthe thinking of the writers most profoundly influenced by Vintras was aredefinition of hierarchy that would henceforth be modeled on Christ’sprophesied inversion of positions of power – when, in the end time,the first would be last and the last would be first. Appealing to aris-tocrats whose secular influence had been diminishing was the idea of anew hierarchy of genius, devotion, and service. Vintras had attacked thechurch as a sclerotic institution serving only the wealthy, seeking only topreserve its own power, neglecting the wretched whom Jesus had cometo save. In the new hierarchy announced in his teachings, the tradition-ally downtrodden – women and the poor – would be accorded the statusof a new elect. Even as their suffering and anonymity, their oppressionand neglect continued unabated in this world, they would perform workthat hastened the Messiah’s return. To be sure, this new vision of aneschatological hierarchy was the mirror opposite of the social hierarchydiscredited by this time. Yet it was an order that disempowered aristo-crats and Catholic mystics admired, one whose institution they ratified,and whose benefits they reaped.Eugène Vintras and the Order of MercyAs for the prophet whose heretical teachings shaped the views of theDecadent mystics, history has it that on August 6, 1839, there appearedto this unprepossessing manager of a cardboard factory in the little town"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"120Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Franceof Tilly a threadbare figure bearing a cryptic message. Invisible to out-siders, this unnamed old man came to Vintras in a series of ever moreluminous visitations. Subsequently revealed as Michael, the archangel,the supernatural host warned of the impending world’s end. Vintraswent on to receive other oracular announcements, accusations impugn-ing the legitimacy of the royal family, invocations of divine vengeanceonNinevah, the Harlot– Paris, the wanton Babylon of the corrupted finde siècle – calls for the fiery destruction of the Church of Rome, perverterof sacred dogma, city of abomination. The tocsin sounds, as Vintraswrites in his apocalyptic vision: paving stones rip loose, dungeon doorsburst open, chains break, and palaces shake like the leaves of a whitepoplar, ciboria are overturned, sanctified Hosts fly away, chalices roll onflagstones, and altars sweat drops of blood and poison.Born in Bayeux in 1807, Vintras, in his early life, led an unremarkableexistence as a vagrant factotum, hawking lace and cotton print, sellingstolen goods, serving brief prison sentences for various misdemeanors,relocating first to Paris, then to Caen. Maurice Garçon, in his biogra-phy of the prophet, sees little foreshadowing of Vintras’s later notoriety:“No truly serious misdeeds can be imputed to him. Timid in his actsof larceny, he lived by doing whatever was expedient.”6An unexpectedawakening of Vintras’s faith in 1838, followed by a pilgrimage to LaDélivrande later in that year, augurs little of Vintras’s later audienceswith angels.Vintras’s acquaintance with a certain Ferdinard Geoffroi, a notary dis-tinguished as much by fraudulent business dealings as by his legitimistleanings and messages from John the Baptist, began in Caen in 1837.Bringing to their association “his legal knowledge, his taste for adven-ture, certain singular relationships, and an invaluable erudition,”7Geoffroi impressed Vintras with his connection to various mysticalsocieties and his commitment to the Naundorff cause. It was throughhis relationship with Geoffroi that the fin-de-siècle visionary first con-ceived of the establishment of the Order of Mercy, intuiting the gloriousParousia to come. Vintras’s unusual spiritual temperament and politicalproclivities were already in place when, two years later in his home inTilly, he received the first of the hagiophanic visions that would informhis later teachings.Biographers like Garçon and historians of the era have had difficultyexplaining the transformation of this unschooled character into theincarnation of the prophet Elijah, as Vintras professed himself to be.An often lyrically gifted visionary, Vintras evolved from his modest ori-gins into a mystical heretic whose doctrine was fiercely denounced by"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The Mystic121the church and whose eschatological vaticinations exercised consider-able influence over important writers of the era. Casting himself as asuccessor to the second-century prophet Montanus, who also enteredinto a state of ecstasy in order to transmit pronouncements from theHoly Spirit, Vintras preached the dawning of the Third Age of theParaclete, etymologically identified as the Comforter and Intercessor,whose coming would signal an end to the age of the salvatory Passion.From being “the bastard child of a poor working girl,”8an oftenjobless transient, and occasional petty criminal, Vintras emerged as anelectrifying orator and prodigious Biblical scholar, whose charisma andintellect enthralled his followers. Despite being dismissed by critics asa copycat and fraud, Vintras propounded an apocalyptic doctrine thatexercised immense appeal. In proclaiming a non-rational apprehen-sion of the divine, in replacing the obsolete hierarchy of an hereditaryaristocracy with a spiritual hierarchy of martyrs and visionaries, heprophesied the end of a world in which his followers felt themselvesstrangers and the coming of a new age when their values would bevindicated.Consistent with the behavior of cultists formalizing their rebirth andentry into a true church by abandoning an old identity and severingexisting social ties, Vintras’s disciples were re-christened with the nameof an angel – a name, forgotten, he maintained, at the time of theirspirit’s descent and imprisonment in the flesh. Generalizing his ownrole asthe Organ, adopting the name Sthrathanaël, Vintras assembledhis core congregation in Tilly in 1839, where he installed a sanctuaryupholstered in crimson velvet, dedicated an altar to the Sacred Heart ofJesus and another to the Virgin, and began disseminating the teachingsthat would revolutionize his countrymen. “The reign which is at handis no longer the reign of fear and calculation. It depends entirely onGrace, but it offers men all the beauty, riches, and delights of heaven,as much as can be experienced by a creature exiled to the world of men.This kingdom is the kingdom of Love. The Holy Spirit will spread overa regenerated world the divine fires of an ardent charity, one awaitedby all those inwardly lamenting the injustice, the selfishness, and therapacity of the people of this unhappy century.”9As Vintras’s colloquies with angels became more frequent and betterpublicized, he increasingly attracted the censure of the church. From theoutset, Vintras had professed unwavering adherence to Catholic ortho-doxy. Of the prophet’s vision of the glorious inauguration of the age ofthe Paraclete, Vintras’s lieutenant had admonished followers: “Do notbelieve this future will bring any change to the church of Jesus Christ,"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"122Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Franceto its dogmas, its sacraments, its moral philosophy, or its worship. It willnot be a new religion but rather the triumph of the present one: Catholicand Apostolic.”10However, Vintras’s dialogues with saints, his manu-facture of miraculous Hosts inscribed, he insisted, with letters writtenin Christ’s blood, resulted first in his imprisonment for fraud in 1842and then his excommunication and relocation to Belgium and later toLondon, where he maintained his church in exile.InL’Eternel Evangile(The Eternal Gospel), Vintras begins by reinter-preting Biblical narrative, retelling the Genesis story, describing therevolt by Lucibel, Vintras’s name for the Angel of Light, recountingthe Fall and man’s banishment from Paradise. Identifying himself asthe last of the Old Testament prophets (“Behold, I will send before youElijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes”Malachi4.5), Vintras asserts the need for a new Gospel whereby evil willbe struck down, the serpent crushed underfoot, and the messianic Eaglewill be freed and given flight. The Seven Thunders of Truth, which anangel had ordered sealed, will be released, so that the scroll that Vintrasreads will be terrible and solacing, “bitter to [the] stomach but sweet ashoney in [the] mouth” (Revelation10.8).As the vessel in which Elijah manifests himself to man, Vintrasforetells matter’s rarefaction into light, the suffering body’s volatiliza-tion, crucified flesh resurrected aspneuma, insufflating man’s soul andbuoying the wings of the Holy Spirit. “Elijah came in the allianceof the body-people, but he will return with the generation of thesoul-people.”11In Vintras’s oceanic, often unintelligible prose, he describes Elijah’sunderstanding the generative principle of creation, his seeing materialbodies turned into prayer, atoms of mud made pure like baptismal tears.Watching the fermenting acceleration of corporeal beings through thenecessary changes of form, he observes bodies being rendered incorrupt-ible, the beatified entering into the celestial spheres “without having toundergo first their soul’s stagnation.” The Elect, enjoying “the full leav-ening of the leaven,”12experience the combustion of the Just, becoming“the devout who rise in flames.”13Following the Dolorist era when an embodied God was conceived,was born, and died to redeem the world, the age of the Paraclete willwitness a eugenic ennoblement of the chosen, an absolution of the sex-ual act which, having caused man’s fall, will allow him to rise again.In the Third Age, only an aristocracy of pure souls will be fruitful. “Theaction of the Paraclete,” says the astrologer, Gévingey, in Huysmans’sLà-bas, “will extend to the generative principle; the divine life will sanctify"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"The Mystic123those organs which will procreate only the elect, beings exempt of origi-nal sin and no longer needing to be tested in the furnace of humiliation.This is the doctrine of the prophet Vintras, that extraordinary illiteratewho wrote so many solemn and ardent pages.”14Despite such presentiments, Huysmans’s gloomy characters feel thetime is far away when the Reign of Fire will succeed an era of medi-ocrity and greed, when Jesus will appear “in a whirlwind of gloriousmeteors.”15The utopia Vintras foretells seems an impossible chimerain a fin de siècle hallowing the triumph of materialism, money wor-ship condemning the wretched to be despoiled and mocked by richbourgeois. Before the elevation of thesoul-people, sin’s scoria must beburned away, fired in the crucible of suffering, consumed in the furnaceof humiliation.The suffering womanIn his bookHoly Tears, Holy Blood, Richard D. E. Burton remarks on asingular phenomenon occurring in France in the latter half of the nine-teenth century. Believing it was their duty to carry on the work of thePassion, many French women had welcomed unspeakable torments,“not just for their own individual salvation, but more pertinently, forthat of their nonbelieving fellow countrymen and women for whosesake they willingly assumed, and even actively sought out, pain [...]and ultimately death in order to redeem them – literally ‘buy themback.”’16When Vintras promoted women to positions of importance inhis church – when he assigned them the responsibility of undoing theoriginal sin they had caused – he accorded them new influence whiledefining their role as expiatory victims whose suffering was uniquelyefficacious. While, for Vintras and his followers, women were still seenas intellectually inferior, inarticulate beings governed by instinct, theywere afforded an immediate apprehension of the divine that was deniedmen dominated by their analytical faculties. Compassionate and mer-ciful, given to weeping and bleeding, women suffered in silence toredeem the sins of their children, yet they knew God in a way that wasdisallowed male priests.Not surprisingly, among the tenets of Vintrasianism that mostappealed to the mystic writers of the fin de siècle was the promo-tion of the Virgin Mary as merciful intercessor. Vintras’s cult of Marygoes beyond familiar Catholic hyperdulia, in designating all women asmediators whose suffering brings pardon and delivers grace. As RichardGriffiths notes, Vintras associates Mary with the Gnostic conception of"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"124Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FranceSophia, who, in her higher form, had remained above, “in the sphereof light,” and who, in her lower form, had been trapped in the realmof darkness and corporeity. “Through this dualitySophiabecame thefallen divinity through whom the mingling of light and dark, of spiritand matter, in the world, had been achieved; she was also seen as theintermediary between the lower and higher worlds and an instrumentof redemption.”17Griffiths cites a passage from the text of theSacri-fice Provictimal de Marie, one of Vintrasism’s central rites, to illustrate awoman’s role in effecting man’s spiritual elevation: “Oh, created Wis-dom, you who have forever been the unchanging reflection of WisdomIncreate, it was thanks to your prayers and maternal mediation that thelaw of penitence allowed us to hope for our re-ascension, to hope thatwe will attain our supreme end by being created anew as angels.”18Vintras may rejoice in the consecration ofla Femme Assomptive(theAssumptive Woman), who, in emulating Mary, catalyzes evil into for-giveness. But while men are purified as seraphs and fly into immaterial-ity, woman’s role is to remain below and bring forth sons condemned todie. Vintras anticipates the fin-de-siècle filiation of Eve and Mary, bothafflicted with the pain of childbearing, giving birth to offspring theymourn forever.In Vintras, man remakes himself in the image of his Creator, becom-ing spiritualized as a reflection of the Holy Spirit, a wing, a flame, abreath. “Despite all human defects, this Spirit-Man remains no less anAngel, and as a consequence, more justly and more perfectly similarto Jesus Christ. Without ceasing to be God, the Word was made flesh,and the Angel, without ceasing to be an Angel, was joined hypostati-cally with the flesh made man.”19Women, on the other hand, eternallyengender suffering bodies. So when, in Vintras’s Gospel, Mary stands atthe foot of Christ’s gibbet, she says her eyes are opened, “and I saw thatmy maternity was not extinguished and that my unspeakable tortureswere those of a new childbirth.”20Preceding the death of Decadence when flesh will be cast off, sufferingintensifies so that the spirit is released. InLà-bas, Huysmans describeshis admiration for the painter Matthias Grünewald, whose Crucifix-ion shows the transformation of man into divinity. Radiating out ofthe cloaca of the ignoble body churning with sanies, dissolving intosweat and serosity, is the miraculous charity that redeems. According toHuysmans, Grünewald’s genius is to capture the moment when the Songives way to the Spirit, and when corporeity turns into love. Apocalypticvisionaries like Vintras embrace this sense of salutary catastrophism, ashumanity’s rebirth comes only after the flesh is broken down. Sacrilege"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"The Mystic125on a cosmic scales, horror, monstrousness, and perversion are harbingersof the decisive moment when the Messiah will return to expunge them.Decadent mystics like Huysmans seek to identify the point where thesoul emerges from the tortured body, demonstrating pain’s efficacy as anagent of penitential transmutation. In Vintras, it is the Mater Dolorosawho accomplishes this theogony. Having given Angels to the Heavensand a Redeemer to Mankind, she will deify Creation: “I will bring forthgods from God.”21While women were assigned a central place in Vintras’s church andwere admitted to the priesthood in the Ordre de la Miséricorde, theirprivileged role was to suffer in the body so that the body could betranscended. As Huysmans writes, before seekers could experience amystic fusion with the Lord, acceding to the ineffability ofunitive life,itwas necessary to pass through “the twilight of purgative life.”22“Saintshave a noisier, more expansive role, crisscrossing the world, creatingor reforming monastic orders, converting idolaters, acting with theireloquence from the pulpit, whereas women writhe in silence on theirbeds.”23Joseph Boullan, who succeeded Vintras as the leader of the Orderof Mercy, was the first to suggest to Huysmans the occult significanceof women’s suffering. At the time of Huysmans’s visit to Lourps inAugust 1885 – a sojourn fictionalized in his novelEn Rade(1887) –Huysmans’s long-time friend and mistress, Anna Meunier, had alreadybegun exhibiting signs of deteriorating physical and mental health.Huysmans’s helpless contemplation of Anna’s agonizing decline, cul-minating in her death in the asylum of Sainte-Anne in 1895, focusedthe author on the mystery of the suffering of innocents. So when thenovelist met Boullan for the first time in 1890, he was comforted byhis theory of Mystic Substitution, the notion that “many Christiansengaged in the work of expiation suffered from mysterious diseases,which were not to be confused with diabolical maladies and whichno doctor should attempt to cure.”24Having persuaded Huysmans thatAnna’s illness was possibly “of divine origin,”25Boullan impressed theauthor with the power and the purpose of redemptive suffering. Theseconvictions remained with Huysmans through his life, allowing him togreet death with equanimity, enabling him to refuse treatment for themouth cancer that would kill him in 1907. In a letter to Adolphe Retté,Huysmans describes suffering’s redemptive virtue: “Remember the replythat Jesus made to Saint Teresa when, overwhelmed with tribulations,she could not help complaining to him of his severity: ‘Daughter, thatis how I treat those I love.”’26Never, as Huysmans believed, did God"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"126Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francecompromise the freedom of his children. Never did he impose his willon those too weak or too unwilling. “Always, throughout the ages, hefound saints willing to pay sin’s ransom with their suffering.”27Yet while Huysmans accepted the harrowing of the body, the hum-bling of the ego as an antidote to the tepid religiosity of his peers, it washis view that men were wordsmiths who wrote at desks or preached frompulpits, while women writhed in bed, undoing sin with their afflictions.The most spectacular phenomenon associated with the heresy ofVintras reinforces the connection between God’s will and human suf-fering, women’s agony translated into men’s visionary language. For thefirst time on June 24, 1840, Vintras’s followers witnessed the inexpli-cable appearance of communion Hosts in the sanctuary of Tilly. Laterthat year, Vintras, in the company of two disciples, was in the midst oflifting from the tabernacle a cardboard folder containing the Eucharistwhen, upon opening it, he exclaimed that the Hosts were imprintedwith a heart outlined in blood, vermilion and still fresh, as the prophetascertained.In succeeding months, similar events occurred with impressive regu-larity: empty chalices miraculously filled with ambrosial wine, celestialmusic, pleasing odors that seemed to emanate from nowhere. Yet nosupernatural mystery was more dramatic than Vintras’s bleeding Hosts.In 1841, on Christmas night, in a state of visionary ecstasy, Vintrasreceived from God a communication that the image of the bleedingheart had come from heaven, and that if Christ had manifested himselfto Vintras in that fashion, “it wasn’t blood that fell; it wasn’t an imagethat it revealed. It was Christ’s living heart, living as it is in the HolyEucharist.”28The identity of the species of the sacrament as substance andappearance – Christ as food and body – is reconfirmed in Vintras’sHosts, where the Crucifixion drama is re-enacted in the present. Tor-mented flesh, usually associated with the martyrdom of women, isindistinguishable from male language expressed in texts of blood. God,abstracted as theLogosor incarnated as his Son, shares male and femaleattributes as matter and as spirit. According to Brooke Hopkins, Christis often conflated with his mother. A “maternal imago” representing“certain strikingly feminized qualities: patience, nurturance, the abil-ity to love,”29Jesus, in the Eucharist, figures Mary as sacred aliment:“the infant’s incorporation of the mother, her breast, the nourishmentfrom her body.”30As Vintras writes, there is no sorrow comparable tothe Virgin Mother’s, whose heart is pierced with swords and whose painis written as forgiveness."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The Mystic127As Griffiths comments, Vintras’s Sacrifice Provictimal de Marie is “acleansing rite freeing man from the fetters of matter and bringinghim nearer to the spiritual redemption which would announce theThird Reign.”31With Huysmans’s “propitiatory victims” and Vintras’sProvictimal Sacrifice of Mary, there is an imprisonment in the bodywhose crucifixion frees the spirit, female martyrdom described in maletexts that announce an end of corporeity, that efface the difference instatus between genders. Eliphas Lévi, the thaumaturge and historian ofmagic, may dismiss Vintras as a madman, calling his sect “anarchic andabsurd.”32Yet he refrains from discrediting the supernatural authentic-ity of Vintras’s bleeding Hosts. “Doctors have analyzed the vermilionfluid that issued from these Hosts and have concluded that it trulywas human blood.”33Despite Lévi’s pronouncements, it matters less ifVintras’s prophecies were the delirium of a madman, if his rapturousvisions were hallucinations born of a disordered mind. Whether a mys-tic or a charlatan, Vintras’s significance lies in his reflecting the mysticalthinking of an era that sought to mark the moment that a tortured bodyturned into a liberated spirit.Transcending the bodyThe function of women’s bodies in facilitating escape from the worldand accession to an ethereal realm is also illustrated in the Vintrasianpractice ofascensional redemption, which Stanislas de Guaïta calls “thegreat Arcanum of the Carmel.”34An idea whose inspiration is ascribedto Boullan, it was a ritual which, as Guaïta says, involved all manner ofperversion yet was a central ceremony in the worship conducted in theOrder of Mercy.Having infiltrated the sect, Guaïta’s Rosicrucian brother, OswaldWirth, compiled correspondence which he believed provided conclu-sive proof of the pseudo-mystical debaucheries engaged in by Vintras’sfollowers. Lévi, in a brief allusion to these sacrilegious rituals, describesparticipants gesticulating, weeping, “exclaiming ‘Love! Love!’...youwill permit us to omit the rest” as Lévi writes discreetly.35While being colored by his antipathy for Vintrasianism and its adher-ents, Guaïta’s account of the historical derivation of this rite and its sym-bolical significance confirms Vintras’s view of the body as an instrumentof its transcendence. As in Grünewald’s painting where degradation ofthe flesh allowed a revelation of the soul, Vintras’s ascensional redemp-tion involves a carnality that purifies – indulgence in sexual excess inorder to undo man’s first transgression. The rite, as Guaïta argues, is"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"128Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francemodeled on a Talmudic allegory adopted from theZo’har, in which “thebodily vitality of the first couple was infected in its very sources by thefermentoflustthatmixeditselfin.”36In condemning Eve to endurethe pain of childbearing, God inflicted a suitable punishment, center-ing it on the organs “through which she sinned.”37Women who had beenagents of the Fall are enlisted by Vintras to undo the consequences oforiginal sin.According to Guaïta, Vintras – in spite of his modest education –had intuited the principle of a hierarchical ordering of beings, thephylogenetic interconnectedness of simple and complex life forms, “theinnumerable links between mineral, vegetal, human, celestial, and spir-itual existence,”38all structured, Guaïta says, by “the law of biologicalgradation.” As sex was the act that caused the Fall, it was also theact that ensured redemption. Initiating movement up and down themoral, physical, and spiritual levels of being, Vintras’s ritual alloweda sanctification of the generative organs, with copulation serving asan instrument of its own exoneration. Intercourse with higher entitiesresulted in the practitioners’celestification, while sex with animals orelementary beings ennobled or raised them up, so that the ritual’s effectwas “enable them to climb, rung by rung, the ascending ladder of life.”39Like other detractors of Vintras and hislupanar sacré(sacred brothel),Guaïta ends by enumerating the deplorable consequences of suchexorbitancies: adultery, incest, bestiality, incubism, onanism – “estab-lished as acts of worship, both meritorious and sacramental.”40Whetherthese accounts are accurate or exaggerated, the practice of ascensionalredemption depended, as Guaïta argues, on the principle ofthe bodyin glory. The notion of flesh as a crucible of suffering or an agent ofredemption was one that gained widespread acceptance among fin-de-siècle intellectuals. Vintras’s bleeding Hosts return the risen Christ tothe point of his departure, as body fluid that buys back sin, food sharedamong the consumers it elevates. In order to allow the ongoing ascen-sion of men transformed into angels, Christ must continue to descendinto the suffering sacrament.The triumph of materialismInLe Glaive sur Rome, Vintras describes being awakened in the night bya radiant celestial emissary.

They gave off a roar loud enough to frightenhell itself.”44First the Word that absolves turns into the unattainableEucharist; then the devil chokes off contritional speech, becoming theblasphemous tongue that makes the penitent mute.In a profanation of true faith symbolized by the immaculate Mother,the mystical Schekina, Vintras sees a golden idol concretizing allof man’s transgressions: “their cupidity, their deceit, their hypocrisy,their fraud, their contrivances, their infernal trafficking, and theirprostitution.”45Like Huysmans, who also considered capitalism diabol-ical or sorcerous, the essence of a perverted wish for transcendence,Vintras’s Idol is the Wanton of the Apocalypse, “The Great and SavageApostasy.”46What Vintras sees in his vision is illustrative of a Decadent belief thatevil identifies the physical body astelos, not as the site where suffer-ing redeems the sins of the flesh. Writing inLe Diable et l’Occultisme,Papus argues: “God is the Spirit whose final antithesis is Matter. Thedevil is what gives matter pre-eminence over the spirit.”47While refut-ing paranoid rumors of Luciferian cults spreading across the world,"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"130Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FrancePapus still locates evil in materialism as immanence. The devil works byfrustrating the power of language to abstract objects into sacred mean-ings. Unenslaved by the iconolatry blighting misers, kings, and clericsstooped beneath the magnificent weight of their priestly raiments, thepoor are purified by dispossession. Conversely, Papus writes in his point-edly anti-Positivist comment: “The true priest of the Adversary on earthis the materialist/atheist for whom all spiritual forces are the product ofa cerebral weakness disposing them toward mysticism.”48In his eschatological dream, Vintras reaffirms the fin-de-siècle urgeto check the incontinent sprawl of physical reality. Images of softness,viscosity, excrement, putrescence, and immoderation characterize hisdescriptions of hell that look forward to Sartre, while heaven is picturedas adamantine and clean: “a place of magnificent simplicity.”49Deca-dent mysticism as a minimalist principle of distillation situates God inhis name, matter in intelligence, diffuse ideation in prayerful attention.As an agent of diabolical hygiene, money simplifies and concentrates,turning present objects into putative values. Money-adoration is also anexpression of faith. But by hyper-cathecting things that money makesabsent, the materialist represses the urge to take flight. The capitalist,chained to substances occulted as symbols of exchange, is earthboundwhile, in Vintras’s vision, the pure are inspired by Adonai, who hasflames shooting out from his soles.Sacred sublimationIn Vintras’s vision, the Jubilee is experienced as incandescence and per-fume, clarion music, fire consuming matter into celebration. As lightproduces fire, as fire produces air, as air produces water, earth – “in eachof its humid divisions” – produces bodies whose isolation is reabsorbed“into its principal center.” Priests of the divine Word, through the per-formance of their sacrifice, lift the humble up from the elemental levelsof their being: “from instinctivity, abstractivity, and specialty” until theyre-experience “luminous unification.”50In these synesthetic intuitionsof ecstatic correspondence, fragrance, sound, and color – trinitarian con-stituents of Light – are like the justice, truth, and wisdom that manrecomposes in the eternal Word.In the Third Age, the officiants in Vintras’s Church of Mercy will beEucharisticandVictimal Pontiffs. Their rites will re-enact the transfor-mation of suffering corporeity into nourishment that saves.

The clericswho persecuted him are taxed with vainglory and greed. Coveting powerand prestige, they served themselves and not the Lord. But in exco-riating the Church of Rome, Vintras does more than execute revengeon those who banished him as a heretic. Vintras adopts, modifies, andreformulates established dogma in unorthodox ways.Having championed a belief in the Immaculate Conception, asGriffiths says, “years before the promulgation of the dogma,”52Vintrasinveighs against the Vatican for advancing the same doctrine as anexpression of Papal infallibility. Vintras’s insistence on feeding thenaked and giving drink to the thirsty refines traditional Christian exhor-tations to raise up the fallen and welcome the prodigal. Preaching andpracticing mercy, Vintras’s pontiffs are taught to emulate the VirginMother, who swayed God with her petitions. “She begged for forgive-ness for her nation, and with a hand stretched out over her people,called for compassion and mercy.”53Succoring the poor, his followerswill hasten the coming of the Era of the Holy Spirit. “Since the kingdomof Jesus Christ witnessed only his humiliation, suffering, Passion, anddeath, the splendor and brilliance concealed by this merciful labor willappear to the eyes of the universe, bringing confusion and death to theselfish.”54As men are descendants of angels and again become souls disin-carnate, they will celebrate the sacrament through the power of theirsacrifice. New gods, the Elohim will be life-sustaining nourishment:“men, living as we have lived, will become generous Hosts. By join-ing their suffering to the suffering of their brothers, they will combinetheir debt and reduce it to flour, flour kneaded with the tears from theirhearts. They will become the life, the strength, and the spiritual powerof that Host by virtue of the love of Jesus Christ.”55In Vintras’s production of Communion Hosts covered with Christ’sblood, he goes beyond the Gnostic rejection of the scandal of theIncarnation, since flesh is sublimated and sanctified by pain.Likely originating with Vintras and propounded by Boullan, the doc-trine of Mystic Substitution is used in an economic model of Redemp-tion as transaction: Christ as the creditor, mankind as the debt-holder,suffering as liquidation of one’s own or others’ trespasses. Willinglyperformed, sacrifice is currency that buys back.

Applied to thepoor, the psychoanalytic dictum that money is excrement reinforces theidea of the exchange-value of misery. As money substitutes for the com-modities it abolishes, the unsightly poor suffer in place of the wealthythey redeem. Squalid, the poor are money stripped of its glitter and itssheen. While money may be odorless –pecunia non olet– the indigentare black, pestilential, and invaluable.A squatting, golden idol symbolizing surplus, money opposes thevagabond as an embodiment of scarcity. The duality of the sacramentas the Philosopher’s Stone of alchemy and as sustenance for the spirit iscaptured in the poor, who are food that consumers are ashamed to eat.As Bloy writes the blood of the poor is “the money one worships, theEucharistic money one drinks and one eats.”56The poor man, whoseexploitation is both “money-gain” and “mouth-gain,”57becomes, in asoteriological economy, both worthless and priceless. Manure fertilizingregeneration, suffering plants in the corruptibility of the body what itharvests in the immortality of the soul.When Vintras reiterates the Christian precept that “the poor aretruly the living members of Jesus Christ,”58he does more than indictthe church for its love of opulence and pomp, for money spent onaltar dressing rather than on nourishment for the hungry. Members ofChrist’s body – Hosts kneaded with tears and blood – they are figures ofthe hypostatic identity of Christ’s humanity and divinity.FraternalismThe prominence that Vintras accords to the misbegotten and ill-favorednot only served as a reminder of the Christian virtue of humility. It alsoestablished Vintras’s church as a model of the hierarchy of Christ’sflock, in which the prostitute, the repentant sinner, the pauper, andthe vagrant were lifted up while the rich and influential were castdown from their thrones of power. Vintras’s followers, often members"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"The Mystic133of a disenfranchised aristocracy, responded favorably to this idea of aninstitutional reordering, in which generosity and self-sacrifice replacedhereditary privilege. For them, an aristocracy of character could effec-tively be demonstrated by a willingness to use their talents in the serviceof humanity.Consistently, in Vintras’s teachings the most execrable of vices is theselfishness that locks the sinner in a prison-house of egotism, obliv-ious to the woes of others, unengaged in Christ’s Passion. For theCatholic mystics whom Vintras influenced, the poor offered an escapefrom self-involvement, a release from the confines of solipsistic intro-spection. Charity brought a restoration of a lost sense of fraternalism,flight from “this great penitentiary that it changes into paradise.”59Unlike the selfish person plunged in the immobilizing nirvana of hisnarcissism, the altruist is restless in the bestowal of the gift of himself.The apocalypse envisaged by the fin-de-siècle mystic marks an end tothe self-sequestration of the Decadent recluse who, “out of aristocraticdisdain, locks himself in his interior universe, away from the vulgarambitions of others.”60The Thebaïd of the artist immured in the sanctuary of his cherishedsingularity is opened up, and the individual merges with a multi-tude of neighbors. While mystical experience is autistic and isolating,incommunicable to the profane from whom the ecstatic is cut off, theDecadent visionaries who follow in Vintras’s footsteps still proselytizeand preach in works intended for an audience.The aftermath of Decadence, as Pierre Citti has remarked, saw arevalorizing of the idea of energy exchanges, a reinvigorated sense ofnationalism and of political engagement. While Vintras’s prophesiedrebirth in the era of the Holy Spirit, his fin-de-siècle successors wereaffected by their contemporaries’ ideology, by a sense of solidarity with achosen brotherhood of the enlightened. The lifelessness of a church par-alyzed by institutional rigidity is countered by what Vintras saw as hismessage of inclusion. The pageantry and splendor that seemed to mockthe disinherited had reflected a Decadent aesthetic of elitism and claus-tration. Leaving behind a fallen world of loneliness and lovelessnessmeant renouncing the self-adoration that had truly been impoverish-ing. The loss of self in God, a relinquishment of materialism, sacrificialservice in the interest of community all accompanied the Decadents’rediscovery of transcendence.For Vintras and his disciples, the sterileculte du moiwas supersededby a cult of Mary. As a condensation of the virtues of maternalismand clemency, the forgiving and forgiven woman is “a figure for a new"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"134Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francehumanity”61– “a great sinner who loved enough so that her sins wereturned into a perfume of inestimable worth.”62While Mary’s lot is tobring forth a god who is destined to be crucified, she also announces anera of consummation and fulfillment: “she signifies also the slumber ofa patient Mercy that one day will enable us to find the plenitude of ourhope and achieve the dearest object of all our desires.”63ConclusionVintras himself did not live to witness the fruition of his visions. Hismost elaborate explanation of the Order of Mercy’s charge, his articu-lation of the important role of women and the poor, came when theprophet was living in exile in London in the 1850s. After Vintras’srelease from prison in 1848 came the period of “the great revelations”as Garçon has described them. Persuaded of the need to reward his fol-lowers for their steadfastness, Vintras re-established his Church in Tilly,where he combatted accusations of apostasy and regaled disciples withfurther miraculous displays of bloody Hosts and wine-filled chalices.Having been cast out of the church, he invoked his role as the newprophet in order to lay claim to the sacerdotal prerogative to celebrateCommunion: “wishing to renew his priesthood, God made his prophetthe first pontiff and ordered him to consecrate a new apostolate.”64In May of 1848, Vintras beheld in a vision Jesus, accompanied byAdam and Melchizedek, his Genesis precursor, all bearing nacreousscepters, cups of blood, and swords of gold. Instructing Vintras in thedetails of the new liturgy, specifying the sacerdotal accoutrements heshould use, Christ ordered that Vintras wear a chasuble embroideredwith the image of an inverted Cross, symbolizing an end of the Reign ofthe Suffering Christ and the advent of the Reign of Christ in Glory.Of course, the more flamboyant the accounts of Vintras’s theo-phanic experiences, the more vitriolic was the church’s condemnation.In February of 1851, Pope Pius IX issued a missive to the Bishop ofNancy, in which he denounced Vintras’s claim to have founded a newapostolate consisting of laymen, his proclamation of the coming of theThird Age. Having resorted to these infernal machinations to subvert“the true doctrine of Jesus Christ,” Vintras, as Pius fulminated, had seteverything in motion “to turn the faithful from the truth of the Catholicfaith and lead them into the danger of eternal damnation.”65With the church’s increasingly strident attacks on Vintras’s ministry,the time was also ripe for the explosion of a new scandal that wouldshake the prophet’s movement. Accused by a disaffected disciple of"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"The Mystic135fomenting orgiastic practices, engaging in sodomy, sanctioning licen-tious or unnatural acts, Vintras found himself characterized as a pervertand devil-worshipper, a reputation that has followed him to the presentday. Leading fin-de-siècle occultists were among those who propagatedthis rumor: “Eliphas Lévi, Stanislas de Guaïta, Jules Bois credited it with-out hesitation,” with the result that Vintras’s name “is synonymoustoday with an immoral and shadowy priesthood.”66Threatened anew with arrest and incarceration, Vintras fled the coun-try in 1852, setting up his church in exile in Belgium and then inLondon, returning only occasionally to visit various church centers inFrance, exercising his itinerant leadership of the Order of Mercy until hedied in 1875 after a brief illness during a sojourn in Lyon.Despite the sulfurous odor and fiery Satanic halo enveloping Vintras’sministry, it was his vision of the approaching end of the world thattouched succeeding generations of philosophers and artists. In Vintras’steaching, the seemingly unbearable hardships visited on the faithfulwere not misfortunes to be endured but treasure that bought salvation.Appointed to positions of authority in Vintras’s church, women wereseen as doing what men could only talk of. By imitating Mary, theycould stay God’s vengeful hand. By consenting to the suffering that wasdesignated as Eve’s punishment, they could dedicate the pain of child-bearing to bringing forth a race of angels. Parturition will end, Vintrasbelieved, with the birth of a newly spiritualized humanity, when theneed for suffering will pass away, when “death shall be no more,” “whennight will be no more”, when man will “need no lamp or sun for theLord God will be their light” (Revelation24. 4, 5).Among the artists and intellectuals of the fin-de-siècle generation,Vintras’s doctrinal legacy was considerable and lasting. Preaching thegospel of an aristocracy of the dispossessed, he announced that, withthe dawning of the Third Age, they would be the inheritors of Christ’skingdom.In the apocalypticism of Ernest Hello – in the anguished sense ofhis unworthiness – one hears echoes of Vintras’s advocacy of self-sacrifice and abnegation. In J.-K. Huysmans, whose characters praiseVintras inLà-bas, there is a millenarian hope in the eternal reward ofthe despised. The doctrine of Mystic Substitution that Huysmans wouldembrace has its theological roots in the teachings of Vintras. And LéonBloy’s martyred mistress, the visionary madwoman Anne-Marie Roulé,was surely conversant with Vintras’s prophesies, as Richard Burton hasalleged. “Like Vintras and his followers, Anne-Marie proclaimed theimminent arrival, after the reigns of God the Father and God the Son, of"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"136Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FranceGod the Holy Spirit. She prophesied that Jesus was about to be releasedfrom the cross by Elias, and that a ‘secret,’ akin to the one given toMélanie at La Salette, was about to be revealed, with her [...]asitsprophet.”67What unifies these writers is their belief in an eschatological reversal –when the poor, Christ’s wounded limbs, would be made whole and reha-bilitated, when women, who, in accepting to be crucified with Christ,would effect the salvation of the sinner and take their rightful place inparadise. Artists and intellectuals, excluded from the redemptive work ofsacrifice, would have as their charge to announce the Messiah’s gloriousreturn.Indeed, for Vintras’s Decadent descendants, the Dolorist exaltation ofsalvatory suffering became especially fervent when the expected childwas the Paraclete. Similarly, at the end of days, when’s flesh’s harrow-ing was suspended – when the pleasures of the senses and gold’s gleamtransfixed no longer – the wealthy would be cast down and the dis-enfranchised lifted up. For Vintras, the Church of Rome, corrupted byits arrogance, would give way to a new religion that was truly uni-versal, where Eucharistic Pontiffs were the hungry consecrating bread,and when Victimal Pontiffs were sanctified by pain endured for oth-ers. A willing sacrifice of the one meant the joyful rescue of the many.Vintras’s message is thus an affirmation of fraternal generosity: As theEternal tells the prophet in his initial apparition: “I will instruct you inthe truth of charity and love. I will cultivate you in the way that human-ity needs to be cultivated. I will fashion you so that, within you, you willfeel the life of your brothers, so that you will know the glory that comesfrom living in them. You will suffer in them as you would in your ownlimbs, and you will come to think of yourself only by thinking of them.You will come to know the one true happiness described by the Apostleof the Gentle: you will find glory in the art of losing your soul in orderthat you may better seek the soul of your brothers. You will master thescience of forgetting your Self in order to remember the legitimacy andgreatness of Them.”68Ernest Hello: selected writingsDespite the Vatican’s energetic condemnation of the Prophet of Tilly,Vintras’s controversial doctrine, with its message of apocalypticism, res-onated powerfully in the generation of Catholic mystic writers. Whileformally professing adherence to orthodox church teachings, authorslike Ernest Hello, Léon Bloy, and J.-K. Huysmans aligned themselves"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The Mystic137with Vintras in insisting the end time was approaching. Typical wasHello’s view expressed in a letter to Bloy, in which the writer conveyshis impatient wait for the coming of theEvent. For Hello, calamity andconflict were harbingers of the return of the Messiah: “The approachingwar is probably the kind in which the Event will present itself. It mustbe different from ordinary wars. It must be the one that announces theApocalypse.”69Signs of the world’s end were found in the triumph of capitalismover faith, in the decay of morals, in the institutional corruption of thechurch. A priesthood seen as compromised by power-lust and simony,a people genuflecting before the idols of commerce and materialism, anation put to shame by pursuing colonial adventurism appalled writersalready disheartened by social decadence and secularism.Yet there was danger in espousing openly the tenets of Vintrasianism,as Maurice Barrès shows in his novelLa Colline inspirée(The Sacred Hill1913). There the Baillard brothers, visionary dreamers serving God intheir remote parish in the Lorraine, prove susceptible to Vintras’s brandof fulgurating Messianism, his view of Christ’s rehabilitation of thedisinherited and the downtrodden, and his emphasis on redemptivesuffering by which the forsaken are redeemed.In the novel, Barrès introduces Vintras as a secondary character,paraphrases his ideas, and measures their impact on unsophisticatedlisteners. After visiting Vintras in his Carmel in Tilly, Léopold Baillardrecounts to congregants his memorable audiences with the prophet.At that time Vintras had denounced a clergy estranged from God by sci-entific reason – for whom divine truth was not conveyed by revelation:“bishops have allowed religion to sink to the level of human nature;rationalism has corrupted them. And now a prophet has risen up.”70Incurred by sacrilegious overreaching by the Pope and church lead-ers, the forthcoming disasters predicted by Vintras confirmed existingviews of a decadent society verging on collapse. Reading Vintras’s male-dictions on Pius and his henchmen along with newspaper accounts ofworldwide calamity, Léopold is convinced of the imminent extinction ofthe race: “that year, Léopold was particularly well-served. In September,there were cases of cholera, in October, there was plague in the PersianGulf. In November, there were livestock epidemics and great losses onthe Stock Market.”71Barrès’s novel makes the point that the maladjusted and disenfran-chised find ready consolation in the promises of a salvatory eschatology.Responsive to the notion that Christ’s return will bring a redistributionof wealth and power, Baillard expresses views voiced before by Ernest"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"138Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FranceHello, a belief in areversal of values: “the surfeit of the poor,” “the finalelevation of the humble.”72Like Vintras, who, in administering L’Ordre de la Miséricorde, hadappointed women to positions of influence and power, Baillard pro-motes Soeur Thérèse as his liaison with the transcendental. Intuitive andsensitive – both a visionary and hysteric – Soeur Thérèse is assigned therole of prophetess and seer, Priscilla to Baillard’s Montanus, male andfemale messengers of the divine. Like Vintras and the Decadent writerswho were swayed by his predictions, Baillard adopts the Dolorist prin-ciple of participation in the Passion. The end of the Second Era of theMartyred Son can be hastened, as Vintras thinks, if the faithful climbthe Cross and perform Christ’s expiatory mission. In an ecstatic collo-quy with God, Vintras had heard angels pronounce humanity’s deathsentence. Wishing to intercede, Vintras had pleaded for God’s forbear-ance.Too long, as God had answered,have I witnessed the celebration ofthe Roman Mass. Too long have I seen my Son put to death anew each day.Explaining to Vintras that it was time to saythe new Mass, God had toldthe Organ it was the faithful’s turn to complete the work of the redemp-tion: “It is now up to humanity to perform the act of divine sacrifice.It is up to men to become the victims, to offer themselves up entirely.Humanity will be the new Christ, and Jesus will finally enter into hisrepose.”73While in the novel, Vintras’s followers agree to be crucified withChrist, their impracticality and zealotry cause their psychologicaldecline. Victims of their gullibility, they are expelled from the churchand their community.Imbued with naturalist elements of medical determinism, Barrès diag-noses the Baillards’ fanaticism as pathological. Yet the story of theruthlessness of the Church’s war against the renegade priests recalls thePope’s inexorable prosecution of his campaign against Vintras. In Barrès,the inchoateness of the Baillard brothers’ sentimental mysticism isinformed as much by the “inspirational quality of the landscape”74as by the persuasiveness of Vintras’s precepts. For Barrès, cultivationof theegowas of paramount importance, and so a religion of spiri-tual self-annihilation, the dissolution of souls in God, was attributableto an anomalous interaction between a place and its inhabitants –the lonely Lorraine countryside, suffused with its ghostly pagan his-tory, and the dreamy autochthons with their consoling visions ofJerusalem.However much Barrès describes the Baillards’ adoption ofVintrasianism as a product of spiritual geography, the novel’s subjectdemonstrates the persistent influence of the heresy well into the early"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The Mystic139twentieth century. Richard Griffiths notes the interweaving of some ofVintras’s central teachings with a fin-de-siècle worldview that shapeda literature of mysticism. Still, he concedes these authors rarely men-tion the prophet’s name or published writing. “For the reason thatVintrasism reflects so accurately certain aspects of the religious beliefs ofthe nineteenth century, it is impossible to conclude, solely on the evi-dence of similarities of doctrine, that an author’s work was necessarilyinfluenced by Vintras.”75Against the historic and intellectual backdrop of a turn of the cen-tury dominated by religious moderation, laicization, republicanism, andscientific reasoning, the Catholic authors who arguably were affectedby Vintras professed the same belief that divine truth was appre-hended through revelation. They adopted the same anti-intellectualism,embraced suffering in a way that seemed masochistic to their practically-minded peers. Inhospitable to assertions that mankind was progressingtoward enlightenment, they saw a race drowning in depravity andapproaching its final hour.Vintras’s reverence for the suffering poor as members of Christ’s bodyis elaborated in the Dolorism propounded by Vintras’s successor, JosephBoullan, and thereafter became a doctrine that found favor among thefin-de-siècle mystics. Vintras’s opposition of the faithful’s humility tothe arrogance of the Pontiff evolved into an advocacy of self-abnegationthat culminated in the mystic’s ego death. Both Vintras’s cult of Maryand the pro-feminist structure of his church led to the Decadents’consecration of women as conduits of the divine.Ernest Hello, virtually a forgotten figure in the history of Frenchletters – “posthumous before he died,” as Léon Bloy writes acerbically76–warrants reappraisal for his influence on two major disciples of Vintras:Léon Bloy and J.-K. Huysmans, the most prominent of the mystically-oriented fin-de-siècle Catholic writers. One reason for Hello’s disappear-ance into critical oblivion is the fact that his writing is unamenable togenre classification. Born in Lorient in 1828, educated in the law, Helloturned to writing in order plead “the special cause of Catholicism.”77Married in 1857 to Zoé Berthier, an overprotective and controlling wifewhose influence Bloy deplored, Hello spent his life in part in Paris andin part in Keroman, where he died on July 14, 1885.Hello’s only venture into fiction-writing, hisContes extraordinaires(1879), received mixed reviews from Barbey d’Aurevilly, who foundmany of his fantastic tales unworthy, and pitying disdain from Bloy,who deplores the collection’s “inexpressible wretchedness.”78After the demise ofLe Croisé(The Crusader), which he founded in1858, Hello contributed to the publicationLa Revue du Monde Catholique"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"140Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle France(The Review of the Catholic World), championing a view of the church “ashierarchical, centralized, and authoritarian.”79Hello’s books include a polemic against Ernest Renan, biographiesof Ruysbroeck and Angela of Foligno. Hello’s mystical exaltation andpatient study of Scriptural symbolism earned him recognition from afew of the fin de siècle more colorful figures, including Huysmans, Remyde Gourmont, and Robert de Montesquiou. However, during his owntime, Hello’s work was generally neglected. Jean-Claude Polet admitsto understanding Hello’s absence from literary histories if the defini-tion of literature “is limited to fiction and ingenious techniques ofexpression.”80However, Polet argues that Hello can be rescued from histaxonomic pigeonhole, as a writer of works expressing “superannuateddevotion,” if one assigns a central role to the sacred in human life – if“mens divinior” directs the thinking of an author.81Because Hello regarded literature as a vehicle for illumining man’srelationship with God, he dismissed what he regarded as fastidiousanalyses of psychology, fictional contrivances that glorified man’s weak-nesses and vices. For Hello, “who hated levity, caprice, and convention,”“there was never more than one true art: that of the Holy-Spirit itself.”82Hello’s use of literature as a forum for incriminating the vanity of liter-ature is a trait that reappears in leading fin-de-siècle Catholic novelists –in Léon Bloy, whose only novels decry the insipidity of modern writ-ing, in J.-K. Huysmans, whose post-conversion texts are leached of theirearlier Decadent shimmer, and who acknowledged “that the demandsof literature are incompatible with the demands of faith.”83Huysmans’sattempts at magnifying God, he feared, had diminished his expressivepower, leaving him a monochromatic style, “gray and dull, without anygreat communicative force.”84In Hello and his successors, the praise of poverty as a virtue extendedto a mortification of the author, whose linguistic cleverness is humbled.While no correlation establishes that if God is great, art must be small,these writers equated the death of self in God with an aesthetic of asceti-cism. Emancipation from the prison of terrestriality and pride meant, forHello, a renunciation of comfort, wealth, and status, and as importantly,an acceptance of the poverty of the human word. By himself, a man isnothing. His work is nothing, if not doxological. “Creation is possibleonly if one creates in imitation of God, by affirming, in the way thatGod does, only the things that truly are.”85Two short texts By Hello (“Ludovic” inContes extraordinaires, “Prière àsainte Catherine” [“Prayer to Saint Catherine”] inPrières et méditations)demonstrate his view of art as dispossession, as material divestment,"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"The Mystic141a disciplining of the ego, self-abnegation enacted in man’s soul andin his language. In “Ludovic,” the most celebrated of Hello’sContesextraordinaires, the eponymous protagonist is a man of means and socialstanding, until, one day, inexplicably, he rejects his life of indolenceand pleasure, afternoon outings in the woods, evening excursions tothe theater.According to Hello, the vacuity of life on earth divorced from God,the futility of wealth, achievement, and celebrity, entailed withdrawal ofinterest in mortal life and worldly things. For Hello, who once observed“I have a monopoly on infinite weakness,”86le néant[nothingness] wasthe term that best epitomized man’s lot. The only avenue by whichone nears an appreciation of the divine is by differentiating one’s nul-lity, one’s transience, and limitations from the incommensurability ofGod, defined as the negation of man’s nothingness. What appears tothe materialist as the totality of the real must be consigned to non-existence so that, by its absence, it reveals what is. “The person whoshapes marbles cuts the block, sacrifices matter, and frees the form: thatis the natural operation,” as Hello writes in “Les Ténèbres [“The Shad-ows”].” “The person who forms a statue into the divinity cuts awaynothingness, sacrifices form, and disengages fire: that is the supernaturaloperation.”87The descent of Hello’s Ludovic into the obsessiveness of avarice beginswith a similar disentanglement of essence from superfluity. Like themystic who frees himself from his fascination with glittering objects,undoing the bewitchment of desires that shackle him to bodies, Ludovicapplies the Midas touch that turns possessions into gold – gold that, inits deadness, should inspire revulsion and disdain.The tragedy of Ludovic is like the purification of the saint, as bothaccept privation ensuring greater intimacy with their god. Hello illus-trates how Dolorism applies to the practice of the miser: “the will tosuffer and make others suffer for the thing that one adores.”88Ludovicexhibits the abstractive vision of the Kabbalist, condensing the body ofthe real into sums and calculations, and of the paranoiac, for whom thehaphazardness of events is a harbinger of doom. The self-immolation ofthe martyr, tortured as a sign of privilege and election, is displayed byLudovic, who wishes to open himself up, mingling the essence of him-self with the distillate of riches, mixing gold, the blood of substances,with blood, the gold of life. The subject’s mystic fusion with a transcen-dental entity is enacted as the cutting of the miser’s hand that grasps hismoney: “One day, he had bruised his hands by convulsively squeezingthe worshipped object. Ludovic was pleased to see the drop of blood that"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"142Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francehad appeared on his bruised finger. The blood had touched the gold, andthe gold had touched the blood.”89Hello establishes a parallel between the miser’s relinquishment ofpleasure and the ascetic’s flight from the illusion of bodily life apartfrom God. Both exchange the dynamism of desire and satisfaction forthe stasis of equilibrium that Freud associates with the death drive –the tendency of living things to seek a state of rest, a recovery of inor-ganicism and entropic immobility. Sincele néantseeks to counterfeititself as energy and life, money-worship, in abolishing the object itreplaces, institutes a nihilism to the second power, the negation of whatis nothing.Thus, Hello shows the connection between avarice and religion,between gold as sacred fetish and the privileged knowledge of the holy.Manipulating symbols allows access to the sacred, where material real-ity has been sublimated into value. A chicken as a food source becomesuseless as its payment, yet saving money and going hungry afford a spu-rious purity and detachment. As Brown writes, “the value conferred onthe useless object, and the prestige conferred on the owner, is magical,mystical, and religious, and comes from the domain of the sacred.”90Hello contrasts the power of Eros, the vital energy of the world, withmoney as the Thanatotic restoration of anhedonia and lifelessness. Goldis the symbol of the divorce of misers from their libidinal satisfactions.It is what cuts them off from others objects, strands them in the time-lessness of anti-physis. As Ludovic amasses money, “the domain of theunnatural approaches. The monstrous begins to growl in the vicinity.”91Immanent in words is the desire to turn back into referents, as cashdesires its re-materialization as the commodities it eliminates. Similarly,theconte extraordinaireshould end with God’s extraordinary reappear-ance, but the avarice of Ludovic brings no miraculous theophany. “Thenature of things wants money to turn back into substance. The five-franc coin can become a chicken or a book. It can nourish the mindor body, can create healthy blood or robust ideas. In the house ofLudovic, the opposite occurred. Natural things turned into money, notto become natural things again. They did not return to the game of lifebut remained metal forever.”92Hello’s meditation on money-adoration as idolatry anticipatesHuysmans comments on the Satanic origins of capitalism and underliesthe fin-de-siècle sanctification of poverty. Instead of following psycho-analysis in linking religiosity and avarice – the timeless gleam of goldand the immaculacy of the disembodied soul – Hello opposes money’spower to destroy to God’s power to create. In Hello’s story, both are"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The Mystic143abstract principles generating absence. Both cancel the value of booksand chickens as nourishment for souls and bodies. But the deathliness ofmoney, hyper-symbolized by the coffin of Ludovic’s cashbox, contrastswith God’s inexhaustible capacity to fill nothingness with being.When Ludovic encloses in the strongbox the gold in which materialobjects have been entombed, he houses emptiness in a tabernacle andmakes his cellar into a shrine. Since sacredness increases as a functionof inaccessibility, Ludovic fetishes the container, the inviolability of itslocks, spending money on the safe that prevents him from handling hismoney. Converting material to metal, he gives up the life of symbols’bodies. Once his fortune is made untouchable, its value becomes inde-structible and infinite: “The object was taken out of circulation, shed itsperishable form, and entered into its immortality.”93Hello’s association of God and Gold, Mammon and Jehovah, is madeexplicit by the word Ludovic chooses for his combination lock. Fourtumblers with four numbers, represented by four letters, together forma word which, when composed, unlocks the safe. “What word should bechosen?” Hello writes, interrogating the Gematria of the miserly. “Theword itself would become sacred by being identified with gold.”94Ludovic’s deification of money, his choice ofGodorDieuas password,suggests that, more than hidden gold, it is the magic word that acquiresholiness. The apophatic statement, the unsaid title, the sacred shibbo-leth endow an onomantic power in God concentrated as his Name.Locked away in esotericism, knowledge grows greater by being hidden.TheTetragrammaton, the four letters that constitute God’s Name, arethe strongbox of the word whose meaning is unknowable and thereforepriceless.When Ludovic forgets the word and cannot retrieve his treasure, hisadoration of the symbol and desecration of its meaning incur pun-ishment for perverting a religion that spiritualizes by annihilating.In Hello’smise en abîme, he shows containers that nest inside containers,each concealing the contents they are entrusted with protecting. Likealchemy, enclosing wisdom in arcane symbolic boxes – behind imagesof the phoenix, the caduceus, the dragon – avarice is shown to be a pro-fane hermeticism. If money is seen as excrement and if what moneybuys is excrementalized, only the impregnable container, the forgottenkey are given value, in an occult system where secret knowledge is itsstatus as occult.For Ludovic, as Hello writes, gold had first devoured the thing, thestrongbox had devoured gold, and God had been devoured in his soul bythe hyper-symbolic nothingness of gold that was worshipped in God’s"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"144Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Franceplace. The sacred thing is therefore equated with the means of its recov-ery: utterance of the wordDieu, the Alpha and Omega that Ludovicforgets. “God was the point of departure and the point of arrival,” Hellosays of a religion predicated on the nothingness of bodies. “GOD”SNAME WAS AVENGING GOD.”95The ransom for corporeal beings is a religion that redeems, povertythat absolves, suffering that buys back. The talismanic value of theicon, coin, or fetish is its etymological value as thetelesmathat actsas payment.For Hello, avarice is a disorder, a blasphemy, a transgression since itsubstitutes a false system of obliterative symbols for a faith wherebyChrist redeems man’s nothingness with his death. When five francsoccult a chicken, money assumes a sacred value. When literature pre-tends to beauty, it not only eliminates the thing it represents; it alsodethrones religion and replaces it with aestheticism, proclaiming theheretical doctrine ofart for art’s sake.It is unsurprising that Hello showed little interest in fiction, a demi-urgic exercise performed by the lowly god-impersonator. Rather thantales or novels, Hello turned to a literature of petition, writing sacredhistory, hagiographies,prières et méditations. In subordinating the divineas content to art’s ornamentality as container, Hello felt that literaturehad lost its relationship with God: “art has fallen; the place of beauty ishenceforth closed to art.”96Doxological expression, originating in the nothingness of the sup-plicant, rises up as song toward the perfection of the eternal. As Hellocomments on the flower: “The blossoming rose offers the sun thespectacle of combat between manure and the light.”97Thus, in Hello, art-as-worship conveys the modesty of the speaker. Rooted in the manureof humility, adoration blooms as beauty.Hello who, in a prayer to the infant Jesus, had asked to learn thejoy of small things – to love the peace, the calm, and the childhoodof Nazareth – requests, in an address to Saint Catherine, to experiencethe pure negation of self. “What must I do to lose myself?

Teach me to forget myself in sleep, my Lord, until you eclipseme for eternity in your glorious awakening.”98Unlike the nothingness of money – infertile and inert – thenéantofthe believer is unfathomable like God. In his analysis of Hello, Jean-Claude Polet remarks on the homology of art, its attempt to utter theunutterable, and art’s subject, divine grandeur, beyond language andbeyond compass.

Thus, he refersto his writing as performing its immolation: “In order to speak of theinfinite, we must take the wordfiniteand offer it as a sacrifice. Is therenot a relationship between this operation of human language and theact of the flame which, in wishing to speak of the infinite in its way,seeksavictimforittoburn?”100Staged on the level of language, the mystical desire to be con-sumed in fire motivates Hello’s stammering use of prefixes of negation:infinity,immensity:without end,without measure. Unlike the name ofGod, uncircumscribable in its abundance and charity, property is “theimpersonal name of unhappiness. Its proper name is the self.”101For Hello, the inversion of apophasis isepectasis: an ascension towardperfection that can never be completed, “unending progress in faithtoward a beatitude that is perfect.”102In Saint Gregory’s use of theword, it is an eternal, rising journey, acquisition of knowledge that isboundless and self-multiplying. Epectasis is the opposite of Ludovic’slocked cashbox, without stasis or limitation, exclusive of “the idea ofcompletion.”103To Saint Catherine Hello prays that his heart be dilated, that hisinsignificance be magnified, that God’s majesty be magnified, “accord-ing to my misery and your mercy” (suivant mes misères et vosmiséricordes).104The more bottomless the petitioner’s abjection – themore inexhaustible God’s riches – the more generous the gift.What, in Huysmans, will be the bodily martyrdom of Saint Lydwine,what, in Bloy, will be the combustion that burns his heroine’s worldlyties, is performed in Hello as a ceremonial holocaust of language.

Huysmans:Sainte Lydwine de Schiedam(1901)Although the flamboyant prophet Vintras had been one of the mostcontroversial religious figures of the era – excommunicated from thechurch, driven into exile, deemed a Satanist, characterized as an incarna-tion of the heretic Montanus – he aroused less vehement condemnationthan his successor, Joseph-Antoine Boullan. After Vintras’s death inLyon in 1885, Boullan had already positioned himself to assume lead-ership of the sect. No less endowed than his predecessor with a flairfor the dramatic, Boullan had taken the title of Pontiff of the DivineMelchizedean Chrism. In imitation of Vintras, who had claimed to bethe new Elijah, Boullan had professed to be the re-embodiment of Johnthe Baptist. And “since Vintras had proudly displayed a mark in theshape of a dove in the center of his forehead,” Boullan “had a cabbalisticpentagram tattooed in the corner of his left eye.”108While Boullan provoked the censure of leading fin-de-siècle occultists,who denounced the orgiastic practices the Pontiff allegedly had spon-sored, he also gained the admiration of the era’s foremost chronicler ofthe supernatural, becoming the mentor to J.-K. Huysmans in matters ofthe occult. In disseminating Vintras’s teachings, Boullan further popu-larized the idea that, following the appearance of the Anti-Christ wouldcome a final, cleansing cataclysm, wiping away a society corrupted by“the Stock Market, gambling, and horseracing.”109Such notions wereappealing to reactionary Catholics like Huysmans, already disgustedwith a world tainted by cupidity and materialism. Like many of hisright-wing brethren, Huysmans had felt alienated from the church,disillusioned by the progressivism of Pope Leo, who, to Huysmans,had responded weakly to the growing trend toward laicization. ForHuysmans and Léon Bloy, the priesthood had become beholden to therich, abjuring mystical asceticism in favor of comfort and modernism.InLà-bas, the astrologer Gévingey had railed bitterly against theecclesia, whose liberalism seemed to signal a triumph of the devil:“Look at that timorous, skeptical Pope we have and his impotentschemes; look at our episcopate of Simonists and cowards; our flabby,good-humored clergy.”110This conversation among occultists markingthe conclusion ofLà-basis interrupted by exultant cries arising from"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The Mystic147the street, heralding the January 1889 election of General GeorgesBoulanger. A Franco-Prussian War hero and staunch detractor of monar-chism, Boulanger was seen as threatening to dissolve the Republic andmake himself a dictator. Despite the brevity of Boulanger’s triumph andhis suicide in Belgium in 1891, his ascendancy was viewed by Huysmansas a sign of dismal things to come. Contemplating the immediate future,Huysmans – like his character Durtal – saw only the “whirlwinds ofordure appearing on the horizon.”111The eschatological gloom with which Huysmans viewed the fin desiècle came from a sense of cultural decay and entropic devitalization, asa cadre of “dysenteric souls” reigned over a cold, exhausted planet. YetHuysmans’s anticipation of the apocalypse had been, paradoxically, acause for optimism since only disaster would allow for cosmic renewal toensue. As Jean-Marie Seillan remarks, Huysmans shared the anarchist’sconviction that political disintegration was a necessary precondition forrebirth. Sickened by the laicizing policies of the State, he shared withother counter-revolutionary Catholics “a desire to see the modern worldvanish into a cloud of blood in order that it might re-emerge, once it waspurified of its vileness.”112Yet Huysmans’s eagerness to see the world end made him feel no lessan exile in his era, and, like Durtal, he sought refuge in historic recre-ations of the Middle Ages. Those centuries, to Huysmans, had been atime when evil was majestic, when the people had been on fire with reli-gious zeal. At the century’s end, there had been no heroic figure capableof inspiring the faithful: “where have they gone, those saints who willsave them?” as Durtal’s comrade wonders.113In 1898, Huysmans had finally retired, after almost thirty years ofpeaceful toil, from his position at the Interior Ministry. Wishing to finda nurturing spiritual environment where Christian writers and authorscould benefit from association with a religious order, he had preparedto become an oblate at the Benedictine abbey in Ligugé, moving intoa house built the following year adjacent to the monastery. There aftermeditating on a project he had been long been planning, he began writ-ing a biography of the saint, born in 1380, in the author’s own ancestralhomeland.In Huysmans’s withdrawal into fifteenth-century hagiography, heillustrates the relevance of Vintras’s teaching on the apocalypse and thecentral role of women in hastening the coming era of the Paraclete.At the same time, he acknowledges the limited role assigned maleauthors, who are relegated to acting as chroniclers and record-keepers,witnessing a redemptive act but unable to take part in it. For Huysmans,"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"148Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francethere are no nineteenth-century saints who work to welcome theMessiah, and miracles are regarded as purely historical phenomena. Lesseffective than Vintras’s priesthood, the Catholic historian delivers inspi-rational messages intended to uplift his audience. Huysmans assumesa more important role as a prophet than as a historian, but whereasin bygone eras, the martyr’s suffering repaid the debt of mankind’ssin, the author suffers in his powerlessness to do more than transcribeand remember. InLydwine, the sacrificial act to which Huysmans acqui-esces is to subordinate the artist’s role to the redemptive power of hissubject.Liquidating the debt of historyIt is therefore unsurprising that writers associated with the Catholicrevival followed Huysmans in exploring mysticism through a studyof religious history. Like his predecessor, Ernest Hello, Huysmans hadturned to hagiography. And when Huysmans looked for living applica-tions of Vintras and Boullan’s teaching – a longing for the apocalypse,a belief in the inspirational role of women, respect for the sanctity ofthe poor through whom Christ’s Passion was re-enacted – he could findno better illustration than the religious records of the Middle Ages.Unlike his contemporaries who wished to experience only full bel-lies and empty minds, Huysmans sought to understand the religiousfervor enflaming Catholics of bygone centuries. Hoping to grasp theexperience of unitive ecstasy bestowed upon the visionary, Huysmansidentified with the martyr whose life he reconstructed. Indeed, hisresearch showed that the saints whose celestial transports were mostshattering had also lived in times when the world was convulsed bycalamity and war. Like other Decadent hagiographers convinced that“history is repetition,”114he sought a religious avenue for escaping fromtime as futility and entrapment.Huysmans’s biography of the life of the Blessed Lydwine of Schiedam,a fifteenth-century practitioner of Mystic Substitution, was motivated bya need to explain the mystery of suffering and to discover how partici-pating in the Passion brought an experience of resurrection that markedthe dénouement of history and the beginning of the Messiah’s reignon earth. It was Boullan who first taught Huysmans the principles ofreparative Dolorism, explaining that the disease that was gradually con-suming Anna Meunier might be a sign of her election, her role in payingthe price of others’ sins. To Huysmans, Anna’s involvement in the prac-tice of Mystic Substitution could be projected on a cosmic scale as themartyrdom of Saint Lydwine."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"The Mystic149The opening chapter of Huysmans’s book describes the torments ofEurope’s body as a macrocosmic image of the harrowing of Lydwine.As Elizabeth Emery writes in an insightful analysis of Huysmans’s text,the end of the fourteenth century proleptically announces the fin desiècle – presented as an eschatological crisis, not a discrete moment inhistory. Medieval kings and queens embroiled in sanguinary intriguewere supernatural embodiments of wickedness and chaos. Pestilenceand slaughter, raised to paroxysmal levels, seemed to augur the world’send that Huysmans’s readers knew had not occurred. The tableau orpanoramathat Huysmans paints of Lydwine’s era explains the author’scomment on the point of his martyrologic undertaking: “I am not writ-ing her life from an historical standpoint but from the point of view ofa mystic,” as he writes in a letter to Arij Prince.115The backdrop of Huysmans’s life of the unspeakably tortured vision-ary, a propitiatory victim who expiates the sins of others, is not somuch an historical document produced by archival research as a Bib-lical picture symbolizing the tumult of the end of time. As Emerywrites: “Despite his wish to summarize the history of fourteenth-centuryEurope, Huysmans surrenders to his imagination, reproducing stereo-typical images of the end of the world: battles, famine, plague, wildanimals. His unbridled imagination finally carries him away, and heabandons historical exactness in order to develop his moral and sym-bolic vision of an era in which every event makes reference to a divineorder.”116While Huysmans’s writing may mitigate the penance of his audience –historical consciousness experienced as repetition and frustration –his paradoxical evocation of the apocalypse as recurrence shows thatLydwine and her epigones had not freed man from time as malediction.Huysmans’s strategy may be to hide the specificity of history behindthe timelessness of the struggle between the light of Good and Evil’sshadow. He may ignore the problems and issues that particularize histime: “tuberculosis, syphilis, the development of industry,” in order todramatize concerns more relevant to religion: “the lack of religious fer-vor, Satanism that was raging.”117Yet in the nineteenth century, whatSeillan calls “the politics of martyrdom”118also required suffering to off-set specific national disgraces, liked the Dreyfus affair, a French officer’salleged act of treason, evil-doing linked by Huysmans to the spread-ing plague of Jewish influence. However, in Huysmans’s biography, theDolorist identification of Europe and the saint’s body suggests a modelof the Crucifixion as an eternally re-staged pageant whose completionallows the martyr to free her beneficiaries from time’s Purgatory."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"150Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FranceHuysmans’s lifelong meditation on the mystery of suffering hadafforded him an insight into time and guilt and punishment whoseinterconnectedness has been the object of psychoanalytic study. As aman of faith anxious for fulfillment of the Messianic promise, Huysmansawaited an apocalypse that would bring an end to history. To Huysmans,“it might be necessary to aggravate the plight of victims since it wasonly from a catastrophe that a potential benefit might arise.”119As sincreates the past, necessitating the work of expiation, “only the abolitionof guilt,” as Norman O. Brown remarks, is able to “abolish time.”120The psychoanalytic axiom that instinctual repression begets neuro-sis, producing time as a measurement of alienation from the body, alsosuggests that an Edenic past is recoverable as eternity reached when sinhas been forgiven. As the locus of transgression, the body is a medium ofredemptive suffering, so when sinners repay the debt of guilt, they movefrom corporeity into heaven. Accompanying birth, original sin entails afall into separateness, whence the mystic’s longing for lost unity, forfusion with the Lord.Suffering and the end of timeIn writingSainte Lydwine de Schiedam, Huysmans solves the mystery thathad perplexed him, discovering the utility of suffering that is visited onthe innocent. Rather than a trial to be endured, it is a privilege conferredby God, catapulting martyred subjects from a quotidian hell of unaware-ness into the incommensurability of pain and joy that, as extremes,become identical. By identifying with his heroine, Huysmans is able to“subdue his suffering, converting it into inner joy, into expiatory prayer,into a permanent hallelujah.”121In his previous novels, Huysmans’s protagonists had lived time as theticking of a clock, its hands moving in endless, pointless circles. Man’sexistence was not driven by the engine of God’s plan. It did not culmi-nate in a decisive moment of salvation or damnation but ebbed awaydownstreamacross a landscape of desolation, of failed relationships,insipid dinners, thwarted flights into transcendence. “Schopenhauer isright,” as Jean Folantin concluded: “’man’s life swings like a pendulumbetween sorrow and boredom. There is no point in trying to speed up orslow down the movement of the clock. All one can do is fold his armsand then do his best to sleep.”122Through the maturation of his faith, Huysmans had outgrown aview of suffering as an inverted image of ennui, had stopped believ-ing that the only way to escape the misery of life was to administer"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The Mystic151the anesthetic of automatism or sleep. By 1903, when he publishedhis autobiographical novel on monasticism (L’Oblat[The Oblate]),Huysmans may have abandoned his belief that monks performed theexpiatory work of others – that the cloister served as an “instrumentof Providence which refined evil in the crucible of voluntary suffering,thereby protecting the world and ensuring its survival.”123Following the1901 passage of the Law of Associations, prohibiting the formation ofnew monastic orders within France, Huysmans had faulted Pope Leofor not vigorously responding, blaming the Pontiff for his sympathy toRepublican ideas. The Vatican was thus complicit in the weakening ofmonasticism, whose charge was to offset the cumulative evils of humanhistory. The problem of suffering was redefined as abstract and atempo-ral, undertaken in all eras by martyrs succeeding one another throughthe centuries.InL’Oblat, Huysmans pictures Suffering as the faithful lover of theSavior, her loyalty inspiring martyrs to become the betrothed of Christthemselves. Suffering inL’Oblatis the structuring principle of history, aconsequence of birth, a recompense for the Fall, a dependable compan-ion whose presence lasts until the end of time: “She was the first-born ofthe work of man, and she has pursued him since then on earth, follow-ing him beyond the grave and to the threshold of Paradise.”124BesideChrist in Golgotha, she is a fiancée and partner, the female counterpartof theBeneficent Torturer, whose cruelty is a blessing. The Crucifixion cel-ebrates the nuptial union of flesh and pain, a marriage consummated asthe end of separateness and time.Huysmans’s epithalamium is permeated with mystical eroticism, withthe death of Suffering shown as simultaneous with the death of Christ.La Douleur, as Huysmans writes, fits a ruby crown around Christ’s head,which, like the diadem of thorns, is “an emblem of royalty.” Havingverified the scourge, the heaviness of the hammers – having assuredherself of the bitter gall and the sharpness of the lances – she climbs upon the gibbet where the marriage is consecrated, the union “of these tworeprobates of the earth.” Deliverance and accomplishment show thattime has been abolished since Pain is widowed “at the very moment shewas loved.”125It was by meditating on the example of the life of Blessed Lydwinethat Huysmans intuited the meaning of being crucified with Christ.As the believer is enjoined to love his neighbor as himself, he must alsowelcome suffering, “loving it in memory and in imitation of Christ’sPassion.”126When Huysmans was diagnosed with mouth cancer in1906, he refused treatment, rejected morphine injections, insisting he"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"152Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francedid not seek a cure, expressing a hope that, in his death agony, he mightemulate Sainte Lydwine.Huysmans’s biography of Lydwine is meant to be instructive in pic-turing the future saint as an unexceptional young woman – pious andobedient yet reluctant to accept her mission to liquidate the guilt beget-ting history. One of the lessons that Christ imparts to Lydwine is that theopposite of agony is not the transports of the soul, out-of-body flights toParadise. It is the torpor and insentience of daily life cut off from God –oblivious to sin, untormented by remorse, unaware that history is thedead time of selfish apathy. Only the Blessed experience the pain andrapture that enable them to come alive.Jean Pot, Lydwine’s confessor, describes anguish and ecstasy asoverlapping and interchangeable: “In a way, God reconciles the twoextremes of agony and bliss [...] and the soul would burst if martyrdomof the body did not let it catch its breath and afford it more delight. It isby completing the journey of suffering that one ascends into joy.”127Huysmans’s text incriminates a religion of prudence and modera-tion, in which an undemanding God asks no sacrifice of his children.The convulsive life of martyrs transports them from the Dark Night ofthe Soul to an absorption in the generative center of creation. Onceenlightened, Lydwine experiences time as neither biological nor his-toric. Stricken by insomnia, denied the narcissism of unconsciousness,she is constantly responsive to God’s voice. Subsisting on the Eucharist,she orders time, not by meals and appetites. At first, the liturgical calen-dar structures her awareness of human action, but when she flies withangels, Lydwine is lifted out of history.The martyr of timeHuysmans begins his book by indicating that the point of Lydwine’ssuffering is to balance the scales of good and evil, pay off the deficit ofhistory, re-establish an equilibrium in a metaphysical economy: “Godnever seemed more attentive in monitoring the balance between vicesand virtues, piling up, when the scales of iniquity descended, theagonies of saints that served as a counterweight.”128Huysmans frames the looming conflict as a military Armageddon,with the leaders of France and Flanders, Italy and England describedas reprobates and usurers, lunatics and weaklings laying waste to anentire continent already devastated by disease: On the one side, Satanmobilized his legions, emptying the precincts of hell.

But while agreeing to substitute herselfin order to undergo the punishment for humanity’s crimes, Lydwineis anchored in her time and is still provincial in her outlook. Shedevotes her suffering to save the souls of errant priests and repen-tant drunks, autochthons unimplicated in the struggle to forestall theapocalypse.Huysmans persistently cites his sources – Johannes Brugman, Thomasà Kempis, Jan Gerlac – to fix his subject as an ordinary and simple youngDutch girl: solitary, blond, contemplative, and cheerful, responsible inperforming her duties as a housekeeper, devoted to the Virgin, withwhom she shares a prefigurative sense of intimacy. Particularized by hertime and role, Lydwine still performs the same redemptive mission asthe few monks who, in 1902, continued to liquidate the debt of humansin, within cloisters seen by Huysmans as “again besieged by diabolicalforces.”130Throughout Huysmans’s compendium of nosological monstrosities,he shows Lydwine as incapable of thinking outside the historic frame-work of her era. Her plunge into the reparative agonies she endures formankind’s benefit starts with an ice-skating accident that occurs on anouting with her friends. Lydwine looks like her countrymen, practicesher faith the way that they do. Even the miraculous decomposition ofher suppurating flesh, its mystical distillation into an odor of sanctity,brings its conversion into a substance that is particular to her homeland:“the peculiarly Dutch fragrance of cinnamon.”131Even when Lydwine is accorded remission from her torments, escap-ing from her bed and body on trips to Paradise or Purgatory, sheis imprisoned in the conceptual box of the history of her epoch,seeing higher and lower worlds as imaged in medieval iconogra-phy. Huysmans’s comments on the solipsism of the fifteenth-centuryimagination reflect on him as well, since his landscapes of the after-life are constructs of the sensibilities of the fin-de-siècle artist. “Godalmost always adapts his visions to the imagination of those receivingthem.”132Taking account of the mystic’s temperament, cultural origins, andhabits, God adjusts the spectacle to the spectator while augmenting itsintensity, haloing it in a “glorious atmosphere inexpressible in words.”"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"154Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FranceThere is a disabling of the saint and author, who in their attempt to con-vey the vision, have to re-materialize the ineffable “in human languageaccessible to the crowd.”133By assimilating Lydwine’s glimpse of Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory tocanvases by her contemporaries, like the German Stephan Lochner –by reproducing images of burning dungeons with barred windows, theclanking of iron chains, the shackled damned impaled on pitchforks –Huysmans shows himself, more than his heroine, confined to the pic-torial history of museums. Lydwine is allowed by God to see thingswith a clarity “disallowed the feeble senses,” and so can rise abovethe representational conventions and limited lexicon of her time. ButHuysmans – unblessed with the gift of atemporality and omnipresence –has only recourse to his memories of the infernos of Bosch and Breughel,the paradisiacal gardens in the paintings of Van Eyck. The mystic cango to places that her biographer cannot, and while the martyr is lib-erated from language and personality, the historian is constrained byscholarship and history.Dispossession and eternal lifeFrom his acquaintance with Abbé Boullan, Huysmans had learned theprinciples of reparative Dolorism, a validation of suffering as morethan gratuitous existential accident. InLydwine, Huysmans’s analysis ofthe mystic’s path to unitive experience explains his emphasis on thesaint’s acceptance of pain and dispossession. As Eugène Vintras hadextolled the poor as members of Christ’s body, Huysmans also linksthe literal dismemberment of the saint to her loss of friends and com-forts, the erasure of body boundaries, a suppression of individual willthat comes with being crucified with Christ. Unable to escape repressionwhich condemns him to live in time, the Christian imagines accedingto eternity by dying and being born again in a mystic union with theSavior. Mnemonic traces of guilt and anger, neurotic symptoms trap thebody in a past where suffering does not forgive.In the economy of mysticism, Christ as “the greatest Mendicant”134asks the faithful for generosity, the surrender of material goods, arelinquishment of anxiety, the repurchasing of innocence through aforfeiture of everything. The poor, who are Christ’s children, can entereternal life because they have nothing, no attachments, because theyare dispossessed of objects which, as Brown says, “have to be seen ascrystallized time in order to be possessed as property.”135Lydwine’s purgative life begins with an apprenticeship in asceti-cism, which is signaled by her willingness to be unencumbered of"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"The Mystic155relationships. Feeling obliged “to pledge her virginity to Christ,” sheprays to be afflicted with an illness that disfigures, and when her wishesare fulfilled, her martyrdom begins. Social suicide is a first step towardreconciliation withthe Bridegroom, since human love, “in excludingGod, is only a parody of genuine love,” “a form of selfishness betweentwo people.”136Bodily life, like time in Purgatory, can be more speedily concludedwhen suffering hastens the blessed death that finally sets one free.Guiltlessness is paid for by the torments of the saint, enabling a returnto the eternity of childhood. Thus, the church treasures the innocentwho are persecuted, realizing: “the tears of its martyrs are the waters ofits Fountain of Youth.”137However, Lydwine is slow to accept the reparative task that is assignedher and, at first, her pain is exacerbated by the spectacle of others’ hap-piness. Only with the intercession of Jean Pot, Lydwine’s parish vicar, isshe able to perform the mission she is delegated. Jean Pot is the first toexplain that the martyrs whom Christ has chosen are “counterparts ofthe Son,” who, in continuing the Passion, afford him “the possibility tocontinue suffering for us.”138Jean Pot confides to Lydwine that the self who dies with Christ isthe perpetrator of original sin, the old Adam, the fallen being who issubsequently resurrected in righteousness and purity. Humanity, as heelaborates, is governed by two laws: “the law of solidarity in Evil andreversibility in God, solidarity in Adam, reversibility in Our Lord.”139As Huysmans would later learn through the evolution of his faith,the greatest sacrifice is also an act of violence against the self, thekilling of the corrupted being identified asle vieil homme. Through writ-ingLydwine, Huysmans learns that the martyrdom endured by womenextends to all those who accept self-mortification in the name of aholy cause. The old Adam – the prideful stylist – consents to beingsacrificed in order to be reborn as an artist glorifying God and nothimself.Crucified with ChristDan Merkur, in a study of medieval mysticism, argues that, in the middleof the fourteenth century, contemporaneous with the life of Lydwine,religious seekers were told to meditate on the experience of the Passion –not from the viewpoint of a witness, but from the perspective of Christhimself. Beginning with Bernard de Clairvaux (1090–1153) and con-tinuing in Henry Suso, this practice was meant to guide the visionarythrough a shared experience of Christ’s agony and end with a rebirth"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"156Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Franceto serenity and wisdom. What Jean Pot describes to Lydwine as MysticSubstitution – the voluntary expiation of the evil done by others – alsosuggests the martyr’s substitution for Jesus on the Cross.Quoting from the thirteenth-century Cistercian abbot Stephen ofSawley, Merkur shows how, in prayer, the subject was to undergo theCrucifixion personally: “See how dearly [Christ] purchased your love,how willingly he gave himself for you; there the weakness of the hang-ing [...] will be yours, the pallor of shaking limbs yours, the shedding ofblood yours, and the last breath of the crucified yours.”140Instead of consciously guided imagery or hypnagogic reverie,Lydwine’s experience of the Crucifixion is physically enacted. Throughher endurance of the myriad ills with which she is afflicted, through thesense of spiritual dereliction that repeats the Dark Night of the Soul, hermartyrdom is not an act of surrogacy but an experience of completion.As Jean Pot advises her: “Say to Jesus: I want to place myself on yourCross. I want you to hammer in the nails. He will accept this role asexecutioner, and his angels will assist him.”141As Lydwine plays the part of victim and Christ the executioner, thereversal allows the process of expiation to be finished. Christ assumesthe role of Father who permits the suffering of his Son, while Lydwine isthe child whose innocence is the holocaustic offering. With the attain-ment of self-forgiveness come the death of the old Adam and the rebirthof a self freed of resentment, guilt, and terror. Whereas, inL’Oblat, Suffer-ing is the Fiancée who tests the nails and mounts the Cross, inLydwine,it is Christ who brings the thorns and rope and gall, and who, in thefinal moment takes down the body of the Saint, lays it on his knees, sothat Mary can embrace her, “happily, like a big sister.”142The regimen Jean Pot prescribes for Lydwine’s meditative exercisesexactly matches the contemplative practices endorsed by Saint Francisand Saint Bonaventure. At the end of both, there occurs a mystic deathof theold man, who is resurrected as a new being, transformed andjoined with Jesus.Accompanying phenomena: incineration in the furnace of the divine,the manifestation of Christ’s sweetness as perfume emanating from rot-ting tissue, appear in Huysmans’s text and in the writings of medievalsaints. The punishing flames of hell, the cleansing fires of Purga-tory become the ecstatic conflagration of a self reborn, phoenix-like,in Christ. In order to find salvation, as Saint Bonaventure writes inItinerarium Mentis ad Deum, “ask desire not understanding, [..] darknessnot clarity, not light but the fire that totally inflames and carries us intoGod by ecstatic unctions and burning affections. This fire is God, andhis"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"The Mystic157furnace is in Jerusalem; and Christ enkindles it in the heat of his burningpassion which only he truly perceives who says:My soul chooses hangingand my bones death.”143The homology of suffering and rapture as transfigurativePassionisexpressed in the mystical language that Huysmans attributes here toLydwine. Thus, she imagines being possessed by Christ, liquefied “inthe forge of Love,” entering into a state of fusion, and being poured “inthe nuptial form of his Cross.”144This death and resurrection sequenceis the transmutation of the body’s substance, vaporization of gangrenedflesh into a scent of flowers that is everywhere. Thus, the Bride can say ofChrist: “A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me; he will linger betweenmy breasts.”145Jean Pot’s admonishment to Lydwine about her ordeal and itspromised outcome illuminates the Saint: “The scales fell from Lydwine’seyes.”146But completion of the phase of purgative suffering and illumi-native prayer is still far from completion in the perfective experience ofbeatitude.Loss and recoveryJean Pot compares Lydwine’s experience of temporality to Christ’spanoramic apprehension of mankind’s past and future vices. As a pro-pitiatory victim, Lydwine is a prisoner of others’ history, the deposit oftheir guilt and the precipitate of their sin. But as Jean Pot reminds her,Lydwine is no different from her predecessors, other martyrs boiled inoil, cooked on grills, broken on wheels, sawed in half, or shredded topieces with iron combs. Whereas Lydwine and her sisters see only theevils of the past – “idolatry, incest, sacrilege, and murder” – horribleiniquities filing by across the centuries, Christ, who is endowed withthe prescience of a divinity, sees the future as the endless procession ofmankind’s trespasses – the coming men who continue to steal and cru-cify their Savior, “in order to satisfy their lust and passion for lucre.”147Omniscience confers on Christ the capacity for prospection, making thefuture ineluctable, adding it to the deficit of history, causing him to needthe help of handmaidens willing to climb the Cross themselves.Yet Pot advises Lydwine that physical suffering is always compensatedand that the torments of the body are redeemed by spiritual delights.Suffering for others, she disintegrates into pieces, her body broken upand shared among the lost souls that she helps, becoming like theEucharist distributed among communicants.Lydwine’s lesson in asceticism begins with an alienation from herbody, no longer the cutaneous container of her organs and identity."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"158Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FranceLesions, abscesses, open wounds, and oozing sores: Lydwine becomesthe spectacle of her physical porosity. After undergoing the loss of bod-ily integrity, she experiences what Huysmans calls “the abandonmentof things.”148Not an elimination of her capacity to derive enjoymentfrom reality, this disconnection is experienced as the inhospitality of anenvironment no longer domesticated by familiarity, no longer pacifiedby anthropomorphism. It is what Camus refers to as “the primitive hos-tility of the world”149– estrangement from the things that formerly gavepleasure: crackling embers in the fireplace, the sight of scudding cloudsoutside the window – “these miserable, little nothings that occupy aninvalid were denied her.”150Interpersonal attachments, the love of family members are construedas excluding God, whom Lydwine had betrayed. So when Lydwinemourns the death of her beloved niece, Petronille, Christ is jealous andabandons her to her lonely martyrdom. Like Jesus, who himself hadfelt forsaken on the Cross, Lydwine lives the Crucifixion as a banish-ment to solitude, as hopelessness, desiccation, a crushing nihilism ofthe soul.Lydwine’s journey ends with her participation in the Crucifixion ofthe Savior, but before that, she experiences an environmental death, adecathexis of treasured objects, the emotional inhumation of longtimefriends, the stilling of her heart and of the voices of the world. But asshe loses her capacity to receive nourishment and love, she grows inher ability to give nourishment to others. By vacating herself, she learnsthe joy of multiplicity, living through the sinners whose penance shealleviates.Once Lydwine is able to eat nothing but the Eucharist, she liveson nourishment as holiness, “for eating well means eating goodness.It mean eating God,” as Marc Smeets writes.151As selfishness is thesin that turns the subject away from God – a refusal of alterity, anautophagia of affect – Lydwine undergoes the Passion in order to bereborn ascompassion, her body a salvatory image of Europe’s ravagedbody. Like nineteenth-century France, corrupted by Republicans andDreyfusards, the deterioration of the Holland of Lydwine augured a jubi-lant rebirth. After Lydwine’s mystic death and reunion with the Savior,she is freed from time as the ensnaring residue of humanity’s collec-tive guilt. Accompanied by her guardian angel, she experiences the giftof bilocation, an ability to move about in time and visit more thanone place simultaneously. Yet this migratory freedom only adumbratesthe blessings still to come, when her physical death delivers her intoubiquity and eternity."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"The Mystic159In her out-of-body flights to Paradise, Lydwine sees heaven, accord-ing to her history and temperament, as relief from a life of scarcityand hunger: “as a vision of a magnificently vaulted banquet hall, wheremeats were served on silverware placed on tablecloths of green silk andwine was poured in cups of crystal and gold.”152Through her sharingin the Passion, she comes to see divine rewards as banquets served onlinen or as wine in crystal goblets. Reborn in Christ, she undergoes atransubstantiative operation and is dispersed as sacramental food intothe people whom she succors. First as the smell of clove and cinna-mon, then as violets and lilies, “symbols of humility and chastity,”153Lydwine evaporates in death into a scent that is unrecognizable, “anunanalyzable scent, so restorative and fortifying” that the people gath-ered around her “needed neither sleep nor nutriment for two days andthree nights.”154RebirthinothersAs with her martyred sisters, Lydwine’s purpose is to redeem otherswith her agonies. But after death, she is transformed, both as essenceand as species, into the food of life assimilated by the sinners whoseguilt she expiates. Eaten and inhaled, as nourishment and perfume,she enters into others, is pluralized and dissipated, joining with thefortunate for whom she is annihilated as herself. Indeed, Huysmansimagines a similar fate awaiting the male author, transposed as thetext that is distributed to the public. Publication of his work becomesa Eucharistic feast whereby a writer dies yet lives again in the readerswho consume him.When the debt of guilt is settled, history ceases to imprison. Havingbound man to the objects that he mistakenly had coveted, enslavingtime makes way for mobility and freedom, and for Lydwine, everlastinglife brings dissemination into those she saves. Purgatory as thetoposof aconfining temporality is thrown open so that tortured souls escape intoa heaven that is everywhere.Unpardoned, Lydwine was at first the child who is chastened bythe Father, but having died with Christ, she moves beyond the Pas-sion to compassion, her suffering universalized as identification withthe world. When he is no longer a merciless executioner, an intro-jected God is not experienced as guilt incurring self-arraignment andself-punishment. Once she is crucified with Christ, the martyred mys-tic feels no more rage; she ceases “to have unconscious cause to fearretaliation.” As Merkur adds, “self-forgiveness constitute[s] permission"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"160Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Franceto experience the euphoric ecstasy of a clear conscience,” and with therecovery of innocence, “resurrection follow[s].”155Since only the Father can act as judge, inexorable and retributive, onlythe child can deserve his disapproval and his sanction. Thus, Lydwine’sabsolution entails an alteration in her status, so when she is broughtdown from the Cross, Mary embraces her “like a sister.”In a strikingly rich theophany, Christ manifests himself to Lydwine,both as the infant and as the adult Son with bleeding nail holes in hishands. In another vision, Lydwine takes her place in “in a cloud of vir-gins dressed in white,”156spotless women assisting in the nativity ofthe Newborn. Rewarded for having joined Christ and for assisting in hisdeath throes, she is rewarded by helping Mary in the celebration of hisbirth. Seraphs, as Huysmans writes, pick pearls of sound from harps offire. Others weave swaddling clothes from the blue smoke of burningincense.Again apologizing for the descriptive inadequacy of his writing,Huysmans pictures Lydwine reciting the liturgical phrases she learned inchildhood, performing “the ceremonial practices she was familiar withhere below.”157Constrained by the rote doxological formulations shehad memorized, Lydwine underscores the inexpressible magnificenceof her vision with the simple language of God’s praise, the poverty ofHuysmans’s prose.However, the beauty of the scene lies in the resurrection of Lydwine’sinnocence and the nativity of a self who is both a child and the child’smother. The people saved by Christ and his handmaidens are strewn asmyriads of lights across the galaxy, as “an immense trajectory of milkillumined from behind by a thousand stars.”158The miraculous lacta-tion that Lydwine experiences marks her transformation from guiltychild to providential mother, as the elixir of life changes from mar-tyr’s blood to mother’s milk. As Jerôme Solal remarks, this substitutionof liquid elements denotes the passage from self to others, from sin-gularity to multiplicity, from Lydwine’s confinement in her bed andbody to her dilation into those consuming her: “milk, that wonderfullysensual substance that expressesbeing with, a mother’s gift that bringssatiety.”159Having died with Christ and lain beside Christ’s corpse on Mary’sknees, she participates with the Madonna in the experience ofChristmas. What Vintras had said of Mary is also true of Lydwine: “Shespoke little, and yet how powerfully she drew Brides to the Bridegroom’ssacred sanctuary. The odor of her sanctity transported men and ravishedangels. She was the incense that cherubs bore to the feet of the Eternal"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"The Mystic161Master’s throne. She died of love, but she fought death with the powerof her love.”160After her death and rebirth in Paradise, Lydwine’s good offices con-tinue – in the posthumous performance of the statutory three miracles:an invalid child from Delft, bedridden for eight years, who invokes theSaint and finds that, all at once, she has been healed; a crippled nunfrom Gouda to whom Lydwine manifests herself and who enlists theother monachals to recite five Our Fathers and Five Hail Mary’s andthen sees that her leg is straight and that she is able to walk again;another nun from Leyden who, having prayed by Lydwine’s tomb, findsa cancerous tumor on her neck had disappeared while she was sleeping.From Eve to MaryHuysmans’s hagiography may draw on the archival sources he identifies,but his picture of the Blessed Lydwine is a product of the fin-de-siècleimagination. From Vintras, Huysmans derives his sense of the perpet-ual apocalypse, his gender classification of men as prophets, priests,and artists, and of women as the fortunate who can see God face toface. Huysmans propagates the fin-de-siècle ideal of holy dispossession,material scarcity compensated by the abundance of the soul’s joys. InLydwine, suffering frees a self encased in comfortable indifference, scat-tering it in the multitudes saved by her sacrificial fervor. The era of theParaclete, which Vintras had predicted, brings a deliverance from his-tory, the Second Age of the Suffering Son, and an accession to eternityas a renaissance of innocence.Furthermore, inLydwine, Huysmans sketches the new role of thewriter, one in which he is no longer marginalized by being unfit as amartyr, no longer disqualified by his intellect and language. Like Vintrasand Boullan, professing to be descended from the prophets, Huysmansreaffirms the importance of the vaticinator and his message. Sufferingbecause his gender leaves him ill-equipped to suffer, he still announcesthe apocalypse prepared by the torments of Eve’s daughters.Huysmans’s text continues after Vintras’s Cult of Mary and his ritualof ascensional redemption, where Eve was rehabilitated by repeating thesin that earned her punishment. The teleological purpose of the banish-ment from Eden comes with the death of the old Adam and the birthof the Messiah. The woman who is driven out for eating from the Treeof Forbidden Fruit becomes Eucharistic nourishment that gives satisfac-tion without end. Once her punishment is welcomed and her sufferingembraced, Huysmans shows an Eve re-virginized and sanctified by the"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"162Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francededication of her penance. To the woman, God had said: “I will greatlymultiply your pain in childbearing” (Genesis3.8), but in her willingnessto die with Christ for the children she brings forth, woman is madeimmaculate, her integrity restored by pain. Dolorism, in consecratingthe agony of childbearing, shows its culmination in the joy of engen-dering new life: souls liberated from a Purgatory of self-incrimination,a self that is reborn in munificence and charity. Ceasing to be thetemptress, Eve finds the purpose of her suffering when, in redeemingher unforgiven child, she fulfills her destiny as God’s mother.Léon Bloy:La Femme Pauvre(The WomanWho was Poor1897)While Léon Bloy may have been only indirectly influenced by the mil-lenarian doctrine of Eugène Vintras, it was from the Prophet of Tilly thatBloy derived his impatient hope in the world’s end. Bloy shared Vintras’soutrage at the institution of Catholicism, which he denounced as venal,spiritually tepid, guided solely by material concerns. It was Vintras’spraise of the suffering poor that Bloy carried to fanatical extremes,Vintras’s belief in the sanctity of women as martyrs that directed Bloy inthe creation of his fictional heroines. Richard D. E. Burton maintainsthat Bloy’s visionary mistress, Anne-Marie Roulé, had been conver-sant with the principal tenets of Vintrasianism, sharing them with thewriter, convincing him that the age of the Crucified Son was nearingits conclusion and that it would soon be followed by a glorious sunriseaccompanying the Reign of the Holy Spirit.It was from Bloy’s relationship with Anne-Marie, and later with BertheDumont that he drew his portrait of the Dolorist saint, not a womanliving in a romanticized medieval setting, but one struggling to survivein contemporary Paris, where her torments and ecstasies inspired artistsmodeled on Bloy himself.Born in Périgueux in 1846, Bloy was first exposed by his devoutmother, Anne-Marie Carreau, to the strain of Christian mysticism thatwould seethe in his later writing. After relocating to Paris in 1863, Bloymet and came under the influence of Barbey d’Aurevilley, whose reac-tionary Catholicism further propelled Bloy to abjure his earlier atheismand declare his conversion to the church in 1870.Like Huysmans, whom over time he identified as his nemesis andenemy, Bloy based his faith on a view of male artists as evangelist/transcribers who recorded the rapturous visions of inarticulate femalesaints. However, Bloy’s central contribution to the martyrology of the"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"The Mystic163fin de siècle – his refinement of the mystic thought that was becomingprevalent in the era – came from showing how Dolorist self-abnegationcould be practiced in the modern world. Bloy takes the oceanic, oftenbarely intelligible prophetic admonitions of Vintras and applies them,not as Huysmans does, to a distant historical figure from medievalHolland, but to a few desperate, yet fervently confident religious seekersliving in the heart of nineteenth-century Paris.In Huysmans’s biography of Lydwine, the saint’s visions of Paradiseand Purgatory had been conditioned, the author argues, by the iconog-raphy of her era. When Lydwine had flown with her guardian angelto different areas of the afterlife, what she had seen had been divinelyadapted to her cultural conditions. Since Huysmans’s experience of helland heaven came through identification with his subject, Lydwine’smystical raptures – and Huysmans’s appreciation of them – were prod-ucts of a particular historical consciousness. On the other hand, inBloy’s fiction, the experience of ecstatic transcendence is shown as beingaccessible to characters resembling his own contemporaries.While Bloy shared Huysmans’s disaffection for the commercial vul-garity of modern society, his relationships with Anne-Marie Roulé andBerthe Dumont had afforded him a glimpse into the lives of martyrsliving in the muddy streets and squalid neighborhoods of nineteenth-century Paris. It is as anépisode contemporain(a contemporary episode)that Bloy’s heroine takes part in the Passion of Christ, undergoing anannihilation of self in the divine. It is there that she experiences deathas an emancipation from material comforts and from the people sheloves. The sacred poverty that Vintras had extolled is embraced andlived by Bloy’s heroines, whose sainthood disengages them from historyand who approach beatification in the era they live in. When ClotildeChapuis inLa Femme pauvreis unburdened of possessions, freed fromthe love of her husband and son, she stands on the threshold of apersonal apocalypse translating her from exile into eternity.When Bloy first met Berthe Dumont, beggar-woman and morphine-addict, in the streets of Paris in January 1884, offering shelter to thevagrant and her mother in his home on the Pavillon d’Asnières, heseemed to be re-enacting the same ambiguously predatory and char-itable impulse that had caused him to give sanctuary to prostituteAnne-Marie Roulé seven years before. With each woman, Bloy witnessedthe initial conflagration of his mistress’s faith, then stood helplessly bywhile both women were swept into a gyre of madness or disease. Whilethe martyrdom of Anne-Marie had begun with her prophetic illumi-nations and then had degenerated into the insanity that caused her"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"164Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Franceinternment in the asylum of Saint-Anne in 1882, Berthe had contractedtetanus suddenly in 1885, driving her penurious benefactor out into thestreets, in a fruitless search for money and assistance.Yet Bloy’s participation in the sacred mystery of the Passion of thesemartyred saints only exacerbated his alienation from a world he alreadyregarded as indifferent to suffering and devoid of spirituality, As wasthe case with Huysmans, Bloy’s faith, in its evolution, was inextrica-bly interwoven with his disgust at the deplorable state of French artand letters at the century’s end. Porte-parole for the author, Bloy’s maleprotagonist is a Catholic writer incensed at the pleasure-loving, pain-avoiding mediocrity of his co-religionists, enraged by the vapidity ofhis more successful fellow-artists. Bloy’s unenviable reputation amongcritics who bemoan his “singularly uncharitable Christian polemic,”161emanates from his vindictive lamentations over the plight of fin-de-siècle literature and faith. Digressive tirades against bumptious editorsand talentless scribblers, turgid invective against flaccid clerics and avari-cious Jews form a picture of nineteenth-century society as Purgatory, inwhich the intervention of a saint becomes a matter of ever more pressingurgency.The eagerness with which Bloy awaited the end of time arises from hissense of estrangement from a world shown as hostile and hellish. Yet tohis credit, Bloy uses his fiction as more than a forum for self-pityingvengeance. Bloy’s feelings of literal and spiritual dereliction in a societyruled by Philistines led to an apprehension of the function of mysticalsuffering as a way to hasten the apocalypse. Taken from his harrowingexperiences with Anne-Marie and Berthe, Bloy creates his image of amartyred heroine haloed against a dark backdrop of poisonous literarybanquets, sordid urban slums, bitter exclusion, heartlessness, and deso-lation, showing how she burns with a despair that is finally purified intoecstasy.The apparition at La SaletteIn flight from the faith-shriveling inhospitality of the capital, bothHuysmans and Bloy had found a springboard for their faith at the pil-grimage site of La Salette. A barren and remote mountain village nearGrenoble, La Salette was prized by both Huysmans and Bloy for “itsphysical inaccessibility – proof of La Salette’s superiority over its ‘demo-cratic’ counterpart Lourdes.”162The importance of La Salette in Bloy’spersonal theology, its privileged place in the spiritual geography offin-de-siècle Catholics, Bloy’s association of the Weeping Virgin who"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"The Mystic165appeared on the mountain with the Dolorist martyrs illumining hisfiction explain the significance of the location in turn-of-the-centuryFrench mysticism.In his 1908 commentary on the Apparition,Celle qui pleure(The OneWho Weeps), Bloy recounts the miracle of La Salette and explains itseschatological implications. In 1846, a generation before the flourish-ing of the fin-de-siècle Catholic revival, the Virgin Mary is said to haveappeared to two cowherds – Mélanie Calvat and Maximin Giraud –in a pasture on Mont Planeau overlooking La Salette. Scintillating ina golden gown woven with flame, wreathed in flowers of unearthlybeauty, she had uncovered her face, Bloy writes, only to reveal it“streaming with tears.”163Inviting the children to approach her, she hadinstructed them to warn of disasters to come: famine, war, crop failure,the decline of a moribund church, all presaging the coming of the Anti-Christ, who would usher in a time of upheaval and tribulation climaxedby a fiery apocalypse.Bolstering convictions that the end time was nearing, the secretsconfided to Mélanie and Maximin had left a profound impression onHuysmans, who underwent his own conversion on a pilgrimage to LaSalette. Even greater was the influence on Bloy, who devoted muchof his writing to chronicling the life of Mélanie, producing meticu-lous exegetical commentary on the address from Mary, and examiningthe relationship between nineteenth-century Catholics and Our Lady ofSorrows, whom Bloy would refer to asThe One Who Weeps.As for the secret – having cast the clergy in an unflattering light –Mélanie’s admonition first met with incredulity and suspicion. But afteran 1847 investigation and extensive questioning of the guileless youngwitnesses, an official report authenticating the miracle was submittedto Pope Pius IX, and its conclusion was ratified by the Holy See inAugust 1848.Notwithstanding church verification of Mary’s message, neither sacer-dotal reform nor a collective recommitment to the principles of sacrificeand austerity ensued. In Bloy’s opinion, the Virgin, who had told ofrestraining God’s wrath, would soon no longer be able to continue pro-tecting her children. “If my people will not submit,” she cautioned,“I will be forced to let my Son’s arm go. It is so heavy that soon I willnot be able to restrain it any longer.”164Much of Bloy’s writing seems fueled by anticipation that the extinc-tion of zeal among his Catholic brethren would ignite God’s anger andtrigger universal destruction. Part of Bloy wanted Mary’s compassionto fail so that Christ’s punishing arm would come down on humanity."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"166Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FranceOn the other hand, the Messianic promise, unfulfilled for almost 2,000years, struck Bloy as a violation of the covenant made with those whosuffered with Christ. An abrogated pledge, the postponed apocalypseconstituted an embarrassment to a God who had abdicated his role.For Bloy, as Albert Béguin writes: “History has not yet become thehistory of the definitive Kingdom. From century to century, it has pur-sued its frightful course, requiring all the attention of a prayerful spirit,all the difficult humility of a humble heart to accept the scandal ofthese infinite delays. It is not easy to forgive God for abandoning hischildren, more cruelly orphaned since God’s Son died for them, moreunable to understand why Satan has so much power over their obscuredestiny.”165Embittered and impatient with the Messiah who did not come,Bloy expressed his frustrated apocalypticism as a sense of exile onthe earth, as a feeling of dereliction in a world where holiness andself-denial were despised. Bloy himself had visited La Salette in 1879,accompanied by his spiritual mentor, Abbé Tardif de Moidrey, whohad echoed the Virgin’s condemnation of a clergy guilty of pander-ing to the wealthy, worldly priests stigmatized by Mary as “cesspoolsof impurity.” According to Bloy, the nineteenth-century priesthood,defiled after authorizing a religion of luxury and self-indulgence, hadcome to regard its mission as amassing money “by all means compat-ible or incompatible with the dignity of their cassock.”166For them,the wretched who re-enacted Christ’s Passion were dismissed as meredisturbances of the rich man’s peace of mind. Occasionally benefit-ting from others’ eleemosynary impulses, the poor were advised toremain concealed in the dark corners of sanctuaries. No less gravethan the moderation of Catholic faith was the profanation of theSabbath, a tendency to treat the day as an occasion for money-makingcommerce.However, Tardif, who had died during the pilgrimage to La Salette,had been most influential in shaping Bloy’s metaphysic, imbuing himwith a belief in the secret meaning of Creation. Practitioner of a compre-hensive system of Scriptural interpretation, Tardif had convinced Bloyof the Bible’s occult symbolism. Arguing that every Biblical passage was“to be taken as referring to the Holy Trinity,”167Tardif had bequeathedto his disciple a “mystical approach to history.”168From Tardif, Bloy hadconcluded that all events were eschatological portents requiring urgentdeciphering, the world a “cryptogram” to which a universal algebracould be applied. For the enlightened exegete, “the wordChancewasan intolerable blasphemy.”169"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"The Mystic167The author in exileBloy’s conception of the universe as an unriddled system of explanatorysymbols underpins the design of his own fictional world, structured byclassifications of martyrs and evildoers, artists of the profane and artistof the sublime. Similarly – as in his contemporaries’ works – Bloy’s char-acters are grouped by a typology of gender, in which men are artistsproducing images whose purpose is to illumine the human condition asexile, and women, who, because they are unseparated from the divinityby language, experience the transfigurative pain that returns them frombanishment to Paradise. In Bloy’s most famous novel,La Femme pauvre(1897), a woman’s mystical experience is not situated in the remotenessof medieval history, but in being written as an episode in the life of a fin-de-siècleParisienne, presents the issue of religious ecstasy as one havingimmediacy and relevance.Yet it was only later in his career that Bloy concentrated on women’sspiritual prerogatives, as his inaugural novel,Le Désespéré(The Hope-less1886), charts the religious itinerary of his hero, Caïn Marchenoir.Bloy’s alter ego, Marchenoir is another Catholic fanatic, the mouthpiecethrough which the author airs his unorthodox beliefs, vents his profes-sional grudges, and expresses his apocalyptic longings. Consigned to thenovel’s background, Marchenoir’s mistress, Véronique, is anilluminéeand martyr, but her status as a visionary is compromised by her declineinto despair and paranoia.Rather than focusing on woman, Bloy begins by describing hishero’s invocation of the hieratic privilege of the vaticinator/poet, whosenominative authority confers supremacy over all beings. In Eden, asMarchenoir explains in a gloss of Tardif’s cosmology, God bestowed onman the authority to name all other creatures. A secondary power orcoefficient of theLogos, the transitive act of naming conferred masteryof the world. To name as object, for Marchenoir, may not be the same asto create it, but by infusing it with meaning and identifying its relation-ship to man, Adam took possession of the things he subjugated throughunderstanding. Like man, who as the catechism teaches, was fashionedin God’s likeness, animals were made by Adam, “created in the imageof his reason.”170As Marchenoir elaborates: “When our first ancestornamed the animals, he made them his. He not only subjugated them asan emperor would. His essence penetrated them. He fixed them, joinedthem to himself forever, mixing them into his destiny.”171Yet as an emperor is irremediably cut off from his subjects, whosesubservience, otherness, and suffering are unfathomable, so man is"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"168Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francealienated from the creatures over which he has dominion. Names are ananthropocentric optic that muddies and distorts: “we perceive beingsonly in relation to other beings, never at their heart, never in theiressence,” as Marchenoir summarizes.172Despite his grandiloquence and obscurantism, Marchenoir – as a God-inspired poet – is still disjoined from the world that is illuminatedby his genius. Self-exaltingly described by Bloy as a modern judge ofIsrael, an evangelical ravisher whom the celestial legions cannot resist,Marchenoir still does not know the sufferings of the tigers he watchesin a cage. His language is a darkening glass through which imperfectknowledge passes. The name that man attaches is the garment coveringan object, a veil at once concealing and beautifying the body of the real.When Marchenoir speaks, his words measure their distance from theirreferents, compelling him to re-enact the experience of the Fall. Consis-tent with Vintrasianism, Bloy equates woman with Truth, “Sophia,orWisdom (a divine principle which had fallen from the realm of lightinto the realm of matter).”173Denied access to the Truth except throughAnalogic poetry, men are “sleepers” condemned to operate in a shadow-land of images, approximations of what will be revealed “when allthings hidden are revealed,”174whenthe perfect comes, enabling us tosee things “face to face” (CorinthiansI. 13.2).In Bloy’s principal works of fiction, he marks his writing’s evolutionfrom author-centered stories to mystical attempts at capturing woman’sapprehension of the divine. In his meditations on Mélanie and themiraculous apparition at La Salette, he had refined his appreciation ofthe Virgin Mary as the new Eve, so that, inLa Femme pauvre,heachievesa final synthesis of the mystic’s thematic interests in suffering womanand salvation. Through Bloy’s vicarious participation in the tribulationsof his anguished mistresses – first Anne-Marie Roulé and later BertheDumont – he was able to move from a fiction of vituperative retribu-tion to a visionary literature of spiritual transcendence. In personalizingVintras’s teachings on poverty and suffering, Bloy identifies with hisfemale characters and then accompanies them on their journey, whichhe believes will end with a liberation from a fallen world of material-ism and irreligion. From his sainted heroines, Bloy finds the way fromPurgatory back to Eden. In following Tardif’s global system of symboliccorrelations, Bloy learns that woman is both Eve, the earthly Eden,and Mary, the celestial Paradise: “the Immaculate Conception, [...]thesublime Garden found again.”175InLa Femme Pauvre, Caïn Marchenoir describes arriving in La Salette,already broken and cast down after the recent death of his infant son."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"The Mystic169Bloy’s angry protagonists often rage against an unresponsive God whosejustice they see as doubtful and obscure. In an era of insolently tri-umphant materialism and faltering devotion, Bloy’s characters are notfar from embracing the devil of miscreants and pariahs portrayed byJules Bois: “the Satan of the disinherited and the poor, ruler of the sor-cerer, the bandit, the irredeemable traitor, the miserable outlaw, andthe rebel.”176Nor are they unlike Huysmans’s Canon Docre who, whileofficiating at a Black Mass in fin-de-siècle Paris, inveighs against Christas the Champion of the Rich, “Beloved Vassal of the Banks,” “God ofbusiness.”177In an era rotten with hedonism and sacrilege, Bloy’s faithis sustained only by the sanctification of suffering.For Bloy, a woman’s participation in the Passion is marked by thesupersession of Mary’s tears for Christ’s blood. When, in a provocativecomment, Bloy writes that “the Blood of the Poor is money,”178he bothincriminates the wealthy whose comforts are ransomed by the wretched,and sacramentalizes the poor man’s blood as a viaticum that redeems.The prototype of Marchenoir is a pilgrim he meets at La Salette, aman unable to forgive himself for killing another in a duel. He teachesMarchenoir about the holiness and innocence of animals, recommend-ing the unawareness that likens them to man before the Fall. Wishingto emulate Saint Francis in cultivating a fraternal bond with all livingthings, he had sought to learn the forgotten language of animals andstones. Like Marchenoir, he regards Creation as a universal hieroglyph,beginning with the Lamb and Calf as symbols of the Son, then con-tinuing with other elements in a theriographic mystery. These animalsare “the alphabetical signs of Ecstasy,” he says, keys to the “everlastinghistory of the Trinity.”179From his encounter with a grief-disabled sojourner in La Salette,Marchenoir had evolved his own idea of a universal hermeneutic,whereby the misery of man’s condition during his passage on the earthcould be deciphered “in the Kabbalah of dates,” “in the most deeplyhidden Arcanum of facts.”180However, for Bloy and for Marchenoir, the Book of Explanations hadremained unwritten. Fueled by Mélanie’s predictions, expectations ofthe apocalypse seemed to be borne out by world events: the Franco-Prussian War, then the ascendancy ofla Culture allemande(German Cul-ture) in 1913, which, according to Bloy, prefigured “the final extinctionof people’s souls.”181Like Bloy, Marchenoir devoted his talents as a writer to truculentdenunciations of the affluent bourgeoisie, lamentations of their indul-gence in selfish otiosity. An unattractive trait shared by author and"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"170Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Franceprotagonist is their use of literature as a forum for settling scores andscourging enemies, complaining about the unenthusiastic reception oftheir books. However, in moving beyond his feelings of personal per-secution, extensively documented in the volumes of his journal, Bloystands out among the other fin-de-siècle mystic writers by describinghow the practice of Dolorism might afford an actual deliverance from afallen world.As is indicated by the title of Bloy’s first autobiographical novel,man’s lot is to narrate his earthly destiny asun désespéré. A concomi-tant of Bloy’s magnification of the victim and the martyr is his attackon those identified as oppressors and executioners. Bloy’s fictionalwritings are used as campaigns of revenge,livres à clefreplete witharraignments of his confrères, whose success he deplores as “the Divineright of absolute Mediocrity.”182Paul Bourget, Guy de Maupassant,Jean Richepin, Alphonse Daudet are among those splashed withMarchenoir’s stercoraceous vituperation. J.-K. Huysmans, whose viewson suffering were similar to Bloy’s, is the target of especially corrosiveexecration.While Bloy’s analyses of the mystical ecstasies of women are pleasingin their simplicity, his social criticism is swollen with obscure phrases,clouded with neologisms. Unusual rhetorical effects, threatening anni-hilation or conveying sarcasm, make his texts a place of exile for hisreaders as was the world for his characters. Cataplexis promises escha-tological doom for fools and Philistines. Deinosis invites audience scornfor writers who prostitute their talent. Cacemphaton heaps the mud ofscurrilous ridicule on those who mock Christ with theirbégeulisme cafard(hypocritical prudery) and emasculate religion with false piety. Cov-ering his contemporaries with “scatological reprobation,” Marchenoir“saw the modern world, with its institutions and ideas, foundering inan ocean of mud. It was an Atlantis submerged in a sump.”183Inspiring antipathy and dread with his scathing diatribes, Marchenoir,at one point, is invited to a literary banquet hosted by impresario andeditor Abraham-Properce Beauvivier (Catulle Mendès). But after listen-ing to hours of persiflage and self-anointment – “prehistoric witticismsand tertiary puns”184– Marchenoir erupts in insults he hurls at the otherguests. Having ensured his place is lost in the community of writers, heis relegated to the loneliness of his apartment in the city and dies therewithout receiving the consolation of the last rites.InLe Désespéré, Bloy writes hisPurgatorio, a penitential narrativetelling of children who die, lovers who are lost, friends who, whensummoned, arrive too late. In a novel without solace, Bloy’s world is"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"The Mystic171a small, self-centered place, where sorrow comes from being unappreci-ated and unread. Bloy’s hero, like the Jews that Bloy tirelessly castigates,is misunderstood, itinerant, homeless, and despised.After the death of his father in the novel’s first section, Marchenoirmakes a winter retreat at La Grande Chartreuse. There, under a frigidcanopy, in a landscape of snowy desolation, he meditates on seclusionand sainthood, reflecting on what Huysmans calls man’s solidarity inAdam and reversibility in Christ, “that transcendent law of supernaturalbalance condemning the innocent to pay the ransom of the guilty.”185Coveting the ascetic simplicity of conventual reclusion, he inquiresabout the possibility of joining the order. But one of the Carthusians,recognizing in Marchenoir a man of language as engagement, persuadeshim that he is unfit to take a vow of silence. Like Marchenoir, Bloy hadhimself considered the possibility of a monastic vocation and, in 1877,had spent a ten-day retreat at La Grande Trappe at Soligny. However, likehis character, Bloy discovered he was unsuited for monastic life, and so,estranged from society, both the author and his hero reassume their des-olate status as vagrants on the earth. As a writer contemptuous of thepublic whose attention he solicits, a believer infuriated with the Godwhose deliverance does not come, Marchenoir, like Bloy, is a strangerin society, a trespasser in God’s kingdom and so inhabits an interme-diate zone between higher and lower realms. Despite the stridence ofhis misanthropy, he treasures the loyalty of friends, the devotion of hismistress, and sees suffering, not as a crucible where sinners are puri-fied by fire, but as a sacrificial duty that connects him to his brothers.A generous impulse expressed in action is an anonymous text that bindsits author to an audience raised up by an unseen benefactor: “All ofChristian philosophy lies in the importance of acts of free will andin the notion of all-enveloping and indestructible solidarity with one’sbrother.”186Already inLe Désespéré, Bloy’s protagonist intuits that the writer’stask is not to fill 400 pages with jeremiads, but to mute his voice inorder to amplify the eloquence of God. On the level of writing, theego death fusing the worshipper with Christ requires a deletion of themessage, a humbling of the author. As Jean-Claude Polet writes, this dis-cipline “proceeds through negation, with the intention of establishingthe super-eminent qualities of the divinity, saying that God is unknow-able, infinite, and incorruptible.”187Moving from the nullity of self tothe totality of God, Bloy sees a religion of suffering that obliterates theartist, creating emptiness that only the sacred can complete. This is thetrajectory described by Bloy’s novels: from self-pity and resentment,"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"172Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francefrom vengeance and paranoia, to mystic self-effacement that brings apromise of release. Herein lies the paradox of Bloy’s long and bitternovels: the use of language as an instrument of self-invalidation, hisdiscovery of the uselessness of expressions of ire. After the glorifying pic-ture of the genius Caïn Marchenoir – after Bloy’s recourse to literatureto denounce the vapidity of literature – there is a gradual eclipsing ofBloy’s novelistic alter ego. His sole remaining role is celebrating inarticu-late female martyrs, saying what women communicate in mystic ecstasyor tearful silence.Martyrdom and ecstasy: Bloy’s holy womenJust as Véronique Cheminot, the Dolorist sibyl inLe Désespéré,isthefic-tional precursor of Clotilde Chapuis inLa Femme pauvre,themadwomanAnne-Marie Roulé, whom Bloy had met in 1877, is the forerunner ofBerthe Dumont, the morphine-addicted prostitute who is transposed asthe saint in Bloy’s second novel.Bloy’s inferential view of mysticism – observed by men and lived bywomen – can be seen in his affiliation of woman and suffering. Eve,who mourned for centuries for the children she bore in pain, is com-pleted and redeemed by Mary, who weeps forever at La Salette. Thetears of Mary, “which the Flood can only inadequately represent.”188are a spectacle compelling the Redeemer to return. Mary’s sorrow forhumanity, reflected in Christ’s compassion for his mother, suggests thevale of tears whose baptismal water washes away original sin. For Bloy,the Virgin’s weeping is a cause for humanity’s rejoicing, just as suffer-ing is a blessing that ensures the penitent’s absolution: “Rolling downfrom Calvary, Our Lady’s tears fall in cataracts on the living. All aredrowned in them, and the most fortunate among are submerged atincommensurable depths.”189InLe Désespéré, Marchenoir lives with his mistress, Véronique, areformed prostitute with fiery hair whom he had saved from a life ofignominious vagrancy. More than a literary work, the soteriological res-cue of Véronique is a masterpiece of efficient grace which Marchenoiris grateful to have authored: “He was as proud of his Véronique as hewould have been of a beautiful book.”190In her previous life of sexual depradation, Véronique had been giventhe admiring soubriquetla Ventouse(the Sucker). Even in her streetname, Bloy’s heroine is linked to her role as one who dispossesses,assisting in a hygienic regimen that restore her lovers to humility andnothingness."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"The Mystic173Following Marchenoir’s retreat at La Grand Chartreuse, his return toa life of literary vexation begins what John Coombes calls “a discon-nected episodic series:” tirades against the artistic mediocrity of his era,the poverty and hardship he endures with Véronique, “their shared reli-gious fanaticism, leading to her madness and incarceration,” and finallyto his death “and a kind of murky apotheosis.”191Aware that her protector still finds her sexually attractive, Véroniqueundergoes voluntary self-mutilation when she has her teeth pulled outin order to inspire less temptation in her lover.Marchenoir, condemned to die alone in his miserable apartment,unconsoled by Extreme Unction, unattended by his friend, makes acameo appearance in Bloy’s next novel,La Femme pauvre, his celebratedtreatise on a woman’s path to sainthood. Marginalized, male artists andilluminators of sacred manuscripts initiate the heroine into the worldof complex symbols. Bloy, devoting more time to exploring the mysteryof woman as Sophia, ceases to catalog the image-veils with which herworshippers enshroud her. While Jean-Claude Polet describes the char-acters’ passage through an expiatory interlude, seeing in the novel “amap of their destinies across the invisible realities of Purgatory,”192Bloy’sbook, in charting the evolution of Clotilde Chapuis from Eve to Mary,takes as its setting the postlapsarian world of banishment and wander-ing. Instead of in a garden of earthly pleasures, Bloy’s Eve lives in herparent’s foul repair, with its stinking mattresses, dirty walls, and cheapreligious knickknacks. Unsuffused by innocence, it is a place where ayoung girl’s naïve faith offends her stepfather’s nostrils: “It stinks of thegood Lord in here,” he exclaims.193Paralleling the Genesis account of shamed expatriation, the novelstarts with Clotilde’s assignment to pose naked as an artist’s model.Nudity as self-awareness, punishing the Fall into duality, expels womanfrom childhood into the mortification of maturity. Since Bloy hadfollowed Tardif in equating a symbol and its meaning, he saw Eve,not just as the occupant, but as the personification of the Garden.Rosemary Rodwell describes Bloy’s adoption of the sensuality of theSong of Songs, affirming that “when [he] spoke of the Earthly Par-adise as a symbol of woman, it was [...]herbodyto which he wasreferring.”194Subordinating a woman’s unclothed flesh to its representation inpainting is, for Bloy, evidence of sinful pride, iconolatry, and sacrilege,a profanation of art’s purpose as doxological expression: “A purportedlyreligious art work that in no way inspires prayer is as monstrous as abeautiful woman who is unable to arouse anyone.”195"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"174Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FranceClotilde’s encounter with a series of tutelary intercessors suggestsBloy’s wish to set the novel, not in the hell of the Chapuis house-hold, but in an intermediate zone of purgative redemption. ThatClotilde escapes a Gehenna of abuse and degradation and is not exiledfrom an asylum of safety and unknowing confirms Bloy’s view of thechild/woman who inherits the sins of the father.The caricaturist Gacougnol, the first of Clotilde’s benefactors, usesart to show the modern world as a grotesque deformation of Creation.Bloy’s own stylistic blending of exaggeration and buffoonery groups hiscontemporaries in a bestiary ofhippopotamusesandcrocodiles. Indeed,the path that takes Clotilde from the earthly garden to its celestial coun-terpart begins when Gacougnol escorts her to the Jardin des Plantes,a fin-de-siècle version of Eden in Paris. Having escaped the jackals ofthe Chapuis family, she is instructed by her mentors in the mystery,stoicism, and nobility of tigers.The chronological overlap ofLe DésespéréandLa Femme pauvreenablesMarchenoir to return and act as Clotilde’s second teacher. Still eulogizedby Bloy as an evangelist and orator, Marchenoir acknowledges the infir-mity of human art, which shows its subject refracted through the lens ofanthropocentrism. Marchenoir laments the plight of artists toiling afterthe Fall: “I await the clairvoyant poet who will write the ‘Paradise Lost’of our aesthetic innocence.”196Similar comments deprecating the utility of Bloy’s own calling, sub-ordinating men’s sophistication to the simplicity of women, proliferatein the novel’s second section, where male artists begin to vanish. FirstGacougnol, targeted by Clotilde’s stepfather and mother, is found knifedin the chest and dies days later in the hospital. Marchenoir’s death ago-nies alone in his apartment reprise the conclusion of the precedingnovel. And Clotilde’s husband, Léopold, the illuminator aged by sad-ness and misfortune, finds that his eyesight has dimmed so that he mustabandon his profession. After Clotilde is educated in medieval historyand art, her teachers become superfluous and make way for the hero-ine, as the novel begins to focus on her developing relationship withChrist.Like Léopold’s conversion, Clotilde’s evolving spirituality is a matterthat Bloy concedes his novel cannot convey: “Art has nothing more tosay once God manifests himself.”197As a refugee from her childhood home and an exile from the garden,Clotilde cannot become like Eve and re-enter the innocence of Eden.Lacking fluency in the language of animals and stones, she can onlyguess at the secret thoughts of the tigers at the zoo. Yet as a foreigner"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"The Mystic175in the modern world, she is always oriented backward – toward the firstmother, toward a time of simplicity and faith. Encouraged by a mission-ary she had encountered once in church, she prays to Eve whom sheremembers having guided her in dreams – toan adorable countrywherelions and nightingales had swooned with melancholy. She is told byGacougnol of her affinity with the Middle Ages, a time of zealotry andmysticism, “ten centuries of ecstasy,” a fortress of prayer built on theruins of innocence: “an immense church of the kind one will see nomore until God returns to earth.”198Yet the poverty that is Clotilde’sbirthright as Eve’s daughter must be exchanged for the poverty thatqualifies her for the beatitude of sainthood.Deliverance from timeLike medieval man, Bloy’s characters live in the hope of an apocalypse –not the joyful consummation that Vintras had predicted, nor the recur-rent cataclysm described by Huysmans inSainte Lydwine, but humanity’simminent extinction, of which Bloy discovered portents everywhere.After the Deluge of guilt and remorseful sorrow – after the lachrymalbaptism that engulfed the world – they await the baptism of flameallowing them to be reborn in paradise. Following the apparition ofCelle qui pleurecame Mélanie’s vision ofLa Dame en Feu(the Lady ofFire). And following the punishment for eating the fruit of the Treeof Knowledge comes the thirst that binds the sinner to Jesus on theCross. The Thirst for God is unlike “the desires of the mouth thatcost man everything. On the Tree of Calvary, which is at once thenew Tree of Life and Knowledge, there hangs a fruit a thousand timesmore beautiful and delicious than the one that Eve desired.”199Eve,who had been banished for violating the taboo onconsumption,isredeemed by Mary, whose suffering ends with its accomplishment, theconsummation.In Bloy’s book, Clotilde is redeemed by exchanging suffering enduredfor poverty embraced, when pain is not a curse visited on the selfbut a blessing conferring grace that can be bestowed on another. WithMarchenoir’s death, Bloy loses his pretext for indulging in chapter-longdigressive indictments of his coevals’ irreligion and literary mediocrity.Increasingly unconcerned for the society in which his characters haveno home, he turns the narrative toward religious allegory, oneiricalprefigurations of the coming stages of a soul journey.Theepigraphicsubtitleaccompanyingtheopeningofthenovel,épisode contemporain, ceases to refer to the historical specificity of the"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"176Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francefinal decades of the nineteenth century and, as Polet says, signifies “thepotential simultaneity of the episode with every moment in time.”200This is a cyclical, recurrent, liturgical present, “the time of penitence andpurgation, a duration through which the Christian seeks to pass fromthe world of death to the world of eternal life.”201An indefinite periodof expiatory suffering, the story unfolds in the time that is needed, thetime that ends in the experience of deliverance. As the story ceasesto be a tale of personal affront, becoming universalized as a chronicleof man’s Fall and possible redemption, Bloy situates mystical experi-ence on a level beyond time, where contemporaneity is equated witheternity.Bloy, at one point, injects his own voice into the narrative, con-gratulating himself on abandoning the conceit of naturalist verisimil-itude: “plausible stories,” he writes, “are unworthy of being told.”202Filled with annuciatory dreams, symbolic adumbrations, episodes ofmystical clairvoyance, the temporal frame of Bloy’s novel becomesincreasingly elastic, telescoping the past as promise into a future offulfillment.Clotilde’s migration from a water-world to the realm of fire is signaledby the comments made by the missionary who once addresses her inchurch. Describing her as a descendant of Eve, Mother of the Living, headmonishes Clotilde to remember him “when you are in the flames.”203It is only in the final pages that the patriarch’s prediction comestrue, when Clotilde has finished the purgative cleansing of her life,having transformed herself from the child of Eve to the epigoneof Mary.Bloy describes Clotilde returning one night from a banquet of literaryluminaries, an agape attended by the kinds of artists Bloy never tiredof excoriating: Huysmans, pseudonymously represented as Folantinfrom his novellaA Vau-l’eau, Bohémond de l’Isle de-France represent-ing Villiers de l’Isle-Adam. With her head throbbing in the aftermath“of that singular, intolerable evening,” Clotilde falls asleep, where-upon phantoms begin to file by, “before the open eyes of her soul.”204In her dream, against a backdrop of sunlessness, pitch, and compaction,she sees Gacougnol stabbed, Marchenoir stooped under an unbear-able weight, Léopold standing in an inferno, hair ablaze, arms crossedimpassively.Filled with anticipatory signs, Bloy’s book incorporates the theme ofpoverty as its dearth of narrative surprise. In Tardif’s cryptogram of theeternal text of Creation, every event is predetermined, every conclusionwritten in advance."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"The Mystic177The suffering of the subject and the “Pleasures of the Lord”Yet despite Bloy’s claim to have rid his novel of naturalist verisimil-itude – uncovering under its apparent adventitiousness the text of adivine teleology – his narrative follows the characters’ passage throughthe reality of their worsening misery. Paralleling Bloy and Anne-Marie’sprogression along Way of the Cross, through dismal Parisian neigh-borhoods, Clotilde and her husband first occupy a cramped tenementwhose walls are permeated with soul-blighting effluvia, “somethingbetween the stench of a corpse-filled ditch and the alkaline suffoca-tion of a cesspool.”205Thereafter, the couple finds even greater hardshipwhen they move to a suburb where they are tormented by scandal-mongering neighbors.Loss and despoliation, experienced on an interpersonal level, explainthe theme of poverty as the deprivation of love, the severing of ties tothe world. The death of Clotilde’s infant son, Lazare, poisoned by thestinking toxins that fill their apartment, re-establishes her link to Mary,“the spotless Mother of thousands of millions of children destined todie the most infamous death, soiled by the most indescribable filth.”206So great are man’s suffering and penury that, at times, Bloy feels hiswriting’s purpose is disqualified: “In the Presence of the death of a child,Art and Poetry are truly pitiful things.”207Clotilde’s first loss comes as a child, when, having inherited her par-ents’ guilt, she is dispossessed of innocence as a condition of her birth.Further impoverished by the carelessness with which she loses her vir-ginity, Clotilde is water whose pollution her tears cannot clean: “myspring is dried up,” she thinks, “my limpid water has turned to mud.”208Mother of a son who dies, Clotilde experiences Eve’s pain of child-bearing, then suffers again when she sees him depart the world. Humanbeings who cannot remember God’s face see in their children a reflectionof a forgotten divinity. Uncorrupted, inchoate, they are purity uncom-promised: “their children, for them, are a Paradise of Delight.”209Parentsleft to contemplate their coffins relive expulsion from a garden guardedby an angel with a sword of fire.Separated from her teachers, bereft of her baby, Clotilde comes toknow a poverty different from a scarcity of material comfort. Bloy who,inLe Sang du Pauvre(The Blood of the Poor), denounces those too miserlyto give alms, women whose diamonds are bought with the death ofcolonized Africans, shows Clotilde having a dream on the relation ofdebtors and creditors. A homiletic parable, it features Christ asProprietor,an owner demanding a settling of accounts with heartless landlords who"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"178Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francedrive out their tenants. Christ, whose family was denied sanctuary andwas made to sleep in a stable, is asked by the poor, “the members of hisbody,” when there will come an end to their suffering: “What time is iton the clock of your interminable Passion?” – Time to pay your rent,” heanswers the wealthy, “or to go into the street and die with the childrenof dogs.”210Following Clotilde’s dream, the novel concludes by showing Léopoldand Clotilde completing their experience of transience, as unsheltered,ephemeral beings who pass on the earth. In harmony with Bloy’sconception of the dispossession that sanctifies, he defines poverty, asErnest Hello had done, not as a matter of proprietorship, but as one ofontology – not as thenothingthat one has, but as thenothingnessthatone is.Henceforth, the couple’s home is a paupers’ graveyard in Paris wherethey gather with family and friends at their tombs. In Bloy, the ceme-tery is a place where murder is forgotten, a necropolis of infanticidescarried out long ago, children slaughtered “in abattoirs of misery”211and who now sleep under crosses carrying no name. Pulverized bodiesdispersed in the soil contradict the idea of a place of rest for the dead.Often Clotilde feels Lazare’s presence, can hear him speaking in her ear,saying that everywhere is the dead child’s home, “because souls haveno place.”212Blessed are they who mourn, Christ says, for they shall becomforted.No longer suffocating in a room smelling of charnel houses, Lazarelives “in the Light, in Beauty, in Love, in Joy without limit.” As remissionfrom suffering is found in the telluric womb of the mother, “Paradise lostis the cemetery,” Marchenoir says.213“For Bloy,” as Roswell comments, “the holy nature of all womenstemmed from the fact that one woman’s body had been chosen to con-tain the Saviour of the world. In medieval symbolism, the garden wasa figure for the virginal matrix in which the Saviour was conceived aswell as being the Paradise into which he drew the soul.”214The earthlydiaspora through which Bloy’s heroine wanders gives way to the homeof her physical person. According to Marchenoir, Christ’s birth had beencelebrated by angels proclaiming “Glory to God” and Peace to men,bothinand on earth. Among the time-eroded, rain-obliterated inscrip-tions on infants’ graves, Bloy writes the end of his narrative of theirinconsolable parents.While Bloy’s biography might have lacking in drama and dynamism –while his personal life was spent uneventfully “in the drab landscapesof the Paris suburbs,” remaining, until the end, as John Coombes"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"The Mystic179writes, “unutterably unattractive, friendless, and joyless,”215the spiritualitinerary mapped out in his fiction ends in a quiet transfiguration.ConclusionOn the night of May 25, 1887, a date whose specificity blends into anaorist eternity, Clotilde is alone in the house, her husband having leftseveral hours ago. “The book that they made together had finally beenfinished.”216The final scene of the novel restores the thematic unity of water andfire, sorrow and its mitigation, movement and rest, grief and rejoicing.After reading the Office of Mary, Clotilde listens to Baudelaire’s hymnto appeasement:Sois sage, ô ma Douleur[Be still, my sorrow], the poetencourages his Sister. Hear, he writes, “la douce nuit qui marche” [thesoft night that walks].217At nine o’clock, while Léopold is on the other side of Paris savingstrangers from the conflagration at the Opéra-Comique, Clotilde has apremonition of the momentousness of the hour. After rescuing adulter-ous lawyers, provincial notaries, maidens whose virginity is certified bysalesmen, Léopold had re-entered the inferno and, in fulfillment of themissionary’s prediction, had stood immobile in a whirlwind, burningalive, “withhisarmsfolded.”218The final purgative destitution on her path to the perfection ofpoverty, Léopold’s incineration frees Clotilde of her last attachment tothe world. Her preparation ends with a final pillaging of the sanctuary,as her soul is scoured of the clutter of its treasure: the mosaics of feelings,the gemstones of thoughts, the enamels of old regrets, all thrown intothe pit of an “infinite obsecration.”219Experienced as percussion andeffulgence, the fire that consumes Clotilde can catch when she alonesupplies the fuel.Immediately preceding the scene where Clotilde blazes withthe Plea-sure of the Lord, Bloy includes a Latin text from theCelestial Revelationsof Saint Birgitta. There a soul that has been judged completes its incen-diary changes: flames shoot from pores, teeth, studding the mouth likeiron nails, pierce the palate, the tongue, pulled back through the nos-trils, hangs over swollen lips, and skin, like that on bodies, covers thesoul with its cold, dirty linen. This is the calamity awaiting the one notpurified by sorrow’s water: “cum lacrymis totis viribis suis.”220It is from this that Clotilde escapes as a holocaust and bridesmaid.It begins with a feeling of peace and lightness: “the quick, the ag-ile,Ag-nis, ig-nis.”221Sparks swirl, flames, wrapping around her legs like"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"180Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Franceundulating snakes, rise to her breast that melts like wax. A burnt offeringand celebrant, a worshipper and shrine, Bloy’s heroine is topologized asthe place where she turns into herself. The theme of itineracy that isdeveloped throughLa Femme pauvreconcludes when Clotilde finds theplace she belongs: “She sees herself in a cathedral of fire. It is the housethat she had asked for.”222What had begun in La Salette with the vision of the inconsolable Vir-gin is finished with the bride’s betrothal in fire. Neither the courage oftwenty lions, Bloy writes, nor the strength of eagles’ wings can stop thesoul from being consumed in the furnace of the divine. For a moment,Clotilde experiences the end of separateness, asCelle qui Pleureis marriedto “Celui qui brûle” [the One who burns].”223Widow of Léopold, Clotilde becomes nothingness complemented byPlenitude. Having glimpsed him as the “fire that walks before his face,”Clotilde sees her reflection in God, discovering the utility of poverty aswhat empties vessels, making room for the reality that fills. For Bloy,Polet writes, “the definition of God as a Poor Man aptly translates theapophatic sense of his lofty theological concepts,” identifying him as“pure Alterity, the Wholly Other, Absence, the Increate, the AbsoluteLack of everything belonging to Being.”224In Clotilde’s rapture, she experiences the impossible momentarinessof eternity, fire that does not eradicate but that cleanses and rebirths –fire which, while expressing the desire to “bring all life to its conclusion,to its hereafter,”225changes extinction into universality and speed intotimelessness.Having burned withla Volupté du Seigneur, Clotilde is not gone.Instead, she is described surviving as weightless debris left from theecstatic inferno, pale traces of her vanishing mortality: white hair, self-lessness, ubiquity, and silence “like the spaces of the sky.”226Still caughtfor a while in the world below, she has escaped the enslaving periodicityof desire and possession, attachment and loss. “One enters Paradise, nottomorrow, not the day after tomorrow, not in ten years. On enterstodayif one is crucified and poor.”227After she sells her remaining possessions and gives her money to theneedy, she makes her home in the falling rain. Colorless, tireless, shedisperses herself in gifts and motion, enjoying the grace accorded her“never to have need of rest.”228There is a pleonastic transparency in Bloy’s ideal ofla femme pauvre–no woman is rich in the world’s meretricious treasure. For her, friend-ship, food, and home are lures that beckon and deceive. The healthy andbeloved are not eligible for Christ’s selection.

At the end, Clotilde under-stands that “a Woman truly exists only if she is without bread, withoutshelter, without friends, without a husband or children.

Rather than experienc-ing eternity, she knows only the patience ofnot yet.

Like his fellow visionaries, Ernest Hello and Léon Bloy,Huysmans impatiently awaited the apocalypse but did not believethat millenarianism was incompatible with participation in worldlyaffairs. Indeed, as Jean-Marie Seillan remarks, it was during the time ofHuysmans’s service as an oblate at Ligugé – a period transparently repro-duced in his volume of fictional autobiographyL’Oblat[The Oblate],1903)– that he became ever more passionately involved in the politi-cal controversies engulfing France and threatening to set at odds theinterest of the church and nation.Huysmans had seen his monastic dream of reconciling a love of reclu-sion and community withstand a mortal blow when, in 1901, the thenFrench Prime Minister, Waldeck-Rousseau, had passed the Contract ofAssociations, a law requiring every congregation to apply for reautho-rization by the state or run the risk of dissolution. The tepid churchresponse to this institutional danger had sharpened Huysmans’s disaf-fection for Pope Leo XIII, whose modernist disposition and Republicansympathies he had long found disappointing.At the dawning of the new century, Huysmans’s political beliefsremained colored by the conspiratorial notions that had shaped histhinking a decade earlier. The occultist ideas and worries about Satanismthat were evident inLà-basreappeared in Huysmans’s comments aboutthe Vatican’s response to the new law. Presumably sponsored by theJews and promoted by “Masonic mobs,” the Contract, according toHuysmans, had not elicited a strong enough reaction by the Pope,182"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"The Miracle-Worker183thereby proving the writer’s view that the pontiff had been corruptedby the “satanic sect” of Republicanism and that, in submitting to thegrowing forces of secularism, had entered into a “pact with the demon.”1Huysmans’s deepening conviction in the dovetailing of national andchurch history prompted a wish to try to reconcile his religious idealsand political sympathies. If God’s work was no longer reliably carriedout by leaders of the church, if an experience of the divine could not beachieved through private prayer, the spiritual aristocrat had to become achampion of the people. Temperamentally, Huysmans was ill-suited toenter the realm of political action; his outrage was strictly personal, asSeillan has affirmed. “Not based on any partisan engagement, not rootedin collective struggle,” Huysmans’s “combativeness was only verbal.”2Thus, it was by returning to literature that he could best describe themystical experience afforded by social action.What, for Huysmans, were complementary interests in supernatural-ism and social justice appear together inLesFoulesdeLourdes, wherehe equates the “evangelical ideal of thePoor, as representing Christ,”3and the socially marginalized toward whom the author’s politicalcompassion was extending.LesFoulesdeLourdes, the last book completed in Huysmans’s life,marks a completion of the final stage in his evolution as a supernatu-ralist at the same time it signals a return to his methodological originsas a naturalist. As with many of his contemporaries examined in thisvolume, the maturation of Huysmans’s views and the development ofhis faith show the adjustment of his political conservatism, his elitismas an artist, with an emerging wish to use his work in the service of thepeople. Belonging to an aristocracy of aesthetes, professing reactionaryprinciples, Huysmans displays a solidarity with those whose suffering hestrove to mitigate.The arc of Huysmans’s writing follows that of other fin-de-siècleoccultists, moving from the isolated grandeur of the Magus/intellectualtoward a re-establishment of fraternal ties with people benefiting fromhis knowledge. From superiority to sacrifice – from megalomania to self-forgetfulness – the spiritual seeker re-descends into the world of otherpeople. No longer boasting, like the thaumaturge, of feats of occult virtu-osity, he sees the mysterious hand of God at work in miracles of everydaygenerosity.InLesFoulesdeLourdes(1906), Huysmans begins by resuming the nat-uralist work of observation and recording. Undertaken after a 1903 visitto the pilgrimage site, Huysmans’s book illustrates the convert’s abne-gation of self and the magnification of God through an acceptance of"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"184Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francethe humility of his art. Corresponding to the mysterious enormity ofthe miracles worked in Lourdes is the diminishment of their transcriber,as the author grows smaller, his contributions less obtrusive, and histext becomes the site where he experiences “the benefit of personalomission.”4In Huysmans’s final novel, naturalism – as diagnostic methodology –is turned against itself in order to prove the operation of a supernat-ural agency. Identified by fin-de-siècle occultists as the most serious ofthreats, science is used by Huysmans to define the limits of empiricism,as naturalism marks the end point where it is succeeded by an art of thetranscendental.After acceding to the invitation of long-time friends Léon andMarguerite Leclaire to visit them in Lourdes and compile material for abook, Huysmans had arrived on March 5, 1903, and had found himselfimpressed, not by manifestations of divine mercy, but by the other-worldly tastelessness of Lourdes’s religious architecture. “Roused,” asRobert Baldick says, “to a fury of invective and abuse remarkable evenfor such a past master in the art of vituperation,”5Huysmans had ragedagainst the hideousness of the Basilica, the Rosary, the Esplanade, profa-nations of art so hyperbolic they could have been inspired only by theEvil One. Unchanged through his career, Huysmans still considered art’sperversion as unmistakable evidence of Satan’s handiwork.The limits of science and artYet apart from giving vent to his indignation at contemporary religiousart, Huysmans entertained a far more important purpose in the execu-tion of his project. Having come to Lourdes to exalt the Creator andhumble himself as his creature, he had at first adopted a naturalist prac-tice in order to refute Zola’s naturalist allegations – that the miraculoushealings effected by the Virgin were produced by auto-suggestion, byan abatement of nervous disorders, or by what Charcot had calledthefaith that heals(La Foi qui guérit, 1893). As Huysmans reasons, diseasedtissue cannot regenerate instantaneously. “Nature cannot close a woundin a second; flesh cannot restore itself in a minute, but Zola refuses torecognize these spontaneous cures which he witnessed nonetheless.”6Indeed, the mortification of Huysmans as a writer begins with his fol-lowing Zola’s method. As an artist whose career had taken him fromrealist objectivity to the shadowy world of devil worship and the realmof necromantic warfare, Huysmans returns to the work of naturalism,as he observes and emulates the doctor – guided by science, chastened"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"The Miracle-Worker185by skepticism, doubtful that the unexplainable phenomena occurringin Lourdes were genuine. In his visits to the clinic of Doctor Boissarie,the physician entrusted with documenting the authenticity of cures,Huysmans adopts the physician’s practice of endlessly invalidating hisdiscipline, using medicine to identify the limitations of medicine, ver-ifying in naturalist language supernatural events whose significancetranscended language. Huysmans’s theory of the miraculous is conveyedby his new conception of literature, as the magnitude, the sacred-ness, and the mystery of his subject are measured by the modesty andsmallness of their expression.As Huysmans’s own style had once conveyed the artist’s individual-ity, his immersion in the crowds of Lourdes marks the final stage of hissurrender of authorial pride. No longer immured in the splendid iso-lation of a library, in the tower of the Magus, in the fortress safety ofthe monastery, Huysmans disintegrates into the anonymity of every-one, his voice lost in the prayerful polyglottism of invalids from all overthe world. Marking the final stage in the evolution of fin-de-siècle super-naturalism, Huysmans’s writing abandons the exceptional self in favorof the anonymous community.However, in the beginning of the book, Huysmans expresses hisambivalence toward Lourdes, linking his reservations to a revulsion forthe throngs his title mentions. “To begin with, I dislike processioningcrowds that go about bellowing hymns,”7writes an author insistent onrespecting corporeal and linguistic boundaries.In Huysmans’s opening chapter, he highlights the opposition betweenhis text’s purpose as documentation and its value as an artwork. If,on the level of content,LesFoulesdeLourdesaddresses the authen-ticity of miracles, on the level of personal expression, it conveys thequiet spiritual development of the author. On virtually every page,Huysmans explores the phenomenon of immersion and dissolution:dirty baths in which suppurating invalids and menstruating womenplunge their bodies, small candles lit by the poor that melt into a tow-ering, amorphous wax offering illumined by many. The loss of self inthe multitudes, the drowning of Huysmans’s distinctive voice in theplurivocality of the chanting masses is transposed as the breaching ofepidermal walls, the constant evocation of bodies that leak and ooze inimages of hemorrhage, seepage, abscess, and gangrene. In the traditionof mystic writers inspired by Vintras’s teachings on Dolorism, Huysmansidentifies the body in pain as the locus of the miraculous.For Huysmans himself, it is style that is the site of his mortification.Unlike art that exalts difference, liturgy requires standardization. The"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"186Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Franceprideful author who had spoken in words unmistakably his own joinswith pilgrims directing their supplications to the Virgin in ceremoniesconducted collectively.Crowds and coalescenceBelieving the more discrete his authorial utterance, the more indis-putable God’s response, Huysmans mingles with the crowd, agreeing topray as they do. Huysmans’s willingness to coalesce with others marksa drastic alteration of long-held views on style and self, a violation ofthe boundaries of his identity and his books. Huysmans’s dissolution incollectivity of anonymous, desperate worshippers involves an act of self-renunciation, a transient ego death recalling the mystic’s experience aschronicled inLydwine. The author who had defended the fortress of hisidentity, fiercely insisting on the inviolability of self as sanctuary, goesout among the people in order to champion their concerns.Formerly, as Jean Borie has written, the Huysmansian body had notbeen “a point of contact and exchange with the outside,” but “a citadel”within which the hero had barricaded himself, “directing his sensestoward the external world in fear of a possible invasion [...] whileeverything inside him pleaded: “please, do not touch me’.”8Describing a night spent in a sleeping car on a train from Paris toCologne (De Tout, 1902) Huysmans had expressed a horror of the dis-comfort, promiscuity, and exposure that are the least of the concerns oftrain travelers to Lourdes. Private space as impregnable enclosure, thestylistically inaccessible book, the art-upholstered Thebaïd: these hadonce been topological expressions of walls that regulated intercoursewith a reading public. But during peak season, when Lourdes is over-run with dazed pilgrims quartered in hangars, sleeping on straw mats,housed under eaves, and garrisoned in dormitories, Huysmans enduresthe penance of contact with raw humanity’s physical presence.Returning from style to substance, from art to its material, Huysmanssubmits toun bain de multitude(a bath in the multitudes) – notBaudelaire’s transient occupation of a passer-by glimpsed on the side-walk – but a liquefaction of identity in the clamorousturbuswhosenumbers overwhelm their differences in language, dress, and custom.Huysmans often notes that the visitors who most willingly accept adisaffiliation from nation, class, and language are those most likelyto benefit from the miracle of grace as cure. They are unlike theBelgians who refuse to join in communal prayer, establish separateoutposts of comfort, and who, “after obtaining, at the time of their"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"The Miracle-Worker187first pilgrimages, a number of striking miracles, experienced far fewerthereafter.”9As Huysmans observes, those most willing to abandon theprecincts of convenience are the ones who are most blessed, those whodo not turn Christ away but vacate the self in order to accommodatethe divine. Huysmans realizes that extraordinary things happen whenhabits are relinquished and that miracles occur in places that are emp-tied of routine. No longer sequestered, like the Magus, in the austereprivacy of his study, the author creates his text as agora like Lourdes’ssacred sites that throng with visitors.A countervailing tendency evident in the production of Huysmans’swork is his corroborating the exceptional by testing it against theordinary. In the account of his conversion, Huysmans consistentlydownplayed the momentousness of God’s intervention. Related inEnRouteas “something like the digestion of a stomach at work,”10the taleof Huysmans’s encounter with the supernatural is further evidence ofhis equating faith with an act of artistic asceticism. Always fastidious inthe maintenance of his person, jealous of the hidden recesses of his pri-vate subjectivity, Huysmans finally mixes with the crowds, agreeing tohis incorporation in Lourdes’s belly, where his spiritual growth dependson a digestion assimilating him to everyone.Unlike Lourdes, indiscriminately invaded by diffident invalids andpious exhibitionists, Huysmans’s books had not always been character-ized as points of confluence for all comers. Formerly troubled by hiswriting’s accessibility “to the dirty curiosity of crowds,”11Huysmans hadguarded the privacy of his consciousness as an unpublished text, defin-ing it as a meeting place for the man who prays and the God to which heprays. Distinguishing autobiography from personal disclosure, he hadforbidden entry to those desiring details of his stay at Notre-Dame-de-l’Atre. Unlike the novel where readers come together, Huysmans’spauvreêtreis declared off-limits, his private thoughts no one’s affair. Thus,Huysmans declines to speak to “simply curious people wishing to med-dle in my private business, desiring to walk around in my soul as if itwere a public place.”12Part of the miracle of Huysmans’s acquiescence to literary humilityis a democratized style that offers hospitality to everyone. Textual pil-grims welcomed inLesFoulesdeLourdesinclude the faithful, the skepticswho still remain open-minded, historians interested in the account ofBernadette’s vision, archeologists and scholars of comparative religionwho learn of the Satanic ceremonies once conducted on the site, theraising of dolmens, the performance of blood sacrifices as part of the cultof Venus Astarte.

All that is left, as he complains, “are invalids without the luxuryof a particularly horrible affliction.”13Yet what is conveyed in Huysmans’s prose is a recognition that thepurpose of a miracle as theatrical extravaganza is a restoration of thebanality of health. Disgust, pathos, outrage, and shock are cured andreturned to a state of oblivious indifference. With their ostentatiouseffects, miracles nullify their causes, unwriting narrative tragedy, rein-stating the platitude of healed organs, mended limbs, unscarred skin,and regular features.In the same way that naturalism had adopted the methodologyof Claude Bernard, the miraculous in Lourdes acts as supernaturalmedicine, aiming at an elimination of the pretext for its occurrence. Nat-uralist fiction, as Pierre Citti observes, pits “a tyrannical milieu” against“a case of morbid individualism.”14As God, in his mysterious workings,inflicts an ailment on his creature then inexplicably alleviates it, thenaturalist author invests his hero with a rare trait or exceptional fea-ture, then cures him of his singularity by assimilating him into society.As the miracle works to restore the ordinariness of health, it works in theopposite sense of the spectacular deeds performed by the Magus and theSatanist. The exceptionality of the thaumaturge is likened to a maladythat God and those who serve him strive together to remove.Huysmans rightly intuits art’s homology with disease and difference,suffering and guilt, all straining for their cancellation and remission,all seeking a return to the inexpressiveness of health. Contrasting thediscreetness of his conversion experience at La Salette with the clam-orousness of the miracles he witnesses in Lourdes, Huysmans longs for"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"The Miracle-Worker189absolution from the sin of creation. AsLà-hauthad concluded with atheophany unrelated in the narrative, Huysmans equates the expres-sion of God’s grace with a discontinuation of his writing. The angrydesperation of Léon Bloy, the prayerful anticipation of Ernest Hello areexpressions of impatience that the apocalypse takes too long in coming.While Huysmans, during his stay in Lourdes, sees no sign of the worldending, God’s daily intervention in the lives of suffering pilgrims makesthe need for art as supplication seem less urgent. Manifestations of thedivine, miracles as quiet acts of altruism, enable the artist to define hisrole more modestly, asLes Foules de Lourdessuggests. When God speaks,as Huysmans says, the writer should fall silent.As a stage set, La Salette had impressed the author as barren anddenuded, empty of the dramatic terrain and theatrical appurtenancesof Lourdes: “a place without trees or birds or flowers.”15Conversely,Lourdes’ topography is as colorful as its miracles, with its funiculartraversing vertiginous mountain chasms over “a cheerful landscape froma comic opera.”16Gaudily dressed crowds from exotic locales, con-flagrations of wax and fire, fantasy terrain, supernatural phenomena,grotesqueries on parade: Lourdes as setting and narrative premise is asrich as its description is poor.The miracle democratizedCharacterized by absence and anticipation, La Salette had been anuncluttered version of the Huysmansian sanctuary. There, Huysmanswrites, “one lives withdrawn into oneself.”17In Lourdes, however, themiracle Huysmans undergoes is to be cured of reflexivity: “one feelsopened out in Lourdes.”18When Huysmans writes that “infinite Beautyis identical to God himself,”19he equates holiness-as-art, not with thegorgeous phraseology he confects, but with the beauty of the selflessacts that his fellow man performs. As both the principle of Doloristreparation and an expression of Huysmans’s masochist aesthetic, hisinitial belief was that visitors to Lourdes could help God in his workby consenting to their trials, thereby imitating Christ’s Passion: “beforethe grotto, one should not pray that his ills be cured but instead thatthey be increased. One should give himself as a holocaustic offering, inexpiation for the sins of the world.”20But then he comes to see that the practice of Mystic Substitution isjust another way to position a noisy self on center stage. Not an actof self-omission, it was a petition for attention, casting a uniquely tor-mented subject as the leading character in his drama. In subordinating"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"190Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle Francehis narrative to its content – in becoming only one of namelessthousands – Huysmans is healed by what Zola called “the crowds’ heal-ing breath.”21Where once the writer had been crucified by the uglinessof the world, posing as the hero in the story of its embellishment, heis now eclipsed by people who create beauty through their generosity –the caretakers, stretcher-bearers, nurses, and attendants who, throughforgetfulness of self, invite the Virgin’s intercession.To Huysmans, it is this compassionate activity that best bears witnessto God’s presence, since the miracles seen in Lourdes are often sporadicand unjustified. Indeed, proof of the miraculous, as Huysmans comesto realize, is not always found in the spectacular suddenness of cures.Sometimes the most deserving are sent home still unhealed. Sometimesa child, blessed with a disappearance of paralysis, mysteriously relapsesand his suffering resumes.Huysmans’s sense of justice is offended by these occurrences, and heargues that, if the divinity is equivalent to beauty made infinite, Godshould not seek his reflection in his creatures’ disfigurement. Havingbeen cast in the Creator’s likeness, the monster is an outrage and a sacri-lege, an insult to God’s majesty as reflected in the mirror of human faces.Thus, the plea for compassion that Huysmans addresses to the Lord is anappeal that He protect the integrity of his image: “Remember the imageof your Holy Face; it was anguished, bloody, but not repulsive. Save thedignity of your image, with a miracle, and clean this unclean face.”22As such, Lourdes’s miracles are not a disruption of the natural orderbut a re-establishment of the harmony between the celestial and humanorders, restoration of the harmony between God’s goodness and itsexpression. Twisted limbs and leprous figures are texts enshrining aber-rancy, which God, as the first author, can expunge and wipe away. Thewritten record of a miracle is evidence of its effacement: dried sores,faint scars, new, pink skin. Like sojourners in a naturalist novel, thelucky visitors to Lourdes receive God’s grace and then depart, healed ofthe affliction of their difference.It is by being inscribed in the realm of interpersonal relations thatmiracles recover their dramatic power, in the community where diverseclasses and different countries coalesce. In Lourdes, the supernaturalmanifests itself by eliminating separateness, as the blessed are thosewho work together and desire to resemble everyone. Not celebrated by aprelate stressing his sacerdotal privilege, Lourdes’s Masses are performedcollectively by priests from Portugal and Macao: “‘We are going to giveHoly Communion”’ as one of them proclaims, to which Huysmans addshis comment: “the wordwewas an entire world.”23"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"The Miracle-Worker191Huysmans’s Dolorist belief in the redemptive benefit of pain is con-firmed by Lourdes’ turning into an ideal Christian microcosm. No stylis-tically tormented curiosity, Lourdes is a living work of art told in a linguafranca: “It is a profession of faith by an entire world emerging from theconfusion of languages in order to express itself in the idiom of theliturgy. It is a concentration of all the individual petitions of the daythat are then gathered in a sheaf of common prayer.”24Overshadowing the aesthetic blight on Lourdes caused by the Basilicaand Rosary, exorbitancies that outrage public taste with their immod-esty, is the humble work that people do to bring relief to others.While deploring the commercial exploitation of visitors by Lourdes’businesses – profiteering by trinket-merchants and hawkers of religiousparaphernalia – Huysmans sees the city as an ideal society founded onthe principle of charity.Shaken out of their cocoon of habit by the ubiquity of suffering,Lourdes’s helpers are moved by the sight of monsters to view com-placency as monstrous. As Pierre Jourde writes, the presence of thesespecimens undermines the stability of the viewer’s autonomy: “Whathappens in a helpless body? In blind flesh? At the bottom of the mostextreme suffering? It seems that everything there is different, unheardof. Even more, the monster’s dismembered, infirm body issues a chal-lenge to us. It is an unimaginable world that takes us inside it becausewe can share the same space – because we can touch it.”25Unlike the structural ugliness of buildings immuring Huysmans indisgust, the hideousness of the deformed invites attempts to heal andmitigate. Walls of skin, of national provenance, of class affiliation arebroken down, enabling people to come together. As Huysmans writes ofLourdes, “it is here that utopia begins.”26In Huysmans’s book, health, like indifference, is an expression ofnarcissism enclosing a subject in self-sufficiency and well-being. Moti-vated to try to ease a victim’s discomfort, helpers also violate theirself-interested independence, making both pain and care monstrous andmiraculous. Operating in the same way as medicine, naturalist texts likeZola’s work to demystify the wonders of Lourdes, intending a transfor-mation of incredible events into the nothingness of their explanation.Endeavoring to disprove miracles, diagnosing the pathology of generos-ity, Zola’s version of naturalism seeks to cure difference and controvertthe sacred inspiration of concern for one’s brother. But like DoctorBoissarie in his clinic in Lourdes, patiently investigating the authentic-ity of miracles, Huysmans remains skeptical in order to believe and bebelievable."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"192Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FranceHuysmans acknowledges the heterology of God’s plan and man’sbooks, realizing that while a writer creates a conflict that his dénoue-ment resolves, the miracles seen in Lourdes correspond to no plotnecessity, occur in response to no character development. As a narra-tive, Lourdes’s miracles are illogical and unsatisfying, and in Huysmans’sstory, God remains an enigmatic hero.The alchemy of sufferingIn the opening chapter ofLà-bas, Huysmans’s protagonist, Durtal, hadargued for the need to free naturalism from its rut, propelling it out ofits fixation on adultery and madness. Rather than dealing with bodiesracked by lust and disease, the novel had to complement its physiology-based themes with a parallel study of the state of man’s spirit: “it wasalso necessary to plumb the soul, no longer try to explain life’s mysteryin terms of the sicknesses of the senses.”27The model for what Durtal had calledspiritual naturalismis MatthiasGrünewald’s Crucixion canvas, where the painter had captured theignoble flesh of the man and the supernatural charity of the incar-nated God. According to Durtal, Grünewald had effected a synthesis ofbody and soul and permitted a refinement of naturalism into spiritualbeauty. Going at once to “the two extremes, he had extracted from themost triumphant squalor the essence of charity, the finest distillate ofdespair.”28Moving from painting to social action, spiritual naturalism is evi-dent in the selfless communalism of Lourdes. Emerging from the openwounds, the pain-furrowed faces, and the contorted limbs of the pil-grims to Lourdes is miraculous evidence of spiritual life, a soul appearingin the caregiver’s attentions. As the Virgin had wept beside the cruci-fied Christ, she is present at the spectacle of suffering’s redemption ofindifference.After citing Grünewald’s realization of the ideal of spiritualnaturalism, Huysmans modifies his definition of this new form of art.Rather than tracing the development of man’s spiritual being along “aparallel route” above his bodily existence, he describes a moment whentormented flesh turns into compassionate spirit.InSainte Lydwine de Schiedam(1902), Huysmans calls pain the Philoso-pher’s Stone, an alchemical agent transmuting suffering into love. “Theformula for this divine Alchemy which is suffering,” as Huysmanswrites, “is self-abnegation and self-sacrifice. After the necessary periodof incubation, the Great Work is accomplished. Out of the crucible of"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"The Miracle-Worker193the soul, the gold of Love emerges, which does away with all dejectionand dries up all tears.”29Spiritual naturalism identifies a point of convergence where thistransmutation takes place: cancer and charity, deformity and altru-ism, when bodily sickness becomes an impulse to alleviate it. This isthe direction toward which Huysmans’s later novels move, as he car-ries “spiritual naturalism, as he had discovered it in Grünewald, toits final extreme, examining the aesthetics of representing the disfig-ured body from the perspective of an imminent manifestation of thespirit.”30As Huysmans had interpreted the candle as a symbol – the wax asthe white flesh of Jesus, the wick as his immaculate soul, the flame as“the emblem of his divinity”31– one might say that a body supportedby love is consumed by pain’s fire and then sent skyward as spirit.On the level of literature, a reverse alchemy occurs, as Huysmans, theself-centered stylist, sacrifices the treasure of language so that his workmight be reborn as testimony to God’s majesty.InLesFoulesdeLourdes, Huysmans illustrates the transformationof monsters into miracles, showing literature’s transition from post-naturalist exhaustion to a revitalized art that manifests the divine.As Sylvie Duran comments, Huysmans’s “craving for the monstrous”conveys a “need for marvels,”32for phenomena unshackling literaturefrom its enslavement to empiricism.In Lourdes, the monsters Huysmans encounters are not those fea-tured in Vladimir Jankélévitch’s nosology of fin-de-siècle anomalies: theself-admiring sophistication of the Satanist aesthete, the hypertrophicsubjectivity of the rarefied Magus. These had been “narcissistic mon-sters” engrossed in abyssal self-study, oblivious to the world and thepeople inhabiting it, incapable of arresting “consciousness from lapsinginto morbid self-scrutiny and self-analysis.”33Previously, the fin-de-siècle thaumaturge had taken himself as his own object, disdainingthe poverty of quotidian reality, isolating himself from others, lock-ing himself in self-examination. Huysmans’s pre-conversion fiction hadforegrounded this involuted character, whose self had expanded to fillup the text, crowding out the possibility of plot and event. Inflationof this exalted subject had brought an emptying of the fictional world,congealing intrigue in stagnation, expelling others judged undeservingof attention: “a consciousness fascinated by its navel, anxious and dif-fuse, languishing from its love of subtlety, introspection, and tautology.It is a volatile thought, a hint of a thought, the scent of a hint. It is nolonger anything.”34"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"194Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècle FranceConclusionFor the fin-de-siècle Satanist and xenophobe, the other had been consid-ered a monster: terrifying, unintelligible, repellent, unfathomable. Forthe Magus, the plight of suffering humanity had been abstracted intotheory. Those languishing on the sublunary plane had been refined intooccult symbols. But by the end of the century, the esotericist’s orien-tation inward had been replaced by social action, as artists made com-mon cause with the people. Convulsive political events made aestheticself-isolation increasing difficult; leading symbolist writers professed sol-idarity with the growing anarchist movement and voiced outrage at therepressivelois scélératespassed in 1893. In response to Zola’s denuncia-tion of the guilty verdict rendered on Alfred Dreyfus inJ’accuse(January1898), the artist community was further polarized, and political turmoilbecame more prevalent. In aesthetics, a return to nature and a rejectionof the cult of artificiality accompanied the spread of nationalism and areimmersion in the issues of the day. No longer able to stay sequesteredin the gorgeous sanctuary of their intelligence, the occultist and Magusoften renounced their escapist indulgence in hermeticism. “With thesimultaneous return to nature, life, social action, and political engage-ment, it seemed that the entire vision of the world on which Decadentaesthetics had been based was quickly crumbling away.”35However, inLesFoulesdeLourdes, Huysmans illustrates the recon-ciliation of supernaturalism and social action. In the aftermath of hismeditation on spiritual naturalism, Huysmans had come to see thereality of the body of a suffering brother as more than a literary ques-tion. Whereas, the hyperacuity of subjective consciousness had beenthe pathology of the Decadent, the Catholic activist becomes aware ofothers’ actual afflictions. By repositioning teratology outside the vora-cious subject, Huysmans restores the possibility of dynamic interaction:between God and his creature, between sufferer and nurse, between anunhappy world and those who strive to improve it. The lupus-ravagedface, the muscle twitching from chorea are the interface where spiri-tualism and naturalism come together. In Lourdes, the monster’s bodyis where God is revealed as miracles and where miracles appear as thecharity Christ prescribes.First, naturalism cured the individual by making him indistinguish-able from everyone; then esotericism neutralized the threat of othersby elevating and insulating a quarantined self. After that, Huysmansintroduces a literature of the miraculous that changes one into many,takes the privileged hero and merges him with the crowd, restoring"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"The Miracle-Worker195the possibility of action, exchanging hopelessness for salvation. On theCross, flesh dies before the spirit is reborn. In Lourdes, there arises from“triumphal squalor” “the purest essence of charity.”LesFoulesdeLourdesmarks Huysmans’s abandonment of traditionalforms of naturalism, a normalizing ideology ratifying the tyranny of thecrowd. Yet it also signals a repudiation of occultism with its emphasison concealment, on esotericism with its suggestion of inwardness andself-direction. Redefining the relation between man and God, betweena human and his neighbor, the novel shows that the mystery of man’sspiritual being is solved by returning to “the sicknesses of the senses.”No longer transfixed by self-reflection, Huysmans’s narrator turns out-ward, in a movement etymologically suggested by the link betweenmirror and miracle – from self-contemplation to wonderment at God’sworks. No longer is the abnormal specimen a slave of fascinated intro-spection. Rather than constituting reality by training his gaze inward, hereveals the truth to others: “he displays it [il lamonstre], so to speak.”36The freak – no longer recognizable by his tentacle-like eye, by theworld-destroying absorption of his consciousness in itself – becomes themonstrous site where suffering is turned into solicitude. He is the placewhere one sees enacted the Christian principle ofagape, the requirementthat one’s brother be loved as oneself. The monster is the point whereplot stasis ends and where literature becomes an instrument of socialreparation. Toward the body of the sick, Huysmans redirects his look:toward the point where art and human kindness manifest God’s love asmiracles."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"ConclusionIn Jean Lorrain’s “Lanterne magique” (“Magic Lantern,”Histoires demasques[Stories of Masks] 1900), two blasé theatergoers are overhearddiscussing the aesthetics of supernaturalism during an intermission ofBerlioz’sSommeil de Faust(Faust’s Sleep). One character, proclaiminghimself a partisan of atmospheric Gothicism, deplores rationalism’smurder of sorceresses and fairies. Fantasy has been inhumed, he says,by clinicians and psychiatrists. Sylphs and dryads have given way towax automata from Hoffmann. Gone are tenebrous witches’ Sabbaths inthe cypress groves of cemeteries, replaced by the electrified rooms andwhitewashed corridors of hospitals. The wild-haired, undressed hystericson display at the Salpêtrière may be picturesque in their somnambulisticfixity, but Lorrain’s character admits to longing for “victims of demonicpossession, the nuns of Loudon, the convulsionaries of Saint-Médard.”Even the final bastion of romanticized insanity had been invaded byphysicians who had localized and cured madness – “and with whatmethods,” he exclaims, “with electricity and therapeutics!”1Conversations like these were commonplace in turn-of-the-centuryFrance as a struggle played out between medicine and miracles –between the majesty of the unexplainable and the reductive clarity ofdiagnostics. For Decadents and Symbolists, for artists and believers, thediscoveries of science did not map out a brighter future but only shrankthe world’s beauty to the cranial dimensions of the doctor.At first, this conflict between and reason and supernaturalism playedout in the domain of aesthetics, expressing “a reaction against the ten-dency of science to rob the world of poetry.”2According to the Positivistworldview advanced by Auguste Comte (1798–1857), humanity hadpassed though the theological and metaphysical phases in its intellec-tual development and then had reached maturity in the positive phase196"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Conclusion197when it had abandoned religion entirely. No longer crediting a supernat-ural agency for the phenomena he witnessed, man had ceased to lookfor causes and had limited himself to registering “observable facts.”Reacting against the aridity of this scientific vision, many fin-de-siècleartists sought to escape a reality they saw as impoverished by the dis-appearance of religion. Rejecting art robbed of Catholic pageantry, theywished to restore to their works the sublimity of the transcendental. Yetscience had done its damage, eliminating the simplicity of earlier beliefs.And so where there had once been belief, there was now just regret:“in the face of the disappearance of religious faith, the only feelingthat survived was nostalgia.”3As a result,Mysticismbecame a shibbo-leth for artists unhappy with materialism, and many literary characters,after the fashion of Huysmans’s des Esseintes, furnished their quarterswith sacred bric-a-brac, ciboria, ostensories, ornamental bibelots discon-nected from any religious application. It was not devotional asceticismthat fueled this orgy of iconographic piety, but what Huysmans refers toas “diminished sensuality.”Religious themes were also popular in the artwork of the era.As Camille Mauclair comments: “The Salons were overflowing with HolyWomen at the Tomb, with Calvaries, apparitions, and benedictions.It was a frightful consumption of missals and chasubles. Everywherethere were signs of faith, and the only thing missing was faith itself.”4Satanism, likewise, afforded a frisson of the supernatural, and the Deca-dent devil Huysmans celebrated in his encomium to Félicien Ropsconveyed an interest in evoking evil as titillating or dramatic.Yet while science was condemned for impoverishing art, it was praisedby fin-de-siècle occultists for allowing glimpses into extra-sensory reali-ties. The research on magnetism done by Charcot and his disciples at LaSalpêtrière lent scientific credibility to the seers who conducted séancesto contact the dead. Relying on scientific authorities like British scholarWilliam Crookes, occultists denied the dualism of soul and body, posit-ing a radiant state of matter perceivable on the astral plane to which themedium and the somnambulist enjoyed access. It was navigating thisboundary between the natural and supernatural that became the objec-tive of the hierophants, magicians, and hermeticists who proliferatedin the final turbulent decades of the century. Insisting on the empiri-cal legitimacy of his studies, the fin-de-siècle Magus stressed his kinshipwith the scientist, as both were said to circulate from the phenomenalworld of the senses, to the intellectual realm of thought, and into thedivine sphere of final causes.

While a stage magicianlike Robert Houdin could be dismissed as an illusionist or prestidigita-tor, whose power, as Houdin himself confessed, extended only to thetips of his fingers (The Secrets of Stage Conjuring1858), genuine Magilike Guaïta saw themselves as descendants of Trismegestius, keepers ofarcane wisdom from alchemy and the Kabbalah, secrets handed downfrom respected predecessors like Eliphas Lévi. Thus, in Guaïta’s open-ing chapter in his exposition of occult doctrine, he had sketched out ahistory of esotericism dating back to India and the cycle of Rama. Hispriestly lineage positioned Guaïta in an unbroken chain of adepts, fromMoses to Raymond Lulle, from Zoroaster to Fabre d’Olivet. Wishing todistinguish himself from vaudevillians who preyed upon the gullible,he deflected accusations that the Magus was a covert Satanist or necro-mancer. As Guaïta says, his goal is to rehabilitate “the noble Sciencethat has been cursed and misunderstood since the treasonous acts com-mitted by dissident Gnostics, that has been confused in the terrifiedimagination of the masses with impure Goetia, that has been decriedby spurious scholars, whose empty dreams and delirious scholasticismit undermines, that has been anathematized by a priesthood fallen intodisrepute since the time of its initiation.”6According his research an aura of seriousness and sobriety, the Magusworked in a private territory reserved for an aristocracy of knowledge-seekers. Thus, Guaïta comments on the fate reserved for dabblers anddilettantes, heedless tourists in the shadow realms of forbidden occultsecrets. There was an astrologer who killed himself to confirm theaccuracy of a horoscope, a spiritualist who went mad and died in sus-picious circumstances, Eliphas Lévi swept into a gyre of near-suicidalmelancholy.In nineteenth-century France, interest in the occult had flourishedin the poetry of Baudelaire and the fiction of Balzac, in novels likeLouis LambertandSéraphita, whose intrigues had been structured bythe mysticism of Swedenborg. By the end of the century, research inthe domain of psychiatry had lent an air of legitimacy to investigationsinto paranormal phenomena. Psychoanalysis, which would become sounreceptive to theories of the occult, was intimately associated withmagic as early as 1885, when Freud studied hypnosis under the auspices"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Conclusion199of Charcot. At that time, “Freud’s interest in the subject reflected thewidespread public fascination with mysterious states of mind, includ-ing somnambulism, catalepsy, nervous illness and the fragmentation ofpersonality.”7Only later, at the time of Freud’s falling out with Jung, didhe abandon his interest in magic and embrace “a material, mechanistictheory of scientific rationalism.”8In the 1880s, when interest in supernaturalism began to flourish,there was an attempt to establish a distinctive brand of magic differ-ent from theosophy as it had been popularized by Madame Blavatskyin England. While putatively syncretistic, theosophy had drawn onBuddhist and Hindu teachings, defining humanity’s evolutionary pathtoward universal brotherhood. Recurrent occult principles found intheosophic doctrine included the spiritualization of material bodiesordered by Septenaries or multiples of seven; rejection of the dualismof body/mind and matter/spirit; a belief that even the simplest physicalentities were endowed with rudimentary consciousness moving themirreversibly toward the absolute finality of enlightenment.Distinct from theosophy with its conspicuous Eastern influence,French occultism had been rooted in traditional Jewish mysticism andprivileged the hidden meaning of letter and number combinations.Such rearrangements of elements, as Papus writes in citing Eliphas Lévi,revealed the etymological link betweenTarotandTorah. In Papus’sLeTarot des Bohémiens, he had glossed over the visual symbolism of theArcana and, citing his predecessors, Saint-Martin, Court de Gébelin, andGuillaume Postel, had connected the 24 letters of the Hebrew alphabetto the major cards in the Tarot, claiming that the Tetragrammaton, thefour letters in the sacred name of God, were the key to unlocking alloccult secrets. It was this word,iod-hé-vau-hé, that was imprinted on theapex of official buildings, “that radiated out from the center of the flam-boyant triangle at the 33rd degree of the Masonic Scotch Rite, and thatwas displayed above the portals of our oldest cathedrals.”9While all initiatic practices frustrated the casual seeker, the numerol-ogy of Papus – like the clavicles in Guaïta – had been so freightedwith abstraction that transmission of knowledge was subordinated toopacity. Magic which, for the stage magician, had provided entertain-ment and illusion, was arrayed by Papus in robes of secrecy, adornedwith Rosicrucian symbolism, discouraging the importunate inquiries ofthe dilettante. Fin-de-siècle thaumaturgy, operating on two opposingplanes, amused the gullible and edified the adept. The “Bohémiens” towhom the Tarot’s wisdom was imparted possessed a bible containingthe most precious wisdom of antiquity, yet it also gave them a livelihood"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"200Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-sièclesince it was used in fortune-telling: “this Bible is an occasion of perpetualdistraction, for it allows them to play.”10It was only in later years that the fin-de-siècle tradition of occultteaching expanded beyond the sacerdotal caste of hierophants and sagesin order to embrace the principle of universal brotherhood that hadbeen advocated by theosophists. As the century approached its end,the Decadents’ emphasis on elitist isolation gave way to an emergingsense of political engagement. This was manifested in the supernaturalrealm as service to one’s brother, an abandonment of the exclusivity ofesotericism and the inexpressibility of mystic visions. Thus, in Villiersde l’Isle-Adam’sAxël(1885–6), the title character spurned magic as emo-tionless, inhuman, uncomforting, and cold. In Jules Bois, the Magus waspictured as impassive and self-involved. Alone in his white vestments,amidst his alembics and retorts, he had stood before an altar with a skullbearing the inscriptionEris sicut Deus.11It was in the fiction of Joséphin Péladan that one saw a re-humanization of the occultist, who changed from an impenetrable sageto a teacher and mentor. Seeking a re-consecration of Catholic dogma,disdaining the superciliousness of the master, Péladan’s characters hadexalted the sovereignty of God over the grandeur of the initiate.The imaginary Rosicrucian brotherhood that was assembled inPéladan’s fiction, the Société de la Rose+Croix that he established inreal life sought the reformation of a church whose leadership structurehad become ossified, dissemination of a higher art redeemed of its sec-ular vulgarity, edification of humanity by works of inspirational genius.Certainly, Péladan never lost his air of superiority and hauteur, nevergave up his eccentric dress or his ornate, bombastic style. But while thearisteswhom Péladan cultivated were, etymologically,the best,theirtaskwas to lift up humanity through the nobility of their example.Péladan’s hero, the Magus Mérodack, deplored the modern conceit ofprogress: “Mediocreis the word for our time and our race. For Westernman, an electric doorbell constitutes a new stage of civilization, and theavailability of hot water heat creates a hierarchy among peoples.”12Of course, there was a reactionary quality to Péladan’s misoneisttechnophobia: his hatred for democracy, his contempt for faddish-ness and gadgetry. But even in Mérodack’s effort to re-construct theAlbigensian Abbey of Montségur – a Gnostic institution ruled by mysticasceticism – he had acknowledged the contribution of the spirituallyenlightened and had defined their task as using magic on behalf ofhumanity. Péladan’s conception of latria combined the idea of serviceand worship, so while still boasting of his Chaldean ancestry and artistic"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Conclusion201pedigree, he came down from the mountain on which his fortress wasbuilt in order to pass among the people with whom his wisdom wouldbe shared. As Mérodack had said to his Rosicrucian brethren: “We loveGod; we believe in salvation; we bear witness to the light; in us, concernfor our neighbor alternates with a cult of the abstract.”13In the domain of magic, the governing principle had been the exclu-sivity of the discipline, the exceptional wisdom of the initiate urgedto be inimitable and sublime. Exceptionality is the sovereign good, asPéladan had written of the Magus: “the more one is solitary, the morehe is himself,ipsissimus.”14By contrast, the Satanic frenzy that grippedfin-de-siècle France was fueled by perceived threats to identity, a fear ofaliens and outsiders. While the world of the Decadent Magus had beenone of narcissistic solitude – unpopulated except for the chilly com-pany of the illuminati – the paranoid realm of the fin-de-siècle Satanistteemed with toxic bacilli, pullulated with malevolent larvae like thoseBois describes attacking Saint Francesca of Rome: biting, licking, shriek-ing, breaking furniture, emitting the stench of the corpse she was fatedto become. Rare are those who are high enough or exceptional enoughto resemble us. Many are those who, by embodying our disavowed vices,are projected as the accursed other.Whereas turn-of-the-century white magic moved toward coalescencewith one’s neighbor, devil worship was often motivated by a hor-ror of the stranger. In an era witnessing widespread institutionaldestabilization – secularism’s attack on the church, democracy’s under-mining of social hierarchy, subversion of long-standing belief systems –change once considered as cultural happenstance became disquietinglytransmogrified, endowed with malevolent intention, attributed to infer-nal enemies. Freud’s identification of theUnheimlichdescribed it as whatwas both unrecognizable and familiar, alien in the same way as one’sreflection in a mirror. As Hawthorne had written more than a centuryearlier: “The fiend in his own shape is less hideous than when he ragesin the breast of man.”15In Huysmans’sLà-bas, the devil’s journey had described his unsettlingapproach: from the Middle Ages, out of the subterranean slaughter-dungeon of Gilles de Rais, into the present day, to sanctuaries inthe nearby neighborhoods of Paris. Defamiliarized, distorted, Satanwas the one who inevitably came back. He is “nothing else than thepersonification of the repressed unconscious instinctual life.”16Xenophobia and anti-Semitism had become more pronounced in thefin de siècle, as France had become polarized in the aftermath of Dreyfus.Edouard Drumont, inLa Libre Parole, propagated the most virulent forms"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"202Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-siècleof bigotry, opposing a romanticized vision of France’s pastoral historyto its rootless, capitalistic present. Portable wealth controlled by Jewshad caused a disintegration of national identity, yet evil was mani-fested by the very multiplicity of one’s adversaries: bankers, Protestants,Freemasons, Republicans, all conspiring with the Jews in their schemesof world conquest.Fin-de-siècle supernaturalism had hinged on this dialectical exchange:between an exalted self and a hated other, between familiarity andestrangement. The most terrifying Satan was the one most closelyresembling the subject, the reflection he disavowed, the brother hedisinherited. Thus, at the turn of the century, the infiltration of theFallen One into contemporary life had blurred the clarity of establishedtaxonomies, inverting moral antipodes, confusing metaphysical adver-saries. From the narcissism of the occult master and his delirium ofimaginary emulation, one moved to the paranoia of the demonophobedrowning in an ocean of alien malevolence. Unlike magic, predicatedon the grandeur of a self that enveloped admiring others, the fear ofLucifer had been fueled by fears of sameness. How can we recognizeour antagonist and be prepared to fight against him if Satanists, Jews,and Freemasons are identical to us? The saturation of space with impsand larvae corresponded to this projection of the multiplication of oth-ers. The Magus had stood alone and filled the astral light with hisuniqueness, while the Satan-fighter was embattled by evil Doppelgänger.Retreating into the fortress of his ethnicity, faith, and caste, the enemyof Satan had been as isolated as the thaumaturge. Protected by prayersand counter-spells, he was similarly defended by precautionary xeno-phobia. Unlike the devout who worshipped God, the Satanist enlistedthe devil to come and serve him. Listen to his promises, as Jules Boiswrites in hisEvocation du Diable[Evocation of the Devil]: “Ask me, andI will make a naked girl dance for you. Beat urine, and I will make itthunder and hail. With magnetic powder strewn on braziers, I unleashearthquakes and lightening. I cure hemorrhoids and scabies. I bestowtreasure and prevent suffering.”17In a universe where God is sovereign,there is infinite transcendence. In a microcosm where the devil serves,space is shrunk to the dimensions of one’s desires.In the Decadent mirror-box of ipseity, where only the ego had beenbeautiful, the Devil relinquished his grandeur at the same time that theself became idealized. In Durtal’s view of the medieval world, wheremystery was uncompromised by science, Satan was unseen and hispower appeared immeasurable.

In the fin de siècle,Satanism was just another vice like showgirls or roulette.The virtue of Léo Taxil’s magnificent fin-de-siècle hoax – his creationof the imaginary worldwide Luciferian cult of Palladism – had beento operate on dual registers. To the worldly intellectual, for whom thedevil offered entertainment, Taxil’s global narrative of far-flung Masoniclodges housing Satanic orgies afforded a diversion whose anti-hero wasas amusingly wicked as themselves. To the Catholic reactionary, forwhom science was a force of metaphysical evil, a Satanic confeder-ation of Freemasons and Jews resurrected a worthy adversary whosestature was as great as the church crusader who fought them. Taxil’smystification proposed the devil as joke and bugbear, inciting theVatican to join in a cosmic clash of good against evil, pleasing jadedreaders with serialized stories of adventures with Asmodeus. In Taxil,Satan was the Prince of Darkness and a ridiculous anachronism, anightmare from which one awakened feeling foolish for believing it.The Decadents who mourned a devil greater than the banality of theirperversions longed for some cause to serve, some entity to adore. Taxil’simposture had spread the theater of metaphysical warfare across theglobe. Anglophones and Semites, nymphomaniacs and Asians formedan alliance of aliens threatening Judeo-Christian westernism. But then,like the prestidigitator who explains how his sleight of hand worked,Taxil had confessed to his deception, and the theater had gone dark.There was nothing more to fear than the embarrassment of having beenduped.While those fearful of the devil had retreated into a fortress filledwith those resembling them and believing as they did – while theMagus had withdrawn to the mountaintop castle of his disdainfulsuperiority – the mystic had also undergone indescribable experiencesalone. Like the Magus, whose arcane knowledge precluded its beingshared with the uninitiated, the mystic was plunged into an ineffablysolitary dissolution in the divine. The autism of the mystic’s rapturessurpassed the lexicon of the common people, just as the wisdom of thehermeticist was communicable only in numbers and symbols.Yet what distinguished fin-de-siècle literature of the transcendentalwas its radical inversion of superiority and abjection. Péladan’s Magushad still been affiliated with an aristocracy of intelligence; Papus hadstill denigrated the poverty of the seminarian’s education. But the anti-intellectualism triggered by the idolatry of science was accompanied byan overthrow of traditional virtues and ideals.

Indescribable in speech, the mystic’s fusion with the Lord affordeda community of seekers no opportunity to participate. Yet unlike theMagus, sequestered in the stronghold of his secrecy, the mystic hadaimed at reconnection with another, acquiescing to humility as the pricepaid for love.In the tidal sweep of Eugène Vintras’s homiletic rhetoric, there hadbeen Biblical execrations of the pomp and pageantry of Roman Masses,jeremiads against the Pope and his assertions of infallibility, denun-ciations of a church drunk with opulence and power. However, thepopularity of Vintras’s teachings had come from their glorification of thedowntrodden, their elevation of visionary women, their championingof the poor as members of Christ’s crucified body.Vintras’sGlaive sur Romehad begun by deploring the mercantilismof the church. As Jesus told the prophet: “I was sold for money; I washated, tormented, and persecuted because of gold.”18When Jesus hadbeen hungry, the clergy had strewn diadems on altars; when he wasnaked, priests had dressed themselves in “all the sumptuous things ofthe world.”19Vintras’s elevation of the poor foreshadowed the apotheo-sizing of the peasant girls to whom the Virgin had appeared – BernadetteSoubirous in Lourdes and Mélanie Calvat in La Salette – reinforcingthe fin-de-siècle ideal of naïveté and simplicity. In the generation fol-lowing Vintras, culture and erudition became spiritual impediments,filtering out what, for the unlettered, was a direct apprehension ofthe divine. This glorification of poverty, analphabetism, and guile-lessness had joined in a dialectic in which self-forgetfulness broughtremembrance of God.Among the reactionary Catholics examined here, the celebration ofthe forsaken, the rejection of reason and the invocation of ignoranceas a virtue had been accompanied by an honoring of women seen asintuitive and visionary, as humble conduits of the divine. Thus, the fin-de-siècle rehabilitation of Eve as a precursor of Mary had been part of aredefinition of women, first as sinners, then as saviors.In Vintras’s church, women had been raised to positions of authority;spreading the Marian gospel, they were voices of fin-de-siècle mysticism.Yet countering the image of the Virgin as nurturer and intercessor wasthe reactionary view of her as the Mater Dolorosa. Richard Burton notes"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Conclusion205the preference among certain fin-de-siècle Catholics for the Virgin ofLa Salette, whose message was threatening and ominous, to the Virginwho appeared in Lourdes, promising forgiveness, cures, and comfort.According to Huysmans, the inaccessibility of La Salette had tested pil-grims’ resoluteness. “But physical remoteness was not the sole reasonfor setting La Salette above Lourdes. To the extent that the Virgin’s mes-sage at Lourdes was in essence one of healing and love, it could [...]be reconciled not just with existing society with its visceral ‘hatred ofPain’ but also with the will to existence itself, the sheer animal instinctto live and to be, whence the site’s huge popularity with the mass of‘ordinary’ life-loving, pain- and death-fearing Catholics. But when theVirgin spoke to Mélanie and Maximin on the mountain, she seemed tobe opposed toeverything: to society as it is, to the contemporary Church,to reason, to the body, and, ultimately, to existence itself.”20For Léon Bloy, reverence for Mary as the One Who Weeps – “Celle quipleure” – had expressed a recognition of women’s value as the source ofpain’s secretions: the sacred blood and holy tears that washed away thestain of sin, drowning the world in a new Flood of angry lamentation,undoing a flawed creation before the forthcoming apocalypse and theworld’s resurrection in the reign of the Holy Spirit. For Bloy, Eve’s trans-gression had caused man’s expulsion from the Garden, and so Mary’sgood offices had been necessary for him to re-enter paradise. In Bloy’swritings, Eve and Mary wept eternally – from remorse for the first sin,out of compassion for the sinner. The disobedience of man’s motherhad necessitated intervention by Christ’s mother, so that Eve and Maryfunctionally became complementary halves of a single whole.However, in the economy of Dolorism, the trespasser’s sin entailedthe victim’s punishment, as the debt of human guilt was liquidated bythe Crucifixion of the one offended. All man’s efforts, all the world’ssuffering intended a return to the beginning, restoration of a state ofinnocence, a welcoming back to Eden, whence the idealization amongfin-de-siècle Catholic mystics of the innocence of childhood.Analysis of the theology of fin-de-siècle Catholic reactionaries showstheir revalorizing women’s roles in a revolutionary fashion. By yield-ing to the temptation to eat the forbidden fruit of knowledge, Adamand Eve had been banished to a world in which knowledge itself hadcaused unhappiness. It was not concupiscence butlibido sciendithat hadbrought about the Fall, exile to a barren place like the realm of scientificreason.God’s punishment of the first man had been a requirement that hework: “cursed is the ground because of you; in toil shall you eat of it all"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"206Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-sièclethe days of your life” (Genesis 3. 17). To Eve God had announced thather labor would be similarly painful: “I will greatly multiply your painin childbearing; in pain shall you bring forth children” (Genesis 3. 16).The spiritual aesthetic of authors like Bloy and Hello had been to prac-tice art as its undoing. Writers toiled, and women suffered so that theirguilt might be expunged, cleansing them so that no new books and nonew children would be engendered. The Great Work of human historyhad been an act of cancellation: the Passion endured on Calvary so thatoriginal sin was washed away. In order to participate in the ongoing taskof man’s redemption, the pain assumed by Christ had to be undergoneby women whose child was sorrow conceived and born of love.Women were no longer seen as anatomically disadvantaged. Rather,these authors exhibited a kind of suffering-envy, a desire to experiencetorments culminating in the delivery, not of an artwork, but a Messiah.Eve’s guilt was the precondition for the fecundity of Mary, who wasproleptically absolved of sin, accorded an Immaculate Conception, asshe bore the child who saved man from his wretched exile on the earth.The Mother of humanity, Mary cried for man’s iniquity, and her sadnessextended the childbirth pain that had been visited on Eve. The Virgin’stears were like Christ’s blood in washing away the stain of history: “TheHoly Virgin’s Compassion was the Passion in its most terrible form.”21Yet the end of the world had not come, and the human race hadkept on living, committing new atrocities, raising the rate of increaseon sin as debt. New martyrs had been required to balance the ledgerwith their bleeding wounds and weeping eyes, so that the sum of whatwas owed could return again to zero. In the apocalyptic mentality of thefin-de-siècle mystics – in the Third Age of the Paraclete whose adventVintras promised – the bride of Christ who joined with him in the con-summation of self-sacrifice would give birth to the innocence whichthey represented as nothing.Inevitably, fin-de-siècle mysticism had begotten a literature of silence,as unsustainable, peak states had fallen outside the realm of fiction,condemned, like life, to continue in a world of bodies, loss, andcompromise.Essentially, mystical literature belonged to an aristocracy of art, inwhich even authors and their audiences could not take part in the trans-ports of the character. As the Magus was alone with the insignia of hisgenius, possessing wisdom encrypted in an idiolect of the enlightened,Christ’s betrothed also betrayed a form of “selfishness between two peo-ple,” enjoying an unsurpassable experience unamenable to the languageof the tribe.

In the final volume of Péladan’sEthopée,La Vertu suprême, Mérodack’s brothers at Montségur had been urged toadopt the principles of the Albigensians: denial of the Incarnation, arenunciation of the flesh, a desire to rejoin God in the Uncreated Light.The end point of the Dolorist’s mission, after securing the deliverance ofsouls from Purgatory, had been to reward the sufferer with the death thatrepatriated her in heaven. Huysmans’s Lydwine had quit a shell that wasalready crucified and broken, and had risen to meet the Bridegroom in ascene of indescribable bliss. Bloy’s heroine, Clotilde Chapuis, awaited asimilar liberation, an end to separation in the Gehenna of her lonelinesson earth. The rapture these women anticipated came from what Denisde Rougemont calls Eros or Endless Death, disappearance into the nightthat preceded Creation.But when Guaïta had described descending the ladder from the firma-ment to the world – when Péladan’s Magus had chosen to impart hisoccult knowledge to a novice – there was a reintegration into the world,an affirmation of solidarity with the other. From the Thanatotic liter-ature of mystical asceticism came a pastoral art recommending serviceto our brothers here below. As Rougemont writes: “to love is no longerto flee and persistently to reject the act of love. Love now still beginsbeyond death, but from that beyond it returns to life. And in being thusconverted, love brings forth ourneighbor.”22In its final stages, fin-de-siècle supernaturalism rejected an art ofhypersubjectivity, abandoning the Decadentculte du moiin favor ofcooperative effort and self-sacrifice. The literature of the transcenden-tal became a vehicle for “morality,” which Jean Pierrot identifies withthe final years of the nineteenth century. “Everything changed after1898. Intellectuals recognized their solidarity with a society on whichthey acted; they felt responsible for its future and integrated into itsdestiny.”23In Huysmans’sLesFoulesdeLourdes, suffering had motivated ser-vice, and the privileged subject had made way for the unfortunate hehoped to solace. Poverty was no longer cultivated as self-eradicatingmysticism – as the disposal of material goods and a detachment from theego – and miracle-workers became those committed to comforting their"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"208Satanism, Magic and Mysticism in Fin-de-sièclebrothers. By dedicating themselves to life and work, they exchangedEros for Agape or Christian Love.The final fin-de-siècle staging ground for manifestations of the super-natural ceased to be the Christ-flooded consciousness of martyrs whosepain had turned to joy and instead became the fallen world described asa prison house or hospital. There, refugees and patients awaited succoror release, and they were helped, not by saints who writhed in silence ontheir beds, but by volunteers whose calling was to comfort and assuage.“Suffering with,” they expressed compassion as an interactive practicerather than as solitary prayer.For Huysmans, in a world normally governed by pleasure-seeking andself-interest, the presence of wealthy women working as attendants tothe crippled and bath attendants to the stricken was the surest proof ofthe miraculous. The Virgin’s presence was felt less strongly in the brokenwho were made whole than in the actions of an army of caregivers curedof their customary apathy. In Lourdes, Huysmans – once a member of anaristocracy of aesthetes – observed the operation of a will to well-beingthat was democratically expressed. No longer crucified with Jesus, thefaithful did the work of Christ by dedicating themselves to pain’s abate-ment. Miracles, no longer witnessed in the flamboyance of theophanies,were evident in the ordinariness of selfless deeds done with humility.How far fin-de-siècle thinking had come by the time of Huysmans’swriting – from the chamber of the Magus, with its directive to becomelike God, to Lourdes’s helpers who worked in sickrooms where the privi-leged mingled with the forsaken. The new century saw a rejection of theinwardness of mystic thinking. It marked an end of the occult tendencytoward exclusivity and secrecy: assignment of numerological values tothe Arcana of the Tarot, enclosure of spagyrical science in impene-trable symbols. The etiolated recluse who had poured over grimoiresin his sanctuary had been dragged out, as Camille Mauclair writes,“into the violent, sacred sun, into the magnificence of life, away fromnostalgia and self-reflection.”24Even before the outbreak of the GreatWar, France had been re-politicized, the anarchist movement had beeninfused with new energy, religious introversion had been abandoned.Adolphe Retté had inveighed against the “final avatar” of Christianitywith its “mystical corruption” – responsible, he claims, for France’s“morbid state of mind.”25But even before the century ended with the obsolescence of Deca-dent aesthetics – not with the glorious apocalypse that many hadanticipated – the supernatural had relocated from the occultist’s brainto the world of action.

In Huysmans, Satan had been exposedas the prideful self that one adored. In Taxil, devil religion had beenrevealed as ethnocentric paranoia. The Catholic mystics who once pro-claimed the sanctity of women suffering for souls in Purgatory notonly honored the poor as the crucified members of Christ’s body, butalso sought to implement Christ’s teaching by comforting the afflicted.No longer was the burning of souls in hell or the conflagration of saintsin God an indescribable drama playing out in the theater of the afterlife.Instead, the blessed assisted people condemned to hell on earth: victimsof elephantiasis, chorea, and lupus, the hydrocephalics who stormedLourdes’ flaming grotto with their prayers. God’s servants no longeraspired to a solitary marriage with their Redeemer but joined in a com-mitment to the service of humanity. I act in memory of Christ whenI perform the occult act of self-transcendence. Not martyrdom for me:God’s work on earth for you."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"NotesIntroduction1.
