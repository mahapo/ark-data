It describesdaily ritual activities of the people of these Pagan times and how theyexperienced the dangers and evil spirits of the world they lived in. Some of themagical rituals were quite bizarre while others may be of value for living intoday’s world. Pennick compares the customs and rituals of a wide range ofcultures across Europe and beyond, as well as across time, tracing theirorigins, similarities, and differences. The book is well researched, wellorganized, and a valuable and impressive resource for understanding thespiritual journeying of our ancestors.”NICHOLAS E. BRINK, PH.D., AUTHOR OF BALDR’S MAGIC:THE POWER OF NORSE SHAMANISM AND ECSTATIC TRANCEAND BEOWULF’S ECSTATIC TRANCE MAGIC“Whether we call it magic or folklore (or even superstition), the traditional,often pre-Christian knowledge described in Pagan Magic of the Northern Traditionis fascinating. I’ve been referring to Pennick’s books for years when I need afact or an example of some interesting early magic to cite in my books andblogs. I learned something new on every page!”BARBARA ARDINGER, PH.D., AUTHOR OFPAGAN EVERY DAY AND SECRET LIVES“Magic was a part of everyday life for our Pagan ancestors, a spiritual approachto the environment used by everyone and embedded in all the practical skills ofliving, from farming and building to music and healing. Nigel Pennick shows usthat it is a tradition that still flourishes and rewards us in the modernworld.”ANNA FRANKLIN, AUTHOR OFTHE SACRED CIRCLE TAROT,PAGAN RITUAL, AND HEARTH WITCH“Nigel Pennick’s book offers a well-documented overview of everyday magic, thelast recourse against all evils. It introduces us to a strange Pagan worldhaunted by spirits and supernatural owners of nature and rehabilitates thestudies of magic as an important part of our common cultural heritage.

It has often been ignored by historians,who, not believing in its efficacy or even recognizing that in the past manypeople did believe, thereby have dismissed any belief in it as beneath mention.Alternatively, when they have mentioned magic and the occult sciences, they havebeen portrayed as worthless superstition, or irredeemably diabolical and evil,unspeakable rites to be shunned because they might taint the reader. But topresent magic as a dangerous subject that ought to be censored lest it seducethe reader into criminality is unhelpful, for it pushes students of magicalhistory into a ghetto when students of human depravity and violence, such ascrime and war, are welcome in the mainstream. Magic played a significant part inshaping people’s lives. Magic is an integral part of our cultural heritage,ancient skills, and wisdom that are a perennial response to universal situationsand problems. Unraveling the history of an undocumented tradition in adefinitive way is impossible. The only way to understand the themes embedded inthe fragments is to take notice of historic parallels and examples, and drawconclusions from them."},{"pageContent":"IntroductionNorthern Magic MAGIC AND RELIGIONThe traditional worldview is practical, consisting of what works or what isperceived to work. Ancient Pagan religions in Europe were concerned with ritesand ceremonies; there was neither creed nor essential doctrines. All members ofthe family, clan, tribe, or nation participated in ritual activities, but beliefwas not demanded of the participants. There was no orthodoxy, and no heresy;participation was all that was required. In premodern times, life wasunimaginably hard by the twenty-first-century standards of developed countries.People were reliant on agriculture, herds and flocks, hunting and fishing. Therewere no effective remedies for disorders, diseases, or epidemics of humans orlivestock. Crop failures brought frequent famine; peasants often lived ingrinding poverty at the edge of starvation. If a hurricane or flood occurred,there was no backup to rescue survivors, who had to get by as well as theycould, having lost everything. Traveling was difficult, and wayfarers andvoyagers ran the risk of attack by wild animals, robber barons, bandits,outlaws, or pirates, or dying crossing rivers and or in storms at sea. At home,there was always the risk of attack by marauding bands of fighting men, bringingrape, torture, death, or enslavement to those who could not resist or flee.Numberless diseases, disorders, and ailments beset the people, and their onlyrecourse for a remedy was to practitioners of traditional medicine. Magic was anindivisible part of the craft of wise men and women as well as professionaldoctors. In such a fragile environment, people needed wisdom and skill tosurvive and flourish.Magic practiced by the common people in pre-Christian times was part of everydayculture. It was embedded in the practical skills of everyday living. As in allparts of traditional society, there were specialists. Those in the handicraftsincluded smiths, wrights, carpenters, shoemakers, and other skilled workers whomade things necessary for living, and there were also practitioners ofherbalism, medicine, and divination whose arts were heavily on the magical side.But all of these arts and crafts had no theory; functionality was the operativecriterion. They may have had origin-stories and mythical founders, but theory issomething different, the arcane pursuit of philosophers and theologians. TheChristian church, unlike traditional Pagan observance, insisted on belief instories and doctrines that it asserted were essential to the afterlife. Beliefin doctrines became confused with the practice of ethics. It was asserted thatone could not be an ethical person unless one believed everything the churchdemanded. The northern Pagan point of view, however, is expressed in the OldNorse poem Hávamál (The Words of the High One), attributed to Odin. Hávamáldescribes desirable and undesirable behavior in terms of mannvit (common sense)and óvítr (foolishness). Behavior is defined as either skilled or unskilledbehavior, and the outcome of unskilled activities is social: loss of face,ridicule, and outlawry. The concept of eternal damnation is not part of this wayof understanding. One’s personal belief or disbelief does not matter, so long asone is a good citizen.image [../images/00004.jpeg]Fig. 1.1. Celtic stone image, Echterdingen, Germany.A SHORT HISTORY OF NORTHERN PAGANISMThe history of indigenous religion in northern Europe provides some explanationof the context of traditional magic over the last sixteen hundred years. Fromwhat we can determine of ancient northern European religion, there was nodistinct barrier between gods and lesser spiritual beings. The early religion ofthe northern peoples appears to have been centered not on an abstract universaldeity, but upon the veneration of a divine ancestor and the natural forces ofthe world. The king’s ancestor was also the tribal god, and this principle wasmaintained among the Angles and Saxons in England. Seven out of the eightAnglo-Saxon royal genealogies descended from Woden, as did the royal line ofSweden. Ancestral holy places including homesteads, grave mounds, andbattlefields were venerated as places where the ancestral spirits remained.Folk-Moots, the forerunner of parliaments, were held on moot-hills, some ofwhich were the burial mounds of ancestors, whose spirits were invoked incollective decision making. The ancestors also played an important role in theeveryday worship of the common people. There were goddesses similar to the Norsedísir, a collective of female ancestral spirits honored as guardians of aparticular tribe, clan, family, or individual. Local cults venerated local godsand goddesses, and Roman influence led to the construction of temples to housetheir images and cult paraphernalia. In parts of northern Europe taken into theEmpire, the gods and goddesses of local religious cults were taken over by thepriesthoods of similar Roman deities under the intepretatio Romana. The Romanshonored the spirit of each place with altars to the genius loci.image [../images/00005.jpeg]Fig. 1.2. Roman altar to Jupiter, Juno, and the genius loci. Bad Cannstatt,Germany.Egyptian and Persian deities like Isis and Mithras were also worshipped in Romancities in the north, such as London and York. Astrology and various forms ofmagic were embedded in everyday culture.The Roman Empire was made officially Christian in 313 CE, and soon afterwardPagans were persecuted, their temples were appropriated or destroyed, and theirtreasuries were looted. But in northern Europe, in Britain on the fringes of theEmpire, and outside the Empire, ancestral observances continued. For example, aJupiter column was erected in Cirencester by the Roman governor Lucius Septimiusin the late fourth century, a major Pagan sacred structure set up fifty yearsafter the supposed destruction of the temples. In 410 CE the Roman army waswithdrawn, and that part of Britain was taken over by the Anglo-Saxons in thefollowing decades. Germanic Paganism arrived with them. Pagan worship was notstatic; new cults arose and were refined, and new temples were erected at thesame time that the minutiae of Christian doctrines were being decided upon inchurch councils in the remains of the Roman Empire, which by then had ceased tohave control over western Europe. For example, in Old Prussia, the temple atNadruva (Romuva) enshrining the trinity of Patrimpas, Perkūnas, and Patolas wasset up in the fifth or sixth century (Trinkūnas 1999, 148–49).The Christian religion became dominant in Celtic parts of Great Britain whilethe Anglo-Saxons were still Pagan. Ireland was Christianized by St. Patrick (ca.389–ca. 461 CE), and remnants of Christianity from the late Roman Empire mayhave been the spur for Celtic Christian missionaries from Ireland and Wales tothe Anglo-Saxons and the Picts in Caledonia (later called Scotland) and later oninto Germanic parts of mainland Europe. Missionaries sent by Rome from 597 CEonward came to England and converted some of the kings, who then imposed thereligion on their subjects. The wars of this period in England were not foughton religious lines between Christian and Pagan as simplified histories claim.The most stalwart Pagan king of the period, Penda of Mercia (died 655), foughtagainst the Christian kings of Northumbria, but Penda’s allies were not Pagansbut forces of the Christian king of Wales, Caedwal II. The last part of Englandto remain worshipping the old gods officially was Sussex, whose king Arwald(died 686) was the last Pagan king in Britain.Ireland and Britain became a center of Christian expansionism. The NorthumbrianChristian monk Willibrord was sent to Frisia in the 690s to suppress localworship. This was part of the eastward expansion of the Christian FrankishEmpire, a process that continued for centuries. In Saxony at the presentObermarsberg was a shrine with a very tall sacred pole called Irminsul, “theuniversal pillar.” It was destroyed by the forces of the Emperor Charlemagne inthe year 772 during a crusade against the Saxons. The shrines of the god Fosite,on the holy island of Heligoland, were destroyed in the year 785. Bishopricswere set up in fortified towns in Pagan territory as centers for colonizationand religious expansion. In 831–834, Hamburg became a bishop’s residence, andfurther outposts in the east were established. Poland was set up as a Catholicstate between 962 and 992 by Prince Mieszco I. Between this state andChristianized Saxony was Pagan territory, where the Slav inhabitants stronglyresisted missionaries and colonists. Now divided between Poland and Germany,Pomerania possessed several large and finely constructed timber Pagan temples,many located on defended islands in navigable rivers. A Christian state wasestablished there in Pomerania in 1047 under Gottschalk, but he and the Bishopof Mecklenburg were killed in a rebellion in 1066.In the Viking Age, major temples of the Nordic gods stood at Jelling in Denmark;Sigtuna and Gamla Uppsala in Sweden; Mæri, Lade, Skiringssal, Trondenes, andVatnsdal in Norway; Kialarnes in Iceland; and at Dublin in Ireland. The templeat Retra was destroyed in 1068, and the one in Uppsala around 1080–1100. TheSlavonic shrines and temples were destroyed by German and Danish expansionduring the eleventh and twelfth centuries and the Nordic temples through theconversion to Christianity of the indigenous ruling elites. A proclamation of1108 by the bishops and overlords of Saxony called for Christian volunteers todestroy the “abominable people” and take for themselves the best land in whichto live (Fisher 1936, 203–5). The Pomeranian temples were destroyed by BishopOtto of Bamberg between 1124 and 1128, and the country was officiallyChristianized in the latter year. The temples at Brandenburg were demolished in1136, but the god Triglav was still being worshipped by Slavs and Saxons therein 1153. In the Baltic was the holy island of Rügen with a number of Pagantemples, the largest of which was dedicated to the god Svantovit. The temples,which had been defended by three hundred dedicated men at arms, fell to aDanish-German crusade in 1168–69, after the death of their patron, Duke Nyklot.On the Baltic shore, Old Prussia was another late stronghold of Paganism, wherein 997 Bishop Adalbert of Prague died in a failed attempt to evangelize theinhabitants. Christianity was extirpated from Old Prussia in 1009, when theleading cleric Bruno of Magdeburg was killed. In 1200 a crusade led by BishopAlbert of Bremen led to the foundation of the city of Riga, and in 1202 amilitary order, the Fratres Militiae Christi (fraternity of the soldiers ofChrist), better known as the Schwertbrüderorden (Sword Brothers Order, orKnights of the Sword), was established to impose Christianity by force. In 1225they were reinforced by knights of the Teutonic Order, which had been founded atAcre in Palestine in 1190. Having been expelled from Transylvania by the PaganKumans, the Teutonic knights were sent by the pope to Prussia to colonize theBaltic lands for themselves as a religious-military state called the Ordenstaat.The Knights of the Sword were defeated in battle by Pagan Lithuanian forces atthe Battle of Schaule (Saule) in 1236, but in 1260 all inhabitants of theOrdenstaat were compelled by the Teutonic knights to swear allegiance to theChristian religion. This led to a war of genocide against the Sambian nation ofOld Prussians, who refused to give up their religion. By 1283 the Teutoniccrusade had devastated Old Prussia. Its inhabitants had been massacred or forcedto flee as refugees. The Ordenstaat continued in existence until 1525. As aresponse to Christian pressure from the west and Islamic pressure from thesouth, the Lithuanian king Mindaugas set up state Paganism in 1251 as a means tounify the nation and resist colonization. In 1259 the Knights of the Swordattempted to take over Samogitia (lowland Lithuania) but were defeated again. In1343, Estonian resistance against Danish colonists was manifested in the Paganrebellion of Jüriöö Mäss (St. George’s Night, April 22/23) when all the churchesand manors were destroyed and the Christian priests slain. Afterward, theTeutonic knights were sent in to kill the rebels. The Grand Duchy of Lithuaniaremained Pagan until 1387, while Samogitia came under the control of theCatholic Church only in 1414. In Lapland (Finland), church persecution of SÃ¡miPagan practices went on sporadically between 1389 and 1603, and a noid (shaman)was burnt alive with his drum at Arjeplog as late as 1693 (Jones and Pennick1995, 167–73; 178–79). At the far eastern edge of Europe, in Russia, indigenousPagan practices were never fully extirpated, and continue today in unbrokentradition. Although numerous indigenous religions of Europe were persecuted todestruction, beliefs, concepts, themes, and practices that were present couldnot all be utterly obliterated. They continued as forbidden practices, and inthe customs and traditions of farmers, craftspeople, and in folk medicine.image [../images/00006.jpeg]Fig. 1.3. Christianized megalith at Trébeurden, Brittany, France. Commercialpostcard ca. 1890. The Library of the European TraditionMAGIC AND THE CHURCHOnce it had suppressed Pagan worship, the church claimed a monopoly on spiritualactivities. It asserted that only ordained clergymen were permitted to deal withspiritual matters, and that meant that anyone else who made use of spiritualtechnologies was a criminal. Extending this, it was claimed that anyone who wasnot a priest who used magic, whether for good or ill, was being empowered by thedevil. Dualistic belief in an evil god as an equal opponent of a good one hadnot existed in Pagan times. Those who practiced traditional magic that hadoriginated before Christianization were accused of witchcraft, as the churchclerics imagined their powers came from the old gods, who in the eyes of thechurch could only be seen as agents of the devil. Witches, imaginary or real,were labeled as deviants and transgressors, people whose way of life lay outsideacceptable norms. They were viewed as part of an evil conspiracy determined todestroy society. In an era when a particular worldview was the only permittedreality, pluralistic realism—the possibility that numerous equally authentictruths can coexist—was not an option. Religious orthodoxy was enforced withdraconian rigor and horrendous punishments. But because elements ofpre-Christian lore and magic are present in recorded witchcraft practices andspells, certain writers have claimed wrongly that the whole body of historicwitchcraft practice is Pagan. Many, if not most, recorded spells of healing andcursing especially drew strongly from Christian sources, sometimes from themainstream Bible and occasionally from apocryphal sources (Davies 1996, 29).In a feudal society that was based on well-defined classes and ranks, there werebasically two kinds of magical practitioner: those who had an education in amonastery or university and those of a lower class who were part of a folktradition. Clearly, the distinctions were blurred, and similar magical knowledgeand theory was used in both traditions. It is recorded that some Christian monksand priests collected magical texts, and certain monasteries became well knownfor them. For example, the Icelandic “black books” called Rauðskinni (Redskin)and Gráskinni (Grayskin) were kept in the monastery library at Hólar. The formertitle was connected with Bishop Gottskálk Niklásson in the early sixteenthcentury. It appears to have contained magical lore from both the classical andrunic traditions. In Germany a famous grimoire was attributed to thethirteenth-century cleric Albertus Magnus, and Abbot Johannes Trithemius(1462–1516), a contemporary of Niklásson, wrote around 70 works, many on magic,including Veterum sophorum sigilla et imagines magicae, an influential text ontalismanic and image magic. The German renaissance magi Heinrich CorneliusAgrippa (1486–1535) and Paracelsus (Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastusvon Hohenheim, 1493–1541) were students of the master magician Abbot Trithemius,and their works remain in print today. In addition to incantations, medicalrecipes, and magical formulae, these published works contained sigils and signsthat were part of the repertoire of craftspeople. They are still in use.In his 1621 work The Anatomy of Melancholy, Robert Burton expressed all thefears that people of his time had of magicians and witches, and the awesomepowers they were alleged to possess. In the chapter titled “Of Witches andMagicians, How They Cause Melancholy,” he wrote:Many subdivisions there are, & many several species of Sorcerers, Witches,Enchanters, Charmers, and so forth. They have been tolerated heretofore some ofthem; and Magick hath been publickly professed in former times, in Salamanca,Cracovia, and other places, though after censured by several Universities, andnow generally contradicted, though practiced by some still . . . that which theycan do, is as much almost as the Devil himself, who is still ready to satisfytheir desires. . . . They can cause tempests, storms, which is familiarlypracticed by Witches in Norway, Ireland, as I have proved. They can make friendsenemies, and enemies friends, by philtres . . . enforce love, tell any man wherehis friends are, about what employed, though in the most remote places; and, ifthey will, bring their sweethearts to them by night, upon a goat’s back flyingin the air . . . hurt and infect men and beasts, vines, corn, cattle, plants,make women abortive, not to conceive, barren, men and woman unapt and unable,married and unmarried, fifty several ways . . . make men victorious, fortunate,eloquent . . . they can make stick-frees, such as shall endure a rapier’s point,musket shot, and never be wounded . . . they can walk in fiery furnaces, makemen feel no pain on the rack or feel any other tortures; they can staunch blood,represent dead men’s shapes, alter and turn themselves and others into severalforms at their pleasures. (Burton 1621, I, ii, I, sub. III)Although written in the early seventeenth century, Burton’s account reassertsearlier writings about the fearful power ascribed to magic. These beliefs arenot yet dead."},{"pageContent":"1The Web of Wyrd and the Eldritch WorldIt is a human trait to see patterns in all things. According to the spiritualworldview, these patterns are manifestations of a cosmic order. We can discernpatterns everywhere we care to look, and our being in the world is determined bythese patterns, symbolically described in our ancient myths that tell of thecoming-into-being of the world. Two of the most ancient human handicrafts areweaving and pottery, and in ancient scriptures, both of them are used asmetaphors for the human condition. The ancient bards perceived the multipleinterwoven strands of experience symbolically to be a textile woven by thepowers they called fate. The crafts of spinning and weaving are the heart of ourlinguistically embedded understanding of our being, for our existence isenvisaged as a part of a universal interwoven pattern, known in the northerntradition as the Web of Wyrd.THE WEB OF WYRDThe Web of Wyrd interconnects everything there ever was, is, or will be; allpeople, things, and events are conceived as being patterns woven in the web.Wyrd is an Old English word derived from weorðan, which means “to become,” “tocome into being,” or “to come to pass.” A related Old High German word, wurt,similarly has its basis in a verb, werdan, meaning “to become” or “to come topass.” It related to the Latin verb vertere, “to turn,” and in the context ofWyrd, this means how events turn out. Another related Old High German word iswirtel, “a spindle,” the tool used in spinning thread from raw fibers. Fortuneand destiny are part of weaving in the Old English word gewæf, as in the text“me thæt wyrd gewæf,” “Wyrd wove me that”—that is my lot, or fate, in life. Forthe individual, Wyrd is his or her “lot in life,” position in the world, withall its limitations and possibilities, a state of being often referred to asone’s destiny or fate. But Wyrd is not the concept of fate as something thatpredestines us to undergo unavoidable happenings that somehow have been writtenin advance. The contemporary usage of the words “fate” and “destiny” containsideas of unavoidable predestination, but our Wyrd does not necessarily doom usto a particular fate. Yet we are where we are. The Scots expression, “Let usdree our weird” exhorts us to accept where we are and use it for the best. Theworst position in life is to be a “weirdless person.” Someone who is weirdlesshas no purpose in life and never prospers, and weirdlessness denotes doingthings in the wrong way and thereby failing at every chance.The Web of Wyrd is an ever-changing process, likened to a woven fabric,constantly being added to and constantly disintegrating. In the EuropeanTradition, the processes that shape events are personified as the Fates, who arethree sisters. In ancient Greece, they were the Moirae in White Raiment; inRoman Paganism, the Three Fates; in the northern tradition they are the Norns;and in the English and Scottish tradition, the Weird Sisters. In ancient Greece,the three Moirae were viewed by the Orphics symbolically as the visible phasesof the moon: the first, Clotho, is the waxing First Quarter; the middle one,Lachesis, the Full Moon; and the last, Atropos, the waning Last Quarter. Clothospins the thread; Lachesis measures it out, deciding in which way it will beused; and Atropos, “the Fury with abhorred shears,” cuts it. Whatever they arecalled in the different traditions, they are personified as three women involvedin the processes of spinning and handling yarn. The first signifies thebeginning that is the past; the second the formative, creative process ofexistence, which is the present; and the third, destruction, which is thefuture.image [../images/00007.jpeg]Fig. 1.1. The Three Fates, architectural feature at Castell Coch, Tongwynlais,Wales (William Burges ca. 1880).The actual physical craft of spinning is significant in this mythos, as itclearly relates to the visible apparent rotation of the starry sky at night. Theimage of the rotating spindle and the turning millstone is a reflection of thepassing of time and the outcome of events. Many northern European words to dowith the development of events and the creation of materials are related to theact of turning round. The Scots word for a wheel or a whirlwind (tornado) istrendle, and the English word trend, which describes how things are developing,is related to this. A physical phenomenon called the “windings of the stars” ismentioned by H. C. Agrippa in the early sixteenth century in his Three Books ofOccult Philosophy: the obliquity of the Earth’s axis as it progresses on itsorbit around the sun gives the path of the stars and planets an apparent windingmotion likened to the winding of a ball of yarn (Agrippa 1993 [1531], II,XXXIV).The names of the Norns are redolent of meanings embedded deep within ourlanguage. In the Northern Tradition the Norns’ names are Urða (That Which Was);Verðandi (That Which Is); and Skuld (That Which Is To Become). Here, the threadis not just spun, measured and cut, but woven into a fabric (the web) beforebeing destroyed. The warp or throw of the woven fabric of the Web of Wyrd isviewed as time and events, whilst the weft is composed of individual human actswithin time. As the process of weaving the web continues, the pattern ofinteractions of the threads, which are lives and events, irreversibly comestogether to exist for a while before again being torn apart. Skuld personifiesthe forces of dissolution. She cuts the individual thread or shears apart theintricate weavings. She represents the inevitable end of all things, theannihilation of present existence. The Norns sit at a well; it is necessary towet the fiber of flax with water in order to spin them into a thread.In the English and Scottish tradition, the Weird Sisters appear under thatcollective name, but their individual names are lost. William Shakespeareborrowed them from Raphael Holinshed’s tale of Macbeth and transformed them intothe fateful Three Witches.Their names have been reconstructed from Old English literary evidence as Wyrd,Weorthend (or Metod), and Sculd (Branston 1957, 71). They are the Old HighGerman sceffarin (female shapers who determine the shape of things to come). Theshapers mete out our fate, the Old Saxon metod, “destiny, doom, death,” and sowe are subject to metodogiscapu, “the decree of fate” or “the shaping ofdestiny.” Another term in Old Norse for one’s fate is sköp, which literallymeans “what is shaped.” The web is not a reality, but a metaphor that gives ussome limited understanding of the way things happen.image [../images/00008.jpeg]Fig. 1.2. The Weird Sisters, from the history of Macbeth, from RaphaelHolinshed’s Chronicles. The Library of the European TraditionThe seamless textile is the prime emblem of the Web of Wyrd, symbolized intraditional dress, whole fabric uncut and unfitted, but gathered or smocked tofit the wearer. For existence is not composed of an assemblage of separatemoments, but it is a seamless flow of process, the threads of which are as butcurrents in a river, tides in a sea, or the blowing of the winds. The Web ofWyrd is a symbolic description of the reality in which we live. Wyrd embodiesthe fundamental structures and processes that manifest themselves continually asrecognizable elements of the physical world. These principles can revealthemselves spontaneously or may be identified by human intelligence. Traditionalspirituality recognizes them as divine principles that operate throughout thecosmos, embodying everything that exists and has ever existed. In this sense,the visible world is an emanation of the invisible. The true principles of Wyrdare often viewed as the signature of divinity.Like a piece of fabric already woven, Wyrd is something that cannot be alteredor undone. But either we can be passive and allow the vagaries of life to defeatus or we can deal creatively with the situation in which we find ourselves. Wyrdweaves our place in life, and an old saying from the Borders of Scotland andEngland expresses creative acceptance of our situation: “Let us dree our weird”;that is, let us endure whatever becomes of us and make the best of it. It tellsus that once we stop complaining and accept our Wyrd, we can turn itsdisadvantages into our advantages. We are within our given circumstances, livingin our own time, and must endure their accompanying difficulties, but how weendure them and how we deal with our circumstances is up to us.Wyrd works like natural magic and science: all things that come to individualsare neither rewards nor punishments sent by the gods, but they are theinevitable consequences of events, affected by the actions of individuals andthe collective. But whatever happens to us spiritually is the result of how wereact to the conditions in which we find ourselves, for we have free will andchoice of how to act within our circumstances. Even the gods are not outsideWyrd, but subject to it, like we are. This is clear from original texts fromboth Northern Paganism and traditional Anglo-Saxon Christianity. As an OldEnglish gnomic verse in one of the Cotton Manuscripts tells us: “The glories ofChrist are great: Wyrd is strongest of all.” Medieval Christian images of theAnnunciation—for example, a fifth-century mosaic at Ravenna, Italy, and aninth-century stone panel at Hoveningham, Yorkshire, England—show Our Ladyspinning with spindle in hand, with a (woven) wickerwork basket containing woolbeside her. This is the motif of the first Weird Sister, signifying beginning;in this case, the conception of Jesus. Our Lady is also depicted handling threadas Maria Knotenlöserin, “Mary the Unraveller of Knots,” in a baroque painting inthe church of St. Peter-am-Perlach in Augsburg, Germany. The church stands onthe site of the temple of the Swabian goddess Zisa (Pennick 2002a, 107–10).Whether the concept of the Knotenlöserin was ascribed to the goddess is notrecorded. Knotted threads and cords are certainly a major element in magicalpractice in northern Europe, used in warding off harm, stopping bleeding,binding illnesses, and bringing winds to sailors.ØRLÖG: CHANCE AND FATEOur existence is not fixed, but part of a process. Nothing exists without comingfrom somewhere. Every aspect of material existence now is the result of whatpreceded it in time. The sum of all of the events that led to the presentexistence of anything is called its ørlög, an Old Norse concept meaning both“primal laws” and “primal layers.” That which has already been woven by theNorns, even if it has been torn apart in the past, is that which came before thepresent pattern of existence, so it has influenced it profoundly. Ørlög is morethan just the processes of nature, or the record of history, for it includes allof the factors that go to make up the present time. Each human person has his orher own ørlög. Personal ørlög includes genetic, individual, family, andcollective history and every other factor that has made the individual what heor she is. There is no escape from ørlög, for we cannot alter what has alreadyhappened or the circumstances that come from it. Everyone’s ørlög alsoaccumulates as we get older; it is the sum of everything that we do, where weare, and the circumstantial events affecting our lives. The individual’s ørlöggives us both our possibilities in life, and also determines their limits.Because of this, ørlög is sometimes confused with destiny or fate, a force thatis seen to favor some individuals and to destroy others.In the Roman worldview, the goddess Fortuna presided over what would now becalled random events. She is still invoked now by gamblers, who call upon LadyLuck in the hope of winning games of chance. Her emblem is the Wheel of Fortune.The concept of mathematically calculable randomness did not exist in ancientreligious systems. Every event was ascribed to supernatural agency—either to aparticular deity like Fortuna, or to an omnipotent creator. Religions thatbelieved in an omnipotent and omniscient god claimed that everything thathappened was under the god’s direct control. The Anglo-Saxon king Alfred theGreat stated that there was no such thing as chance, everything being due to theactions of God. In this worldview, nothing can happen without the god’sinvolvement. God’s will is in control of everything from the course of theplanets to the weather on Earth. This concept has the consequence thateverything that happens must be preordained, fated to happen. Every event andhappening has been decided in advance by divine edict and cannot be changed.Randomness is not part of this deterministic belief system, as King Alfredstated. However, the mathematical principles of randomness, discovered after theRenaissance, still apply to divination even when the divinatory system is from abelief system that has no concept of randomness.Of all forms of divination, dice have a strange position between the sacred andprofane uses. The tumbling dice, though random and only predictable in the longrun through the laws of statistics, produce a real and immediate outcome. Whengiven human significance, the points facing the thrower can bring fortune orruin. The random becomes determinate immediately the dice roll to a halt. Whenthe dice are at rest, the success or failure of the prediction is apparent atonce. Fate and doom can be decided on the roll of a die, and the saying “dicingwith death” emphasizes this reality. Ancient Roman dice terminology was relatedto the twelvefold division of the world, as expressed in weights and measures.The German word for a die, Wurfel, has the connotation “to throw” (the verbwerfen), linking their workings with the “throw” of the weave of Wyrd’s web.Willard Fiske, in his Chess in Iceland (1905), remarks:Among the adherents to old Germanic mythology Wotan (Odin) was regarded as theinventor of dice. But on the introduction of Christianity several old attributesand spheres of activity were transferred to the spirits of evil, and thus thedevil, at a later day, came to be regarded as the originator of dice. He wassupposed to have created them for the purpose of gaining souls for his infernalkingdom. (Fiske 1905, 248–49)The English word “fate” is derived from fatum, the past participle of the Latinfari, “to speak.” The Fates are those who speak about what shall become of us.The Old Icelandic poem Völuspá (The Sybil’s Vision) recounts of the Norns thatthey “staves did cut, laws did they make, lives did they choose: for thechildren of men they marked their fates.” The Norns’ name is also interpreted asthose who speak, being related to the Middle English verb nurnen, which means“to say.” The Norns’ utterances or decrees are described in Old English aswyrdstafas “wyrd-staves” and can appear in the form of writing, the staves.Staves can mean both runic characters and the wooden staves upon which they arecut, the runestaves being cut upon a runestaff. There is an oblique reference toweaving and knowledge in the poem Vafþrúðnismál (The Lay of Vafþrúðnir) whereOdin has a riddling contest against the giant Vafþrúðnir, whose name means “themighty weaver.” The poem contains prophetic riddles that deal with the nature ofthe gods, giants, and humans and their relations: the nature of the Web of Wyrd.The runes are fundamental to understanding something of the weavings of the Webof Wyrd and our place within it. When we use the runes, we can penetrate thesurface of outward appearances, and enter the realm of consciousness thatperceives the basic unity of life that is the Web of Wyrd. Even in the everydayprosaic use of characters to represent sounds and numbers, we penetrate some ofthe mysteries that lie at the foundations of existence. At the basic level, theindividual runes are various patterns that occur within the Web of Wyrd andserve as gateways for the consciousness to grasp the nature of these patterns.The alphabetic glyphs or signs that we call runes are what appear in the mindwhen the word “rune” is heard. But a rune is much more than just a letter in analphabet. In addition to possessing symbolic meaning—whether as an alphabeticletter, an ideogram, or a symbol representing something—it can also mean a song,a poem, an incantation, or an invocation having talismanic power.The meaning of the word rune itself is a “mystery” or “deliberation,” as in theOld English word rún, the Old Norse rún, and the Middle Welsh word rhin.Similarly, the word rún in modern Irish (Gaeilge) means “secret” and“intention.” But it is a secret in written or spoken form that is not understoodby everyone, as in the Scots verb roon and modern German raunen, both meaning“to whisper,” and in a common English idiom, a “rounder” is a whisperer, aperson who uses barely audible, secretive speech. Within the simple letter,composed of a few lines, lies a great deal more than its surface appearance. Atits basic level, a rune denotes a mystery; that is, something secret andotherworldly, something that is more than just an unknown meaning for a personwho is illiterate or uninterested. Each rune stave is a unit of embedded lore, astorehouse of knowledge and meaning within human consciousness. According to thenorthern worldview, the interconnections of the nerve pathways in the humanbrain are an obvious aspect of the Web of Wyrd. As a symbol, a rune denotes aformless and eternal reality that is rooted in the world as we experience it.THE DIVINE HARMONYTraditional cosmology is a symbolic way of describing the earth and the heavenswe perceive to be above us. Above the earth are nine spheres defined by theapparent courses of the planets, the moon, the sun, and the stars. The differentplanetary spheres correspond to various aspects of existence: they are ruled bythe nine Muses; they correspond to metals and the colors used in Anglo-Normanheraldry, and likewise to the notes of the musical octave. The relationshipbetween different spheres is that of numerical proportions discovered originallyby Pythagoras (ca. 500 BCE), which are the basis of the Western diatonic musicalscale. In 1650 Athanasius Kircher wrote in Musurgia universalis, “The ancientphilosophers asserted that the world consisted of a perfect harmony, that is,from the earth to the starry heavens is a perfect Octave.” Hence thesingle-stringed musical instrument devised by Pythagoras, the Monochord, is animage of the Cosmos, as Robert Fludd wrote in 1617: “The Monochord is theinternal principle, which, from the center of the whole, brings about theharmony of all life in the Cosmos.”Whatever means of division we use, there is the recognition that all are presentsimultaneously. In his 1642 essay Religio Medici, the English philosopher SirThomas Browne (1605–1682) used the example of the seasons and the earth toexplain this principle: “whatsoever sign the sun possesseth, those four seasonsare actually present. It is the nature of this luminary to distinguish theseveral seasons of the year; all which it makes at one time in the whole earth,and successive in any part thereof” (Browne 1862, 47). Thus the parts areinextricable components of the whole. Only in modern thought do the parts becomeseparated in a reductionist and fragmental way, and used in isolation from oneanother without consideration for their place in the totality.The Greek alchemical text the Anonymus, expressing ideas current in the thirdand fourth centuries CE, places the origin of the four elements in the MysticalEgg of the alchemists, which is the Seed of Pythagoras. The author was followingthe traditional Greek coming-into-being symbolism of the Orphic religion,expressed by Aristophanes in his play The Birds. The unknown author of theAnonymus notes that the four elements are also present in music, because thereare four main harmonies, and the basic row, the tetrachord, is composed of fourelemental tones. These concepts gradually entered the north and became embeddedin magical understanding. In the second century CE, Theon of Smyrna pointed outhow the four main harmonies of the diatonic scale, the preserve of the Muses,combine the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 as the Musical Tetraktys. The four harmonicratios are the fourth (4:3), the fifth (3:2), the octave (2:1), and the doubleoctave (4:1). There are six possible tetrachords: Aëchos, Isos, Katharos,Kentros, Paraëchos, and Plagios. Three are ascending scales, three (Aëchos,Isos, and Plagios) descending. Combined, these make twenty-four musical elements(that can be related to the twenty-four characters of the Greek alphabet and thenorthern runes). By combining these in proper ways, all forms of music—thebenedictions, hymns, revelations, and other parts of Orthodox Church music—weremade. There are limitless possibilities of combination. In all its complexity ofendless realignments, changing relationships, and new harmonies, the “music ofthe spheres” reflects the limitless combinations of the elements that allow themultiplicities of the existent world to have their being.image [../images/00009.jpeg]Fig. 1.3. Celestial monochord made by Russell Paddon, designed and painted byNigel Pennick, 2013.THE TRADITIONAL VIEW OF THE COSMOSimage [../images/00002.jpeg]Symbolism of the MillA link between the weird sisters and mills appears in medieval laws that bannedwomen with spindles or distaffs from coming near mills. The stones that grindflour in a mill can be understood as an image of the cosmos where the skyrotates above a fixed earth as the upper millstone turns on the lower one. Theoriginal mills were querns, handmills where an upper stone driven by handrotated upon a lower, stationary stone. The first powered mills in northernEurope were watermills built directly over watercourses. An axletree fitted withpaddles dipped into the running water below the mill, and fixed to it was theupper stone. The lower stone has a hole in the middle to allow the axletree torotate. So the upper stone turned against the lower stone to grind the graininto flour. There were no separate waterwheels or transmission gears to drivethe stones, as in later, more sophisticated water mills.Symbolically, the oldest form of water mill structure reflected the tripartitecosmos in the Northern Tradition interpretation: underworldly water (worldserpent flowing, Utgard); fixed earth (lower millstone, Midgard); upper stoneturning (starry heavens, Asgard). The turning but fixed axletree (the world-treeYggdrassil) rotates around a fixed point, the Pole Star. The poetic fragment bySnæbjorn in Snorri Sturluson’s Skaldskaparmál tells of nine skerry maidensturning a mill that is a kenning for the churning waves of the sea being cutthrough by the prow of a ship. Amloði’s mill has been interpreted as an earthlycounterpart of the celestial mill that grinds the meal of the strewn stars(Jones 1991b, 4). Amloði is identified with William Shakespeare’s Hamlet (ca.1602), and the Bard gives the First Player of the play-withina-play thefollowing lines, which connect it with the Wheel of Fortune:Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods, In general synod, take away herpower; Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel, And bowl the round navedown the hill of heaven, As low as to the fiends! (Shakespeare, Hamlet, II: 2).The millstones themselves were ascribed magical powers. Old millstones were usedto block places where evil might enter, being laid in the gateways ofchurchyards and the entrances to places of the dead. Broken into four, they wereused as foundations of the four corners of the house (Garrad 1989, 110).THE MODES, THE PLANETARY SPHERES, AND THEIR HARMONYThe seven modes of ancient European music reflect an ancient recognition of thiscosmic harmony. It appears to have originated in the speculations of the Greekphilosopher Anaximander, who suggested that the heavenly bodies are carriedaround the earth on a series of concentric spheres. It is this system to whichPlato refers. Although two thousand years later, European scientists, mostnotably Copernicus, determined that the earth is a planet in orbit around thesun, and not the center of the cosmos, the model created by Anaximander is stilla valid spiritual metaphor that had a profound influence all over Europe.Credited to Pythagoras, who elaborated the ideas of Anaximander, the system ofthe octave was worked upon by later Gnostic researchers who used the conceptknown as the Ogdoas. In this eightfold system, the cosmos is ruled by sevendeities who in turn were under the rulership of the Supreme One. In the ancienttreatise On Style, conventionally ascribed to Demetrius Phalereus, we find, “InEgypt also the priests venerate the gods through the seven vowels, letting themsound one after the other, and instead of the aulos and the lyre, it is thesound of the letters that is heard harmoniously.” Through the sound of thevowels, properly invoked under the correct liturgical conditions, materialexistence could be transformed to spirit. These sounds are the pure notes thatPlato puts in the mouths of the Sirens.The Neopythagorean philosopher Nichomachus of Gerasa reinforced this conceptwhen he commented that the planetary spheres each produce their own particulartones, each of which is reflected in a corresponding vowel in the Greeklanguage. According to Nichomachus, the vowel α reflects the sphere of the moonand the mode called Nete. The sphere of Mercury is expressed by the vowel ε andthe tone Paranete. The vowel η sounds the sphere of Venus, the tone Tritesynemmenon. The vowel ι reflects the sphere of the sun, with the tone of Mese.The vowel o relates to the planetary sphere of Mars and the tone of Lichanos.Vowel υ recalls Jupiter and Parhypate, whilst ω signifies Saturn and Hypate(Nichomachus 1994).In Greek culture there were no separate characters for numbers, and the lettersof the alphabet thus had numerical equivalents. Anyone who learned to readabsorbed these numbers along with the meaning of the letters. As a result Greekculture—unlike ours, in which Roman letters and Arabic numerals have noconnection—had an integral symbolic understanding of the relationship of nameand number. Concepts such as that the Creator had brought matter into being bythe utterance of a word, and that number is the underlying structure ofexistence, which to modern culture seem separate and irreconcilable, wereintegrated in this worldview. Belief in the power of the word is fundamental toreligion and magic alike. Gnostic papyri contain numerous incantations thatbegin or end with the seven Greek vowels in differing combinations. One textgives an invocation that encapsulates a magical theory: “Thy name, made up ofseven letters, according to the harmony of the seven tones, whose sound is madeaccording to the twenty-eight lights of the Moon, Saraphara, Araphara,Braarmarapha, Abraach, Pertaomech, Akmech, Iao – ouee – iao – oue – eiou – aeo –eeou – eeou – Iao.” The numbers seven and eight are an integral part of thisspiritual current. The Greek alphabet, having twenty-four characters, is dividedinto three ogdoads, or groups of eight, each of which has a ruling letter and isthus structured 1 + 7. In common with Greek practice, the twenty-four runes ofthe Common Germanic fuþark are also divided into three ogdoads, called by theirNorse name, ættir. Identically with the Greek alphabet, each ætt is ruled by thefirst rune of the group, the ogdoad of α (alpha) being the first group of eightin Greek and the ætt of fehu being the first in the runes.The Gnostic magical text known as Moses’ Book of the Great Name (in the PapyrusMagicus Leyden W) tells of the godly power contained in the name of the Ogdoas:“Present in it is the supreme name, that is Ogdoas, who commands and controlsthe whole: the angels are obedient to Him, the archangels, the demons anddemonesses and all that is within creation.” The use of the musical modes ininitiation is recorded in this papyrus. Apotropaic and invocational music basedupon the octaval system operates by recreating the vibrations of the divinename; that is, the Music of the Spheres. The modes of the Pagan philosophers arereckoned from the highest note downward, signifying, as it were, the descent ofspirit into matter with the heavenly spheres. The Orthodox Christianity of theEastern Roman Empire, the inheritor of this Greek Pagan philosophy, reckoned thesame modes from the lowest note upward, seemingly signifying the ascent of hymnsfrom the earth to heaven. The Byzantine system used the same notes, calling themthe echoi (singular, echos).Around the beginning of the sixth century CE, a monophysite monk named Severusof Antioch wrote a series of hymns for the Common of the Seasons (a cycle ofrituals pertaining to the particular liturgical seasons of the Orthodox Church),using the Oktoëchos system. These hymns are sung on a series of eight Sundays ina different echos, beginning with the lowest mode. The first Sunday’s hymn is inthe first mode, the second in the second, the third in the third, and so on,through the octave. The whole Oktoëchos is based upon the Pentecontade Calendarthat uses a series of seven weeks and a day as the basic unit. The year is builtup from seven of these Pentecontades plus fourteen intercalary days. Thus thehymns of a particular day reflect their place in time. Each one is a proper partof a greater sequence that reflects its corresponding place in the greaterdivine harmony of the cosmos. With the correct enactment of a ritual thatreflects the cosmic order, the participants themselves become part of thatorder, thereby transcending their own finite individuality. It is a means ofbecoming one with the cosmos, thereby taking communion with the infinite."},{"pageContent":"2Traditional Operative Magic, Philosophy, and TheoryThe traditional way of viewing the world describes the principles that rule itin simple terms. Processes are usually described as having a threefold nature,most simply apparent in the sequence: beginning—continuance—end. Existentrealities, such as matter and planar space, are understood in a fourfold way.The four directions divide the plane of the Earth’s surface, while the fourseasons divide the year. The fourfold division of the world into the cardinaldirections and their subdivisions is discussed further in the next chapter.The Greek philosopher Pythagoras (ca. 500 BCE) taught the significance of thedivine numerical series 1, 2, 3, 4 as the creative power of the cosmos.Pythagoreans described existence by means of the Tetraktys, put in visible formas a triangle composed of ten points, arranged from the top down, 1, 2, 3, 4. Ofthe various forms of Tetraktys, the fourth composes the four elements, and theeighth, the Intelligible Tetraktys, the four faculties of the human being: (1)intelligence and mind; (2) knowledge; (3) opinion; and (4) sensation.The oldest surviving description of the tetrad of principles known as the fourelements comes from Empedocles in his text On Nature (ca. 445 BCE). The divisionof the matter of the world into four symbolic elements is the basis for thetraditional Western understanding of the subtle nature of the human body. Withinthe Cosmos, the individual natures of things, both nonliving and living, can bedescribed by means of these four principles: Earth, Water, Air, and Fire.The four elements are thus a description of the nature of the material world.They exist within the matrix of the physical structure of the world, thedimensions, which Pythagoras classified into four parts: (1) the seed orstarting point; (2) height; (3) depth; and (4) thickness or solidity. Thistetrad is the archetype of all growing things and things that are made by meansof the human arts and crafts.In the European tradition, the subtle component of the human body is composed offour humors. These are blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile. As symbolic(rather than physical) bodily fluids, they correspond with the four elements.Thus, blood corresponds with air; phlegm signifies water; black bile relates toearth; and yellow bile to fire. This tetrad of humors is a metaphorical way todescribe the active qualities present in the bodies of all living beings. Theyare not the same as the Intelligible Tetraktys of Pythagoras, which is concernedwith the function of consciousness, being bodily. But they have a profoundeffect upon the consciousness, nevertheless. According to the ancient Greekconcept known as Perisomata, the relative proportions of each of the four humorsin any one being produce or describe that individual’s personal temperament. Theword “temperament” literally describes the outcome of the combination of humorstempering one another. The principle of Temperance, as one of the Four Virtues,refers to this kind of tempering. According to this symbolic viewpoint, anindividual’s bodily strength, along with that almost undefinable quality ofhealth, is determined by a particular combination of humors. Imbalances of thehumors lead not only to bodily disorders, but to psychological ones as well.In his The Nature of Man, Polybius defines health as being the state in whichthe four humors are in the correct proportion to one another, both in strengthand quantity. They must also be mixed together well enough. Whenever there is adeficiency or an excess of one or more of the humors, or the mixing isinsufficient, then a certain disorder results. When the humors are in harmonywith one another, according to the basic nature of the individual’sconstitution, then there is balance, and she or he is therefore healthy. TheMuses play their part in the creation of good humor, for traditionally music hasbeen seen as a means of restoring balance of the humors. Temperance, the art ofbalancing the humors, is a health-bringing technique. The commonplace expression“being in a good humor” refers to this ancient concept.The northern tradition views bodily powers as consisting of two separate butlinked qualities: might and main. Might (Old English meaht; Old Norse máttr) isthe physical strength of the body, the energy within it that enables it to live,powering its movements and actions. Main (Old English mægen; Old Norse megin) isthe inner psychological strength that empowers the personality; it istransferable to other people and to objects. In Old Norse tradition, megin(main) is described in terms of who or what possesses it. The earth has jarðarmegin; the gods possess ásmegin. When a magician empowers something with megin,it becomes aukinn, “augmented.” A god or person with his or her own megin canalso be aukinn with megin from elsewhere. The god Heimdall, for example,possessed ásmegin but was also aukinn with jarðar megin. Anything to be madeaukinn must have an empowerment that aligns with the object or person’s innatequalities. If something is empowered contrary to its nature, it still worksmagically, but there is an inner conflict, as the empowerment is álag, an“on-lay.”Without main, might is useless, for main includes the will to live. It is mainthat enables a person to exert his or her will in all realms of life. Itempowers the magical arts of the human being. We must have both might and mainin order to live effectively. Without one or the other, we are close to death.Inner power corresponds with outer powers, by means of being in the right placeat the right time to achieve what is needful. This is shown, for instance, inthe English martial arts, whose Four Grounds of effective action are defined asjudgment, distance, time, and place (Brown 1997, 94). To be successful in combatrequires a perfect combination of these factors. Equally, the performance ofmagic requires recognition of the Four Grounds. The inner human power of mightand main must be balanced properly with external powers. When both are inalignment, then the human is at one with the cosmos. To maintain thisequilibrium is a constant task.Old Norse concepts from pre-Christian times do not have overt references to thetheory of the four humors, but traces of the Intelligible Tetraktys theory arepresent. Önd, the breath of life, equivalent to the Greek pneuma, is synonymouswith human existence. Every person begins life by drawing a first breath. It isthe cry of the newborn baby. Regular breathing measures out our lifespan, and atdeath we literally expire by breathing out our last breath. Birth is thus themoment of the first breathing-in, and death, the last breathing-out. Between, weare alive, breathing. The traditional worldview envisages the human breath oflife as a reflection of a greater whole, the universal Cosmic Breath that ispresent everywhere. Every individual possesses a mind; that is, a rationalfaculty dependent on consciousness and personality. The mind operates onphysical, psychological, and mystical levels. According to these traditionalconcepts, our powers of perception, reflection, thought, memory, and inspirationare all aspects of the cosmic breath, and magic is worked through theindividual’s portion of these powers.As in the Pythagorean system, there are a number of specific named qualitiesthat make up the human being. Litr is health, and læti is the power of movement.Hugr is consciousness, intelligence, and willpower (intelligence and mind). Hamris personal ability to control and shape images and events. Hamramr is theability to shape-shift; for example, into animal form as Odin and the berserkwarriors were said to do. A person changed into another form is a hamhleypa, andtraveling in another form (out-of-the-body travel or soul-flight) is hamfarir.Hamingja is luck and the ability to take advantage of appropriate circumstances.The northern tradition worldview tells that luck is a personal possession; thereare instances from former times that interpret luck in this way. Magnates andheroes were able to bestow their hamingja upon other persons as favors in orderto accomplish tasks that would be impossible without magical assistance. Becauseit is a personal possession, hamingja must be nurtured, for it can also be lostor stolen. The old Irish adage, “There is no money that cannot be stolen”applies also to luck.Soul-flight is the shamanic practice noted two thousand years ago by Romanauthors and in the north as hamfarir in the thirteenth-century Ynglingasagawhere Odin “changed his form; the body lay there as if heavy with sleep or dead,but he himself was in the form of a bird or beast, fish or worm, and went in aninstant on his own or another’s errand to distant countries.” This account isalmost identical to the Roman accounts of Hermontinus of Clazomenae by Plutarchin On the Sign of Socrates and in works by Pliny and Tertullian. Hermontinusleft his body and wandered into distant countries, from where he brought backaccounts of things that could not be known unless he had been there. Like Odin,Hermontinus lay apparently lifeless while his soul was out of the body. His wifebetrayed him to the Cantharidae, his enemies, who burned his body while he wasin soul-flight. H. C. Agrippa noted in 1531 that even in his day in Norway andLappland were very many people who could “abstract themselves three days fromtheir bodies.” When they returned, they could tell people of things they hadseen far away. No other living creature or person should touch the body while insoul-flight; otherwise the person could not return to the body (Agrippa 1993[1531], III, I).According to Norse belief, every individual has a fylgja (attendant or fetch;plural: fylgjur). The fylgja is present throughout the person’s life, but it canalso leave the body and put on a new shape. Powerful warriors and kings had“strong” fylgjur, which preceded them everywhere. Fylgjur of magnates and heroescould actually be seen by people with second sight. To see one’s own fylgja wasan omen of impending death. Fylgjur could also appear in animal form, the beastbeing related to the individual’s character. When Christian beliefs became thenorm, the fylgja became the guardian angel. This is overtly recorded in the taleof Hall, who allowed the Christian missionary Thangbrand to baptize him oncondition that the archangel Michael should be his fylgja. The later concept ofthe fylgja in English outside the guardian angel is the wraith, from the OldNorse vörðr, “ward, guardian.”Celtic tradition is recorded in medieval Breton, Welsh, Irish, and some ScotsGaelic texts. Christianity arrived much earlier in Celtic Britain and Irelandthan in Scandinavia, so what may be older concepts are expressed differentlyfrom the Germanic and Norse personal powers and spirits. The physical andspiritual Eight Parts of Man and Twelve Parts of the Body appear in Welshtradition in the medieval Book of Llanrwst, ascribed to the sixth-century CEbard Taliesin. The eight parts are: (1) earth, inert and heavy, the flesh; (2)stones, hardness, the bones; (3) water, moist and cold, the blood; (4) salt,briny and sharp, the nerves; (5) air, the breath; (6) the sun, clear and bright,the heat of the body; (7) spirit, soul and life; and (8) divinity, theintellect. There are also twelve parts of the body that relate to abilities,emotions, and powers: (1) the forehead, sense and intellect; (2) the nape of theneck, memory; (3) the top of the head (pate), discretion and reason; (4) thebreast, lust; (5) the heart, love; (6) bile, anger and wrath; (7) the lungs,breath; (8) the spleen, joyousness; (9) the blood, the body; (10) the liver,heat; (11) spirit, the mind; and (12) the soul, faith.THE SYMBOLISM OF THE PARTS OF THE BODYA symbol denotes being in the world, unlike a sign that represents the being orthe world. The symbol must include the observer, whereas a sign does not.Symbols permit us to progress from the externally perceived form of a givenphenomenon toward its essence. Symbols do not exist to be interpreted ordecoded: they draw the observer inward to participate in the world of spirit. Atan as-yet-undetermined time, bodily parts and functions were linked with thepowers of the signs of the zodiac. The zodiac and its signs were certainlypresent in Britain in Roman times (43–410 CE). The signs denote not only theheavenly constellations but also qualities or collections of attributes, so theyalso have a symbolic function. The Hermetic maxim, “as above, so below” statesthat the greater world, the Cosmos, is reflected in the lesser world, the humanbeing. The parts of the human body therefore reflect aspects of the Cosmos, andthese are expressed through the signs of the zodiac. The relationship to theparts of the body is also symbolic. The meaning of each sign expresses subtlequalities present in the corresponding part of the human body. The human head,vision, and expression are ruled by Aries, the Ram; the neck, throat, and voiceby Taurus, the Bull. Gemini, the Twins, correspond with the arms. Cancer, theCrab, rules the chest, breasts, and stomach; and Leo, the Lion, the heart. Virgorules the abdomen and intestines; Libra, the Scales, the kidneys and the navel;and Scorpio, the genitals. Sagittarius, the Archer, corresponds with the thighs;Capricorn, the Goat, the knees; and Aquarius, the Water-Carrier, with the lowerlegs. Finally, the two fishes, Pisces, rule the feet.OPERATIVE MAGIC PRINCIPLESThere are two basic magical practices: direct natural magic and talismanic orsigil magic. Since antiquity, they have been used in parallel with one another.Amulets—actual things, such as a quartz pebble, a sliver of alder wood, thefeather of a raven, a wolf’s heart, or a toad’s bone—contained the particularunique power of that stone, plant, or animal. Each could be used for appropriatemagical effects, related to the nature (“virtue”) of the animal, plant, orstone. Often these materials were difficult to obtain. Once found, certainrituals were necessary to channel their power for human use. Actual powerspresent within physical objects could also be accessed through images of theobject, by signs that referred to them, and by corresponding powers, such asplanetary spirits or zodiacal signs. This is the underlying concept of runic andsigil magic, where magicians use visible marks to embody the power rather thanthe actual objects. A sigil may denote the power of a stone, tree, animal,planet, star, spirit, or god and particular aspects of them according to theneeds of the magician. Of course, it is still necessary that a sigil must have aphysical form. It must be written upon something, using a medium, whether bloodor inks, so there is still a physical composition of the talisman that must bein concurrence with its meaning in order to work. It must be consecratedritually to activate its power. Runes are magic sigils that are also letters ofan alphabet.Runic talismans were characters of texts inscribed on particular woods, such asyew, and empowered by blood. The Old English word teáfor, meaning red coloring(ochre, red chalk) continues in the English shepherds’ word for sheep-marking,traditionally red, tiver. This was probably the word used in the past forempowering runes and other magical items with blood. The German word Zauber,“magic,” is cognate with it, as is the Old Norse taufr, “a talisman.”Technically, runes are not distinct from other forms of magical sigils.Bind-runes (bindnar runir) were used from the earliest times to make compositesigils expressing the combined power of two or more runes. Icelandic magicaltexts contain talismanic sigils composed of runes combined with other elements:astrological, planetary, metallic, and spiritual. Sigils can be marked uponobjects, animals, and people to empower them with the virtues of the thingsignified by the sigil. Tools and weapons were inscribed with runes thatempowered them with a readable text, whether the name of a feared and famoussword or the use of a talisman against the dangers of the sea. They were alsoused to ward off illness, dangerous things, hostile magic, and destructiveentities such as evil spirits (Old Norse meinvættir) and black vessels.Individuals could be marked with permanent sigils, as in 1609 when astrologerSimon Forman inscribed the characters of Venus, Jupiter, and Cancer on his leftarm and right breast using an ink made from gold (Rosecrans 2000, 46–48).Enthusiastic writers on ancient skills and wisdom sometimes portray thepractitioners of the past as perfect masters who could do no wrong and neverfail, but the world is not and has never been like that. It has a built-infailure rate. Inept magic is mentioned in Egils Saga, where the eponymous herofinds a supposedly healing whalebone talisman upon the bed of a very ill woman.It has ten runes wrongly inscribed. Egil destroys it, saying, “A man should notcut runes unless he can read them properly, because a false runestave has beenthe downfall of many.” He carves a new stave with the proper runes, and sherecovers.People with the Scottish surnames Freer and Frere claim to be descended from theastrologers of the kings of Scotland. In the Scottish highlands and islands,augury ( frith; Old Norse ófreskr) was conducted to find lost people and animalsand determine their location. The frith was made on the first Monday of thequarter, just before sunrise. The fritheir (diviner, seer) having fasted, withbare head, bare feet, and closed eyes, went to the threshold and put a hand oneach doorjamb. Concentrating upon the objective, the fritheir opened his eyesand stared straight ahead. From what he saw, he made his augury (Carmichael1997, note 194). This is a classic example of what in Old Norse is termedframsýni (foresight). Frith was also conducted in the highlands of Scotland onHallowe’en at the meeting of three roads; sitting on a three-legged stool, thefritheir perceived the names of those doomed to die in the coming year. Also, afritheir could see the spirits of the dead by standing at a crossroads with hischin resting on a forked stick. First to be passing would be the shades of thegood, then the shades of those who have been murdered, then the damned (Puhvel1976, 169–70). On the Isle of Man, people who were born after the death of theirfather, or who had a cross of hair on their chests, or whose eyebrows met, werereputed to possess second sight. It was a practice of such people to go into achurchyard on the eves of the New Year, of St. Mark’s Day, and of Midsummer Dayto foretell who was to be buried in it during the ensuing year (Moore 1891,162). The claim to be able to see otherworldly events and harmful entities wasused by some people for personal gain. The man reputed to be the lastboggart-seer in Lancashire, northwestern England, died around the middle of thenineteenth century. In 1867, Harland and Wilkinson wrote, “J. W., the last ofthe ancient race of boggart-seers in the township, used to combat with feoorin’between East End and Droylesden toll gate; but as he died a few years agowithout bequeathing his gift, he (happily) carried with him his mantle to thegrave” (Harland and Wilkinson 1867, 55). A boggart-seer was a person who couldsee the evil entities called boggarts, the unquiet spirits of the dead, and knewthe techniques of neutralizing them.Much of northern magic is concerned with illness and healing, combating spiritsand other entities that were perceived as the root cause of the symptoms. Thereis a considerable corpus of these magical charms from Anglo-Saxon England. Inhis Anglo-Saxon Magic, G. Storms asserted that these magical formulae were theoldest relics of Anglo-Saxon and Germanic literature, stemming from ancienttraditions. Storms stated that these charms are of outstanding importancebecause they give us more than a tantalizing glimpse of a “strange world,” andemphasise the close connection between Anglo-Saxon magic and religion (Storms1948, 5–11). In traditional worldviews, untoward events are often ascribed tothe visible or invisible action of benevolent or malevolent entities (Storms1948, 49–50). The Anglo-Saxon charms tell of the elves (ælf; plural: ylfe) asdestructive entities causing illness, and dwarfs were also characterized asdisease-spirits (Storms 1948, 50–51). There was a similar concept in Welshtradition of destructive entities causing disease. In his Ancient CymricMedicine, Henry S. Wellcome quotes a poem ascribed to the British bard Taliesin.It describes the devastating Yellow Plague of Rhôs as the result of a diseasedemon, “a most strange creature that will come from the sea-marsh.” In the poem“it is concealed because sight cannot perceive it” (Wellcome 1903, 41). Wellcomesees this as “ancient Cymric bacteriology.” Some Anglo-Saxon charms are tocombat specific disease-spirits that had infected the patient’s blood. Thecharms seek to expel them by letting blood, which will take out thedisease-spirits as well (Storms 1948, 51–52). Christianity redefined all of theearlier dwarfs, elves, beasts, and injurious spirits as agents of the devil, butit was essentially the same system given a new theoretical basis (Storms 1948,51).HUMAN AND ANIMAL POWERSMen who had the ability to change shape were hamramr, “strong in form.” Fightingmen who took on battle frenzy were called Berserkir or Úlfheðinn. They were menwho wore bear pelts or wolf skins to acquire the power of these fearsome wildanimals. The belief was that these men could actually transform themselves intoreal bears or wolves. This technique was apparently uncontrollable. Those whowent into it experienced possession by the beast. The Völsunga Saga tells howthe heroes Sigmund and Sinfjötli put on magic wolf skins that took them over,and uncontrollably they became wolves and rampaged, randomly killing people.Finally, they succeeding in removing the skins and burnt them. The terrorengendered by these merciless men is evoked in the ninth-century poem Hrafnsmál:“the Berserks bayed . . . the Úlfheðnar howled.” Viking Age helmet panels foundat Torslunda in Sweden show bears, a wolf-headed warrior, and spearmen wearinghelmets with boar crests. The tradition of the bear warrior, its frenzy removedby military discipline, continues today in Denmark and Britain, where the royalguards wear bearskin hats as part of their ceremonial uniforms.Belief that hamramr was a physical reality of devilish origin was the basis ofmany accusations in medieval and later witch trials. A Bull of Pope Gregory XIrefers to witches’ sabbaths at which the devil appeared as a toad or a ghost ora black cat (Burstein 1956, 22). During the witch hunts, women accused ofwitchcraft were said to have transformed themselves into hares, cats, dogs,toads, bees, flies, and other unlikely animals. Ann Baites, who was tried as awitch in Northumberland, northeastern England, in 1673, was said to have changedinto a cat, a hare, a greyhound, and a bee. Belief in supernatural animalhelpers and human transmogrification did not die out in the medieval period.Belief in hamramr continued in England well into the twentieth century. In 1901the Lincolnshire folklorist Mabel Peacock wrote of people suspected of “knowingmore than they should.” One of these “students of unholy lore” could, it wasclaimed, take on the shape of a dog or toad when he was determined to attack hisneighbor’s cattle. He worried sheep and oxen in the shape of a dog, and in theshape of a toad, he poisoned the pigs’ feeding trough (Peacock 1901, 172;Peacock and Carson, December 1901, 510). Eric Maple recounts a story fromCanewdon in eastern England where a witch took on the shape of a toad. Otherwitches then made visits to her in the shape of toads to renew their power(Maple 1960, 246).image [../images/00010.jpeg]Fig. 2.1. Torslunda helmet plates with beast-warriors."},{"pageContent":"3Place, Space, and TimeTHE PRIMACY OF THE NORTHWherever we are, each of us, with our awareness centered in our bodies, is thecenter of our world. Where we are at any given time is the place, our place inthe world. The world of our present consciousness is here and now. Each of us iscentered upon ourselves, and from this state of centered presence comes the ideathat the surface of the earth is centered at a particular place. Socially,ritual, religious, and political centers are based upon this understanding.The view from the center is inherent in orientation and time-telling. Visiblerising and setting points of the sun form markers on the horizon that definedirections from the center point from which they are viewed. Of course, theseare all apparent phenomena, the result of the rotation of the earth on its axisand its orbit around the sun. Sunrise and sunset at the vernal and autumnalequinoxes is due east-west, and all other rising and setting points of the sunvary day by day and season by season. But these changes are not random; they areprogressive. Days lengthen from the midwinter solstice until the midsummersolstice, when they shorten again progressively until the shortest day at thewinter solstice.In the north, calendars evolved from these cyclic sequences of increase anddecrease. In the Northern Hemisphere, the most southerly point of the sun on thehorizon is at the winter solstice, after which sunrise is progressively farthernorth, day by day, until the summer solstice, when the sunrise is at its mostnortherly rising point. Sunsets, too, are the most northerly at the summersolstice and most southerly at the winter one. The only unchanging solardirections are due south, the highest point of the sun in the day, the zenith,and due north, when the sun is at the lowest point (beneath us at midnight), thenadir. These remain the same throughout the year. The conceptual line betweenthe zenith and the nadir is the meridional line, due north-south. This was ofsignificance in the Norse coming-into-being myth, where orientation within spaceis the precondition for existence to emerge. In Ginnungagap, the primeval void,a north-south division arose where ice in the north came into contact with firefrom the south, bringing into existence the world and all beings within it.The concept of four directions emerged from the apparent path of the sun in itsdaily appearances above the horizon through the year. The sun rises toward theeast, whose meaning is “growing bright” and “burning.” The south is thedirection where the sun reaches its greatest daily altitude and gives itsfullest light. The west is the direction of the going down of the sun, and thenorth is the direction of night, meaning “away” and “below, where the sun isbeneath the place where we are.” But north does not necessarily mean night, asit does in regions closer to the equator. North of the Arctic Circle atmidsummer, the sun does not set at all, remaining above the horizon due north atmidnight. This is the famous phenomenon of the midnight sun (Reuter 1985, 4–5).North was an important sacred direction in pre-Christian times. It was thedirection of prayer in the indigenous religions of northern Europe, directedtoward the North Pole, the “immovable heavenly seat” that is the axis of theearth, around which the night sky appears to rotate (Reuter 1985, 6). In Vikingtimes, settlements were often built up from south to north, the second settlertaking the land to the north of the first homestead. The younger son of thehomesteader then had the rights to the southernmost plot of land (Reuter 1985,5). Farmhouses and halls in that period were oriented east-west so that theowner’s high seat on the northern long wall faced due south, the high point ofthe sun at midday. The high-seat pillars were carved with sacred images anddecorated with “god-nails” (reginnaglar). On the Moot Hill, the place of thelocal assembly, the king and the lawspeaker stood in the north, facing south;the assembled people faced north. The plaintiff stood in the south and facednorth to seek official justice, but in civil legal proceedings that were notconsidered to be a contest, such as the conclusion of a contract, one partyfaced west, and the other east (Reuter 1985, 5).The early Christian apologist Origen taught that hell was at the center of theearth and the entrance to it was at the North Pole. Interestingly, in commonwith Greek and Roman geographers of the period, he recognized that the earth wasround, a fact later considered heretical by religious literalists. Each time theNorthern Lights appeared, Origen claimed, this was a sign that the gates of hellhad opened, warning sinners of their impending doom; “the doctrine of fear ofthe North creeps in everywhere” (Johnson 1912, 335). The Christian missionariesto northern Europe condemned veneration of the north on the grounds that prayingnorthward was evil. The Christian condemnation of the north was taken from OldTestament biblical sources. The books of Job, Jeremiah, and Isaiah claimed thatthe “sides of the north” were the abode of the Devil (Job 21:6–7; Isaiah12:12–13; Jeremiah 4:6). The biblical separation of the sheep from the goatssends the goats to the left-hand side. According to Jewish tradition, that isthe north. In medieval times, Anglo-Norman heraldry followed this division, theright being called dexter and the left, sinister. These words still have goodand bad connotations today. The understanding that the sun can stand in thenorth and give light at midnight was unknown in the ancient Middle East, andthere the north meant only darkness and evil.The religious conflict of sacred directions was manifested in royal edicts.Around the year 800 CE, when Frisia was repaganized by King Gotrik of Denmark,doors were cut through the north walls of churches, and Christians were forcedto crawl through them facing north. In the eleventh century, the Norwegian kingOlaf III (Olaf Kyrre; reigned 1067–1093), who was Christian, had the northernhigh seat of the royal hall moved to the eastern side (Reuter 1985, 6). Inpre-Christian Iceland, burials appear to have been without a significant commonorientation (Eldjárn 2000, 285). Norse pagan burials, on the other hand, have amarked tendency to a north-south orientation (Shetelig 1912, 230). Christianburials were always intended to be east-west with their head to the west (andtheir faces therefore to the east), reflecting the belief that the final summonsto Judgment would come from the east. Hence in Wales the east wind was known asthe “wind of the dead man’s feet.” In 1648 in His Noble Numbers, the Englishpoet Robert Herrick expressed this as the Christian sacred orientation in hisreligious poem North and South:The Jewes their beds, and offices of ease,Plac’ d North and South, for these clean purposes;That Man’s uncomely froth might not molestGods ways and walks, which lie still East and West.(HERRICK 1902 [1648], 363)Some early medieval churches, which were oriented east-west, had entrance doorson both north and south sides; but at some point the north doors were blocked,except in rare instances where the only entrance was to the north. In 1899George S. Tyack wrote, “The north was of old mystically supposed to typify theDevil, and a usage prevailed in some places of opening a door on that side ofthe church at the administration of Holy Baptism, for the exit of the exorciseddemon” (Tyack 1899, 66). Tyack gave a specific example of this: “In the Cornishchurch of Wellcombe is a door in the north wall, locally known as ‘the devil’sdoor,’ which is opened, at the renunciation in the baptismal service, for theexorcised spirit to take his flight” (Tyack 1899, 171). The location of burialswith regard to the direction of the church was significant. In the graveyard, itwas customary to bury the dead on the southern side of the church. In his OnPraying for the Dead, the English bishop Miles Coverdale (1488–1569) wrote, “Asmen die, so shall they arise: if in faith in the Lord toward the South, theyneed no prayers; they are presently happy, and shall arise in glory: if inunbelief without the Lord toward the North, then are they past all hope”(Coverdale 1846, 258). Only those who had transgressed and were consideredunworthy of a full Christian burial were interred on the north side. Forexample, in 1786 at Turlagh in Ireland, Robert Fitzgerald was hung for murderand was buried “on what is generally termed the wrong side of the church, in hisclothes without a coffin” (Tyack 1899, 66).The meridional (north-south) line is also significant in traditional Britishfolk magic. In Cornwall, western England, in 1665, the “Conjuring Parson”William Rudall recorded in his Diurnall how he laid a ghost by ritual magic. Hedescribes how he made a magic circle and set up a rowan staff in a pentaclebefore standing in the south of the circle, facing due north to call up thespirit (Hawker of Morwenstow, quoted by Bottrell 1880). There is a Welsh folkbelief that a healing spring should have an outlet toward the south, which meansthat the water flows from the north (Johnson 1912, 332). A recorded instance ofhealing using south-running water was noted in the nineteenth century in thenorth of England in connection with a talisman called the Black Penny. Whencattle showed symptoms of mad cow disease, the Black Penny had to be dipped in asouth-flowing spring before water was taken from the spring and given to theailing livestock (Henderson 1866, 164). Practices of the Toadmen of the east ofEngland recorded in the twentieth century used the water of a stream flowingfrom north to south to select a particular bone of a toad used for magicalpurposes (Parsons 1915, 37; Evans 1971, 217–21; Pennick 2011b, 33).Cambridgeshire fenman W. H. Barrett recorded a tradition that brown toads wereintroduced to Britain by the Romans, who used them as a compass. A dagger bladewas placed on the warts on the toad’s back, and the toad moved until the bladepointed north (Porter 1969, 51).image [../images/00011.jpeg]Fig. 3.1. Toadman’s toad bone, Cambridgeshire, England.THE EIGHT AIRTSimage [../images/00002.jpeg]An Ancient Way of Dividing Up the LandA fourfold conceptual model of existence is found throughout the Europeantradition. The geomantic division of towns and cities into four quarters (hencethe word quarter for a district) is first recorded in the Disciplina Etrusca(Etruscan Discipline), the ancient art of the Augurs of Etruria in Italy in theearly years of the first millennium BCE. The Roman surveyors, members of theguild of Agrimensores, used the sixteenfold Disciplina Etrusca for laying outthe orientation and groundplans of temples, fortresses, and cities. This was aparticular skill that embodied Etruscan spiritual principles, divination, andaugury. How far it was known outside expert circles is uncertain. Fourfolddivisions of countries, especially islands, are also a tradition. The island ofBornholm in the Baltic traditionally has four distinct regions, or quarters; sodo Iceland and Ireland. The four provinces of Ireland—Leinster, Munster,Connacht, and Ulster—are the most anciently recorded example of this ritualdivision.In agricultural and seagoing societies, people are always aware of the visiblehorizon as they observe the apparent motions of sun, moon, and stars in relationto their location. This is the essence of traditional European perception, inwhich no part is isolated from any other part. The conceptual layout of the landwas perceived according to natural measure, which divided the circle of thehorizon into four quarters by imaginary lines running north-south and east-west.This division derives from the structure of the human body and the structure ofthe world. Between these two conceptual lines at right angles, the horizon isdivided by further lines in the intercardinal directions. The southern quarteris the quadrant between southwest and southeast; the eastern quarter is betweensoutheast and northeast; the northern sector is between the northeast and thenorthwest; and finally, the western quadrant is between the northwest and thesouthwest. These eight directions come from the physical structure of the worldwe live upon: the north-south polar axis and the east-west one at right anglesto it, the plane of the earth’s rotation.image [../images/00012.jpeg]Fig. 3.2. Eightfold stone circle formerly at Solá, Norway.Recognition of this inherent eightfold division is necessary if one wants tomake a square or rectangular structure facing the four quarters of the heavens,such as a traditional building. The four cardinal directions are therefore atthe midpoints of the four quarters. The fixed eightfold division of the horizonis a marker of the apparent motions of the celestial bodies, which are cyclic.Depending on latitude, the position of the rising and setting sun at thesolstices and at other significant times of the year will be at different placeson the horizon relative to the eightfold division. At certain times they willcoincide with one or other of the eightfold markers, such as at the equinoxes.These directions played an integral part in traditional ways of life. Thetraditional reckoning of solar time was used in northern Europe until thearrival of cheap clocks and the imposition of centralized standard time, firstby railway companies, then by governments.TIME AND THE DAYThe word “day” has two different literal meanings. A day can be the period ofdaylight between sunrise and sunset, as opposed to night. But a day can alsomean the period including darkness, the modern 24-hour day (Old Icelandic dœgr),as defined by the calendar, running from midnight to midnight. Two differentinterpretations of the same word caused confusion when the Christian religionwas introduced. Christian time division originated with the early monasteries inEgypt. It was used to govern the times of their daily cycle of prayers. Their“Temporal Hour” system of time-telling divided the day of daylight into twelveequal hours. There was not a serious difference between the length of the day insummer and winter in Egypt at a latitude around 30°. But in northern Europe,between 24° and 36° north of Egypt, the length of difference between summer daysand winter days is enormous. In the northern winter the nights are longer thanthe days, but in summer they are shorter, so in systems dividing daylight intotwelve, the hours are significantly longer in summer than they are in winter. InEgypt the difference was negligible, but in Iceland, for instance, where it islight for three common (modern) hours in winter, but twenty-one hours in summer,the church method of day-division was unacceptable. In winter the churchtemporal hour amounted to fifteen minutes by modern reckoning, and in summer onehour and forty-five minutes. Temporal hours are not a workable system in thenorth, but they were used by the clergy, who must have understood that theindigenous system was better suited to practical use.Because of the considerable differences in day length during the year, awarenessof the directions was more highly developed and widespread in the north ofEurope than in many other parts of the world, for it was a necessary part ofsurvival. The knowledge of the airts (eight directions) was an integral part ofthe knowledge of farmers, builders, seafarers, warriors, and magicians. TheTides of the Day are an octaval system. Each Tide is not related to the lengthof daylight, but to a whole cycle of light and dark, the calendar day. There areeight equal divisions for the modern 24-hour period, reckoned as beginning andending at 7:30 a.m. These Tides are not the same as, nor are they related to,the tides that ebb and flow in the sea. Markers of the Tides are always thesame, so sunrise and sunset vary between the Tides. In winter a certain point ina Tide will be in darkness, when in summer at the same point it will be light.How long daylight lasts varies with the season. The range between the height ofthe sun at noon on midwinter and noon on midsummer is also notable. The sunrises due east twice a year at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, that is 6:00hours in modern clock time, and when it sets due west, it is 18:00. When the sunstands due south at any time of year, it is 12:00 noon, but the height of thesun varies from day to day. The lowest altitude of the sun at noon is at thewinter solstice, and its highest altitude is at the midsummer solstice. Thevisible rising and setting points of sun, moon, and stars are not the same indifferent places; one must have local knowledge. Between the southernmost risingof the sun at midwinter and the most southerly sunrise at midsummer, the sunrises due east at the equinoxes, crossing the east-west line southward in winterand northward in summer. This defines the two halves of the year, the dark halfand the light half. They are dependent upon the latitude at which the observerstands but also depend on the site from which we are viewing them.From the viewing point of a farmstead or sacred place, these sunrises weremarked by a convenient natural feature such as a mountain or by an installedmarker (a post, a standing stone, a cairn, or a tree of notable species planteddeliberately) at that point. In addition to sunrises at notable times of year,the markers indicate the time of day when the sun stands at any altitude abovethem. For convenience, houses were built in relation to the cardinal directions,so that the door faced one of the important directions, and anyone going outcould view the corresponding marker. Old Icelandic houses had a “house stone” infront of the door on which the observer stood to view the sky. The Althing inIceland observed the sun’s course, and hence the time, from the law-speaker’sseat (Reuter 1985, 7).For time-telling, the sun was used by day and the stars by night. The eightfoldsystem could be used for time-telling irrespective of the lay of the land. Theheight of the horizon above or below our viewing point alters the apparentrising—and setting—places of the celestial bodies. Unless the site has a horizonof equal height all around it, we will not see the celestial bodies rising andsetting symmetrically with relation to the cardinal directions. On a levelhorizon there is an annual solar geometry where the midsummer solstice sunriseis diametrically opposite midwinter sunset, and the winter solstice sunrise isdirectly opposite midsummer sunset. But such places are rare. At any time ofyear when the sun is above the horizon, it will always be above the same horizonmarker at the same time of day. This is the principle of the sundial.image [../images/00013.jpeg]Fig. 3.3. Eightfold wheel of time from Bjornsson’s Rimbegla, Copenhagen,Denmark, 1780. The Library of the European TraditionSundials of the Anglo-Saxon era in England are often called “scratch dials,”sexton’s wheels, and mass clocks. Extant sundials are on the oldest survivingbuildings, which are invariably churches. The grammarian Ælfric (ca. 950–1021)records that in Anglo-Saxon England there were professional time-tellers calledtídsceáware or dægmæl-sceáware. The oldest datable Anglo-Saxon sundials, such asthe seventh-century one on Escomb Church in County Durham, divide daylight intofour parts. So do the oldest dials in Ireland, on standing stone slabs alsodating back to the seventh century CE, such as those at Monasterboice and Kells.Later dials have the traditional eightfold day, sometimes melded with thetwelvefold hours of the Christian form of time reckoning. Kirkdale Priory inNorth Yorkshire, England, has a sundial using this system. It dates to betweenthe years 1056 to 1066. Carved next to it is the Old English text that reads,“This is the day’s sun marker at every Tide.” The eight Tides of the day asobserved in Old England, described in the modern 24-hour clock system, are asfollows: Morgan, from 4:30 to 7:30; Dæg-Mael, 7:30 to 10:30 (this is the firstTide of the day); Mid-Dæg, 10:30 to 13:30; Ofanverthr Dagr, 13:30 to 16:30;Mid-Aften, 16:30 to 19:30; Ondverth Nott, 19:30 to 21:30; Mid-Niht, 21:30 to1:30; and Ofanverth Nott, 1:30 to 4:30. In Wales the equivalent Welsh systemnamed the Tides Bore (equivalent to Morgan), Anterth, Nawn, Echwydd, Gwechwydd,Ucher, Dewaint, and Pylgeint.In the eightfold system the morning mark points are significant in managing thebeginning of the working day. Morgan, the morning Tide, begins with the sun atthe East-North-East point, 4:30 a.m. local apparent time in the current timesystem. This point was called rismál, “getting-up time” in Old Norse. Morgan isfollowed by Dæg-Mael, breakfast time, reckoned as the first Tide of the day. Thepoint of transition between these Tides is a significant horizon marker wherethe sun stands East-South-East, 7:30 a.m. local apparent time in the currenttime system, called dagmálastaðr in Iceland. The South-South-West mark pointcorresponding to 13:30 was called miðmundi, and West-South-West (16:30)eyktarstaðr. In the summer half of the year, eyktarstaðr was the point where theday’s work ended. On the day in autumn when the sun set at eyktarstaðr, thismarked the beginning of winter (Reuter 1985, 7).The eight directions were called ættir (singular: ætt) in Old Norse. Moregenerally, the word means “direction,” for the verb átta means “to orientoneself.” The ættir of the horizon relate to eight periods of time called in OldNorse eyktir, a word apparently linked with the English word “yoke” and theGerman joch (Reuter 1985, 7).image [../images/00014.jpeg]Fig. 3.4. Damaged stone slab with eightfold sundial, Kells, Ireland.In Scots, airt means “a quarter of the heavens; point of the compass; thedirection of the wind” as well as having meanings related to transitivemovements in a direction, such as “to point out the way to a place; to direct;to turn in a certain direction . . . to aim at” (Warrack 1988 [1911], 4).Similarly, in modern Irish aird means a direction or a point of the compass. Innortheastern England the directions are referred to as the airts, whereas inLancashire, northwest England, they are haevers (Harland and Wilkinson 1867,149; Warrack 1988 [1911], 4).In the integrated culture of the north, ætt equally refers to lineage, family,clan, and house in the sense of an aristocratic ancestral line. These aretraditionally related to the place that family or clan originated and lived. TheOld Norse ætt is also a group of eight runes in the 24-rune futhark. There is atradition of the ættar-fylgja, “family fylgja,” which cares for the fortunes ofthe family and is the property of one or other of the family members. When itsowner dies, the fylgja finds a place with another relative, if possible. Theproperties ascribed to this kind of fylgja appear to have similarities with thebelief that particular angels or spirits rule the directions as well as places.OTHER SYSTEMS OF TIMEThe direct observation of the sun from a particular place is the basis of theeight tides of the day. But in northern Europe there have been numerous ways ofdividing the day for secular, religious, and magical purposes. Theecclesiastical way of dividing the day was not into eight tides, but divideddaylight into twelve equal parts and the night into twelve equal parts. Thesehours are called Canonical, Temporal, or Unequal Hours. This came into conflictwith traditional northern ways of time-telling when Christianity was broughtinto northern Europe. From about the ninth century, the church had a fixedsystem of monastic rituals, “canonical offices” that consisted of eight dailyprayer events called Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, Compline, and theNight Office or Vigils, divided into a number of sections called Nocturnes. Fromthe 1300s, starting in Italy, the practice of dividing the day into twenty-fourhours became widespread in Europe. Magicians used and still use the unequalhours system known as the Planetary Hours.There are four main systems of time divisions. Horæ ab ortu solis, “hours fromthe place of the sun,” otherwise called Babylonian Hours or Greek Hours, startwith sunrise and end at the following sunrise, dividing the day into twenty-fourequal hours. This is also called the “Natural Day” (Tupper 1895, 120). Daylighthours are numbered low. Horæ ab occasu solis, also called Italian, Welsch, orBohemian Hours, start the hours at sunset and end at sunset, so daylight hoursare numbered high. Horæ norimbergenses, Nuremberg Hours, can begin either atsunrise or sunset. Daylight hours are numbered from sunset, as in theBabylonian/ Greek Hours; at sunrise, they are numbered in a new series, as inthe Italian/Bohemian system. Horæ communes, known as Common Hours, French Hours,and German Hours, divide the day into two periods of twelve, beginning at middayand midnight, 12:00 noon and 12:00 midnight. This is still the most common meansof time-telling, with ante meridiem (a.m.) and post meridiem (p.m.) hours,though the 24-hour clock is used in transport and business to avoid confusion.The medieval sundial and compass makers of Nuremberg called the hours of the24-hour system Grosse Uhr, “great hours,” and those of the Common Hours, KleineUhr, “small hours” (Gouk 1988, 18).image [../images/00015.jpeg]Fig. 3.5. Versions of time division in northern Europe, Olaus Magnus, 1555. TheLibrary of the European TraditionWhen they had been abandoned for everyday time-telling, the Unequal Hours systemsurvived in use in magic as the Planetary Hours. This method assigns aparticular astrological planet to each hour of the day and night through theweek (Agrippa 1993 (1531) II, XXXIV). The time from the sun rising to itssetting is divided into twelve and the night from sunset to sunrise also dividedinto twelve. These are the twelve hours of the day and twelve hours of thenight, which of course vary in length continuously as the duration of daylightand darkness lengthen or shorten with the seasons. The first hour of each day isruled by the lord of that day, so the first hour of Sunday is ruled by the Sunand so on. The seven astrological planets are numbered in their traditionalsequence in descending order, as in the nine spheres of traditional cosmology:Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and the Moon. So on a Wednesday,the first planetary hour is Mercury; the second, the Moon; the third, Saturn;and so on. The Wednesday sequence begins again with Mercury at the eighth hour,and the twelfth hour of the day is therefore Mars. The planetary sequence goeson into the twelve hours of the night with the first hour being the Sun. Itrepeats again at the third hour of the night, when Mercury rules. The last(twelfth) hour of Wednesday night (Thursday morning in modern reckoning)preceding sunrise is therefore Saturn. At sunrise on Thursday, the next planet,Jupiter, rules the first hour. It is an ingenious system, which continuouslyrecycles the seven planets in their proper order, day after day.Counting the day from sunset was a widespread custom whichever system of hourswas in use. The eve of a day counted as the beginning of that day, even thoughnow it is numbered on the preceding calendar day. So May Eve is after sunset onApril 30 and in Germany is also known as Walpurgisnacht. Other festivals, suchas St. Mark’s Eve, Allhallows’ Eve (Hallowe’en), Christmas Eve, and New Year’sEve, are all major eves in customary celebration and magical observance. Inancient Ireland, a night (oídhche) was used to measure the days rather thancalendar days beginning at midnight. The new day began at sunset, not atsunrise, so that what was called a Monday night would precede the day of Monday,as still used in the eve system. Counting time by nights, not by days, stillsurvives in British English, where a fortnight means two weeks (fourteennights). The obsolete word sennight (seven nights) was formerly used to describea week.Traditional time-telling went into decline when clocks were invented and becamegenerally available. The regular machinery of the clock became the norm by whichtime was measured. But certain remote places and trades retained traditionaltime lore long after it had been abandoned in most places in favor of clocktime. Places without railways were less affected, as there was no timetable tokeep to. In the Faroe Islands the traditional system continued well into thetwentieth century, and rural workers improvised methods of time-telling wellinto the twentieth century.RULE-OF-THUMB TIME-TELLINGKnowing the directions and gauging the height of the sun were the two importantfactors of telling the time of day. The directions were common knowledge to all,and the sun’s height could be determined by common objects, the human body, andlocal knowledge. O. S. Reuter noted that the method for announcing an agreedtime to stop work, or any other time needed to be marked, was by the height ofthe sun rather than its direction. A common measure in medieval Iceland was theshaft height of the sun. This was in the afternoon when the lower edge of thesun appears to rest on the point of a spear set up nine feet from the observer.This was the observer’s own spear, made for him personally according to hisphysical height. It was set up so that he could still reach comfortably with ashafthand (that is, with the thumb held out from the fist) up to the socket ofthe spearhead. Because each man’s spear was related to his personal size, thistechnique gives the same sighting angle for any man using his own weapon. Thistechnique removed the necessity to observe the horizon, using a common weapon asthe instrument of measurement (Reuter 1985, 8).In the preindustrial era, precise times were generally not required.*1[part0023.html#fr1] A less rigid schedule was current for everyday needs. InEngland the day and night were customarily divided into thirteen parts. This“thirteen times of day and night” is a rule-of-thumb way of telling time,practical enough for a life not ruled by the clock (Lawrence 1898, 339): 1. After Midnight 2. Cockcrow 3. Between the first cockcrow and daybreak 4. The Dawn 5. Morning 6. Noon 7. Afternoon 8. Sunset 9. Twilight 10. Evening 11. Candletime 12. Bedtime 13. Dead of nightIn the days before mechanical time-telling was readily available, the hours ofthe day and night were told by the sun by day and by the stars at night. Themost basic way to improvise a sundial is to use one’s hand. The hand is held outat head height, palm upward. A small straight stick is held in the crook of thethumb at the angle of the latitude, determined by the angle of shadows at noon.The stick becomes a shadow-casting gnomon. Before noon it is held in the lefthand, pointed toward the west; after noon, in the right hand, oriented to theeast. The shadow cast by the stick shows the time by the position of its shadowagainst the joints of the fingers and the fingertips.image [../images/00016.jpeg]Fig. 3.6. Shepherd’s hand sundial, Germany, sixteenth century. The Library ofthe European TraditionMore substantial temporary turf dials, otherwise known as “shepherds’ dials” or“witches’ dials” are known to have been made by herdsmen in the rural parts ofsouthern England. The practice was discontinued gradually, and by the beginningof the twentieth century, they were used only in Kent, Surrey, Sussex, andEssex. They seem to have gone out of use completely during World War I.Shepherds used the dials to tell them when it was time to move the sheep fromthe grazing land to get them to the sheepfold before sunset.The basic shepherd’s dial was made by cutting a circle in the turf about 18inches (460 mm) in diameter. Then a straight stick about a foot long (305 mm)was pushed vertically into the ground at the center of the circle. North of thevertical stick, another stick, notched to mark the hours, was laid east-westinside the circle at right angles to a north-south line. Each end touched thecircle. Having an intimate knowledge of the land on which they worked every day,herdsmen knew what distant landmark, or “farthest beacon” marked north. Thestick at the center was the gnomon that cast a shadow upon the notched stick.The hour was indicated where the shadow touched a notch. Some shepherdsdispensed with a notched stick and made small ridges in the earth to mark thehours. There is no one way of doing things traditionally, so others made adifferent dial that was a reversal of the principle of the dial just described.It started with the circle, but a shorter stick was stuck in the center. Intothe perimeter of the circle, another stick a foot long was put in the ground,due south of the first stick. More sticks were stuck into the circle atappropriate distances for the hours or tides relative to the first stick.Traditionally, seven sticks were used. All had the function of gnomons, castingshadows across the central stick, which was the marker of the hours (Gossett1911).These traditional methods were in use until the availability of cheap clocks andwatches, and the imposition of standardized time in time zones, delocalizedtime-telling. The need to have the same clock time at different places, ratherthan the sun-determined local apparent time, so that trains could run safely,led railway companies to standardize their clocks at a main station. Later,government edicts enforced railway time on whole countries. The concept of legaltime was created, where the official mean time and later “daylight saving time”determined by central government became the everyday reality. People were forcedto use government-defined time rather than the natural real time told from thesun, which thereafter was ignored. After that, ancient traditional methodscontinued to be used by only a very few people, such as traditional astrologersand practitioners of magic. Almost everywhere on Earth now, real local apparenttime is different from official clock time. It is a subtle dislocation whoseeffects on the human body are ignored.image [../images/00017.jpeg]Fig. 3.7. Southern English shepherd’s dial.THE WEEK AND ITS DAYSThe earliest recorded continuously cycling seven-day week was in use among theHebrews from the fifth century BCE. The Sabbath was the named day, while theothers were numbered (Green 1998, 236). The week was transmitted outside Judaismby Greek-speaking Jews, and by the second century BCE the planetary names werebeing used: Zeus, Thursday; Aphrodite, Friday; Kronos, Saturday; Helios, Sunday;Selene, Monday; Ares, Tuesday; and Hermes, Wednesday (Green 1998, 237–38).Naming the days of the week expresses the magical theory that the particularvirtues and powers of each planet are strongest on the day dedicated to them.From the Greeks the week went into the Roman Empire, where the days were namedfor the Roman gods: Jupiter for Thursday, Venus for Friday, Saturn for Saturday,Sol for Sunday, Luna for Monday, Mars for Tuesday, and Mercury for Wednesday.Use of the seven-day week traveled beyond the borders of the Roman Empire, andthe day names were again reconfigured by the interpretatio Germanica with thenames of the northern gods. In the same period Christian apologists, includingAugustine, Philastrius, and Caesarius of Arles, preached that it was sacrilegeto use the Pagan names of the weekdays and recommended using numbered daysinstead. Their recommendations were not followed. In Anglo-Saxon England, forexample, the day names became Tíwesdæg, Tuesday, named for Tíw (the English godcorresponding to the older Germanic Tîwaz); Wódnesdæg, Wednesday, for Woden;Þunresdæg, Thursday, for Þunor; and Frigedæg, Friday, for Frigga. Saturdayappears as a direct import without a significant deity, as the god Sæter orSatern is not among the main gods and goddesses. Sunnandæg and Mónandæg, Sundayand Monday, are named directly for the sun and the moon. The simple referencesto the sun and moon reflect the absence of solar and lunar deities in Germanicreligion, in contrast with the Graeco-Roman pantheon.The particular virtues and powers ascribed to each planet are embedded intraditional lore of good and bad days to do things. Each day had a specificquality that enhanced particular tasks and hindered others. Certain kinds ofmagic performed best on certain days of the week. All over Europe are folksayings that describe what one must and must not do on a particular day. Becausethe church adopted Sunday as its holy day, most prohibitions referred to thisday. At many times and places, laws prevented business from being conducted on aSunday. An Irish example will give a flavor of weekday beliefs. In 1887Lady Wilde wrote that people believed the strength of the fairies’ malevolentpowers were dependent on the day of the week, “The first days of the year and ofthe week [Sunday] are the luckiest. Never begin a journey on a Friday orSaturday, nor move from your residence, nor change a situation. Never cut out adress or begin to make it on a Friday, nor fix a marriage, for of all days thefairies have the most malefic power on a Friday” (Wilde 1887, II, 116).EGYPTIAN DAYSGood and bad days known as “Egyptian Days” or “The Dangerous Days in the Year”appear in a number of medieval magical and medical texts. The medieval Welshbook of the Physicians of Myddfai solemnly explains:Sound teachers have discovered and written as follows, namely, that thirty-twodays in the year are dangerous. Know that whosoever is born on one of thosedays, will not live long, and whosoever is married on one of them, will die erelong, or will only exist in pain and poverty. And whosoever shall begin businesson one of them, will not complete it satisfactorily. (Pughe and Williams 1861,§93, 58)There is no general concurrence of the actual Egyptian Days in published texts.For example, Myddfai has totally different days from those listed in theIcelandic Galdrabók. An Icelandic list of Egyptian Days in the Galdrabók givestwo bad luck days in each month (Flowers 1989, 67), while the Myddfai list hasbetween one and four bad days per month (Pughe and Williams 1861, §93, 58). Soin February, Galdrabók warns of the 3rd and the 4th, while Myddfai lists three:the 16th, 17th, and 18th. For May, Galdrabók has the 3rd and the 7th, whileMyddfai lists four: the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 20th. For October, Galdrabók hasthe 3rd and the 10th, while Myddfai has only one, the 6th. Again, differentcombinations of bad days appear in a Swedish runic calendar of 1710, publishedin 1895, February having the 11th, 17th, 18th, and 19th, and May the 7th. Itconcurs with Myddfai in October with the 6th being the one bad day (Simpson1895, 236).These days clearly had an origin in various dire events, but by the time theywere promoted in books, their origins were forgotten, and they were no more thansuperstition, handed on through practical observance and in respected texts. Anindication of their origin comes from H. C. Agrippa in his Three Books of OccultPhilosophy (1531). Agrippa notes that Penitential or Black Days originated asdays when the commonwealth suffered some notable blow. For example, the Romanscommemorated the day before the fourth Nones of August because it was the daythey suffered heavy defeat by the forces of Hannibal at the Battle of Cannae in216 BCE. In Jewish tradition June 17 and July 9 are Black Days: the first datewas said to be when Moses broke the tables of the law, and Manasseh set up animage; the second date was when both temples of Jerusalem were destroyed(Agrippa 1993 [1531], III, LXIII, 670). They were called Egyptian Days, Agrippatells us, because in ancient times the Egyptians observed days when bad thingshad happened, and subsequently every nation took up the practice to commemoratetheir own national setbacks. In modern times 9/11 is the most recognized ofthese days. By definition historic lists of Egyptian Days must vary from countryto country, hence the lack of consistency.RUNIC CALENDARSRunes may have been used in calendars and almanacs in pre-Christian times, asthere was always a need for some means of recording the passing of time. InIceland in 1639, an edict of the church labeled the use of runes as witchcraft.Árni Pétursson was burnt to death in the presence of the Icelandic Althing in1681 because he had used runic magical formulae. But at the same time, the runeswere in everyday use in Scandinavia and Estonia in calendars and almanacs carvedon wooden staves. The runic perpetual calendar was called a clog almanac inEngland, primstav in Norway, rimstock in Denmark, and runstaf in Sweden. Theirnotation was based upon the Roman calendar enacted by Julius Caesar in 46 BCE.This Julian Calendar became progressively more inaccurate, until it was replacedin 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII and the current Gregorian Calendar came into being.J. Barnard Davis noted in 1867 that there were two kinds of northern almanacscarved on wood and other materials: the more ancient Runic Calendars, inscribedwith runes; and the less ancient, runeless calendars, the Staffordshire clogalmanacs.They were the Primstaves of the Norwegians, so named from the new moon, primaluna, or from the Prime, or Golden Number engraved on them; and Rimstocks by theDanes, from the Icelandic and Anglo-Saxon word Rim, a calendar, and Stock, astaff or stick . . . they were mostly made of wood (treen), but far fromexclusively so. Some were of horn or bone . . . and some were inscribed onparchment; the wood itself differed in different examples. Many were of oak,some of box, some of pear tree, some of lime, and so on. Many were constructedin the form of a sword or sabre, or a long staff or baton; all, emblems of powerin the hands of priests and rulers. Some of these staves were hexagonal in form. . . more were rectangular; some prismatic staves. Others of these calendarswere of tongue-shaped leaves united at one end by an iron pin riveted in, justin the shape and manner of a fan. Another series is formed of thin tablets ofwood, each of which has two holes pierced through it, one near either extremity,so that two thongs may be passed through all the laminæ; and when these are tiedthe instrument closely resembles a modern book. (Davis 1867, 458–59)These almanacs could also be in the form of a ring. The messedag (Mass-day)staff shown in figure 3.8 was depicted in a Norwegian almanac (NorskeFolke-Kalender) for 1848 (Davis 1867, 471).The essentially Christian calendar on the runic almanacs carried on the church’scomplex computations of the date of Easter, depending upon interactions betweenthe vernal equinox and the full moon. The common runic calendar contained sevenrecurring letters that were the first seven runes of the futhark and anothernineteen that indicated the Golden Number cycle. Printed runic almanacs wereproduced in Sweden until the middle of the eighteenth century. The runes finallywent out of use as a practical almanac in Estonia in 1921, when the JulianCalendar was finally abolished, and the Gregorian one, already used everywhereelse, replaced it. The printed page illustrated here is from the work by DoctorPlot, The Natural History of Staffordshire, 1686, where he compared the Englishclog almanacks with the Swedish runstaf and gave the numbers for the runes andtheir names. A woodcut in the second volume of Olof Rudbeck’s Atlantica (1702)depicts a mid-seventeenth-century runic calendar from Österbotten “På bräde utien Treefootz lijkness,” in the likeness of a treefoot. The threefold year of thenorthern tradition marked by Vintersblót (Winter’s Day, October 14),Midvintersblót (Midwinter’s Day, January 13) and Sommarsblót (Summer’s Day,April 14), fits this form admirably. Winter’s Day and Summer’s Day were markedon Estonian runic calendars until 1921.image [../images/00018.jpeg]Fig. 3.8. Runic Almanacs. The Library of the European TraditionTwo-sided almanacs were divided on one side from January 1 to July 1 and theother side from July 2 to December 31. They could be read from left to right orright to left. Four-sided almanacs were divided from January 1 to April 3; April4 to July 1; July 2 to October 12; and October 13 to December 31. Unlucky or“Egyptian” days were marked on some almanacs. Mark days on runic almanacsincluded days from pre-Christian and Christian systems.

The various sorts of calendars were and can beregulated by solar and lunar phenomena without recourse to observing the stars.However, there is a star that stays close to the hub of the Northern Hemispherenight sky as it appears to circle during the night. In modern astronomy thisstar is called Polaris (Stella Polaris, the Pole Star or North Star). This staris an important marker in traditional navigation, both at sea and on land. It isa symbol of constancy and reliability, the unwavering guiding light, which leadsus unfailingly to our destination. The mariners’ use of the North Star has givenit many names: Tir, Stella Maris, the Lode Star, Leitstern, the Nave, theLeading Light, and the Nail. The latter name likens the star to a nail, aroundwhich the heavens rotate like the hub of a wheel. This star, which in the lastmillennia has appeared to stand above the terrestrial pole, was a guiding lightfor those navigating at sea and on land. The Old English Rune Poem tells of itas Tír, “which keeps faith well, always on course in the dark of night.” Itsofficial astronomical name is Polaris, and a Medieval Latin epithet for it is“Stella non erratica,” “the unerring star,” and as an emblem it has the motto,“qui me non aspicet errat”: “He who does not look at me goes astray.”STARS, ASTERISMS, AND CONSTELLATIONSThe names of the asterisms and constellations of the night sky demonstrate aparticular worldview, and in northern Europe the etymology of the word “star”relates to “the scattered, strewn” (Reuter 1985, 19). Some Norse and some Welshconstellations are named after mythological objects. The varied names give us aninsight into the worldview of people in the past, and the interweaving of thecharacters of folktales with the everyday world. In recent years many peoplehave attempted to “reconstruct” a northern astronomy as it may have existed inViking times. The old names of some stars are recorded. Sometimes, too,speculative names from Norse mythology have been attached to constellations ofGraeco-Arabic astronomy, which are thought provoking. However, survivingtraditional names of asterisms from northern Europe show that at least some ofthem do not correspond with the classical constellations, which, although theyhave a venerable history, are essentially arbitrary concepts.Traditionally, the North Star (Stella Polaris) is bound up with the lore of theasterism close to it, the constellation called “Ursa Major” (the Great Bear) inmodern astronomy, which is used as a means of finding it. Like the North Star,the Great Bear has numerous names in traditional northern European astronomy.The North Star can be located in the night sky by following the pointer stars ofthe constellation of Ursa Major, known by their Arabic names, Merak and Dubhe.The arrangement of the stars of Ursa Major has been likened to a plough or awagon in various traditions. In Germanic astronomy the constellation was calledeither Woden’s Wagon or Charles’s Wain (Reuter 1985, 19). Traditional Welshastronomy, recorded in Robert Roberts’s Arweiniad i Wybodaeth o Seryddiaeth (AGuide to a Knowledge of Astronomy; 1816), calls the asterism Saith Seren YGogledd (the Seven Stars of the North) by similar names: Men Carl, Men Charles(Charles’s Wagon), or Jac a’ i Wagen (Jack and his Wagon). Sometimes in Welshthe name of the Great Bear is translated literally: Yr Arth Fawr.Another common traditional name for Ursa Major is the “Plough”; in Welsh YrAradr (the Plough) or Yr Haeddel Fawr (the Great Plough Handle);correspondingly, the constellation Ursa Minor is Yr Haeddel Fach (the LittlePlough Handle). As well as Charles and Jac in their wagons, Peter holds theplough. In Scots a name for Ursa Major is Peter’s Pleugh (Warrack 1988 [1911],409). Yet other Welsh names of this constellation are Llun Y Llong (the Image ofthe Ship); Y Sospan (the Saucepan/Dipper). In the English tradition, Charles’sWain/the Plough and the Pleiades are confusingly both called the Seven Stars; asalso in Welsh where Saith Seren Y Gogled (the Seven Stars of the North; UrsaMajor) are distinguished from Saith Seren Siriol (the Seven Cheerful Stars; thePleiades). According to Finn Magnussen (1845), the Pleiades were known in winterin Iceland as the Star. This asterism was used at night to tell the time, bynoting the compass direction over which the Star was standing, or by itsrelationship to the landscape tide-markers (Reuter 1934, 185). According toeastern English traditional horsemanry, the seven nails in the horseshoesymbolize the seven stars of the Plough (Tony Harvey, personal communication).The “belt” of the constellation Orion is a prominent feature in the night sky,being three bright stars apparently forming a line, and notable as a seasonaland nighttime marker. By its early rising, it signified the beginning of theseason of harvest (Reuter 1985, 13). In both Welsh and Scottish tradition, thishas been named as a measuring rod. In England it was called the Tailor’s YardBand and in Wales it is Llathen Teiliwr (the Tailor’s Yardstick), and inScotland the King’s Ellwand or the Lady’s Ellwand (Sternberg 1851, 126; Warrack1988 [1911], 157). (An ellwand is a measuring rod, a Scots Ell in length,37.0958 inches.) The latter name dedicated to the Lady recalls the Scandinavianname of Orion’s Belt, Friggs Rocken (Frigga’s Distaff) (Reuter 1985, 19).Another Welsh name connecting it with Our Lady is Llathen Fair (Mary’sYardstick). A Scottish name for the asterism is Peter’s Staff (Warrack 1988[1911)], 409). This asterism attracted various other names in northern Europe:the Three Fishers, the Rake, the Three Reapers, and even the Plough (Reuter1985, 19). Another Scottish asterism, the Ellwand of Stars, denotes three starsin the constellation Lyra (Warrack 1988 [1911], 157). Sirius, called the DogStar in England and Scotland, was Loki’s Brand in Pagan Iceland (Reuter 1985,19–20).Several other Welsh constellation names come from mythic characters in theMabinogi, including Llys Dôn (The Court of Dôn), Cassiopeia; Caer Arianrhod(Arianrhod’s Fortress), Corona Borealis; and Telyn Arthur (King Arthur’s Harp),Lyra. In the latter constellation, Welsh astronomy differs from the Scottish inexpressing the asterism in a classical way as a musical instrument and not ameasuring rod. In common with Greek mythology, Norse myth tells of features setin the sky by the gods as memorials of their deeds. Two asterisms are associatedwith body parts of giants: Aurvandil’s Toe and Thjassi’s Eyes. O. S. Reuteridentifies Corona Borealis as the Old Norse constellation Orendil’s(Aurvandil’s) Toe. Snorri Sturluson’s manual for poets, Skáldskaparmál, tellshow Thor was carrying the giant Aurvandil in a basket across the ice riverElivagar, and his toe stuck out and was frozen, so Thor broke it off and threwit into the sky, where it became a star. Another giant, Thjassi, was killed bythe Æsir, and his eyes were set in the sky as a memorial (Reuter 1985, 19, 20;Jones 1991b, 16). The stars Castor and Pollux appear to be the best candidatesfor this asterism. T. C. Lethbridge notes an English folktale collected inHorsley, Gloucestershire, which tells how the giant Wandil stole springtime, andwinter continued without end. The gods hunted him down, recovered springtime,and cast the giant into the sky as a punishment. His eyes are seen in the nightsky as Castor and Pollux (Lethbridge 1957, 71; Jones 1991b, 16–17). The MilkyWay is seen as a road in the sky: an old Germanic name is Iringsweg (Iring’sWay); English tradition calls it Ermine Street, a name of one of the Four RoyalRoads of Britain. In Welsh traditional astronomy it is Llwybr y Gwynt (the Pathof the Wind); it also has the mythological name Caer Gwdion (Gwydion’sFortress).THE FIFTEEN STARSAlthough they are known as the Fifteen Stars, they consist of fourteen majorstars and one asterism: Aldebaran, Algol, Algorab, Alphecca, Antares, Arcturus,Capella, Deneb Algedi, the Pleaides, Procyon, Regulus, Sirius, Spica, StellaPolaris, and Vega (Wega). Each of the fifteen stars expresses a particularastrological quality. Each star has a corresponding gemstone, stone, or mineraland is assigned a sigil. In astrology the given virtues of these fixed starscombine with the planets to produce harmful or benevolent outcomes. They arerarely used in modern astrology, yet in medieval times their significance wastaken into account, their sigils used magically, and as visible stars theyassisted orientation and navigation.image [../images/00019.jpeg]Fig. 4.1. Sigils of the fifteen stars. Top line, left to right: Aldebaran (theFollower); Algol (the Torch); Algorab (the Raven); Alphecca (Aurvandil’s toe);Antares (Fenris-wolf). Middle line: Arcturus (the Day Star); Capella (Goatstar); Deneb Algedi (Goat’s tail); Pleiades; Polaris (Lode Star, the Nail).Lower line: Procyon (the Torch Bearer); Regulus (the Lord); Sirius (Loki’sBrand); Spica (the Sheaf); Vega (the South Star).Aldebaran (α Tauri), the Bull’s Eye, is a red star that was one of the fourRoyal Stars of ancient Persia (with Regulus, Antares, and Fomalhaut).Astrologically, it was ascribed by Ptolemy to the nature of Mars. It rules overthe red gem Carbuncle (Ruby). Algol (β Persei) is a white binary startraditionally malefic, bringing misfortune, violence, and destruction. Itsnature is of Jupiter and Saturn. It is considered the most eminent of the stars,ruling over the Diamond. Algorab (Î´ Corvi) is another double star, purple andpale yellow. Like Algol, the Wing of the Crow, it is a malevolent star, of thenature of Mars and Saturn. Its stone is the Black Onyx. Alphecca (α CoronaeBorealis) is a brilliant white star, signifying the knot of the ribbon of theNorthern Crown. Its nature parallels Mars and Venus, bringing dignity and honor,artistic and poetic qualities. Alphecca’s stone is Topaz. Antares (α Scorpii) isa red and emerald green binary star. Its name means “rival of Mars,” and itmarks the heart of the Scorpion. It is another malevolent power, bringing ruinand destruction through obstinacy. Its stones are Amethyst and Sardonyx.Arcturus (α Boötis) is a golden-yellow star also known as the “Bear Guard”(Arktouros). It partakes of the natures of Mars and Jupiter, or alternativelyMercury and Venus, bringing wealth, honors, and fame won by self-reliance. Itscorresponding stone is Jasper.Capella (α Aurigae), the Goat Star, is a white star, of the nature of Saturn andJupiter. A beneficent star, its powers give honor, position, and wealth, and itscorrespondence is the Sapphire. Deneb Algedi (Î´ Capricorni), called thejudicial point of the Goat (Capricorn), is an equivocal star, about whom variousauthorities differ widely, hence its attributions of beneficence anddestructiveness, sorrow and happiness, life and death. Its planetarycorrespondences are Mercury and Saturn, and its gemstone is Chalcedony. ThePleiades are an asterism composed traditionally of the seven stars Alcyone,Calæno, Electra, Maia, Merope, Sterope, and Taygete. The position of the mainstar Alcyone is used in astrological calculations, and the Pleiades have thenature of the planet Mars and are considered to be disastrous, bringing illness,disaster, and death in conjunction with various planets. The Pleiades rule overthe metal Quicksilver (Mercury). Procyon (α Canis Minoris) is a yellow andyellow-white binary star, called “before the dog” because in rising it precedesthe Dog Star, Sirius. Its qualities are related to anger, carelessness, andviolent activity; its planetary correspondences are Mercury and Mars, and itsgem is Agate.Regulus (α Leonis), the King’s Star, is a triple star, white and blue-white,also known as Cor Leonis (the Lion’s heart), one of the four Royal Stars ofancient Persian astronomy. Its powers are those of Jupiter and Mars, but itbrings violence and temporary military success that ends in failure and death.Granite is the stone of Regulus. The Dog Star Sirius (α Canis Majoris) is abrilliant yellow and white binary star of the nature of Venus. It bringsfaithfulness, honor, and fame, and those born under its influence becomecustodians or guardians; its gem is Beryl. Spica or Arista (α Virginis), theGrain of Wheat, is a white binary star that partakes of the qualities of Venusallied with Mercury. Its gem is Emerald, and generally, it brings good fortune.Stella Polaris (α Ursa Minoris) is the North Star. It is a double star, palewhite and topaz yellow. Its powers are those of Venus and Saturn, andastrologically Stella Polaris brings bad fortune. Its stone is the Lodestone, anatural magnet. This star will reach its nearest point to the true pole in 2095.Finally, Vega or Wega (α Lyrae) is a pale green star. An alternative name forthis star is Vultur Cadens, the Falling Vulture. Its stone is Chrysolite, andthe star’s influence is of the nature of Venus and Mercury. Vega will become thepole star around the year 13500 CE (Robson 1969, passim).H. C. Agrippa lists the Fifteen Stars in order of their power and theirrulerships, based upon their position in their constellations, beginning withTaurus. Their order is: (1) Algol, (2) the Pleiades, (3) Aldebaran, (4) Capella,(5) Sirius, (6) Procyon, (7) Regulus, (8) Stella Polaris, (9) Algorab, (10)Spica, (11) Alchamech (Acturus), (12) Elpheia (Alphecca), (13) Antares, (14)Vega, and (15) Deneb Algedi (Agrippa 1993 [1531], I, XXXII; II, XXXI). Namesascribed to some of them by Otto Sigfrid Reuter as existing in ancient Germanicastronomy are the Torch (Algol); Alphecca (in Corona Borealis, Aurvandil’s Toe);the Day Star (Arcturus); the South Star (Vega); the Torch Bearer (Procyon);Loki’s Brand (Sirius); and Thjassi’s Eyes (Castor and Pollux) (Reuter 1985,passim).THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE HEAVENSAlthough astrological charts are now drawn in a circle, in earlier times asquare was used. The square was oriented “foursquare”; that is, with the sidesrunning north-south and east-west. Square talismans are based on this principle,with their sides conceptually oriented in line with the four directions. In thissystem there are four corners at the intercardinal directions, giving aconceptual eightfold division. The quincunx, an important sigil in magic, isalso arranged with four points in the corners of a square and another at thecenter. In northern household tradition the four corners of the building andthose of each room are seen as places where either benevolent or malevolentsprites may dwell. During construction the corners are protected with offeringsembedded in the fabric of the building, and when the building is in use, theyare periodically reconsecrated with offerings of various kinds.Medieval astrologers signified the four corners of the heavens as fourprogressive qualities: rising, midheaven (zenith), falling, and the lowest point(nadir). These correspond to the apparent places of the sun at sunrise, noon,sunset, and midnight at the equinoxes (Agrippa 1993 [1531], II, VII). Innorthern cosmology the four corners of the heavens were supported by four dwarfsNorðri, Suðri, Austri, and Vestri, who are mentioned in the list of dwarfs inGylfagynning. In European high magic the four corners were ruled over by thefour archangels: Gabriel, north; Uriel (or Nariel), south; Michael, east; andRaphael, west. Some medieval churches, such as the former gate guardian St.Botolph’s in Cambridge, have guardian figures set at the four top corners of thetower.The four corners of Iceland were supposed to have supernatural guardians.Sturluson tells a story of how the Danish king Harald Gormsson sent a magicianto Iceland in the shape of a whale to report on the island. Along the northcoast the magus perceived the land to be populated thickly with landvættir (landwights). At Vopnafjörður he tried to go ashore, but a dragon accompanied byother venomous beasts attacked him. On the south side he came to Eyjafjörður andwas attacked by a giant bird. At Breiðafjörður, a monstrous bull accompanied bya band of hostile landvættir frightened off the magus. Then at Vikarsskeiðanother landing attempt was thwarted by a mountain giant wielding an iron staff.Apart from the dragon, the guardians closely resemble the evangelical beastsfrom Christian symbolism.In Amsterdam in 1913 stone images of the four northern dwarfs were set in theceiling of the main entrance of the shipping companies’ office called HetScheepvaarthuis, a building that is an archetypal example of the AmsterdamSchool architectural style. Supporting the heavens, the dwarfs surround a metalimage of the Great Bear with the stars, including the mariners’ guiding light,the North Star, represented by electric light bulbs (Boeterenbrood and Prang1989, 101). The building is now an exclusive hotel.THE EIGHT WINDSRecorded wind lore from the north is far less coherent than in the Mediterraneanmythos. However, a particular place is given as the origin of the winds: aremote island or dangerous, forbidden mountain. According to Roman tradition,the gods set Aeolus to rule the winds under the aegis of the goddess Juno. Thewinds were kept in caverns on the mountainous isle of Lipari and contained orreleased at will by Aeolus. In ancient Gaul (modern France), the god of thewinds was Vintios, and the winds blew from his holy mountain, Mont Ventoux, inthe south of modern France. Aeolus and Vintios were tutelary deities of allthings connected with the wind. Sails, windmills, windvanes, weathercocks,washing lines, kites, illnesses carried by the wind, blown musical instruments,and the aeolian harp (whose strings produce harmonic modes) are all under therulership of wind gods. Around 50 BCE the Macedonian architect Andronikos ofCyrrhus designed the octagonal Tower of the Winds at Athens, which still stands.The classical tradition has four winds that correspond with the four cardinaldirections: Boreas, Euros, Notos, and Zephyros. We receive from Andronikos themainstream European tradition of the eight winds; the four preceding cardinalwinds and four others located at the four corners of the heavens. The eightwinds on the Tower of the Winds are, starting at the north and going sunwise,Boreas, Caecias, Apeliotes, Euros, Notos, Lips, Zephyros, and Skiron. These areknown in medieval and later cartography, compasses, and maps by their Latinnames, described by Vitruvius. The north wind is called Septentrio, the eastwind is Solanus, the south wind is Auster, and the west wind is Favonius. Theintercardinal winds are Aquilo, northeast; Eurus, southeast; Africus, southwest;and Caurus, northwest. These are the wind names that were adopted acrossnorthern Europe. The names of the winds are inappropriate as they are derivedfrom specific qualities of winds perceived at Athens and later refined insouthern Italy. The qualities of the classical winds cannot be meaningfuloutside the places where they were first recognized, yet they were used widelyto define the compass rose. Even the Spanish imperial surveyors who laid out newtowns in the Americas had the classical wind names on their plans. Old cityplans from places as far apart as St. Petersburg, Edinburgh, Stockholm, Lisbon,Milan, and Mexico City show these eight winds. In 1992 at Cambridge Universityin England, the Maitland Robinson Library, a neoclassical building, wasconstructed at Downing College. Designed by Quinlan Terry, its octagonal uppersection is a reworking of the Tower of Winds at Athens. It bears the names ofthe eight winds, carved in Greek characters. The classical eight winds are avery tenacious example of mythical continuity.In practical terms the meanings of these eight winds are useless outside theirarea of origin. Those who used the wind for their livelihoods—sailors,windmillers, and traditional healers—always had their own names for local winds,which depended on where they were. There are a few records of local wind namesin parts of Europe that actually refer to the local wind qualities. Thetraditional description of winds conserved in certain parts of France andGermany give an indication of how winds must have been perceived all over Europein former times. In Provence and along the Côte d’Azur, la rose des vents (windrose) is divided into thirty-two winds whose names vary from place to place andfrom season to season, and even according to strength. Winds recognized with thesame name come from different directions in different places as local topographydictates. For example, on the coast at Nice the summer northeast wind Grégal hasa different character in the autumn, when it is called Li Rispo. In winter,again it has a different quality, and it is called Orsuro. When it is galeforce, the northeast wind at Nice is L’Aguielon. There, the south wind isgenerally called Marin (also Miejournau, Mijournari, or Miejour), but when it issoft and fresh, L’Embat, whilst in summer it is called Li Marinado. A notablewind recognized in la rose des vents painted inside Provençal windmills iscalled Ventouresco. It is a wind held to emanate from Mont Ventoux, the Celticholy mountain of the winds, upon which Pagan pilgrims left small musical hornsas votive offerings to the god.In Germany, the Bavarian fishermen’s tradition of the lake called Ammersee hastwo parallel descriptors: one is direct descriptions, and the others are basedon the places from which the winds are blowing. The principle of naming comesfrom desired directions of sailing, or from well-recognized places in the wind’sdirection. The Ammersee is relatively small, so the wind names are less diversethan those of the Provençal winds. A northeasterly wind is called Vorderwind(front wind), a westerly is Hinterwind (back wind). Another name of theHinterwind is Schwabenwind, blowing from Swabia, west of Bavaria. A Hochwind(high wind) is a southwesterly Wessobrunner Wind in the place-directionalterminology. Winds from the south and southeast are called Sunnenwind, or thesoutheastern is called a Beuberger Wind after the place it comes from. Anortherly is a Geradeheraufwind, otherwise a Donau, from the River Danube. AQuerwind, otherwise a Zwerchwind (crosswind) is a northwesterly. In general, thewidespread Latin names were used to mean particular directions on the magneticcompass rather than to denote actual air and weather qualities, as anyone whohad to sail a ship or windmill was well aware.The Icelandic magical talisman for navigation, called a Vegvisir (waymarker) inthe Huld Manuscript, shows the eight directions denoted by different glyphs thatmay once have represented the sigils of the eight winds (Davíðsson 1903, pl.VI). According to renaissance writers on divinatory geomancy, the condition ofthe wind was taken into account before performing a divination. If it wasunfavorable, the divination could not take place. Symbolically, the Irish bardsassigned colors to the winds: the east was red; the south, white; the west,brown; and the north was black. Traditional medicine took note of the winds, forit was believed that certain winds at certain times brought illness andpestilence. The wind blowing at one’s birth also determined one’s future life,in complement to the influence of one’s natal horoscope. The first breath that ababy takes is the air from whichever wind is blowing at that moment, and thishas a lifelong effect. In Wales on Teir nos ysbrydion, the “three spiritnights,” the wind blowing over the feet of corpses (the east wind) bears sighsto the homes of those doomed to die during the coming year (Puhvel 1976, 170).In Scots tradition a red wind was an easterly to which plant blight wasattributed. A traditional English adage says, “When the wind is in the east, itis neither good for man nor beast”; equivalent Scottish sayings are “When thewind is in the east, the fisher likes it least” and “When the smoke goes west[i.e., when the wind is coming from the east], good weather is past.” AnotherScots adage tells us, “Everything looks large in an east wind,” referring todistant mountains. This one may well have its origin in the writings ofAristotle (Problems, 55): “In an east wind all visible things appear larger; ina west wind all sounds are more audible and travel further.” The influence ofclassical texts on folk sayings can never be discounted.It appears that the effect of the wind indoors was taken into account intraditional society. The wind blowing at birth affected the life of everyperson, and the wind determined the onset and progress of certain illnesses. Anindoor indicator, seemingly irrational, was used in Great Britain. There was acommon belief that a dead kingfisher, suspended from a cord, would always turnits bill in the direction of the wind. This is alluded to by Christopher Marlowin his play The Jew of Malta (1633): “But how now stands the wind? Into whatcorner peers my halcyon’s bill?” The 1878 book English Folk-Lore records stuffedkingfishers hanging from the beams of cottage ceilings to act as weather vanes,“and though sheltered from the immediate influence of the wind, never failed toshow every change by turning its beak to the quarter whence the wind blew” (Dyer1878, 76).WIND VANES, WEATHERCOCKS, AND WINDMILLSWind vanes are finely balanced artifacts that swivel on a fixed upright, drivenby the prevailing currents of wind. The wind vane appears as the final rune ofthe first ætt in the Common Germanic Futhark. It is the rune wunjo (Old Englishwyn). It signifies the function of a wind vane that moves according to thewinds, yet remains fixed in one place. Its reading is “joy,” obtained by havinga stable base but being in harmony with the surrounding conditions. In theViking Age, gilded metal weathervanes were mounted on ships, and similar oneswere set up on stave churches in Norway. A golden wind vane was on the Mora, theflagship of William of Normandy, during his cross-channel voyage to invadeEngland in 1066. A traditional motto depicted with a weathercock inseventeenth-century emblem books is, “Officium meum stabile agitare”: “It is myfunction to turn while remaining stable.”image [../images/00020.jpeg]Fig. 4.2. London St. Mary le Bow church dragon wind vane, designed by EdwardPearce, 1680. Drawing by Nigel Pennick, 2008Structurally related to the wind vane is the vertical windmill, and millers hadthe most subtle appreciation on land of wind direction and speed. Dutch millershave names for the strongest winds measuring between 7 and 9 on the BeaufortScale. Force 7–8 winds are called Blote bienen (bloody bees). All canvas must betaken from the sails when the wind is this strong. Force 8–9 winds are calledBlote bienen en geknipte nagels (bloody bees and clipped nails), and a specialcanvas must be unfurled on the sails to slow them down, for the friction ofrunaway sails against the bearings runs the risk of fire and destruction of themill. Although the Beaufort Scale was only devised in 1805, the use of specificnames for wind speeds indicates an earlier origin. The craft of sailingwindmills has been transmitted unbroken from master to apprentice from thetwelfth century until the present day.WIND MAGICThere is a very ancient tradition that magicians have the ability to control theweather. H. C. Agrippa ascribed the supposed abilities to the wonderful power ofenchantments. With a magical whispering, rivers could be turned back, the seabound, and the winds controlled (Agrippa 1993 [1531], I, LXXII). These beliefspredated Agrippa by a long time, as he quoted Apuleius, Lucan, Virgil, and Ovidas his sources. In the north it was believed possible that the winds could becontrolled by magic. Erik Edmundsson Väderhatt (“Weatherhat,” also called Ericof the Windy Hat; ca. 849–ca. 882) was a king of Sweden who was said to own amagic hat that he used to control the winds so his ship would always be able tosail where he wished. By turning his hat on his head toward the direction of adesired wind, it would start to blow. An illustration from Olaus Magnus (1655)shows the king on land, pointing to a ship, while crowned clouds are above,signifying his magical control of the weather. In northern seaports until thedemise of sailing ships, sea witches sold ropes in which they claimed they hadtied up the winds magically. Seamen who bought the charm received a rope tiedwith three knots. In the fifteenth century Ranulph Higden wrote that in the Isleof Man “is sortilege and witchcraft used; for women there sell to shipmen wynde[wind] as it were closed under three knottes of threde, so that the more wyndehe would have the more knottes he must undo” (Moore 1891, 76). These magic ropeswere considered proof against becoming becalmed. Undoing the first knot wassupposed to provide a gentle wind. The second knot undone would yield a stiffwind, but the third knot released a gale. Labyrinths were also part ofScandinavian mariners’ wind magic, used to call up the wind in the Age of Sail.A Norwegian labyrinth called Truber Slot, beside Oslo Fjord, was activatedmagically to ensure favorable winds for sailing. The method was to walk to thecenter and back out again without stumbling. According to labyrinth researcherJohn Kraft, appeasement of the deity of the northwest wind was associated withlabyrinth magic (Kraft 1986, 15)."},{"pageContent":"5Magical and Sacred Places in the LandscapeThroughout Europe, legends of the landscape express an understanding that theland is ensouled. Since antiquity, it was taught that a respectful, caringspiritual awareness of the land spirits brought plentiful harvests, healthy andproductive livestock, and a peaceful society. The traditional relationship ofpeople to the land depended upon the activities of everyday life. Differingclimates and landscapes gave each place its own character. From hunting,farming, fishing, trades, and crafts came the rites and ceremonies, festivalsand divinities. Living close to nature brought a keen awareness of all aspectsof the world. The ancient northern understanding of the sacred was “organicreligion,” multiform and polytheistic. This worldview acknowledged spirits ofthe earth, air, fire, waters, and trees, and the spirit guardians of fields andflocks.Different human activities had their spiritual protectors, especially those whohad to travel on land and sea. The spirits of the ancestral dead were present atcertain places. Ancestral holy places—homesteads, grave mounds, tombs, andbattlefields—were sites where the ancestral spirits could be venerated and askedfor assistance. There was also belief in unseen humanlike beings such as housesprites, elves, fairies, kobolds, boggarts, and trolls. Supernatural beasts suchas spectral dogs, water monsters, and dragons lurked in dangerous places. Therewere personifications of disease and death, and demons who brought bad luck andruin. All of these spirits and entities interacted with human life. Some werehelpful, some required gifts of acknowledgment to perform tasks; others had tobe placated lest they brought disaster. Religious and magical rites served tocommunicate with spirits and interact with them. Every place had an innatespiritual quality that the Romans recognized as the genius loci, the spirit ofthe place.image [../images/00021.jpeg]Fig. 5.1. The Long Man of Wilmington. Chalk hill figure, Wilmington, Sussex,England.Landscape features deemed sacred are hills and mountains, volcanoes, springs,rivers and lakes, ravines and caves, notable rocks and exceptional trees. Eachfeature has its particular marks of veneration. Devotees ritually ascended holyhills on days dedicated to sky gods. Valuable items were thrown into lakes andsprings as thanksgiving or propitiation of the lake spirits. Sacred trees weresurrounded by protective fences. They were bedecked with garlands and ribbons,and food was left for their guardian sprites. Stopping places along tracks androads had shrines to local gods, places where wayfarers could give thanks forhaving gotten there safely and ask for protection on the road ahead. Storieswere—and are still—told about events that happened at particular places, whichgave them their names. The names of gods, heroes, saints, and villains, recordsof magical happenings and accidents, all appear as place names.image [../images/00022.jpeg]Fig. 5.2. Mountain shapes according to medieval planetary correspondences.Sometimes, the genii loci were not localized at a particular spot on the ground.In ancient times deities of whole forests were venerated, such as Vosegos,Celtic god of the Vosges in Alsace (modern France), and Abnoba, goddess of theSchwarzwald (Black Forest, south Germany). Every river had its goddess orsprite, and many still bear the names. The river Severn in England recalls thegoddess Sabrina, while in France the rivers Seine and Saône are named for thegoddesses Sequana and Souconna. River deities were honored with festivals andsacrifices. Contemporary folklore tells how the indwelling spirit of certainrivers requires the loss of at least one human life a year. One of them is theRiver Trent in the Midlands of England, whose dangerous tidal bore ispersonified as the Eager, a name recalling the Norse sea god Ægir. The riverEider in north Germany was called Ægir’s Door (Ellis-Davidson 1964, 128).ICELANDimage [../images/00002.jpeg]A Medieval Pagan landscapeBecause of the unique history of the island, the nature of the pre-Christiannorthern European sacred landscape is recorded in Icelandic literature. Duringthe ninth and tenth centuries, the previously uninhabited island of Iceland wascolonized by settlers. They came mainly from Norway and the Western Isles ofScotland and were predominantly Pagan in outlook. Their spiritual response tothe landscape is recorded in Landnámabók, the book of settling the land. Thesettlers were intensely aware of the spiritual nature of the landscape, andcertain areas were deemed spiritually inappropriate for settlement. These placeswere the territories of the landvættir (land wights), the spirits of place.Ceremonies were performed in honor of these landvættir, and offerings left forthem. Landnámabók records an example where Thorvald Holbarki went to Surtur’scave and recited a poem in honor of a giant that resided there. The mountainHelgafell was designated as holy, and, before praying facing toward it, devoteeswashed their faces out of respect. These and other instances of spiritualrecognition in Icelandic documents tell much about the religious practices thatexisted across northern Europe in Pagan times.The island of Iceland was divided up into religious jurisdictions, ruled over bysacred officials called goðar (singular: goði) who officiated at religious ritesand ceremonies. They were not comparable with later Christian priests, as theoffice of goði was held by a priest of a tribe or clan who had a certain sacredplace in common. Goðar were never full-time officials, for they were hereditarylandowners who had the duty to maintain the ancestral holy places. TheAllsherjargoði, the high priest of Iceland, was the direct descendent of thefirst settler, Ingulf Arnarson. He was in charge of the temple at Kialarnes.Iceland was divided into four quarters, each containing three jurisdictions,which were further subdivided into three goðorð (the name for the priestlyoffice itself). Each goðorð had a goði who lived at a particular holy place andwas its guardian, but not necessarily its owner. The public temples weresometimes owned by women. The office of dewar, keeper of ancestral sacredthings, continued in Scotland and Ireland in a Christian context until thenineteenth century and remains as a surname of Scottish origin.PLACES OF WORSHIP HOFS AND TEMPLESThe ancestral spirits (Old Norse dísir) were worshipped collectively at specialplaces, often holy hills recalled today in Germany by names such as Disenberg orDisibodenberg. Offerings were made to the ancestresses at these places for thegood fortune of the family and the fecundity of flocks and fields. There werealso holy places of Germanic and Norse religion that had no particular naturalfeature. They were marked by standing stones, poles, wooden images, andsemi-open sacred pavilions and spirit sheds. The Anglo-Saxon wíh was a basicsacred image standing in the open. More substantial was a shrine on “a rockyoutcrop” (Old Norse hörgr; Old English hearg), which may have been covered witha tent or pavilion (Old English træf ). In Scandinavia and Scandinaviancolonies, communal worship took place in the hof, an ordinary hall-formfarmhouse that had a special extension, the afhús, where sacred objects andimages were kept. Here, regular festivals to mark the passing of the seasonswere observed. There were also purpose-built temples (höfuð-hof ). Each January,Scandinavians celebrated a collective festival of the dísir called Dísarblót onsacred hills and at temples erected to venerate them.The development of Norse temples (and perhaps also Frisian and Anglo-Saxon ones)from the nobleman’s hall (hof ) or farmhouse where sacred rites were conductedis clear. The northern hof was a sanctified part of an ordinary farmhousebelonging to the local goði. In later times, the religious parallel was theChristian chapel that was an integral part of the castle or larger manor house.The first Norwegian settlers of Iceland (ca. 870–930 CE) transported templebuildings there from Norway. The Eyrbyggja Saga tells how, after performing adivination, the goði Thorolf Mostur-skeggi dismantled his temple and shipped it,with the earth beneath it, from Norway to Iceland. The earth floor had receivedthe libations and offerings made in the temple, so it had to be taken along withthe timber building. The new temple site was decided by divination. As his shipapproached the Icelandic coast, Thorolf threw the high seat pillars, on one ofwhich was carved an image of the god Thor, into the sea. Where the tides broughtthem ashore, there he reerected the temple.The temple that Thorolf Mostur-skeggi “let be raised” was described as a greathouse, with the entrance in one of the sidewalls by the far end, the same layoutas that in later medieval churches. Inside, before the door, were the high-seatpillars that the sea had brought ashore there. They had “god-nails” driven intothem. At the center of the temple, the images of the gods stood on a platform(Eyrbyggja Saga 4; Kjalnesinga Saga 2). The Eyrbyggja Saga is not contemporarywith the ritual relocation of Thorolf’s temple, but it seems to preserve localtradition reliably, though it was probably written at Helgafell monastery in thelate twelfth or early thirteenth century (Ellis-Davidson 1993, 102–3). Manyearly Christian churches were built over Pagan sacred places when the oldreligion was destroyed, though the spirit of what went before is stilldiscernable at some of them more than a thousand years later. Places that couldnot be appropriated by the church had their indwelling spirits redefined asharmful demons and evil spirits and were shunned as dangerous locations.ROYAL AND SACRED ROADSIn northern Europe, roads are ascribed to great kings of legendary history. Thismythos viewed them not as disconnected individual roads but as a systematicinfrastructure. Geoffrey of Monmouth’s History of the Kings of Britain (ca.1136) recounts how the roads of Britain were constructed on the orders ofBelinus, king of the ancient Britons. According to Geoffrey, Belinus orderedfour paved roads to be built across Britain that led in straight lines betweencities (Geoffrey 1966, 93). These were known as the Four Royal Roads of Britain.They were protected in law against anyone who committed an act of violence uponthem, a stricture added to the earlier Molmutine Laws that historically weretranslated from Old Welsh into Latin by the historian Gildas (sixth century) andincorporated into English law by King Alfred the Great in the ninth century(Geoffrey 1966, 93–94). Ireland, too, had royal roads. Tara of the Kings(Teamhair na Riogh) was the ancient royal capital of Ireland, and its mostsacred and sovereign place. The Five Royal Roads of Ireland radiated from Tara.Slige Midluachra ran to Emain Macha near Armagh in the north; to the northwestran Slige Asal; to the mid-west, Slige Mór connected Tara with Uisnech, the“Navel of Ireland,” where stood the omphalos, and on to Galway on the westcoast. Slige Dála linked Tara to Tipperary in the southwest, and to the south,Slige Cualainn, ran to Bohernabreena, south of Dublin. Like their counterpartsin Great Britain, these Royal Roads had a spiritual dimension that guaranteedroyal protection of those traveling along them.According to the thirteenth-century chronicler Roger of Wendover, theseventh-century English king Eadwin (Edwin) of Northumbria (northern England andsouthern Scotland) employed an astrologer, Pellitus, to advise him. Eadwin,founder of the city of Edinburgh, was said to have made the roads so safe thateven a woman laden with gold could travel in safety. Alongside the roads, helaid pipes to supply travelers with drinking water (Giles 1849, I, 79–80). InSweden the legendary King Onund the Land-Clearer was credited with creating thecountry’s roads. In Ynglingasaga (37) Sturluson recounts: “Onund had roads madethrough all Sweden, both through forests and bogs, and also over the mountains;therefore he was called Onund Road-Maker.” The time of King Onund, Sturlusontells us, was notable for fruitful seasons, occasioned by his clearing offorests for cultivation. A historic road-making northern king was Harald BlåtandGormsson (Harald Bluetooth) of Denmark (ca. 935–ca. 986). Around the year 980 CEhe ordered the surveying and construction of a highway along the Jutland Ridge,avoiding crossing most rivers. This road was called Hærvejen (military road) orOksevejen (cattle road). Narrower roads ran from the Jutland Highway to the maintowns. Harald also built six circular fortresses, laid out by his surveyors andconstructed with precise accuracy (Nørlund 1948, 14). The historic King Edward Iof England (reigned 1272–1307) followed the mythic image of the great northernking by a systematic roadside clearance of forests to rid the country of thethreat of highway robbers.MOVEMENTThe Laxdœla Saga, a thirteenth-century tale of the people of Laxardale inIceland, recounts the rites and ceremonies of moving from an old farm to a newone. There is a ritual form. The smaller animals make up the head of theprocession, then the more valuable cattle, and finally the beasts of burden leftthe farm. The drove was arranged so that the small animals arrived at the newfarm at the time the beasts of burden were leaving the old farm with thehousehold goods (Hasenfratz 2011, 67). The procession had to be on a directpath, and there were no gaps in it, maintaining continuity between the old andthe new. A crooked path would serve as a binding knot that would disrupt thesuccess of the new venture. This magical principle of directness is found fivehundred years later in the rituals of a powerful Scottish rural fraternity, theSociety of the Horseman’s Grip and Word: here the candidate for initiation wastaken deliberately indirectly by the “crooked path,” “the hooks and crooks ofthe road,” which severed his contact with his former life as a nonmember (Rennie2009, 1, 86). Once he was initiated as a horseman, he would no longer becrooked, but always plough his rigs (furrows) straight.PAGAN TRACKWAYS AND SPIRIT PATHSIn certain landscapes local people recognized invisible otherworldly paths thatran across the country between notable features associated with the spirits ofthe land. These may have been tracks on which religious processions took placein Pagan times. The Capitularia Regum Francorum, dating from the days when theFrankish kings were attempting to destroy non-Christian belief and practices,refers to the “Pagan trackway” called yries marked by rags and shoes, alongwhich processions were made. These tracks were among “the irregular places whichthey cherish for their ceremonies.” A “Pagan trackway” of the Viking Age existsin Sweden as the “cult road” at Rösaring, associated at its southern end with astone labyrinth and a burial-ground contemporary with the road. It is about 10feet (3 m) wide, has a north-south orientation, and running along the top of aridge for 600 yards (550 m).In Ireland some people who suffered misfortunes and ill health believed it wascaused by living in a house built at a “contrary place.” The worst contraryplace to be was on a path where the fairy procession traveled. Building on afairy path is fraught with danger, for the fairies process along it at certaintimes of the year and will punish anyone who has blocked the way. In Ireland,Paddy Baine built his house with its corner across a fairy path. The house wasdisturbed, so he consulted a woman who knew about such matters, who advised himto remove the corner, which he did, after which all was well (Michell 1975, 88).Fairy paths sometimes pass beneath buildings constructed across the way, leavingthe right of way unobstructed. This feature is called a closs in Scotland. OnDartmoor in the west of England, an ancient track called the Mariners’ Way runsthrough the central passage of an ancient traditional longhouse at West Combe.In south Wales it was considered risky to build a cottage in or near the placewhere an elder tree grew. Elder trees have equivocal magical attributes and areassociated with the fairies (Trevelyan 1909, 316). Naturally, fairy trees arelocated at places on fairy paths. W. Y. Evans Wentz notes that fairies were heldto be the spirits of the departed (Wentz 1911, 33). In Scots belief the pathswere used by the Fairy Rade, the fairies’ expedition on May Day to attend theirgreat annual feast (Warrack 1988 [1911], 163).The fairies’ journeys along their well-defined tracks resemble the morefrightening appearance of the Wild Hunt (Wilde Jagd). It was an appearance of aband of terrifying huntsmen thought to ride through the land on dark, wildhorses. Accompanied by hellhounds, the hunt rode in pursuit across thelandscape, either in the air or on the ground, especially during the wintermonths. The hunt is known all over northern and central Europe, and some of thenames reflect the being or entity supposed to lead it, or the hounds that runwith the hunters. In Old English it was Herlaþing (assembly of Herla); in OldFrench, Mesnée d’Hellequin (Hellequin’s household); in Welsh, Cŵn Annwn (dogs ofthe underworld; hellhounds); and in later English lore, the Devil’s Dandy Dogsand Gabriel Ratchets. The latter hunt is led by the Spectre Huntsman, and thenoise of the yelping hounds is a portent of bad luck or death to those who hearit (Harland and Wilkinson 1867, 89).A Norwegian name for the wild hunt is jolareidi, linking it with Jul (Yule),midwinter. A story told in a folksong collected from Telemarken, Norway, in theeighteenth century recalls the wild hunt called Åsgårdsrei. The word Åsgårdsreiappears to be related to the Old Norse word öskranligr, meaning “fearful,” andrei, a procession on horseback, hence the “fearful procession” or “terror-ride”(Gjerset 1915, II, 97). Also the connexion with Asgard, the abode of the gods,is apparent. This spectral procession consisted of the spirits of the dead whoin their lives were not evil enough to be condemned to hell, but who remainedunsettled spirits after death. This is one of the ideas held in Celtic countriesabout the fairies. Thor (seen as an evil spirit), Gudrun, and Sigurd (the slayerof Fafnir) are the leading figures of the Åsgårdsrei as it travels through theair to places where fights and murders occur, to fetch the souls of thosekilled. After dark, people feared to stand outdoors in case the Åsgårdsreishould appear and abduct them. The apotropaic sign of the cross on the housedoor warded off the Åsgårdsrei (Gjerset 1915, II, 97).Coffin paths and roads of the dead are paths along which dead people werecarried to the church, especially in mountainous terrain where homesteads andsmall groups of houses had no consecrated burial ground. The lore of coffinpaths has features in common with spirit ways. In lowland areas coffin pathsavoided houses and roads and crossed as few fields as possible. This was said tominimize the blighting effect of death on living and growing things (Tebbutt1984, 17). In Britain road names such as Burial Lane, Corpse Lane, and Lych Waydenote these deathly paths. It was a common belief that the act of using a pathfor a funeral somehow dedicated it as a public right of way. At the funeral of agardener at Girton, Cambridge, in 1936, the pallbearers insisted that becausethey had carried a coffin with a corpse through Girton College from one gate toanother, the path must now be a public right of way (Porter 1969, 30). A Welshfuneral custom had the pallbearers carrying the coffin put it down at eachcrossroads they came to and say a prayer (Trevelyan 1909, 275). Over the borderin the Golden Valley of Herefordshire, England, Ella Mary Leather recorded thecustom in 1912. The coffin was taken on a roundabout way to the church, and itwas put down for a few moments at every crosssroads, the mourners standing still(Leather 1912, 122).THE FAINTY GRUNDPeople living a traditional, self-reliant life without powered machines and thebackup of rescue services have a subtle recognition of all conditions aroundthem. The recognition of debilitating places was a feature of traditional lifein Scotland and Ireland. In Ireland such places were seen as a kind of fairygrass. The Scots fainty grund and the Irish fear gortha (“hungry grass” or“hunger-stricken earth”) signified ground where one felt faint. In Scotland itwas deemed necessary to carry a piece of bread in the pocket when going to sucha place, and in Ireland is a record of a woman who always kept some porridge ina pot ready to help wayfarers who succumbed to the harmful place (Warrack 1988[1911], 162). In her Ancient Legends, Mystic Charms, and Superstitions ofIreland, Lady Wilde said of the Fair-Gortha, the harmful “hunger-stricken sod”:“if the hapless traveler accidently treads on this grass by the roadside, whilepassing on a journey, either by night or day, he becomes at once seized with themost extraordinary cravings of hunger and weakness, and unless timely relief isafforded he must certainly die” (Wilde 1887, II, 69).Wilde also wrote of another herb, or fairy grass, called the Faud Shaughran (the“stray sod”):Whoever treads the path it grows on is compelled by an irresistible impulse totravel on without stopping, all through the night, delirious and restless, overbog and mountain, through hedges and ditches, till wearied and bruised and cut,his garments torn, his hands bleeding, he finds himself in the morning twenty orthirty miles, perhaps, from his own home . . . those who fall under this strangeinfluence have all the time the sensation of flying and are utterly unable topause or turn back or change their career. There is, however, another herb thatcan neutralize the effects of the Faud Shaughran, but only the initiated canutilize its mystic properties. (Wilde 1887, II, 68–69)"},{"pageContent":"6Boundaries and Liminal SpacesBORDERLINESBoundaries are primarily about ownership. Property rights—whether private,public, sacred, or otherworldly—define the meaning of areas in culture and inlaw. Those who claim ownership to areas can bar access to the latter by thosewhom the owners consider have no right to be there. This principle applies toareas defined as human property as well as those deemed to be in the ownershipof spiritual beings. Access to space has always been controlled carefully in allcivilizations. Concepts of belonging to the group, ritual cleanliness, personalworthiness, and status are necessary for one to have access to an area, whetherit be national territory, a private club, or the inner sanctum of a temple. Fromantiquity, religious buildings have been made in forms considered worthy to bethe indwelling places of gods and goddesses, and the boundaries around them havebeen policed to prevent access by those considered profane.Boundaries are lines of division between areas perceived by humans as distinctfrom one another. Boundaries can be invisible or visible lines of demarcationthat distinguish and define relationships between different areas in contactwith one another. They can be natural or artificial, passable or impassable.Natural boundaries such as rivers, unclimbable ridges, mountains, and seas areobvious to everyone. They are barriers to everything that moves on land. Onlyflying creatures may cross them without problems. Because boundaries inthemselves are the interface between two distinct areas, they are difficultplaces. The problems of physical boundaries are self-evident. It is not easy tocross a river without a boat, a bridge over it, or a tunnel beneath it. To crossa mountain range needs a pass, which may be impassable because of snow inwintertime. These natural boundaries are geographical realities with which humanbeings must deal. Human-made boundaries, though arbitrary, are invested with thecharacteristics of natural boundaries, usually backed up with violence, impliedor actual.Human-made boundaries are intended to mark the point where the area belonging to“us” becomes the area belonging to “them.” So they are always potential placesof contention and strife. Many fights between neighbors and wars between gangs,tribes, and nations begin as border disputes. Historically, all boundaries wereill defined and ever changing. The history of the boundaries between clan,tribal, ethnic, religious, feudal, and national areas in northern Europe is socomplex that much of it is unknowable. One thing is clear: human-made boundariesare not fixed forever. They are a process rather than a thing; they areessentially arbitrary and transient. In historical terms they do not last long.Even when they are visibly of profane origin, boundaries have a magicalfunction. They form a conceptual barrier against the “other,” a line over whichthe “other” must not cross on pain of physical or supernatural retribution. Inthis way they are comparable to the circles made by magicians, whichtheoretically create magic boundaries that enclose and protect the operatorwhilst preventing any summoned entities from entering and doing harm.The origin of geometry (geometria) in land surveying is apparent in the worditself: geo- (earth) + metria (measurement). Fixing property boundaries,locating boundary markers, and verifying them required practical methods thatwould be transparent in their function, easily resolving disputes betweenneighbors. Ritual redefinition and magical reempowerment of boundaries wasnecessary, and annual public perambulation of the boundaries of villages andfields was a feature of life. In Pagan times, circumambulation of fields with animage of a god or goddess, stopping at marker points, was continued in aChristian context with the rituals of “beating the bounds” in medieval andpostmedieval times. In the fourth century CE, the repaganization of the Gothiclands was accomplished by a perambulation of divine images around boundaries.The Greek Orthodox chronicler Socrates recorded that between 369 and 372 CE theGoths rejected missionary attempts to make them convert to the Arian sect ofChristianity, expelling the missionaries and expecting Christians to attendpublic rites and ceremonies. King Athanaric stated that the Goths’ ancestralreligion was being debased and ordered the Gothic territories be reconsecratedby a xoanon (the Greek word for a carved cult image) perambulated around eachsettlement. Gothic xoana were images consisting of a human head carved on apost, such as those well known from the temples of the Baltic. By making acircuit of the boundary, everything within it was reconsecrated. A Byzantinetriumphal arch set up in Constantinople had a carving of this event, showing thexoana carried on camels. The image in figure 6.1 is from Imperium Orientale byA. Banduri, published in Venice in 1729.image [../images/00023.jpeg]Fig. 6.1. Gothic repaganization of the land by xoana carried on camels. TheLibrary of the European TraditionIn the north of England, a comparable sacred perambulation was made by Christianmonks with the bones of Bishop Cuthbert, who died in 687 CE and was buried atLindisfarne. In the year 875 the inhabitants of the monastery fled a Danishmilitary invasion, “the wicked army of the unbelievers.” Bishop Eardulph and hismonks fled with their treasure, books, ritual paraphernalia, and the bones ofCuthbert. Then they carried his bones round the northlands for seven years.Churches were founded at many places where they stopped. This ritualperambulation was first to Elsdon and down the River Rede to Haydon Bridge, thenup the South Tyne to Beltinghame, then along the road by Hadrian’s Wall toBewcastle. From there they turned south to Salkeld and went by way of Eden Halland Plumbland into Lancashire and the River Derwent. Then northward to Whithorn,on the Galloway coast, then southward again across Stainmoor into Teesdale. FromCotherstone the trail ran through Marske, Forcett, and Barton to Craike Abbeynear Easingwold. The entourage stayed there four months before they resumedtheir travels, going to Chester-le-Street. The destroyed monastery was refoundedthere, Cuthbert was reburied, and Chester-le-Street became the seat of theBishop of Bernicia.Boundary markers were always taken seriously, and means enacted to maintainthem. There is a biblical curse on boundary movers, and even supernaturalsanctions against those who tamper with boundaries. Von Schaewen’s Dissertatiophysica de igne fatuus (1714) tells that in Germany the sprite called Feuermann(“Fireman”) appeared carrying a red-hot measuring rod on a chain and riding on ahorse of fire pulling a red-hot plough. He came to punish those who movedboundary markers. But even when boundaries are seemingly obvious, there are waysaround them. There is an English tradition from Lincolnshire that tells us, “Ifa person sells his soul to the Devil, to be delivered at a certain specifiedtime, the vendor, if wary, may avoid payment by putting in the contract ‘be itin the house or out of the house’ and then when the time arrives, sittingastride on a window sill or standing in a doorway” (Peacock 1877, I, 84). Thenthe Devil is thwarted. While this is an amusing story, it teaches that one mustbe precise in definitions, and that being on the liminal space of a boundary isto be neither inside nor outside.THE MAGIC OF CROSSROADS, BURIALS, MAGIC, AND SPELLSCrossroads are places of transition, where the axis linking the underworld withthe upper world intersects this world on which we walk. As with all liminalplaces, the crossing of roads is a place of physical and spiritual dangers. Herethe distinction between the physical and nonmaterial worlds appears uncertain,and the chance of encountering something Otherworldly is more likely than atother places. In the Roman Empire, crossroads were acknowledged with a herm, animage of the god of traffic and trade, Mercury. This god, who indicates theright road and guides the traveler’s footsteps, was the generalization of theparticular spirit of each individual crossroads. Woden (Odin), as god of thecrossroads, was in this aspect similar to Mercury, and later Christians set upstone crosses where the Roman herms or posts sacred to Odin had once stood. AsHangatýr (God of the Hanged), Odin was the god of the gallows, and often gallowsand gibbets were set up at crossroads for the execution of criminals. In Englanduntil 1823 the bodies of people hanged there were often buried at thecrossroads.Burials at liminal places, including roadsides, parish boundaries, andcrossroads, are common in English folk tradition. Bob Trubshaw noted that manyAnglo-Saxon Pagan burials are found near parish boundaries, which may postdatethem (Trubshaw 1995, 4–5). Until the nineteenth century, crossroads werefavorite places of execution in England, as the crossroads place-name CaxtonGibbet in Cambridgeshire attests. The bodies of the hanged were buried close by,often under the road surface itself, as they were not allowed in consecratedground. The records of crossroads burials in England go back to the sixteenthcentury: a parish record from Pleasley in Derbyshire from 1573 tells how a manfound hanged was buried at midnight at the highest crossroads in the districtwith a stake in him (Roud 2003, 443). Until 1823, under Church of England rules,suicides, Nonconformists, Quakers, Jews, Gypsies, outcasts, and executedcriminals were not permitted to be given burial in consecrated ground (Stephen1868, 152ff). The practice was abolished finally by an Act of Parliament (4 Geo.4, ca. 52, 1823) that also prohibited the custom of hammering a stake throughthe body.People who killed themselves were thought to become earthbound spirits,dangerous to living people (Tebbutt 1984, 17), and a stake was driven through asuicide’s body to prevent the person from walking as a revenant. In his Historiarerum Anglicarum (ca. 1190) William of Newburgh tells how the corpses of thedead could come forth from their graves, wander about to terrorize and attackthe living, and return again to the grave. He tells of a case inBuckinghamshire, England, where a dead man left his grave and attacked hiswidow, then her family and neighbors. The revenant was laid by a Christiancleric, who wrote a text and put it upon the corpse to bind it in the grave(William of Newburgh 1861, 5, 24). In Iceland is a tradition that a magiciancould activate a draugr (revenant) and send it to attack someone (Solheim 1958,298). A magical text published almost 700 years later in 1903 by ÓlafurDavíðsson gives a remedy using a magnet for those suffering from draugablettir,“ghost spots” caused by the touch of a draugr sent to get them (Davíðsson 1903;Flowers 1992, 102).The custom of driving a stake through the body as binding magic to prevent thedraugr from walking and doing harm to the living is recounted in thethirteenth-century text Eiríks Saga Rauða. It tells how in the Norse colony inGreenland bodies were buried provisionally at the place where they died untilthey could be taken for burial in Christian sacred ground. The provisionalburial involved a stake being hammered through the chest as a magical precautionagainst the deceased’s becoming a draugr. When the corpse was exhumed so itcould be taken for Christian burial, the stake was removed, and consecratedwater poured into the space where it had been (Hasenfratz 2011, 70). In ancientGermany, Iceland, and England, the corpse of a criminal was treated in the sameway, with a stake through the body, and Grettis Saga tells that heavy stoneswere laid upon it and also other magical bindings, including wicker hurdles andbinding knots of wool to bind the ghost (Tacitus 1959, 28–29). A typical examplefrom nineteenth-century England is from The Peterborough Weekly Gazette, July30, 1814: “an unknown man found dying of poison, self administered, inGodmanchester, was buried at the crossroads leading to Offord.” Suicides andexecuted criminals were often buried at the same crossroads, as an account fromNorwich in Norfolk and Norwich Notes and Queries (August 15, 1896) attests: “R.M. L.” tells how his father remembered “seeing a suicide carried past his houseat twelve at night, to be buried at the cross roads at Hangman’s Lane. Animmense crowd followed, to see the stake driven though the body.”In England trees growing at crossroads were reputed to have grown from stakesdriven through the bodies of murderers and suicides. A typical example was atRedenhall, Norfolk, where a willow tree called Lush’s Bush, said to have grownfrom a stake, marked the grave of a suicide. In 1813 another suicide, MaryTurrell, was buried there and had a stake hammered through her heart by theparish constable (Halliday 2010, 84). The Cruel Tree at Buckden inHuntingdonshire, felled in 1856, was much feared as a place of bad luck. It wasreputed to have grown from a stake driven through the body of a murderer whosuffered burial at a classic liminal place: the crossroads of the Great NorthRoad and Mere Lane on the parish boundary of Brampton and Buckden (Tebbutt 1984,18). Another sort of outcast buried in the road in England was women reputed tobe witches. In 1915 Catherine Parsons reported that in Cambridgeshire theHorseheath woman known as Daddy Witch was buried in the middle of the roadopposite the hovel where she had lived. The place was marked by an unusualdryness of the road, reputed to be caused by the heat from her body (Parsons1915, 39). The Horseheath Women’s Institute Scrapbook for 1935 states that onemust nod one’s head nine times for good luck before passing over Daddy Witch’sgrave (Porter 1969, 163). At nearby Bartlow was a bump at a crossroads where awitch was said to be buried (Porter 1969, 161).Crossroads were places of divination. A custom to ask questions of the dead waspracticed in Denmark. One had to go to crossroads at midnight on New Year’s Eveand stand inside the square made by the intersection of cart tracks. Then thequerent had to call out the name of a dead person, and he or she would appearand answer three questions (Kamp 1877, 390). It was believed in Wales that oneach of the teir nos ysbrydion (the “three spirit nights”: May Eve, St. John’sEve, Hallowe’en) one could go to a crossroads and listen to what the wind wassaying. It was a way of finding out the most important things that would happenduring the forthcoming year (Trevelyan 1909, 236). The same rite existed inGermany, where, as in Denmark, the individual had to go to a crossroads on NewYear’s Eve, sit on an animal skin, and listen for what was to happen (Grimm1888, III, 1115). This recalls the ancient Norse practice of útiseta (sittingout) where a person sat out at night under the stars on the skin of a sacrificedanimal to hear inner voices or the voices of spirits. Sacrifices at crossroadsalso appeared in the trial of Dame Alice Kyteler as a witch in Kilkenny,Ireland, in 1324. Among other accusations, “they offered in sacrifice to demonsliving animals, which they dismembered, and then distributed at crossroads to acertain evil spirit of low rank, named the Son of Art” (Seymour 1913, 27). Inthe nineteenth century black cats were still being sacrificed at crossroads inDenmark. The animal was buried there and dug up again when decomposed so that aneck bone could be recovered and worn as a ring that supposedly conferredinvisibility (Kristensen 1885, III, 72).The crossroads is a “favorite place to divest oneself of diseases or other evilinfluences” (Crooke 1909, 88). In northern magic it is customary to rid oneselfof used materia magica at the crossroads. Objects believed to be bewitched wereburned at crossroads (Stracherjan 1867, 358). Among other dangerous powers, thecrossroads conducts away the baneful energy of the evil eye, dispersing it tothe four quarters of the world, so preventing it from injuring the person orobject of its focus. The ague, warts, and other diseases have been the object ofrites and spells at crossroads. A tradition recorded in Shropshire is that aperson suffering from warts must rub an ear of wheat against each wart, wrap thewheat ears in a piece of paper, then throw it away at a crossroads. The wartswould disappear, being transferred to whoever found the piece of paper andpicked it up (Burne 1883, 200).Under Christian influence, despite the cross’s being a Christian emblem, thecrossroads became associated with the evil spirits and the Devil. In the Alpsthe entity called Schratl was called up magically by a crossroads ritual. Onehad to write one’s name on a piece of paper, sign it with one’s own blood, putit in a box, catch two black beetles, imprison them in the box with the paper,and take it to a crossroads. Then Schratl would appear in the form of a huntsmanand offer to fulfill one’s desires (Puhvel 1976, 172). Welsh folk beliefasserted that on May Eve witches dance at crossroads with the Devil (Trevelyan1909, 152). The crossroads Devil appears in an Irish spell titled How to havemoney always, as recounted in 1887 by Lady Wilde: “Kill a black cock, and go tothe meeting of three crossroads where a murderer is buried. Throw the dead birdover your left shoulder then and there, after nightfall, in the name of theDevil, holding a piece of money in your hand all the while. And ever after, nomatter what you spend, you will always find the same piece of money undiminishedin your pocket” (Wilde 1887, II, 82–83).Tales of the German magician Doctor Faustus say that he went to a crossroads ina forest near Wittenberg to raise the Devil: “toward evening, at a crossroads inthese woods, he drew certain circles with his staff; thus in the night betweennine and ten o’clock he did conjure the Devil.” The crossroads features as thelocus of a central European magical tradition of making magic bullets that arecertain to hit the target. The rite also involved summoning the Devil (oranother infernal spirit) there and casting the bullets under his supervision.Carl Maria von Weber’s 1821 opera Der Freischütz, based upon genuine folktradition, includes a scene where magic bullets are cast at a crossroads. Likemuch of northern magic, it has a numerical element:Now the blessing of the bullets! [Bowing to the earth in each of three pauses]Protect us, you who watch in darkness! Samiel, Samiel! Give ear! Stand by me inthis night until the spell is complete! Bless for me the herb and lead, blessthem by seven, nine and three, that the bullet be obedient! Samiel, Samiel, tome!It is clearly the demon Samael that Weber intended to portray. According toHeinrich Cornelius Agrippa, Samael is the Prince of the Accusers, the devil offire in the infernal world. In Jewish magic he is one of the three princes ofGehenna, the place in the north that stores all fire, ice, snow, hailstones,violent winds, and darkness (Agrippa 1993 [1531], II, VII; III, XXIV).THE GOODMAN’S GROUNDIn northern Europe in medieval and later times was a tradition of setting asidepieces of land that neither spade nor plough was allowed to touch. Typically,they were triangular corners of fields, dedicated by the farmer who promisednever to till the earth there. Inside the boundary the pristine condition of theearth prior to its tilling by man is preserved. There, the land wights stillhave a place to be, and the former “wilderness” is remembered. In Englanduncultivated triangular pieces of ground at a trifinium, the center of thejunction of three country roads, were frequently called no-man’s-land, inferringtheir ownership by nonhuman entities. Some of them still have stone crosses thatmay denote the Christianization of a place considered to be eldritch.There were forerunners of this practice in Pagan times; the Scandinavian sacredenclosure called a vé is an example. The vé was a triangular enclosure, setaside from the everyday world by a row of bautasteinar (uninscribed standingstones) or a fence called the vébond. The Danish royal sanctuary at Jelling wassuch a vé (Dyggve 1954, 221ff.).The vé was primarily a place for rites and ceremonies. After the Christianchurch became dominant, these were deemed heathen practices and were forbidden.In northern Europe early Christian legislation forbade people specifically fromworshipping at groves, at stones, in sanctuaries, and at places designatedstafgarðr (fenced enclosures) (Olsen 1966, 280). Elder trees (Sambucus nigra)often grow in such places, such as the grounds containing Siberian “spiritsheds,” and veneration of this kind of tree was specifically prohibited as a“heathendom” in England by a law of King Edgar (reigned 959–75 CE). Helmold’sChronicle (1156) records that the sacred grove of the Slavonic god Prove atStargard (Szczeciński) in Pomerania, was enclosed by a fence (Váňa 1992, 178,fig. 44). In the Polish countryside to this day, one can see crosses by theroadside and at “no-man’s-land” triangles, with fences around them.image [../images/00024.jpeg]Fig. 6.2. Runestone in the vé at Jelling, Denmark.Under Christian influence these tracts of sacred land became associated with theDevil. Eldritch field corner triangles in Scotland are called the Old Guidman’sGround, the Gudeman’s Croft, the Halieman’s Ley, the Halyman’s Rig, the BlackFaulie, the Auld Man’s Fold, Clootie’s Croft, and the Gi’en Rig. The plethora ofrecorded names shows how widespread the practice was; in Scots all but thelatter are “eke-names” or bynames of the Devil. Sir Walter Scott, in his Letterson Demonology and Witchcraft, noted “though it was not expressly avowed, no onedoubted that ‘the gudeman’s croft’ was set apart for some evil being; in fact,that it was the portion of the arch-fiend himself . . . this was so general acustom that the Church published an ordinance against it as an impious andblasphemous usage.” Scott continued:This singular custom sunk before the efforts of the clergy in the seventeenthcentury; but there must still be many alive who, in childhood, have been taughtto look with wonder on knolls and patches of ground left uncultivated, because,whenever a ploughshare entered the soil, the elementary spirits were supposed totestify their displeasure by storm and thunder. Within our own memory, many suchplaces, sanctified to barrenness by some favorite popular superstition, existed,both in Wales and Ireland, as well as in Scotland; but the high price ofagricultural produce during the late war [Napoleonic War] renders it doubtful ifa veneration for greybearded superstition has suffered any one of them to remainundesecrated. For the same reason the mounts called Sith Bhruaith wererespected, and it was deemed unlawful and dangerous to cut wood, dig earth andstones, or otherwise disturb them. (Scott 1885, Letter III, 78–79)Another Scottish name for these places is Aplochs, corners of cornfields ormeadows left uncultivated for the supposed benefit of the warlocks, to keeptheir favor (Warrack 1988 [1911], 8).In Lincolnshire, eastern England, trees grow in the triangular corners of somefields. These are called Devil’s Holts. The folklorist C. B. Sibsey noted in1930 that the belief was still current that they were left for the Devil to playin; otherwise he would play in the fields and spoil the crops (Rudkin 1934,250). Daddy Witch, the nineteenth-century Cambridgeshire wise woman, was said toown a grimoire called The Devil’s Plantation (Parsons 1915, 39). The name ofthis book refers to the local word for uncultivated corners of fields,deliberately left fallow by farmers because they are no-man’s-land, places wherethe yarthkins or hytersprites dwell. In the west of England, this kind of “wastepiece of land” is called a gallitrap. Folklorist Theo Brown viewed gallitraps astransdimensional gateways, artificial entrances to the underworld (Brown 1966,125), for the word “gallitrap” was also used to describe a magic circle,pentacle, or triangle made by a conjuring parson to lay a ghost or entrap acriminal. An eighteenth-century account of ghost laying in Cornwall,southwestern England, by the Reverend Corker, a famed “conjuring parson,” refersto just such a magic triangle:The parson, assisted by Dr. Maddern and the miller, drew the magic pentagram andsacred triangle, within which they placed themselves for safety, and commencedthe other ceremonies, only known to the learned, which are required for theeffectual subjugation of restless spirits (Rees 1898, 255).Related to these set-aside areas are clumps of pine trees that stand isolatedfrom other trees. They can still be seen in many places in England and Wales.These plantations are generally Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris), which growclosely together and are dark, tall, and visible from a long way off. They wereplanted as markers on trackways and drovers’ roads along which sheep and cattlewere herded. Athough driving herds had existed for thousands of years, by theMiddle Ages the business of driving herds of animals long distances haddeveloped. By the seventeenth century major routes from Wales into southeasternEngland and from Scotland to East Anglia and London became established. When thedrove was stopped each night, the beasts needed to graze, and stances where thiscould happen were established, where drovers could pay to pasture animalsovernight. Drovers’ stances were marked by plantations of a few Scots pinetrees, located to be visible from afar in open country. Many remain today,untouched in the manner of the eldritch field corners and Devil’s Holts.HOLMGANGA, BATTLE, AND TRIAL BY COMBATRelated to the Norse vé is the enclosure created in ancient Iceland forhólmganga (single combat, literally “going on an island”). Such judicial combats(duels) were conducted formally in places separate from the everyday world:either on an island (the meaning of the word), in a special enclosure such as acircle of stones (Egils Saga, chap. 64), or on a “cloak” pegged down by tjösnur,ritual pegs with round heads reminiscent of household images (Kormáks Saga,chap. 10). The cloak on which they fought was a piece of fabric or animal skinfive ells long. The pegging down was done with a rite called “The Sacrifice ofthe Tjösnur” (Collingwood 1902, 67). Hólmganga was banned in Iceland in the year1004. In medieval times the formal lists used in chivalric combats are adescendant of this tradition, and the boxing ring continues it today.In Anglo-Saxon England temporary enclosures for judicial single combat and evenfull-scale battles were cut off from the everyday world by a fence of hazel(Corylus avellana). All around the battlefield, hazel poles were set up, markingthe ground where the battle was to be. This was called “enhazelling the field.”The poles were erected by the heralds in charge of the proceedings. Once abattlefield had been enhazelled it was considered a shameful act for an army toscour (pillage) the country until the battle was won (Hull 1913, 67). Thedecisive Battle of Brunanburh (937 CE), in which English forces under KingÆthelstan defeated the much larger Confederation army composed of Scottish,Welsh, Irish, Danish, and Norwegian units, was a formal challenge held upon anenhazelled field. A medieval Arthurian text, Sir Gawain and the Lady of Lys,tells of the adventures of Sir Gawain at Castle Orgellous, where a delineatedfield of combat was laid out: “At the four corners of the meadow were plantedfour olive trees, to show the bounds of the field, and he was held forvanquished who should first pass the boundary of olives” (Weston 1907, 66).Trial by combat was an ancient legal method of determining guilt or innocence.Medieval laws, including the Capitularies of Charlemagne, the French Laws of St.Louis, and the crusader-era Assizes of Jerusalem, set the rules for duels foughtfor the settling of property rights, or for avenging crimes. The Assizes ofJerusalem list murder, manslaughter, rape, wounding, treason, neglect of feudalservice, and deprivation or exclusion from rightful possession as grounds fortrial by combat. Even witnesses at court and judges could be required to fight aduel with the accused or plaintiff. Only ladies, men older than sixty years, anddisabled people could appoint a champion to fight in their place. Duelistsfighting according to the rules of the Assizes of Jerusalem fought in listssurrounded by trenches and palings as in hólmganga. Before the combat, eachduelist had to swear an oath on the Bible that neither his person nor his horsewas secretly guarded (by magic) and that he had used no witchcraft. The defeatedduelist, if he was not killed in combat, was hanged. If a champion lost theduel, both champion and plaintiff were hanged. A woman whose champion failed wasburned at the stake, and he was hanged. In France the final trial by combat tookplace in 1547 (Kottenkamp 1988, 105–7).LABYRINTHSThere are over five hundred ancient stone labyrinths documented in Scandinaviaand Iceland, and a few cut in the turf in England, Germany, and Poland. Stonelabyrinths are made of rounded stones ranging in size from pebbles to boulders,laid on the earth or on rock surfaces. Some are close to prehistoric burials orgrave fields, and it is claimed that some may date from the Bronze Age, thoughmost are thought to be less than nine hundred years old (Kern 1983, 391; Kraft1986, 14). There are numerous folktales and folk practices recorded about theselabyrinths, and their names are evocative of ancient cities and turningpathways. For example, the Russian labyrinth name Vavilon (Babylon) derives fromthe old Russian word vavilonistyy (“twisting, curved”). A Welsh name, caerdroia,literally means “city of turnings” but is also associated with another famousancient city, Troy, hence one of the English names for labyrinths, “Troytown.”Scandinavian names include trøborg and trælleborg, with allusions to both Troyand trolls. German names also refer to Troy, such as Trujaburg, but othersinclude Windelbahn (“winding way”), Schlangengang (“snake path”), andZauberkreis (“magic circle”). An Icelandic name, völundarhús (“Wayland’shouse”), associates the labyrinth with the legendary blacksmith Völundr, a mythparallel with the tale that the labyrinth was invented by the metalworkerDaedalus on the island of Crete (Meyer 1882, 290). The apotropaic power of ironto shield against and bind evil and bad luck is shared by the labyrinth pattern.image [../images/00025.jpeg]Fig. 6.3. Turf labyrinth formerly at Sneinton, Nottingham, England, 1797. TheLibrary of the European TraditionIn 1684 the Swedish antiquarian Johan Hadorph, who catalogued over one thousandrunestones, wrote about the Troijenborg at Rösaring, where, he commented, therehad been much sacrifice to the gods in olden days. The labyrinth at Rösaring ispart of a “cult site” that has ancient cairns and what appears to be aceremonial roadway running a north-south alignment along the ridge for 590 yards(540 m). In 1872 S. Sörenson wrote about a labyrinth called Truber Slot thatexisted in former times at the mouth of Oslo Fjord, Norway. Said to have beenbuilt by a virgin, it was activated to ensure favorable winds for sailing.Appeasing the deity of the northwest wind was given as the functionality oflabyrinths in a newspaper article in 1945 (Kraft 1986, 15). John Kraft notesthat the fishing village of Kuggören in northern Sweden retained knowledge oflabyrinth magic into the 1950s. A fisherman from Södermöja recalled visitingKuggören in 1955, where he saw an old man run through the labyrinth. As he ran,he spit in his hand, or on something he held, and threw it backward over hisshoulder. This was for luck in fishing. This man was known locally as theKuggören cunning man who used steel to heal people and livestock and practicedmagic in the labyrinth. He died in 1963 without transmitting his magicalknowledge to his sons, who were not interested.In Sweden in 1973 Eva Eskilsson from Härnösand recounted that a former ship’spilot had told her that when mariners were delayed by bad weather and could notsail, they would build labyrinths of stone so that the wind would get caught upin them and so reduce in strength (Kraft 1986, 15). The same story has beencollected by folklorists from Husum, Germany, and Haparanda and Luleå innorthern Sweden. As turning magic, labyrinths were used to trap harmful sprites.Kraft reported in 1986 that Gösta Janssen from Rådmansö parish told him that hehad heard that fishermen used to walk a labyrinth near Stockholm when they laidtheir nets. This was to exorcise evil ghosts to guarantee a good catch (Kraft1986, 15). The Swedish fishermen used them to prevent smågubbar (little people),malicious land wights, from coming on board ship to disrupt the haul. Thesmågubbar, it was believed, would follow the fishermen around until they boardedtheir vessel. So the fishermen would go into the center of a labyrinth, and thesmågubbar would follow them in, getting confused in the process. Then thefishermen would run from the labyrinth to the ship and cast off before thesmågubbar could reach it.It is possible that labyrinth fishing magic has a prosaic origin. Fish weirs andfish traps on rivers and in tidal areas made from stones, sticks, wattles,basketwork, and timber, either with or without nets, were used widely in Italy,France, England, Scotland, Wales, Poland, Estonia, Norway, Sweden, Hungary, andGermany, where they were called a Fischzaun (fish fence) or a Fischirrgarten(fish maze) (Buschan 1926, 322). Coastal magical labyrinths for the entrapmentof fishing with nets from ships may follow on from the construction of actualcoastal fish labyrinths (Fischirrgärten), using the form of the unicursallabyrinth rather than the shapes suitable for catching fish. The labyrinths onthe coast of the White Sea in Russia are in the area of the spawning groundswhere seasonal fishing was carried out (Gurina 1948, 33). In northern Sweden andFinland, labyrinths were used by Sámi herdsmen as a means of magical protectionof their reindeer from attacks by wolverines (Kraft 1986, 19).CHURCHYARDS AND GRAVESimage [../images/00002.jpeg]The Houses of the DeadAn ancient Germanic custom was to bury bodies in Totenbäume, “trees of thedead.” They appeared in the Alamannic period (213–496 CE). A Totenbaum was madefrom a hollowed-out trunk of an oak tree, with a lid that was carved with ascaly serpent with a head at each end. The last known burial in a Totenbaum wasGraf von Buchaw in 1151 (Paulsen and Schach-Dörges 1972, 21–22). Some hogbacktombstones of the Viking Age in Scotland have serpentlike roof ridges thatresemble the Totenbaum, although these tombstones did not contain the body. Bedsof the dead made of planks slotted into cornerposts were used in Merovingiantimes along with Totenbäume in Germany (Paulsen and Schach-Dörges 1972, 23–25).Grave chambers made from jointed planks had existed in Celtic burials inmainland Europe in pre-Roman times. From the late seventh century similar “boxshrines” were made in Ireland from thin slabs of stone whose form was derivedfrom carpentry (Herity 1993, 101–94).FUNERAL CUSTOMSThe lykewake is the tradition of watching over a corpse until it is taken awayto be buried. The period between death and burial was believed to be dangerous,as the spirit of the deceased remained close to the body. The sight of the deadwas considered dangerous. The corpse’s eyes were shut, and coins were placedover them. The old Norse death rites (ná-bjargir) were conducted from behind thecorpse so that the one performing them could not fall under the gaze of thedeceased, who could then claim the living person and bring him or her over tothe side of the dead (Hasenfratz 2011, 69). When the cause of death wasuncertain, there were particular rites to ask the spirit what was the cause ofdeath.Churchyards and graveyards are special tracts of land ritually set aside for thedead. They are places of dread because everyone knows that one day we will dieand end up in one. They were also feared because the spirits of the dead residedthere and could affect people unfavorably if they happened to go there.Traditionally, there are apotropaic amulets, talismans, and sigils that ward offevil spirits from a place, or pin them down, and the graveyard is no differentfrom anywhere else they are used. A cross upon a grave, apart from being amarker that someone is buried there, also serves a magical function to preventhis or her spirit from manifesting. Graves and tombs contain the remains ofindividuals who led particular lives. Because the spirit was once present in thebody, the grave is not just a meaningless place where the corpse is disposed of,but a meaningful location associated with the individual buried there.Graveyards contain the remains of famous and infamous people, saints andcriminals, and their graves are resorted to by relatives, descendants, pilgrims,tourists, and those who believe some benefit will accrue for visiting anyparticular grave. Traditionally, the tomb or grave is the house of the shade orghost of the individual. It must be kept clean, adorned with flowers and otherofferings in order that the memory of the deceased be kept up, and also that theshade might not wander from the grave and do mischief. In the Catholic traditionthere is a special day, November 2, on which family and ancestral graves areswept, cleaned, and tended, thereby maintaining the protective power. This dayis observed in some countries as the Day of the Dead. It is close to the oldCeltic festival of Samhain, and the Hallowe’en ghosts and demons of the modernfestival continue the observance in a commercialized manner.THE FIRST BURIALThe actual location of the first grave in a new cemetery is also significant,for tradition asserts that the spirit of the first one buried becomes theguardian of the graveyard. An ancient Norwegian belief about the haugbonde (OldNorse haugbúi, mound dweller), which haunted burial mounds near farms, was thatit was the ghost of the first owner (founder) of a farmstead, and itssupernatural guardian. Offerings of food and drink were left for it. Animals(and people) sacrificed at the foundation of buildings were deemed to remain asghostly apparitions that guarded the place, such as the Kirk-grim or theguardian of churches, and the graveyard belief is clearly the same (Howlett1899, 31). In Somerset this being was called the Churchyard Walker (Tongue 1958,44). Writing in England in 1899, George Tyack noted:There is a superstition in many places that it is something worse than unluckyto be the first corpse buried in a new churchyard; the Devil, in fact, issupposed to have an unquestionable claim to the possession of such a body. InGermany and in Scandinavia the enemy is sometimes outwitted by the interment ofa pig or a dog, before any Christian burial takes place. For a long time thepeople were unwilling to use the churchyard of St. John’s, Bovey-Tracey, forthis reason; and only began to do so after a stranger had been laid to resttherein. The same idea prevails in the North of England and in Scotland. Therecan be little doubt that in this we have a relic of the Pagan custom . . .namely, the offering of an animal, or even of a human, sacrifice at thefoundation of a new building.” (Tyack 1899, 80)In 1958 Ruth Tongue noted that the sexton (gravedigger) was often appealed to“behind the parson’s back,” so a person would not be the first to be buried. Shetells how in one instance a large black dog belonging to a local farmer hadmysteriously disappeared, and the sexton was said to have killed it and buriedit in the graveyard before the funeral of the person (Tongue 1958, 44). A Bretontradition is that the last person buried any year becomes the Ankou, a grimreaper who drives a spectral cart that comes for the dead. He or she remains theAnkou for a year, when the last person of that year is buried (Simpson 1987,41).A rare account from the English West Midlands in the mid-twentieth centuryconcerns the customs of traveling showmen who were accustomed to lay outfairgrounds. The custom recorded was sufficiently notable that a nationalnewspaper reported it (The Sunday Express, December 12, 1943). The funeral ofPat Collins, “The King of the Showmen,” took place at Bloxwich in December 1943.The location of Pat Collins’s grave was ritually divined by his son:There was a strange incident at the cemetery when the old man’s son visited itaccompanied by Father Hanrahan, of St. Peter’s Catholic Church, Bloxwich, toselect a site for the grave. When he came to seek a site for his father’s lastresting place it was found that the Catholic portion of the cemetery was full.The adjoining land which belongs to the cemetery was specially consecrated. WhenMr. Collins went to select a place for the first grave, he brought his footforward, raised it and brought his heel down sharply on the turf, making a deepdent in it, exclaiming as he did so, “This is the spot. I want the exact centerof my father’s grave to be over that mark.” He explained to the priest: “Myfather used those words and that gesture for 60 years every time he inspected afairground site to indicate where the principal attraction, usually the biggestof the merry-go-rounds, was to be erected. He never measured the ground, but thechosen spot was always in the exact center of the show ground. It was a ritualwith him.”Pat Collins was duly buried at the center of the new graveyard as the firstinterment. Whether or not a dog had preceded him was not mentioned.Divination of a gravesite in open country, that is, ground not consecrated bythe church, appears in the ballads of Robin Hood. Medieval outlaws like RobinHood and Little John were refused Christian burials, and the reputed graves ofboth men were in unconsecrated ground. Whoever the original Robin Hood was,there are two extant old ballads telling of Robin Hood’s death, Robin Hood HisDeath and Robin Hood’s Death and Burial. The first appears to suggest anoutlaw’s road burial at “yonder streete” with a grave “of gravel and greete(grit).” The second tells how Robin Hood lies dying from blood loss atKirkley-hall. He summons Little John to his deathbed and asks him for his bow.With his last strength Robin shoots an arrow out of the window to divine theplace where he will be buried (Dobson and Taylor 1997, 134–39). Divination byarrow shot also appears in folktales about the location of medieval churches,including Salisbury Cathedral.EVOCATION OF THE DEAD AND GRAVEYARD MAGICThe Norse magic for summoning the dead, a “death charm” or “death song”(val-gardr), is a waking song, beginning with “Vaki!” (“Awake!”), such as isdescribed in the Eddic poem Svipdagsmál. If the awakened dead is not a relative,then the information obtained may be a curse, the spirit telling of thenecromant’s doom, for instance. The Indiculus Superstitionum et Paganiarum, fromthe era of St. Boniface (Winfrith) in Germany (seventh–eighth century), is anindex of forbidden “superstitions and heathen customs” that includes dadsisas,“sacrilege committed over the dead” (Boudriot 1964, 51). The oldest knownnorthern death magic talisman is a bracteate found in the mouth of a skeleton ina Swedish grave. It bore an anagram of the Latin letters SISU (Düwel 1988, 75,77, 90, 105). The sis component of dadsisas is clear.In the north of England, malevolent entities that emerged from graveyards in theshape of the vicious bar guest, boggart, or bogey man were believed to be thespirits of those who were not honored as worthy ancestors, but instead ignoredor vilified. One belief about the bar guest was that he was the ghost of asuicide or murderer, an unjust oppressive landlord, or a murder victim. Thisshunned outcast was denied rest in the proper place in the spirit world, butinstead was aimlessly wandering the earth, doing mischief and physicallyattacking people. They were not vampires like those described by William ofNewburgh. Magicians called boggart-seers were employed to deal with thesedangerous apparitions. The last one died around 1850 (Harland and Wilkinson1867, 49, 55).Churchyards and cemeteries are also places where the materia magica used forcertain purposes can be obtained. Practitioners of graveyard magic who intendedto contact spirits used bones, graveyard earth, and fragments of coffin.Churchyard materials are deemed to possess magical and physical qualities; forexample, coffin dust is said to be toxic (Newman 1948a, 127). The fear thatone’s bones may be used in necromantic conjuration or for other magical purposeswas always an argument for cremation. In his Hydrotaphia (1658), Sir ThomasBrowne wrote, “to be gnawed out of our graves, to have our skulls made drinkingbowls, and our bones turned into pipes, to delight and sport our enemies, aretragical abominations escaped in burning burials” (Browne 1862, 152).Digging in graveyards for human bones for magical purposes has always beenprohibited. But people did take human bones from churchyards and use themmagically. There is a considerable literature from Scandinavia of such humanbone magic. In his Northamptonshire folklore Sternberg (1851) mentions oneinstance he found of someone who possessed a human kneecap to ward offrheumatism (Sternberg 1851, 24–25). In 1895 W. B. Gerish published an EastAnglian churchyard charm taught by the Chedgrave Witch to a Loddon girl at thebeginning of the ninteenth century. The rhyme or charm gave a graveyard rite fora woman to gain a husband, seemingly with a form of evocation of the dead. Shehad to go alone to the burial ground and make three crosses from “graveyardbits,” then choose a gravestone to hold them between the “finger slits” over thestone. One cross represented the girl, another the would-be husband, and thethird stood between them. If both crosses leaned across the middle one, theman’s name would come to the girl. But in performing the ritual, she would losea year of life, and the person who was buried in the grave over which the ritewas conducted would somehow be able to use the “last year on earth-life” thatshe would have had (Gerish 1895, 200). The widespread belief that everyone has aparticular fixed time to live is implicit in this rite.Another kind of marriage magic used churchyard toads. According to MabelPeacock, using toads found in churchyards were recommended by witches to womenwho wished to entrap men who would be “compelled to accept the yoke of wedlock.”A woman who wanted to marry a particular man had to go to Holy Communion ateight o’clock. She should take the communion bread but not swallow it. Then,“after you come out of the church, you will see a toad in the churchyard.” Shehad to spit the host out so that the toad would eat it. After that, her man willbe magically compelled to marry her (Peacock 1901, 168). In Ireland, a spell tocause hatred rather than love between partners made use of graveyard materials.It involved taking a handful of clay from a new-made grave and shaking itbetween the couple, saying, “Hate ye one another! May you be as hateful to eachother as sin to Christ, as bread eaten without blessing is to God” (Wilde 1887,II, 82)."},{"pageContent":"7Materials and CraftsTHE SPIRITUAL NATURE OF CRAFTSMANSHIPTo live, humans everywhere have to deal with the same fundamental constraints ofexistence. In different places the outward appearance of how people dealt in thepast with necessities has its own characteristic cultural forms. All visible andinvisible manifestations of existence emanate from true principles. The outwardforms of human artifacts vary according to culture, place, and time. But eachmaterial used in human culture has its own innate character, and each techniqueused to work that material brings its own particular way of working, thinking,and feeling. Every new piece of handwork renews the freshness of experience ofthe craftsperson. The act of making is primal when it expresses the fullness ofbeing. The craftsperson is in touch with the life of nature through a process ofreorigination that accesses the source of existence. The creative act is atransposition from the spiritual realm to the sensory; the fixing of a visibleform of something that previously did not exist. Tradition recalls the oldEnglish craftsman’s principle of “simplicity and singleness of purpose,” thatanything we make or do must be as perfect as circumstances permit, embodyingusefulness, meaning, and spirit. Ensouled artifacts are timeless in that nofurther degree of wholeness or presence can be reached beyond their presentstate. Spiritually, there is a unity between the maker and the thing made.CRAFTSMANSHIPimage [../images/00002.jpeg]Attention to Detail: The life of MaterialsThere was, and is, always progress. Tradition has never been static, conservingeverything totally unchanged over centuries. Tradition evolves to accommodatechanges, but the changes fit in with what went before through adaptation andreinterpretation. New insights and methods can evolve continuously withintradition. In traditional society, in metalwork, music, and magic alike, thestudent learned by example rather than precept. There were no schools, noprofessional teachers, no instruction manuals. Most of those who became masterswere born into an environment where it was natural to learn one’s family craft.Learning was by being there, watching, then doing it when one was ready. Today,some sit beside a master and watch, and know they are learning true principlesand techniques from him or her; some go to school and pay to be taught by thosewho share their knowledge; and some are self-taught, finding out how to do it bytrial and error, examining the remnants of lost arts and bringing them back intocontemporary practice. However we may learn the techniques, an understanding oftrue principles is a fundamental necessity in the European craft tradition. Thecraftsperson transforms raw materials into beautiful artifacts, making the worlda better place in which to live.THE QUALITIES OF TREES AND WOODBirch (Betula pendula) is a white hardwood with grey or white bark. Magically,it signifies purification, and birch branches inside or outside a house resistmalevolent influences and bring good luck. Maypoles made from whole birch treesare common in northern European tradition. Birch is the first letter of theIrish Ogham script, beth; it is also the Common Germanic Futhark rune berkanoand the Anglo-Saxon rune beorc. Birch wood was used to make cradles for babies,because of both the characteristic of the wood and the tree’s nascent spiritualvirtues. A birch-bark hat was worn by the Celtic lord buried in the grave moundat Hochdorf, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, ca. 550–500 BCE. Birch hats worn by thedead are mentioned in an old Scots ballad, The Wife of Usher’s Well, dating fromwell over two thousand years later. Until the early twentieth century, birchboxes were used in Estonia for offerings to the household spirit, Tönn. In theFinnish epic the Kalevala, Väinämöinen made the second of his stringedinstruments called kantele from the wood of the birch tree.The ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is a magically powerful tree. In Norse mythologythe world tree Yggrassil is usually depicted as an ash, and the first man, Askr,was made from an ash tree. Ash is the Anglo-Saxon rune æsc. The wood was used indivination and making spears, staves, and traditional broom handles. The IrishDruids carried ash staves, and it was believed that ash warded off poisonoussnakes and other vermin. In Britain ash tree leaves are carried as lucky charms,especially when they have an even number of divisions on each side (the “EvenAsh”).Elm (Ulmus spp.) was the wood of choice for coffins for the dead, as it wasvalued for its resistance to splitting. The inner bark was used for making theseats of chairs. Elms were devastated in northern Europe in the second half ofthe twentieth century by a fungal disease.The elderberry tree (lady tree, bourtree, Sambucus nigra) has some positive andnegative magical aspects, being connected with witches and fairies. Elder twigshung in sheds, stables, barns, and garages protect against lightning. In theIsle of Man, elder trees were grown next to cottages to protect against sorceryand witchcraft. But it is unlucky to bring elderberry branches inside a house,or to burn the wood, as that summons unwanted entities (Roud 2003, 169).Whistles made from elder wood are used to summon spirits, and mouthpieces forthe Dutch Midwinterhoorn (Midwinter Horn trumpet) are made from elder.The most venerated of all trees in Europe is the oak (Quercus robur). In Pagantimes oaks were venerated in groves sacred to the wielders of thunder: Zeus,Jupiter, Taranis, Thunor, Thor, Pehrkons, and Perkūnas. Magically, wood from alightning-struck tree is especially effective, and oak sprigs are talismansagainst lightning. The Anglo-Saxon rune ac signifies oak. Oak is a very strongand durable wood, used in timber-frame buildings and in shipbuilding. Theevergreen oak (Quercus ilex), like the holly (Ilex aquifolium), is specialbecause it is not a conifer, yet it does not lose its leaves in the wintertime.In the Baltic countries perpetual fires were kept burning in the sacredprecincts of evergreen oaks, dedicated to the god of lightning and the goddessof fire. An enormous sacred oak tree that was revered at the holiest place ofthe Old Prussians at Romowe was felled by the Grand Master of the TeutonicKnights (Deutsche Ritter) during the crusade against the heathen religion in the1200s.All through Britain and Ireland, rowan (mountain ash, Sorbus aucuparia) is animportant magical protective against bad luck, ill wishing, and supernaturalattack. Crossed rowan twigs, taken from the tree without using a knife and tiedwith red thread, were set up on May Day to protect stables, cowsheds, andgarages. There is an old Scottish saying describing the protective magic ofrowan, “rowan tree and red thread gar the witches tyne their speed” (rowan treeand red thread make the witches lose their energy). In the Shetland Islands itwas noted that a small piece of rowan wrapped with red thread and sewn into theclothes, protected the wearer against the evil eye (New Statistical Account1845, 142). Cattle drovers had whip handles made of rowan, as the Yorkshireadage tells us: “If your whip-stock’s made of rowan, you may gan [go] throughany town” (Nicholson 1890, 125–26). Magically defensive heck posts in northernEnglish farmhouses were sometimes made of rowan (Hayes and Rutter 1972, 89).Branches of rowan were set up over house-door lintels to bring good fortune.Renewed four times a year, they were placed there on a Quarter Day and replacedwith new ones on the next Quarter Day. Rowan crosses also protected newlyplanted seeds in the garden. The rowan tree appears as the savior of Thor in thetale of Aurvandil, whose toe ended up as a star. Washed away by the powerfulriver Elivagar, Thor seized an overhanging rowan branch and pulled himself outof the torrent. The adage “Thor’s salvation, the rowan” refers to this myth.The evergreen yew (Taxus baccata) is the longest-lived tree indigenous toEurope, and some are believed to be over two thousand years old. The yew growsin holy ground, graveyards and churchyards, and it is a very poisonous tree. Soit is viewed as a tree of life and death, and its wood has been used in magicsince early times. Horn-shaped amulets of yew wood bearing incised runes areknown from Lindholm in Sweden and in Friesland from Wijnaldum (both sixthcentury CE), as well as runic yew staves from Britsum and Westeremden, the firstdating from ca. 500–650 and the latter around the year 800. Also found atWesteremden was a rune-bearing yew implement used in weaving, also ca. 800.There are runic inscriptions on the Britsum and Westeremden amulets, the firstof which reads “always carry this yew in the press of battle,” and the secondgives the possessor power over the waves of the sea (Elliott 1963, 67, figs.19–23). There are two runes that take the yew for their names, and theyrepresent different artifacts made from yew wood. The Germanic yew rune eihwazand the Anglo-Saxon rune éoh take the form of the pothook, while the YoungerFuthark rune ýr signifies a bow made of yew wood. A traditional German adageconserves the ancient belief in the protective magical virtues of yewdemonstrated in these ancient staves: “Vor den Eiben kann kein Zauber bleiben”(before the yews, no [harmful] magic can remain).Evergreens are special trees because they are green in winter when mostbroad-leafed trees have lost their leaves. So they symbolize the continuity oflife through hard times. Magically, they bridge the boundary between life anddeath. The yew is highly toxic, and no part of it should be used as incense ormedicine. In the 1980s a British Druid died after ingesting yew tree leaves. Itis very dangerous to breathe the vapor of the red resin that oozes out from thebark in hot weather, though this is said to have been done in the past by thosewho wanted to see visions. This is not recommended. No part of a yew tree shouldever be burnt on a ceremonial fire, for its smoke is lethal.Fir and pine trees are linked together because they are resinous evergreenswhose wood burns with a strong light. The European silver fir (Abies alba) is amagically protective tree that wards off ghosts and other harmful beings, whilethe Scots pine (deal, Pinus sylvestris) is a tree of indication andillumination. Slivers of resinous conifer wood from various species of pine andfir were used as a source of lighting in former times. In Germany they werecalled Kienspan and in Scotland, fir (fire). Pine is the Anglo-Saxon rune cén,meaning a flaming torch, signifying literal and figurative illumination. Thedeal apple, the cone of the pine, was used ritually, and it was the sacredemblem (Stadtpyr) of the Swabian goddess Zisa, whose shrine was at Augsburg,Bavaria. In Britain, the Scots pine was planted as a way marker on cross-countrytracks, to show cattle drovers where they could pasture their herds for thenight. Fiddlers use its resin as rosin on their bows. Strasbourg turpentine, aproduct of the silver fir, was used in the past as a remedy against rheumatismand wounds. The spruce (Picea abies) is best known as the Christmas tree. Pine,fir, and spruce are resonant woods, so they have an important use for making thesoundboards of musical instruments. These conifers grow in harsher environmentsthan the larger broad-leaved trees, so they were timbers of choice for buildingin lands where they were abundant. The juniper (Savin, Juniperus communis)provides twigs that are talismanic against the evil eye. Its smoke has a numberof distinct qualities. It was believed to combat evil spirits, and so was usedin sickrooms in the days before chemical antiseptics were developed. In Germanyjuniper sprigs are sometimes laid ceremonially in the foundations of a buildingto protect the future inhabitants against disharmony.The various species of willow (Salix spp.) have exceptional powers ofregeneration and are symbolic of purification and strong binding forces. Thethin flexible withies cut from pollarded willow trees are used to make basketsand hurdles, and for binding in general, both on the physical and magicallevels. Willow withies are used to bind the Dutch Midwinterhoorns together, andthe noose of the gallows tree was made of plaited willow. “The willow has amystery in it of sound,” wrote Lady Wilde in 1887, as ancient Irish musicalinstruments were made of the wood (Wilde 1887, II, 117). Hazel (Corylusavellana) is the tree of bards and heralds, denoting wisdom and authority. TheOgham character coll signifies the hazel, and bardic abilities. Hazel poles (OldNorse hoslur) were used to mark out sacred enclosures as the enhazelled fieldfor judicial combat. Hazel wands were used as shooting marks by medieval Englisharchers, as recounted in the legends of William of Cloudesly and Robin Hood.Like the willow, alder (Alnus glutinosa) grows in damp areas. Its wood aftercutting withstands wet conditions. So it was used for piling foundations ofbuildings in lake villages and crannogs, as well as for later towns on unstableground, such as Amsterdam. Alder was used for structures that remainedpermanently wet, where some woods would rapidly rot away; the wheels ofwatermills, water pipes, and buckets. For hundreds of years Sámi in Lapland whohad been forcibly baptized by Christian priests chewed alder bark, sacred to thereindeer god Leib-Olmai, and used its power to reverse the effects of baptism.There was also a tradition in Finland of making an image of a horse from alderwood for magically protecting stables. A Celtic tradition asserts that aerialspirits can be called up with alder whistles.The linden (lime tree, Tilia platyphyllos and other related species) has afine-grained hardwood used for shields in the Viking era and for makingintricate wood carvings, especially for religious images. In the Netherlands,Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, where they exist, the Dorflinde (villagelinden) marks the exact center of the settlement. They serve as the centerpieceof public gatherings and celebrations. In former times these linden trees were“trained” so the branches made platforms where festive music and dancing tookplace. Some trees had two or three platforms, resembling the levels of thecosmic axis. In Central Europe the otherworldly serpentlike lindwurm is said toreside in linden trees for the middle 90-year period of its 270-year life span.There are three sorts of thorn tree, all of them protective: blackthorn (sloe,Prunus spinosa), whitethorn (hawthorn, May, Crataegus monogyna), and seabuckthorn (Hippophaë rhamnoides). All three are powerful talismans against harm.The Anglo-Saxon rune þorn (thorn) signifies the defensive power of thorns. InGreat Britain and Ireland, thorn hedges were laid around sacred places, and lonethorn trees were feared as the dwelling places of sprites and fairies. Thewhitethorn is particularly associated with the rites and ceremonies of May Day,its white flowers being called May blossom. In England, May blossom was notbrought indoors, as a warning rhyme from Warwickshire informs us: “Hawthornbloom and elder flowers will fill a house with evil powers” (Langford 1875, 15).Blackthorn staves were used by Scottish warlocks, and in eastern England a sway(wand) made from blackthorn or hazel was part of the cunning man’sparaphernalia. Although sea buckthorn’s twigs are difficult to obtain, itsbright orange berries were strung together to make magically protectivenecklaces partaking of the power of thorn. The bramble (blackberry, Rubusfruticosa) is a trailing thorny plant whose stems are useful in physical andmagical binding. In the “Nameless Art” (East Anglian rural magic), nine lengthsof bramble were tied together as a Sprite Flail and used to spiritually cleanse(exorcise) little-used paths and tracts of ground believed to be infested bydangerous spirits. As well as lone thorn trees, Fairy Trees come into being whenoak, ash, and thorn trees naturally grow so closely together that they join withone another through ingrowth. Fairy Trees look unusual, and the places that theygrow take on a special character.The apple (Malus spp.) bears a fruit that has been taken to symbolize eternallife. In Norse mythology Iduna kept the “apples of life,” which prevented thegods from aging. Apples are used in divination, especially concerning love. InEngland at midwinter, apple trees are wassailed: honored in a ceremonial waywith gifts and songs, so that they will bear abundant fruit at the followingharvest. Mazer Bowls turned on a lathe from maple (Acer campestre) wood are usedtraditionally to serve drink at wassail ceremonies in honor of apple trees.The wood of the aspen or shiver tree, which is a kind of poplar (Populustremula) is magically protective, used to in former days for magic shields andmeasuring sticks. The Anglo-Saxons planted aspen trees as markers of boundariesof farms and parishes, as their white-backed leaves that tremble in the wind arevisible from afar.The rare wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis) was used magically to protectpeople against dangerous wild things, and its wood was used for talismans. Thewood of another small and infrequently encountered talismanic tree, thewayfaring tree (Viburnum lantana), provides magical protection for travelers.The beech tree (Fagus sylvatica) is the tree of letters. In former times it wasthe wood of choice for written talismans, for magically, the beech stores andprotects knowledge. The traditional Irish drum (bodhrán) has a beechwood frame.Holly (Ilex aquifolium) is the magic tree of the Yule celebrations of midwinter.After Yule a sprig of holly kept at home will continue its protective powers. InIreland in former times, pothooks were made from holly if iron was not available(Evans 1957, 68). The very hard wood was good for clubs and cudgels, used inpersonal defense.Mistletoe (Viscum album) is special because it does not have roots in the earthbut grows semiparasitically up among the branches of other trees. Green,ball-shaped mistletoes are easily seen in winter when the leaves of the hosttree have fallen. Mistletoe is best known as a luck-bringing Yuletidedecoration, with the custom of kissing beneath it. Although people kiss beneathcut boughs that have been hung up, kissing beneath a living tree on which themistletoe is growing is the luckiest of all.IRONLike everything in human existence, the development of traditional skills hasits own history that retains its archaic origins within its very nature. Intraditional handicrafts there is no distinction between magic, religion, andartisanry, for the craftsperson has a subtle rapport with the material worldmuch more than mere manipulative skill. In traditional society, people who madethings were seen as transformers of the world, performing magical acts for thebenefit of all members of the family, clan, tribe, or nation. The smith,predominantly seen as a worker of iron, but also a maker in general, had amythical status. In his Deutsche Mythologie, Jacob Grimm explained how the OldNorse word smiðr meant not only a handworker with metal, but also a masterbuilder. Similarly, the Estonian words for carpenter, potter, and wheelwrightare all versions of the word for smith. In Germany and the Netherlands, Schmitt,and in Estonia the name Sepp (smith) and its variants, are common surnames, asis Smith in Great Britain and among those of British descent. Old English andNorse mythology honors the smith Wayland (Völundr) as a figure with semidivinepowers.Iron is a magic material with extensive lore in every culture. As a skilledworker of iron, the smith was always viewed as a man of magical abilities,practitioner of a technology that has the potential to overcome nature. Theearly technique of making iron, introduced to the north around 500 BCE, involvedheating iron ore with charcoal, made from part-burnt wood. This makes a “bloom”of iron, containing impurities that must be removed by repeated heating andhammering. The final result of this is wrought iron. It is a completelymalleable material, ideal for forging into intricate shapes. Master blacksmithscan bend, stretch, split, twist, and make hammer welds with iron to create themasterworks of wrought iron in their typical shapes, many of which have amagical meaning. These shapes, emergent from the “virtue” or innate qualities ofthe material, have been conserved from ancient times into the present day. Ironwas viewed as a material imbued with magical virtue, too. It was recognized thatif a blacksmith hammered an ingot of iron held in a north-south direction, theiron would become empowered as a magnet. Then it would have the power to attractother pieces of iron and, if floating on a piece of wood, would turn toward thenorth. At an early point it was realized that iron could be shaped and nailed tothe hoofs of horses and oxen to improve traction and prevent wear. Horseshoes inparticular acquired a magical lore.image [../images/00026.jpeg]Fig. 7.1. Blacksmith hammering iron north-south to magnetize it (Auster, south;Septentrio, north). The Library of the European TraditionThe only drawback with iron is that it rusts, meaning that the ancient piecesstill in existence have been preserved through some lucky chance where rustinghas been inhibited. In the north, very ancient iron items are rare, but somehave been discovered. In Wales an ancient firedog dating from around the firstcentury BCE was discovered in a peat bog at Capel Garmon. Preserved in theNational Museum of Wales in Cardiff, it is a work of skill with loops, knobs,and animal-head finials. In the British Museum in London is a fourth-centurywrought-iron window grille found at the site of the Roman villa at Hinton St.Mary, Dorset, England. All across northern Europe, despite centuries of repeatedwars and depredation, churches, cathedrals, and secular buildings retain theiroriginal iron fittings. At Durham in the north of England, the west door of theNorman cathedral retains its twelfth-century wrought iron hinges and strap work.The strap work of doors and heavy oak chests frequently bears magical sigilshammered into the iron when it was hot. The act of striking the pattern into themetal is in itself a magical act of will.Other essential artifacts made by blacksmiths were nails and chains. Both ofthese possess magical lore beyond the innate magical virtue of the metal itself.In the late Roman Empire, iron nails marked with images and inscriptions wereused in magical rites. “God nails” are part of the sacred array of Viking Agehalls and temples, and the old English expletive “God’s nails!”—whether or notit refers to the nails with which Jesus was nailed to the cross—is an expressionof the magical power of nails. Nails driven into doorposts for good luck can beseen at many old inns in Great Britain. Magic nails made especially byblacksmiths were used to nail horseshoes to beams, doorposts, and beds in orderto bind spirits. Pins, also made of iron, feature strongly in northern Europeanfolk magic as well as in American hoodoo.Folklorist Camilla Gurdon noted a spirit-nailing story from eastern England(Suffolk). Her informant, “Mrs. H.,” told her: “I once lived in a curious oldhouse—The Barley House, out Debenham way—and that were haunted. There were agreat horse shoe nailed into the ceiling on one of the beams and they say thatwere to nail in a spirit so as he couldn’t get out: a lot of clergymen done it”(Gurdon 1893, 559). A story of the same period from western England (Dorset)recounts:image [../images/00027.jpeg]Fig. 7.2. Magic Nails with Greek inscriptions, beasts, and sigils. The Libraryof the European TraditionA woman was sure that she was in the power of a witch. Her soap would not latherat the washing. She was advised to nail up a horse shoe (there were specialnails for this) and to lay a besom across the threshold, for when the witch cameshe could not pass over it, and must ask for it to be removed, and so would bedetected. Also evil spirits could be kept from coming down a chimney by hanginga bag in it containing salt. The bag must be hung on one of these special nails.(March 1899, 480)The hammer is the essential tool of the smith, and the short-handled hammer ofthe god Thor (Þórr) was called Mjöllnir (mell or maul, “the crusher”). Thehammer is a symbol of power that was used in Norse religion as an instrument ofconsecration. Figures from European mythology such as Hephaistos, Daedalus,Wayland, Vulcan, and Thor all relate to the magic powers of the hammer. InViking times, fathers made the sign of the hammer over the family meal,ploughmen made the sign over the fields, and goðar made it over couples in themarriage ceremony. Thor has a number of attributes that identify him withsmiths. Some altars in temples of Thor are reported as being made from a blockof metal, clearly an anvil. The heavy leather belt worn by all blacksmiths isrepeated in Thor’s belt of power, Meginjörð, and another blacksmith’s attributeis his iron-gripping glove, Járngreipr. As a Christian sigil, the Tau crossresembles Mjöllnir. It refers to Anthony of Egypt, who is depicted iconicallywith his sacred pig and a bell, holding a Tau cross as a staff. St. Anthonylived in ancient Egyptian tombs and conjured up the old gods so he could defeatthem in spiritual combat. This is the theme of The Temptation of Saint Anthonyin art. Identically with the Hammer of Thor, the Tau cross is a magicalprotection against powerful hostile spiritual forces. Hammer-shaped bones wereprized as “lucky bone” amulets in parts of England (Sternberg 1851, 150, 154).Hammer magic was being conducted in Victorian England and came to the attentionof folklore collectors. A well-known Lincolnshire wise woman, Mary Atkin, wasthe wife of “a most respectable farm bailiff, who did not hold with her goingson, although he dared not check them.” A famous spell she used in the late1850s, often misquoted, tells of her hammering horseshoe nails already attachedto a bed as a remedy for the ague: “she took me into his room and to the foot ofthe old four poster on which he lay. There, in the center of the footboard, werenailed three horseshoes, points upward, with a hammer fixed cross wise uponthem.” She explained to her visitor in her local dialect that “when the Old ’Uncomes to shake ’im” this action would fix him and he would not be able to passon. The charm was“Feyther, Son and Holy Ghoast, Naale the divil to this poast.Throice I smoites with Holy Crok, With this mell Oi throice dew knock,One for God, An’ one for Wod, An’ one for Lok.”Mary Atkin took a mell (hammer) in her left hand and tapped the shoes’ nails, atthe same time incanting the charm, which invokes “the three holy names”: Father,Son, and Holy Ghost, to nail the Devil to the post, binding “The Old ’Un” whowas deemed to be the cause of the shaking of the ague patient (Gutch and Peacock1908, 125). A nail ritual recorded in Suffolk in 1893 was used to transfer theague to another person. It instructs:You must go by night alone to a crossroads, and just as the clock strikes themidnight hour, you must turn about thrice and drive a tenpenny nail up to thehead in the ground, then walk away backward from the spot before the clock endsstriking twelve, and you will miss the ague; but the next person who goes overthe nail will catch the malady in your stead. (Gurdon 1893, 14)KEEPING THE WILD HORSE AWAYThe Wild Horse or Night Mare (German Mahrtenritt) was believed to be asupernatural mare of irresistible power that would attack people by night. TheNight Mare gains entry to the sleeping place through tiny cracks in the door orwall. The mare pins down her victim with an oppressive weight upon the chest orthroat. She tramples or rides the sleeping one and thrusts her tongue into thevictim’s throat to prevent him or her from crying out. The victim is tormentedheavily and may become ill or even die from the visitation. The mare can onlyleave by the same way that it came in. If someone stops up the opening, it iscaught. Naming the mare’s name will also trap it. It was believed that the NightMare could be conjured up and sent to attack or kill the magician’s adversary.The Ynglinga Saga recounts how King Vanlandi, who had betrayed Drifa, hisFinnish bride, suffered magical retribution. He was trampled to death by amagically summoned mare. Vanlandi suddenly became sleepy and lay down to rest,but when he had slept a little he cried out that a mare was trampling him. Theking’s servants ran to his assistance, but when they turned to his head, themare trampled his legs so that they were nearly broken, and when they went topull the mare off his legs, she was treading on his head, and so the king died.In 1894 folklorist George Day saw a horseshoe nailed to the door of a cow housein Ilford, eastern England, and asked the lad there the reason for it. He wastold, “to keep the wild horse away.” “Good fortune will follow you if you pickup a horse shoe,” he explained (Day 1894, 77). That was in the days when almostall transport was by horse, and “cast” shoes could be found by the roadside.Folklore collectors all over Great Britain and Ireland have noted the old customof nailing a horseshoe over a door or upon it, and this of course continuestoday, even when horseshoes have become rare items. The horseshoe must be nailedwith its horns pointing upward. Then bad luck or a witch cannot pass thethreshhold (Glyde 1872, 50).image [../images/00028.jpeg]Fig. 7.3. Horseshoe as protection, Hengrave Hall, Suffolk, England.THE NINEFOLD COSMOS IN ENGLISH HERALDRY AND COLOR SYMBOLISMAn ancient system of the spiritual meaning of materials is the color symbolismof heraldry, which remains in use in Great Britain today. Heraldry emerged outof the early medieval use of emblems upon the shields of armored warriors asidentifying marks in battles and tournaments. They were systematized under thefeudal system, and a set of rules governing patterns and colors was developed bycolleges (guilds) of professional heralds who controlled heraldic usage. Writtenaround 1300, the earliest treatise De Heraldrie emphasized the importance ofstandard colors. In 1417 the Duke of Clarence, Constable of England (chief ofstaff of the army), ordered his heralds to study the properties of colors andtheir relationships to precious stones, herbs, and other connections so theycould be used properly to symbolize the personal qualities of the owner of thecoat of arms (McFadzean 1984, 19–20). Around the same time another significantwork on the theory of heraldry was Les Blazon des Couleurs en Armes, writtenbefore 1437 by the herald Jean Courtois from Mons (in modern Belgium). He washerald to King Alfonso V of Aragon and Sicily. Courtois’s work gives theconnection between the colors and the planets, later detailed by Dame JulianaBerners in England in The Boke of St. Albans.A ninefold system reflecting the symbolic structure of the Cosmos wassystematized by the medieval heralds. As well as in Courtois’s text, it isdescribed by Anselm in his Palais de’Honneur; in a manuscript of the time ofKing Edward III, Einseignemens Notablez aulx poursuivans; and by Dame JulianaBerners in her Boke of St. Albans. The cosmological origin of the color systemis archetypal, Berners tells us: “The lawe of arms the which was effigured andbegun before any lawe in the worlde, both the lawe of nature and before thecommandments of God. And this lawe of arms was grounded upon the IX diverseorders of angels in heaven encrowned with IX diverse precious stones of colorsand of virtues diverse also of them are figured the IX colors in arms.”*2[part0023.html#fr2]image [../images/00029.jpeg]Fig. 7.4. Heraldic coats of arms, Schwäbisch Gmünd, Germany.There are nine permissible heraldic colors, of which there are two variantforms. The first and older system uses two metals, five tinctures, and two furs,whilst the second system replaces the furs with two additional tinctures.Confusingly, the word “tincture” is used sometimes as a general term to describeall nine heraldic colors, but strictly a tincture is a color, not a metal orfur. The two heraldic metals are Or (gold) and Argent (silver). For practicalpurposes, yellow and white are permissible substitutes for the actual metal. Thefive tinctures are Azure (blue), Gules (red), Sable (black), Vert (green) andPurpure (purple). The two furs are Ermine and Vair (imitating the pelts of thestoat in wintertime and the blue-gray squirrel, respectively).Ancient European cosmology envisages the cosmic structure as nine distinctspheres that surround the earth like concentric shells. The outermost is thePrimum Mobile (Prime Mover), Empyrean or Ninth Heaven, which is the realm ofGod. Inside this is the sphere of the Fixed Stars, or Stellar Heaven. Below thissphere are the Spheres of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, andthe Sphere of the Moon. Beneath all, in the sublunary realm, is the Earth.Originating in archaic Europe, these nine heavens appeared later both inChristian cosmology and the Nine Worlds of Norse myth. According to Aristotelianprecepts, each of the metals and tinctures possesses a spiritual virtue relatedto a particular planetary sphere. Or signifies and relates to the Sun; Argent,the Moon; Sable, Saturn; Azure, Jupiter; Gules, Mars; Vert, Venus; and Purpure,Mercury. The later tincture scheme, which is also ninefold, omitted the twofurs, Vair and Ermine, and in their place introduced two new colors, Tenné(tawny) and Sanguine or Murrey (blood red). The exact tint of Sanguine isdescribed as midway between Gules and Purpure. The color known as Tawny waslater renamed Orange in popular usage, though it remains in the name of aBritish species of owl, the Tawny Owl.In the text Einseignemens Notablez aulx poursuivans, preserved in the College ofArms in London, the heraldic colors are related to the heavenly hierarchy. Thisoriginated in the writings of the Christian theorist, Dionysius thepseudo-Areopagite. His system ranked the powers of the various denizens ofheaven in terms of military organization. So in the heralds’ text, the silveryArgent Seraphim are “full doughty and glorious,” and the “unfaint and durable”Cherubim correspond with the dark Sable tincture. Then come the Thrones, who are“wise and virtuous in working,” with the loyal tincture Azure. Next are thePrincipalities, “hot of courage,” corresponding with the ruddy Martian Gules.The Dominations, of the blood-red Sanguine, are “mighty of power,” and theTawney Powers are “fortunate of victory.” The Virtues are “knightly ofgovernment,” with their imperially rich tincture Purpure, while the Archangels,who bear the verdant Vert tincture, are “keen and hardy in battle.” Finally, theangels, who are classified as “sure messengers,” bear the noble solar metal Or.According to Dame Juliana Berners, the seven planetary gems relate to theheraldic metals and tinctures. Or is topaz; Argent, pearl; Sable, diamond;Gules, ruby; Azure, sapphire; Vert, emerald; and Purpure, amethyst. In Englishheraldry there are different color names for the jewel-like roundels. Goldenroundels are called Bezant; those of silver, Plate; and red, Torteaux. Blueroundels are Hurts; black, Pellet; green, Pomeis; and purple, Golpe. The finaltwo, Tawny and Sanguine, are called “Orange” and “Guzes,” respectively. The nameof the color “Tawny” declined in use as the round citrus fruit called orangesbecame widely available in the north.In addition to the planetary powers of traditional cosmology, heraldic colorsare emblematic of particular virtues, elements, and physical bodily humors.Einseignemens Notablez aulx poursuivans lists them. The first color, Azure,signifies loyalty and the sanguine humor; the second, Gules, valiant action,fire, and the choleric temperament. Sable, the third color, represents the Deviland the Earth, and in man, the melancholic humor. Sinable (green) signifies theplants and trees and, in a man, love and courtesy. Purpure indicates riches,abundance, and largesse. The first metal, Or, denotes the golden sun and noblegoodwill in a man, while the second, Argent, signifies water, humility, and thephlegmatic temperament.Sir John Ferne’s The Blazon of Gentrie, published in 1586, explains that thecolors most commonly used in tournaments have spiritual correspondences withparticular numbers, human age groups, seasons, humors, and herbs.Azure (blue) corresponds with the planet Jupiter, the metal tin, and the weekdayThursday. It expresses the virtues of justice and loyalty, or purity; thezodiacal signs of Taurus and Libra; the month of September; the blue lily; theelement of air; the season of spring; the sanguine humor; the numbers four andnine; and, in the Ages of Man, boyhood (seven to fourteen years).Gules (red or vermilion) corresponds with Mars, iron, and Tuesday; charity andmagnanimity, or power; Aries and Cancer; March, June and July; the gillyflower;fire; summer; choler; three and ten, and virility (the ages of thirty to forty).Sable (black) has Saturn as its planet and Saturday as its day; prudence andconstancy as its virtues. Its corresponding metal is lead. The Sable zodiacsigns are Capricorn and Aquarius, with December and January its months. Itsflower is the Aubifaine, its element earth, and its season, winter. The blackhumor is melancholy, its age decrepit or crooked old age, and its numbers fiveand eight.Vert or Sinable (green) is the coppery planet Venus and Friday; love, loyalty,affability, and courtesy; Gemini and Virgo; August; all kinds of green plants;spring, water, the number six, and lusty green youth (twenty to thirty years ofage). The green temperament is phlegmatic.Purpure (purple) corresponds with the planet Mercury, the metal quicksilver, andWednesday. The purple virtues are temperance and prudence; its zodiacal signs,Sagittarius and Pisces. The violet is the Purpure flower. Elementally, itcorresponds with water and earth, while its season is winter. It partakes of thecholeric humor and signifies the age of gray hairs in human life. It rules thenumbers seven and twelve.Or (gold or yellow) signifies the Sun and Sunday, the metal gold, the virtue offaith and constancy; the zodiac sign Leo; the month of July; the marigoldflower; the element of air; the season of summer; the sanguine humor; thenumbers one, two, and three; and, in the Ages of Man, the young age ofadolescence (fourteen to twenty years).Argent (silver or white) is the Moon, silver, and Monday; hope and innocence or,alternatively, joy; Scorpio/Pisces; October/November; the white rose and lilyflowers; autumn; the phlegmatic humor; the numbers ten and eleven; and humaninfancy, the first seven years of life.By means of these colors, the heraldic artists were able to express certainvirtues and convey particular meanings that other heralds could recognizeimmediately. They remain today as a traditional symbolic language. The seventinctures are a symbolic system with magical overtones well beyond heraldry. Theconcept of seven colors is recorded from ancient Ireland, where one’s rank insociety was shown by how many colors one was allowed to wear. When in theseventeenth century Sir Isaac Newton shone sunlight through a prism, hedescribed seven colors of the rainbow, even though medieval artists had neverdistinguished blue and indigo when painting rainbows. It was for mystical—ratherthan perceptional—reasons that Newton defined the number of colors as seven. Theheavy agricultural horse breed from East Anglia called Suffolk Punch has sevenshades, defined in 1880 when the first Stud Book was published by HermanBiddell. All horses must be a shade of chesnut (spelled that way) and of one ofseven shades: dark liver, dull dark, light mealy, red, golden, lemon, or bright(Chapman 2007, 87)."},{"pageContent":"8The Spirit of CraftsmanshipTRADITIONAL TIMBER BUILDINGS AND THEIR MAKINGThe act of making is an essential human activity central to our being. Thecraftsperson’s work ethic generates a harmonious relationship with nature andother people. The master craftsperson has gained the insight to see beyond theouter form of the material into its inner essence. This ability was explained byEnglish master craftsman William Morris in a lecture delivered in 1881, titledArt and the Beauty of the Earth: “try to get the most out of your material, butalways in such a way as honors it most. Not only should it be obvious what yourmaterial is, but something should be done with it which is especially natural toit, something that cannot be done with any other.” Aesthetic rightness andbeauty is expressed in practical, personal ways. We attempt to emulate what isworthy in whatever spiritual climate we find ourselves. The function of thespiritually made artifact is to disclose the sphere of the sacred in humansociety. Making artifacts spiritually makes the self knowable and gives us thepossibility of attaining personal integrity. To achieve this, the maker requiresa mindful awareness of the nature of reality, an understanding of being thatcomes from an organic way of life.Buildings have no meaning without human interaction. They are wholly the productof human ingenuity and skill. Human activities are personal: whatever form theymay take, they come directly from specific individuals, acting at a specificplace, a specific time, and a specific cultural moment. This is essentiallylocal, even when it claims to be otherwise. Historically, each of thetraditional elements of architecture came about through practical usage by theassemblage of components, each with a more or less natural form. Most basically,they are the frame of timber; the roof of bark, thatch, or wooden shingles; andthe wooden door. More advanced concepts were derived from practical necessities;for example, the concept of proportion arose through the necessary repetition oralteration of structural components. In the development of European traditionalarchitecture, the so-called ornamental parts of the assemblage either derivedirectly from the constructional techniques, as a skillful development of them,or as the result of rites and ceremonies that are also essential elements in theuse of buildings.image [../images/00030.jpeg]Fig. 8.1. Timber-frame building patterns, making sunwheels, Shrewsbury,Shropshire, England.The Latin verb ornare, from which the word ornament is derived, meant to preparesomething in such a way that it was fit for sacred use. Traditional ornamentoften makes permanent the remains of otherwise transient adornment. Garlands,flowers, fruit, leaves, flags, birds, bones, and skulls adorn buildings in theform of carved stone and metalwork on temples, churches, and public buildings,while wood, pargetting, and paint serves the vernacular. These are formalized insuch a way that they enhance the buildings’ function, in a physical, cultural,and symbolic way, reinforcing collective belief and identity.TIMBER SHRINES AND TEMPLESFood supply is a matter of life and death, and safe storage guards againstshortages. Food-storage structures must be raised off the ground to preventvermin from gaining access and eating the contents. From Ireland and Britain towestern Siberia, traditional granaries and provisions stores were small woodenbuildings raised off the ground on posts, stones, or pillars. Particular ritesand ceremonies were performed traditionally to magically safeguard these foodstores, and it is probable that wayside shrines of spirits and deities weredeveloped from raised storehouses. In Scandinavia the traditional storehouses ofthe Sámi were log structures supported on poles, accessed by ladders (Pareli1984, 116). Until the late ninteenth century, the Ob-Ugrian (Khanty or Ostyak)people in Siberia built similar “spirit sheds” to house their holy objects.These were wooden structures raised off the ground by six pillars. They wereclearly derived from storehouses (Kodolányi 1968, 103–6). These sheds werelocated in groves of elder trees (Sambucus nigra). In Estonia images of the godsTönn, Metsik, and Peko were kept in off-ground storehouses standing upon stones(Moora and Viires 1964, 253). The Ob-Ugrian shrines housed boxes containingsacred objects and clothing, and in Estonian granaries, the images of the housespirit called Tönn were kept in special oval boxes, resembling the traditionalRussian oval birch-bark bread boxes. A late record of veneration of Tönn inEstonia was in Vändra parish in the early years of the twentieth century. InEngland and Wales mushroom-shaped staddle stones, which supported long-vanishedgranaries, are used as garden ornaments. I have been told on a number ofoccasions that they have a magical function to ward off bad luck.The great temples of the north were timber buildings. Little remains exceptwritten accounts, for they were destroyed by Christian crusaders between theeleventh and the thirteenth centuries. The temple at Uppsala in Sweden was thegreatest Pagan sanctuary in Scandinavia. Adam of Bremen (ca. 1070), who livedwhen the temple was in existence, described it as “completely adorned withgold.” To his manuscript a scholiast later added a note (scholium 139) tellingof a golden chain running around the temple. This chain appears in a woodcut of1554 illustrating the works of Olaus Magnus, made 450 years after the temple wasdestroyed. Traditional timber buildings of northern Europe, including thesurviving Norwegian stave churches, are made completely of timber with no metalfittings except door hinges and sometimes shingle nails. So the chain seems anunlikely description. If it is a misreport, it might refer to gilded or paintedcarvings on the takfot, the beam at the top of the wall that supports thetie-beam rafters known as bindbjalke or stickbjalke. Carvings of the takfotexist from remaining medieval longhouses and churches in Scandinavia, includingthe Swedish churches at Hagbyhöga, Kumlaby, and Väversunda. The takfot carvingsdepict animals, dragons, and interlace patterns (Sjömar 1995, 219, 222). Innorthern England and southern Scotland, the form of hogbacks (stone monuments ofthe Viking Age) recall shingle-roofed buildings with the richly carved takfotbeneath.Temples of the west Slavonic gods in what is now Germany and Poland were alsoornate timber buildings. Many were in towns built on islands in rivers, stronglydefended with ramparts of earth and timber. Rügen was a holy island in theBaltic Sea with two major temple complexes, Karentia and Arkona. The temple atArkona had an earth floor, into which the legs of the four-headed image ofSvantovit were set. That temple had a single entrance, and the roof wassupported by four columns. The west Slavonic name for a temple was continen, themodern Polish konczyna, meaning an “end” or “gable,” for, according to Herbord,the Pomeranian temples were buildings with gables (Herbord 1894, II, 31). AtGozgaugia the building was described as “a temple of wonderful size and beauty”(Herbord 1894, III, 7). The main continen at Sczeczin (Stettin), enshrining thethree-headed image of the god Triglaus or Triglav, was “rich in ornament andart,” having painted sculptures on the wall. Sczeczin had a religious complexcontaining four separate temples and halls where the nobles gathered for sacredfeasts served on dishes of silver and gold.A basic understanding of the construction of some Slavonic temples has beenobtained from archaeological excavations. The temples appear to have beenconstructed from vertical timbers, and they were roofed with shingles. An ideaof what their walling was like can be seen in England in the remaining parts ofone of the oldest timber churches in existence at Greensted-Juxta-Ongar, Essex(Clucas 1987, 29). Dendrochronologically dated to 845 CE, the Anglo-Saxon churchis composed of oak trees cleft in half. They are grooved on each side and setvertically, joined by narrow wooden strips set in the grooves. Structurally, theGreensted church must have been very close to the contemporary Pagan templesfarther east. Comparable staves of oak with human faces carved at the top werefound in remains of the ninth-century temple at Ralswieck-Scharstorf on Rügen(Váňa 1992, 171, fig. 39). Similar humanoid knobs existed at the top of thevertical planks that formed the walls of the Slavonic temple at Gross-Radern ineastern Germany. The heads of the tjösnur used to delimit the fighting area inhólmganga resembled these.CRAFT FRATERNITIES AND GUILDSTraditionally all crafts were acquired by novices learning directly from highlyskilled masters through personal contact. The most able novices eventuallyprogressed through a journeyman stage to become recognized as masters in theirown right. Because of this continuity through the generations, craftspeople havebanded together in groups for mutual support and the continuance of the craft.These traditional organizations were self-reliant and self-governing and hadsome spiritual and moral teachings. The antiquity of guilds in Britain isuncertain. Undoubtedly, when much of western Europe was part of the RomanEmpire, various Roman craft guilds operated here. A craft legendarium tells how,around 715 BCE, Numa, king of Rome, codified rules for the Collegia, guilds ofcraftspeople. The Roman Collegia honored tutelary gods who ruled the craft.Members conducted collective rites and ceremonies in honor of their deity. Thecraft guilds of post-Roman times, when the empire had disintegrated in the west,may well have continued some of the characteristics of the older Roman Collegia,honoring the corresponding Christian saint in place of the Roman god.In most European cities in the medieval period were crafts and tradesmen’sguilds, each with a religious connection to a patron saint. The word guild (OldEnglish gild) itself has an early origin, for in Anglo-Saxon England thefrith-gild was a mutual-protection society organized by family groups.Craftsmen’s guilds undertook to do the best work possible, and the quest forexcellence was inherent in their work. The motto of an ancient Norwich guildexpresses the material and spiritual aspirations of all guilds: “to do well, andto have continuance in well doing.” The master does not overturn the acceptednorms: they are created anew. Pride in one’s work was paramount. In the medievalperiod, any work of skill was called a “mystery,” and the craft guilds thatmaintained and transmitted the tradition were called “mysteries.” It was theguilds that staged the mystery plays enacted on holy days. Bards in medievalWales were known by the kenning “carpenters of song,” for craftsmanship is astate of being that is independent of the type of materials upon which we work.Once Protestantism split the church, the overt connection in Protestant landswith tutelary saints was broken, and the organizations became secularized ascompanies and brotherhoods, though their internal myths and legends were notforgotten. Trade guilds in towns and cities were fully recognized legally,serving local business interests defending the interests of their members.image [../images/00031.jpeg]Fig. 8.2. Coopers’ (barrel makers) guild shrine, Antwerp Cathedral, Belgium.Journeymen traveling from place to place and rural fraternities tended to beless regulated officially and were often clandestine, with secret passwords,handshakes, signs, tattoos, and other means of recognition. In traditional tradeguilds there are standard questions and answers, accompanied by particular wordsand gestures that are taught to initiates and used by members to determinewhether an unknown person claiming to be a member actually is one. In France thebuilders’ guilds were prohibited in 1189 because of their use of secret wordsand actions, and in 1326 the Council of Avignon reaffirmed the ban. “TheHorseman’s Grip and Word” was actually the name of the fraternity of horsemen inScotland. So the emphasis on magic is among rurally based trades, such asjourneymen, millers, horsemen, and drovers, as well as people who went to sea.The traditional form of organized craft practice has three stages: apprentice,journeyman (outwright), and master. These correspond to the three stages oflearning. First, the novice has spontaneity without control. The next stage isto have control, but with consequent loss of spontaneity. Finally, masterhoodconsists of regaining spontaneity and having control with spontaneity.Traditionally, a journeyman had served his full apprenticeship and was qualifiedto practice the trade as an employee of a master. For this, he or she wasentitled to the going rate of pay. The journeyman would travel from place toplace, recognized by his knowledge of the secret signs and words of his craft,until he found a master to work for. Since ancient times, there has been areligious dimension to crafts, under the tutelage of gods, founding fathers, orsaints, and their legendaria and foundation myths were recalled in the rites andceremonies of the guilds. In France three grand masters of old are honored inCompagnonnage: King Solomon, Père Soubise, and Maître Jacques. Freemasonry,unlike Compagnonnage, which is no longer operative, honors Solomon and thePhoenician architect of the Temple of Jerusalem, Hiram. Compagnonnage andFreemasonry are institutions where spiritual symbolism plays a major part in therites and ceremonies. Similarly, the mutual societies that grew up in Britain inparallel with trade unions in the nineteenth century—organizations such as theOddfellows, the Britons, and the Foresters that promoted ideals offellowship—have or had rites, ceremonies, symbolism, and regalia with origins inthe medieval or earlier religious guilds. Some contemporary trade unions stilluse the religious terms “chapel” or “chapter” to denote a local division. Thisis the last remnant of the former spiritual nature of workers’ associations.TOOLS AND GUILD LEGENDSTools are magical objects. Pagan divinities and Christian saints were oftendepicted with craftsmen’s tools or weapons that signified the nature of theirskills, powers, or symbolic deaths. In Scotland all men who worked trades usinga hammer were deemed to be members of the Hammermen’s Guild. In 1694, forexample, the hammermen of Selkirk included blacksmiths, coopers, a coppersmith,stonemasons, and wrights. Makers of larger objects from wood and metal werewrights, such as wheelwrights, wainwrights (wagon makers), shipwrights, andarkwrights (box makers). The sign of the guilds of hammermen is the crownedhammer, and it can be seen on old tombstones in Scotland. An instance of themagical and symbolic nature of tools comes from the British shoemakers’legendarium. St. Hugh’s Bones are emblematic of the “Gentle Craft ofShoemaking.” According to the story, Hugh was son of a Pagan king, Arviragus ofPowisland (Powys, Wales). He married a Christian princess, Winifred ofFlintshire, who converted him to Christianity. For this he was disinherited andcast down into poverty, so he was compelled to learn the trade of cordwainer(shoemaker). Hugh then preached the gospel by day and made shoes by night. Bothhe and Winifred were put to death during the persecution of Christians by theRoman Emperor Diocletian. Winifred was beheaded, and Hugh was forced to drink acup of her blood, mixed with cold poison, after which his body was hung on agallows. But he bequeathed his bones to his fellow shoemakers. After the boneshad been “well picked by the birds” some shoemakers took them down from thegallows and made them into tools. From then on their tools were named St. Hugh’sBones and described in a guild rhyme, The Shoemakers’ Shibboleth, learning ofwhich was part of the initiation into the craft guild. Before the availabilityof steel, the finest needles used by shoemakers were made from bone. Hence eachtool the shoemaker uses is symbolically a certain part of the body of thefounder.Craft guilds had their own rites and ceremonies, many of which were conducted atspecial places. In Shrewsbury, England, from 1598, the ground called Kingsland,now a park, was the venue for the Shrewsbury Show, a trade guild festival. Theguilds built temporary “arbors” at Kingsland in which they conducted their ritesand ceremonies and made merry. The Patriotic Company of Shoemakers of Shrewsburyhad the symbolic images of their patron saints, Crispin and Crispianus, on theentrance to their arbor, and next to it was an octagonal enclosure with alabyrinth cut in the turf. It was called The Shoemakers’ Race. It was destroyedin 1796 when the guild sold the land for a windmill to be put up there. Anothershoemakers’ labyrinth, the Windelbahn, existed at Stolp in Pomerania (Słupsk,Poland). The festive day of both the English and the Pomeranian shoemakers’guilds was the first Tuesday after Whitsunday. At Stolp an elected Maigraf (MayLord) oversaw the festivities (Sieber 1936, 83–86). Guild rites and ceremoniesall over northern Europe included the staging of miracle plays, sword dancing(Corrsin 1997, passim) and feasts on the day of their spiritual patrons orfounders.Another guild legendarium concerns The Miracle of Bread. According to onehorsemen’s catechism from eastern England, “the word” was imprisoned betweenblack boards and chained and padlocked in the pulpit of the church. It wasimpossible for it to get free among the plough and the nets, so the season offamine could be at an end. So the “lesser world” of the fiddle, the rune, theword spoken, must by necessity work the miracle of bread. The ploughmen preparethe ground and sow and harrow in the grain. The seeds germinate, grow, andproduce ears of grains. They are harvested by the laborers, transported andthreshed, then taken to the mill, where the miller grinds the grain into flour.This Miracle of Bread links the society of horsemen with the millers, anothergroup in possession of the “word.”image [../images/00032.jpeg]Fig. 8.3. Słupsk shoemakers’ labyrinth in Pomerania, Poland. The Library of theEuropean TraditionThe first magical act of The Miracle of Bread is plowing the fields, formingstraight rigs (furrows) in which to sow the grain. The rite of “setting the rig”uses two willow sticks, each called a dod, which are set up at each end of thefurlong to be plowed, and both activated magically and made visible by wisps ofstraw tied near the top. The plough-man lines up his horses in front of one dodand looks toward the other dod at the end of the furlong, noting what is visiblebehind it, a back mark called “the farthest beacon.” The first furrow is drawnstraight toward the second dod, keeping the farthest beacon in sight. The restof the furrows are plowed parallel with the first one.The Miracle of Bread centers upon the cycle of the growing grain, just as thetraditional English ballad John Barleycorn Must Die tells of the emergence ofthe barley plant from the seemingly dead grain buried in the earth and itsseasonal development in time until the cycle is completed and begins once again.In the larger, more organized lodges there were degrees based upon variousprogressive states of the growing grain, as in the song, as The Miracle of Breadhas six stations or stages: the Plough, the Seed, the Green Corn, the YellowCorn, the Stones, Rising Again. The primary function of any craft is to beeffective, and like other handicraft skills, ploughing was an art tried andtested in the harsh world of physical reality. If it had not worked, it wouldsoon have faded into oblivion."},{"pageContent":"9Natural MeasureWe are so used to counting in tens, using decimal coinage and metricmeasurements, that it is difficult sometimes to think in other ways. The decimalsystem is not the natural way of measuring; it comes from a mathematical ratherthan a practical worldview. Traditional measure is totally practical. It isbased upon the requirements of cooking, handicrafts, agriculture, and trade. Itemerges directly from the characteristics of the materials being measured, andnot from mathematical theory. These weights and measures are physical; theyrelate to the human body and natural objects, and they are interconnected insubtle ways. Traditionally, length, weight, and capacity is divided by halving.A unit of anything is divided into two halves, then halved again to produce fourquarters, then halved again to produce eight eighths, and so forth. This can bedone by eye, or by folding anything foldable. Three such divisions cut the iteminto eight equal parts, and in natural measure 3, 4, and 8 are significantnumbers. Traditional weights and measures as well as time were based on aneightfold system. Eight is significant also because it occurs in the eightfolddivision of space into the eight airts, the octave of the musical scale, and thethirty-two divisions of the compass rose (8 × 4). Norse weighing used a systemof measure that existed until 1971 in the traditional coinage of Great Britainand Ireland: 1 Mark = 8 Ører = 24 Ertogar = 240 Penningar (from which the coincalled a penny is derived, though now it is one-hundredth of a pound Sterling).This is a 1 × 8 × 3 × 10 sequence.Common measurements were necessitated by trade, so that some meaningful exchangeof value could take place, or critical quantities of materials could bedetermined repeatedly. A characteristic traditional system of measure conservedinto modern times is recorded in the medieval Welsh medical text MeddygonMyddfai (The Physicians of Myddvai), whose contents include herbalism and formsof magical treatment. Legend places the origin of the Myddfai physicians’knowledge, famed throughout Wales, in an otherworldly gift of a bag of medicinesfrom the Lady of the Lake (Pughe and Williams 1861, xxiii–xxx). After giving thestandardized “weights and measures of proportion” that include the commonApothecaries’ Measure, the writer gives fluid measures, which clearly arearranged according to the principles of natural measure. Fluid or liquid measureis based on a fourfold principle. Four podfuls made one spoonful. Four spoonfulsmake one eggshellful. Four eggshellfuls make one cupful. Four cupfuls make onequart. Four quarts make one gallon. Four gallons make one pailful. Four pailfulsmake one grenn (a large earthenware vessel). Four grenns make one mydd. Fourmydds make one myddi (hogshead barrel) (Pughe and Williams 1861, 458). “All themeasures of solids and fluids should be of warranted [i.e., standardized] weightand measure, so that they may afford warranted and just information in orderthat the medicines administered to the sick may neither be ineffective norpoisonous, and that every dose may be of the proportion intended” (Pughe andWilliams 1861, 458). However, traditional measure of weight is also given,“conjectural measures, dependent upon the Physician’s judgement.” Thistraditional measure is as follows: four grains of wheat = one pea; four peas =one acorn; four acorns = one pigeon’s egg; four pigeon’s eggs = one hen’s egg;four hen’s eggs = one goose’s egg; four goose eggs = one swan’s egg.THE NORTHERN CUBIT AND ITS DERIVATIVESNatural measure is a system used between the Iron Age and the Middle Ages,having its origins in the oldest known measures. It continues today in the mile,used in the United Kingdom and the United States, and its traditionalsubmultiples. The mile is a multiple of the ancient and consistent measure knownas the Northern Cubit and its half, the Northern Foot. This existed prior to3000 BCE, being used in ancient India, Mesopotamia, Europe, North Africa, andChina (Skinner 1967, 40). It was associated in Europe with the Germanic peoples,and was taken to wherever they migrated, so in that context the Northern Foot isknown as the Saxon Foot. This unit measures 13.2 inches (335.3 mm).Artifacts found in remains of the Indus civilization at Mohenjodaro (dating fromaround 2500 BCE) have this measure incised upon them, as do the XIIth dynasty(ca. 1900 BCE) Egyptian cubit measures from Kahun. Royal Cubit measuring rods ofthe XVIIIth dynasty (1567–1320 BCE) have the Northern Foot marked at the 18thdigit. In twelve BCE Nero Claudius Drusus, Roman governor of Lower Germany, hadto adopt the Northern Foot as the official measure for the province, rather thanthe Pes, the shorter Roman Foot. The Northern Foot was defined as two digitslonger than the Pes.Primarily a land measure, the Northern Foot is part of an interlinked system ofmeasures. It is the base unit of the Rod, the Rood, the Acre, the Furlong, andthe Mile. The Northern Foot has a 4:3 relationship to the Natural Foot (or WelshFoot). They are both submultiples of the Rod (16 feet 6 inches; 5.0292 metres);the Northern Foot is one-fifteenth of a Rod and the Natural Foot, one-twentieth.Both Northern and Natural Feet are subdivided into palms or Shafthands (Scotsshathmont or shaftmon), 3.3 inches (83.8 mm). Three of these make a Natural Footand four a Northern Foot. Each Shafthand subdivides into three Thumbs of 1.1inches (27.9 mm), and each Thumb is divided into three Barleycorns of 0.37inches (9.4 mm). So the Natural Foot measures 9 Thumbs (27 Barleycorns) and theNorthern Foot 12 Thumbs (36 Barleycorns).Measurements used in handicrafts and building construction take these measuresup using mainly the 8/3 pattern. An Ell is 2 Northern Feet long (8 Shafthands).A Fathom consists of 3 Ells, 6 Northern Feet (24 Shafthands). A Rod (otherwisePerch or Pole) is 2½ Fathoms, 15 Northern Feet, 20 Natural Feet (60 Shafthands).One Furlong is 40 Rods, 600 Northern Feet, 800 Natural Feet. (In the eighteenthcentury, for surveying purposes, the Furlong was subdivided into ten unitscalled Chains). The Mile measures 8 Furlongs, 320 Rods, 4,800 Natural Feet, and6,400 Natural Feet. In England a longer Mile was sometimes reckoned, 10 Furlongsin length. This is the Country Mile or Derbyshire Mile, 6,000 Northern feet and8,000 Natural Feet; the Cheshire Mile was 7,680 Feet. The Scots Mile is 5,952Feet; the Irish 6,720 Feet (Michell 1981, 21).image [../images/00033.jpeg]Fig. 9.1. Natural measure.Measuring the land and setting up landmarks is a magical act that bringsstability to society. Traditional area measure is derived from squares based onthe Rod of 15 Northern feet. A Rood of land is one Rod wide by one Furlong inlength, 15 by 600 Northern Feet, 20 by 800 Natural Feet. Its area is 9,000square Northern Feet and 16,000 square Natural feet. One Acre is an areameasuring 10 by 100 Fathoms; four Roods make an Acre, measuring 60 by 600Northern Feet; 80 by 800 Natural Feet. A Ferlingate or ferdelh is one squareFurlong, 600 by 600 Northern Feet, 800 by 800 Natural Feet. Four Ferlingata makeone Townyard or Virgate, a quarter of a Mile square measure, 1,200 by 1,200Northern Feet. Four Virgata make one Hide of Land, half a Mile by half a Mile,2,400 by 2,400 Northern Feet. Hyde Park in London, England, is a relic of thistraditional land measure, and the customary four quarters of medieval townsreflect the Townyard of four Ferlingata. When the United States was surveyed forsettlement from 1785, the Mile was taken as the unit for the grid with which itwas laid out (Johnson 1976, passim). The grid was subdivided into Sections ofland subdivided into four square Quarters of 160 Acres with sides half a milelong, the old English Townyard. The Quarters were again subdivided into 40 AcreQuarter Quarter Sections, the old English Ferlingate. The landscape of theUnited States is the largest example of natural measure.Traditional land measure is thus a completely integrated system. The presentFoot commonly used is not the Northern one, though the Northern Foot is embeddedin the measured landscape. It is a compromise originating in 1305 in The Statutefor Measuring Land, part of the reforms of King Edward I of England (33 EdwardI, Stat. 6, 1305). Until then, different parts of the king’s realm had useddifferent measures. In former Saxon areas the Northern Foot was used; theNatural Foot was used in predominantly Celtic parts. Versions of the Roman Footwere used in building along with the Norman Foot and the Greek Common Foot. TheStatute for Measuring Land abolished these local variants and set up a standardFoot, which is the current standard. Land-measure units from the Rod upward werenot changed. The Rod was defined as 16 feet 6 inches in the new measure, whichsubdivided the new Foot into 12 inches and abolished the old subdivisions. Thismade the new Foot (304.8 mm) in a 10:11 ratio with the old Northern Foot, whichis the reason that the Mile is an odd figure of 5,280 feet. Edward I’s statuteintroduced a new measure; three of the new Feet became the Meter Yard (Yard,914.4 mm) to which later mete wands conformed. This was subdivided into 16units, the Nail of 2¼ inches, used in Britain until the twentieth century incloth measure. Four Nails of cloth measure made one Quarter; three Quarters madeone Flemish Ell. Four Quarters made one Yard, and five Quarters made one EnglishEll. Another measure related to the Yard is the Hand used to measure the heightof horses, one Hand being 4 inches, one-ninth of a Yard. In The Nameless Art(East Anglian rural magic), a sway (magic wand) made from blackthorn or hazelshould measure an old Ell in length (26.4 inches; 67.06 cm).image [../images/00034.jpeg]Fig. 9.2. Measures of the city of Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany.In the Holy Roman Empire in medieval times, each city had its own standards ofmeasure, based on local needs. In England and Scotland there were nationalmeasures valid across the countries. The standards were displayed in public foreveryone to check measures against them. Standard measurements were made indurable metals, generally iron or bronze, and fixed to stone structures near themarketplace, so that their measure could be taken and used according to law. Themeasures of Augsburg in Bavaria, Germany, are shown here.In Dunkeld, Scotland, the Ell Shop (built in 1757) is called that because thereis an eighteenth-century iron ellwand fixed to one corner. It was the standardfor cloth merchants in the marketplace. Also in Scotland, in the square ofFettercairn, Kincardine, is the remains of the Mercat Cross, which has an ellmeasure cut into the stone. Measures were transferred from place to place bytaking a measure from one of these public standards. It can be seen in the caseof weights, too, such as the practice of using Ouncle Weights, recorded inScotland but clearly of much wider application. These were large stones, usuallytaken from the seashore, that were checked for weight against known weights,then used as weights in their own right (Warrack 1988 [1911], 392). (The Stoneis still a weight used informally to weigh people in Britain. It is 14 pounds,so someone weighing 140 pounds is 10 stone.)Publicly displayed official measures were the legally enforceable standards ofthe city or nation. Many local Feet and Ells for measuring cloth, however,inside and outside the Holy Roman Empire, were derived from the Northern Foot.Cities as far apart as Lyon, Moscow, and Verona, and the island of Sardinia,used Feet clearly northern in origin. As far away as China, the Revenue Ch’ ihwas the same as the Saxon Foot until it was abolished in the twentieth century(Skinner 1967, 43). The Ells of cloth weaving and trading cities in the LowCountries, such as Antwerp, Namur, Nijmegen, Leiden, Oudenarde, and Maastrichtwere the Northern Cubit. In the Empire the cities of Aachen, Nuremberg, andBerlin used the measure, as did the Italian cities of Ferrara, Padua, Ravenna,Venice, and Trieste.CAPACITY MEASURESEnglish traditional capacity measures, too, are based on the system of halvingdivisions. The Gallon is divided into eight Pints, each of which is subdividedinto four Gills or Quarterns. The Quartern is one-sixteenth of a Gallon. FourGills equal one Pint; two Pints are a Quart, one quarter of a Gallon; two Quartsare a Pottle, half a Gallon; two Pottles are a Gallon. Two Gallons equal onePeck; four Pecks (eight Gallons) make one Bushel; two Bushels, one Strike; twoStrikes, one Coomb (Sack); two Coombs, one Quarter. Thirty-six Bushels make oneChaldron. The capacity of a cube with sides measuring one Shafthand is veryclose to the Pint. In the 1497 standard, the Pint was defined as equal to 12½Troy Ounces of wheat; the Quart 25, the Pottle 50, and the Gallon 100, makingthe Bushel 800 Troy Ounces of wheat. Measures of ale and beer were also basedupon the Gallon, but in a ninefold system. The smallest beer keg was the Pin,equal to four and a half Gallons, 36 Pints. Two of these make a Firkin, nineGallons; two Firkins are a Kilderkin, 18 Gallons (144 Pints); two Kilderkinsmake a Barrel, 36 Gallons (288 Pints), and two Barrels are a Puncheon, 72Gallons. Additionally, there are intermediate beer measures. Three Firkins makea Half Hogshead; two Half Hogsheads, of course, make a Hogshead; and twoHogsheads make a Butt of 108 Gallons.This system of division was applied to the Winchester Standard of King Edgar(reigned 959–975 CE). In 1340 under King Edward III, it was made the universalstandard in England: “It is assented and accorded that from henceforth oneMeasure and one Weight shall be throughout the realm of England, and that theTreasurer cause to be made certain standards of the Bushel, the Gallon, ofweights made of brass, and send the same into every county where such standardsbe not sent before this time” (14 Edward III, Stat. I, Cap. 12, 1340). In EdwardIII’s statute, the Pound was defined as 6992 Grains, with an Ounce of 437 Grainsfor a 16-Ounce Pound. In 1824 in the United Kingdom, the standard was altered tothe Imperial System by an approximately 3 percent increase in volume. The ratiosand names of the units remained the same. The tenth-century Winchester Standardstill applies in the U.S. Gallon and its derivatives. All of these systems ofmeasure allow numerous whole-number divisions of measure, more practical andconvenient than systems based on ten.METE WANDS, THE “DRUID’S CORD,” AND TAKING ONE’S MEASUREThe eighth-century Anglo-Saxon military surveyors who built Offa’s Dyke andWat’s Dyke, which formed the border between England and Wales, had precisesystems of measurement (Fox 1955). Clearly, these were based upon standardizedmeasuring rods. Similarly, the tenth-century Danish earthwork called theDanevirke and the Trelleborg-type ring fortresses demonstrate precise surveyingand layout of military fortifications. At Trelleborg all the main dimensionswere precisely related, and the houses inside the ring fort were all the samesize. Although the exact nature of the measures is disputed, the ratios areprecise. If the main buildings are taken to be 100 units (feet) long, two smallhouses in the middle of the blocks measure 30 × 15 units, the houses in an outerward 90 units, and the circular rampart is 60 units thick. The radius of theinner edge of the circular rampart is 234 units, as is the distance between theinner and outer ditches (Nørlund 1948, 14).The “druid’s cord” is a string or rope with twelve knots equally spaced, makingthirteen equal units. In East Anglian tradition this measuring cord is called asnor and the marker knots are snotches. Druid’s cords can be of any length, sothey can be a way of using different measures, depending on distance betweenknots, so long as they are equally spaced. It is not primarily a form ofmeasurement, but a geometrical tool. The primary function of a druid’s cord isthe production of right angles on the ground, as in laying out a garden orbuilding plot. The cord can be used to construct Pythagorean triangles(right-angle-containing triangles with whole-number side lengths; e.g., 3, 4,5). Nineteen different triangles with whole-unit sides can be made with thedruid’s cord, producing forty different angles at the vertices. It is possiblethat this basic tool was used to lay out stone circles and enclosures, Norsetriangular sacred plots, labyrinths on the ground, and “mystic plots” for ritualuse. The druid’s cord also facilitates various other shapes to be laid out(Morgan 1990, 109–13; Pennick and Gout 2004, 52–55, 111).image [../images/00035.jpeg]Fig. 9.3. Grid layout of the streets of Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England, on amodular measure, based on the orientation of the Abbey church, ca. 1050.“Taking someone’s measure” is considered to give the measurer power over thatperson. It is associated with death because the coffin maker always needed tomeasure the dead person’s body to make a coffin the right size for burial. If anevil person should have one’s measure, then one was doomed. But measurement wasalso an element of traditional healing. An accusation of measurement witchcraftfrom northern England is preserved in a Durham Book of Depositions from the year1565 to 1573 (vol. xxi of the Publications of the Surtees Society). The allegedwitch was Jennet Pereson, who was accused of using witchcraft in “measuringbelts to preserve folks from the fairies” and taking payments to heal people“taken with the fairy.” She was said to have sent for south-running water toheal a sick child whom they believed had been taken with the fairy and thusfallen ill. Her antifairy magic was condemned as witchcraft (Henderson 1866,140–41). Three hundred years later in Wales, Marie Trevelyan recordedmeasurement used as a form of medical diagnosis:Old women who were skilful in making herb-tea, ointments and decoctions of allkinds, professed to tell for certain if a person was consumptive. This was bymeasuring the body. They took a string and measured the patient from head tofeet, then from tip to tip of the outspread arms. If the person’s length wasless than his breadth, he was consumptive; if the width from shoulder toshoulder was narrower than from the throat to the waist, there was little hopeof cure. The proper measure was made of yarn. (Trevelyan 1909, 317)This practice appears to be based upon a belief that the ideal proportions ofthe human body are concomitant with health."},{"pageContent":"10Traditional Buildings and Practical MagicBUILDERS’ RITES AND CEREMONIESimage [../images/00002.jpeg]Omens and PortentsThe foundation of sacred buildings, especially when done by Celtic Christianpriests, often used divinatory methods to determine the site. Wild pigs wereostenta for building several churches in what are now England, Wales, andFrance. St. Dubricius (Dyfrig, ca. 450–ca. 530) owned an estate called InisEbrdil in south Wales. Seeking the place to build a monastery, he found a whitesow and her piglets, which he took as an ostentum to build there. They calledthe monastery Mochros, “the swine moor” (Baring-Gould and Fisher 1907–1913, II,366). In Alsace around the year 660, St. Arbogast (whose name means “swinespirit”), founded the monastery of Ebersmünster in the Forêt de Haguenau,because of the same ostentum. In the sixth century the Welsh king Gwynllyw wasconverted to Christianity and decided to build a church. He searched around andfound a white ox with a black spot on its forehead. This was the omen, and thereon the hill where it stood, the church of St. Wooloo was built (Baring-Gould andFisher 1907–1913, III, 238).According to old chronicles, also in sixth-century Wales the Celtic saintsCadoc, Dunwyd, and Tathan loaded their building materials onto a wagon and yokedup a pair of oxen. The location for their church was to be determined by wherethe ox wagon stopped. So they started the oxen off and allowed them to wander,pulling the wagon. It stopped on a high point between two woods, Pen y ddau lwyn(Pendoylan), and there the new church was built (Baring-Gould and Fisher1907–1913, II, 386–87). In the Norse tradition the Vatnsdœla Saga tells how theNorwegian wise woman Heid told Ingimund, whose hlutr (portable sacred image) ofthe god Freyr had disappeared, that it would be found in Iceland. Ingimund senttwo Finnish magicians there to locate the hlutr, which they did. But as theywere unable to recover it for him, Ingimund emigrated to Iceland and founded anew hall called Hof on the site.image [../images/00036.jpeg]Fig. 10.1. Wolf with the head of St. Edmund, St. Edmundsbury Cathedral.Locating the best place for a building was not restricted to churches andtemples. There are spiritual house-site location practices recorded from allover northern Europe. Once the actual site was determined, it had to be testedto see if it was suitable. A person with “land wisdom” (Old Saxon landwîsa) hadto be consulted. Methods used by the practitioner included asking permissionfrom the earth spirits, fairies, landvættir, jordvättarne, and so on. A southSlav divination used a wheel-shaped bread, rolled onto the site. If it fell onits upside, then the earth sprite had agreed it was a good place to build. If itfell upside down, then no building took place (Bächtold-Stäubli 1927–1942, III,1558). The haunts of local spirits, such as standing stones and ancient mounds,had to be recognized and avoided. Houses were not to be built blocking fairypaths or spirit paths, or where the Wild Hunt was known to ride, so a localknowledge of these was necessary for the locator. There were prohibitionsagainst building at places where predators ate their prey or where animals wereslaughtered, sites where bones had been dug up, or where there was a boulder toolarge to move. Places where once houses had stood, but had burned down, wereavoided. Locations where livestock lay down to sleep, or where a lucky objecthad been found, were considered favorable. Places where strong crosswinds wereprevalent (wind corners) were avoided. Building over a spring of water was notrecommended. The locator had to camp out on the site for a Thursday or Fridaynight to determine what the nature of the place was (Honko 1962, 189).An Estonian custom placed stones on the site. If, after three days, there wereworms beneath them, then the site was viable. In Iceland the site of a new housewas measured three times. If the measures were the same each time, then buildingcould proceed. In the Faroe Islands a magnetic compass was taken to the site. Ifthe compass gave a false reading, “out of line,” this was an indication that thehuldu (hidden) spirits there had refused permission to build (Bächtold-Stäubli1927–1942, III, 1558). Direction was important. Traditional houses took theprevailing winds into account, if possible. Of course, a new house that was acontinuation of a row of houses followed the orientation of the others, whetheror not the first house had been oriented properly or not. Certain evil spiritswere associated with certain winds at certain times of the year, and it was bestnot to have to contend with them.In some places the site of the house and garden was marked symbolically andmagically by ploughing a single furrow sunwise between four corner markers rightaround the boundary. The boundary ditch was a deepening of the sulcusprimigenius, the primal furrow. In Estonia and Finland a cross was dug in theearth on the site before building commenced (Honko 1962, 190). A tradition ineastern England is that after the ground where the house is to be built has beencleared of vegetation, it should first be swept with a nine-bramble spriteflail, then again with a besom of birch twigs on an ash stave made especiallyfor the purpose. After use, both flail and broom must be burnt, for once a broomhas swept away harmful influences, if it is not destroyed, it can be usedmagically to cause harm. In many cultures a sacrifice was made when a buildingwas commenced, and the remains of the sacrifice buried in the first posthole orbeneath the foundation stone.image [../images/00037.jpeg]Fig. 10.2. Carving of bound sacrificial victim beneath the font of Castle Fromechurch, Herefordshire, England.Foundations laid in blood were believed to make the building stand firmly(Howlett 1899, 30). In his Deutsche Mythologie Jacob Grimm noted that in formertimes it had been considered necessary to build living animals, even humanbeings, into the foundations of buildings. Such foundation deposits have beendiscovered in places too numerous to list. Horses were significant in the north,as detailed below. Not only animals were put down at the foundation ceremonies.Excavations of the sites of ritual centers in Scandinavia unearthed foundationofferings in the form of pieces of gold foil embossed with images. In Sweden atHelgö, twenty-six gold pieces were found, while at Maere in Norway nineteen werefound in the postholes of a building that existed on the site before a Christianchurch was built there (Lidén 1969, 23ff.). Similar embossed gold foil imagesare known in Germany as far south as Konstanz. Clearly they were sacredofferings placed in the earth during the rites and ceremonies of foundation togive the building spiritual protection. In the thirteenth century the GrandMaster of the Teutonic Order placed a golden cross in the ground at Romowe inOld Prussia as the foundation of the church built where the felled sacred oak ofthe Pagans had stood. There is a tradition in Germany that sprigs of the junipertree (Savin, Juniperus communis) should be laid ceremonially in the foundationsof a building to ward off future disharmony among the people living there. Theday of the week and the phase of the moon were also taken into account. InGermany building should not start on a Monday, nor should one begin to build achimney on a Friday (Bächtold-Stäubli 1927–1942, III, 1562).HORSE BURIAL, HORSE REMAINS, AND BONES IN BUILDINGSThe horse had preeminence as the most sacred animal in the northern tradition.The oldest Norse law texts indicate that the horse was the most importantsacrificial animal in public rites and ceremonies (Carlie 2004, 124). Humanburials containing horses and parts of horses took place widely in northernEurope in Pagan and later times (Cross 2011). Horsemen and horsewomen wereaccompanied to the grave by their sacrificed horses, and certain medievalaristocratic funerals featured the slaughter of the deceased’s horse. Such wasthe case in 1216 at the funeral of King John of England and in 1378 for thefuneral of the Holy Roman Emperor Karl IV. When the French nobleman Bertrand duGuesclin was buried at St. Denis in 1389, his horses were sacrificed after beingblessed by the Bishop of Auxerre. The tradition continued in military circles.In 1499 Landsknechte mercenary soldiers sacrificed a horse to mark the end ofthe Swabian Wars. At Trier in the Rhineland in 1791, the horse of GeneralFriedrich Kasimir was buried with him in his grave, and at the funeral ofCharles Davis, Queen Victoria’s leading huntsman at Sunninghill in England in1866, his horse was shot and its ears cut off and buried with the huntsman inthe churchyard of St. Michael and All Angels.It is notable that Saxo Grammaticus (ca. 1200) recorded the northern practice ofsetting up the head of a horse: “so he first put on a pole the severed head of ahorse that had been sacrificed to the gods, and setting sticks beneath displayedthe jaws grinning agape” (Saxo 1905, 209). This was the niðstöng (scorn pole),set up with the horse’s head facing the house of the magician’s enemy.Functionally, the niðstöng is the same as the apotropaic carved heads on ships’prows. On land the intention of the niðstöng was to drive away the landvættirand render the land of one’s enemy álfreka (defiled, spiritually dead; literallya “driving away of the elves”). According to Icelandic Pagan belief and muchlater tradition in East Anglia, it was recognized that at places where helpfulsprites of the land (e.g., the Icelandic landvættir) have been driven awaydeliberately, the land is spiritually dead. In Pagan Iceland the word álfrekawas used, and this is the common technical term used today in English (in EastAnglia, it is gast land, “ghost land”). When such places are no longer tended bytheir spiritual guardians, inevitably they will become barren; animals andpeople living there will decline and die.Traditional buildings in lower Saxony have gables in the form of two opposedhorses’ heads that are an overlapping continuation of the barge boards(Windbretter) beneath the roof at the gable end (Von Zaborsky 1936, 279–87). Ahorse’s head was used in Germany to prevent witches from entering a house(Bächtold-Stäubli 1927–1942, 1, 143ff.). Horse skulls were deposited beneath andinside many buildings in northern Europe, sometimes in large numbers (Hayhurst1989, 105–7). For example, forty horse skulls were neatly laid in ranks underthe floor in a seventeenth-century house in Bungay, Norfolk, England (Mann 1934,253–55), and in Helsinki Old Town, Finland, a horse skull was discovered in 1993beneath the north wall of a sixteenth- or seventeenth-century outbuilding(Hukantaival 2009, 350–56). In eastern England, W. H. Barrett recalled in the1960s a foundation rite his uncle performed when building a chapel in the remotefenlands in the 1890s. During the digging of the foundations of a PrimitiveMethodist chapel at Black Horse Drove, Barrett was sent to buy the head of ahorse from a knacker’s yard. It was brought to the site, and Barrett’s unclelocated the center of the site with a stake, dug a trench, opened a bottle ofbeer, and put the head in the trench. Then he poured some beer over the head,and the builders all had a drink of beer before burying the head under bricksand mortar to make the foundation (Porter 1969, 181). The function was to bringgood luck and keep the witches away.image [../images/00038.jpeg]Fig. 10.3. Primitive Methodist Chapel, Black Horse Drove, Cambridgeshire,England, site of the last known horse-head foundation rite.A practice of stable-building magic was recorded in the ninteenth century atKiiminki, Finland. A horse made from alder wood was made when a new stable wasbuilt. It was covered with a blanket belonging to a woman who had recently givenbirth, The horse’s eyes were marked by the woman’s blood. A mixture of barleygrains and quicksilver (mercury) was placed in front of the alder horse in abasket, and the whole assemblage was buried under the threshold of the newstable to protect the building and its horses. If the alder horse is inverted,it will kill the horses in the stable. If a thief steals the alder horse andputs it under his or her stable, the protection and luck is transferred. A meansof destroying the good fortune of the stable is to steal the alder horse, carryit around the perimeter of the pasture, then bury it upside down by an anthillto the north of the field. Then the horses pastured there will die, and the onlyremedy is to abandon the stable and build a new one in a different location(Hukantaival 2009, 350–56).The Museum of Cambridge has a number of horse fragments recovered from oldbuildings, both from Histon: half a jawbone found bricked into a chimney and aleg bone from another chimney. Another horse leg bone was found in 1959 in thebuilding that houses the museum, the former White Horse Inn. In the nineteenthcentury, beneath part of the Norman gatehouse of Bury St. Edmunds Abbey,twenty-one skulls were found. Twenty were wolf skulls, and one was that of awolfhound. Bones were a building material in former times, and floors were madefrom them, such as in a house at Fulbourn, Cambridgeshire, whose hall floor wasof sheep bones (Evans 1971, 200). But clearly cats, dogs, chimney bones, andhorse skulls were not structural materials.From early times, however, the bones of large whales were used to build houses.In his 1655 description of the north, Olaus Magnus wrote that people constructedhouses erected from whole whale ribs. After the whales had been defleshed, theskeletons were left to the weather until they were totally disarticulated,cleaned, and whitened. Then they were taken to a suitable place and erected likea cruck house, where the walls and roof are integral. The structural bones werecovered with suitable material and smoke holes left in the roof ridge or at thesides. Internally the house was divided up into separate rooms. Doors were madefrom whale skin leather. The remains of a few houses of whalebone existed untilrecently in Greenland, Ireland, England, and Germany, mostly at ports wherewhaling had been a major concern (Redman 2004, passim).TOPPING OUT AND CONSECRATIONThe completion of the roof is the magical act of enclosure. There aretraditional rites and ceremonies for this still performed in many parts ofEurope. In Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, it is the Richtfest or Hausräuchi,which is best performed on a Saturday. Before the final topping out, the timberswere hit with tools, chains were rattled, and a general Hillebille (hullabaloo)was made to chase away evil spirits. A fir tree covered with ribbons or agarland of flowers was raised to the roof with singing and rejoicing. TheBauherr (master) of the carpenters, dressed in ceremonial clothes, hammered inthe last nail. At the end a glass or a bottle was thrown from ground level overthe roof. If it did not break, this was a bad omen (Bächtold-Stäubli 1927–1942,III, 1564, 1570–1571).From ancient times, topping out involved the completion of the roof ridge andthe installation of any sacrificial or apotropaic objects. Gable ends and roofcorners of traditional buildings are protected by various talismanic images,such as carved dragon’s heads on Norwegian stave churches, gargoyles on stonechurches, and hip knobs, horse’s heads, and roof-ridge figures on vernacularbuildings. They are said to ward off the evil spirits of the air, and keep thebuilding safe. In the year 517 Pope Gregory I gave an edict against exhibitingthe heads of sacrificial animals in the Germanic lands, but the custom ofsetting up animal heads on buildings was never abolished. There is a record of asheep skull erected on an upper corner of a house at East Baldwin on the Isle ofMan to overlook a chapel opposite (Hayhurst 1989, 106). Skulls with antlers arestill set on buildings in districts where hunting takes place. Ancient stonebuildings incorporate the heads of animals, a practice that appears to be areminiscence of the use of sacrificial beasts. The early medieval church atBelsen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, shown in figure 10.4, has heads of cattle,sheep, and pigs, and the image of a being known as Béél.image [../images/00039.jpeg]Fig. 10.4. Heads of livestock and figure of Béél, Belsen, Baden-Württemberg,Germany.Christian rites were incorporated into the rite of entry, with a priest sayingprayers and using salt and holy water. Salt, pepper, and sometimes bread wasstrewn upon the window ledges. Moving in should not take place during a waningmoon or a new moon, and an animal such as a cat, rabbit, or hen was sent infirst. This was because of the common belief that the first to enter a new housewould die within a year, or in the second year at the latest. People had toenter with full hands, so they would never be short of food, and in the state ofBaden, the rhyme “Glück ins, Unglück raus!” (In with luck, bad luck—get out!)was recited (Bächtold-Stäubli 1927–1942, III, 1566).BUILDING DEPOSITSimage [../images/00002.jpeg]Artifacts and AnimalsDespite the relatively large number of artifacts found within the fabric of oldbuildings and reported, they have all been random discoveries. They are few innumber, and often their provenance is poorly documented. Perhaps the largestclass of objects is shoes. There is a very large collection in Northampton ofold shoes discovered in this way. Above a fireplace in the seventeenth-centuryLong House at Walsworth, Hertfordshire, were deposited a mummified cat and rat,and in the ceiling of a ground-floor room, a shoe, a shoe iron, three marbles,two buttons, two coins, and a pair of scissors. In 1981 at Billericay Hospital,Essex, a cache of magical items was discovered in the roof. It contained twohuman figures made from rags, a notched wooden tine, a piece of coal, andruminant bones, including part of a jaw with teeth and the head of a thigh bone.The items appeared to date from the 1850s, when the hospital was a workhouse(Simon Walker, personal communication). Around 1940 a human figure made of clayor putty was discovered on a beam in the Cambridge University Anatomy School, abuilding completed in 1938. M. Hume told Cambridge folklorist Enid Porter thatthe senior laboratory men knew of the figure and were protective toward it as asafeguard. It was still there in 1962 but subsequently disappeared (Porter 1969,397–98).Whole animals were deposited in places where they dried out and became naturallymummified. In a study the author conducted in the 1980s (unpublished), more thanfifty examples of dried cats were found in England alone, though there were alsoexamples from Ireland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United States.Oral tradition explains that dried or naturally mummified cats were tied up andput in place alive and left there to die. They were put there to ward off fireand vermin. To remove them from their resting place brings bad luck on thehouse. A cat found in 1971 in the roof of an 1820 watermill at Sudbury, Suffolk,had its feet bound together with string. The press recounted the trail of badluck that followed in the wake of its travels before being replaced (Groves1991, 69). Another dried cat with bound legs was found in a boarded-in part ofthe roof space at Compass Cottage in Baldock, Herfordshire (Simon Walker,personal communication).In the early 1980s a mummified cat found in the Eagle Inn in Cambridge was shownto the author by the craftsman who discovered it during refurbishment work.Another mummified cat was in the author’s possession, having been discovered inan eighteenth-century barn at Newport, Essex. It was kept in the workshop ofRunestaff Crafts and disintegrated in 1996 when the workshop was blown down in astorm.image [../images/00040.jpeg]Fig. 10.5. Mummified cat from the roof of a barn in Newport, Essex, England.The skull, recovered subsequently, showed a puncture wound that appeared toindicate that the cat was killed by a blow to the head before being deposited ona roof beam. It is clear that far more cats than dogs ended up as buildingdeposits. An unusual instance was at the Carlton public house in Leigh-on-Sea,Essex, in 1984, when a mummified whippet dog was discovered beneath the floor ofstables built in 1898. The belief that it is bad luck to move such an animal ledto its ceremonial reburial in a wood-lined grave, with sprigs of yew and thyme,and a message to the dog apologizing for disturbing it (Saward and Saward 1984).BONESimage [../images/00002.jpeg]Toad and Frog MagicThere is a large body of magical lore about toads and frogs. Pliny, in hisNatural History (ca. 77 CE) mentioned the rubetiæ, toads that lived among thebrambles and briars, whose bones could be used magically. If the little bone inits left side was put into boiling water, Pliny claimed, it could procure loveand cure mad dogs. If the little bone from the right side was put into thewater, it would become cold and could never be made hot again unless the bonewas taken out. If the right-side bone was bound to a sick person by a snakeskin,it cured the quartan, and restrained love and lust (Pliny 1989, bk. 32, chap.18). A ritual for finding the magic toad bone is the central feature of Britishtoadmanry. It is mentioned in connection with witchcraft in The Discoverie ofWitchcraft by Reginald Scot (1584). Medieval bestiaries asserted that the toadis a venomous animal, fatal to humans. Its head was believed to contain atalismanic stone with the power to heal all kinds of venomous bites and soresupon the human body (Simpkins 1912, 357). The stone was boiled in water, thenapplied to the afflicted part. What passed for toadstones were identified inmodern scientific taxonomy as the palatal teeth of the fossil fish Lepidotus(Ettinger 1939, 151). In German tradition, the Krotenstein (“toad-stone”) is afossil echinoid.Toad and frog bones played a significant role in British country magic. A personwho had performed the ritual for finding the magic bone was called a toadman ortoadwoman. Possessors of the toad or frog bone claimed magical powers overfellow creatures, both animal and human. It was particularly associated withhorsemanry, the bone giving a man the power to control any horse, howevervicious it might be (Burn 1914, 363–64). The magic bone was obtained by aspecific ritual. The would-be toadman or toadwoman would catch a frog or toadand kill it. Then it was defleshed, either by allowing it to rot naturally or byburying it in an anthill. Once it had decayed, leaving only the skeleton, thebones were carried to a stream running north–south. The bones were floated inthe running water, and a bone that appeared to turn against the current andfloat upstream was the magic bone (Scot 1584, 6, 7; Parsons 1915, 37). Differentaccounts of the ritual specify different times and days to perform it: on thefull moon (Porter 1969, 56; Evans 1971, 217–19), on the new moon, or on St.Mark’s Eve (Burn 1914, 363–64; Roper 1883, 794). A version of the rite wascalled The Water of the Moon by the Norfolk horseman Albert Love (Evans 1965,217–18). A person who has conducted this ritual “has been to the river.” Thiswas said of visiting ploughmen who performed unexpectedly well in ploughingmatches, or a surprisingly accurate visiting darts player in a pub.The toad bone was said to give toadmen power over not only horses, but alsocattle, pigs, and women, and the toadwomen power over horses, cattle, pigs, andmen. Lincolnshire folklorist Mabel Peacock noted that the toad bone couldhypnotize all sorts and conditions of creatures at the will of its owner(Peacock 1901, 169). The bone also gave the power to steal without gettingcaught, because toad-men and women could gain entry to places that were closedto others. There was a saying from the Fenland of eastern England, “No door isever closed to a toadman” (Pattinson 1953, 425). There are a number of accountsof toadmen gaining access; one from 1911 tells of a head horseman who claimedthe ability to make locked doors fly open by throwing his cap at them (Randall1966, 110–11). Another used the heart of a frog to enable him to go through thesmall holes cut in barn doors to allow cats access, so that he could steal corn(Rudkin 1933, 199). Going out of the sight of men—invisibility—was anotherattribute of the bone owner. A related technique of invisibility using animalparts was published by William Singer in Scotland in his 1881 book about theMiller’s Word and horsemanry. This “coat of darkness” involved shooting a blackcrow over the shoulder and taking certain objects from the crow’s brain (Singer1881, 12). Black cats and crows featured in invisibility magic in other parts ofEurope.BOTTLES, HEARTS, AND PINSMagically trapping and binding someone’s spirit into a bottle or another sealedcontainer, thereby stealing his soul, makes him dispirited. We say that someonehas “lost her spirit,” or that someone “drove his spirit away.” Techniques forconjuring and imprisoning people’s spirits are a universal theme in Europeanwitchcraft, American hoodoo, and other magical traditions. There are traditionsof trapping spirits and sealing them in a container so they can do no more harm,or so they can be used for magical purposes by their owners (Thompson 1934,138). The bottle is the most common instrument of this. This concept seems tounderlie the apotropaic use of sealed jars and bottles deposited beneaththresholds and in buildings for magical purposes. In England they are known as“witch bottles,” and the most characteristic is the “Greybeard” or “Bellarmine.”The latter name refers to Cardinal Bellarmine (1524–1621), a Roman Catholicpersecutor of Protestants in the Spanish Netherlands, though the bottle jugswere being made for a generation before the cleric ran the Spanish Inquisitionin Holland. They were made from around 1500 to 1700 in the Rhineland and shippedto England. They are squat, brown, salt-glazed, round-bellied stoneware vessels,commonly five to nine inches in height. On the front of the neck, a bearded faceis imprinted.Witch bottles contained pins or nails and urine in addition to other organicmaterials (see Bunn 1982, 5; Massey 1999, 34–36). One found at Ipswich, Suffolk,contained a heart-shaped piece of felt, stuck with pins. A large proportion ofdiscovered witch bottles came from old inns, possibly because the large numbersof people constantly coming and going made additional magical protectionnecessary. In 1908 the folklorists Gutch and Peacock reported an example ofbottle magic from Lincolnshire:A few years ago, in pulling down an old house in a neighboring village,*3[part0023.html#fr3] a wide-mouthed bottle was found under the foundation,containing the heart of some small animal [it was conjectured a hare], piercedas closely as possible with pins. The elders said it had been put there to“withstand witching.” Some time after, a man digging in his garden in thevillage of Yaddlethorpe came upon the skeleton of a horse or ox, buried aboutthree feet beneath the surface, and near to it two bottles containing pins,needles, human hair, and a stinking fluid, probably urine. The bottles, pins,and so forth came into my possession. There was nothing to indicate the date oftheir interment except one of the bottles, which was of the kind employed tocontain Daffy’s Elixir, a once popular patent medicine. The other bottle was anordinary wine pint. At the time when these things were found, I mentioned thecircumstance to many persons among our peasantry; they all said that it had“summut to do with witching”; and many of them had long stories to tell, settingforth how pins and needles are a protection against the malice of the servantsof Satan. (Gutch and Peacock 1908, 96)The nails and hearts found in witch bottles are part of a wider magicalpractice, as they were put in chimneys along with other magical objects. H. C.Agrippa noted that images were sometimes hung in a chimney over the smoke(Agrippa 1993 [1531], II, XLIX). For example, in a chimney of Shutes HillFarmhouse at Chipstable in Somerset, England, a bullock’s heart pierced withnails and thorns was discovered in 1892. With it was “an object, said to be atoad, also stuck with thorns” (Ettinger 1943, 246). The function of this kind ofmagic was described by a writer in The Times (March 5, 1917), who noted, “asheep’s heart pierced with pins and nails to break the spell of a black witch .. . was prepared by an old woman who practiced in London as late as 1908.” Itwas hung in the chimney to carry out its function. A number of unusual and evenunique artifacts used in building magic are in the possession of privateindividuals. In the author’s possession is a ceramic model church, roughlyfinished with a dark brown glaze, measuring five by four by two inches (127 ×102 × 51 mm). It was discovered up a chimney of an old house in Histon, Cambs.The model church fell upon a chimneysweep who was cleaning the chimney, so wasreputed to be unlucky. It is likely that it was made as an apotropaic object,the church representing sacred power, put in the chimney to prevent entry ofevil spirits and bad luck.image [../images/00041.jpeg]Fig. 10.6. Magical artifacts: Cambridgeshire witch bottles and ceramic modelchurch found in chimney at Histon, Cambridgeshire, England."},{"pageContent":"11The Craft and Magic of BuildingsIn 1210 the poet Geoffrey de Vinsauf wrote in his Poetria Nova, “If a man has tolay the foundations of a house, he does not set his hands to work in a hurry. Itis the inner line of the heart that measures out the work in advance. The innerman works out a definite scheme of action. The imagination designs everythingbefore the body performs the act. The pattern is first the idea, then thephysical reality.” Successful construction of anything can only be achievedthrough harmonious cooperation. There is no place for destructive competition inthe achievement of the work. For through peace and concord small thingsincrease; through discord great things diminish. Traditional crafts always takethe time necessary to accomplish the task. Apprentices are taught not to hurryor skimp the work just to finish the job quickly. Something that is nearly rightis wrong.Timber-frame buildings were not made on site, but as prefabricated frames madeby carpenters working in a yard at a saw pit. As the timbers were measured, cut,and planed to size, they were assembled on the ground as individual frames. Fourtypes of frames (plates) were created: ground frame (sill), wall frame, floorframe, and roof frame. When frames were assembled at the carpenters’ yard, carewas taken that the side intended to face outward was laid facing up, nottouching the ground. The outer face of the timbers of a building should neverhave touched the ground. Also, all vertical timbers were erected in thedirection they grew.image [../images/00042.jpeg]Fig. 11.1. Timber-frame buildings, Shrewsbury, England.The only exception to this was the “dragon post” supporting an overhangingcorner, which was erected with the lower part of the tree uppermost. Overallmeasurements in traditional northern carpentry were taken over the outside “faceedges.” Unlike the craft of stone masonry, whose internal dimensions define thegeometry, the distances between edges define carpenters’ techniques.Design and production of a timber-frame building is not a simple matter. Theearly art of line involved drawing out the pattern to be cut, full size, upon aflat surface. Outdoors, this is called the framing ground; indoors, the tracingfloor. In France this surface is called épure (Faucon and Lescroart 1997,77–79). Each shape is drawn simply with a straightedge, line, and compasses. Bythese means, basic geometries and harmonic proportions can be achieved. One orthe other of the two basic geometrical systems of building—known by their Latinnames of ad triangulum (geometry according to the triangle) and ad quadratum (tothe square, in German acht ort)—is selected as appropriate. The timber is workeddirectly from the pattern on the ground, without any drawing on the wood itself.The timbers were numbered, and special carpenters’ marks indicated where theyfitted in the frame and how they were to be jointed to the adjoining timbers.Then they were transported to the building site and erected. The remains oftimber buildings excavated at Trelleborg in Denmark show the high level ofgeometric accuracy of the late-tenth-century carpenters who built the castle(Nørlund 1948).A medieval example of ad triangulum design is the Rathaus (town hall) atMarkgroningen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, circa 1450, is constructed inAllamannic fachwerk. Its ruling geometry is based on equilateral triangles. Theground plan is based on two equilateral triangles centered on the outside of acentral pillar. The height of the Rathaus is equal to half its external length,measured from the outside faces of the sill (ground frame) (Rohrberg 1981,82–83). The placement of significant features, such as the center line of themiddle story, are determined by the art of line. In the same region asMarkgroningen, the medieval fachwerk town halls at Besigheim,Esslingen-am-Neckar, Kaye, and Strümpfenbach all have the same geometric rulingprinciples (Rohrberg 1981, 53–55).image [../images/00043.jpeg]Fig. 11.2. Ad triangulum geometry of the timber-frame Rathaus at Markgroningen,Baden-Württemberg, germany, ca. 1450.For over eleven hundred years in northern Europe, buildings have beentransported by ship over long distances. In the early medieval period, the firstNorwegian settlers of Iceland (870–930 CE) shipped prefabricated holy buildingsacross the North Atlantic. Eyrbyggja Saga tells how the goði ThorólfMostur-skeggi dismantled his temple in Norway, dug out the earth beneath it, andhad them shipped to Iceland. When the ship drew near the coast, Thorólf orderedthe high-seat pillars to be thrown overboard so that the location could bedivined where the temple would be reerected. On one of the pillars was an imageof the god Thor. The tidal currents carried the pillars ashore, and at thatpoint Thorólf had the carpenters reerect the dismantled Norwegian temple(Eyrbyggja Saga, chap. 4). The Laxdæla Saga (chap. 74) recalls that at Trondheimin the reign of King Olaf (1015–1030), Thorkel Eyjólfsson made a church fortransportation to Iceland.The Norse practice of making large prefabricated timber structures was carriedon by the Normans in their invasion of England in 1066, when the forces ofWilliam of Normandy shipped a timber castle across the English Channel. Theyassembled it at a strategic position shortly after they began their conquest ofEngland. The prefabricators of the Norman castle in 1066 were clearly mastercarpenters of the highest order, skilled in geometry and measurement. In latertimes it was commonplace to move timber frame buildings from one site toanother. Because they were prefabricated structures, fully numbered and marked,they could be disassembled and reassembled (see West and Dong, 177–79). ThePostgate Farm heck post (see page 187) dated 1664 in a building of 1784indicates transference of timbers considered to be important from building tobuilding, similarly to what is described in Eyrbyggja Saga. In the nineteenthcentury, two medieval stave churches were dismantled and exported from Norway:the church from Vang was taken to the Sudeten Mountains region (now in Poland)and reerected at Karpacz, and another timber church was removed to Hedared inSweden. Three other stave churches were relocated inside Norway: one was removedfrom Fortun to Fantoft by the Kjøde family, and two others, from Gol andHoltålen, were dismantled and reerected at the open-air museums of Borgund andTrøndelag (Gielzynski, Kostrowicki, and Kostrowicki 1994, 133; Valebrokk andThiis-Evensen 1994, 75, 89).WINDMILLSWater mills existed in the north long before the invention of windmills, whichwas a major technological breakthrough. Vertical windmills—mills with sails thatrotate in a vertical direction on a horizontal wind shaft—appeared first in thenorth of France during the twelfth century (Notebaart 1972, 96). The originalwindmills were post mills, timber-frame structures pivoted on an upright mast,which in turn was supported by a ground frame in the form of a cross connectedto the post by supporting struts. The whole body of the mill (the buck) issupported at a single point on a crossbeam called the crown tree, upon which themill can be turned to face the wind. The idea of the supporting mast may havebeen derived from shipbuilding, or from stave-church construction. With the newwindmills, the old water-mill cosmology was still evident with the millstones,and to this was added a second cosmological element, the vertical post thatsupported the mill, arising from crossbeams supporting a trestle that supportedthe whole structure. To withstand the considerable forces upon the structureduring operation, windmills must have a very robust structure. Hardwood timberis an ideal material, flexible enough to transmit stress without breaking thejoints. The wind shaft transmits the energy from the rotating sails to themillstones through gearing. Like the water mill, a windmill cannot be runbackward, because the sails are constructed to operate in one direction. Thephysical form of the buck may be derived from earlier timber storehouses andgranaries, raised off the ground on posts to keep out vermin.Millwrights built their mills at places specially chosen for optimal operation,and each mill was built specifically for the place where it was set up. Theearliest extant windmills are designed to enable the miller to make the best useof the wind under all conditions. In the Netherlands, where the Dutchmillwrights refined traditional windmills to their greatest level ofsophistication, some mills were fitted with indicators of wind speed anddirection. These were not the mechanical gauges later invented by engineers ofthe industrial revolution, but from the tradition of direct experience. They arepractical tools that enable millers precisely to judge the prevailing conditionswithout any need to read an instrument. Experienced millers can determinechanges in wind direction by the alterations in sound that the wind makesblowing through specially designed apertures in the sides of the mill, enablingthem to turn the mill to face the wind when the wind direction alters.Some mills have a small vane with rotating blades, called a spinnertje orspinmolen, a “spider mill” or “whirligig” that indicates both wind direction andspeed. Often, it carries the name of the mill, for all windmills in theNetherlands and Flanders have names. Also, the gable ends of some post mills andmost wipmolen and paltrokmolen (saw mills) have a hip knob called the makelaar(agent) at the opposite end of the roof from the sails. This is a carved postwith apertures that make a whistling sound in the wind. The miller can estimatethe wind speed from the sound coming from the makelaar and adjust the sailsaccordingly. The makelaar is related to some medieval weathercocks in Englandthat had built-in whistles (Mockridge and Mockridge 1990, 35, 57). Winds arealways unpredictable, and very strong winds such as the gale force winds calledblote bienen (bloody bees) and geknipte nagels (clipped nails) by Dutch millerspose a material threat to windmills.There is a code of sail positions in milling in Holland and Friesland. Ofcourse, wind pump drainage mills had to operate at all times, especially whenwater levels were high. Mills milling corn or for other industrial purposes,such as sawmills and color-grinding mills, had a code by which the stoppedposition of the sails indicated the status of the work. Vertical sails indicatedthe working day was over. An X-form indicated that the miller had nothing to doand needed work. Other subtle positions from the vertical indicated the mill wasout of service from malfunction, or because of a family event such as a wedding,death, or funeral (Notebaart 1972, 145). Deaths in the Dutch royal family aremarked in the Netherlands to this day with black fabric on the sails of workingwindmills, and with stopped mills at the death position.image [../images/00044.jpeg]Fig. 11.3. Paltrokmolen (sawmill) De Gekroonde Poelenburg, Zaanse Schans,Zaandam, the Netherlands, showing the makelaar on the rear gable.Mills and milling are not unexpectedly a repository of magical lore. Mills werethe first heavy machinery that worked without animal or human power drivingthem. To people with no idea of how they worked, they must have appeared to runby magic. Mills are viewed almost as living entities, as the naming of themsuggests. Both water mills and windmills are traditionally inhabited by acertain kind of house sprite, in Swedish called the kvarngubben (the old man ofthe mill). In Norway and Sweden these mill spirits were evil and controlling;they could stop a mill if it was operated against custom, such as at night or ona Sunday or another holy day.In Britain there are nineteenth-century documents that deal with the magicalpowers of the Miller’s Word, transmitted to those belonging to a secretgrain-millers’ guild. Those having the Miller’s Word were said to have the powerto stop or start a mill at will without touching it as well as stopping horses,influencing women, and becoming invisible (Singer 1881, 11; McAldowie 1896,309–14). As with other craftsmen’s mysteries, entry to the guild was by aterrifying initiation, and as in horsemanry, a man impersonating the Devilappeared to frighten the novice (Hutton 2001, 62). In 1920 Glasgow policesuperintendent John Ord wrote that the millers “taught their members nothing butevil.” They were reputed to have powers to cause telekinetic phenomena; “membersof the ‘Millers’ society claimed the power to raise and stop such proceedings atwill,” but, Ord commented, “So far as I could learn, there was nothing in theirsenseless tricks that could be attributed to the supernatural” (Ord 1920).Scottish magical rituals to stop a water mill from working had been revealed byWilliam Singer in Aberdeen in 1881 in his book titled An Exposition of theMiller and Horseman’s Word, or the True System of Raising the Devil. One ritewas empowered by graveyard dirt and another by a bone from a man who hadcommitted murder (Singer 1881, 10).THE HOLY CORNERA tradition that continues into the present day in house interiors is the holycorner. In central and eastern Europe and Scandinavia, the traditional livingroom of farmhouses is arranged on a diagonal axis. This is having the cornerdiagonally opposite the stove with built-in benches and the family table.Russian lore teaches that one must not sleep in the path used by the domovojhouse spirit, which runs diagonally across the room (Ivanits 1989, 54).Archaeological evidence from Poland shows this to be a pre-Christian roomdivision (Pokropek 1988, 46). The triangular sacred corner indoors parallels theeldritch land triangles such as the Scottish Halyman’s Rig (see Scott 1885,78–79; McNeill 1957–1968, I, 62). The rectangular, parallel system of roomdivision is more recent. In Poland and Scandinavia the traditional layout wasgradually overtaken by the parallel system between the seventeenth and twentiethcenturies (Nodermann 1973, 328). In Sweden the diagonal arrangement wasabandoned when standardized factory-made furniture superseded localcarpenter-made furniture. Later the introduction of television sets effected amajor reorganization of room layout.But in Roman Catholic south Germany and Austria the diagonal tradition continuesin the twenty-first century, where the built-in house shrine calledHerrgottswinkel and Herrgottseck (Lord God’s corner) or heilige Hinterecke (holyback corner) is located in the corner of the living room. In it are holy images,religious texts, crosses, and offerings. Salt and pepper are kept in a cupboardbeneath the niche. In many modern houses, the Herrgottswinkel is represented bya crucifix attached in the corner near the ceiling on the diagonal. Theequivalent in traditional Scottish farmhouses was the corner cupboard, protectedby charms, such as bundles of rowan twigs (Corrie 1890–91, 76).MAGIC OF THE HEARTH AND FIREThe fireplace and the fire burning in it were considered to be the center andsoul of the house. In building a house, particular care had to be taken of wherethe fireplace or stove was to be. The chimney required caution, too, even downto the day of the week it should be built (Bächtold-Stäubli 1927–1942, III,1562). Objects were deposited beneath the hearthstone when it was laid, horseskulls having been found in Ireland and Wales (Hayhurst 1989, 106). Thehearthstone on which the fire burned was protected with spiritual glyphs,crosses, circles or binding patterns to bring good fortune and ward off harm. In1991 Alan Dakers reported a tradition from Shropshire on the border of Englandand Wales that such signs were made to prevent the Devil from coming down thechimney (Dakers 1991, 169–70). The Scots word for fire, ingle, recalls the runename ing. In Scotland the ingle end of a room is the end where the fire is andthe corner by the fireside is the inglenook, a name also used in England.Tending the fire was a ritual practice in the past, and in more recent timessome of these traditions have continued on as customs and superstitions, such asthe belief that a fire should be kindled by only one person. If two people wereto kindle a fire together, they would quarrel (Burne 1883, 275). In Kildare,Ireland, it was reported thatduring the whole month of May no fire was allowed to leave the house under anypretext not even “a live coal” could be handed over the half-door to light apasser-by’s pipe, nor could anything be lent or given away out of the house;even if a neighbor or a stranger called for a drink of water, he or she wouldhave to enter the house, help themselves, and then replace the vessel on the“dresser.” (Omurethi 1906–1908, 446)At Yule (midwinter) a special log was burned in the fireplace. In volume II ofThe Book of Days (1869), R. Chambers wrote:image [../images/00045.jpeg]Fig. 11.4. Yule Log 1869. The Library of the European Tradition.“The burning of the Yule log is an ancient Christmas ceremony, transmitted to usfrom our Scandinavian ancestors, who, at their feast of Juul, at the wintersolstice, used to kindle huge bonfires in honor of their god Thor. . . . Thisvenerable log, destined to crackle a welcome to all comers, was drawn in triumphfrom its resting place . . . in the woods.” The log was lit from the remains ofthe previous year’s log, stored away for the purpose. So continuity wasmaintained (Chambers 1869, II, 735).THE POTHOOKThe pothook is an implement from which pots, kettles, and cauldrons can besuspended over the household fire. Before the invention of stoves, this was theonly way of boiling water and cooking food. Other English names for the pothookare hanger, hake, chimney hook, and the Scots lum cleek. In the German andFrench traditions, it is called Hausherr and le maître de la maison, bothmeaning “the master of the house.” It is the locus of the house spirit(Bächtold-Stäubli 1927–42, IV, 1271). It is a very ancient implement, made ofwood in very poor households that could not afford iron, and indeed all werewooden before the production of iron improved its effectiveness. It appears thatyew (Taxus baccata) wood was very good for making pothooks, being hard, with agood tensile strength and durability (Johnson 1912, 362–63). The shape of thepothook is the Anglo-Saxon yew rune eoh ( ), or eihwaz in the Common GermanicFuthark, so the pothook partakes of the runic meanings and powers. In Irelandpothooks were made from holly (Ilex) (Evans 1957, 68). The form of the pothookis linked in rune magic with the vertical axis of the world, the Norse cosmictree Yggdrasill, which appears in some accounts as an evergreen yew tree(Thorsson 1984, 44).The chimney is a vertical axis that links the interior of the house with the airabove, the abode of aerial spirits that are warded off other parts of the houseby apotropaic devices such as animal figures on the roof ridge, gable patterns,and hip knobs. Above the fire, at the place where the chimney enters the livingspace, the pothook serves to protect the interior of the house against the entryof harmful sprites down the chimney.image [../images/00046.jpeg]Fig. 11.5. Blacksmith-made pothook.The shape of the pothook is also an apotropaic device for house protection. Itappears in the English craft of pargetting patterns on the external plaster ofhouse walls in East Anglia. There is a swastika made in pargetting work by apothook pressed into the plaster on an old timber-frame house in Dunmow, Essex.The power of the pothook was used to empower the protective glyph.image [../images/00047.jpeg]Fig. 11.6. Pothook swastika in pargetting work. Great Dunmow, Essex, England.Blacksmiths use the same form for wall anchors whose S shape is sometimes madein the form of a snake, or crossed to make a swastika. The noted folklorist EllaMary Leather noted that at Garway in Herefordshire, western England, ablacksmith had asserted that they were made in that form to prevent lightningfrom striking the house (Leather 1912, 14–16). The pothook is a symbol ofownership of the house, and it was an implement of such spiritual meaning thatoaths were sworn upon it (Lecouteux 2013, 73). In the Languedoc, the Eifel,Rhineland, Siebenbürgen, and Westphalia, the pothook played an important role inweddings, as the bride and groom had to make a threefold turn around the hook toensure good luck. Where the hearth was against the wall, as in later buildings,and it was impossible to circle the pothook, the bride was swung at it threetimes (Bächtold-Stäubli 1927–42, IV, 1274; Lecouteux 2013, 74). The pothook wasan emblem used in the heraldry of the Holy Roman Empire. The original functionof the shield in combat is protective, and the emblem of the pothook upon it isan eminent symbol of ownership and protection. The arms of the von Bidenfeldfamily in Hessen; Schenk von Wetterstetten in Swabia; and Komanski in Silesiahave the pothook (Appulm 1994, 95, 159, 131).HORSESHOES, WALL ANCHORS, AND SPEER POSTSAnother archetypal object manufactured by blacksmiths is the iron horseshoe. In1894 the folklorist George Day recorded the saying, “Good fortune will followyou if you pick up a horse shoe” (Day 1894, 77). That was in the days whenalmost all transport was by horse, and lost horseshoes could be found ineveryday travels. Folklore collectors all over Great Britain have noted thetradition of setting up a horseshoe over a door or upon it, and this of coursecontinues today, even when horseshoes have become rare items. The horseshoe mustbe nailed with its horns pointing upward, then bad luck or a witch cannot passthe threshold (Glyde 1872, 50). George Day saw a horseshoe nailed to the door ofa cow house in Ilford, Essex, England, and asked the lad there the reason forit. He was told it was “to keep the wild horse away” (Day 1894, 77). InDumfriesshire, Scotland, John Corrie noted, “A horse shoe nailed over thethreshold was supposed to afford perfect immunity, neither witch nor warlockbeing able to enter a dwelling where this mode of protection had been adopted.By some a branch of rowan was looked upon with equal favor, and bundles of smallrowan tree twigs were constantly kept suspended over the doorway, or attached tothe box bed or the corner cupboard” (Corrie 1890–91, 76). The seven holeshammered in the classic design of horseshoes to take the nails were seen bymembers of the horsemen’s society as the seven stars of the north (Rennie 2009,160).The analysis of signs considered magical and apotropaic in old buildings andartifacts is fraught with problems. Certain simple glyphs are used in most partsof the world, with varying origins and different accepted meanings. Apart fromany magical significance, the character X stands for at least eleven differentphonetic meanings in various western alphabets, as well as a Roman numeral, socontext is crucial. In any particular identified system, then the meaning ofsigns is given in a “code of symbols, accompanied by traditions which explainedthem” (Lethaby 1974 [1891], 2). This applies in recognized religiousiconography, heraldry, astrology, alchemy, certain currents of magic, and theworking marks of particular trades and crafts. But signs and marks that appearin other contexts—such as on ironwork, pargetting, and brickwork, in knitwearand threshold patterns—are not always so readily interpreted unless they are inregions with a strong and well-understood tradition. Many such sigils innorthern Europe are recognizable as runes.A traditional door is the result of the combination of two crafts, carpentry andblacksmithing. The hinges, strap work, studding, and bolts of old outer doorsoften carry the blacksmiths’ magical sigils hammered into the iron when it washot. The act of striking the pattern into the metal is in itself a magical actof will, especially when accompanied by an incantation, such as when runes are“sung” into an artifact. The most frequently encountered blacksmiths’ sigil iscomposed of crossbars enclosing an X shape. Sometimes they are accompanied bydots hammered in with a punch. These signs can be found on old tools, weapons,and armor, as well as on door and window fittings. In Lithuania the X sign isapotropaic against lightning, as it is the sigil of Perkūnas, god of lightningand fire (Trinkūnas 1999, 70–71).image [../images/00048.jpeg]Fig. 11.7. Wall anchor with blacksmith’s marks, Caister, Norfolk, England.Wall anchors are the external anchor points of iron bars that bind the walls ofold brick buildings and support internal floors. Frequently, they run from gableto gable and along floor lines. In Britain, the Netherlands, and Germany werespecialized anchor smiths whose trade was to make the bars and end plates. Theouter fittings are made from wrought iron, commonly S or X shaped, and sometimestwo Ss were overlapped to make a curved swastika, which the folklorist Ella MaryLeather noted was apotropaic against lightning. The S-shaped ones resemble thepothook, though frequently the ends are forked, and sometimes the S had a headat one end in the form of a snake.image [../images/00049.jpeg]Fig. 11.8. S-form wall anchor. St. Ives, Cambridgeshire, England.In Great Britain X- and S-form wall anchors are reputed to ward off lightning.Some wall anchors are in the form of characters, such as the initials of theowner, numbers for the date the building was constructed, or—in a fewcases—merchants’ and owners’ marks. The port of Great Yarmouth on the coast ofEast Anglia was particularly noted for them.Internal posts, known as speer posts or heck posts, with an X carved on them,are known from traditional houses in northern Yorkshire, England. They form theend posts of wooden screens next to the fireplace.As with much of traditional art and magic, artifacts were just made without fussand without record, so there is little information on how these apotropaic postswere made and empowered. Dated heck posts include one from 1664 (Postgate Farm,Glaisdale). However, the building where it is found dates from 1784, so if theyear marked on the post is authentic, it may have come from an earlier building,perhaps transferred there to maintain continuity with the old one. While thereis no connecting evidence, heck posts clearly recall the high-seat pillars(öndvegissulur) in Norse halls and temples, marked with sacred signs, which weretaken from place to place and installed in new buildings (see Eyrbyggja Saga,chap. 5). There is a record of a second cross being incised in an old heck postfrom Low Bell End. It was done by a local cunning man known as the Wise Man ofStokesly (Hayes and Rutter 1972, 93). In 1927 Bugle Cottage at Egton was rebuiltwith a heck post reputedly made from rowan wood, a replica of an older one(Hayes and Rutter 1972, 89).image [../images/00050.jpeg]Fig. 11.9. X carved in the top of a speer post, Ryedale, Yorkshire, England.Today heck posts with incised X glyphs are generally called “witch posts,” butthis name is not traditional. There is no record of the name before 1936, when aheck post from an old house at Egton, Yorkshire, was presented to Whitby Museumas a “witch post.” In 1870 and again in 1893, Canon Atkinson had donated heckposts to the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, and they were not referred to as“witch posts,” for the term does not appear in Atkinson’s writings (Hayes andRutter 1972, 87).Related apotropaic signs on the roofs of houses can be found on timber hip knobsin England, the Netherlands, and Germany. In the former Dukedom of Minden innorth Germany, the house Geck or Geck-Paol has three-dimensional X carvings,sometimes topped with a wooden “egg” (see Wirth 1934, VI, pl. 268, 3). Paintedon farmhouse doorposts, sometimes incised as well, is the X pattern calledStiepel (Wirth 1934, VI, pl. 269, 1). In the Netherlands a similar form calledSteepelteeken was traditional in the Ostmarsum district of Twente province(Propping 1935, 143). Today this pattern is often called the Dag sign, a namegiven it by Walter Propping in 1935 (Propping 1935, 144).These signs are close to the magical blocker made of sticks or slivers of woodused to block paths to humans and spirits alike. Known as the Schratterlgatterlor Schradlgaderl, it was used in south Germany, and in the Tyrol (Austria andItaly).Apotropaic patterns always interlink with each other, being made from availablematerials. Related sigils painted on door frames were recorded in Germany atWietersheim-an-der-Weser and in Norway at Frille, dated 1573 and 1788respectively (Propping 1935, 145; Weiser-Aal 1947, 146). A traditional magicsigil called Old Scratch’s Gate was used in East Anglia for the same purpose,but it was always chalked on doors or above openings in buildings.image [../images/00051.jpeg]Fig. 11.10. Dag-rune shutters, Middelburgh, The Netherlands.image [../images/00052.jpeg]Fig. 11.11. Schratterlgatterl, Baden, Germany.OTHER APOTROPAIC DEVICESIt is a widespread folk belief that mirrors reflect not only visible light butalso intangible spirits and energies. All over Europe are traditions of straight“spirit paths” along which, at certain times, travel dangerous inhabitants ofthe Otherworld. Like light, spirits travel in straight lines and unlesssomething is done to stop them, they will enter dwellings whose entrances(windows and doors) are approached by lines of sight. To prevent this happening,various techniques are employed by those whose expertise it is to remedy badplaces and ward off harm. Mirrors, often in the form of silvered glass balls,are placed at strategic points to reflect the perceived intrusion.image [../images/00053.jpeg]Fig. 11.12. Geomantic mirror made by Runestaff Crafts, England, 1990.Witch balls are lustrous blown glass spheres around a foot (304.8 mm) indiameter, usually blue or green, but also of silvered clear glass. Theirreflective quality comes from silvering the inside glass sphere with a metallicmercury mixture, the traditional ways of making mirrors. To prevent evil spiritsentering the house, witch balls are hung in a window or in the window above thedoor in houses without leaded glass. In recent years, with a renewed interest inChinese feng shui, octagonal ba gua geomantic mirrors have in some cases takentheir place, having the same apotropaic function (see Lip 1979, 109–13). Butmirrors and other reflective devices have one weak point. During thunderstormsthey are believed to attract lightning, which was viewed in the past as amaterial thunderbolt. In Britain wall anchors in the form of an S were believedto ward off lightning from a building. In Normandy houseleeks were planted onthe roof ridges of farmhouses for the same purpose. An eastern English way totry to keep lightning away from one’s dwelling is to bury a toad in the middleof the garden, with others at the four corners. This is quincunx magic, coveringan area by treating to four corners and the center. Bay trees planted around thegarden, the skin of a seal, and eagle feathers are also antilightning charms(Jobson 1966, 112).THE PENTAGRAMThe pentagram is an ancient apotropaic sign. It is also called pantacle,pentangle, pentagramma, Solomon’s Seal, Drudenfuss, and the rempham. It is knownfrom Lombardic and Alamannic sources before the year 700. Medieval and laterfolk magic gives the pentagram protective power over thresholds. Goethe, in hisFaust, makes the demon Mephistopheles gain access to Dr. Faustus’s house becausethe Drudenfuss is drawn inaccurately upon the threshold. A traditional Englishcounting song known as “The Twelve Apostles” tells “Five for the symbol at yourdoor,” which was interpreted by folk song collectors Broadwood and Maitland asthe threshold pentagram (Broadwood and Maitland 1893, 154–59). The pentagram hasan important place in sacred geometry because the fivefold division of thecircle is the starting point for the Golden Section ratio. Before the nineteenthcentury, the direction in which the pentagram pointed was not considered to besignificant. The concept of the evil inverted pentagram was invented byfollowers of French magus Éliphas Lévi. The medieval choir stalls in St.Botolph’s church at Boston, Lincolnshire, England, illustrated in figure 11.13show the medieval use of the pentagram in this orientation, certainly not withevil intention. The pentagram at the centerpiece of a medieval rose window inPaderborn Cathedral in Germany is also oriented in that manner. The starfish ispentagrammic in shape and was used as a magical protection. The fish calledstella (starfish) was to be fastened with the blood of a fox by a brass nail tothe gate as a preventive against “evil medicines” (Agrippa 1993 [1531], I,XLVI).HOUSE GLYPHS, SIGILS, AND SPELLSWhen bricks began to be used in buildings, they were handmade and fired inwood-burning stacks, so they were not all the same color. Bricklayers madepatterns in the walls they built, and a popular design was the diamond oring-rune shape. The protective pattern called God’s Eye and Godsoog on Englishand Dutch fishermen’s ganseys (sweaters) is an array of five diamonds. The sigilwas painted on wall plaques in fishermen’s inns, with the motto “God sees you,”warning the fishermen to behave properly when away from home. Traditionalknitters from Arnemuiden used diamond motifs symbolizing prosperity that camefrom the brickwork of the buildings in the fishing port (Van der Klift-Tellegen1987, 19, 36). In eastern England in the nineteenth century, bricks were beingmade on a large scale in different colors, so bricklayers chose contrastingcolored bricks to make diamond and ing-rune patterns. A house in St. Ives,Huntingdonshire, is shown in figure 11.14.image [../images/00054.jpeg]Fig. 11.14. Ing runes in brickwork on Victorian house, St. Ives, Cambridgeshire,England.On Twelfth Night in German-speaking countries, the Sternsinger (“star singers”)go around to houses carrying a paper or wooden star on a pole. They sing anEpiphany carol, then one of them writes in chalk over the door a formulaconsisting of the initials of the Three Wise Men in the Nativity story, Caspar,Melchior, and Balthasar, with crosses between them and the year date on eitherside; for example: 20 C+M+B 15. This is said to protect the house and itsinhabitants until the next Epiphany. Another German tradition is that if onedraws crosses on the doors before Walpurgisnacht (May Eve, after sunset on April30), the house is protected against witchcraft (Schmidt 1988, I, 93).image [../images/00055.jpeg]Fig. 11.15. C+M+B inscription 1999, Schwäbisch Gmünd, Germany.Written talismans and charms were attached to doorposts and lintels or hiddeninside them as an alternative. In sixteenth-century Wales, clergyman LewisMorgan of Aberedw was imprisoned for writing charms and putting them over doors(Simmonds 1975, 19). In England door charms were “supplied for a considerationby the fortune-tellers, astrologers, or ‘wise men’ of a neighborhood.” Harlandand Wilkinson recorded a text found over a door of a house near Burnley,northwest England. It read “Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn,Trine, Sextile, Dragon’s Head, Dragon’s Tail, I charge you all to gard thishause from all evils spirits whatever, and gard it from all Desorders, and fromaney thing being taken wrangasly, and give this family good Ealth & Welth” [sic](Harland and Wilkinson 1867, 62–63). Some charms were more literate, beingwritten in Greek or Latin, or with magical alphabets, magic squares, and sealsof planetary spirits. The Scots expression Arsé-Versé (English Arsy-Farcy)denotes a magic spell on the side or back of the house to ward off fire (Warrack1988 [1911], 9). The dialect word “arsy” means “backward” so the spell refers tosomething written backward (as with wend-runes) or on the back side of thehouse. In Scotland an evil spirit called Quhaip was nevertheless protective, forit was supposed to haunt the eaves of houses on the lookout for evildoers(Warrack 1988 [1911], 436)."},{"pageContent":"12Magical Protection against Supernatural and Physical AttackVIKING AGE MARITIME FIGUREHEADSEarly medieval ships in northern Europe carried removable images on the prow andstern posts. The dragons on Norse and Norman ships are the best known, servingto protect the ships against sea monsters and other evil denizens of the deep.Figureheads were removable so they could be taken from ships before docking orbeing dragged on shore, so that the land wights (landvættir) would not befrightened by them. Several old texts record the form and nature of these ships’figureheads, and they can be seen on the Bayeux Tapestry as well. They appear inthe account of the death of the Norwegian king, Olav Trygvason, in the maritimeBattle of Svolder in 1000 CE by Adam of Bremen (ca. 1080) and Saxo Grammaticus(ca. 1200) in his Gesta Danorum (ca. 1200) and in Snorri Sturluson’sHeimskringla. These accounts tell of ships called the Crane, the Long Serpent,the Short Serpent, and the Iron Ram. The king’s flagship had formerly belongedto a Pagan martyr tortured to death by Olav for refusing to become a Christian.This ship’s prow had a gilded dragon’s head and a crook shaped like a tail onthe stern.Before the sea battle in which the king’s navy was defeated and Olav died, hisenemies, the earl of Lade, Eirík Hákonarson, and the Swedish king SweinForkbeard, were on their flagship and looking out for the flagship of Olav. KingSwein is reported to have said that Olav was afraid of them so much that “hedare not sail with the dragon head on his ship.” As well as their figureheads,important ships were identified by colored sails. The Saga of Olav Tryggvasonrecounts Eirik Hákonarson’s attempts to identify the king’s ship, in which henotes a ship with striped sails as belonging to Erling Skjalgson as opposed tothe dragon’s-wing sails of the king’s vessel (Saga of Olav Tryggvason, chap.101–111). Sixty-six years later, Duke William’s ship Mora had a red sail.The Mora was the flagship of Duke William of Normandy’s invasion fleet in 1066.It had a special figurehead, and on top of the mast flew Gonfanon, theconsecrated banner given to William by the pope to empower him in his attempt tooverthrow the English king, Harold Godwinson. The figurehead of the Mora was abrass figure of a boy, holding a bow and arrow in his right hand, and blowing ahorn with his left. The Bayeux Tapestry shows this figure set astern, but Wace’saccount sets it on the prow (Bruce 1856, 93). Removable figures could be set ateither end of the ship, it seems. Other ships of the Norman invasion fleet hadfigureheads in the form of dragons, lions, and bulls. The Bayeux Tapestry showsthe ships of the Norman invasion fleet drawn up on the shore of England atPevensey, with all the figureheads removed. A ship shown still on the sea hasits figurehead in place; another has it already removed. The sockets for thefigureheads are clearly shown in the beached ships. The eleventh-century makersof the Bayeux Tapestry knew of the northern maritime practice, which wasobserved by Pagan and Christian alike.MAGIC BATTLE FLAGS AND STANDARDSMilitary flags and standards served to identify the army or unit in combatsituations. They embodied the power, spirit, and ethos of the fighting force andwere believed to bring it good fortune in battle. To capture the enemy’sstandard was a sign of victory; to lose one’s standard, defeat. As long as theflag was flying, there was still fight left in the troops. A standard thatbecame influential in the north was the dragon. This draco standard was adoptedby the Romans from tribal warrior horsemen: the Alans, Sarmatians, and Dacians.The Persian and Parthian cavalry also flew dragons. It was described by Arrianof Nicomedia in Ars Tactica (137 CE) as a long sleeve made from pieces of dyedmaterial sewn together. At the front was a hollow metal dragon’s head, supportedon a staff. The mouth faced into the wind, and the fabric body trailed behindand filled with air, giving the appearance of a dragon in flight. Trajan’sColumn in Rome depicts several Dacian examples of this standard. The Romanscopied their enemies and introduced the draco. Cavalrymen carrying the bannerwere called draconarii. They are depicted in the Strategikon, a military manualof the time of the eastern Roman emperor Maurikios (reigned 582–602 CE). Thelegendary King Arthur was said to have a dragon banner of this kind; his fatherwas Uther Pendragon, whose surname meant “head of the dragon.” Anglo-Saxon kingsalso had dragon banners, such as the white dragon of Wessex. The flag of Walestoday is a Y Ddraig Goch, a red dragon on a green-and-white background. It wasmade official in 1959.Between the ninth and eleventh centuries, the Raven Banner was the standard ofViking Age forces. The hrafnsmerki was a flag that depicted a black raven. Fromcontemporary images, it appears that the banner was triangular or semicircular.Its edge was adorned with tassels or ribbons. The Orkneyinga Saga tells how, inthe wind, the raven appeared to flap its wings and fly. There are extantdescriptive accounts of the Raven Banner, both its appearance and its use inbattle. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the year 878 records the capture from aViking force of a guðfani (battle flag), called “Raven” by the army of Wessex inDevon, western England. The Orkneyinga Saga (chap. 11) tells how the Norse earlof Orkney, Sigurd the Stout, had a Raven Banner made by his mother, who was avölva. The magic banner would bring victory to the man it was carried before inbattle, but the magic came at a price, for it would bring death to the actualstandard-bearer.At the Battle of Ashingdon in England in 1016, the army of King Cnut (Canute)had a white silk raven banner for their standard. Sturluson’s Heimskringlarecounts that Harald Hardrada’s raven banner was called Landøyðan, “Land Waster”(destroyer of lands). It was clearly a magic banner, promising victory to thosewho carried it (Haralds Saga Sigurðarsonar 22). The banner’s luck failed in1066, when Harald Hardrada’s invasion of England met with crushing defeat at theBattle of Stamford Bridge. The Bayeux Tapestry, commemorating the Battle ofHastings, the other famous battle of the fateful year 1066, has a depiction of aRaven Banner carried by one of Duke William’s cavalrymen. For his invasion ofEngland, Duke William of Normandy had the gonfanon, a personal banner that wasgiven to him by the pope. Heraldically it was argent, with a cross or in abordure azure: a gold (yellow) cross on a silver (white) background, surroundedby a blue border. This is shown on the Bayeux Tapestry, and it was carried inthe Battle of Hastings, in which William was victorious.A battle in which no fewer than four consecrated standards protected thewarriors was fought at Alverton (now Northallerton) and was recorded by Richardof Hexham. It was fought “between the first and the third hours” on Monday,September 22, 1138. Northern England had been invaded by King David I ofScotland’s army augmented by Pictish and Cumbrian contingents. They haddevastated the northern part of England. The Archbishop of York called a crusadeagainst the invaders, and a sacred standard was set up to call upon divineassistance and to serve as a rallying point. The carpenters brought a timberframe on wheels and erected a ship’s mast on it. This magic vehicle was the“Standard.” On the top of the mast they hung a silver pyx containing aconsecrated host, and from cross arms four magic flags taken from the churcheswhere they were kept: the banners of St. Peter the Apostle, St. Cuthbert ofDurham, St. Wilfrid of Ripon, and St. John of Beverley. The latter had beencarried in battle two hundred years earlier in 937 by King Æthelstan’s Englisharmy at Brunanburh. At Northallerton, William of Aumale commanded the Englishforces, and the outcome was a total rout of the invaders, and the survivors ofthe battle were hunted down and killed. After taking possession of the booty,which was found in great abundance, the English warriors returned home and“restored with joy and thanksgiving to the churches of the saints the bannerswhich they had received.” Because of the wheeled mast, the battle has alwaysbeen called the Battle of the Standard.Some magic flags were reputed to have an eldritch origin that invested them withspecial powers. In Scotland the Mackays possessed an otherworldly flag presentedto the clan by a fairy woman, and the Macleods preserved the Fairy Flag ofDunvegan, which was given to an ancient Macleod of Macleod on a visit to elfane(Carmichael 1911, 86). In eleventh-century England, Earl Siward of York wasgiven a banner named Ravenlandeye by a spectral being whom he met on theseashore. Wearing a wide-brimmed hat, the mysterious being had the attribute ofOdin. Siward, who fought against the Scottish king Macbeth, finally committedritual suicide. On his deathbed he ordered his servants to dress him in his coatof mail and, holding his sword, take him up upon the walls of York. From there,he leapt to his death so that he might die like a man, not like a beast on a bedof straw. For many years the Raven Banner hung in St. Mary’s church in York. Theretired standards of the British military are hung up in churches today. Onceits use in battle is over, the magic flag should be returned to its place ofkeeping, on sacred ground.image [../images/00056.jpeg]Fig. 12.1. Apotropaic beasts around the door of Kilpeck church, Herefordshire,England, ca. 1150.WIND VANES AND WEATHERCOCKSWind vanes are finely balanced artifacts that swivel on a fixed upright, drivenby the prevailing currents of wind. The wind vane appears as the final rune ofthe first ætt in the Common Germanic Futhark. It is the rune wunjo (Anglo-Saxonwyn). It signifies the function of a wind vane that moves according to thewinds, yet remains fixed in one place. Its reading is “joy,” obtained by havinga stable base but being in harmony with the surrounding conditions. Atraditional motto depicted with a weathercock in seventeenth-century emblembooks is “officium meum stabile agitare” (“it is my function to turn whileremaining stable”). In the Viking Age, gilded metal weathervanes were mounted onships, and similar ones were set up on stave churches in Norway. The RavenBanner had a similar form.The origin of weathercocks in the north is uncertain. They may have a southernorigin. Early records are few. A ninth-century weathercock is known fromBrescia, Italy, where Bishop Rampertus had one erected on the San FaustinoMaggiore church in 820 CE (Novati 1904–1905, 497). They were in use inAnglo-Saxon England, as in 862 CE when Bishop Swithun set a weathercock onWinchester Cathedral. (In England, St. Swithun’s Day, July 15, is connected withthe weather, as it carries folklore that warns of a rainy period of forty daysafterward, if it should rain on that day.) According to Ekkehard IV’s chronicleCasus sancti Galli (chap. 82), in 925 CE the monastery of St. Gallen had itsweathercock stolen by Magyar invaders who climbed the tower to remove it. InFrance in the year 965, a gilded weathercock on the abbey church of St. Pierreat Châlon-sur-Sâone was struck by lightning (Martin 1903–1904, 6). WestminsterAbbey in London is depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry, showing a man setting aweathercock on the top at its completion in 1065. Vanes and cockerels are notthe only forms of traditional wind markers. A medieval saying from France tellsus there are lions, eagles, and dragons on top of churches (Martin 1903–1904,10). Swans are features of churches in parts of Germany, especially in Oldenburgand East Frisia (Goethe 1971, 7–19).WOUND-PROOF MAGIC JACKETS AND BLOOD STANCHINGIn the medieval history of the Norwegian kings, the Heimskringla, the SaintÓláfs Saga recounts an event in the Battle of Stiklastad (Stiklarstaðir) inNorway in 1031. The Norwegian farmers had risen in rebellion against King ÓláfHaraldson’s arbitrary rule and his religious policy, under which he had torturedseveral Pagan martyrs to death for refusing to become Christian. One of theringleaders of the uprising, Thorir Hund, a devout Pagan, wore a magicreindeer-skin coat obtained from the “troll-wise Finns,” which rendered himwound-proof; that is, invulnerable to edged weapons. In the battle the rebelsled by Harek of Tjøtta (Hárekr ór Þjóttu) and Thorir fought their way through tothe king and tried to kill him. The king struck Thorir Hund over the shoulders,but his sword appeared blunted and would not cut, and it seemed that smoke cameout of Thorir’s reindeer-skin coat. Björn, the king’s marshal, then attempted tohit Thorir and, knowing he was wound-proof, turned his battle axe so that hecould strike Thorir with the hammer end instead of the sharp edge. Thorir fellback injured but ran his spear through Björn. Then the king was killed (ÓláfsSaga Helga, chap. 226–28). Scottish folklore tells of a magically protectivejacket worn by magicians, the warlock fecket, that had to be woven from theskins of water snakes at a certain phase of the March moon (Warrack 1988 [1911],656). A magical way of destroying a wound-proof man that features the numbernine repeatedly is described in the legend of Lord Soulis, which is recounted inchapter 13.The bloodstone is a traditional English remedy to stanch bleeding. According toEast Anglian custom, one is hung around the neck on a red silk ribbon, tied withthree knots at three-inch spacings. To activate a man’s bloodstone, nine dropsof women’s blood are dripped onto it, and for a woman, nine drops of men’s blood(John Thorne, personal communication). English bloodstones are not actuallygemstones, but specially made glass beads. In the author’s possession is an oldbloodstone from King’s Lynn, Norfolk, made of blood-red glass. A bloodstonerecorded in 1911 was of dark green glass containing white and orange twists(Porter 1969, 83). Similar glass artifacts have been found attached to scabbardsof Germanic swords dating from the first millennium CE. The magical function ofa scabbard is recorded by Sir Thomas Malory in Le Morte D’Arthur (Malory 1472,bk. I, chap. XXIII), where King Arthur receives the sword Excalibur and ascabbard for it. But although the sword is invincible, the scabbard is even morevaluable, because so long as he has it, he can never die from wounds. In 1865George Rayson noted an East Anglian remedy against nosebleed, to wear a skein ofscarlet silk around the neck, with nine knots tied down the front. The knotsshould be tied by a man for a woman, and vice versa. He made no mention of thebloodstone (Rayson 1865c, 217).HLUTR AND ALRAUNImages are part of many religions, and the Celtic, Germanic, Nordic, andSlavonic peoples had sacred images in households, at important places in thecountryside, such as crossroads, in wayside shrines, and in temples. In Pagantimes, devotees of gods and goddesses also possessed and venerated small images.Portable humanoid images were being made in the Palaeolithic era, but whether ornot they were goddesses cannot be known. Small images of Lares (householddeities) were certainly in existence in northern Europe in Roman times, alongwith other figurines. The Lares were kept in a house shrine, the Lararium. Inwhat is now France, the seventh-century Christian Capitularia Regum Francorumcondemned images made from rags, “the image which they carry through thefields.” In Old Norse a portable image was called hlutr. The Vatnsdœla Sagamentions Ingimund’s hlutr of the god Freyr, which disappeared and finally turnedup in Iceland. Images such as these were destroyed or hidden when the Christianreligion became dominant. Roots of humanoid form may have taken over from actualimages as less obviously Pagan in nature.image [../images/00057.jpeg]Fig. 12.2. Alraun, from the author’s collection.There is a saying in Franconia, Germany, that if someone has unexpectedly goodfortune he or she must “own an areile” (an Alraune or mannekin) (Lecouteux 2013,134), a natural or artificially altered root of humanoid form, of which themandrake is the best known.The magic mandrake (Mandragora officinarum) is a member of the botanical familythat includes the potato, tobacco, and woody nightshade species. It possesses aroot that appears to resemble the human form, and in former times this wasbelieved to shine at night like a lamp. The roots have two genders, man andwoman, mandrake and womandrake. Because such a root resembles the human form, itis considered to be an earth sprite whose magical powers can be harnessed forthe magician’s use. Womandrake roots were used as charms by women to promotechildbearing, to bring prosperity, and to bring lovers the objects of theirheart’s desire. Mandrake roots were also used in ceremonies to find out secretsand to locate lost property. The root of the mandrake resembles the roots ofother plants, including deadly nightshade, white bryony, and bramble(blackberry). The white bryony (Bryonia dioica) has a much dug-for root that wasused magically in the same way as the much rarer and far more expensive mandrakeroot. In Norfolk, England, white bryony is actually called mandrake.Because they were much sought after for their magical properties, artificialmandrake roots were made. In Germany they were called Erdmannekin or Alraun, andin Great Britain mannikin. In medieval Germany, carved wooden alrauns were madethat had grains of barley inserted in the places where hair or a beard shouldbe. The alraun was buried in sand for three weeks, after which it was dug up andthe grains had sprouted, making the appearance of hair. In Britain a moresophisticated method was used. In The Universal Herbal (1832), we are told:The roots of Bryony grow to a vast size and have been formerly, by impostors,brought into a human shape, carried about the country, and shown for Mandrakesto the common people. The method which these knaves practised was to open theearth round a young thriving Bryony plant, being careful not to disturb thelower fibres of the root; to fix a mould, such as used by those who make plasterfigures, close to the root, and then to fill the earth about the root, leavingit to grow to the shape of the mould, which is effected in one summer. (Green1832, 201)In 1832 this technique was seen as faking, but it appears to have been an oldmeans of making a root effigy for magical purposes. Magic employs images ofthings and symbols of them to accomplish what the real thing can do (Agrippa1993 [1531], II, XLIX). In his 1934 book The Mystic Mandrake, C. J. S. Thompsonnoted a report of a “manikin” made from a dried frog, with its head replaced bya root of Alpina officianarum (Thompson 1934, 122).Real mandrake was used medicinally as an anaesthetic. Mandrakes were reputed tohave the powers of rejuvenation and were used in love potions. In Britain, bythe twentieth century the mandrake was obtained by the Wild Herb Men (theEnglish rural fraternity of root diggers) only for horse doctoring (Grieve 1931,510–12; Hennels 1972, 79–80). A medieval belief about the mandrake warned thatit was dangerous to uproot the plant because to do so would bring certain deathwithin the year. So magicians devised a technique to overcome this. They tied adog to the plant and caused the dog to uproot it. But during the procedure, itwas necessary to stop up one’s ears, because when uprooted, the plant gave ahideous shriek, and hearing this horrendous sound was dangerous. Magically, analraun gave the owner protection against bad weather, warded off the nightmare,and assisted women during childbirth. Like the pothook, the alraun was seen asthe protector of the family. However, possession of the magic root was alsodangerous, for at some point its luck would run out.Alrauns had to be treated well, housed in a box, and wrapped in white linen orsilk. If an alraun was not respected, it would shriek its disapproval. This ispart of the tradition that “no mascot will bring good fortune to one who isunworthy of it” (Villiers 1923, 1). It was believed that if an alraun was putinto a glass bottle, it would transform into a spider or scorpion. It wassupposed that the “imp” within the bottle could perform magical services for theowner, but if he or she should die possessing such a bottle, then the Devilwould take his or her soul (Thompson 1934, 138). An alraun could not be disposedof easily, because it would inevitably return to the owner no matter what hadbeen done to it. Places where people had made a futile attempt to dispose of analraun gained an on-lay that brought misfortune to others who went there. In1630 in Hamburg the possession and sale of alrauns was prohibited, and threewomen were executed for possession (Thompson 1934, 135–36).HOLED STONESA stone with a natural hole through it is called a hagstone or holeystone. Theyhave been recognized as magical since ancient times. It was a tradition to hangone on the back of the door in stables to keep the horses calm at night (Glyde1872, 179; Evans 1971, 181–82), and over beds to ward off bad dreams. Thecustomary thread in Great Britain is a string of flax. Especially magicallypowerful are holeystones taken from the beach and threaded together into achain. A holeystone chain from Great Yarmouth on the east coast of England isillustrated here.image [../images/00058.jpeg]Fig. 12.3. Chain of holeystones from the seashore, Great Yarmouth, Norfolk,England.They are closely related to magic cords containing knots. Strings of magicaltalismans and amulets are worn as necklaces in many cultures; charm bracelets,called Wendekette and Friesenkette, in south German and Austrian tradition.Holed flints were used by the Arts and Crafts architect Edward Schroeder Priorat strategic points on the exterior walls of Henry Martyn Hall in Cambridge.Holed standing stones and holes through stones in buildings are traditionallyheld in reverence as places of healing and foresight, and oaths were taken onthem, a form of binding between two individuals. A holed stone called the OdinStone stood at Croft Odin on Orkney until it was destroyed by a farmer in 1814.Oaths were sworn on the stone, and an offering of bread, cheese, or cloth leftthere. In 1791 a young man was brought before the Elders of Orkney as an oathbreaker, “breaking the promise to Odin”; that is, an oath sworn on the stone.MAGICAL BINDINGSThe Web of Wyrd is likened metaphorically to a woven fabric made on a loom;equally it can be visualized as a series of threads knitted together. Knots arethe means by which garments are knitted, and people use knots to tie things upmagically as well as physically, bringing them to a full stop. The way to ravel(tie up, or bind) things magically as well as physically is to use a knot toentangle and entrap the designated target. Binding spells are intended to be themagical equivalent of physical knots, nets, and ropes. In mythology, powerful,dangerous beings are captured and bound by the godly powers of properorderliness. The Old Icelandic text Gylfaginning (34, 51) tells of the bindingof both the Fenris-Wolf and Loki, and Christian eschatology in the Book ofRevelation (20:1–3) describes the bondage of the Devil in chains for a thousandyears. The conjuring parsons of eighteenth-century Cornwall would “lay”troublesome spirits and imprison them inside objects such as the pommel of asword or a barrel of beer, or banish them to the Red Sea (Rees 1898, 266–67). InManchester in 1825 a boggart was trapped and bound under the dry arch of an oldbridge over the River Irwell for 999 years. Other magical binding legends andfolktales from northern Europe follow the same theme. A traditional carving ofthe chained Devil exists in Stonegate, York, England.In folk tradition the most feared power of the witch was the evil eye, “amagical and occult binding.” Magicians and witches claimed to have the power touse binding spells against merchants, so they could not buy or sell; againstships, so they could not sail; and against mills, so they would not grind corn.They were supposed to bind wells and reservoirs, so that water could not bedrawn from them. Magically, they bound the ground, so that nothing could growand be fruitful there, and neither could any building be put up. Writing aboutmagicians in 1621, Robert Burton mentions knots among other methods ofperforming magical acts upon people: “The means by which they work, are usuallycharms, images . . . as characters stamped on sundry metals, and at such andsuch constellations, knots, amulets, words, philtres, and so forth, whichgenerally make the parties affected melancholy” (Burton 1621, I, ii, I, sub.III). A person magically bound to do something, as in the expression “she isbound to die” is said to be spellbound. In his influential magical text of 1801,The Magus, which was largely plagiarized from H. C. Agrippa, Francis Barrettwrote:image [../images/00059.jpeg]Fig. 12.4. Bound devil, Stonegate, York, England.Now how is it that these kind of bindings are made and brought to pass, we mustknow. They are thus done: by sorceries, collyries, unguents, potions, binding toand hanging up of talismans, by charms, incantations, strong imaginations,affections, passions, images, characters, enchantments, imprecations, lights,and by sounds, numbers, words, names, invocations, swearings, conjurations,consecrations, and the like. (Barrett 1801, 50)A binding spell usually employed knots of some kind, but not always. Anaccusation of binding magic took place in 1662 in the Scottish highlands, whenIsobel Gowdie of Auldern was tried for witchcraft. She made a long and detailedconfession that led to her being sentenced to death: “Before Candlemas we wentby east Kinloss, and there we yoked a plough of toads. The Devil held theplough, and John Young, our Officer, did drive the plough. Toads did draw theplough as oxen, couchgrass was the harness and trace chains, a gelded animal’shorn was the coulter, and a piece of a gelded animal’s horn was the sock.” Thesock is the ploughshare. Using the horns of castrated animals to form thecoulter and share of the plough would have been a magical act employing parts ofinfertile animals to bind the ground and render the earth infertile. This isanalogous to the Old Norse magical procedures of driving out the land wights andthereby rendering the ground álfreka. Of course, it is impossible to plough afield using toads.In Welsh Witchcraft (1975), L. Simmonds tells of a quincunx ritual of bindingperformed at Llanfechan, Wales. No date is given. A farmer lost several sheep,dead for no apparent reason, so he sent for a wizard from Welshpool to sort itout. The wizard asked the farmer to lead him to the exact center of the farm,and there he set up an ash pole. Then four more were set up, each twenty-fiveyards from the first, to the north, east, west, and south of the center. Thenthey walked round the center pole and went to each of the other four poles inorder. At each direction they stood in silence as the wizard stared into space.With “will to do . . . bid to do,” the rite was over, and afterward no moresheep died (Simmonds 1975, 20). A nineteenth-century magical manuscript byFrederick Hockley is indicative of the areas magicians believed themselvescapable of dealing with. It has a spell “to bind the ground, whereby neithermortal nor spiritual beings can approach within a limited distance.” This wasachieved by making a magic circle of enormous dimensions. The diameter of thesecircles could be one hundred feet, more or less, according to the operator’sdesire, or even larger with the intention of keeping all earthly or spiritualbeings away from the place by between a quarter of a mile and a mile. Like theLlanfechan ritual, it involved the four quarters, north, east, south, and west,with a magical talisman containing the Seal of the Earth buried at each spot.KNOT MAGICThe thorn-bearing, winding, and tangling shrubs bramble (blackberry, Rubusfruticosus) and blackthorn (sloe, Prunus spinosa) both have turning-relatednames in Irish, dreas and draion. They are plants that form barriers in thicketsand hedgerows and turn back or entangle animals and people who try to gothrough. Becoming entangled in thickets of thorns is a physical example of whatwas believed to happen to spirits when encountering magically charged knots andpatterns. Nowadays, Cat’s Cradles made from string are seen as a children’sgame, although identical string-knotting patterns are part of the repertoire ofbinding magic. In Scandinavia they are called trollknutar (“magic knots”), partof the northern circumpolar tradition of string-magic linked to shamanicpractices. The northern English and Scots word warlock, meaning a cunning man orpractitioner of spellcraft, is rarely used today except pejoratively. Becausedictionaries have given it meanings such as “liar” and “deceiver,” the word hasfallen from use. Magically, the power of warlockry is the ability to shut in orenclose; that is, a person who can perform binding spells. A warlock can make awarlock brief, binding knots, physical or psychic, intended to ward off evilspirits and to lock up or bind their effects.There is a large body of lore from the north linking nine knots with healing andwarding off illness as well as ill-wishing. The nine knots tied in the silkthread for English bloodstones have been mentioned above. A charm from theOrkney Islands, recorded in 1895, which used a thread of nine knots as a curefor an injured wrist or ankle, is typical. It was put on with this spell:Nine knots upon this threadNine blessings on thy headBlessings to take away thy painAnd ilka tinter of thy strain fire(MACKENZIE 1895, 73)Knots made in rope, cord, and netting for practical and magical purposes, aswell for women’s hair-braiding, and interlaces made during performances such assword dancing, are transitory, and there are few surviving examples from ancienttimes. But as the tradition continued into the present day, we have anunderstanding of some of their meaning in the unrecorded past. Certain kinds ofknots played a part in magical tradition. The witch knot was a particular charmworn in a woman’s hair, while the triple knot called a St. Mary knot was araveling used to hamstring animals and, by association, prevent actionsmagically. Sea witches also sold the winds in ropes tied with three knots. Inhis 1827 short story “The Two Drovers” in Chronicles of the Canongate, SirWalter Scott recorded a Scottish knot custom associated with livestock: “It maynot be indifferent to the reader to know that the Highland cattle are peculiarlyliable to be taken, or infected, by spells and witchcraft, which judiciouspeople guard against by knitting knots of peculiar complexity on the tuft ofhair which terminates the animal’s tail” (Scott n.d. [1885], 171). This wasknown as St. Mungo’s knot, and a knot known as the meltie bow was tied on thecudgels used by herd boys to protect the cattle from harm (Warrack 1988 [1911],354). In the late nineteenth century, Arthur Moore noted an account from theIsle of Man in which a young man found a woman performing a ritual at acrossroads near Regaby. She was sweeping a circle with a besom (twig broom). Hetook the besom from her and found that it had “17 sorts of knots” on it. Heburned it at midday, and “soon after its destruction the woman died” (Moore1891, 91).image [../images/00060.jpeg]Fig. 12.5. Dragons and binding knots on corner of timber-frame building,Limburg, Germany.In Great Britain and Ireland, ancient examples exist of interlaced knotworkcarved in stone and wood, tooled on leather, engraved on metal, and drawn inmanuscripts. Today, this artistic knotwork is called Celtic Art, after the booksof J. Romilly Allan, John G. Merne, and George Bain publicized the ancient artform under that name in the first half of the twentieth century. Many patternsare common to Ireland, the Isle of Man, Wales, Scotland, England, Scandinavia,and Germany. The ninth-century gritstone cross of Hywel ap Rhys, ruler ofGlywysing, south Wales (d. 886), is shown in figure 12.6.image [../images/00061.jpeg]Fig. 12.6. Celtic Cross of Hywel ap Rhys, 886 CE, Llantwit Major, Wales.image [../images/00062.jpeg]Fig. 12.7. Fionn’s shields, Irish Ogham. The Library of the European TraditionPatterns called liuthrindi are known from ancient Ireland, used in a militarycontext to disorient enemies. The Irish Ogham sigil Feisifín, Fionn’s Shield,can be in a circular or square form. It served as a protective talisman, and itsform also resembles certain Icelandic sigils.The simplest interlaced knot, the fourfold loop, is a very ancient magicalsigil. It exists in Roman mosaics of the Imperial period, and early Lombardicand Romanesque churches in Germany, Switzerland, and Italy have the sign carvedin stone on column capitals, fonts, and stone screens, where they appear amongother interlace patterns. In the north, one survives on a memorial stone on theisland of Gotland in the Baltic Sea (Havor II, Hablingbo parish). Dated between400 and 600 CE (Nylén and Lamm 1981, 39), it appears also on bracteates fromDenmark of similar date (Wirth 1934, VIII, pl. 424, fig. 1b; pl. 427, 7b). Thisand other protective glyphs were carved by the shipwrights on the pivoted woodenoar covers of the Viking Age ship excavated at Gokstad. On the Isle of Man, itexists on the Andreas Cross. It can be found widespread in medieval graffiti inGreat Britain (see Pritchard 1967, 133). This simple knot is called Sankt HansVapen in Sweden, and in Finland and Estonia it is Hannunvaakuna (Strygell 1974,46). One is shown on a 1673 engraving of a Sámi shaman’s drum in JohannesSchefferus’s Lapponia. In 1901 the Arts and Crafts architect W. R. Lethaby usedthe pattern in the tracery of the north transept window in his symbolic churchat Brockhampton, Herefordshire, England (Mason 2001, 14).With an additional central cross loop, this fourfold loop was used ontraditional English clog almanacs to mark All Saints’ Day, November 1 (seeSchnippel 1926, pl. II and III). In the Country Calendar, it represents themidpoint between autumn and winter, and from this it has become the sigil forSamhain used by present-day Pagans (see Pennick 1990, 35, figs. 8, 13, 26, 35).A sigil composed of three interlaced equilateral triangles is seen frequentlytoday as a symbol of northern religion. It is the Valknut (Valknute, Valknut, orValknútr), the “knot of the fallen” (i.e., the slain). Among the earliest knownexamples of the sigil are found on some memorial stones on Gotland and on ringsand other Viking Age metalwork. It is associated with the god Odin (Thorsson1984, 107; 1993, 11; Aswynn 1988, 15–54).A different form of triangular knot, with a superimposed cross, is known asSankt Bengt’s Wapen (Strygell 1974, 46). In the Alps some people called up thedemonic entity called Schratl by magic at crossroads, but the apotropaic devicecalled Schratterlgatterl or Schradlgaderl is a means of warding off evilspirits, blocking their paths with a physical binding knot. This device was madefrom seven slivers of wood, interleaved to hold together without binding withcords. It was hung on doors or gates considered at risk from spirit attack (vonAlpenburg 1857, 369; Bächtold-Stäubli 1927–1942, I, 297). Old Scratch’s Gate isa similar magical binding pattern used in East Anglian magic. Old Scratch is abyname for the Devil, and the sigil was chalked on doors and shutters to blockthe entry of evil. Every form of magic has a magical antidote, and a story toldby the Anglo-Saxon chronicler Bede (Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, IV,22) tells of a runic antidote to binding. In the year 679, Bede wrote, theshackles fell off Imma, a Northumbrian prisoner, every time his brother saidChristian prayers for his soul, believing he was dead. Imma was asked “whetherhe knew loosening runes and was carrying staves with him written down.”Loosening runes had a Latin name, litteras solutorias.image [../images/00063.jpeg]Fig. 12.8. Valknut."},{"pageContent":"13Practical MagicPatterns and Sigils THRESHOLD AND HEARTHSTONE PATTERNSIn parts of Great Britain was a custom of marking the threshold or hearth withknotlike patterns to bring good luck and ward off harm. The expert ontraditional buildings Sidney R. Jones noted in 1912, “Villagers throughout thenorth of England make a practice of sanding the steps to doorways. It is an oddcustom, many years old, which still survives. The stone step is run over withwater, partly dried, and to the damp surface is applied dry sand or sandstone.Varied are the patterns that are worked on risers and treads” (Jones 1912, 114,116). In various parts of England and Scotland where the practice survived longenough to be recorded, they were drawn with chalk, pipe clay, or sand (Canney1926, 13). They were made every year on particular meaningful days. In Cambridgethis was Foe-ing Out Day, March 1. Some are illustrated in figure 13.1.There is a pattern seemingly local to the town of Cambridge, called theCambridge Box. In Newmarket and Cambridge, a continuous loop pattern was alsochalked around the edges of floors in stables and outhouses. Clearly anapotropaic pattern, it is called the “running eight.” This pattern had to bemade in a single movement without stopping during the process. Ella Mary Leatherdescribes threshold patterns of chalk in the English West Midlands villages ofWeobley and Dilwyn: “The stone would be neatly bordered with white when washed,with a row of crosses within the border” (Leather 1912, 53).image [../images/00064.jpeg]Fig. 13.1. Threshold patterns from England and Scotland.North of Herefordshire, in Shropshire, patterns were made by rubbing bunches ofelder, dock, or oak leaves on the stone. In Eaton-under-Heywood in Shropshire,patterns were “laid” on thresholds, stone steps leading to bedrooms, and thehearthstone. Their function was to prevent the Devil from coming down thechimney (Dakers 1991, 169–70). Comparable to these temporary patterns arepermanent flooring patterns made from traditional materials: bones, cobbles,bricks, and tiles, and in some places they are related to patterns in brickworkand clothing (Van der Klift-Tellegen 1987, 36–38). The patterns of traditionalbit mats or rag rugs resemble those made in brickwork and drawn on hearthstonesand thresholds. Patterns often have a diamond in the center, a border andtriangles at the corner. Bit mats are made of recycled fabric from worn-out oldclothes cut into strips and attached to a fabric base (Dixon 1981, 46–47).image [../images/00065.jpeg]Fig. 13.2. Threshold cross of pebbles, Welshpool, Wales.THE BINDING OF LORD SOULISThe story of Lord William Soulis contains many elements of traditional northernmagic, and a border ballad composed by John Leyden preserved an older legend inrhyme. Hermitage Castle where Soulis lived was a key fortress on the borderlandsof England and Scotland. According to the ballad, Soulis was a cruel andtreacherous tyrant who oppressed his vassals and slaves as much as he did hisenemies. But he was also a practitioner of magic who had a familiar spritecalled Old Redcap. Redcap made Soulis magically wound-proof, so he could not beharmed by edged weapons, neither could he be bound by chain nor rope, but onlyby sand, which cannot be made into ropes:While thou shalt live a charmed life,And hold that life of me,’Gainst lance and arrow, sword and knife,I shall thy warrant be.Nor forged steel, nor hempen band,Shall e’er thy limbs confine,Till threefold ropes of twisted sandAround thy body twine(HALL 1867, 147–48)Soulis’s enemies finally ambushed him, but their weapons would not bite. Butstill they succeeded in forcing him to the ground. But when they bound him withropes, they broke. Then they used chains, and these too would not hold. Onlymagical ropes could bind him, and the magic number nine appears in the formula.Sand was taken from the stream called Nine-Stane Burn. Nine handfuls of barleychaff were added and threefold plaited ropes made from it. The ropes of sandwere contained inside tubes of lead, and it was these with which Soulis wasbound. Then, wrapped in leaden bonds that disempowered his magic, he was throwninto a cauldron. They set it upon a fire at Nine Stane Rigg, the ridgeseparating Teviotdale and Liddesdale, on top of which was a megalithic circle ofnine standing stones. Then Lord Soulis was boiled to death in the cauldroninside the circle.STRAW BINDINGS, KNOTS, AND FIGURESStraw, the by-product of grain farming, has many uses. Straw rope or netting wasused in the western seaboard of Europe to tie down roof thatch, which itself isoften made of straw. Traditional bee skeps are made from straw rope, in the formof a spirally wound dome, stitched together. Straw is also woven into hats andshoes, sometimes for temporary and ceremonial use (see Evans 1957, 278; Bärtsch1998 [1933], 59–82). Special straw crosses are made in Ireland in celebration ofSt. Brigid’s Day (February 1). Straw plaits are most associated with thetermination of the harvest, where making special items by plaiting straw was acommon practice. In many parts of Europe, the final sheaf of corn to be cut wasmade into a humanoid figure that was carried ceremonially with the harvest beingtaken to the farmyard and took an honored place in the harvest feast thatfollowed. An account of the harvest in Norfolk in August 1826 tells how “thelast or ‘horkey load’ . . . is decorated with flags and streamers, and sometimesa sort of kern baby is placed on the top at the front of the load” (Hone 1827,II, 1166). A visitor to the Cambridge Folk Museum in 1951 told the curator EnidPorter of a tradition from his grandmother’s early years in Litlington; how thefarmer held up the last shock of corn, then one of the men made a humanoidfigure with head, arms, and legs from it. At the horkey supper, the figure satin a special chair during the feast. After the meal, it was set on top of thecorner cupboard, in the holy corner (Porter 1969, 123).Nowadays, the name “corn dolly” is used to describe any of the numerous forms ofstraw plaiting formerly connected with the harvest in Great Britain, whetherhumanoid or not. But the name “corn dolly” is of recent origin; the contemporarynames of straw plaits when they were in use being “kirn maiden,” “kirn baby,”“neck,” “ben,” and “fan.”The origin of “dolly” as their name comes from a meeting of the Folk-LoreSociety in London, February 20, 1901, when “Mrs. Gomme exhibited and presentedto the society a Kirn Maiden or Dolly, copied by Miss Swan from those made atDuns in Berwickshire” (Folk-Lore 12, 1, June 1901, 11, 129). In a letter toGomme, Swan wrote: “I am sure that there was a good-luck superstition attachedto the making and preserving of it, although it was not much talked about. TheKirn I sent you, though a modern dolly, is a faithful reproduction of those Ihave seen and helped to dress ‘lang syne’” (Folk-Lore 12, 1, 215–16). The imagethat Mrs. Gomme showed the folklorists was not made from the last sheaf for theharvest but was a replica. Not being an actual Kirn Maiden used in harvest ritesand ceremonies, it was called a dolly, just as a dolly represents a real babybut is not one. From the 1950s onward the generic name “dolly” became the norm.Like the name “witch posts,” it has no historic authenticity.image [../images/00066.jpeg]Fig. 13.3. Border Fan straw plait, Melverley, Shropshire, England.In 1951 the organizers of the Festival of Britain in London commissioned mastersof straw plaiting to make masterworks of the genre to celebrate the ancientcraft. Old and new designs were put on show side by side; the Essex strawplaiter Fred Mizen made a straw lion and unicorn (Cooper 1994, 62), while Arthur“Badsey” Davis made a crown-shaped plait from forty-nine straws, a design nowknown as “Badsey’s Fountain” (Sandford 1983, 56). It is likely that this formoriginated as the crown of the hay rick (Lambert and Marx 1989, 88). Davis camefrom a Worcestershire family that had handed down the craft’s secrets throughthe male line for generations. George Ewart Evans notes a man from north Essexwho made straw plaits at Blaxhall, Suffolk. He did not put them on the lastload, but they were used in the church as decoration during the time of theHarvest Festival (Evans 1965, 214). Traditionally, straw plaiting was done bymen until the 1951 Festival of Britain, when the Women’s Institute took it up.Now, mistakenly, it is seen as a traditional women’s craft, and some who makecorn dollies throughout the year view their work as worship of the Goddess.TRADITIONAL PATTERNS, SIGILS, AND GLYPHSThe skills of self-making are essential in traditional society. The rural poor,and those whose work was independent of masters, or in some way not allied tothe urban collective—such as carters, drovers, boatmen, and fishermen andfishwives—retained personal craft skills that were downgraded in towns by theindustrial revolution. Their home-crafted clothes, self-made tools, and utensilswere often considered rustic or rural by urban dwellers and inferior tomanufactured goods. Knitwear is strongly associated with the areas bordering theNorth Sea, where hardy sheep have been herded for thousands of years. Thepatterns on traditional woolen knitwear have customary meanings, containing avast repertoire of symbolic patterns that vary from place to place. Embedded intraditional country and coastal crafts are techniques and patterns that go backperhaps thousands of years. In them the meaningful symbolism and magic of makingand the artifacts made affirms the positive values of continuity andself-reliance. The individual designs on traditional fishermen’s knitwear fromScotland, England, and the Netherlands are assembled from a repertoire ofsymbolic patterns that include the cable, flag, tree of life, fishbone, waves,and lightning bolt or zigzag.Each pattern has its own lore, some of it magical. The ing-runerelated patternof five diamonds called “God’s Eye” in East Anglia has the same name in Dutch,Godsoog. A woman in IJmuiden told knitting researcher Henriette van derKlift-Tellegen that the Godsoog on the sweater looks after the seamen in strangeports, and also that the pattern enables men to find the front in the dark andput it on the right way round. In the Netherlands it is viewed as essentially anEnglish pattern (van der Klift-Tellegen 1987, 19). On the east coast of Britain,the decline of the fishing industry in the late twentieth century broke up manyof the communities that had sustained the knitting tradition. Those that stillexist now continue as emblems of local identity. Various patterns from Amble,Cullercoats, Flamborough, Newbiggin, Patrington, Seahouses, Scarborough,Staithes, and Whitby are preserved, and new ganseys are knitted according tothese traditions. Also extant are the jersey patterns of the Keel and Sloop menon the inland waterways around the River Humber, inland from Hull as far southas Lincoln and Nottingham. They include moss stitch, chevron, hexagram, diamond,tree of life, and chequers.MAGIC IN MAKING EVERYDAY THINGSThere is no distinction between religion and magic in traditional societies. Itis only a matter of semantics how we describe the saying of prayers,incantations, and making signs when something is done. There are many small actstaught as integral with making and doing, such as making the sign of a crossover food. In brewing and baking, for example, the sigil known as “two heartsand a crisscross” was traditionally used to protect the mash or dough. It iscomposed of two hearts with a cross in between. In 1895 F. T. Elworthy notedthat an old man in Somerset had told him that in brewing, before the mash wascovered up to ferment, the sigil was drawn to ward off the pixies (Elworthy1895, 287).Robert Herrick in his Hesperides (1648) alludes to this in a Charm:This I’ ll tell ye by the way,Maidens, when ye leavens lay,Crosse your dow [dough], and your dispatchWill be better for your batch.(HERRICK 1902 [1648], 298)In addition to the invoking of the intrinsic magical powers of the cross and thehearts, bakers used a pin to prick the emblem into biscuits, the “pricking”mentioned in the British nursery rhyme Pat-a-cake, Pat-acake, Baker’s Man. image [../images/00067.jpeg]Fig. 13.4. German ring bread with crosses.ICELANDIC SIGIL MAGICIcelandic sigil magic is extant in medieval magical manuscripts such as theHlíðarendabók, the Huld Manuscript, the Galdrabók, the Kreddur Manuscript, and anumber of other original texts preserved in the National Library in Reykjavik.This sigil magic is not unique, as is often claimed, but part of the Europeanmainstream magical use of seals, talismans, and magical warding signs. Sigils ofsimilar form and construction appear in numerous mainland Euopean grimoires,including The Lesser Key of Solomon (see Waite, 1911; Mathers, MacGregor, andCrowley, 1997). But in Iceland the sigils appear to have been widespread in folkmagic and, more importantly, were collected together and written down, so wehave records of many sigils, along with their names and accompanying spells ofempowerment. In classical European magic, such complex sigils represent and giveaccess to particular spirits, which then are commanded to do the magician’sbidding. General warding signs and magical sigils not intended to invoke spiritsare used in traditional trades and crafts. These are known in many other partsof Europe. In Icelandic sigil magic all human necessities are provided for.The Ægishjálmur (“helm of awe,” cover or shield of terror), is the best known ofall Icelandic magical sigils. Ruling over the eight directions, it is the sigilof comprehensive, irresistible power. Its function is to induce fear in one’sopponents, thereby dominating them. In the Nibelungenlied legend, the helm ofawe was gained by Sigurd Fafnirsbane when he slew the dragon Fafnir. AfterChristianization, Sigurd was said to be one of the spectral riders in theÅsgårdsrei along with Thor, who had been relegated from the status of god tothat of evil spirit. But the Ægishjálmur remained as a powerful magical sigil.Another Icelandic magical symbol, the Salomons Insigli (the “Sign of Salamon,”named for the Jewish king Solomon), does not refer to the common hexagram orpentagram, but rather to a sigil that is a form of the Ægishjálmur.image [../images/00068.jpeg]Fig. 13.5. Helm of Awe. Painting by Nigel Pennick, 1993In Anglo-Norman heraldry, this sigil is the Escarbuncle, and in German heraldry,Glevenrad or Lilienstapel. Technically, the pattern arose in the armorers’ craftas a means of strengthening a shield (Fox-Davies 1925, 64, 290–91). The image ofthe Helm of Awe and the heraldic Escarbuncle and Glevenrad is that of a blindinglight dazzling the onlooker. As its Anglo-Norman name tells us, the heraldicemblem represents the carbuncle, the fiery red gemstone that we call a ruby. Thecharacteristic of the carbuncle was to shine in the dark “like a live coal,” forthe Latin word carbunculus means “a little coal.” Albertus Magnus wrote that thecarbuncle was ascribed the powers of all other gemstones (Albertus Magnus 1569,II, ii). It possessed a virtue against all airy and vaporous poisons (Agrippa1993 [1531], I, XIII). The carbuncle is ruled magically by the red starAldebaran, the eye of Taurus the bull. The Old French saga Le Pélérinage deCharlemagne (The Pilgrimage of Charlemagne) tells that Charlemagne’s bedchamberwas reputed to be lit up by a carbuncle.Charlemagne features as the emblem of power and stability in the Icelandic sigilcalled Karlamagnúsar Hringar (The Rings of Charlemagne). This sigil purports torepresent nine rings of help sent by God with his angel to Pope Leo to be givento Charlemagne to protect him against his enemies. The Roman, Byzantine,Carolingian, and Ottonian emperors, as well as many early medieval kings, hadtheir own monograms composed of the letters of their names (Weber 1940, 334–42).They may well have been tattooed upon slaves as a sign of ownership (Gustafson2000, 17–31). It is possible that magicians used these emblems of imperial poweras sigils in their magical operations. It is clearly part of mainland Europeanmagic connected with a strong Christian orientation. Charlemagne was the HolyRoman emperor who suppressed Paganism in Saxony and resisted Islamic invaders inFrance, so he was the epitome of a defender of the faith. Charlemagne’s sigil isthreefold, three rings of three, and the accompanying spell is empowered by thethree holy names: “In nomine Patris et Filio et Spiritu Sanctu Amen” [sic]. Itis therefore a ninefold charm, composed of nine rings, each with a correspondingpower. Nine is the ancient northern magic number, and although ascribed to PopeLeo and Charlemagne, the nine rings are redolent of the tale of Draupnir, “thedripper,” a magic artifact made by two dwarf artisans for Odin. Draupnir’s magicwas that from it every ninth night, eight new rings dropped.The first ring of Charlemagne protects against the wiles of the Devil, attacksby enemies, and troubles of the mind. The second ring prevents collapse of thewill, fear, and sudden death. The third turns back the hatred of one’s enemiesupon themselves so that they are fearful and retreat. The fourth ring is againstwounds from swords; the fifth against being disorientated by magic and losingone’s way; while the sixth wards against persecution by powerful, evil men. Theseventh circle brings triumph in legal disputes and general popularity; theeighth suppresses fear, and the ninth wards off all vices and debauchery. Whenexpecting the enemy to come, these nine circles of Charlemagne are intended tobe worn on the chest or on either side of the body. In its form, this sigil alsoresembles the seal of the evil spirit Forneus, a sea monster who teaches allarts and sciences and reconciles enemies (see Waite 1911, 204–5).image [../images/00069.jpeg]Fig. 13.6. Anglo-Saxon magic rings. Top: gold ring with runic magic inscriptionfrom Kingsmoor, Cumbria, England. Below: gold ring with sigils at each end,Peterborough, England. The Library of the European TraditionIcelandic magical staves protected against everyday problems: Kaupaloki helpedmerchants to close deals and enjoy prosperous businesses; Þjófastafur warded offthieves, or exposed their deeds; Angurgapi was carved on the ends of barrels toprevent leaking; Veiðistafur gave luck to fishermen; vegvísir helped marinerskeep on course and ride out bad weather, while farmers used Tóustefna to keepfoxes away. This was the magic used to get by in everyday life. VarnarstafurValdemars, “Valdemar’s Protection Stave,” was used to augment the user’s statusand happiness. Gambling and sporting contests are uncertain pastimes, and everyculture has magical spells and practices to give the contestant an edge over theopposition. In 1905 Willard Fiske noted a charm: “If thou wishest to win atbackgammon, take a raven’s heart, dry it in a spot on which the sun does notshine, crush it, then rub it on the dice.” Another talisman used a differentpart of a bird: “In order to win at kotra, take a tongue of a wagtail, and dryit in the sun; crush and mix it afterward with communion-wine, and apply it tothe points of the dice, then you are sure of the game.” A kotruvers (spell) forwinning at backgammon was recorded by Jón Arnason. It called upon the power offamous Norse kings. “The kotrumenn (backgammon players) should call ‘Olave,Olave, Harold, Harold, Erik, Erik.’ The one wishing to win must write thisformula in runes and either carry it somewhere on him, or let it lie under thebackgammon board, on his knees, while he is playing. He must also recite theLord’s prayer in honor of St. Olave, the king” (Fiske 1905, 346).Contestants in glíma (wrestling) used the sigils Ginfaxi and Gapaldur. Writtenon parchment, Ginfaxi and Gapaldur were put in the wrestler’s shoes so theywould operate during the bout. Ginfaxi was worn under the toes of the left foot,while Gapaldur was put beneath the heel of the right foot. Dunfaxi, carved on apiece of Oak, was used to win in legal cases. There were also magical sigils andformulae used to call up evil spirits and awaken draugr revenants (stafur til aðvekja upp draug); ones against harmful magic (stafur gegn galdri); and onesusing magic against other people, such as the fear-inducing Óttastafur; andDreprún, the Death Rune, which is actually a sigil and not a rune (Davíðsson1903, passim; Flowers 1989, 59–103). The housebreaking sigil and spellLásabrjótur, the “lock-breaker” or “castle-breaker,” evoked the power of trollsto move the bolt inside the door, pulling it so the Devil’s squeak would beheard (the bolt sliding open). It was to be laid on the lock and breathed upon.One of the powers ascribed northern European folk magicians is the ability toget through locked doors. In East Anglia, eastern England, the adage “no door isever closed to a toadman” expressed the belief that someone who possessed thetoad bone had the power of invisibility and unauthorized entry.image [../images/00070.jpeg]Fig. 13.7.

Warveterans often talk about a bullet “with your number on it” that inescapablydooms one to die. Numbers and counting appear to be embedded in the selection ofsacrificial victims. In the fifth century CE, Sidonius Apollinaris noted thecustom of Saxon pirates who sacrificed each tenth captive to the god of the seaas a thanksgiving for a successful voyage before setting sail for home (Dalton1915, VIII, 6, II, 150). This is the Roman custom of decimation. The means ofselection of victims for sacrifice is often described as “drawing lots,” but anumber sequence recalled in Finnish and Swedish labyrinth traditions may be asurviving example of a particular means of selection. Two small rock-cutlabyrinths on the island of Skarv in the Stockholm Archipelago, Sweden, areaccompanied by a long rectangle in which the sequence is carved (Kern 1983,411). This sequence is also known from runic calendars from Norway (Davis 1867,472).The number sequence is called St. Peter’s Game, Pietarinleikki (Finnish), SanktPäders Lek (Swedish), or Sankt-Peters-Spiel (German). In ancient rock carvings,medieval clog almanacs, and primestaves this sequence is depicted as a series ofcrosses and uprights, drawn between two parallel lines. It is a method ofdividing 30 into two equal parts, picking out every ninth one. This is thesequence XXXXIIIIIXXIXXXIXIIXXIIIXIIXXI (4, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2,1).image [../images/00072.jpeg]Fig. 13.9. Sámi world pillars with rods and Pietarinleikki. Eighteenthcenturyengraving. The Library of the European TraditionHermann Kern states that this “game” is widespread in northern Europe and knownas far back as the tenth century in Germany, where it was called Josephsspiel orJudenersäufespiel (Kern 1983, 411). According to the explanatory tale, a shipcarrying Christians and Jews was overtaken by a storm that threatened to sinkit. St. Peter was on board, and he resolved that it was necessary to throw halfof the passengers overboard to save the rest. It was agreed that as there werethirty people on board, fifteen Jews and fifteen Christians, fifteen would haveto die, and they would stand in line and every ninth one would be thrownoverboard. St. Peter arranged them so Christians and Jews were in the sequence,then picked out every ninth person. This meant that only Jews were thrownoverboard (Davis 1867, 472). While this tale is framed as a pro-Christian,anti-Semitic polemic, the connection of the sequence with throwing peopleoverboard is redolent of Sidonius’s account of the practices of Saxon pirates(Ahrens 1918, II, 118–68)."},{"pageContent":"14The Magic of MusicSOUND AND NOISESince time immemorial, it has been recognized that rhythm and harmony impartgrace to the inner parts of the soul. The human soul, it appears, being one withthe cosmos, responds to the same cosmic harmonies. Aristotle wrote that musichas the power to lead the soul back from states of unrest to that of harmony, torelieve mental illnesses and to rectify the character. Sound has a significanteffect on the environment, and noise-making devices are used throughout theworld at rites and ceremonies that serve to drive off bad luck and evilinfluences. Shouting and singing, clapping hands, and stamping feet need noinstruments, but for continuous loud noises something more is required. Rattles,clappers, buzzers, drums, bells, and fireworks all have their part in ceremonialand magical performance. In preindustrial times before ubiquitous machine-madenoise was everywhere, there was real silence. The Scots expressionhowe-dumb-dead describes the dead silence in the middle of the night, and “thedead of night” is a comparable English expression (Warrack 1988 [1911], 274).But silence in the night, let alone the day, is a rare thing in industrializedcountries now.In former times, before machine noise was everywhere, calls from instrumentssuch as the lur, the alphorn, the Midwinterhoorn, and the highland bagpipeswould carry for significant distances under the right conditions, for there wasno extraneous noise to obliterate them, as is the case today with incessantmotor traffic and aviation. Similarly, church bells could be heard miles away,and the state of the weather could be inferred by the varied sound qualities ofthe ringing. Church bells especially were considered to suppress all spirits andeldritch beings that were within their sound range. As Arthur William Moorewrote in 1891, “It is well known that all Fairies and their like have a greatobjection to noise, especially to the ringing of church bells” (Moore 1891, 41).In ancient Ireland and Scotland distances were often roughly calculated by thedistance sound travels. In the Senchus Mór, “magh-spaces” appear in the lawgoverning going to someone’s aid in distress. A maghspace was as far as thesound of a bell (an ecclesiastical handbell) or the crow of a rooster could beheard. The magh-space was also the feeding range for bees (North 1881, 56).Rocking stones, boulders naturally perched on others but able to move, wererevered as special. They were not seen as natural features, but rather ones thathad been placed there by gods, giants, heroes, or saints. They had a connectionwith the winds, as many of them were so finely balanced that they moved in thewind. In his poem Argonautica, Apollonius Rhodius (ca. 100 CE) wrote thatHercules erected a stone over the grave of one of the sons of Boreas, the northwind. It moved in the slightest breeze, seeming to hover above the rock below.Rocking stones that generated sounds were held in awe. The Roulter Rocks onStanton Moor in Derbyshire were kept in almost constant motion, grinding againstthe basal stone on which they perched, making an eerie noise. One of theseDerbyshire rocking stones was called the Minstrel of the Peak. Its sound,attributed to otherworldly spirits, could be heard from many miles away. Mostrocking stones of the British Isles were destroyed by religious fanatics, whoconsidered them to be objects of superstition. Those that survived religiousconflict were knocked off their perches by deliberate vandalism once the stoneshad been made famous by antiquaries and became the focus of tourism.INCANTATIONimage [../images/00002.jpeg]Spoken and Sung CharmsPriests of the Celtic Church in Ireland, Great Britain, and Brittany composedprotective charms that could either be chanted or sung. They circulated widelyfor many centuries, and some of them are still in use. The Lorica of St. Gildaswas composed against the devastating Yellow Plague in 547 CE, and Sen Dé by St.Colman mac Ui Cluasaig was against the plague of 697 CE. These charms,originally composed to magically ward off specific plagues, took on a moregeneral protective character (Baring-Gould and Fisher 1907–1913, III, 129). Alegend of the Breton saint Hoernbiu tells how his hen was stolen by a fox, so heprayed, and the fox brought it back unharmed. The prayer was written down andbecame a general charm against foxes in poultry yards (Baring-Gould and Fisher1907–1913, III, 279).Enchantment is literally weaving a magic spell by singing a song. Most religionshave hymns and chants that appear during rites and ceremonies. There arenumerous extant Pagan hymns from southern European antiquity, including thoseattributed to the musician-prophet Orpheus. In the north, too, are a few noticesof religious and magical incantations and songs from ancient times. TheIcelandic word for invocational magic, galdur, is associated with the verb gala,“to chant, sing, or call.” It is equivalent to the English word “enchantment,”which refers to a magical effect brought about by chanting or singing spells.The Icelandic Þorfinns Saga Karlsefnis tells how a female magician performedgaldur with a beautiful voice. Galdur appears to have usually been performedalone, but it is possible that a group of people may have performed some of theincantations. The technical terms for Icelandic magical staves and sigils aregaldrastáfur (staves) and galdramyndir (sigils), which indicate that incantationwas part of making them. Éiríks Saga Rauða tells of an instance of incantationfrom the time in Greenland after the Christian religion became dominant. A völva(seeress) conducted a ceremony that reached the point where a hymn orincantation called a varðlokkur needed to be sung to continue. None there knewit, except a young woman on a visit from Iceland. She was a Christian but hadlearned it from a woman who looked after her when she was a child. She did notwant to sing it but eventually was talked into singing the varðlokkur, whichenabled the ceremony to be completed.Incantations were associated with later European witchcraft, too. In his TheMasque of Queens, performed at Candlemas in 1609 by the queen of Great Britainand her ladies, Ben Jonson notes that the witches in the play have “these shoutsand clamors, as also the voice har, har, are very peculiar with them.” Forexample, the seventh charm of Jonson’s theatrical witches:7 Charm, “Black go in, and blacker come out;At thy going down, we give thee a shout.Hoo!At thy rising again, thou shalt have two,And if thou dost what we would have thee do,Thou shalt have three, though shalt have four,Thou shalt have ten, though shalt have a scoreHoo! Har! Har! Hoo!”(JONSON 1816, VOL 7, 118).Jonson’s notes to the masque detail numerous sources for his characterizations,including ancient and contemporary literature and what would now be calledfolklore. There are similar calls in the traditional German Fastnacht carnivalprocessions, many of which can be dated back to medieval times. Much lateraccounts of witchcraft also record incantations and calls. James Wentworth Dayrecords an account by Alfred Herbert Martin, a farm laborer who worked on theMersea Island in Essex for more than forty years in the early twentieth century.Martin claimed to have seen Mrs. Smith, known by the witch name of Old MotherRedcap, crossing the water to the island on a hurdle as if it were a boat.Martin claimed that as she peeled potatoes in her kitchen, Old Mother Redcapwould chant the invocation “Holly, holly, brolly brolly, Redcap! Bonny, bonny”(Day 1973, 39).MAGICAL INFLUENCESIn ancient Irish tradition, there were three different kinds of music:golltraidheacht, a festive and martial measure; geanttraidheacht, the sorrowfulmeasure; and suanttraidheacht, a soothing measure. The latter had such powerthat it sent its hearers to sleep for a day or two (North 1881, 40). Accordingto Lady Jane Wilde (1887), there was a beautiful description in one of theancient manuscripts showing the wonderful power of Irish music over thesensitive humans: “Wounded men were soothed when they heard it, and slept; andwomen in travail forgot their pains” (Wilde 1887, I, 53). Music can bring joyand lift the spirits, a form of magic if ever there was one. The Old EnglishRune Poem has the following verse for the rune Peorð:Byð symble plega and hlehter wlancumÞar wiggan sittaþ on beorsele bliþe ætsomne.“A lively tune means laughter and playWhere brave men sit in the mead hallAle-drinking warriors blithe together.”The shape of this rune image [../images/00073.jpeg] clearly signifies a lyre orharp. A lively tune, conserved into the twenty-first century by the modern Irishword port, which means a tune, more particularly among traditional musicians, ajig, or port béil, a lilt. In an Irish idiom, the port is seen as life, as inthe saying “tá mo phort seinnte” (“I am done for”): the tune of life isfinished. It seems to have had a magical use. A 1670 French grimoire, MagicSecrets and Counter-Charms, written by Guidon, “practitioner of occult healing,”deals mainly with shepherds’ and horsemen’s magic. It refers specifically to thejig in a charm ritual that is intended to give protection against all firearms,bewitching the star that guides the firearm by means of a jig. The jig isfollowed up by a command in the name of the Father, and the Son, and Satanatis,finished with the sign of the cross (Guidon 2011 [1670], 49). In some way thejig binds the power of the star that rules the specific day, therebydisempowering the gun.Incantations unintelligible to those not in the know are associated withparticular trades. They are, of course, part of the same tradition as theincantations magicians or witches use in their rites and ceremonies and in thepreparation of active substances. Sea shanties are well known nautical worksongs. But there are other, more magical, traditional songs and incantationsemployed by fishermen. One of the author’s ancestors, Shepherd Pennick(1820–1885), spent his working life as a master mariner sailing out ofBrightlingsea, Essex, England, fishing for oysters. Oyster-dredgers were knownfor their special incantations, unintelligible to outsiders, uttered during theprocess of trawling the seabed for the shellfish. It was a widespread traditionon both sides of the Atlantic, noted by the American esoteric writer Astra Cieloin 1918: “During oyster dredging, fishermen often keep up a monotonous chant tocharm the oysters into their net” (Cielo 1918, 144).Other fishermen catching different things also chanted specific words and songsthat were used only at sea. In Shetland these were called lucky words (Warrack1988 [1911], 341). There is a fishing tradition in the Appalachian Mountains inthe United States stating that fish bite best at night, and if you play a fiddleor guitar, the fish love music so much that they cannot remain in the water butwill come to the surface where they can be caught. This may well have been anancient belief in Europe. Generic boat songs are well known from the Scottishtradition, the jurram being a “slow and melancholy boat song” and the eeran anoar song sung during rowing (Warrack 1988 [1911], 155, 297).There are fascinating old stories of how sounds and music affect animals. Theprophet Orpheus is depicted in ancient Greek and Roman images charming theanimals with his lyre playing. H. C. Agrippa stated that the sound of a drummade of the skin of the rotchet fish (red gurnard, Trigla cuculus) would driveaway all creeping things, as far as it can be heard (Agrippa 1993 [1531], I,XXI). The legend of the Pied Piper of Hamelin gives his music the power to charmboth rats and children. A curious note in Fenland Notes and Queries (vol. IV[1899], 242) claimed that “when the Earl of Bedford determined to drain the landhe adopted the strange device of training six of the largest deer and keepingthem shut up some time he tamed them by the constant sounding of drums harps andother instruments then harnessed them like a set of coach horses and presentedthem to the King Charles I.”In the Western Isles of Scotland, when driving the cattle to pasture in themorning, the herdsman or herdswoman sang a song with a pleasant melody. It wassung in slow, measured cadences, and the measured walk of the older cattle wasin time to the singing. Going to bring the cattle home in the evening, onapproaching the herd, the herder sang fàilte a’ chruidh, the song of welcome tothe cattle, and they responded by making sounds (Carmichael 1997, n. 364). Theuse by horsemen of particular unusual sounds in the language for controllinghorses was noted by the English folklorist Gertrude Jekyll in 1904. In her OldWest Surrey, she noted that they were not pronounced words, but uttered with arumbling, hollow resonance, perhaps produced from the stomach by an open throat(Jekyll 1904, 166).OTHERWORLDLY MUSICFrom the ninth century at the latest, labyrinths made of turf or stones wereused in the rites of spring, for ceremonies for the dead and weather magic.Folklore of certain labyrinths in the British Isles identifies them as dwellingplaces of fairies. The turf labyrinth at Asenby in Yorkshire, England, was in ahollow atop a hillock called the Fairies Hill, where those who ran the mazewould kneel when they reached the center “to hear the fairies singing” (Allcroft1908, 602). Fairy music and song heard at such places is a theme in Celtic folktales, and certain tunes played today are said to have a supernatural origin. Amotif in story telling is of the musician who considers himself not good enoughto be taken seriously, who encounters the Otherworld, then returns empowered asa fine musician admired by all. In Ireland and Gaelic Scotland there is atradition of ceol-sidhe, the “fairy music” gifted to musicians by otherworldlybeings. Flannery, the legendary bagpiper of Oranmore in Galway, Ireland, becamea virtuoso when he was taught piping below ground by a subterranean being.Similarly, on the island of Skye in the Scottish Hebrides, a tale is told ofIain Òg MacCrimmon, who was depressed because he was not considered a goodenough piper to compete in a contest called by the clan chief, MacLeod ofDunvegan Castle. Iain Òg MacCrimmon went into a cave at Harlosh Point to playthe pipes alone, and there a fairy woman appeared to him, produced a silverchanter for his pipes, and taught him how to play it. “Your handsome looks andsweet music have brought you a fairy sweetheart. I bequeath you this silverchanter: At the touch of your fingers, it will always bring forth the sweetestmusic.” This was the famous sionnsairairgid na mna sithe, “the silver chanter ofthe fairy woman.” Iain Òg MacCrimmon went to Dunvegan Castle, entered the pipingcontest, and was judged to be the best of all. The enchanted chanter offairyland gave him abilities denied to others (Carmichael 1911, 86). The cave isknown today as the Piper’s Cave.According to the ancient Celtic tradition, he was appointed as the hereditarypiper to the MacLeods, and for many generations MacCrimmon’s descendants wererenowned pipers and composers of new pipe music. At Borreraig Farm, across LochFollart, opposite Dunvegan Castle, Iain Òg MacCrimmon founded a piping school towhich advanced students came from all over Scotland and Ireland to perfect theart of piping. The highest standards of ceol mor or piobaireachd, thecharacteristic music of the Scots highland bagpipe, were attained at Borreraig,for the course to mastery of the pipes took seven years. The school existed fromaround 1600 to 1770. Another otherworldly musical piece connected with DunveganCastle is “The Dunvegan Lullaby” or “The Dunvegan Cradle Spell,” reputedly sungby a fairy woman who comforted an unhappy baby when its nurse was away for awhile. The nurse listened and recalled it.St. Patrick is said to have heard the ceol sidhe played on the timpán and statedthat it would equal the very music of heaven if it were not for “a twang of thefairy spell that infests it” (Wentz 1911, 199–200). This account mentions theplaying of the timpán at Samhain (Lá Samhna, November 1) by “The Wondrous ElfinMan,” when the fairy music would make all that heard it fall to sleep (Wentz1911, 200). Turlough O’Carolan, the celebrated seventeenth-century blind Irishharper, was said to have slept out one night in a fairy rath (fairy hill orfort) and received the gift of ceol-sidhe in his dreams. When he awoke, heremembered the music and played it. Lady Wilde recounts the story of an Irishpiper, who, walking through the hills one evening, heard a fairy piper play anexquisite tune called “Móraleana.” The fairy told him that he could only play“Móraleana” three times in his life before an audience. If he played it a fourthtime, a curse would befall him. He played it only three times and never againuntil he found himself in the final round of a piping competition. He knew hewould win if he played “Móraleana,” so he played it and won the prize as bestpiper. At the moment the garland of Bardic mastery was placed upon his head, hecollapsed and died upon the stage. One must not use a fairy gift for worldlygain. There is a story told today among traditional musicians in Ireland andBritain that if the tune “King of the Fairies” is played through three times ina row, the king of the fairies will appear. If the musician has played well, heor she will be rewarded; but if the tune was played badly, some unspecifiedotherworldly punishment will befall the player. “King of the Fairies” is in the“eldritch key” of E minor.In his Carmina Gadelica (1900) Alexander Carmichael noted an òran sidh (fairysong) that a man heard when searching for sheep at Creaga Gorma, Hèathabhal, onthe isle of Barra in the Western Isles of Scotland. A fairy woman was grinding aquern (hand mill) and singing the song. Carmichael published this song and fourothers, recalled by girls and women from Iochdar, Sandray, and Mingulay. Threewere heard at fairy mounds and another was part of a traditional story aboutRoderick MacDonald, a man who had built his house on a fairy site where a fairywoman sang as she ground her quern, so he was forced to move elsewhere(Carmichael 1997, 478–80, 663). The music of the Manx song called “Bollan Bane”(The White Herb), “a plant known to the Fairy Doctors, and of great healingvirtues,” was noted around 1840 one evening on the mountains by a person whoheard it being sung by the fairies (Moore 1891, 41). In her introduction to thesection on the Isle of Man in The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries (1911), SophiaMorrison recounted a twentieth-century tradition of otherworldly music. WilliamCain, a fiddler from Glen Helen (formerly called Rhenass), was known as “Willythe Fairy” for his knowledge of fairy music. He sang and played airs he said hehad heard the fairies playing (Morrison 1911, 118). Once he saw a great glasshouse like a palace, all lit up, in a glen beneath the mountains at Brook’sPark, where the fairies were playing. He stopped and listened to a tune until hegot it, then went home to practice it on the fiddle. William Cain later playedthat fairy tune at Manx entertainment staged in Peel by Sophia Morrison (Wentz1911, 131).ANCESTRAL MUSICBardism in the past tended to be hereditary, and at certain times hereditaryscalds and bards were attached to royal and noble families. There was an Irishtradition that the bardic families possessed secrets, which they transmittedfrom generation to generation. In 1887 Lady Jane Wilde wrote of the “herb ofwhich a drink was made, called The Bardic Potion, for the Bards alone had thesecret of the herb, and of the proper mode of treatment by which its mysticpower could be revealed. This potion they gave their infant children at theirbirth, for it had the singular property of endowing the recipient with a fairysweetness of voice of the most rapturous and thrilling charm. And instances arerecorded of men amongst the Celtic Bards, who, having drunk of this potion inearly life, were ever after endowed with the sweet voice, like fairy music, thatswayed the hearts of the hearers as they chose to love or war, joy or sadness,as if by magic influence, or lulled them into the sweet calm of sleep” (Wilde1887, II, 67).In Scotland there were hereditary pipers retained by the chief of the clan, ofwhich the Borreraig School MacCrimmons are the most famous. Others include theMacArthurs, pipers to MacDonald of Sleat; the Rankins, pipers to the MacLeans ofColl, Duart, and Mull; and the MacGregors, pipers to Campbell of Glenlyon.Hereditary bards and pipers in ancient Scotland had a piece of land given tothem by the clan chief to farm or graze animals upon, and various payments forattending official events and celebrations. Instruments are handed down in thefamily, and generations of descendants may be playing the same instrument thattheir ancestors played. As an old Scots saying tells us, “shared gold goes notfar, but a shared song lasts a long time.”"},{"pageContent":"15Northern Instruments THE KANTELE, LYRE, AND ALLIED INSTRUMENTSIn the Finnish Kalevala epic, the shaman-craftsman Väinämöinen had a magicalgenesis. He crafted the first kantele harp out of the skull of an enormous pikefish and strung it with strings spun from a woman’s hair. The originalinstrument was lost at sea, so Väinämöinen fashioned a new one from the wood ofthe birch tree. Traditional kanteles are made from a hollowed-out block of woodand have five horsehair strings, but metal strings superseded horsehair whenwire began to be manufactured industrially. Later instruments have more thanfive strings, and a classically oriented concert kantele with key-alteringlevers like the classical concert harp was devised by Paul Salminen in the1920s.image [../images/00074.jpeg]Fig. 15.1. Finnish kantele, twentieth century.The related northern lyre was a bardic instrument in ancient times. Thisinstrument consisted of a flat soundbox connected to two side pieces joined atthe top by a yoke that supported the strings. At the lower end of the soundboxwas a tailpiece that anchored the strings, which passed over a bridge resting onthe soundboard. At Paule, Saint-Symphorien, in the Côtes-du-Nord region ofFrance there is a Celtic stone figure dating from the second century BCE thatdepicts a musician holding a lyre and wearing a torc round his neck (Dannheimerand Gebhard 1993, 278). In Ireland there are depictions of lyres on Celticcrosses. Remains of lyres from the sixth and seventh centuries have been foundin Anglo-Saxon royal burials in England, as at Sutton Hoo and Prittlewell.Gaelic harps in Ireland and Scotland were strung with bronze or brass wire fromearly times, but it is likely that comparable instruments in Britain andcontinental Europe were strung with hair or gut.There are two ways of playing the northern lyre and kantele. One is to play themlike a plucked psaltery, with the left hand supporting the body and the righthand picking individual strings. Another way uses a plectrum held in the righthand. This strikes the strings, strumming across all of them. The left hand isheld behind the instrument and uses the fingertips to stop strings that theplayer does not want to sound. In this way different chords can be played. Themodern autoharp is based upon this principle. Some versions had a fingerboardbetween the two supporting arms. This permitted the musician to stop the stringswith his or her fingers, as on a fretless instrument such as the violin. Thebowed northern lyre with a fingerboard appeared around the eleventh century inWales as the crwth, and England where it was called a crowd. In Ireland atwelfth-century depiction of this instrument is carved in stone at St. Finan’schurch at Lough Currane, County Kerry. In Scotland in the twelfth and thirteenthcenturies the word cruit (otherwise crott) meant not a northern lyre but theGaelic harp, a triangular frame harp. From the fourteenth century, the Gaelicharp was called clàrsach in Gaelic and cláirseach in Irish.A tradition of making one’s own instruments from available materials existed incountry districts in eastern England well into the twentieth century. DuringWorld War I, soldiers improvised instruments from salvaged materials. In theregion around Cambridge, a local instrument, a kind of plucked psaltery calledthe Anglia harp, related to the Finnish kantele, was made and played. Locally, ahammered dulcimer with single instead of multiple courses of strings was calleda harp, even though it had bridges unlike an Anglia harp (Wortley 1938–1975,20). Most Anglia harps are more basic, without bridges and usually with fifteenstrings made from piano wire. The Midwinterhoorns of Twente province in theNetherlands are not manufactured, and all are different, not being tuned to aparticular pitch. As with many traditional musicians up to the middle of thetwentieth century, it is likely that instruments were tuned relative to theplayer’s singing voice, rather than standard pitch. Medieval instructions (ca.1123) exist for casting tuned bells (cymbal), made in sets of eight or nine.They were cast from wax that was divided by weight according to proportions thatwould produce a diatonic musical scale. They were tuned relative to one anotherby weight, and not tuned from a determinate concert pitch (Theophilus 1979,176–79).DRONESTraditional instruments originating at various historical times have been usedto produce a hypnotic droning sound, such as buzzers, bagpipes, bumbass, Jew’sharp, Scheitholt, Hommel, mountain dulcimer, and hurdygurdy (Old Nick’s birlingbox). Ritual music predominantly employed the drone as a major element. TheScots word droner can mean a player of the bagpipes, as well as a bumblebee(Warrack 1988 [1911], 147); the same sort of “buzzing-bee” name is given to theDutch and German drone-based fretted stringed instruments called Hommel andHummel, respectively. The single-stringed musical instrument devised byPythagoras, the Monochord, is an image of the cosmos, as Robert Fludd noted in1617. This instrument, used from Pythagoras onward, became, with the addition ofstrings, the German Scheitholt and Hummel; in France the épinette des Vosges andépinette du Nord; in the Netherlands, the Hommel; in Friesland, NoardischeBalke, and in Norway, the langeleik. The oldest known langeleik comes fromVardalsåsen near Gjøvik in the Oppland district. It bears the date 1524. Frommainland Europe, versions of these instruments were taken to the United States.There in the Appalachians it was standardized as the mountain dulcimer. Thisdiatonically fretted instrument is now played widely in European folk music,including by the present author. Another related drone instrument is the stringdrum, sometimes called a timbrel.It was also referred to as the chorus and has the French names tambourin ácordes and tambourin Béarnais (Munrow 1976, 33–34). It is a rhythmic droneinstrument with tensioned strings along a rhomboidal sound box. The strings arebeaten with a stick, and as an accompaniment to a three-hole pipe, it is tunedto the keynote of the pipe and its fifth. The Scots verb to drum means to repeatsomething monotonously, to drone (Warrack 1988 [1911], 148).image [../images/00075.jpeg]Fig. 15.2. String drum timbrel made by Nigel Pennick, 2009.THE BUZZERThe buzzer is a simple drone instrument consisting of a piece of hard materialattached to a string and whirled around to make the sound. It is frequentlycalled by the anthropologists’ name “bullroarer,” though this name was neveremployed anywhere by its actual users. It is an archaic instrument. One found in1960 at Kongemosen in Sjælland, Denmark, was dated at around 6000 BCE. It is apiece of bone shaped as a pointed oval, with a hole bored through one end,through which a piece of string could be threaded. Swinging it in the airproduced a humming sound. This instrument is simple to make, and disposable. TheDanish word for it is brummer; in English the names were mainly bummer, hummer,humming buzzer, or buzzer. Various designs were collected in England in thenineteenth century and, according to the custom of the time, classified bycounty. Haddon wrote in 1908 that the ends were usually square, but the stringend could be rounded; the sides could be serrated or simply notched along bothsurfaces of each side (Haddon 1908, 278).image [../images/00076.jpeg]Fig. 15.3. Buzzers from England. The Library of the European TraditionIn the 1850s the young weavers of Belfast liked playing what they called theboomer or bummer, described as “an oblong piece of wood, pierced with two holes,and serrated all round” (Haddon 1908, 284–85). The Scottish bummer or bum-spealwas described in 1911 as “a thin piece of serrated wood attached to a string,”swung to give a booming sound. In Scotland the tambourine was called a bummingduff. The Scots word bum means “to drone, as in a bum note, a note misplayed ina tune” (Warrack 1988 [1911], 62). Haddon’s informant in northeastern Irelandstated that once when, as a boy, he was playing with a boomer an old countrywoman said it was a “sacred” thing (Haddon 1908, 283–84). In the Schwarzwald ofsouth Germany, the instrument was called Schlägel or Brummer. Sometimes, one wasattached to the end of a whip and whirled round at ceremonial events; this iscalled a Schwirrholz (Seidel 1896, 67).In Scotland the instrument is also known by a name that associates it withthunder; generally as a thunder-spell, and in Aberdeen as a thunderbolt (Haddon1908, 280–81). Alice Gomme in her Traditional Games of England, Scotland, andIreland gives this definition:Thun’er-Spell. A thin lath of wood, about six inches long and three or fourinches broad, is taken and rounded at one end. A hole is bored in that end, andin the hole is tied a piece of cord between two and three yards long. . . . Itwas believed that the use of this instrument during a thunderstorm saved onefrom being struck with “the thun’er-bolt.” (Gomme 1894 and 1898, II 291)The Scots dictionary compiler Alexander Warrack describes the thunder spealbeing “whirled round the head to mimic thunder” (Warrack 1988 [1911], 612).Gomme noted that the more rapidly the instrument is swung the louder is thenoise. Haddon noted that when swinging more rapidly, the high note of a buzzerpasses into a low harmonic. In Galicia this tuning effect was called bzik(Haddon 1908, 285).Related to the buzzer is the sneerag, made of one of the larger bones of a pig’sfoot connected to two worsted strings, used to produce a snoring sound (Warrack1988 [1911], 540). A wooden version is the “buzz,” made from a small, flat,rectangular piece of wood through which two holes are pierced. A long,continuous piece of string is passed through the holes and tied in a loop. Theloops are held in the two hands, and the wood is swung around to twist thestring. Then the hands are strongly and steadily drawn apart, causing the woodto spin rapidly, producing a buzzing sound. The momentum makes the string twistitself up again, and it can then be pulled, reversing the spinning “buzz”(Haddon 1908, 284–85).ROTATORY RATTLES, WALDTEUFEL, JACKDAW, AND ROMMELPOTAnother type of traditional noisemaker consists of a handle with a circularratchet at the top, onto which is pivoted a framework holding flexible woodenslats that overlap the ratchet. When the instrument is whirled around, the slatsinteract with the ratchet to make a rattling sound. This is the Rärre used byDevil guisers in the Swabian-Alemannic Fastnacht tradition of south Germany.Rattles of this sort were used as a warning of poison gas attacks in World WarI. In his exposition of the buzzer, Haddon describes “a child’s toy well knownin Germany as the Waldteufel ” (Woodland Devil). He described it as a smallcardboard cylinder, open at one end and closed at the other like a drum. To themiddle of the drum a horsehair or fiber was fastened, and the other end was tiedto a piece of wood. The wood at this spot is coated with resin to produce agrating sound that was transmitted along the fiber, the cylinder acting as aresonator (Haddon 1908, 284). A related English instrument was the jackdaw,which was made of about an inch of the top part of the neck of a wine bottle.Over this was stretched a bit of parchment, which was tightly tied under theprojecting rim of it. A long horsehair, with a knot at the end, was then putthrough the parchment, the knot being inside the neck. By wetting the forefingerand thumb and drawing the horsehair between them, the player could producesounds by moving the hand rapidly or slowly or in jerks.A related friction drum played in the Low Countries is known by its Dutch name,rommelpot (rumble pot), from the Dutch verb rommelen, meaning “to produce a low,dull noise, to rumble.” In Germany it is called Brummtopf (Munrow 1976, 34). Thesound of the rommelpot is produced by the vibration of a membrane stretchedtightly across the neck of an earthenware pot, jug, or soup bowl. Traditionally,the membrane is made from the bladder of a pig or cow, and a wooden stick isinserted through the middle. Rubbing the stick with moistened fingers producesthe sound, and variations in pressure control the pitch. The sound wasconsidered unearthly or diabolical, especially when the pot contained dried peasor was half-filled with water. In Flanders the rommelpot is an instrument playedtraditionally on various festive days (De Hen 1972, 105–10). In Brabant there isa traditional dance called “Rommelpot,” which of course should be accompanied bythe instrument. Like the bodhrán (see below), after almost falling into disusethe rommelpot was given a new lease on life through the efforts of Paul Collaerand Felix van Eekhoute. There is an unbroken tradition of playing it in theBelgian village of Kessenich.THE FRAME DRUMThe frame drum is well known as the sacred instrument of the shaman. It has amystique because it enables the shaman to enter altered states of consciousnessand practice soul-flight (Old Norse hamfarir). It was rare in Europe outsideareas where shamanism was practiced.In nineteenth-century Cornwall a sea witch called Kate “the Gull” Turnerpossessed a frame drum or “tambourine” with which she performed divinations.Orientation of the drum according to the cardinal directions appears to havebeen part of the ritual. In Britain and Ireland the frame drum was traditionallyseen as a ritual instrument and played only during the rites and ceremonies onMay Day and Hallowe’en, and by the Wren Boys at Midwinter. In the west ofBritain and Ireland, the frame drum appears to have been identical with anagricultural implement called the wecht, wight, or dallan, used for winnowing,separating the chaff from the grain (Evans 1957, 211). Structurally, theimplement is like a sieve, but instead of having interwoven cords to screen outlarge from small objects, it has a base made from an animal skin, so it caneasily double as a drum. An English frame drum in a rare photograph taken ofJack-in-the-Green at a traditional May Day performance in Oxford in 1886 is muchlarger than a wecht or a bodhrán.image [../images/00077.jpeg]Fig. 15.4. Sámi shamans’ drums, Finland, from Johannes Schefferus’s Lapponia(1673). The Library of the European TraditionAn indication of the tradition of calling upon things to grow is in the Scotsexpression “deaf grain,” meaning grain that has lost the power to germinate(Warrack 1988 [1911], 127). The name of the Irish frame drum, bodhrán, isderived from the Old Irish word bodhar, meaning “deaf” or “haunted” (James 1997,78). Materials matter both acoustically and magically. For the bodhrán, makersprefer to use goatskin or deerskin, giving a good sound, but calf, sheep,donkey, and greyhound skins were also used to stretch across the frame (James1997, 80). Goatskin is considered to produce the authentic bodhrán sound (Driver1994, 4). H. C. Agrippa commented that a drum made from wolf ’s skin causes adrum made of lambskin not to sound (Agrippa 1993 [1531], I, XXI). With both theshaman’s drum and the bodhrán, the skin is stretched across the frame with itsoutside facing outward; that is, the surface that is played. The bodhrán frameis made of ash, bent green and lapped at the joint (McCrickard 1994, 20). It hascrossbars at the back made of wood or metal, which stabilizes the frame andprovides a handhold. Some shamans’ frame drums also have crossbars, while othershave a metal ring suspended by thongs, or a rod carved into a humanoid form.In former times the bodhrán was associated with the west of Ireland, parts ofthe counties of Clare, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, and Tipperary (McCrickard 1994,21). At one time it was played only during ritual performances by the Wren Boyson St. Stephen’s Day (December 26), in a rite that involved hunting and killinga wren and parading it from house to house. In the 1960s it was played notablyby Seán Ó Riada (1931–1971) and adopted by other Irish traditional musicians asa viable instrument for music at all times. In 1986 the Irish playwright J. B.Keane wrote a play titled The Bodhrán Makers. In the early twenty-first century,the Irish bodhrán is widespread among traditional and folk musicians in Ireland,Great Britain, and the United States.THE CLAPPERSIt was formerly customary to make percussive sounds at Eastertime. There is aGerman tradition of hitting walls with hammers in springtime(Sonnenvogelklopfen). In Wales children used clappers to make a noise to alerthouseholders to give them eggs for Easter (clepio wyau’r pasg). There are twoknown forms of egg clappers from Wales. The simpler clapper is a woodeninstrument shaped like a cooking spatula to which two other flat pieces of woodare tied tightly by strings threaded through two holes. When the handle isshaken, the tied-on pieces clap against the flattened end. A larger kind ofclapper is a wooden board with a hole at the center through which a handleprotrudes. A double-headed wooden hammer is hinged into the top of the handle,and rapid movement makes the hammer swing back and forth, hitting the board(Owen 1987, 86). There is an English saying, “to go like the clappers,” derivedfrom the speed with which the clappers can be played. Related in structure isthe Lithuanian skrabalai. The instrument consists of a trapezoidal wooden troughhollowed out from a block of oak or ash, with wooden or metal small clappershung inside. The skrabalai is shaken so that a clapper knocks against the sideof the trough, making a hollow clapper sound. It can also be played as a drumusing sticks.BONESBones make good percussion instruments. A pair of cow ribs rattled together wasa traditional instrument everywhere there were cattle. Rib bones were calledknicky-knackers in seventeenth-century Britain, where, not surprisingly, theywere associated with butcher-boy rituals and pastimes. It was traditional forbutcher boys to serenade newlywed couples with marrowbones and meat cleavers.“Formerly, the band would consist of four cleavers, each of a different tone,or, if complete, of eight, and by beating their marrowbones skilfully againstthese, they obtained a sort of music somewhat after the fashion of indifferentbell ringing. When well performed, however, and heard from a proper distance, itwas not altogether unpleasant. A largesse of half-a-crown or a crown wasgenerally expected for this delicate attention. The butchers of Clare market hadthe reputation of being the best performers” (Larwood and Hotten 1908, 358). Anillustration of this from Chambers’s Book of Days (1869) is shown in figure15.5.image [../images/00078.jpeg]Fig. 15.5. The Butchers’ Serenade, 1869. The Library of the European TraditionThe bones, smaller than full cow ribs, are a folk instrument that in thenineteenth century became associated with blackface minstrels. But they werenever exclusively a minstrel instrument, for they are played in performances andpub sessions of traditional music of Britain and Ireland. Two or more bones areheld loosely in one or both hands, which then are shaken in rhythm to producepercussive sounds. Sometimes they are played by step dancers in accompaniment totheir dance steps. Bones players consider the best material to be whales’ bones,very hard yet easily worked like wood (Driver 1994, 25).BELLSBells are closely connected with religious rites and ceremonies, as well asbeing an adjunct to dance and as a warning in transport. They signify andamplify the presence of desirable spiritual powers, while suppressing unwantedintrusions. Bells transmit the virtue of the metal of which they are made. Inancient Greece resonant metal instruments were called “the bronze” (chalkos). Ascholiast of Theocritus remarked that the chalkos was sounded at eclipses of themoon “because it has power to purify and to drive off pollutions.” Sounding thebronze in ancient Rome was instrumental in rituals. Ovid noted that the annualvisits of the spirits of the departed to their former homes were brought to anend by sounding a bronze plate and ordering them to leave.The particular resonance of a bell depends upon the material it is made of, itsdimensions, and its shape. Its sound is a manifestation of these qualities.Early bells were made by bending sheet metal to shape and riveting the join, andcowbells are made in this way now. This kind of bell is still hung around thenecks of herd animals to ward off evil. The other kind of ancient bell is thespherical bell used from early medieval times on horse harness. Bells like theseare similar to the ceremonial bells worn by some shamans, guisers, and Morrisdancers. They ring as the performer walks, runs, or dances. Town criers inEngland ring a handbell to attract people before making their officialannouncements. From the early medieval times, large church bells were cast infoundries. It is not known whether bells were introduced into northern Europe bythe Romans or by Christian missionaries, but the clergy of the Celtic Churchcertainly recognized the sanctity of bells. Bells that had belonged to reveredpriests were preserved in ornate reliquaries. They were no longer capable ofbeing sounded, but considered magically powerful objects in their own right. Thebell of the ninth-century Irish priest, St. Cuilleann, is a typical relic usedfor ritual purposes. For many years it was kept in a hollow tree at Kilcuilawnat Glenkeen, County Tipperary. In the eighteenth century it was taken out sothat oaths could be sworn upon it. Bells like this were in the keeping ofdewars, hereditary relic keepers, and handed down through the generations infamilies. For example, on the island of Inishkeel, County Donegal, the O’Breslanfamily kept the Bell of St. Conall. In the Christian tradition, bells werebaptized and given names.BELLS IN HORSEMANRYThe Scots ballad “Sir John Gordon,” collected by John Ord in his Bothy Songs andBallads, tells how Sir John encountered the Queen of Faerie and was taken awayto the Otherworld where he had to serve her. The horse ridden by the Queen ofFairyland was bedecked with a particular number of bells:Her gown was o’ the green, green silk,Her mantle o’ velvet fine,And from the mane of her milk-white steedSilver bells hung fifty and nine.(ORD 1995, 423)In England it was a medieval custom to give a golden bell to the winner of ahorse race. An annual race with this prize was run on St. George’s Day (April23) at Chester. Racing for a bell led to the expression for being the winner,“bearing off the bell” (Larwood and Hotten 1908, 174–75). The Carter’s Health,noted in Nuthurst, Sussex, England, 1812–13, refers to the custom of “the wildstud,” and the best mare.Of all the horses in the Merry Green Wood’Twas the bob-tail mare car’ d [carried] the bells away.*4 [part0023.html#fr4](CLARK 1930, 797)In the British Isles, packhorse gangs were a common form of transport before theconstruction of turnpike roads, canals, and railways. A number of horses (atrain) proceeded in single file along unpaved track-ways or across open moorlandalong customary routes. Each horse in the train was fitted with packs orpanniers. The train was led by a lead horse that was fitted with bells. In 1790Thomas Bewick noted that the packhorses,in their journeys over the trackless moors . . . strictly adhere to the line oforder and regularity custom has taught them to observe; the leading Horse, whichis always chosen for his sagacity and steadiness, being furnished with bells,gives notice to the rest, which follow the sound, and generally without muchdeviation, though sometimes at a considerable distance. (Bewick 1790, 14–15)The bells on the lead horse also gave warning to other travelers that apackhorse train was coming, so they could take avoiding action. According to themythos of the Scottish Horsemens’ Society, taught to new members at the time ofinitiation, the names of the first mare and stallion were Bell and Star. Therewas a bell on her brow and a star on his brow (Rennie 2009, 111). This, ofcourse, is symbolic. The bell and the star are both symbols of guidance. Thelead horse’s bell guided the packhorse train, while the leading star whoseposition in the sky never changes allowed navigation at sea and on land.THE NORTHERN HORNS: LUR, NEVERLUR, BARKLUR, AND MIDWINTERHOORNSurviving ancient horns from Ireland, circa 500 BCE, were made of bronze. Somewere up to eight feet long, made from smaller pieces riveted together. Thelargest ones were side blown. A similar Scandinavian horn was the lur (cf. OldNorse luðr, a “hollow log”). The earliest known instruments came from the BronzeAge and were actually made of bronze. There were once two ceremonial hornsbearing figures and runes, fashioned out of sheet gold and dating from the earlyfifth century CE, which were found at Gallehus, north of Møgeltønder in Jutland,Denmark, in 1639 and in 1734. As they were not intact when found, and have sincebeen destroyed, it is not certain that they were musical instruments, but thebanded construction resembles known musical horns made in Scandinavia and theNetherlands from various species of wood.The most well-known Bronze Age lurs are the Brudevælte lurs, discovered by OlePedersen in 1797 in a bog near Lynge in North Zealand, Denmark. They aredifferent from the Viking Age battle horns found in Germany, Denmark, andNorway, which were straight, end-blown wooden instruments about a yard long,bound with willow withies. Bronze lurs have an S-shaped curve reminiscent ofaurochs’ horns. Battle horns known from sagas had the same function as bugles inlater military use. A lur was buried in the Oseberg ship burial of a Norwegiannoblewoman dated 834 CE. It was a conical horn enclosed in a richly decoratedoak box, one of the earliest musical instrument cases known. Later medievalhorns made of pine or fir bound with birch bark (neverlur) were used by peasantsin Scandinavia. The barklur or barkhorn (Finnish touhitorvi) was made fromspirally wound strips of alder, ash, spruce, or willow.Similar in construction to the ancient horns described above, the Midwinterhoornis an instrument used in ceremonial tradition in the Dutch provinces ofOverijssel and Twente and the Achterhoek district of Gelderland province. As itsname suggests, it is played outdoors around the winter solstice between thebeginning of Advent (December 6) and Driekoningen (Twelfth Night) January 6. Itis a wooden instrument of archaic appearance, with a special form ofconstruction. They are overblown horns with no finger holes, producing naturalharmonics. There are two kinds of horns made according to this technique: nattehoorns (wet horns) and droog hoorns (dry horns). Dry horns are not traditional.They are a modern version of the Midwinterhoorn, with the wooden halves gluedtogether. Traditional Midwinterhoorns are made usually from curving branches ofalder or birch trees, measuring from about four to six feet (1.2 to 1.8 m). Thelonger the horn, the easier it is to play higher notes. A horn made of alder iscalled an elsenhoorn, and one made of birch is a berkenhoorn. The narrow endwhere the mouthpiece is set can measure from one to two inches (25–50 mm), andsix inches (150 mm) at the wide end.The maker of the natte hoorn shapes the branch, then puts it in a well, where itis left to soak for a period. When the wood has soaked sufficiently, the hornmaker cuts off the bark using a draw knife. When it is thoroughly wet, it ishauled out and split longitudinally. The two halves are hollowed out and madesmooth, and a hole is drilled in the narrow end to take the mouthpiece. Whenready, the two halves are put back together. Bulrush leaves are put in the join,and the horn is lashed together tightly with brummel, willow, or bramble(blackberry) stems coiled round the horn six times, their ends being tuckedbeneath the last coil. Then wooden wedges are hammered under the bindings fromthe narrow end of the instrument. There are at least six bindings on each horn.Then the Midwinterhoorn is put back into the well until the bulrush and bindingshave swollen in the water and made the horn airtight. The wedges are hammeredfarther in, and the hap (mouthpiece) is made of elder wood and fitted into ahole at the narrow end of the horn.Midwinterhoorns are not tuned to any common pitch, as they are essentially soloinstruments used in calling and answering when played with others at a distance.The Midwinterhoorn player holds the horn laterally, though it is blown straightdown the tube. The shape of the mouthpiece allows it to be blown straight downthe tube, although it appears to be across like the classical flute. Someancient images of horns resemble those made today, and many medieval images ofcelestial horn blowers show lateral blowing like the Midwinterhoorn, such as inthe early fourteenth-century wall painting in Schleswig Cathedral, Germany, of ahorn-blowing woman riding a tiger, possibly an image of the goddess Freya. Thenatte hoorn is blown wet, and it is customary to blow the Midwinterhoorn over awell. This amplifies the sound of the horn. When the horn freezes in winter, itproduces a particularly brilliant sound that is said to enhance the fertility ofthe soil and promote an abundant harvest (Montagu 1975, 71–80; Thijsse 1980,passim). The Midwinterhoorn may have survived in this region because Twenteprovince was a Catholic enclave in a Protestant country. The Calvinistprohibitions on music did not reach there, and during the sectarian wars ofreligion it was used as a warning signal of the approach of Protestant militaryforces.PRACTICAL AND MAGICAL MATERIALSWriting “on sound and harmony,” H. C. Agrippa noted that some sounds go welltogether, while others can never be harmonious. One of his examples was thatstrings made of sheep’s gut can never be tuned together with those of wolf’sgut. Although this may not technically be true, it clearly was a tradition amonginstrument makers that certain materials would not work with certain others, sothey were avoided (Agrippa 1993 [1531], II, XXV).Traditional stringed instruments need to be made from combinations of particularwoods if they are to sound good. The back and sides of instruments such asfiddles must be made of a stiff and resonant wood, such as ash, beech, maple,sycamore, walnut, and willow, or rarer woods from fruit trees such as pear andcherry. The main soundboard of the instrument must be made with a thin, stiff,strong wood, cut on the quarter. Conifer wood is ideal, and pine, cedar, fir,and spruce are favoured. The neck must be made from a strong, durable wood thatcan be carved freely, such as sycamore, maple, or beech.Some ancient ballads and sagas give material descriptions of how to make things.The Finnish Kalevala details the materials of the kantele made by Väinämöinenfrom the wood of the birch tree, the materials of the tuning pegs, and thestrings. In Ireland Cormac’s Glossary (ca. 900 CE) tells that the instrumentcalled the timpán was made of sally wood, and the tone of its bronze strings wassoft and sweet. The timpán, upon which the ceol sidhe heard by St. Patrick wasplayed, appears to have been a kind of lyre or psaltery played with a quillplectrum. “The willow has a mystery in it of sound,” wrote Lady Wilde, andaccording to Irish tradition the harp belonging to the eleventh-century KingBrian Boru was made of willow wood (Wilde 1887, II, 117). Some Perchtenlaufbands in Austria, the Holzmusik, play special wind instruments made entirelyfrom wood, some of which are versions of those customarily made from brass.DISORIENTATION BY SOUNDOne can be disoriented by noise, and in Scots there is the word to describe it:gallehooing, a stupefying senseless noise (Warrack 1988 [1911], 202). “Nor dothey want music, and in a strange manner given them by the Devil. . . . Whereeveryone sung what he would, without hearkening to his fellow; like the noise ofdivers oars, falling in the water,” wrote Ben Jonson of the witches in his notesto The Masque of Queens (1609). In the early twentieth century, the Dadaistsproduced the same chaotic, disorienting effect with their “simultaneous poetry.”There is a tradition of disempowerment of spirits by music; for example, theseventeenth-century English tune “Stand Thy Ground Old Harry” was said to wardoff the Devil.Evil spirits are believed to be frightened away by sound, as in the Germancustom of the Richtfest, topping out the roof of a new house. The hullabaloo(Hillebille) is made with hammers, chains, shouting, and singing and is intendedto drive away any evil spirits that would bring bad luck to the new house(Bächtold-Stäubli 1927–1942, III, 1564). Noisemaking is also part of the“charivari” or “skimmington,” a near-riotous gathering in public to expressdisapproval of an unpopular individual. In England this is the “tin can band,”or “rantantanning.” In Germany it is called Katzenmusik (a “caterwaul”), withpeople banging improvised instruments such as cooking pots and pans, and isintended to drive away evil spirits or run people out of town. In Austriahorsemen crack whips at the New Year to purify the air from evil. Noisyfireworks let off at New Year all over the world can also be viewed as drivingaway the evil spirits from the celebration of the new beginning.image [../images/00079.jpeg]Fig. 15.6. Whip-cracking on horseback at New Year, Pongau, Austria."},{"pageContent":"16Keeping Up the Day MARK DAYS AND TIMES OF THE YEARTraditional festivals held on specific days are often called Calendar Customs,but in actuality they are related to the time of year; the calendar only markstheir place in the year. They celebrate either important days in the annualday-length cycle, the changing of the seasons, or religious festivals, many ofwhich relate to the particular season. Aspects or fragments of various oldtraditions are incorporated in certain festivals: Some are initiallypre-Christian in origin, such as Yuletide and May Day; some are derived fromRoman Catholicism, such as the holy days of St. Valentine’s and St. George’sDay. Some are national festivals with a political origin, such as variousIndependence Days, National Days, Guy Fawkes’ Night, and Remembrance Sunday.Some are to do with the annual cycle of agriculture, such as the harvest. Othersare festivals of local veneration of official or unofficial saints. They havecountless local customs connected with them all over northern Europe, and a fewcharacteristic ones are detailed here. The very diversity of origins andsyncretic practices of the year cycle make it futile to assign these mark daysto a particular religion, sect, or nation.They have reached their present state through many changes and additions, andthey continue to evolve as new people find new ways of interpreting them. Eachindividual performance will differ in some way from the previous one, and fromothers happening in other places at the same time, yet to “keep up the day” inwhatever relevant way is to carry on the tradition. Some festivities thatcontinue in the twenty-first century owe their survival to local societies whokept them going against official opposition. In Scotland, lodges of trade guildssuch as the Horsemen’s Society and the Oddfellows preserved the old forms offestivity when they were dying out from universal observance. This is one of thefunctions of traditional unadvertised groups in “keeping up the day,” makingtheir appearances only during their rites and ceremonies of the appropriate day,whether they are expected or not.WAYS TO DEFINE THE YEARThe solar year can be defined in four different traditional ways: the vegetationyear, the flower year, the harvest year, and the maritime year. There are tenpossible year cycles:Solstitial solar years:December–June–December;June–December–JuneEquinoctialsolar years:September–March–September;March–September–MarchVegetationYears:November–May–NovemberFlower Years:May–November–MayHarvestYears:August–February–August;February–August–FebruaryThe MaritimeYear:April–October–January–April;October–January–April–OctoberBetween the two solstices, the traditional rural calendar in Britain and Irelandmarked the end and beginning of winter by the festivals of May Day (Beltane) andAll Saints’ (Samhain), respectively May 1 and November 1 in the modern calendar.In medieval times the agricultural year was regulated by the church’s “redletter days,” particular saints’ days that either continued pre-Christianpractice or coincided with it. Practically, these days were only an indication,as the fluctuations in the weather that might lead to an early or late harvest,for instance, were the real events that mattered.THE ANGLO-SAXON YEARIn the north the physical fact of long days in the summer and short days in thewinter is the common feature of the traditional observances. The different waysof life—pastoral, agricultural, industrial, mercantile, and military—all havetheir contribution to make to days that mark the passing of the years. InEngland the ancient year-cycle is known in detail. The fervent faith of theearly Christian missionaries drove them to obliterate local ancestral traditionsand impose the new religion on them instead. Although early Christianchroniclers hated the traditional rites and ceremonies of the country peoplearound them, in their attempts to discredit the elder faith, they wrote aboutthem, in horror. Fortunately, they recorded what our spiritual ancestors did,and because of this, we can understand the meaning of their rites andceremonies.The seventh-century chronicler Bede tells us that the ancient Angles divided theyear into two halves, defined by the solstices. Each solstice was bracketed by apreceding and following month. In the winter there was Ǽrra Geóla, “BeforeYule,” the month before the winter solstice, and Ǽftera Geóla, “After Yule,” themonth after it. Similarly, in the summer time, two months bracket the summersolstice: Ǽrra Líða before Midsummer, and Ǽftera Líða after it. The Anglo-Saxonmonths had names descriptive of their qualities. January was Ǽftera Geóla;February was Sol-mónaþ, “Mud Month” (later called “February fill dyke”); andApril Eóstre-mónaþ, which was the first month of spring. Eostre was theAnglo-Saxon goddess of the dawn and of springtime, and she gives her name to thefestival of Easter, though its actual date is reckoned according to a modifiedversion of the ancient Jewish calculation of Passover. May was called Þrí-milce,“Three Milkings,” an abundant time when cows have plenty of milk. Ǽrra Líða,“Before the Summer Solstice,” was equivalent to June; July was Ǽftera Líða.August was Weód-mónaþ, “Weed Month,” and September Háligmónaþ, “Holy Month,” themonth in which the harvest festival was celebrated. The church banned the nameHálig-mónaþ and the new month-name Hærfest-monaþ, “Harvest Month,” was invented.October was Winterfulleþ, the month that began winter. November was Blótmónaþ,“Sacrifice Month,” when slaughtered animals were dedicated to the gods. Finally,December, the month before Yule, was Ǽrra Geóla.YULEThroughout northern Europe, religious festivals are linked with the seasons, andrelated folk customs reflect the character of the time of year when they areperformed. In the north, winter darkness is more protracted than farther south,and the midwinter solstice, celebrating the return of the light after thelongest night of the year, is the major festival of the year. Celebrated withfeasting and fires, disguise and games, it is the Old Norse Yule, the “yoke ofthe year,” December 21, the shortest day. This festival was celebrated all overnorthern Europe, and Christmas is its continuation. It was the Norse Jul, SlavicKračun, and the Lithuanian Kūčios and Kalėdos. The festivities of Yule went onfor twelve days, the Twelve Days of Christmas, a time of respite from the hardlabor of everyday toil.YULETIDE GUISINGAll over Europe, in the same way that the church sought to extirpate Paganworship at an earlier period, repeated attempts were made to stamp out theunregulated festivals of the common people. The medieval church was especiallyardent in its attempts to wipe out midwinter rites and ceremonies. Records ofthe attempted suppression of performance traditions, especially those involvinganimal and other disguises, give us some idea of the nature and content of theseevents. Clearly, the church suppressed performances when it could; thedocumentary record is fragmental, but repetitive. There was an especial hatredor fear of people wearing masks and putting on ritual animal disguise. One ofthe bynames of Odin is Grimnir, interpreted literally as “the one with the grimy(blackened) face,” or “the masked one.” Grime means frost or dirt, and a grimface is one frozen in a forbidding expression. The Old Germanic words isengrim,a mask covering the head, or egesgrîma, a “terrifying mask,” refer to this.The continuity of masked guisers and those wearing ritual animal disguise isrecorded in the history of their prohibition. In what is now Spain, the Bishopof Barcelona banned the stag play in 370 CE (Alford 1968, 122–23). There is afourth-century calf mask (vetula) from Liechtenstein preserved in theÖsterreichisches Museum für Volkskunde in Vienna. In France in 543 CE, BishopCaesarius of Arles attempted to suppress mum-ming in ritual animal disguise inthe likeness of calves and other beasts (Bärtsch 1998 [1933], 34). Similarly, in643 the Lombard king Rotharius ordered that those who wore a mask (masca) or adisguise impersonating dead warriors were to be punished. Around the same time,Bishop Eligius of Noyes (died 659) issued edicts against mumming. In 578 CE achurch Council at Auxerre, Burgundy, forbade disguisings, and another Council,in the year 614, stated it was “unlawful to make any indecent plays upon theKalends of January, according to the profane practices of the pagans.” In theninth century Hincmar of Reims told his parishioners that “one must not allowreprehensible plays with the bear, nor with woman dancers, to be performed.”Hincmar used the word talamasca, also used by prohibitionists Regino of Prüm(ca. 900) and Burchard of Wurms in 1020. It appears that Christian missionariesto Pagan territory sometimes mistook the outings of guisers and mummers as anapparition of the Mesnée d’Hellequin. Ordericus Vitalis recorded in hisEcclesiastical History that in January 1091 a priest out in open country atBonneval near Chartres in France came across the Wild Horde, led by a giantcarrying a club followed by a horde of demons. This outing of the Mesnéed’Hellequin is the earliest known literary reference to the Harlequin disguise.The description tallies with contemporary demonic guisers who appear now aroundmidwinter in events such as the Perchtenlauf (Perchten procession) of southGermany and Austria.Saxo Grammaticus (ca. 1200) recorded the practice of setting the severed head ofa sacrificed horse on a pole for magical purposes, and the horse appears as amajor theme in ritual disguisings at midwinter (Saxo 1905, 209). In Iceland atthe same time, between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, successive bishopscondemned people who sang ceremonial songs called Vikivakar, man-to-woman andwoman-to-man. The performances involved animal disguise, the hestleikur (“horsegame”), a man covered with red cloth guising as a horse (Alford 1968, 132). Intwelfth-century England the Bishop of Salisbury, Thomas de Cobham (died 1313),condemned all kinds of actors, especially those who transformed their bodies bycontortions and those who wore masks. In thirteenth-century England prominentclerics issued edicts attempting to suppress various practices. Around 1240 theBishop of Lincoln, Robert Grosseteste, and the Bishop of Worcester, Walter deChanteloup, both made “disciplinary pronouncements.” Chanteloup’s Constitutions(1240) and Grosseteste’s prohibitions (1236–1244) condemned most folk customs,including some of Christian origin. Among them were miracle plays, “scot-ales,”“ram-raisings,” and May Games and other athletic competitions, together withcraftsmen’s “guild-ales” and the ceremonies of Festum Stultorum and the InductioMali sive Autumni. Around 1250 the University of Oxford authorities thought itnecessary to forbid the routs of masked and garlanded students in the churchesand open places of the city.image [../images/00080.jpeg]Fig. 16.1. Perchtenlauf at St. Johann, Pongau, Austria.In the following centuries the Orders of the city of London for 1334, 1393, and1405 forbade a practice of going about the streets at Christmas ove visere nefaux visage (wearing masks) and entering citizens’ houses “to play at dicetherein,” and in 1417 “mumming” was specifically prohibited. In 1418 it wasenacted in London “that no manner of person, of whatever estate, degree, orcondition that ever he be, during this holy time of Christmas be so hardy in anyway to walk by night in any manner mumming, plays, interludes, or any otherdisguisings with any false beards, painted masks, deformed or colored faces inany way . . . except that it is lawful for each person to be honestly merry ashe can, within his own house dwelling”*5 [part0023.html#fr5] (Riley 1868, 669).In Germany they were still trying to stop Yuletide guisers appearing. Fear ofmagic and witchcraft went well beyond the persecution of those who were believedto practice magic. In 1452 masks were banned again in Regensburg, having beenbanned previously in 1249 (Schwedt, Schwedt, and Blümke 1984, 10; Bärtsch 1998[1933], 34). The Bavarian Tegernsee Manuscript of 1458 recorded that women ledby Frau Percht approached human habitations during the Christmas period, and in1480 the Discipuli Sermones also in south Germany condemned people who believedin the goddess “Diana, commonly known as Percht,” who wandered in a throngthrough the darkness. In Nuremberg in 1496 blackening or reddening faces wasprohibited. Like so many official prohibitions, all of these edicts seem to havehad little effect.The ragged Yuillis Yald (Yule Horse) was mentioned by the royal bard ofScotland, William Dunbar, in the late fifteenth century. In 1543 the Bishop ofZealand in Denmark warned his flock not to observe “unholy watch night” (NewYear’s Eve) because the Hvegehors, a man guising as a horse, was part of theobservance (Alford 1968, 132). In 1545 in Rottweil, Germany, “ larven” (carnivalmasks) were prohibited. Masked performers in the Perchtenlauf and carnivals ofGermany were repeatedly subject to punishment. In Bavaria, bans were enacted in1582, 1596, and 1600. In Berchtesgaden, the spiritual home of Frau Percht, thePerchtenlauf was banned in 1601. In Riedlingen in 1745 there were prosecutionsof people who wore masks. The revolution of 1848 in Swabia gave all citizens theright to wear masks again legally. The longest suppression of all was inBiberach, where guising was banned in 1599 and did not return until 1987(Wiesinger 1980, 31). In the twenty-first century, ritual disguise still appearsin many parts of Europe, not least in Santa Claus costumes (with false beards).The Perchtenlauf runs, the Krampus terrifies, straw bears jostle in the streets,the festival of fools rolls on, and in Britain pantomimes with cross-dressedmain characters are put on in many city theaters around the Christmas season.image [../images/00081.jpeg]Fig. 16.2. Krampus, Austria.THE OLD HORSEThe mummers’ horse using a real horse’s skull was significant in British countryrites and ceremonies. It is still used in various mummers’ plays of the Old Oss(old horse), from whose knockabout antics comes the word horseplay, and wherethe horse kills a blacksmith who is then brought back to life by a doctor. InDerbyshire the old horse appears at Yuletide, sometimes alongside the Old Tup, amummer guising as the Derby Ram. The oldest known photograph of an Englishmummers’ team, taken in 1870 at Winster Hall, Derbyshire, has a “horse” madefrom a horse’s skull. At Eckington a skull was dug up from a horse’s graveespecially for the play. “It seems as if the old horse,” wrote S. O. Addy in1907, “were intended to personify the aged and dying year. The year, like aworn-out horse, has become old and decrepit, and just as it ends, the old horsedies. The time at which the ceremony is performed, and its repetition from onehouse to another, indicate that it was a piece of magic intended to bringwelfare to the people in the coming year.” Addy also noted that “guising wasknown among the old Norsemen as skin-play (skinnleikr)” (Addy 1907, 40–42; Cawte1978, 112–18).In 1850 a correspondent using the pen name “Pwwca” wrote to Notes and Queries:“A custom prevails in Wales of carrying about at Christmas time a horse’s skulldressed up with ribbons, and supported on a pole by a man who is concealed undera large white cloth. There is a contrivance for opening and shutting the jaws,and the figure pursues and bites everybody it can lay hold of, and does notrelease them except on payment of a fine. It is generally accompanied by somemen dressed up in a grotesque manner, who, on reaching a house, sing someextempore verses requesting admittance, and are in turn answered by thosewithin, until one party or the other is at a loss for a reply. The Welsh areundoubtedly a poetical people, and these verses often display a good deal ofcleverness. This horse’s head is called Mari Lwyd, which I have heard translated‘grey mare’” (vol. 1 [1850], 173). A similar Twelfth Night custom on the Isle ofMan was recorded by Arthur Moore in 1891:During the supper the laare vane, or white mare, was brought in. This was ahorse’s head made of wood, and so contrived that the person who had charge ofit, being concealed under a white sheet, was able to snap the mouth. He wentround the table snapping the horse’s mouth at the guests who finally chased himfrom the room, after much rough play. (Moore 1891, 104–5)Horse-mask customs continue to this day in Mecklenburg and the Harz Mountains ofGermany, as well as the Innviertel region of Austria.In Britain and Ireland, the day after Christmas, St. Stephen’s Day, or BoxingDay saw a ritual wren hunt. The wren is a bird that according to custom was leftalone except on December 26, when the local Wren Boys went out to hunt one. Whenthey tracked down a wren among the hedges and brambles, it was killed andbrought back processionally to the village tied on top of a pole bedecked withfine ribbons. In Wales some Wren Boys made wooden cages to carry the wrenaround. It was taken from house to house and inn to inn, where special songsabout the wren were sung, with titles such as “Please to See the King” and “TheCutty Wren.” In Ireland the bodhrán was the ceremonial instrument of the WrenBoys. Killing an otherwise protected bird is an instance of reversal in theYuletide period, which included a feast overseen by a person designated the Lordof Misrule, who permitted card playing and other forms of gambling andperformance that were prohibited at other times of year. In Denmark there is aparticular card game called Gnav, which was only played at Christmastime. Yulewas a time of license.TWELFTH NIGHTThe end of the festival of Yule/Christmas was Twelfth Night, the Christianfestival of Epiphany. The custom of wassailing apple trees in England and Walesis observed traditionally around Twelfth Night. Wassailing began as anAnglo-Saxon drinking custom, centered on the loving cup and the wassail bowl,brimming with spiced alcoholic drink. The custom of groups of people visitinghouses with a wassail bowl and singing for largesse had become established by1600, and a rich tradition has come down to us, involving drinking, singing,dancing, guising, and processing from place to place (Cater and Cater 2013,15–50). Wassailing was and is conducted in fruit orchards, to charm the trees tobear plenty of fruit in the coming season. There are special wassail songs. Inhis Hesperides (1648) Robert Herrick encouraged the wassailing of fruit trees:Wassaile the trees, that they may beareYou many a Plum, and many a Peare;For more or lesse fruits they will bring,As you doe give the Wassailing.(HERRICK1902 [1648], 251)SPEED THE PLOUGHPlough Monday is the Monday after Twelfth Night, when the fieldwork began againafter the twelve days of Christmas. It is an ancient custom observed mainly inthe eastern half of England that continues today, bringing out the plough tomagically ready it for the work ahead. There are several theories about theday’s origin, assuming that it has a single origin. One theory is that it wasbrought to England in the ninth century by Danish settlers as Midvintersblót,the day marking the middle of the winter season twenty days after Yule. The dayalso commemorated the victory of the Danish army over the forces of Wessex inthe year 878 that occurred “at midwinter after Twelfth Night,” which wasMidvintersblót or Tiugunde Day, January 13. The Danelaw was established in thatyear, and eastern England was under Danish rule thereafter.Another theory is that Plough Monday was established by the Archbishop of Yorkin the eleventh century. But it is clear that, whatever other festivals havebeen attached to it, it is related to the return to work after the twelve daysof Yule. There is an inscription dating from the late fourteenth century on abeam in the gallery called the Plough Rood of Cawston Church, Norfolk: “Godspede the plow, And send us all corne enow, Our purpose for to mak, At crow ofcok, Of the plwlete of Lygate, Be mery and glade, Wat Good ale this work mad”[God speed the plough and send us ale and corn enough, our purpose for to makeat dawn at the plough light of Lygate. Be merry and glad, what good ale thiswork made]. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, F. Blomefield wrote:“Anciently, a light called the Plough Light was maintained by old and youngpersons who were husbandmen, before images in some churches, and on PloughMonday they had a feast, and went out with a plough and dancers to get money tosupport the Plough Light. The Reformation put out these lights, but the practiceof going about with the plough, begging for money remains, and the ‘money forlight’ increases the income of the village alehouse” (Blomefield 1805–1810, 9,212).In England, Plough Monday was the traditional beginning of the New Year’sploughing. It was marked by a procession of plough-boys and ploughmen aroundtheir local villages, dragging a plough. In nineteenth-century England, therewere two parallel Plough Monday traditions, coming from regions where ploughingwas done by oxen or by horses. In eastern England at Helpston, north ofPeterborough, in the 1820s the peasant poet John Clare recorded that on PloughMonday the Plough Bullocks (from the oxen tradition) all blacked their faces,while only some of the Plough Witches did. The “She Witch” had his face“raddled,” a mixture of colors. In 1873 a newspaper reported what it hoped wasthe end of Plough Monday observance in Ramsey, which it called “this licensedsystem of begging and the attendant foolery of disguised villagers in the bloomof red ochre, the sickly pallor of whiting, or the orthodox demoniacal tint oflampblack” (The Peterborough Advertiser, January 18, 1873, 3). A record fromEye, to the east of Peterborough, in 1894, tells how then on Plough Monday “alarge number of plough boys attired in the most grotesque manner, having facesreddened with ochre or blackened with soot, waited on those known to be in thehabit of remembering the poor old ploughboy” (Peterborough and HuntingdonshireStandard, January 13, 1894, 8).image [../images/00082.jpeg]Fig. 16.3. Plough parade at Whittlesea, Cambridgeshire, England.A correspondent to Fenland Notes & Queries in 1899 records how “the custom onStraw Bear Tuesday was for one of the confraternity of the plough to dress upwith straw one of their number as a bear and call him the Straw Bear. He wasthen taken round the village to entertain by his frantic and clumsy gestures thegood folk who on the previous day had subscribed to the rustics’ spread of beer,tobacco, and beef, at which the bear presided” (Fenland Notes & Queries IV[1899], 228). At Ramsey, Huntingdonshire, where the Straw Bear presided over thefestivities, there was an element of tolerated misrule. It was the custom tosettle personal scores on Plough Monday by playing practical jokes. This mightinvolve ploughing up the garden or the front step, moving the water butt so itwould flood the house when the front door was opened, taking gates off theirhinges and throwing them in the nearest dyke (Marshall 1967, 200–1). At GreatSampford in Cambridgeshire around 1890 on Plough Monday the Accordion Man wasaccompanied by the Pickaxe Man, who used his tool to dig up boot scrapers whenrequested, “up with the scraper, Jack!” At West Wratting, Billy Rash toldfolklorist-performer Russell Wortley in 1960 that on one occasion when money wasrefused them, the ploughboys ploughed a furrow across the lawn of the big housein the village. In Whittlesea in Eastern England (also spelled Whittlesey), thecustom was actively suppressed in 1907 by police action (Frazer and Moore Smith1909, 202–3), though a straw bear was made on later occasions even after WorldWar I and ran clandestinely from house to house avoiding police patrols (GillSennett, personal communication). The Whittlesea Straw Bear reappeared in 1980,and now in the early twenty-first century it presides over a major festivalattended by thousands. Straw bears appear in various parts of Germany around thesame time of year, marking the beginning of the carnival period. One fromWilflingen is shown in figure 16.4.image [../images/00083.jpeg]Fig. 16.4. Straw Bear and attendants at Wilflingen, Germany.FEBRUARY AND THE END OF WINTERSt. Brigid’s Day and Candlemas, February 1–2 are often conflated, as theycoincide with the old Celtic festival called Imbolc or Oimelc. The first is St.Brigid’s Day (Feil Brighde in Irish). Traditionally it was reckoned as the firstday of spring in Ireland. On St. Brigid’s Day an effigy called the breedhogo wascarried around by young people from house to house, where collections of foodand money were made “in honor of Miss Biddy.” The breedhogo was an effigy madefrom straw in the form of a human figure. It had a head made from a ball of hay,and the figure was clad in a woman’s dress and a shawl. A straw plait calledBrigid’s cross was made on St. Brigid’s day and hung up inside the house untilreplaced by another in the following year.image [../images/00084.jpeg]Fig. 16.5. St. Brigid’s Cross, Ireland, and related straw plaits.Many festive days were marked by bonfires, and in Geraardsbergen, Flanders(Belgium), the Tonnekensbrand is burned to mark the end of winter and the returnof the light and the growing season. At sunset a tar barrel is set alight on thesummit of the Oudenberg, and surrounding villages respond to the Tonnekensbrandwith local fires. The Tonnekensbrand is a fire feast that has its own ritualfood, the krakeling, bread in the form of a ring, thrown to the participants bythe mayor. In Swabia (south Germany), on the first Sunday after Ash Wednesday(Funkensonntag), an effigy was burned in the Funkenfeuer.At the end of winter, the ritual of spring cleaning the house takes place,usually in early March, and March 1 was the favored day in parts of England. Thehouse had to be swept thoroughly before a threshold pattern was chalked on thefront doorstep. In Cambridgeshire it was called Foe-ing Out Day. The belief wasthat if this day was not kept up, the household would suffer from an infestationof fleas for the following year.image [../images/00085.jpeg]Fig. 16.6. Foe-ing Out Day threshold pattern in chalk (Cambridge Box), SouthCambridgeshire, England.CARNIVAL AND EASTERThe beginning of the Christian fast called Lent (Shrovetide) was marked by thecarnival (farewell to meat), culminating in Shrove Tuesday (Fastnacht, Fasnet,Fasching, or Mardi Gras). This was a time of festivity and license,characterized by parades of masked people guising as various local mythiccharacters and beasts. In Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, the tradition ofwearing carved wooden masks continues. As with guising customs at other times ofyear, current performance has come through centuries of intermittentpersecutions. In some places the ceremonial masks are kept hidden away for mostof the year, to be brought out at the right time and ceremonially awakened.After the events they are carefully put back to sleep until the next year.A man of straw can be just an empty straw effigy or may actually have a maninside, as the straw bears do. It is unnerving to see a seemingly lifeless strawman suddenly come to life. Straw men with wooden masks perform in central Europein Slovenia, Slovakia, Serbia, and Croatia. Straw Boys come out in Ireland andattend weddings, at one time whether or not they were invited. Unmanned strawmen called Jack O’Lent were burned at mid-Lent in England. Jack O’Lent wasbeaten, kicked, shot at, or burned. In Cornwall he was identified with JudasIscariot (Wright and Lones 1936, I 38). In Liverpool straw effigies of Judaswere burned on Good Friday.image [../images/00086.jpeg]Fig. 16.7. Masked performers on Shrove Tuesday at Rottweil-am-Neckar, Germany.The German equivalent of Jack O’Lent appears on windowsills in south Germany nowduring the period of Fastnacht (Shrovetide). Breughel’s painting The Battle ofCarnival and Lent (1559) has a clothed stuffed straw figure sitting on just sucha ledge. In Germany this straw man is alternatively called the Todpuppe: asymbol of death appearing in the ceremony of Todaustragen, “driving out death”(Flaherty 1992, 40–55). In his 1863 book Das Festliche Jahr, Freiherr vonRheinsberg-Düringsfeld described the effigy of Death being made of old strawwith sticks as arms and legs, clad in old clothing with a face of white linen.Young people danced hand in hand around it, singing and jeering, either draggingthe effigy to a bridge and throwing it off into the water, or taking it to acliff and throwing it over.In 1880 William Bottrell wrote of the practice in Cornwall, western England, “Inthe spring, people visit a ‘Pellar’ (conjuror) as soon as there is ‘twelvehours’ sun,’ to have ‘their protection renewed,’ that is, to be provided withcharms; and the wise man’s good offices to ward off, for the ensuing year, allevil influences of beings who work in darkness.” The reason assigned forobserving this particular time is that “when the sun is come back the Pellar hasmore power to good [do good]” (Bottrell 1880, 187). Easter is the festival ofthe vernal equinox full moon personified by Ostara (Eostre to the Anglo-Saxons),the Germanic goddess of springtime, which was absorbed by the church as its mainfestival but retained the traditional symbolic eggs and related customs fromEuropean ancestral religion. Because hens begin to lay eggs only when days getlonger than nights at the vernal equinox, eggs are symbols of springtime. It istraditional to paint them red or with complex patterns. The oldest extant spring“Easter” egg known was found at Wolin, in Poland. Covered with marbled patterns,it dates from the tenth century CE. In parts of Germany, springs and wells aredecked with thousands of colored eggshells. The Estonian runic calendars marked“ploughing day,” April 14, with a tree with upward-pointing branches. October 14was marked by a tree with drooping branches. In Britain and Scandinavia this daymarked the commencement of the summer half of the year.image [../images/00087.jpeg]Fig. 16.8. Easter eggs bedecking a spring at St. Marien, Germany.MAY DAYIn Britain the month is known as the Merry Month of May. Sir Thomas Malory’sArthurian epic Le Morte D’Arthur (1470s) tells of Queen Gwynevere informing herknights that on May Day she would go a-maying and ordering them all to be wellhorsed and dressed in green. Green is the ritual color of the Merry Month ofMay. In many parts of Britain and Ireland, a May bush (hawthorn, Crataegusmonogyna) was cut on the previous day and stuck in the ground in front of thehouse. An Irish tradition decorated the May bush with eggshells that had beensaved up since Easter Sunday, along with ribbons, wildflowers, and candles. OnMay Night the candles were lit, and people danced around the May bush. The ritewas said to be in honor of the Virgin Mary, to whom the month of May wasdedicated. May Day marks the beginning of the summer Morris dancing season inEngland.image [../images/00088.jpeg]Fig. 16.9. Morris dancing at Oxford, England, on May Day morning.The iconic image of May Day is the maypole, a widespread custom across northernEurope. A German example is illustrated in figure 16.10.image [../images/00089.jpeg]Fig. 16.10. Maypole, Wenneden, Germany.In Wales, May Day is Calan Mai, marking the beginning of the summer half of theyear, as its former name, Calan Haf, the calends of summer, denotes. Theearliest literary reference to a maypole in Wales is in a poem by Gruffydd abAdda ap Dafydd, who died around 1344. The birch maypole was known as y gangenhaf (The Summer Branch), and some were painted in various colors. In 1852 theWelsh bard Nefydd (William Roberts) noted that dawns y fedwen (the Dance of theBirch; i.e., Morris dancing) at maypoles was well known all over Wales. Nefydddescribed the ritual preparation of the pole. First, the leader of the dancewould come and place his circle of ribbon about the pole, and each in his turnafter, until the maypole was covered in ribbons. Then the pole was raised intoposition and the dance begun; each took his place in the dance according to thepersonal piece of ribbon placed upon the maypole (Owen 1987, 102). In theborderlands of England and Wales, it was traditional to cut a birch tree on Maymorning and set it up, bedecked with white and red rags or ribbons, next to thedoor of a stable. This maypole was left up for the whole year and taken downonly on the next May Day, when a new one was set up. A birch set up in Mayprevented malicious sprites from riding horses at night and tangling up theirtails and manes into “witches’ knots.” In the borderlands of England and Wales,crosses of wittan (rowan) and birch, tied with red thread, were set above thecottage door, on pigsties, and in garden seedbeds. On the Isle of Man they usedrowan twigs alone, broken, not cut from the tree, tied with wool taken directlyfrom a sheep’s back, making the Crosh Keirn.Là Beltain (May Day) in the highlands of Scotland was observed with bonfires. Inthe Scottish highlands in the eighteenth century, Beltane or Baaltein, the MayDay festival, “was yet in strict observance.” On May Day people cut a squaretrench in the turf, leaving a square of grass in the middle. A Beltane cake wasbaked upon it “with scrupulous attention to certain rites and forms.” Then itwas broken up, and the fragments, “formally dedicated to birds or beasts of preythat they, or rather the being whose agents they were, might spare the flocksand herds” (Scott 1885, 3). The ritual prayer, “This I give to Thee, preserve my[horses, cattle, etc.]” was recited as the fragments of oatcake were thrown overthe shoulder. Fires were kindled upon high places in pairs and all the cattle ofthe district driven between them to protect them until the next Là Beltain. Allhouse fires were put out and rekindled by fire brought from the sacred fire.Writing in the first half of the nineteenth century, Sir Walter Scott noted“remains of these superstitions might be traced till past the middle of the lastcentury, though fast becoming obsolete, or passing into mere popular customs ofthe country, which the peasantry observe without thinking of their origin”(Scott 1885, 3).In Wales, May Eve is one of the teir nos ysbrydion, the “three spirit nights”occurring each year. Divination traditionally took place on May Eve during theSwper nos Glanmai, the ceremonial May Eve supper, where future lovers could becalled up, “though a hundred miles off.” A coelcerth (ritual fire) was made forCalan Mai. It was prepared by nine men who first removed all metal from theirpersons. Then they collected sticks from nine kinds of trees, and took them tothe place where the fire was to be. A circle was cut in the turf and the sticksarranged crosswise. It was kindled by friction with two pieces of oak. Two firesclose to one another were made so that livestock could be driven between them togive them magical protection against diseases. A calf or sheep would be thrownin the fire whenever there was disease in the herds. This is the tradition ofthe needfire, which was often conducted in extreme conditions, such as famineand pestilence, as a magical attempt to bring the crisis to an end. Ashes fromthe coelcerth were kept for magical purposes (Owen 1987, 97–98). Until thenineteenth century, igniting gunpowder and firing guns in the air was part ofMay Day custom in some English cities with strong civic traditions, includingLondon, Norwich, and Nottingham. Contemporary Pagans keep up the day wheneverpossible with a Beltane fire.MIDSUMMER AND HARVESTThroughout northern Europe there are customs of burning bonfires and fire wheelsat midsummer. The summer solstice, June 21, was also celebrated with theerection of poles (inter alia in Wales, Sweden, and Lithuania) and lightingfires. In Wales, birch poles were raised on two days in the year, May Day andSt. John’s Day. The latter was y fedwen haf, the Summer Birch. Magically, theEve of St. John is one of the Welsh teir nos ysbrydion, when spirits can be morereadily contacted. St. John’s Day (June 24) is a former midsummer’s day,calendar changes having made it out of kilter with the solstice. It is the dayof the Johannesfeuer bonfire. Lammas, August 1, was the Celtic Lá Lúnasa,celebrating the god Lugus, called by contemporary Pagans by its Gaelic name:Lunassadh. It is the “loaf-mass,” the festival of the grain harvest, when thefirst loaf of the new harvest was made and presented to the deity.NOVEMBER, YEAR’S ENDThe old Celtic Samhain (Hallowe’en) in its traditional, precommercialized formsignified the end of harvest, with slaughter of all livestock that could not bekept through the winter. The day marked the end of the summer half of the yearand the beginning of winter. It was celebrated with bonfires and the blowing ofhorns (Owen 1987, 124). The ancestral dead were remembered at this time withfestivals such as the Celtic Lá Samhna and Nos Galan gaeaf and the LithuanianVėlinės. Nos Galan gaeaf, “the eve of the calends of winter,” October 31, isAllhallows’ Eve or Hallowe’en. Calan gaeaf, November 1, was the old Celtic NewYear. It was one of the teir nos ysbrydion (“three spirit nights”) in Wales, atime when wandering ghosts and demonic entities walked abroad. They included theladi wen (white lady) and hwch ddu gwta, the terrifying tailless black sow (Owen1987, 123). The Welsh name for November, mis Tachwedd, denotes slaughtering, andin Anglo-Saxon England, November was Blót-mónaþ, “Sacrifice Month,” when thefarmers who were slaughtering farm animals that could not be overwintereddedicated them as sacrifices to the gods. Excavators of the Northumbrian Pagantemple site at Yeavering discovered a large pile of the bones and skulls of oxeninside the east door of the temple. Next to the temple was a smaller building,probably a cookhouse. The animals killed and dedicated to the gods were servedup in the royal hall nearby.In Ireland, well into the twentieth century, animals were sacrificed to St.Martin on Martinmas, November 11. In 1887 Lady Wilde noted, “There is an oldsuperstition still observed by the people, that blood must be spilt on St.Martin’s Day; so a goose is killed, or a black cock, and the blood is sprinkledover the floor and on the threshold. And some of the flesh is given to the firstbeggar that comes by, in the name and in honor of St. Martin” (Wilde 1887, II,131). In the Aran Isles the sacrificial blood was poured or sprinkled on theground, along the doorposts, and both inside and outside the threshold, and atthe four corners of each room in the house. The blood was from a sacrificedgoose or rooster, but if it was not possible to get one, “people have been knownto cut their finger in order to draw blood, and let it fall upon the earth. Insome places it was the custom for the master of the house to draw a cross on thearm of each member of the family and mark it out in blood. This was a verysacred sign, which no fairy or evil spirit, were they ever so strong, couldovercome; and whoever was signed with the blood was safe” (Wilde 1887, II,131–32).Another Martinmas observance in Ireland was “a singular superstition forbiddingwork of a certain kind to be done on St. Martin’s Day. . . . No woman shouldspin on that day; no miller should grind his corn, and no wheel should beturned. And this custom was long held sacred, and is still observed in theWestern Islands” (Wilde 1887, II, 133)."},{"pageContent":"Postscriptimage [../images/00003.jpeg]Tradition develops, it does not stand still. It is not an unchanging, rigidperformance. It is a historical accident that certain customary rites,ceremonies, and performances have continued for a long time at certain placeswhen similar or identical practices have ceased to be performed in others. Inrecent years, where the interest in vernacular performance has increased, newevents have emerged. Apart from the long-standing assembly at Stonehenge atMidsummer, the Pagan community has established parades and other events,particularly in celebration of Beltane (May Day). These events draw upontraditional elements such as Jack-in-the-Green and May songs old and new. Theolder and newer events have one thing in common: they are keeping up the day. Aparticular day in the year is recognized and celebrated by a public performance,whether it be a sacred day such as Beltane or Fastnacht; a customary day such asBoxing Day and Plough Monday; or a day that has been designated by a moderninterest group, for instance Apple Day. With everyday magic as well as customs,people who are alive now are performing their own interpretations of a traditionthat is authentic, not because we are doing it by the book, but because we aredoing it. Done properly, with respect, and on the right day, the magic is stillimplicit in the performance."},{"pageContent":"Glossary ABBREVIATIONSB BretonD DanishDu DutchEAE East AnglianEnglishG GermanGa GaulishGr GreekI IcelandicIr Irish(Gaeilge)L LatinLE Lancashire EnglishME Midlands EnglishNr NorwegianOE OldEnglish (Anglo-Saxon)ON Old NorseR RomaniSa SámiSc ScotsSG ScotsGaelicSw SwedishW WelshWE West Country EnglishAbred: (W) This material world, the Middle World (Midgard; ON miðgarðr).Acht Ort: (G) Ad quadratum (q.v.).Ad quadratum: (L) Geometrical scheme based on the square and sub-divisions ofthe square, the octagram, and the sixteenfold.Ad triangulum: (L) Geometrical scheme based on the equilateral triangle and itsdevelopment, the hexagram.Æsir: (ON) The gods and goddesses of the later Norse pantheon.Ætt: (ON) Direction, place, family (see Airt).Af hús: (ON) Sacred annex (Pagan chapel) on a farmhouse.Agrimensores: (L) Roman surveyors.Airt: (Sc) Direction, place, family (see Ætt).Álag: (ON) On-lay, a spell or incantation laid upon a particular place.Álf blót: (ON) Offering to the elves or genius loci (q.v.) of a place.Álfreka: (ON) A place that has been spiritually defiled so the elves have beendriven away.Alraun: (G) (1) A natural humanoid root, usually mandrake.
