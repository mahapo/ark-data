But theywere taken seriously by equally intelligent personsin the past, and it is the historian's business toexplain why this was so. I have tried to show theirimportance in the lives of our ancestors and thepractical utility which they often possessed. In thistask I have been much helped by the studies madeby modern social anthropologists of similar beliefsheld in Africa and elsewhere.As my work progressed, I became conscious ofthe close relationship which many of these beliefsbore to the religious ideas of the period. Inoʃering an explanation for misfortune, and ameans of redress at times of adversity, theyseemed to be discharging a role very close to thatof the established Church and its rivals. Sometimesthey were parasitic upon Christian teaching;"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"sometimes they were in sharp rivalry to it. Itherefore widened my scope, so as to make roomfor a fuller consideration of this aspect ofcontemporary religion. By juxtaposing it to theother, less esteemed, systems of belief, I hope tohave thrown more light on both, and to havecontributed to our knowledge of the mentalclimate of early modern England. I have also triedto explore the relationship between this climateand the material environment more generally.The result, inevitably, is a very long book. Evenso, I am well aware of the compressions and over-simpliɹcations which have resulted from handlingso many diʃerent topics over so long a period oftime. But I am anxious to bring out the interrelatednature of these various beliefs and can only do thisby treating them together. The book is arranged sothat the reader who wishes to skip some of thesections can easily do so, but the whole is meant tobe more than the sum of its parts. I also wish toemphasize the essential unity of the periodbetween the Reformation and the dawn of theEnlightenment. This is why the book begins withthe collapse of the medieval Church in the earlysixteenth century and ends with the change in theintellectual atmosphere which is so striking in the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"years approaching 1700. The sources also indicatea halt at the end of the seventeeenth century, sincethe records of both lay and church courts ceasearound that time to be so informative on thematters with which I am concerned.Few of the topics under consideration arepeculiarly English; indeed most of them form partof the general cultural history of the Westernworld. But this survey has been strictly limited toEngland (with occasional excursions into Wales)and I have resisted the temptation to drawparallels with Scotland, Ireland, and the continentof Europe. An exercise in comparative history,however desirable, is not possible until the datafor each country have been properly assembled. Asit is, I have only skimmed the surface of theEnglish material and have blurred some importantregional distinctions.I particularly regret not having been able tooʃer more of those exact statistical data uponwhich the precise analysis of historical changemust so often depend. Unfortunately, the sourcesseldom permit such computation, although it is tobe hoped that the information contained in thelargely unpublished judicial records of the timewill one day be systematically quantiɹed.

Thepopulation was relatively sparse: there wereperhaps two and a half million people in Englandand Wales in 1500, and ɹve and a half million in1700. Even in the later seventeenth century theeconomy gave little indication of theindustrialization which was to come. It is true thatthere was now a highly commercializedagriculture, a vigorous textile industry, asubstantial production of coal and a growingvolume of colonial trade. But the bulk of thepopulation was still engaged in the production offood, and the development of capitalistorganization was still rudimentary. There were"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"few ‘factories’. The typical unit of production wasthe small workshop, and cottage industry was stillthe basis of textile manufacture.Most of the population lived in the countryside.Gregory King, the pioneer statistician, to whom weowe most of our ɹgures for this period, calculatedthat in 1688 nearly eighty per cent of thepopulation lived in villages and hamlets. Most ofthe urban areas were very small; Birmingham,Bristol, Exeter, Newcastle, Norwich and York werethe only provincial cities with more than tenthousand inhabitants. Norwich, the largest ofthese, had about thirty thousand. The one strikingexception to this pattern of life in scattered ruralcommunities was the capital city. London'spopulation multiplied tenfold during thesecenturies; by 1700 it was well over half a millionand still growing. It has been estimated thatperhaps a sixth of the total population spent atleast part of their lives in this great metropolis,many of them returning to their rural communitieswith newly acquired urban habits of living.1Society was highly stratiɹed and the contrastbetween rich and poor was everywhereconspicuous. Gregory King calculated that in 1688"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"over half the population were ‘decreasing thewealth of the kingdom’, that is to say earning lessthan they consumed. There can be no doubt thatbetween a third and a half of the population livedat subsistence level and were chronically under-employed. These were the ‘cottagers, paupers,labouring people and outservants’, as King calledthem. Many of these were copy-holders occupyingtheir own small tenements, but even more werewage labourers, for the decline of the Englishpeasantry was already under way. Above themcame the more prosperous classes of farmers,freeholders and tradesmen. At the top was thetraditional élite of landed gentry and nobility,now strongly challenged by the rising professionalgroups, lawyers, clergymen, merchants andoɽcials. King estimated that the landowners andprofessional classes, though only ɹve per cent ofthe population, enjoyed a larger proportion of thenational income than did all the lower classes(over fifty per cent) put together.Conditions of life varied so much among thesediʃerent elements of the population that it is hardfor the historian not to be struck more by thediʃerences than by the similarities. Tudor andStuart England may have been an under-developed"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"society, dependent upon the labours of an under-nourished and ignorant population, but it alsoproduced one of the greatest literary cultures everknown and witnessed an unprecedented fermentof scientiɹc and intellectual activity. Not everyunder-developed society has its Shakespeare,Milton, Locke, Wren and Newton. The social élitewas highly educated. It has been calculated that by1660 there was a grammar school for every 4,400persons, and that two and a half per cent of therelevant age-group of the male population wasreceiving some form of higher education, at Oxfordand Cambridge, or at the Inns of Court. The latteris a higher ɹgure than any attained again untilafter the First World War.2 It was an age ofimmense creative activity in the ɹelds of drama,poetry, prose, architecture, theology, mathematics,physics, chemistry, history, philology and manyother learned disciplines. Yet it was also a timewhen a large, but as yet unknown, proportion ofthe population (perhaps between half and twothirds of adult males in the mid seventeenthcentury) was unable to read, or at least signedwith a mark.3It is this huge variation in standard of living,"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"educational level and intellectual sensibility whichmakes this society so diverse, and therefore sohard to generalize about. Not only did conditionschange over the two centuries, but at any onepoint in time there were so many diʃerent layersof belief and levels in sophistication. Theinvention of the printed word, moreover, hadmade possible the preservation and disseminationof many diʃerent systems of thought, derivingfrom other societies and sometimes dating fromthe remote classical past. The task of the historianis thus inɹnitely harder than that of the socialanthropologist, studying a small homogeneouscommunity in which all inhabitants share the samebeliefs, and where few of those beliefs areborrowed from other societies. This was no simpleuniɹed primitive world, but a dynamic andinɹnitely various society, where social andintellectual change had long been at work andwhere currents were moving in many diʃerentdirections.The beliefs with which this book is concernedhad a variety of social and intellectualimplications. But one of their central features wasa preoccupation with the explanation and relief of"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"human misfortune. There can be no doubt that thisconcern reɻected the hazards of an intenselyinsecure environment. This is not to suggest that itwas these hazards which brought the beliefs intobeing. On the contrary, most of the latter had beeninherited from earlier generations and thereforepreceded the society in which they ɻourished.Nevertheless, there were certain features of thesixteenth- and seventeenth-century environmentby which they could hardly fail to be coloured.Of these the ɹrst was the expectation of life.Systematic demographic research upon the historyof England during these two centuries has only justbegun, and the inadequacies of the evidenceprobably mean that our knowledge of the healthand physical condition of contemporaries willalways be incomplete. But it is beyond dispute thatTudor and Stuart Englishmen were, by ourstandards, exceedingly liable to pain, sickness andpremature death. Even among the nobility, whosechances are likely to have been better than thoseof other classes, the life expectation at birth ofboys born in the third quarter of the seventeenthcentury was 29.6 years. Today it would be around70. A third of these aristocratic infants died beforethe age of ɹve, while the level of mortality among"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"those who lived to be adults closely resembled thatof India in the last decade of the nineteenthcentury.4 In London, conditions were particularlybad. The ɹrst English demographer, John Graunt,estimated in 1662 that, of every hundred livechildren born in the metropolis, thirty-six died intheir first six years and a further twenty-four in thefollowing ten years. He calculated the expectationat birth to be less than that which was to be theɹgure for India during the inɻuenza pandemic of1911–21.5 Graunt's estimate may have beenunduly pessimistic. In any case he lived at a timewhen the mortality rate was untypically high. Inthe mid sixteenth century the expectation at birthmay have been as high as 40-45, for country folkanyway.6 But contemporaries did not needelaborate demographic investigations to tell themthat life was short, and that the odds were againstany individual living out his full span. ‘We shallɹnd more who have died within thirty or thirty-five years of age than passed it,’ remarked a writerin 1635.7 Even those who survived couldanticipate a lifetime of intermittent pain. Literarysources suggest that many persons suʃeredchronically from some ailment or other, and this"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"impression is conɹrmed by inferences from what isknown of contemporary diet.The food supply was always precarious andthroughout the period the fate of the annualharvest remained crucial. The meagre evidenceavailable suggests that the yield-ratio on seed cornmay have doubled between 1500 and 1660, but sodid the population. About one harvest in six seemsto have been a total failure, and mortality couldsoar when times of dearth coincided with (orperhaps occasioned) large-scale epidemics.8 In theseventeenth century, however, it was rare, butcertainly not unknown, for men to die in thestreets from starvation or exposure.9 Yet even attimes of plenty most people seem to have suʃeredfrom a lack of Vitamin A (yellow and greenvegetables) and Vitamin D (milk and eggs). Theɹrst of these deɹciencies accounts for thenumerous complaints of ‘sore eyes'(xerophthalmia), the second for the widespreadincidence of rickets. Scorbutic diseases were alsocommon. The well-known ‘green sickness’ inyoung women, to which contemporaries gave asexual meaning, was chlorosis, anaemia producedby a lack of iron in the diet, stemming from upper-"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"class disdain for fresh vegetables. The well-to-doate too much meat and were frequentlyconstipated. They did not regard milk as a drinkfor adults and they frequently suʃered from theinfection of the urinary tract which produced thenotorious Stuart malady of stone in the bladder.The dietary deɹciencies of the lower classes, bycontrast, reɻected not so much ignorance assimple poverty. Not until the nineteenth centurydid labourers get enough meat and butter. In theseventeenth century they may have escaped thegout and stone which plagued their betters, andmay even have had better teeth from eating morevegetables. But they were chronically under-nourished and vulnerable to tuberculosis andgastric upsets (‘griping in the guts’) caused by badfood.10 Rich and poor alike were victims of theinfections generated by the lack of hygiene,ignorance of antiseptics and absence of eʃectivesanitation.

Inprovincial towns plague deaths sometimes tookaway an even higher proportion of thepopulation.13The plague terriɹed by its suddenness, itsvirulence and its social eʃects. The upper classeswould emigrate temporarily from the aʀictedarea, leaving the poor to die. Unemployment, foodshortage, looting and violence usually resulted.The refugees themselves were liable to receiverough treatment from country folk, frightened theywere bringing the disease with them.

No suchimmunity was available to the inhabitants ofTudor and Stuart England, for medical science washelpless before most contemporary hazards tohealth. There was an organised medicalprofession, but it had little to oʃer. In thesixteenth and early seventeenth centuriesuniversity-educated physicians were given a purelyacademic training in the principles of humoralphysiology as set out in the works of Hippocrates,Aristotle and Galen. They were taught that illnesssprang from an imbalance between the fourhumours (blood, phlegm, yellow bile and blackbile). Diagnosis consisted in establishing which ofthese humours was out of line, and therapy intaking steps to restore the balance, either by"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"bloodletting (by venesection, scariɹcation orapplying leeches) or by subjecting the patient to acourse of purges and emetics. The physician thusfollowed a dreary round of blood-letting andpurging, along with the prescription of plasters,ointments and potions. He focused on what weshould regard as the symptoms of disease – feveror dysentery – rather than the disease itself. Thepatient's urine was taken to be the best guide tohis condition, and there were some practitionerswho even thought it enough to see the urinewithout the patient, though the Royal College ofPhysicians condemned this habit.15 It was just aswell that in strict Galenic theory one of thehumours was bound to predominate unnaturally,so that perfect health was almost by deɹnitionunattainable.16In the seventeenth century, accordingly, doctorswere quite unable to diagnose or treat mostcontemporary illnesses. ‘Many diseases theycannot cure at all,’ declared Robert Burton, ‘asapoplexy, epilepsy, stone, strangury, gout...,quartan agues; a common ague sometimesstumbles them all.’17 Internal medicine had towait upon the slow development of physiology"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"and anatomy. There were no X-rays and nostethoscopes, and a physician was usually quiteignorant of what was actually going on inside asick person's body. There were surgeons who dealtwith tumours, ulcers, fractures and venerealdisease. But their art was regarded as an inferiorone by the physicians. Besides, withoutanaesthetics or knowledge of antiseptics, therewas very little they could do. Operations werelargely conɹned to amputations, trepanning theskull, cutting for stone, bone-setting and incisingabscesses. Patients were understandably terriɹedof undergoing this kind of torture and themortality rate after such operations was high.Richard Wiseman's standard Severall ChirurgicallTreatises (1676) was popularly known as‘Wiseman's Book of Martyrs’.18Nowhere was the inadequacy of contemporarymedical technique more apparent than in itshandling of the threat presented by the plague. Afew physicians noticed that rats came out of theirholes at times of plague,19 but they did notassociate them with the disease; indeed, by urgingthat cats and dogs be killed in order to checkinfection, they may have actually worsened the"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"situation. Contemporaries preferred to attributeplague to a combination of noxious vapours in theair and corrupt humours in the body, though theydisagreed about the causes of these phenomenaand about whether or not the disease wascontagious. As a preacher bluntly said in 1603,‘Whence it cometh, whereof it ariseth andwherefore it is sent... they confess theirignorance.’20 All sorts of amulets andpreservatives were recommended – tobacco,arsenic, quicksilver, dried toads. Much energy wasalso devoted to ɹnding some means of allayingpopular panic, on the assumption that the happyman would not get plague. As a furtherpreventive, the physicians prescribed betterhygiene, which was sensible enough, and thelocking up of infected parties within their ownhouses, which was less sensible, since by conɹningother members of the family to the habitat of therats they must have increased the toll of deaths. Noprogress had been made in the study of plague bythe time of the great visitation of London in 1665.‘It is a mysterious disease,’ confessed the currentSecretary of the Royal Society, ‘and I am afraidwill remain so, for all the observations and"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"discourses made of it.’21Yet the failure of contemporary doctors to oʃeran adequate therapy for this or most othercontemporary diseases did not matter very muchto most of the population. The attentions of aqualiɹed physician were eʃectively beyond theirreach, because there was a severely limited supplyof trained men. The Royal College of Physicianshad been set up in 1518 to supervise and licensephysicians practising in the City of London andwithin a seven-mile radius. The College seems tohave exercised this monopoly in a jealous andrestrictive way, for it kept its numbers small,despite an immense subsequent increase in the sizeof the City. In the ɹrst years of its foundation theCollege had only a dozen members, whereasLondon's population was perhaps sixty thousand.By 1589 the College's membership had risen tothirty-eight while the population had more thandoubled. Thereafter the number of inhabitantscontinued to rise spectacularly, but the size of theCollege remained almost stationary until the CivilWar period. The number of Fellows was raised toforty in 1663 and the College expanded further inthe later Stuart period. But the ratio of the London"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"population to its resident members and licentiatescan never have been less than five thousand to oneand was usually very much greater.22In the provinces, where the licensing powersexercised by the College were never so importantas those of the Church and Universities, thesituation was rather better. The number of countryphysicians rose steadily through the period. Onemodern student has compiled a list of 814physicians who are known to have been licensedbetween 1603 and 1643.23 It shows that sometowns were relatively well supplied with qualiɹeddoctors. Norwich had seventeen, Canterburytwenty-two, Exeter thirteen and York ten. Not allthese may have actually practised, but the listitself is an under-estimate, since not all the recordsof the period have survived. By the end of theseventeenth century there can have been fewmarket-towns without a resident physician.Richard Baxter, the nonconformist divine, whotells us he was very seldom without pain, was ableas a young man to consult no fewer than thirty-sixdifferent physicians.24Physicians, however, were too expensive for thebottom half of the population, even though they"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"often tailored their bills to ɹt the pockets of theirclients. In the seventeenth century a gentlemancould expect to be charged about a pound a dayfor medical attendance, but humbler persons mightget oʃ for a few shillings if the doctor was sodisposed.25 Nevertheless, there were manycomplaints that it was only the wealthy who couldregularly aʃord a physician. ‘Physic,’ declaredBishop Latimer in 1552, ‘is a remedy preparedonly for rich folks and not for poor; for the poorman is not able to wage the physician.’ At the endof the seventeenth century Richard Baxter wrotethat ‘many a thousand lie sick and die that havenot money for physicians’: even ‘frugal freeholdersof twenty or thirty pounds a year’ had diɽculty inɹnding ‘ten shillings to save their lives in cases ofdanger’.26 The Royal College of Physicians in1687 ruled that their members should give freeadvice to the poor and soon afterwards set up ashort-lived Dispensary to sell medicine at costprice. This step angered the apothecaries (grocers-cum-drug-sellers) and did not solve the problem.27Parishes were expected to pay medical fees fortheir paupers and some municipalities appointedtown doctors,28 but the provision of a state"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"medical service was urged only by utopianthinkers. One of them, John Bellers, declared in1714 that half the people who died annuallysuʃered from curable diseases, for which only theirpoverty prevented them from finding a remedy.29In lieu of the physicians, patients could turn tothe surgeons and apothecaries. Seventy-twosurgeons were licensed to practise in London in1514, while in 1634 the apothecaries were thoughtto number at least a hundred and ɹfty. By 1701there were said to be a thousand in London and afurther ɹfteen hundred apprentices. Theyoutnumbered the physicians by ɹve to one.30 Theapothecaries thus took on the task of diagnosingand prescribing the medicine as well as supplyingit. The physicians resisted this incursion into theirterritory and the seventeenth century witnessed aprotracted legal battle which did not end until1704, when the apothecaries’ right to give medicaladvice (though not to charge for it) was upheld bythe House of Lords. But they had long engaged ingeneral practice in the provinces, wheredistinctions between themselves and the physiciansand surgeons had been less rigid, while in Londonthey claimed to be handling ninety-ɹve per cent of"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"medical practice before the end of the seventeenthcentury.31 After 1704 their evolution into themodern general practitioner was assured. Nor wastheir treatment necessarily inferior to that oʃeredby the physicians. On the contrary, the very size oftheir clientele forced them into prescribing newdrugs, of a kind frowned upon by the RoyalCollege, in place of the time-consuming humoralremedies.32But the impact of organized medicine upon thelower reaches of the population was seldom morethan superɹcial. Many of the poor chose to gooutside the ranks of the licensed practitionersaltogether, and to consult an empiric, herbalist,wise woman, or other member of that ‘greatmultitude of ignorant persons’ whose practice ofphysic and surgery had been denounced byParliament in 1512. In 1542–3 another Act hadallowed anyone with the necessary knowledge totreat external sores and prescribe for the stone.According to a pamphleteer in 1669, there was‘scarce a pissing-place about the City’ which wasnot adorned by posters advertising the services ofsome medical quack.33 Some of the nostrums thuspeddled reɻected genuine country lore about herbs"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"and roots; others did the patient severe or evenfatal damage.34But this was above all a time when medicinebegan at home. Every housewife had herrepertoire of private remedies. ‘All the nation arealready physicians,’ remarked Nicholas Culpepperin 1649. ‘If you ail anything, every one you meet,whether a man or woman, will prescribe you amedicine for it.’ ‘None practise physic orprofesseth midwifery’, reported the villagers ofDry Drayton, Cambridgeshire, in 1662, ‘butcharitably one neighbour helps one another’.35 Inchildbirth, indeed, a physician was neveremployed, save by the very wealthy, or in cases ofunusual emergency. There was no shortage ofmidwives, licensed and unlicensed, but theirqualiɹcations were rudimentary. The forceps hadbeen invented by Peter Chamberlen early in theseventeenth century, but he kept it secret and theusual obstetric tools were cruel and ineɽcient. Amidwife estimated in 1687 that two thirds ofcontemporary abortions, stillbirths, and deaths inchild-bed were to be attributed to the lack of careand skill displayed by her colleagues.36 The wifeof one Newark apothecary was so afraid of any"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"midwife coming near her that her husband used tolock her alone in her room until the delivery wasover.37As for hospitals, St. Bartholomew's and St.Thomas's were the only two for the physically ill inLondon at the end of the seventeenth century andthere were few elsewhere. They were in any casemeant primarily for the poor. No person of socialpretensions would dream of entering one as apatient; and if he did he would certainly beincreasing his chances of contracting some fatalinfection.Even less could be done for suʃerers frommental illness. Contemporary medical therapy wasprimarily addressed to the ailments of the body.‘For the diseases of the mind,’ wrote RobertBurton, ‘we take no notice of them.’ Ravingpsychotics were locked up by their relatives, keptunder guard by parish oɽcers, or sent to houses ofcorrection.38 Less dramatic forms of mental illnesswere regarded either as cases of melancholy to betreated by purging and blood-letting, or wronglydiagnosed as ‘hysteria’, stemming from a conditionof the uterus. The uterine origin of nervousdiseases was not successfully challenged in"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"England until the later seventeenth century, whenThomas Willis formulated the theory of thecerebral origin of hysteria and pioneered thescience of neurology.39There was thus no orthodox medical agencywhich offered a satisfactory cure for mental illness.Various low-grade practitioners took out licencesas ‘curers of mad folks and distracted persons’, andsome of them maintained private madhouses. Yeteven Bethlem Hospital (Bedlam) in Londondischarged its inmates as incurable if they had notrecovered within a year.40 It is not surprising thatsupernatural explanations of mental depressionwere advanced or that the main psychotherapistswere the clergy. Physic alone was not enough tocure melancholy, declared the Puritan oracle,William Perkins.41These were the circumstances in which so manyunorthodox methods of healing enjoyed prestige.The population at large disliked Galenic physic forits nauseous remedies,42 and were frightened bythe prospect of surgery. Some of the mostintelligent laymen of the day expressed totalcontempt for conventional medicine; and the"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"unorthodox empirics hounded by the Royal Collegeof Physicians often turned out to have inɻuentialchampions.43 King James I regarded academicmedicine as mere conjecture and therefore useless.Francis Bacon thought that ‘empirics and oldwomen’ were ‘more happy many times in theircures than learned physicians’. Robert Burton,Archbishop Abbot, and many less notablecontemporaries, said the same. Some scientists andintellectuals followed the example of Paracelsusand were prepared to learn from herbalists andwise women.44 Thomas Hobbes, who took a keeninterest in the problem of survival, concluded thathe would ‘rather have the advice or take physicfrom an experienced old woman that had been atmany sick people's bedsides, than from thelearnedst but unexperienced physician’.45 Doctorsof physic, thought the sectary, LodowickMuggleton, were ‘the greatest cheats... in theworld. If there were never a doctor of physic in theworld, people would live longer and liver better inhealth.’46Before discounting such lay opinions we shouldrecall that even Thomas Sydenham, the greatestphysician of the seventeenth century, thought that"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"it would have been better for many patients if theart of physic had never been invented, remarkingthat many poor men owed their lives to theirinability to aʃord conventional treatment.47 Norwas he alone among his colleagues in holding suchopinions. ‘I have heard the learned and pious Dr.Ridgeley, M.D., say,’ recalled John Aubrey, ‘that ifthe world knew the villainy and knavery (besideignorance) of the physicians and apothecaries, thepeople would throw stones at 'em as they walkedin the streets.’48Helplessness in the face of disease was anessential element in the background to the beliefswith which we shall be concerned. So too wasvulnerability to other kinds of misfortune,particularly when it came suddenly. Next toplague, perhaps the greatest single threat tosecurity was ɹre. This was more of a risk in thesixteenth and seventeenth centuries than it istoday and contemporaries were much less well-equipped to deal with it. The towns wereparticularly vulnerable with their thatched roofs,wooden chimneys and crowded living conditions.Since there were no safety matches, people often"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"chose to fetch a bucket of burning coals from aneighbour rather than waste time struggling with atinder-box. At night they were dependent oncandles, which, when set down in a draughtyplace, could easily put a house on ɹre. ‘Fearcandle, good wife,’ warned the agricultural writer,Thomas Tusser, ‘Fear candle in hay loft, in barnand in shed.’ When the chimney needed cleaning itwas common to take a short cut by ɹring a gun upit or even setting it on ɹre: this was how theBeccles fire was started in 1586, with eighty housesburned down as a result.49 A further risk camefrom the numerous industrial workshops, scatteredamong the houses, and observing the mostrudimentary safety precautions. Dyers, brewersand soapboilers were a constant source of danger:the ɹre which did £200,000-worth of damage atTiverton in 1612 began when a dyer's furnace wasallowed to become overheated.50Some of the biggest conɻagrations were theresult of carelessness engendered by primitiveliving conditions. A hundred and ɹfty buildingswere damaged at Woburn in 1595 after an oldwoman had set her thatched house alight bythrowing all her used bed-straw on the ɹre."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Tiverton was heavily damaged in 1598 when a ɹrewas started by some beggar-women who had beenpathetically trying to cook pancakes on strawbecause they could not aʃord to buy wood.

Most of the Palace of Whitehall was burneddown in 1698 because a Dutch washerwoman triedto hasten the drying of her linen by lighting acharcoal fire indoors.51Once ɹre had broken out it seldom encounteredmuch in the way of eʃective resistance. Fire-ɹghting techniques were virtually unchanged inEngland between the Norman Conquest and thedeath of Elizabeth I.52 Even the most advancedmunicipality possessed nothing more in the way ofequipment than some leather buckets, a fewladders and iron hooks for pulling down thatch soas to stop the ɹre spreading. Until the midseventeenth century there were no engines toproject water to a height, and the water supplyitself was usually unreliable. Some towns requiredhouseholders to keep buckets of water outside theirdoors. Others tried to check the erection of woodenbuildings and thatched roofs. This had been the"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"oɽcial policy of the City of London since thetwelfth century. But such regulations were easierto make than to enforce, and the ɹre-ɹghtingequipment usually proved sadly inadequate whenthe blaze was under way. There were no ɹrebrigades, and the scene at a fire was usually one ofunrelieved chaos. The only eʃective waycontemporaries knew of stopping a ɹre was toblow up all the buildings around it to stop itspreading. When the ɻames dwindled there wasinvariably trouble with pilferers.53Unable to prevent the outbreak of ɹre, andvirtually helpless during the actual conɻagration,contemporaries showed little more resource whenit came to bearing the loss. There was noorganised ɹre insurance until the last two decadesof the seventeenth century. All that the victim ofɹre could do was to apply for a Church brief,authorising a collection to be made on his behalfin places of public worship. These begging letterswere issued for a variety of charitable purposesand were as unreliable as modern ɻag-days. Norwas their prestige enhanced by the numerous pettyfrauds which grew around them. But they help usto form some estimate of the actual scale of ɹre"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"damage. They show, for example, that in the lastɹfty years of the seventeenth century there wereeighty-nine separate ɹres in which the damageincurred was estimated at £1,000 or more: thetotal cost of this group of large ɹres was put at£913,416.54 In assessing this ɹgure we shouldrecall that it excludes the Great Fire of London(1666), which did £10 millions of damage,destroying over 13,000 houses, and leavingperhaps 100,000 people homeless.55 It alsoexcludes numerous smaller ɹres, as well as thosefor which no record has survived, or for which nobrief was issued. All this, moreover, took place at atime when ɹre-ɹghting methods had begun toimprove; in the sixteenth century the situation wasworse.As a purely economic factor, therefore, ɹre wasexceedingly important. But its humanconsequences are even more obvious, for there wasno occurrence which so graphically symbolized theinstability of human fortunes. ‘He which at oneo'clock was worth ɹve thousand pounds and, asthe prophet saith, drank his wine in bowls of ɹnesilver plate, had not by two o'clock so much as awooden dish left to eat his meat in, nor a house to"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"cover his sorrowful head.’56 The briefs which wereread aloud in the churches on Sundays served as aconstant reminder of how men could be reduced inan instant from wealth to utter penury, and howthere was no telling whose turn it might be next.The psychological threat was increased by thecapriciousness of the danger. Some towns escapedserious ɹre; whereas others suʃered again andagain. Tiverton was burned down three times(1598, 1612, 1731). Marlborough, Blandford,Dorchester and Beaminster all suʃered repeatedly.Warwick and Northampton had only one seriousɹre each, but in both cases it destroyed a largepart of the town. Ip the metropolis ɹres were socommon that when the great ɹre in 1666 beganscarcely anyone outside its immediate vicinity tookany notice.57Poverty, sickness, and sudden disaster were thusfamiliar features of the social environment of thisperiod. But we must not make the anachronisticmistake of assuming that contemporaries were asdaunted by them as we should be, were wesuddenly pitchforked backwards in time. In Tudorand Stuart England men were fully accustomed to"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"disease and a low expectation of life. Parents wereslower to recognise the individuality of theirchildren, for they well knew that they might losethem in their infancy. Husbands and wives werebetter adjusted to the idea of the surviving partnermarrying after the other's death. The attitude ofthe poor to their lot seems often to have been oneof careless stoicism. Many middle-class observerscommented on their insensibility in face of thedangers of the plague, and were shocked by thegeneral reluctance to obey regulations designedfor their own safety.58 When starvationthreatened, the poor were capable of usingviolence to secure food for themselves, but theymade little contribution to the political radicalismof the time and showed no interest in attemptingto change the structure of the society in which theyfound themselves. Unlike the inhabitants of today'sunder-developed countries, they knew of noforeign countries where the standard of living wasnotably higher. Instead of working for socialreform they often turned to more direct methods ofliberation.Drink, for example, was built into the fabric ofsocial life. It played a part in nearly every public"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"and private ceremony, every commercial bargain,every craft ritual, every private occasion ofmourning or rejoicing. At fairs and markets, whichremained exempt until 1874 from ordinarylicensing restrictions, the consumption could beenormous. ‘Go but to the town's end where a fair iskept,’ remarked a preacher in 1638, ‘and therethey lie, as if some ɹeld had been fought; here liesone man, there another.’ As a Frenchman observedin 1672, there was no business which could bedone in England without pots of beer.59 Latemedieval preachers complained that working-mengot drunk at least once a week; while in the reignof Charles II foreign visitors noticed that artisansdid not let a day go by without a visit to thealehouse.60The beer was cheap to make. The Elizabethancountry clergyman, William Harrison, had 200gallons brewed every month in his household, foran outlay of only twenty shillings a time.61 We donot know the size of his household, but the dailyconsumption was obviously high. At sea and onland the standard allowance of beer per headseems to have been a gallon a day.62 Beer was abasic ingredient in everyone's diet, children as well"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"as adults. The ɹrst available ɹgures for the totalnational consumption date from the lateseventeenth century. They show that in 1684 dutywas charged in England and Wales on a total of6,318,000 barrels of beer (4,384,000 of strongbeer, 1,934,000 of small beer), each barrelcontaining thirty-six gallons in London, and thirty-four in the provinces. This suggests that eachmember of the population, man, woman and child,consumed almost forty gallons a year, i.e. nearly apint a day. But allowance must also be made forthe beer brewed privately on which excise was notcharged: Gregory King estimated that in 1688 thiscame to a further seventy per cent of the originaltotal. Even without this addition the per capitaconsumption ɹgure is higher than anything knownin modern times.63 And this is to take no accountof the foreign wine imports or the growing volumeof spirit consumption.It may be that the greater quantity of salt meatand ɹsh consumed in the seventeenth centurymade men thirstier. It is also likely that thelistlessness produced by a predominantly cerealdiet created a greater demand for a stimulant. Theabsence of alternative beverages further helped to"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"drive men to alcohol. Tea and coʃee were stillluxuries. Tea cost twenty shillings a pound at theend of the seventeenth century64 and did notestablish itself as a working-class drink until thelast quarter of the eighteenth century. Coʃeeplayed an even slighter part in the drinking habitsof the population at large, though it became veryfashionable among London sophisticates.Alcohol was thus an essential narcotic whichanaesthetized men against the strains ofcontemporary life. Drunkenness broke down socialdistinctions, and brought a temporary mood ofoptimism to the desperate. It was extensive inElizabethan prisons65 and among the lowerclasses. (It was only during the seventeenthcentury that the lord replaced the beggar asproverbially the drunkest member of thecommunity.) 66 The poor took to drink to blot outsome of the horror in their lives. Alcohol ɻowedfreely at times of plague: ‘I have myself seen,’recalled a preacher in 1638, ‘when the Bills [ofMortality] were at the highest, even bearers whohad little respite from carrying dead corpses totheir graves and many others of the like rank goreeling in the streets.’67 At executions drink was"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"always oʃered to the condemned: the witch, AnneBodenham, who was executed at Salisbury in 1653,kept asking for drink and would have died drunk ifher persecutors had allowed her.68 Ale, wrote acontemporary,doth comfort the heavy and troubled mind; it willmake a weeping widow laugh and forget sorrowfor her deceased husband;... it is the warmestlining of a naked man's coat; it satiates andassuages hunger and cold; with a toast it is thepoor man's comfort; the shepherd, mower,ploughman, and blacksmith's most esteemedpurchase; it is the tinker's treasure, the pedlar'sjewel, the beggar's joy; and the prisoner's lovingnurse.69As a means of making life appear momentarilytolerable, drink had few rivals among the verypoor. There was more good in a cask of ale than inthe four gospels, declared a ɹfteenth-centuryheretic; malt, he thought, did more to justify God'sways to man than the Bible.70A newer form of narcotic was tobacco. Smoking"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"was introduced to England early in the reign ofElizabeth I and had become well-established by thetime of her death. At ɹrst there was an attempt torepresent tobacco as being taken only formedicinal purposes, but the pretence soon becameunconvincing. In 1597 a contemporary remarkedthat addicts were consuming it ‘for wantonness...and cannot forbear it, no, not in the middest oftheir dinner’. Jacobean observers were familiarwith the chain smoker who puʃed his pipe frommorning to night, and even in bed.71 ‘Tis death tosome to be barred tobacco,’ declared a Member ofParliament in 1621.72 Yet pipe-smoking was anexpensive habit. Tobacco varied widely in priceaccording to the supply, but it seldom sold for lessthan a pound per pound in the reign of James I,and often cost more. Figures for domesticconsumption are spasmodic, but they indicate asteady rise, from an annual average of 140,000pounds in 1614–21 to 11,300,000 pounds in 1699–1709. This suggests that the consumption per headof population went up from less than an ounce ayear at the beginning of the century to nearly twopounds at the end. Not until 1907 did the ɹguresreach this level again.73 Tobacco must have done"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"something to steady the nerves of StuartEnglishmen. One modern historian has suggested,not entirely frivolously, that it helped to foster thevirtues of political compromise which emerged inthe later seventeenth century. Holy Communion,thought Christopher Marlowe, would have been‘much better being administered in a tobaccopipe’.74A further escape from reality was gambling. Inmodern times the prospect of winning a fortune onthe football pools attracts millions of people andsustains the optimism of many working-class folkin adverse circumstances. In the seventeenthcentury gambling diverted the attention of thelabouring poor from the possibilities of self-helpand political activism, by holding out the prospectthat a lucky person would be able to better himselfdespite the inequities of the social system. Mengambled on cards, dice, horses, foot-races, bear-baiting, cock-ɹghting, and a host of similarpastimes.

Just as the Hebrew priests of the OldTestament endeavoured to confound the devoteesof Baal by challenging them publicly to performsupernatural acts, so the Apostles of the earlyChurch attracted followers by working miraclesand performing supernatural cures. Both the NewTestament and the literature of the patristic periodtestify to the importance of these activities in thework of conversion; and the ability to performmiracles soon became an indispensable test ofsanctity. The claim to supernatural power was anessential element in the Anglo-Saxon Church's ɹghtagainst paganism, and missionaries did not fail tostress the superiority of Christian prayers toheathen charms.1The medieval Church thus found itself saddledwith the tradition that the working of miracles wasthe most eɽcacious means of demonstrating itsmonopoly of the truth. By the twelfth andthirteenth centuries the Lives of the Saints had"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"assumed a stereotyped pattern. They related themiraculous achievements of holy men, and stressedhow they could prophesy the future, control theweather, provide protection against ɹre and ɻood,magically transport heavy objects, and bring reliefto the sick. Many of these stories were retold inThe Golden Legend, a popular compilation by athirteenth-century Archbishop of Genoa, which wasto be translated by Caxton in 1483 and reissued inEngland at least seven times before theReformation.2On the eve of the Reformation the Church didnot as an institution claim the power to workmiracles. But it reaped prestige from the doings ofthose of its members to whom God was deemed tohave extended miraculous gifts. It stressed that thesaints were only intercessors whose entreatiesmight go unheeded, but it readily countenancedthe innumerable prayers oʃered to them on moreoptimistic assumptions. The shrines of the saints atGlastonbury, Lindisfarne, Walsingham,Canterbury, Westminster, St Albans and similarholy places had become objects of pilgrimage towhich the sick and inɹrm made long and wearyjourneys in the conɹdent expectation of obtaining"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"a supernatural cure.

Who dare denySt Anthony a ɻeece of wool for fear of his terriblefire, or lest he send the pox among our sheep?’5The worship of saints was an integral part of thefabric of medieval society and was sustained byimportant social considerations. Individualchurches had their own patron saints, and strongterritorial associations could give hagiolatry analmost totemic character: ‘Of all Our Ladies,’ saysa character in one of Thomas More's writings, ‘Ilove best Our Lady of Walsingham’, ‘“and I”, saiththe other, “Our Lady of Ipswich.” ’6 Pilgrimsbrought money into the community and theinhabitants grew dependent upon them: inElizabethan times, for example, it was pointed outthat St Wistan's church in Leicestershire hadpreviously been maintained by the proceeds of theannual pilgrimage.7 Every medieval trade had thepatronage of its own especial saint, who was"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"corporately worshipped, and whose holy day hadstrong occupational affiliations:Our painters had Luke, our weavers had Steven,our millers had Arnold, our tailors had Goodman,our sowters [cobblers] had Crispin, our potters hadS.

By the early Middle Ages theecclesiastical authorities had developed acomprehensive range of formulae designed todraw down God's practical blessing upon secularactivities. The basic ritual was the benediction ofsalt and water for the health of the body and theexpulsion of evil spirits. But the liturgical books ofthe time also contained rituals devised to blesshouses, cattle, crops, ships, tools, armour, wellsand kilns. There were formulae for blessing menwho were preparing to set oʃ on a journey, toɹght a duel, to engage in battle or to move into anew house. There were procedures for blessing thesick and for dealing with sterile animals, fordriving away thunder and for making themarriage bed fruitful. Such rituals usually involvedthe presence of a priest and the employment ofholy water and the sign of the cross. Basic to thewhole procedure was the idea of exorcism, theformal conjuring of the devil out of some material"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"object by the pronunciation of prayers and theinvocation of God's name.13 Holy water, thusexorcised, could be used to drive away evil spiritsand pestilential vapours. It was a remedy againstdisease and sterility, and an instrument forblessing houses and food; though whether itworked automatically, or only if the oɽciatingpriest was of suɽcient personal holiness, was amatter of theological dispute.Theologians did not claim that these proceduresmade the practical precautions of daily lifesuperɻuous, but they did undoubtedly regard themas possessing a power which was more thanmerely spiritual or symbolic. The formula forconsecrating the holy bread, given away to thelaity on Sundays in lieu of the eucharist, called onGod to bless the bread, ‘so that all who consume itshall receive health of body as well as of soul’.14 Itwas regarded as a medicine for the sick and apreservative against the plague.As for holy water, there were some theologianswho thought it superstitious to drink it as a remedyfor sickness or to scatter it on the ɹelds forfertility; but the orthodox view, ɹrmly based uponthe words of the benediction, was that there was"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"nothing improper about such actions, providedthey were performed out of genuine Christianfaith.15 Periodically, therefore, the holy watercarrier went round the parish so that the piouscould sprinkle their homes, their ɹelds and theirdomestic animals. As late as 1543, when a stormburst over Canterbury, the inhabitants ran tochurch for holy water to sprinkle in their houses,so as to drive away the evil spirits in the air, andt o protect their property against lightning. Atabout the same date the vicar of Bethersden, Kent,could advise a sick parishioner to drink holy wateras a help to her recovery.16 In the seventeenthcentury Jeremy Taylor lamented of the Irish that‘although not so much as a chicken is nowadayscured of the pip by holy water, yet upon alloccasions they use it, and the common peoplethrow it upon children's cradles, and sick cows'horns, and upon them that are blasted, and if theyrecover by any means, it is imputed to the holywater’.17 The Devil, it was agreed, was allergic toholy water, and wherever his inɻuence wassuspected it was an appropriate remedy. In thereign of Elizabeth I, Widow Wiseman, later aCatholic martyr, threw holy water at her"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"persecutor, Topcliʃe, whose horse thereupon ɻunghim to the ground. Topcliʃe raged against her,‘calling her an old witch, who by her charms hadmade his horse to lay him on the ground, but[relates the Catholic source for this episode] shewith good reason laughed to see that holy waterhad given him so ɹne a fall’.18 Here, as Protestantcommentators were to urge, the distinctionbetween magic and religion was an impossiblyfine one.The same was true of the numerous ecclesiasticaltalismans and amulets whose use the Churchencouraged. As one Protestant versifier wrote:About these Catholics' necks and hands arealways hanging charms, That serve againstall miseries and all unhappy harms.19Theologians held that there was no superstitionabout wearing a piece of paper or medal inscribedwith verses from the gospels or with the sign of thecross, provided no non-Christian symbols werealso employed.20 The most common of theseamulets was the agnus dei, a small wax cake,"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"originally made out of paschal candles and blessedby the Pope, bearing the image of the lamb andɻag. This was intended to serve as a defenceagainst the assaults of the Devil and as apreservative against thunder, lightning, ɹre,drowning, death in child-bed and similar dangers.After the Reformation Bishop Hall commented onthe survival of the associated belief in theprotective power of St John's Gospel, ‘printed in asmall roundel and sold to the credulous ignorantswith this fond warrant, that whosoever carries itabout with him shall be free from the dangers ofthe day's mishaps’.21 In the seventeenth centuryrosaries were similarly blessed as a protectionagainst fire, tempest, fever and evil spirits.22The same preservative power was attributed toholy relics: in 1591, for example, John Allyn, anOxford recusant, was said to possess a quantity ofChrist's blood, which he sold at twenty pounds adrop: those who had it about them would be freefrom bodily harm.23 The sign of the cross was alsoemployed to ward oʃ evil spirits and otherdangers. In North Wales it was reported in 1589that people still crossed themselves when they shuttheir windows, when they left their cattle, and"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"when they went out of their houses in themorning. If any misfortune befell them or theiranimals their common saying was ‘You have notcrossed yourself well today’, or ‘You have notmade the sign of the rood upon the cattle’, on theassumption that this omission had been the causeof their mishap.24Ecclesiastical preservatives of this kind wereintended to give protection in a wide variety ofcontexts. The consecration of church bells madethem eɽcacious against evil spirits and henceenabled them to dispel the thunder and lightningfor which demons were believed to be responsible.When a tempest broke out the bells would be rungin an eʃort to check the storm: this happened atSandwich, for example, in ‘the great thundering’ of1502, and again in 1514.25 Alternatively, onecould invoke St Barbara against thunder, or tie acharm to the building one wished to protect –though an agnus dei failed to save St Albans Abbeyfrom being struck by lightning in the thirteenthcentury.26 As a protection against ɹre there were‘St Agatha's letters’, an inscription placed on tiles,bells or amulets. Fasting on St Mark's day wasanother means of gaining protection; or one could"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"appeal to St Clement or to the Irish saintColumbkille.27 In 1180 the holy shrine of StWerberga was carried round Chester andmiraculously preserved the city from destructionby ɹre.28 In addition, there were exorcisms tomake the ɹelds fertile; holy candles to protectfarm animals; and formal curses to drive awaycaterpillars and rats and to kill weeds. At thedissolution of the Abbey of Bury St Edmunds therewere discovered ‘relics for rain, and certain othersuperstitious usages for avoiding of weeds growingin corn’.29The medieval Church thus acted as a repositoryof supernatural power which could be dispensed tothe faithful to help them in their daily problems. Itwas inevitable that the priests, set apart from therest of the community by their celibacy and ritualconsecration, should have derived an extra cachetfrom their position as mediators between man andGod. It was also inevitable that around the Church,the clergy and their holy apparatus there clustereda horde of popular superstitions, which endowedreligious objects with a magical power to whichtheologians themselves had never laid claim. Ascapular, or friar's coat, for example, was a"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"coveted object to be worn as a preservativeagainst pestilence or the ague, and even to beburied in as a short cut to salvation: Bishop HughLatimer confessed that he used to think that if hebecame a friar it would be impossible for him to bedamned.30 The church and churchyard alsoenjoyed a special power in popular estimation,primarily because of the ritual consecration of thesite with salt and water. The key of the churchdoor was said to be an eɽcacious remedy againsta mad dog;31 the soil from the churchyard wascredited with special magical power; and anycrime committed on holy ground became analtogether more heinous aʃair, simply because ofthe place where it had occurred. This wasrecognised by a statute of the reign of Edward VIimposing special penalties for such oʃences; if theconsecrated area were polluted by some crime ofviolence a special act of reconciliation wasnecessary before it could be used again forreligious purposes.32 Even the coins in theoʃertory were accredited with magical value;there were numerous popular superstitions aboutthe magical value of communion silver as a curefor illness or a lucky charm against danger."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"But it was above all in connection with thesacraments of the Church that such beliefs arose.The Mass, in particular, was associated withmagical power and for this, it must be said, theteaching of the Church was at least indirectlyresponsible. During the long history of theChristian Church the sacrament of the altar hadundergone a process of theologicalreinterpretation. By the later Middle Ages thegeneral eʃect had been to shift the emphasis awayfrom the communion of the faithful, and to place itupon the formal consecration of the elements bythe priest. The ceremony thus acquired in thepopular mind a mechanical eɽcacy in which theoperative factor was not the participation of thecongregation, who had become virtual spectators,but the special power of the priest. Hence thedoctrine that the laity could beneɹt from beingpresent at the celebration even though they couldnot understand the proceedings. If too ignorant tofollow a private mass book, they were encouragedto recite whatever prayers they knew; so thatduring the Mass the priest and people in factpursued diʃerent modes of devotion. The ritualwas said, in a notorious phrase, to work ‘like acharm upon an adder’.33 In the actual miracle of"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"transubstantiation the ‘instrumental cause’ was theformula of consecration. Theologians reɹned thisdoctrine considerably, but their subtleties were toocomplicated to be understood by ordinary men.34What stood out was the magical notion that themere pronunciation of words in a ritual mannercould eʃect a change in the character of materialobjects.The reservation of the sacrament at the altar asan object of devotion had become customary inEngland by the thirteenth century and the elementof mystery attaching to it was enhanced by theconstruction in the later Middle Ages of enclosedsanctuaries to protect the elements from the gazeof the public. Literalism generated anecdotes ofhow the Host had turned into ɻesh and blood,even into a child.35 The notion spread thattemporal beneɹts might be expected from its merecontemplation, and the belief was enhanced by thereadiness of the Church to multiply the secularoccasions for which masses might be performed asa means of propitiation. There were masses for thesick and for women in labour, masses for goodweather and for safe journeys, masses against theplague and other epidemics. The Sarum Missal of"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"1532 contained a special mass for the avoidance ofsudden death.36 In 1516 the Priory of Holy Crossat Colchester received a grant of land, in returnfor the celebration of a solemn mass ‘for thefurther prosperity of the town’.37 It was commonto attach special value to the performance of acertain number of masses in succession – ɹve,seven, nine or thirty (a trental). The ceremonycould even be perverted into a maleɹcent act bycausing masses for the dead to be celebrated forpersons still alive, in order to hasten their demise.The ɹfteenth-century treatise Dives and Pauperinveighed against thosethat for hate or wrath that they bear against anyman or woman take away the clothes of the altar,and clothe the altar with doleful clothing, or besetthe altar or the cross about with thorns, andwithdraw light out of the church or... do sing massof requiem for them that be alive, in hope thatthey should fare the worse and the sooner die.38The clear implication was that the clergythemselves were sometimes involved in theseperversions."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"A plethora of sub-superstitions thus accumulatedaround the sacrament of the altar. The clergy'sanxiety that none of the consecrated elementsshould be wasted or accidentally dropped on theɻoor encouraged the idea that the Host was anobject of supernatural potency. The oɽciatingpriest was required to swallow the remainingcontents of the chalice, ɻies and all if need be, andto ensure that not a crumb of the consecratedwafer was left behind.39 The communicant whodid not swallow the bread, but carried it awayfrom the church in his mouth, was widely believedto be in possession of an impressive source ofmagical power. He could use it to cure the blind orthe feverish; he could carry it around with him as ageneral protection against ill fortune, or he couldbeat it up into a powder and sprinkle it over hisgarden as a charm against caterpillars. Medievalstories relate how the Host was profanelyemployed to put out ɹres, to cure swine fever, tofertilize the ɹelds and to encourage bees to makehoney. The thief could also convert it into a love-charm or use it for some maleɹcent purpose. Somebelieved that a criminal who swallowed the Hostwould be immune from discovery; others held thatby simultaneously communicating with a woman"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"one could gain her aʃections.40 In the sixteenthcentury John Bale complained that the Mass hadbecome a remedy for the diseases of man andbeast. It was employed by ‘witches... sorcerers,charmers, enchanters, dreamers, soothsayers,necromancers, conjurers, cross-diggers, devil-raisers, miracle-doers, dog-leeches and bawds’. Theɹrst Edwardian Prayer Book accordingly insistedthat the bread should be placed by the oɽciatingminister direct in the communicant's mouth,because in past times people had often carried thesacrament away and ‘kept it with them anddiversely abused it, to superstition andwickedness’.41It was because of this magical power thought toreside in consecrated objects that ecclesiasticalauthorities had long found it necessary to takeelaborate precautions against theft. The LateranCouncil of 1215 had ruled that the eucharist andthe holy oil should be kept under lock and key,and the later medieval English Church showed akeen interest in enforcing this stipulation. As lateas 1557, for example, Cardinal Pole, in hisInjunctions for Cambridge University, insisted thatthe font should be locked up, so as to prevent the"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"theft of holy water.42 Thefts of the Host areknown to have occurred periodically – three werereported in London in 1532 – and communionbread continued to be employed illegitimately formagical purposes in the post-Reformation era:James Device, one of the Lancashire witches of1612, was told by his grandmother, Old Demdike,to present himself for communion and bring homethe bread.43Many of these superstitions, however, did notrequire anything so dramatic as the theft of theHost from the altar. Mere attendance at Massmight secure temporal beneɹts. In his Instructionsfor Parish Priests John Myrc, the fourteenth-centuryAustin Canon of Lilleshall, claimed the authority ofSt Augustine for the view that anyone who saw apriest bearing the Host would not lack meat ordrink for the rest of that day, nor be in any dangerof sudden death or blindness.44 ‘Thousands,’ wroteWilliam Tyndale in the early sixteenth century,believed that, if they crossed themselves when thepriest was reading St John's Gospel, no mischancewould happen to them that day.45 The Mass couldalso be a means of prognosticating the future or ofgaining success in some projected venture. The"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"clergy disseminated stories of the miraculousbeneɹts which had been known to spring fromcommunicating, and of the disastrousconsequences which participation in the ceremonymight have for the unworthy communicant.46 Inthe Communion Service in the Prayer Book of1549 the curate was required to warn thecongregation that anyone who receivedunworthily did so to his own damnation, bothspiritual and temporal, for in this way ‘we kindleGod's wrath over us; we provoke him to plague uswith divers diseases and sundry kinds of death’. Inthe seventeenth century the Catholic Church wasnoted by an intelligent observer to teach that theMass might still be eɽcacious for ‘safe-journeyingby sea or land, on horseback or on foot; forwomen that are barren, big, or bringing forth; forfevers and toothaches; for hogs and hens; forrecovery of lost goods and the like’.47Like the Mass, the other Christian sacraments allgenerated a corpus of parasitic beliefs, whichattributed to each ceremony a materialsigniɹcance which the leaders of the Church hadnever claimed.

The Church taught that the ceremony wasabsolutely necessary for salvation and thatchildren who died unbaptized were usuallyconsigned to limbo, where they would beperpetually denied sight of the vision of God andeven, according to some theologians, subjected tothe torments of the damned.48 At the baptismalceremony the child was, therefore, exorcised (withthe obvious implication that it had previously beenpossessed by the Devil), anointed with chrism(consecrated oil and balsam) and signed with thecross in holy water. Around its head was bound awhite cloth (chrisom), in which it would be buriedif it should die in infancy.The social signiɹcance of the baptismalceremony as the formal reception of the child into"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"the community is obvious enough, and it is notsurprising that greater meaning should have beenattached to the ceremony than the Church allowed.Even in the early twentieth century it was believedin some rural communities that children ‘came onbetter’ after being christened. In the later MiddleAges it was common to regard baptism as anessential rite if the child were physically to surviveat all, and there were stories about blind childrenwhose sight had been restored by baptism. Sundrysuperstitions related to the day on which theceremony should take place, the sort of waterwhich should be used, and the qualiɹcations of thegodparents. There were also attempts to apply therite in inappropriate contexts, for example, bybaptising the caul in which the infant was born, orby exorcising the mother when she was inlabour.49 Particularly common was the idea thatanimals might beneɹt from the ceremony. It ispossible that some of the numerous cases recordedin the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries ofattempts to baptize dogs, cats, sheep and horses50may not have arisen from drunkenness or Puritanmockery of Anglican ceremonies, but havereɻected the old superstition that the ritual had"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"about it a physical eɽcacy which could be directedto any living creature.Very similar ideas surrounded the ceremony ofconɹrmation. This rite had originally beencombined with that of baptism as one integratedceremony of Christian initiation. But by the earlyMiddle Ages the two rituals had drawn apart,though conɹrmation was still expected to takeplace when the child was very young. Variousmaximum ages, ranging from one year to seven,were prescribed by English bishops in thethirteenth century; and, although a minimum ageof seven came to be thought appropriate, thecustom was slow to establish itself: Elizabeth,daughter of Henry VIII, was baptized andconɹrmed at the age of three days. Only in themid sixteenth century did the Council of Trentrequire the child to be approaching years ofdiscretion and capable of rehearsing the elementsof his belief.51 At the conɹrmation ceremony thebishop would lay his hands on the child and tiearound its forehead a linen band which he wasrequired to wear for three days afterwards. Thiswas believed to strengthen him against theassaults of the ɹend, and the notion became"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"current that it was extremely bad luck to untie theband under any circumstances. Here too physicaleʃects were vulgarly attributed to the ceremony: abelief which survived until the nineteenth century,as evidenced by the case of the old Norfolk womanwho claimed to have been ‘bishopped’ seven times,because she found it helped her rheumatism.52Another ecclesiastical ritual with a strong socialsigniɹcance was the churching, or puriɹcation, ofwomen after childbirth, representing as it didsociety's recognition of the woman's new role asmother, and her resumption of sexual relationswith her husband after a period of ritual seclusionand avoidance. Extreme Protestant reformers werelater to regard it as one of the most obnoxiousPopish survivals in the Anglican Church, butmedieval churchmen had also devoted a good dealof energy to refuting such popular superstitions asthe belief that it was improper for the mother toemerge from her house, or to look at the sky or theearth before she had been puriɹed. The Churchchose to treat the ceremony as one of thanksgivingfor a safe deliverance, and was reluctant tocountenance any prescribed interval after birthbefore it could take place. Nor did it accept that"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"the woman should stay indoors until she had beenchurched. Like the Sarum Manual, Dives and Pauperstressed that unpuriɹed women might enter churchwhenever they wished, and that ‘they that callthem heathen women for the time that they lie inbe fools and sin... full grievously’. But for peopleat large churching was indubitably a ritual ofpuriɹcation closely linked to its Jewishpredecessor.53Radical Protestants were later to blame theceremony itself, which ‘breedeth and nourishethmany superstitious opinions in the simple people'shearts; as that the woman which hath born a childis unclean and unholy’.54 But a fairer view wouldhave been to regard the ritual as the result of suchopinions, rather than the cause. Virginity, or atleast abstinence from sexual intercourse, was stilla generally accepted condition of holiness; andthere were many medieval precedents for theattitude of the Laudian Vicar of Great Totham,Essex, who refused communion to menstruatingwomen and those who had had sexual intercourseon the previous night.55 Such prejudices may havebeen reinforced by the all-male character of theChurch and its insistence on celibacy, but they are"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"too universal in primitive societies to be regardedas the mere creation of medieval religion. Theceremony of the churching of women took on asemi-magical signiɹcance in popular estimation;hence the belief, which the Church vainlyattempted to scotch, that a woman who died inchild-bed before being churched should be refusedChristian burial.56 The idea of puriɹcationsurvived the Reformation; even at the end of theseventeenth century it was reported from parts ofWales that ‘the ordinary women are hardlybrought to look upon churching otherwise than asa charm to prevent witchcraft, and think that grasswill hardly ever grow where they tread before theyare churched’.57It is hardly necessary to detail the alliedsuperstitions which attached themselves to theceremony of marriage. Most of them taught thatthe fate of the alliance could be adversely aʃectedby the breach of a large number of ritualrequirements relating to the time and place of theceremony, the dress of the bride, and so forth.Typical was the notion that the wedding ringwould constitute an eʃective recipe againstunkindness and discord, so long as the bride"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"continued to wear it.58 Such notions provide afurther demonstration of how every sacrament ofthe Church tended to generate its attendant sub-superstitions which endowed the spiritual formulaeof the theologians with a crudely material efficacy.This tendency was perhaps less apparent in thevarious rituals accompanying the burial of thedead, such as the convention that the corpseshould face East or that the funeral should beaccompanied by doles to the poor. Importantthough such observances were in popularestimation, they related primarily to the spiritualwelfare of the soul of the deceased, and wereseldom credited with any direct impact upon thewelfare of the living, save in so far as a ghost whocould not rest quietly might return to trouble thedead man's survivors.59 Funeral customs are worthstudying for the manner in which they helped toease the social adjustments necessary toaccommodate the fact of death, but by their verynature they do not testify in the same way as theother rites of passage to the extent of popularbelief in the material effects of ecclesiastical ritual.Before a man died, however, he was extendedthe last of the seven sacraments, extreme unction,"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"whereby the recipient was anointed with holy oiland tendered the viaticum. In the eyes of everyonethis was a dreadful ritual, and from Anglo-Saxontimes there had been a deep conviction that toreceive the viaticum was a virtual death sentencewhich would make subsequent recoveryimpossible. The medieval Church found itnecessary to denounce the superstition thatrecipients of extreme unction who subsequentlygot better should refrain from eating meat, goingbarefoot, or having intercourse with their wives.60It may have been in an attempt to counter thisfear that the leaders of the Church chose to stressthe possibility that extreme unction mightpositively assist the patient's recovery, provided hehad suɽcient faith. The Council of Trentemphasized that the ceremony could boost therecipient's will to live, and Bishop Bonner wrote in1555 that:Although in our wicked time small is the number ofthem that do escape death, having received thissacrament... yet that is not to be ascribed unto thelack or fault of this sacrament, but rather unto thewant and lack of steadfast and constant faith,"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"which ought to be in those that shall have thissacrament ministered unto them; by which strongfaith the power of almighty God in the primitivechurch did work mightily and eʃectually in sickpersons anointed.61This was to link unction to the Church's other ritesof blessing and anointing the sick to which it wasclosely related, and in which the intentions hadbeen curative rather than merely symbolic.62 Assuch it represents a ɹnal manifestation of thephysical signiɹcance which the sacraments of theChurch were so widely believed to possess.Next to the sacraments as a means of access todivine assistance came the prayers of the faithful.Such prayer took many forms, but the kind mostdirectly related to temporal problems was that ofintercession, whereby God was called upon toprovide both guidance along the path to salvation,and help with more material diɽculties.

In1289 the Bishop of Chichester ruled that it was theduty of every priest to order processions andprayers when he saw a storm was imminent,without waiting for orders from above.63This belief that earthly events could beinɻuenced by supernatural intervention was not initself a magical one.

TheChurch's teaching was usually unambiguous on thispoint: prayers might bring practical results, butthey could not be guaranteed to do so.In practice, however, the distinction wasrepeatedly blurred in the popular mind. TheChurch itself recommended the use of prayerswhen healing the sick or gathering medicinalherbs. Confessors required penitents to repeat astated number of Paternosters, Aves and Creeds,thereby fostering the notion that the recitation ofprayers in a foreign tongue had a mechanicaleɽcacy.

It therefore became worthwhile to secureother people to oʃer up prayers on one's ownbehalf. In the reign of Henry VIII the Marchionessof Exeter paid twenty shillings to Elizabeth Barton,the Nun of Kent, to pray that she would not loseher next child in childbirth, and that her husbandwould come home safely from the wars.66 SirThomas More told of a friar in Coventry whodeclared that anyone who said his rosary once aday would be saved. The Enchiridion of SalisburyCathedral contained a formula with the rubric:‘Whosoever sayeth this prayer following in theworship of God and St Rock shall not die of thepestilence by the grace of God.’ The Catholics, saidJeremy Taylor, taught ‘that prayers themselves exopere operato... do prevail’, and ‘like the words ofa charmer they prevail even when they are notunderstood’.67"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The medieval Church thus did a great deal toweaken the fundamental distinction between aprayer and a charm, and to encourage the ideathat there was virtue in the mere repetition of holywords.

The rural magicians ofTudor England did not invent their own charms:they inherited them from the medieval Church, andtheir formulae and rituals were largely derivativeproducts of centuries of Catholic teaching. For, inaddition to the prayers oɽcially countenanced,there was a large undergrowth of semi-Christiancharms which drew heavily on ecclesiasticalformulae. The following extract from thecommonplace-book of Robert Reynys, a ɹfteenth-century church reeve at Acle, Norfolk, is typical:Pope Innocent hath granted to any man thatbeareth the length of the three nails of Our LordJesus Christ upon him and worship them dailywith ɹve Paternosters and ɹve Aves and a psalter,he shall have seven gifts granted to him.

This was apparently no exaggeration: in1543 Joanna Meriwether of Canterbury, ‘for thedispleasure that she bore towards a young maidnamed Elizabeth Celsay and her mother, made aɹre upon the dung of the said Elizabeth; and tooka holy candle and dropt upon the said dung.

A sailor in peril of shipwreck mightvow candles to a shrine or assert his readiness toundertake an arduous pilgrimage should he escapehis present danger.75 In the seventeenth centurywomen could still emulate the example of Hannahby solemnly vowing to dedicate their children to areligious career if only their barrenness could beterminated.76 The ritual condition of fasting wasalso thought eɽcacious. By the ɹfteenth centurythe belief had arisen that one could avoid suddendeath by fasting all the year round on the day ofthe week on which the Feast of the Annunciationhappened to occur. Conversely, there were the‘black-fasts’, designed to secure the death of anenemy.77A further example of the supernatural powerthought to be at the disposal of the medievalChurch is provided by the religious sanctions"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"employed in the administration of justice. Thestandard method of inducing a witness to givehonest testimony was to require him to swear asolemn oath as to the truth of his evidence.

The force of such anoath might be further enhanced by requiring that itbe taken on some sacred object – a Bible, or arelic. The holy taper of Cardigan Priory, forexample, was ‘used of men to swear by in diɽcultand hard matters’, and it proved a useful source ofrevenue to the monks. A note on the eleventh-century Red Book of Derby asserts that ‘it wascommonly believed that who should swear untrulyupon this book should run mad’. The sixteenth-century Irish made similar use of St Patrick's staʃ,believing that to perjure oneself on this holy objectwould provoke an even worse punishment than ifthe oath had been sworn on the gospels.

From the very start, theenemies of Roman Catholicism fastened upon themagical implications which they saw to beinherent in some fundamental aspects of theChurch's ritual. The ultra-Protestant position wasɹrmly stated as early as 1395 by the Lollards intheir Twelve Conclusions:That exorcisms and hallowings, made in theChurch, of wine, bread, and wax, water, salt andoil and incense, the stone of the altar, uponvestments, mitre, cross, and pilgrims' staves, be thevery practice of necromancy, rather than of theholy theology.

That this was not thecase showed that it was unreasonable and impiousto expect God to assist at a ceremony designed togive ordinary water the power to bring health ofmind and body, to expel spirits, or drive awaypestilence. Holy water, in fact, had no more virtuethan well-water or river-water.2 Neither did holybread possess any new quality merely because anincantation had been pronounced over it.3 Similarobjections were made to the consecration of churchbells against tempests, and the wearing of wordsof scripture as a protection against danger.4 Suchoperations were sheer necromancy, a spuriousattribution of eʃective virtue to the mereenunciation of words, a hopeless attempt to endowobjects with a power and strength exceeding theirnatural qualities.

Both thoughttheir spells more eʃective when pronounced inone place and at one time rather than another;both turned to the East to say them; and boththought that mere words could possess a magicalvirtue.5This attitude, which was common to most of thediʃering opinions usually bracketed together as‘Lollardy’, thus involved a sweeping denial of theChurch's claim to manipulate any aspects of God'ssupernatural power. Ecclesiastical blessings,exorcisms, conjurations and hallowings had noeʃect. Neither did the curses which the clergychose to call down upon lay oʃenders. Either suchdelinquents had broken God's law, in which caseGod had already cursed them himself; or they hadnot, in which case the Church's curse could be of noavail.6 Early Protestantism thus denied the magicof the opus operatum, the claim that the Church hadinstrumental power and had been endowed byChrist with an active share in his work and oɽce.For a human authority to claim the power to workmiracles was blasphemy – a challenge to God'somnipotence. ‘For, if ye may make at yourpleasure such things to drive devils away and to"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"heal both body and soul, what need have ye ofChrist?’7This theme was taken up with some relish duringthe Tudor Reformation, when the denial of theeɽcacy of the Catholic rituals of consecration andexorcism became central to the Protestant attack.Who were ‘the vilest witches and sorcerers of theearth’, demanded James Calfhill, if not ‘the prieststhat consecrate crosses and ashes, water and salt,oil and cream, boughs and bones, stocks andstones; that christen bells that hang in the steeple;that conjure worms that creep in the ɹeld; thatgive St John's Gospel to hang about men's necks?’How could the ‘conjuration’ of the agnus dei, askedBishop Jewel, endow it with the power to preserveits wearer from lightning and tempest? Of whatavail was a mere piece of wax against a storm sentby God? As for St Agatha's letters, the holy remedyagainst burning houses, they were, declared BishopPilkington, sheer sorcery, and the use ofconsecrated bells in a thunder-storm mere‘witchcrafts’.8 In a similar manner were dismissedthe sign of the cross,9 the relics of the saints, andthe whole apparatus of Catholic magic.

Instead,their prescriptions for the communion service werespecially designed to eliminate any ground for theancient superstitions. The 1552 Prayer Bookspeciɹed that ordinary bread should be used forthe communion service, in place of the specialunleavened wafers of the Catholic past.

Similarly, ‘other rites, as ofmarriage, of extreme unction, of visitation of thesick, of consecrating churches and churchyards,and the like’, were not ‘exempt from charms;inasmuch as there is in them the use of enchantedoil and water, with the abuse of the cross, and ofthe holy word of David, asperges me Dominehyssopo, as things of eɽcacy to drive awayphantasms, and imaginary spirits’.14"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"It was in accordance with this attitude that allthe sacraments of the Church had been scrutinizedby the early Protestants for any magicalaɽliations they might possess.

The exorcism was droppedfrom the second Edwardian Prayer Book, becauseof its implication that un-baptised infants weredemoniacs, and so were the anointing and thechrisom. Nevertheless, the rite retained a statuswhich was more than merely symbolic. The fate ofinfants who died before baptism was stillcontroversial. The ɹrst Prayer Book stressed theneed for baptism within the ɹrst days of life andits Elizabethan successor emphasised the urgencyof the matter by permitting it on days other thanSundays and holidays in cases of ‘necessity’. MostElizabethan theologians denied the Tridentinedoctrine that baptism was absolutely necessary forsalvation, but they still regarded it as ‘formally’necessary.

The Presbyterian Directoryof Public Worship (1644) omitted the sign of thecross, along with the requirement that the fontshould be placed in a special position near thechurch door. The minister was further required toremind the congregation that baptism was not sonecessary that an infant might be damned forwant of it. Such stipulations did something to playdown the importance of the ceremony as a rite ofpassage; a tendency which the sectarian demandfor the abolition of infant baptism was to take toits logical conclusion. Yet some of the earlyseparatists who had rejected infant baptismreturned to the Church of England when theybecame parents, lest their children should diebefore they were christened;17 and in nineteenth-century Dorset some country-folk had theirchildren speedily baptized, because ‘theyunderstood that if a child died without a name he"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"did ɻit about in the woods and waste places andcould get no rest’. In modern Britain there aremany otherwise non-religious people who think itunlucky not to be baptized.18Conɹrmation, which had already been attackedby the Lollards, was even more sweepinglydismissed by some reformers as nothing ‘but plainsorcery, devilry, witchcraft, juggling, legerdemain,and all that naught is. The bishop mumbleth a fewLatin words over the child, charmeth him, crossethhim, smeareth him with stinking popish oil, andtieth a linen band about the child's neck andsendeth him home.’19 The Church of Englanddenied the sacramental character of the ceremonyand discarded the holy oil and linen band. It alsomade concessions to those who thought that themedieval Church had conɹrmed children tooyoung, by requiring that no one be admitted to therite until he had learned to say the Creed, theLord's Prayer and the Decalogue, and to answerquestions in the Catechism.

Indeedthe subsequent raising of the age at which childrenare expected to undergo it to fourteen or so hasgiven it a more pronounced role as a rite ofpassage marking the arrival of ‘social’ puberty.21Nevertheless the Protestant attack onsacramental magic had severely eroded the ritualof the established Church. Of the seven sacramentsof the Catholic Church (baptism, conɹrmation,marriage, the Mass, ordination, penance, extremeunction), only baptism and the eucharist retainedtheir undoubted sacramental character, and eventhese had been considerably reduced insigniɹcance. The Lollard view that marriage in achurch was unnecessary22 reappeared in thesectarian concept of civil marriage as a privatecontract, though it did not gain full legalrecognition until 1833.

The anointingof the invalid was omitted in the ritual for theVisitation of the Sick prescribed by the secondEdwardian Prayer Book; and the belief thatconsecrated bells could drive away devils wasgiven up, along with faith in the wonder-workingpower of holy candles and the sign of the cross. Bythe end of the sixteenth century there wassubstantial acceptance for the extreme Protestantview that no mere ceremony could have anymaterial eɽcacy, and that divine grace could notbe conjured or coerced by any human formula.‘The sacraments,’ said the separatist John Canne,‘were not ordained of God to be used... as charmsand sorceries.’24Another delicate subject was the consecration ofchurches. The whole notion of consecrated groundhad been violently attacked by the Lollards25 andthere can be no doubt that it would have beenabandoned if the Edwardian reformers had hadtheir way. John Scory, preaching at Faversham in1542, denounced the dedication of the churches asa superstitious ceremony, invented for the proɹt ofthe bishops. If it were really necessary to conjurethe devil out of bricks and mortar, he argued, it"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"was surprising that any man's house was ɹt to livein. Most of his Protestant contemporaries wouldhave agreed that a church was ‘made a holy place,not by superstitious words of magicalenchantment; not by making of signs andcharacters in stone; but by the will of God and...godly use’.26 Bishop Ridley accordingly forbadethe hallowing of altars; and no ceremony for theconsecration of churches was included in theElizabethan Prayer Book. Only at the end of thesixteenth century did such formulae creep back.They were a prominent feature of the Laudianrevival, and came to be accepted even bymoderate Anglicans.27Meanwhile, the Elizabethan separatist HenryBarrow pointed out the magical notions implicit inthe whole structure of existing church buildings. Attheir foundation, he observed,the ɹrst stone must be laid by the hands of thebishop or his suʃragan, with certain magicalprayers, and holy water, and many otheridolatrous rites...

Thus I thinkcan be no doubt made, but that the very erectionsof these synagogues (whether they were byheathens or papists) were idolatrous.The sectarian conclusion, therefore, was that thearrangement of the very stones of church buildingswas so inherently superstitious that there wasnothing for it but to level the whole lot to theground and begin again.

The idolatrousshape so cleaveth to every stone, as it by no meanscan be severed from them whiles there is a stoneleft standing upon a stone.28It thus became a commonplace for religiousnonconformists to declare their indiʃerence orcontempt for consecrated places. Like their Lollardpredecessors, the separatists boggled at the idea ofburying the dead on consecrated soil, and deniedthat prayers oʃered up on holy ground were anymore likely to prevail. In 1582 Elizabeth Jones ofCheltenham declared that she could serve God inthe ɹelds as well as in church.

In 1547 theRoyal Injunctions put a stop to the religiousprocessions traditionally held at times of specialneed. This step was said at first to have been takenbecause of the strife for precedence and generaldisorder which marked these occasions. Butultimately processions were admitted to besuperɻuous: prayer was just as eʃective if oʃeredup, less ostentatiously, within the church building.One procession alone was retained: the annualperambulation of the parish in Rogation week.This was the sole survivor of the many medievalceremonies which had been conducted in the opento secure fertility and good weather: blessing thetrees on the Twelfth Day after Christmas, readinggospels to the springs to make their water purer,and the blessing of the corn by the young men andmaids after they had received the sacrament onPalm Sunday.43 The medieval Litanies orRogations (major on St Mark's Day (25 April), andminor on the three days before Ascension Day)derived from earlier pagan ceremonies, and hadbeen designed to combat war, illness, violentdeath and other non-agricultural terrors.

The curatewas not to wear a surplice and there was to be nocarrying of banners or stopping at waysidecrosses. The ceremony, as Bishop Grindal stressed,was ‘not a procession but a perambulation’.44The perambulation was thus intended to makesure that the parish boundaries had not beenencroached upon during the course of the year;and also to oʃer prayers for good weather and asuccessful harvest.

Crosses weresometimes cut on tree trunks to mark where thegospel used to be read. At Standlake, Oxfordshire,the parson used to read it at the barrel's head inthe cellar of the Chequers Inn, allegedly the site ofthe original cross. Indeed the medieval practice ofreading the gospels in the corn ɹelds survived insome areas until the Civil War, even though theperambulation was supposed to limit itself to theparochial boundaries. Most parishes had theiridiosyncratic customs about refreshment andentertainment on the route: at Great Gransden,Huntingdonshire, it was the practice to hold thevicar upside down with his head in a waterhole.47The Puritans accordingly displayed hostilitytowards the whole business. ‘Is there an idol hereto be worshipped that you have a drinking?’,demanded an Essex perambulator in 1565."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"‘Charming the ɹelds’, Henry Barrow called it.48 AtDeddington, Oxfordshire, typical scruples weredisplayed in 1631 by the Puritan incumbent,William Brudenell, who refused to wear hissurplice on the outing, much to his parishioners’dismay, and jibbed at reading a gospel at thecustomary spot where a cross had been carved inthe earth. He demanded ‘to what end he shouldread one, and said he would not stand bare to ahole, which any shepherd or boy might make forought he knew, and said it was Popery to observeold customs; and he went further on and stood in aditch under an elder tree, and then read in a booka homily’.

The only answerhe received was that the ritual was a customaryone; this failed to satisfy him, and he abstainedfrom the perambulation.49These Rogation ceremonies, ‘gang days’, or‘cross days’, as they were called, were, of course,not primarily regarded as a magical method formaking the crops grow.

When a man was found dead at the wellin 1630 after having made scoɽng remarks aboutits supposed powers a local jury brought in averdict of death by divine judgement.74The wells also helped to keep alive the names ofthe saints, as did the holy days in the church year,and the dedications of ecclesiastical buildings.

Thevehemence of this attitude is reɻected in thecoarseness of the language with which the moreoutspoken Protestants rejected the conjurationsand exorcisms of the Roman Church. Holy water, itwas said, was ‘more savoury to make sauce...because it is mixed with salt’ and ‘a very goodmedicine for a horse with a galled back; yea, ifthere be put an onion thereunto it is a good saucefor a giblet of mutton’.94 In the diocese ofGloucester in 1548 two inhabitants of Slimbridgewere presented for saying that holy oil was ‘of novirtue but meet to grease sheep’.

Small wonder that a statute waspassed in the ɹrst year of Edward VI to restrainirreverent speaking of the sacrament.95Yet, crude as this language was, it conveyed anessential point. Many men were now unwilling tobelieve that physical objects could change theirnature by a ritual of exorcism and consecration.The Edwardian Reformation saw much iconoclasmand deliberate fouling of holy objects. Mass books,vestments, roods, images and crosses weresummarily destroyed. Altar-stones were turnedinto paving stones, bridges, ɹreplaces, or evenkitchen sinks. Dean Whittingham of Durham usedtwo ex-holy-water stoups for salting beef and ɹshin his kitchen, and his wife burned St Cuthbert'sbanner.96 Common people sardonically demandedchrisom clothes for their new-born foals, orostentatiously fed holy bread to their dogs.

Some physicians continuedto pay lip-service to the idea that sin was the most"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"frequent cause of sickness, but the readiness ofmedical men to ignore the spiritual side of illnesshad long gained them a reputation for atheism.Most of the clergy seem to have assumed that Godworked through the normal courses of nature,though they laid more stress on the divineinitiation of natural processes than did the doctors.Some theologians even declared that under certaincircumstances God might strike a man downwithout employing natural causes at all. He woulddo this, though infrequently, thought WilliamTurner in 1555, ‘for the revenging and punishingof some open sin or oʃence’. Archbishop Grindalsimilarly believed that a particularly sudden deathcould be recognized as a speciɹc judgement ofGod. Calvin had stressed that if the Almighty hadmarked out the moment of a man's death then nomedicine could avert it.30This fatalistic view of disease seems to havebeen most commonly invoked with referenceeither to venereal disease, where the element ofmoral retribution seemed obvious, or to epidemics,particularly of plague, when the scale of thevisitation cried out for explanation in terms of thesins of the whole community, or particular sections"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"of it. Puritans, for example, attributed theepidemics to the toleration of the Catholics, to thetheatres, to sabbath-breaking, or to the Laudianinnovations. ‘The plague of God is in the land forthe new mixture of religion that is commanded inthe Church,’ declared John Dod in 1635. Othersblamed it upon covetousness or impiety or someother conspicuous sin.31At the local level the clergy did not hesitate toidentify the scapegoat responsible for thecommunity's suʃerings. When 190 persons died ofthe plague at Cranbrook, Kent, in 1597–8, thevicar of St Dunstan's church entered his diagnosisin the parish register: it was a divine judgementfor the town's sins, and in particular for ‘that viceof drunkeness which did abound here’. Had it notbegun ‘in the house of one Brightlinge, out ofwhich much thieving was committed’, and did itnot end in that of ‘one Henry Grymocke, who wasa pot companion, and his wife noted for muchincontinency’?

He therefore took the opportunity ofcondemning the naturalistic views of the Family ofLove, the contemporary religious sect, whosemembers apparently attributed all troubles tooutward causes, and had expelled a member forregarding a chill he had caught as a divinevisitation.33From making recovery depend upon repentance"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"it was but a short step to suggesting that religiousconformity would provide immunity againstdisease. The ɹfteenth-century author of Dives andPauper had conceded that individual good menmight sometimes suʃer misfortune without havingdone anything to deserve it.

Theputrefaction of the air would not therefore aʃectthe man whose conscience was clear, for no onedied of the plague save by God's appointment.35Others argued that it was pointless to run awayfrom a plague-stricken area, since God's judgementcould not be so easily evaded.36 Some eventhought that a minority of plague deaths werecompletely supernatural, being produced by thedirect stroke of a ministering angel.37The idea was also put about that, since thevictims of plague were foredoomed by God'sdecree, the disease was not in itself contagious;there should be no ban on visiting the sick and any"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"protective measures were useless. Although themajority of clergy and physicians rejected thisnotion, it was said in 1603 to be ‘maintained notonly by the rude multitude, but by too many of thebetter sort’.38 A later writer attributed the badnessof contemporary medicine to the widely held beliefthat there was a certain span of life allotted toevery man which nothing could prolong.39 From1588 onwards the government's Plague Ordersrequired the clergy to refute the idea that it wasunnecessary to refrain from visiting infectedhouses. Henoch Clapham, a prominent preacher,was imprisoned in 1603 for reasserting thisposition. He had maintained in a published workthat the plague only struck sinful men and that nobeliever would die of it unless he was lacking infaith. Fatalism of this kind was actively combatedby the authorities.40Nevertheless, some persons continued to assumethat true believers were immune from the plagueand that precautions were therefore unnecessary.‘Pestilence is above all other diseases catching,’declared Thomas Jackson in the reign of Charles I,‘And such as have been most observant of itscourse tell us men of covetous minds or"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"unseasonably greedy of gain are usually soonestcaught by it, though exposed to no greater or moreapparent visible danger than others are.’41 Inkeeping with this attitude ‘some foolish people’were said in 1637 to believe that death in theplague was evidence of a man's reprobation.42 Inan age of Biblical literalism it was hard to ignorethe message of Psalm 91: ‘There shall no evil befallthee, neither shall any plague come nigh thydwelling.’ This was not a promise of totalimmunity, thought William Bridge, ‘but the driftand scope of the Psalm is to hold forth a specialityof protection for believers in the time of aplague’.43There was thus a strong tendency to assume thatobedience to God's commandments could conduceto prosperity and safety. No guarantees weregiven, for the ways of the Lord were inscrutable,and it was not only the sinful who were chastized.But the Biblical commentators, Dod and Cleaver,were sure that the godly would never need to beg;and the meteorologist, Robert Dingley, declaredthat it was relatively unusual for lightning tostrike one of God's chosen.

A Protestant clergyman did not set outto promise health and worldly success to those whofollowed the word of God; he tried to bringspiritual consolation, not the hope of materialprosperity. But until the end of the seventeenthcentury, and in many cases long afterwards, theoverwhelming majority of clerical writers andpious laymen sincerely believed that there was alink between man's moral behaviour and hisfortune in this world, whether in bodily health orprofessional success. It was impossible to reiteratethe view that sin was the most probable cause ofmisfortune without conveying the implication thatgodliness was somehow linked with prosperity.

Every county should havea secretary who would gather together thematerial sent in to him and forward it on to SyonCollege, to be analysed by Poole.

Many of"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"the Puritan anecdotes about the suddenjudgements which overtook blasphemers, perjurersand sabbath-breakers were derived from theexempla retailed by the medieval Church. After theReformation, Catholic supporters did not hesitateto blame plagues and other misfortunes upon thenew religious changes, or to see as judgements themisfortunes which sometimes fell upon theirpersecutors.70Catholic inɻuence also lay behind the widelydisseminated tradition that the monastic estatesconɹscated by Henry VIII carried with them adivine curse upon their new owners forappropriating to secular uses property oncededicated to God. Several diʃerent elements wentto make up this idea. The ɹrst was the ancientassumption that sacrilege of any kind brought itsown penalty. Nothing prospered when alienatedfrom God. Hence the numerous medieval stories ofthe terrible fate which had overtaken those whoattempted to rob holy shrines or to violate thegoods of the church. As John Aubrey pointed out,the iconoclast Henry Sherɹeld in 1630 broke notonly a window depicting God the Father in StEdmund's, Salisbury, but also his own leg while"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"standing on a pew to do it. Many of Aubrey'scontemporaries shared the belief that those whoprofaned or robbed churches infallibly came to abad end.71To this perennial sanction was joined anotherless strictly ecclesiastical notion embodied in thecommon English proverb that ill-gotten goodsnever prospered. This was extant in manyversions: ‘Evil-gotten goods lightly come andlightly go’; ‘Ill-gotten goods will not last threecrops’; or, most commonly, that ill-gotten goodswould not last to the third heir. ‘We be taught byexperience,’ declared the Homilies, ‘how AlmightyGod never suʃereth the third heir to enjoy hisfather's wrong possessions.’72 This traditionalbelief was well-designed to deter acquisitivebehaviour of many kinds. It was said, for example,that the disinheriting of the eldest son alwaysbrought bad luck, and that the families ofnotorious enclosers always died out in threegenerations: no depopulating landlord inNorthamptonshire or Buckinghamshire hadsubsequently thrived, thought John Aubrey.73 Italso presupposed the idea that guilt could beinherited, and that the corporate responsibility of"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"the family continued after the death of the originalevil-doer.Such beliefs in the reality of divine retributionwere readily applied in obvious cases of sacrilege.In 1686, for example, when the communion cupwas stolen from the church of St Peter's in Thanet,the event was solemnly recorded in the parishregister along with a brief discourse on the sin ofsacrilege, emphasizing God's readiness to punishboth the guilty party and his posterity, if necessaryrooting out whole families. ‘Read the annals of allages,’ demanded a pamphleteer in 1649, ‘Show mebut one church-robber's heir that prospered uponthe third generation.’74The belief that a curse lay upon the purchasersof monastic lands did not clearly develop until theearly seventeenth century, but it germinated fromnotions about sacrilege which had been currentmuch earlier. Some of the monks themselves hadprophesied that God would take vengeance uponthe destroyers of the abbeys, and many generalwarnings about the fate of the sacrilegious hadbeen issued during the general spoliation ofChurch property which had accompanied thereligious changes of the mid sixteenth century.75"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Even so, the speciɹc notion that the families ofthose who acquired monastic lands were likely todie out, probably after the third generation, doesnot seem to have been put about until at least thelater years of Queen Elizabeth.

In 1593 the author ofa memorandum on concealed lands belonging tothe Church remarked that God's curse (Malachi, iii,9) lay on those who misappropriated landsdedicated to his use.76 It was also about this timethat the Yorkshire clergyman Michael Sherbrookwrote in an unpublished treatise of thepunishments which had overtaken Wolsey,Cromwell, Edward VI and other principal authorsof the spoliation of the Church.77The more sweeping assertion that all holders ofmonastic lands were involved in a corporate guilt"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"for which they or their families would infalliblysuʃer is hard to trace back further than the reignof James I.

It is true that there is aninterchange of things in this world, and that it is avain thing for men to think that their names, landsand houses shall continue for ever; but yet that inso short a space so great a change should be of somany families, so likely to have continued forlonger space, must needs make men see... that thefact was displeasing unto almighty God, and that Itis destruction for a man to devour that which is holy,Prov. xx, 25.78The man who did most to disseminate this opinionwas Sir Henry Spelman. His ɹrst work, publishedin 1613 and issued four times during the century,was De non temerandis ecclesiis, which attacked theimpropriation of tithes by laymen and emphasizedthe divine punishments customarily inɻicted upon"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"the sacrilegious. His Larger Treatise concerning titheswas published posthumously in 1647 by theclergyman Jeremiah Stephens in a book entitledTithes too Hot to be Touched. But Spelman's mostsensational work was The History and Fate ofSacrilege. This had been prompted by his ownmisfortunes in connection with two monastic sitesin Norfolk, which had involved him in protractedlitigation until he came to see ‘the infelicity ofmeddling with consecrated places’. The book wasincomplete at his death and, although continuedby Stephens, was not published until 1698. Someof its conclusions, however, had been advertised in1646 by the author's son Clement Spelman in hisadmonitory Preface to the third edition of De nontemerandis ecclesiis. The great bulk of the book wasa laborious history of the punishments which Godhad bestowed for sacrilege from the time of theOld Testament onwards, but the most inɻuentialpart related to the purchasers of the monasticlands in England. Spelman systematically analysedthe fate of the owners of all the ex-monasticestates in Norfolk within a twelve-mile radius ofRougham, the seat of the Yelvertons. The resultwas the discovery that in less than a century ‘themonasteries had ɻung out their owners with their"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"names and families (all of them save two) thrice atleast, and some of them four or ɹve or six times,not only by fail of issue, or ordinary sale, but veryoften by grievous accidents or misfortunes’.Furthermore no one had dared to build upon theotherwise attractive sites of the monasteriesthemselves ‘for dread of infelicity that pursueththem’.79This was the most precise demonstration of thethesis which had yet been made. A slightly lesselaborate exercise of the same kind was performedby Sir Simon Degge's Observations upon thepossessors of monastery-lands in Staʃordshire, anessay written in 1669 to convey the author'sreɻections on reading the draft of a history of thecounty. It showed that in the previous sixty yearsno less than half the lands of Staʃordshire hadchanged hands, and attributed this fact primarily,though not exclusively, to the sacrilege of theDissolution. Degge's conclusions were, likeSpelman‘s, regarded as too dangerous to bepublished at the time, and only appeared in printin 1717.80 In the following year the legend wasfurther reinforced by Browne Willis in his Historyof the Mitred Parliamentary Abbies and Conventual"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Cathedral Churches (1718). Like most antiquarians,Willis lamented the desecration of buildings andmanuscripts which had accompanied thedissolution and did not fail to point the moral. Thedescendants of the man who pulled down BattleAbbey now lived near the site ‘in a meancapacity’, while a series of disasters had overtakenthe lay owners of Biddlesden Abbey, Bucks. Willisdeclined to enumerate ‘other particulars of thisnature, which might be equally invidious’, but thegeneral tendency of his researches was clearenough.

Two years later another contemporarypointed out that ‘all that Sir Henry Spelman hathwrit in his book [De non temerandis ecclesiis]...hath hitherto made no very great converts, thoughit hath been reprinted ɹve times’.

Suchforms of prayer were frequently issued throughoutthe seventeenth century, and beyond.3 Prayers ofthis type were not controversial. Puritans andAnglicans, Catholics and Dissenters oʃered themwith equal conviction.Some individuals, however, objected to certaintypes of petitionary prayer. The Henrician martyr,Thomas Bilney, thought it wrong to pray for therelief of any bodily inɹrmity.4 Similarly, theElizabethan Puritan Thomas Cartwright protestedagainst the prayer in the Litany for preservationfrom thunder and lightning.

To this Cartwright had no answer,though his objection was often reiterated by hisPuritan colleagues.5Otherwise, the only discernible diʃerencebetween Puritans and others in their attitude topetitionary prayer was that the Puritans laidgreater emphasis on the need for it to beaccompanied by fasting and personal austerity.There was nothing peculiarly Puritanical aboutfasting as such, for the Elizabethan Church oftenordered Fast Days at times of plague.

In addition to catering for the usualexigencies of birth, marriage and death, heprovided a suitable form of words for thoseseeking relief from such hazards as ɹre, tempest orinfectious disease, as well as for those Christianswho were embarking on journeys or otherpotentially risky ventures.8 Prayer could thus be"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"adapted to serve on every occasion. Indeed somemen were said to employ it in the pursuit of wildlyinappropriate goals. Sir Thomas More observedthat among the Welsh and the Irish it was commonfor thieves to pray for success before going out tosteal; a case is recorded of a seventeenth-centuryPresbyterian who prayed for two hours beforeengaging in highway robbery.9 ‘'Tis not aridiculous devotion to say a prayer before a gameat tables’, thought Sir Thomas Browne.10To the orthodox divine such activities werereprehensible. One should pray, but one's requestsshould always be of a seemly nature, and oneshould never ask for some private advantageagainst the public interest.11 Subject to thislimitation, godly men could pray abundantly, andtheir eʃorts did not go unrewarded. In Puritan andDissenting circles it became as fashionable to keeprecords of ‘signal returns to prayer’ as it was torecord other manifestations of divine providence.Numerous instances of successful prayer arerecorded in the journals and biographies ofseventeenth-century divines.12 Indeed one of thepurposes of the spiritual biographers was todemonstrate the eɽcacy of prayer. They"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"illustrated how bad weather or apparently fatalsickness could be arrested by the sustained prayerof godly persons, or the fasting and prayer of awhole congregation. The Life of Dr Samuel Winter(1603–66), for example, enumerated elevenseparate instances of eɽcacious prayer. Theyranged from the prayer which had helped Winterto choose a tranquil day for his sea-crossing toIreland, to the intercessions which had enabledhim to save the lives of Colonel Jones's wife inKilkenny, who was thought to be dying ofjaundice; of his nephew, who was suspected tohave the plague; of his sister-in-law, who suʃereda serious haemorrhage; of a merchant's wife, whonearly died in childbed; and his own daughter,who was critically ill with ‘the twisting of herguts’. Other instances of Winter's ‘power andprevalency in prayer’ might have been cited,remarked his biographer, but these were morethan suɽcient to demonstrate that the Lord was ‘aprayer-hearing God’.13But no one claimed that prayer wasautomatically eɽcacious in every context. ManyChristians prayed for material beneɹts and weregranted them. But there were even more whose"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"petitions were denied. This apparent uncertaintydid not worry the defenders of petitionary prayer,for they were never short of explanations as towhy any particular request had not been granted.It might be that the petitioner was insuɽcientlycontrite for his previous sins. Wicked men couldnot expect to have their prayers conceded. Neithercould godly men if their requests were unsuitable.(There was, of course, no telling what was suitableor unsuitable, for circumstances varied in diʃerentcases and God was the sole judge: ‘God doth knowbetter what is expedient for us than we ourselves.’)God might deny a request in order to try thepetitioner's faith: ‘If a man beg of God riches,honour, health, liberty and such like, and hereceiveth them not, but instead thereof hath God'sgrace and providence to sustain him, he receiveththerein from God much more than he asked.’Everyone who prayed could be sure that he wouldget what was good for him, though it might not bewhat he was hoping for. The less material therequest the more likely was it to be granted: ‘Ifthou ask no earthly or worldly thing, but suchthings as are spiritual and heavenly, then thoushalt be sure to obtain.’14"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"The belief in petitionary prayer was thus a self-conɹrming system. Once the petitioner hadaccepted the doctrine, his faith need never slacken,however unsuccessful his own requests for materialaid. When the Elizabethan Church oʃered prayersfor relief from plague or tempest it was alwayscareful to add that God, for reasons best known tohimself, might see ɹt to deny the peopledeliverance, and that these reasons were, bydeɹnition, good ones. Churchmen asked for divinejudgements to be lifted, but they added that theyhad, of course, deserved everything which the Lordchose to inɻict upon them. The widespread faith inthe possibility of material relief by divine meanswas thus sustained by the knowledge that therewas no failure which could not be satisfactorilyexplained away.Other types of prayer could serve their purposewithout drawing on this simple explanatorydevice. There was non-petitionary prayer, whenthe Christian worshipped and gave thanks,strengthening his own piety and devotion in theprocess. There was also the kind of prayer whichhelped men to take decisions in diɽcult situations.Many diaries and autobiographies of the periodshow how devout men were able by praying to"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"focus their minds upon a problem, and so to hitupon a solution. Thus when Margaret Roper, thedaughter of Sir Thomas More, fell ill with thesweating sickness, the doctors despaired of her life.Her father began to pray, whereupon ‘incontinent[it] came into his mind that a clyster should be theonly way to help her’; and so it proved to be. Inthe same way the mathematician Dr Pell told JohnAubrey that he believed that it was God who hadhelped him solve some of his more diɽcultproblems.15Prayer was also employed as a means ofdivination, that is to say of seeking supernaturalguidance when the petitioner was confronted by achoice of possible actions. The Yorkshire yeomanAdam Eyre asked God to decide whether or not heshould cast oʃ his unsatisfactory wife. The Essexclergyman Ralph Josselin sought divine advice asto where in the county he should live. The godlylayman Gervase Disney turned to prayer to knowwhether or not he should leave Nottingham.16 In1681 a religious youth at Warley, Yorkshire,resorted to prayer in an attempt to discover theidentity of the thieves who had stolen his father'scorn; he saw three men in a vision and asked for a"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"warrant to arrest them. Here the function ofprayer becomes comparable to that of the thief-magic of contemporary village wizards, whoemployed mirrors and polished stones in whichtheir clients might discern the features of thosewho had stolen their goods.17A graphic example of such divinatory prayer isprovided by the Dissenting clergyman, OliverHeywood, who records in his journal how he andhis wife were contemplating a journey to York in1673:There were several reasons that might induce usto take that season and some that contradicted. Iwas long in aequilibrio, doubted much what courseto take, went to God in prayer, as I have donemany times... and presently I found a stronginclination to stay at home. And in a little time mythoughts were established that way, according toProverbs, xvi, 3 [‘Commit thy works unto the Lordand thy thoughts shall be established’].18The psychological processes underlying such aprocedure must be left for the reader to determine.But it is obvious that prayer, used in this way,"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"could discharge a role much like that of otherdivining agencies. It helped the client to know hisown mind and gave him the resolution to actaccordingly. Behind his own unconsciousinclinations he saw the hand of God.Orthodox believers had no objection to prayingfor divine guidance in this way. But they were lesshappy about using sortilege to coerce God intotaking decisions on their behalf. Many members ofthe early Christian Church had attempted toinvoke divine aid by recourse to lots. In the styleof the sortes Virgilianae of the classical world theyprayed for guidance and then opened a Bible orPsalter, on the assumption that the verse on whichtheir eyes alighted would give the answer to theirproblem. The medieval Church consistentlydeplored the habit of taking decisions in this way,on the grounds that it constituted a superstitioustempting of God. But its prohibitions were onlymoderately eʃective. ‘From the fourth to thefourteenth century,’ wrote Gibbon, ‘these sortessanctorum, as they are styled, were repeatedlycondemned by the decrees of councils andrepeatedly practised by kings, bishops and saints.’By the later Middle Ages the leaders of the Churchdid not publicly resort to such devices in the way"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"that some of them had done at earlier periods. Butat a popular level the divinatory recourse to holybooks was a well established practice.19The Reformation seems to have made littlediʃerence in this respect. The Bible and Psaltercontinued to play an important part in populardivination,20 while recourse to scriptural sortes isrecorded in the lives of many Protestant divinesand public ɹgures of the sixteenth and seventeenthcenturies. When Edwin Sandys was Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University he wasassigned the delicate task of preaching before theDuke of Northumberland during the politicaluncertainties following the death of Edward VI; hechose a text by praying for guidance and thenopening his Bible at random. The religiousenthusiast Andrew Humphrey consulted his Biblein 1632 before sending oʃ an account of hisrevelations to the Secretary of State. The sametechnique was employed around 1636 by the tailorJohn Dane, when deciding whether or not toemigrate, and by Christopher Monk, the master ofa Bermudian ship, when captured by Algeriancorsairs in 1681.21 Similar stories are told aboutmany other contemporaries, including Charles I"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"and Archbishop Laud.22 Some are true, othersundoubtedly spurious. Either way, they illustratethe general disposition to believe in the possibilityof supernatural guidance in times of diɽculty. Asthe Independent preacher, William Bridge, put it,there was no telling when God might ‘please toopen a place of Scripture to the Soul’.23In fact, society as a whole had long beenaccustomed to referring potentially contentiousdecisions to lot. Tacitus records that this was thepractice of the ancient Germans; and in the twelfthcentury pilgrims had cast lots to determine whichshrine they should visit. In the sixteenth centuryborough oɽcers were sometimes chosen by lot; in1583 the Chapter of Wells Cathedral evenapportioned patronage in this manner.24 Lotterieswere often used to allocate goods to which therewas more than one claimant: in early seventeenth-century Reading three maid-servants annually castlots on Good Friday for money left by abenefactor.25 Church pews were sometimesallocated in the same way.26 On a national levellotteries were regularly used to raise funds forgovernment purposes from the reign of Elizabeth"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"onwards.27 The practice of forcing condemnedmen to choose by lot which of their number shoulddie was a common feature of military discipline,and much employed during the Civil War.28 WhenQueen Anne's Bounty was set up in 1704 toaugment the livings of poor clergy the choice ofthe particular livings to be augmented was madeby lot. A decision of 1665 even allowed juries tocast lots to resolve their diʃerences as analternative to a retrial when agreement could notbe reached. (This concession was set aside elevenyears later, however, and by the eighteenthcentury it had become a serious misdemeanour forjuries to reach their decision in this way.) 29For many persons the extensive use of lotterieswas simply a convenient device, a way of gettinga clear answer by which all the contestants wouldabide. But others regarded it as having a greatersigniɹcance. In 1653 a London congregationproposed that a new Parliament should be selectedfrom nominees chosen by each religiouscongregation ‘by lot after solemn prayer (a waymuch used and owned by God in the scriptures)’.30The clear implication here was that a choice madein this way would have received some sort of"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"divine approval. The same belief may haveunderlain the use of lots by medieval rustics tochoose appropriate times for sowing corn orcutting trees.31 It certainly played a part in thechoice of condemned men for execution, for thelucky ticket was sometimes labelled ‘life given byGod’.32 It was also present in the minds of thegodly when they used lots for decision-making; aswhen the itinerant preacher Laurence Clarkson, onthe road out of Colchester, ‘set up my cane uprightupon the ground; and which way it fell that waywould I go’. In 1649 the Council of the Armysought God by prayer and then cast lots todetermine which regiments should be sent toIreland.33 The Scottish leader, Archibald Johnston,Lord Wariston, took many of his decisions thisway, and so did some of the early Methodists.After John Wesley's death the Methodistconference resolved the important question ofwhether or not Methodist preachers had spiritualauthority to administer Communion, by recourseto prayer, followed by the drawing of lots.34Until the beginning of the seventeenth centurythe lot was generally regarded as a direct appealto divine providence. It was, as William Perkins"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"put it, ‘an act of religion in which we refer untoGod the determination of things of moment thatcan no other way be determined’. As such its usewas to be both solemn and infrequent. ‘We are notto use lots,’ continued Perkins, ‘but with greatreverence, in that the disposition of themimmediately cometh from the Lord, and theirproper use is to decide great controversies.’ Lotsshould not be employed to resolve trivialities; norwere they to be used if some alternative way ofreaching a decision was available. ‘When a manhath other means to try by,’ wrote John Weemse,‘then it is a tempting of God to use lots.’ This wasthe position which had been taken by thetheologians and canon lawyers of the medievalChurch and it was now reiterated by the Puritandivines.35 On a strict interpretation it meant thatgames of chance – ‘lusory lots’ as the casuistscalled them – were totally forbidden since theyinvolved recourse to divine providence forunworthy reasons. All games depending uponhazard or chance were to be strictly eschewed, notjust because they encouraged bad habits of idlenessor improvidence, but because they were inherentlydisrespectful to God. ‘The lot is cast into the lap,’said the Proverbs, ‘but the whole disposing thereof"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"is of the Lord.’ It was ‘the very ordinance ofGod’.36For the same reason some theologianscondemned the employment of lotteries for manyother routine purposes. They allowed their use incertain circumstances for dividing property orending controversies (‘divisory lots’). But lotterieswere strictly forbidden as a means of takingeveryday decisions, choosing ecclesiastical oɽcers,or raising money. They were also reprehensible ifemployed for the detection or trial of suspectedcriminals. The old judicial ordeal had beencondemned by the medieval Church as a temptingof the Lord and had accordingly been abandonedsince the early thirteenth century. But somesurvivals, such as the right to trial by battle incertain circumstances, had lingered on; while theordeal principle was to be extensively employed inthe thief-magic practised by the wizards andcunning folk of the countryside. Such‘divinatorylots’ werecondemned by theologians ashighly improper.37 When in 1635 Richard Lilburneproposed to exercise his right to resolve a lawsuitby trial by battle, King Charles I disliked the idea‘as not agreeable to religion’.38"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"There were thus three types of attitude to the useof lots. The ɹrst was to regard them as a readilyavailable instrument for settling daily problemswith God's aid; hence the extensive use of ordealsin medieval times. The second was the growingconviction that it was irreverent and sinful toinvoke God's aid on every trivial occasion; hencethe prohibitions of medieval canonists and suchsweeping Tudor condemnations of ‘lusory’ lots asDudley Fenner's Treatise of lawfull and unlawfullrecreations (1587, reissued 1592), and JamesBalmford's Short and plaine dialogue concerning theunlawfulness of playing at cards (1593, reissued1623). The third stage brings us into the modernworld, for it involved the denial that a lot was adivine providence at all; or rather the denial thatit was any more providential than any otherevent.The ɹrst systematic exponent of this view wasthe Puritan divine, Thomas Gataker, in his treatiseOf the nature and use of lots (1619; second edition,1627). Gataker's object was to eliminateunnecessary scruples about the use of lotteries andto justify their employment in routine secularcontexts. For him a lot was ‘a casualty or casualevent purposely applied to the deciding of some"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"doubt’, or in other words a result obtained bychance. For most divines, of course, the very ideaof chance was a heathenish concept; theypreferred to see God's immediate hand behind themost casual occurrence. But Gataker emphaticallyrejected such an assumption: God determined allevents, he said, but only in the most general sense.The fall of dice was no more an immediateprovidence than the daily rising of the sun: God'srole was no greater in events that were accidentalthan those which were contingent or inevitable. Bytaking the divinity out of chance occurrencesGataker was able to free the secular use of lotsfrom any hint of impiety. Divisory lots thenbecame as good a way of dividing up property asany other, provided no one regarded the result asa special decree by God. Games of chance alsobecame acceptable. Divinatory lots, however, wereabsurd, for there was no reason to credit themwith any special prognosticatory power. The ideathat chance itself might be subject to law was tofollow from Gataker's work.39But although his book carried a laudatorypreface by another well-known divine, DanielFeatley, it was a long time before his ideas were"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"fully accepted: as late as 1687 Increase Mathercould dismiss his arguments as unrepresentative ofthe main body of theological opinion.40 TheFrench jurist Barbeyrac developed Gataker'sposition in the early eighteenth century, pointingout that many Greeks and Romans had used lotsextensively without endowing them with anysuperstitious meaning.41 But his views were hotlycontested. The objection to games of chancelingered; and it remained a relatively advancedposition to regard the result of lots and ordeals aspurely random.42Meanwhile, the seventeenth century hadwitnessed some striking examples of the use of lotsby pious individuals seeking God's opinion onsome speciɹc matter. Sir William Waller, theParliamentary general, used Biblical sortes todivine whether his wife would come safely out ofher labour.43 Many writers retold the story of MrsHonywood, the Tudor gentlewoman, who,despairing of her salvation, hurled a glass to theɻoor, declaring that it was as certain that she wasdamned as that the glass would break;miraculously it remained intact, and she recovered"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"her conɹdence.44 A hundred years later ahysterical girl, Sarah Wight, threw down anearthenware cup, saying that as sure as the cupwould break there was no Hell. On this occasionalso the cup remained unbroken. A similar taleconcerned Mrs Joan Drake of Amersham, who inher periods of great temptation had a habit ofopening the Bible and putting her ɹngers suddenlyon a verse at random, declaring, ‘Now whatsoevermy finger is upon is just my case, whatsoever it be,and my doom.’ ‘But the Lord did so order it,’ weare told, ‘that looking upon the verse it wasalways found encouraging and comfortable.’45Other contemporaries made God's interventionon their behalf a test of his existence. ‘Christ, myChrist,’ the Essex witch, Elizabeth Lowys, wasalleged to have exclaimed in 1564, ‘if thou be asaviour come down and avenge me of my enemies,or else thou shalt not be a saviour.’46 AnotherElizabethan sceptic, David Baker, was reclaimedfor religion after surviving a nasty moment whenhis horse stuck on a narrow bridge over adangerous river: he declared that if he got backsafely he would believe there was a God. TheQuaker James Nayler told of a young man who"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"was tempted to put his hand in a boiling kettle tosee whether God would preserve him from theconsequences. His co-religionist Solomon Eccleschallenged the Baptists to do without food andsleep for seven days as proof of their religion.Another eccentric, wandering through the North ofEngland in the 1670s, dealt with his adversaries byinviting them to pray that God might immediatelystrike whichever of them was in error.47 In theirsermons and homiletic writings, many moralistsheld out such sanctions as evidence for religion.They retailed stories of persons who falselyinvoked God on their behalf with direconsequences, and of justiɹed curses which tookeffect.48 The possibility of divine intervention wasthus widely upheld in a variety of popular beliefsand anecdotes, some of which were systematicallydisseminated by the clergy. Among the people thelot retained its appeal for divination and decision-taking. ‘Among the ignorant and superstitioussort,’ thought William Perkins, ‘such practices arecommon and in great account.’ Even the judicialordeal survived informally; in the seventeenth-century witch-trials the suspect's failure topronounce the Lord's Prayer correctly, or to sink"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"when immersed in water, was taken by educatedobservers as certain proof of guilt.492. HealingAlthough most post-Reformation theologiansupheld the eɽcacy of petitionary prayer, theyusually stressed that it was intended to supplementnatural remedies rather than to supersede them.For a man to rely solely on divine aid in a contextwhere he was perfectly capable of helping himselfwas both impertinent and superstitious. ‘It is not apraying of God, but a tempting of God,’ said oneElizabethan bishop, ‘to beg his blessing withoutdoing also our own endeavour’; it was as if ahusbandman were to pray for a good harvest, butlet his plough stand still. Only after all naturalaids had been exhausted should the petitionerthrow himself upon God's mercy, and even then heshould not tempt providence by asking for theimpossible.50 Catholics might continue to rely onunaccompanied prayer and even achieve miraclesin this way51, but Protestants were not to look formiraculous aid of any kind. Miracles were theswaddling-bands of the early Church, necessary for"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"the initial conversion of unbelievers, butredundant once the faith had securely establisheditself. The Catholics were wrong to maintain thatthe power to work miracles was an essentialfeature of the true Church.52This idea took some time to establish itself. EarlyProtestants had not always managed to renouncethe notion that the true religion carried with it asuperior magic. Miraculous cures were said to havebeen eʃected at the grave of the Lollard martyrRichard Wyche, and John Foxe had no hesitationin publicising the story that a conjuror was unableto do his diabolical tricks so long as he remainedin the godly presence of William Tyndale.53 Faithin the power of unaccompanied petitionary prayerlingered on. In 1617 a writer complained of thevulgar belief that prayers were enough to curedisease: ‘Hence that speech of theirs; God hath sentit, and he can take it away.’ In Northern Ireland apreacher met a man who thought ‘that there wasneed of no other mean to be used but prayer,whatever ailed, soul or body, young or old, corn orcattle’.54 During the century before the Civil Warisolated religious enthusiasts bragged of theirpower to use prayer to work supernatural eʃects."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"The Elizabethan fanatic, William Hacket, boastedthat if he pronounced the appropriate word itwould not rain even though all the divines inEngland prayed for it to do so; similar claims weremade by two London weavers in 1636.

There arevarious ways of explaining why the sects shouldhave multiplied so remarkably during these years.One can point to the disintegrative tendencies ofthe unchecked Protestant conscience, and theextent to which the new religious groups expressedthe social and political aspirations of the poorermembers of society for whom the Anglican Churchhad never adequately catered.

Such pretensions werecondemned and despised by most educatedpersons, but they appealed powerfully to othersless fortunate.For, despite a hundred years of Protestantism,the problems to which the magic of the medievalChurch had attempted to provide an answer stilllacked any alternative solution. The helplessnessof the poorer classes in the face of disease and thephysical hazards of their environment had notnoticeably lessened. When the Church collapsed in1640 it was the sects who came forward to ɹll thegap. Sectarian leaders sometimes attempted toperform marvels as proof of their credentials: theclergy should not be heeded unless they could workmiracles, said the Ranter, Thomas Webbe.56 Theprospect of supernatural relief helped to give thesects their drawing power; just as in modern times"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"an emphasis upon religious healing, divinationand prophecy has brought recruits to thePentecostal Churches of the Bantu and similarAfrican separatist groups.57Not that all the miracles claimed by the Englishsectaries had any very obvious practical value.Some embarked upon marathon fasts, abstainingfrom food of any kind for forty days or more, as ademonstration of their spiritual virtuosity.58Spectacular abstinence of this kind, particularly ata time of high food prices, may have helped todrive home the message that with spiritual aid itwas possible to triumph over the diɽculties of thisworld. But it cannot be seriously argued that it didmuch to help anyone's material problems. On theother hand the claim to heal disease by the merepronunciation of prayers had an obviousattraction. The Baptists based their healing uponJames, v, 14 (‘Is any sick among you? Let him callfor the elders of the church; and let them pray overhim, anointing him with oil in the name of theLord’).

The primitive belief in the supernaturalsigniɹcance of vivid and repetitive dreams hadbeen kept alive by the early Church: even thepagan practice of seeking foreknowledge by ritualincubation at the shrine of Asclepius had beenreplaced for a time by nocturnal vigils at theshrine of Christian saints.68 In the sixteenthcentury importance was still attached to dreams.Theologians taught that most of them had purelyphysical causes and were not to be heeded.

In 1559Nicholas Colman, citizen of Norwich, announcedthat a band of foreigners dressed in beggars’cloaks, but with silk doublets underneath, wouldgo through the realm, setting ɹre to market-townsand villages, and burning down Norwich itself; heknew this because he had foreseen it in his sleep.Other nocturnal visionaries bombarded Elizabeth'sministers with similar warnings.79 In the midseventeenth century John Aubrey thought that‘many’ of his contemporaries took careful note oftheir dreams.80 The belief in their supernaturalpossibilities was much exploited by the sectaries.81Most of the ‘visions’ and ‘revelations’ which wereso common during the Interregnum were probablywhat we should call dreams.The possibility of religious prophecy was alsoadmitted in more orthodox circles. ‘It was ourbishop's opinion,’ wrote the biographer of JohnHacket, the Restoration Bishop of Coventry andLichɹeld, ‘that the spirit of prophecy was not quitedried up, but sometimes pro hic et nunc God gavemankind still a knowledge of future events.’"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Richard Baxter criticized the sects for placing toomuch reliance upon revelations as opposed toscripture, but he did not dismiss the possibility ofrevelation altogether.82 Neither indeed did BishopSprat, though he thought it highly unlikely.83In the later Middle Ages, when mystical activitywas common, such revelations had been familiarenough. Hermits sometimes functioned as prophetsand counsellors, and religious persons were oftencredited with special access to knowledge of thefuture.84 The Duke of Buckingham's execution in1521 came after his consultations with theCarthusian monk, Nicholas Hopkins, who foretoldby divine revelation that Henry VIII would haveno male issue and that Buckingham would succeedhim. The Nun of Kent, Elizabeth Barton, who hadlong claimed divine prophetic powers, employedthem to predict that the King would lose his throneif he persisted in his intention to marry AnneBoleyn.85 Visions were a standard attribute ofsanctity and Catholic martyrs like Sir ThomasMore and the Carthusian fathers were said by theirhagiographers to have enjoyed prophetic gifts.

The Marian persecution was said tohave been predicted by Hooper, Bradford, Latimerand other Protestant martyrs. The pages of JohnFoxe's Acts and Monuments abound in stories of themartyrs who foretold their own deaths or kept upthe hopes of their supporters by correctlyprognosticating Queen Mary's death and the endof persecution.87 These predictions were notregarded as the result of political sagacity but asproof of direct inspiration. ‘God hath revealedunto me secrets unknown to the world,’ declaredJohn Knox in 1565.88 Through Foxe's great bookthe tradition that a godly man might havesupernatural knowledge of the future was widelydisseminated among English Protestants.

In 1634 Foxe's granddaughterclaimed that there was an old man still alive whohad been present on that notable occasion. Storiesof this kind were to be an important source ofinspiration to the Civil War sectaries.89It was thus quite common for the biographers ofTudor and Stuart divines to attach a propheticsigniɹcance to some casual remark on theirsubject's part. The Civil War was said to have beenpredicted by Richard Hooker, Lancelot Andrewes,George Abbot, Thomas Jackson, Nicholas Ferrar,James Ussher, Robert Catlin and others.90 Ajocular remark by the Puritan Edward Dering wasconverted by posterity into a solemn prophecyconcerning the fall of the bishops; Richard Baxterpredicted the great ɹre at Bridgnorth; JohnHampden foresaw Oliver Cromwell's later career;Thomas Goodwin had a misleading revelation thatthe Protector's ɹnal illness would not be fatal andsubsequently complained that God had deceivedhim; inspiration from Heaven enabled John Welshat Ayr to discern the plague in a pack of clothes.91Many godly men were thought to have had divine"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"presages of the date of their own deaths; and thesame privilege was enjoyed by those miniaturePuritan heroes, the children who were too good tolive.92 These stories became an essential feature ofthe spiritual biographies of the seventeenthcentury. They reɻected the popular assumptionthat a man who was holier than hiscontemporaries was likely to be endowed with aspecial gift of foreknowledge.Casual obiter dicta by men of accepted godlinessbelonged to a diʃerent category from the ecstaticclaims to immediate revelation made by obscurepersons who thrust themselves into the limelight toenjoy a brief moment of glory, before societydescended upon them with condign punishment fortheir pretensions. It was the Civil War periodwhich saw most enthusiastic activity of this kind,but there had been a steady procession of would-beprophets during the previous century, some ofthem even claiming to be Christ in person or hisappointed representative: a pretension which hadbeen familiar in medieval England and which waswell known to Tudor writers on mental illness.93Others cast themselves and their associates for the"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"role of the Two Witnesses promised by Revelation,xi, 3–11, with their prophetic power, and theircapacity to control the weather, to bring downplague, to kill their enemies and to rise from thegrave. The Bible also hinted at the existence ofother prophets who might be expected to make apersonal appearance before Judgement Day: aNewbury Lollard had looked forward to thecoming of Enoch and Elijah in 1491,94 and similarhopes of an Elias or Elijah, as foretold in Malachi,iv, 5, were entertained by many of his Protestantsuccessors.The reign of Elizabeth produced a small army ofpseudo-Messiahs. In London in April 1561 JohnMoore was whipped and imprisoned for saying hewas Christ; the same treatment was meted out tohis companion, William Jeʃrey, who declared thathe was Peter who followed Christ. A month later a‘stranger’ was set in the stocks for claiming to bethe Lord of Lords and King of Kings. In thefollowing year Elizeus Hall, a draper, was arrestedand interrogated by the Bishop of London forassuming the title of Eli, the carpenter's son.

He abstained from flesh, fish andwine, and appears to have worn a specialcostume, of which the details unfortunately do notsurvive. He was sent to Bridewell, and BishopPilkington preached a special sermon against himbefore the Queen.95 In 1586 John White,shoemaker of Rayleigh, Essex, claimed to be Johnthe Baptist, while Ralph Durden, a minister fromthe same county, announced himself as the King ofKings and Lord of Lords who would lead the saintsto Jerusalem. In the following year Miles Fry, aliasEmmanuel Plantagenet, informed Burghley that hewas the son of Queen Elizabeth by God the Fatherand that his authority was greater thanGabriel's.96 Usually the government dismissedsuch prophets as ‘brainsick’ or ‘frantic’.97 Butwhen the enthusiast's activities threatened to havepolitical consequences the authorities were quickto act, and in 1591 the case of William Hacketmoved rapidly to a grisly conclusion.Hacket was an illiterate and bankrupt ex-serving-man, who had persuaded himself that hewas the Messiah and had come to judge the worldon God's behalf. He laid claims to gifts of prophecy"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"and miracle-working; and he threatened a series ofplagues upon England unless immediatereformation took place. He was a ɹerce man, whowas said to have bitten oʃ and eaten anantagonist's nose; ‘his manner of praying’ wasobserved to be ‘as it were speaking God face toface’. Hacket had already been roughly treated invarious English provincial towns, and hisprominence in 1591 sprang from his associationwith two Puritan gentlemen, Edmund Copingerand Henry Arthington, whom he persuaded of hisclaims and appointed his prophets, one of mercyand one of judgement. Those of whom Hacketapproved were to be sealed on the forehead aselect persons by Copinger; those whom he dislikedwere to be handed over to Arthington forconsignment to eternal vengeance. Copinger, itshould be noted, was a younger brother, andArthington had fallen into debt; it may be thatboth saw Hacket's cause as a possible solution totheir diɽculties. Arthington subsequentlyattributed Hacket's inɻuence over him towitchcraft, but Copinger was a whole-hearteddisciple who had convinced himself that anythingHacket prayed for would automatically begranted. Hacket, he believed, was both King of"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Europe and the Angel who would come before theLast Judgement to separate the sheep from thegoats; if he were imprisoned, the bolts wouldmiraculously fall off his heels.On 16 July 1591 Hacket and his companionsannounced their claims on a cart in Cheapside. Acrowd gathered, and heard Hacket declare that thePrivy Council should be reconstituted and that theQueen had forfeited her crown. The trio wasarrested; and Hacket was charged with impugningthe Queen's authority and treasonably defacing theroyal arms. He was executed, despite his hopesthat a miracle would save him at the last moment.Copinger starved himself to death in gaol, whileArthington recanted and, with the aid of a pensionfrom the Earl of Cumberland, gave himself over tothe composition of pious works.98The episode was probably inɻated by thebishops in an eʃort to discredit the Puritanmovement as a whole. The oɽcial account of theaʃair stressed Hacket's links with Penry, Udall,Egerton, Paul Wentworth and other prominentPuritans; and the event certainly contributed tothe general setback which the Puritan party wereexperiencing at the time. But there was no real"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"link between Hacket and orthodox Puritanism;instead the incident gave a lively foretaste of theenthusiastic activities of some of the Civil Warsects. In the seventeenth century an old man wasto tell Richard Baxter that Arthington andCopinger had been possessed with the spirit of theGrindletonians, the Yorkshire Antinomian sectwhich preceded the Seekers and Quakers.99Hacket's formal handing-over of sinners tojudgement also anticipated the ceremonial cursingwhich was to be employed in the 1650s byLodowick Muggleton.These exploits were closely paralleled by twoweavers, Richard Farnham and John Bull, whoattracted a good deal of public attention inLondon in 1636. They too claimed to be divineprophets, armed with the power to inɻict plaguesupon mankind and the knowledge of all things tocome. ‘I am one of the two witnesses that arespoken of in the 11[th chapter] of Revelation,’declared Farnham. ‘The Lord hath given me powerfor the opening and shutting of the heavens.’ Bothmen were imprisoned by the High Commission anddied in 1642, but not before they had promised torise again and reign for ever. They left a small sect"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"of female disciples who remained conɹdent thatthe two prophets had risen from the dead andgone to convert the ten tribes of Israel; in duecourse they would return to rule the kingdom.Their supporters were ‘esteemed by understandingmen to be women of good parts, honest ofconversation and very ready in the Scriptures’.100The claim to be the Two Witnesses in Revelationwas later revived by the two tailors, John Reeveand Lodowick Muggleton, who established a sectduring the Commonwealth, after announcingthemselves to be the forerunners of Christ, armedwith the keys of Heaven and Hell.Yet another pre-Civil War Messiah was theAnabaptist and Arian, Edward Wightman, who in1612 became the last Englishman to be burned forheresy. He claimed to be the Elias or Elijahforetold in Malachi, iv, 5; the Prophet who Moseshad said would be raised up from among hisbrethren (Deuteronomy, xviii, 18; Acts, iii, 22; vii,37), and the Comforter predicted in John, xv, 26;those who denied his claims would meet the fate ofthe children who had mocked Elijah.101 Thesethreats did not save Wightman from his terribledeath, but neither did his fate deter others from"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"emulating his pretensions. The Seeker, JohnWilkinson, announced himself in 1623 as a newprophet sent by God; John Traske, the JacobeanJudaist, thought himself a second Elias, and,believing himself able to do miracles, oʃered tocure King James's gout. In 1628, a separatistclaimed to be one of the Apostles.102With the outbreak of the Civil War such ɹguresmultiplied. Roland (or Reynold) Bateman, a day-labourer, was imprisoned in London in the summerof 1644 after declaring that he was Abel theRighteous, who would be slain and rise again. Afew months later he was examined at Essex Assizesafter running away from the Parliamentary armyinto which he had been impressed. Questioned asto his reasons, he stated that ‘they that did presshim did compel God to go against God. And thatthe young child that is conceived in King Charlesand himself, both united in one, is the King ofHeaven and... that when he shall be put to deaththen King Charles will come home and not before.’Furthermore, no one had ‘knowledge of theScripture, but King Charles and himself and threeLords. And... when he... is put to death after threedays he shall rise again and then whom he will he"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"will save and whom he will he will damn.’103This was an unusual case of a Royalist Messiah.Such pretensions were more commonly foundamong the radical wing of the Parliamentaryparty, particularly after the spread of perfectionistideas. An army captain, accused of saying he wasChrist, explained that he meant that anyone withfaith was in Christ and had Christ in him. Suchdoctrines confused observers and perfectionistsalike. ‘Some poor creatures call themselves Christ,’admitted the Fifth Monarchist prophetess, HannahTrapnel: ‘because of this oneness with Christ theywill have no distinguishing.’ This failure todistinguish between the inner spirit and its earthlyvessel underlay the messianic delusions of theQuaker James Nayler.104 It made possible thecareer of the Ranter, John Robins, who was deiɹedby his followers; they also cast his wife as theVirgin Mary and his son as the infant Jesus.Robins himself disclaimed any such divinity, buthad no hesitation about claiming a directrevelation from the Holy Ghost and a divineinstruction to carry out the conversion of the Jewsand the re-conquest of Jerusalem.105A similar ɹgure was William Franklin, the"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"London ropemaker whose claim to be the Messiahresulted in a crestfallen recantation beforeWinchester assizes in 1650. He had appointeddisciples to perform the roles of destroying angel,healing angel, and John the Baptist, and hisactivities attracted ‘multitudes of persons’. In 1666William Woodward, Rector of Trottescliʃe, Kent,was deprived of his living for declaring thatFranklin, who had become his lodger, was Christand Saviour. He had lost a Hampshire living forthe identical oʃence in 1650.106 Other episodes inthe same tradition include the unsuccessful attemptof three Newbury Anabaptists to ascend to Heavenin 1647; the claim by Thomas Tany to be God'shigh priest, sent to gather in the Jews; the boast bythe Ranter, Mary Adams, that she had conceived achild by the Holy Ghost; the appearance of severalother would-be Messiahs; and the cruciɹxion of anelderly woman at Pocklington by a couple whowere said to have persuaded her that she wouldrise again on the third day.107There were also many persons who, withoutmaking any Messianic claims, nevertheless boastedof direct revelation from Heaven. ‘All saints havein measure a spirit of prophecy’, said the Fifth"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Monarchist, Mary Cary.108 Much the best-knownsuch prophet before the Civil War was LadyEleanor Davis (or Douglas), the daughter of theEarl of Castlehaven, who married ɹrst Sir JohnDavis and then Sir Archibald Douglas.109 In 1625she ‘heard early in the morning a Voice fromHeaven, speaking as through a trumpet thesewords: “There is nineteen years and a half to theJudgment Day”’. From then until her death in 1652she had a continuous career of propheticutterance, interrupted only by consequentialperiods of imprisonent. Contemporaries believedher to have predicted the deaths of Charles I, Laudand Buckingham, as well as that of her ɹrsthusband. Her ecstatic and utterly obscurepronouncements were frequently printed, and asfrequently suppressed. In 1633 she was imprisonedand heavily ɹned by the High Commission forillegally printing at Amsterdam a commentary onDaniel in which she made dark predictions aboutthe fate awaiting Laud and Charles I. A few yearslater she went beserk in Lichɹeld Cathedral,deɹling the altar hangings and occupying theepiscopal throne, declaring she was the Primate ofall England. This led to a further period of"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"restraint.Nevertheless she had her supporters. A leadingpolitician like Sir Edward Dering could fully acceptthe idea that she had genuine fore-knowledge, andher champions included the refugee Queen ofBohemia, and the Anglican divine Peter duMoulin.110 Her enemies either thought her adangerous sectary or accepted the contemporaryanagram of her name ‘Dame Eleanor Davis: (neverso mad a ladie)’. The modern reader, to whommost of her eʃusions appear incomprehensible,may well be tempted to agree that she was insane.Yet, though undoubtedly linked to a hystericaltemperament, her eccentricity is probably bestregarded as a response to the social obstacles withwhich she had to contend. Both her husbandsdisapproved of her interest in public aʃairs andsucceeded in burning some of her books; to theHigh Commission her great oʃence was that ‘shetook upon her (which much unbeseemed her sex)not only to interpret the Scriptures... but also to bea prophetess’.

Women were forcedinto such postures because the more conventionalvehicles of pulpit and printed sermon were deniedthem, although the collapse of the censorshipduring the Civil War years gave moreopportunities for self-expression: Lady EleanorDouglas published at least thirty-seven tractsbetween 1641 and her death eleven years later.But, before the Civil War, recourse to prophecywas the only means by which most women couldhope to disseminate their opinions on publicevents.Thus in 1629 a Huntingdonshire woman, JaneHawkins, had ecstatic visions of the downfall ofthe bishops and the Anglican Church. She preachedin verse on the subject before a large congregationwhile the local curate took notes; only prompt"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"intervention by Bishop Williams prevented thematter from going further.112 Another prophetess,Grace Cary, a Bristol widow, had a vision in 1639w h i c h was subsequently taken to haveforeshadowed the Civil War. She followed the Kingaround, urging him to reform before it was toolate, by giving liberty to the Puritans, takingaction against Papists and doing something aboutHenrietta Maria's blatant Catholicism.113 Severalmale prophets were making similar requestsduring these years;114 doubtless they too found iteasier to represent their demands as the result ofheavenly visions than to risk putting them forwardas their private opinions.During the Civil War period it became commonfor prophets to lobby the King or the Army leaderswith accounts of the visions in which God haddeclared his political preferences. Their political orsocial objectives were usually transparent, and sowere the attractions of this method of proceeding;for a private person, however obscure, could, byclaiming a divine sanction for his particularpanacea, be sure of gaining an audience whichwould be at least temporarily respectful. On atleast half a dozen occasions between 1647 and"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"1654 the deliberations of Oliver Cromwell and hiscolleagues were interrupted, so that some obscureprophet, often a woman, could be admitted todeliver her message.115 The fasting and tranceswhich were a common preliminary to suchutterances helped to draw attention to theprophetess; properly publicised, they could ensurethat her pronouncements would be scrutinized byan altogether larger audience than she mightotherwise have ever hoped to command.Moreover, so long as theories of divine rightwere invoked in support of the status quo, itremained important for any reformer to prove thatGod was on his side. He could do this by extractingmoral and political recommendations from thoseparts of the Bible which appeared to justify hispoint of view: this had long been a staple form ofpolitical argument, and no one found it crampingto have to quote scripture in support of hisposition. But a much wider range of possibilitieswas opened by revelation. For prophecy claimedto supersede the mere written law of God, andthere was no way of refuting it, save by recourseto counter-prophecy. The sectary who asserted in1646 that she knew it was wrong to baptize"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"infants, because Christ had personally appeared totell her so, ran no risk of being outwitted in abattle of Biblical texts.116Such considerations help to explain why visionsand revelations were so prominent during thetroubled years of the Interregnum. The claim todivine inspiration was an accompaniment toradical politics with which only suchuncharacteristically sophisticated ɹgures as theLeveller leaders could aʃord to dispense. Ofcourse, not all the visionary literature of theseyears had a political aim, and some which had wasconservative rather than radical.117 But theoverwhelming majority of those who claimeddivine authority for their utterances were seekingauthority for a political or social programme.This association of prophecy with radicalism wasnot new. Earlier separatist polemic had oftentaken the form of revelation, predicting woe to thebishops and the Church of Rome; while ‘CaptainPouch’ (John Reynolds), the leader of the Midlandpeasants' revolt of 1607, had boasted a divinecommission to throw down enclosures.118 But thetendency was taken furthest during theInterregnum, when every kind of prophecy was"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"ventilated. There were predictions by youngchildren, and by old men on their death-beds.There were sectaries who claimed to have beenpersonally visited by Christ and others who hadbeen entrusted with revelations, by angels. Therewere sermons which contemporaries chose toregard as ‘almost prophetical’, and many boldclaims to foreknowledge. George Fox had nohesitation about declaring that he had predictedthe death of Cromwell, the collapse of theProtectorate, the second Dutch War and the Plagueof London. Many of his Quaker colleagues madesimilar claims. Since they made a habit offoretelling the destruction of the wicked by ɹreand plague, it was not diɽcult to provide someevidence in support of these boasts.119Many of the prophets who made themselvesprominent in the century before the Civil War hadeither predicted the imminence of the LastJudgement or seen themselves as playing apersonal role in the dramatic events which,according to Revelation, were to precede it. Theiractivities reɻected the widespread belief that, inone form or another, the Kingdom of God was athand. There was nothing new about such a"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"conviction. Messianic prophecies inherited fromthe ancient world had exerted much inɻuence inEurope during the Middle Ages, particularly uponminority groups to whom the prospect of futurebliss seemed compensation for their presentaʀictions. Periodically waves of expectancy hadswept Europe and the idea that it was necessary toprepare for the reign of God on earth bydestroying the representatives of Anti-Christ hadlong been familiar.120 In England some of theLollards had also reɻected these tendencies. Thedestruction of Babylon, predicted in Revelation,xviii, seemed an obvious reference to Rome; verbalglosses on this and similar passages of theApocalypse circulated extensively on the eve of theReformation. Foxe's Acts and Monuments made itan article of faith to hold that the Protestantreform of the Church had been predicted by a longline of medieval prophets, while the 1,260 days (oryears) of Anti-Christ (Revelation, xi, 3) couldeasily be recognized as those of Popishdarkness.121By making the Scriptures generally accessible,the Reformation increased the attention given tothe prophetic parts of Daniel and Revelation. It"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"also made popular a more literal interpretationthan that favoured by medieval schoolmen. In thereign of Elizabeth many learned men agreed thatthe world was in its dotage and that the end couldnot be far oʃ. There was widespread speculationabout its timing: in 1589 the courtier, AnthonyMarten, testiɹed to ‘the number of prophets thatGod doth daily send to admonish all people of thelatter day, and to give them warning to be in areadiness’.122 Theologians regarded it as highlyimproper to attempt to calculate the date ofDoomsday, but, as Bishop Jewel observed in 1583,men had been doing so for the last two hundredyears, though without success.123 Linked to thisolder belief in the imminence of Doomsday,moreover, was the more distinctively millenarianview that, when it happened, the end of the worldwould be heralded by a series of spectacular andsymbolic events, including the Conversion of theJews, the Defeat of the Turk, the Fall of Rome, andthe personal rule of Christ with his saints, eitherfor a thousand years (Revelation, xx, 4) or for ever(Daniel, vii, 18, 27).According to most commentators, thismillennium had already begun. But in the"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"seventeenth century various authors began tosuggest that it was still to come. Of the many datescanvassed, 1666 was particularly popular, sincethe number of the Beast who had ɹrst to beoverthrown was 666 (Revelation, xiii, 18).124 Analternative date was 1656, since this was thenumber of years which were supposed to haveelapsed between the Creation and the Flood.125But a good case could be made for various otheryears, particularly around the end of theseventeenth century.126These speculations had long been takenseriously by scholars and theologians; by 1649there were said to have been some eighty bookspublished in England on the subject.127 Millennialexpectations, in the sense of a belief in theimminent collapse of Anti-Christ, were now verywidely diʃused among the orthodox religiousgroups.128 But under the pressure of the Civil Warand its aftermath the calculation of the SecondComing ceased to be a donnish hobby and becamea matter of intense concern to the uneducated. Asearly as May 1643 Parliamentary troops in theWallingford area were discussing a report that"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Christ was coming to destroy Charles I, and thatthe Earl of Essex was John the Baptist. Four yearslater William Sedgwick, preacher at Ely Cathedral,set out for London with the news ‘that the worldwill be at an end within fourteen days, Christ thencoming to judgment, and that Christ appeared tohim in his study the last week at Ely and told himso’.129 The active millenarianism of theParliamentarians thus co-existed with the olderbelief in an imminent Doomsday.For the most part the feeling was one of excitedbut passive expectation. But the prospect that theFour Monarchies (Babylon, Persia, Greece andRome) might now be followed by the rule of theSaints brought forth an activist group: the FifthMonarchy Men, who played a prominent part inEnglish politics from 1651 onwards. To attain themillennium, this association of preachers, soldiersand urban lower classes was prepared to resort topolitical action and, in the case of a minority,even violence. The forthcoming utopia was anobvious projection of their own social ideals. Therule of the Saints was to be marked by theabolition of tithes, the reform of the law, theraising of the humble, and the pulling down of the"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"great. There would be no painful labour, nopremature death, no famine: ‘there is no creaturecomfort, no outward blessing, which the Saintsshall then want’.130 But their impact on eventswas pathetically slight. After the collapse of theBarebones Parliament in December 1653 theymaintained a vociferous but ineʃective oppositionto the Protectorate. The end came with the failureof armed risings led by the wine-cooper, ThomasVenner, in 1657 and 1661, although traces of FifthMonarchist sentiment lingered on for some years.After the Restoration millenarianism relapsed intoits more passive intellectual mood again; theprospects for 1666 or 1697 were keenly discussed,but there was never again to be so active anattempt to give history a push.It is hard to say for certain just why this briefbut notable shift from passive to activemillenarianism should have occurred during theInterregnum. Probably more important than theeʃects of the high prices and other economichardships of the later 1640s was the apocalypticsense generated by an awareness of living in atime of unprecedented political change. Therealization that the Civil War and the execution of"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"the King had no parallel in earlier English historyexerted a decisive inɻuence. It explains whyradicals like the Levellers were able to break awayfrom the idea that a precedent had always to becited in defence of any political proposal, andcould self-consciously reject the past asirrelevant.131 It also accounts for the convictionheld by so many of the Civil War sects that theperiod in which they lived was somehow theclimax of human history, the era for which allprevious events had been a mere preparation. Forthe Fifth Monarchy Men it was above all theexecution of King Charles which left the way openfor King Jesus. When after so signal a deliverancethe Rump and Cromwell in turn failed toinaugurate the new era it seemed necessary for theSaints to act for themselves.The social anthropologist can recognize in themillenarian sentiment of the Interregnum aparallel phenomenon to the chiliastic movementswhich still occur in the underdeveloped countriesof today. The ‘cargo’ cults of Melanesia involveritual practices designed to secure European riches(‘cargo’) from a supernatural source. They displaythe same note of expectancy and waiting for an"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"imminent deliverance. Such movements arenormally said to be produced by a sense ofblockage and deprivation, experienced by thoseun-integrated and disorientated members ofsociety to whom ordinary political action seems tooffer no hope of relief.132 To some extent the FifthMonarchy Men also ɹt this description. But theireconomic hardships had been long endured; it wasnot their social situation which gave them theirnew hope of deliverance, but the striking series ofevents set in motion by the execution of the King.Certain local ingredients also gave them adistinctive ɻavour: the belief that the English werean Elect Nation, specially chosen for theaccomplishment of God's purposes; the longtradition of Biblical exegesis; and the widespreadfaith in the prophetic potentialities open to theBiblical commentator, particularly when heclaimed to be divinely inspired.Even so, active millenarianism could never havegot under way but for the breakdown of thecensorship during the Interregnum and thecollapse of many traditional social controls.Conversely, it was only the ɹrm maintenance ofsocial order during the previous century which had"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"prevented some of the pre-Civil War prophets andpseudo-Messiahs from attracting a substantialfollowing.

Chiliasticsentiment had been endemic in English societysince at least the ɹfteenth century, and it wasprimarily the absence of the normal restraintswhich made the Civil War period so remarkablefor the extent and variety of its millenarianactivity.The spate of prophecy was sharply checked bythe Restoration, the return of the Anglican Church,and the persecution of the Dissenting sects. Thegoverning classes were determined to prevent anyrecurrence of the social anarchy of theInterregnum years and most of the sectariansthemselves were anxious to demonstrate their law-abiding character.

The Fifth Monarchists melted away; andwhen another would-be Elias, John Mason, Rectorof Water Stratford, Buckinghamshire, assembledwith his small group of followers in 1694 to awaitthe millennium, they aroused contemporaryamusement rather than indignation.135 But manyAnglican clergy remained passive millenarians andthe break with the prophetic past was onlygradual. From 1697 the distinctly middle-classSociety of Philadelphians began to publishtestimonies concerning the imminence of themillennium. In 1707 three of the Camisardprophets, who had come from France after theirpersecution by Louis XIV, were put in the pilloryin London for announcing that the Last Days hadbegun; in that year over four hundred personswere said to be prophesying in diʃerent parts ofthe country.136 As late as 1746 William Whiston,Isaac Newton's successor as Lucasian Professor atCambridge, could assume that the millennium wasonly twenty years off.137Changes in public opinion are always diɽcult tochart.

Even in theMiddle Ages some sophisticated observers hadregarded the activities of so-called religiousprophets as a form of mental illness.139 In theseventeenth century this attitude becameincreasingly common. Bacon and Hobbes exploredthe physical and psychological explanations forvivid dreams and premonitions. Bishop Spratstressed that sickness could masquerade asinspiration. Others pointed to the physicalconnection between the fasting and austerity ofthe sects and their readiness to prophesy and seevisions. Many would-be religious enthusiasts werelocked up as insane.

ConclusionReligion, therefore, did not immediately lose all its"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"wonder-working qualities as a result of theReformation. It is true that the most extravagantclaims for its material eɽcacy were made by thesects of the Civil War period, and they may fairlybe regarded as untypical, both by virtue of theirrelatively small numbers (the Quakers, the mostnumerous, had only between thirty and fortythousand members by 1660), and because of theunusually chaotic circumstances of theInterregnum years. But it has been seen that thepossibility of prophecy, miracle-working andsuccessful prayer was also maintained in moreconventional circles.It should, however, be emphasized that some ofthese activities were prized for their side-eʃects asmuch as for their overt purpose. They would bemisunderstood if they were taken only at facevalue. The Elizabethans who gathered together topray for the ending of the plague were not simplyengaging in a form of magic intended to bematerially eɽcacious. They asked God for relief, itis true, though without any certainty that it wouldbe granted. But they were also testifying publiclyto the concern aroused in the whole community bythe threat which confronted it. By assemblingtogether they demonstrated their social solidarity"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"in face of the epidemic; and, by confessing the sinswhich they thought might have occasioned it, theyreaɽrmed the ethical standards of their society.Such corporate manifestations were a valuablemeans of checking panic and disorder. Even todayat times of national emergency people will packthe churches without necessarily believing that inso doing they are increasing their prospects ofmaterial relief. They turn to religious ritualbecause they gain comfort from participating inthis manifestation of the community's unity in faceof crisis. In this sense prayer can never be in vain.The rite has what sociologists call a latentfunction, no less than a manifest one. As ananthropologist has remarked of the religiousceremonies employed by the Dinka of the Sudan,‘instrumental eɽcacy is not the only kind ofeɽcacy to be derived from their symbolic action.The other kind is achieved in the action itself.’145Such considerations must be borne in mind if weare to discern the full meaning of the specialprayers of the Elizabethans or the General Fastsand Days of Humiliation celebrated in the midseventeenth century. Nor should we forget thenumerous political purposes which such occasions"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"could serve. An Elizabethan Puritan wouldzealously attend an organized fast in order to meetfellow members of the godly party; the occasionwas a manifestation of collective solidarity. Theleaders of the Long Parliament used Fast Daysermons as a means of rallying members andsignalling changes in the party line.146 The NewModel Army also proclaimed fasts as a preliminaryto some new eʃort: an Army fast, observed aRoyalist contemporary, usually heralded some newact of mischief, for Cromwell's soldiers neversought the Lord until the time was ripe.147A comparable symbolic function was dischargedby the petitionary prayer of individuals atmoments of intense personal diɽculty. The ritualhelped men to focus their attention and to takestock of their situation. It also allayed anxiety bymitigating their feelings of helplessness. The moralstrength to be derived from this procedure is not tobe underrated. The psalms which Cromwell'stroops sang on the eve of battle or the prayerswhich the Marian martyrs uttered to sustain themin their agonies were not superfluous irrelevancies;they made such achievements possible.148Public prayers could also help members of"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"society to suspend the pursuit of their own privateinterests and to concentrate on problems commonto the whole community. The decline of specialdays of national prayer and supplication bearssome relation to the uninhibited growth of class-consciousness and sectional interests. In 1853 thePresbytery of Edinburgh petitioned Queen Victoriafor a national fast against the cholera. LordPalmerston brushed the request aside with thesuggestion that scrubbing brushes and chloride oflime would be more to the point.149 He isnormally commended for the ‘rationalism’displayed in this action; but it may well be thoughtthat his was a shallow view when compared withthat of those social conservatives who saw church-going and national intercession as a means ofpatching over the divisive interests of class and ofdiverting attention from social causes of popularmisfortunes.Some weight should also be given to thetherapeutic possibilities of prayer when used as ameans of faith-healing. When we learn that one ofGeorge Fox's patients, John Banks, had visions thatFox alone would be able to cure him, we are notsurprised to discover that he turned out to be one"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"of the Quaker leader's successful cases; on theother hand, when Fox met a cripple at Kendal andtold him to throw away his crutches, it is nowonder that, although the man did so, he stillremained a cripple.150The social functions of religious prophecy will bebetter understood when compared with the variouskinds of non-religious prophecy with which itcompeted. But certain conclusions suggestthemselves even at this stage. One is the role ofprophecy as a validating myth. Men drew uponvisions and revelations in order to persuade othersof the rightness of the course upon which they hadembarked. Dreams, for example, could serve as anexternal sanction for policies which wereotherwise diɽcult to recommend. The Lincolnshireknight who informed King Henry II that the voicesof St Peter and the Archangel Gabriel had told himto present a number of demands foreshadowingMagna Carta was perhaps the ɹrst of manyEnglish radicals who thought it safer to claim asupernatural sanction for their politicalprogramme.

The case ofMaria Marten of the Red Barn (1828) is only themost famous of the murder mysteries resolved bydenunciation on the alleged basis of a dream.152Conversely, it was possible to commit murderunder the inɻuence of the spirit: in 1633 Enoch apEvan, a farmer's son from Clun, Shropshire, killedhis mother and brother, after quarrelling withthem over whether communion should be receivedkneeling, a topic on which he had recentlyreceived divine inspiration.153One should, therefore, hesitate before dismissingall these prophets and healers as psychotics, thevictims of hallucination brought on by fasting or ofhysteria induced by sexual repression.154 It is notenough to describe such men as lunatics.

Forthem prophecy was an easy way of gainingattention. As one enthusiast confessed, ‘Sometimesthe ɻesh... would put me forward with motives ofpride, vain-glory, singularity, popular applause,getting a name, becoming famous, eminent andbe[ing] taken notice of, as Mr Sedgwick, [and] MrSaltmarsh were; and why should not I saysomething as well as they?’156Naturally, this gave uncontrolled prophecy ananarchic character. As Thomas Cromwell wrote ofthe Nun of Kent: ‘If credence should be given toevery such lewd person as would aɽrm himself tohave revelations from God, what readier way werethere to subvert all commonwealths and goodorder in the world?’157 The association betweenreligious enthusiasm and social radicalism, alwaysclose, was strengthened during the Interregnum,"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"when God, ‘that mighty Leveller’, as onecontemporary called him,158 was invoked asauthority for every kind of revolutionary scheme.A typical example of popular aspirations cast inreligious form was the divine vision attributed toJohn Brayne, a Winchester minister, in a broadsidepublished in 1649:Monarchy shall fall, ɹrst in England, then inFrance, then in Spain; and after in allChristendom; and when Christ hath put down thispower, he himself will begin to reign, and ɹrst inEngland, where the meanest people that are nowdespised shall have ɹrst the revelation of truth,and it shall pass from them to other nations.159It was to be a long time before sentiments of thiskind could be safely expressed in non-religiousform.

Sometimes the humblermembers of the congregation stood up and bowedout of respect when the gentry came in.2 The‘better sort’ might communicate on a separate day;and in some parishes even the quality of thecommunion wine varied with the social quality ofthe recipients.3Men's attitude to God himself reɻected the samesocial conventions.

There he might becompelled to undergo some humiliating form ofpublic penance or even be excommunicated, that isto say expelled from the sacraments of the Churchand, in its more severe form, subjected to totalsocial and economic ostracism by the rest of thecommunity; a punishment which reɻected theassumed identity of Church and society.This great social and administrative structurewas not ɹnanced simply from its ownendowments, but from the tithes, church rates and"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"miscellaneous fees which the parishioners wererequired to pay to the clergy.

Nevertheless, orthodoxreligion did not enjoy a monopoly of popularloyalty, and in several respects it was highlyvulnerable to competition from outside.2. The need for adviceThe parish clergyman did not merely preside overthe formal occasion of religious worship. He wasalso expected to be a guide and mentor to hisparishioners. When disputes broke out between thelaity it was to him they were ideally referred. Itwas often claimed that there were fewer lawsuitsin Catholic countries because their priests acted asarbiters for their ɻocks.8 But the same ideal ofclerical counselling was to be found in a Protestantenvironment. George Herbert expected the model"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"parson to be a lawyer as well as a pastor: ‘Heendures not that any of his ɻock should go to law;but in any controversy that they should resort tohim as their judge.’ Bishop Williams of Lincoln waspraised by his biographer for arbitrating incontentious matters so as to avoid litigation; whileSamuel Fairclough was only one of many Puritanministers who were famous for making up quarrelsbetween their parishioners.9 Peace-making was aduty incumbent upon all brands of clergy. Duringthe Civil War the lawyers in Parliament were saidto have fallen out with their Presbyterian allies,‘not so much upon conscience, as upon fear thatthe Presbytery spoil their market, and take upmost of the country pleas without law’.10 It isnotable, moreover, that the method which GeorgeHerbert prescribed for the clerical reconciliation ofdisputes made the parson the medium throughwhom the collective sentiments of the wholecommunity were expressed. For when faced by acontroversy, the priest ‘never decides it alone; butsends for three or four of the ablest of the parish tohear the cause with him, whom he makes todeliver their opinion ɹrst; out of which he gathers,in case he be ignorant himself, what to hold’.11"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"The clerical performance of these tasks,however, had been much weakened by theabolition of the confessional at the Reformation. Itis impossible to assess the full nature and workingof auricular confession in the Middle Ages, for theevidence simply does not exist; and it would bevery easy to exaggerate the sacrament'simportance in the life of the Catholic laity. Anannual appearance at confession was thoughtadequate by some clergy, and the layman wasseldom required to confess more than three times ayear unless he felt himself in deadly sin orimminent danger of death.12 Confession was thusa relatively infrequent occurrence in the lives ofmost men, though it was no doubt possible to saveup important matters to be ventilated on suchoccasions. It is hard to tell exactly what passedbetween the priest and the penitent, though themany extant manuals for medieval confessorsmake it fairly clear what was supposed to happen:the layman was to confess the sins he hadcommitted since last being shriven, to be examinedin the articles of his faith, and to be interrogatedabout other possible sins of which he had also beenguilty but which he had not confessed. The priestthen pronounced absolution and imposed some"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"appropriate penance, usually the recitation ofprayers.

The personal confession andinterrogation of every single layman waspotentially an altogether more comprehensivesystem of social discipline than the isolatedprosecution of relatively notorious oʃenders. Themedieval priest, for example, had been able to actas an agent for the detection of theft; there areknown cases in which stolen money was handedback as a result of his interrogations.13 SomeProtestants accordingly looked back to the MiddleAges as a time when the clergy had been able toenforce the standards they taught. ‘Then were theconsciences of the people kept in so great awe byconfession,’ wrote John Aubrey, ‘that just dealingand virtue was habitual.’14 Sir Edwin Sandys tells"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"us that before he set out upon his European travelshe had always assumed that the confessional wasan eʃective means of discipline and ‘a very greatrestraint to wickedness’ (in fact he was to bedisappointed, for he found that it operated in avery perfunctory way).15 The theme was taken upby many Catholic propagandists. The abolition ofthe confessional had weakened the fabric ofsociety, declared the Catholic émigré, BenjaminCarier:The servants have great liberty against theirmasters by this means, the children against theirparents, the people against their prelates, thesubjects against their King... for without the use ofthis sacrament neither can inferiors be kept inawe, but by the gallows,... nor superiors be evertold of their errors but by rebellion.16Modern population studies suggest that the rateof illegitimacy and pre-nuptial pregnancy mayhave been higher in seventeenth-century Englandthan in seventeenth-century France.17 If thisconjecture turns out to be true, it will be temptingto see the presence or absence of the confessional"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"as the decisive factor, just as Victoriancommentators attributed the superior chastity ofIrish girls to the same circumstance.18 Indeed thenotable correlation between high illegitimacy ratesand Protestantism which so impressed nineteenth-century demographers did not go unnoticed in theseventeenth century.

The Prayer Book required the curate whenadministering the Lord's Supper to exhort all thosetroubled in conscience or needing guidance torepair to him privately for ‘ghostly counsel, adviceand comfort’. Many bishops made a point ofasking in their visitation articles whether thisexhortation was being made and whether thesecrecy of all resulting confessions was preserved,as required by the Canons of 1604.24 Similarconfessions were invited in the Order for theVisitation of the Sick.

Lady Monson, for example, wife of thewell-known Jacobean admiral, was forced toconsult an astrologer in 1597, because ‘she cannotsleep; she hath many ill thoughts and cogitations;... she thinks the Devil doth tempt her to do evil toherself and she doubteth whether there is a God’.88There was nothing new about this tendency todoubt the basic tenets of the Christian faith.

In the laterseventeenth century many intellectuals were toreject the doctrine that the wicked suʃeredperpetual torment, but it was the mystical sects ofthe Interregnum who had done most to publicizesuch scepticism.110Ultimately, such heresies could lead to theformal rejection of all religion.

Henry Matthew of Guisleyconfessed before the Archbishop of York's court in1590 that he had sixteen years previously washeda woman's sore eyes and then said threePaternosters and a Creed, but that he had nowgiven up such practices because he had beenregarded as ‘a charmer’ for using them.4 It wascommon for those accused of charming or sorceryto deny the charge by asserting indignantly thatthey had done nothing by magic, but had merely"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"helped people by their prayers. Thus in 1607Isabella Beckett of Owston, Yorkshire, informedthe local vicar that his sick cow had been healedby God and her own good prayers.5Such formulae were often not so muchsupplications as admonitory formulae couched inreligious language. This can be seen in the case ofGoodwife Veazy, an expert in the cure of‘ringworm, tetter-worm and canker-worm’, whoseservices were recommended to Robert Cecil in1604. Her method was to say three times, ‘In thename of God I begin and in the name of God I doend. Thou tetter-worm (or thou canker-worm)begone from hence in the name of the Father, ofthe Son, and of the Holy Ghost; after which sheapplied a little honey and pepper to the aʀictedpart.6 Such was the mechanical eɽcacy attributedto prayers of this type that they were sometimesnot even pronounced aloud, but merely writtendown on a piece of paper, and hung round thepatient's neck. James Sykes of Guiseley, forexample, confessed in 1590 to curing horses bywriting prayers on paper and hanging them intheir manes.7Some of the other charms employed by the wise"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"men had a more tangled pedigree. These weredebased versions of Christian prayers or barelyintelligible bits of semi-religious verse, describingsupposed episodes in the life of Christ or thesaints. They reɻected the ancient belief thatmythical events could be a timeless source ofsupernatural power.8 A typical narrative charmwas the following, used at Hawkshead in the earlyeighteenth century as a remedy against bleeding:There was a man born in Bethlem of Judaeawhose name was called Christ. Baptised in theRiver Jordan in the water of the ɻood; and theChild also was meek and good; and as the waterstood so I desire thee the blood of [such a personor beast] to stand in their body, in the name of theFather, Son and Holy Ghost.For a scald there was this from Devonshire in themid seventeenth century:Two angels came from the West.The one brought fire, the other brought frost.Out fire!

Thepatient had to write three times on a piece ofpaper the verse:Jesus Christ for mercy sakeTake away this toothache.He then repeated it aloud and burned the paper.9Sometimes Hebrew words for the divinity wereemployed, like Sabaoth, Adonay, or Yhvh (thefour-letter word, Tetragrammaton). Originallythey had reɻected a belief in the magical power ofholy names. But by the sixteenth century theyoften meant as little to the wizard as to his clients.Conjurers, remarked a contemporary, used hybridnames like Ravarone, Hur, Asmobias, Mebarke,Geballa; they were not English, Latin, Hebrew,Greek, Arabic, Syriac or anything else.10 Thus oneElizabethan wizard had an elaborate remedy forthe toothache:First he must know your name, then your age,"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"which in a little paper he sets down.

This paper must belikewise burned, which being thrice used is ofpower to expel the spirits, purify the blood, andease the pain.11Other formulae reɻected memories of the magicalsquares and acrostics of antiquity, like thisprescription for the ague:Write these words: ‘Arataly, Rataly, Ataly, taly,aly, ly,’ and bind these words about the sick man'sarm nine days, and every day say three PaterNosters in worship of St Peter and St Paul, andthen take oʃ that and burn it and the sick shall bewhole.12Hundreds of such charms have survived,preserved in contemporary notebooks, or disclosedduring the course of court proceedings against"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"their users. Some were well known to everyone,like the so-called White Paternoster, of which aversion survives in the children's prayer: ‘Matthew,Mark, Luke and John, Bless the bed that I lie on’;others were closely guarded secrets. There werecharms for women in labour, mad dogs, sickhorses, and every conceivable ache and pain: as acontemporary put it, for ‘the stinging of serpents,bleeding at the nose, blastings, inɻammations,burnings with ɹre, scalding with water, agues,toothache, cramps, stitches, prickings, ragings,achings, swellings, heart burnings, ɻowings of thehead, &c’.13 Others were used when rituallygathering medical herbs. Vervain, which wasthought to have special protective qualities, had tobe crossed and blessed when gathered:Hallowed be thou Vervain, as thou groweston the groundFor in the mount of Calvary there thou wasfirst found.Thou healedst our Saviour, Jesus Christ, andstaunchedst his bleeding wound,In the name of the Father, the Son, and theHoly Ghost,"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"I take thee from the ground.14Much erudition would be needed to trace thegenealogy of the obscure and meaninglessformulae into which many classical and earlyChristian charms had degenerated by the sixteenthand seventeenth centuries.

Manyare almost identical with magical formulae used incontinental Europe.15 But by this period theiroriginal meaning was often hidden from those whoused them. Indeed the people who wore themround their necks were often illiterate. The veryimpenetrability of the formula helped to give it itspower.Certain assumptions underlying these charmscan, however, be detected. There was the idea thatdisease was a foreign presence in the bodyneeding to be conjured or exorcised out. There wasalso the belief that religious language possessed amystical power which could be deployed forpractical purposes. Such charms could beeɽcacious regardless of the moral value of the"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"operator; others depended upon the specialqualities of the healer: the Lancashire charmer,Thomas Hope, explained in 1638 that he owed hispowers to having been washed in special water atRome, which he had visited with his uncle as asmall boy.16All three constituents of primitive healing werethus present at one time or another: the spell, themedicine and the special condition of theperformer.17 But no coherent theory underlay thevisits of the clients to the cunning men. Indeed thepatient was often kept in ignorance of the formulaemployed, which, like the details of much modernmedicine, might be deemed too secret to beentrusted to laymen.There is one Alice Prabury in our parish[reported the churchwardens of Barnsley,Gloucestershire, in 1563] that useth herselfsuspiciously in the likelihood of a witch, takingupon her not only to help Christian people ofdiseases strangely happened, but also horses andall other beasts. She taketh upon her to help by theway of charming, and in such ways that she willhave nobody privy of her sayings.18"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"Similar precautions had been taken in the reignof Mary Tudor by another charmer, ElizabethPage. According to the Somerset mother who hadcalled her in to treat her sick child, shelooked on it lying in a cradle;... and kneeling bythe cradle, crossing the forehead of the said child,and demanding the name of it,... she spoke certainwords over the said child; but what they were thisdeponent cannot tell. And then rose and bade thisdeponent to be of good comfort and her childshould do well.Two days later the infant had recovered.19 Suchsecrecy was always important, and, althoughmany contemporary charm-books survive, theywere never printed and published, save by thosewho wished to expose them as fraudulent ordiabolical. Unquestioning trust was displayed bythe patients who wore the prescribed charms ontheir body. When in 1623 John Walter of Felphamvisited one Sowton of Sompting, a Sussex charmer,on behalf of a neighbour, he was given a bottle ofwater for her to take, and a paper with crossesand characters on it for her to wear.20 The"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"procedure was as matter-of-fact as the issuing of amodern doctor's prescription.Yet like modern drugs, the formulae employedwere often credited with highly dramatic eʃects.In 1617, for example, Edmund Langdon, whopractised medicine in the Bedminster area ofSomerset, gave one of his patients a piece of paperto be worn on his body for protection, which, hesaid, was so powerful, that ‘if it were hangedabout a cock's neck no man should have the powerto kill the... cock’.21 Such prescriptions were oftengiven to animals. In Cambridgeshire in 1601Oliver Den was accused of practising sorceryby using to write certain words in a piece of breadwhich he giveth to dogs bitten with a mad dog,thereby to keep them from it; and... one, WalterWard, having certain hogs who had been bittenwith a mad dog, the said Den did take apples andcut them into halves and did take the half parts ofthese apples and wrote certain letters on them,and gave the same to the said hogs, by which hesaid he would keep the said hogs from runningmad or... dying."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"Feeding mad dogs or those bitten by them withcharms written on paper was a commonprocedure.22In most cases, therefore, the wizard was simplya ‘blesser’ or ‘charmer’ who mumbled a few wordsover the aʀicted part of the body, or wrote downthe curative formulae on a piece of paper. WhenElizabeth Cracklow, the wise woman of Adderbury,Oxford-shire, was consulted in 1546 by oneGibbons, whose arm was ‘out of joint’, she causedher husband to ‘hold forth and preach over the saidGibbon's arm, and then she crossed his arm insundry places and bid [her] husband say one“God's forbade”’. She enjoyed a considerablereputation, and had been ‘sent for to divers placesfor the curing of people’.23 Such practitionersdeemed the cure to lie in the correct pronunciationof the appropriate formulae. But a few technicalaids might also be employed. Thus inNorthumberland in 1604 Katherine Thompson andAnne Nevelson were presented as ‘commoncharmers of sick folks and their goods’; theirmethod was to put the bill of a white duck to thesick person's mouth and then mumble charms.Another wise woman from the North East, Ann"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"Green, admitted in 1654 to charming ‘heart-ache’by crossing a garter over the patient's ears andsaying nine times, ‘Boate [i.e. help], a God'sname.’ She also cured pains in the head by takinga lock of the victim's hair, boiling it in his urine,and then throwing the mixture into the fire.24A further common method of magical diagnosiswas to examine some item of the patient'sclothing, preferably his belt or girdle, on theassumption that it would sympathetically reɻectthe wearer's state of health by ɻuctuating in size.In Cambridgeshire Elizabeth Mortlock describedthis procedure in 1566. She would begin withɹve Paternosters in the worship of the ɹveWounds of our Lord, ɹve Aves in the worship ofthe ɹve Joys of our Lady, and one Creed in theworship of the blessed Father, the Son and theHoly Ghost... and the holy Apostles, in the vulgartongue. Which done, she measureth the girdle orband of any such persons being sick or haunted,from her elbow to her thumb, craving God forSaint Charity's sake that if [they] be haunted witha fairy, yea or no, she may know, and saith that ifit be so the band will be shorter and her cubit will"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"reach further than commonly it doth.In this way she claimed she had been able to cureseveral children troubled by the ‘fairy’.25 Thehighly traditional nature of this method is shownby the fact that her account almost exactlyreproduces the confession of Agnes Hancock, madein another county, Somerset, over a centuryearlier, in 1438. She too professed to treat childrenaʀicted with the ‘feyry’ by inspecting the invalid'sgirdle or shoe.26Girdle-measuring of this kind was an ancientprocedure, widely dispersed throughout Europe.The assumption behind it was that the presence ofan evil spirit (‘fairy’) would reɻect itself in theinconstancy of the measured length. It was stillpractised at the end of the sixteenth century.Matilda Allin of Dullingham, Cambridgeshire, wascharged in 1592 with carrying ‘kerchiefs, ɹllets,girdles and part-lets from divers sick persons, andmeasuring of sick swine, and carrying these thingsunto such as are suspected to use sorcery andwitch-craft. Two years previously the wife ofThomas Bolton of Hickleton, Yorkshire, was said tohave ‘made a girdle about a thing and told one"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"that she would not die at that time’. (On thisoccasion the Archbishop of York's Court was‘doubtful whether the same be a charmer or no’.) Avariant method of magical cure, also based on thesympathetic qualities of the girdle, was revealedby Joan Sergeant of Minehead, who confessed in1532 that when her child was sick, she was advisedby a wandering beggar to ‘cut her... child's girdlein ɹve pieces and then to go to the church and sayɹve Paternosters and ɹve Aves and then to takethe same pieces of the girdle and hide it in ɹvesundry grounds’.27Other techniques included burning or burying ananimal alive to help the sick party recover,28dipping him in south-ɻowing water, dragging himthrough trees or bushes,29 and touching him witha special staʃ; in 1523 John Thornton of Sapcote,Leicestershire, claimed to have been curinganimals with a ‘Moses rod’ for thirty years.30Other wizards advised their clients to dig holes inchurchyards, boil eggs in urine, and tie staves, saltand herbs in cows’ tails.31In Kent Alice Bowreman used red nettles, blue"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"cloth and certain words. In NorthumberlandMargaret Stothard put her lips to the sick child'smouth, ‘and made such chirping and sucking thatthe mother of the said child thought that she hadsucked the heart of it out, and was soreaffrighted’.32 It would be possible to draw up along list of such methods of magical cure. But themeaning of the primitive symbolism from whichthese techniques had originally sprung is verylargely lost to view. In the sixteenth century thesepractices did not reɻect a single coherentcosmology or scheme of classiɹcation, but weremade up out of the debris of many diʃerentsystems of thought.Perhaps the most distinctive feature of thecunning man's medical dealings was his readinessto diagnose a supernatural cause for the patient'smalady by saying that he was haunted by an evilspirit, a ghost, or ‘fairy’, or that he had been‘overlooked’, ‘forspoken’, or, in plainer language,bewitched. Indeed his authority in this domaingave him much of his reputation. Thus if anyinhabitant of mid-sixteenth-century Maidstonesuspected that he had been forspoken, he would gooʃ for advice to one Kiterell, a sorcerer who lived"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"at Bethersden, and specialised in such things: andwhen James Hopkinne of Hornchurch, Essex, in1576 thought that his master's cattle had beenbewitched, it was to the cunning woman, MotherPersore, that he naturally turned for help. InYorkshire in 1598 William Taylor was chargedwith sending to two wise women, Widow Haighand Widow Carr, to know a remedy for hissickness; their resolution was that he had beenbewitched.33 Many other cunning folk specializedin this area.The methods by which the wizard purported todiagnose the witchcraft were diverse. He might usea technique familiar to the lay public, such asboiling the victim's urine, or burning a piece ofthatch from the suspected witch's house to seewhether this brought her running to the scene. Hemight alternatively have recourse to a mirror, acrystal ball, a sieve and shears, a familiar spirit, orsome other method of divination.34 When JoanTyrry, who had been quick to identify witchesamong her Taunton neighbours, was called uponin 1555 to explain how she did it, she answeredsimply that she could tell because the fairies toldher.35 In York in 1594 Cuthbert Williamson"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"claimed to possess a kind of extra-sensoryperception by which he could always tell whethera client had been forspoken, for his own eyeswould run with tears if he had. Other wizardstaught that the patient was bewitched if he couldnot see his reɻection in the wise man's eyes, or ifhe could not say his prayers.36Having pronounced that the patient had beenbewitched, the cunning man had various remedies.Some of them reɻected the idea that the resourcesof the Christian religion, if properly mobilized,were suɽcient to deal with the powers ofdarkness. When in 1622 the London empiric,Robert Booker, informed a patient that he hadbeen bewitched, he anointed him with oil andpronounced a charm: ‘Three biters have bit him –heart, tongue and eye; three better shall help himpresently – God the Father, God the Son, and Godthe Holy Spirit.’ This was a standard formula, andmany examples of its use survive.37 It indicatedthe three supposed sources of witchcraft –concealed malevolence (‘heart’), bitter words(‘tongue’), and ocular fascination (‘eye’ – and itemphasized that the forces of religion were strongenough to deal with them. This was not a view"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"held in orthodox Protestant circles, and whenfound among the cunning men its Catholicaɽliations were usually obvious. Thus JoanBettyson of Nottinghamshire used to eʃect therecovery of forspoken cattle in the early 1590s byreciting fifteen Paternosters, fifteen Aves and threeCreeds – a recipé she had learned from hergrandfather. Another Nottingham sorcerer namedGroves in the early seventeenth century used tosell his clients copies of St John's Gospel as apreservative against witchcraft. The fairies'conɹdant, Joan Tyrry, prescribed herbs forbewitched persons, to be gathered to theaccompaniment of ɹve Paternosters, ɹve Aves anda Creed. In Carmarthenshire Margaret Davideʃected her cures with water and earth ‘fromJerusalem’.38Sometimes, however, the action taken bore noobvious relationship to religious beliefs at all.Witness the dramatic procedure followed byElizabeth Page in Blagdon, Somerset, in 1555.Elizabeth Wryte had asked her to cure her sickdaughter, but when the wise woman ɹrst came tosee the child she departed without oʃering anycomment. A few days later the anxious mother"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"went to her again to ask ‘if she could help her childif it were overlooked or bewitched; who answered,“Yea”’, explaining that to cure hershe must cause herself to be in as ill a case as thesaid child then was (who was then likely to die)ere that she could help her, but said that it wouldbe midnight before her husband would be fast orsound asleep and then she would take pains to riseand help the child by her means, willing thisdeponent [the mother] to take the said child intoher bed that night and about midnight her childshould recover. And even so she did. And at one ofthe clock after midnight the same child, lying bythis deponent all the night (being as it were in atrance) recovered and took sustenance. And...afterwards, when it should happen the saidElizabeth [Page] [came] at any time to see the saidchild she would openly say in the presence ofpeople, ‘This is my child, for she had been dead,and [i.e. if] I had not been.’39The whole episode is eloquent testimony to thesurvival of the concept of disease as a foreignelement which, by the appropriate procedure,"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"could be transferred from one carrier to another.The same notion underlay the practice of theLancashire charmer, Henry Baggilie, whoconfessed in 1634 to using a formula which hisfather had been taught by ‘a Dutchman’, addingthat ‘during all the time of his blessing he... hathalways been suddenly taken with sickness orlameness, and that always in the same mannerthat the man or beast that he blessed was troubledwithal.’40Closely aɽliated to the magical treatment ofdisease were the various practices designed tosafeguard the woman in child-bed. The invocationof the Virgin Mary and the use of sanctiɹed objectsat diɽcult stages of labour had been encouragedby the medieval Church and often survived theReformation. But other techniques had nevercarried any ecclesiastical blessing. The use ofgirdles and measures to relieve labour pains, theopening of chests and doors, and thepronunciation of charms and prayers, were allcommon features of the country midwife'srepertoire.41 Along with them went the belief thatthe infant's expectation of life could be divinedfrom scrutiny of the after-birth, or that good"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"fortune would accompany the child born with thecaul (or ‘sillyhow’) over its head. Even in the midseventeenth century a country gentleman mightregard his caul as a treasure to be preserved withgreat care, and bequeathed to his descendants.42There are also occasional indications of magicalattempts to control the conception of children ordetermine their sex. There were plenty ofequivalents to the powder which the sorceress,Mary Woods, admitted in 1613 to having given theCountess of Essex to wear round her neck whenshe wished to conceive.43 Less common was theclaim made in 1533 by Edith Hooker of NewAlresford, Hampshire, that she could enablewomen to conceive ‘sine virili semine’; a witnesssaid she ‘gave medicine to a certain woman tobring her with child, and the medicine was madeof the spawn of a trotter’. This may have been afolk version of the alchemical attempt to createhomunculi, reɻected in the supposed desire of theRosicrucians to beget descendants without what SirThomas Browne called ‘this trivial and vulgar wayof coition’.44 A parallel case comes from SouthLeigh, Oxfordshire, in 1520, where John Phippsand his wife were presented by the churchwardens"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"for keeping a cradle beside their bed at night andtreating it ‘as if a child was in it’.45 This wasthought by the authorities at the time to be a caseof idolatry, but it is more likely to have been anexample of sympathetic magic in which the desiredeʃect was to be produced by imitation;presumably the couple wanted a child. The relativerarity of charms to prevent conception, however,suggests that as a means of birth-control they wereless popular than the well-known, if unobtrusive,practice of coitus interruptus, and the numerouspotions and medicines to procure abortion.46As for the prior determination of sex, varioustraditions had been inherited from classicalmedicine concerning the right side of the bed to lieon to conceive a child of the desired kind. Theywere widely disseminated in such handbooks asthe popular Aristotle's Masterpiece (1684, and oftenreissued),47 but it is diɽcult to ɹnd evidence as towhether they were taken seriously. Wizards wereoccasionally asked to predict the sex of an unbornchild, and they did this by one of their routinemethods of divination, in some of which classicalinɻuence was again apparent. Few potentialmothers however, attained the virtuosity of Mrs"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"Parish, mistress of the late-seventeenth-centuryWhig politician, Goodwin Wharton, whose magicalskill was such that she knew instantaneously whenshe had conceived, conɹdently identifying thechild's sex on every occasion. She was, of course, afraud, but her lover took her claims seriously.48In this whole ɹeld there was often no cleardistinction between the use of natural remediesand supernatural or symbolic ones. Manyseventeenth-century prescriptions which seemmagical to us were in fact based on obsolescentassumptions about the physical properties ofnatural substances. When Sir Christopher Hattonsent Queen Elizabeth a ring to protect her againstthe plague or when Elias Ashmole wore threespiders to counteract the ague, they were notresorting to magic, but employing a purelyphysical form of treatment.49 No student of theperiod can fail to notice the recourse to suchobjects at every level of society. There was therattling eagle-stone (aetites) which the Countess ofNewcastle was invited to wear in 1633 to ease herlabour pains; the hare-foot which Samuel Pepys,F.R.S., slung round his neck as a cure for the colic;the moss from a dead man's skull by which the"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"eminent Nonconformist John Allin set such store;and the gold bullet which Richard Baxterswallowed to cure his chronic illness, but wasunable to get out again, until its passage wasassisted by the prayers of his despairingcongregation.50 The belief in the utility of suchobjects ultimately stemmed from ancient systemsof classiɹcation which implied the existence ofcorrespondences and analogies between diʃerentparts of creation. Even in this period there werestill many believers in the doctrine of signatures,according to which every herb was stamped with amore or less clear sign of its uses; so that, forexample, a yellow blossom indicated a likely curefor jaundice, or a root shaped like a foot became aremedy for gout.51 On such analogous reasoning itis not diɽcult to see why the aetites stone, withanother rattling inside it, should have beenthought helpful to a pregnant woman. But by theseventeenth century most of this symbolism hadbeen lost. Instead, the medicinal use of toads,pigeons, gold-rings or snake-skins had come to bejustiɹed by reference to their supposedly inherentnatural properties.A similar ambiguity surrounded the wizards’"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"practice of making both diagnosis andprognostication on the basis of the patient's urine.A handbook of 1631 assured its readers that onecould tell whether a sick man would live or die byimmersing a nettle in his water for twenty-fourhours. If the plant dried up as a result he woulddie; if it remained fresh and green he wouldlive.52 Yet learned physicians also made extensiveuse of urine, and it is hard to indicate the point atwhich the practice ceased to be natural. For thatmatter, there were many contemporaryNeoplatonist intellectuals who were even preparedto attribute a purely natural eʃect to theincantation of words and charms.The supreme example of a magical cure justiɹedby the Neoplatonist belief in occult inɻuences andsympathies was the weapon-salve, around which aɹerce controversy raged in the 1630s. The ideathat one could cure a wound by anointing theweapon which had caused it may strike us asabsurd, but the intention was not in any waymagical. By plunging the weapon into a specialointment, it was argued, one could assist the vitalspirits of the congealed blood to reunite with thevictim's body, and thus heal the wound even at a"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"distance of thirty miles. Sir Kenelm Digby's book,in which he explained how the weapon-salve curecould be accomplished ‘naturally and without anymagic’, went into twenty-nine editions. Nearlyevery country barber-surgeon knew the formula,he claimed in 1658. But at a popular level it isdoubtful whether the use of sympathetic cures wasjustiɹed on this rariɹed intellectual basis; and theycontinued to be prominent in folk medicine untilthe nineteenth century, when such rationalizationhad long been forgotten.53From the patient's point of view, indeed, allmedical prescriptions beyond his comprehensionwere in a sense magical, since they worked byoccult means. Hence the deep-rooted association ofpoison with sorcery.54 Laymen have always beenbaʀed by professional medicine and do not expectto understand the rationale behind every kind oftreatment. In the late seventeenth century SamuelButler could write of ‘A Medicine-Taker’ that ‘hebelieves a doctor is a kind of conjurer that can dostrange things and he is as willing to have himthink so’. Another contemporary observed that‘some people... send for a physician as for onethat deals in charms and can remove all their"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"aʀictions, while they are wholly passive’.According to the resident physician in 1697, eventhe pool at Bath was regarded by many as one‘that cures by miracle’.55Men did not thus discriminate very muchbetween the status of diʃerent types of cure. JohnGrave admitted going to the Essex wizard, FatherParfoothe, in 1592 for medicine for sick cattle, butdeclared that he had never thought of him as awitch; Paul Rigden confessed before theArchdeacon of Canterbury in 1598 that when hiswife fell sick he sent to one Mother Chambersbecause she was known to have done good tomany other sick persons, and not because hewanted to consult a sorceress as such.56 Very oftenthe accused wizard protested that he had onlyemployed conventional remedies. Joan Warden ofStapleford, Cambridgeshire, when charged in 1592with being a cunning woman, declared that ‘shedoth not use any charms, but that she doth useointments and herbs to cure many diseases’. Thesame plea was made by a Yorkshire woman, AliceMarton, in 1590, when she admitted to curingcattle diseases by medicine and drinks, but not bycharming.57 As the very name reminds us, a"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"cunning woman was simply a woman who knewmore than other people; it did not necessarilymean that she used supernatural remedies.In practice the presence or absence of charms asan accompaniment to the medicine became thetest of whether magic was involved; to this extent,contemporaries, however simple, knew thediʃerence between a doctor and a charmer. Buteven here there were diɽculties, for it wasnotoriously wrong to rely on natural remedieswithout God's aid, and a prayer was alwaysappropriate. In the last resort the only means oftelling whether a cure was magical or not was torefer it to the authorities – the Church, the Law,and the Royal College of Physicians. If theypermitted its employment, then no scruples needbe felt by laymen.2. Healing by touchThe one kind of magical healing to which oɽcialindulgence was liberally extended was the cure bythe royal touch. At a special religious serviceconducted by leading Anglican clergy the monarchlaid his hands upon each member of the longqueue of sufferers. The patients approached one by"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"one and knelt before the monarch, who lightlytouched them on the face, while a chaplain readaloud the verse from St Mark: ‘They shall layhands on the sick and they recover.’ They thenretired and came forward again so that the Kingmight hang round their necks a gold coin strungfrom a white silk ribbon.This was the healing ritual for the King's Evil,the name given to scrofula or struma, thetubercular inɻammation of the lymph glands ofthe neck. In practice the term was employed moreloosely to comprehend a wide variety ofcomplaints aʃecting the head, neck, and eyes,particularly swollen lips, tumours, sores andblisters. Scrofula itself was probably caused byinfected milk, and a steady stream of deaths fromthe Evil was recorded in the seventeenth-centuryLondon Bills of Mortality.58 Quite apart from thisultimate risk, the pain and unsightliness of themalady were such that suʃerers understandablywent to some trouble in their attempts to secure acure. All over the country parish authorities raisedfunds to make it possible for the aʃected to travelto London to be healed. Some of the King's clientseven came from overseas."},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"Despite its primitive aɽliations, the belief in thehealing power of the royal hand did not go back totime immemorial. The procedure was initiated byEdward the Confessor and the full ceremonial waslaid down in the reign of Henry VII. Its popularitymounted with usage. Edward I is known to havetouched over a thousand suʃerers per annum at theend of the thirteenth century, but, so far as can betold from rather inadequate sources, the healingactivities of the Plantagenet sovereigns neverreached anything like the dimensions of those ofthe later Stuarts. Charles II is known to haveministered to over 90,000 persons in the twentyyears, 1660-64 and 1667–83. The peak wasreached between May 1682 and April 1683, when8,577 entries appear in the King's Register ofHealing. The numbers were swelled by patientsreturning for a second time, but the ɹgures areimpressive testimony to the rite's appeal. Onecontemporary declared that Charles II had touched‘near half the nation’.59Adequate ɹgures do not survive for thetherapeutic activities of the previous Tudor andStuart monarchs, but there is no shortage ofevidence to indicate the steady prestige of the"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"royal touch throughout the two centuries. James Ihad scruples about taking part in what he thoughta superstitious ceremony, but he was ultimatelypersuaded to conform to the practice of hispredecessors. From 1634 the ritual of royal healingwas included in the Book of Common Prayer,where it remained until nearly the middle of theeighteenth century.60 Only in the years after the1688 Revolution did the ceremony decline, partlyas a reaction to the Roman Catholic characterwhich James II had given it by reviving the pre-Reformation liturgy. William III would havenothing to do with it; and, although the rite wasemployed by Queen Anne (whose best-knownpatient was the infant Samuel Johnson), she wasthe last English sovereign to do so. Johnson hadbeen sent to the Queen on the advice of thefamous physician, Sir John Floyer, but in theeighteenth century doctors ceased to recommendthe cure by royal touch.This did not mean, however, that there was atotal cessation in popular demand. Some peoplenow went abroad in search of a cure from theexiled Stuarts, who were glad to ɹll the vacuumcreated by the scruples of the Hanoverians and"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"their advisers. At home there was still a brisktraɽc in the touch-pieces given to the suʃerer atthe royal ceremony, and subsequently worn roundthe neck as a souvenir or a protective amulet. Aneighteenth-century cunning man in Yorkshire isknown to have prescribed as a cure for the King'sEvil a glass of water in which thirteen KingCharles I farthings had been previously boiled. AtAshburnham, Kent, a relic of Charles I waspreserved in the church and visited by suʃerersfrom scrofula as late as 1860. In Scotland somepeople attributed the healing power to QueenVictoria.61The exact status of the cure achieved by themonarch's touch was a matter of opinion. AsReginald Scot noticed, ‘Some refer [it] to theproperty of their persons, some to the peculiar giftof God, some to the eɽcacy of words.’62 It wasnever claimed that the King's Evil could not becured by natural means. Contemporary doctorsprescribed for it, as for any other complaint, andsurgeons often operated upon the aʃected part.Cures were also believed to have been eʃected bytraditional charms.63 It was only as a last resortthat the patient was advised to seek the King's aid."},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"Even then it was much disputed whether the Kinghad any healing power in his own person orwhether his role was conɹned to religiousintercession on the patient's behalf. ‘Her Majesty,’wrote Scot, ‘only useth godly and divine prayer,with some alms, and referreth the cure to God andthe physicians.’ 64But popular belief was often less moderate. Theproclamations regulating the ceremony spoke ofthe King's power to heal by his sacred touch andthe invocation of God's name, but in the reign ofCharles I the reference to the invocation of Godwas on several occasions omitted.65 Manycontemporaries clearly thought that the cure waseɽcacious without any religious ceremony at all.John Aubrey tells of the religious visionary, AriseEvans, who ‘had a fungous nose and said it wasrevealed to him that the King's hand would curehim, and at the ɹrst coming of King Charles II intoSt. James's Park he kissed the King's hand andrubbed his nose with it; which disturbed the King,but cured him’.66Even the suʃerers who took their turn at theoɽcial healings noticed that the atmosphere wasnot particularly religious in character. ‘'Tis true"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"(indeed) there are prayers read at the touching,’said John Aubrey, ‘but neither the King mindsthem nor the chaplains.’ Most of the energies ofthe participants were spent trying to avoid beingtrampled in the crush.67Some argued that the miraculous power sprangfrom the monarch's consecration with holy oil athis coronation, a rite which had survived thescruples of the early reformers.68 Thus in 1650when Mary Eure was thought to have scrofula, shewas sent to be touched by the young Louis XIV inParis, only to learn on arrival that his touch wouldhave no eʃect because he had not yet beenformally consecrated.69 But in fact the Englishkings of the seventeenth century usually began totouch from the day of their accession, withoutwaiting for any such consecration. Most peoplethus regarded the power to cure the Evil as anintrinsic quality pertaining to the sacred person ofthe monarch. By emphasizing the holy oil at thecoronation and invoking God at the healing rite,theologians tried to bring the ceremony into linewith orthodox religious beliefs. But so far as thepublic was concerned, the monarch's healingpower was an innate, mystical quality attaching to"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"his oɽce. As a Royalist supporter told Charles I in1643, it was a ‘supernatural means of cure whichis inherent in your sacred majesty’. The samebelief in the protective mystique of kingship wasreɻected in the contemporary passion for wearingroyal rings and portraits as personal talismans.70The ability to cure the Evil therefore became atouchstone for any claimant to the English throne,on the assumption that only the legitimate kingcould heal the scrofulous. Elizabeth I's healingswere cited as proof that the Papal Bull ofExcommunication had failed to take eʃect; andwere even claimed as justiɹcation for giving herambassadors diplomatic precedence over those ofSpain.71 Charles I's sacred touch made Royalistpropaganda during the aftermath of the Civil War,when people ɻocked to be touched by the captivemonarch at Holmby House, thoughtfully bringingtheir pieces of gold along with them, in view of hisimpoverished condition. His cures were cited,along with the miraculous handkerchiefs dipped inhis blood, as irrefutable testimony to the injusticeand impiety of his execution.72 Charles II begantouching while still in exile and lost no time inexploiting the political possibilities of the healing"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"power after the Restoration. Only a few days afterlanding in England he touched 600 persons in onesitting; the enormous ɹgures of suʃerers touchedsubsequently during his reign, and particularlyduring the Royalist reaction after 1681, reɻect theeʃorts of the Stuart dynasty to consolidate itselfafter the upheavals of the Interregnum. The Dukeof Monmouth predictably felt it necessary to touchthe scrofulous as part of his bid for the throne in1680, and again in 1685; just as the healing powerof the exiled dynasty became an indispensableelement in Jacobite propaganda after 1688.73 Thesupposedly personal gift of God to Edward theConfessor had thus become a lasting symbol oflegitimacy and dynastic continuity. The anointingat the coronation and the prayers at the healingceremony were subordinate in the popular mind toconsiderations of blood and status.74Magical power was also widely attributed to thepiece of gold which the King hung round thesuʃerer's neck. By the time of Charles I this haddeveloped from a mere coin given as alms into atouch-piece minted specially for the occasion. Notevery commentator considered it to be an essentialpart of the ceremony, but it was widely regarded"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"as a talisman in which the curative power wasdeposited. Mary Tudor had urged her patientsnever to part with it, and many believed that thecure would cease if they did. The parish register ofWest Worldham, Hampshire, records the death in1657 of one Mary Boyes, who had recovered fromEvil after being touched by Charles I at HamptonCourt in 1647, but ‘leaving from about her neckthe money given her at the time of her beingtouched, the disease broke out again and provedirrecoverable’.75 The talismanic characterattributed to the touch-piece was an eʃectiveanswer to the eighteenth-century cynic76 whosuggested that the main attraction of the ceremonyfor the patient was the prospect of the piece ofgold. Undoubtedly some suʃerers were quick tocash in their medals, for they were often to befound in the shops. But many others treated theobject as a precious heirloom.77Other parasitic superstitions inevitably attachedthemselves to the ceremony, such as the belief thatit was only eʃective on a Good Friday. When thecoɽn of Edward the Confessor was discovered inFebruary 1685 many bystanders took away littlebits, under the impression that they would have"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"the power to cure the Evil. During the Interregnumone surgeon even explained that he would beunable to cure the King's Evil until he possessedsome of the late King's lands, on the grounds thatthe healing power went along with them.78 Thetruth was that the religious ceremonies whichsurrounded the royal power of healing weremerely a protective framework for a moreprimitive piece of magic.Inevitably there was a steady undercurrent ofProtestant scepticism which regarded the wholeritual as superstitious humbug. A ceremony whoseauthenticity was said to derive from the miraclesof Edward the Confessor could hardly commenditself to those who, like the Puritan MrsHutchinson, regarded that monarch as ‘thesuperstitious prince, who was sainted for hisungodly chastity’.79 Puritan hostility to theceremony found open expression during the CivilWar, when the republican Henry Marten excitedscandalized comment by cheerfully remarkingthat, in the absence of Charles I, the Great Seal ofParliament might be used instead to heal thescrofulous.80 The resort of suʃerers to the captiveKing in 1647 led Parliament to set up a committee"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"to prepare a declaration ‘concerning thesuperstition of being touched for the healing of theKing's Evil’, and the soldiers who guarded Charles Iirreverently gave him the pet name of ‘Stroker’.81The public execution of the King marked, amongso many other things, the formal repudiation ofthe belief that any magical power attached to hisperson. In the freer atmosphere of theProtectorate, Francis Osborne could openly assertin his popular, though iconoclastic, Advice to a Sonthat the cure by the royal touch was ‘altogether...improbable to sense’. In the following century theQuaker, William Stout, whose sister had beentouched by Charles II, saw it as ‘but the remains ofa popish ceremony’, which, he wrongly supposed,had gone out with James II.82Political considerations, however, always limitedthe public expression of scepticism. It had been allvery well for James I to remark privately that,since miracles had ceased, the whole ritual must besuperstitious. But free thought on the part of anordinary citizen could be a dangerous luxury. ThePresbyterian minister, Thomas Rosewell, foundhimself on trial for treasonable utterances in 1684after (inter alia) allegedly casting aspersions on the"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"reality of the royal healing power.83 But therelative absence of explicit scepticism of this kindin contemporary literature suggests that self-conscious disbelief in the royal cure may havealways been conɹned to an educated or anti-Royalist minority. Certainly the execution ofCharles I created an undoubted vacuum whichmany rival healers thought it worth rushing to ɹll.A blacksmith in Cromhall, Gloucestershire, claimedto have performed some successful cures of the Eviland was recommended in 1648 to suʃerers inother parts of the country. Another healerfunctioned at Newgate in London.84 In YorkshireDr Robert Ashton claimed ‘a revelation since thelate King's decease to heal the Evil’, and carriedout a monthly healing ceremony, clad in a longwhite garment, laying his hands on the suʃerersand pronouncing ‘some form of prayers like acharm’.85 Of the sectarians who claimed a divinegift to heal the Evil the most notable was GeorgeFox, who was said in 1659 to have cured a scrofulavictim by touch; but, when William III allowed theceremony to lapse, the Hertfordshire Baptistsclaimed that a shepherd had been cured of theEvil, merely by attending one of their services.86"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"In normal times, indeed, many Puritans andDissenters were ready to submit themselves to theroyal ministrations. The Quakers formallyacknowledged the eɽcacy of the King's touch inan address to James II in 1687.87The touch for scrofula was not the only form ofroyal healing. Until the accession of Elizabeth I,the monarch had also participated in a ceremonydesigned to bring relief to suʃerers from epilepsyand associated diseases. At ɹrst the money oʃeredby the King at his devotions on Good Friday wasredeemed by a sum of the same amount so that theoriginal coins might be converted into rings to beworn by epileptics. In due course the pretence ofgiving money was abandoned and the rings weresimply hallowed by the King at a special ceremonyin which they were rubbed between his ɹngers andthen distributed to the suʃerers. These ‘cramp-rings’, as they were called, were not the only typeof ring worn by patients seeking a magical curefor the falling sickness, but they were the ones towhich most prestige attached. They were employednot only against epilepsy, but also to ward oʃconvulsions, rheumatism and muscular spasms.Their hallowing was well established by the reign"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"of Edward II and continued without a break untilthe death of Mary Tudor. They were very popularin the early sixteenth century and some were evenexported to the continent of Europe.88The ceremony reɻected the old idea that anymoney retrieved from the church oʃertory had amagical value; there had been many medievalrecipes for making magic rings out of churchoʃerings. What happened between the fourteenthand sixteenth centuries was that the monarchydeliberately commandeered the older belief inorder to build up the supernatural status ofkingship. The monarch, whose participation hadoriginally been superɻuous, was given ɹrst asecondary role in the ceremony and then aprimary one. In the ɹnal, Marian, version of theritual the eɽcacy of the cramp-rings was explicitystated to come from being rubbed by royal hands,sanctiɹed by the unction of holy oil. Their powerwas thus derived ultimately from God, but inpractice all the prestige attached itself to hisrepresentative on earth, the rings being producedready-made to be implanted with a supernaturalquality by the monarch.

Protestant scruplespresumably lay behind the change, though there islittle direct evidence on this point,90 and it isnoticeable that the pious young Edward VI hadshown no such inhibition once the ceremony hadbeen shorn of its Roman appurtenances. InCatholic circles some nostalgia for the old ritelingered. In the mid seventeenth century aHereford goldsmith was brought consecratedshillings by Papists who wanted him to makecramp-rings out of them. James II may even haveplanned the reintroduction of the ceremony, for inhis reign the old order of service was resurrectedand issued in print, as a ballon d'essai, though theRevolution prevented matters being taken anyfurther.91The claim to heal by touch was not unique to"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"kings. Touching or stroking was a common part ofthe curative ritual followed by cunning men andwomen. Yet they were harried by the church courtsand accused of magic and witchcraft. There was,as John Donne remarked, a certain irony aboutthis situation, when the King of England waspublicly practising the same methods. Indeed adebate between two controversialists on thepropriety of the weapon-salve was only ended, itwas said, when ‘authority (to vindicate the usualcure of the King's Evil from being an operation ofthe Devil) did step in betwixt them’.92 Like theKing, the cunning folk usually accompanied thetouch with the pronunciation of a prayer or charm.But sometimes they expected it to workunaccompanied. In 1624 a healer oʃered to curethe deranged Lord Purbeck, brother of James I'sDuke of Buckingham, by merely touching thepatient's head. A decade later the Royal College ofPhysicians apprehended a weaver, ChristopherBarton, who professed to cure diseased scalps bylaying on hands. In 1647 a letter-writer reportedthe activities of Anne Jeʃeries, a young girl inCornwall who could cure suʃerers from brokenbones or epilepsy by the mere touch of her"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"hand.93These healers by touch usually fell into one oftwo categories. There were those who werepresumed to have been personally endowed withmiraculous power by God or some other mysticalsource, and there were those who owed their giftsto their peculiar social position. Of these latter themost obvious were the so-called seventh sons, or,better still, seventh sons of seventh sons. Theorigin of the peculiar aura attached to thesegenealogical freaks is diɽcult to uncover.Although widely disseminated over Europe inmodern times, the idea was not to be found beforethe sixteenth century and in England was rarebefore the beginning of the seventeenth.94 But by1700 a number of such healers had achievedprominence, and there must have been many morewho left no record behind them.Usually their activities only came to lightbecause the authorities saw them as a threat to theroyal monopoly of the power to heal the King'sEvil by touch alone. The government of Charles Iwas particularly sensitive on this score and severaltimes intervened to check the lèse-majesté of rivalhealers. In 1632 a Frenchman, Boisgaudre,"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"prisoner in the King's Bench, was examined beforethe Lord Chief Justice for taking it upon himself tocure the Evil. His method was to spit on his handsand rub the patient's sores, making the sign of thecross, and giving the suʃerer a paper to hanground his neck on which was inscribed In nomineJesu Christi, ipse sanetur. He was said to have beendealing with up to 140 cases a day, and to havebeen paid twenty-ɹve shillings by one client, justfor a glass of water. No doubt Boisgaudre, who hadbeen imprisoned for debt, was taking practicalsteps to improve his fortunes. But he claimed tohave cured 200 people, and attributed his successto being the youngest of seven sons.95Five years later the Royal College of Physicianswas ordered by the Privy Council to investigate thecase of James Leverett, another alleged seventhson (actually a fourth), who healed the Evil andother ailments by touching his patients anddeclaring, in obvious imitation of the royalceremony, ‘God bless; I touch; God heals.’ He wasalso said to have made disparaging references tothe healing sessions of his rival Charles I, and tohave boasted that the very sheets in which he sleptwould subsequently have the power to cure"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"diseases. The Privy Council had him whipped andsent to Bridewell.96 Another case in 1637 was thatof Richard Gilbert, seventh son of a Somersethusbandman, who had established a record bybeginning his career as a ‘stroker’ when one dayold. Now aged ɹve, he was holding healingsessions every Monday at his home, where hetouched suʃerers from wens, swellings and theEvil, declaring sanctimoniously, ‘I touch; Godheals.’ In this case the child's grandmother seemsto have been responsible for initiating theprocedure. But her motives were honest enough.No fees were charged, and the only proɹt went tothe local inns, which were crowded with persons ofquality who came to witness the healing.97All these cases were concerned with the King'sEvil. But there were other seventh sons whosehealing gifts were less specialised. In 1607 aseventh son who healed the deaf, blind and lamewas investigated and found incompetent by theBishop of London. In 1623 sixteen persons weredealt with by the Archdeacon of Nottingham forgoing to be stroked by ‘the wise boy at Wisall’.Probably soon afterwards ‘the boy of Godlyman’(Godalming), the seventh son of a ɹddler,"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"embarked on a similar career of stroking the sick;both he and his patients were required to fastduring the healing process, a common procedureamong miraculous healers. At the end of thecentury a little boy at Brinkley, Cambridgeshire,also a seventh son, was performing cures upon theblind, lame and deaf.98 Such healing powers werethought to extend to seventh daughters as well assons, and to include powers of foresight. The beliefretained its vigour in rural areas as late as thenineteenth century.99The seventh sons derived their healing powerfrom the accident of birth, as did the royal healersand those who imitated them; for example, JamesMiddleton, a wandering north-countryman,apprehended at Lichɹeld in 1587, who declaredhimself to be a Stuart, sprung from a line ofScottish kings, and endowed with a special powerto heal the falling sickness.100 But others claimed,regardless of their genealogical origins, to havebeen directly empowered by God to eʃectwonderful cures, sometimes of a particular disease,more commonly of all kinds of malady. Suchclaimants were particularly prominent among thesects of the Interregnum, as we have seen.101 But"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"the Catholics also had their miraculous healers. Aman named Blake, believed to be a priest orJesuit, arrived at the Mitre Hotel, Oxford, in July1663 and attempted to cure the sick and lame bypronouncing Latin words and making the sign ofthe cross over them. At Chester in the followingmonth he drew large crowds and claimed to havecast a devil out of a possessed woman. Earlier hehad performed at a public ceremony (tickets only)in the Queen's chapel in St James's, where, to theaccompaniment of Catholic ritual, he tied ribbonsround his patients' necks.102 The resemblance tothe royal healing ceremony must have beenembarrassingly close; and it formed a suitableprologue to the subsequent arrival of Blake'sfellow-countryman, Valentine Greatrakes, the mostfamous occult healer of the seventeenth century.Greatrakes was an Irish gentleman who hadserved in Cromwell's army. Shortly after theRestoration he was informed by a mysteriousimpulse that he had the gift to cure the King's Evilby touching. Responding to this divine injunction,he found to his surprise that his stroking worked,and he embarked upon a career as a healer, laterextending his operations to the ague and other"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"diseases. After building up a reputation in Ireland,where his patients included the astronomerFlamsteed, he was brought over in 1666 to Ragley,Warwickshire, to try his hand at curing the chronicheadaches of Anne, Viscountess Conway. Thisproved beyond his power (although he had beenable to cure his own), but his reputation attractedhundreds of miscellaneous suʃerers upon whom heperformed a number of successful cures.Championed by many of the leading intellectualsof the day, including the Cambridge Platonists,More, Cudworth and Whichcote, and the scientistsRobert Boyle and John Wilkins, he was brought intriumph to London, where he healed manymembers of the crowd who besieged his lodgings.But he failed in a demonstration before Charles IIand his court, and in May 1666, only ɹve monthsafter his arrival, returned to Ireland to resume hislife as a J.P. and country squire.103This brief episode attracted enormous publicattention, for, despite his many failures,Greatrakes appeared to have cured a sizeableproportion of his clientele. He had, moreover, noɹnancial motive for imposture, since he made nocharge for his services, other than travel expenses."},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"As far as he was concerned, his was a miraculouspower directly bestowed by God. Thisinterpretation was unattractive to those Protestantdivines whose habit it was to maintain that allmiracles had ceased. They preferred to seek theexplanation in the healer's physiology, looking forsome inherent quirk which gave his body a natural‘sanative contagion’, as Henry More put it.Pursuing this line of inquiry, George Rust, Dean ofConnor, convinced himself that Greatrake's urinesmelled of violets.104 But others threw doubt uponthe eɽcacy of his cures, or regarded him as aconjuror, dependent upon diabolical assistance.‘However it looks at London, it was laughed at inthe University,’ recalled a Cambridgecorrespondent in 1676.105Greatrakes's own motives are unfathomable. Healmost certainly believed what he said aboutdivine impulses and seems to have had a genuinelyobsessive impulse to cure. It is highly probable thathis healing career, which had after all begun withtouching for the King's Evil, was a veiled sectarianprotest against the Restoration and the miraculouspowers claimed by Charles II.

It could be rationalizedto ɹt Galenic medical theory according to whichthe excess humours needed to be evacuated inorder to restore the body to equilibrium. Theconventional methods of re-establishing thisbalance were purging, vomiting and bloodletting.But stroking could be represented as a magneticmeans of easing the evil humours down throughthe limbs and out through the extremities.

His power was deemed to spring froman innate quality, sometimes conventionallydescribed as a gift of God, but essentially aninherent capacity, pertaining either to the healer'soɽce (as in the case of the King), to hisgenealogical status (as with the seventh sons), orto his inexplicable mana (as with Greatrakes andmany of the cunning men).3. The efficacy of magical healingIt can thus be seen that a wide variety of methodsof mystical healing were available in Tudor andStuart England. But how eʃective were they, andwhy was it that so many patients were prepared tosubmit themselves to their ministrations?"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"Great claims were made for the healing value ofthe royal touch. The surgeon, Richard Wiseman,testiɹed to having witnessed hundreds of cures,and asserted that Charles II healed more suʃerersin one year ‘than all the surgeons of London haddone in an age’.110But allowance must be madefor the obsequious royalism behind such remarks.Most contemporary claims for the success of theroyal miracle evaporate upon closer inspection. Itsoɽcial defenders never suggested that the royalhand was infallible or that its eʃects wereinstantaneous. Most of the ‘cures’ seem to haveoccurred after an interval of time, and may bereasonably attributed to the tendency of somekinds of glandular tuberculosis to healspontaneously.111 Others involved one of thesuperɹcial maladies which were customarilyincluded under the label of the King's Evil: nearlyall instances of ‘sore eyes’, for example, weredeemed suitable for admission to the royalceremony.The minority of apparent cures of the scrofulawere put down by rationalist contemporaries tothe effects of the imagination. ‘Physicians,’ wrote apamphleteer, ‘do attribute the cause more to the"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"parties' imagination than to the virtue of thetouch.’112 In the case of scrofula this diagnosisseems implausible. But many of the associatedconditions may well have been hysterical in originand hence open to the possibility of spectacularcure. The uplifting eʃects of the religiousceremony, the nervous excitement felt in thepresence of the King, upon whom they hadperhaps never previously set eyes, the washing oftheir limbs by the surgeons before they wereadmitted to the royal presence – all these factors,acting individually or in combination, may wellhave been suɽcient to eʃect a cure upon thosesuʃerers whose condition did not spring from anyreal organic disorder. Moreover, scrofula tended tobe periodic in its manifestations and thus to give atemporary appearance of being cured; thesubsequent return of the symptoms would bedeemed a ‘relapse’, for which the patient's failureto go on wearing his touch-piece might oftenconstitute an acceptable explanation.In such ways a reputation of the royal touchcould be sustained in the face of repeated failure.The example of Lourdes reminds us that oneapparent cure will eʃace the memory of a hundred"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"failures. Faith in the royal touch did not arise froma systematic examination of the medical historiesof all those who had submitted to its ministrations.It lay rather in the public's disposition to believe inthe possibility of such a miracle, a dispositionwhich sprang from a mystical view of kingshipand of the monarch's place in society. Itwas this attitude which produced the reputedhealings, not the healings which inculcated theattitude. In the words of the great French historianof the King's Evil:What created faith in the miracle was the ideathat there should be a miracle. It was this idea toowhich allowed it to survive, plus, as the centuriespassed, the accumulated testimony of generationswho had believed and whose evidence, founded itseemed upon experience, one could not doubt. Asfor the cases, numerous enough by all accounts, inwhich the Evil resisted the touch of these augustɹngers, they were soon forgotten. Such is thehappy optimism of believing souls.113Faith in the royal miracle, thought Marc Bloch,was the result of a collective error, arising from a"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"belief in the supernatural character of kingship.This belief had its social advantages, for itprevented the monarch from being too closelyidentiɹed with any one section of his subjects, byraising him to a mystical plane from which hemight symbolise the unity of them all.114 Inseventeenth-century England this mystique wasdiminishing. Patriarchal adoration of the sovereignwas challenged by a frank republican scepticism,exempliɹed in the increasingly common assertionthat ‘kings were but men as other men’.115 Faithin the royal healing power was thus linked to adecaying political attitude: the belief that royalblood had its unique characteristics, and a specialgenealogy extending back to Noah. Kings were notas other mortals, but were accountable to Godalone. But the decline of the doctrine of DivineRight and the triumph of the Hanoverian dynastymeant the end of royal miracles. Men did not lookfor them, and therefore they did not happen.The special status of the monarch helps toexplain the prestige of his healing power.

Wizards' fees variedconsiderably, but they usually comparedfavourably with those charged by contemporarydoctors. ‘Their reward,’ said one authority, ‘is...what people commonly will give them; some takemore, some take but little, often nothing, andsome may not take any thing at all, as some haveprofessed that if they should take anything theycould do no good.’ There may have been many‘blessers’ like Mary Shaw, a Lancashire tailor'swife, who took no money, ‘but what they wouldgive her of goodwill’, or Henry Baggilie, who only‘received meal or cheese or commodities of the likenature, but never did take silver or any otherreward’.116 Charms and prayers, moreover,compared favourably with the attentions of mostcontemporary doctors. A painless remedy seemedattractive beside the prospect of surgery or aroutine of purges and vomits. The royal touch hadsimilarly been far preferable to the painfulcauterization which physicians recommended forthe Evil.The stubborn reluctance of the lower sections ofthe seventeenth-century population to forgo theircharmers and wise men resembles the"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"unwillingness of some primitive peoples today torely exclusively upon the newly introducedWestern medicine.

They cherish thedramatic side of magical healing, the ritual acting-out of sickness, and the symbolic treatment ofdisease in its social context. Primitivepsychotherapy, in particular, can comparefavourably with its modern rivals.117 If this is truetoday, when medical technique has made suchstriking advances, we can hardly wonder at theattitude of seventeenth-century villagers, whenmedical therapy still proceeded along itstraditional paths of purging and blood-letting.There is little more reason for asking why thewizards were able to retain their prestige than forinquiring how it was that the pretensions ofGalenic physicians remained so long unchallenged.Nevertheless, the reputation enjoyed by thecunning men is at ɹrst sight remarkable. ‘There"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"are divers and sundry kinds of maladies,’ it wassaid, ‘which though a man do go to all thephysicians that can be heard of, yet he shall ɹndno remedy; whereas sometimes they are cured bythose which are called cunning folks.’ AnneBodenham, the old Wiltshire witch, declaredoutright that her remedies ‘could cure such diseasesas the best doctors could not do’.118 We cannotnow test the veracity of such stories as that of thewizard in Wells who cured over a hundred peopleof the ague, merely by giving them a paper towear, with ‘abracadabra’ written on it in the formof an acrostic,119 but we do know that manyintelligent contemporaries believed that suchremedies really worked. ‘We see commonly thetoothache, gout, falling sickness, biting of a maddog and many such maladies cured by spells,words, characters and charms,’ remarked RobertBurton, the Anatomist.120 It was not only theignorant who were clients of the cunning men,and they were often protected by men in highplaces.121 Indeed the best testimony to theirsuccess was provided by some of the very personswho were most anxious to harry them out of theland. Many theologians stressed the wickedness of"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"magical cures, but not their futility. ‘Not onlycankers,’ admitted William Fulke, ‘but also ɹstulas,toothache, and many other diseases have beenhealed by charms.’122In accounting for this reputation, some weightshould be given to the practical remedies whichwere sometimes combined with magical ones.Cunning men could identify ordinary maladies andprescribe medicine for them.123 They could drawupon the extensive and sometimes genuine herb-lore which had been accumulated over thecenturies. Their sympathetic cures kept the woundfree from harmful ointment and allowed it tomake a natural recovery.124 Greatrakes evenwent in for a certain amount of amateur surgery,lancing tumours and squeezing out the matter. Asso often among primitive peoples, magic andtechnique were simultaneously employed. Fraudmight also help, as in the case of the Venetianphysician in London in the reign of Edward VIwho was confronted with an unconscious patient;well aware that the man was in no real danger hedeclared he would perform a miracle by raisinghim from the dead, and duly did so.125"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"Weight should also be attached to the naturaltendency of the human body to rid itself of trivialmaladies without outside help. Many of thecomplaints miraculously ‘cured’ by the cunningmen were of the kind which time alone could heal– fevers, earache, warts, open wounds. Apparentsuccess in such spheres undoubtedly helped toconceal failures in the face of more deadlyinfections to which the body could oʃer noresistance. Signiɹcantly, there was seldom anysuggestion that a cunning man could cure a victimof the plague, though he might be able to give hima charm or amulet which would prevent him fromcatching it.When failure was unavoidable the belief inwitchcraft provided a ready excuse. By informingtheir clients that they had been ‘overlooked’ or‘forspoken’, the cunning men could imply that ifonly the disease had been natural they would havebeen able to cure it. Even the Catholic who heldcharming sessions at St James's in 1664 wasprepared to fall back on this.126 In this way thewizard's procedure could be virtually foolproof.For if the patient recovered it was a tribute to thecunning man's perception, and if he died then the"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"witch was to blame. By submitting himself to thecunning man's ministrations the patient wasforging bonds from which there was no escape. AsRichard Bernard remarked of wizards, ‘it is foundby daily experience that those which most usethem most need them’.127But of all the factors sustaining the cunningman's reputation the greatest was the appeal of hisremedies to his client's mind. Many amateurhealers can achieve a reasonable degree of successwhen dealing with patients whose symptoms aresomatic, yet without any organic pathology. Twomodern doctors have shrewdly pointed out that‘what Greatrakes did was to realise intuitively thatvarious somatic aches, pains, dysfunctions orpareses occur in the absence of organic disease’.He healed his patients through their minds ratherthan through their bodies, and his methodsanticipated the practice of Mesmer, Charcot andsubsequent students of psychosomatic illness.128The cunning man's greatest asset was his client'simagination; and, in view of what is known todayabout the potentialities of any cure in which bothdoctor and patient have complete faith, its powercannot be disregarded."},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"The scientiɹc study of the role of suggestion inhealing has only recently begun, but the results arealready suɽciently startling to make historianschary about discounting the genuine potency ofseventeenth-century healers who worked only withspells and charms.

Indeed the success rate of the placebo is insome cases demonstrably as great as that of thegenuine drug.129This raises the importance of faith in therapy toa point which can only shock the layman,accustomed to thinking of medicine as somethingdirected to the body rather than the mind.

The seventeenth-centurycharmer, operating in a Christian environment,believing personally in his methods, andaccompanying them by an intimidating ritual, wasthus ideally equipped to achieve results. In thelight of modern research into the medical role offaith and imagination it seems that his claim toeʃect healing by touch, by command, byincantation, or even by action at a distance, mustbe taken seriously.Intelligent contemporaries were well aware ofthis therapeutic power of the imagination and itsimportance for the sorcerer. They noticed that the"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"cunning man required willing cooperation from hispatients: ‘These witches profess that they cannotheal such as do not believe in them,’ said RichardBernard;130 and they keenly explored theevidence suggesting that therapy directed to themind could heal the body. ‘As some are... molestedby fantasy,’ wrote Robert Burton, ‘so some againby fancy alone and a good conceit are as easilyrecovered... there is no virtue in charms or cures,but a strong conceit and opinion.’ Francis Baconalso accepted the healing power of ‘miracle-working faith’, while Dr Edward Jorden, one of themost perceptive contemporary writers onwitchcraft, observed, when discussing the medicalvalue of such remedies as charms, amulets andholy water, that any success they might have wasto be attributed, not to inherent supernaturalvirtue, but to ‘the conɹdent persuasion whichmelancholic and passionate people may have inthem’.131 Opinions of this kind were supported bysome devastating anecdotes, of which one retoldby Denis Granville, who was Dean of Durham,1684–91, was typical: a French doctor had apatient who was convinced that he was possessedby the Devil. The doctor called in a priest and a"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"surgeon, meanwhile equipping himself with a bagcontaining a live bat. The patient was told that itwould take a small operation to cure him. Thepriest oʃered up prayer, and the surgeon made aslight incision in the man's side. Just as the cut wasgiven, the doctor let the bat ɻy into the room,crying, ‘Behold, there the devil is gone!’ The manbelieved it and was cured.132If anything, the concept of psychosomaticdisease was wider in the seventeenth century thanit is now, for contemporary intellectuals tended toexaggerate the powers of the imagination. Theythought that epidemics were more likely to strikethe fearful, and they believed that a pregnantwoman could shape the unborn foetus by herthoughts.133 Such notions were reinforced bycontemporary Neoplatonism, but they also drewstrength from the numerous instances ofpsychosomatic healing in an age when thepotentialities open to purely physical remedieswere very limited.Sometimes, however, the charmer could cure thesceptic as well as the credulous. Arthur Wilson, awell-educated writer, records how, when strickenwith the ague while travelling in France in the"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"early seventeenth century, he consulted a Gasconmiller, who cured him with a charm, as he hadcured many others. Wilson's account of thisepisode reveals his genuine perplexity. Hisimagination was not responsible, for he did notbelieve beforehand in the miller's powers. Could itbe that the man's eyes had some mystic power, orthat mere characters written on a paper couldhave some occult virtue? Satan could hardly havebeen responsible, for the miller was a devoutHuguenot. The result left him baʀed.134 Thereare many such cases in which the client is knownto have approached the cunning man without anyparticular conɹdence in his methods, but rather inthe spirit of try-anything-once. The most plausibleexplanation for their outcome is that, in acredulous age, even the sceptic may have arepressed will to believe, which under propitiouscircumstances can break out of captivity; just asthe normally reasonable man may sometimes beovercome by the overwhelming inɻuence of acrowded revivalist meeting.

Ofthe others the most common seems to have beenthe detection of theft and the recovery of stolengoods, a matter for which society made very littlealternative provision. In such cases the wizardwould proceed by employing one of the severalpossible methods of divination to determine who itwas had stolen the missing goods.A common formula was that of the sieve and the"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"shears:Stick a pair of shears in the rind of a sieve andlet two persons set the top of each of theirforeɹngers upon the upper part of the shearsholding it with the sieve up from the groundsteadily; and ask Peter and Paul whether A, B, or Chath stolen the thing lost; and at the nominationof the guilty person the sieve will turn round.1This procedure did not call for any special qualitieson the part of the persons operating it, and wasnot the sole prerogative of the cunning men, butavailable to anyone who happened to know thetechnique. Thus in 1554 William Hasylwoode, acleric, confessed before the Commissary's Court ofLondon thathaving... lost a purse with fourteen groats in thesame, and thereupon remembering that he being achild did hear his mother declare that when anyman had lost anything then they would use a sieveand a pair of shears to bring to knowledge whohad the things lost,... so [he took] a sieve and apair of shears and hanged the sieve by the point of"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"the shears and said these words, ‘By Peter andPaul, he hath it’, naming the person whom he inthat behalf suspected.Similarly in 1598 John Casson admitted to theArchdeacon of Nottingham thatabout three quarters of a year since, a wetherbeing lost in their parish there was a device usedto know what was become of the said wether bytaking a sieve and a pair of shears and saying, ‘Inthe name of the Father and of the Son and of theHoly Ghost’, after which words the sieve wouldturn about – which device he and his sister... oncewithout any ill intent tried.In 1641 a labourer's wife appeared beforeLancashire Quarter Sessions for using the sieve andshears to ɹnd out who had stolen a sheep and ahen, and to ascertain whether two local womenwere with child.2 The technique was simple tograsp, required nothing out of the ordinary in theway of equipment, and was widely employed.3Another version of the same principle was"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"divination by a key and book (the latter usuallybeing a psalter or Bible). Again a very simpleprocedure was followed. A key was placed at achosen point in the book. The names of possiblesuspects were then written on separate pieces ofpaper and inserted one after another in the hollowend of the key. When the paper bearing the nameof the thief was put in, the book would ‘wag’ andfall out of the ɹngers of those who held it.4 Aversion of this technique was employed by WilliamNewport, vicar of St Owen's, Gloucester, in 1551.According to witnesses, the clergyman inserted thekey and tied the book up with string. He theninvoked the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, biddingthe key to turn when he reached the name of theguilty party. It turned when he pronounced thename of Margaret Greenhill; and the participantsthen left the chancel of the church, where the ritualhad been carried out, to search the suspect's bed-straw for the missing objects.5 This divination bykey and book had been well known in the MiddleAges and was still current in many rural areas inthe nineteenth century.6A third way of isolating the guilty party from alist of suspects was to wrap up the pieces of paper"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"bearing their names inside little clay balls, and putthem into a bucket of water to see which wouldunroll ɹrst. This too had many variants.7 Thecunning men, however, were often equipped withmore sophisticated techniques. Some purported tooperate by astrology and would produce adescription of the thief after setting a ɹgure.Others engaged in geomancy – interpreting themeaning of the pattern of dots produced by therandom doodlings of the wizard in a state of semi-trance. Yet others used mirrors or crystal balls inwhich the client would be asked if he couldperceive the features of the guilty party. John Deehad a crystal for this purpose, ‘as big as an egg:most bright, clear and glorious’.8 A small boy'sthumbnail, polished up, might be similarlyemployed; or even a bucket of water.9Elaborate rituals of a semi-religious kind mightaccompany such divination. One wizard explainedin 1631 that ‘any man going about to ɹnd outstolen goods doth it with great diɽculty, withfasting and praying three days together and greatpains taken therein’.10 Aubrey tells of aHerefordshire clothier who, after enduring manythefts of cloth from his racks, went out about"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"midnight with his crystal, taking a little boy or girlwith him as a scryer (‘for they say it must be apure virgin’) to look into the crystal and see thelikeness of the thief.11 Crystal-gazing of this kindwas, of course, only one stage removed from thedeliberate invocation of spirits. A west countrycunning man, John Walsh, confessed in 1566 thatin order to discover lost goods he employed afamiliar who would appear sometimes in the shapeof a pigeon, sometimes in that of a dog, sometimesin that of a man with cloven feet. When WilliamLawse, clerk, of Halden, Kent, found his cattleinjured and corn stolen in 1610, he repaired toWilliam Childes, a weaver at Bethersden, to ɹndout who was responsible. Following the directionsin a conjuring book, they drew a large chalk circleon the ɻoor in which they wrote certain Latinwords. A third member of the party was requiredto read aloud from the Psalms, while Childesdeclaimed ‘I exorcise and conjure thee.’ Despitethis intimidating procedure no spirit appeared. Butwhen a servant was blamed in 1662 for the theftof goods from the Greyhound Inn, Blandford,Dorset, he went oʃ to a conjurer, who with the aidof an evil spirit identiɹed the real thief andmiraculously produced him from ɹfty miles"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"away.12Once the identity of the thief had been thusrevealed the clients showed no hesitation aboutpursuing the matter.I pray you, good man Fakques [said anaggrieved Londoner in 1510] let me have mymoney, for ye have my money, the which I lost,and that was taken from and conveyed out of mybowchett [purse], for ye have it as it is shewed meby a soothsayer. For he shews me that there was aman in our company that hath a blemish in hisface which he saith has it, and there was none butyou that hath any such token, and therefore I prayyou let me have it, for you be he that has it.13The public's faith was not always as ingenuousas this, and there were clients who prudentlydeferred their payment of the wizard's fee until hisidentiɹcation proved to be correct.14 But until atleast the later seventeenth century the verdict of avillage wizard on questions of theft or similarcrimes was a matter of some consequence. Oɽcersof the law are known to have apprehended thesupposed culprit on the basis of such"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"identiɹcations; indeed it was sometimes thoughtworth bribing a cunning man so as to secure anarrest.15Such methods of thief-detection were by nomeans as futile as they may look. It was commonto most of them that the search for the thief didnot begin in a void, but took the form ofscrutinizing a list of suspects supplied by theclient. All the cunning man had to do was toisolate the guilty one. It is more than likely that hesaw his main task as that of discovering theidentity of the party whom the the client himselfmost strongly suspected. This is certainly thepractice of the modern African diviner, whoseactivities, as observed by social anthropologists,seem to bear a strong resemblance to those of theEnglish cunning man. Almost all African diviningmethods, it has been pointed out, are open tomanipulation on the part of the diviner, who ‘issuccessful because he reveals what his inquirerhopes he will reveal’.16 However intricate thedivinatory procedure, it always leaves room forsubjective judgement and interpretation on thepart of the wizard. During the séance he ‘smellsout’ the answer to the problem, with the aid of"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"leading questions and a clear series of indicationsfrom his audience as to whether or not he is on theright track. Almost invariably the client has adeɹnite suspect in mind, but one for whose guiltconventional evidence is lacking. The diviner'stask is to conɹrm these suspicions and thus enablethe client to act upon a view he had alreadyreached before the consultation began.17On this analogy with African diviners it seemsprobable that the cunning man, sensitive to thereactions of the audience, was very likely to ɹndthe sieve or key turning when he pronounced thename of the party whom his clients mostlystrongly suspected. If, as often happened, theinjured person, trembling with excitement andindignation, carried out the procedure himself, asimilar result was even more probable. That this isnot mere conjecture is shown by the observationsof Thomas Gataker, the seventeenth-centurypreacher, who remarked how,when using the sieve and shears, and namingmany whom they think good to question, butamong those many strongly suspecting some one,the strong imagination of those, or one of those,"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"that hold it between them (though no wilful sleightotherwise be interposed by either of them) may bea means suɽcient to work an insensible motion inthe hand of the holder so strongly possessed for theturning of the sieve and shears upon the naming ofthe parties by him or them formerly suspected.The prose is clumsy, but the diagnosis goes to theheart of the matter.18On this interpretation, therefore, the object ofthe divining séance was not so much to establishthe identity of the thief, for that was often knownalready, as to stiʃen the client's determination toaccuse him. What the wizard did was to provide anapparently independent conɹrmation of theoriginal suspicions. This is well illustrated by theingenuous admission of a witness in 1590 that hehad come to realise that the Hertfordshire cunningman, Thomas Harding, was a fraud, because hehad refused to accuse any of the persons hesuspected of ɹring his house, even after he hadpointed them out to him.19 The crystal ball wasequally capable of conɹrming existing suspicions.The client was invited to inspect the glass to see ifhe could recognize the features of the man"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"revealed there, and usually did.20 Alternatively,the cunning man described the vision as it tookshape and waited for the customer's reactions. Ineither case the operation performed the samefunction. The solemnity with which the experimentwas conducted did not so much provide the clientwith new evidence as help him to know his ownmind.As a reconstruction of the actual consultationsheld by the magical thief-detectors of our periodthis picture may seem hypothetical. But theanalogy with the practice of the African diviners isconsistent with what evidence has survived. Thuswhen Thomas Nottingham, a ɹfteenth-centurypriest-magician, was called in by a Norwich citizento identify Agnes Watts as a thief he made themistake of accusing another woman altogether,until his client whispered in his ear that Agnes wasthe guilty one, whereupon the book and keyconɹrmed the accusation.21 Such divination wasnotoriously open to manipulation: there was, forexample, a way of wrapping the clay around thepaper bearing the name of the guilty party so as toensure that it would be the ɹrst to open when putin water.22 It would be wrong to imply that all"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"diviners were disingenuous or that all clients had adeɹnite suspect in mind. But the ability of theseprocedures to conɹrm suspicions already formeddid much to sustain their prestige.A second feature of this thief-magic was itstendency to intimidate the guilty. This too is acommon aspect of divination among primitivepeoples. An ordeal is devised which all suspectsmust undergo on the assumption that, whereas theinnocent parties will remain unharmed, the guiltywill suʃer excruciating torment. This had been afeature of the judicial ordeal, familiar in Englanduntil 1215, when the Church refused to continue itssanction of the procedure. Of the many types ofordeal the four most common had been the hotiron, which the victim was required to carry; theboiling water, into which he plunged his hand; the‘holy morsel’ of consecrated bread and cheese,which he was expected to swallow if innocent andchoke on if guilty; and the cold water in which hewas immersed and would sink, if innocent. Suchprocedures were doubtless ineɽcient methods ofdetection, but it would be wrong to conclude withone well-known legal historian that they ‘can onlybe described as irrational’.23 The experience of"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"many primitive societies shows that the ordeal isnot usually invoked until the suspect has alreadybeen identiɹed. It is merely an additional test ofhis guilt, not the initial means of discovering thecriminal. Its employment reɻects the weakness ofa central authority unable to enforce penalitieswithout the additional sanction of supernaturalassent.24 But the ordeal also serves apsychological purpose. As often as not, the guiltyparty will break down before undergoing the test.His nerve will crack and he confesses.Alternatively, the terror produced by his belief inthe infallibility of the procedure may lead him tofail so simple a test as that of having to swallowsome food or drink. The innocent man, on theother hand, may welcome the challenge as ameans of vindicating himself.25In the medieval judicial ordeal, accordingly, anyfaltering or mistake in the ritual was seen asevidence of guilt. Refusals to take the ordeal werecommon, and it seems that the system worked tosome extent by sheer intimidation. It also appearsthat, whereas some ordeals were very diɽcult toget through – notably the hot iron – others, like thecold water test, were almost impossible to fail. It"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"does not seem improbable that the choice ofmethod was often determined according towhether or not the accused was already believed tobe guilty. The function of the ordeal would then beto reinforce a verdict which had already beenreached.Such speculations are best left to be investigatedby the medieval historian.26 But it is indisputablethat, so long as all participants believed in thesupernatural eɽcacy of these primitive rituals,they could on occasion function as eʃectively asany more sophisticated methods of crime-detection. In the sixteenth and seventeenthcenturies traces of the ordeal still survived. Personsaccused on appeal of treason or felony (that is,formally accused by the injured person or his heir)could, if they wished, demand trial by battle as analternative to a jury. In civil actions, however, thejudicial duel was conɹned to questions aboutownership on writ of right and even then thedefendant or tenant could refuse the duel if hechose and submit the matter to a jury. Otherwise,the right to trial by battle remained technicallyintact until its abolition in 1819, all earlierattempts to get rid of it having proved"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"unsuccessful. On several occasions in the sixteenthand seventeenth centuries a duel betweenchampions was actually arranged, though theencounter was always called oʃ at the lastmoment, much to the relief of the lawyers.27 At aninformal level the old ordeal of cold waterreappeared in the practice of ‘swimming’suspected witches.28Another associated practice was that ofcompelling a person suspected of murder to touchthe victim's corpse, on the assumption that, if hewere guilty, the body would gush forth anew withblood. Contemporary scientists who believed indoctrines of sympathy and antipathy had nodiɽculty in accepting the validity of thisprocedure; and it is known to have been formallyemployed by judges and coroners on a number ofocasions during the sixteenth and seventeenthcenturies. Both Reginald Scot and Francis Baconwere prepared to believe that it worked.29 Itsmain role, however, seems to have been to deterthe potential murderer from committing theotherwise perfect crime for fear of beingsupernaturally detected. The suspect's reluctance toundergo the ordeal might also be taken as proof of"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"his guilt. At Ormskirk in 1636 it was urged thatJoan Elderson, a suspected witch, had stayed awayfrom the funeral of two children she was supposedto have killed, for fear that she would have beenmade to touch their corpses; and in Somerset in1613 a murderer fled, rather than touch his victim'sbody.30Similar considerations underlay the magicalthief-detection practised by the wizards. The act ofdivination could be a very alarming business whenconducted before all the parties concerned. Inspirit, it was much like the last chapter in themodern thriller where the detective reconstructsthe crime before the assembled suspects, whilestrong men wait to prevent the guilty party frombolting for the door. Undoubtedly an element ofbluʃ was involved. When Jane Bulkeley ofCaernarvon was sent for in 1618 to detect a thief,she cut a cheese into ten portions, wrote a charmon each of them, and gave a piece to every suspectto eat. Her procedure was identical with that usedfor the ‘holy morsel’ administered to clergysuspected of crime in the early Middle Ages; thefeelings of the guilty party confronted by thissinister lump of cheese may be imagined.31 An"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"alternative was to prescribe dry powder, whichwould be likely to stick in the dry throat of theguilty party. Or one could draw a large eye uponthe wall and invite the suspects to look at it; theguilty man's eyes would water when he did so.32Even the ritual of key and book could be convertedinto a form of ordeal. The pious eighteenth-centurylady Joanna Turner recalls how when she stole ashilling at her genteel boarding-school in the 1740sshe was, along with the other girls, ‘tried with theBible and key, as was the custom, to see whosehand shook most’.33A basic principle of magical thief-detection wastherefore to induce fear into the mind of the thiefso that he would be forced to reveal himself or torestore the stolen goods. This was fullyappreciated, both by contemporary writers onmagic, and by some of the lay public, who woulddeliberately give out that they had visited acunning man, or were intending to visit one.‘When they return home’, wrote an almanac-makerin 1609,they report (yet most falsely) as followeth. ‘I havebeen you know’, saith she (for you must"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"understand that the greatest part of such arewomen), ‘with such a man who is exceedinglearned, and he did shew me in a glass the partythat had my ring, and he told me where it is, andthat if it be not brought me again before tomorrowmorning that I shall go to him again, and he willmake it come again to the cost of the party thathath it’, etc. Now this is spoken where all thehousehold shall hear it (yet seeming to be said insecret). He or she who hath it (through fear) ismoved to convey it to some place where it maysoon be found; and then ɻyeth out a report thatsuch a cunning man hath caused it to be broughtagain.34So when a ɹfteenth-century London housewifemysteriously pronounced that she could choose atime to hang out clothes in her garden, so that ‘allthe thieves in England’ should not steal them,there may have been some method in hermadness.35 In 1788 a Sheɽeld workman got hisstolen savings back after the town crier hadannounced that he had gone to a conjurer to ɹndthe thief. In the late eighteenth century a servanteven murdered his employer to prevent him from"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"visiting a wizard and so discovering the theft hehad committed.36 Cunning men were known tohave magical recipes which could inɻict physicalinjury upon the culprit, or paralyse him so that hewould be unable to make oʃ with the goods.37Their deterrent eʃect was much like that ofmodern devices to shower burglars with indeliblepaint. When his brother's money had been stolen,one Jacobean landowner went to see a cunningman near Ringwood. Soon afterwards the thiefwas caught in a storm, which he naturallyattributed to the witch's machinations; his guiltyconscience did the rest, forcing him to return thecash.38In a society which accepted the possibility ofmagic, the cunning man could thus provide both adeterrent, and a means of detection. In a smallcommunity – a village, a monastery, a school – histechnique was particularly eɽcacious, but it hadsome value everywhere. For even if the magicianmade a false accusation, the person who had beenwrongly accused would then have an interest indetecting the real thief.

Ill-considered accusations could, of course, arousedissension,40 but at its best the system of magicaldetection had an undoubted utility. Themathematician, William Oughtred, Rector ofAlbury, Surrey, was regarded by the country folkas a conjurer, and, according to John Aubrey, waswell content to have them think so. ‘There wasnever a merry world since the fairies left dancingand the parson left conjuring,’ thought JohnSelden. ‘The opinion of the latter kept thieves inawe and did as much good in a country as aJustice of the Peace.’412. Conjuring and the magical traditionUntil the later seventeenth century the work of thepractising wizard was sustained by the parallelactivities of many contemporary intellectuals.Indeed the possibility of certain types of magicwas a fundamental presupposition for mostscientists and philosophers. Traditional cosmology"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"portrayed an inanimate Earth or elemental worldupon which played the inɻuence of the heavenlybodies. This in itself was suɽcient to encouragespeculation about the astral reasons for earthlyphenomena, and to give rise to much lore aboutthe astrologically derived properties of plants andminerals. It also suggested the possibility that themagician might ɹnd some means of tapping theinɻuence of the stars and diverting it to otherpurposes. Throughout the Middle Ages there hadbeen a continuous stream of magical speculationalong these lines.But the potentialities open to human ingenuitywere greatly enhanced by the tide of Neoplatonismwhich swept through Renaissance Europe. Therevival of this, the last school of ancient paganphilosophy, fostered a disposition to blur thediʃerence between matter and spirit. Instead ofbeing regarded as an inanimate mass, the Earthitself was deemed to be alive. The universe waspeopled by a hierarchy of spirits, and thought tomanifest all kinds of occult inɻuences andsympathies. The cosmos was an organic unity inwhich every part bore a sympathetic relationshipto the rest. Even colours, letters and numbers wereendowed with magical properties. The"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"investigation of such phenomena was the primarytask of the natural philosopher, and theiremployment for his own purposes was thedistinguishing mark of the magician. Three maintypes of magical activity thus lay open: naturalmagic, concerned to exploit the occult propertiesof the elemental world; celestial magic, involvingthe inɻuence of the stars; and ceremonial magic,an appeal for aid to spiritual beings.In this general intellectual climate it was easyfor many magical activities to gain a plausibilitywhich they no longer possess today. The doctrineof correspondences, or relationships between eachpart of the physical world, made possible the beliefin systems of divination like palmistry andphysiognomy; for, just as an individual man wasbelieved to mirror the world in miniature, so thehand or the face mirrored the man. Such systemsworked by what the German, Cornelius Agrippa,called ‘the harmoniacal correspondency of all theparts of the body’.42 From the disposition of thepart one could infer that of the whole. In the sameway one could accept the doctrine of signatures,according to which every herb bore a visibleindication of its medical role. The work of the"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"astrologers was similarly reinforced, for theinɻuence of the celestial bodies upon theconstitution of earthly ones could not be doubted.Even geomancy could be justiɹed as the propheticmessage of the soul communicated in a state ofrapture.43Further support for this kind of reasoning camefrom the doctrine of the magnet, set out byWilliam Gilbert, himself a convinced believer inthe theory that the world was alive. The magnetseemed to open the possibility of telepathy,magical healing and action at a distance.44Sympathetic healing by the weapon-salve waseasily acceptable, for it exploited the invisibleeʀuvia and inɻuences with which the worldvibrated. It made sense to apply the ointment tothe weapon rather than the wound because thenthe vital spirits in the blood congealed on theweapon would be drawn along in the air to rejointhe body. The technique, said Robert Fludd, wasnot ‘cacomagical, but only naturally magical’. TheRoyal Society accordingly showed considerableinterest in such ‘magnetical cures’ during its earlyyears.45 The use of the divining-rod was alsostimulated by magnetic theory, for the instrument"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"could be seen as a kind of lodestone, ‘drawing ironto it by a secret virtue, inbred by nature, and notby any conjuration as some have fondly imagined’.It too was taken seriously by the Royal Society.46‘If we should consider the operations of thismagnet,’ wrote the virtuoso Elias Ashmole, ‘thereis no other mystery, celestial, elemental or earthly,which can be too hard for our belief.’47Neoplatonic theory also emphasized theinɻuence of the imagination upon the body, of themind upon matter, and of words, incantations andwritten charms upon physical objects. By theexercise of his imagination, and the use of magic,symbols and incantations, the operator couldtransform either himself or his victim. Since theworld was a pulsating mass of vital inɻuences andinvisible spirits, it was only necessary that themagician should devise the appropriate techniqueto capture them. He could then do wonders.The intellectual study of magic was a Europeanphenomenon emerging in the FlorentineRenaissance with the Platonism of such writers asFicino and Pico della Mirandola, and spreading toNorthern Europe through the works of Paracelsusand Cornelius Agrippa. A key role in the"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"movement was played by Ficino's Latin translationof the Corpus Hermeticum, the supposed teachingsof the ancient Egyptian god Thoth, or ‘HermesTrismegistus’. This compilation had been puttogether during the ɹrst few centuries after Christ,but was generally believed by Renaissanceintellectuals to be pre-Christian, pre-Platonic andpossibly even pre-Mosaic. It taught that bymystical regeneration it was possible for man toregain domination over nature which he had lostat the Fall. Its astrological and alchemical lorehelped to create an intellectual environmentsympathetic to every kind of mystical and magicalactivity.48In England esoteric magical speculation waslargely a derivative aʃair, stimulated bycontinental writings, but adding little of its own. Itfound no place in conventional Protestanteducation. Dee, Gilbert and Raleigh were deeplyinɻuenced, but Bacon was sceptical of thedoctrines of sympathy and antipathy, which hethought ‘but idle and most slothful conjectures’,and he regarded talk of secret hidden virtues as anarrogant substitute for painstaking thought andinvestigation.49 The most elaborate English"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"hermeticist was Robert Fludd (1574–1637), whosemisfortune it was to have been born at a timewhen the intellectual presuppositions of the systemhad already come under attack. Yet although IsaacCasaubon's scholarship deprived the Hermeticbooks of their claim to be pre-Christian as early as1614, the cult of Hermes Trismegistus had itsEnglish adherents throughout the seventeenthcentury, partly no doubt because Casaubon'sdiscovery was tucked away in his polemic againstthe Counter Reformation historian, Baronius.Fludd wrote proliɹcally during the followingdecades, untroubled by Casaubon's ɹndings, andJohn Everard's translation of the hermeticPymander (1649) disseminated the tradition morewidely. The preface unrepentantly asserted thatthe work had been written ‘some hundreds of yearsbefore Moses’. In the latter half of the centuryastrologers and occult physicians continued toassert its antiquity and near-divinity: ‘HermesTrismegistus’ even appears as a Christian name ina Hampshire parish register.50But by the time this magical tradition had begunto make any substantial impact upon thepopulation at large it was beginning to lose its"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"intellectual repute. Around the middle of thecentury most serious scientists were moving overfrom an animistic universe to a mechanistic one.Those virtuosi who continued to search for occultvirtues and correspondences were essentiallyoutside the mainstream of scientiɹc thinking whichwas to culminate with Isaac Newton; though evenNewton subscribed to the hermetic notion that thetrue knowledge of the universe had been earlierrevealed by God to the ancients, the priscitheologi.51 Natural science owed much to thestimulus of hermetic thinking but its emancipationfrom that tradition was accomplished in the laterseventeenth century.52For much of the period, therefore, magicalinquiry possessed some intellectual respectability.At the universities many Jacobean students wereinterested in magic; both in the natural variety,and in the conjuration of spirits, which seems tohave been the equivalent of drug-taking today asthe fashionable temptation for undergraduates.There were quite a few confessions of youthfulparticipation in conjuring séances,53 and manyknown examples of university-based magicians.54The potentialities of love philtres were publicly"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"debated at Oxford in 1620, 1637, 1652 and1669;55 and, although it was maintained in 1605that spells could not cure diseases, the reality ofcures by sympathy was conɹdently upheld in1653.56 Other disputations concerned thepotentialities of natural magic, the existence ofoccult qualities, and the power of incantation. In1657 it was reported to be the recreation of Oxfordstudents of optics to practise ‘delusions of thesight’ of a kind which former generations wouldhave regarded as magical.57 Small wonder that forthe populace learning still meant magic: ‘Thou arta scholar; speak to it, Horatio.’ What was learningfor if not to deal with spirits? ‘Nowadays amongthe common people,’ it was said in 1600, ‘he is notadjudged any scholar at all, unless he can tellmen's horoscopes, cast out devils, or hath someskill in soothsaying.’58The democratization of this magical traditioncame during the Civil War and Interregnum, aperiod which saw the fall of so many otheraristocratic citadels.

Belief in the power of sympathyunderlay the attention paid by the magical healerto the patient's girdle or other clothing. Faith inthe occult virtues of precious stones justiɹed theuse of amulets and preservatives. The enunciationof charms and incantations was believed to set uprhythms and emanations in the air which mightexert an occult influence upon the sufferer. Naturalmagic of the kind made popular by theNeapolitan, della Porta, showed an obsessivefascination with the production of marvellouseʃects by natural means; it encouraged all kindsof trickery with mirrors and disguises. Astrology,geomancy, palmistry and similar methods ofdivination had a recognized intellectual basis.Even the attempts to procure conception bymagical means were echoed in the widely heldbelief that life might spring from the putrefactionof matter. Alchemy was equally consistent with thepopular theory that metals were living organismswhich could grow like plants. Since the unity ofmatter was presupposed, it followed that allsubstances might be reducible to their perfectform. The transmutation of metals was only one ofa wide range of Utopian objectives which it washoped the discovery of the stone would achieve."},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"With Paracelsus alchemy had shifted from a searchfor gold to a quest for a better pharmacopoeia.Gold in its liquid form (aurum potabile) would be aremedy for all diseases and help to produce theelixir of long life.

By this periodpopular magic and intellectual magic wereessentially two diʃerent activities, overlapping atcertain points, but to a large extent carried on invirtual independence of each other. Most of themagical techniques of the village wizard had beeninherited from the Middle Ages, and had directlinks with Anglo-Saxon and classical practice.Many can be paralleled in other primitivesocieties. They were only slightly aʃected by theRenaissance revival of magical inquiry or by thelearned volumes which were its most characteristicproduct.

It was relatively uncommon for suchpersons to possess books, or for their activities torest upon a body of self-conscious theory. Ofcourse a wizard might possess a printed guide tofortune-telling or some recipes from Agrippa ordella Porta.

Many such rituals were extant duringthe Middle Ages, and their numbers multipliedunder the stimulus of Renaissance Neoplatonism. Itwould be a long and separate task to trace theevolution of these diʃerent formulae and toestablish the precise genealogy linking the manydiʃerent essays in the ‘notory art’ - the Key ofSolomon, the Constitution of Honorius, the LiberSpirituum, and the others. Usually they circulatedin manuscript and were guarded with the utmostsecrecy by their owners; which was hardlysurprising, since for much of the period theconjuration of spirits was a capital oʃence. Fromtime to time, however, the arcana were rudelyexposed in print, most notably in the expandedthird edition of Scot's Discoverie of Witchcraft (1665)where much of Book XV was devoted to anexposition of such formulae, but also in RobertTurner's translations of the spurious Fourth Book ofAgrippa (1655) and the Notory Art of Solomon(1656). These works opened up to the reader thepossibility of invoking the whole hierarchy of"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"angels and demons, each with their own namesand attributes. The rituals for such spirit-raisingvaried, but usually involved such procedures asdrawing chalk circles on the ground, pronouncingincantations, observing ritual conditions of fastingand prayer, and employing such apparatus as holywater, candles, sceptres, swords, wands and metallamina.65There is no doubt whatsoever that these ritualswere extensively practised, both by contemporaryintellectuals and by less educated would-bemagicians. The so-called ‘Books of Magic’ oftenfound in manuscript collections of the periodcontain quite explicit formulae for invoking spirits,and there is no shortage of evidence for suchséances in the manuscript ‘Books of Experiments’which have survived. (Something of the attitude ofthe participants can be deduced from the early useof the word ‘experiment’ in this context.) Therecords of the most famous of these séances, heldby John Dee and his conɹdant Edward Kelly, werepublished in extenso in 1659 to demonstrate thespiritual dangers of such activities.

But sometimes a spirit wasreally believed to have appeared, in a crystal ball,in a disembodied voice (with an Irish accent,according to William Lilly),67 or even in humanshape. Sometimes he was visible only to the scryer,conventionally a young boy or girl, whoseimagination was doubtless adequate for thepurpose.

In 1660 a witch inWorcestershire declared that she would haveprevented the Restoration, had she not beenarrested in advance.84 Even the Duke ofMonmouth carried manuscript spells andconjurations during his bid for the throne,although he affected not to take them seriously.85Closely allied was the magic designed to bring"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"the operator into favour with persons in highplaces. Both Wolsey and Thomas Cromwell werealleged to have used magic rings in order to securethe favour of Henry VIII, and there is no doubtthat such methods were employed by lesser figures;for example by William Neville in 1532.86 In 1620a schoolmaster named Peacock was examined andtortured for practising magic to infatuate James I'sjudgement in the cause célèbre arising from thecharges of defamation brought by Lady Exeteragainst Sir Thomas Lake and his family.87At a popular level the making of love charmsand aphrodisiacs was a standard item in therepertoire of the village wizard. In 1492 RichardLawkiston appeared before the Commissary ofLondon for oʃering, for a fee, to provide a poorwidow with a husband worth a thousand pounds.His wife, he had assured her, knew a ‘cunning manthat by his cunning can cause a woman to haveany man that she hath favour to’. In 1561 LeonardBilson, Prebendary of Winchester, procured aCatholic priest to ‘hallow conjurations’ to enablehim to obtain the love of Lady Cotton, widow ofSir Richard Cotton.88 Charms for ‘theaccomplishment of the pleasure of the ɻesh’ or the"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"removal of marital impotence were a commonfeature of contemporary magical books.

He confessed to issuing one woman with acharm to make her husband love her, for which hewas paid six and eightpence plus two half-kirtlesand a gold ring, and to supplying another with acharm to enable her to procure ‘my Lord ofDover's’ goodwill towards her husband (for whichhe also received six and eight).

In 1559 Lady FrancesThrogmorton, daughter of Lord Chandos, turnedout to have been conferring with wizards in aneʃort ‘to obtain her husband's entire and perfectlove’. In 1613 during the scandal following themurder of Sir Thomas Overbury, it emerged thatFrances, Countess of Essex, and her conɹdante,Mrs Turner, had visited the astrologer andmagician, Simon Forman, with a view to procuringthe love respectively of the Earl of Somerset andSir Christopher Maynwaring. Later in the reign ofJames I, Frances Shute, mistress of the Earl ofSussex, paid an annual retainer for a magician togain her the sympathies of the royal favourite,Buckingham.92 Such practices recall the recurringallegations in late medieval court circles ofattempts to infatuate the King by magicalmeans.93Love magic could also involve the cunning manin attempts to ɹnd missing persons in the sameway as he traced missing goods. It was reported in1617 of John Redman of Sutton, Cambridgeshire,that when his wife left him he ‘went from wizard"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"to wizard, or, as they term them, “wise men”, tohave them bring her again’. Similarly in 1712 JoanStevens, on meeting Elizabeth Watkins of ChurchWithington, Hertfordshire, and ‘hearing she was inlove with one Samuel Smyth, who had gone fromher, told her that she could fetch him back again’.As payment in advance she obtained a silvernecklace, a gold ring worth ten shillings, and threeand sixpence in money.94 When some prisonersescaped from Reading Gaol in 1635 the DeputyGaoler, William Turner, ‘would have gone to acunning woman... but his dame was not willing heshould do so’. At Ormskirk Sessions in 1634 thewizard John Garnett was said to have told someclients that a missing friend had been murderedand thrown into the local marl-pits; two innocentlabourers were temporarily arrested on the basis ofthis denunciation.95The search for missing persons is intelligibleenough, but magicians were also associated with aless obviously reasonable request: the hunt forburied treasure.

It was still common forrich men to keep their valuables in a box under thebed or to bury them in the ground.96 Such savingswere often turned up accidentally, and, along withthe ancient coin-hoards of the Middle Ages,provided some justiɹcation for the would-betreasure seeker. Whole families were rumoured toowe their rise to lucky ɹnds with the ploughshareor spade. These stories served to account forotherwise puzzling instances of social mobility;they are common in many static societies where itis assumed that only luck can change a man'sfortunes.97 Contemporaries were impressed, andthe search for treasure engaged the energies ofmany whose tastes in a later age would have ledthem into speculation on the Stock Exchange.In popular mythology the treasure was likely tobe in one of certain conventional hiding-places,for example, the ruins of a monastery or castle.Primitive mounds or barrows were particularlyfavoured; by the early Tudor period theirexcavation in the hope of quick riches was socommon that ‘hill-digger’ had become a recognized"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"term of abuse for a man on the make.98 Anassociated title was ‘cross-digger’, arising from thebelief that treasure was to be found under waysidecrosses, an assumption which animated suchtreasure-seeking expeditions as that of LordNeville, the Earl of Westmorland's son, in 1546. Itwas the search for treasure, as much as anyProtestant iconoclasm, which lay behind thehostile reference in the preamble of the witchcraftstatute of 1542 to persons who had ‘digged up andpulled down an inɹnite number of crosses withinthis realm – for despite of Christ, or for love ofmoney’.99 At Brackley, in Northamptonshire, theantiquary John Leland found that one of the threestone crosses had been ‘thrown down a-late bythieves that sought for treasure’. As late as 1615three men were in trouble at Chester for pullingdown crosses for this purpose.100There was not necessarily anything magicalabout the search for treasure as such, but inpractice the assistance of a conjurer or wizard wasvery frequently invoked. This was partly because itwas thought that special divining tools might help,such as the ‘Mosaical Rods’ for which manycontemporary formulae survive; John Dee believed"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"that he could discover hidden treasure byexploiting the laws of sympathy and antipathy.101But a magician was also needed when the treasurehad been found to exorcize the demon or evil spiritwho was likely to be mounting guard over it.Directions for dealing with treasure are to befound in many contemporary magical books,102and there was a long series of clandestine treasure-seeking expeditions, operating with magicalassistance and sometimes involving persons ofhigh rank.103 In 1589, for instance, a prisoner inthe Tower informed Burghley that there wastreasure hidden in Skenfrith Castle,Monmouthshire, guarded by a devil and his wife.In 1634 the Dean of Westminster allowed anexpedition, equipped with Mosaical rods and ledby the King's clock-master, Davy Ramesey, tosearch for treasure in the Abbey. Around 1652Anne Bodenham was oʃering a magic charm toɹnd £1,000 which, she claimed, had been buried inWilton garden by the late Earl of Pembroke. In1680 there was an attempt at Bridgwater, guidedby the local cunning man, to ɹnd treasure byspirit-raising and the use of divining-rods.

He was joined in 1685 by the ex-Leveller, John Wildman, currently a supporter ofthe Duke of Monmouth and anxious to lay hishands on money for the cause. With the aid of‘George’, the disembodied spirit of an executedfelon, Wharton and Wildman looked for treasureat Somerset House, exorcized four devils (Wildmanheard one of them ‘hiss’), and embarked on a questfor the Urim and Thum-mim from the breastplateof the High Priest of the Temple (Wildmancalculated that the jewels alone would be worth£25,000). A house in Holborn was thought tocontain treasure guarded by spirits, so Wildmaninɹltrated himself as a lodger, but this move wasof no more avail than were the ɹfty guineas whichhe was subsequently persuaded to leave as a tip"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"for the fairies. When the ex-Leveller grumbled that‘God could not be the author of disappointmentsand delays: and it could not come from Him if theywere thus deceived’, the angels retorted that hislack of faith was hindering the operation. Theissue of a warrant for Wildman's arrest as a rebelterminated his interest in the proceedings, butWharton continued the quest, egged on by hisunscrupulous medium and mistress, Mrs Parish.

Bacon accepted thepotentialities of physiognomy and John Aubreythought it could be an infallible guide tocharacter.109 The Jacobean sectary, John Traske,even claimed to be able to determine whether aman was saved or damned by examining hisface.110 The obvious lineal descendant of this typeof thought was phrenology, divination by theshape of the skull, so popular with the Victorians.Other divinatory handbooks had a lessdiscernible intellectual basis. There was Arcandam,‘teaching the fatal destiny of every man’,translated from the French by William Warde,subsequently Professor of Physic at Cambridge,which went into seven editions between 1562 and1637, and several more before the end of theseventeenth century.111 Based on an elaboratecalculation of thenumerical value of the letters in a person'sname, it was derived from the Spheres of Life andDeath, a genre which went back to the ancientworld.

The symbolism which such adages reɻectedwas largely lost by the seventeenth century, butthe slogans themselves lived on.115Printed literature of this kind was used by manycunning men or wandering fortune-tellers. A wisewoman claimed as early as 1493 to have a bookwhich told her everything about the future.116Robert Harris, who startled the people ofMaidstone in 1556 by great feats of divination,worked by staring at his clients' faces. Theprinciples of physiognomy also underlay theactivities of Valentine Staplehurst, who arrived atthe same town four years later, claiming, despitehis illiteracy, to be able to tell both past andfuture.117 Others used private divining systems oftheir own: Joan Mores of East Langdon, Kent, wassaid in 1525 to tell the future from the croaking offrogs; seventeenth-century farmers predicted theprice of corn by watching the behaviour of grainsplaced on a hot hearth; in the eighteenth centurywizards claimed to divine by ‘casting coʃee-grounds’, presumably an anticipation of the more"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"modern practice of ‘reading the tea-leaves’.118Some cunning women claimed second sightbecause they were seventh children.119 Othershave left no indication of how it was they wereable to predict the future.The layman could also get a glimpse of thefuture without ever gong near the cunning man.

That this was no mere ɹction is demonstratedby the presentment of Katherine Foxgale ofWalesby before the Archdeacon of Nottingham on1608 for being a scold and curser of herneighbours, and ‘for watching upon St Mark's Eveat night last in the church porch to presage by"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"devilish demonstration the death of someneighbours within the year’.121 Stories circulatedfreely of the terrible revelations made to thosewho took part in these curious vigils.

And whenRobert Halywell, a tailor of Axholme, Lincolnshire,tried the experiment about the same period he washorriɹed to see the phantom shapes of numbers ofhis fellow-parishioners. The sight made him soaghast that he was reported to have looked ‘like aghost ever since’. When all the persons he had seendied in the ensuing twelve months, the tailor wassummoned by Lord Sheɽeld to give an account ofhis experience. ‘The fellow, fearing my lord wouldcause him to watch [in] the church porch again,hid himself in the Carrs [i.e. fens] till he wasalmost starved.’ These vigils survived until thenineteenth century.122The nature of the surviving evidence makes iteasier to reconstruct the range of popular beliefsabout divination and fortune-telling than toascertain the contexts in which particular"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"individuals had recourse to them. The cunning menwere too prudent and usually too ill-educated tokeep records of their consultations, and suchinformation about their activities as survives isseldom adequate for any detailed reconstruction oftheir relationship with their clients. In anyexplanation of the social role of divination,therefore, speculation and analogy with thepractice of diviners elsewhere must play a largepart.It does, however, seem clear that recourse to afortune-teller was not normally a frivolous aʃair,but usually occurred when the client had somematter weighing on his mind. The wife of GilbertWright, Master of the Salters' Company in 1624,frequently consulted cunning men in order to ɹndout whether she would outlive her husband, andthere is some evidence to suggest that this was acommon type of inquiry.123 In many cases itseems that the wish was father to the thought, andthat the question directly reɻected the tensions ofan unhappy marriage. Thus when Dr Suckling'swife visited Mary Woods, the Norwich palmist, in1613, to ɹnd out when her husband would die, shefollowed up her inquiry by oʃering the wise"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"woman money if she would poison him.

The oracles of classical antiquitywere customarily asked to pronounce upon themerits of two alternative courses of action, or toindicate the best way of attaining an alreadychosen goal.125 It is likely that the cunning menof this period often performed the same task.Nicholas Gretton, who operated in the Lichɹeldarea in 1654, is known to have been asked suchquestions as where a client should go to buycertain commodities, or whether he would be welladvised to ask his family for a loan; and the Earlof Somerset, James I's ex-favourite, is said to haveconsulted a wizard about how to reinstatehimself.126 Divination could also resolve"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"disagreement by providing a ɹrm answer to aspeciɹc question. As far back as the year 785 theChurch had banned the use of sorcery as a meansof resolving controversies. In the Middle Ages thepeople who visited the miraculous well of StMargaret at Binsey, near Oxford, are said to havegone ‘to ease their burdened souls and obtainresolution of their doubts, as they would to anoracle’.127 Used in this way, divination could helpmen to take decisions when other agencies failedthem. Its basic function was to shift theresponsibility away from the actor, to provide himwith a justiɹcation for taking a leap in the dark,and to screw him up into making a decision whoseoutcome was unpredictable by normal means.The diviner's predictions, therefore, did notdeɻect his clients from their original intentions; onthe contrary, it was the process of consultationwhich forced them to know their own minds.Divination could set the imagination free.128There was an element of hypnotic self-suggestionin crystal-gazing and similar subjective activities.It is this which explains why conspirators sofrequently found it necessary to enhance theirdetermination by getting a magician to predict"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"that their cause would prevail. For there is noevidence that would-be rebels were ever deterredfrom making their attempts by an unfavourableprognostication.

He will tossagain, or look for some other method ofconɹrming his original purpose.129 Omens bear asimilar relationship to human intentions. Wedream many dreams, but those which weremember are the ones which harmonize with ourexisting hopes and fears. The utterances of thethree weird sisters were treated with suspicion byBanquo. But they struck an answering chord in theheart of Macbeth.Diviners thus existed to strengthen their clients'resolution and to sustain their optimism.

Now the great eʃects that may come ofindustry and perseverance (especially in civilbusiness) who knoweth not?’131But if divination could strengthen thedetermination of the man who half-knew what heshould do, it also helped the person who had noidea. It legitimized random behaviour by enablingmen to make a choice between diʃerent courses ofaction when on rational grounds there wasnothing to choose between them.

Theyknew too much about the conɻicts and suspicionslatent within a small community.

In Somerset, Nicholas Butler, whopurported to be able to recover stolen goods andidentify the thieves, was accused in 1557 of‘deceiving divers persons, and causing greatdissension between man and man’.

Apart from the liability of allconcerned to punishment in the ecclesiasticalcourts, there were three parliamentary statuteswhich imposed secular penalties for some of themost common forms of popular magic. In 1542 itwas made a felony, i.e. a capital oʃence, to usemagic for treasure-seeking, for the recovery ofstolen goods, or ‘to provoke any person tounlawful love’. This Act, repealed in 1547, wasfollowed by the statute of 1563, which proscribedthe same activities, though reducing the penalty toa year's imprisonment and four appearances in thepillory for the ɹrst oʃence, and life imprisonmentand forfeiture of goods for the second. Thismeasure was in turn superseded in 1604 by a morestringent Act imposing the death penalty onsecond oʃenders. Conjuring of spirits was a felonyin all three Acts.143 There were also numerousstatutes against itinerant fortune-tellers,144 and atotal prohibition of alchemy, the transmutation ofmetals remaining a felony until 1689.

As a Puritan writer indignantlycommented, ‘the blesser escapes and the sillypeople that run to this white Devil are letalone’.147Nevertheless, the risk of prosecution was greatenough to deter the cunning man from courtingunnecessary publicity, and this makes it all themore diɽcult to determine just how common aɹgure he was. No useful statistics, can be derivedfrom the records of the secular courts, where hisappearance was only desultory.

ThusJoan Betyson, who in 1595 admitted to treatingforspoken cattle, charged only a penny peranimal, and did it for nothing if her client wasvery poor.

This proscription ofsorcery and divination was continued after theNorman Conquest and was frequently reiterated inthe councils and synods of the medieval Church. Bythe thirteenth century it had become customary forthe clergy to pronounce an annualexcommunication of all sorcerers in genere, andparish priests were expected to use theconfessional as a means of coercing their flock intoabandoning their time-honoured recourse tomagic. The various magical practices which werecurrent in the sixteenth and seventeenth centurieshad all been listed in such earlier mandates as thatof Ralph Baldock, Bishop of London, who in 1311ordered his archdeacon to proceed against thosewho practised sorcery for recovering lost goodsand foretelling the future, and who conjured spiritsor made use of stones and mirrors. In the laterMiddle Ages preachers inveighed against thepractice of magic by the laity, while theecclesiastical courts regularly proceeded againstwizards and those who had recourse to them.1The theory underlying such a prohibition was"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"coherent enough.2 There was no objection toattempts to heal the sick or foretell the future bypurely natural means. The Church neverdiscouraged the use of medicine, for example, orthe attempt to predict the weather on the basis ofobservable natural phenomena. But any claim tohave achieved some eʃect greater than that whichcould be shown to have arisen from known naturalcauses was immediately suspect. If a healingpower was claimed for charms or written words,or if the weather was foretold by reference to suchunconnected data as the day of the week on whichChristmas had fallen, then the matter needed to beclosely scrutinized. The Church did not deny thatsupernatural action was possible, but it stressedthat it could emanate from only two possiblesources: God or the Devil. Certain supernaturaleʃects could be conɹdently expected by faithfulmen who followed the rituals prescribed by Godand the Church, for example those pertaining tothe Mass or the power of holy water. Others mightoccur miraculously, as with the healing activitiesof the saints. But the remainder were diabolicaland to be abhorred. Any magician, therefore, whosought to achieve a marvellous result by meanswhich were neither purely natural nor commanded"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"by God was guilty of allying himself, either tacitlyor expressly, with Satan. This was the oʃence ofthose who superstitiously attributed a healingpower to words or rituals unauthorized by theChurch, or who attempted by some system ofdivination to penetrate those secrets of the futurewhich only God could know. In Dante's Infernosuch prognosticators were discovered with theirheads twisted backwards as a penalty for theirimpious curiosity.3Two aspects of this attitude are immediatelyobvious. The ɹrst is that the legitimacy of anymagical ritual depended upon the oɽcial viewtaken of it by the Church. So long as theologianspermitted the use of, say, holy water orconsecrated bells in order to dispel storms, therewas nothing ‘superstitious’ about such activity; theChurch, as we have already seen, had nocompunction about licensing its own brand ofmagical remedies. The second feature is that theChurch's view of any other technique woulddepend upon its prior assumptions about what wasor was not ‘natural’. Those sixteenth- andseventeenth-century clergymen inɻuenced byNeoplatonism, for example, were disposed to"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"attribute much more to natural causes than theirconservative brethren who subscribed to the lessɻexible Aristotelian view of matter. For RobertFludd, the weapon-salve was an entirelycommendable attempt to harness the invisibleforces he believed to be pulsating through thenatural world; but for his clerical opponent,William Foster, the parson of Hedgerley,Buckinghamshire, the procedure was diabolicaland its original inventor, Paracelsus, a monstrousconjuror working outside the bounds of nature.Had not Aristotle shown that nothing could workat a distance?4 What was at issue here was notany diʃerence of religious principle; it was a viewof the natural world. If the clergy tended to bequicker than some laymen in detecting the hand ofthe Devil, it was as much because of theiruniversity training in Aristotelianism as because oftheir religion. At every stage in the progress ofscience there were to be discoveries so marvellousthat conservatives, unable to accept that sucheʃects could spring from mere nature, fell back onthe view that they must have stemmed from theDevil.The boundaries of ‘magical’ activity were thus"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"determined by the attitude of the Church to its ownformulae and to the potentialities of nature. TheReformation in England saw a spectacularreduction in the power attributed to holy wordsand objects, so that the more extreme Protestantsvirtually denied the existence of any Church magicat all. At the same time their attitude to thepractice of non-ecclesiastical magic remained ashostile as ever. Divination, charming, fortune-telling, and all the other activities of the villagewizard were still reprehensible. Any device whichseemed to produce miraculous eʃects for nodiscernible natural reason was immediatelysuspect. Even the tricks performed forentertainment by conjurers and jugglers weresometimes suspected to involve diabolical aid.5For those Protestants who believed that the age ofChristian miracles was over, all supernaturaleʃects necessarily sprang from either fraudulentillusion or the workings of the Devil. Satan, it wasbelieved, was well acquainted with the secrets ofnature and might counterfeit an eʃect when hecould not reproduce it directly. Those persons whosought to use objects for purposes which naturecould not justify were guilty of idolatry,superstition, and at least implicitly of soliciting the"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"aid of the Devil.This was not a very diʃerent position from thatwhich had been assumed by the medieval Church.The main change was that the Protestants nowattacked not only folk magic, but also large partsof the old ecclesiastical magic as well. Theytherefore looked less indulgently upon some of theparasitic vagaries of popular devotion. Villagewizards who used Christian prayers to heal or todivine the future now seemed as diabolical asthose whose techniques were blatantly derivedfrom pagan tradition. By using such prayers,thought Thomas Cooper, the ‘blessers’ and ‘goodwitches’ merely advanced ‘lip-labour and formaldevotion, the very life of Popery’.6The cunning man was therefore guilty of blatantlèse-majesté, by seeking to achieve supernaturalresults without God's aid. But it was his claim toperform such miracles rather than any actualsuccess which excited religious opinion; for, on thequestion of the actual eɽcacy of the wizard'scharms, the theologians were divided betweenthose who regarded them as entirely illusory –‘they have not power to hurt nor to help us’, wrotethe Puritan, Richard Greenham – and those who"},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"conceded their eʃectiveness, but chose to attributeit to the tacit assistance of the Devil, who hadforwarded the sorcerer's project in order to captureboth his soul and those of his clients.7 Somethought that a sick man cured by a witch wouldsoon relapse again;8 others held that he would behealed in this world, but damned in the life tocome.Seen from this point of view, the cunning manwas an even more deadly menace than the blackwitch, for the latter's acts of malevolence madehim unpopular with the community at large,whereas the remedies oʃered by the white witchwere positively seductive. ‘The most horrible anddetestable monster,’ resolved William Perkinsaccordingly, ‘is the good witch.’ The black witchmight do harm to his neighbour's body, but thecunning man struck a mortal blow at his soul.9Many theological writers thus chose to blur thediʃerence between diʃerent kinds of magicalactivity, on the grounds that they all involveddiabolical aid and were all equally likely to drawaway the allegiance of God's people. In theecclesiastical courts such terms as ‘witch’,‘sorcerer’, ‘charmer’ and ‘blesser’ were used almost"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"interchangeably.But in fact the white witches were never heavilypunished. It was always theoretically open toecclesiastical judges to commit extreme heretics tothe secular arm for burning, but this never seemsto have been done in cases of magic, for whichmore moderate penalties were in practice inflicted.Those post-Reformation writers who would like tohave seen the cunning men and women put todeath10 were thus unable to achieve theirobjective through the agency of the church courts.The plan for a reformed canon law drawn up by acommission in the reign of Edward VI hadrecommended the imposition of the heaviestpenalties (poenas gravissimas) upon both cunningmen and their clients, but the scheme never cameinto eʃect. Neither did the proposal of WilliamAlley, Bishop of Exeter, to Convocation in 1563,that ‘penal, sharp, yea, capital pains’ be inɻictedupon ‘witches, charmers, sorcerers, enchanters andsuch like’.11 Only the secular law, in the form ofthe Tudor statutes against witchcraft, everprescribed genuinely heavy penalties for magicalactivity, and even then those cunning men whowere not accused of doing anyone any physical"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"damage were treated with relative leniency.Popular magic was treated by the church courts asneither more or less serious than such other routineoʃences as sabbath-breaking, defamation andfornication. It was not singled out as peculiarlydiabolical. The writers who continued to agitatefor severer treatment of the village wizard seem,with a few exceptions, to have belonged to themore aggressively Protestant section of theAnglican Church and, as time went on, to havebeen increasingly unrepresented at the top of theecclesiastical hierarchy. None of the clergy wouldhave denied that a tacit compact with Satan wasimplicit in the practice of magic, but very fewseem to have taken the implications of this asseriously as might have been expected.Nevertheless, Protestants and Catholics in themid sixteenth century were equally vehement intheir hostility to popular magic, and bothdenounced it in terms which would have beenapproved by their medieval predecessors. TheRoyal Injunctions of 1547 fulminated againstcharmers, sorcerers, enchanters, witches andsoothsayers in language which was closely echoedseven years later by Edmund Bonner, the MarianBishop of London. Indeed Bonner wrote at length"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"against magic, asserting that ‘witches, conjurers,enchanters, and all such like, do work by theoperation and aid of the Devil’ and that ‘all suchcommit so high oʃence and treason to God, thatthere can be no greater’.12 The ElizabethanInjunctions of 1559 similarly forbade the laity toemploy ‘charms, sorcery, enchantments,invocations, circles, witchcrafts, soothsaying orany such like crafts or imaginations invented bythe devil’, and banned their resort to magicians‘for counsel and help’. These oʃences weresubsequently inquired after by the bishops andarchdeacons in their visitation articles, so thatthose guilty of them might be hauled up before theeclesiastical courts. The types of magic mostcommonly mentioned included the detection ofstolen goods, the use of charms to heal men andanimals, the prediction of men's destinies, and theuse of unlawful prayers or invocations. A full listwas given by Edwin Sandys, Bishop of Worcester,in 1569: ‘charms to cure men or beast; invocationsof wicked spirits; telling where things lost or stolenare become by key, book, tables, shears, sieves;looking into crystals or other casting of ɹgures’.13Any individual known to have employed such"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"techniques, or reputed to have dabbled in anyother kind of magical activity, was supposed to bereported to the bishop or archdeacon by theincumbent and churchwardens of the parish inwhich he lived; and so was anyone who could beproved to have been one of the wizards' customers.In the Church's eyes it was as much an oʃence totake one's problems to a sorcerer as to be one.Ecclesiastical anxiety to repress popular magicmay also have been one of the chief reasons forthe assumption by the early sixteenth-centuryChurch of control over the licensing of doctors andmidwives. The statute of 1512 giving the bishopsauthority to license medical practice cited thesuperstitious activities of contemporary quacksand empirics as justiɹcation for the step,14 whilethe concern to repress the use of magic inchildbirth clearly lay behind the introduction of alicensing system for midwives during the reign ofHenry VIII. It is sometimes said that it was thechanges brought by the Reformation which led theChurch to take an interest in the religiousorthodoxy of all midwives, since these women hadthe authority to baptize any newly-born infantthought likely to die before a priest could be"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"fetched. But the Malleus Maleɹcarum (1486) hadalready urged that midwives should take an oathin order to eliminate any possibility of their resortto witchcraft. The ɹfteenth-century Church inEngland had prosecuted superstitious midwives,and the licensing system is known to have beenemployed by Bishop Fitz-James of London (1506–22) before the Reformation began. Midwives hadalways been ‘the occasion of much superstitionand dishonour of God’, as Bishop Latimer put it.15The earliest surviving example of the midwife'soath dates from 1567, and it includes a promise torefrain from the use of any kind of sorcery orenchantment during the period of labour. Thisstipulation was retained until the second half ofthe eighteenth century; and in addition the bishopsinquired in their visitation articles about the use ofgirdles, invocations and charms by pregnantwomen.16During the ɹrst half of the seventeenth centurythe Church continued its campaign against thecunning man, although questions about popularmagic were possibly a less frequent feature ofvisitation inquiries than they had been in theTudor period. The erratic survival of these articles"},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"makes exact comparison diɽcult. But there is noreason for thinking that the Anglican Church'sattitude to sorcery on the eve of the Civil War wasvery diʃerent from that of its medievalpredecessor.17 Nor did the Interregnum constitutemuch of a break in this respect. The Presbyteriansshowed strong hostility to popular magic, and anordinance of 1648 imposed the penalty ofsuspension from the Lord's Supper upon all thosewho repaired for advice to witches or fortune-tellers. Independents, Huguenots, Baptists andQuakers took the same attitude.18 Under theRump the committee set up to reform the lawproposed to make it a criminal oʃence to repair toa cunning man ‘for ɹnding out any goods lost orstolen, or to know who shall be their husbands orwives, or any other such like futurecontingencies’.19 This provision would have ɹlledthe gap left by the temporary disappearance of thechurch courts, but like so many other would-be lawreforms it never came into effect.The real change in attitude seems to have comewith the Restoration of the Anglican Church after1660. The inquiries after charmers and sorcererswhich had been so prominent a feature of"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"visitation articles before the Civil War now silentlydisappeared from the list of matters on which thebishops and archdeacons normally soughtinformation from their ɻock. Cases of magicalactivity were still sporadically prosecuted in theecclesiastical courts, and there were occasionalinquiries about sorcerers at visitations – the latestexample so far traced is in the Bishop of Norwich'sarticles for 1716.20 But their occurrence had beenrare during the previous ɹfty years and anyattempt at an organised campaign was clearlyover. The sermon literature of the laterseventeenth century reɻects the same indiʃerenceto what had once been regarded as a problem ofpressing urgency. It appears that the Church nolonger thought popular magic worth takingseriously. So far had old fears been forgotten, thatin 1710 the Barber-Surgeon's Company, whenpetitioning against the Archbishop of Canterbury'spower to license surgical practitioners, couldassume that the intention to repress magicalhealing asserted by the 1512 statute, which gavethe bishops their licensing powers, had been amere blind: ‘an artiɹcial motion set up by thePopish clergy in those times to draw within theirown verge the inspection and approbation of all"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"such persons as attended the beds of dying men’.21Even while it lasted, the Church's campaignagainst magic had been of doubtful eɽcacy. Solong as the records of the ecclesiastical courtsremain largely unpublished, its precise impact isimpossible to assess; especially as the irritatingtendency of ecclesiastical judges to postpone casesrepeatedly before reaching a ɹnal decision oftenmakes it very diɽcult to discover what the resultof an individual prosecution may have been. Butcertain conclusions may be fairly conɹdentlyreached.22In the ɹrst place, it must be appreciated that theultimate success of any campaign waged throughthe church courts depended upon the extent of thecooperation it received from the local incumbentand his churchwardens, upon whom fell the onusof presenting suspects in response to the inquiriesof the bishop or his deputy. The extent of thiscooperation varied greatly. In the laterseventeenth century, for example, it seems to havebeen common in some areas for nil returns to beregularly made by way of reply to acomprehensive set of inquiries relating to allaspects of the spiritual state of the parish. Indeed"},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"as early as 1622 all but one of the ɹfty-four extantchurchwardens’ presentments for the diocese of Elywere blank.23 Such declarations of omnia bene arevalueless as evidence of the actual state of anyparish, however useful the incidental light theymay shed upon the declining eʃectiveness of thewhole system of episcopal visitation. As theseventeenth century wore on, these blank returnsbecame increasingly common. In the later Stuartperiod parishes maintained a keen interest inreporting cases of bastardy, presumably because oftheir consequences for the rates, but they tended topass over other ecclesiastical oʃences which musthave been committed no less frequently. Even inthe Elizabethan period, when returns were usuallymuch fuller, replies to questions about suchmatters as sabbath-breaking or clerical non-conformity had tended to reɻect the state ofreligious opinion in the parish as much as theextent to which such ecclesiastical crimes hadactually been committed. The presentation ofsorcerers, therefore, may be reasonably presumedto have ɻuctuated according to the attitude takento them by the leading parishioners. A wisewoman who was popular with her neighboursmight escape delation; whereas one who had"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"fallen out with them might ɹnd herself accused notjust of charming, but even of black witchcraft.Sometimes, moreover, the culprit might be toopowerful for the churchwardens to risk denouncingher. In 1619 the parish oɽcers of King's Sutton,Northamptonshire, stated darkly that someunnamed persons had resorted to sorcerers forthings lost, but that they hesitated to present theguilty parties, because the latter ‘profess that theyhave ten pounds and such large sums of money tospend to ride the minister out of town for sojoining in the presentment’.24Even if a cunning man did fall into the hands ofthe ecclesiastical courts – and thousands must havedone so – his ultimate fate still dependedconsiderably upon his relations with the people ofhis own neighbourhood. If he denied the charge,the normal procedure was for the ecclesiasticaljudge to order him to bring compurgators from hisown parish to testify to his innocence. If hesucceeded in producing the required number(usually between four and eight), he could counton being let oʃ with a caution. The wizard's abilityto muster compurgators was thus the crucial factorin the whole proceedings. Primarily, of course, his"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"success or failure here was an index of hispopularity. The court itself might be held milesaway from the parish concerned and thecompurgators would be put to trouble andexpense, which the accused party might beexpected to refund. Without money or inɻuence,he could have diɽculty in persuading anysupporters to turn up. Agnes More in 1583 deniedthe charge of witch-craft for which she had beenbrought before the court of the collegiate church ofSouthwell, but was released without punishment,because ‘she is a poor woman and not of ability tobring in any of her neighbours to purge her’.25 Butsuch indulgence could not be relied upon.Even so, the opportunity of summoningcompurgators, and the reluctance of his friends totestify against him, gave the accused magician agood chance of getting oʃ altogether: in thediocese of York in the later sixteenth century abouthalf of the sorcery cases were ultimately dismissed,with or without purgation.26 Even if the wizardwas convicted, his penalty was light, whencompared with the imprisonment, pillory, or evendeath, to which he would have been liable in acommon law court. After the Reformation the"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"church courts had abandoned the practice ofinɻicting corporal punishment.27 This left themwith greater or lesser excommunication, or, in lessserious cases, penance. Excommunication wasnormally reserved for those who did not turn up,or otherwise proved recalcitrant. The wizard whostood his trial and was convicted was most likelyto be sentenced to perform penance with avarying degree of publicity, usually in churchbefore the parishioners at service-time, sometimesin the market-place of a neighbouring town. Cladin a white sheet, carrying a wand, and placardedwith the details of his oʃence, the hapless sorcererwas undoubtedly subjected to a great deal ofpublic humiliation, a penalty which was felt evenmore keenly in the tightly knit society of thosedays than it would be now. But in the process hewas getting a good deal of free advertisement, andwhen it was all over he might well resume hispractice.28In this manner the church courts proceeded intheir battle against the cunning man until the laterseventeenth century, when the whole system ofecclesiastical jurisdiction slipped into a rapiddecline. Even in its heyday, the achievement of the"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"courts had been limited. Many sorcerers, like otheroʃenders, ɻouted the whole procedure by refusingto turn up at all. Although such recalcitrants wereusually excommunicated, there is little evidence tosuggest that they were consigned forty days laterto a secular prison, as strict legal theorydemanded. The general situation was thus muchthe same as it had been in the days before theReformation. The agencies of clerical repressionwere not in themselves strong enough to cut oʃpopular magic from its social roots.2. Similarities and differencesThe battle against popular magic was fought in thepulpit as well as in the courts. Generations ofclergy harangued their ɻocks with the warningthat all traɽc with white witches could only worktowards their ultimate spiritual destruction. ‘Intime of need it is better to call upon Christ inprayer than to have recourse to a wizard and adiviner for help.’ The words are those of Wulfstan,the Anglo-Saxon homilist,29 but they might havebeen uttered by any cleric in Tudor and StuartEngland. If prayer was of no avail it was wickedto turn to spells and charms as, a substitute, for if"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"Satan healed the body he would certainly capturethe soul. Besides, ‘if the faithful and devout prayerof holy men... hath no such assurance or success...without laborious industry and the use of goodmeans, how can... senseless mumbling of idlewords, contrary to reason?’30This advice might have been more eʃective if ithad not so obvi- coincided with the interests of theclergy as a professional class. In the cunning manthe godly minister could hardly fail to recognise apowerful rival to his own pastoral dominion. ‘Insuch wise witches,’ lamented Sir Thomas More,‘have many fools more faith a great deal than inGod.’ ‘Hath not the blesser more proselytes andpatients than the physician,’ asked a Jacobeanminister, ‘yea than the conscionable preacher?’ Aslate as 1680 a Staʃordshire gentleman echoed thecomplaint: white witches had ‘as many followersas the greatest divines’.31In trouble, sickness or loss, men ɻew not to God,but to witches. This was the burden of the clergy'scomplaint, and it was but another way of sayingthat the cunning man threatened to usurp some oftheir own most important functions. ‘As theministers of God do give resolution to the"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"conscience in matters doubtful and diɽcult,’ wrotethe Reverend Thomas Pickering in 1608, ‘so theministers of Satan, under the name of wise menand wise women, are at hand by his appointmentto resolve, direct and help ignorant and unsettledpersons in cases of distraction, loss or otheroutward calamities.’32 The laity went to sorcerersfor help and advice, and whether their trouble wasphysical or psychological they gained comfort andassistance. ‘This is a common thing and well triedby experience’, wrote George Giʃord, ‘that manyin great distress have been relieved and recoveredby sending unto such wise men or wise women,when they could not tell what should else becomeof them and of all that they had.’ William Lillytells us that his mistress could only keep her ɹrsthusband from suicide by means of a sigil made bySimon Forman.33It is small wonder that the sorcerer's claim toproduce practical results should have so oftenproved more attractive than stern clericalinsistence that all must be left to God's inscrutablemercies; and that it was better to lose a thingutterly than to recover it by diabolical means. Thelawfulness of an action was not to be judged by its"},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"mere eʃectiveness, wrote Richard Bernard. ‘Betterlose clothes or coin, than recover either by Satan,’declared Thomas Gataker.34 Inevitably the adviceof these ɹerce Puritan clergy proved repellent tomany of those in trouble or danger. Stories weredisseminated of men who had died because theirministers had forced them to burn the protectivecharms the cunning men had given them. Suchinterfering clergy seemed regardless of the people'smaterial welfare. In 1570 the very keeper ofCanterbury gaol frankly admitted to havingallowed liberty of egress to an imprisoned wisewoman, on the grounds that ‘the witch did moregood by her physic than Mr Pundall and Mr Wood,being preachers of God's word’; and a character inGeorge Gifford's Dialogue concerning Witches (1593)declared of the local wise woman that ‘she dothmore good in one year than all these scripture menwill do so long as they live’.35Similar issues were posed by the cunning man'sclaim to diagnose and treat the eʃects ofmalevolent witchcraft. Many lay folk would neverhave contemplated resorting to magical aids, hadthey not suspected that magic had already beenused against them. But here the clash between the"},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"rival therapies of magic and religion was at itssharpest. For although most of the clergy acceptedthe possibility of maleɹcent witchcraft, they wereunable to compete eʃectively with the remediesoʃered by the cunning man or with the varioustraditional folk procedures. The Anglican Churchhad rejected holy water, the sign of the cross, andall the paraphernalia of the Roman Catholicexorcists, but they had nothing to put in theirplace, save a general injunction to prayer andrepentance. The Church thus maintained thetraditional view of the potency of witchcraft,although it had abandoned the ecclesiasticalcounter-magic which made such a notion tolerable.The suʃerer who invoked a magical remedyagainst witchcraft ran the risk of ɹnding himselfprosecuted before the ecclesiastical courts.36Better that a bewitched child should die, thoughtthe clergy, than that his life should be saved by acunning man.37 In such circumstances it was onlyto be expected that the remedies of the sorcerershould have appeared increasingly attractive.

Through the ecclesiastical courts, they didtheir best to curb their rivals, by punishing thecustomers of the cunning men, forcing them toconfess publicly to being ‘heartily sorry for seekingman's help, and refusing the help of God’.39 Butthe trouble was that such clients did not regard thewizards as ordinary men, and could not see thatthere was anything wrong about having recourseto their remedies. ‘Men rather uphold them,’ wroteJohn Stearne, ‘and say why should any man bequestioned for doing good.’ ‘I have heard them sayfull often myself,’ wrote the Bridgettine monk,Richard Whytforde, of ‘the simple people’ in theearly sixteenth century, ‘“Sir, we mean well andwe do believe well and we think it a good andcharitable deed to heal a sick person or a sickbeast”.’40 The attempt by the theologians to wipe"},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"out the distinction between black and whitewitches by branding them both as diabolical nevergot through to the people to whom these witchesministered. On the contrary, they were more likelyto believe that the cunning folk were taught byGod, or that they were helped by angels, or eventhat they possessed some divinity of their own. Thecommon people, wrote Thomas Cooper, assumedthat the power of these wizards came by ‘someextraordinary gift of God’. They honoured cunningmen, wrote another, ‘no less than demi-gods’. Theyfollowed the London poulterer, Grig, who curedpatients by his prayers, ‘as if he had been a god’,and they gave the Tudor conjurer, Robert Allen,the sobriquet of ‘the god of Norfolk’.41The cunning folk themselves sometimesencouraged these assumptions. In Somerset in1555 Joan Tyrry protested that ‘her doings inhealing of man and beast, by the power of Godtaught to her by the... fairies, be both godly andgood’; and in Flintshire in 1657 Anne Ellis declaredthat she had done good in blessing children andanimals, ‘for...

Butusually the precise source of the wizard's skillseems to have been left conveniently undeɹned.He owed his reputation to his technique andknowledge (‘his cunning’), rather than to anyspecial holiness of life.

It was the clergy who forced him intothe posture of the divine healer by their refusal toallow that magical powers might have atheologically neutral status.

This could make it diɽcult for the clericalopponents of magic to know where to draw theline. Charmers and blessers often sought to healtheir patients by reciting standard religiousprayers. So long as the Protestant Church admittedthat disease might be divinely imposed, andtherefore divinely withdrawn, it was in no positionto disparage the invocation of God as such. Itcould, of course, distinguish between legitimateand illegitimate forms of prayer, by prohibitingthe use of such Roman Catholic formulae as LatinPaternosters and Creeds, or the invocation of theVirgin Mary and the saints.

Theuse of prayer was not meant to impede the use ofmedicine but to accompany it. It was assuperstitious to rely upon prayer alone, as it wasimpious to trust solely to physic. But thedistinction was a subtle one. When even some ofthe clergy thought that some diseases might bedirectly inɻicted by God without any naturalcause, it is not surprising that some of the laitywere confused.45If religion still retained some of its magicalaspects, then magic was in turn aʃected bycontemporary religion. For just as the use ofChristian charms by the cunning men sprang froma presumed association between holiness andoccult power, so the spirits which the moreambitious magicians attempted to conjure wereeither Christian angels, or members of anintermediary body half way between angels anddevils.46 The conjurer's ritual, moreover, with its"},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"hallowings, fumigations and consecrations, wasstrongly reminiscent of the Roman Mass, as manycommentators pointed out.47 Of course mostclergy strongly frowned upon such conjuration,maintaining that there were no theologicallyneutral spirits, but only good or bad ones; thegood ones were unlikely to answer so peremptorya summons, while the bad ones were only tooeager to seize the chance of capturing the souls ofsuch reckless men.

ButNeoplatonists were rare among the English clergy,despite Robert Fludd's claim to have the patronageof three bishops.

Formany, this was no mechanical manipulation of setformulae, but a humble supplication that Godshould extend to them the privilege of a uniqueview of his mysteries. ‘The art of magic,’ wrote SirWalter Raleigh, ‘is the art of worshipping God.’52At Prague John Dee told the Emperor Rudolph IIthat for forty years he had sought knowledge, only"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"to ɹnd that no book or living man could tell himwhat he wanted.

Atno point in his occult wanderings did he considerhimself to have passed the bounds ofChristianity.53At this level the practice of magic became a holyquest; the search for knowledge, not by study andresearch, but by revelation. The notion that purityof life was an essential preliminary to scientiɹcdiscovery ran through the long history of alchemyand shaped the Rosicrucianism of the seventeenthcentury. It remains uncertain whether theFraternity of the Rosy Cross ever had more than asymbolic existence, but its values were familiar;they went back to the ancient tradition of gnosis:the seeking of knowledge by revelation, throughprayer, fasting and communion with God.

The transmutation of metals was secondaryto the main aim, which was the spiritualtransformation of the adept. Alchemy wasassociated with asceticism and contempt for theworld. It was no accident that, despite variousprohibitions, many medieval alchemists had beenmonks,54 and that the monasteries retained areputation for occult learning of this kind in thecentury after the Reformation. The numerousstories about the pots of miraculous tincture foundin monastic ruins helped to create a widespreadmythology about the link between magic andholiness.55 Of course such tales were not usuallycountenanced by the established Church: indeedthe attitude of most orthodox Calvinist clergy toalchemy was distinctly hostile. They distrusted itfor the same reason that they were suspicious ofall kinds of magic: it was an arrogant attempt totransform nature which could only play into theDevil's hands. The alchemists, thought ThomasJackson, displayed ‘some spice of that spirit of"},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"pride which ɹrst sublimated physic into magic’.Most seventeenth-century Puritans condemnedalchemy as diabolical.56Yet the old tradition of the spiritual quest,reinforced by the inɻuence of Renaissancehermeticism, could still capture the imagination ofhighly religious persons.

Moses,‘learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians’ (Actsvii, 22), was especially famous for his magicalpowers.

His powers ofexorcism were taken away, and his formulae ofbenediction and consecration much reduced.

To such changes the apparentdiminution in the extent of clerical participation inpopular magic must be attributed. But the changewas a gradual one, and the association in thepopular mind between magic and the priesthoodwas only slowly eradicated.In many country parishes after the Reformationthe minister combined his religious functions withthe practice of medicine, and his methodssometimes diʃered little from those employed bythe folk healers of the day. ‘Many poor countryvicars,’ wrote Robert Burton, ‘for want of othermeans, are given to... turn mountebanks,quacksalvers, empirics.’78 A successful medicalpractitioner, like Hugh Atwell, parson ofCalverleigh, Devon, and rector of St Ewe,Cornwall (1599–1615), could easily gain thereputation of being a magician, simply because hiscures actually worked.79 But there were oftengood grounds for such suspicions.

In 1632 the Court of High Commission dealtsharply with another cleric, Joseph Harrison, forill-living and suspected ‘charming of pigs’. Fiveyears later, the vicar of Fleckney, Leicestershire,was charged with making charms to curetoothache. The curate of Capel, Surrey, John Allen,sequestrated in 1645, was also said to have writtena charm for toothache, remarking sensibly enoughthat if the suʃerer would believe in it it could helphim.

For the people were now taught thattheir practical diɽculties could only be solved by acombination of self-help and prayer to God. Thesubstitute action involved in the practice of magicwas condemned as both impious and useless.

Despitereɹnements in detail, the astrology known tosixteenth- and seventeenth-century Englishmenwas recognizably the same subject as thatexpounded by the Egyptian Ptolemy in hisTetrabilos in the second century A.D. In theseventeenth century the English astrologers wereto popularize the doctrines of the science in avernacular literature which laid every detail of thesubject open to public inspection, but the doctrinesthey enunciated were essentially traditional.Indeed, several of the English treatises onastrology were little more than translations ofearlier Latin writings.1 Like Christianity, astrology"},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"proved strikingly adaptable to the needs of asocial environment which was very diʃerent fromthat in which it had originated.The basic astrological assumptions are notdiɽcult to grasp. For if astronomy is the study ofthe movements of the heavenly bodies, thenastrology is the study of the eʃects of thosemovements. The astronomers of the ancient worldhad been impressed by the regular behaviour ofthe heavens, in contrast with the ɻux andmutation of life upon earth. They accordinglyassumed a division of the universe whereby thesuperior, immutable bodies of the celestial worldruled over the terrestrial or sublunary sphere,where all was mortality and change. It wasassumed that the stars had special qualities andinɻuences which were transmitted downwardsupon the passive earth, and which varied in theireʃects, according to the changing relationship ofthe heavenly bodies to each other. Owing to theirinadequate techniques of astronomicalobservation, the early scientists had no conceptionof the inɹnite number of existing solar systems norof the vast distances which separate the visiblestars from each other. They were thus led topostulate a single system in which the seven"},{"pageNumber":580,"pageContent":"moving stars or planets – Sun, Moon, Saturn,Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mercury – shifted theirposition in relation to the earth and each other,against a ɹxed backcloth of the twelve signs of thezodiac. The nature of the inɻuence exerted by theheavens at any one moment thus depended uponthe situation of the various celestial bodies. Bydrawing a map of the heavens, or horoscope, theastrologer could analyse this situation and assessits implications. By an extension of the sameprinciple, he could, given the necessaryastronomical knowledge, construct a horoscope forsome future point of time, and thus predict theinɻuence which the heavens would exert on thatoccasion.There was nothing esoteric about these generalassumptions. At the beginning of the sixteenthcentury astrological doctrines were part of theeducated man's picture of the universe and itsworkings. It was generally accepted that the fourelements constituting the sublunary region – earth,air, ɹre and water – were kept in their state ofceaseless permutation by the movement of theheavenly bodies. The various planets transmitteddiʃerent quantities of the four physiologicalqualities of heat and cold, dryness and moisture. In"},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"the resulting interaction was comprised allphysical change. This relationship between earthlyevents and the movements of the heavens was butone example of the many links andcorrespondences which were thought to bind thephysical universe together. Astrology was thus lessa separate discipline than an aspect of a generallyaccepted world picture. It was necessary for theunderstanding of physiology and therefore ofmedicine. It taught of the inɻuence of the starsupon the plants and minerals, and thereforeshaped botany and metallurgy. Psychology andethnography also presupposed a good deal ofastrological dogma. During the Renaissance, evenmore than in the Middle Ages, astrology pervadedall aspects of scientiɹc thought. It was not acoterie doctrine, but an essential aspect of theintellectual framework in which men wereeducated.Nevertheless, the subject had a life andindependent momentum of its own, especiallywhen the prestige of the Ptolemaic picture of theuniverse began to crumble under the pressure ofthe astronomical discoveries of the century and ahalf between Copernicus and Newton. During thisperiod astrology gradually lost its role as a"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"universal symbolism, and ossiɹed into a separate,and ultimately obsolete, system of belief. Thischange was still in the future when the sixteenthcentury opened. Although there had been manysceptics about particular details of astrologicaldogma, especially as regards the possibility ofmaking deɹnite predictions concerning thebehaviour of specific human beings, there were notyet any real heretics, so far as the basic principlesof the subject were concerned. No one denied theinɻuence of the heavens upon the weather ordisputed the relevance of astrology to medicine oragriculture. Before the seventeenth century, totalscepticism about astrological doctrine was highlyexceptional, whether in England or elsewhere.During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuriesthere were four main branches to the practice ofjudicial astrology (to give it its full title, for theterm ‘astrology’ by itself was often used assynonymous with ‘astronomy’). First, there weret h e general predictions, based on the futuremovements of the heavens, and taking note ofsuch impending events as eclipses of the sun andmoon, or the conjunction of the major planets inone sign of the zodiac. These forecasts related tothe weather, the state of the crops, mortality and"},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"epidemics, politics and war. They indicated thefate of society as a whole, but not that ofparticular individuals. Secondly, there werenativities, maps of the sky at the moment of aperson's birth, either made on the spot at therequest of the infant's parents, or reconstructed forindividuals of mature years who could supply thedetails of their time of birth. If the date of the birthhad been lost, the astrologer could try to work itout by inference from the relationship between the‘accidents’, or notable events in his client's life,and the state of the heavens at the time. Thehoroscope at birth could subsequently be followedup by ‘annual revolutions’, in which the astrologercalculated the individual's prospects for the comingyear.The details of the client's nativity were alsoneeded before he could avail himself of theastrologer's third main service, that of makingelections, or choosing the right moment for theright action. By comparing the relationshipbetween the tendencies indicated by the client'shoroscope with what was known about the futuremovement of the heavens, certain times could beidentiɹed as more propitious than others forembarking upon any potentially risky"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"undertaking, such as going on a journey orchoosing a wife. The election of a proper time wasalso a desirable procedure for routine operations,like cutting one's hair and nails, or having a bath.Finally, there were horary questions, the mostcontroversial part of the astrologer's art, and onewhich had only been developed after the days ofPtolemy by the Arabs. Its optimistic assumptionwas that the astrologer could resolve any questionput to him by considering the state of the heavensat the exact moment when it was asked – on theprinciple that ‘as the nativity is the time of thebirth of the body, the horary question is the time ofthe birth of the mind’.2 If the question was amedical one the patient might accompany it with asample of his urine; the astrologer then based hisanswer upon his interpretation of the sky at themoment when the urine had been voided, or whenit had arrived at his consulting-room. But everykind of personal problem could be dealt with as anhorary question.These four spheres of activity–generalpredictions, nativities, elections and horaryquestions – formed the sum of the astrologer's art.An individual practitioner might specialise in one"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"rather than another, but he was expected to be amaster of them all. He might also possess a certainamount of medical learning. Diʃerent signs of thezodiac were thought to rule over diʃerent parts ofthe body, and a proper election of times had to bemade for administering medicine, letting blood, orcarrying out surgical operations. This wasgenerally recognized by all sixteenth-centuryphysicians. But there had also developed a moreidiosyncratic system of astrological medicine whichlinked every stage of treatment to the dispositionof the heavens. By casting a ɹgure for thedecumbiture, or moment when the patient felt ill,and by resolving a question on sight of his urine,the astrological doctor claimed to be able todiagnose the disease, prescribe the treatment,foretell when the sickness would reach its crisis,and prognosticate its eventual outcome.Such were the main branches of English (andindeed European) astrology during the sixteenthand seventeenth centuries. Although purporting tobe an objective science, the system was highlyɻexible, since it left room for inɹnite possibilitiesof disagreement, both over general principles, andover the interpretation of any particular problem.Every astrological prognosis involved a ɹgure of"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"the heavens, in which the sky was divided up intotwelve sections or ‘houses’, each relating todiʃerent aspects of human life. Lack of precisionin time-recording made the construction of thisɹgure diɽcult enough in itself, and there wasplenty of scope for mathematical error in theintricate astronomical calculations required. Buteven when the horoscope had been drawn andagreed upon, the problem of its interpretationremained. The planets were deemed to havecolours, sexes, physical qualities, and so forth. Butthe elaborate mythologies which proliferated alongthese lines were not always consistent. Theplanets, moreover, were only one variable in adensely crowded mosaic of ɻuctuating constituents– elements, humours, qualities, houses and signs ofthe zodiac. The client's own horoscope might alsoneed to be compared with that of the country inwhich he lived, or those of the other persons withwhom he had dealings. The astrologer thus foundhimself involved in a welter of combinations andpermutations which greatly complicated the taskof interpretation.

If the prestige of astrology is to bemeasured by the publication of astrological works,then the story is one of a peak reached at aroundthe end of the sixteenth century, followed by adiscernible lull in the twenty years before the CivilWar, and thereafter an unprecedented torrent ofpublication, which began with the War, but wenton until the end of the seventeenth century."},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"In terms of popular accessibility, therefore, thecrucial period of English astrological publicationwas the last sixty years of the seventeenth century,and particularly the Interregnum.

Almanacs and prognosticationsStrictly speaking, the almanac comprised threequite separate items.39 There was the Almanacproper, which indicated the astronomical events ofthe coming year, eclipses, conjunctions andmovable feasts. There was the Kalendar, whichshowed the days of the week and the months, andthe ɹxed Church festivals. Finally, there was thePrognostication, or astrological forecast of thenotable events of the year. Usually they were allsold together as one piece, interlarded with thesort of miscellaneous information which diariesstill carry today – a list of markets and fairs, aguide to highways and distances by road, a briefchronology of notable historical events since theCreation, medical recipes, legal formulae, hints ongardening. By the mid seventeenth century theyalso carried advertisements for books, patent"},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"medicines, or teachers of mathematics. These littlepocket-books were quite distinct from thebroadside sheet almanac, the ancestor of themodern calendar. They contained moreinformation, and were less ephemeral.Contemporaries found them invaluable as diaries,note-books, and vade-mecums generally. As aconsequence large collections still survive in theBodleian, British Museum and other large libraries.The most obvious diʃerence between the pocketalmanac and the modern diary is the strongastrological emphasis of the former. The moreelaborate almanacs included Ephemerides, ortables showing the daily position of the heavenlybodies throughout the year. With their aid thereader could predict the movement of the planetsthrough the signs of the zodiac, and foresee thevarious conjunctions and oppositions. Thus armed,he was in a position to set about casting his ownhoroscopes. In addition he could consult thealmanac's diagram of the Anatomical Manindicating the dominion of the diʃerent signs ofthe zodiac over the diʃerent parts of the humanbody. From this he could work out the appropriatetime for taking medicine or medical treatment.Above all, there was the prognostication, in which"},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"the author of the almanac demonstrated hisvirtuosity by detailed forecasts of politics, theweather, the state of the crops, and the health ofthe population in the year to come.Medieval almanacs had circulated inmanuscript, but they seem to have been intendedprimarily for students and physicians. It was onlyin the Tudor period that the printed Englishalmanac rose to a position of enormous popularsuccess. During the early sixteenth century varioustranslations of continental prognostications wereissued, some of which sold very briskly.40 But notuntil 1545 is an Englishman known to havecomposed his own forecast for publication. He wasAndrew Boorde, an ex-Carthusian, and hisprognostication was the ɹrst of many. Foreignprognostications still circulated, but their placewas steadily usurped by domestic products. By1600 there had been probably over 600 diʃerentalmanacs published in England, and they were stillon the increase.

Highly political prognostications, of thekind common during the Civil War, had beenrelatively infrequent during the previous century.By the 1630s the so-called Prognostication wasoften merely an additional calendar of secularoccurrences during the year. It was only thesubsequent breakdown in censorship which madepolitical forecasting commonplace.Yet even without a prognostication, the almanacprovided a guide to daily action.

Chief amongthese was the prognostication of Erra Pater,allegedly ‘a Jew out of Jewry’. (‘If one aɽrm helearned it of a Jew,’ ran a contemporary jingle,‘The silly people think it must be true’.) Erra Paterwas in fact derived from the perpetualprognostication of Esdras, which had circulatedextensively in the Middle Ages.45 Like Digges'salmanac it gave a table forecasting the weatheraccording to the day of the week on which NewYear began.

Henry Peacham wroteof the early Stuart husbandman that ‘Erra Pater,and this year's almanac (if he can read) are theonly two books he spends his time in’, whileBishop Hall said in his ‘Character’ of TheSuperstitious Man, that he would never go out‘without an Erra Pater in his pocket’.46Closely allied to Erra Pater were other crudeworks of prognostication, vaguely astrological incharacter, but lacking the rigour of the astrologicalalmanac proper. There was The Kalender ofShepherdes, translated from the French in 1503,and reissued at least seventeen times during theensuing century and a half, despite its distinctlyRoman Catholic character.

There were at least twelveeditions of this work in the second half of theseventeenth century.48 These were in addition toArcandam, the Sphere of Pythagoras, and other non-astrological handbooks of divination.49 ‘These betheir great masters and in this manner their wholelibrary, with some old parchment rolls, tables andinstruments,’ wrote Gabriel Harvey of theElizabethan wizards: ‘Erra Pater, their hornbook;the Shepherd's Kalendar, their primer; the Compostof Ptolomeus, their Bible; Arcandam, their NewTestament’.50 The astrological almanac was thusbut one of a whole genre of publications which toldreaders how to make predictions about the future,and to choose days which would be particularlyfavourable for any given course of action.

At the level of popularreadership it is doubtful whether the distinctioncan have been so clear.The appeal of the almanac was closely related tothe belief in the signiɹcance of the changingphases of the moon which was extensively held inrural areas and still lingers on today.51 Mostprimitive people attribute to the moon aninɻuence upon the weather and upon conceptionand growth, whether of vegetation, animals orhuman beings. In medieval theory the balance ofhumours in the human body was believed toɻuctuate with the phases of the moon. The moonwas thought to control the amount of moisture inthe human body, and the brain, as the moistestpart of the body, was believed to be particularlysubject to its inɻuence. Hence the notion of theinsane as ‘lunatic’ or ‘moonstruck’.52 A child bornat full moon, declared an astrologer in 1660,would never be healthy.53Many people accordingly allowed the phases ofthe moon to determine their timing of variousactivities.

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuriesthe rising moon was still thought of as the time forputting on new clothes or embarking upon somenew course of action.54 Thomas Tusser and otheragricultural writers advised farmers to cut cropswhen the moon was in the wane and to sow whenit was on the increase.55 In the later seventeenthcentury, haircutting and nail-paring were said tobe ‘commonly done according to the increase ofthe moon’.56 Some of the popular handbooks ofprognostication took the principle further bydecreeing that speciɹc activities should be timed tocoincide with speciɹc days of the month. They laiddown appropriate days for blood-letting, purging,going on journeys, buying and selling, even forstarting school. Hardly any of theirrecommendations would have been endorsed byserious astrologers, and they provide a furtherreminder of the large gulf between would-bescientiɹc astrology on the one hand, and popularbeliefs of a vaguely astrological character on theother.Published astrological forecasts were always indemand. When Thomas Gataker, the Puritan"},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"divine, wanted to compose a refutation of one ofLilly's prognostications in 1653, he had greatdiɽculty in ɹnding a copy, so rapidly had it soldout.57 But readers could be sceptics. Weatherforecasts in particular were received with a gooddeal of scorn;58 and the almanac met with astream of satire and burlesque. From theanonymous A Mery Prognostication in 1544 toSwift's pitiless mockery of John Partridge in 1708,there was an unbroken barrage of anti-astrologicalsquibs. In 1569 Nicholas Allen in in his pamphlet,The Astronomer's Game, made eʃective capital outof a side-by-side comparison of the predictions ofthree contemporary almanac-makers, and thisbecame a standard method of attack.59But the very frequency with which Elizabethanand Jacobean wits found it necessary to denouncethe almanacs and prognostications is in itselftestimony to the inɻuence which they exerted.‘Who is there,’ asked one writer in 1612, ‘thatmaketh not great account of his almanac toobserve both days, times and seasons, to follow hisaʃairs for his best proɹt and use?’60 In 1561Frances Coxe complained of the common peoplethat ‘scant would they ride or go any journey"},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"unless they consulted, either with these blindprophets, or at least with their prophecies’.William Perkins declared that men boughtalmanacs so as to proɹt by knowing in advancethe state of the crops and the price of commodities.A later writer also noticed that ‘the commonpeople in reading... almanacs are very cautelousin observing them’. In 1652 John Gaule observedthat it was notorious that the people at largepreferred ‘to look into and commune of theiralmanacs, before the Bible’.61 In March 1642, onthe eve of the Civil War, a responsible observerreported from Westminster that ‘the best sort evenof Parliament men’ were much agitated by somepassages in John Booker's almanac which forecast‘that cruel and bloody counsels shall be put inexecution the latter end of this month’.62Unusually dramatic testimony to the almanac'ssupposed inɻuence was provided in 1666, whent h e London Gazette revealed that six ex-Parliamentary soldiers involved in a republicanplot had chosen the third of September for theirattempt, after consulting Lilly's almanac andmaking an astrological calculation.63 As late as1708 Jonathan Swift observed that many country"},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"gentlemen spent time ‘poring in Partridge'salmanac to ɹnd out the events of the year, athome and abroad; not daring to propose a huntingmatch till Gadbury or he have ɹxed theweather’.64In addition to the routine prognosticationattached to the almanac, there was a fugitiveliterature devoted to such unusual celestialoccurrences as comets, eclipses and conjunctions ofthe major planets, all of which were thought toportend comparable upheavals upon earth. ‘Therewas never any great change in the world,’ wrotethe Tudor mathematician Robert Recorde, ‘neithertranslations of empires, neither scarce any fall offamous princes, no dearth and penury, no deathand mortality, but God by the signs of heaven didpremonish men thereof, to repent and bewarebetimes.’65 The ‘new star’ which appeared in theconstellation of Cassiopeia in 1572, the comet of1577, the conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn in1583,66 1603 and 1623, the solar eclipse of 1652,the comet of 1680 – all excited extensive discussionand prognostication. Elizabeth I gained greatprestige by manifesting her indiʃerence to thecomet of 1577. When her courtiers tried to deter"},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"her from looking at the dreaded object, sheadvanced boldly to the window, declaring lacta estalea – ‘The dice is thrown’.67 James I was reported(after his death) to have summoned Cambridgemathematicians to explain the comet of 1618, andthen prophesied both the Thirty Years War, andthe fall of the Stuarts.68The reaction which such heavenly portents couldproduce is well illustrated by ‘Black Monday’ – thesolar eclipse of 29 March 1652. Over a quarter ofthe publications collected by the booksellerThomason for the month of March related to theeclipse and its signiɹcance.69 Even the LordMayor and Aldermen of London heard a sermonon the subject on the 28th.70 The alarm among thepeople was such, recalled John Evelyn, that‘hardly any would work, none stir out of theirhouses, so ridiculously were they abused byknavish and ignorant star-gazers’.71 The richloaded up their coaches and ɻed from London,while mountebanks did a thriving trade in cordialswhich purported to allay the eʃects of the eclipse.At Dalkeith the poor were said to have thrownaway their possessions, ‘casting themselves on"},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"their backs, and their eyes towards heaven andpraying most passionately that Christ would letthem see the sun again, and save them’.72 Onecontemporary diarist considered that the ultimateeʃect of the eclipse was to discredit theprognosticators. No terrible eʃects followed;indeed it seems to have been a ɹne day, ‘so thatthe astrologers lost their reputationexceedingly’.73 But the forecasts of the astrologershad been political. Lilly predicted the fall ofPresbyterianism, the reform of the law and thesetting up of a new representative. Culpepperforecast the onset of democracy and the FifthMonarchy. Other radicals predicted the fall ofRome and the universal end of monarchy.74 Theywere probably aiming to counter the original BlackMonday tract, a veiled piece of Royalistpropaganda issued in December 1651. At apopular level the damage had been done byanonymous pamphleteers predicting darkness,sudden death and ‘great madness, raging andterrifying thousands of the people’. In the end theCouncil of State put out a paper explaining thateclipses were natural events which could have nopolitical effects.75"},{"pageNumber":611,"pageContent":"Printed publication was thus one of the mainmethods by which the astrologers made theirimpact upon the life and thought of the period.Some almanacs were so popular that they took ona life of their own and continued to appear longafter the death of their original founders. The year1655, for example, saw the publication ofalmanacs attributed to Allestree, Pond, Dade, Vauxand Woodhouse, all of whom were dead. Butdespite their enormous sales, the almanacs did notusually bring their authors much in the way ofremuneration: Sir Thomas Overbury assumed in1615 that an almnack-maker earned 40 shillings ayear; and this was probably the normal rate in theseventeenth century.76 But the almanac enabledthe practising astrologer to draw attention to thefacilities he had to oʃer by way of privateconsultation.

Sometimes it was only a sideline to someother occupation. In 1560 William Fulke thoughtthat most astrologers were doctors.78 Manyphysicians cast horoscopes in connection with theirpractice, and some gave astrological advice onnon-medical matters as well. Astrologicalprocedures were also advertised by village wizardswho purported to be able to set ɹgures for fortune-telling or the recovery of stolen goods. At the otherend of the scale there were professionals, withextensive London practices, and high-class virtuosi,who cast horoscopes for themselves or theirfriends, out of curiosity or intellectual interest.How long this situation had existed is hard totell, for the origins of regular astrological practicein England are lost in obscurity. Astrologicalknowledge seems to have been a rareaccomplishment in Anglo-Saxon England (althoughKing Edwin of Northumbria is said to have had anastrologus called Pellitus who gave him advice onmilitary matters).79 It probably only became"},{"pageNumber":613,"pageContent":"familiar in court circles with the scientiɹc revivalof the twelfth century and the diʃusion of Arabicastrological writing. Previously there would havebeen few men capable of making the observationsnecessary to set a horoscope.

What was muchless common was the existence of professionalastrologers catering for a wide clientele. Astrologywas primarily the concern of Court, nobility andChurch. Peter of Blois in the twelfth centurythought it worth issuing warnings againstastrological consultations, but there is no apparentevidence for the existence in medieval England ofanything like the consulting facilities which wereavailable in some contemporary Mediterraneancountries.80The ɹrst unambiguous testimony to the existenceof private astrological practice in England datesfrom the ɹfteenth century.81 A lawsuit of 1505reveals that the immediate reaction of a carrier,who had money stolen from his pack while lodgingat an inn in St Ives, Huntingdonshire, was to lookfor an astrologer to help him identify the thief.

The most famousElizabethan practitioner, John Dee, was no back-alley quack, but the conɹdant of the Queen andher ministers, though he also gave advice tohumbler persons. As late as 1603, Sir ChristopherHeydon, the astrological writer, declared thatastrology had not ‘much conversed at any timewith the mean and vulgar sort, but... hath beenever most familiar with great personages, princes,kings and emperors’. But by this date there was alarge, though indeterminate, number of low-levelconsultants scattered through the country,claiming to operate by astrological methods, andsubstantially patronized by a popular andunsophisticated clientele.84"},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"In practice many of these were indistinguishablefrom the village wizards.

Others operated on the basis of a smallcollection of tattered magical recipes andastrological ɹgures bequeathed by some earlierpractitioner. Stephen Trefulacke, for example, whowas imprisoned in 1591, proved to be carrying anextensive reference library: two Ephemerides,Arcandam, a translation of the Judgment ofNativities by the Frenchman, Ogier Ferrier, and avariety of such miscellaneous formulae asɹgures to know how long one shall live andwhether they shall obtain the treasures hoped for;ɹgures to know things lost; a book of conjurationfor divers things,... sundry conjurations of raisingspirits and binding them and loosing them...ɹgures to know whether a man be dead or alive orwhether he has another wife; to obtain the love ofany woman and other like matters."},{"pageNumber":616,"pageContent":"This was an imposing if heterogeneous armoury.85By contrast, there were cheerful impostors whoknew no astrology at all, like John Steward, an ex-schoolmaster, living at Knaresborough in 1510,and frequently consulted in cases of theft. Hereadily confessed that he tried to impress clients bypretending to consult a book of astronomy, butthat in fact ‘he could nothing do’, although bygood luck things did sometimes turn out as hepredicted,86 Astrology was similarly claimed asthe basis of his procedures by Thomas Lufkyn, towhom women ɻocked in Maidstone in 1558, ‘as itwere to a God to know all secrets, past and tocome’. He was in fact quite innocent of anyastrological knowledge, despite his readiness topredict the number of husbands and children hisclients would have, and to prophesy death in thecoming month for others.87 Even the notorious‘Doctor’ John Lambe. Buckingham's conɹdant,when examined by the Royal College of Physiciansin 1627 proved to be ignorant of the astrologicalscience he professed.88Pretenders of this sort continued to be common,even in the later seventeenth century, when thedissemination of astrological guides in English"},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"made it easy enough for those with only a modesteducation to take up the art. Elias Ashmolecomplained in 1652 that astrology was beingdebased by the existence of ‘divers illiterateprofessors’ who gave the subject an undeservedbad name;89 and similar protests continued to bemade by many serious practitioners. They had inmind such charlatans as the wandering fortune-teller who caused havoc in a Lincolnshire town in1695 by informing some of his clients that theywere in imminent danger of death, and assuringothers that they were undoubtedly bewitched. Hisequipment comprised some mouldy old almanacs,astrological schemes, and a copy of Wingate'sArithmetic.90But apart from the score or so of prominentpractitioners who wrote books on the subject andconducted large-scale London practices, there weremany provincial ɹgures who were genuinelyacquainted with the basic principles of judicialastrology. Edward Banbury, a Glastonburyapothecary, for example, was asked in 1653 tohelp in a case of stolen goods. He looked in abook, and wrote out a note, for which he chargedtwo shillings. Accused before the quarter sessions"},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"of practising magic, he protested that he worked‘according to the rules of astrology and not by adiabolical art’. He may in fact have been a pupil ofWilliam Lilly. Not far away was Jasper Bale ofCheddon Fitzpaine, near Taunton, who alsopurported to ɹnd stolen goods by ‘rules ofastrology’, though with a uniform lack ofsuccess.91 Such people could be found in mostparts of England. William Ramesey, physician toCharles II, thought there were astrologers ‘in everytown and country’.92 There were after all severalhundred almanac-makers in the seventeenthcentury and many of these were practisingastrologers. But there must have been far morepractitioners at a humbler level. So often it is onlyan accident which makes us aware of theirexistence at all. Edward Ashmore, for example, aNottingham cordwainer in the 1680s, is onlyknown because he happened to be involved in aChancery suit, during which his astrologicalactivities were exposed in an eʃort to discredithim as a witness. The resulting depositions revealthat Ashmore had given hundreds of consultationsduring the course of his career.93The elite of the astrological profession, however,"},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"was to be found in London, and it was the midseventeenth century which saw it at the peak of itsinɻuence. How far the activities of William Lillyand his associates constituted a genuineastrological revival, how far the Interregnummerely brought into the open what had long beenpractised underground, is diɽcult to determine.Lilly himself disparaged the achievements of hispredecessors and was happy to see himself as thechief restorer of ‘this art which was almost lost,not only here but almost all Europe over’.94 Othercontemporary testimony supports the view thatastrology attained an unprecedented vogue duringthe Interregnum. Judicial astrology, thoughtNathanael Homes in 1652, had been ‘heeded moreof late with us than ever was (to our shame let itbe spoken) in any Christian Commonwealth sincethe Creation’. It was, agreed Thomas Gataker inthe following year, ‘a practice grown of late withus into great esteem’. And, looking back from thenext century, Daniel Defoe asserted that in theyears immediately before the Great Plague of 1665‘the people... were more addicted to propheciesand astrological conjurations... than ever theywere before or since’.95"},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"It is hard to assess such claims. Where earlierevidence survives, as in the elaborate case-booksof the late Elizabethan astrologer SimonForman,96 it suggests that the demand forastrological advice was as great then as it everwas during the Interregnum. The literature ofprognostication had an unbroken historythroughout the sixteenth century, while the sales ofthe almanacs testify to the Tudor taste forastrological forecasts. But the mid seventeenthcentury saw a new departure in two respects: ɹrst,in the extensive publication of astrologicalhandbooks in English, and second, in the publicityand relative freedom which the astrologersenjoyed. A formal Society of Astrologers wasconstituted, and is known to have had annualdinners in London most years between 1649 and1658, and to have been temporarily revived in1682. It appointed stewards, arranged an annualsermon, and banned the discussion of politics. In1649 it had a membership of over forty. It thusconstituted a notable would-be scientiɹcorganization, a full decade before the formation ofthe Royal Society.97 The leading astrologicalmasters had pupils who came to study with them,"},{"pageNumber":621,"pageContent":"and admirers who corresponded from all parts ofthe country. Lilly, in particular, built up a largepersonal following. By 1647 he could claim tohave ‘made more scholars in this profession thanall that profess this art in England’.98 A listsurvives of his west country ‘scholars’ and he hadother admirers and disciples in Cambridge,Lancashire, Northamptonshire, Norwich, Rutlandand Wiltshire, and many other parts of England.Clients and inquiries came to him from as faraɹeld as Naples, Madrid and Barbados.99 WilliamHills, a miller at Birden, Essex, confessed in 1651to having helped people to recover stolen goods‘by the art of astrology which he learned of MrLilly’. Thirty years later Anne Kingsbury told theMayor of Bridgwater that it was Lilly who hadtaught her to use divining rods to find treasure.100Lilly was thus at the centre of the charmed circleof astrologers, and it is fortunate that these are themembers of the profession about whom mostevidence has survived. The nature of their businesscan be broadly inferred from their publishedhandbooks, which outline the method of setting ahoroscope and explain how to resolve the type ofquestions most likely to be asked. But a much more"},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"revealing source of information is to be found inthe remarkable series of case-books, subsequentlyacquired by the virtuoso Elias Ashmole, and nowpart of his collection of books and manuscripts inthe Bodleian Library. With the aid of these uniquedocuments it is possible to reconstruct in detail theworking of a seventeenth-century astrologicalpractice, and it is to them that we must now turn.4. In the consulting-roomThe astrologers whose activities are best illustratedby the Ashmolean manuscripts are Simon Forman,William Lilly and John Booker, all of whompractised in London. There is also a long run ofcase-books kept by Richard Napier, who as rectorof Great Linford, Buckinghamshire, practised acombination of astrology and medicine for overforty years until his death in 1634. Of the four theearliest was Forman (1552–1611), a Wiltshiremanwho gave up schoolmastering to practise medicinein London on and oʃ from 1583 until his death.During his career he acquired a good deal ofnotoriety as magician, alchemist and astrologer.He was persecuted as an unlicensed practitionerby both Church and Royal College of Physicians,"},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":"and underwent several brief periods ofimprisonment. His posthumous reputation took afurther downward step in 1615, when theinvestigation into the poisoning of Sir ThomasOverbury revealed his association with theCountess of Essex and other court ladies. The briskaccount of his secret life contained in his privatepapers shows that his sexual reputation was notunjustiɹed (in the mid nineteenth century theCamden Society projected an edition of hispersonal diary, but according to the Dictionary ofNational Biography, ‘the astrologer's frankconfession of his immoral habits led the committeeto cancel the publication after a few sheets hadpassed through the press’). Although the College ofPhysicians considered Forman to be ignorant ofastrology, the University of Cambridge gave him alicence to practise medicine. His personal papersshow him to have been a meticulous practitioner,who kept records of his cases in considerabledetail.101John Booker (1603–67) was a more respectedɹgure. He was born in Manchester and had beenboth haberdasher's apprentice and writing-masterbefore taking up astrology in 1630. He published"},{"pageNumber":624,"pageContent":"almanacs from 1631 and the records of hisextensive practice as an astrological consultantsurvive from 1648. During the Civil War he wasappointed licenser of mathematical books, anironical case of poacher turned gamekeeper, sincehe had himself been in trouble with the HighCommission for putting out unlicensed almanacsduring the previous decade. Booker's records arealso meticulously kept, but in shorthand.102Lilly (1602–81) had also come to London as ayoung man to make a career. His father was apoor Leicestershire yeoman and Lilly began as adomestic servant, but made good by marrying hismaster's widow. He learned astrology in seven oreight weeks in 1632 and began to practiseseriously in 1641. His ɹrst almanac came out in1644 and was followed by a spate of publications.He enjoyed a great deal of political inɻuence andwas the acknowledged leader of his profession. Hiscase-books throw light upon his consulting-practice, but he himself remains a deviouscharacter, and his Autobiography leaves manyquestions unanswered.103All three sets of case-books contain the sametype of material – astrological ɹgures,"},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"accompanied, usually but not always, by the nameor description of the client who had occasionedthem, and the nature of his or her problem. Theclient normally consulted the astrologer in person,but sometimes might do so by letter or messenger.On receipt of the question the astrologer recordedthe precise time at which it had been asked, drewup his horoscope, pondered over it and thenannounced his ɹndings. The whole operationmight take less than a quarter of an hour.104Unfortunately the notebooks usually leave usignorant of what the client was ultimately told.The immediate impression made by thenotebooks is that of the enormous volume ofbusiness these men handled. Between 1597 and1601 Forman set an average of over 1,000 ɹguresa year, and the inquiries received from his patientswere well in excess of this number. Lilly's case-books, which survive intermittently between 1644and 1666, reveal a rapidly rising practice which,at its peak, was approaching 2,000 cases a year.John Booker, for whom the most complete recordshave survived, averaged roughly 1,000 cases ayear from 1648 to 1665; he dealt withapproximately 16,500 inquiries over the whole"},{"pageNumber":626,"pageContent":"period.105 When it is recalled that these four werenot necessarily the busiest106 of the 200 andupward astrologers who are known for certain tohave ɻourished between the accession of ElizabethI and the death of Anne, some impression can begained of the remarkable extent to which theEnglish people had recourse to astrologicaldivination during the period.The registers are too erratic to lend themselvesto statistical summary, but they show the maintypes of cases with which the astrologers dealt.Like the wizards they oʃered a procedure for therecovery of lost property. Most of the clients underthis heading seem to have been housewives insearch of mislaid bits of crockery and stolenwashing, or servants from great households whocame to inquire after missing silver or othervaluables. In 1646–7, for example, Lilly was askedby various clients about plate lost in Gray's Inn;about £150 missing from a ship belonging to aSpanish merchant; about a robbery at a publichouse called the ‘Cardinal Wolsey’ and about £20stolen from ‘a fat woman in Southwark’.107 Whenin the winter of 1569–70 the stationer WilliamBedo wanted to trace money which had been"},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":"stolen from a friend's house in Kent, he inquired inOxford for someone to help him, and was referredto John Bowckeley, scholar of New Inn, who castan astrological ɹgure for him, though withoutsuccess.108 At St John's College, Oxford, in the1590's Robert Fludd was asked by his tutor to useastrology to ɹnd out who had robbed him.Similarly in 1637 John Rogers, an apothecary, hadimmediate recourse to a London astrologer whenhis copy of Gerard's Herball was stolen from hisshop.109 Usually the astrologer gave a physicaldescription of the culprit rather than putting aname to him. The carrier who was robbed at aninn in St Ives in 1505 secured a description of thethief from a London astrologer, on the basis ofwhich he arrested the innkeeper's son.Unfortunately he had omitted to check in advancewhether the youth had the discoloured teethmentioned in the description. When the boy wasmade to open his mouth, he revealed a set ofimpeccable molars, thus discomɹting the carrierand provoking a counter-action for unlawfularrest.110To the problem of missing goods was allied thatof missing persons. In an age of desperately slow"},{"pageNumber":628,"pageContent":"communications there were many distraught wiveswho had had no news of their husbands after longabsence on business or at sea. The astrologersspecialized in locating the whereabouts of themissing persons and had rules to determine everyconceivable detail relating to their health andgeneral condition.111 They catered for clients likeAnna Overbury, who came in 1595 to SimonForman about her husband, who had been at seain a man-of-war for eighteen weeks, or Alice Whiteof Grub Street, who consulted another astrologerin 1617 ‘for the return of her husband, being 366miles from London’.112 Lilly's case-books are fullof wives seeking to know whether their husbandsare dead or alive; indeed it is hard to think of asource which gives a more vivid indication of thehuman suʃering caused by the Civil War than dothese neatly-kept registers. Long after the ɹghtinghad stopped the inquiries still kept coming in.When in July 1649 a baker's wife asked after herhusband, who had gone to be a soldier in 1643,Lilly informed her that he had died ɹve yearspreviously.113 Perhaps she was relieved by thenews.The naval adventures of the 1650s similarly took"},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"their toll in human anxiety. During a few weeks inthe summer of 1645 Lilly was asked by one clientwhether her husband, a ship's carpenter capturedby Prince Rupert, was still alive; by another whathad happened to her spouse, a surgeon who hadgone in the ship Charity to Virginia, and by a thirdabout a trooper who had been sent to Ireland threeyears previously.114 In the following year he wasconsulted by relatives of men serving in the ɻeetsof Blake and Penn or trading in Spain at the timeof the commercial embargo imposed by theSpanish government in retaliation for Cromwell'sattack on the West Indies.115The astrologers also gave advice to employersabout runaway servants, and assisted such worriedmen as Thomas Pitches, under-keeper at theLudgate gaol, who in 1640 had managed to lose aprisoner committed to his charge.116 In 1528,when the Lutheran heretic, Thomas Garret, ɻedfrom Oxford to avoid arrest, the Warden of NewCollege and the Bishop's Commissary employed anastrologer to work out the direction he hadtaken.117 Similarly in 1652, when the Royalist,Lieutenant-General John Middleton, escaped fromthe Tower, it was not long before John Booker was"},{"pageNumber":630,"pageContent":"dealing with an anxious inquiry as to hiswhereabouts.118 Later in the century JohnWhalley, a Dublin astrologer, was asked by theauthorities to work out where the Duke ofMonmouth was hiding.119Missing ships could also be located byastrological means. Many shipowners seem tohave gone straight to the astrologer if their ves-selswere unaccountably delayed. Indeed the seafaringcommunity may have formed as much as a sixth ofLilly's clientele.120 In the later Elizabethan periodthe great sea captain Sir William Monson did nothesitate to consult Simon Forman about theprospects for an impending voyage; and in 1603Forman was asked by Mr Leate (probably themerchant Nicholas Leate) to determine whether ornot there was a northern passage to Cathay.Forman's relationship with Monson was intimate,and involved frequent advice on legal and moneymatters; he was also consulted by Lady Monsonduring her husband's absence at sea.121 In 1602 hewas in Plymouth making calculations about theprospects for the Queen's ships.122After Forman's day astrologers continued to deal"},{"pageNumber":631,"pageContent":"with the otherwise intractable problem of missingships. The notebooks of Lilly and his colleaguescontain the names of scores of ships inquired afterby their owners, or by relatives of the crew. Theastrologers chose appropriate days for launching aship or beginning a voyage, and gave advice tomany sailors pondering the dangers of an oceanvoyage to Barbados, Virginia or Morocco.123 Theyoʃered reassurance to nervous’ passengers,worried about the risk of drowning, and tobusinessmen wondering whether to take shares outin a particular ship, or uneasy about the reasonsfor its delay. During the Civil War period, theydealt with questions about the risk of pirates or ofinterception by the enemy at sea.124 At the end ofthe seventeenth century the inhabitants of Jamaicawere said to be reluctant to go to sea without ɹrstconsulting an astrologer; and even in the middle ofthe eighteenth century it was customary in NorthAmerica for a horoscope to be cast to determinesailing-dates.125A sceptic observed that, if the astrologers reallyknew so much about the fate of ships at sea, theycould have made their fortunes by dabbling inmarine insurance, and advising the insurers how"},{"pageNumber":632,"pageContent":"to collect easy proɹts.126 In fact astrologers werefrequently consulted on insurance problems duringthese early days of marine insurance. Lilly's case-books contain several entries relating to clientswho came to ask him whether or not to insure aship.127 Indeed he made advertising copy out ofthe fact that he had correctly conɹrmed the safetyof a ship reported lost en route to Spain in 1644,even though the insurers were so convinced of itsloss that they had refused to accept a premium ofsixty per cent.128 John Gadbury, in his elaborateguide to astrological lore for seamen, gave severalexamples of cases in which he claimed to havesaved shipowners thousands of pounds ininsurance premiums. He had also advised suchwell-known contemporary sea captains as SirFrescheville Holles, and Owen Cox.129On other business problems the astrologers wereequally forthcoming. The prognostications in theiralmanacs were intended to predict ‘every yearwhat things shall be dear and what good cheap’, asone guide put it.130 In the sixteenth century thegreat Antwerp merchants had employedastrologers to forecast market ɻuctuations,131 and"},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":"in seventeenth-century England there were manybusinessmen who turned to them in an eʃort toreduce the uncertainties inherent in theiroccupation. There were inquiries about theadvisability of buying houses, horses, ships,copyholds, and every other commodity. Womenasked how they should invest their annuities orwhether to set up a shop. Margaret Crew in 1616wanted ‘to know what proɹt will come by twistingof silver’. A more ambitious speculator asked aboutthe prospects of a project to transport men intoItaly.132 There was scarcely any form of businessspeculation upon which the astrologers were notasked to pronounce. When the great wood-carver,Grinling Gibbons, embarked in 1682 upon ‘aconcern of great consequence’ which involvedsending a factor overseas, he felt it necessary toseek Ashmole's astrological advice as to whether ornot the venture was likely to be a success.133When all went wrong the astrologer couldconduct the inquest.

Had anyone spoiledhis credit by malice: and (by the way) when wouldhis father die, and to whom would his estate beleft?135In such ways an inquiry about the past subtlyturned into speculation about the future. On anumber of occasions Lilly was asked to predict theresult of a particular legal action, presumably sothat the client would know whether it was worthcontinuing to ɹght it.136 One customer askeddespairingly in September 1649 if he would ‘everhave justice’.137 Others showed anxiety about theplight of the condemned. One woman wanted toknow if her husband would be executed forstealing thirty bullocks; another ‘if her friend inNewgate should be hanged’.138 In 1592 thesuspected Catholic, Mrs Shelley, asked JohnFletcher, the Cambridge astrologer, whether hercondemned husband had a chance of escapingexecution.139 It was probably because so many of"},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"his clients were on the wrong side of the law thatSimon Forman devised rules to reveal ‘whether aman's house hath been searched or not byofficers’.140 Pinned inside one of Booker's case-books is an illiterate missive from one ThomasWilson:Ser my desier is you would be pleased to anser methes queareyes I am indetted and am in danger ofaresting.

Matthew Andrewsasked Lilly in 1670 whether he should proceed todeal with Lord St Albans for the purchase of theRegister's place in Chancery and a commissioner'splace in the Navy.142 Dr Thomas Whartoninquired of Ashmole in 1650 whether he wouldever be elected a Fellow of the Royal College ofPhysicians.143 Such questions throw light upon the"},{"pageNumber":636,"pageContent":"querent's aspirations, though not all are as crudeas that put to Forman by a gentlewoman in 1597,whose husband had gone to sea with the Earl ofEssex and who ‘demanded in his absence whethershe should be a Lady or not’.144 At times theastrologer may appear to have been little morethan a high-grade tipster. Richard Napier wasasked who would win the cup at Stamford races.John Booker was asked questions about the resultsof cock-ɹghts. Lilly was invited in 1646 to pick outthe winner of a horse-race from ‘the chestnut, thedapple grey and the iron grey’. He tipped thechestnut.145But not all inquiries were so frivolous.Throughout the period the astrologers wereconsulted on matters of high policy and asked topredict the outcome of important political events.Forman was asked about such matters as the 1597session of Parliament, the siege of Ostend, the Irishadventures of the Earl of Essex, and the search forThomas Percy, one of the Gunpowder Plotters.146Ashmole was plied by Sir Robert Howard withquestions about the likely course of relationsbetween Charles II and the Cavalier Parliament.Howard was Secretary to the Treasury"},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"Commissioners between 1671 and 1673, and by allaccounts a very bad one. It is touching that one ofhis questions was whether Parliament would‘proceed to the removing of great men who mayappear not to have managed things or counsels soregularly and well as might be wished’.147 Morestriking is the revelation that Ashmole wasconsulted by Charles II himself, who wantedastrological advice about his future relations withParliament, and an astrologically propitiousmoment for delivering the speech which he madeto Parliament on 27 October 1673.148 When soskilful a politician as the King himself felt it worthseeking aid from such a quarter it is not surprisingthat so many lesser men did the same. Anothernotable consultation was that of Mrs Cellier, ‘thePopish midwife’, with John Gadbury, to determinewhether Thomas Dangerɹeld would be a suitableaccomplice in the so-called Meal Tub Plot of 1680to murder Charles II.149The case-books illustrate many problems ofconduct and allegiance generated by the CivilWar. Lilly was only once asked the most basic ofcontemporary questions – ‘whether best to adhereto King or Parliament?’150 – but he had plenty of"},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":"clients seeking to know whether they should enlistand how they would be expected to fare if theydid. ‘If good for the son to go to war, and if returnsafe?’ – Mr Whitby's question of March 1644echoed the fears of many less courageousParliamentary supporters. (A Roundhead himself,Lilly judged he would return safely, ‘and withreputation’).151 There were many clients likeCaptain Willoughby, who wanted to know whetherhe would prosper in the war, and Mr Robinson,who asked whether he would do better to seek civilor military preferment.152 On the Royalist sidewas Lady Holborne, who asked Lilly in the autumnof 1645 whether her husband, Sir Robert, shouldmake terms with Parliament.153 But the mostremarkable of all these appeals for advice was thatof Richard Overton, one of the leaders of theLeveller party, who in April 1648 sent a note toLilly asking ‘whether, by joining with the agents ofthe private soldiery of the Army for theredemption of common right and freedom to theland and removal of oppressions from the people,my endeavours shall be prosperous or no’.Overton, a modern historian has remarked, was ‘arationalist over whom dogma had all but lost its"},{"pageNumber":639,"pageContent":"hold’. There is no stronger testimony to the appealof astrological advice in the mid seventeenthcentury than this request by one of the mostsophisticated and ‘rationalist’ of contemporarypolitical thinkers.154In addition to helping with personal decisions,Lilly was also asked to resolve a variety of militaryand political issues. Would Basing-House be taken?When would Pontefract surrender? Was it true thatthe King had taken Cambridge? Would he bringtroops over from Ireland?155 In 1645 Lilly toldBulstrode Whitelocke that, if the Parliamentaryforces could avoid a ɹght before the 11th of June,they would win their greatest victory. He was dulygratiɹed by the result at Naseby on the 14th.156When the war was over Lilly set ɹgures on thequarrel between Parliament and the Army, andwas invited by Sir Thomas Myddleton of Chirk tocalculate how long Presbyterianism might beexpected to last.157 The conɹscations of the landsbelonging to Crown, Church and Royalists arereɻected in the many questions posed byspeculators, anxious to know whether theirpurchases were a safe investment, or delinquents,"},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":"still hoping to recover their property.158 TheParliamentary Visitation of the University ofOxford led one hopeful aspirant to ask in February1648, ‘If purging of the University will succeed’,and ‘if the querent's son will come in [as a]Fellow’.159 During the Commonwealth andProtectorate Lilly set ɹgures on the outcome ofParliamentary elections and on the business beforethe Protector and his Council.160 There wasvirtually no contemporary political problem whichdid not sooner or later turn up in his consulting-room.But if one question stands out from all the othersby the frequency with which it was asked, it is‘Quid agendum?’, as Lilly used to note it down inhis dog Latin – ‘what is to be done?’. For it was theneed to make decisions which brought men andwomen to the astrologer's studio. These decisionswere as various as could be. Some related to thechoice of a career, for, since the astrologers heldthat the time of a man's birth determined hisgeneral aptitudes, they felt well qualiɹed to adviseon this matter. Forman, for example, had a set ofrules showing ‘in what trade or science a man shallbest... live by’.161 In 1664 John Cocke, a twenty-"},{"pageNumber":641,"pageContent":"year-old student at the Middle Temple, presentedBooker with a comprehensive questionnaire,ranging from the suitability of the Law as a career,to his prospects of marriage and future estate.162Richard Hunt wrote from Cambridge in 1649 toask Lilly which subject he should read, OrientalLanguages or Divinity.163 Apprentices askedwhether or not they should stay with their presentmasters.164As might have been expected, there was anincessant stream of servant girls asking about theirfuture husbands, or wanting to know how tohandle their current boy-friends. ‘If have the mannow wooing? If not, what kind of man?’ Or, asone maiden put it, ‘Of two propounded which toaccept?165 These enquiries to Lilly are typical ofhundreds. A female weaver wanted to know ‘if herfriend loved her as he should love her’. Joan Jonesof the Strand asked whether John Fuller was likelyto marry her. (It may have been the informationthat she was ‘no maid’ which led the astrologer topronounce that he would not. A similar entry is inLilly's case-book for 1646: ‘One got with child; ifthe man would marry her?’) Another girl askedForman whether the man oʃering her marriage"},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":"did so in good faith.166 There were sensitiveclients, like the anonymous querent who wasworried whether a gentleman ‘were vexed atreceipt of a letter’, and lofty ones, like the ladywho asked Lilly ‘if good to marry the little man’. Itsays something for the astrologer's common sensethat the answer to the latter was a ɹrmnegative.167In addition to the plethora of maidservantsasking if their masters loved them, and widowswondering whether or not to remarry, there weremale clients with similar problems. For theseForman had drawn up a comprehensive set ofastrological rules. How rich was the proposedbride? Was she really in love? Was she not really awhore? Was the wife an adultress? Whatever thequestion, ‘Oracle Forman’, as Ben Jonson calledhim, had an answer.168 Delicate family problemswere meat and drink to the astrologers. Theycatered for husbands worried about the legitimacyof their children, employers like Napier's clientwho wanted to know ‘whether his servant's childwere his’ and the bastard who wanted Lilly to tellhim who his father was.169 A lady who hadquarrelled with her lover asked if he would carry"},{"pageNumber":643,"pageContent":"out his threat to publish her letters; a younggentleman wanted to know ‘if some gentlewomanintended not to put a trick upon him’; a wife askedif she would ‘have the better of her husband’; amaidservant inquired ‘if her mother-in-law woulddo her prejudice’; a young man sought to know‘what his father will do for him’; a worried coupleasked for the horoscope of their son, ‘ever runningaway from his parents’.170 Sooner or later everykind of domestic entanglement was ventilated inthe astrologer's consulting-room.Particularly revealing was the frequent inquiryabout the life-expectation of close relatives. In1615 Mary Worship of Coleman Street madetactful inquiries of an astrologer about the size ofher husband's estate,171 and there were many ofLilly's female clients who wanted to know whenthey would enjoy their jointures. Astrologers, likecunning men, were often asked by husbands orwives whether they would outlive their partners. Itwas a stock question for Forman, and Lilly waspresented with it on at least thirteen separateoccasions in 1644–5.172 In the Character of aQuack Astrologer (1673) a satirist spoke trulyenough of how ‘the young gallant bribes him with"},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"a guinea to know when his miserable father willhave the civility to go to heaven’. Lilly advised hiscolleagues to be wary about prognosticating theexact time of anyone's death, explaining that hepersonally tried to avoid giving ɹrm answers. Thetrouble was, he admitted, that there was a greatdemand for such information, since ‘the knowledgehereof is of excellent use for such as wouldpurchase any lease or oɽce, or thing for life orlives’.173The remaining major department of theastrologers’ art was medicine. The thorough-goingastrological doctor proceeded entirely by the starsand did not even demand to see the patient. SimonForman, for example, assured the Royal College ofPhysicians in 1593 that he used no help to knowdiseases, other than an Ephemeris, and that bycelestial signs, aspects and constellations he couldtell at once what the cause of the illness mightbe.174 Richard Napier was similarly said to treathis patients’ illness as straight horaryquestions.175 There was no false modesty aboutsuch practitioners. ‘It hath been many timesexperimented and proved,’ declared one textbook,‘that that which many physicians could not cure or"},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"remedy with their greatest and strongestmedicines, the astronomer hath brought to passwith one simple herb, by observing the moving ofthe stars.’176 These ‘students of physic andastrology’, as they liked to style themselves, ‘piss-prophets’ as their enemies preferred to call them,sometimes wrote quite elaborate treatises on theastrological diagnosis of disease.177 But it issigniɹcant that Forman also made calculations toshow ‘what proɹt and commodity the physicianshall have by the sick person, and whether the sickwill pay him well or no’.178The astrologers were further expected todiagnose pregnancy, estimate how the motherwould fare when her labour started, andprognosticate the sex of the unborn child.179 Theirconsulting-rooms were full of women madedesperate by prolonged and unaccountablechildlessness, in an age when childbearing wasregarded as their prime social duty and when somuch could depend upon inheritance and theperpetuation of the family line. Were they capableof having children, and, above all, would theyhave a son? This was the burden of numerousinquiries by well-to-do women, and it presented"},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"many problems. When Lady Ersɹeld came inDecember 1635 to ask Richard Napier whether shewas pregnant, the answer seemed easy. ‘Withchild, and did look it’, he entered in his case-book.But a few weeks later she was back again, and thistime there was a new diagnosis: ‘Not with child;stomach ill; body swelled.’ Another of Napier'spatients had ceased to have her menstrual periodsafter an accident in a ɹre. Did this mean that shewas now pregnant?180 Lilly, who had devisedastrological rules telling him ‘how the mother shalldo in travail’, must have used them in December1646 to answer a client who wanted to know if hewould ‘lose his wife in travail of childbirth’.181Even professional midwives had recourse toastrologers, though it is to be hoped that not manyfound themselves in the position of the midwifeMrs Nicholson, who rushed for an astrologer's aidin 1614 ‘on an accident happening to agentlewoman’.182The general impression given by the case-booksis that Lilly dealt with his patients sensiblyenough, and his remedies, so far as they arerecorded, were not necessarily particularlyastrological in character. He was prepared to"},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":"prescribe medicine, and, on at least one occasion,chose to refer his client to a doctor. On another hewas merely asked to recommend whether thepatient should consult a young doctor or an oldone.183 But, like all the astrologers, he wasprepared to admit the possibility of witchcraft andhad rules to determine whether or not it was thecause of his patients’ suʃerings. Many suspicionsof this kind came his way.184The case-books also illustrate the contemporaryfascination with hidden treasure. Forman, Napier,Culpepper, Gadbury and others drew upastrological rules for calculating the whereaboutsof buried treasure.185 Forman was asked in 1597to determine whether there was treasure hidden ina house formerly inhabited by Sir FrancisDrake.186 Lilly's clients included ‘two who diggedfor treasure’. His correspondence included a letterfrom Limerick, where in 1654 there was rumouredto be ‘abundance of... treasure’, oʃering him ɹftyper cent of the proceeds if he could ɹnd it.Ashmole also set ɹgures about hidden treasure;and as late as 1697 an astrologer was reported tohave succeeded in ɹnding treasure hidden by"},{"pageNumber":648,"pageContent":"Jesuits at the Savoy.187The astrologers were also consulted by seekersafter the philosopher's stone. Forman ruled that‘the science of alchemy belongeth to the ninthhouse’, and endeavoured by astrology andgeomancy to divine both his own prospects andthose of interested clients.188 Lilly and Bookerwere occasionally asked to assess a client's chancesof alchemical success. In his textbook Lilly reportshaving told a client that he would only ruin hishealth if he persisted in the quest, though he hadevery conɹdence that the philosopher's stone couldbe attained. ‘But as it is a blessing beyond allblessings upon earth,’ he wrote, ‘I hold that it isgiven but to very few, and to those few rather byrevelation of the good angels of God than theproper industry of man.’189The incomplete nature of the annotations in thecase-books makes it impossible to produce exactɹgures for each type of inquiry.

But the main topicsof inquiry are clear. Personal relationships,business and journey prospects, sickness, lostproperty, and missing persons account (roughly inthat order) for the overwhelming bulk of theastrologer's business.From this it may be inferred that there were twopredicaments which most commonly drove theclient to the astrologer. The ɹrst was the need forinformation which no other agency would provide– the whereabouts of some lost goods, a missingship or an absent person; the diagnosis of adisease which ordinary doctors could not identify.The second was the need, not for information butfor advice – although this need might well bedisguised as a request for information. The verywording of their questions reveals theuncertainties in the clients' minds. ‘What course totake?’ ‘To whom to apply?’ ‘If good to go on?’ ‘Ifgood to be bound surety?’ ‘If have the better of herhusband?’ ‘If she were well dealt with in herbusiness?’ ‘If a trick was put upon her or no?’ ‘Ifsuʃer infamy from a friend?’ ‘If friend faithful inadversity?’ These formulae all come from Lilly's"},{"pageNumber":650,"pageContent":"case-book for 1644–5.190 They show how hisclients, by consulting the astrologer, hoped tolessen their own anxiety.

The astrologer's essential taskwas to help the client make up his own mind andto give him conɹdence in his relations with otherpeople.The clients themselves were drawn from everywalk of life, though here again the lack ofsystematic recording in the notebooks makes anystatistical analysis misleading. The astrologers'enemies liked to dismiss their customers as ‘thesilly sort of ignorant and profane people’,191 andthere is no denying that domestic servants, seamenand other members of the lower classes wereprominent among Lilly's clientele. So were themany foreigners and rootless sojourners in theever-growing metropolis. Over a third of Lilly'sclients in one sample are simply labelled ancilla(female servant).

AfterFrances Pranell had made a clandestine marriagewith Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, in 1600, itwas to him that she went, to know whether shewas pregnant and, if not, when she would be.195Another of his clients was the Countess of Essex,whose advisers included the woman astrologer,Anne Taylor of Southwark.196 The notebook ofPatrick Saunders, another practitioner, shows thathe dealt with a case of theft from Sir JohnUnderhill in 1629 and was consulted by Sir WalterCope, Master of the Court of Wards.197 Nicholas"},{"pageNumber":652,"pageContent":"Fiske cast a horoscope for Sir Robert Holborne,Hampden's counsel in the Ship-Money case, andsubsequently Lilly's client and ‘singular friend’.198Richard Napier catered for many gentry and lessernobility.

Lilly used to give medical advice to"},{"pageNumber":653,"pageContent":"the poor for nothing, or for a shilling to half acrown if they chose to oʃer it. But although heurged his colleagues to ‘give freely to the poor,both money and judgement’, he frankly admittedthat he set up practice in London because he saw‘there was money to be got’.203 For routineastrological consultations half a crown wasprobably his standard charge.204 But he got muchmore for providing conɹdential advice to highranking politicians. In 1647 he received twentypieces of gold for recommending to a Royalistintermediary that Charles I should make for Essexif he succeeded in escaping from Hampton Court.In 1649 he entered the employment of theCommonwealth Council of State, at the rate of £50down, and an annual pension of £100.205 He alsoearned money from pupils. In 1640 JohnHumphrey paid him £40 for tuition and wouldgladly have given him £200 for some additionalsecrets, which the master, however, preferred tokeep to himself.206 A growing practice and avoluminous range of publications gave him arespectable competence.

It oʃered a systematic scheme ofexplanation for all the vagaries of human andnatural behaviour, and there was in principle noquestion which it could not answer. ‘Who thatknew well astronomy,’ wrote a medievalauthority, ‘there is nothing in the world of whichhe could enquire by reason but he should haveknowledge thereof.’1 Every earthly occurrence wascapable of astrological explanation. As Lillypointed out in his Christian Astrology (1647), therewas ‘nothing appertaining to the life of man inthis world which in one way or another hath notrelation to one of the twelve houses of heaven’.2 Itwas this comprehensiveness which made the art socompelling. In the absence of any rival system ofscientiɹc explanation, and in particular of thesocial sciences – sociology, social anthropology,social psychology – there was no other existingbody of thought, religion apart, which even beganto oʃer so all-embracing an explanation for thebaʀing variousness of human aʃairs.

For a longtime the alternative was stark; either one acceptedastrological teachings, or, as John Gadbury put itin 1674, one had to admit one's ignorance of thetrue causes of events, and ‘be content to rank themamong the occult qualities of nature of which nocertain reason can be given’.3As a starting-point, the astrologers set out toexplain why it was that individual human beingdiʃered from each other. It was the inɻuence ofthe heavens at the moment of birth whichaccounted for men's physical characteristics,aptitudes and temperament. Not that other factorswere irrelevant. The astrologers would not haveagreed with George Herbert that the manners ofinfants were ‘moulded more by the example ofparents than by stars at their nativities’,4 but theydid recognize that heredity, environment andeducation all played their part in the formation ofcharacter. The nativity, however, was the basicdeterminant. Not only did it explain humandiʃerences; it also helped to provide a useful"},{"pageNumber":660,"pageContent":"vocabulary with which to describe them. Astrology,it has been justly said, was the ‘ɹrst knownattempt at a complete system of humantypology’.5 So persuasive and plausible was it thatsuch astrologically-derived epithets as ‘jovial’,‘mercurial’, and ‘saturnine’ have retained apermanent place in our language.The disadvantage of the system was its rigidity.Since there was a limited number of planets,houses and signs of the zodiac, the astrologerstended to reduce human potentialities to a set ofɹxed types and to postulate only a limited numberof possible variations. Its more intelligentadherents were well aware of this danger andattempted to devise a more reɹned technique.John Aubrey, for example, was convinced that ‘weare governed by the planets, as the wheels andweights move the hands of a clock’, but he fullyappreciated the inɹnite vagaries of humanpersonality, and the need for an astrologicalvocabulary which would do them justice.Accordingly, when gathering the biographical datawhich were to become famous as the Brief Lives, hewas careful, as beɹtted a Fellow of the RoyalSociety, to note the exact nativity of his subjects"},{"pageNumber":661,"pageContent":"whenever it could be discovered; in this way hehoped to make possible a scientiɹc comparison ofthe course of human life with the astrologicalcircumstances of its inception, and thus to arriveat a more exact astrology.6 As the BaconianJoshua Childrey observed, ‘the way to go forwardin this excellent art is to look back and comparethe accidents of men and states with the inɻuencesof heaven, and this will not only try the truth ofthe old principles, but add new ones: such (it isvery likely) as the sons of art do not yet dreamof’.7From the diʃerences between human beings, theastrologer moved on to the wider issues presentedby the course of history. The political history of anation could to some extent be explained in termsof the individual psychology of its rulers. In an ageof near-absolute monarchy the attention paid tothe horoscopes of royal princes was fully justiɹed.William Camden suggested that astrologicalfactors explained Queen Elizabeth I's infatuationwith the Earl of Leicester.8 John Gadbury assertedthat the whole career of Charles I was implicit inthe astrological circumstances of his nativity.9Others declared that Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden"},{"pageNumber":662,"pageContent":"would never have been killed at Lützen had he notchosen an astrologically unpropitious moment forthe battle.10 The movement of the planets couldaccount for every type of historical occurrence.Jerome Cardan attributed Henry VIII's breach withRome to the conjunction of Mars, Mercury andJupiter in Aries in 1533.11 Henry Coley observedthat ‘Harvey found out the circulation of the bloodupon a conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in theɹery trigon’.12 William Lilly oʃered aninterpretation of the whole of sixteenth-centuryEnglish history based on contemporary planetarymovements. This was an extension of the commonpractice of linking the deaths of kings and greatpersons to the chronology of cometappearances.13Such exercises in astrological history may strikeus today as fundamentally unrewarding, but theirintellectual importance was considerable. Duringthe Italian Renaissance astrological doctrinesabout the recurrence of planetary conjunctionsand their inɻuence upon the course of aʃairs hadhelped to form the concept of a historical ‘period’.The lesser conjunctions (every twenty years), themiddling conjunctions (every 240 years) and the"},{"pageNumber":663,"pageContent":"great conjunctions (every 960 years) gave unity tosegments of the otherwise inɹnite andindistinguishable ɻow of human events.14 Suchastrological doctrines inɻuenced Englishhistoriography during the sixteenth andseventeenth centuries. The historical speculationsof men like Lilly and Gadbury were usually outsidethe main stream of contemporary historicalwriting, but the currents sometimes converged. SirIsaac Newton's well-known attempt to useastronomical data to reconstruct the otherwise lostchronology of the ancient world (The Chronology ofAncient Kingdoms amended [1728]), was theproduct of an intellectual milieu in which arelationship between the history of stars and ofnations had long been assumed.15Like the ancient climatic theory, whichattributed diʃerences between nations to theirgeography, astrological speculation was anattempt to explain the otherwise inexplicable. Itsgreat merit, thought John Booker, was that ‘it canyield reasons which other arts cannot,’ such as theanswer to the problem of ‘why customs, rites,manners, laws and temperaments be divers [i.e.diʃerent] in people inhabiting in several"},{"pageNumber":664,"pageContent":"climates’.16 As Auguste Comte was to recognize,17the astrologers were pioneering a genuine systemof historical explanation. In their conɹdentassumption that the principles underlying thedevelopment of human society were capable ofhuman explanation, we can detect the germ ofmodern sociology.If any one attitude united the astrologers of theseventeenth century it was an overwhelmingintellectual curiosity – a desire to reduce things toorder, and a conviction that they had the toolswith which to do so. It is exempliɹed in Astro-Meteorologica (1686), the magnum opus of JohnGoad, the crypto-Catholic headmaster of MerchantTaylors' School. This bulky treatise, dedicated toJames II, was an elaborate attempt to ascertainthe inɻuence of the planets upon the weather, andupon human epidemics and misfortunes. It wasbased upon a diary of relevant occurrences kept bythe author for some thirty years, and augmentedby other records of events in England and abroadfrom the year 1500. It aimed to further knowledgeby discovering a coincidence in time betweenparticular happenings and certain planetarydispositions.

Yet anyone whoreads this forgotten work cannot fail to beimpressed by its conscientious and empiricalapproach, and its occasional ɻashes of genuineprescience. Goad, for example, must have beenone of the earliest writers to notice that suiciderates vary according to the time of the year. Heexplained this by invoking the conjunction ofSaturn and Jupiter, a solution which must strike usas absurd; but it must be remembered that moderninvestigators have also been better at noticingvariations in suicide rates than at explainingthem.18 What is impressive is Goad's pioneeringreadiness to find patterns in what had always beenthought of as random behaviour.It was this willingness of the astrologers toproʃer an answer when no other explanation wasforthcoming which helps to account for theirpopular appeal. In 1664 Francis Bernard wrote toLilly, outlining a new theory about the causes ofthe many contemporary outbreaks of ɹre. He had,he explained, long entertained the hypothesis that"},{"pageNumber":666,"pageContent":"horoscopes could be cast for cities, just as for men.The diɽculty hitherto had been that, whereas theexact moment of a man's birth could usually beascertained, it was virtually impossible to identifythe nativity of a town, ‘most cities havingincreased insensibly and the dates of their ɹrstrising being either disputed or forgotten’. ButBernard had hit upon a substitute method. Thiswas to treat ɹres as if they were analogous tofevers in men. A city's nativity could then bereconstructed from its ‘accidents’. By ascertainingthe astrological circumstances of London ɹres,from the burning of London Bridge in 1212onwards, Bernard had convinced himself that hehad hit upon London's horoscope, and to his greatdelight was now frequently able to predict theexact weeks in which future London ɹres could beexpected. Encouraged by his success for London,he proposed to do the same for Amsterdam. ‘Timeonly will show us whether we may direct the fateof cities as of men.’19The absence of any alternative also left the wayopen for an astrological explanation of plague. AsGadbury rightly claimed, ‘no other art,whatsoever, is capable of predictions of this"},{"pageNumber":667,"pageContent":"kind’.20 An astrological interpretation had beenthe one most favoured by intellectuals at the timeof the Black Death,21 and it remained widelycurrent until the epidemics ceased in the laterseventeenth century. It ɹtted in well with thefashionable miasma theory, for the changing stateof the heavens oʃered a plausible explanation forthe putrefaction of the air: when the stars broughtheat and moisture it was natural that decay shouldset in.22The theory was tested in a way which was by nomeans unscientiɹc. The astrologers listed all thegreat plagues of the past. They compared themwith what was known about the positions of theheavenly bodies at the time, and they arrived at acorrelation between the two.23 Thereafter theyfelt able to predict both the incidence and theduration of any serious outbreak. Forman hadrules to forecast the weekly number of deaths.24Gadbury boasted that the Great Plague of 1665had been foretold both by himself and by four ofhis colleagues.25 Astrologers could thus refute thenotion that plagues recurred every twentyyears,26 or the theory, made plausible by the great"},{"pageNumber":668,"pageContent":"plagues of 1603 and 1625, that the cause of theepidemics was the death of the reigningmonarch.27 Other sicknesses were also accountedfor astrologically. John Caius invoked planetaryconjunctions as a partial explanation for the‘sweat’.28 John Goad did the same in 1679 in aletter to Ashmole ‘concerning our coughs, and theincrease of the Mortality Bill’. Such events, hedeclared, could not be understood ‘without theastrologer, who gives the wonderful cause of theinequalities of the air, and the strange secretpowers of planets’. He recalled how in 1675Charles II had asked him what the cause of thecoughs might be. ‘I knew not then,’ he confessed,‘but now I think...’29It is not necessary to follow Goad along the pathtaken by his esprit d'escalier to see how sheerintellectual pleasure was the driving-force behindsuch eʃorts. ‘The world understands not how nobleour contemplation is,’ he wrote, ‘and whatsatisfaction we take when we see the heavens obeyour prediction.’30 It is no coincidence that a highproportion of the pamphlets attacking astrologywere by authors who had themselves been"},{"pageNumber":669,"pageContent":"temporarily enmeshed in its spells.31 But thetrouble was that the subject was ill-ɹtted to be-come a real experimental science. The carefulcorrelation of past events with the movement ofthe heavens was the key to the whole endeavour,but life moved too slowly for quick results. If thegreat conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter onlyoccurred once every 800 years, observed JohnSelden, it was going to be diɽcult to verify orrefute any theories relating to it.32Such obstacles notwithstanding, the astrologicalexplanation of personal misfortune seems to haveappealed to clients. When Wil-am Bredon's twodaughters died in successive months, theirbereaved father wrote to Richard Napier to discuss‘the astrological cause’ for the tragedy.33 Many ofthe clients who entered an astrologer's consulting-room were seeking an explanation for the sundrymisfortunes which had beset them – illness,sterility, miscarriage, political failure, bankruptcy.No doubt it was more comforting to learn that onehad been crossed at birth than to be told that onehad no one to blame for one's misfortunes butoneself. John Aubrey was able to console himselffor his sundry worldly failures with Henry Coley's"},{"pageNumber":670,"pageContent":"opinion that he had since birth been ‘labouringunder a crowd of ill directions’.34 The Elizabethanherald and historian, Francis Thynne, wrote toBurghley in 1588 attributing his lack of of worldlysuccess to the froward inɻuence of the heavenlybodies.35 Such instances give point to Edmund'ssardonic reflections in King Lear:This is the excellent foppery of the world, thatwhen we are sick in fortune – often the surfeit ofour own behaviour – we make guilty of ourdisasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: as if wewere villains by necessity, fools by heavenlycompulsion, knaves, thieves and treachers byspherical predominance; drunkards, liars andadulterers by an enforced obedience of planetaryinɻuence; and all that we are evil in, by a divinethrusting on: an admirable evasion ofwhoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition tothe charge of a star!36Astrology could thus appeal as a means ofevading responsibility, removing guilt from bothsuʃerer and society at large.37 Like religion, italso combated the notion that misfortune was"},{"pageNumber":671,"pageContent":"purely random in its incidence. There really wasno such thing as chance in nature, declared theastrologer John Butler.38 Astrological hypothesesexplained everything, from the compatibility oftwo persons in love39 to the unexpected failure ofa surgical operation.40 Those who rejected them,said Sir Christopher Heydon, were left with achoice between two equally unattractive doctrines,the rule of blind chance, or the sovereignty of acapricious deity.41 In the place of suchunpalatable concepts, astrology played the role ofintellectual long-stop.The primary reason for the appeal ofastrological explanation was thus an intellectualone: its provision of a coherent and comprehensivesystem of thought. The second was more practical.For by oʃering men a realistic assessment of theirdispositions the astrologer held out the prospect ofthat greater freedom which comes from self-knowledge. After establishing the client's nativity,explained Lilly, ‘I judge upon the general good orill [which] may befall that party in a naturalcourse of life during his days, as also of histemperament, constitution, qualities, person, etc.Then I direct the advantageous years and"},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"discommodious, either for health, loss of estate,preferment, etc.’42 The attraction of having one'shoroscope cast was not unlike that of undergoingpsychoanalysis today. The reward would be apenetrating analysis of the individual's innermostattributes, the qualities which he should develop,and the limitations against which he should be onhis guard. Of course the astrologers insisted thatthe ɹgure cast at a person's nativity could never bemore than a guide to the possibilities open to him;it did not mean that he was in the clutch of anineluctable destiny. But if there were futurehazards in store it was as well to be apprised ofthem in advance. ‘An expert and prudentastrologer,’ wrote Richard Napier, ‘may throughhis cunning skill show us how to prevent manyevils proceeding from the inɻuence of the stars.’43Or, as another practitioner put it: ‘The use and endof astrology is to discover and make manifest thecauses of those mutations and accidents thathappen in general, as war or peace, dearth orplenty, etc., and particularly to man, as health orsickness, riches, poverty, etc., to the end that, suchaccidents being foreseen, we may as wise menaugment the good, and divert the evil.’44"},{"pageNumber":673,"pageContent":"All the possibilities inherent in a scientiɹcsystem of divination thus appeared to unfold.According to John Aubrey, astrology was ‘the bestguide to direct us to what professions (or callings)children are by nature most ɹt or most inclinedto’;45 and even one of the Tudor clergymen whodenounced astrology for its impiety conceded that‘an astronomer may tell by the observation of thestars to what occupation, to what estate of life,every man is most... apt by nature’.46 JohnGadbury went so far as to propose that entry tothe Universities of Oxford and Cambridge shouldbe restricted to those ‘whose genitures render themcapable of learning what they... teach’.47The astrologers also claimed to predict thecourse of political events. ‘I believe,’ wroteGadbury, ‘that much of the mischief this nation(during its Civil Wars) underwent might (by suchknowledge) have been prevented.’48 If the Scotshad read Lilly's almanac, thought William Paine,they would have known in advance that theirinvasion of England was doomed to defeat.49 In1663 Richard Saunders pointedly drew attention tothe recommendation of his French colleague, J.-B."},{"pageNumber":674,"pageContent":"Morin, that the King should have at least threeastrologers in his private council.50Like other forms of divination astrology helpedmen to take decisions for which there was norational basis.

Other parts gave rulesfor knowing when to engage in a lawsuit, ɹght aduel, or propose marriage.51 By observing themasculine signs in the heavens it was evenpossible to choose the appropriate moment forbegetting a male child. John Case's instructionswere attractively simple: ‘If thou want'st an heir,or man-child to inherit thy land, observe a timewhen the masculine planets and signs ascend, and[are] in full power and force, then take thyfemale, and cast in thy seed, and thou shalt have aman-child.’ Mutatis mutandis, the same instructionswere to be followed for a daughter.52 Blagraveprescribed various herbal medicines to accompanythis formula, which, he declared, had in hisexperience worked very well, ‘always provided thepersons were capable thereof’.53 Astrology,"},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"though beginning as a system of explanation, thusended as one which held out the prospect ofcontrol.

Successes and failuresIt is not diɽcult therefore to appreciate thepsychological appeal of astrological diagnosis,once the premises of the system had beenaccepted. But the problem still remains: whyshould anyone have believed in it in the ɹrstplace? To our eyes the notion that the daily life ofhuman beings should be determined by themotions of the heavenly bodies seems so fantasticthat it is diɽcult to understand how men ofintelligence and perspicacity could ever haveaccepted it. Even some of the modern historianswho write most sympathetically about thegropings of early scientists have tended to becomefacetious or patronizing when confronted by thehistory of astrology and its devotees.At one level it is suɽcient to point out thatastrological doctrines followed from the accepted"},{"pageNumber":676,"pageContent":"Ptolemaic world-picture and were stronglyreinforced by Renaissance doctrines of macrocosmand microcosm. As Nicholas Culpepper put it:If you do but consider the whole universe as oneunited body, and man an epitome of this body, itwill seem strange to none but madmen and foolsthat the stars should have inɻuence upon the bodyof man, considering he, be[ing] an epitome of theCreation, must needs have a celestial world withinhimself... Every inferior world is governed by itssuperior, and receives influence from it.54This type of thinking was to be madeunfashionable by the new science, but it remainedrespectable in all but the most rarified milieux untilat least the middle of the seventeenth century.55But at a popular level the appeal of astrologywas not just a reɻection of prevailing scientiɹctheories. It was rooted in the condition of sociallife. Ordinary people were much more aware ofthe heavenly bodies than they are today. It isartiɹcial lighting, in street and house, which hasmade us less conscious of their endless mutations.Few dwellers in large cities now know what the"},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"current phase of the moon may be, and an eclipsewill pass unnoticed by all save professionalastronomers. But in the pre-industrial world mencarried torches to light their way and arrangedtheir journeys to coincide with a full moon. InElizabethan England the working day was longerin the summer than the winter because there wasmore daylight. The artiɹcial hour - a twelfth of thedaylight period – still survived in popular usage.56Contemporaries still used the sun to tell the time;indeed the seventeenth century was the great ageof sundialling.So long as men were intimately acquainted withthe movement of the heavenly bodies it is not verysurprising that there should have been someattempt to relate their changes to those ofterrestrial phenomena. In Sir Walter Raleigh'swords:If we cannot deny but that God hath givenvirtue to springs and fountains, to cold earth, toplants and stones, minerals and to the excrementalparts of the basest living creatures, why should werob the beautiful stars of their working powers?For, seeing they are many in number and ofeminent beauty and magnitude, we may not think"},{"pageNumber":678,"pageContent":"that in the treasury of his wisdom who is inɹnitethere can be wanting, even for every star, apeculiar virtue and operation; as every herb,plant, fruit, ɻower, adorning the face of the earthhath the like.57There was much plausibility in this view. It wasknown that the movement of the heavensproduced the recurrence of day and night, and thecourse of the seasons. The moon controlled thetides. Flowers opened to reɻect the appearance ofthe sun. Since prevailing medical theory taughtthat all diseases were caused by a superabundanceor a deɹciency of heat, cold, dryness or moisture,and since any ɻuctuation in these qualities couldbe plausibly regarded as the result of the weather,it was not too much to believe that diseases weredetermined by the stars. (The inɻuence of the skyupon the human body seemed all the greater,remarked Goad, ‘when our age hath been taughtthat our blood circulates in our body every twenty-four hours’.58) The extensive lore about the impactof the moon upon vegetation and the weatherlingered on in the nineteenth-century countryside,unaʃected by two centuries of science. Francis"},{"pageNumber":679,"pageContent":"Kilvert recorded in his diary for 1878 how hevisited an old lady in his parish who was very ill.‘“’Tis the dog star,” she said. “I shall not be bettertill Saturday when the dog days end. ‘Tis an evilstar.”’ She was echoing a doctrine which went backvia the popular literature of the seventeenthcentury to the writings of Hippocrates.59 It wasnot unlike the ancient belief that dying men wentout with the tide; the state of the tide at the deathof a parishioner is actually recorded in oneElizabethan parish register.60 Such notions werenot so much survivals of intellectual doctrinesabout sympathy and correspondence as the directproduct of life in a primitive world where humandependence on tides and the weather wasfundamental, and where it seemed natural topostulate a sympathetic relationship between manand his environment.Even in the eighteenth century most sections ofthe English economy were dependent upon theweather.61 It was this which gave astrologicalpredictions their plausibility. To predict theweather was to predict the harvest; and to predictthe harvest was to predict the discontent whichwould follow a food shortage, and the rebellion"},{"pageNumber":680,"pageContent":"which might follow the discontent. It was preciselyalong these lines that the Danish astronomer,Tycho Brahe, constructed his defence ofastrlogy.62 It was equally plausible for anastrologer to prognosticate disease and mortalitysince it was generally accepted that the people'shealth was aʃected by the state of the air and thatthe air was inɻuenced by the heavens. So long ascomets were believed to be sublunar exhalations ofa hot, dry character, it was not absurd to predictthat they might scorch up the earth and bringfamine, just as by drying men's blood they couldproduce choler and hence quarrels and warfare.63Even today we are ready to attribute animprovement in our health and disposition to ‘achange of air’.In brief, in a society which was dependent uponthe weather for its eɽcient functioning, and hadfewer means of guarding itself against thedepredations of storm or drought, it was notpossible for a weather forecast to remain simply aweather forecast. Inexorably, it carried with it achain of far-reaching consequences of a social andpolitical character. The prognostications which theastrologers issued annually in their almanacs were"},{"pageNumber":681,"pageContent":"therefore highly plausible. As even Calvinconceded, the most insidious feature of astrologywas that it started out from a series of undeniabletruths.64But mere plausibility was hardly suɽcient tosustain the system against the repeated failures inprediction to which it was inevitably doomed. Howwas astrology able to retain the allegiance ofintelligent men, when it was utterly incapable ofproviding the accurate prognostications theywanted? During the seventeen years for which wehave a continuous record, John Booker'sastrological practice showed no signs ofslackening. On the contrary, the same clientsreturned again and again, and brought theirfriends as well. How was he able to keep theircustom? And why was the demand for thealmanacs and prognostications not slackened bytheir massive and repeated errors?When approaching this problem one must bearin mind that the astrologers, or at least thereputable ones, did not claim for their predictionsa binding and inexorable character. All they saidwas that they were very likely to be fulɹlled. FromPtolemy to Partridge, it was a platitude of"},{"pageNumber":682,"pageContent":"astrological writing to assert that the starsinclined, but did not compel. The portrait whichLilly made the frontispiece to his annual almanacshowed the astrologer bearing a book on whichwas inscribed the signiɹcant motto – non cogunt. Itwas always possible for a man to overcome thetendencies indicated in his horoscope by exercisingfree-will and self-determination. In this way twomen born under the same star might well have adiʃerent destiny. Astrologers, a practitionerasserted, did not make deɹnite predictions, butonly ‘a probable conjecture by natural causes [of]what may possibly happen if the inɻuence of thosecelestial bodies be not restrained’.65 Once thisessential limitation was recognised, it became easyenough to explain why astrological predictions didnot always turn out to be correct. The astrologeronly claimed to identify tendencies in his client'sdisposition; he could not tell whether or not hewould succumb to them. He could also remind hisclient that the horoscope of an individual might beout-trumped by that of the country in which helived. For did not Ptolemy rule that the fate of akingdom overruled that of individual men? Therewas thus a conɻict between the precise forecastthe client wanted and the conditional answer"},{"pageNumber":683,"pageContent":"which the astrologer preferred to give.66It therefore became customary forprognostications to be phased ambiguously, andshrouded with ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’. This meant that,whatever happened, it was hard to say that thealmanac-maker had been wrong. Thus onealmanac in 1607 hinted that an eclipse mightoccasion ‘much private enmity, malice and secretgrudges, death of great beasts, manyimprisonments, and the death of someecclesiastical persons’. Another in 1614 forecast‘loss and hindrance of divers husbandmen in theirbeasts and cattle’.67 The trick was promptlyspotted by the satirists. Poor Robin, a mockalmanac which enjoyed almost as muchcommercial success as the real thing, predicted forFebruary 1664 that, ‘We may expect some showersor rain either this month or the next, or the nextafter that, or else we shall have a very dryspring’.68 Jonathan Swift delivered an even morecrushing indictment:For their observations and predictions, they aresuch as will equally suit any age or country in theworld. ‘This month a certain great person will be"},{"pageNumber":684,"pageContent":"threatened with death or sickness’. This thenewspapers will tell them; for there we ɹnd at theend of the year, that no month passes without thedeath of some person of note; and it would be hardif it should be otherwise, when there are at leasttwo thousand persons of note in this kingdom,many of them old, and the almanac-maker has theliberty of choosing the sickliest season of the year,where he may fix his prediction. Again, ‘this monthan eminent clergyman will be preferred’; of whichthere may be many hundreds, half of them withone foot in the grave. Then, ‘such a planet in suchhouse shows great machinations, plots,conspiracies that may in time be brought to light’,after which, if we hear of any discovery, theastrologer gets the honour; if not, his predictionsstill stand good. And at last, ‘God preserve KingWilliam from all his open and secret enemies.Amen.’ When, if the king should happen to havedied, the astrologer plainly foretold it; otherwise itpasses but for the pious ejaculation of a loyalsubject.69The extent of the exaggeration here isremarkably slight. Ambiguity was an essentialfeature of these prognostications, which were"},{"pageNumber":685,"pageContent":"usually contrived ‘so cunningly and equivocatinglythat, be the event what it will, still the words shallbe capable of intimating it.’70 Moreover, asReginald Scot pointed out, one truth gave credit toall their lies; so ‘that ever after we believewhatsoever they say’.71 Even more irritatingly,the astrologer could fall back on the excuse ofdivine intervention. Judicial astrology, held Lilly,was conɹned to the analysis of natural causes; itdid not pretend to be able to explain God'smiracles. There were, for example, no astrologicalcauses for Noah's Flood, which had been theAlmighty's sole handiwork.72 The confused eventsof the Interregnum forced Lilly to have repeatedrecourse to the concept of the unpredictablemiracle in order to vindicate erroneousprognostications. In 1652 he explained that themanner of Charles I's death was something whichno astrologer could have been expected to foresee;in this case ‘Providence rather acted by Miraclethan Nature’. For 1659 he forecast that in May theProtector Richard Cromwell would ‘manifesthimself unto the whole world that he hath abilitiesto govern’. When May turned out to be the monthof the Protector's abdication, the astrologer assured"},{"pageNumber":686,"pageContent":"his readers that such political ɻuctuations couldnever have been found out by astrology for theywere obviously a direct manifestation of the handof God. He also hinted that even if he had foreseenthem it would have been impolitic to have said so.The Restoration forced Lilly back yet again on tothe notion of divine intervention. How could hehave been expected to predict such a miracle?These were acts above nature, impenetrable byany human inquirer.73All this may strike us as the crudest subterfuge,but there is no reason to believe that Lilly was notsincere or that his readers rejected his explanation.George Wharton also attributed the defeat of theRoyalists in the Civil War to a supernatural causewhich could not be discerned in advance.74Vincent Wing concluded his prognostication for1647 with the pious reminder that ‘the Almighty[might] dispose otherwise and so frustrate theportents of Heaven’.75 Samuel Tucker assumedthat the ‘starry inɻuences operated inevitably...unless the Almighty suspend nature and workimmediately of himself, and that I suppose haththe term of a miracle’.76"},{"pageNumber":687,"pageContent":"Equally persuasive were the quiet hints ofcensorship. There undoubtedly were occasionswhen almanacs had been so censored,77 and thereader could never tell whether the licenser hadnot intervened to prevent the astrologer fromtelling the real truth. This remained a plausibleexcuse for astrologers until the end of governmentcensorship in 1695. Timothy Gadbury, whoseprediction of Charles II's return appeared only afortnight before the event itself, explained that hehad, of course, known about it long before, buthad refrained from making the news public,because of the censorship, and also because he hadno wish to prejudice the King's chances byforewarning his enemies.78 As always, repression,unaccompanied by intellectual refutation, didmore to foster belief than to end it. A curious pieceof contemporary testimony to the myth of thealmanac-makers’ infallibility is to be found in thenotebook of John Ward, vicar of Stratford-upon-Avon, who solemnly records the report that mostof the astrologers had predicted the Great Fire ofLondon in 1666, but that this part of their forecasthad been struck out by the licenser, Sir RogerL'Estrange.79"},{"pageNumber":688,"pageContent":"In the last resort the astrologer would concedethat a mistake had occurred in the calculations.Blagrave reminded his readers that things might gowrong if his clock was slow, or if the messengerbearing the inquiry was delayed en route.80 Aclient might also wreck the calculation by failingto supply all the relevant facts. There was in anycase plenty of room for argument about the properprocedure to be followed. As one contemporaryobserved, ‘there are no less than six ways oferecting a scheme, in each of which the predictionof events shall be different’.81An individual astrologer who had got the wrongresult might therefore go back over his calculationsto see where he had gone wrong. The mostcelebrated example of such wisdom after the eventwas provided by the Italian astrologer, JeromeCardan, who came to England in the mid sixteenthcentury and predicted that the boy-king Edward VIwould live to be at least ɹfty-ɹve. Unabashed bythe death of his client shortly afterwards, Cardanpublished the horoscope, together with anapologia entitled ‘What I thought afterwards onthe subject’.

No human science was perfect, theyreminded themselves, and astrology was certainlyno worse than medicine. If diʃerent astrologersproduced diʃerent results, then so did diʃerenttheologians and lawyers.83 Everyone knew thatsome practitioners were better than others andthat the profession was infested by charlatans andquacks. The number of good astrologers was veryfew, and even the best astrologers mademistakes.84 The paradox was that the mistakes ofany one astrologer only served to buttress thestatus of the system as a whole, since the client'sreaction was to turn to another practitioner to getbetter advice, while the astrologer himself wentback over his calculations to see where he hadslipped up. The notorious internal disputes amongthe astrological fraternity, the bitter quarrelsbetween Lilly and Wharton, Gadbury and"},{"pageNumber":690,"pageContent":"Partridge, did not discredit astrology as such, anymore than did religious controversy make menatheists. They merely stimulated the public desireto know which side was right. By concentrating oneach other's particular errors the astrologers thusdiverted attention from their art as a whole.But to understand fully why it was that thepublic did not tire sooner of the astrologers andtheir pronouncements it must be remembered thatmany of their rulings were not predictions at all. Alarge part of the astrological practitioner's businessconsisted in giving advice and in helping men toresolve personal problems and to take their owndecisions. This was not an activity which it waseasy to discredit. If the astrologer chose anunpropitious day for some action he could hardlybe rebuked, for there was no telling whether someother day might not have proved even worse. Infact his advice was probably often based on soundcommon sense and a real acquaintance with thefacts at issue.

Hisɹnal verdict is strongly inɻuenced by the situationas it emerges during the interview. Conversely, theclient who does not receive the answer he wantswill try another practitioner in the hope of gettingit.

For although the records of tens ofthousands of astrological consultations are extant– a ɹgure which must surely dwarf thecorresponding total of divining séances which havebeen observed by anthropologists – the essentialinformation is usually missing. The case-booksseldom reveal what the astrologer told his clientand they contain no record of the conversationwhich accompanied the construction of thehoroscope. This makes it impossible to provide thesort of analysis open to the anthropologist whohas been an eye-witness to the séance itself.There is, however, some prima facie evidence to"},{"pageNumber":692,"pageContent":"suggest that much astrological consultation was aless ‘loaded’ process than that of the Africandiviner. For much of the astrologers' business wasdone by post and many of the letters they receivedwere from complete strangers. They includedstraight requests for information about stolengoods or sickness, which gave no clue whatsoeverto the desired answer, or even any intimation thatone answer was desired more than another. Indeedclients were sometimes extremely anxious tosecure perfect laboratory conditions for thequestion and to avoid predisposing the astrologereither way.86 Besides, astrology was supposed tobe a science. There were strict rules to be followedwhen giving a judgement. The result was notmeant to be faked, so as to fit in with some clue letslip by the client during the course of theinterview. Indeed under certain circumstances itwas the astrologer's duty to rule that the partysuspected by the client was in fact innocent.87Yet, for all its apparent objectivity, astrologyleft everything in the last resort to the judgementand common sense of the practitioner, and thesystem, far from being exact, was highlyflexible.88 As with many kinds of African"},{"pageNumber":693,"pageContent":"divination, there were rules to be followed, buttheir interpretation was ultimately subjective. ‘Themost striking feature of Nupe sand-divining’,writes one anthropologist, ‘is the contrast betweenits pretentious theoretical framework and itsprimitive and slipshod application in practice.’89The same must have been true of much Englishastrological consultation. The rules themselvesallowed weight to be given to the client'ssuspicions. Lilly, for example, taught thatwitchcraft should never be diagnosed unless it wasalready suspected.90 Like African diviners, theastrologers seldom named names, but simplyissued physical descriptions – ‘A female servantwith a wart under her ear and another on herbody’.91 This practice made it easier for the clientto fasten his suspicions where he chose. When Mrs.Jane Shelley asked the Elizabethan astrologer-don,John Fletcher of Caius College, Cambridge, todiscover what had become of her jointure she gotthe Delphic answer that ‘knaves be knaves’.92The less scrupulous practitioners were readyenough to provide the judgements their customerswanted. Lilly professed to be shocked when histutor in astrology, the ex-clergyman, Evans, gave a"},{"pageNumber":694,"pageContent":"client a prognostication which was the reverse ofwhat the horoscope indicated; his master admittedthe deception, but pleaded that ‘had he not sojudged to please the woman, she would have givenhim nothing; and he had a wife and family toprovide for’. An astrologer, thought Lilly, shouldnever give a judgement against his rules, howevermuch he was paid. But Booker later told Pepys thatLilly was equally pliable.93 ‘Tell him whom yoususpect, and he'll guess shrewdly’, says a characterin a Jacobean play of a false astrologer.94 The‘Quack Astrologer’ described in one contemporarypamphlet always prefaced his calculation in casesof theft by asking his client whether there wereany suspicious characters who frequented thehouse. After that the erection of a ɹgure was apure formality.95The astrologer could also rely upon a certainproportion of his predictions to fulɹl themselvessimply because they had been predicted. As acontemporary put it, ‘if one were to ɹght a duel,the astrologer tells him he shall have the victory;and hereupon the consulter hath his courageheightened, and so prevails’.96 ‘Doth not all thevirtue of their art’, asked another, ‘consist more in"},{"pageNumber":695,"pageContent":"the inferior's conɹdence than in the superior'sinfluence?’97 It was notorious that to predict afamine was to make its arrival more probable.‘What a dearth of victuals you cause in thecommonwealth,’ said William Fulke to theastrologers in 1560, ‘while the farmers of thecountry... believing your oracles of theintemperance of weathers do so craftily disposetheir wares that in abundance of all things thecommon people suʃer a great and grievousscarcity’.98 The same point was repeated by theEarl of Northampton: ‘Pamphlets whichprognosticated famine have been causes of thesame; not by the malice of the planets,... but bythe greediness of husbandmen, who, being put infear of such a storm,... by forestalment, and... bythe secret hoarding up of grain, enhance the pricesin respect of scarcity’.99 It was common toattribute dearth to hoarding; and there must havebeen many corn-engrossers who, as the preacherThomas Adams said, made the almanac their Bible.The ‘farmer who hang'd himself on expectation ofplenty’, mentioned by the porter in Macbeth, hadpresumably been studying the latestprognostication.

At theaccession of Elizabeth I they seemed to threatenthe very establishment of the Anglican Church.One contemporary records that the people didso waver, the whole realm was so troubled and somoved with blind enigmatical and devilishprophecies of that heaven-gazer Nostradamus...that even those which in their hearts could havewished the glory of God and his Word mostɻourishing to be established were brought intosuch an extreme coldness of faith that theydoubted God had forgotten his promise.102Nostradamus was the French astrologer andprophet, a protégé of Catherine de Medici, whosesemi-astrological prognostication for 1559 had"},{"pageNumber":697,"pageContent":"been translated into English, with its gloomypredictions of ‘divers calamities, weepings andmournings’ and ‘civil sedition and mutination ofthe lowest against the highest’. Archbishop Parkerdismissed these maunderings as a ‘fantasticalhotch-potch’, and the government took legal actionagainst the booksellers who sold them.103 Buttheir inɻuence was indisputable. Fulke recalledthatnone almost of them that gave any credit toprognostications durst be bold to open their faithand religion... Without the good luck of hisprophecies it was thought that nothing could bebrought to eʃect... Except the true preachers ofGod's Word had sharply rebuked the people forcrediting such vain prophecies, there should havebeen none end of fear and expectation.104It was during the Civil War, however, that thepolitical potentialities of astrological forecastswere most systematically exploited.

In popular estimationthis was not far removed from malevolentconjuration to take away the ruler's life. Severalɹfteenth-century astrologers were executed for thistype of oʃence.116 Some of the conspiraciesagainst Henry VII drew on astrological advice,117and all the Tudor monarchs were made the subjectof astrological calculation by dissident groups.118In 1581 Parliament made it a statutory felony toerect ɹgures, cast nativities, or calculate byprophecy how long the Queen would live or whowould succeed her.119 Elizabethan recusants andGunpowder plotters were both fortiɹed by suchcalculations.120 Robert Cecil had a Scottishastrologer banished for predicting the death of"},{"pageNumber":701,"pageContent":"Prince Henry, and there were rumours that similarcalculations had been made concerning JamesI.121 One of the charges brought against the Dukeof Buckingham in 1667 was that he had engagedJohn Heydon to calculate Charles II'shoroscope;122 Heydon was earlier said to havebeen imprisoned under the Protectorate forpredicting Cromwell's death.123 During the PopishPlot period John Gadbury confessed that MrsCellier, ‘the Popish Midwife’, had asked him to castthe King's nativity, although the astrologer claimedto have refused to do so.124In such circumstances governments displayedkeen interest in the activities of contemporaryastrologers, and did not hesitate to censor theirtexts, prohibit their publications, and call them toaccount for their activities. Tudor printers,booksellers and almanac-makers were frequentlyin trouble when their forecasts were thought toh a v e over-stepped the mark.125 It wascommonplace for the astrological writers of theInterregnum to contrast their new freedom withthe strict control to which they had been subjectedunder the Laudian licensers.

It would beinteresting to know how many village Dogberriesthere were like Thomas Law, the constable ofQuendon, Essex, whose reaction in 1651 on beinginformed of a robbery was to call on theastrologer, William Hills, ‘with an intent to hearwhat he might say, that so he might make hissearch accordingly’.131 Like the thief-magic of thecunning men, astrology could be a usefuldeterrent. Readers of Stendhal will recall that theItalian priest, Father Blanès, practised astrology inorder to keep the peasants from stealing.132But questions relating to theft were anotoriously tricky branch of the astrologer's art. AsJohn Pool concluded after twenty years' practicalexperience in Gloucestershire:It's a most diɽcult and laborious task... forthough we describe the party or thief never soexactly, yet if the goods be not presently retakenwith the thief, or if the party so accused ordescribed by us do complain to an ignorant Justice"},{"pageNumber":704,"pageContent":"of the Peace... and pretend themselves injured,either the simplicity of the master or [the]covetousness of the Clerk, will causelessly bindover the artist to answer the fact at the nextSessions... which silly act of some Justices is noother than an encouragement unto thieves.133John Partridge told the same story: ‘In matters oftheft people are never satisɹed and they do expectmore from the art than that or the artist is able toperform; and... an unhappy judgement may bringhis person into scandal.’134 In a large city the taskwas especially diɽcult, because a physicaldescription of the thief might easily ɹt more thanone person. Small wonder that Henry Coleydespairingly asserted in 1676 that ‘no man everyet could force back stolen goods by the help ofastrology only’.135 There had been too manyembarrassing failures. Simon Forman recorded inhis diary for 1584 that ‘certain brawls and slandersfell out against me about the detecting of one thathad stolen certain things, whereby I was like tohave been spoiled’.

John Lambe caused manydivisions between husband and wife by diagnosinginɹdelity; and Lilly was accused of starting familyquarrels, by pronouncing ‘elder brothers childlessand younger brothers certain heirs of theirestates’.138 We have seen enough of the questionsbrought to the practitioners to appreciate that itwas with the client himself that these suspicionsusually originated, the astrologer being merelyinvited to adjudicate upon them. But it wasdiɽcult to handle such matters without gettingpersonally involved.

DeclineIf astrology was discharging so many usefulfunctions, why did it nevertheless rapidly declinein status towards the end of the seventeenthcentury? There are only two possible ways ofanswering this question. One is to say that theproblems which astrologers claimed to solvebecame less acute. This possibility will be discussedin the conclusion to this book. The other is to saythat the solutions which they oʃered came toappear less convincing. This is the moreconventional answer and it needs little in the wayof explanation. The intellectual pretensions ofastrological theory were irreparably shattered bythe astronomical revolution initiated byCopernicus and consummated by Newton. Theassumption that the heavens were immutable wasupset by the appearance of previouly unobservednebulae, like the ‘new stars’ of 1572 and 1604; ifthe sky was changing, how could its inɻuence bepredicted? Galileo's discovery of the four satellitesof Jupiter made men aware that the heavens werefull of unseen stars whose inɻuence was"},{"pageNumber":711,"pageContent":"unaccountable. The telescope, by uncovering newcelestial bodies, conɹrmed the hypothesis of aplurality of worlds. The cosy, man-centreduniverse of Ptolemy was no more. Yet none ofthese changes – not even the revelation that theheavens were infinite – made astrology impossible,though they did make astrological calculationmuch more diɽcult. Heliocentrism was consistentwith astrology. If the earth was constantlychanging its position then certain calculationswould have to be made all over again, but the taskwas not impossible. ‘Whether (as Copernicus saith)the sun be the centre of the world,’ declared SirChristopher Heydon in 1603, ‘the astrologer carethnot.’153What really destroyed the possibility of scientiɹcastrology was the undermining of the Aristoteliandistinction between terrestrial and celestial bodies,what Bacon called ‘the imaginary divorce betweensuperlunary and sublunary things’.154 On the onehand the earth was revealed as a planet of thesame quality as any other and subject to the samelaws of motion; on the other, the heavens wererobbed of their former perfection. Galileo observedspots on the sun and an irregular surface on the"},{"pageNumber":712,"pageContent":"moon. Tycho Brahe demonstrated that cometswere above the moon, not below, and that theheavens were therefore subject to corruption andchange. Moreover, once comets were seen to be sofar away it became implausible to argue that theywere capable of scorching the earth and producingdroughts. By the beginning of the eighteenthcentury Edmond Halley had computed the orbits oftwenty-four comets, proved that the comets of1531, 1607 and 1682 were all the same one, andcorrectly predicted its next appearance in 1758. Itbecame harder to regard a comet in the sky as aheaven-sent warning of a particular disaster.155The old dichotomy between things sublunar andthings celestial, which had been the veryfoundation of astrological theory, thus becameincreasingly untenable. Once abandoned, itbecame impossible to deɹne the nature of thatone-way astrological inɻuence which the stars hadbeen supposed to exert upon the earth. Given time,astrology could have adapted itself to any numberof new discoveries about the landscape of theuniverse, for these merely meant that thecalculation of the manner in which the celestialbodies exerted their inɻuence became more"},{"pageNumber":713,"pageContent":"complicated. But the removal of the very idea ofsuch an inɻuence made the task impossible. Theworld could no longer be envisaged as a compactinterlocking organism; it was now a mechanism ofinɹnite dimensions, from which the oldhierarchical subordination of earth to heavens hadirretrievably disappeared.156But the new ideas were slow to permeatedownwards. Indeed the astronomers themselveswere slow to recognize their implications. For atime they clung to their faith in astrology, even astheir own discoveries were undermining it. Theystruggled unsuccessfully to deɹne the nature of theastrological force which emanated from the starsbecause they were reluctant to give up theemotional satisfaction provided by a coherent andinterrelated universe. Usually they compromisedby allowing general predictions but rejectingspeciɹc ones. Both Galileo and Kepler hesitated toface up to the full import of their discoveries and ittook Gassendi and Bayle to deliver the coup degrâce to astrological claims.

Astrology's achievements so farmight be small, he admitted, but ‘that there is sucha science... there is no question to be made’.165Jeremy Shakerley, the second man to observe thetransit of Mercury, was well aware that mostcontemporary astrologers, ‘being ignorant of theastronomical part of their art, [were] not betrusted’, yet he resolved not to abandon thesubject, but ‘from philosophical principles [to] seeka foundation for a more reɹned astrology’.166Despite the new knowledge about comets, a welterof tracts on their prophetic signiɹcance waspublished in the 1680s. Most of the almanac-makers had gone over to Copernicanism by thistime,167 but it made no diʃerence to theirprognosticatory activities."},{"pageNumber":716,"pageContent":"This last phase, in which an attempt was madeto reconcile astrology with the new science, was ofonly brief duration. Serious astronomers hadceased to make any contributions to astrology,even if they were reluctant to abandon it. For SethWard astrology was a ‘ridiculous cheat’.

The zodiac and twelve houses had noreality.

In Tudor times many dons had beenkeenly interested in astrology and some, like theirmedieval predecessor, Chaucer's clerk Nicholas,turned an honest penny by setting ɹgures forclients. As late as the 1650s Lilly claimed to havemany admirers in both Universities, while theQuaker Henry Clark denounced Oxford andCambridge for turning out so many astrologers tocheat the people.171 But from the reign ofElizabeth there is evidence of scepticism. Theyoung Fellow of St. John‘s, Edmund Campion,could greet the Queen on her arrival at Oxford in1566 with a disputation on the theme that theinferior bodies were ruled by higher ones,172 butmost of the theses subsequently maintained byM.A.s at their inception reveal an increasinghostility to the pretensions of astrology.173 JohnChamber lectured against it at Oxford in the"},{"pageNumber":719,"pageContent":"1570s, while Robert Greene thought in 1585 thatthe learned laughed at its practitioners ascharlatans.174 In the early years of theCommonwealth Seth Ward maintained the thesisthat prognosticatory astrology was both inanis andillicita.

But duringthe ensuing hundred years astrological medicinewas quietly discarded, although the evidence formedical practice is as yet too slight for thehistorian to chart the change with muchconɹdence. A writer claimed in 1617 that learnedphysicians had abandoned astrology; and whenBurton published his Anatomy of Melancholy fouryears later the place of astrology in medicine wasundoubtedly controversial. Writing in 1633, thephysician James Hart rejected it altogether.180The Royal College of Phy had for some time beencensuring astrological doctors and prohibiting thepractice of making diagnoses on the basis of thepatient's urine alone. Yet Richard Forster, anastrological almanac-maker, was elected theCollege's President in 1601–4 and again in 1615–16, and there were astrological touches in theCollege's oɽcial Pharmacopoeia.

Even in the"},{"pageNumber":721,"pageContent":"reign of Elizabeth it was said that not one in ahundred physicians knew the proper rules.182 Butthe old belief in the inɻuence of the moon uponthe human body continued to be accepted by manyof those who, like Francis Bacon and Henry More,rejected most other parts of astrological theory.Both Nehemiah Grew and Robert Boyle believedthat the moon aʃected the brain.183 RichardMead, the leading physician in early eighteenth-century London, and Vice-President of the RoyalSociety in 1717, wrote A Treatise concerning theInɻuence of the Sun and Moon upon Human Bodies,to preserve this element of truth which he thoughtunderlay the hotch-potch of judicial astrology.Mead argued that the sun and moon producedchanges in atmospheric pressure which determinedthe amount of nervous ɻuid in the human body.The incidence of epilepsy, vertigo, hysteria andasthma, as well as of menstruation andchildbirth,184 was in his opinion to be attributedto the phases of the moon.

Even JohnLocke believed in the astrological choice of timesfor picking medicinal herbs.186Among the population at large the movement ofopinion on astrology is impossible to chart withany accuracy. The general impression left by theliterary evidence is that the current of scepticism,already well-established in the reign of Elizabeth,had swept most educated opinion along with it bythe end of the seventeenth century. Throughout theperiod the astrologers themselves never ceased tolament the opposition they had to endure. Mostpeople despised ‘astronomers’, said the almanac-maker, John Securis, in 1568. They saw astrologyas an entertaining recreation rather than agenuine science, agreed John Fage in 1606.187Despite his thriving practice, Lilly complained of‘the small conceit and opprobrious judgement theEnglish nation have of astrology’. ‘The citizens ofLondon make small reckoning of astrology’, hegrumbled.188 Like others, he had suʃered from thesceptics who penetrated into his consulting-room,"},{"pageNumber":723,"pageContent":"bringing misleading samples of horses' urine, andready to try any deception which would expose theunwary astrologer.189After the Restoration it became obvious thatchanges in intellectual fashion were leaving theastrologers behind.

In Hudibras Samuel Butlerhad mocked Lilly and Booker under the sobriquetsof Sidrophel and Whackham, and he continued theattack in his other writings.

ConflictTHE relations between astrology and religion hadbeen coloured by mutual suspicion since the earlyChristian era. During the century after theReformation the two systems of belief came intosharp conɻict. Many of the English clergydenounced judicial astrology as an impious artwhose teachings were fundamentally incompatiblewith some of the basic tenets of Christianity. Mostof the arguments they employed in their sermonsand pamphlets were derived from earlierEuropean writers, but they deployed them with"},{"pageNumber":727,"pageContent":"unmistakable vehemence.The ɹrst line of attack was to point out thatreligion and astrology frequently oʃeredconɻicting explanations for the same phenomena.Whereas the Christian was taught to regardstorms, famines or earthquakes as themanifestations of God's secret purposes, theastrologer made them subject to the movement ofthe celestial bodies and therefore predictable byhis art. This attribution of good or bad luck to thestars was a direct threat to Christian dogma: asCalvin said, it ‘put... clouds before our eyes todrive us away from the providence of God’. BishopHooper similarly warned his hearers that ‘it isneither Sun, neither Moon, Jupiter nor Mars, thatis the occasion of wealth or woe, plenty orscarcity, of war or peace’: it was God himself.Long life was the reward for godliness, not thelegacy of the planets.1 Much of the war againstastrology was fought at this basic level ofcausation. As the Presbyterian Thomas Gatakerdeclared in 1653, it was essential that Christiansshould regard all events, ‘not with an astrological,but a theological eye’.2The astrologers caused the deepest oʃence by"},{"pageNumber":728,"pageContent":"offering a secular explanation for some of the mostdelicate matters in religious history. They did nothesitate to proʃer astral reasons for thedominance of diʃerent religions in diʃerent partsof the world; some practitioners even continuedthe notorious medieval attempts to cast thenativity of Christ himself.3 It was a horriɹedreaction against blasphemy of this kind which ledso many clerics to cast their polemic againstastrology in what must seem to us fundamentallyantiscientiɹc language. Foreknowledge, whetherof religious history or of human behaviour ingeneral, was a perquisite of God alone, and it waspresumptuous to usurp such a prerogative. ‘If aman shall undertake by the stars to foretell futureevents, which are accidental, dependent on thewills of and actions of men,’ declared theIndependent divine, William Bridge, ‘he dothplainly step into the chair of God.’4 ‘God,’ saidJohn Gaule, ‘hath resumed the foreknowledge andforeshewing of things future to himself; and hathdischarged... man from all such curiosities andpresumptions; and hath expressly forbidden us...both the consulting with and assenting to them.’5This prohibition was doubtless meant less literally"},{"pageNumber":729,"pageContent":"than it sounds, for its author had no objection tonatural science as such, and did not deny theusefulness of astronomy for navigation, medicineand agriculture. But his distaste for judicialastrology drove him to enunciate principles whichwould have constituted an eʃective block againstmany forms of scientiɹc endeavour. ‘Heaven isGod's book, which we must leave to him,’ saidanother cleric; ‘To what end has God placed us sofar from the stars, if with astrolabes, staves andquadrants we can do all things as if we werenearer?’6 This was as antiscientiɹc as theassociated argument that astrology should becondemned because it made men forget the role ofGod in human aʃairs. ‘While we are detained inthe view of natural causes,’ wrote John Geree, ‘weshall not look to supernatural ends or uses, or notso much as we should, and otherways would.’7Science could only be tolerated so long as it wasnever allowed to get out of hand. ‘We must makephilosophy wait and submit to divinity,’ saidThomas Hall. ‘Every science must keep its properbounds.’8 The attack upon judicial astrology thusposed the basic issue of whether human curiosityshould be allowed to play freely upon the works of"},{"pageNumber":730,"pageContent":"creation.But if this had been all there was to the conɻictbetween the two systems of belief, it could havebeen fairly easily resolved. Religion was to proveitself adaptable in the face of the scientiɹcrevolution, and there was no diɽculty aboutformulating theological arguments to justify andeven to stimulate the study of natural science. Thestars and the planets had been set in the heavensby God himself, it was urged. Their workings wereto be observed as an exempliɹcation of his majestyand power. They could never be more thansecondary causes of earthly events, but there wasno reason why God should not achieve hispurposes by working through them if he pleased.Knowledge of their operation could only redoundto his greater glory. These were the lines alongwhich most later seventeenth-century theologiansjustiɹed the study of natural science; and if therehad been no other objections to astrology it toomight have become as compatible with piety asany other form of natural knowledge.

But against this"},{"pageNumber":731,"pageContent":"could be set the reminder in Genesis, i, 14, thatGod had placed the stars in the ɹrmament as signsto men; even better, there was the example of thestar in the East leading the Magi to Bethlehem.The resources of the Authorised Version and theingenuity of its commentators made the task ofassimilating the new science a simple one.It was not therefore because astrology claimedto be a natural science that it incurred so muchtheological opposition. Nor was it because of itsintellectual weaknesses. In their campaign thetheologians naturally drew upon the armoury ofdebating points against astrology accumulated byearlier writers, from Cicero to Pico dellaMirandola. But intellectual objections to thesubject did not lie at the root of their hostility.Neither did the fact that astrology had begun as aheathen form of learning, in texts written byMuslims, pagans, and what Gataker called ‘theancient Egyptian wizards’.9 It is true that somesectaries condemned astrology along with thewritings of the pagan Aristotle,10 just as the moreextreme Protestants revived the early Christiancampaign to rebaptize the days and the monthswith names which were not derived from pagan"},{"pageNumber":732,"pageContent":"divinities.11 But such scrupulosity was only foundon the extreme fringe of Puritanism. Mostconventional brands of religion were able enoughto absorb Plato and Aristotle, along with classicalliterature, Arab science, and other forms of paganlearning.The real origin of the theological attack onastrology was the conviction that the astrologerstaught an astral determinism which wasincompatible with Christian doctrines of free willand moral autonomy. This was the point at whichthe spokesmen of the medieval Church had partedcompany with the astrologers. They had readilyconceded the claims of the natural part of thesubject - the inɻuence of the heavens uponclimate, vegetation and physiology – and hadrecognized astrology as an essential part ofagriculture or medicine. What they foundintolerable was the judicial side of the art – theexact prediction, not just of the weather, but ofhuman behaviour, whether of people in the massor as individuals.

The stars, they conceded, might inɻuencethe body, but they could not touch the soul. Theastrologer could never infallibly tell how anyparticular man would behave because the will andthe intellect remained free. A practitioner whoclaimed certainty for his predictions was no morethan a heretic. This fundamental objection to thevery possibility of prognostications pro certo hadbeen stated by St Augustine, and reformulated byAquinas.12 During the sixteenth and seventeenthcenturies it was constantly reaɽrmed. Thetheologians, in other words, saw greater danger inan exact social science than they did in a naturalone. Modern apologists have been able to showthat Protestant theology seldom hindered theprogress of natural science during this period. Butto the scientiɹc study of human behaviour itprovided much greater resistance, for it was thiswhich seemed to present the greater threat to faithand morality.Yet even here the conɻict was often moreapparent than real. For the astrologers, as wehave seen, were the ɹrst to admit that their"},{"pageNumber":734,"pageContent":"forecasts of human behaviour were onlyprovisional guesses.

But in practice"},{"pageNumber":735,"pageContent":"men were not always capable of appreciating suchsophisticated distinctions, and the clergy wereright to be worried about astrology's implications.The Church simply could not afford to concede thathuman autonomy might not exist, for to do sowould be to wreck the whole doctrine of rewardsand punishments on which its religion was based.Committed to the belief that the will wasnecessarily free, the clergy therefore reasoned thatit was impossible to predict future humanbehaviour. If the astrologers did so, it could onlymean that they were in league with the Devil.Charms and spells, said Bishop Carleton, were theDevil's rudiments, but judicial astrology was theDevil's university. Astrologers in tacit league withSatan deserved the fate prescribed for every otherkind of witch.14 They were also suspect because oftheir mathematical calculations. The memory ofRoger Bacon had been much besmirched by theassumption that mathematics was part of the blackart,15 and it was notorious that the Edwardianreformers had destroyed mathematical manuscriptsat Oxford under the delusion that they wereconjuring books. ‘Where a red letter or amathematical diagram appeared, they were"},{"pageNumber":736,"pageContent":"suɽcient to entitle the book to be Popish ordiabolical.’ (This may account for thedisappearance at this period of nearly all theworks of the fourteenth-century Merton Collegeschool of astronomers.) 16 Modern historians tendto think that few genuine Elizabethan scientistswere liable to be accused of witchcraft. Yet bothJohn Dee and Thomas Hariot suʃered from suchsuspicions and in the seventeenth century JohnAubrey recalled how the Elizabethan astrologer,Thomas Allen, was maligned by the belief, ‘inthose dark times’, that astrologer, mathematicianand conjurer were all the same thing.17 During thereign of Mary, a clergyman, William Living, wasarrested by an ignorant constable who foundamong his books a copy of the astronomicaltextbook, John de Sacrobosco's Sphere, exclaiming,‘It is no marvel the Queen be sick, seeing there besuch conjurers in privy corners; but now, I trust, heshall conjure no more.’18 The Elizabethansurveyor, Edward Worsop, also commented on thepopular assumption that books with crosses,ɹgures, circles and Greek geometrical terms werelikely to be works of conjuration.19Such prejudices lasted well into the seventeenth"},{"pageNumber":737,"pageContent":"century, and were fanned by the widespreadconviction that anything mysterious might have adiabolical origin. ‘A very lode-stone in somescholar's hand before a silly townsman's eye isenough to make the former a conjuror,’ wroteThomas Fuller.20 The sequestrators who seized thepapers of the mathematician Walter Warner in1644 were reported to be ‘much troubled at thesight of so many crosses and circles in thesuperstitious algebra and that black art ofgeometry’.21 ‘Let a man know more than acommon student,’ lamented the astrologer HenryHarɻete, ‘then he is accounted a conjurer; he dealswith the devil.’22 In 1651 John Rowley reportedsadly to Lilly that when he used his instruments tomeasure the height of the church steeple the localparson had accused him of conjuring.23 Acontemporary pamphlet referred to Lilly as the‘glory of the black art’, while his pupil andsuccessor, Henry Coley, was deeply oʃended byAnthony Wood's description of astrologers as‘conjurers’.24Although such aspersions often sprang fromsimple convictions honestly held, it is diɽcult to"},{"pageNumber":738,"pageContent":"resist the conclusion that one of the clergy'sobjections to astrologers was that they saw themas professional rivals. For, whatever thetheoretical compatibilities of astrology andreligion, there was little doubt that in practice theywere competing agencies, oʃering rival methodsof divination. The godly man might be able toprophesy by prayer and revelation, just as theastrologer made predictions after studying themovement of the heavenly bodies. But was thereroom for both? ‘If a man can foretell future thingsby the stars,’ asked William Bridge, ‘then whatneed of prophecy?’25 The conɻict was emphasizedby the readiness of astrologers like John Gadburyto mock sectarian claims to visions andrevelations, sneer at the delusions of the FifthMonarchy Men, and generally reject the claims ofany non-astrological type of prophecywhatsoever.26 They boasted of the scientiɹccharacter of their mathematically-based forecasts,as opposed to the inspirational and subjectivenature of religious revelations. ‘I look uponprophecies and predictions astrological to bediʃerent,’ declared Thomas Trigge. ‘The prophetspeaks by inspiration; the astrologer from a"},{"pageNumber":739,"pageContent":"known and physical ground, considering themundane eʃects as they lie embodied in theirproper causes.’27 Correspondingly, the Quakersthought Lilly's predictions worthless, because theysprang from the stars, not from the Light within.28Another delicate problem was the relationshipbetween astrology and prayer. The astrologers ofclassical antiquity had emphasized the futility ofseeking divine relief from the inɻuence of thestars; and in the sixteenth and seventeenthcenturies English Protestant writers were quick topoint out that prayer would be useless if suchdoctrines of astral destiny were accepted.29 Thedoctrine of astrological elections, moreover,seemed to imply that no prayer could be eʃectiveunless oʃered at an astrologically propitiousmoment. This Arab idea was said to have beentaught by some English astrologers.30 It had closeaɽliations with magical beliefs about the need totime operations to ɹt phases of the moon or sun.The Elizabethan conjurer, Thomas Allen, told aclient that if he waited for the sun to come to the‘quick of noon’, and then struck an anvil threetimes, he would have the answer to any question"},{"pageNumber":740,"pageContent":"he chose to ask.31 The Royalist visionary, AriseEvans, as a fourteen-year-old boy, heard ‘some saythat whatsoever one did ask of God uponWhitsunday morning, at the instant when the Sunarose and played, God would grant it him’.32But on the question of prayer, as of that of freewill, most astrologers tried to paper over thecracks, so as to prevent the gap between astrologyand religion from becoming too obvious. Theywere quick to echo the opinion of Archbishop Laudthat fervent prayer could overcome even the direeʃects of a conjunction of Saturn and Mars, sinceGod could hinder malign aspects and overruleconjunctions.33 Planetary inɻuences, a preachertold the Society of Astrologers, might always becountered by genuine religious belief. As a laterwriter put it, ‘Prayers and endeavours frustrate thestars.’34 In the same spirit, Cardinal Pole haddeclared that, whatever the astrologicalsigniɹcance of his nativity, it was cancelled out bythe grace of his second birth, or spiritualregeneration.35But the potential rivalry of the two systemscould not always be so easily concealed. For the"},{"pageNumber":741,"pageContent":"godly drew their keenest sense of pain from anawareness that men and women took to theastrologers the very problems which the clergythemselves might normally have expected toresolve. Although it also oʃered an abstract systemof explanation, astrology was ɹrst and foremost apractical agency, providing advice on a widerange of personal diɽculties. Its clients wantedhelp in dealing with their wives, servants, businesscolleagues; or they needed guidance on someperplexing issue of conduct or allegiance. Thatthey should turn to star-gazers in their hour ofneed, rather than to the traditional pastoralagencies of the Church, seemed a direct threat tothe moral supremacy of the clergy, whose privilegeit had always been to resolve disputes and to giveadvice. The man who regulated his life by thealmanac was thus showing a fundamental distrustof God.36 ‘Hearkening unto these diviners,’protested the Reverend Francis Crow, ‘is opposedto our hearkening unto Christ.’37 But thecomplaints poured in. Astrological prophecieswere ‘studied more than the Bible’. Many looked‘more to the fulɹlling of what such prognostics andalmanacs say than to the Scriptures’. Some gave"},{"pageNumber":742,"pageContent":"‘more credit to judiciary astrologers than to God'sword’, and ‘put more conɹdence in Lilly than theydid in God’.38At this point no compromise was possible. On anintellectual level astrological doctrine couldsomehow be ɹtted into a theological framework.But when the astrologers began to develop aconsulting agency which in scope andcomprehensiveness threatened to eclipse thepastoral role of the clergy, then drastic action hadto be taken. The great Puritan preacher, WilliamPerkins, declared that it was better that a manshould lose his goods irrecoverably rather thanretrieve them by astrological help.39 But thissevere view could not be expected to capture theenthusiasm of a materially-minded populace. Theonly remedy was repression, and this the churchcourts struggled to provide. As late as 1716 theBishop of Norwich was seeking to know whetherthere were any of his ɻock who ‘by sorcery,charms, or astrology, pretend to tell fortunes anddiscover lost goods, or any that consult with suchpersons’.40In this respect the post-Reformation Churchmaintained complete continuity with the attitude"},{"pageNumber":743,"pageContent":"taken by its medieval predecessor. The canon lawhad always prohibited the observance ofastrologically chosen times.41 When his clericalcontemporaries had recovered from the shock ofdiscovering a book on astrology under the pillowon which Archbishop Gerard of York had died in1108 they resolved that it was unɹt that his bodyshould be buried in the cathedral.42 From the laterMiddle Ages onwards a ɹgure-caster discoveredplying his trade among the people could expect tobe brought before a church court for correction. In1577 one of them, Simon Pembroke, caused asensation by dropping dead before the tribunalwhich was trying him.43 But astrologers seem tohave appeared before the ecclesiastical courts verymuch less frequently than did the cunning menand wise women; and it is doubtful whetherecclesiasical action constituted a very eʃectivecheck to their activities, especially after severalleading astrologers had been given episcopallicences authorizing them to practise medicine likeany orthodox practitioner.44 Ecclesiasticalcensorship apart, the preventive action taken bythe Anglican Church seems to have been largelyineʃective. Even the paper war against astrology"},{"pageNumber":744,"pageContent":"may have defeated its own purpose. As oneastrologer, Joseph Blagrave, confessed in 1671,‘The truth is, after the ministers had preachedagainst me and my art, I had twice so muchcustom as I had before, for they could not havedone me better service; for many which before hadnot heard of me made much inquiring after me,hearing what great cures I had done.’45Although clergymen of all brands weresuspicious of astrology, there can be no doubt thatin post-Reformation England the most sustainedopposition to it came from the Puritans, that isthose Protestants who were most anxious to purgethe Anglican Church of its remaining ‘Popish’elements. Following their Continental masters,Calvin, Beza, Bullinger and Peter Martyr, theEdwardian Protestants wrote strongly againstastrology, particularly Miles Coverdale, JohnHooper, John Foxe and Roger Hutchinson. Calvin'streatise on the subject was translated by thePuritan George Gylby in 1561. Thereafter theattack was continued by writers who wereCalvinist in theology and strongly anti-Roman intheir general outlook. They included John Jewel,the Marian exile; William Fulke, the Puritan"},{"pageNumber":745,"pageContent":"divine; Philip Stubbes, moralist and socialreformer; John Chamber, canon of Windsor, andadmirer of Ramus and Calvin; William Perkins, thegodly preacher, and George Carleton, the CalvinistBishop of Chichester. Other participants includedPuritan divines like Laurence Humphrey andThomas Cooper, and theologians like AndrewWillet and George Hakewill.46 Of those who wroteat length against astrology before the Civil Waronly a tiny minority did not have aɽliations withthis school of religious thought.47 In the 1640s,when the controversy over astrology mounted to acrescendo of preaching and pamphleteering, theopposition was dominated by Presbyterians, -Thomas Gataker, John Geree, Thomas Hall, JohnVicars – with the subsequent assistance of some ofthe Independent clergy (though not laymen), likeJohn Goodwin, John Owen, William Bridge andPhilip Nye. It was a group of the latter who inFebruary 1652 petitioned Parliament to suppressthe practice of judicial astrology altogether.48How is the marked antipathy of Puritanism forastrology to be accounted for? It would betempting to hail it as further proof of thefrequently postulated link between Puritanism and"},{"pageNumber":746,"pageContent":"the rise of modern science, by suggesting that‘rationally-minded’ Puritans were quicker to spotthe intellectual deɹciencies of astrological method.But this does not seem to have been the case. Thespuriousness of astrological procedures was notnormally the basis of the Puritans' objection.Indeed they often conceded that the astrologersmight be correct in their prognostications, butcited this very success as further evidence for thediabolical nature of their art. ‘Do astrologersforetell right sometimes?’ sneered John Geree, ‘Sodo witches’. Geree quoted the opinion of thePuritan mathematician, Henry Briggs, who hadabandoned the study of astrology, partly becausehe found no certainty in its rules, but also becausehe feared that ‘to those who addicted themselves tothe practice of divining astrology, the Devil did atɹrst secretly lend his assistance, and at lengthgradatim (unless God graciously prevented) enticethem into contract’.49 So the astrologers lost eitherway. If their predictions were wrong, this provedthey were charlatans; if they were right, then theywere in league with the Devil.50There was nothing new about this view, for ithad been inherited from the medieval schoolmen."},{"pageNumber":747,"pageContent":"Indeed the Puritan clergy often came very near toendorsing the old Catholic view that ignorancewas the mother of devotion.51 ‘Solicit not thythoughts with matters hid’; Raphael's advice toMilton's Adam52 summed up a century ofhesitation. The Puritans may also have beenparticularly sensitive about astrology because theyfelt that there was a ‘Popish’ character about manyof its practitioners' activities. The consultation wasreminiscent of the confessional, while the electionof times appeared an obvious cousin of the red-letter and black-letter days in the Church calendar.Astrological images and sigils paralleled thecharms worn by the Catholic laity, and the notionthat a separate sign of the zodiac ruled each partof the body recalled the Popish belief that therewas a saint for every disease.53 Eʃorts to brandjudicial astrology as a ‘Popish’ practice were, ofcourse, unlikely to carry much weight with thewell-informed, who knew that it was the medievalclergy who had ɹrst formulated the objections toastrology, and that the Counter-ReformationChurch on the Continent was proceeding againstthe science with considerable vigour.54 But thesmear was superficially plausible."},{"pageNumber":748,"pageContent":"The Puritans were also very sensitive to anyapparent threat to the notion of God'somnipotence, and intolerant of any attempt topenetrate his mysteries. At the core of theirthinking lay a fundamental belief in man's abjectpredicament, compared with the Almighty'sirresistible power. Some other clergy, by contrast,took a more optimistic view of the potentialitiesopen to unaided human reason.55 They were,therefore, less easily roused by the pretensions ofthe astrologers. Astrology accordingly found agood deal of sympathy among the leaders of theChurch, particularly the Laudians. Peter Baro, whointroduced Arminianism to Cambridge, was anastrologer.56 Laud himself was keenlyinterested.57 So was Robert Sanderson, futureBishop of Lincoln.58 Peter Heylyn, Laud'sbiographer, also took the subject seriously;59 whileother Laudian sympathizers in-eluded the Royalist,Thomas Swadlin, who was commissioned to preachbefore the Society of Astrologers in 1653,60 andEdmund Reeve, a keen defender of the Book ofSports, who had preached to them in the previousyear.61 Another of Lilly's conɹdants was the time-"},{"pageNumber":749,"pageContent":"server, John Gauden, who was distinctly anti-Laudian in outlook, but who nevertheless becameBishop of Worcester at the Restoration.62This apparent sympathy of the Arminianstowards astrological activity does not seem to haveattracted any particular comment at the time, and,it must be admitted, did not result in any greaterfreedom for astrological writers during the 1630s.But during the decade of the Civil War it becameapparent to everyone that the most deadlyenemies of judicial astrology were the Calvinists,and especially the Presbyterians. This antipathymay well be explained by doctrinal considerations.For, as the astrologers wryly observed, it was thevery writers who came closest in their own beliefsto the notion of implacable destiny who were mosteasily oʃended by the fatalism of astrology. Whowas the chief opponent of astral science, askedJohn Gadbury, if not ‘the supercilious man inblack’ – ‘the angry presbyter, who of all men mostemulates astrology, and yet hugs an opinion anhundred times more ridiculous than any oneprinciple thereof... viz., that of predestination inthe most terrifying sense?’63 It was preciselybecause the doctrines of the astrologers were so"},{"pageNumber":750,"pageContent":"close in form to their own, and yet so opposed incontent, that the Puritans were aroused.

Yet to penetrate this mystery wasprecisely what the astrologers seemed to beattempting to do. Not only did they predict anindividual's expectation of life and his fortune inthe world. Their textbooks even taught that thestars could indicate a client's prospects of gettingto Heaven. It was the ɹnal insult, thought BishopCarleton, that ‘we must repair to the astrologer toknow who are regenerate in the Church and whoare not’.66Astrology was thus a mode of thought which,though bearing many resemblances topredestination, yet managed to cut right across it.It seemed that the star-gazers had taken theCalvinist dogmas and twisted them into a new andsecular form, ‘turning... eternal predestinationinto fatal destiny; and the election of grace intosidereal elections’.67 Astrology, wrote WilliamPerkins, ‘teaching by the casting of nativities whatmen will be, is ridiculous and impious, because itdetermineth that such shall be very like in life and"},{"pageNumber":752,"pageContent":"conversation whom God in his predestination hathmade unlike’.682. AssimilationBut on the issue of astrology's legitimacy, as onmany others, English Protestantism was todemonstrate strongly ɹssiparous tendencies. Foralthough the Puritans and Presbyterians providedthe focus of opposition, the Independents andradical sects of the Civil War period were tofurnish the astrologers with many activeenthusiasts and supporters. Symbolic of thisassociation was the close link between WilliamLilly and the political leaders of the Independentparty.69 At the outset of the Civil War Lilly,despite a Puritan upbringing, was, if anything,Royalist in sympathy. He had a Cavalier patron inWilliam Pennington of Muncaster, and his ɹrstpublished works maintained a pose of studiedneutrality.70 But his London practice brought himinto touch with the Parliamentary leaders. WhenJohn Pym lay dying in 1643 a friend took asample of his urine to the astrologer, who correctlyprognosticated his imminent decease. This"},{"pageNumber":753,"pageContent":"transaction took place without Pym'sknowledge,71 but in the same year Mrs Lisle, wifeof the regicide John Lisle (and best known as theAlice Lisle who was condemned by Judge Jeʃreysafter Monmouth's rebellion), brought him the urineof Bulstrode Whitelocke, soon to be a highlyinɻuential ɹgure in the counsels of theIndependent party. Lilly successfully predicted thepatient's recovery, thereby earning Whitelocke'spermanent confidence and support.Through his new patron the astrologer forgedclose ties with other Parliamentary leaders,including Denzil Holles, Sir Philip Stapleton, SirChristoper Wray, Robert Reynolds and Sir RobertPye. These men diʃered considerably in theirpolitical sympathies, but Lilly's position, and thatof astrology in general, gradually came to beidentiɹed with the fortunes of the layIndependents and the Army, as against the clericalPresbyterians.Many of the soldiers were wholly for it [hewrote], and many of the Independent party; and Ihad abundance of worthy men in the House ofCommons, my assured friends, no lovers ofPresbytery, which were then in great esteem and"},{"pageNumber":754,"pageContent":"able to protect the art. For should the Presbyterianparty have prevailed... I knew well that theywould have silenced my pen annually.In the autumn of 1647 Lilly and Booker went instate to visit the Army at Windsor, where theywere welcomed by General Fairfax, who confessedthat he did not understand astrology, butexpressed the hope that ‘it was lawful andagreeable to God's word’. Lilly reassured him onthis point and went oʃ to discuss secret matterswith Hugh Peter, the Army chaplain.Ironically enough, the astrologer at this verysame period was being consulted by one of CharlesIs female supporters as to how the King couldescape from his captivity at Hampton Court. Hesupplied further advice (together with hack-sawsand acid) in the autumn of 1648, when he wassimultaneously raising the morale of theParliamentary besiegers of Colchester.72 Lilly infact had a sharp eye for the main chance, as hiscomfortable survival after the Restoration was todemonstrate. In his textbook on astrology hecharacteristically advised would-be practitioners to‘be sparing in delivering judgment against the"},{"pageNumber":755,"pageContent":"commonwealth in which you live’73 —a preceptwhich he was always careful to observe.More important than the obscure but trivialquestion of Lilly's personal loyalties is the strikingeagerness of some Independents to take him up.He became a powerful propagandist and aninɻuential ɹgure behind the scenes. When he gotinto trouble he could count upon assistance andprotection from his new friends. They came to hisaid in 1645 when he fell foul of the Committee ofExaminations after his almanac had castaspersions on the Excise Commissioners.74 Theyrescued him again in 1652, when he foretold thedissolution of the Rump by a combination of Armyand people.75 On this latter occasion he claims tohave been abetted by Speaker Lenthall (‘ever myfriend’) and championed by Sir Arthur Haselrig,Walter Strickland, Richard Salway, Hugh Peter,and Oliver Cromwell himself. During histemporary imprisonment he was visited by thesecretary of the Army, John Rushworth. The fall ofthe Rump in 1653 heralded his period of greatestinɻuence. He repaid his debt to Whitelocke bysuccessfully recommending through his client, JohnClaypole, Cromwell's son-in-law, that his patron"},{"pageNumber":756,"pageContent":"should be appointed Ambassador to Sweden. WhenCromwell became Protector, Lilly could regard ‘allthe soldiery’ as his friends.All this can be learned from Lilly's Autobiography.But his unpublished case books and papers throwan even more intimate light upon the connectionbetween astrology and the Independents, Armyradicals and sectaries. The nature of these dealingsamply disproves any notion that the politicianssimply used Lilly as a convenient means ofpropaganda without believing in the truth ofastrology itself. We have already seen how Lillywas consulted by Richard Overton at a crucialstage of his career as a Leveller leader.76 It maynow be added that the other Levellers, or Armyradicals, who had recourse to astrological advice,usually from Lilly or John Booker, included MajorRainsborough,77 Lieutenant-Colonel Read,78Adjutant-General Allen,79 Cornet Joyce,80 RogerCrab,81 Owen Cox, the Fifth Monarchist seacaptain,82 and several unidentiɹable ‘Agitators’,i.e. elected Army representatives.83 John Bookerdealt with various questions about the Levellers in1649, while Mrs Lilburne, wife of Freeborn John,"},{"pageNumber":757,"pageContent":"remained a regular client from 1653 until theastrologer's death in 1667.84 Lilly may also havebeen consulted in 1648 by the commonalty of theSilk-Weavers Company, who were then engaged indemocratic agitation.85 The case books furtherreveal that, on diʃerent occasions, Lilly or Bookergave consultations to Hugh Peter,86 and to thetwo prominent Cromwellian soldiers, Sir JohnReynolds,87 and Colonel Thomas Morgan.88 Thelist is completed by the name of Major-GeneralJohn Lambert, who was chosen as patron by theastrologer, Jeremy Shakerley, and became one ofLilly's clients. In 1661 he was reported to haveconsulted the astrologer as to whether he shouldattempt to escape from the Tower, where he hadbeen imprisoned since the Restoration.89In addition to these celebrities, a number oflesser ɹgures with astrological interests are knownto have had sectarian or radical associations.Between April 1647 and September 1648, Lilly hadat least ɹve clients who were Anabaptists. In 1645a ‘widow separatist’ wanted to know whether shewould ‘have the man desired’, and in later yearsthe astrologer gave advice to a Ranter, a Quaker,"},{"pageNumber":758,"pageContent":"and the wife of a ‘Shaker’.90 The Puritan origins ofmany of Booker's clients are indicated by suchnames as Sobriety Bollsby, Discipline Whiting andWisdom Hampson (though none of these equalsthe felicity of one of Geoʃrey le Neve's customers –Contented Bird).91There is much additional evidence for this linkbetween astrology and sectarianism. NicholasGretton was both astrologer and leader of asectarian group.92 The Fifth Monarchist, JohnSpittlehouse, praised astrology as the princess ofthe sciences, and Lilly as ‘the prince ofastrologers’.93 The Ranter and ex-Leveller,Laurence Clarkson, took up the practice ofastrology in 1650; and the Digger, GerrardWinstanley, recommended that the subject betaught in his Utopia.94 Some of the leadingpractitioners were men of advanced beliefs. SimonForman had been very radical in his politicalopinions;95 John Pool was a strong republican;96Nicholas Culpepper was another radical with achequered sectarian history.97 John Heydon wasarrested in 1663 for writing a book saying that"},{"pageNumber":759,"pageContent":"Charles II was a tyrant.98 Lilly himself became anAnglican churchwarden, but his second wife, whowas buried in 1654 ‘without bells, withoutceremony, and priest, etc., she so desiring it beforeher death’, was very probably a Quaker.99 So wasthe astrologer George Parker at one stage.100Even John Gadbury, who ultimately became aRoyalist and crypto-Catholic, had been a Ranterand a convert of Abiezer Coppe at the beginningof his astrological career.101The Interregnum saw an inɻux into theastrological profession which closely resembled thestorming of the pulpit by the tub-preachers. ‘Thelate years of the tyranny,’ recalled John Heydon in1664, ‘admitted stocking-weavers, shoemakers,millers, masons, carpenters, bricklayers,gunsmiths, porters, butlers, etc. to write and teachastrology and physic.’102 The radical sects set outto revive all the occult sciences. John Websterattacked the universities of Oxford and Cambridgefor their failure to provide adequate instruction innatural magic – ‘that sublime knowledge wherebythe wonderful gifts of the Creator are discovered,and innumerable beneɹts produced’.103 This was"},{"pageNumber":760,"pageContent":"a ɹeld which the reformers thought more likely toproduce immediate practical results than themechanical philosophy which was becoming thedominant scientiɹc idiom of the day. Websteraccordingly chided the Universities for despisingastrology – ‘so noble and beneɹcial a science’ –and warmly commended the eʃorts of Ashmole,Lilly, Saunders and Culpepper.104 With astrologywere linked the companion studies of alchemy,cryptography, magnetism, dreams and Paracelsianmedicine.Astrology was thus particularly associated withwhat the Presbyterian Thomas Hall called the‘Familistical-Levelling-Magical temper’.105 Thesects admired it for its practical utility, and for itscongeniality with the Familist, Theosophist orBehmenist doctrines of illumination, which wereenjoying a considerable vogue at this time.Between 1644 and 1662 the whole of the writingsof the German mystic Jacob Boehme weretranslated into English, and the sect of‘Behmenists’ was picked up by Richard Baxter asone of the signiɹcant religious groups of theInterregnum period. The Familists, who held thatChrist was ‘a Type, and but a Type’, believed that"},{"pageNumber":761,"pageContent":"it was possible for man ‘totally to be inhabited byChrist’. That is to say, they were perfectionists,envisaging that man could attain a holy state inthis existence.106 They were a powerful influenceupon the Quakers, and barely distinguishable fromsome of the Ranters. The appeal of Boehme'sintolerably obscure writings is diɽcult toappreciate today, but his mysticism was foundedupon the old doctrines of microcosm andmacrocosm, and his thought, like that ofSwedenborg after him, preserved importantelements of the hermetic tradition. He thereforeregarded astrology as at least a partial road to thetruth.107According to his leading English interpreter,John Sparrow, Boehme took the view that the wayto God and to the understanding of the universelay through the scrutiny of the human soul, forman, as microcosm, contained within himself theepitome of nature. This fundamental kinship ofman with the universe was the basis for mysticalunion with God.108 As a later English disciple,Thomas Tryon, put it, ‘There is an astrology withinMan as well as without him. A microcosmical sunand moon and all the rest of the planets we carry"},{"pageNumber":762,"pageContent":"about us.’ Another of Boehme's followers, theWelshman Morgan Llwyd, also believed that theseven planets could be found within man.109 Themystical aim of the Behmenists was to theologizethis internal astrology, and to convert it into aspiritual force. A work attributed to ValentineWeigel, an earlier German writer of the sameschool, was translated in 1649 with the titleAstrologie Theologized. For many of the Familists,however, Behmenism was a more practical aʃair,holding out the prospect of special power fromoccult knowledge. ‘The Familists are veryconɹdent,’ wrote a contemporary, ‘that byknowledge of astrology and the strength of reasonthey shall be able to conquer over the wholeworld.’110 As William Law subsequentlyremarked, Boehme's seventeenth-century readerswished to steal from him certain mysteries ofnature and to run away with the philosopher'sstone.111Whatever their motivation, it seems clear that akeen interest in astrological speculation united theleading English Behmenists. Dr John Pordage,rector of Bradɹeld, practised astrology and wastemporarily ejected in 1655 for his occult"},{"pageNumber":763,"pageContent":"activities. His son Samuel was a regular client ofJohn Booker. Another student of astrology wasCharles Hotham, who introduced Behmenism toCambridge in 1646.112 Other prominent Familistsincluded Roger Crab, whom we have alreadyencountered in Lilly's consulting-room,113 ThomasTryon, famous as a teetotaller, and keenlyinterested in astrology,114 and Robert Gell, whopreached before the Society of Astrologers onseveral occasions.115 Comfort Everard, describedin Booker's notebook as ‘the young woman thatpractiseth astrology’, may have been related to theEverard who was one of Pordage's followers, whileJohn Gadbury is known for certain to have had aFamilist phase.

According to Lilly, heinstructed many other ministers in astrology, and‘would lend them whole cloak-bags of books’.Although he employed a curate to preach in hisplace, Napier was famous as a man of exemplarypiety.

John Gadbury made thesame point in 1658: ‘It is notoriously known thatthe clergy are not more sanctimonious than otherpersons, but subject to the same passions, etc. andtherefore may be beneɹted by the art of astrologyeven as others.’133 Lilly included clergymenamong his clients, most of them chieɻy concernedwith their future preferment. One Dr Humphriesasked whether he could secure a living; a seachaplain inquired about his prospects of futureemployment; and an anonymous querentconfessed his interest in ‘preferment to a fatbenefice’.134 Another minister, Mr Devorax,frequently commissioned the astrologer to resolvehis personal problems,135 and there were manyother inquiries about beneɹces.136 Lilly'scorrespondents included several country clergy,one of whom, Robert Sterrell, parson of LittleWigborough, Essex, asked him to calculate whether"},{"pageNumber":770,"pageContent":"he had any chance of becoming skilful in astrologyhimself.137 John Booker's customers included twoLondon clergymen, John Booker's, curate of StBotolph without Aldgate, and William Harrison, ofSt James, Duke's Place.138 One client even askedLilly in 1647 to resolve astrologically whether hisbrother should go into the Church.139 In theirpublished text-books the astrologers pointedlyincluded rules for determining a client's prospectsof ecclesiastical preferment.140Godly laymen might also succumb to this mostseductive of arts.

Thealmanacs usually carried an introductory discoursejustifying the subject and rebutting the aspersionsof its clerical enemies.But such scruples were frequently overcome. Theastrologers even had theological arguments tojustify their remuneration.

Bothastrologers and clients usually found it possible toarrive at a modus vivendi which permitted them toreconcile their religion with their practice withouttoo much soul-searching. Yet the preachers fearedthat the vogue for astrology might lead to thereplacement of the Christian God by the planetarydivinities of classical antiquity, whose memorywas preserved in the names of the months and thedays of the week. Astrology, they recalled, hadbegun as a religion rather than a science, and theBible contained warnings against star-worship.The celestial bodies were eternal, universal andallegedly omnipotent; might not theircontemplation turn into a sort of mysticalcommunion?

From time totime interpreters compiled full-scale keys to theseprophecies indicating which of theircontemporaries were to be equated with thesemythological beasts.1 An Elizabethan writermocked talk of ‘eagles and beagles, cats and rats,dogs and hogs, crows and bows, stones and deadmen's bones, country hobs and lobs, clouted shoonand midsummer moon’,2 but the Galfridianprophecies were immensely adaptable, and, solong as the monarchy and peerage used suchemblems, they could be plausibly applied to ɹtcontemporary events.Another type was the ‘painted prophecy’ – anilluminated scroll or picture depicting such subjectsas kings, priests and heraldic symbols.

There will be no attemptto tackle them here, for our concern is with the useto which the prophecies were put bycontemporaries, not with the circumstances oftheir original composition. For this purpose it maybe reasonably assumed that the majority ofprophecies fell into one of two main genres: theywere either genuine utterances of an earlierperiod, reinterpreted to ɹt new events in ɻagrantdisregard of their original circumstances ofcomposition (much the larger category), orspurious inventions by contemporaries, layingfraudulent claims to a hoary antiquity.

This in turn lapsed on the accession ofMary Tudor but was renewed by a statute of1563.56 In addition, the routine machinery ofTudor government – proclamations, orders by thePrivy Council, instructions to J.P.s, and inquiriesby the bishops – was regularly directed against theprophecies and their authors.57This government concern was provoked by theclose link which had always existed betweenprophecy and action. The prophecies of Merlin hadbeen reissued in the fourteenth century to supportthe English claim to the throne of France, and inthe ɹfteenth to justify the rival aspirations of Yorkand Lancaster. Many manuscript collections ofprophecies were compiled to advance the claims ofsome participant in the Wars of the Roses.58 InWales an enormous output of political prophecysustained the tradition that the Saxons would one"},{"pageNumber":796,"pageContent":"day be expelled. Political prophecies played animportant part in the revolts led by OwainGlyndwr against Henry IV, and by Rhys apGruʃydd against Henry VIII. Tales of Merlin wereretold in late sixteenth-century Wales, andvolumes of nationalist prophecy continued toworry the English government.59The Irish similarly kept up their hopes of drivingout the alien conqueror by disseminating suitableprophecies. Gerald of Wales had seen thefulɹlment of ancient prophecies in the conquest ofIreland by Henry II, but in the reign of Elizabeth Ithe ‘prophecy of Giraldus Cambrensis’ was used tosupport the claims of the Irish. In 1593 aninhabitant of County Kildare lost his ears forasserting that a prophecy said an O'Donnell wouldone day be King of Ireland. Similar prophecieswere disseminated during the Ulster Rebellion of1641; one of them predicted that Sir Phelim O'Neillwould drive Charles I and his posterity out ofEngland.60In fact prophecies of one kind or another wereemployed in virtually every rebellion or popularrising which disturbed the Tudor state. There hadbeen some evidence of this under Henry VII in the"},{"pageNumber":797,"pageContent":"conspiracy surrounding Perkin Warbeck, andEdward, Earl of Warwick.61 In the following reignCardinal Wolsey had been impressed by theprophecy:When this cow rideth thebullThen priest beware thyskull.The dun cow was a royal badge, and the bull wassoon taken to be Anne Boleyn.62 This was but aforetaste of the torrent of prophecies and counter-prophecies unleashed by the breach with Rome inthe 1530s, the years which led Chapuys, theImperial Ambassador, to remark of the Englishthat they were peculiarly credulous, and easilymoved to insurrection by prophecies.63During this period prophecies, claiming to bederived from Merlin, Bede, Thomas Rymer, Johnof Bridlington and similar sources, circulatedextensively throughout the country, particularly inthe north of England, where the most activeresistance to the government was to be found.

The parish priests, he declared, would rule therealm for three days and three nights, ‘and thenthe white falcon should come out of the North-Westand kill almost all the priests’.64 (The white falconwas the badge of Anne Boleyn.)The representatives of the old order based manyof their hopes upon the favourable interpretationof prophecies of this kind. The monks of Furnessbelieved that Henry VIII would be slain bypriests,65 and the Pilgrims of Grace had their ownprophecy testifying to the ɹtness of Robert Aske tobe their leader (‘Forth shall come a worm, an Askewith one eye’).66 There were also anti-"},{"pageNumber":799,"pageContent":"Cromwellian prophecies:Much ill cometh of a smallnote,As Crumb well set in aman's throat,That shall put many othersto pain,God wote; 67and sibyllic prophecies concerning ‘K.

His utterances related to the future battles tobe fought in England, the fall of Charing Cross, theMouldwarp, the Lilly, the Crumb, ‘K.L.M.’, and thepriests who would expel the King.

They were suspicious of allforms of divination, and Merlin was ɹrmly placedupon the Index. The prophetic element in Catholicthought was a popular aʃair, surviving longestamong the uneducated.

He entitled his almanac MerlinusAnglicus, and included an astrological forecast byKepler in a collection of Galfridian-stylepredictions.119 It is doubtful if many readersdistinguished astrological forecasts from otherpredictions based on the interpretation ofScripture (for example, ‘Brightman's"},{"pageNumber":820,"pageContent":"prophecy’),120 or delivered oracularly by seerslike Merlin.

Yet a prophecy's authority waspositively enhanced by a pedigree of this kind.Just as the Catholic past seemed a time whenpriests enjoyed a magical power denied to theirProtestant successors, so was it also regarded as anage when prophecy and foreknowledge were opento holy men.There was, however, an attempt to giveGalfridian prophecy some theologicalrespectability.

The genre continued with ThomasPugh's British and Outlandish Prophesies (1658),which used the Welsh and Scottish prophecies toshow that Charles I had been the Mould-warp, thatOliver Cromwell was the Welsh hero long awaited,and that Charles II's attempts to secure hisrestoration were doomed to failure. In March 1659appeared perhaps the largest collection of all –Forraign and Domestick Prophesies both antient andmodern – nearly 200 pages of prophetic texts,many of them in Welsh.The Interregnum was an age of proliɹcpamphleteering, and it would be wrong to attachsigniɹcance to every publication of that crowdedera. But the prophecies cannot be dismissed asmere ephemera issued for a frivolous ordisinterested public. In terms of circulation theywere strikingly successful. In his AutobiographyLilly claimed that his Prophecy of the White Kingsold 1800 copies in three days. This boast cannotbe checked, but the accidental survival of hisprinter's bill reveals that the Collection of Ancientand Moderne Prophecies (1645) went into threeimpressions, representing a total of 4,500copies.132 The actual readership would, of course,"},{"pageNumber":827,"pageContent":"have been much greater. Contemporary letters anddiaries show how seriously this prophetic literaturewas taken by clergymen and gentry, as well as byhumbler folk.133 Politicians were also inɻuencedby it. The Marquis of Montrose came to grief afterallegedly basing his hopes on the propheticassurance that he would recover Scotland for theKing and lead an army to settle his otherdominions.134 A pictorial prophecy predicting theIrish massacres of 1641 was brought over toEngland by Dean Jones (later Bishop of Clogher)and solemnly considered by the House ofCommons Committee on Irish Aʃairs. It was saidto have been found on an old scroll hidden in thewall of the fort of Newry.135 Mother Shipton'sutterances were brought up at every opportunityby one unidentiɹed ‘great statesman’. Among thepopulace they were said to be virtuallycanonical.136 The people of England, thoughtEdward Hyde in 1652, were ‘alarmed and evenhalf dead with prophecies’.137Inevitably the Restoration of Charles II was alsodiscovered to have been foreshadowed by ancientprophetic utterances.

The Welsh prophet, Arise Evans,however, had predicted the Restoration as early as1653, on the basis of the same prophecy whichLilly had used to announce the end of monarchy inEngland.139 Even some of the educated classeswere persuaded that ancient prophecies hadforeseen the events of 1660. The virtuoso EliasAsh-mole was later told by Sir William Backhousethat in 1659 his tutor had shown him ‘an oldwriting’ whose hieroglyphics implied the return ofCharles II in the following year.140 The defeatedparty also drew consolation from these ancientsources.

There was nothing forced about such aninterpretation, he assured his readers. ‘It is alldeduced from prophets long since deceased andfrom manuscripts worm-eaten with age.’144 The"},{"pageNumber":830,"pageContent":"version ultimately published, however, did notinclude his exegesis, for Lilly seems to have beenbeaten to the post by a competitor. The clergymanwho put out The Prophecie of Thomas Becket in1666 asserted that it had been ‘lately found in anancient manuscript at Abingdon’, and made nomention of the fact that it had already beenpublished by Lilly in 1645.145During the following decades prophecies wereused as propaganda in the Third Dutch War and inthe wars against France.146 They were prominentin the political literature of the Popish Plot andExclusion Crisis and cited in support ofMonmouth.147 This was the period whenNostradamus resumed his career as aprognosticator of English history. Later hisutterances were to be adapted to ɹt the AmericanWar of Independence and the FrenchRevolution.148 Other prophets were invoked toexplain the 1688 Revolution and the triumph ofWilliam III.149 The Jacobites also had theirprophecies.

Nevertheless, the evidence suggeststhat after the seventeenth century such prophecieswere not usually taken seriously by educatedpersons.

Sleeping heroesIt has been seen how political prophecies tended tobe invoked at a time of crisis, usually todemonstrate that some drastic change, eitherdesired or already accomplished, had beenforeseen by the sages of the past. In this wayprophecies were felt to provide a sanction both forresistance to established authority and for theconsolidation of a new regime.A similar stabilizing function was performed bythe various prophecies which competing dynastiessometimes found it necessary to invoke in supportof their claims to the English throne. Most of thesesprang from the mythical account of British historywhich had been disseminated by Geoʃrey ofMonmouth in the twelfth century. According tothis legend the ancient Britons were thedescendants of Brutus, the grandson of Aeneas ofTroy, who had conquered the land from Gogmagogand the other giants who had been in possession ofit and founded London to celebrate his triumph.Centuries later the invasion of the Saxons hadbeen repelled by King Arthur, who went on to"},{"pageNumber":833,"pageContent":"conquer most of Northern Europe, but waswounded in a civil war at home and taken oʃ torecuperate at Avalon. The country wassubsequently overrun by the Saxons, but not beforethe dying Cadwalader, last of the British rulers,had received from an angel the prophetic messagethat the Britons would one day recover theirheritage.152The myth of the eventual return of Arthur or hisroyal line was cherished in all the Celtic countries;when some French monks visiting Bodmin in 1113denied that Arthur was still alive their scepticismprovoked a riot.153 Arthur long remained arallying cause for provincial sentiment in Walesand Brittany, while in England during the Wars ofthe Roses the British myth was exploited by each ofthe warring factions. First Edward IV and thenHenry VII stressed their aɽliations with the Britishpast by having genealogies constructed to provetheir descent from the stock of Cadwalader. Thisconnection was heavily emphasized in 1486 whenHenry VII had his eldest son named Arthur, afterhe had been born in Winchester, home of theRound Table.The triumph of the Tudors was thus hailed by"},{"pageNumber":834,"pageContent":"royal apologists as the fulɹlment of the propheciesmade to the dying Cadwalader, and there was abrief but deliberate cult of Arthur and the BritishHistory. Henry VIII drew upon the legend ofArthur's Empire to justify his breach withRome.154 In the reign of Elizabeth I theexpansionist aspects of the myth were furtherdeveloped by Dee, Hakluyt and similar imperialistwriters. In Spenser's Faery Queene the monarchy ofElizabeth was celebrated as the apotheosis of theArthurian tradition.James I also used the Brutus myth to consolidatehis accession to the English throne, by claimingdescent from Gruʃydd ap Llywelyn, the last Welshprince, as well as from Henry VII, the reputeddescendant of Cadwalader. The ɹrst Stuart thusappeared as the long-lost British King. In addition,the Union of the two kingdoms of England andScotland could be seen as the fulɹlment of theancient tradition that the lands which Brutus hadfatally divided amongst his three sons, and whichArthur had temporarily reunited, would one day bepermanently joined under the rule of a singleprince. This notion had been used by both sides injustiɹcation of the Anglo-Scottish wars. Edward I"},{"pageNumber":835,"pageContent":"and Henry IV of England had claimed to bereconstituting Arthur's kingdom, while the Scotsargued with equal plausibility that the long-prophesied union was intended to be accomplishedby a Scotsman. Both nations made much use ofancient prophecies during the sixteenthcentury,155 and in 1640 the Scottish soldiers inNewcastle were once again to give them anaggressive interpretation.156The peaceful union of the two kingdoms in1603, however, could be plausibly represented asthe prophecy's true meaning, and even beforeJames's accession, his English supporters invokedit in justiɹcation of his claim.157 Once he hadarrived, it was widely urged that the Brutus legendhad been fulɹlled. Even the Scots thought theunion of the two kingdoms in the ninth degree ofthe Bruce's blood to have been foreseen by theprophecies of Thomas the Rymer.158In keeping with the myth, the Stuarts assumedtheir new style as Kings of Great Britain (‘WhenHempe's spun England's done’). Merlin was said tohave prophesied that ‘the island shall be called bythe name of the Brutus, and the name given it by"},{"pageNumber":836,"pageContent":"the foreigners abolished’.159 Against the wishes ofthe House of Commons, who wanted to preservethe separate names of Scotland and England, theKing assumed the new title, declaring ‘that theisland was Britany, and therefore being King ofthe whole island he would be King of Britany, asBrutus and Arthur were, who had the style, andwere kings of the whole island’.160 Sir WilliamAlexander assured the monarch thatThe world long'd for thy birth three hundrethyears,Since first fore-told wrapt in prophetic rimes,and Drummond of Hawthornden declared thatThis is that king who should make right eachwrong,Of whom the bards and mysticke Sibillessong,The man long promis'd, by whose gloriousreign,This isle should yet her ancient nameregain.161"},{"pageNumber":837,"pageContent":"The Stuarts were thus able to exploit the myth ofthe long-prophesied deliverer to their ownadvantage. But this type of belief was normallyassociated with popular resistance movements.Whether the leader was a sleeping hero likeArthur, or Sebastian of Portugal or the Geraldinesand O'Neills in Ireland, not dead, but merelybiding their time, or whether, like the JewishMessiah, he was yet to come, his appeal wasusually to the defeated and oppressed awaitingdeliverance. This was a universal myth, withcounterparts in the history of virtually everyEuropean country, and it rested upon a propheticfoundation.162In England this type of belief has never inspiredmass-movements comparable in scale to thoselaunched by the pseudo-Fredericks of medievalGermany. But it has frequently recurred. The twodeposed monarchs, Edward II and Richard II, forexample, were both credited with a posthumoussurvival; in 1330 Edmund, Earl of Kent, wasexecuted for activities arising from his belief thathis dead brother Edward II was still alive; and inthe early ɹfteenth century there were rumours thatRichard II was living in Scotland, the claim that he"},{"pageNumber":838,"pageContent":"was still alive being reiterated as late as 1416.163Similar rumours followed the defeat of popularrisings. A year after the slaughter of Ket and hisfollowers, an Earlham woman was overheard toremark that ‘there are ɹve hundred of Mouseholdmen that are gone down to the great Turk and tothe Dauphin and will be here again byMidsummer’.164 In 1570 there was said to be dailytalk in the north of the imminent return of therebels who had been decisively defeated in therising of the Northern Earls in the previousyear.165 In the 1630s Sir John Coke, Secretary toCharles I, was bombarded with letters from areligious enthusiast assuring him that theProtestant hero, Gustavus Adolphus, had not reallybeen killed at Lützen, but was living in Seleuciaand would come again to ɹght the Whore ofBabylon.166 In the late seventeenth century manywest countrymen refused to believe that the Dukeof Monmouth had really been executed in 1685.The rumour that he was still alive lasted until thereign of George III. It was reported that anotherman had been executed in Monmouth's place –Colonel White in one version, ‘an old man with abeard’ in another - and individuals were"},{"pageNumber":839,"pageContent":"periodically apprehended for masquerading as thedead Duke.167 Yet he was not the last sleepinghero in English history, for the same refusal toaccept that a public ɹgure was really dead was tobe shown in the cases of General Gordon and LordKitchener.168 In more primitive countries thereluctance to accept the death of a rebel leader canstill be found. The decision of the state of Malawiin 1965 to conduct executions in public was takento demonstrate to the defeated that their leaderswere truly dead.169The most curious sleeping hero in our periodwas the boy-king Edward VI, who died at the ageof ɹfteen in 1553. In his own life-time it had beennecessary for him, as for many other monarchs, tomake public appearances so as to refute maliciousrumours that he was dead.170 After his death thesituation was paradoxically reversed. In 1588 JohnHarvey lamented:Alas, what fond and vain expectation hath along time rested in the minds not of one or two ora few, but of great multitudes of the simpler sort inEngland about King Edward the Sixth, as thoughthey were sure either of his arising from death, or"},{"pageNumber":840,"pageContent":"his return from I know not what Jerusalem orother strange land... And what counterfeitsuborned merchants of base parentage havesithence ranged abroad in the country, presumingto term themselves by the rival name of KingEdward.171The rumour started very shortly after theaccession of Mary Tudor. During the course of herreign several individuals were imprisoned, and amiller's son executed, for impersonating the lateKing or distributing bills saying that he was aliveand living in France.172 Manuscript versions ofprophecies hinting at his return in 1556 are stillextant.173 At this stage Edward was presumably asymbol of Protestantism and anti-Spanishsentiment. Yet the tradition carried on into thereign of Elizabeth, who was herself both Protestantand anti-Spanish.In 1581 Robert Blosse, alias Mantell, an Essexyeoman and ex-naval gunner, was executed after aseries of adventures in which he had begun bydisseminating the rumour that Edward VI wasalive and ended by impersonating the dead Kinghimself. The original idea that the King was alive"},{"pageNumber":841,"pageContent":"had been passed on to him by an Oxford scholar inthe reign of Mary, and the notion stuck in hismind. His case caused the Elizabethan governmentsome embarrassment, for in the Attorney-General'sopinion there was nothing treasonable aboutmerely saying that Edward VI was alive. Mantellwas ultimately convicted for impersonating theKing, which was, on Marian precedents, anundoubted oʃence, but promptly escaped fromColchester gaol, where he had been held. The PrivyCouncil, much ɻurried, ordered the arrest of thegaoler and of the persons concerned in eʃectingthe escape. In 1581, Mantell, having beenrecaptured, was sent down to Essex for trial onceagain, all scruples about the status of his oʃencehaving been dissipated by his prison-breaking.‘The long reserving of him,’ declared the Council,‘hath given occasion unto others to cast abroadseditious libels to the disturbance of her Highness'sestate.’ This time he did not escape the ghastlyritual of a traitor's death.174Six years later another culprit appeared at EssexAssizes on a similar charge. This was WilliamFrancis, a smith of Hatɹeld Peverel, who haddenied that King Edward was dead; he further"},{"pageNumber":842,"pageContent":"declared that he personally knew the man whohad carried King Edward ‘in a red mantle intoGermany in a ship called the Harry’, asserting thatthe so-called tomb of Edward VI contained ahollow piece of lead.175 In the same year theLeicester embroiderer Sawford also said that the‘dead man’ mentioned in Merlin's prophecy waseither King Arthur or King Edward VI.176 In 1589Edward was reported by a soldier returned fromthe Low Countries to be alive and living in Spainor France. Twelve years later the rumour croppedup again, in the mouth of a Radnorshire vagrantnamed Thomas Vaughan, who was examined atOxford in May 1599. According to him, a substitutechild had been put to death in King Edward'splace, and he himself had been conveyed toDenmarmark, where he had become King; in thiscapacity he had saved the lives of the commons ofEngland, Wales and Ireland by supplying corn andother provisions. This may have been a referenceto the contemporary import of Baltic grain intimes of scarcity, but it also echoes the mention inseveral of the prophecies attributed to Bede,Merlin, et al. of a King, or Duke, of Denmark whowould invade England and seize the throne."},{"pageNumber":843,"pageContent":"Vaughan's interrogators reported to the LordTreasurer that he was a very simple person, ‘littlebetter than a natural’; but it is likely that thisElizabethan beggar's ingenuous words werederived from the hope of a Danish alliance againstEngland which had been preserved in Scottishprophetic verse since the fourteenth century.177An even more elaborate version of the myth ofEdward VI was revealed in 1606 to have beenpropagated by Gervase Smith, parson of Polstead,Suʃolk. Smith, who was dissatisɹed with KingJames I because of his failure to persecute thePapists eʃectively, observed that Merlin'sprophecy had stated that E. would be succeeded byI., M., and ɹnally by E. This he interpreted asmeaning that King I(ames) would come to ruin atthe hands of the Papists, who would set up M(ary)to persecute the Protestants, who would eventuallybe saved by E(dward), descendant of the house ofCadwalader. The latter, he thought, was probablyEdward VI, who was either dead or living ‘inAfrica’ and would be miraculously raised up again.Investigation revealed that Smith had inherited acollection of prophecies from an old man who haddied in his house. From these he had learned of M.,"},{"pageNumber":844,"pageContent":"i.e. Mary, who would restore Catholicism, and E.,who would put it down. He assumed that E. wasEdward VI, ‘who the prophecies say shall riseagain’. Smith was a Puritan zealot who felt thatthe Church of England was not in accordance withthe primitive church, and would like to have seenall Catholics put to death. His talk of ancientprophecies had been notorious in theneighbourhood. A few years earlier he had showna minister a book saying that King Sebastian ofPortugal was still alive, a further instance of anapparently obsessive interest in prophecies aboutlost leaders.178To Gervase Smith Edward VI had appealed as aPuritan hero, yet the earlier impostor, RobertMantell, had been a suspected Catholic, and theprecise attraction of the boy-king clearly variedaccording to the circumstances. The idea of adeliverer named Edward may have originated withLambert Simnel, the pretender to Henry VII'sthrone, who masqueraded as Edward, Earl ofWarwick, and was crowned in Dublin as EdwardVI. Perkin Warbeck had also exploited the rumourthat Edward IV's children were not really dead, buthad been secretly conveyed into another country."},{"pageNumber":845,"pageContent":"The notion, however, may have gone back evenfurther; for in 1532 a conjurer declared that PrinceEdward, child of Henry VI, had had a son who hadbeen conveyed overseas and whose child was alivein France or Germany; either he or the King of theScots would reign after Henry VIII.179 But,basically, the myth of Edward's return wassustained by the many Galfridian and Scottishprophecies promising the return of a dead man orlost leader.180 One dating from 1552 speciɹcallydeclared that ‘E. shall rise out of his sleep like alive man whom all men thought to be dead’.181 Itwas almost certainly a version of this prophecywhich came into the hands of John Tusser, EdwardSawford and Gervase Smith. As late as 1652 apublished collection of prophecies included a mid-sixteenth-century prediction, attributed to ‘RobertBlake’, that ‘a dead man shall rise’. ‘Up Edwardthe Sixth,’ it declared, ‘the time is come.’1824.

On one level they may beregarded as simply a propaganda device, based on"},{"pageNumber":846,"pageContent":"the eternal truth that nothing is more likely tobring about the success of an enterprise than theconviction of those who undertake it that they arepredestined to succeed. From this point of view,the function of ancient prophecies was no differentfrom that of astrological or magicalprognostication in general. Selden wrote ofprophecies that ‘they make a man go on withboldness and courage.... If he obtains he attributesmuch to them; if he miscarries he thinks no moreof them, or is no more thought of himself.’183Prophecies, as Hobbes put it, were ‘many times theprincipal cause of the event foretold’.184 Givensuch obvious political eʃects, it is not diɽcult tosee why prophecies were often fabricated for theoccasion. Such forgeries can be recognised by theirtendency to include an exact account of events upto the date of the prophecy's ‘discovery’, followedby a more shadowy prognostication of whatremained in store. The prophecies disseminated atthe time of the Popish Plot, for example, usuallyincluded a precise outline of the careers of CharlesI and Cromwell, before embarking upon hazierutterances concerning the triumph ofProtestantism and the fall of Rome."},{"pageNumber":847,"pageContent":"But the political utility of these prophecies doesnot explain the disposition to believe them in theɹrst place. Neither does it tell us why men felt theneed to manufacture prophecies after the event.For, as often as not, the prophecy was only‘discovered’ when the events to which it referredhad taken place. As Samuel Butler cynicallyobserved, ‘they are never heard of till it is to nopurpose’.185 Most of the predictions based on theambiguities of surnames, for example, seem likelyto have been made up after the event. Henry IVwas told that he would die in Jerusalem, but‘Jerusalem’ turned out to be the name of a room ina house belonging to the Abbot of Westminster.The Welsh image of Derfel Gadarn would ‘set onɹre a forest’; it was brought to London by theHenrician reformers and the Franciscan friar JohnForest was burned with it. Cardinal Wolsey knewthat Kingston would be fatal to him; he was dulyarrested by Sir William Kingston.186 There aremany wry stories of this type, but very few can betraced back to a strictly contemporary source. Themajority seem to have been invented or ‘improved’by persons in search of an edifying tale. Yetalthough they possess a certain narrative felicity,"},{"pageNumber":848,"pageContent":"this does not explain why men should have felt theneed to invent them.The truth seems to be that at the heart of thebelief in prophecies there lay an urge to believethat even the most revolutionary doings ofcontemporaries had been foreseen by the sages ofthe past. For what these predictions did was todemonstrate that there was a link betweencontemporary aspirations and those of remoteantiquity. Their function was to persuade men thatsome proposed change was not so radical that ithad not been foreseen by their ancestors. This hadthe eʃect of disguising any essentiallyrevolutionary step by concealing it under thesanction of past approval. Prophecies, therefore,were not simple morale-boosters: they provided a‘validating charter’ (to adopt the anthropologists'phrase) for new enterprises undertaken in the faceof strong contemporary prohibitions. They justifiedwars or rebellions and they made periods ofunprecedented change emotionally acceptable tothose who lived in them. As John Harvey put it:they were resurrected ‘to serve present turns, andto feed the working humour of busy andtumultuous heads, continually aʃecting some"},{"pageNumber":849,"pageContent":"innovation or other’.187To understand the need for such a validatingcharter it should be recalled that for sixteenth-century Englishmen the existing political orderwas not regarded as a matter of mere practicalconvenience, changeable at will. It was divinelyordained, and God's sanctions would fall upon therebel wicked enough to challenge it. When a manembarked upon the drastic course of insurrectionhe was ɻouting all the moral teaching of the dayand cutting himself loose from the whole socialand political order in which he had been nurtured.At such times prophecy made its appeal byproviding a sanction for such dramatic action.Ideally the prophecy was a divine one, indicatingthat rebellious activity was in accordance withGod's will and therefore not a sin but a positiveduty. Hence the theological language in which thesuccessive revolutionary groups of the Civil Warperiod clothed their aspirations. But, as analternative, recourse could be had to the ancientprophecies, which through their vagueness andambiguity were easily adaptable to ɹt newcircumstances. Faith in such a prophecy broughtauthority and conviction to those staking all on a"},{"pageNumber":850,"pageContent":"desperate step. It gave a sort of moral justiɹcationto those engaged in the gambler's throw ofrebellion; and it kept up the spirits of the defeatedby assuring them that time was on their side.Sometimes the prophecy was not discovered orinvented until the change had already taken place.In those cases its role was to conceal the breachand make it respectable by bringing it into linewith the pattern of the past.The appeal to ancient prophecy was thereforebut one aspect of that concern to discoverprecedents for every radical step which colouredmost aspects of English public life in the centurybefore the Civil War. This desire can be seenduring the Reformation, when the breach withRome was presented not as a new departure, butas a return to the situation which had existedbefore the Papal ‘usurpation’. The Act in Restraintof Appeals to Rome (1533) invoked ‘divers oldchronicles’, which showed England to haveoriginally been an ‘empire’ independent of Papaljurisdiction. Attempts were also made to show thatChristianity had been established in Britain byJoseph of Arimathea, centuries before the Papalmission of St Augustine, or by the fabulous KingLucius of Britain in the second century A.D.

The Protestant religion, thought the greatantiquary, Sir Simonds D'Ewes, had ɻourished inEngland 400 years before Augustine; it had beenpreserved among the Welsh and Scots withoutinterruption until Wycliʃe, and had been secretlypractised in England from at least the time ofHenry II.189The same anxiety to conceal the fact ofunprecedented change was shown by the earlyStuart parliaments.

Instead they sought toshow that their programme was but a demand forthe restoration of liberties enjoyed by theirfourteenth-century or even Anglo-Saxon"},{"pageNumber":852,"pageContent":"predecessors. Political argument took the form oflegal controversy – determining just what the lawwas – and all discussion was conducted on theɹctitious assumption of an unchangingconstitutional structure.

Thelinks snapped, and for the ɹrst time men wereprepared to assert the inherent merit of a politicalprogramme, regardless of whether or not it hadever previously been put into eʃect.190 Yet, eventhen, most political thought remained essentiallyan inquiry into origins; happenings in the state ofnature or some other version of the primitive paststill determined men's political obligations in thepresent.Ancient prophecies, like spurious history, alsohelped to mitigate the otherwise revolutionarydoings of contemporaries.

At times of stress men scrutinized theseancient myths with a view to extracting from themsome sanction for the dangerous courses of actionupon which they proposed to embark. Under thepressure of change they most felt the need forreassurance that what was happening had beenforeseen by their ancestors and was in some sensepart of a larger plan. It was no accident that theperiods when prophecies were most prominent inEnglish life were precisely those of rebellion,discontent and violent change – the Reformationand the Civil War, in particular.All societies seek to establish links with theirown past, to display the ‘founding charter’ whichexplains and justiɹes their own existence.

A pretender to the throne mustdemonstrate genealogical continuity. Hence thegreat cult of prophecies during the ɹfteenthcentury: ‘When the Civil War was hottest betweenYork and Lancaster,’ wrote the Elizabethan Earl ofNorthampton, ‘the books of Beasts and Babieswere exceeding rife and current in every quarterand corner of the realm, either side applying andinterpreting as they were affected to the title.’191Hence also all the impostors masquerading asthe representatives of some branch, real orimaginary, of the royal family. Apart from well-known pretenders like Lambert Simnel, PerkinWarbeck, and all the would-be Sleeping Heroes,there were many less famous eccentrics: MaryBaynton, the Yorkshire woman, who in 1533 gave"},{"pageNumber":855,"pageContent":"herself out to be the King's daughter Mary, ‘putforth into the broad world to shift for herliving’;192 Anne Burnell, who claimed in 1587 tobe the child of Philip II;193 Bartholomew Helson,who in 1607 announced himself the son of MaryTudor, stolen from Hampton Court;194 CorneliusEvans, who masqueraded as the Prince of Wales in1648;195 and Thomas Tany, who claimed in the1650s to be the Earl of Essex and the heir toCharles I's throne.196 There was also the youngman named ‘Arthur’ who entered Spain in 1587,claiming to be the oʃspring of Elizabeth andLeicester, and the youth who rushed naked into StJames's in 1612, pretending to be the ghost ofPrince Henry.197 Absurd though such pretensionsmay seem to us, they were no more ridiculous thanthe royal genealogies linking the Yorkists andTudors to the founding fathers, Adam andBrutus.198 Ancient prophecies gave ancestry to theactions of contemporaries, as spurious as theTrojan genealogies, but no less effective.There was, of course, nothing peculiarly Englishabout these attempts to establish a direct linkbetween contemporary society and the vanished"},{"pageNumber":856,"pageContent":"past. The claim to Trojan ancestry had been madeby the Romans, the French and others. ‘Most of thecivilized nations of [the] earth,’ wrote Sir RobertFilmer, ‘labour to fetch their original from someone of the sons or nephews of Noah.’199 Ancientprophecies were widely dispersed throughoutEurope. The conquests of Gustavus Adolphus werejustiɹed by reference to a prediction about theEagle and the Lion of the North, said to be theprophecy of Paracelsus.200 In Spanish Americaprophecies circulating among the Indians preparedthe ground for Cromwell's invasion of the WestIndies.201 In Persia there was a prophecypromising success in the wars against the Turk.202Prophecies accompanied the outbreak of the revoltof the Catalans in 1640,203 just as they helped tojustify rebellions in England. They were auniversal feature of an essentially pre-politicalworld, that is to say, of one where innovation hasto be disguised as a return to the past, and wherethe fact of change is essentially unrecognized.But by the end of the seventeenth century theGalfridian-style prophecy was in decline. Theimmediate cause was the growing volume of"},{"pageNumber":857,"pageContent":"historical criticism which shattered the legends ofBrutus and Arthur and exposed the ancientprophecies for the ɹctions they were. There hadalways been a substantial minority of critics whoregarded Geoʃrey of Monmouth's history withsuspicion, and Merlin's prophecies in particularhad been handled with caution. ‘Divers men holdopinion that there was no such Arthur,’ remarkedCaxton in 1485. Polydore Vergil's refutation of theBrutus legend in the early sixteenth century wasbut the culmination of a tradition of scepticismwhich went back nearly 400 years.204 Even so, hisiconoclasm raised a howl of nationalist protest,which encouraged Bale and Leland to resurrectArthur as a Protestant hero, at a time when theTrojan legend was being discredited by continentalscholars. As late as the eighteenth century somestout British nationalists stuck out in Geoʃrey ofMonmouth's defence. But by this time the tide ofinformed opinion had permanently turned againsthim.205 ‘Merlin's drunken prophecies’, as WilliamPerkins called them, were generally agreed to benot an ancient British survival but the invention ofGeoʃrey himself.

In 1648 a leadinghistorical textbook dismissed Merlin's prophecies as‘old wives’ tales', and by the eighteenth century‘Merlin’ was a joke among educated persons.206Historical criticism thus proved incompatiblewith the retention of primitive founding myths.Under the pressure of Catholic controversy the‘Protestantism’ of the Anglo-Saxons wilted away:Thomas Stapleton enumerated no fewer thanforty-six diʃerences between sixteenth-centuryProtestantism and the religion of Bede.207 Thecase for the antiquity of Parliament went the sameway.208 Even the ancient Britons were revealed asthe counterparts of the half-naked AmericanIndians – ‘an idolatrous nation and worshippers ofdevils’, as an M.P. remarked in 1606.209 On theContinent the sibylline prophecies were subjectedby Isaac Casaubon, G. J. Vossius and DavidBlondel to rigorous criticism which robbed them oftheir claim to have anticipated the coming ofChrist. The eʃect was to reduce faith in thepossibility of prophecy in general.210Inherent in the idea of ancient prophecy hadbeen the assumption that the sages of the past"},{"pageNumber":859,"pageContent":"could have been aware of present-day problems.

In the followingcentury John Aubrey pioneered the chronologicalstudy of the evolution of English medievalarchitecture.212 The period also saw thedevelopment of palaeography and allied means ofprecisely dating historical documents andidentifying forgeries.

The publication of ancientprophecies reached its peak during theInterregnum, even though the historical workwhich had undermined their intellectualrespectability had been carried out decades before.The paradox was that, like so much other occultmedieval learning, ancient prophecies were widelydisseminated at the very time when educated mencould no longer take them seriously.But it would be wrong to regard the decline ofthe belief in ancient prophecy as the mereconsequence of new historical techniques.

But this newhistorical criticism was itself a symptom of thechange as much as a cause. It required afavourable environment in which to emerge.

It was notoriously theexistence of gunpowder, the printing-press and themariner's compass which, with the shifting of theworld's features under the impact of thegeographical discoveries, did most to remind themen of the Renaissance that they could neverreally recapture the world of the Greeks andRomans. The change may have been assisted bythe craft idea of knowledge as cumulative, witheach pupil endeavouring to improve upon thetechnique taught him by his master.216 Printingcertainly did much to emphasise the diʃerencebetween the present and the past; for every bookhad a date of publication, and those whichsurvived stood as monuments to past assumptionsand ideas.

The meaning of witchcraftTHE activities of the cunning men who healedtheir clients and traced lost property have alreadybeen considered. It is now necessary to turn to thatkind of witchcraft which contemporaries thoughtharmful or anti-social. It cannot be clearlydistinguished from other sorts, since, as has beenseen, many clergy taught that magic, whatever its"},{"pageNumber":869,"pageContent":"objective, was reprehensible. At a popular levelevery kind of magical activity, including anyunacceptable brand of religion, might be lumpedtogether under the blanket title of ‘witchcraft’, andthere was no special term to indicate maleɹcentmagicians. ‘At this day’, wrote Reginald Scot in1584, ‘it is indiʃerent to say in the English tongue,“she is a witch” or “she is a wise woman”.’1Nevertheless, it is possible to isolate that kind of‘witchcraft’ which involved the employment (orpresumed employment) of some occult means ofdoing harm to other people in a way which wasgenerally disapproved of. In this sense the belief inwitchcraft can be deɹned as the attribution ofmisfortune to occult human agency. A witch was aperson of either sex (but more often female) whocould mysteriously injure other people. Thedamage she might do - maleficium, as it wastechnically called - could take various forms.Usually she was suspected of causing physicalinjury to other persons, or of bringing about theirdeath. She might also kill or injure farm animals orinterfere with nature by preventing cows fromgiving milk, or by frustrating such domesticoperations as making butter, cheese or beer. Therewas a wide range of other possible hostile actions,"},{"pageNumber":870,"pageContent":"but in England a witch's alleged activities ‘usuallycame under one of these heads. On the Continentwitches were also suspected of interfering with theweather and of frustrating sexual relationsbetween human beings, but in England both thesenotions were comparatively rare.2The manner in which the witch actuallyexercised this occult power was also believed tovary. Sometimes her evil inɻuence was conveyedthrough physical contact: the witch touched hervictim or gave out a potent, but invisible,emanation from her eyes. In this case he was saidto have been ‘fascinated’ or ‘overlooked’.Alternatively the witch pronounced a curse ormalediction which in due course took eʃect. Herethe victim was said to have been ‘forspoken’.Rather less common was the witchcraft whichinvolved technical aids – making a wax image ofthe victim and sticking pins in it, writing his nameon a piece of paper and then burning it, burying apiece of his clothing, and so forth.3 In general,contemporaries seem to have been less interestedin the mechanics of the operation than in the factof the witch's malice.The belief in the possibility of such happenings"},{"pageNumber":871,"pageContent":"was very old by the sixteenth century. On onelevel it was no more than the logicalcorollary of the equally widespread possibility inthe belief of beneɹcent magic. The ‘good’ witchwho helped a client to triumph over an opponentin law or love, or who cured him by transferringhis disease to another person, might well beregarded as a ‘bad’ one by the injured party.Generally speaking, the cunning folk and themaleɹcent witches were believed to be twoseparate species. But they did sometimes overlap,and there are many examples of village wizardsand charmers who found themselves accused ofmaleficent witchcraft.4Whether the magic was helpful or harmful,moreover, the belief in its possibility gained atemporary boost in the sixteenth and seventeenthcenturies from the same prevailing intellectualcurrent. The occult sympathies and vital spirits ofthe Neoplatonic universe could be exploited forevil purposes, no less than for good ones. Suchdoctrines could explain to the satisfaction ofintellectuals why dire consequences might followafter tampering with the wax image of a person orwith a piece of his clothing. One could harm a man"},{"pageNumber":872,"pageContent":"by manipulating his hair, his ɹngernail parings,his sweat or his excrement, all of which containedhis vital spirits. An excessive belief in the power ofthe imagination similarly made it plausible tothink that the object of a witch's imprecationswould soon afterwards be taken ill; and thesupposed reality of vital spirits and invisibleemanations justiɹed the idea that certain mencould involuntarily destroy their own cattle,simply by looking at them; a child in his cradlemight also succumb to such ‘fascination’. EvenAristotle taught that the glance of a menstruatingwoman would tarnish a mirror.5 Such theories alsomagniɹed the potential eɽcacy of secret herbal orchemical preparations; as in any primitive society,poison still retained magical associations.6But although Renaissance speculationsreinforced the belief of intellectuals in thepotentialities of maleɹcent magic, witch-beliefs ofthis kind were as old as human history, and in nosense peculiarly English, or even European. It wasonly in the late Middle Ages that a new elementwas added to the European concept of witchcraftwhich was to distinguish it from the witch-beliefsof other primitive peoples. This was the notion"},{"pageNumber":873,"pageContent":"that the witch owed her powers to having made adeliberate pact with the Devil. In return for herpromise of allegiance, she was thought to havebeen given the means of wreaking supernaturalvengeance upon her enemies. Seen from this newpoint of view, the essence of witchcraft was notthe damage it did to other persons, but its hereticalcharacter – devil-worship. Witchcraft had becomea Christian heresy, the greatest of all sins, becauseit involved the renunciation of God and deliberateadherence to his greatest enemy. Maleficium was apurely secondary activity, a by-product of thisfalse religion. Whether or not the witch injuredother people, she deserved to die for her disloyaltyto God. Around this conception was built up thenotion of ritual devil-worship, involving thesabbath or nocturnal meeting at which the witchesgathered to worship their master and to copulatewith him.The main agency responsible for theintroduction of this new concept was the RomanCatholic Church, whose intellectuals rapidly builtup a large literature of demonology, outlining themanner in which the witches or devil-worshipperswere thought to conduct themselves, and layingdown the procedure for their prosecution. The new"},{"pageNumber":874,"pageContent":"doctrine was developed in a series of edictsculminating in the Papal Bull, Summis desiderantesaffectibus, of Innocent VIII in 1484, and thecompendious treatise by two DominicanInquisitors, the Malleus Maleɹcarum (1486).Meanwhile the systematic persecution of witchesas devil-worshippers, rather than for their acts ofmalevolence, had been steadily proceeding on theContinent since the early fourteenth century. Theorigins of this new notion of witch-craft havenever been fully uncovered, although they areusually thought to lie in the Church's reaction tothe Manichaean (and by implication devil-worshipping) tendencies of the heretical Catharsand their successors.7The stages by which this new doctrine reachedEngland are extremely diɽcult to chart, and arenot yet clearly established. In itself, the idea of acompact with the Devil was as old as Christianity.Pagans had been regarded as devil-worshippers,and the legend of Theophilus, the monk whotransferred his allegiance to Satan, was familiar tothe late Anglo-Saxons.8 It was a commonplace ofmedieval theology to assert that any magicalactivity, however beneɹcent in intention,"},{"pageNumber":875,"pageContent":"necessarily involved a tacit compact with theDevil, and should therefore be punished. Thechurch courts often treated crystal-gazing andsimilar activities as a kind of heresy.9 But therewas a great deal of diʃerence between this idea ofa tacit compact implicit in an individual's magicaldabblings and the myth of explicit covenants withSatan made by bands of self-conscious devil-worshippers. It is true that there were plenty ofmedieval stories about men who made sacriɹces tothe Devil and of women who succumbed to theembraces of a demon lover. Tales also circulatedabout mysterious nocturnal revels. In 1303 themoralist Robert of Brunne issued warnings againstoʃering sacriɹces to the Devil by witchcraft, whilein the early ɹfteenth century Dives and Paupercould assert that witches and other magicianssought out the fiend to ‘make him their god’.10 Thedemonological treatises by continental writerswere only an extension of ideas latent in earlymedieval Christian theology, and there was, inprinciple, no reason why England should haveoʃered less fertile soil for their reception thananywhere else in the Christian world.Nevertheless, medieval England does seem to have"},{"pageNumber":876,"pageContent":"been largely isolated from the intellectual andjudicial trends which encouraged witch persecutionon the Continent. For this the substantialindependence of the English Church seems to havebeen largely responsible. England had noInquisition and no Roman Law; and Papalauthority in England was much reduced. The Bullof 1484 related only to Germany, while theMalleus Maleɹcarum was slow to impinge uponEngland. It found its way into the libraries of thelearned, for English intellectuals were used tobuying and reading the publications of foreignpresses; but the total absence of an English editionis striking by the side of the thirteen editions onthe Continent by 1520. There was no Englishtranslation of the Malleus until modern times; bycontrast it was issued sixteen times in Germanybefore 1700 and eleven times in France.11Paradoxically, it was left to the stronglyProtestant writers of the later Elizabethan periodto convey to English readers the contents of thisgreat monument of medieval Catholicism and itsnumerous imitators and successors. When, in 1584,Reginald Scot refuted the possibility of a diabolicalcompact in his Discoverie of Witchcraft, his"},{"pageNumber":877,"pageContent":"adversaries were still all continental writers,though some of them had begun to appear inEnglish translation. But in the following decadescontinental concepts of witchcraft were widelydisseminated, mostly by clergymen, in a series oftreatises by such authors as Henry Holland (1590),King James VI (1597), William Perkins (1608),Alexander Roberts (1616), Thomas Cooper (1619)and Richard Bernard (1627).12 Perkins admirablyillustrated the change in intellectual opinion whenhe said that, as far as he could see, there was nodiʃerence whatsoever between the practices ofEnglish witches and those of France, Spain, Italyor Germany. In his view the covenant with Satanwas the essence of witchcraft, and he urged theexecution of all witches without exception, notbecause of any acts of damage they might havecommitted but because ‘they depend on him astheir god’.13 Sir Edward Coke similarly deɹned awitch as ‘a person that hath conference with theDevil to consult with him or to do some act’.14 InThomas Wilson's Complete Christian Dictionary(1612), a ‘witch’ was said to be ‘one that exercisethdevilish and wicked arts, such as be named inDeut. 18.10, Ex. 22.18’. But in the supplement to"},{"pageNumber":878,"pageContent":"the sixth edition (1655) the deɹnition was revised,to become ‘anyone that hath any dealings with theDevil by any compact or confederacy whatsoever’.This wording derived from the semi-oɽcialcommentary on the Scriptures put out by divinesfrom the Westminster Assembly, at the end of theCivil War. In it they explained, ‘Some havethought witches should not die unless they hadtaken away the life of mankind, but they aremistaken... Though no hurt ensue in this contractat all, the witch deserves present and certain deathfor the contract itself.’ In 1651 Thomas Hobbessaid of witches that their trade was ‘nearer to anew religion than to a craft or science’.15Many English intellectuals and theologians werethus converted more or less totally to thecontinental conception of witchcraft. An evenwider public was acquainted with the occasionaltranslations of continental demonologists16 andthe frequent published accounts of Europeanwitch-trials.17 These writings undoubtedlyinɻuenced English ideas on witchcraft; indeed onseveral occasions they directly aʃected theoutcome of particular allegations. Robert Boyleconfessed that his sceptical inclinations were much"},{"pageNumber":879,"pageContent":"checked after he had talked to Perreaud, theProtestant pastor of Macon, author of a tract onThe Devill of Mascon, while Sir Thomas Browne'scitation of a parallel case in Denmark turned thescale against the accused in the trial of RoseCullender and Amy Dury at Bury St Edmunds in1665.18Yet the inɻuence of these new ideas upon thepeople at large was only partial. Even on theContinent, the idea of witchcraft as devil-worship,rather than maleficium, was slow to triumph. ThePapal Bull of 1484 did not mention the sabbath,but stressed the damage which witches could do; inmany parts of Germany evidence of maleficiumwas needed to secure a witch's condemnation untilthe later sixteenth century.19 In England, wheremost demonological treatises remained locked upin Latin or some other alien language, witchcraftfor most men was still an activity – doing harm toothers by supernatural means – not a belief or aheresy. This can be seen in the wording of the Actsof Parliament which ɹrst made witchcraft astatutory oʃence. There were three of these Acts –1542 (repealed 1547), 1563 (repealed 1604), and1604 (repealed in 1736).20 What is striking is that"},{"pageNumber":880,"pageContent":"no reference to a diabolical compact was made ineither of the ɹrst two. In 1542 it was made afelony (and therefore a capital oʃence) to conjurespirits or to practise witchcraft, enchantment orsorcery, in order to ɹnd treasure; to waste ordestroy a person's body, limbs, or goods; toprovoke to unlawful love; to declare what hadhappened to stolen goods; or ‘for any otherunlawful intent or purpose’. Despite someambiguity of wording (was conjuring an oʃence initself or only if performed for an unlawfulpurpose?), this Act clearly treated the crime ofwitchcraft as consisting in positive acts of hostilityto the community, rather than in relations with theDevil as such. The only possible exception to thisrule was the ban on magic to ɹnd lost goods, andfor that the explanation may well be that themakers of the Act regarded the practice asfraudulent.The second witchcraft statute, passed in 1563after the failure of an earlier bill in 1559, also laidits emphasis upon the maleɹcent nature of thewitch's activities. It was more severe than itspredecessor, in that it made it a felony to invokeevil spirits for any purpose whatsoever, whethermaleficium was involved or not. But it was also"},{"pageNumber":881,"pageContent":"more lenient, in that witchcraft, enchantment,charming and sorcery were deemed capitalfelonies only if they actually resulted in the deathof a human victim. Should the attempt proveunsuccessful, or if the victim was only maimed, orif only animals were killed, the witch was to incurthe milder penalty of a year's imprisonment, withquarterly appearances in the pillory. After asecond oʃence, however, the action became afelony. A reduced penalty was also prescribed formagic designed to ɹnd treasure and lost goods, orto provoke to unlawful love; on the secondoʃence, this did not become felony, but waspunished by life imprisonment and forfeiture ofgoods. Here again, therefore, the gravity of theoʃence depended upon the degree of the injurysuʃered by the witch's victims, not on anypostulated covenant (save in the case of deliberateinvocation of evil spirits). This leniency contrastedsharply with the attitude of those theologians whowould have liked to see all magicians, black orwhite, consigned to speedy execution.Only in the third and ɹnal witchcraft statute of1604 did the full continental doctrine take eʃect.Like its Elizabethan predecessor, it asserted thefelonious nature of invocation of evil spirits, and"},{"pageNumber":882,"pageContent":"of the witchcraft which resulted in anyone's death.It furthermore declared it to be felony if the victimwas only injured; and it replaced lifeimprisonment by death as the penalty for a secondoʃence in the case of lesser kinds of magic,involving treasure, lost goods, unlawful love,destroying cattle or goods, and attemptingunsuccessfully to kill a person. The real novelty,however, came in those sections of the Act which,for the ɹrst time in English history, made it afelony to take up a dead body in whole or part formagical purposes, and, even more striking, to‘consult, covenant with, entertain, employ, feed,or reward any evil and wicked spirit to or for anyintent or purpose’. In this latter clause theinɻuence of the continental doctrine of thediabolical compact was unambiguous, though, byspeciɹcally banning evil spirits, the Act still left aloophole for those magicians who believed that thespirits with which they dealt were good ones.Moreover, the clauses imposing a lighter penaltyfor less harmful types of magic made it clear thateven the legislators of 1604 did not subscribe tothe continental notion that a diabolical compactwas implicit in every act of witchcraft. Otherwiseit would have been pointless for them to draw"},{"pageNumber":883,"pageContent":"distinctions between degrees of magic, since allwould have been equally reprehensible. As it was,the Act implied that it might be possible, say, todestroy a neighbour's cattle by magical meanswithout necessarily having made any diabolicalcovenant. This was a position which no educatedtheologian would have accepted.21The 1604 statute remained law until 1736, whenwitchcraft ceased to be a statutory oʃence. Itnever satisɹed the zealots, who would like to haveimposed the death penalty for any type of magicalactivity whatsoever. But it represented the furthestpoint to which the English law on witchcraft wasadapted to ɹt continental doctrines. For it meantthat evidence of relationship with evil spirits oranimal familiars was technically suɽcient tosecure the judicial condemnation of an accusedperson, regardless of whether or not he or she hadharmed anyone.22 Even so, the evidence of thestatute-book, taken as a whole, suggests that inEngland witchcraft was prosecuted primarily as ananti-social crime, rather than as a heresy.This impression is conɹrmed by the records ofthe trials. In practice, most prosecutions wereprovoked by alleged acts of damage against other"},{"pageNumber":884,"pageContent":"persons and seldom drew on allegations of devil-worship. The relatively few cases of secularprosecution for harmful magic which havesurvived from the Middle Ages usually sprangdirectly from acts of malevolence which thewitches were thought to have planned or executed.For the most part they were cases of sorceryarising out of political intrigue, in which theaccused persons were said to have practisedwitchcraft to murder their political rivals or togain the favour of the powerful. Suits were alsobrought in the ecclesiastical courts against humblerfolk for using magic to kill or injure others, or tohinder their daily activities. Such practices werecertainly thought to have diabolical overtones, andan accused person might well defend himself byprotesting his Christian orthodoxy. But charges ofdeliberate devil-worship are very rare; indeed theonly three such allegations which survive, all fromthe early fourteenth century, were special cases.23In the fourteenth and ɹfteenth centuries variouspersons were said to have transferred theirallegiance to the Devil, but these allegations ofheresy were not thought by contemporaries tohave anything to do with witchcraft.24"},{"pageNumber":885,"pageContent":"Conversely, a charge of magic in the church courtshardly ever involved the corollary accusation ofdevil-worship.25 In so far as witchcraft wasprosecuted in later medieval England it wasbecause it was thought to involve harm to others,not because it was seen as a Christian heresy.This situation was not changed by the sixteenth-century statutes, for the run-of-the-mill Elizabethanprosecution for witchcraft was still concerned withmaleficium, not with evil spirits.

Nothing approaching a sabbath is tobe found in the trial records before 1612, and thesubsequent references to such gatherings aresporadic and inconclusive.27 The sexual assaultsby incubus and succubus, so pronounced a themeof the Malleus and continental witch-beliefs, arealso much less commonly encountered inEngland.28 The notion that witches could ɻy orchange themselves into animals was even moreseldom advanced,29 and the broomstick, madefamous by subsequent children's ɹction, occursonly once in an English witch-trial.30"},{"pageNumber":887,"pageContent":"The one common feature of English witch-trialswhich does indicate some sort of association in thepopular mind between maleɹcent magic and theDevil was the notion that the witch bore on herbody the mark of her profession in the form of aspot or excrescence, which could be discovered bysearching her for an ‘unnatural’ mark, usuallyrecognisable because it would not bleed whenpricked and was insensible to pain. As early as1579 this was stated to be ‘a common token toknow all witches by’. Thereafter it was a relativelycommon procedure to search the suspect's body forany likely-looking protuberance, which would thenbe pricked to see whether it hurt.31 An associatedbelief was the peculiarly English notion that thewitch was likely to possess a familiar imp or devil,who would take the shape of an animal, usually acat or a dog, but possibly a toad, a rat, or even awasp or butterɻy. This familiar, who performeduseful magical services for his mistress, wassupposed to have been given by the Devil himself,or purchased or inherited from another witch. Thewitch's mark was sometimes thought of as a teatfrom which the familiar could suck the witch'sblood as a form of nourishment.

They made theirappearance in Essex trials in 1566, 1579 and 1582;indeed a striking instance of the clear associationin the popular mind between witchcraft and thepresence of a toad in the suspect's house occurredin an ecclesiastical case in Somerset as early as1530.32Nevertheless, familiars and devils were very farfrom being an indispensable feature of Englishwitch-trials, even in the seventeenth century.Neither were they a necessary element in thenumerous informal accusations of witchcraft ofwhich we have record because they led, not to awitch-trial, but to a suit for defamation brought, inan ecclesiastical or common law court, by the"},{"pageNumber":889,"pageContent":"aggrieved person against whom the charge ofwitchcraft had been ɻung. In the formal witch-trials conducted by judges and lawyers, who wereeducated men, familiar with continental doctrines,it was possible for the theological notion ofwitchcraft as a devil-worshipping heresy to overliethe simpler popular belief from which the case hadoriginally sprung. The defamation cases bycontrast were more spontaneous and less easilymanipulated by the lawyers. They provideoverwhelming conɹrmation for the view that formost contemporaries the essence of witchcraft wasnot its aɽliation with the Devil, but its power toinɻict damage by occult means, acquired orinherited, upon lives, bodies and property. Thenumerous suits surviving in diocesan archives, aswell as in the records of the civil courts, makefrequent reference to such occurrences asfascination by the eyes, image magic, andmaledictions followed by evil results. But theyhardly ever involve allegations of relations withthe Devil, and only very seldom do they refer towitch's marks or familiar spirits.

Of the more than 200 persons whoare known to have been convicted under thewitchcraft statutes on the Home Circuit (Essex,Hertfordshire, Kent, Surrey and Sussex) between1558 and 1736, there were, if we except theprosecutions initiated in 1645 by MatthewHopkins, only seven (or possibly eight) who werenot found guilty of having inɻicted acts of damageupon their neighbours or their goods.

For other circuits therecords are too incomplete to be employed forstatistical purposes, but convictions for devil-worship unassociated with maleficium appear tohave been proportionately as rare.It seems, therefore, that although the Acts of1542 and 1563 imposed the death penalty forcertain kinds of conjuration, and that of 1604 didso for making a diabolical pact, or for entertainingand feeding evil spirits, it was relatively unusualfor such charges to be made, or for them toproduce a capital conviction, unless accompaniedby positive evidence of maleficium. Under theElizabethan statute, said a commentator, personswere executed ‘rather as murderers than aswitches’, and even after the Jacobean Act,contemporary judges, as Sir Robert Filmerremarked, were unlikely to condemn, unlessmurder was involved.36 The only notableexception to this practice was during Hopkins'scampaign. Between 1645 and 1647 some 200persons may have been convicted in the easterncounties under his inɻuence, many of them for"},{"pageNumber":892,"pageContent":"alleged compact. But even during these highlyexceptional years, evidence of maleficium wasfrequently invoked, in all probability much morefrequently than the mere indictments suggest.37The narrow theological deɹnition of witchcraft,as the power arising from a contract with theDevil, thus never triumphed completely inEngland, even during the later sixteenth and earlyseventeenth centuries, when the continentalconcept was disseminated in many vernaculartreatises and reports of leading trials, publishedwith the deliberate intention of stimulating moreprosecutions. Continental doctrines however,aʃected the conduct of many trials and colouredmany extracted ‘confessions’. This was only to beexpected in view of the recommendations inRichard Bernard's Guide to Grand-jurymen that agodly divine, ‘somewhat well read in thediscoveries of witchcraft and impieties thereof’,should be assigned ‘to be instructing thesuspected’, so that she might be ‘haply preparedfor confession’. When an allegation of maleficiumreached the courts it could easily turn into one ofdevil-worship, if it fell into the hands of interestedlawyers or clergy. Moreover, on technical grounds"},{"pageNumber":893,"pageContent":"it was easier to make a convincing case for theprosecution if one could produce a clear confessionof compact. Maleficium was always harder toprove.38Yet despite the increasing bias of the courts infavour of treating cases along continental lines,the popular concept of witchcraft was neversuccessfully restricted to the notion of devil-worship, and it was not the fear of heresy whichanimated accusations at the village level. For mostmen ‘witchcraft’ remained essentially the power todo harm to others. When in 1588 a group of EssexPuritan ministers discussed the question ofwitchcraft, they agreed ‘that there must be someunusual experience of evil eʃects to ensue of theirdispleasure, and some presumption of the death ofman or beast’. As a later writer observed, ‘Incommon account none are reputed to be witches,but only such who are thought to have both willand skill to hurt man and beast.’39 Such adeɹnition excluded the white witches or cunningmen, who attempted to heal the sick or ɹnd lostgoods; it also omitted those who conjured spirits inan attempt to gain wealth or knowledge.

For, as theEssex minister George Giʃord stressed in 1587, thepeople's hatred of witches was not a form ofreligious intolerance; it sprang from fear of theirhostile acts towards their neighbours, not fromoutrage at their supposed association with theDevil.402. The chronology of witch-beliefsSixteenth-and seventeenth-century England thusknew not one concept of witchcraft but two. Ontop of the popular belief in the power ofmaleɹcent magic was imposed the theologicalnotion that the essence of witchcraft wasadherence to the Devil. These two ideas were to befound side by side, sometimes apart, sometimesintermingled. But it was the fear of maleficiumwhich underlay most of the accusations and trials.How extensive was the belief in the possibility ofsuch occult malevolence? This question isimpossible to answer for there is no satisfactory"},{"pageNumber":895,"pageContent":"method of quantifying past beliefs. It is notenough to calculate the total number of witch-trials, because many informal allegations failed toproduce a formal prosecution and have thereforeleft no record. The case-books of contemporarydoctors reveal how common it could be forpatients to convince themselves that they had beenbewitched. There are over 120 cases of suspectedwitchcraft in Richard Napier's case-books (1600–34) and over 50 in those of William Lilly (1644–66).41 So as far as is known, none of these led to ajudicial hearing, and it is only the chance survivalof the case-books which enables us to know aboutthem at all. We can only speculate as to why onecase was taken up in the courts while anotherremained a matter of village gossip. No doubt theattitude of the local gentry, clergy and villageoɽcials was important. But there is no way ofdetermining the ratio of formal prosecutions toinformal allegations. Legal proceedings for witch-craft, in other words, represent the tip of aniceberg of unascertainable dimensions. Even thetip itself is largely concealed from our view, forthe survival of legal records has been so patchy asto provide an uncertain basis for generalization.Firm statistics for the extent of witchcraft"},{"pageNumber":896,"pageContent":"prosecution are out of the question, and thehistorian has to content himself with a reasonableguess.As we have seen, the statutes against witchcraftwere in operation between 1542 and 1547, andagain between 1563 and 1736. Virtually nothing isknown about prosecutions during the ɹrst of theseperiods.42 For the second, and much longer,phase, it is possible to make a tentative estimateon the basis of the assize and quarter sessionrecords which have survived. An analysis of thetrials on the Home Assize Circuit, for whichseventy-seven per cent of the relevant documentsare extant, discloses that between 1559 and 1736there were 513 persons accused under thewitchcraft statutes, of whom just over 200 wereconvicted and 109 hanged.43 There were ɹveother assize circuits in the country as well as alarge number of independent jurisdictions, so theseɹgures must be multiplied considerably if totalɹgures for the whole country are to be inferred. C.L'Estrange Ewen, to whose pioneeringinvestigations all students are permanentlyindebted, guessed the total number of executionsfor witchcraft throughout the period to be"},{"pageNumber":897,"pageContent":"something under 1,000.44 It is diɽcult to suggestan alternative ɹgure. Other cases can be added tothose discovered by Ewen, but, even so, his wasprobably an outside estimate, though allowancemust be made for the many persons who died inprison before or after their trial. In Essex therewere twenty-four such deaths between 1560 and1603. By continental standards, however, theEnglish ɹgure is not high, though the lack ofstatistical work upon European judicial recordsmeans that there is at present no reliable estimatewith which to compare it.45 It is alsoproportionately lower than the correspondingɹgure for Scotland, where diʃerent legalprocedures prevailed.46 Nevertheless, the volumeof prosecution is large enough to call for someexplanation. It greatly exceeded the parallelprosecution of Catholic clergy, for the totalnumber of English Catholic martyrs, lay andclerical, executed during the period was only264.47 It could also form a substantial part of thetotal criminal jurisdiction of the day. At the EssexAssizes in the 1580s, a peak period, witchcraftcases formed thirteen per cent of all the criminalbusiness. In the same county over half the villages"},{"pageNumber":898,"pageContent":"were involved in prosecutions at one time oranother.48The number of witch-trials ɻuctuated from onedecade to another and varied in diʃerent parts ofthe country. For reasons which have never beenexplained, Essex was particularly subject to suchprosecutions, its indictments on the Home Circuitoutnumbering those from the four counties ofHertfordshire, Kent, Surrey and Sussex combined.But the uneven survival of records makes itimpossible to draw a satisfactory map indicatingthe regional distribution of the trials, and nocounty was free of them. The most acute periodwas 1645–7, when the campaign led by MatthewHopkins and his associates resulted in theexecution of several hundred witches in Essex,Suʃolk, Norfolk and neighbouring counties. Therewere other notable trials, in Essex in 1582(involving fourteen persons), and in Lancashire in1612 (twenty-one persons) and 1633 (twenty).Such causes célèbres attracted great attention at thetime, for contemporaries, like some modernhistorians, were dependent for their knowledge ofthe subject upon the chance appearance of apamphlet account of a notable trial, and"},{"pageNumber":899,"pageContent":"unacquainted with the routine prosecutiondisclosed by the assize records. It would be wrongto think of witchcraft prosecution as a matter ofperiodic ‘scares’. For the most part the story is ofsteady and unspectacular annual prosecution. Onthe Home Circuit the trials were at their zenithduring the reign of Elizabeth I, when 455 out ofthe 790 known indictments were made, themajority during the 1580s and 1590s. It isprobable indeed that there were more trialseverywhere under Elizabeth than during the wholeof the subsequent century. From about 1620 thenumber of trials on the Home Circuit fell oʃsharply, to rise spectacularly during the Hopkinsperiod and then to dwindle to a mere trickle forthe rest of the century. Elsewhere, for example onthe Western Circuit, trials continued at a high rateduring the reign of Charles II.The percentage of trials which ended in theaccused's conviction also varied at diʃerentperiods. It seems to have been particularly high onthe Home Circuit at the turn of the sixteenthcentury (forty-one per cent), and again in theHopkins period (forty-two per cent). By the reignof Charles II it was low everywhere. On theWestern Circuit between 1670 and 1707, for"},{"pageNumber":900,"pageContent":"example, there were ɹfty persons tried forwitchcraft (two of them twice), but of these onlysix were executed, and a seventh condemned butreprieved. In Essex the ratio of acquittals soared asearly as 1620, and there were no executions after1626, save under Hopkins's inɻuence in 1645. Ofthe 291 persons accused in the county over thewhole period, 151 were acquitted. This may becompared with the acquittal rate in France, whichwas sometimes as low as ɹve per cent.49 The lastperson hanged for witchcraft in England was AliceMolland at Exeter in 1685; the last to becondemned, but subsequently reprieved, JaneWenham at Hertford in 1712. In 1717 at Leicesterthe last recorded witch-trial in an English civilcourt took place, when the jury rejected thecharge, supported though it was by no fewer thantwenty-ɹve witnesses. Finally in 1736 thelegislature repealed the 1604 Act, and replaced itby a measure which prohibited accusations ofwitchcraft or sorcery as such, but imposed apenalty of a year's imprisonment, plus quarterlyappearance in the pillory, for those whofraudulently claimed to be able to use magic, tellfortunes, or ɹnd lost goods. In the eyes ofParliament witchcraft had thus ceased to be a"},{"pageNumber":901,"pageContent":"terrifying reality; it was now deemed to be justanother case of vulgar fraud. In fact the old Acthad been a virtual dead letter for the previoustwenty years, and the statutory charge was wellbehind the alteration in educated opinion.50As a barometer of the rise and fall of witch-beliefs, however, the record of the witch-trials isinadequate. What it primarily reɻects is theattitude of the educated classes: the lawyers whoconducted the hearing; the clergyman whointerrogated the prisoners; ‘the most suɽcientfreeholders in the county’ who constituted theGrand Jury which examined the presentmentsfrom the quarter sessions; and the trial jury itself,composed of men of humbler quality, who werenevertheless required by an act of Charles II's reignto be worth at least twenty pounds per annum infreehold land and rent.51 During the seventeenthcentury such persons grew sceptical, if not ofwitch-craft, then at least of the possibility ofsatisfactorily proving that it had occurred. In 1692,for example, the Grand Jury of the Surrey QuarterSessions was solemnly warned that althoughwitchcraft was a great crime, ‘it is so hard a matterto have full proof brought of it, that no jury can be"},{"pageNumber":902,"pageContent":"too cautious and tender in a prosecution of thisnature’.52 As a result of this increasingly criticalattitude the number of successful prosecutionsdeclined, even though the laws remained in force.An examination of the roots of this scepticismmust be postponed to a later chapter.53Meanwhile it should be remembered that to someextent it had always been there. Nearly everyoneagreed that at least some witches were unjustlyaccused, and that others were victims of their owndelusions. Throughout the period damages wereawarded for assault, defamation and false arrest inconnection with witch-craft accusations, andduring the later seventeenth century men weresuccessfully prosecuted for molesting innocentpersons.54But the change of opinion among the educatedclasses was not immediately reɻected among thepeople at large. Once it had become almostimpossible to get a conviction in the courts it wasonly a matter of time before the statute wasrepealed. But informal accusations continued to bemade. Even when the laws were in force there hadbeen cases where a community ignored the normalmachinery of prosecution and took the law into its"},{"pageNumber":903,"pageContent":"own hand, by maltreating or forcibly ‘swimimng’ awitch, sometimes bringing about her death in theprocess. Violence of this kind had occurred, forexample, in 1665, 1691, 1694, 1699, 1700, 1701,1704, 1709, 1717, 1730, and 1735.55 Despite thereadiness of the courts to treat any resultingdeaths as cases of murder, these episodescontinued after the lapse of the Witchcraft Act in1736, and the lynching of alleged witchesremained a sporadic feature of English rural lifeuntil the later nineteenth century.56The shift in educated opinion explains whywitchcraft accusations were not receivedsympathetically by the law courts after the laterseventeenth century. But how is one to account forthe concentration of active witch-prosecutionwithin so short a period? Nearly all the executionsfor witchcraft in England took place during thesecond half of the sixteenth century and the ɹrstthree-quarters of the seventeenth. Yet witch-beliefsas such had existed long before this time. It wasaccepted in the Middle Ages that there wereindividuals capable of performing acts ofmaleficium by occult means, just as there wereothers who used their magic for beneɹcent"},{"pageNumber":904,"pageContent":"purposes. With the exception of the sabbath andthe diabolical compact, there was no item ofsubsequent English witch-beliefs which was notdeeply entrenched in the popular imagination longbefore 1500.57 Yet until the sixteenth centurythese occult powers do not seem to have provokedthe same concern and indignation. Some medievallawyers held that sorcerers should be burned alive,a penalty for which the Roman Law provided arespectable ancestry.58 But, in practice, it seemsto have been very rare in England for anythingother than a trivial punishment to have beeninɻicted upon those accused of maleɹcent magicbefore 1500. Until the surviving medieval judicialrecords have been thoroughly sifted it would bewrong to prejudge the issue. But at present, for thewhole period between the Norman Conquest andthe Reformation, there are not more than half adozen known cases of supposed witches beingexecuted; and most of these had been involved inplots against the monarch or his friends.59Nor were the allegations made against medievalwitches on a par with those levied during theseventeenth century. In the later period it wasquite common for multiple acts of damage to be"},{"pageNumber":905,"pageContent":"attributed to the machinations of one individual.Thus, to take some random instances, ElizabethPeacock was accused of killing four persons,laming another, and bringing about the death ofeight geldings and seven mares; Philippa Gewenwas said to have lamed three persons by herwitchcraft and killed a fourth; Martha Rylens wascharged with murdering no fewer than ɹvevictims. These three cases all come from therecords of the Western Assize Circuit between 1670and 1675.60 The total number of deaths formallyattributed to witch-craft during the sixteenth andseventeenth centuries as a whole must have runinto thousands. In Essex alone witches wereformally charged with the deaths of 233 peopleand the illnesses of 108 others.61 By contrast, thetotal damage known to have been alleged as thework of witchcraft before 1500 can be summarizedas two or three deaths, a broken leg, a witheredarm, several destructive tempests and somebewitched genitals.62 Of course, considerableallowance must be made for the inadequatesurvival of medieval records, and even more forthe fact that most of them have yet to be properlysearched. Many cases of medieval sorcery"},{"pageNumber":906,"pageContent":"doubtless await discovery. But it is noticeable thatin those cases which have so far come to light theusual charge is that witchcraft was attempted, notthat it was successful.The literary evidence also suggests that in thesixteenth century contemporaries felt that thewitch problem had assumed new propor-tions.Bishop Jewel asserted in 1559 that during theprevious reign ‘the number of witches andsorcerers had everywhere become enormous... Thiskind of people... within these few last years aremarvellously increased.’63 ‘The land is full ofwitches,’ declared Lord Chief Justice Anderson in1602, ‘They abound in all places.’ Without speedypreventive action, they would ‘in short timeoverrun the whole land’.64 A witch, thoughtBishop Hall in 1650, used to be a rarity. ‘Nowhundreds are discovered in one shire; and if famedeceive us not, in a village of fourteen houses inthe North parts are found so many of this damnedbreed.’ At the time of Matthew Hopkins's activities,a letter-writer thought that more witches had beenarraigned in England than at any time since theCreation. Even in 1654 a contemporary assumed itto be obvious that the volume of sorcery was still"},{"pageNumber":907,"pageContent":"increasing.65One way of explaining why the possibility ofwitchcraft seemed particularly menacing duringthe hundred and twenty or so years after theaccession of Elizabeth I is to emphasize that thiswas the very period when the two separateconcepts of witchcraft fused together to produce anew myth. The change can thus be attributed tothe superimposition of the theological concept ofwitchcraft upon the ancient belief in the possibilityo f maleficium. The idea of the witch as a devil-worshipper was a new import from the Continentwhich it is tempting to make the scapegoat for theunprecedented volume of persecution. In theMiddle Ages, it could be argued, the notion thatwitches were devil-worshippers had not yet takenroot; any malicious acts on their part weretherefore treated no diʃerently from thosecommitted by any other criminal. It was onlywhen continental ideas poured into sixteenth-century England, after the invention of printing,that witchcraft stood revealed as the greatest crimeof all. As soon as witches were seen as heretics andthe sworn enemies of God, a campaign waslaunched to root them out of the land. Hence the"},{"pageNumber":908,"pageContent":"subsequent trials and executions.The most inɻuential exponent of this argumenthas been Professor Rossell Hope Robbins. HisEncyclopedia of Witchcraft and Demonology (1959)was devoted to the thesis that the theologicalconcept of witchcraft was ‘never of the people’,but was imposed from above by the late medievalPapacy. The clerics and lawyers of the Inquisition,he argued, made a trade of their witch-hunting,and by employing torture and leading questions,extracted from their victims the confessions ofdevil-worship which they themselves had invented.The populace in general only came to accept thatwitch-craft was heresy ‘after decades of poundingin the new doctrine’. In essence the persecution ofwitches was the product of a cold-bloodedcampaign launched by self-interested clerics andinquisitors. It had no genuine social roots, but wasimposed from above.66Professor Robbins's interpretation is a valuablereminder that the witch-beliefs of our periodcontained an element for which no earlierprecedent is to be found, and he is right toemphasize that this new ingredient had no realpopular basis. But as an explanation of the"},{"pageNumber":909,"pageContent":"increased witch-prosecution in sixteenth- andseventeenth-century England, his argument willhardly do. It is not just that it does not explainwhy there should have been such a time-lagbetween the propagation of continental ideas, inthe fourteenth and ɹfteenth centuries, and thebeginning of English persecution, well over ahundred years later. The main diɽculty is that, aswe have already seen, the great bulk of witchcraftaccusations in England did not relate to anyalleged heretical activities upon the part of thewitch, but to her maleficium (or ‘sorcery’, asProfessor Robbins calls it to distinguish it from hisnarrower conception of ‘witchcraft’ proper). Thiswas the point at issue in the overwhelmingmajority of Elizabethan witch-trials. The covenantwith the Devil, which Professor Robbins describesas ‘the core of the witchcraft delusion’, did notformally become a crime in England until 1604, bywhich time at least half, and probably more, of thewitch-trials had already taken place. On the HomeCircuit well over half the executions occurredbefore the death of Elizabeth. Even after 1604 thediabolical pact was not usually the gravamen ofthe charge.On the Continent, moreover, there had been"},{"pageNumber":910,"pageContent":"ɹscal motives for witch-hunting, since the witch'sgoods might go to the lord, or the Inquisition, orthe oɽcials responsible for the trial.67 But inEngland no such incentive existed. The short-lived1542 Act ordered the forfeiture of the witch's goodsand lands, as by felony, but the two subsequentmeasures of 1563 and 1604 safeguarded the heir'sinheritance and the widow's dower, should theaccused person be executed. This did not alwayswork in practice, and if there was no heir theproperty would go to the manorial lord anyway.The goods of the three witches of Warboysexecuted in 1593, for example, were worth fortypounds and fell to Sir Henry Cromwell as lord ofthe manor. (He gave the money to the corporationof Huntingdon, who used it to ɹnance an annualsermon on witchcraft.) 68 The law also prescribedforfeiture of goods in those cases where the witchwas sentenced to life imprisonment. But inEngland prosecutions can scarcely ever have had aɹnancial motive. Most of the victims wereextremely poor. It is hard to see what theiraccusers could have gained by the prosecution.Only in a tiny minority of cases can even theglimmer of a ɹnancial motive be discerned.69 On"},{"pageNumber":911,"pageContent":"the Continent, says Professor Robbins, ‘witch-hunting was self-sustaining and became a majortrade’.70 But in England the truth was often thereverse. A witch-trial could sometimes be anexpensive aʃair for the community, as certainSuʃolk parishes found in 1645–6, when they hadto pay the fees of the witches’ gaolers because theaccused themselves were too poor to contribute.71Executioners and gaolers may have had a ɹnancialinterest in the proceedings, but no more so than inthe prosecution of any other crime.The only English prosecutions which wereobviously stimulated from above, in thecontinental manner, were the work of theprofessional witch-ɹnder, Matthew Hopkins, andhis associate John Stearne. Hopkins's campaignprobably brought him some personal proɹt,though both he and Stearne denied it.72 His twohundred or so victims also constituted a sizeableproportion of the total number of witches executedin England. But professional witch-ɹnders wereexceptional. One operated in Berwick andNewcastle in 1649–50 and there may have beenone or two others.73 But at a time when it wascustomary for professional promoters to initiate"},{"pageNumber":912,"pageContent":"prosecutions for every kind of oʃence theirrelative absence is notable. Local corporationsoccasionally ɹnanced prosecutions, and localclergy or gentry, inɻuenced by continental ideas,sometimes set out to extract confessions ofparticipation in diabolic witchcraft. But theevidence does not support the view that, theHopkins aʃair apart, many English witch-prosecutions were initiated from above.Moreover, even when they were, they could stillhave a genuinely popular basis. Witch-ɹndingcampaigns have been common in modern Africaand their leaders have not always been free fromprivate ɹscal motives. But they are only madepossible by people's readiness to believe thatwitches are the cause of all their troubles and thateverything will be well once they are rootedout.74 In England Hopkins's campaign does notseem to have had so all-embracing a protectivepurpose, but it nevertheless exploited alreadyexisting fears. Although Hopkins ran into someopposition, there is every reason to think thatwhat he did was to turn a higher proportion ofinformal popular allegations and suspicions intoactual prosecutions, twisting them from charges of"},{"pageNumber":913,"pageContent":"maleficium into allegations of devil-worship in theprocess. He was helped in this task by the delay inthe resumption of normal judicial machinery afterthe Civil War. The trial of Essex witches atChelmsford in July 1645 was conducted, not byjustices of assize, but by the J.P.s, presided over bythe Earl of Warwick, who had no clear judicialstatus. But it was the readiness of local people towitness against Hopkins's victims which made theepisode possible. In Essex alone ninety-twoindividuals came forward to help.75There is no reason, therefore, to think that thepersecution of witches in England originated in acampaign led by clerics and lawyers against theinstincts of ordinary people. Whatever the role ofjudges and inquisitors may have been on theContinent, it cannot be said that in England thejudiciary ever took much initiative in theprosecution of witches. It is true that some judgesdisplayed a marked desire to obtain a convictionat all costs; for example, Justice Winch andSerjeant Crewe, who incurred James I's displeasurefor condemning nine witches at Leicester in 1616on the most paltry evidence; or Justice Bromley,who in 1612 informed some of the acquitted"},{"pageNumber":914,"pageContent":"Lancashire witches that they were undoubtedly asguilty as those who had been condemned.76 It isalso true that the trials were sometimes conductedin what were recognizable, even at the time, asdisgraceful conditions. There was so much noise atthe arraignment of Mary Spencer in 1634 that shecould not hear the evidence brought against her;while the uproar at Anne Bodenham's trial in 1653was such that judge and prisoner could not heareach other.77 A few judges also seem to have beeneager for maximum publicity to be given to theconviction of accused witches. The inɻuentialpamphlet account of the witches of Warboys(1593) was commissioned by Justice Fenner, whileBrian Darcy, J.P., was probably himself the authorof the account of the witches of St Osyth, Essex(1582).78Nevertheless the judges as a class do not seem tohave been any more vindictive towards witchesthan the rest of their contemporaries. They had noresponsibility for initiating prosecutions in the firstplace; and it was from the bench that the initiativewas ɹnally taken to make the Witchcraft Actinoperative, long before it was repealed.

Lord Chief Justice North admittedto having condoned the conviction of threeinnocent women at Exeter in 1682, for fear thatclemency would only spark oʃ a new witch-hunting epidemic by way of reaction. As hisbrother Roger North recorded,It is seldom that a poor old wretch is brought totrial upon that account, but there is, at the heels ofher, a popular rage that does little less thandemand her to be put to death; and if a judge is soclear and open as to declare himself against thatimpious vulgar opinion, that the devil himself haspower to torment and kill innocent children, or"},{"pageNumber":917,"pageContent":"that he is pleased to divert himself with the goodpeople's cheese, butter, pigs, and geese, and thelike errors of the ignorant and foolish rabble, thecountrymen (the triers) cry, this judge hath noreligion, for he doth not believe witches.83The hatred of witches, therefore, was notobviously inculcated by the judges, and it wascertainly not sustained by them. Nor can it beconvincingly attributed to the new continentaldoctrines about devil-worshippers. It was thepopular fear of maleficium which provided thenormal driving-force behind witch prosecution, notany lawyer-led campaign from above. Whatawoke the indignation of the witch's enemies wasthe conviction that they were the victims of heracts of malice. Their children fell ill, their cattledied, their butter would not set. The witch was anobject of hatred to her neighbours. She wassubjected to informal acts of violence, and herconviction at the assizes usually had the fullsupport of the community from which the chargeoriginally emanated.The basic problem thus remains. Why, if popularwitch-beliefs were much the same as they had beenin the Middle Ages, was it only during the"},{"pageNumber":918,"pageContent":"sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that legalaction against witchcraft attained suchdimensions? To this question there are only twopossible answers. Either the demand for theprosecution of witches suddenly grew, or thefacilities for such prosecution had not previouslyexisted. Of these two solutions the second seemsmuch less plausible. It is true that it was only inthe sixteenth century that the invocation of spiritsbecame a statutory oʃence, but it is likely thatsome sort of machinery had always existed forprosecuting the authors of acts of maleficium. Thelegal situation is by no means clear, but it seemsthat a woman who killed a man by sorcery was inmedieval law as liable to prosecution as if she hadused a hatchet. If such cases were seldomencountered before the sixteenth century this wasnot because of the absence of statutes dealingspeciɹcally with witchcraft. The rudimentary stateof present knowledge concerning the operation ofthe criminal law in the later Middle Ages mustpreclude a deɹnitive judgement, but on theevidence at present available it may reasonably beassumed that the apparent paucity of medievalwitch-trials reɻects, not the lack of the necessarylegal machinery, but the absence of any marked"},{"pageNumber":919,"pageContent":"popular desire to take advantage of it.84For in the Middle Ages maleɹcent sorcererscould generally be hauled before King's Bench or alocal court, or made the object of speciallyappointed commissions or Council inquiries. Theycould also be denounced along with othermagicians before the ecclesiastical courts. Butalthough many wizards were cited before theecclesiastical authorities, it is striking that veryfew of them were charged with having committedacts of maleficium. The majority were charmersand crystal-gazers of the traditional kind. Theywere not maleɹcent witches at all. And althoughmagical activity was sometimes regarded asheresy,85 and therefore potentially punishable byburning, there is no clear example of a medievalwitch being condemned under the heresy laws.86Yet several medieval jurists declared that sorcerersshould be burned,87 and both contemporaries andlater authorities assumed they were.88 Themachinery was available, but there seems to havebeen no desire by either Church or people to takeadvantage of it. So long as the bulk of medievaljudicial records, both lay and ecclesiastical,"},{"pageNumber":920,"pageContent":"remains unprinted, it would be foolish to bedogmatic on this point, but all the signs are that asubstantial demand for witch-prosecution inmedieval England simply did not exist.For this reason it would be wrong to lay theresponsibility for the beginning of systematicpersecution upon the passage of the three witchstatutes. Much energy has been expended byhistorians in an attempt to identify the individualswho were responsible for drafting these measuresand pushing them through Parliament, althoughlittle progress in this matter has yet been made.Nothing is known for certain about the origins ofthe 1542 Act, while attempts to attribute thestatute of 1563 to the inɻuence of the Marianexiles have been demonstrably unsuccessful. BothActs may have been precipitated by politicalconspiracies in which magic was employed againstthe reigning monarch. The parliamentary historyof the 1604 Bill is better known, and a number ofprominent lawyers and ecclesiastics, includingsome who had been personally involved inprevious witch-cases, were on the variouscommittees to which the Bill was sent.89 It would,however, be quite erroneous to assume that, if"},{"pageNumber":921,"pageContent":"only the authors of the various bills could beidentified, then the origins of the witch-persecutionwould be laid bare. For there is no reason to thinkthat any of the legislation was particularlycontroversial, save the repeal in 1736, whichprovoked pamphlet protests and some slightparliamentary opposition.90 However initiated,the Acts could never have been passed without thegeneral support of both Houses of Parliament,who, on such a matter, fairly represented theopinion of educated contemporaries. In any casemost of the prosecutions could have been launchedwithout the Acts, for they related to allegedmaleficium, which seems always to have beenindictable. It was only for the less commonoʃences of conjuring, entertaining, pact-making,etc., or for ɹnding lost goods or treasure, that theActs provided totally new penalties. The most thatcan be said is that these statutes gave some addedpublicity to the idea of witchcraft, and that theirpresence on the statute book helped to sustain thebelief, particularly in later years when scepticismwas on the increase. It certainly made it diɽcultfor judges to be liberal. As Lord Chief Justice Northcomplained to the Secretary of State in 1682, ‘wecannot reprieve them without appearing to deny"},{"pageNumber":922,"pageContent":"the very being of witches, which... is contrary tolaw’.91Even when the courts ceased to entertain witch-trials, popular feeling against witches continued,as the periodic rural lynchings demonstrated. Suchfeeling was independent of the legal position,though witch statutes had been necessary beforeviolence directed against suspects could take legalform. Yet before the statutes evidence for popularfeeling against maleɹcent witches is sparse. Therewas plenty of informal violence in medievalsociety, but it seems to have been seldom directedagainst suspected witches.92 The ecclesiasticalcourts readily dealt with popular magic, but wererarely asked to investigate cases of blackwitchcraft. The common law provided facilities forthe prosecution of most kinds of maleficium, butthey were seldom invoked. Why was it only in the1560s that popular feeling against witches becameclearly expressed? It is not enough to say that theauthorities, under the inɻuence of continentalideas, felt it necessary to intervene against the oldcrime of witchcraft because it now appeared as anew and deadly heresy.93 For the prosecutionswhich ensued were primarily concerned with the"},{"pageNumber":923,"pageContent":"traditional, maleɹcent aspect of witchcraft, notwith the imputation of devil-worship. The reasonfor the new popular demand for witch-prosecutioncannot be found in the changing attitude of thelegislature and judiciary. It must be traced to achange in the opinion of the people themselves.Appendix A. The meaning of the term ‘witchcraft’Modern social anthropologists have drawn adistinction between ‘witchcraft’ and ‘sorcery’ alongthe following lines. Witchcraft is an innate quality,an involuntary personal trait, deriving from aphysiological peculiarity which can be discoveredby autopsy. The witch exercises his malevolentpower by occult means, and needs no words, rite,spell or potion. His is a purely psychic act.Sorcery, on the other hand, is the deliberateemployment of maleɹcent magic; it involves theuse of a spell or technical aid and it can beperformed by anyone who knows the correctformula. Witchcraft, on this deɹnition, is thus animpossible crime and not empirically observable,whereas sorcery really is practised in manyprimitive societies.94"},{"pageNumber":924,"pageContent":"This distinction arose out of the study of Azandewitchcraft, but it has been applied to othercontexts, even though its relevance to otherAfrican societies is nowadays much disputed.95 Upto a point it can be made to ɹt English conditions,since there were at least some contemporarywriters who perceived a diʃerence between ‘witch-craft’, which was an occult power given by theDevil, requiring no tools or spells, and ‘sorcery’,which involved the use of images, poisons, etc.Thus, one writer declared in 1653 that sorcery was‘a thing or mischief which is distinct fromwitchcraft, as thus, witch-craft being performed bythe devil's insinuation of himself with witches,...sorcery being performed by mere sophisticationand wicked abuse of nature in things of nature'sown production, by sympathy and antipathy’. Toexploit nature for a good purpose was legitimate;‘it is the evil of the end which is sorcery’. Thiscomes very close to the modern anthropologist'sdescription of sorcery as ‘that division ofdestructive magic that is socially disapproved ordeemed illegitimate’.96 Francis Bacon anticipatedit even more closely when he distinguishedwitchcraft from sorcery, by noting that a magical"},{"pageNumber":925,"pageContent":"technique, like tying knots to prevent theconsummation of a marriage, had ‘less aɽnitywith witchcraft, because not peculiar persons only(such as witches are), but anybody may do it’.97The English witch, like her Azande counterpart,was also sometimes believed to have physicalpeculiarities, in addition to the witch's mark. In1599, for example, a judge, Sir Richard Martin,said that he had heard that the hair of a witchcould not be cut off.98 Others asserted that a witchsitting in bright sunshine would leave noshadow99 and that witches could shed no tears.100The author of a pamphlet account of a trial atMaidstone in 1652 reported that some bystanderswanted the witches burned, ‘alleging that it was areceived opinion amongst many that, the body ofa witch being burnt, her blood is preventedthereby from becoming hereditary to her progenyin the same evil, which by hanging is not’.101 Theidea that witchcraft went in families and might behereditary was often put forward.102 But perhapsthe closest approximation to the Africanconception of completely involuntary witchcraftwas the belief in the existence of persons whose"},{"pageNumber":926,"pageContent":"eyes had a special power of fascination, like theman who accidentally killed his own cattle bylooking at them: one J.P. called such persons‘involuntary witches’.103 These ɹgures, however,were primarily creations of folklore and seldommade any appearance in the trials. Onecommentator declared thatthe bodies of aged persons are impure, which,when they wax cankered in malice, they use theirvery breath and their sight, being apt forcontagion, and by the Devil whetted for suchpurposes, to the vexation and destruction ofothers. For if they which are troubled with thedisease of the eyes called opthalmia do infect othersthat look earnestly upon them, is it any marvelthat these wicked creatures, having both bodiesand minds in a higher degree corrupted, shouldwork both these and greater mischiefs?104But this idea also seems to have hardly ever beeninvoked in the courts.In general, therefore, the anthropologicaldistinction between witchcraft and sorcery is of"},{"pageNumber":927,"pageContent":"limited utility when applied to England.105 It canbe said that the sorcerer used material objects,whereas the witch did not.106 But the presence orabsence of magical techniques does not seem tohave been of great concern to those who took partin the trials. It was the fact of the witch's malignitywhich interested them. The evidence for this mightcome from her use of image-magic, animalfamiliars, curses or other magical techniques, but itcould also be inferred from her social situation.She might wreak her malice by using techniques,which were observable, or by ill-wishing, whichwas not. But the two methods wereinterchangeable and there was no suggestion thatthey belonged to different species of offender.The historian cannot even say, with theanthropologist, that sorcerers existed, whereaswitches were imaginary. For some of those accusedof being witches really had tried to harm others bymere ill-wishing, unaccompanied by magicaltechniques. In intention, at least, witchcraft wasnot an impossible crime. In execution, it wasneither more nor less eʃective than most of themethods of the sorcerer. It is very probable that ahigher proportion of those accused of attempting"},{"pageNumber":928,"pageContent":"mental witchcraft were innocent than was the casewith those charged with using observable magicaltechniques. But this is essentially unprovable.What is clear is that the person charged withwitchcraft in sixteenth- and seventeenth-centuryEngland was never thought to have actedinvoluntarily. She was the victim of her evilthoughts, but not of any innate physicalpeculiarity.Appendix B. The legal status of witchcraft in Englandbefore 1563The practice of any kind of magic had always beenan ecclesiastical oʃence liable to prosecutionbefore the church courts. Cases of maleficium wereoccasionally dealt with in this way, both beforeand after 1563.107 Sometimes oʃenders werehanded over by the secular authorities to thebishops or to special ecclesiasticalcommissions.108 Indeed as late as 1558 the PrivyCouncil instructed the Bishop of London to proceedagainst certain conjurers ‘according to the order ofthe ecclesiastical laws’.109The diɽcult problem is to ascertain whether the"},{"pageNumber":929,"pageContent":"secular courts had independent jurisdiction overmaleɹcent sorcery before the passing of thewitchcraft statutes. Anglo-Saxon law-makers hadcertainly prescribed temporal punishments forwitchcraft, but subsequent medieval jurists aresilent on the subject.110 Legal writers, fromBritton in the thirteenth century to Fitzherbert inthe sixteenth, state that sorcery was one of theoʃences to be inquired into by the sheriʃ (severalregarding it as punishable by burning), but there islittle other evidence to suggest that the sheriʃ infact concerned himself with it.111 Appeals ofsorcery were rare before itinerant justices, anddoubt has been expressed as to whether it was aplea of the Crown at all.112 The early fourteenth-century Mirror of Justices suggested that maleɹcentmagic was a form of heresy which could beproceeded against in the King's court, but modernlegal historians have dismissed this view as‘nonsense’.113 In the seventeenth century mostlegal authorities assumed that witchcraft had beena purely ecclesiastical oʃence from the Conquestuntil the Tudor Acts against witchcraft, save thatafter 1401 burnings had been carried out by thesecular authorities under de haeretico"},{"pageNumber":930,"pageContent":"comburendo.114Modern scholars have found very few cases ofsorcery in the medieval records of lay courts.

In thiscase it was clearly implied that, if actual death hadresulted, the King's Bench could have treated it asa murder case and tried it in the usual way.121Similarly in 1371 a necromancer was dischargedby the King's Bench, after inquiries had failed toreveal any evidence that he had deceived orharmed the King's people.122Yet many contemporaries continued to ɹnd theprecise legal situation obscure.

His search in 1561 for medievalprecedents unearthed only the doubtful case of1371; as a result, the oʃenders with whom he wasconcerned were sent by the Privy Council to theKing's Bench, where they abjured, and wereexposed in the pillory.126 Since no maleficium(other than love magic) was involved in thisepisode, it remains uncertain whether Catlinthought that the common law could have beeninvoked if no physical damage had occurred.

But, if fraudwas involved, a secular prosecution might wellensue, and if treason, murder or physical injuryw e r e alleged, the oʃence was in practiceindictable.

The DevilIt is obvious that stories about diabolical compactscould never have gained circulation ifcontemporary religion had not lent its authority tobuttress the notion of a personal and immanentDevil. Relatively unimportant in the OldTestament, Satan had been raised by later Judaismand Christianity to the status of God's grandcosmic antagonist. He was an omnipresent force,ever ready to prey upon man's weaker instinctsand to tempt him away into paths of evil. He wasalso an instrument of God's judgement, for thesinners of this world constituted the members ofSatan's kingdom after their death. In Hell theywere subjected to undying torments over which hepresided. To help him in his task he had an armyof demons and evil spirits, as numerous andpervasive as the saints and angels of Christ. Hewas both one and many, for, as a seventeenth-"},{"pageNumber":936,"pageContent":"century writer explained, ‘The Devil is a name fora body politic, in which there are very diʃerentorders and degrees of spirits, and perhaps in asmuch variety of place and state, as amongourselves.’1 His powers were enormous, for he hadhimself once been one of God's angels and heknew all the secrets and mysteries of the naturalworld. To all but the strongest in faith heconstituted a ubiquitous and potentially irresistibleforce.Generations of medieval theologians haddeveloped an elaborate and sophisticateddemonology, which percolated down to ordinarymen in a cruder and more immediate form.Demons had no corporeal existence, but it wasnotorious that they could borrow or counterfeithuman shape. Medieval preachers enlivened theirsermons with terrifying stories of the Devil'srepeated appearances to tempt the weak and tocarry away desperate sinners. The horns, tail andbrimstone of the medieval stage, and the grotesquecreatures of church sculpture and wood-carving,helped to form the popular conception of Satanwhich has remained iconographically familiar untilthe present day.2 The immediacy of this diabolical"},{"pageNumber":937,"pageContent":"conception has, however, long disappeared. TheDevil who provoked high winds andthunderstorms, or who appeared dramatically tosnatch a poor sinner at his cups and ɻy oʃ withhim through the window, is diɽcult for us today totake seriously. But in the sixteenth century, whenall the forces of organized religion had beendeployed for centuries in formulating the notion ofa personal Satan, he had a reality and immediacywhich could not fail to grip the strongest mind.The Reformation did nothing to weaken thisconcept; indeed it almost certainly strengthened it.Protestantism was a response to a deep convictionof human sin, a sense of powerlessness in the faceof evil. Luther often spoke as if the whole world ofvisible reality and the ɻesh belonged to the Devil,the Lord of this world.3 In the long run it may bethat the Protestant emphasis on the singlesovereignty of God, as against the Catholicconcept of a graded hierarchy of spiritual powers,helped to dissolve the world of spirits by referringall supernatural acts to a single source. But if so itwas a slow development. For Englishmen of theReformation period the Devil was a greater realitythan ever – the ‘prince and God of this world’, as"},{"pageNumber":938,"pageContent":"John Knox called him.4 Inɻuential preachers ɹlledthe ears of their hearers with tales of diabolicintervention in daily life, recognizable as thecautionary exempla of the Middle Ages brought upto date. Hugh Latimer assured his audience thatthe Devil and his company of evil spirits wereinvisible in the air all around them. ‘I am not ableto tell how many thousand be here amongst us.’5Men thus became accustomed to Satan'simmediacy. In the Elizabethan Communion Servicethe priest was required to warn any evil livers inhis congregation not to come to the table, ‘lestafter taking of that holy sacrament the Devil enterinto you, as he entered unto Judas, and fill you fullof all iniquities, and bring you to destruction bothof body and soul’ – a symbolic warning whichmany must have taken literally. One Puritanminister was said in 1634 to have assured an oldwoman that she had been serving the Devil for thepast three score years, and said threateningly toanother parishioner, ‘Sirrah, your black godfatherwill come for you one of these days.’ Around 1597Thomas Wilkinson, minister of Helmingham,Norfolk, ‘in catechising one Estall's boy, told theboy the Devil was upon his shoulders; whereat the"},{"pageNumber":939,"pageContent":"boy ran out of the church crying and screeching tothe terror of all that were present’.6 John Rogers,the future Fifth Monarchist, tells us how as a boyhe suʃered terribly from fear of Hell and thedevils, whom I thought I saw every foot in severalugly shapes and forms, according to my fancies,and sometimes with great rolling ɻaming eyes likesaucers, having sparkling firebrands in one of theirhands, and with the other reaching at me to tearme away to torments.

Such demons, wrote the Calvinistdivine, James Calfhill, ‘appear to men in diversshapes, disquiet them when they are awake;trouble them in their sleeps, distort their members;take away their health; aʀict them with diseases’.The war with Satan was a perpetual combat inwhich the enemy seemed always to have theadvantage. ‘An inɹnite number of wicked angelsthere are, O Lord Christ,’ prayed Thomas Becon,‘which without ceasing seek my destruction.Against this exceeding great multitude of evilspirits send thou me thy blessed and heavenlyangels, which may deliver me from theirtyranny.’9 Some Protestant theologians continuedto uphold the old Catholic belief in guardianangels, and such angelic intervention wasoccasionally recorded.10 But more usually itseemed that God had given Satan a free run.Meteorologists denied that evil spirits wereresponsible for tempests, but many contemporarieswere less certain. ‘It is a common opinion,’ wrotean Essex clergyman in 1587, ‘when there are anymighty winds and thunders with terrible lightningsthat the Devil is abroad.’11 Diseases might alsocome this way.

In 1631 Mr Pennington, agentleman of Gray's Inn, whose customaryexpletive was ‘Devil take me!’ was visited by ablack dog, who left him dead, with his eyes clawedout. ‘Devil take him who goes out today’, said JohnLeech of Huntingdonshire in 1662, whereupon hewas picked up and carried in the air for twelvemiles, dying the following day.

Such Faustianlegends were in common circulation during thesixteenth and seventeenth centuries. They madeexcellent cautionary tales, revealing Satan as atrickster and showing how his recruits alwayscame to a bad end. In 1642 a pamphleteer relatedhow Thomas Holt, a Coventry musician burdenedwith nineteen children, had sold himself to theDevil. When the contract expired, the wretchedman was found with his neck broken, and his chestof gold turned to dust.

For your sins are so and so... and youheard the minister say that I will torment you.Give me your soul... and I will free you of hell-torments”’.19 The fear of hell-ɹre was thusparadoxically alleged by some witches as anexplanation for their apostasy.There is some reason for thinking that Satan'sovertures were a common form of temptation. Thecase-books of the Buckinghamshire doctor, SirRichard Napier, reveal that several of his patientsthought they had seen the Devil in human andanimal form. In April, 1634, they included EllenGreen, ‘troubled in mind, haunted by an ill spirit,whom she saith... speaketh to her’; Robert Lucas,‘troubled in his mind, despairing, doubtethwhether he be not possessed with an evil spirit’;"},{"pageNumber":945,"pageContent":"and Jane Towerton, ‘mopish and melancholy...and despairing; thought at ɹrst she saw as a blackdog something appearing to her and forbiddingher to serve God and say her prayers, and go tochurch’.20 Robert Burton describes how personswho felt themselves damned would ‘smellbrimstone, talk familiarly with devils, hear and seechimeras, prodigious, uncouth shapes, bears, owls,antics, black dogs, ɹends’.21 In his spiritualstruggles John Bunyan thought himself possessedby the Devil and could feel the ɹend plucking athis clothes. Many of his godly contemporariesunderwent a similar period of religious depressionwhen Satan appeared to them, often in some uglyanimal shape, and tempted them to kill themselvesor to forsake God.22 This explicit temptation wasso common and so intense that it is not surprisingthat those who had undergone it assumed thatothers must have succumbed.Of course there were some bold spiritsuntroubled by these apparitions. Mr Edwards,M.A., of Trinity College, Cambridge, after beingreclaimed from his conjurations, declared that theDevil had always appeared to him ‘like a man ofgood fashion’, and had never required any"},{"pageNumber":946,"pageContent":"compact from him.23 But normally Satan came totempt and to seduce. He played upon religiousuncertainties, and he provoked men to murder andviolence. Until the nineteenth century, juriescustomarily declared of suicides and criminals thatthey had been ‘led away by the instigation of thedevil’, and this was not necessarily an empty formof words. Mrs Turner, who was hanged after themurder of Sir Thomas Overbury, said at herexecution that she had been in the hands of theDevil, but was now redeemed from him. At YorkAssizes in 1690 Edward Mangall confessed that hehad murdered Elizabeth Johnson because ‘the Devilput him upon it; appearing to him in a ɻash oflightning, and directing him where to ɹnd the clubwherewith he committed the murder’.24Religious despair and prohibited desires werethus customarily personiɹed in the crude form of ablack man or a strange animal. Such apparitionssprang from an imagination well furnished inchildhood with terrors of the kind described byReginald Scot: ‘an ugly devil having horns on hishead, ɹre in his mouth, and a tail in his breech,eyes like a basin, fangs like a dog, claws like abear, a skin like a Niger and a voice roaring like a"},{"pageNumber":947,"pageContent":"lion’.25 Popular conceptions about the appearanceof such demons reɻected contemporaryassumptions as to what was displeasing andperverted, just as visions of the forces of goodmirrored the reverse. (One of Vavasor Powell'sfollowers, who had seen Christ, compared him to‘old Rice Williams of Newport’, with ‘a large greybeard’; and when Jesus appeared in a vision to thefuture Quakeress, Mary Pennington, he assumedthe form of ‘a fresh lovely youth, clad in greycloth, very plain and neat’.) 26 Only a minorityshared Scot's view that Satan was merely a symbolof man's evil temptations, incapable of corporealexistence.27 For most men the literal reality ofdemons seemed a fundamental article of faith. Asa theologian pointed out, ‘The whole scripture andall godly and wise men, as many as have livedfrom the beginning of the world even unto thisday, have confessed that there are evil spirits ordevils.’28So essential indeed was the belief in thepersoniɹcation of evil that the dogma wasparadoxically elevated into one of the greatestarguments for the existence of God, so that to denyit was to lay oneself open to the charge of atheism."},{"pageNumber":948,"pageContent":"‘If there be a God, as we most steadfastly mustbelieve,’ wrote Roger Hutchinson, ‘verily there is aDevil also; and if there be a Devil, there is no surerargument, no stronger proof, no plainer evidence,that there is a God.’ If men could be persuaded to‘grant that there are devils’, thought John Weemes,‘they must grant also that there is a God’.29 ‘Showme a devil,’ said a sceptic in 1635, ‘and I'll believethere is a God.’ The atheist, Richard White, wasonly converted to a Christian life by theappearance of the Devil one night, in the shape of‘a great ugly man’. Correspondingly, it was afterthe failure of several attempts to raise the Devil,‘that so I might see what he was’, that LaurenceClarkson decided that all religion was ‘a lie’, and‘that there was no Devil at all, nor indeed no God,but only nature’.30 The Puritan Richard Greenhammaintained that ‘it is a policy of the Devil topersuade us that there is no Devil’.31 For, asanother writer pointed out, ‘he that can alreadybelieve that there is no Devil will ere long believethat there is no God’.32The personiɹcation of Good rested upon thesame basis as the personiɹcation of Evil, and thetwo concepts were inextricably interlocked. But"},{"pageNumber":949,"pageContent":"there was an almost Manichaean quality to thisemphasis upon the Devil's reality. When AgnesWilson was arraigned as a witch at Northamptonin 1612, she was asked how many gods sheacknowledged. She answered, ‘Two – God theFather, and the Devil.’33 This was taken as adamning admission, but we may rather see it as anexcusable inference from the religious teaching ofthe day. In the widely inɻuential Great Catechismby the sixteenth-century Jesuit, Peter Canisius, thename of Christ appeared sixty-three times, that ofSatan sixty-seven.34 It is not hard to sympathizewith the occasional heretic who proceeded to theconclusion that the Devil was even more powerfulthan God.35Many social purposes were served by this beliefin an immanent devil. Satan was a convenientexplanation for strange diseases, motivelesscrimes, or unusual success. The stories told abouthis intervention in daily aʃairs showed himpunishing perjurers and blasphemers, snatchingaway drunkards, killing the impious. By providinga sanction for conventional morality theydischarged the same purpose as the other stories of‘judgements’ and ‘providences’ which the clergy,"},{"pageNumber":950,"pageContent":"particularly the Puritan clergy, retailed for theediɹcation of their ɻock. Satan's interventionscould also provide an acceptable explanation forprofessional failure, a shipwreck, or a fall in amine.36 Feelings of guilt evoked by sexual dreamsand nocturnal emissions could be assuaged by thereɻection that an incubus or succubus must havebeen at work.Above all the immanent Devil was an essentialcomplement to the notion of an immanent God.The early Hebrews had no need to personify theprinciple of evil; they could attribute it to theinɻuence of other rival deities. It was only thetriumph of monotheism which made it necessary toexplain why there should be evil in the world ifGod was good. The Devil thus helped to sustain thenotion of an all-perfect divinity.The Devil also operated as a sanction forChristian orthodoxy. Just as the early ChristianChurch had regarded the pagan gods as demons, sothe warring religious sects of the sixteenth andseventeenth centuries claimed that their rivalsworshipped Satan himself. This was said byProtestants of Catholics, by Catholics ofProtestants, and by Christians of Red Indians and"},{"pageNumber":951,"pageContent":"other primitive peoples.37 It was asserted thatLuther had been converted to Protestantism bySatan himself,38 and that the Freemasonsdedicated their children to the Devil when takingthe mason's word.39 Men saw the Devil in anymanifestation of social wickedness or religiousunorthodoxy. A Protestant iconoclast in 1540 coulddescribe the image of Christ in the roodloft as apicture of the Devil, while in 1704 a YorkshireNonconformist declared that people who receivedthe sacrament according to Anglican rites wereserving not God but the Devil.40Contemporaries were thus fully accustomed tothrowing about charges of devil-worship.Diabolical temptation was a reality for manygodly persons and the Devil's agency in the worldwas generally recognized. To this extent the beliefthat witches might make compacts with Satan isreadily intelligible as a consequence of the rhetoricof contemporary religion.2. Possession and dispossessionThe belief in the reality of Satan not only"},{"pageNumber":952,"pageContent":"stimulated allegations about diabolical compacts;it also made possible the idea of demoniacalpossession. A person into whom an evil spirit hadentered could be recognized by the strangephysical and moral eʃects of the intrusion. Hewould suʃer from hysterical ɹts, wild convulsionsand contortions, analgesia, strange vomitings,even total paralysis. From his mouth would comethe voices of demons, emitting obscene andblasphemous ravings, or talking ɻuently in foreignlanguages previously unknown to the victim.41The assault of devils might either be external(‘obsession’), or from inside the patient's body(‘possession’). Strictly speaking, the belief indemonianism was distinct from that in witchcraft.Obsession by the Devil was a well-known stagepreceding the conversion of many Puritan saints,and was not necessarily thought to involve themaleɹcence of some third party. But since it wasfrequently believed that an evil spirit had enteredinto a victim because a witch had sent him there,the notions were in practice intertwined. Inseventeenth-century England, the epithets‘possessed’ and ‘bewitched’ came very near tobeing synonymous."},{"pageNumber":953,"pageContent":"The medieval Church had given theologicaldeɹnition to the doctrines of possession andobsession, but it had also provided a tolerablyeʃective remedy for such complaints. The evilspirit, it said, could be commanded to depart in aformal exorcism conducted by a priest acting inthe name of God and the Church, a ceremonywhich also formed part of the rite of baptism. Thesaints of the early Church made a reputation forsuccessfully casting out devils and the oɽce ofexorcist was by the mid third century establishedas one of the minor orders. The ritual of exorcism,with the sign of the cross, symbolic breathing(insufflatio), holy water, and the command to theDevil to depart in God's name, was furtherdeveloped by the Catholic Church of the Counter-Reformation in its numerous prescribed manuals ofexorcism, not only for possessed persons, but alsofor poltergeists, haunted houses, and animals orhumans suʃering from supernaturally inɻictedtorments.42This ritual was not oɽcially regarded asinfallible and might fail because of the victim's sinsor the bystanders’ lack of faith. Nevertheless, itwas believed that demons had a natural horror of"},{"pageNumber":954,"pageContent":"the symbolism of Christianity and that the Churchhad been given a special power with which to castthem out (Mark, xvi, 17). In the Middle Ages thegeneral view seems to have been that, if allconditions were properly observed, the exorcismwas much more likely than not to be successful.43The application of relics or a visit to a holy shrinemight also prove effective means of dispossession.Protestant opinion, however, viewed thepractice of these exorcisms with considerablehostility. The Wycliɽtes had denounced them assheer necromancy, and their attitude was sharedby the Protestant theologians of the Reformationera. The exorcism of the unbaptized child wasabandoned in the second Edwardian Prayer Book,and the oɽce of exorcist disappeared with theother minor orders from the Ordinal of 1550. Thenew theory, as stated, for example, by BishopJewel,44 was that the power to cast out devils hadbeen a special gift, conceded in the heroic age ofthe early Christian Church, but no longernecessary in a time of established faith. Suchmiracles were over, and Christians were no longerto believe that the Devil could be frightened byholy water, the sign of the cross or the mere"},{"pageNumber":955,"pageContent":"pronunciation of words of Scripture. Would-beexorcists were no better than vulgar wizards. ‘Ifany man amongst us should use such things,’ saidJeremy Taylor, ‘he would be in danger of beingtried at the next assizes for a witch or aconjurer.’45Exorcism was thus generally rejected. Yet casesof possession continued to appear. Indeedevidence has survived of more instances in thelater sixteenth and seventeenth centuries than inthe era before the Reformation. But what was thepious man to do in face of these diabolicalassaults? He still had the protection of his faith,but there was now no automatic procedure fordealing with such cases of possession. A clergymancould no longer command a spirit to depart; hecould only entreat God to show his mercy bytaking the Devil away. Any healing, wrote anElizabethan preacher, ‘is not done by conjurationor divination, as Popish priests profess andpractise, but by entreating the Lord humbly infasting and prayer’. As Bishop Hall put it, ‘we thathave no power to bid must pray’.46It was diɽcult to bring men to accept the fullimplications of this new situation. The idea that a"},{"pageNumber":956,"pageContent":"child who cried at his christening was letting outthe Devil long survived the formal omission of theexorcism from the baptism service.47 For a time,moreover, it seemed that the Protestant remedy offasting and prayer might well be developed into aritual claiming something very near mechanicaleɽcacy. For all their rejection of what theyregarded as the ‘foul superstition and grossmagic’48 of the Catholic ritual of exorcism, thePuritans laid much stress on the eɽcacy of thisalternative procedure, founded on the words ofMark ix, 29 (‘This kind can come forth by nothing,but by prayer and fasting’). The century after theReformation was to witness many cases of allegeddiabolical possession in which Puritan ministersdiagnosed the malady, entered into discourse withthe devil, and triumphantly ejected it after fastingand prayer.The true nature of these supposed examples ofpossession is diɽcult for us to establish withoutclinical evidence. The aʀiction does not seem tohave been conɹned to persons of any particularage, sex or origin, and the concept was almostcertainly extended to embrace maladies of widelydiʃerent kinds. What is noticeable is the way in"},{"pageNumber":957,"pageContent":"which the symptoms became stereotyped toconform to popular conceptions of what theyshould be. One victim's description of Satan as ‘anugly black man with shoulders higher than hishead’ is typical, and in the account of a case in1573 the possessed person is revealingly said tohave been ‘monstrously transformed... much likethe picture of the Devil in a play’.49 The inɻuenceof Continental cases of possession is alsodiscernible. The two physicians who diagnosed aHertfordshire girl's possession in 1664 had been toFrance, where they had seen a whole convent ofpossessed nuns.50A conspicuous feature of the cases of possessionabout which details survive is that they frequentlyoriginated in a religious environment. Indeed itcould be plausibly urged that the victims wereengaging in a hysterical reaction against thereligious discipline and repression to which theyhad been subjected.51 The Devil's presence wasparticularly likely to be suspected when thepatient could not bear the sight or sound ofreligious objects and language; and exposure toprayer or religious ritual became a litmus-papertest of whether or not the patient was possessed. It"},{"pageNumber":958,"pageContent":"was reported of James Barrow in 1663 that, ‘if anyother did take the Bible and mention the word ofGod or Christ in his hearing, he would roar andcry, making a hideous noise’. The boy ThomasDarling in 1596 only felt his ɹts come on when hewas forced to take part in a prayer-meeting. Theex-bailiʃ of Dunwich, Thomas Spatchet, foundhimself unable to take part in religious exercises.The Worcestershire girl Joyce Dovey's ɹts came onat prayer-time. So did those of the Throckmortonchildren at Warboys.52 Such cases recall thepreacher Thomas Hall, whose devil-inspiredinsomnia was at its worst on the eve of thesabbath, or the Puritan, Richard Rothwell, whoknew that he was obsessed by Satan because of anoverpowering urge to blaspheme and reproachreligion.53An intensive régime of religious observancecould thus provoke a violent reaction. In Francethe best-known cases of possession occurred in thenunneries for the same sort of reason. As Freudpointed out, demons were ‘bad and reprehensiblewishes, derivations of instinctual impulses thathave been repudiated and repressed’. He himselfregarded diabolical possession as a form of"},{"pageNumber":959,"pageContent":"neurosis, associated with unconscious homosexualdesires. More recent psychiatrists have consideredit to be a severe type of schizophrenia.54Whatever its clinical nature, the consequences ofpossession are unmistakable. It provided both anexplanation and a legitimation of the kind ofunconventional behaviour which would nototherwise have been tolerated. When a possessedperson burst forth with blasphemies andobscenities no one subsequently reproached himfor doing so. Nor was the child who rebelledagainst his religious upbringing by hurling a Bibleacross the room liable to be punished, so long as itwas the Devil who was to blame. On the contrarythe child would become the centre of a dramaticritual of prayer and healing in which he wastreated with aʃectionate concern. To be the victimof possession was a means of expressing forbiddenimpulses and attracting the attention of otherwiseindifferent or repressive superiors.55It is not therefore surprising that so many casesof possession should have been reported amongthe Puritans and Dissenters. Possession was seldomdiagnosed in circles where religion was regardedas a thing indiʃerent, and it was frequently the"},{"pageNumber":960,"pageContent":"godly or ex-godly who were aʀicted, theirhysterical symptoms returning instantly upon thesight of a preacher or prayer-book. A typicalexample occurred in the spring of 1574 and wasrecorded at the time by the Puritan martyrologist,John Foxe. It is worth describing, since Foxe'saccount seems to have circulated widely in Puritancircles and helped to inɻuence the language andstyle of many later cases.The victim was a law student from the north ofEngland named Briggs. He had been to a lectureon the sin against the Holy Ghost, and hadmisunderstood the lecturer to say that all sins cameinto this category. Searching his conscience anddiscovering many faults, he persuaded himself thathe too had committed the sin and was a reprobatewhose prayers were in vain. After severalunsuccessful attempts at suicide, he noticed that hewas being followed by an ugly dog which wouldnot be driven away. When preparing to jump intothe Thames he saw it glaring at him ‘with suchterrible sparkling eyes’ that he realized it was noordinary dog, but the Devil waiting for his soul.The dog subsequently vanished and a well-meaning physician, diagnosing a case ofmelancholy, prescribed blood-letting and a purge."},{"pageNumber":961,"pageContent":"But Briggs fell into a trance, and from his lipscame forth his part of a dialogue between himselfand the Devil which was eagerly recorded by thegodly onlookers. The Devil assaulted him with acombination of threats and promises. On the onehand he assured him that there were no pains inHell, that there was no God, that Christ was notthe Son of God, that Christ's parents wereunmarried, that the Scripture was false, and thateverything happened by mere nature. On the otherhe urged that he was damned anyway, and that hewould do better to settle for his oʃers of acupboard of plate, and a seductive ‘paintedwoman’ (who temptingly sang and danced beforehim). This discussion continued at intervals forover a fortnight (the Devil explaining that he tookSundays oʃ to cut purses among the crowd at StPaul's Cross).In the end Foxe was called in to conduct aspecial prayer-meeting to reclaim the patient.Addressing the Devil directly (‘Thou most wretchedserpent... O thou foul devil, I command thee todepart’), he engaged the spirit in ɻuent argument,clearly enjoying the opportunity of a joust of thiskind. Satan skilfully counter-attacked bydenouncing Foxe as a witch, but ultimately the"},{"pageNumber":962,"pageContent":"patient himself was prevailed upon to commandthe Devil to depart in God's name, and his troubleswere over.56There had been a series of such dispossessionssince the beginning of Elizabeth's reign involvingmany clergy, particularly those of vehementProtestant sympathies.57 The year before theBriggs case, the Puritan Edward Nyndge, who hada university training, had played a leading role inthe dispossession of his brother Alexander. It washe who identiɹed the victim's symptoms, and whoknew that the right procedure was to conjure theDevil in the name of Jesus to depart.58 In 1574there were at least four cases of alleged possessionin addition to that of Briggs. In Norwich BishopParkhurst ordered fasting and prayer on behalf ofa young Dutch girl whom the Devil had assaulted,but elsewhere most of the leaders of the Churchwere suspicious of these episodes and took actionto prevent accounts of dispossession from beingcirculated. In London and Kent several womenwere punished for fraudulently simulating thesymptoms of possession, and measures were takenagainst unlicensed printers who disseminated thestory of their sufferings.59"},{"pageNumber":963,"pageContent":"The increasingly political character of thesepossessions and dispossessions was ɹnally madeclear in the later years of Elizabeth's reign by thenotorious career of John Darrell, the Puritanexorcist.60 Darrell, who was a university-educatedpreacher, conducted by prayer and fasting a seriesof spectacular cures of allegedly possessed persons,ɹrst in Derbyshire in 1586, then in 1596–7 inNottinghamshire, Lancashire and Staʃordshire. In1589 he was convicted by the High Commission asan impostor who had trained his patients tosimulate the now conventional symptoms ofdisorder in order to demonstrate his curative skill.Some of the most notable Puritan clergy of the dayhad been assistants at his dispossessions,61 andthe aʃair produced a head-on collision betweenthe rival factions coexisting in the AnglicanChurch. A protracted pamphlet controversy notonly revealed disagreement about the bona ɹdesof Darrell's patients, but raised the whole questionof the possibility of diabolical possession, and thestatus of the cure by prayer and fasting. In theprocess the question of the earlier Elizabethancases was also reopened, Darrell citing them asinspiring precedents, and his opponents making"},{"pageNumber":964,"pageContent":"play with what they called ‘the cozening of goodMaster Foxe’.62This debate was coloured by highly partisanconsiderations. Darrell's well-publicized activitieshad been used to make propaganda on behalf ofthe Puritans by suggesting that they had a capacityfor miracle-working, perhaps as an alternativetactic after the failure of their attempts to set up anew system of church government in the 1580s.Darrell also took the opportunity to make it clearthat the Devil did not share the Puritan distaste forsuch excesses as long hair. Under Darrell'sinɻuence the previously lukewarm inhabitants ofNottingham became zealous hearers of the Word,and it was feared that his activities ‘would infectthe commonwealth’.63 The Puritans also sawthemselves as striking a blow against Popery. For,as the minister George More, Darrell's closest ally,argued: ‘if the Church of England have this powerto cast out devils, then the Church of Rome is afalse church; for there can be but one true church,the principal mark whereof (as they say) is towork miracles, and of them this is the greatest,namely to cast out devils’.64Fierce repressive action was taken by the"},{"pageNumber":965,"pageContent":"bishops. The pamphlet account of Darrell'sdispossession of Thomas Darling was called in andthe printer imprisoned. Darrell and More werealso arrested, and their supporters in Nottinghamwere threatened with being bound over for goodbehaviour. In his written justiɹcations Darrellaccused the bishops of silencing witnesses andgenerally conspiring to hush up the true facts. AtCambridge the Vice-Chancellor took action againstthe sale of Darrell's works. A tailor was arrestedand the Puritan William Bradshaw was forced towithdraw temporarily from the University.65The initiative in hounding down Darrell seemsto have been taken by the leaders of the Arminianparty, newly emerging within the Church ofEngland, and it was they who made the issue ofpossession a political shibboleth. But there was nodoubt in anyone's mind that an emphasis onfasting and prayer was a sign of Puritanism. Inpractice the issue was associated with othercurrent controversies like the merits of a non-preaching ministry, the propriety of maypoles,and the right of midwives to baptize.66 Before theDarrell aʃair had died down, there erupted severalmore cases of allegedly possessed women, around"},{"pageNumber":966,"pageContent":"whom Puritan clergy busied themselves withfasting and prayer.67 The original Darrellcontroversy thus fused with these later outbreaks.Those involved on the Arminian side includedRichard Bancroft, Bishop of London, and futureArchbishop of Canterbury; William Neile, Dean ofWestminster, and later Archbishop of York; andWilliam Barlow, Archbishop Whitgift's chaplainand later Bishop of Lincoln.68 But the mostprominent ɹgures were the pamphleteers, JohnDeacon and John Walker, and the futureArchbishop of York, Samuel Harsnet, thenBancroft's chaplain.It was Harsnet who exposed Darrell's ‘fraudulentpractices’ in a powerful tract denouncing thewhole aʃair as a Puritan imposture. With Deaconand Walker he declared categorically that allexorcisms were in vain, because miracles hadceased. Prayer and fasting could never expel devilsand anyway corporeal possession was a thing ofthe past. The Arminians further published anEnglish translation of the controversial Frenchcase of Marthe Brossier, to show that purelynatural causes might underlie supposed cases ofpossession. At the Cambridge Commencement"},{"pageNumber":967,"pageContent":"William Barlow publicly maintained thatpossession was no longer possible.69Darrell countered by asserting that fasting andprayer were a recognized means of expulsion.They did not involve any claim to miracle-working, because they did not operateautomatically, but only by God's grace. The troublewas that Darrell was not consistent on this point,for in his writings he sometimes said that themethod could not fail. On a number of occasions,moreover, both he and other Puritan ministersseem to have directly addressed the Devil,conjuring him to depart, in the old Catholicmanner. This happened in several of the cases of1574, and at Chester ten years previously JohnLane had even blown vinegar into the possessedgirl's nostrils.70 This was a diʃerent matter frommerely supplicating God for his assistance.The culmination of the controversy was theruling in Canon 72 of the new Church Canons of1604 that henceforth no minister, unless he hadthe special permission of his bishop, was toattempt ‘upon any pretence whatsoever whetherof possession or obsession, by fasting and prayer,to cast out any devil or devils, under pain of the"},{"pageNumber":968,"pageContent":"imputation of imposture or cozenage anddeposition from the ministry’. This eʃectively putan end to the practice, at least as far asconforming members of the Anglican Church wereconcerned, for in the seventeenth century thereseems to have been no subsequent case in whichsuch a licence is known for certain to have beengiven.71 During the reign of James I, the Kinghimself and several of the bishops busiedthemselves in exposing cases of fraudulentpossession. When James came to Cambridge in1615 the University thought it appropriate to stagea play containing an episode mocking the wholeprocedure of exorcism.72 Many of the Puritanclergy, however, clung to their belief in theeɽcacy of fasting and prayer in cases ofpossession, and continued to hold that anyindividual minister was entitled to order a localfast when he thought it necessary. The method,wrote Thomas Cooper in 1617, was ‘not absoluteand necessarily eʃectual... yet proɹtable andconvenient to be used’. There was a long series ofdispossessions in the ɹrst half of the seventeenthcentury.73 The bishops, however, kept a sharpcurb on such activities until the Civil War, and"},{"pageNumber":969,"pageContent":"were always ready to expose frauds and punishparticipants. Indeed, as Richard Baxter records, itwas to be one of the great Puritan grievancesagainst the bishops that the High Commissionshowed such hostility to ‘fasting and prayer andother exercises which they found much beneɹtby’.74 After the Long Parliament met, Darrell'sTrue Relation of the dispossession of WilliamSommers was deɹantly republished in September1641.With the proliferation of the sects under theInterregnum cases of alleged diabolical possessionmultiplied. For one of the paradoxes of thecondition was that its symptoms were scarcelycapable of being diʃerentiated from those ofreligious ecstasy. Sectaries who engaged inmarathon acts of fasting or gave vent to religiousprophecy were often said by enemies to have beenbewitched, or even to be witches themselves. TheQuakers, in particular, were the subject ofnumerous such charges. George Fox's strongpersonal magnetism provoked many accusationsof witchcraft, while the bodily convulsionsstimulated by religious excitement at Quakermeetings were hailed as obvious signs of"},{"pageNumber":970,"pageContent":"possession.75 Several ex-Quakers claimed to havebeen bewitched during their period ofconversion,76 and a few formal charges of thiskind were actually brought before the lawcourts.77 Other sectaries were suspected of usingsorcery to attract followers to their cause.78Eccentric behaviour was thus deemed to be divineor satanic, according to the way one looked at it.In conventional Dissenting circles the reality ofdiabolical possession and the eɽcacy of fastingand prayer continued to be upheld until the end ofthe seventeenth century. Henry Newcome recalledthe prayer-meetings held at Cambridge in 1659 torescue a woman who had promised her soul to theDevil: ‘It was a University then, when manyMasters of Arts, Fellows of Colleges, could befound to keep a night to such a purpose.’79 In theɹfty years after the Restoration Nonconformistclergymen frequently conducted prayer andfasting to quieten haunted houses, eʃect physicalcures and allay diabolical possession. They alsotook every opportunity to publish accounts of theiractivities.80But it was not only the Dissenters who made"},{"pageNumber":971,"pageContent":"useful propaganda out of the Anglican abdicationfrom the ancient priestly oɽce of exorcism.Inevitably, the Catholics, who continued to employthe rite on the Continent, invoked it as part oftheir campaign to re-conquer England for the faithin the reign of Elizabeth I, chary though theCounter-Reformation Church normally was aboutpermitting such exorcisms. In 1558, at the laststage of the Marian reaction, a priest from Romewas sent by Bishop Bonner to conjure an evil spiritout of the heretic John Mills, although thesupposedly possessed man had laughed in theexorcist's face.81 In 1585–6 (the time of Darrell'sɹrst case), however, a more systematic campaignof exorcising was launched among the members ofsome leading recusant households, notably those ofSir George Peckham at Denham, Buckinghamshire,and Lord Vaux at Hackney. A number of priestsunder the leadership of the Jesuit, William Weston,spectacularly ejected devils from maid-servantsand others by an elaborate ritual, which involvedseating the possessed person in a chair, holding hishead over smoking brimstone and forcing him todrink a potion of sack mixed with holy oil and rue,a concoction, according to Harsnet, ‘which an"},{"pageNumber":972,"pageContent":"honest man would scarce give to an horse’.82 Themain aim was to demonstrate that only therepresentatives of the true faith had the power tocast out devils. But a number of additionaldebating points were scored in the process. Duringhis long interrogations, for example, the Devil wasprevailed upon to reveal his strongly Protestantsympathies and his terror of the Church of Rome.The Catholics made such play of these and otherexorcisms that the leading participants wereeventually seized and examined by the authorities.In 1603, in the wake of the Darrell controversy,their depositions were published by SamuelHarsnet in his A Declaration of Egregious PopishImpostures, a scathing work of polemic.83Thereafter it became common to print hostileaccounts of Catholic exorcisms on the Continent.84The recusants, however, continued their activities.Every year the reports of the Jesuit Mission inEngland recorded successful exorcisms ofbewitched persons and dispossessions of thoseattacked by evil spirits. In 1626, for example, nofewer than sixty persons were said to have beenrelieved. Propaganda was also made about thecurative eɽcacy of relics, the agnus dei, holy"},{"pageNumber":973,"pageContent":"water and holy wells. In return the bishops didtheir best to expose frauds, like William Perry, ‘theboy of Bilson’, whose impostures in 1620 had beenencouraged by Popish exorcists.85Many of these cases of supposed possession alsoinvolved accusations of witchcraft. Diabolicpossession did not necessarily presuppose a humanintermediary, but in practice it was common forthe victim to see a vision of the witch responsiblefor his torments, and for preventive action to betaken accordingly. Fits of the type associated withpossession were conventionally seen as the resultof witch-craft.

All the old mechanical protectionswere dismissed as empty symbols, lacking anyeɽcacy in themselves. For how, demanded theProtestant preacher, John Scory, in 1543, couldthe Devil be afraid of such toys, when the NewTestament recorded that he was not even afraid ofChrist himself?106 When Richard Greenham wasapproached by a woman who believed herself tobe bewitched, his advice was essentially negative:she should at all costs refrain from consulting"},{"pageNumber":983,"pageContent":"wizards.

But any otherform of magical relief was totally prohibited.109The new religion made the situation evenbleaker by playing down the importance ofguardian angels, and denying the intercessionarypower of saints, while at the same time placing anunprecedented stress upon the reality of the Deviland the extent of his earthly dominion. Thesituation was piquantly symbolized by the changemade under Protestant inɻuence in 1558 in theannual procession by St George's Gild, Norwich.The two saints, George and Margaret, were notallowed to appear any more, but it was resolvedthat ‘the Dragon (should) come in and showhimself as in other years’.110It is not surprising that many old Catholicformulae retained their value in times of"},{"pageNumber":984,"pageContent":"emergency for Protestants who found themselvesdisarmed in face of the old enemy.

When Agnes, wife of RichardHarrison, parson of Beaumont, feared in 1582 thatshe had been bewitched by Agnes Heard, herhusband told her: ‘Trust in God and put your trustin him only, and he will defend you from her, andfrom the Devil himself... Moreover, what will thepeople say, that I, being a preacher, should havemy wife so weak in faith?’ When his wifecontinued to worry, he again exhorted her toprayer, but added signiɹcantly that ‘he wouldhang... the said Annis Heard, if he could prove anysuch matter’.121 This revealing conversationshows how little consolation was aʃorded to those"},{"pageNumber":991,"pageContent":"who feared witch-craft by the assurance that ifonly they had faith they would not so fear.

Theultimate onus of checking the damage done bywitchcraft thus fell on the courts, and the legalprosecution of the witch became the one sure wayout of what was otherwise a total impasse.

Hence the stresson the sinfulness of such techniques.But England seems to have been largely immunefrom these later medieval theological currents.There was no demand from above for theprosecution of witches and the people remainedcontent to protect themselves by a combination ofecclesiastical and folk magic.

Edmund Copinger, associate ofthe Elizabethan fanatic, William Hacket, claimedthe power to identify the elect and to denouncevengeance upon the damned.13 A Puritan ministerwas said in 1618 to have hurled curses from thepulpit at those who walked out of his lengthysermons, while Thomas Larkham, the unpopular"},{"pageNumber":1005,"pageContent":"Commonwealth incumbent of Tavistock, wasaccused of pronouncing ‘the curse of God’ upon aparishioner.14 During the Civil War the Royalistclergy were quick to call down God's curse uponthose who abolished episcopacy and proscribed theAnglican Church.15 Under the CommonwealthLodowick Muggleton and John Reeve claimed adivine commission to bless the godly and topronounce God's solemn curse upon the reprobate.Muggleton himself greatly enjoyed issuing curses,whether in person or by letter; ‘It did him moregood,’ he said, ‘than if a man had given him fortyshillings.’ His activities led to some spectacularincidents, in which the power of auto-suggestionseems to have brought about the rapid demise ofseveral victims. When John Robins, the Ranter,was damned by Muggleton, he felt a sudden‘burning in his throat’; soon afterwards, however,he began to issue similar curses himself.16 Some ofthe Quakers also pronounced formal maledictionsof this kind upon their enemies and collectedstories about the resulting ‘judgements’.17But the real source of the continuing belief in theeɽcacy of cursing lay, not in theology but inpopular sentiment.

In the Middle Ages one John Tregossabused his position as trustee of a Cornish estateby appropriating the land for himself and turningthe widow and children out of doors. The injuredfamily made daily supplications on their knees,calling down God's vengeance upon Tregoss andhis posterity. As a result there ensued a series ofjudgements so heavy that, as late as the reign ofCharles II, one of the descendants, ThomasTregoss, a dissenting clergyman, spent many hourspraying for the removal of the curse.20 Similarly,it was the curse called down upon Thomas Ardenof Faversham by a mariner's wife, whose land hehad unjustly appropriated, which led to his murder"},{"pageNumber":1007,"pageContent":"in 1551, subsequently commemorated in a famousElizabethan play.21 It was very likely, thought amid-seventeenth-century writer, that curses of thepoor might take eʃect upon enclosing landlordsand their families.22 Some even attributed themisfortunes of the royal house of Stuart to theconduct of their twelfth-century ancestors.23There was also the curse based upon patriarchalauthority, reinforced as it was until the midseventeenth century by the convention thatchildren should kneel to receive the blessing oftheir parents. This was no sentimental triviality,but a solemn act which Puritans regarded as anobnoxious Popish survival. ‘If any child be stiʃ-hearted, stubborn and froward, and will not thusask blessing,’ wrote Richard Whytforde, an earlyTudor authority on child-rearing, ‘if it be withinage, let it surely be whisked with a good rod andbe compelled thereunto by force.’ In the laterseventeenth century Roger North recalled how hehad been brought up to reverence his father: ‘Theconstant reward of blessing, which was observedas sacred, was a petit régale in his closet.’24 But ifparents had the power to bless, reasonedcontemporaries, then why should they not exercise"},{"pageNumber":1008,"pageContent":"such an authority in reverse? ‘The blessing of theparents,’ wrote Whytforde, ‘doth ɹrm and makestable the possessions and the kindred of thechildren.

Like other primitive peoples,30contemporaries believed that curses worked only ifthe party who uttered them had been unjustlytreated. The Old Testament held out the promisethat God would listen to the cry of the widows andthe aʀicted. The oppressed might be wrong toutter such curses, but that did not mean theirimprecations would not take eʃect. As a Puritanpreacher put it, ‘men in anger many times will(though they should not) wreak themselves... withcurses and imprecations [upon those who do nothelp the poor], and God always will punish theirunfaithfulness to him... with execution of the"},{"pageNumber":1010,"pageContent":"curses denounced against them’.31 ‘The curses thatcome from the poor,’ agreed Selden, ‘[do not] hurtme because they come from them, but because I dosomething ill against them,...

In Shakespeare's plays, the cursespronounced by the characters invariably work.33This is not just for dramatic eʃect; it was a moralnecessity that the poor and the injured should bebelieved to have this power of retaliation when allelse had failed.The religious ideas of the time thus gaveplausibility to the maledictions uttered by thesubmerged sections of Tudor and Stuart society.The court books of the Anglican Church reveal thatthe line dividing a curse from a prayer wasextremely thin, and that imprecations could"},{"pageNumber":1011,"pageContent":"frequently have a religious ɻavour about them.Thus, to take some examples from the diocese ofHereford, Margery Bluck cursed Mary Davies in1630, ‘praying to God that an evil end might comeof her’; while Catherine Mason in 1614, accusingRobert Davies of having killed her husband,‘prayed to God that his house, children and all thathe had, were one wild ɹre’.34 Such imprecationswere often delivered in ritual form, the woman onher knees in the middle of the street, and a smallcrowd gathering to watch the event. JoannaNurden of Much Marcle was presented in 1616 for‘kneeling on her knees’ and cursing John Sergeantand his wife. John Smyth cursed William Waltonof Yarpole around 1598, ‘kneeling on his knees inthe churchyard there, and praying unto God that aheavy vengeance and a heavy plague might lighton him and all his cattle’.

Butthis type of behaviour was a characteristic reactioneverywhere on the part of those who believedthemselves to have been unjustly treated. Therecords of the church courts contain manyexamples of men and women who prayed in thisritual way that God would shorten the lives oftheir enemies, burn their houses, kill their children,destroy their goods, and blast their descendants.Of course such words were often uttered in theheat of temper, and subsequently regretted. But onmany occasions they seem to have beenpronounced in cold blood and fully intended totake eʃect. Great ingenuity was deployed inchoosing suitable torments for the victim: ‘a heavypox to the ninth generation’; ‘pox, piles, and aheavy vengeance’; ‘God's curse and all the plaguesof Egypt’; these were common curses.36 So wasthat of Isabel Leighe of Rickmansworth, who in"},{"pageNumber":1013,"pageContent":"1567 ‘cursed one Baldwyn, when the bell tolled forhim, wishing and praying that the Devil might tearhim body and soul’.37 More original were AliceSkilling, who told the minister and churchwardensof Mepal, Cambridgeshire, in 1608 that she hoped‘the meat and drink they ate might go up anddown their bellies as men go to harrow’, and JaneSmyth, who in 1673 cursed Mrs Rod of Hereford,‘wishing that before she died she might crawl uponthe ground like a toad upon all fours’.38 It wasquite usual to invoke ‘the plague of God’, notuncommon to call on the Devil, and, in ProtestantEngland, by no means unheard of to imitate theexample of Elizabeth Weeks, who, in 1617,complained the vicar of Littlebourne, Kent, ‘cursedme and my wife, wishing the Pope and the Deviltake me’.39 At the end of the Civil War aLondoner, tired of wishing ‘a pox of God’ on theParliament, declared that ‘she would invent a newcurse for them’, but the details of her formula donot survive.40Sometimes the curse merged into elaborate ritualmagic.

Itexploited the universally held belief in thepossibility of divine vengeance upon human evil-doers, and it could strike terror into the hearts ofthe credulous and the guilty. In 1596 in Essex thewife of Maurice Jones was sent for by oneRobgent's wife to treat her with medicine for thecolic.

In 1634 an inhabitant ofWinwick, near Oundle, claimed to know a prayerwhich would shorten a man's life.57It was at this point that these imprecations couldlead on to a charge of witchcraft. ‘Cursers aremurderers,’ wrote a contemporary, ‘for if it pleaseGod to suʃer their curse to take eʃect, the partycursed is murdered by the Devil.’58 Diabolical aidwas not invariably suspected in these cases.

He hadwished that his neighbour's tongue might rot oʃ,and so it had.61 This was to be a stock pattern ofwitchcraft accusation. ‘When a bad-tonguedwoman shall curse a party, and death shall shortlyfollow,’ wrote Thomas Cooper, ‘this is a shrewdtoken that she is a witch.’ In the writings of thedemonologists, as in the prosecutions before thecourts, successful cursing and banning was treated"},{"pageNumber":1021,"pageContent":"as a strong presumption of witchcraft.62It was ironic that such a presumption shouldhave been so readily made.

Thomas Cooperapparently saw no irony about declaring that,when the witch resorted to ‘invocating upon herbare knees (for so the manner is) the vengeance ofGod’ upon her oppressors, the resulting evil wasnevertheless the work not of God but of Satan.63But the witch may sometimes have seen herselfas the instrument of God.

We do not know how many casesresembled those of Margaret Landish, who in 1645refused to confess, and made ‘a strange howling inthe court to the great disturbance of the wholebench’.87 But it is not surprising that some of thedemonologists should have spoken wistfully of theutility of torture,88 or that the courts had toresolve that the witch's conviction should not be"},{"pageNumber":1034,"pageContent":"made conditional on her having confessed to thecrime.89 At an early stage in the persecutionbelievers in witchcraft had been forced to explainaway this reluctance to confess, by suggesting thatthe witch might have been silenced by one of herconfederates, or even inhibited by the Devilhimself.90All these considerations help to weaken thevalue of those confessions which have survived,especially the particularly schematic onesextracted by Matthew Hopkins, and his like. Thecloser the confession conforms to the ideas ofcontinental demonologists, the less convincingdoes it appear when carefully scrutinized. Yet notall the confessions of relations with the Devil canbe so easily dismissed. Some were unsolicited, likethat of the butcher, Meggs, who voluntarilytravelled in from ten or twelve miles away to besearched by Hopkins and duly executed as a witch.Others contained information which seems toounconventional to have been invented by anyprofessional interrogator.

Menmay make such confessions in order to attractattention, or to gain peace of mind by publiclyacknowledging a long-concealed hostility towardsother members of society. Others accusethemselves of every possible sin out of adepressive sense of their own worthlessness.93They may even welcome the opportunity ofundergoing the ordeal of investigation in the hopeof clearing a long-standing slur on their character,or in expectation of being more leniently treated.Thomas Cooper commented in 1617 on how somesuspected witches voluntarily came to the victim tobe scratched; and it seems clear that some of those"},{"pageNumber":1036,"pageContent":"informally accused after the lapse of theWitchcraft Act in 1736 were only too anxious toclear themselves by voluntarily submitting to the‘swimming’ ordeal.

But they also suggest thatfor the historian, confessions unsupported by otherevidence can prove little. They do not, however,rule out the possibility that some at least of thesuspects really did believe that they had been ableto wreak vengeance upon their enemies by the useof curses, magical techniques and even animalfamiliars. Accustomed by contemporarytheological discourse to personify their own evilsentiments and temptations, they may well havethought of themselves as meeting the Devil, thesymbol of all that was evil and anti-social, in theway that other contemporaries genuinely believedthat they had seen or heard God.

The psychological processes involvedare no more obscure (and no less) in the one casethan the other; and they are worth someconsideration.3. The temptation to witchcraftDoubtful though the confessions may be asevidence for any actual practice of witchcraft, theyare, nevertheless, of incomparable value for thelight they throw upon the motives and temptationsto which both interrogator and accused assumedthat witches were liable to be subject. Beforeassessing this evidence it is necessary to bear inmind that the judicial records reveal two essentialfacts about accused witches: they were poor, andthey were usually women. Learned authoritiesnever had any doubt that the weaker sex was morevulnerable to the temptations of Satan. James Iestimated the ratio of female witches to male attwenty to one. Alexander Roberts put it as high asa hundred to one. In fact, of the one hundred andnine persons whom Ewen showed to have beenexecuted on the Home Circuit only seven weremen.95 Contemporary writers also agreed that"},{"pageNumber":1038,"pageContent":"witches came from the lowest ranks of society.They were usually beggars, thought Scot; ‘verymiserable poor, the basest sort of people’, saidRichard Bernard. ‘Witches... for the most part livein extreme beggary,’ agreed John Donne. Ofnearly six hundred persons accused on the HomeCircuit, Ewen calculated that all but four weretradesmen, husbandmen and labourers, or theirwomenfolk. Elsewhere the general pattern appearsto be the same. Labourers and their wives orwidows always predominate.96 This was notbecause witch-beliefs did not circulate in the higherreaches of society. On the contrary, they werefamiliar at every social level. But in the witch-trials the accused were overwhelmingly drawnfrom the bottom of the social hierarchy.It is, therefore, not surprising that theconfessions, whether genuine or extorted, agree insuggesting that most accused persons lived in astate of impotence and desperation. Theircommonest motive was thought to be the desire toescape from grinding poverty. The Devil promisedthat they should never want; he oʃered meat,clothes and money, and was ready to pay theirdebts. Although he sometimes held out the prospect"},{"pageNumber":1039,"pageContent":"of great riches, his normal gambit was merely anassurance that his followers would never lack forfood or clothes. Elizabeth Pratt was promised in1667 that ‘she should live as well as the bestwoman in the town of Dunstable’.97 What is sopathetic about most of these temptations is thatthe bait was so small. If a speciɹc sum of moneywas mentioned it was only a few shillings, oftenless. In 1645 Elizabeth Southern met the Devil onher way to Westleton. He promised her two andsixpence but then failed to let her have it, and‘complained of the hardness of the times’. Hisadvice to Priscilla Collit was that she should makeaway with her children, for otherwise she wouldalways continue poor.98 There is no reason whywe should doubt the reality of such temptations.The Devil's solutions were only too closely relatedto the wretched women's plight. On manyoccasions he tempted them to steal, to commitsuicide, or to kill their children so that there wouldbe more food to go round.99 ‘Extremity ofaʀiction’, as Thomas Cooper thought, was theprimary cause of temptation. The Devil bided histime until a suitable moment arrived, whenbereavement or poverty would make his victim"},{"pageNumber":1040,"pageContent":"ready to welcome his advances. Then he struck,with promises of food, money, and even sexualsatisfaction to compensate for spinsterhood or ahusband's death.100The confessions of some of Hopkins's victimssuggest that not only poverty but also religiousdespair might provide fertile soil for the Devil'stemptations. He appeared to Mary Becket and toldher that her sins were so great ‘there was noHeaven for her’. He overheard Susan Marchantsinging a psalm while milking a cow and ‘askedwhy she sung Psalms, for she was a damnedcreature; and from that time she received herimps’.101 Anne Boreham was promised that sheshould be free from the pains of Hell, while JoanRuce was told that Satan's imps ‘were more able tosave her soul than God’. For Elizabeth Richmondthe Devil assumed the form of the prophetDaniel.102The hopelessness produced by this combinationof religious depression and material poverty maywell have bred a desperate willingness to resort tounorthodox methods of salvation. It speaksvolumes for the nature of popular religiousinstruction that Mary Skipper should have"},{"pageNumber":1041,"pageContent":"confessed to being tempted to become a witch,because the Devil promised ‘he would pay herdebts and... carry her to Heaven and... she shouldnever want’.103 If ignorant men and women couldbe persuaded that it was worthwhile to attachthemselves to Satan, then the theologians who hadcreated this concept of the Devil had onlythemselves to blame. But the pull towards Satancould also be felt by the theologically moresophisticated. Devil-worship was one of thetemptations experienced by those undergoing thedepressive state which usually preceded a Puritanreligious conversion. John Rogers, the FifthMonarchy man, confessed that when he was ayoung man, too poor to get to CambridgeUniversity, ‘the Devil did often tempt me to studynecromancy and nigromancy and to make use ofmagic, and to make a league with him, and thatthen I should never want’.104 For persons in astate of hopelessness attachment to the Devilsymbolized their alienation from a society to whichthey had little cause to be grateful. In this sensethe idea of devil-worship was not a total fantasy.It had what has been called ‘subjective reality’.When she saw herself as going over to the Devil,"},{"pageNumber":1042,"pageContent":"the witch was surrendering to passions with whicheveryone was familiar and on whose repressionsociety depended.105Witchcraft was thus generally believed to be amethod of better-ing one's condition when all elsehad failed. Like most forms of magic, it was asubstitute for impotence, a remedy for anxiety anddespair. But it diʃered from the others in that itusually involved acts of malice towards otherpeople. Although the witch might expect to gainsome material beneɹts from her diabolicalcompact, these were subordinate to her maindesire, to avenge herself upon her neighbours.Such a desire was to be found at all levels insociety, but it was usually only the poor andhelpless who hoped to attain it by witchcraft,because for them the normal channels of legalaction or physical force were not available. Thedesire for revenge, and the inaccessibility ofnormal agencies for achieving it, were thus theessence of the witch's predicament. ‘Lowness ofcondition,’ thought Nathanael Homes, was the ɹrstingredient in the making of a witch:When men through crosses, wrongs, vexations,wants, etc., are in deep discontent; so that they"},{"pageNumber":1043,"pageContent":"say in their hearts, what would they not do, thatthey might be avenged on such and such; at suchtimes as these, the Devil, by voice only, or by someshape also, approacheth near to them, oʃeringthem aid... upon his conditions.106Armed with this new access of supernatural power,the witch could face up to her adversaries. ‘Thepoor old hag,’ wrote George Giʃord, ‘thinkethherself strong that she hath two or three servantsas she may seem to plague such as she is oʃendedwithal.’107Given such widespread contemporaryassumptions about the potentialities of witchcraft,it was hardly surprising that there were personslike Mary Cutford of Rainham, Essex, who, it wasreported in 1632, ‘did most wickedly wish herselfto be a witch for a time that she might be revengedof her adversary’.108 In Herrick's words:Old Widow Prouse to do her neighbours evilWo'd give (some say) her soul unto theDevil.109"},{"pageNumber":1044,"pageContent":"Ill-treated by their neighbours, many poorermembers of society were reduced in theirhelplessness to threats and imprecations of anindisputably malevolent kind. When such threatswere followed by the illness or death of theirvictim, observers could easily persuade themselvesthat witchcraft had been employed. And so, ofcourse, could the witch.Seeing things sometimes come to pass accordingto her wishes, curses and incantations [remarkedScot], (the witch), by due examination of thecircumstances is driven to see her imprecationsand desires, and her neighbours' harms and lossesto concur... and so confesseth that she (as agoddess) hath brought such things to pass.In 1667 Ursula Clarke of Dunstable was chargedwith witchcraft after expressing the hope thatWilliam Metcalfe would ‘waste like dew againstthe sun’, boastfully adding that ‘some people hadwronged her, but they had as good have let heralone, for she... had seen the end of Platt, and shehad seen the end of Haddon, and she hoped sheshould see the end of Metcalfe, and that she hadnever wished nor cursed anything in her life but it"},{"pageNumber":1045,"pageContent":"came to pass’.110Those modern historians who dismiss the wholenotion of witch-craft as groundless are therefore asmistaken as the contemporary demonologists whosaw themselves surrounded by a sect of ritualdevil-worshippers. For however fanciful thedelusions of the accused persons, and howeverfabricated the confessions extracted from them,some at least of the witches felt genuine hatred forthose around them. Although their resort to cursingand banning was a substitute for real action, theymay well have genuinely persuaded themselvesthat an access of supernatural power was helpingtheir curses to take eʃect. It would be wrong tosuggest that all persons accused of witchcraft hadhad malevolent thoughts about their neighbours.But a substantial proportion of them certainly had,for it was the witch's malignity which gave thecharge plausibility in popular eyes, and, thoughthat malignity could be inferred from the witch'ssocial situation, it was often evidenced by heractual behaviour.This was why some of the most powerful mindsof the seventeenth century believed in punishingso-called witches, even though sceptical as to their"},{"pageNumber":1046,"pageContent":"actual powers. ‘Witches,’ declared John Donne,‘think sometimes that they kill when they do not,and are therefore as culpable as if they did.’ ‘As forwitches,’ wrote Hobbes, ‘I think not that theirwitchcraft is any real power; but yet that they arejustly punished, for the false belief they have thatthey can do such mischief, joined with theirpurpose to do it if they can.’ Selden said the same:If one should profess that by turning his hatthrice and crying ‘Buz’ he could take away a man'slife, though in truth he could do no such thing, yetthis were a just law made by the state, thatwhosoever should turn his hat thrice, and cry ‘Buz’,with an intention to take a man's life, shall be putto death.The witchcraft statutes could thus be justiɹed as acheck on the repression of malevolent feelings,though as Scot pointed out, if mere ill-will was tobe punished then men would be driven to theslaughterhouse in thousands.111Her curses and imprecations thus symbolized theaccused witch's relationship to society. Indeed theDevil conventionally made his ɹrst appearance"},{"pageNumber":1047,"pageContent":"when he heard the woman cursing.112 He steppedin to resolve her frustrations and make her emptywords take eʃect. Alice Duke confessed in 1665that she had been persuaded to give her soul toSatan, because he promised that ‘if she curseanything with “A pox take it”, she should have herpurpose’. Joan Waterhouse likewise confessed in1566 that, when refused bread and cheese by aneighbour's child, she went home and called upSatan in the form of a great dog, bidding her to goand frighten the girl, which he agreed to do inreturn for her body and soul.113 Like everyoneelse, the witches had been taught to personify theirevil thoughts as the intrusion of Satan. Bysuccumbing to temptation they had, symbolically,joined the Devil's army. A few may even havethought that he heard their prayers and grantedtheir wishes.Of those who thus mentally allied themselveswith Satan, some already had a record of religiousindiʃerence or unorthodoxy; a few may even havebeen real God-haters, like Elena Dalok, who wassaid in 1493 to have coupled malevolent threatstowards others with the unashamed avowal that solong as God remained in Heaven she preferred to"},{"pageNumber":1048,"pageContent":"be in Hell.114 Some may have been sinnersobsessed by their guilt. Others were self-consciousrenegades; like Jane Townsend, who was said in1670 to have oʃered to teach girls to becomewitches by going to church, lying down before thefont and forswearing their Christian names seventimes.115 Animal familiars may also have beenemployed. Fairly convincing evidence that womensometimes equipped themselves with toads inorder to hurt other people was supplied by acunning man in 1566; while a cat called ‘Satan’seems to have gone the rounds of a number ofpoor households in the Essex village of HatɹeldPeverel at the same date. The toad-familiarexperimentally dissected by William Harvey on afamous occasion clearly had an objectiveexistence.116But whether these domestic pets or uninvitedanimal companions were seen as magical isanother matter. These creatures may have beenthe only friends these lonely old women possessed,and the names they gave them suggest anaʃectionate relationship. Matthew Hopkins'svictims in Essex included Mary Hockett, who wasaccused of entertaining ‘three evil spirits each in"},{"pageNumber":1049,"pageContent":"the likeness of a mouse, called “Littleman”,“Prettyman” and “Daynty” ’, and Bridget Mayers,who entertained ‘an evil spirit in the likeness of amouse called “Prickeares”’. More recently thenovelist J. R. Ackerley has written of his motherthatOne of her last friends, when she was losing herfaculties, was a ɻy, which I never saw but whichshe talked about a good deal and also talked to.With large melancholy yellow eyes and long lashesit inhabited the bathroom; she made a little joke ofit but was serious enough to take in crumbs ofbread every morning to feed it, scattering themalong the wooden rim of the bath as she lay init.117It is not diɽcult to imagine what MatthewHopkins would have made of this relationship.The absence of any organization, cooperation,continuity or common ritual among witches thusmakes it impossible to speak with Miss Murray ofa ‘witch-cult’, leave alone of the ‘old religion’. Thewitch at her most malevolent was an isolatedindividual, the creature of her own fantasies. She"},{"pageNumber":1050,"pageContent":"did not hunt in ‘covens’, and her devil-worship, ifany, was a private matter. There may have been afew meetings between like-minded persons benton doing mischief by magical means,118 but thereis no evidence of ritual sabbaths. The belief in suchnocturnal gatherings may, however, have beenencouraged by the tendency of wandering beggarsto milk other men's cows and sleep in large groupsin barns and out-houses, spending the eveningpiping and dancing.119 Accused witches had nodemonstrable links with a pagan past. If any ofthem served the Devil, it was only too obviouslythe same Devil as that portrayed by theconventional religious teaching of the day.But such possible cases of mental apostasyshould not lead us to think that all English witcheswere devil-worshippers in this symbolic sense.Most accusations of witchcraft related to supposedmaleficium and did not suggest that the accusedperson had contemplated even a mental transferof allegiance to the Devil. If devil-worship wasadded to the charge, this was usually because ofthe intervention of an educated would-bedemonologist. But since the crime was a mentalone only, it becomes impossible for the historian to"},{"pageNumber":1051,"pageContent":"distinguish the minority of suspects who may havecommitted it from all the others who were unfairlycharged. How can we today separate theallegations which had at least some symbolic truthfrom those which were in every sense false?The irony was that the one category could blendinto the other. For even the innocent person,under the pressure of interrogation, might come tobelieve that she was guilty. The supreme paradoxwas that some of the suspects confessed that theyhad taken up witchcraft in order to avengethemselves upon neighbours who had falsely calledthem witches.120 Society thus forced the role ofwitch upon its victims.Some call me witch,And being ignorant of myself, they goAbout to teach me how tobe one; urging,That my bad tongue (bytheir bad language madeso)Forespeaks their cattle,doth bewitch their corn,"},{"pageNumber":1052,"pageContent":"Themselves, their servants,and their babes at nurse.This they enforce upon me;and in artMake me to credit it.1214. Society and the nonconformistTo appreciate the light in which the witchappeared to her neighbours it is necessary to recallthe importance which the inhabitants of sixteenth-and seventeenth-century England attached tosocial harmony, and the variety of means theyemployed to check all signs of dispute ornonconformity. This tendency was perhapsparticularly marked in the tightly-knit ɹeldenvillages, owning common ɹelds and subject tostrict regulation by manorial custom. But it was tobe found everywhere. Many villages had theiroccasions for communal feasting and dancing,when miscellaneous grievances were amicablypatched up. In some Herefordshire and Shropshireparishes there was even customary eating anddrinking at the communion table.122 It would beeasy to exaggerate the eɽcacy of these ‘love"},{"pageNumber":1053,"pageContent":"feasts’, church ales, Easter ‘drinkings’, andtraditional holidays. Bickering and open violencehad always been features of village life, anddrunken quarrels at times of festivity could triggeroʃ new animosities. But these festivities symbolizethe importance attached to harmony andagreement.123Indeed if the records of Tudor and Stuart villagelife leave any single impression, it is that of thetyranny of local opinion and the lack of tolerancedisplayed towards nonconformity or socialdeviation. Rural society lacked much of themodern concept of privacy and private life. Thecustoms of the countryside required joys andsorrows, weddings and funerals, to be shared withother members of the community; there was noidea of the holiday as ‘getting away from it all’.Nor was there any challenge to the view that aman's most personal aʃairs were the legitimateconcern of the whole community. On the contrary,everyone had a right to know what everyone elsewas doing. This is clearly shown by thepresentments and depositions made before theecclesiastical courts. Eavesdropping may havebeen technically an oʃence, but this did not inhibit"},{"pageNumber":1054,"pageContent":"the witnesses from testifying in adultery cases towhat they had seen through a window or hole inthe wall. They felt no shame about this, and if indoubt would run to get their friends to look forthemselves.124 These neighbours were observant;they knew if too many members of a family weresleeping in the same bed; or if children were borntoo quickly after a marriage. They kept an eye oneach other's visitors, and were quick to spot anysuspicion of scandal. When a new couple movedinto the village the inhabitants had nocompunction about demanding proof that theywere married.125This was quite diʃerent from the growingimpersonality of London and similar large-scaleurban communities.126 In the villages the textureof life was more like that conveyed by a story toldtoday by the Nyoro, an East African people, abouta man who moved into a new village and wantedto ɹnd out what his neighbours were like. In themiddle of the night he pretended to beat his wifevery severely, to see if they would come andremonstrate with him. Yet though he beat agoatskin, while his wife screamed out that he waskilling her, nobody came. So the next day the man"},{"pageNumber":1055,"pageContent":"and his wife packed up and left the village, andwent to ɹnd some other place to live.127 Thisfable would have been entirely intelligible in pre-industrial England. Indeed, when the Duke ofStettin visited the country in 1602 he was informedthat ‘in England every citizen is bound by oath tokeep a sharp eye at his neighbour's house, as towhether the married people live in harmony’.128Apart from making presentments in the churchcourts, villagers had many informal ways ofexpressing their disapproval of the way a marriedcouple comported themselves: by playing ‘roughmusic’ under their window, for example, or ‘ridingthe skimmington’, i.e. staging a processionintended to ridicule the cuckolded husbands orwife-beaters.129The importance of neighbourly opinion wasrecognized by society as a whole. At ecclesiasticallaw a bad reputation (‘ill fame’) was suɽcient tojustify a prosecution,130 while in the common lawcourts it was still accepted that the jury might benot impartial assessors, but members of thecommunity from which the oʃender had sprung,and well-informed about his general standing inthe community. When a Yorkshire gentleman had"},{"pageNumber":1056,"pageContent":"to stand trial for conspiracy in 1680 he demanded,and was granted, a jury composed of gentlemen ofquality, from his own county, ‘that may be able toknow something how I have lived hitherto’.131There were also judicial institutions designed tocheck those who threatened social harmony. Courtleet and quarter sessions provided machinery todeal with cursers, quarrellers, tale-bearers andwranglers of every kind. The cucking stool hadbeen a familiar instrument of punishment since thethirteenth century, but in the Tudor period its usecame to be largely conɹned to the publicexhibition or immersion of the scold, thatcharacteristic member of the village community,deɹned legally as ‘a troublesome and angrywoman who, by her brawling and wranglingamongst her neighbours, doth break the publicpeace and beget, cherish and increase publicdiscord’. To control such termagants somecommunities employed the cucking-stool, whileothers put the oʃender in a cage, or led heraround the streets by a metal bridle.132The Church was also preoccupied with the needto maintain good relations between its members.The Prayer Book instructed the oɽciating minister"},{"pageNumber":1057,"pageContent":"to refuse the Communion to any parishionersbetween whom there was hatred or malice. Whenthe incumbent visited the sick he was required tointerrogate the suʃerer to make sure that he wasin charity with his neighbours and harboured nogrudges. In their visitation articles the bishops andarchdeacons inquired into the activities of anyscolds or sowers of discord and required oʃendersto be brought before the church courts forpunishment.The terms in which such oʃences were describedthrow much light upon the values of the villagecommunities in the century before the Civil War. Atroublemaker might be presented for being ‘anordinary scoʃer of his neighbours’; for being ‘abusy woman of her tongue’; for being ‘a breeder ofdiscord between man and wife, and a breaker ofcharity’; for being ‘a maker of rhymes, thereby toraise slanders’; ‘for not being in charity with herneighbours’; ‘for scolding and railing of most men,or rather of every man when they do anything inthe town's business or aʃairs contrary to her ownmind or not pleasing unto her’; ‘for a commonscold and a disturber of the whole parish’; for‘libellous and lascivious ballads [on] divers of herneighbours’; for saying there was ‘no honest"},{"pageNumber":1058,"pageContent":"woman in the town’; ‘for reporting in our parishthat he hath had the use of the bodies of all thewomen in reach, except seven’; for inventing nick-names; for hanging up horns outside a neighbour'sdoor; ‘for terming the parishioners to be acompany of jackdaws’.133Once before the ecclesiastical court, such busy-bodies were liable to a form of censure which wasdesigned as much to propitiate the community asto appease the Church. The standard ecclesiasticalpunishment was the imposition of a penance, bywhich the oʃender publicly acknowledged hisfaults before his neighbours, before beingreconciled to the community. Public penance ofthis kind could be ordered by secular courts as wellas by ecclesiastical ones. In medieval townsoʃenders had sometimes been escorted to gaol byminstrels, drummers and bagpipe players. In theseventeenth century they might be ordered by StarChamber or quarter sessions to be exposed inpillory or stocks, or paraded in the market-placewearing a paper enumerating their faults. Thegreatest punishment which the church courts couldimpose was excommunication, a secular sanctionas much as an ecclesiastical one, for in its more"},{"pageNumber":1059,"pageContent":"serious form it meant that the criminal was cut oʃ,not just from the sacraments of the Church, butfrom intercourse with the whole community. Anexcommunicated man was, in theory, not allowedto eat or work with other folk. His testimony wasunacceptable in a court of law, and if he diedunreconciled his body was ‘pitted’ in unhallowedground. The penalty emphasized that thedelinquent's essential oʃence was his rejection ofthe standards of the society to which he belonged.Facts like these are necessary if we are toappreciate the high value set on social conformityby this tightly-knit, intolerant world with whichthe witch had parted company. She was theextreme example of the malignant or non-conforming person against whom the localcommunity had always taken punitive action inthe interests of social harmony. Their ‘cchief fault’,wrote Reginald Scot of witches, ‘is that they arescolds’. So close was the association betweenscolding and witchcraft in the popular mind that aforeign visitor, shown the cucking-stool at Honitonin 1760, was actually informed that it had oncebeen used to punish witches.134The old woman who had recourse to malignant"},{"pageNumber":1060,"pageContent":"threats in her extremity was therefore liable to paya high price for the consolation they aʃorded her.She might be punished as a scold or a curser, aswell as running the risk of the more serious chargeof witchcraft. Even if she was ultimately acquitted,her family might suʃer great hardship during hertemporary imprisonment; the Lancashire QuarterSessions records contain several petitions in whichaccused persons complain that their dependentshave been denied poor relief or that theythemselves have had to sell their clothes to paytheir gaoler's fees.135 But quite apart from the riskof formal prosecution, the suspected witch mightbe ostracized by her neighbours. When the wife ofa Devizes weaver was slandered as a witch in 1653the local bakers refused to allow her to bring herdough to their bakehouses; while it was said ofGoodwife Gilnot, who was similarly defamed inKent in 1641, that ‘if she be esteemed such a kindof creature everybody will be afraid of her, andnobody set her a-work, inasmuch as truly she willbe utterly undone’.136 In 1665 a crippled labourerwas turned out of his lodging in a Lancashirevillage because he was suspected of witchcraft;while Sarah Liʃen, who died in Great Yarmouth in"},{"pageNumber":1061,"pageContent":"1710, ‘was so forlorn and wretched a person as shelabour'd under the imputation of being a witch,and the youth and other rude folks in the town...did often insult and aʃront her as she walk'd, andat her own house’.137The suspected witch was also liable to informalacts of violence. The ninety-four-year-old AgnesFenn alleged in 1604 that, after she had beenaccused of witchcraft, Sir Thomas Grosse andothers punched, pricked and struck her, threatenedher with ɹrebrands and gunpowder, and ɹnallystabbed her in the face with a knife.138 MarySutton was apprehended in 1612 and beaten witha cudgel ‘till she was scarce able to stir’;139 andwhen Andrew Camp suspected Goodwife Bailey in1661 of having bewitched his children, he draggedher out of her house into the street, bruising herback and pinching her, and then kneeled upon herbreast; ‘and when he had her so under him his wifecame and clawed her by the face and said shewould claw her eyes out of her head, and hertongue out of her mouth, and called her adamned... old witch’.140 Such violence wasencouraged by the popular belief that the injuredparty could recover his health by ‘scratching’ or"},{"pageNumber":1062,"pageContent":"drawing blood from the person who had bewitchedhim. In 1664 George Long, with the aid of twoarmed soldiers, made a forcible entry into AnneWarberton's house (fatally injuring her child in theprocess), and then pricked and scratched her untilhe had drawn a suɽcient quantity of blood. Therewere many similar cases of assault with thorns,needles, bodkins and knives.141Sanctions of this kind inevitably constituted acheck upon outbursts of temper, swearing andcursing, or similar expressions of malignity. Insixteenth- and seventeenth-century England, noless than in some modern African societies, witch-beliefs could thus inhibit the expression of viciousfeelings,142 and help to reinforce the prevailingethic of neighbourliness and communal solidarity.But they increased the sense of isolationexperienced by the person who had becomeestranged from her neighbours, and they enhancedher desire for revenge.For the helpless old woman who had fallen outwith the rest of the community there was only oneother available form of retaliation which was astempting as witchcraft and as diɽcult ofdetection. This was arson. In the seventeenth"},{"pageNumber":1063,"pageContent":"century, as at other times, it was a common meansof revenge for those who felt themselves injured bytheir neighbours. Arson required no great physicalstrength or ɹnancial resources and could be easilyconcealed. It was an indiscriminate means ofvengeance, however, for a ɹre, once started, waslikely to spread. As such, it perhaps appealedespecially to those whose hatred for theirneighbours was all-embracing.Some social outcasts were content to pray thattheir neighbours be consumed by ɹre, but othersresorted to more direct methods.

Margaret Byxand Ellen Pendleton were executed in 1615 forattempting to burn down Wymondham, Norfolk.The Catholics were suspected of having put themup to it, but Margaret Byx, like some suspectedwitches, had been persuaded to take part by thepromise that she would be carried to anothercountry, where ‘she should have... a good living,better than she had where she was’.144 Two yearslater Roger Wright, allegedly a drunkard andblasphemer who refused to work, said that ‘hehoped to see the town of Nantwich on as hot a ɹreas ever it was’. In 1631 three persons wereexecuted at Bury for burning some forty houses atWalberswick, Suʃolk.

Arson had long been a felony,and it was deprived of its beneɹt of clergy underthe Tudors. But without invoking the law thecommunity was fully capable of taking the matterinto its own hands.

It was said shecame from Halifax.147The resemblance between this episode and themanifestations of popular hatred against witchesin the ‘swimmings’, or near-lynchings as theybecame, needs no underlining. Violent action wasalso taken against scolds. At Calne, Wiltshire, in1618 a party of three or four hundred men,sounding horns and bells, and led by a drummer,broke into Thomas Wells's house, and seized hiswife Agnes, handling her violently, and intendingto place her in the cucking-stool.148 Arson,scolding and witchcraft were all acts of hostilityagainst society to which the poor and rejectedmight be reduced.

At Wymondham in 1615 it was said that awind was raised by conjuration to keep the ɹreburning.149The ineʃectiveness of such protests needs nounderlining. The witch, like the arsonist, assumedthat the hardships of life were to be attributed tothe personal failings of other people rather than toimpersonal social causes. Both sought to revengetheir hardships by inɻicting personal damage onothers, rather than by seeking some form ofpolitical or social reorganization. Their attitude, inother words, was incompatible with the politicalradicalism by which it was ultimately superseded.In the later seventeenth century witch-prosecutions dwindled; but the proportion ofactions for malicious damage against property issaid to have multiplied.150 Burning houses,breaking hedges, treading down corn: such werethe means by which the poor retaliated against"},{"pageNumber":1068,"pageContent":"their betters.

To answer this we must analyse thecircumstances in which accusations of witchcraftcame to be made.In a society technologically more backward thanours the immediate attraction of the belief inwitchcraft is not diɽcult to understand. It servedas a means of accounting for the otherwiseinexplicable misfortunes of daily life.

There was, for example, nosatisfactory contemporary explanation for thesudden deaths which are today ascribed to canceror heart disease, while the absence of any germtheory made the onset of many kinds of infectionutterly inexplicable. Lacking any naturalexplanation, men turned to a supernatural one.The common people [wrote a doctor in 1735]when incapable of penetrating the reasons of theirbodily suʃerings, are exceeding prone to chargethem on the inɻuence and operation of superiorinvisible powers; believing, as their phrase is, thatthey are under an evil tongue, or aʀicted by somemischievous eye, [they] impute their maladies tonecromancy and witchcraft, [and] are inclined touse spells, charms and anti-magical remedies fortheir cure.2"},{"pageNumber":1072,"pageContent":"There was thus a standing disposition toattribute to witchcraft a variety of deaths anddiseases, aches and pains, which would cause us nointellectual problem today. Rheumatism, arthritis,creeping paralysis, tuberculosis: all can berecognized in the symptoms of the seventeenth-century witch's supposed victims. Today's doctors,for example, might have no diɽculty indiagnosing the case of Roger Boyden, who, whenthreshing corn, was ‘suddenly stricken down to theground and taken lame, both in his right arm andleft leg, and so continued till his death’; or of hisdaughter, Luce Boyden, who ‘after a ravenousmanner did devour an extraordinary proportion ofsustenance, yet she pined away to skin and bonesand so died’. The one clearly had a stroke; theother perhaps cancer, or galloping consumption.Yet in 1605 Margaret Cotton was charged withhaving brought about both deaths by witchcraft.3Such a diagnosis met a genuine emotional need.

Even the highest body of the land, theRoyal College of Physicians of London, wasoccasionally prepared to countenance witch-beliefs, if no other explanation for an illness wasforthcoming. Thus in the case of John Parker in1623, the College would not eliminate thepossibility of witchcraft, but ruled that ‘there maybe some, by the strangeness of the sick man'sinfirmities’.7 Earlier, in 1602, the College hadshown itself divided over the cause célèbre ofElizabeth Jackson, who had been accused of usingwitchcraft to bring on the ɹts of fourteen-year-oldMary Glover.

Even inthe highest reaches of society, where the bestmedical advice was available, charges ofwitchcraft could circulate freely. The sudden deathof the Earl of Derby in 1594 was at ɹrst attributedto image-magic, while two supposed witches wereexecuted in 1619 for killing the Earl of Rutland'seldest son, and tormenting other members of thefamily. Edward Fairfax, the elegant translator ofTasso, charged six women with bewitching hisdaughters in 1621. Other supposed victims ofwitchcraft or maleɹcent magic included theCountess of Bridgwater, Lord Purbeck, Sir JohnWashington, Lady Jennings and Lord Windsor.10If medical knowledge was often inadequate fordiagnosing the illness of men and women, it waseven more limited when confronted by the diseasesof animals. For, although there were professionalfarriers, veterinary science was rudimentary.Farmers were not completely ignorant of thesubject, of course. In the early seventeenth century"},{"pageNumber":1076,"pageContent":"the leading handbooks on animal husbandry madeno mention of supernatural maladies;11 and whenNicholas Stockdale was accused in 1600 ofbewitching John Richers's sheep, a Norfolk jurywas quite capable of acquitting him by decidingthat the animals had burst from over-feeding, afterbeing unwisely put in a ɹeld of freshly-cut barleystubble.12 But the more unusual occurrence mightstill be attributed to witchcraft - the epidemicwhich spread through one farmer's herd, but didnot aʃect those of his neighbours, or the diseasewith perplexing symptoms, like the paroxysmswhich overtook a Southampton tanner's pigs in1589, so that they ‘danced and leaped in a moststrange sort, as if they had been bewitched’.13It is not diɽcult, therefore, to see that the beliefin the possibility of witchcraft served the usefulfunction of providing the victim of misfortune withan explanation when no other was forthcoming. Itsupplemented the deɹciencies of contemporarytechnique, particularly of medical technique.

InEssex, for example, seventy per cent of allaccusations related to the death or illness ofhuman beings, and most of the others to injuries toanimals. But accompanying pamphlet accounts ofthe background to the trials reveal that witchescould also be blamed for more trivial misfortunesas well, though these were not made the basis ofthe legal indictment against them.14 It is hard toknow how much allowance to make for theselectivity of the evidence given in the courts, butit certainly yields the impression that there was astylized character about witchcraft as anexplanatory theory.

When Henry VIII tired of Anne Boleyn heput it about that he had only been attracted to herin the ɹrst place because she had practisedwitchcraft to seduce him.15 A similarinterpretation appealed to lesser men who foundthemselves in a similar situation. After the ɹfthEarl of Sussex had abandoned his wife for the sakeof a mistress in the reign of James I, the Countess'sfriends endeavoured to prove that black magic wasresponsible for her failure to retain her husband'saʃections. When in 1619 a gentlewoman foundthat her daughter had eloped with a disreputableploughboy, whose father had been executed forfelony, she attributed the mésalliance to ‘diabolicalsorcery’.16 This is what has been called the ‘face-saving’ function of witchcraft.17Such charges of diabolical aid were freely"},{"pageNumber":1079,"pageContent":"deployed by unsuccessful politicians, baffled by thesuccess of their rivals, from Cardinal Wolsey, whowas believed to have bewitched Henry VIII, toOliver Cromwell, who was well known to havemade a contract with the Devil on the eve of thebattle of Worcester.18 Other types of defeat mightalso be attributed to witchcraft by the unsuccessful,who naturally preferred to believe that theiropponents had cheated, rather than to accept thatthey had been beaten in a fair ɹght. In a primitivesociety, witch-beliefs of this kind can act as asevere check to technical progress by discouragingeɽciency and innovation. A man who gets aheadin a tribal society is likely to awaken thesuspicions of his neighbours. Among the Bemba ofNorthern Rhodesia, for example, it is said that toɹnd a beehive with honey in the woods is goodluck; to find two beehives is very good luck; to findthree is witchcraft. In such an environment, witch-beliefs help to sustain a rough egalitarianism. Theyare a conservative force, acting as a check uponundue individual eʃort. Similarly, in twelfth-century England the chronicler WilliamMalmesbury could complain that the commonpeople disparaged excellence in any sphere by"},{"pageNumber":1080,"pageContent":"attributing it to demonic aid.19There is not much evidence, however, to suggestthat witch-beliefs had this egalitarian eʃect insixteenth- and seventeenth-century England, wherecommercial life was frankly competitive, and thedesire to get ahead increasingly accepted.Mechanical ingenuity was often attributed tosorcery in Tudor times, and there was a case in thereign of Mary of an archer being arrested forwitchcraft because he shot too well.20 But it wasrare (though not unknown) for a commercialrival's success to be explained in terms of hismagical power.21 In the sixteenth century,witchcraft, like hidden treasure, was occasionallyhinted at as the reason for some particularlyblatant example of that social mobility to whichcontemporaries could never entirely adjustthemselves. One James Phillipe of Brignal,Yorkshire, was rumoured to have so enchanted theeighth Lord of Scrope of Bolton (d. 1549), ‘that hegot such substance of lands and goods which hathbrought him from the state of a yeoman, almost topresume with a gentleman, and to be his fellow,yea rather his better’. Such innuendos helped toexplain why rewards were not always"},{"pageNumber":1081,"pageContent":"proportionate to merit, but they seem to have beenuncommon. In England witchcraft was anexplanation of failure, not of success. ‘We thinkthem bewitched that wax suddenly poor,’ wroteReginald Scot, ‘not them that grow hastily rich.’22Misfortunes in the military sphere, however,were sometimes put down to a rival's witchcraft.In the ɹfteenth century English failure in Francehad been attributed to the sorcery of Joan of Arc,and even in the reign of Charles II a Cornish witchwas held responsible by some for the Duke ofYork's lack of maritime success against theDutch.23 When Wardour Castle temporarilymanaged to hold out against the Royalists duringthe Civil War, the besiegers attributed thisunexpected resistance to the witchcraft of RobertBalsom, a Puritan preacher who was one of thebeleaguered garrison.24 James II was rumoured tohave a magical hat, which would reveal theidentity of those who plotted against him, and aPopish necromancer, who could control the windsand sink William of Orange's fleet.25Many of these accusations were, of course,either disingenuous or the product of self-"},{"pageNumber":1082,"pageContent":"deception. The Elizabethan vicar of Brenchley,Kent, who kept losing his voice when conductingthe service, chose to blame this on the sorceries ofone of his parishioners, but the wiser members ofthe congregation were unconvinced, for theysuspected he had the French pox.26 Sea captainsmight likewise invoke witch-craft to explain whythe vessels under their charge had suʃeredshipwreck or capture at sea.27 Many accusationsemanated from servants and children seeking toexcuse their own negligence – as in the case of thetwenty Lancashire witches of 1634, whose troublesbegan when the boy Edmund Robinson invented afantastic story, to save himself a whipping forplaying truant instead of bringing home hisfather's cattle.28 When in 1582 a cow kicked overAlice Baxter's pail, thereby losing the morning'smilking, she rushed back to her employer toexplain that the animal had been petriɹed by anevil spirit.29 ‘When a country wench cannot gether butter to come,’ observed Selden, ‘she says thewitch is in her churn.’ In Africa today witchcraftmay still provide an acceptable excuse for failure,and can be evoked to account for such diversdisappointments as barrenness, impotence, and"},{"pageNumber":1083,"pageContent":"failure in examinations.30The study of witch accusations is thereforecomplicated by the existence of many cases inwhich the witch-beliefs of the day were exploitedfor selɹsh purposes, often by downright fraud.Sometimes the main aim was to get the accusedperson out of the way, for fear she should revealsome guilty secret; as when Joan Peterson wassuccessfully accused and executed in 1652 toprevent her implicating others in a case ofconspiracy.31 Sometimes the charge arose out ofsome family feud; in the reign of James I, afterThomas Methwold had married Anne Lea againstthe wishes of her three sisters, the trio conspired toframe him with a witchcraft charge.32 Fraudulentaccusations of this kind were sometimes uncoveredin the courts, but others may have escapeddetection. Yet such instances must be recognized asessentially parasitic to the witch-beliefs, and in noway their cause. They present some interestingpathological problems, but will be disregardedhere.Disingenuous accusations of witchcraft couldnever have been made without the prior existenceof ingenuous ones. Many men proɹted by the"},{"pageNumber":1084,"pageContent":"credulities of their contemporaries, but this is noexplanation of how such beliefs came to exist inthe ɹrst place. Even the fraudulent youth, WilliamPerry, the ‘boy of Bilson’, coached by recusantpriests to simulate possession, admitted to havingpicked upon Jane Cocks as the one who hadbewitched him, because she was already ‘a womanill thought of and suspected for such like things’.33Edmund Robinson in 1634 also built his story upona foundation of local gossip. Many private scoreswere paid oʃ under the cover of witchcraftaccusations, just as they were (to take a parallelinstance) during the Marian persecution ofProtestant heretics, when victims were oftendenounced by neighbours and ‘friends’.34 But thisdoes not explain why Protestants (or witches)were being persecuted in the first place.Why then did a man in all honesty turn to theoccult malevolence of his neighbour as anexplanation for his misfortunes? So far, it has beensuggested that he normally only tended to do sowhen there was no natural cause immediatelyapparent. But witchcraft was not the onlyalternative explanation available. If a mansuʃered some unexpected reverse he could seek an"},{"pageNumber":1085,"pageContent":"astrological explanation in the stars; he couldblame evil spirits or the fairies; he could askhimself what ritual precaution he had neglected; orhe could just shrug his shoulders and blame his badluck. In many primitive societies virtually alldeaths, save those in advanced old age, areattributed to witchcraft or ancestral spirits or somesimilar phenomenon. But in England at this periodmen were fully accustomed to the possibility ofaccident and misadventure.35 Even if they wantedto blame someone they did not need to invokewitchcraft. They could accuse other enemies ofsociety, like the Catholics, around whom extensivesadistic fantasies had been woven. Catholics, itwas said, had started the Civil War by inɹltratingthemselves in disguise into the Parliamentaryparty. They had brought about the execution ofCharles I, and had disguised themselves asLevellers, Quakers and other revolutionaries. Theywere behind many of the outbreaks of ɹre inseventeenth-century towns. They could also attackindividuals. The godly layman, William Brettergh,who lived among Papists near Liverpool, wasbelieved to have had his horses and cattle severaltimes killed in the night, ‘by seminary priests (no"},{"pageNumber":1086,"pageContent":"question) and recusants that lurked thereabouts’.36But, of all alternative explanations ofmisfortune, the most obvious was the theologicalview that the disaster had been caused by God,either to punish sin, or to try the believer, or forsome other unknown but indisputably justpurpose. This, however, had never been acomfortable doctrine to swallow. In the ɹrst place,it was scarcely consoling to reɻect that one's sinshad been singled out for divine visitation.According to the Kentish gentleman, HenryOxinden, it was precisely this refusal to endure thecorrection of God which led men to blame theiradversities upon some neighbour's witchcraft.Certainly it was because he could not believe thatGod would want to punish him, that the vicar ofBrenchley had blamed his son's illness upon thewitchcraft of old Margaret Simons. Scotsardonically wondered how many witches wouldhave had to be executed if any Elizabethan hadbeen handled by God in the way that Job hadbeen.37But the greatest diɽculty about the theologicalexplanation of misfortune was one which it sharedwith astrological and other explanations, and that"},{"pageNumber":1087,"pageContent":"was the diagnosis oʃered no very promisingmeans of redress. A man could pray to God forrelief, but without any certainty of success. Theattraction of witch-beliefs, by contrast, was thatthey held out precisely that prospect of redresswhich the theologians denied. By personalizingtheir misfortunes, the victims were able to remedytheir situation. To begin with, they could guardthemselves against future attacks by using one ofthe conventional magical preservatives. Of thesethe most popular were herbs – vervain, dill, rowan– hung above the threshold. But there were otheramulets, like horseshoes, which, it was said, werekept in most houses in the West End of London inthe seventeenth century.38 If the witch hadalready struck, there were plenty of counter-charms designed to force her to reveal herself andcall oʃ the spell. A common procedure was to bol,bake, bury, or otherwise deal with, a sample of thevictim's urine. When this was done, the witchwould suʃer great discomfort, usually from beingunable to urinate, and thus be forced to revealherself.39 Excavations have recently unearthedover twenty examples in London and East Angliaof the ‘witch-bottle’, a bellarmine ɻask containing"},{"pageNumber":1088,"pageContent":"the hair, nail-parings, et of the victim for whomrelief was being sought. Chemical tests conɹrmthat the bottles once contained urine.40 Their usereɻected contemporary assumptions about thepower of sympathy. John Locke, for example,advised that the Countess of Shaftesbury's urineshould be buried as a cure for her nephritis; whilecountry housewives used to put hot pokers in boys'excrement, believing that this would cause thempain and deter them from ever again defecatingoutside their front doors.41 Another practice wasto burn a tile or piece of thatch oʃ the roof of thesuspect's cottage,42 or to burn, or bury alive, oneof the animals whom she was believed to havebewitched.43 Other formulae included cutting oʃand burning the suspect's hair, and making animage of the witch and pricking it with pins. As acontemporary remarked, men ‘often becomewitches, by endeavouring to defend themselvesagainst witchcraft’.44Most of these methods were meant to bring thewitch back to the scene of the crime. Once sheappeared, the victim, it was believed, could put anend to his illness by scratching her and drawing"},{"pageNumber":1089,"pageContent":"blood; this was ‘the most infallible cure’, said thewitnesses in the Leicester witch-trial in 1717.45Such ‘scratching’ might involve violence of sundrykinds. Beating the witch was thought by some tobe a means of recovery; when old Mother Rogerswas suspected in 1593 of bewitching a child, thecunning man at Hastings, one Zacharias, advisedputting a knife in her buttock.46But the best cure of all was to have the witchprosecuted and executed. For the point of suchwitch-trials was not merely that they aʃorded thevictim the gratiɹcation of revenge, but that,according to contemporary belief, they positivelyrelieved the victim. ‘The maleɹce,’ wrote JohnGaule, ‘is prevented or cured in the execution ofthe witch.’ All Robert Throckmorton's childrenrecovered after the execution of the witches ofWarboys.47 The virulence of the prosecutions isthus more intelligible when it is appreciated thatthe trials were credited with a genuine therapeuticeʃect upon the victim. The destruction of the witchhad become what James I called ‘a salutarysacriɹce for the patient.’48 It was, moreover, theonly procedure of which the theologians approved,for, of course, they prohibited all counter-magic;"},{"pageNumber":1090,"pageContent":"even scratching the witch was diabolical, as theysaw it.49The great appeal of witch-beliefs, as againstother types of explanation for misfortune, was,therefore, that they provided the victim with adeɹnite means of redress. They did not merelyoʃer the intellectual satisfaction of identifying thecause of the mishap; they made it possible to takeimmediate steps to have things put right, byconsulting the cunning man and applying theappropriate magical remedies. Individuals whohad endured bad luck for years on end thus cameto grasp desperately at the only explanation whichcould also be a solution. William Godfrey, forexample, wrote from the Fleet prison in 1662 along letter to the astrologer Booker, in which hedetailed a catalogue of misfortunes extending oversome ten years. First, he had been court-martialledand cashiered; then a surgeon had tried to poisonhim; after which he had gone to sea, where heendured a series of disasters. Now he had returnedhome, only to be arrested for debt. As a result, ‘thesaid Godfrey doth think that he is bewitched bysome evil body’. He therefore wanted theastrologer to identify the witch, so that"},{"pageNumber":1091,"pageContent":"appropriate therapeutic action could be taken.50Sometimes, of course, this kind of request sprangfrom sheer paranoia. Mrs Eleanor Aylett ofMagdalen Laver, Essex, complained, ɹrst to thetwo Napiers, then to Lilly, for a period of over tenyears, about the torments suʃered from witchcraftby her family and herself.51 In Norfolk MaryChilderhouse petitioned the quarter sessionsbetween 1652 and 1657 because she thought thatat least eight persons were practising witchcraftagainst her.52 But the main aim of thesecomplaints was always to get something doneabout the causes of the misfortune. ‘Witches,’ as amodern anthropologist remarks, ‘are potentiallycontrollable by... society; the caprices ofenvironment are not.’53Contemporary medicine also suʃered bycomparison because of its inability to oʃer acertain cure for every disease, even if it coulddiagnose it. This came out clearly in 1602, duringthe trial before Lord Chief Justice Anderson ofElizabeth Jackson for causing Mary Glover'shysterical ɹts by witchcraft. When Dr Jorden forthe defence argued that the girl's illness had anatural cause, Anderson rounded on him: ‘What do"},{"pageNumber":1092,"pageContent":"you call it?’, quoth the Judge. ‘Passio hysterica,’ saidthe Doctor. ‘Can you cure it?’ ‘I cannot tell.

For if you tell me neither a natural causeof it, nor a natural remedy, I will tell you that itis not natural... Give me a natural reason and anatural remedy, or a rash for your physic.54Here the judge's assumption seems to have beenthat the only true diagnosis was one whichpostulated, not only a cause, but also a remedy.Because Dr Jorden could guarantee no redress bymedical means, the judge preferred to accept anexplanation in terms of witchcraft.Witch-beliefs, therefore, served both as anexplanation of misfortune, and as an expectedmeans of redress. But why were they invoked bybelievers at one moment of time and not another?"},{"pageNumber":1093,"pageContent":"What were the circumstances which brought theminto play? How did an individual witch accusationstart? The answer to these questions can only bediscovered by studying the relationship betweenthe witch and her accuser, and by analysing thecommon factors underlying the diversecircumstances in which these accusations weremade. At this point the historian is indebted to thesocial anthropologists, who have pioneered thismethod in their studies of witch-craft elsewhere.2. The witch and her accuserThe ɹrst feature which emerges from a scrutiny ofwitchcraft accusations is an obvious one, but isnevertheless important. This is the fact that it wasexcessively rare for men to decide that they hadbeen victims of witchcraft without also having aparticular suspect in mind. Having hit upon magicas the explanation for their misfortunes, it seldomtook them long to identify the probable witch.Usually they knew at once who it must have been.Sometimes they even had the suspect in mindbefore the witchcraft had been committed: ‘I havea suspicion in thee,’ said Mary Dingley to MargerySingleton in 1573, ‘and if any in my house should"},{"pageNumber":1094,"pageContent":"miscarry thou shalt answer for it.’55 But normallythe identiɹcation of the witch followed hard on theheels of the recognition that witchcraft had been atwork.This feature is admittedly diɽcult to establish inall cases, since the ɹrst extant evidence is usuallythe formal indictment, in which the oʃence andthe accused person are named simultaneously, andfrom which it is impossible to reconstruct thethought-processes which had previously gone on inthe accuser's mind. In particular, they do not tellus what other suspicions he had entertained.Indeed the indictments even conceal the identity ofthe persons who ɹrst made the accusation. Yetthese bald statements tell us a certain amount.They show that the accused witch did not operatefrom a distance against strangers, but lived in thesame neighbourhood, usually in the samevillage.56 The witch, in other words, already hadsome sort of relationship with her victim beforeshe was believed to have begun to practise hermalice.The depositions, which sometimes survive toaccompany the indictments, show that the accuserestablished the witch's identity in one of a few"},{"pageNumber":1095,"pageContent":"standard ways. Usually the victim would recall athreat uttered by someone with whom he hadrecently quarrelled. He might even have nocturnalvisions of the witch, or cry out in his ɹts againsthis supposed persecutor. In 1653 the six-year-oldson of Edward Hodge, labourer, of Benenden,Kent, began to have strange attacks in the night,calling out, ‘Father! father! Here comes a blackhairy thing will tease and kill me.’ When he added,‘Bess Wood... she will kill me’, his parents knewthat he had been bewitched by Elizabeth Wood,who already had a reputation for witchcraft, andwho had recently quarrelled with the mother.57Possessed persons were often called on to namethe persons who had aʀicted them, and after alittle coaxing could usually be prevailed upon todo so. Thus in 1626 Edward Dynham fell into atrance, speaking in three diʃerent voices, in oneof which, after some encouragement, he revealedthe identity of the witches who were tormentinghim, and, he said, had already destroyed onevictim. The two accused persons, Edward Bull andJoan Creedie, were duly indicted at TauntonAssizes. Any doubt about their guilt was dissipatedwhen a gentlewoman, seized with a mysterious"},{"pageNumber":1096,"pageContent":"shaking in her side, cried out ‘Bull, Bull, Bull’.58More rarely, the sight of a toad or some apparentanimal familiar in the suspect's house might triggeroff an accusation;59 or the confession of one witchmight incriminate another.60But in many cases the victim, or his family, didnot identify the witch unaided. Instead theyinvoked the aid of a white witch – a cunning man,astrologer, or wise woman – who was believed topossess the magical skill necessary to identify thesource of misfortune. The client would go to thelocal wizard, describe his symptoms and invite adiagnosis. After having recourse to one of avariety of magical aids, the wizard would beexpected to pronounce as to whether or not thevictim was indeed bewitched, and indicate theidentity of the evil-doer. This might suggest thatthe responsibility for identiɹcation, and even forthe original suspicion of witchcraft, lay not withthe victim but with the wizard. In some cases thismay have been true. There certainly were cunningmen who planted suspicions of witchcraft wherenone had previously grown, and denouncedpersons who would not otherwise have beensuspected. Thus, it was said of William Walford of"},{"pageNumber":1097,"pageContent":"Cold Norton, Essex, in 1619 that ‘his order is, whenhe comes to visit any sick neighbour, to persuadethem that they are bewitched, and tells themwithal [that] except they will be of that belief theycan very hardly be holpen of their disease andsickness’.61 In the Warboys case the ɹrst mentionof witchcraft was by Dr Barrow of Cambridge, whoasked, after the failure of his original prescriptionsfor the aʀicted Throckmorton children, if thepossibility of sorcery or witchcraft had beenconsidered.62There can be little doubt that such personsencouraged accusations of witchcraft which mightotherwise never have been made. The twin beliefsin black witches and cunning men were integrallyconnected, the one propping up the other.Contemporaries rightly called them both ‘witches’:‘The one twineth; the other untwineth,’ said aHampshire man in 1532.63 Ursula Kemp, hangedat Chelmsford for witchcraft in 1582, hadprotested that ‘though she could unwitch, she couldnot witch’, while John Weemse later wrote that‘there are some witches which the common peoplecall the loosing witches, who do[es] no hurt at all,but remove[s] only that hurt which the binding"},{"pageNumber":1098,"pageContent":"witch lays on the sick person’.64 Anothercontemporary considered that the two operated ina sort of doctor-apothecary relationship: ‘the oneto torment the bodies both of man and beasts, thatanother may be sought unto to remedy the same;so one ever being a working instrument toanother’.65 It was in the cunning men's interest todiagnose witchcraft, after all, because they had anear-monopoly of techniques for dealing with it.In England, no less than in modern Africa, theconcept of witchcraft was dependent upon aparallel acceptance of witch-doctors and magic.Thomas Ady unhesitatingly listed the cunning menamong the causes of the belief in witchcraft. JohnBrinley thought that sundry honest persons hadbeen hurried to the gallows on their advice.66Yet the wizard's diagnosis of maleficium wouldnot have been acceptable unless the patienthimself had found it plausible; and when it cameto identifying the witch the evidence suggests thatthe client was fully capable of rejecting anysuggestions he did not welcome. All the wizard didwas to conɹrm the suspicions already present inthe client's mind, and strengthen his determinationto act upon them. Once again we may cite the"},{"pageNumber":1099,"pageContent":"anthropological studies which show how theAfrican diviner, despite his imposing apparatus ofmagical equipment, usually acts as a vehicle forthe expression of suspicions which have alreadybeen formulated by the client, and normally leavesit to him to put a name to the suspect. ‘In mostcases,’ writes an observer, ‘the majority of theinquirers have decided in their own minds who isguilty, and that person is named by the diviner.’Wizards of this kind, remarks another, are usually‘merely the mouthpiece of corporate hostilitytowards the suspected witch’. The verdicts of thewitch-detectors, says a third, must be ‘in line withgeneral expectations’.67 So far as one can tell, thiswas also the case in England. As when identifyingthieves, the wizard would show the client a mirroror a piece of polished stone, and ask if herecognized the face he saw in it. Or he might askthe client for a list of suspects, and carry out aseries of tests designed to isolate the guilty one,carefully watching for his customer's reaction aseach name was pronounced. A contemporarypreacher summarized the procedure: ‘A man istaken lame; he suspecteth that he is bewitched; hesendeth to the cunning man; he demandeth whomthey suspect, and then sheweth the image of the"},{"pageNumber":1100,"pageContent":"party in a glass.’68 But it was usually left to theclient to put a name to the guilty party. Around1630 the wise woman of Forton, Lancashire,conɹrmed John Willson's fears that he wasforspoken, but, when asked by whom, said, ‘shewould not tell for a thousand pounds’.69This is the point at which the historian can onlyenvy the anthropologist's ability to be present atsome of these critical moments, for full details ofthese clandestine consultations are inevitablylacking. But it does seem that the cunning manusually took care to ascertain who it was that theclient himself suspected. Thus in 1579 an ostler ofWindsor developed a back-ache after a quarrelwith an old woman, Mother Stile. When he wentto a wise man at Farnham, the wizard ‘told himthat he was bewitched, and that there were manyill women in Windsor, and asked him whom he didmistrust; and the said ostler answered,... “MotherStile”. “Well”, said the wise man, “if you can meether, and... scratch her, so that you draw blood ofher, you shall presently mend”.' In a mid-seventeenth-century case a worried motherconsulted a wizard, John Hutton, as to who wasthe cause of her child's illness. Back came the"},{"pageNumber":1101,"pageContent":"answer, via a servant: ‘Your mistress knows aswell who hath wronged her child as I.’70 It can beseen in both these cases how the function of thecunning man was to conɹrm the suspicions whichthe victim had already formed, and thus to createthe circumstances which were necessary to converta mere suspicion into a positive accusation. Theastrologer Lilly advised his colleagues to diagnosewitchcraft, only ‘in places were people aretroubled with witches’. The same was true ofwitchɹnders like John Darrell and MatthewHopkins. Darrell's accomplice, William Sommers,confessed that he only denounced as witches thosepersons who were already suspected as such.71The use of counter-magic could also presupposethe existence of some prior suspicion. One couldhardly burn thatch from a suspect's house withouthaving ɹrst decided who the suspect was. Suchtests would seldom lead to the accusation of anunexpected party. Usually they were self-conɹrming. It only needed the arrival of thesuspected neighbour, curious to ɹnd out what wasgoing on, for her guilt to be established. Once thewoman had appeared, there was little she could doto help herself. Protestations of innocence were of"},{"pageNumber":1102,"pageContent":"no avail. It was a bad sign if she inquired tooclosely about the patient's symptoms; and if, as agesture of good faith, she agreed to pray for thevictim's recovery, this was only taken as theattempt of the witch to lift her spell.72 If sheallowed the patient to scratch her, she ran the riskthat his subsequent recovery would establish herguilt; if she refused, then the conclusion to bedrawn was obvious. In the Warboys case LadyCromwell clipped oʃ a lock of Mother Samuel'shair so that it might be burned to relieve thebewitched children: ‘Madam, why do you use methus?’ complained the old woman, ‘I never did youany harm as yet’ – fatal admission.73From the initial accusation to the ɹnal judicialhearing, the procedure followed in the witch casesreminds us at every stage that men seldom seek ahigh degree of proof for what they already believeto be true. The position of the accused in the legalprocedure of the day was never comfortable,whatever his oʃence, but the standard of evidencerequired to secure a conviction for witchcraft wasparticularly unexacting. Seventeenth-centurydemonologists tried to raise it, but their attemptsto distinguish deɹnite ‘proofs’ from mere"},{"pageNumber":1103,"pageContent":"‘presumptions’ of this impossible crime inevitablyproved unsuccessful.74 At a popular level it waseasy to become convinced of any suspect's guilt. Ifshe were searched for the Devil's mark, her bodywas certain to oʃer some suitable mole orexcrescence; if not, then she must have cut it oʃ,or perhaps concealed it by magic; it was knownthat these marks could mysteriously come andgo.75 As for her familiar, that could be identiɹedthe moment a ɻy buzzed in through the window. Ifthe victim recovered after counter-magic had beenpractised, then the suspect's guilt wasdemonstrated.76 If the witch confessed, thatsettled the issue; if she refused to do so, she wasadding perjury to her other sins: like JennetDevice, whose protestations of innocence in 1612were deemed ‘a very fearful thing to all that werepresent, who knew she was guilty’.77Alone among accused persons, witches could besubjected to a brand of the old judicial ordeal.There was the popular version ‘swimming’ her tosee if she ɻoated, in which case she was guilty.This device was being used in witch cases inEngland by 1590. The water, as the instrument ofbaptism, would reject those who had renounced"},{"pageNumber":1104,"pageContent":"it.78 A more sophisticated test, often used in thecourts, was to require the suspect to repeat theLord's Prayer or a passage of Scripture. Anystumblings or omissions were taken as evidencethat the passage in question was unsympathetic tothe Devil, her master.79 The judge might evenrequire the witch to command the Devil to ceasetormenting his victim; if the patient recovered atthat moment, then it went ill with the accused.80Everything thus depended upon the prior attitudeof those trying the witch. If they were so disposed,it was hard for anyone to escape.81The basic problem, therefore, is that of how theinitial suspicion came to be formed. We have seenso far that the witch was a person already knownto her victim. If we supplement the laconicindictments with the more detailed depositions andpamphlet narratives, a further fact emerges abouther, and that is that she was always believed tobear some previous grudge against him. Obviousthough this may be, it does at least rule out thepossibility of motiveless malignity.Contemporaries may have been horriɹed by thewitch's activities, but they never denied that shehad some genuine reason for wishing ill upon her"},{"pageNumber":1105,"pageContent":"victim. So when the Throckmorton children ofWarboys blamed Alice Samuel for their ɹts, thebystanders at ɹrst refused to accept the charge,because they could think of no reason for hermalice.82A person who felt he had been bewitched would,therefore, identify the suspect by asking himselfwho might be likely to bear him a grudge. Usually,the misfortune had already occurred before menstarted thinking in this way, but sometimes theprior existence of some ill feeling would lead themto look out for the exercise of witchcraft. Thuswhen Elizabeth Foster, already suspected of witch-craft by the Fairfax family in 1621, touched theyounger daughter, her mother exclaimed almosttriumphantly, ‘Now if Bess Foster be a witch, thechild will ail.’83 Witch accusations required theexistence of prior animosities. Even the mostfraudulent charge needed to be bolstered up bysome suggestion of the accused person's malice if itwere to stand.There now arises the crucial question in thewhole analysis. Is it possible to generalize aboutthe sort of grudge which the witch was believed tobear towards her victim? Or was every conceivable"},{"pageNumber":1106,"pageContent":"type of animosity involved? The answer can onlybe extracted from those cases where thedepositions or pamphlet accounts are suɽcientlydetailed, and is therefore impossible to representstatistically. But close examination of those caseswhere the circumstances can be adequatelyreconstructed reveals that the charge was normallyonly levied when the accuser felt, not merely thatthe witch bore a grudge against him, but that thegrudge was a justifiable one. The witch, in otherwords, was not thought to be acting out of merevindictiveness; she was avenging a deɹnite injury.It was not just that victim and witch hadquarrelled. The important point is that,paradoxically, it tended to be the witch who wasmorally in the right and the victim who was in thewrong. This result corresponds with what manyanthropologists have found elsewhere.84There was a wide variety of ways in which thewitch might have been caused to take justiɹableoʃence. Sometimes the victim had refused to payher some legitimate debt which she had called tocollect. Thus, in Hertfordshire in 1659, whenFrances Rustat was ‘strangely handled with greatpain, racking and torment’, she ‘did often say..."},{"pageNumber":1107,"pageContent":"that if she died of that distemper... Goody Freewas the cause of her death’, adding signiɹcantlythat she had never been well after buying eggsfrom the old woman and denying her payment onthe excuse that she had no small change.85Similarly, when the London cunning woman JoanPeterson had cured Christopher Wilson in 1652, herefused to pay her the fee he had agreed,whereupon she prophesied correctly that he wouldget ten times worse; and in Yorkshire in 1632when Mary Atkinson refused to pay MargaretAwcock the money she owed her, the child she wasnursing duly fell ill.86 More direct assaults werealso followed by evil consequences. When JohnOrkton struck Mary Smith's son at King's Lynn in1616, he found himself growing ‘distempered instomach’, and his ɹngers and toes began to rot.When a servant snatched a pair of gloves from thepocket of Mother Nokes's daughter in Essex,around 1579, he suddenly lost the use of his limbsand was bedridden for eight days. When WilliamBeard of the same county was taken ill in 1651, itwas remembered that he had previously cut thetail oʃ Margaret Burgis's cat. After pursuingMargaret Simons's dog with a drawn knife, the"},{"pageNumber":1108,"pageContent":"fourteen-year-old son of the Elizabethan vicar ofBrenchley fell sick, until a white witch was foundto cure him.87 Unprovoked aggression against oldwomen and their dependants was thus thoughtlikely to invite magical retaliation, and many ofthe extant witch cases follow this same pattern, inwhich unreasonably injurious behaviour towardsthe witch is followed by a speedy vengeance.But the most common situation of all was that inwhich the victim (or, if he were an infant, thevictim's parents) had been guilty of a breach ofcharity or neighbourliness, by turning away an oldwoman who had come to the door to beg orborrow some food or drink, or the loan of somehousehold utensil. Thomas Ady described thehouseholder's likely reaction when somemisfortune followed on the heels of such anencounter:Presently he cryeth out of some poor innocentneighbour that he or she hath bewitched him. For,saith he, such an old man or woman came lately tomy door and desired some relief, and I denied it,and, God forgive me, my heart did rise againsther... and presently my child, my wife myself, myhorse, my cow, my sheep, my sow, my hog, my"},{"pageNumber":1109,"pageContent":"dog, my cat, or somewhat, was thus and thushandled in such a strange manner, as I dare swearshe is a witch, or else how should these thingsbe?88The overwhelmingly majority of fully documentedwitch cases fall into this simple pattern. The witchis sent away empty-handed, perhaps mumbling amalediction; and in due course something goeswrong with the household, for which she isimmediately held responsible. The requests madeby the witch varied, but they conformed to thesame general pattern.89 Usually they were forfood or drink – butter, cheese, yeast, milk or beer.Sometimes, she would ask to borrow money or apiece of equipment. In all cases denial was quicklyfollowed by retribution, and the punishment oftenɹtted the crime. When Robert Wayts refusedMother Palmer a pot of his beer in Suʃolk around1637, his servants could no longer make beerwhich would keep fresh. After Mary Ellins,daughter of an Evesham gardener, had thrownstones at Catherine Huxley in 1652, she began tovoid stones and continued doing so until the witchwas executed.90 At Castle Cary around 1530 Isabel"},{"pageNumber":1110,"pageContent":"Turner denied Christian Shirston a quart of ale,whereupon ‘a stand of ale of twelve gallons beganto boil as fast as a crock on the ɹre’. Joan Vicarswould give her no milk, and thereafter her cowyielded nothing but blood and water. Henry Russealso refused her milk, only to ɹnd himself unableto make cheese until Michaelmas.91A typical case was that of Margery Stanton ofWimbish, who was tried for witchcraft atChelmsford in 1579. During the hearing it emergedthat her ɹrst victim, Thomas Prat, had scratchedher face with a needle, and had been subsequentlyracked with aches and pains; later he snatched ahandful of grain from her and gave it to hischickens, most of whom promptly expired. RichardSaunder's wife had refused her yeast, whereuponher child was ‘taken vehemently sick, in amarvellous strange manner’. Robert Petie's wifehad her turned away from his house, and her childfell ill. William Torner denied her requests, and hischild was taken with a ɹt.

John Cornelldenied her requests, whereupon his cows yielded"},{"pageNumber":1111,"pageContent":"blood instead of milk. The vicar's wife turned heraway, and her little son became sick. Finally,Robert Lathbury refused her request, only to incurthe loss of twenty hogs.92These depressing peregrinations from door todoor, which were the background to theprosecution of Margery Stanton are typical of ahost of similar cases. They are not to be confusedwith vagrant begging, but illustrate the breakdownof the tradition of mutual help upon which manyEnglish village communities had been based. Theloan of equipment, or the giving of food or drink,were neighbourly activities, in the commoninterest. Lending and borrowing had long beenstandard features of community life: ‘The love ofthy neighbour shall stand thee in stead,’ ThomasTusser told the Tudor farmer. ‘No man of ability islong free from poor coming to his door,’ thoughtAdy in 1655.93 Margery Stanton's requests weretypical enough; what was distinctive about themwas that they were consistently refused. The factthat she should be accused of witch-craft, by thevery people who had failed to fulɹl their acceptedsocial obligations to her, illustrates the essentialconɻict between neighbourliness and"},{"pageNumber":1112,"pageContent":"individualism which generated the tensions fromwhich the accusations of witchcraft were mostlikely to arise. Margery's neighbours were denyingher the charity and help which was traditionallyrequired. When shutting the door in her face,however, they were only too well aware of havingdeparted from the accepted ethical code. Theyknew that they had put their selɹsh interestsbefore their social duty. When some minoraccident subsequently overtook them or theirchildren or animals, it was their own guiltyconscience which indicated to them where theyshould look for the cause of their misfortune.Refusal of alms was the most characteristic wayin which the witch's supposed victims had failed intheir obligations towards her; many of the accusedpersons, as Scot pointed out, were women in thehabit of going ‘from house to house, and from doorto door for a pot full of milk, yeast, drink, pottage,or some such relief, without which they couldhardly live’.94 But there were other possiblesources of conɻict. Witch cases could arise afterdisputes over gleaning, common land, rights ofway, or trespass.95 Witches were accused ofretaliation against such local tyrants as the village"},{"pageNumber":1113,"pageContent":"constable who pressed their sons to be soldiers, orthe overseer of the poor who put their childreninto compulsory service.96 Joan Pechey, tried atChelmsford in 1582, had fallen out with the poorrelief collector who doled her out what sheconsidered to be inferior bread.97The conɻict between neighbourliness and agrowing sense of private property is clearly seenin the case of Margaret Harkett, a sixty-year-oldwidow of Stanmore, Middlesex, who was executedat Tyburn in 1585. She had picked a basketful ofpeas in a neighbour's ɹeld without permission.Asked to return them, she ɻung them down inanger; since when, no peas would grow in theɹeld. Later, William Goodwin's servants denied heryeast, whereupon his brewing-stand dried up. Shewas struck by a bailiʃ who had caught her takingwood from his master's ground; the bailiʃ wentmad. A neighbour refused her a horse; all hishorses died. Another paid her less for a pair ofshoes than she asked; later he died. A gentlemantold his servants to refuse her buttermilk; afterwhich they were unable to make butter orcheese.98Another cause of oʃence was a failure to invite"},{"pageNumber":1114,"pageContent":"the witch to some common celebration. In thevillage community a man had a social duty toinvite his neighbours to participate in hischristenings, funerals, sheep-shearings or harvesthomes. Guests attended such occasions as of right,and it was a positive slight to refuse an invitationto anyone who was eligible. When Anne Kerke ofBroken Wharf, London, was oʃered no share ofthe traditional doles for the poor at the funeral in1599 of Anne Naylor (for whose mysterious deathshe was supposed to have been responsible) shewas sorely ‘vexed that she had none, being aparishioner’, and accordingly directed her magicalpractices against a member of the family.99 In1570 an Essex witness deposed against oneMalter's wife, that he, ‘having a sheep-shearing,about this time, and not inviting her thereto, beinghis neighbour, she, as he supposed, bewitched twoof his sheep; for immediately after they were takenwith sickness’.100 When Jane Milburne pointedlyfailed to ask Dorothy Strangers to her wed-wingsupper at Newcastle in 1663, the justly aggrievedDorothy declared she would make her repent it;Jane was subsequently plagued by severalmysterious cats, whom she knew at once to be"},{"pageNumber":1115,"pageContent":"Dorothy in supernatural disguise.101 The classicmalevolence of the wicked fairy sprang from thefailure of the Sleeping Beauty's parents to inviteher to the christening.Witchcraft could also be a justiɹed response toother kinds of uncalled-for behaviour. When JaneSlade, one of Sir Richard Napier's patients, foundherself stricken by a mysterious disease in 1634,her ɹrst reaction was to suspect Joan Bruce's son,a former suitor, whom she had jilted in favour ofanother. It is a reasonable guess that she feltherself to have behaved badly towards him.102Other typical victims of witchcraft included thegaoler's man who chained old Mother Samuel ofWarboys to a bedpost, the Earl of Rutland, whodismissed Margaret Flower from her post inBelvoir Castle, the drunkard in Royston alehousewho persistently abused Mother Stokes, and allthose persons who had oʃensively taunted oldwomen with being witches, only to find themselvesstruck down as a result.103 In such cases remorsewas an indispensable ingredient, if not in bringingabout the misfortune, then at least in providingthe victim with an explanation for its occurrence.Even in the accusations stirred up by Matthew"},{"pageNumber":1116,"pageContent":"Hopkins, the same factors were present; thewitches may have been formally accused of devil-worship, but the witnesses against them tended tobe victims who had treated them ungenerously inone way or another.104Two essential features thus made up thebackground to most of the allegations of witchcraftlevied in sixteenth- and seventeenth-centuryEngland. The ɹrst was the occurrence of apersonal misfortune for which no naturalexplanation was immediately forthcoming. Thesecond was an awareness on the victim's part ofhaving given oʃence to a neighbour, usually byhaving failed to discharge some hitherto customarysocial obligation. As often as not, the link betweenthe misfortune incurred and the obligationneglected was furnished by the frank expression ofmalignity on the part of the suspected witch. Thuswhen Thomas Harrison and his wife of Ellel,Lancashire, turned the old widow, JennetWilkinson, out of her house around 1620, she cameand cursed them bitterly, saying, ‘Hearest thou,hearest thou (clapping her hands together),... thisshall be forty pounds loss to thee’, and in duecourse some of their animals were taken sick and"},{"pageNumber":1117,"pageContent":"died.105 Of course such threats were sometimesuttered when the witch was technically more in thewrong than her victims, as for example, when shewould not pay her debts, or her rent; when sheasked for credit; or when she was caughttrespassing or stealing.106 But always there wasthe clear innuendo that, if only the victim hadbeen kindlier, more charitable, less disposed tostand on his property rights, more understandingof the plight of the weak, the quarrel would nothave occurred.In many cases, moreover, it was not necessaryfor the suspected witch to have given evidence ofher malevolence. The victim's guilty consciencecould alone be suɽcient to provoke an accusation,since when a misfortune occurred his ɹrst reactionwas to ask what he had done to deserve it. WhenWilliam Hoppgood's young pigs behavedpeculiarly in 1589, he recalled how, on theprevious day, Widow Wells had come to his dooron two occasions, ‘there sitting, asking nothing; atlength having not anything given unto her [onemay note his assumption that something shouldhave been], she departed from thence’. On thebasis of this coincidence he warned her that, ‘if he"},{"pageNumber":1118,"pageContent":"took any hurt by her afterwards, he would haveher burned for a witch’. It is clear enough fromHoppgood's account of this incident that the sourceof the witchcraft was his own troubledconscience.107 A similar case was that of ElizabethJackson, convicted of bewitching Mary Glover in1602. The old woman had passed by the door,where the girl was eating a new wheaten loaf. She‘looked earnestly upon Mary, but, speakingnothing, passed by; and yet instantly returned,and with the like look and silence departed. Atwhich doing the bread which she was chewing fellout of Mary Glover's mouth, and herself fellbackwards oʃ the stool where she sat, into agrievous ɹt’.108 The Harrison couple who turnedJennet Wilkinson out of her house had been cursedby the widow, but it was their own hard conductwhich explained why the wife was unable to restat night, because of her conviction that ‘the saidJennet was at the bed's side disquieting her’.109A similar instance of how the relatively securemight be haunted by their ill-treament of the pooris furnished by Dinah Wiɽn's statement, made atBedford in 1680, that she"},{"pageNumber":1119,"pageContent":"several times, upon the sight of John Wright in thestreet and at her door a-begging, fell a-tremblingat the sight of him; and, being forbidden by herhusband to give him anything, she did forbear, andhath not given him anything above twice or thricesince about a fortnight after Michaelmas last; andshe saith that within three or four months last pastshe hath in her dreams several times seen therepresentation of (or imagined she hath seen) thesaid John Wright stand by her bed-side, andsometimes when she hath been awake.

Thiswas why it was very unusual for large-scaledisasters, like famine, plague or ɹre, to be blamedon a witch. For in a witch-case the suspect wasusually a person who had been involved in arelationship of real or presumed hostility towardsthe victim. But the victim of an epidemic or a ɻoodwas not an individual or a family, but a wholecommunity. To be plausibly suspected of bringingabout such a disaster, it would be necessary tostand in a relationship of hostility, not to this orthat individual, but to the community as a whole.The guilty party could only be someone whomeverybody was conscious of having ill-treated. Anold woman might conceivably be the enemy of asmall community, as some of the arson cases show.But she was hardly a suitable adversary for a cityor a whole nation. Any scapegoat had to be foundelsewhere: sometimes in a ɹfth-column ofFrenchmen, Catholics, or similar national enemies,but usually in the sins of the people, and theirmisconduct towards, not an individual beggar, butGod himself. Those seeking to establish a linkbetween guilt and misfortune had, therefore, to"},{"pageNumber":1121,"pageContent":"regard such large-scale disasters as acts of God,rather than as the maleficia of witches.The incidence of plague, for example, was tooindiscriminate to be plausibly explained inpersonal terms. It is true that the idea of biologicalwarfare was familiar, and individuals weresometimes accused of spreading infection bynatural means.111 The Scots were said to havepoisoned the wells at Newcastle in 1639. Bottles ofinfected air were rumoured to have been broughtin from France in 1665. The Catholics, whosesorcery was thought to have been responsible forthe Oxford gaol fever of 1577, were reported in1641 to have sent a plague-sore in an envelope toJohn Pym.112 It was also possible to identify theJonah who had brought down such a judgement;when plague struck Barnstaple in 1646 someinhabitants blamed the local Independentcongregation and wanted its members turned outof town.113 But, although epidemics weresometimes thought to have been stimulated bynational enemies, they played virtually no part infostering accusations of witchcraft.Neither were ɹres blamed upon witches, savethose cases where the outbreak destroyed one"},{"pageNumber":1122,"pageContent":"individual's property, but not that of the wholecommunity. It was possible for Richard Rosse ofLittle Clapton, Essex, to blame Henry Celles in1582 because his barn had mysteriously caughtfire,114 but out of the question for anyone toattribute the wholesale destruction of Tiverton orNorthampton to a similar cause. The storm at seawhich aʃected a single ship might sometimes beattributed to witchcraft,115 but on land the actionof a tempest was usually too indiscriminate forsuch an interpretation to be plausible. Stormswhich handicapped one of two sides in battlewere, of course, a diʃerent matter.116 Witch-beliefs, in other words, did not explain misfortunein general, but only in particular. The fear ofwitches was not normally interchangeable with thefear of Catholics or Jews. It had an altogetherdiʃerent social function. An accusation ofwitchcraft originated with someone living in closeproximity to the suspect, and was meant toexplain some local and personal misfortune. ThePopish bogey, by contrast, concerned nationaldangers, and did not arise out of a personalrelationship. Only if witches were conceived of incontinental fashion as a devil-worshipping sect,"},{"pageNumber":1123,"pageContent":"did it become plausible to regard them as enemiesof society in general, like the Catholics, and henceto blame them for storms or plagues, in the waythat sometimes happened in Europe.117It was, therefore, the prior involvement of thevictim in a hostile relationship which madecontemporaries invoke witchcraft as theexplanation of a misadventure. Without thatinvolvement, no misfortune, however mysterious,could be so explained. With it, even the mostnatural occurrence might appear sinister. WhenThomas and Elizabeth Baxter of Newton-in-Mackerɹeld, Lancashire, failed to have childrenwho survived, they blamed it in 1636 upon thewitchcraft of Joan Elderson; they did not do thisbecause infant mortality was unusual, for it wasnot, but because they knew that it was her sonwho stood to inherit their house if they had nodirect heirs; and she had already prevented themfrom trying to buy out his rights.1183. Witchcraft and societyWitch-beliefs are therefore of interest to the socialhistorian for the light they throw upon the weak"},{"pageNumber":1124,"pageContent":"points in the social structure of the time.Essentially the witch and her victim were twopersons who ought to have been friendly towardseach other, but were not.119 They existed in astate of concealed hostility for which societyprovided no legitimate outlet. They could not takeeach other to law; neither could they have recourseto open violence. In Africa accusations ofwitchcraft frequently spring from conɻicts withinthe family, for example, between the co-wives of apolygamous husband.120 But in England the witchand her accuser were very seldom related. Thetensions which such accusations usually reɻectedarose from the position of the poor and dependentmembers of the community. The charges ofwitchcraft were a means of expressing deep-feltanimosities in acceptable guise. Before awitchcraft accusation could be plausibly made, thesuspect had to be in a socially or economicallyinferior position to her supposed victim. Only thencould she be presumed to be likely to have hadrecourse to magical methods of retaliation, for,had she been the stronger party, more directmethods of revenge would have been at herdisposal. This is why there are hardly any cases in"},{"pageNumber":1125,"pageContent":"which the witch was socially more elevated thanthe victim;121 and why witches tended to be poor.It may be that it was easier to pin an accusationon a poor man because he was less able to defendhimself.122 But the essential reason was that thepoor man was the one most likely to ɹnd himselfin the social situation from which witchcraftaccusations sprang.The great bulk of witchcraft accusations thusreɻected an unresolved conɻict between theneighbourly conduct required by the ethical codeof the old village community, and the increasinglyindividualistic forms of behaviour whichaccompanied the economic changes of thesixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Of course,there has never been a time when there was noconɻict between the needs of the individual andthe demands of charity. It would certainly bewrong to think that there were no such diɽcultiesand conɻicts in the medieval village. But suchtensions as there were then had to ɹnd some otheroutlet, for, as we have seen, it was only theReformation which, by taking away the protectiveritual of Catholicism, made witchcraft appear aserious danger to ordinary people."},{"pageNumber":1126,"pageContent":"Moreover, there is some reason to think thatduring the Tudor and Stuart period these villageconɻicts grew particularly acute. The old manorialsystem had done much to cater for widows andelderly persons by a built-in system of poor relief.The widow enjoyed the right of freebench, that is,of succession to a portion of her late husband'sholding, ranging from a quarter to the whole,according to local manorial custom. Should she beincapable of cultivating it herself, she couldsurrender it to a younger member of the family inreturn for a guarantee of maintenance. This was amore generous arrangement than the ordinarycommon law rules for succession to rent-payingland, by which the widow's dower was limited to athird.123 There were also various local customaryprivileges of the poor, varying from the right ofthree days of gleaning before the stubble wasgiven over to pasture (conceded at some pointbefore the eighteenth century, but taken away in alegal judgement of 1787), to permission to sleep inthe church if they had no otheraccommodation.124The decline of the manorial system has not yetbeen charted by modern historians, and the"},{"pageNumber":1127,"pageContent":"working of the laws of inheritance also awaitsfuller study. But it seems clear that this period sawthe decay of many of these traditionalarrangements. Population pressure eroded manyof the old customary tenancies, and led to thetaking in of the commons and the rise ofcompetitive rents. These changes weredisadvantageous to the widow. So were theenclosures and engrossing which broke up many ofthe old cooperative village communities. Thisdeterioration in the position of the dependent andelderly helps to explain why witches wereprimarily women, and probably old ones, many ofthem widowed. ‘They are usually such as aredestitute of friends, bowed down with years, ladenwith inɹrmities,’ said a contemporary.125 Theirnames appear among the witchcraft indictments,just as they do among the recipients of parochialrelief.126 For they were the persons mostdependent upon neighbourly support.At the same time as the position of the poorermembers of the community was being exacerbated,the old tradition of mutual charity and help wasbeing eroded by such new economic developmentsas land hunger, the rise in prices, the development"},{"pageNumber":1128,"pageContent":"of agricultural specialisation and the growth oftowns and commercial values. These trends wereaccompanied by the disappearance of some of theold mechanisms for resolving village conɻictswhich had been provided by the manorial courtsand by the religious gilds.127 Manycontemporaries believed that theirs was a time ofdisintegration, by contrast with the vanishedharmony of the Middle Ages. Robert Burton, forexample, attributed the unprecedented volume oflitigation to the decay of the old social bonds: ‘nocharity, love, friendship, fear of God, alliance,aɽnity, consanguinity, Christianity, can containthem’.128Much more historical research will be neededbefore we can see comments of this kind in theirproper perspective, and distinguish genuine socialanalysis from a fuzzy nostalgia for someimaginary merry England. But there was oneinnovation of the sixteenth century which didundoubtedly sap the old tradition of mutualcharity, and that was the national Poor Law,created by a series of Tudor statutes which set upoverseers of the poor, charged with levying a rateand making provision for the dependent members"},{"pageNumber":1129,"pageContent":"of the parish. Nothing did more to make the moralduties of the householder ambiguous. On the onehand the State forbade indiscriminate begging; onthe other it continued to uphold the responsibilityof the inhabitants of each parish for their ownpoor, even allowing begging within the parish, ifpermitted by the overseers. The clergy from thepulpit continued to insist on the moral duty ofcharity, although many local authorities nowforbade householders to give alms at the door.129In Tudor times the national system was onlyinvoked at times of special emergency, and theloan of food and equipment to neighbourscontinued in many places to be essential for theroutine maintenance of the elderly and inɹrm. Itwas probably as important a means of poor reliefas the public levies of the poor rate, or the greatprivate benefactions; not for nothing did JohnHales describe godly charity as the sinews whichheld the Commonwealth together.130This uneasy conjunction of public and privatecharity exacerbated the uncertainty with whichcontemporaries viewed the poor. They hated themas a burden to the community and a threat topublic order. But they also recognised that it was"},{"pageNumber":1130,"pageContent":"their Christian duty to give them charity when nopublic relief was forthcoming. The conɻictbetween resentment and a sense of obligationproduced the ambivalence which made it possiblefor men to turn begging women brusquely fromthe door, and yet suʃer torments of conscienceafter having done so.131 This ensuing guilt wasfertile ground for witch-craft accusations; anysubsequent misfortunes could be seen as retaliationon the part of the witch, and class hatredconstituted a major stimulus to her prosecution.The tensions which produced witchcraftprosecution at the popular level – and it should beemphasised that these conɻicts were not betweenthe very rich and the very poor, but between fairlypoor and very poor - were the tensions of a societywhich no longer held a clear view as to how or bywhom its dependent members should bemaintained.In these circumstances, witch-beliefs helped touphold the traditional obligations of charity andneighbourliness at a time when other social andeconomic forces were conspiring to weaken them.The fear of retaliation by witchcraft was apowerful deterrent against breaking the old moral"},{"pageNumber":1131,"pageContent":"code, for to display a lack of generosity to one'sneighbours was the quickest way of getting hurt.Witches, it was rightly said, could not harm folkwho were liberal to the poor, and the mostChristian preservative against witchcraft was to becharitable.132 When overtaken by a disaster,thought Thomas Ady, we should not ask ourselves,‘“What old man or woman was last at my door,that I may hang him or her for a witch?”... Weshould rather say, “Because I did not relieve such apoor body that was lately at my door, but gavehim harsh and bitter words, therefore God hathlaid this affliction upon me.”’133 This fitted in wellwith the clergy's teaching that men who helped thepoor would prosper themselves, and thatcovetousness did not pay.Conversely, an old woman's reputation forwitchcraft might be her last line of defence,ensuring that she was decently treated by herfellow-villagers. An essayist wrote of A Witch(1615) that ‘a very noble-man's request may bedenied more safely than her petitions forbuttermilk and small beer’. He was echoingReginald Scot, who had noticed how ‘thesemiserable wretches are so odious unto all their"},{"pageNumber":1132,"pageContent":"neighbours, and so feared as few dare oʃendthem, or deny them anything they ask’.134 One ofthe characters in George Giʃord's Dialogueconcerning Witches (1593) observes of a suspect: ‘Ihave been as careful to please her as ever I was toplease mine own mother, and to give her everanon one thing or other.’ We give them charity‘that they may not hurt us’, said ThomasCooper.135The records conɹrm the evidence of thepamphleteers on this point. ‘I am loathe todisplease my neighbour Alldridge,’ said anElizabethan husbandman in 1580, ‘for I can neverdisplease him, but I have one mischance oranother amongst my cattle.’136 In Devonshire in1565 Edward Goodridge advised a neighbour notto pursue a lawsuit against the suspected witchAlse Martyn, ‘because he knew what harm shecould do’.137 In the great Lancashire witch-trial of1612 it was revealed that Jennet Device had beentaught a charm by her mother ‘to get drink’; thatno one could escape the fury of ElizabethSouthernes (‘Old Demdike’), if he gave her family‘any occasion of oʃence, or denied them any thingthey stood need of’; and that John Device had been"},{"pageNumber":1133,"pageContent":"so afraid of being bewitched by the aged crone,Anne Chattox, that he had covenanted to pay her ayearly dole of meal, on condition that she hurtneither him nor his goods; on his death-bed he wasconvinced that he had been bewitched because thelatest instalment had been left unpaid.138 InJacobean Yorkshire Elizabeth Fletcher, ‘a womannotoriously famed for a witch,... had so powerful ahand over the wealthiest neighbours about her,that none of them refused to do anything sherequired; yea, unbesought they provided her withɹre and meat from their own tables’.139 InFlintshire during the Protectorate, Anne Ellis livedby begging and knitting stockings, for whichpeople were prepared to over-pay her, out of fearof her witchcraft.140 In Hampshire in 1575Thomas Gooter knew that old Mother Hunt was awitch, because, he said, ‘I can no sooner shake apig of hers or pound her cattle but presently eitherI or my master have a shrewd turn.’141 So long asthe belief in witchcraft survived, it had a semi-protective character for those who were thought topossess this magical power. As the Chartist,William Lovett, recalled from his Cornishchildhood, a reputed witch was treated with"},{"pageNumber":1134,"pageContent":"respect in the village. ‘Anything that Aunt Tammytook a fancy to, few who feared her dared torefuse.’142Witch-beliefs thus discharged a function in earlymodern England similar to that which theyperform in many primitive societies today. Theyreinforced accepted moral standards bypostulating that a breach in the norms ofneighbourly behaviour would be followed byrepercussions in the natural order. They were acheck on the expression of vicious feelings by boththe likely witch and her prospective victim. AsProfessor Evans-Pritchard has written of theAzande, ‘their belief in witchcraft is a valuablecorrective to uncharitable impulses, because ashow of spleen or meanness or hostility may bringserious consequences in its train’.143 Witch-beliefs,like the belief in divine providence, were amanifestation of the same assumption that thelikely cause of material misfortune was to befound in some breach of moral behaviour.From this point of view witch-beliefs may befairly described as ‘conservative social forces’,144upholding the norms of village life. But they couldalso have a more radical function. For, although"},{"pageNumber":1135,"pageContent":"most contemporaries warned men to be charitable,so as to avoid supernatural retaliation, there wereothers who stressed that it was dangerous to giveanything to a suspected witch, and advised thatshe be ostracised by the community.145 A witchwho was known to be such could be subject toviolence and harsh treatment. Jane Wen-ham wasdescribed in 1712 as ‘a poor woman that has livedfor six-teen years under the character of a witch,and by this means... be-come so odious to all herneighbours as to be deny'd in all probability thecommon necessaries of life... The more ɹrmly herneighbours believed her to be a witch,... the worsethey would use her.’146These two diʃerent ways of treating a witchwere not really inconsistent, for it was only theperson suspected of witchcraft who was to beturned away; and such a suspicion was unlikely toarise so long as men were neighbourly andcharitable. Witch-beliefs, in other words, upheldthe conventions of charity and neighbourliness,but once these conventions had broken down theyjustiɹed the breach and made it possible for theuncharitable to divert attention from their ownguilt by focusing attention on that of the witch."},{"pageNumber":1136,"pageContent":"Meanwhile, she would be deterred from knockingat any more unfriendly doors, for fear of swellingthe ranks of her accusers. In England, as in Africa,the belief in witches could thus help dissolve‘relations which have become redundant’.147It is not claimed that this interpretation will ɹtevery accusation of witchcraft which occurredduring the period. In the majority of prosecutionsthe surviving evidence is too slight for us to knowwhether it does not. But where the evidence isreasonably full the kind of relationship betweenwitch and accuser which has been outlined canusually be inferred. The model can also be appliedto many Continental accusations, and to some ofthe witchcraft allegations made in NewEngland.148 But it does not need to be supportedfrom evidence from these other environments,since there is in principle no reason why the socialcontext of witchcraft accusations should have beenthe same in different societies.In England other subsidiary factors were alsosometimes involved.

Mostdemonologists taught that white witches couldimpose spells as well as lift them, and manycunning folk found themselves accused ofmaleɹcent witchcraft.149 Some contemporarysources also suggest that physical abnormalitiescould be relevant. One popular handbookspeciɹcally warned its readers to ‘beware of allpersons that have default of members naturally, asof foot, hand eye, or other member; one that iscrippled; and especially of a man that hath not abeard’.150 Witchcraft accusations might be leviedagainst the ‘old woman with a wrinkled face, afurr'd brow, a hairy lip, a gobbler tooth, a squinteye, a squeaking voice, or a scolding tongue’, asJohn Gaule put it.151 Men sometimes claimed torecognize witches by their appearance, as didNicholas Widgier, wheelwright of St Dunstan's,Kent, who was convinced in 1651 that the brewer'swife, Dorothy Rawlins, was a witch, because ‘shehad the eyes of the witches [who] were hanged atFaversham’. ‘How often,’ thought Thomas Potts in1613, ‘will the common people say, “Her eyes aresunk in her head; God bless us from her.”’152 Itwas proverbial that bearded women were likely to"},{"pageNumber":1138,"pageContent":"be witches, and physical ugliness or deformitycould thus awaken suspicion.153But when witch accusations permit of closeexamination they reveal that it was the suspect'sconduct and social situation, rather than herphysical appearance, which led to her downfall.Even the last item on John Gaule's list of personalcharacteristics – ‘a scolding tongue’ – is a socialphenomenon, not a physical one. MatthewHopkins's ɹrst victim was one-legged, but it washer consequent dependence upon the support ofothers, not her physical deformity as such, whichlay behind her downfall.154 The same is true ofmost of the other ugly old women who were seenas witches. There is no evidence that their physicalappearance was relevant to the accusation. Suchconsiderations were very seldom mentioned in thedepositions. Moral deviations – illegitimacy, sexualpromiscuity – may perhaps have been slightlymore relevant, but no more so than in theidentiɹcation of any other type of criminal.155The nature of the surviving evidence makes itquite impossible to assess the role of either factorwith any precision. But it is clear that neither wasin any way essential."},{"pageNumber":1139,"pageContent":"Nor does it seem necessary to look for apsychological or psychoanalytic explanation of thefact that the majority of accused witches werewomen. This aspect of the trials is more plausiblyexplained by economic and social considerations,for it was the women who were the mostdependent members of the community, and thusthe most vulnerable to accusation. It is true thatthis aspect of the subject fascinated contemporarydemonologists, who readily enlarged upon thedeɹciencies of the weaker sex and their greatersusceptibility to Satan. Undoubtedly there was astrong anti-feminist streak about such monkishfantasies as the Malleus maleɹcarum, where thetheme of diabolic copulation and the lore of incubiand succubi were thoroughly explored. But inEngland the more blatant sexual aspects ofwitchcraft were a very uncommon feature of thetrials, save perhaps in the Hopkins period.

The topic inspired a continuous ɻow ofcontroversial writing, it is true. But the argumentsemployed on either side hardly changed at all.What has to be explained is why it should havetaken over a hundred years for the case urged bythe sceptics to become generally acceptable.The sceptical argument was not necessarilylinked to any new assumptions about the naturalworld. On the contrary much of the debate wasdeliberately conducted within a framework ofProtestant fundamentalism. The leading scepticalwriters – Reginald Scot, Samuel Harsnet, SirRobert Filmer, Thomas Ady, John Wagstaʃe, JohnWebster, Francis Hutchinson - all urged that the‘continental’ conception of witchcraft as devil-worship was unacceptable because it had noBiblical justiɹcation. This type of witchcraft wasnot to be found in the Scriptures, and, as Websteremphasized, ‘What the Scriptures have notrevealed of the power of the kingdom of Satan isto be rejected and not to be believed.’1 Of course,there was Exodus, xxii, 18, which declared that awitch should not be suʃered to live. This was thetext which led John Wesley to assert that ‘giving"},{"pageNumber":1144,"pageContent":"up witchcraft is, in eʃect, giving up the Bible’. Butthe sceptics urged that these Old Testamentwitches had not been devil-worshippers; they weremerely wizards and diviners; and the harm theydid their enemies was by the use of poisons andsimilar natural means. Most of them were frauds,who deserved punishment for their impostures, butwere incapable of making a corporal pact withSatan. The modern myth of devil-worship, with itsnight-ɻying and its sabbaths, was a grossinvention of ‘friarly authors’, an amalgam ofPapal fabrication with ancient pagansuperstition.2 In elaborating this theme thesceptics were essentially continuing the traditionalProtestant onslaught upon the relics of paganismto be found in the teachings and practice of theRoman Church.But in arguing that the popular image of Satanlacked scriptural foundation, the sceptics couldalso draw powerful reinforcement from a newcurrent in contemporary philosophy. Materialists,like Thomas Hobbes and the followers ofDescartes, rejected the whole concept ofincorporeal substances as a contradiction in terms.By doing so they eʃectively jettisoned demons"},{"pageNumber":1145,"pageContent":"from the natural world. Hobbes did not deny thatthere could be spirits whose bodies were too fine tobe perceived by human beings. But heemphatically asserted that they could never becapable of possessing men's bodies or assuminghuman form. Most demons, he declared, were ‘butidols or phantasms of the brain’. Locke did not saythat there were no spirits, but he thought itimpossible to arrive at any certain knowledge ofthem.3 For the opponents of witchcraftprosecution it was a cardinal tenet that the Devilhad no temporal power; he could not assumebodily form and his assaults were purelyspiritual.4 Since Satan was a relativelyinconspicuous ɹgure in the Old Testament, aplausible case for this view could be made onpurely Biblical grounds. Several of the religioussects of the Interregnum were to encourage thismode of thinking. Lodowick Muggleton stressedthat devils had no bodily existence but weremerely evil thoughts in men's minds.5 The Rantersalso interpreted the Devil symbolically; herepresented suppressed desires and was notliterally a person or creature.6By the end of the seventeenth century this"},{"pageNumber":1146,"pageContent":"interpretation was becoming more acceptable inorthodox circles. Sir Isaac Newton thought that evilspirits were mere desires of the mind. Devils mayhave had physical powers before the coming ofChristianity, declared Bishop Stillingɻeet, but menwho accepted the Gospel were no longer capableof receiving any hurt from them in their persons,children or goods.7 The metaphoricalinterpretation of the demonic possessions in theNew Testament was also gaining ground. ‘To havea devil’, explained a writer in 1676, ‘was a kind ofphrase or form of speech.’8 These trends wereemphasized by the decline of Hell – the tendencyof many seventeenth-century intellectuals toquestion the existence of Hell as a localized placeof physical torment, and to re-interpret itsymbolically as a state of mind, an inner hell.9 Aslate as the nineteenth century it was still possiblefor an ecclesiastical court to rule that a man whodenied the personality of the Devil was to bedeemed a ‘notorious evil liver’. But this opinionwas reversed by the Judicial Committee of thePrivy Council; and according to the twentieth-century Encyclopaedia Britannica, ‘it may beconɹdently aɽrmed that belief in Satan is not"},{"pageNumber":1147,"pageContent":"now generally regarded as an essential article ofthe Christian faith’.10 But the mere banishment ofthe Devil to his infernal kingdom had in itself beenenough to refute the possibility that witches mightmake compacts with him, save in their minds;even if an old woman wanted to give herself to theDevil, there could be no prospect of her gainingany influx of supernatural power as a result.Those inɻuenced by these theological currents ofthought thus came to think it increasinglyimprobable that God could ever have allowedwitches to exercise any supernatural power, orhave intended that they should be persecuted forsupposedly doing so. The standard scepticalposition was well deɹned by Reginald Scot in hisDiscoverie of Witchcraft (1584), and did not changemuch thereafter. All witches, said Scot, came inone of four categories. First there were theinnocent, falsely accused out of malice orignorance. Next came the deluded: malevolent,half-crazed persons, who had convincedthemselves that they were in league with the Deviland made absurd confessions to that eʃect, butwho were actually incapable of harming anyone.Thirdly, there were the genuinely maleɹcent"},{"pageNumber":1148,"pageContent":"witches, who injured their neighbours secretly, notby supernatural means, however, but by the use ofpoison. Finally, there were the cozeners andimpostors, the wizards and charmers who gulledcountry folk by falsely pretending to heal diseases,tell fortunes or ɹnd lost goods. These last twocategories were the witches who the Bible had saidshould not be allowed to live. To this extent,therefore, Scot admitted the existence of ‘witches’.But he was certain that none of them could havemade a corporal pact with the Devil or succeededin harming her neighbours by supernatural means.He was all for the prosecution of the cunning menand wise women. But he was implacably opposedto putting old women to death for being guilty ofan impossibility.11At the time Scot's work was said to have made ‘agreat impression in the magistracy and also in theclergy’. It was not reprinted in England until 1651,but it nevertheless had a considerable inɻuence.Elizabethan sceptics, like Samuel Harsnet and thephysician John Harvey, drew heavily upon it intheir published writings, and there is evidence tosuggest that its arguments were familiar amongthe educated laity. The Kentish sceptic, Henry"},{"pageNumber":1149,"pageContent":"Oxinden, for example, rehearsed them fluently in aprivate letter of 1641.12 Even the supporters ofthe belief accepted much of what Scot had to sayon the subject of counterfeits. But most members ofthe educated classes remained slow to accept thefull implications of his thesis. ‘Many deny witchesat all, or, if there be any, they can do no harm,’wrote Robert Burton in 1621, ‘but on the contraryare most lawyers, divines, physicians,philosophers.’ Scot's position remained that of aself-conscious minority. Many contemporariesregarded it as tantamount to atheism to deny thereality of spirits or the possibility of supernaturalintervention in daily aʃairs.13 It was certainly amore rigid position than that actually adopted bythe judges and jurymen who brought the witch-trials to an end. So far as can be told, they werenot motivated by any coherent ideology of thiskind. Their attitude was more modest. Whatinɻuenced them was not a denial of the possibilityof witchcraft as such, but a heightened sense of thelogical diɽculty of proving it to be at work in anyparticular case.This was a diɽculty of which everyone had longbeen aware. Not even the most zealous witch-"},{"pageNumber":1150,"pageContent":"hunter had ever said that all misfortunes were thework of witches. On the contrary the leadingauthorities always stressed that allegations ofwitchcraft were not to be made before otherpossible explanations of the apparent maleficiumhad been considered: it might be an act of God; itmight be the direct work of the Devil without theintervention of a witch; it might be the result ofimposture; or it might have purely natural causes.All these possibilities were to be carefullyinvestigated before a witch-craft accusation waslevied.14 But this advice posed two perplexingquestions. How was one to distinguish witchcraftfrom all the other possible causes? And how wasone to know for certain the identity of the witch?In order to distinguish maleficium from naturalillness the demonologists listed various criteria.These usually boiled down to saying that thedisease should have supernatural symptomsincapable of natural explanation; as, for example,when a possessed person displayed superhumanstrength or spoke ɻuently in foreign languageswith which he was unacquainted; or when theapplication of conventional remedies to thepatient produced unconventional re-sults.15 It is"},{"pageNumber":1151,"pageContent":"obvious that these ‘tests’ depended entirely upon aconsensus of learned physicians as to what was orwas not natural. If this consensus broke down,then there was no way of proceeding. Since in anycase a minority of intellectuals held that witchescould inɻict their victims with the symptoms ofsome ordinary natural disease,16 the diɽculty ofrecognizing witchcraft when one saw it becameeven greater.Contemporaries with open minds on the subjectof witchcraft thus became increasingly aware ofthe logical diɽculties involved in making anaccusation. Those who saw this problem rangedfrom the London preacher in 1603 who pointedout that diabolical possession could never beconɹdently identiɹed, ‘because there cannot beassigned any proper token or sign to know thatany is essentially possessed; which sign must beapparent in all such as are so possessed and not inany others’,17 to the former Secretary for Scotlandwho wrote in 1697 that he had no doubt thatwitches could exist, but that ‘the Parlements ofFrance and other judicatories who are persuadedof the being of witches never try them now,because of the experience they have had that it is"},{"pageNumber":1152,"pageContent":"impossible to distinguish possession from nature indisorder; and they choose rather to let the guiltyescape than to punish the innocent’.18Even if the fact of witchcraft could beestablished, there still remained the problem ofidentifying the witch. At a popular level this was,as we have seen, no problem. Evidence ofmaleficium, accompanied by express or tacithostility, was enough to convince the neighbours.In Elizabethan times it also seems to have beenenough to secure a conviction in the courts. AsWilliam Perkins lamented, ‘Experience shows thatignorant people... will make strong proofs of suchpresumptions, whereupon sometimes jurors dogive their verdict against parties innocent.’19 Inthe early seventeenth century, however, after thepassing of the 1604 statute, with its emphasis onthe diabolical compact, the commentators set asidethe ‘presumptions’ which had been ‘ordinarilyused’, in favour of stricter standards of proof,based primarily upon evidence of compact. Whatthey now wanted was sworn evidence that thewitch kept a familiar or bore the devil's mark onher person; most decisive of all, they hoped for herfree confession that she had entered into a pact"},{"pageNumber":1153,"pageContent":"with Satan.20 This new emphasis upon evidence ofcompact can be seen in seventeenth-century legalproceedings, especially during and after the periodof the Hopkins campaign. Yet none of these new‘proofs’ was infallible. The ‘familiar’ might be aharmless domestic pet and the ‘mark’ a naturalexcrescence.21 The ‘confession’ itself could beplausibly discredited by sceptics as the product offantasy or ‘melancholy’. How could one distinguisha true confession from a false one?22 The more thedemonologists insisted on the need for certainproof, the greater the logical diɽculties they raninto. The paradox was that their severer view ofwitchcraft as devil-worship led ultimately to a risein the acquittal-rate for, without torture of thekind used on the Continent, confessions to such acrime were often unobtainable.On the Continent the mechanism of prosecutionwas at times so infallible that, when acontemporary asked some experienced Germanjudges how an innocent person, once arrested forwitchcraft, could escape conviction, they were at aloss for an answer.23 In England the situation wasnever as bad as this, for even Hopkins, with hismodiɹed form of torture, did not achieve a"},{"pageNumber":1154,"pageContent":"hundred per cent conviction-rate. Unfortunatelythe evidence is inadequate for us to know how itwas that most acquittals during the period wereobtained and what reasoning led a Grand Jury toreject any particular indictment or persuaded aPetty Jury to refuse to convict. But RichardBernard in 1627 listed a number of the objectionswhich a Grand Jury might raise: perhaps thevictim was a counterfeit; perhaps he was suʃeringfrom a natural disease, which a better doctormight be able to identify; or perhaps it was asupernatural disease which the Devil had inɻicteddirectly without the intermediate agency of awitch.24Such evidence as there is suggests that acquittalswere usually made along these and similar lines.Demonstrations of the victims' imposture areparticularly well recorded in the pamphletliterature of the time. But other cases suggest thatjuries would acquit when they thought the witch'smalice had not been proved; when the witnessesagainst her were disreputable; when the testimonyoʃered seemed unduly far-fetched; or when theaccused had a record of regular church-going andgodly living. Neither a ‘confession’ nor a whole"},{"pageNumber":1155,"pageContent":"army of hostile witnesses was necessarily enoughto secure a conviction if judge or jury felt unhappyabout the case.25What is certain is that the mounting rate ofacquittals was the work of tribunals which did notdeny the possibility of witchcraft as such, but wereperplexed by the impossibility of getting certainproof of it in any particular case. This was partly atactic adopted by thoroughly sceptical judges, likeL. C. J. North, who advised his colleagues todisplay ‘a very prudent and moderate carriage’ inface of popular fury against witches, endeavouring‘to convince, rather by detecting of the fraud, thanby denying authoritatively such power to be givento old women’. This was the attitude of ArchbishopAbbot, when dealing with the alleged bewitchingof the impotent Earl of Essex in the reign of JamesI. He would not deny that there was such a thingas witchcraft, but how was he to distinguish it byits external symptoms from any other physicalmalady?26 This was a real diɽculty and notnecessarily a mere device employed by thepusillanimous who did not believe in witchcraft,but were afraid to say so.

This is animpossible question to answer categorically. Allthat one can do is to sketch some of thecircumstances by which the change seems to havebeen precipitated.In the ɹrst place it must be recognized that thehypothesis of witchcraft, like any otherexplanatory mechanism, was bound to crack underits own weight, if too frequently invoked. Theaccusation was easy to make and hard to disprove.It was therefore particularly likely to be animatedby malice or imposture. But one had only to be aneye-witness of a patently unjust accusation to beconverted to a belief in the need for exercisinggreater caution in future. The leading scepticalwriters seem, almost without exception, to havebeen provoked into publication by personalacquaintance with incidents of this kind; fromReginald Scot, who had witnessed a number offraudulent accusations in nearby Kentish villages,to Francis Hutchinson, the future Bishop of Down,whose Historical Essay concerning Witchcraft (1718)was precipitated by the condemnation andsubsequent reprieve in 1712 of the Hertfordshirewoman, Jane Wenham, whom he visited after her"},{"pageNumber":1157,"pageContent":"release and of whose piety he was convinced.27 InFrance it was the series of scandalous cases ofhysterical imposture which led the parlementairesto discontinue witchcraft prosecution.28 InEngland the stimulus seems to have been much thesame.Apart from the inɻuence of individualmiscarriages of justice, it is possible to discern thegrowth of two essentially novel attitudes. The ɹrstis the assumption of an orderly, regular universe,unlikely to be upset by the capricious interventionof God or Devil. This view of the world wasconsolidated by the new mechanical philosophy,but the way to its acceptance had long beenprepared by the emphasis of theologians upon theorderly way in which God conducted his aʃairs,working through natural causes accessible tohuman investigation. In the presence of suchreasonableness, talk of miraculous happeningscame to appear increasingly implausible. It wasthis conviction, rather than any new psychologicalinsight, which accounts for the scepticismdisplayed towards the confessions of old womenwho said that they had seen the Devil, or ɻownthrough the air, or killed men by their secret"},{"pageNumber":1158,"pageContent":"curses. The confessions on which thedemonologists laid such weight were unacceptablea priori, because as John Webster said, ‘it is...simply impossible for either the Devil or witches tochange or alter the course that God hath set innature’.29 Accusations of diabolical witchcraftwere thus rejected not because they had beenclosely scrutinized and found defective in someparticular respect, but because they implied aconception of nature which now appearedinherently absurd.The increasing prevalence of this attitude was tovitiate the last-ditch attempts of some laterseventeenth-century intellectuals to place theancient belief in witchcraft upon a genuinelyscientiɹc foundation, by sifting through the manyinherited tales of the supernatural in order toarrive at those which were authenticated beyondany doubt. This was the motive underlying thepsychical researches of Meric Casaubon, HenryMore, George Sinclair, Joseph Glanvill andRichard Baxter: even Robert Boyle thought that‘one circumstantial narrative fully veriɹed’ was allthat was necessary to confound the sceptics.30 Butthe task proved impossible. For no one can be"},{"pageNumber":1159,"pageContent":"persuaded to change his mind by evidence whichhe regards as implausible. ‘Without manywitnesses’, thought the Deist Charles Blount, ‘thetestimony of one person alone ought to besuspected in things miraculous.’ Many anecdoteswere assembled and published, but none wasstrong enough to pass the test which the scepticswere now in practice applying, and which DavidHume was later to elevate into a philosophicalprinciple: namely, that no testimony couldestablish a miracle unless it were of such a kindthat its falsehood would be more astonishing thanthe fact it was meant to establish.31The second assumption underlying the scepticalattitude was the optimistic conviction that it wouldone day be possible to uncover the natural causesof those events which still remained mysterious.Already it was possible to suggest naturalexplanations for such phenomena as the insensiblewitch's ‘mark’, or the incomprehensible‘confessions’. ‘Melancholy’ underlay the witches'delusions; the ‘incubus’ was not a visitation, but adisease; and natural illnesses could account forsupposed cases of diabolical possession. Muchremained perplexing, but, as John Wagstaʃe"},{"pageNumber":1160,"pageContent":"pointed out,32 the study of mental illness hadbarely begun, and there was no telling what futurediscoveries might be made. The progress made byseventeenth-century scientists was dramaticenough to make most contemporaries aware of theelasticity of natural knowledge, and to imbuesome of them with immense conɹdence in thepotentiality of future human achievement. Thiswas a theme which some of the sceptics were toreiterate;33 and it made it possible for them todiscard the explanatory role of witchcraft withoutleaving too unbearable a void behind.In the short run, moreover, the sceptical attitudewas greatly assisted by the vogue, particularly inthe late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries,of the Neoplatonic conception of the universe aspulsating with many undiscovered occultinɻuences. Many writers were sceptical aboutwitchcraft, precisely because they were socredulous in other matters. They accepted thepossibility of sympathetic healing and action at adistance; they believed that stones might havehidden properties, that a corpse might bleed at theapproach of its murderer, and that some mencould ‘fascinate’ others by the emanations from"},{"pageNumber":1161,"pageContent":"their eyes. Scot's scepticism was made possible byhis commitment to this tradition, and it was nocoincidence that John Webster was sceptical aboutwitchcraft, but believed in the weapon-salve,astral spirits, satyrs, pigmies, mermaids and sea-monsters. It was because these men accepted sowide a range of supposed natural phenomena thatthey were able to dispense with witchcraft as anexplanation of mysterious happenings. It wasmuch easier for them to advance a ‘natural’explanation for the witches' maleficium than it wasfor those who had been educated in the traditionof scholastic Aristotelianism.34 The sceptics thusexplained away apparent mysteries by proʃeringhypotheses about natural events which we shouldregard as entirely spurious. In the same way,rationalist physicians like Edward Jorden couldreinterpret diabolical possession as hysteriaproduced by the ‘rising of the mother’, a naturalexplanation but a mistaken one.35Renaissance Neoplatonism and its aɽliatedschools of thought thus provided the vitalintellectual scaʃolding necessary to prop up thehypothesis that there was a natural cause for everyevent. When in the later seventeenth century this"},{"pageNumber":1162,"pageContent":"scaʃolding collapsed under the onslaught of themechanical philosophy it did not need to bereplaced. The absurdity of witchcraft couldhenceforth be justiɹed by reference to theachievements of the Royal Society and the newphilosophy.36 It is true that some of the earlyconverts to the mechanical philosophy haddiɽculty in making up their minds on the subjectof witchcraft, but in the long run theirs was toprove a comprehensive explanation for naturalphenomena, and one which needed no externalassistance. By an appropriate coincidence, one ofthe three M.P.s who initiated the repeal of theWitchcraft Act in 1736 was John Conduitt, whomarried Sir Isaac Newton's niece and was one ofhis leading admirers and memorialists.There was, therefore, a continuing stream ofscepticism throughout the whole period ofwitchcraft prosecution in England. Scot's greatwork was probably no more than an elaborateapplication of a type of rationalist criticismalready in vogue. As early as 1578 a Norwichphysician, Dr Browne, was accused of ‘spreading amis-liking of the laws by saying there are no"},{"pageNumber":1163,"pageContent":"witches’.37 Scot himself was deeply read in theliterature of witchcraft and drew in particularupon the medical ɹndings of the Cleves physicianJohan Weyer, whose De Praestigiis Daemonum(1563) had urged that many supposed witcheswere innocent melancholics and that even theguilty ones were mere tools of Satan, incapable ofdoing harm by their own activities. Scot took thisposition further by denying even Satan anyphysical power.Outside intellectual circles, the movement ofopinion is diɽcult to chart. There is much tosupport the view that ‘doubt was only silenced, notconvinced’.38 The evidence for this does not lie inthe isolated utterances of sceptics, like theElizabethan lawyer, Serjeant Harris, who declaredin court in 1593 that the idea that one could doharm by melting wax images was ‘a vain and fondconceit’.39 Rather it is to be found in the manyareas of contemporary society where the subject ofwitchcraft seems to have been seldom or nevermentioned: in the world of businessmen andɹnanciers; in the practice of many contemporarydoctors; and in most aspects of politics andadministration."},{"pageNumber":1164,"pageContent":"In the later seventeenth century the growingvolume of scepticism is unmistakable. In 1668Joseph Glanvill admitted that ‘most of the loosergentry and the small pretenders to philosophy andwit are generally deriders of the belief inwitches’.40 In the following year appeared JohnWagstaʃe's Question of Witchcraft Debated, asweepingly sceptical performance, which wascontroversial among Cambridge dons, but widelyesteemed elsewhere.41 ‘We live in an age and aplace,’ wrote Robert Boyle to Glanvill in 1677,‘wherein all stories of witchcrafts, or other magicalfeats are by many, even of the wise, suspected;and by too many that would pass for wits deridedand exploded.’ There were so many would-beexploders of immaterial substances about, thoughtHenry Hallywell in 1681, that to talk of devils andpossession was to invite mockery and contempt.When, around 1694, the Marquis of Halifaxcompiled his list of ‘fundamentals’, he had to setagainst the proposition ‘that there were witches’,the signiɹcant qualiɹcation – ‘much shaken oflate’.42Of course, the belief still retained some vitalityin clerical circles; when Francis Hutchinson came"},{"pageNumber":1165,"pageContent":"to write his book on the subject in 1718 he couldcite nearly thirty works published in defence of thenotion since 1660. Yet even potential believerswere aware of the diɽculty of obtainingsatisfactory proof in any particular case,43 whilemany of the educated laity had come to regard thevery notion of witchcraft as an absurdity. Evenbefore the Act was repealed in 1736, the fact thata man feared witches could be cited in the courtsas evidence of his insanity. When the Scottishjudge Lord Grange opposed the repeal in 1736,Walpole is said to have commented that from thatmoment he knew he had no more to fear from himpolitically.44 By the middle of the century,Conyers Middleton could remark that ‘the belief inwitches is now utterly extinct’.45At a popular level, of course, this was far fromthe truth. There had been occasional traces ofscepticism, even in the sixteenth century. As earlyas 1555, one John Tuckie of Banwell, Somerset,said that in his opinion no man or woman coulddo anything by witch-craft;46 and he must havehad his successors.

Itonly shows that they were no longer seriouslyentertained by the courts.But although popular feeling against witchessurvived the repeal of the Act in 1736, it is possiblethat the volume of accusations had begun todwindle. If so, the reasons for this may have beenas much social as intellectual. For by the laterseventeenth century the conɻict between charityand individualism, which had generated so manyof the witch accusations in the past, was well onthe way to being resolved. The development of thenational Poor Law converted the support of theindigent into a legal obligation. In the process, itceased to be regarded as a moral duty.47 ‘[When]the poor man... makes known his distress to theparish oɽcers,’ William Cobbett was to write,‘they bestow upon him, not alms, but his legaldues.’48 The Poor Law had, of course, beenestablished in Tudor times. But its implicationswere not at ɹrst fully appreciated, for it was onlyinvoked intermittently and as a last resort. Private"},{"pageNumber":1167,"pageContent":"charity remained an important source ofmaintenance and the authorities often turned ablind eye to begging at the door.49 From the earlyseventeenth century onwards, however, the PoorLaw became less of an emergency expedient, moreof a regular system of relief. During the centurythe amount of money raised annually in this wayincreased more than tenfold. With such organizedmeans of support, the indigent were no longer sodependent upon the voluntary help of theirneighbours. ‘I am certain,’ wrote a late-seventeenth-century commentator, ‘that now, carebeing taken by overseers publicly chosen in everyparish, a great many that have compassionatehearts do not much in that kind as they would dootherwise; for what is more natural than to thinksuch care needless... Many people not only think itneedless but foolish to do that which is parishbusiness.’50 Private charity continued, but itsnature was altering. The merchants and gentrywho established the large philanthropicfoundations did not give away food at the door;neither did old women come to ask them for it.In such circumstances the tensions and guiltwhich had produced the old allegations of"},{"pageNumber":1168,"pageContent":"witchcraft gradually withered away. A man whoturned away his neighbour empty-handed could doso with a clearer conscience, for he could tellhimself that other ways now existed of dealingwith the problem. He need no longer feel thetorments of remorse which would once haveculminated in an accusation of witchcraft. Witchaccusations had reɻected a conɻict between thecommunal norms of mutual aid and theindividualistic ethic of self-help. But by the end ofthe seventeenth century, this conɻict was on itsway to being resolved by the disappearance of theold norms. When this happened the stimulus towitchcraft accusation was to dwindle.Signiɹcantly, witch-beliefs lasted longest in thevillage communities, where the causes ofmisfortune could still be seen in personal terms. Incountry villages the conventions ofneighbourliness and mutual help survived into thenineteenth century. Women still came to the doorto beg and to borrow, and the man who turnedthem away empty-handed did so with mixedfeeling. It was no accident that Ruth Osborne, whowas lynched for witchcraft by a Hertfordshire mobin 1751, had been previously refused buttermilk bythe farmer whose subsequent mysterious illness"},{"pageNumber":1169,"pageContent":"provoked the accusation against her. The majorityof other informal witch accusations recorded in theeighteenth, nineteenth and even twentiethcenturies conform to the same old special patternof charity evaded, followed by misfortuneincurred.51After 1736 when the possibility of formalprosecution was no longer open, villagers turnedto informal violence, counter-magic and theoccasional lynching. This procedure was bothillegal and a poor substitute for the old witch-trials. For it was not the mere allegation ofwitchcraft which had had the cathartic eʃect, butits acceptance and proof;52 and after 1736 proofhad become diɽcult and means of redressprohibited. In these circumstances witch-beliefsinevitably declined.The history of witchcraft prosecutions in Englandthus reɻects the intellectual assumptions of theeducated classes who controlled the machinery ofthe law courts. The decline in formal prosecutionwas a consequence of their increasing scepticismabout the possibility of the oʃence, or at leastabout the possibility of proving it. The history ofwitchcraft accusations on the other hand can only"},{"pageNumber":1170,"pageContent":"be explained in terms of the immediate socialenvironment of the witch and her accuser.

But it may be stated categorically thatno convincing correlation can be establishedbetween the chronology of witch-persecution andsuch general events as the incidence of plague,famine, unemployment or price ɻuctuations.Neither, in the light of what has been seen aboutthe personal nature of the misfortunes attributedto witches, is there any reason why we shouldexpect such a correlation to exist.

The Catholic Church rationalized theancient belief in ghosts by teaching that suchapparitions were the souls of those trapped inPurgatory, unable to rest until they had expiatedtheir sins; and there was no shortage of ghoststories, or of individuals who personally claimed tohave encountered such apparitions.1 ‘Commonlysuch spirits be fiends,’ warned the fifteenth-centuryauthor of Dives and Pauper; but he readily admittedthat ghosts of the dead might well be sent back byGod, ‘sometimes for to have help; sometimes toshow that the souls live after the body, to conɹrmthem that be feeble in the faith’.2Most surviving medieval ghost stories are to befound in anecdotal compilations made by theclergy for didactic purposes. But their details areusually suɽciently precise to suggest that the taleswere not invented, but related to the experiencesof real people. Popular belief in the reality ofghosts is also attested by contem-porary moralistsand writers. It was a heinous oʃence for a dying"},{"pageNumber":1174,"pageContent":"person to promise to return to the land of theliving in order to give an account of what lay instore; and it was also thought highly improper totry to get in touch with the souls of the departed.Regulations for medieval gilds sometimes includeda clause banning any attempt by the night watchto amuse themselves by summoning up ghostsduring the hours of darkness.3The Church did not allow tales of apparitions topass uninvestigated. In 1397 an inhabitant of aHereford parish was charged with occasioningscandal by publicly declaring that the spirit of hisdead father haunted the area at night; and in 1523a woman was summoned before the Court of theArchdeacon of Leicester for similarly reportingthat her father had walked after his death.4Theologians taught that it was not in the power ofthe dead man himself to choose to return to theearth; and that the living had no means of forcinghim to do so: God alone determined such matters.But the basic possibility of ghosts, as such, wasnever disputed.This situation was dramatically altered by theReformation. The reformers denied the existence ofPurgatory, asserting that at the moment of death"},{"pageNumber":1175,"pageContent":"all men proceeded inexorably to Heaven or Hell,according to their deserts; from neither worldcould they ever return. This did not mean thatapparitions as such were impossible, but theycould not be the souls of dead men, for those hadgone toThe undiscover'd country from whose bournNo traveller returns.In the ɹrst century of the Reformation,Protestant teaching seems to have beenremarkably ɹrm upon this point; certainly it wasmuch ɹrmer than subsequent generationsappreciated. It says a lot for the shortness ofhuman memory that in the eighteenth century DrJohnson could describe the existence of ghosts as ‘aquestion which after ɹve thousand years is yetundecided’. Indeed, according to Boswell (who wasparticularly interested in such matters), Johnsonthought the possibility of apparitions a necessarycorollary of the doctrine of the immortality of thesoul; the only uncertainly, as he saw it, waswhether or not such spirits could make themselvesperceptible to living men. He himself prayed afterhis wife's death that he might continue to have the"},{"pageNumber":1176,"pageContent":"benefit of her ministrations – ‘whether exercised byappearance, impulses, dreams, or in any othermanner’.5Johnson's views reveal how far the position ofthe early Protestant reformers had, in this, as inmany other respects, been subsequently diluted.For although it may be a relatively frivolousquestion today to? ask whether or not one believesin ghosts, it was in the sixteenth century ashibboleth which distinguished Protestant fromCatholic almost as eʃectively as belief in the Massor the Papal Supremacy.In due course, some Catholic theologians alsobecame sceptical of the possibility of ghosts, atleast of those in bodily form, but few of thetheorists of the Counter-Reformation denied thatdead men might revisit their former haunts. Alldeparted souls, they taught, fell into one of threecategories. The ɹrst two were the damned and theblessed; these everyone agreed could never return.But the third comprised those who were consignedto Purgatory, and these, according to Catholicteaching, might well be sent back for some speciɹcpurpose.6 The Protestants, on the other hand,treated the belief in ghosts as the product of"},{"pageNumber":1177,"pageContent":"Popish fraud and deception. Even Henry More,who accepted that the soul was an immaterialsubstance, capable of assuming some aerialvehicle, nevertheless believed that medieval priestsused to tie candles to the backs of crabs and setthem loose in churchyards to simulate the souls ofthe dead. As for the apparitions which were stillencountered, Protestants agreed that they werenot to be mistaken for the souls of the departed,but were to be recognized as spirits; very rarelygood ones, more usually evil ones, sent by theDevil in an eʃort to entrap men's allegiance. Theircredentials were to be strictly examined, andresolute scepticism was the only defence againsttheir blandishments. The scriptural ‘ghost’ ofSamuel summoned by the Witch of Endor wasinterpreted as just a diabolical imposture, in whichthe part of Samuel was probably played by theDevil himself.7To the ɹrst generation of reformers, ghosts thuspresented no problems. The belief in such spectres,they held, had only arisen in the ɹrst placebecause the Popish clergy had seen it as a meansof exploiting popular credulity in order to enhancetheir own wealth and authority.8 Some people"},{"pageNumber":1178,"pageContent":"even thought that there really had been moreapparitions in the past because the Devil had beenattracted to such a promising environment. WhenLady Fanshawe saw a ghost in Ireland around1650, she stayed up for the rest of the night withher husband discussing why such apparitions wereso much more common there than in England; theycame to the satisfactory conclusion that the causelay in the greater superstition of the Irish, andtheir lack of a faith powerful enough to defendthem from the attacks of the Devil.9So although men went on seeing ghosts after theReformation, they were assiduously taught not totake them at their face value. When Sir ThomasWise saw a walking spirit in the reign of James I,the local archdeacon was inclined to think it mighthave been an angelic apparition. But thetheologian Daniel Featley ɹrmly declared that itmust have been an evil spirit, because it was wellknown that good ones could no longer be expectedto appear.10 The same dilemma is brilliantlyshown by Dr Dover Wilson to have been posed bythe ghost of Hamlet's father.

But aminority of advanced sceptics followed ReginaldScot and Thomas Hobbes in dismissing thepossibility of any genuine apparition whatsoever.By the end of the seventeenth century there weremany educated persons who greeted tales of ghostsand haunted houses with much the same sort ofincredulity as that with which they would bereceived today. ‘I am apt to believe,’ wrote theCatholic Thomas White in 1659, ‘that most of ourstories... if they were examined to the bottomwould be found to proceed from the frequentcogitation and passionate aʃection of the livingtowards their departed friends.’13 But mosttheologians were reluctant to discard visible spiritsaltogether. Indeed, as atheism became a greaterthreat to true religion than Popery, they becamemore sympathetic to the idea of ghosts; for, asRalph Cudworth, the Cambridge Platonist, pointedout, the belief in such apparitions did at leastconstitute a bulwark against the atheist: ‘if therebe once any visible ghosts or spirits acknowledgedas things permanent, it will not be easy for any togive a reason why there might not be one supremeghost also, presiding over them all and the whole"},{"pageNumber":1181,"pageContent":"world’.14 By the time of Addison's Spectator it hadbecome more respectable to believe in ghosts thanto be a total sceptic. High Churchmen were notbeyond praying for the dead; and the storiescollected in Boswell's Johnson show that thepossibility of ghosts was a reality in the eighteenthcentury for many educated men, however muchthe rationalists laughed at them.15So when the Elizabethan bishop, Edwin Sandys,claimed that ‘the gospel hath chased away walkingspirits’,16 he was over-sanguine. In the early yearsof Elizabeth I Bishop Pilkington remarked of aghost recently seen in Blackburn, that such thingswere ‘so common here and none of authority thatwill gainsay it, but rather believe and conɹrm it,that every one believes it’. Twenty years laterReginald Scot commented on the paradox that thedenial of Purgatory had not put an end to thebelief in ghosts: ‘we think souls and spirits maycome out of heaven or hell and assume bodies’.17William Perkins lamented that ‘many ignorantpersons among us’ thought that dead men couldreappear. An early-seventeenth-century writermade the same complaint: the conviction that deadmen could walk was ‘still in the mouth and faith of"},{"pageNumber":1182,"pageContent":"credulous superstition at this day’.18 According toWalter Travers, the Elizabethan Puritan, it was ‘aquestion among the learned’ as to whether witchescould raise the bodies of the deceased. In the reignof Charles I Oxford dons were still debatingwhether or not ghosts of the dead might notsometimes appear. At an abstruse philosophicallevel the possibility was kept alive by the occulttheories of the Neoplatonists, Paracelsians andBehmenists, who believed in astral spirits whichlingered on after the body had decayed.19At a popular level many contemporariesencountered an unquestioning belief in ghosts.When the Quaker George Fox was arrested in 1656he found that his fellow-prisoners in LauncestonCastle ɹrmly believed that ghosts walked regularlyin the condemned cell.20 Numerous other writerstestiɹed to the popular belief in ghosts,poltergeists, and similar apparitions.21 Many ofthese anecdotes related to the clergy, whoseProtestant scruples should have taught themotherwise. There was Henry Caesar, theElizabethan vicar of Lostwithiel, who justiɹed the‘apparition of souls after their departure out of thislife’, citing the example of Sir Walter Mildmay,"},{"pageNumber":1183,"pageContent":"who, he alleged, had successfully conjured up theshade of Cardinal Pole. Caesar was allegedly acrypto-Catholic, though he later became arespectable Dean of Ely.22 But other storiesinvolved clerics of whose ɹrm Protestantism therecould be no doubt. The great Puritan divine,William Twisse, owed his spiritual conversion toan experience as a schoolboy at Winchester in the1590s, when the phantom of a disreputable deadschoolmate appeared to him to report that he wasnow a damned soul.23 A group of Jacobeanplotters who wanted to frighten away theincumbent of the parish of Radwynter, Essex,thought it worth attempting to do so by faking theapparition of ghosts in the churchyard.24 Theparliamentary Commissioners appointed to surveythe palace of Woodstock in 1649 were scaredaway by a local poltergeist; and the minister of thenearby parish of Wootton busied himself seekingdivine aid against the apparition.25John Aubrey thought it was the turmoil of themid seventeenth century which put an end to oldwives' tales about ghosts and spirits: ‘When thewars came, and with them liberty of conscience"},{"pageNumber":1184,"pageContent":"and liberty of inquisition, the phantoms vanish.’26But in fact the Civil War sects were sometimesmore inclined to accept ghost stories than theirAnglican predecessors. When the curate ofMinehead claimed to have seen the apparition of adead parishioner in 1638 the Laudian Bishop ofBath and Wells ɹrmly dismissed it as animposture;27 by contrast, a conspicuously highproportion of the ghost stories subsequentlycollected by Richard Baxter in his Certainty of theWorld of Spirits (1691) were vouched for by menwho had been actively associated with theParliamentary cause. Sectaries were used to seeingghosts; and the enthusiast, George Foster, declaredthat devils were ‘nothing but the spirits of wickedmen deceased’.28But it would be wrong to associate the belief inghosts with any particular denomination. It was tobe found among almost all religious groups, and atvirtually every social level.

He resolved the question by dramaticallyreappearing in the room of John Good, tutor ofBalliol.31Along with the belief in ghosts went a parallelfaith in the possibility of magical action tocounteract such spectres.

In 1613 aSouthwark woman called another ‘a hag’, asserting‘that her ghost doth continually haunt her and herhusband that they cannot thrive’.36 A similar case,brought to the astrologer Simon Forman in 1600,related to a woman haunted at night by a ghost,which she attributed to the witchcraft of her son-in-law.37 Persons who thought themselves ‘hag-ridden’ would take their problems to a doctor orwizard: the case-books of Richard Napier containdozens of examples of patients ‘haunted withspirits’.38 Alternatively, they might employ sometraditional prophylactic: a spayed bitch, for"},{"pageNumber":1187,"pageContent":"example, was said to be able to protect a houseagainst being haunted.39Here, as elsewhere, the wizards spent some timeallaying fears which they themselves had created.A good example was Robert Tooley, a ‘doctor andconjurer’ of Widdicombe-in-the-Moor, whoseactivities were reported by two Devonshireyeomen in an undated petition of the laterseventeenth century.

But it is no part of ourpurpose here to consider just how it was that thesehallucinations could convince witnesses ofundoubted integrity. The social historian should beready to concede that mental and perceptualprocesses can be extensively conditioned by thecultural content of the society in which men live:in this period contemporaries were taught thatghosts or similar apparitions existed; they weretherefore more likely to see them. But in thepresent state of knowledge the investigation ofthese mental and perceptual processes must be leftto the psychologist and the psychic researcher.Even so, it may be pointed out that a number ofwould-be ghost-stories were exposed at the time asthe fabrication of interested parties, while othersturned out to have been pieces of imposture,engineered by unscrupulous persons in order toachieve some private end. In 1621, for example,one Henry Church sought the hand of the Ipswichwidow, Elizabeth Edgar.

A ghost returned from Purgatorybecause of some unrequited crime; it could not restuntil it had been confessed and absolved by thepriest. In 1343, for example, Bishop Burghesh ofLincoln reappeared in order to seek reparation formisdemeanour committed in his lifetime.48 Othercharacteristic medieval ghosts included the canonof Newburgh who returned to confess that he hadstolen the Prior's silver spoons; the priest who"},{"pageNumber":1193,"pageContent":"came to report that he had been damned fordissuading a colleague from becoming a monk;and the concubine who wanted her former lover toarrange masses for her soul in order to ease herpains.49 Ghosts thus came to confess someunrequited oʃence, to describe the punishmentwhich lay in wait for some heinous sin, or totestify to the rewards in store for virtuous conduct.But some medieval ghosts had reappeared so asto rectify some existing social arrangement, torestore ill-gotten goods, or denounce anundetected evil-doer. This was the kind ofapparition most commonly reported after theReformation. The ghost who was unable to restbecause of some misdemeanour committed in hislifetime still appeared occasionally; in 1674, forexample, a Wiltshire Dissenter met the ghost of hisfather-in-law, who confessed to having committeda murder; and in 1679 much attention wasattracted by the case of a London midwife, whoseghost returned to confess to the murder of twoillegitimate children.50 Such confessions servedtheir social purpose by removing suspicion fromliving persons.

In parts ofYorkshire it was believed to be prudent to giveshoes to the poor, because every man after hisdeath would have to pass along stony country.Those who had donated shoes in their lifetimewould be met by an old man who would return tothem the identical pair they had once given awayfor charity.71 The same tradition was enshrined inthe ballad of Whinny-Moor – the gorse terrainthrough which all dead souls had to pass, andwhere all those who had not been charitable intheir life-time would be pricked and tormented.These legends were debased versions of Catholicteaching about the merit of good works: the"},{"pageNumber":1201,"pageContent":"needle-pointed bridge over which dead souls hadto pass bare-footed was a standard piece ofmythology.72 It is well known that beliefs aboutPurgatory lingered on in some nominallyProtestant circles.73 But it is notable that at apopular level it was the duties of charity andneighbourliness which they were particularlyinvoked to reinforce.

This is not a function which wouldbe equally intelligible in every society, foralthough all societies up to a point require theliving to safeguard the wishes of past generations,they diʃer very much as to the extent to which thisobligation is to be observed.

Their relationship to theirforefathers ceased to be close enough for the threatof ghostly vengeance to make much sense.This break with the past had been assisted by theevents of the Reformation, particularly by thedenial of Purgatory, and the accompanyingdestruction of the many religious foundationsdevoted to singing prayers for the dead. In theMiddle Ages such prayers had been an importantaspect of popular religion.

Every individual was now tokeep his own balance-sheet, and a man could nolonger atone for his sins by the prayers of hisdescendants.

As a modern French historian putsit, ‘Life ceased to look to death for itsperspective.’84The century after the Reformation, however,saw an obsessive concern with the provision ofphysical memorials to the dead in place of themonasteries and chantries. For the nobility andgentry it was the great age of architectural tombs.These monuments also served as pedigrees andfamily records, and they were erected to thememory of distant ancestors as well as on behalfof those recently deceased.

Another commentator remarked in 1635 onthe contrast between the elaborate funerals of thePapists and ‘our silent and dumb obsequies’.89 Atthe same time increasing revulsion came to be feltfor the practice of embalming or mummifying thedead man's corpse.90 Such developments pavedthe way for the hasty and embarrassed funerals oftoday, when the physical dissolution of the dead isoften symbolically accelerated by the practice ofcremation.

Stories of apparitions andhaunted houses were very popular in thenineteenth century and are common enoughtoday. Modern investigations reveal that asubstantial proportion of people either think theyhave seen a ghost or accept the possibility thatthey might see one. Vivid dreams of the deadperson are common among those freshlybereaved.92 But the social function of the belief inghosts is obviously much diminished, and so is itsextent. One of the reasons for this is that it is nowmore common for people to live out their full life-span, and to die only after they have retired andwithdrawn from an active role in society.

In earlier periods, bycontrast, it was commoner for men to be carriedoff at the prime of their life, leaving behind them acertain amount of social disturbance, which ghost-beliefs helped to dispel. The period when the soulwandered loose was that when the survivors wereadapting themselves to their new pattern of socialrelationships.94 Today that period is often short oreven non-existent.But the main reason for the disappearance ofghosts is that society is no longer responsive to thepresumed wishes of past generations.

A modern student of folklore hassuggested that most medieval fairies belonged toone of four categories: ‘trooping fairies’, whopassed their time feasting and dancing; hobgoblinsor guardian spirits like Puck alias RobinGoodfellow, who performed domestic chores formortals; mermaids and water spirits; and giantsand monsters.96 But it is doubtful whether suchhard and fast divisions can be made.

Yet in the late seventeenth century SirWilliam Temple could assume that fairy beliefs hadonly declined in the previous thirty years or so.John Aubrey also put them in the fairly recentpast: ‘When I was a boy, our country people wouldtalk much of them.’102 Indeed it seems thatcommentators have always attributed them to thepast. Even Chaucer's Wife of Bath had dated thereign of the elf-queen to ‘many hundred yearsago’, remarking sardonically that the fairies hadbeen driven away by the prayers and charity ofthe holy friars.103The fact that fairy-beliefs seem to have hadchildhood associations for most commentatorsmakes it harder to assess their vitality at anyparticular period.

A hundred years later thecommon people of England were still said tobelieve in them.

Manymagical compilations of the period containedinstructions for conjuring them up in order tolearn a variety of occult secrets.106 Such ritualswere much the same as those for conjuring spiritsin general.

Sometimesthey came out to dance on grass fairy-rings andallowed themselves to be seen by selected humanbeings. They were occasionally predatory andmight swoop down to snatch an unguarded infantchild, leaving a changeling in his place.

Fairies could only be good or evilspirits, and of the two possibilities the latter wasmuch more likely.

Theywere ‘conceits... whereby the Papists kept theignorant in awe’.117 This much-echoed view wasgrossly unfair, not only because fairy-beliefs wereolder than Roman Catholicism, but because themedieval Church had itself been hostile to fairymythology. But it was much employed byProtestant polemicists in the century after theReformation, and found its most attractive poeticexpression in Bishop Corbett's The Faeryes Farewell.Most of those who remained sympathetic to fairy-beliefs admitted the Roman Catholic character ofthe fairy kingdom. ‘Theirs is a mixt religion,’ wroteRobert Herrick, ‘part pagan, part papistical.’118Goodwin Wharton, who was tricked by Mrs Parishinto believing that he had extensive relations with"},{"pageNumber":1221,"pageContent":"the fairies, or ‘lowlanders’, as she sometimes calledthem, was told that they were ‘Christians,serving...

YetWharton's faith survived these transparentmishaps, and the extraordinary masquerade wassustained for over a decade.136For one striking aspect of fairy-beliefs was theirself-conɹrming character.

The rules for theirobservance were inherited ones, resting on nodiscernible foundation.In medieval Europe the best known of thesesupposedly unfortunate times were the so-called‘Egyptian’ or ‘dismal’ days, a list of dates on whichit was thought to be dangerous to embark uponany action of consequence.1 A man who went fora journey on such a day might not return; apatient who fell ill would be unlikely to recover.No one seems to have known why these days werecalled ‘Egyptian’; some said it was because it wasthe ancient Egyptians who had ɹrst observedthem, others regarded them as the days on whichthe various plagues had struck Biblical Egypt.2Nor does there seem to have been any clearagreement as to precisely which days of the year"},{"pageNumber":1232,"pageContent":"they were, for rival sets of dates were incirculation. In England in the sixteenth andseventeenth centuries it was common for lists ofsuch ‘evil’ days to be printed in almanacs andpopular handbooks. But these prognosticationsseldom agreed with each other, and a diligentreader might have concluded there was virtuallyno day in the year which was not regarded asunsafe by someone.Lists of unlucky days were also compiled bymany private individuals and can often be foundin their personal papers.3 They were times to beavoided for weddings, journeys, operations,bloodlettings, and any other critical activities.How seriously they were observed is impossible tosay, but even Elizabeth I's Treasurer, LordBurghley, thought it worth mentioning them in hisAdvice to his Son: ‘Though I think no day amiss toundertake any good enterprise or business inhand,’ he remarks, ‘yet have I observed some, andno mean clerks, very cautious to forbear... threeMondays in the year.’ These were the ɹrst Mondayin April (supposedly the anniversary of the deathof Abel), the second Monday in August (thedestruction of Sodom and Gomorrah), and the last"},{"pageNumber":1233,"pageContent":"Monday in December (the birthday of JudasIscariot).4 In Burghley's three taboo Mondays (ofwhich the memory was preserved in populartradition as late as the nineteenth century) wemay recognize a garbled and Biblicised version ofthe three unsuitable days for blood-letting whichhad been named by Hippocrates, and disseminatedto medieval Europe by Isidore of Seville, viz., theKalends of April and August, and the last day ofDecember.5Closely parallel to the belief in unlucky dayswas the notion of climacteric years, those periodicdates in a man's life which were potential turning-points in his health and fortune. This idea wasbased on the doctrine that a man's body changedits character every seven years and that his lifewas thus made up of ‘septenaries’. Every seventhyear was a critical time, according to someauthorities; only those multiplied by odd numbers(i.e., the seventh, twenty-ɹrst, thirty-ɹfth, forty-ninth, etc.), according to others.

But, thoughscoʃed at by some intellectuals and refuted by theclergy, the idea was taken seriously by manycontemporaries: ‘nowadays’, declared a writer in1603, ‘very few exceed the age of sixty-three,because that year is fatal and climacterical’.6 Verysimilar was the notion that certain days of theweek or dates of the year had a specialsigniɹcance for certain families or individuals. Thecoincidence of Oliver Cromwell's death on 3September 1658 with the anniversary of hisvictories at Dunbar and Worcester did much tokeep the idea alive during the later seventeenthcentury.7Many of these superstitions about the inherentquality of diʃerent times had been vigorously, ifunsuccessfully, combated by the medieval Church(although in 1537 Henry VIII appears to have beenunwilling to let the bishops denounce theobservance of ‘dismal days’ in their Institution of aChristian Man).8 Theologians cited the OldTestament warnings about the observance of timesin their campaign against the belief in Egyptiandays.

Even after the Reformation, theecclesiastical year was dotted with seasonal taboosand observances. Abstention from meat on Fridaysand during Lent gave certain times a dietarypeculiarity. The holy days, on which no work wasto be done, acquired an additional signiɹcance inthe lives of country folk, by breaking up the yearinto memorable units and making it easier toknow when each annual task was due to be carriedout. In the mid seventeenth century the Yorkshirefarmer, Henry Best, drew heavily upon the Churchcalendar in his review of the year's work.

Themedieval clergy had encouraged this notion thatsaints’ days had a supernatural aura, byemphasizing that a sin committed on a holy daywas worse than one committed at some othertime,17 and by disseminating anecdotes about themany divine punishments which befell those whowere careless in their observance of theecclesiastical calendar. After the Reformation suchnotions lingered. Saints’ days like St Swithin'sremained critical in many popular systems ofweather divination. Others kept their tabooassociations.

In the Middle Ages therehad been various seasons when matrimony wasnot permitted. According to the Sarum Manualthere were three: Advent Sunday to the Octave of(i.e. eight days after) Epiphany; SeptuagesimaSunday to the Octave of Easter; and the Sundaybefore Ascension Day to the Octave of Pentecost.After the Reformation the Council of Trentmodiɹed this situation by forbidding thecelebration of marriage only in Lent and Advent."},{"pageNumber":1240,"pageContent":"But the Church of England preserved the fullmedieval prohibitions, and, though not formallyincluded in the Prayer Book or Canons, they wereinsisted upon by many of the bishops in theirvisitation articles.

The sundrydoctrines about unlucky days, saints' days,climacteric years, leap years, etc., were all moreeasily acceptable in a society dependent upon theseasons for its basic living pattern. The old Churchcalendar was based on the needs of a people livingclose to the soil, whereas the Puritan demand for aweekly rhythm in place of a seasonal oneemanated from the towns, not the countryside.Even in late medieval England it was notoriousthat countrymen had a stronger belief in thevarying quality of time than did their urbancounterparts. ‘In cities and towns,’ said a ɹfteenth-century writer, ‘men rule them by the clock.’36 Itwas the development of more precise methods of"},{"pageNumber":1246,"pageContent":"mechanical time-reckoning which was to makepossible the spread of the mathematicalconception of time as a sort of unbroken anduniform tape-measure.

A manwho felt that his venture was doomed, because hehad stumbled on the threshold when setting out,was usually right, since his heart would no longerbe in it. According to his expectations of success orfailure, his resolution would be strengthened orweakened, with predictable consequences. ‘Howcertainly will the best cause fall to the ground,’remarked a writer in 1665, ‘where the hands whichare to support it are weakened by an opinion ofsome unpromising omen.’ This was the line takenby Reginald Scot, Robert Burton, Bishop Sprat andothers.50 Some of these writers pressed the matterfurther, by trying to uncover the ‘rational’foundations on which they assumed someapparently baseless superstitions must have rested.They pointed to the natural causes underlying thebehaviour of animals and plants.

On thisinterpretation the objects to which magicalimportance are attached are those bearing obvioussocial importance. The limitations of this approachhave already been seen. Many of the omens,prohibitions and magically useful commoditiesseem to have had no utilitarian signiɹcance at all,while many of those which were socially usefullacked any magical meaning.The second approach is the functional one. Here,importance is placed on the socially usefulconsequences of the belief in question, regardlessof its intrinsic merits. Thus a prohibition on salt-spilling standardizes behaviour along useful lines,by preventing waste and encouraging restrainedbehaviour at table. It also serves as a convenientexcuse for any subsequent misfortune, in that itdiverts attention from an individual's error orcarelessness in execution, by suggesting that thefailure of the venture was due to externalcircumstances beyond his control.

They are valuable because they focusattention on the meticulous discharge of theparticular operation being carried out. Althoughthis interpretation helps to explain the enduranceof some of these beliefs, it has nothing to sayabout their origins as such, and it is positivelyunilluminating when confronted by rituals andprohibitions lacking functional consequences ofany apparent value; for example, the notion thatit was unlucky to pass a hare on the road, or that aman should hold his left thumb in his right handwhen hiccuping.52The third approach is the symbolic. This startsfrom the assumption that to understand why it wasunlucky to spill salt one must ɹrst ask what it wasthat salt symbolized to contemporaries. This canbe done psycho-analytically, as for example in thesuggestion that salt is a symbol of semen and thatthe objection to spilling it reɻects an unconsciousfear of ejaculatio praecox.53 There are limits to thisapproach.

The unity of magical beliefsAFTER so long a survey of so many diʃerentaspects of the mental life of sixteenth- andseventeenth-century England, it is time to pulltogether the threads of the argument. First, wemust emphasize the interrelatedness of the mainmagical beliefs. The links between magic,astrology and witchcraft were both intellectualand practical. On the intellectual level, astrologyprovided a coherent justiɹcation for geomancy,palmistry, physiognomy and similar activities. ‘Allthese skills of divination are rooted and groundedupon astrology,’ declared Cornelius Agrippa.1 Bypostulating correspondences between the heavenlybodies and earthly substances, the palmists andphysiognomists assigned diʃerent parts of the faceor hand to diʃerent signs of the zodiac. Geomancyemployed the twelve astrological houses and,according to the leading textbook on the subject,was ‘none other thing but astrology’.2 Alchemyalso divided up the metals between the planets,and could be described as mere ‘kitchen magic orchimney astrology’.3 The astrological choice oftimes was important, not only for alchemicaloperations, but also for the ritual gathering ofmagical herbs and the conjuration of spirits."},{"pageNumber":1261,"pageContent":"According to Robert Fludd, even the choice ofingredients for the weapon-salve had to bedetermined by astrological investigation;4 whilethe witch Ellen Green confessed in 1619 that herspirits came to suck her blood at certain phases ofthe moon.5The intellectual links between these diʃerentbeliefs were emphasized by their practicalassociations with each other. The astrologersthemselves were often men of wide-rangingactivity. Forman practised astrology, geomancy,medicine, divination by facial moles, alchemy andconjuring. Ashmole's activities were equallydiverse. Richard Saunders wrote a series oftextbooks on chiromancy and physiognomy. EvenLilly, who did more than anyone to ‘purify’astrology, also practised conventional medicine,spirit-raising, treasure hunting and the conjurationof angels and fairies. It is not surprising that aclergyman preaching to the Society of Astrologersin 1649 felt it necessary to warn his hearers tostick to their last: ‘Some falling by the ill practiceof your lawful art have become, of magi,magicians, and, of wise men, wizards.’6The links between magic and astrology illustrate"},{"pageNumber":1262,"pageContent":"the way in which the various types of magical orsemi-magical belief propped each other up. Likethe cunning men, the astrologers dealt with manypatients who thought themselves bewitched andhence helped to sustain the belief in witchcraft.Indeed both Richard Saunders and Joseph Blagravewent so far as to declare that astrologicaldiagnosis was the only sure way by whichwitchcraft could be discovered. White witches andcunning men they dismissed as mere cheats, orconfederates in league with the black witches.7Lilly's case-books contain well over ɹfty cases ofsuspected witchcraft altogether, no less thantwenty-three of them occurring betweenMidsummer 1654 and September 1656.8 But thereare only ɹve in which his verdict survives, and ineach one it is negative. One client was told that hewas not bewitched, but merely suʃering from anoccult disease in his private parts, ‘occasioned bytoo much venerian sports’; a noblewoman wasassured that she would not die of witchcraft butcould count upon a natural death; a gentlemanand a silk-weaver's wife at Shoreditch were eachtold that they were not bewitched; and anothercase was dismissed as one of ‘dropsy stone’.9"},{"pageNumber":1263,"pageContent":"But there is no doubt that other astrologers didsometimes conɹrm witchcraft suspicions.

Astrologers were happy to beregarded as complete authorities on witchcraft, totake all suspicions seriously, and to prescribemeasures for the patient's recovery. In this way thebelief in witchcraft was constantly reinforced bytheir activities.But astrology and witchcraft usually functionedas rival systems of explanation, since to attribute adisaster to the malignity of a neighbour meantruling out the possibility that it might have anastral cause. Thus in 1635 a patient, ‘taken ill witha mopishness’, came to Sir Richard Napier becausehe ‘feared he was bewitched or blasted by an illplanet’.12 It was common to invoke the planets asthe direct cause of a mysterious disease.

When the Mayor of Ryefell sick at the beginning of the seventeenthcentury, Susan Snapper was told by a spirit to goto a cunning woman to get some ‘planet-water’.Similarly in 1693 the London quack Mary Greenclaimed to have cured a man who had been ‘struckby a planet on his left arm’.17 In the latenineteenth century white witches were stillsometimes known as ‘planet-rulers’.18 Anne Baker,"},{"pageNumber":1265,"pageContent":"accused of witch-craft in Leicestershire in 1619,elaborated on the mythology of planets, declaringthat they came in four colours, ‘black, yellow,green and blue, and that black is always death’;she had seen the blue planet strike one ThomasFairebarne.

The more ambitiousastrologers endeavoured to maintain somedistinction by subordinating all other activities tothe rules of their own art. But the place ofastrology at the top of the hierarchy was not soeasily preserved.

By capturing theseastral emanations, the astrologers could divert thepower of the heavens to their own ends. So theycast sigils in copper and tin, engraved withastrological symbols and dedicated atastrologically propitious moments; and they usedthem for all the traditional magical purposes: toprocure the favour of great persons and to win thelove of women, to keep wives faithful, to guardagainst diseases and the power of witchcraft, andto give immunity from thunder and lightning. In1667 Lilly sent a trunkload of them to Ash-mole,describing them as ‘the greatest arcanas anyprivate person in Europe hath; they were the tenyears collection of the Lord Bothwell, given to Sir"},{"pageNumber":1267,"pageContent":"R. Holborn and by him unto me’.24 Ashmolefrequently employed such remedies at times ofpersonal crisis. He used them against the ɻeas andmice which infested his house, and for his wife'sattacks of vomiting. As a parliamentary candidatefor Lichɹeld in 1678, he cast magic sigils ‘forincrease of honour and estimation with greatmen’. Forman, Napier and many of the others hadalso used magic of this kind.25 In the 1690s HenryColey, Lilly's adopted ‘son’, and successor in hisastrological practice, was said to be sellingastrological sigils at four shillings each, for use ascontraceptives by servant-girls.26 Astrology thusled on to magic, conjuring, alchemy and thelimitless horizons of magical investigation.‘Judicial astrology is the key of natural magic,’wrote Ashmole, ‘and natural magic the door thatleads to this blessed stone.’27Up to a point, of course, astrology was adiʃerent type of activity from the magic of thevillage wizards.

They went to theastrologer, half-expecting him to engage in magic:one of Booker's callers recoiled when he saw theastrologers clock in its glass case, protesting that‘he would not see things in a glass’.28 JohnGadbury complained that ‘some among us, thatwear the golden name of astrologers... verycommonly, under pretence thereof, make use of acrystal and other pretended cheats and shifts togull the sillier sort of people’.29 There were plentyof would-be astrologers who resorted to sundrykinds of hocus-pocus in order to impress theircustomers, just as there were conjurers, likeWilliam Marsh, the Papist astrologer of Dunstable,who conɹded to an acquaintance that he usedastrology simply as a cover, ‘and... did his businessby the help of the blessed spirits’.30 Both Patrickand Richard Saunders used a crystal ball.31"},{"pageNumber":1269,"pageContent":"Astrology, however, long retained the capacityto lift itself above most other types of popularmagic because of its pretensions to be a genuinelyscientiɹc system. Not all its practitioners betrayedtheir principles by dabbling indiscriminately inother types of magic, or including Galfridianprophecies in their almanacs. John Gadbury, forexample, represented the purest kind ofastrological rationalism. He opposed the use ofastrological sigils, just as he scoʃed at theemployment of charms in medicine. He was ascontemptuous of the way in which Lilly andCulpepper cited the prophecies of the sibyls orMother Shipton as he was of the delusions of theFifth Monarchists and the ‘judgements’ and‘prodigies’ collected by the Dissenters. He hadnever seen a case of witchcraft, he declared, whichcould not be reduced ‘to a natural astral cause’.For him astrology was a purely natural system ofdivination, based on the meticulous study of causeand eʃect.32 It was this aspect of the subjectwhich enabled it to retain prestige among manyeducated persons who had no respect for charmsor other kinds of popular magic.2. Magic and religion"},{"pageNumber":1270,"pageContent":"2. Magic and religionThe unity of the various magical beliefs is easilyperceived, but what of their relationship tocontemporary religion? Throughout this book theemphasis has been laid upon their essentiallyparallel functions. Religion, astrology and magicall purported to help men with their dailyproblems by teaching them how to avoidmisfortune and how to account for it when itstruck. To stress this point is not to trivializereligion or to reduce it to a mere system of magic.Contemporary Christianity was a many-sidedaʃair. Its elaborate self-fulɹlling rituals oʃered asymbolism of human experience whose social andpsychological relevance far transcended thelimited and speciɹc contexts in which its morepurely magical aspects were invoked. ‘Religion,’ ithas been justly said, ‘refers to the fundamentalissues of human existence while magic alwaysturns round speciɹc, concrete and detailedproblems.’33 Popular magic in England dischargedonly a limited number of functions; it providedprotection against witchcraft, and variousremedies for illness, theft, and unhappy personalrelationships. But it never oʃered a comprehensiveview of the world, an explanation of human"},{"pageNumber":1271,"pageContent":"existence, or the promise of a future life. It was acollection of miscellaneous recipes, not acomprehensive body of doctrine. Whereas the faithof the Christian was a guiding principle, relevantto every aspect of life, magic was simply a meansof overcoming various specific difficulties. It is truethat magic could sometimes have its expressiveaspect. Its rituals for curing the sick or identifyingthieves might involve the enactment of satisfyinglittle dramas, not unlike the ceremonies of theChurch.34 The intellectual magician might evenhave Faustian dreams in which magic became thekey to existence. But it remains true that at thepopular level magic's role was much more limitedthan that of religion.Nevertheless, the contemporary clergy saw thecunning folk and astrologers as their deadly rivals.They did so because they resented a competingpastoral agency, and because they were anxious toreplace a magical explanation of misfortune by atheological one. When plague, ɹre or some otherdisaster struck, they devoted much energy torefuting the theories of those who attributed theevents to the stars, to magic, to fortune or badluck. In their place they aɽrmed the sovereignty"},{"pageNumber":1272,"pageContent":"of God's providence and interpreted hisjudgements in accordance with the conceptionthey had formed of his intentions. It was the sinsof the people which were the cause of the fall ofcommonwealths, declared a preacher at Paul'sCross in 1609: neither the Fortune of theEpicureans, nor the Destiny of the Stoics, nor themystical numbers of the Pythagoreans, nor thestars of the astrologers could provide a satisfactoryalternative.35 Plagues did not come from theconjunctions of the planets or the eclipses of thesun, as ‘wizards fondly imagine’, declared another;they emanated from God's will.36 At times of greatcrisis, religious explanations had to competedirectly with those oʃered by astrologers, fortune-tellers and purveyors of ancient prophecies. It waspossible to reconcile these other explanations withreligious doctrine by arguing that God workedthrough the stars, or that he was the source ofinspiration behind prophets and cunning men, orthat he chose to punish sinners by allowing theDevil to torment them with witchcraft. As we haveseen, there were many contemporaries whoreasoned in this way.37 But at a popular level itwas usual to ignore such rationalizations, and to"},{"pageNumber":1273,"pageContent":"see witchcraft, prophecies, fairies or ghosts asexplanations of misfortune which were essentiallydiʃerent from those oʃered by the clergy. It waseasier to reconcile astrology or natural magic withreligion, for these doctrines were seen as purely‘natural’ ones by contemporary intellectuals.

Although preachers concededthat God might inɻict disasters on his people forreasons best known to himself, they constantlyreturned to the assumption that men were unlikelyto suʃer undeservedly. Fairies and ghosts weresimilarly more inclined to torment those who hadfailed in some aspect of their social duty. Evenwitch-beliefs, though superɹcially an attempt toshuʀe oʃ the blame on to a third party, were, aswe have seen, unlikely to be invoked unless thevictim himself was conscious of some moral fault.This implied link between misfortune and guiltwas a fundamental feature of the mental"},{"pageNumber":1274,"pageContent":"environment of this period. By leading the suʃererto review his own moral behaviour, it helped toreinforce existing social norms. Both magic andreligion thus became an important means of socialcontrol.In addition to oʃering rival explanations ofmisfortune, the magical beliefs competed withreligion by claiming to bring supernatural powerto bear upon earthly problems. The Reformationtook a good deal of the magic out of religion,leaving the astrologers and cunning men to ɹllmuch of the vacuum. But the sectarians broughtback much of the magic which their early Tudorpredecessors had so energetically cast out. Duringthe Interregnum they exploited the possibilities ofreligion for healing and prophesying in a wayunsurpassed in England since the days of the earlyChristian saints. The practical attractions ofenthusiastic religion during these years closelymatched those of the magic arts. There was nodiʃerence between a sibylline prophecy and aQuaker revelation, thought one contem-parary.Another reported of the Fifth Monarchy Men that‘in their lectures and chief conventicles you mighthave heard such raptures that you would have"},{"pageNumber":1275,"pageContent":"thought it were a reading on astrology’.38 Whenthe transcript of John Dee's conjuring sessions withthe spirits was published in 1659, many Puritandivines suspected it as a partisan attempt todiscredit religious enthusiasm.39 To theunsophisticated there was little to choose betweena cunning man and a religious leader who healedand prophesied, or between a witch and a godlydivine who predicted correctly that divinejudgements would fall upon his enemies. It is notsurprising that one contemporary, after seeing thecunning woman, Anne Bodenham, at work, shouldhave concluded that she ‘was either a witch or awoman of God’.40How far the break with Rome led to anexpansion in popular magic is impossible to say.Scot felt that the wise women of his time weretaking the place of the healing shrines of theCatholic saints, and they certainly catered for asimilar clientele. In times of plague, remarked anElizabethan theologian, men ‘ɻee for remedy...some to certain saints as S. Roch or S. Anthony;and some to the superstitious arts of witchcraft’.41‘In Catholic countries,’ wrote Robert Southey in1807, ‘the confessor commands the thief to make"},{"pageNumber":1276,"pageContent":"restitution, – here, the person who has beenrobbed repairs to a witch or wizard.’42 Astrologyundoubtedly underwent a boom after theReformation; there was no precedent for theprofusion of almanacs and astrological guideswhich circulated in the seventeenth century.

Fifteenth-century visitation recordssuggest that white witches turned up as frequentlythen as a hundred years later. Homiletic literaturetestiɹes to their prevalence in earlier periods forwhich the ecclesiastical records are inadequate. Itis true that far more is known about Tudor andStuart wizards than about their medievalpredecessors, but it does not follow that thegreater survival of evidence reɻects any actualincrease in their numbers.The century after the Reformation thusconstituted a transitional period, during which avariety of magical agencies continued to oʃertheir services to those for whom the Protestantnotion of self-help was too arduous. The hold ofany kind of orthodox religion upon the mass of thepopulation was never more than partial.

Yet theChurch had all the resources of organized politicalpower on its side, whereas most magical practiceswere harshly proscribed. The fact that they couldstill compete so eʃectively with the recipes of theestablished Church is testimony to theirspontaneous basis in the needs of the people.Of course, religion ultimately outlived itsmagical competitors. The wizards and astrologerslost their prestige during the seventeenth century,whereas the Church has continued into moderntimes to provide a framework for many of society'sactivities. But this process was not simply a matterof religion driving out its rivals, for the religionwhich survived the decline of magic was not thereligion of Tudor England. When the Devil was"},{"pageNumber":1278,"pageContent":"banished to Hell, God himself was conɹned toworking through natural causes. ‘Specialprovidence’ and private revelations gave way tothe notion of a Providence which itself obeyednatural laws accessible to human study.Superstition, wrote a leader of the ScottishEnlightenment, ‘has yielded only to the light oftrue religion, or to the study of nature, by whichwe are led to substitute a wise providenceoperating by physical causes in the place ofphantoms that terrify or amuse the ignorant’.44‘The doctrine of a particular providence’, wroteJohn Wesley in 1781, ‘is absolutely out of fashionin England and any but a particular providence isno providence at all.’45So although our period ended with the triumphof religion over magic, it was religion with adiʃerence.

This is a topicon which social anthropologists have as yetthrown little light,7 and it is one which thehistorian of Tudor and Stuart England must alsofind peculiarly intractable. The period abounded insceptics, but it is rarely that one comes upondocumented instances of an individual's loss offaith. Contemporary literature was written by menwho occupied well-deɹned positions; it throwslittle light on how people came to change theirminds. Nevertheless, we must try to determine thecircumstances which made traditional modes ofmagical thought appear increasingly out-dated.The ɹrst of these was the series of intellectualchanges which constituted the scientiɹc andphilosophical revolution of the seventeenthcentury. These changes had a decisive inɻuenceupon the thinking of the intellectual élite and indue course percolated down to inɻuence thethought and behaviour of the people at large. Theessence of the revolution was the triumph of themechanical philosophy. It involved the rejection"},{"pageNumber":1285,"pageContent":"both of scholastic Aristotelianism and of theNeoplatonic theory which had temporarilythreatened to take its place. With the collapse ofthe microcosm theory went the destruction of thewhole intellectual basis of astrology, chiromancy,alchemy, physiognomy, astral magic and theirassociates. The notion that the universe wassubject to immutable natural laws killed theconcept of miracles, weakened the belief in thephysical efficacy of prayer, and diminished faith inthe possibility of direct divine inspiration. TheCartesian concept of matter relegated spirits,whether good or bad, to the purely mental world;conjuration ceased to be a meaningful ambition.At the beginning of the seventeenth century anintelligent contemporary would have found itdiɽcult to predict this outcome. For magic andscience had originally advanced side by side. Themagical desire for power had created anintellectual environment favourable to experimentand induction; it marked a break with thecharacteristic medieval attitude of contemplativeresignation. Neoplatonic and hermetic ways ofthinking had stimulated such crucial discoveries inthe history of science as heliocentrism, the inɹnity"},{"pageNumber":1286,"pageContent":"of worlds, and the circulation of the blood.8 Themystical conviction that numbers contained thekey to all mysteries had fostered the revival ofmathematics. Astrological inquiries had broughtnew precision to the observation of the heavenlybodies, the calculation of their movements, and themeasurement of time.9This union of magic and science was short-lived.Its dissolution was foreshadowed in early-seventeenth-century Europe by a series ofintellectual combats: Isaac Casaubon's redating ofthe hermetic books in 1614; the refutation ofRobert Fludd's magical animism by MarinMersenne and Pierre Gassendi in the decade after1623.10 In the later seventeenth century thepartnership collapsed. Robert Boyle's chemicalinvestigations destroyed many of the assumptionson which the alchemists had rested theirspeculations. The Royal Society disproved byexperiment the idea that insects could bespontaneously generated. The doctrine ofsignatures, already denied by some earlierbotanists, was rejected from the start by John Ray.Magnetism and electricity, which had previouslybeen seen as occult inɻuences, could now be"},{"pageNumber":1287,"pageContent":"explained in purely mechanical terms as themovement of particles.11 The triumph of themechanical philosophy meant the end of theanimistic conception of the universe which hadconstituted the basic rationale for magicalthinking.Sir Isaac Newton's secret alchemicalinvestigations12 are a reminder that the changewas not accomplished overnight. But the virtuosiwho dabbled in magic or alchemy had come toappear increasingly cranky to their scientiɹccolleagues, and the intellectual vitality haddeparted from the magical guides which continuedto be published for the beneɹt of a lower-classpublic.The new science also carried with it aninsistence that all truths be demonstrated, anemphasis on the need for direct experience, and adisinclination to accept inherited dogmas withoutputting them to the test. ‘There is no certainknowledge without demonstration,’ declaredSamuel Butler. The implications of this newattitude can be seen in the stories of how thephysician, William Harvey, carefully dissected atoad alleged to be a witch's familiar, and how the"},{"pageNumber":1288,"pageContent":"mathematician, Henry Briggs, abandoned hisinterest in astrology, once he discovered that itsprinciples were incapable of demonstration.13Indeed this epistemological demand for certainknowledge was eroding the status of every kind ofmagical belief. It made witchcraft prosecutionimpossible, discredited astrology, and inculcatedscepticism in face of the claims of religiousenthusiasts to be directly inspired by God.14 Italso led to a rescrutiny of some hoary old legends.The early scientists, particularly those ofNeoplatonic learnings, had tended to accept everystory, no matter how bizarre, and then to devotetheir energies to ɹnding an explanation for it.During the later seventeenth century this attitudechanged. As John Webster remarked in 1677,‘there is no greater folly than to be very inquisitiveand laborious to ɹnd out the causes of such aphenomenon as never had any existence, andtherefore men ought to be cautious and to be fullyassured of the truth of the eʃect before theyadventure to explicate the cause’.15 Charms, spellsand ancient prophecies could oʃer no resistance tothis type of investigation.

But it was to be some time beforethe people at large became fully aware of theirimplications. The early eighteenth century sawsome important eʃorts to disseminate knowledgeto the reading public through manuals andencyclopedias. These works sometimes took anaggressively hostile attitude to the old magicalbeliefs. In his Universal Dictionary of Arts andSciences (1704) John Harris, F.R.S., dismissedastrology as ‘a ridiculous piece of foolery’ andalchemy as ‘an art which begins with lying, iscontinued with toil and labour, and at last ends inbeggary’.18 His successor, Ezekiel Chambers,"},{"pageNumber":1290,"pageContent":"however, was much more cautious in hisinɻuential Cyclopaedia (1728), preferring torationalize many of the old beliefs, rather thanreject them altogether. Although he dismissedchiromancy as a ‘vain and triɻing art’, andconsidered sorcery to have been ‘at bottom noother than artful poisonings’, he took alchemyfairly seriously and allowed the natural part ofastrology. He also accepted amulets, occultinɻuences and witchcraft by eʀuvia from the eye.His work reminds us that the implications of thescientiɹc revolution could take a long time tomake themselves fully felt.19For that matter a ‘rationalist’ attitude hadexisted long before the work of Galileo or Newton.It was to be found, up to a point, in the writings ofthe Paduan school of the early sixteenth century.The regularity of the natural world, theimpossibility of miracles, and the mortality of thesoul were asserted by Pietro Pomponazzi (1462-1525), and reiterated by the ‘libertine’ thinkers ofsixteenth-century Italy and seventeenth-centuryFrance. The inspiration for these writers was notthe new science so much as the rationalist authorsof classical antiquity: Hippocrates, who denied"},{"pageNumber":1291,"pageContent":"that epilepsy had supernatural causes; Aristotle,who dismissed most ‘prophetic’ dreams as merecoincidences; Cicero, who repudiated the arts ofdivination; Epicurus and Lucretius, who showedthat the course of the world could be explainedwithout invoking divine intervention; Plutarch,who exposed the superstitions of the Jews.20 InEngland too the earliest opponents of magic mademore extensive use of these classical authors thanthey ever did of contemporary science. ReginaldScot had no diɽculty in rejecting diabolicalinɻuence, before the scientiɹc revolution hadscarcely begun.21 It was as common inElizabethan England for the social élite to professcontempt for vulgar ‘superstitions’ as it had beenin Augustan Rome.But Scot and his imitators had, like Pomponazzi,only been able to ɹll the gap left after theelimination of religious or magical explanations ofnatural phenomena by invoking spurious ‘natural’causes, based on sympathy, antipathy and occultinfluences.

It did not matter that the majority ofthe population of eighteenth-century England hadpossibly never heard of Boyle or Newton andcertainly could not have explained the nature oftheir discoveries.

They are victims of society'sconstant pressure towards intellectualconformity.22 Under this pressure the magicianhas ceased to command respect, and intellectualprestige has shifted elsewhere.2. New technology"},{"pageNumber":1293,"pageContent":"It is thus possible to argue that these primitivebeliefs declined because they had come to be seenas intellectually unsatisfactory. But it must beconfessed that the full details of this process ofdisillusion are by no means clear. One cannotsimply attribute the change to the scientiɹcrevolution. There were too many ‘rationalists’before, too many believers afterwards, for sosimple an explanation to be plausible. Let ustherefore examine the question from a diʃerentpoint of view. Instead of concentrating on theintellectual status of these beliefs let us considerthem in their social context.At this point it is worth taking account of theargument advanced forty years ago by theanthropologist, Bronislaw Malinowski.Unfashionable though Malinowski's theories noware, they nevertheless constitute one of the fewdirect assaults on the diɽcult question of why it isthat magical beliefs decline. Magic, he argued, is‘to be expected and generally to be foundwhenever man comes to an unbridgeable gap, ahiatus in his knowledge or in his powers ofpractical control, and yet has to continue in hispursuit’. As an alternative to helpless impotence,the savage falls back upon the substitute activity"},{"pageNumber":1294,"pageContent":"of magical ritual. Sometimes such rites arecombined with practical techniques, as, forexample, when vegetables are carefully plantedand watered, but also encouraged by the recitationo f charms. More characteristically, they areemployed unaccompanied to deal with unusualdiɽculties outside the normal routine. The controloffered by such magical rites is necessarily illusory,for charms cannot make crops grow or woundsheal. But, though magic in itself is vain, it hasvaluable side-eʃects. It lessens anxiety, relievespent-up frustration, and makes the practitionerfeel that he is doing something positive towardsthe solution of his problem. By its agency he isconverted from a helpless bystander into an activeagent. Magic gives primitive man conɹdence; ‘itritualises man's optimism’. Without its power andguidance, Malinowski concluded, ‘early man couldnot have mastered his practical difficulties’.23On this interpretation, therefore, the mostimportant cause of man's recourse to magic is hislack of the necessary empirical or technicalknowledge to deal with the problems whichconfront him. ‘Magic is dominant when control ofthe environment is weak.’24 When the"},{"pageNumber":1295,"pageContent":"appropriate techniques become available, magicgrows superɻuous and withers away. Only in thecase of those problems to which men still have noadequate solution does it retain its appeal. It isscience and technology which make magicredundant; the stronger man's control of hisenvironment, the less his recourse to magicalremedies.This explanation does not of course make clearwhy magical rituals should take one form ratherthan another, for it leaves aside the origin of themental ingredients which go to make up individualmagical fantasies and beliefs. But it does oʃer anexplanation of why magic is invoked at one timerather than another. When applied to the facts ofsixteenth- and seventeenth-century society, itmakes a good deal of initial sense. The purposesfor which most men had recourse to charms orcunning men were precisely those for which anadequate alternative technique was lacking. Thusin agriculture the farmer normally relied upon hisown skills; there are no magical charms extant forsuch automatic tasks as reaping corn or milkingcows. But when he was dependent oncircumstances outside his control – the fertility ofthe soil, the weather, the health of his animals – he"},{"pageNumber":1296,"pageContent":"was more likely to accompany his labours withsome magical precaution. There were all thetraditional fertility rites and seasonal observances:Plough Monday to ensure the growth of the corn;wassailing to bless the apple trees; Rogationprocessions and Midsummer ɹres for the crops;corn dollies at harvest time.25 In Colchester in1532 a smith's wife was said to practise magic ‘tomake folks believe they should have a sely [lucky]plough’.26 In the absence of weed-killers, therewere charms to keep weeds out of the corn, and, inplace of insecticide and rat-killers, magicalformulae to keep away pests.27 There were alsocharms to increase the land's fertility.28Similar precautions surrounded other potentiallyuncertain operations. Care was taken to time suchtasks as sowing corn or cutting trees to harmonizewith the phases of the moon or some otherpropitious factor.29 There were divinatory systemsfor ascertaining the weather or the future price ofcorn.30 There were charms to make horses workharder, to protect cows from witchcraft, to procurehealthy stock, and even to inɻuence the sex offuture calves.31 Bee-keeping and chicken-raising"},{"pageNumber":1297,"pageContent":"had their semi-magical precautions.32 So did themaking of bread, beer, yeast and butter – spheresin which witchcraft was particularly feared. Ritualprecautions surrounded other householdoperations: no menstruating woman, for example,could ever pickle beef or salt bacon.33 Similarprescriptions related to hunting and ɹshing, bothspeculative activities; in the ɹshing trade the fearof witchcraft lingered until the nineteenthcenury.34 There was also magic designed tocounter human deɹciences, moral and physical:charms to prevent the crops being robbed, herbs toallay weariness at the plough, devices like spittingon one's hands to give renewed energy for work.35In many other occupations magical aids werealso invoked when problems were too great to besolved by human skill. The dangers of seafaringmade sailors notoriously superstitious andgenerated a large number of ritual precautionsdesigned to secure favourable weather and thesafety of the ship.36 The risks of militaryadventure encouraged the use of amulets andprotective talismans of many kinds. Thedeɹciencies of contemporary medicine drove the"},{"pageNumber":1298,"pageContent":"sick into the hands of the cunning men and wisewomen. The slowness of communications and thelack of a police force fostered dependence uponvillage wizards for the recovery of stolen goodsand missing persons. Ignorance of the futureencouraged men to grasp at omens or to practisedivination as a basis for making decisions. All suchdevices can be seen as attempts to counter humanhelplessness in the face of the physical and socialenvironment.Correspondingly, the decline of magic coincidedwith a marked improvement in the extent to whichthis environment became amenable to control. Inseveral important respects the material conditionsof life took a turn for the better during the laterseventeenth century.

Printed news-sheets began in theearly seventeenth century, proliferated during theInterregnum and, though checked until 1695 bythe licensing laws, had become an indispensablefeature of London life by the end of the century.Thereafter they spread to the provinces. Between1701 and 1760 a hundred and thirty provincialnewspapers had made at least a temporaryappearance, and they emanated from no fewerthan ɹfty-ɹve diʃerent towns.38 A penny postwas introduced in London in 1680 and the letter-carrying service greatly improved thereafter.39These developments were accompanied by anincrease in popular literacy, which may havereached a peak in the third quarter of the"},{"pageNumber":1300,"pageContent":"seventeenth century, when nearly forty per cent ofthe adult male population may have been able toread.40 Changes in the mobility of the populationare harder to measure, but it is clear that even inTudor England the village population was neverconstant. In the later seventeenth century mobilitymay have increased with the growth of newindustries and the constant movement in and outof London.41 The general eʃect of all these trendswas to keep the provinces more closely in touchwith the metropolis, to break down local isolationand to disseminate sophisticated opinion.Also important were the advertisements whichthe newspapers had begun to carry. Notices aboutlost property and missing persons were a featureof the Commonwealth news-sheets and continuedthereafter. Lost dogs, stolen horses, runawayapprentices, suspected thieves – all could now benotiɹed to a wider public than the village wizardor town crier had ever been able to command.

The need for the cunning man wasaccordingly reduced.Meanwhile certain devices were introduced tolessen the incidence of human misfortune. Greatersecurity for men of property was provided by therise of deposit banking, but nothing yields greatertestimony to the new spirit of self-help than thegrowth of insurance at the end of the seventeenthcentury. Of course, schemes designed to cushionsuʃerers from theft, ɹre, sickness or other disasterswere not without precedent. Many of the gilds ofmedieval England had operated as friendlysocieties, taking common responsibility for the costof burying their members or recompensing theirlosses by ɹre.

For most inhabitantsof late Tudor and Stuart England ɹre, ɻood, or thesudden death of a close relative could mean totaldisaster.Steps to provide artiɹcial security against suchhazards were ɹrst taken by merchants andshipowners. Marine insurance developed infourteenth-century Italy and had taken root inEngland by the mid-sixteenth century. In 1574indeed the notaries were claiming to haveregistered policies ‘time out of mind’.44 But for along time the system remained rudimentary.Underwriting was done by individuals rather thancompanies and most traders only thought aboutinsuring their goods when the ship was alreadyoverdue. The insurance of ships as well as thegoods they carried did not become common untilthe reign of William III. The law relating to thearbitration of insurance disputes also remainedunsatisfactory. In such circumstances manymerchants preferred to lighten their risks bydividing ownership of the ship and its goodsbetween a number of diʃerent individuals. Allthese uncertainties were reɻected in the numerous"},{"pageNumber":1303,"pageContent":"insurance problems which were brought toastrologers like William Lilly. But in the earlyeighteenth century the situation changed, with thedevelopment of Lloyds coʃee-house as a regularmeeting-place for underwriters and the foundationin 1720 of two substantial joint-stock companiesdevoted to marine insurance, the LondonAssurance and the Royal Exchange.45Other types of insurance were also emerging.The coverage of goods travelling overland bywagon or cart seems to have appeared by the endof Charles II's reign.46 Fire insurance developed atmuch the same time. This was primarily as a resultof the great Fire of London, though variousprojectors had come forward with ɹre schemesduring the early seventeenth century,47 and therehad been a number of unsuccessful attempts atunderwriting before 1680, when Nicholas Barbonannounced the foundation of his Fire Oɽce. Hiswas the ɹrst of a trio of successful insurancecompanies: the Fire Oɽce (1681; subsequently thePhoenix), the Friendly Society (1684), and theHand-in-Hand (1696). The Fire Oɽce levied apremium of 6d. per £1 rental value for brickhouses (1/ - for wooden ones); the other"},{"pageNumber":1304,"pageContent":"companies ran on a mutual basis, calling onmembers to meet losses as they arose. All three dida brisk business which reɻected the enormousdemand for security of this kind. The Fire Oɽceinsured 4,000 houses in its ɹrst four years, whilethe Hand-in-Hand had issued 7,313 policies by1704, covering houses to the value of £1,284,615in brick and £125,767 in timber.48 These earlycompanies conɹned their activities to London,however, and dealt only with houses. But in theearly eighteenth century ɹre insurance wasextended to household goods and trading stock,and to other parts of the country. Of the severalsubstantial companies erected for this purpose thebest known was to be Charles Povey's oɽce, whichwas set up in 1706 and became the Sun in 1710;by 1720 it had issued over 17,000 policies coveringgoods in many parts of the country to the value of£10,000,000.49Life insurance was slowest to evolve, though ithad long been possible to indemnify lives for shortperiods against deɹned risks.

The construction of ‘life tables’showing an individual's expectation according tohis age was ɹrst attempted by the Londonhaberdasher, John Graunt, whose Natural andPolitical Observations... upon the Bills of Mortality(1662) laid the foundations of the science ofdemography. Thirty-one years later a moresystematic life table, based on ɹgures for Breslau,was compiled by the astronomer, Edmond Halley,and from it was devised a method for calculatingthe purchase price of annuities.51 Thesetechniques were to be reɹned in the eighteenthcentury.Between 1699 and 1720 there were over ɹftyseparate projected schemes of life insurance, ofwhich the Amicable Society (1706), based on amodiɹed tontine principle, was the only one tosurvive the South Sea Bubble. Statistical ignorance"},{"pageNumber":1306,"pageContent":"was the undoing of most of these early ventures,for, without the appropriate mathematicaltechniques, they could do no more than createfunds by subscription, out of which anunpredictable sum would be paid on a man'sdeath. Only in 1762 did the Society for EquitableAssurances successfully develop a standardizedcontract, whereby the sum insured and the annualpremium could be systematically adjusted to ɹt thesubscriber's age at entry.52But although early insurance of most kinds wasa speculative business, its long-term implicationswere immense. Despite initial hesitations,insurance established itself during the eighteenthcentury as one of the most basic sources of securityfor the English middle classes. By 1805 the value ofgoods insured in England was in the order of £240million.53 At a lower social level the eighteenthcentury saw the launching of pioneer insuranceschemes by industrial ɹrms for their employeesand the proliferation of working-class friendlysocieties. Nothing did more to reduce the sphere inwhich magical remedies were the only form ofprotection against misfortune. For, as DanielDefoe remarked in 1697, the principle of mutual"},{"pageNumber":1307,"pageContent":"insurance made it possible for ‘all thecontingencies of life [to] be fenced against... asthieves, ɻoods by land, storms by sea, losses of allsorts, and death itself’.54Another sphere in which a new eʃort was madeto combat misfortune directly rather than bysubstitute remedies was that of ɹre-ɹghting.55 Thehand-squirt was introduced to England in the lastdecade of the sixteenth century, and considerableinterest was shown in devising mechanicalmethods for projecting water. The manual ɹre-engine, with which a gang of men could raisewater to a height, was ɹrst patented in 1625. Itwas developed and popularized in the laterseventeenth century, a period when many towngovernments purchased their ɹrst ɹre-engines. Theleather hosepipe was a Dutch invention, broughtto England in the 1670s. The subsequent inventionof the air chamber made possible a steady streamof water instead of a pulsating jet. The earlyinsurance companies ran their own ɹre brigades,and the beginning of the eighteenth century sawthe introduction of the ɹre-escape. In the reign ofQueen Anne an Act of Parliament required everyLondon parish to possess a large ɹre-engine, a"},{"pageNumber":1308,"pageContent":"hand-squirt, a leather pipe, and a socket forattachment to the street water supply. After theFire of London many towns banned or re-bannedthatched roofs and wooden buildings, and therewas a steady increase in the use of brick. None ofthese measures eliminated the risk of ɹre or madeit very much easier to control. But theyrepresented an advance on the meagre ɹre-ɹghting equipment of most Tudor municipalities,and they reɻected faith in the ultimate possibilityof a technical solution.Contemporaries thus gradually grew lessvulnerable to certain kinds of disaster. They alsodeveloped new kinds of knowledge to supersedemystical explanations of misfortune in terms ofwitches, ghosts or divine providence. Here thesocial sciences were as important as the naturalones. Embryonic economics and sociology haddeveloped considerably during the period. By theend of the seventeenth century, it wascommonplace for intellectuals to reveal theirawareness of the extent to which economic andsocial hardships could be attributed to impersonalcauses, and of the way in which education andsocial institutions could explain the diʃerences"},{"pageNumber":1309,"pageContent":"between diʃerent peoples and diʃerent socialclasses.56 This was to be one of the main themesof the Enlightenment. The explanatory aspirationsof astrological inquiry were taken over by thesenew disciplines. They rejected the notion thatsocial phenomena were purely random; everyevent, they held, had a cause, even if it was stillhidden. This was why Bacon listed Fortune as anon-existent entity. It was to be replaced by newhistorical laws. ‘No government is of so accidentalor arbitrary an institution as people are wont toimagine,’ thought James Harrington, ‘there beingin societies natural causes producing theirnecessary eʃects as well as in the earth or theair.’57 The immediacy of the doctrine of divineprovidence was inevitably much reduced by thisassumption that God had bound himself to workthrough sociological causes as well as physicalones. Witch-beliefs, by contrast, were less aʃectedat ɹrst, for they were concerned to explainindividual misfortunes, whereas the aim of thesocial sciences was to account for socialdevelopments as a whole.

The formulation of theories ofprobability was the work of a long series ofEuropean mathematicians Cardan, Fermat,Huygens, Pascal, the Bernouillis and de Moivre.But Englishmen made a distinctive contributionthrough the empirical study of mortality tables byGraunt, Petty and Halley; and the Royal Societyshowed considerable interest in the subject. In thelast decade of the seventeenth century probabilitytheory was widely discussed in English scientiɹccircles.58 It was also in the later seventeenthcentury that the word ‘coincidence’, in the sense ofthe juxtaposition of causally unrelated events, ɹrstappeared.

For what waspolitics, but ‘a kind of analysis of the quantity ofprobability in casual events’? There were, thoughtArbuthnot, very few topics incapable of beingreduced to mathematical reckoning.59It was this nascent statistical sense, orawareness of patterns in apparently randombehaviour, which was to supersede much previousspeculation about the causes of good or badfortune. Today it is even possible to predict thelikely number of fatal accidents or crimes ofviolence in the coming year. We take steps tohedge ourselves against misfortunes, but if theyhappen to us we do not feel the need to seekmystical causes for their occurrence.

New aspirationsThe decline of magic was thus accompanied by thegrowth of the natural and social sciences, whichhelped men to understand their environment, andof a variety of technical aids – from insurance toɹre-ɹghting – by which they were able to increasetheir control of it.

For the correspondence between magicand social needs had never been more thanapproximate. It is true that magic was seldominvoked when a technical solution was available.But the corollary is not true: the absence of atechnical remedy was not of itself suɽcient togenerate a magical one. For magic wasconservative in subject-matter, as well as in itstechniques.

Society's magicalresources were the result of its cultural inheritance,as much as of its current problems. Magic hasalways had to come from somewhere.60 In Tudorand Stuart England it came from the medieval andclassical past, and it was slow to adapt itself tonew situations.This brings us to the essential problem. Why wasit that magic did not keep pace with changingsocial circumstances? Why did its sphere becomemore limited, even as the English economy wasexpanding into new domains? For the paradox isthat in England magic lost its appeal before theappropriate technical solutions had been devisedto take its place. It was the abandonment of magicwhich made possible the upsurge of technology,not the other way round. Indeed, as Max Weberstressed, magic was potentially ‘one of the mostserious obstructions to the rationalisation ofeconomic life’. The technological primacy ofWestern civilization, it can be argued, owes asizeable debt to the fact that in Europe recourse tomagic was to prove less ineradicable than in other"},{"pageNumber":1314,"pageContent":"parts of the world.61 For this, intellectual andreligious factors have been held primarilyresponsible. The rationalist tradition of classicalantiquity blended with the Christian doctrine of asingle all-directing Providence to produce whatWeber called ‘the disenchantment of the world’ –the conception of an orderly and rational universe,in which eʃect follows cause in predictablemanner. A religious belief in order was a necessaryprior assumption upon which the subsequent workof the natural scientists was to be founded. It wasa favourable mental environment which madepossible the triumph of technology.There is inevitably a chicken-and-the-eggcharacter to any debate as to whether economicgrowth produces its appropriate mental characteror is produced by it. Most sociologically-mindedhistorians are naturally biased in favour of theview that changes in beliefs are preceded bychanges in social and economic structure. But sofar as magic and technology are concerned, itseems indisputable that in England the former wason the wane before the latter was ready to take itsplace. The fourteenth-century Lollards whorenounced the Church's supernatural protection"},{"pageNumber":1315,"pageContent":"against disease and infertility had no eʃectivealternative to put in its place. Their doctrines gavethem spiritual security, but no new means ofmaterial aid. Neither did the Reformation coincidewith any technological revolution: the men of thesixteenth century were more or less as vulnerablein face of epidemics, bad harvests, illness, ɹre, andall the other environmental hazards as theirmedieval predecessors. Yet many were able todiscard the apparatus of the Church withoutdevising a new magic in its place.In the later seventeenth century the moregeneral rejection of magic was stillunaccompanied by the discovery of new remediesto ɹll the gap. It is often said that witch-beliefs area consequence of inadequate medical technique.But in England such beliefs declined beforemedical therapy had made much of an advance. Itis true that the seventeenth century witnessednotable contributions to the study of physiology,anatomy and botany. No history of medicine canomit mention of the work of Harvey on thecirculation of the blood, of Glisson on rickets,Willis on the nervous system, and Sydenham onepidemics. The invention of the microscopeenabled Robert Hooke to pioneer the study of the"},{"pageNumber":1316,"pageContent":"cell and paved the way for the eventual discoveryof bacteria and the formulation of the germ theoryof disease. Robert Boyle's chemical inquiriesdestroyed the whole basis of the old humoralphysiology.But so far as actual therapy was concerned,progress was negligible. Harvey's great discoveryhad no immediate practical consequences. ‘Itseemed to illustrate the theory of medicine,’declared a contemporary, ‘yet it made noimprovement in the practice thereof.’6 2 The sadtruth, wrote another, was that although physicianshad laboured mightily in chemistry and anatomy,they had added almost nothing to the diagnosis ofdisease (and, we might add, even less to itscure).63 ‘It was necessary to obtain clear conceptsof the action of the body in health,’ explains amodern historian of medicine, ‘before venturinginto discussion of its action in disease.’64 Indeed ithas recently been argued that, with the exceptionof smallpox inoculation, introduced in theeighteenth century, medical innovations did littleto increase the expectation of life until at least thenineteenth century, and made no substantialcontribution, sanitary reform apart, until the"},{"pageNumber":1317,"pageContent":"second quarter of the twentieth.65 This may beunduly pessimistic.66 But it seems clear that theexpectation of life at birth was lower in the lateseventeenth century than it had been in the reignof Elizabeth I; it did not regain its mid-Tudor leveluntil the late eighteenth century.67The diʃerence between the eighteenth andsixteenth centuries lies not in achievement but inaspiration. For the intervening period had seen thebeginning of positive eʃorts to improve the levelof medical therapy. The Paracelsians introducednew mineral remedies. Bacon wanted a systematicdrive to raise the expectation of life and improvetherapeutic medicine. Sydenham pioneeredepidemiology, looking forward to the time ‘whenthe world, valuing learning for that only thereinwhich is necessary for the good of human life, shallthink as well of him that taught to cure disease asthose that taught to discourse learnedly aboutthem’.68 Growing overseas trade with the Eastmade possible a new pharmacology; the volume ofdrugs imported by the end of the seventeenthcentury was at least twenty-ɹve times what it hadbeen at the beginning. Only a few of these, such asquinine for malaria and guiacum for syphilis, were"},{"pageNumber":1318,"pageContent":"to gain a permanent place in the medicalpharmacopoeia, but their introduction reɻected asigniɹcant urge to experiment.69 The eighteenthcentury saw the founding of nearly ɹfty newhospitals.70 Whether these institutions did more tospread disease than to cure it is debatable. But,whatever their merits, they helped to displace theamateur, the empiric and the wise woman. Theyalso reflected a new practical, optimistic attitude.The same spirit of practical self-help can be seenin preventive medicine. Seventeenth-centurytowns took increasingly strenuous precautions toprotect themselves from the plague, by enforcinghygiene, shutting up victims, and imposingrestrictions upon the movement of goods andpersons from infected areas. There was nothingpassive or fatalistic about their attitude,71 for, aswe have seen, the belief in providence was quitecompatible with faith in self-help: a combinationquaintly expressed by the witness in anElizabethan lawsuit who said of a man thrownoverboard into West Looe harbour that he wouldhave drowned, ‘but that God provided a remedyfor him by swimming’.72 Few of the innumerablewriters who regarded plague as a punishment for"},{"pageNumber":1319,"pageContent":"sin took a completely fatalist position. They allbegan by urging their readers to repent, but mostof them ended by advising them to practise betterhygiene, to employ suitable medicine, and, failingall else, to run away.Of course, contemporaries did not succeed indiagnosing the causes of plague. They neverlearned to associate the disease with the black rat,and the plague's disappearance in the laterseventeenth century owed little to human agency,save in so far as it may have been helped by animprovement in living conditions. But it would bewrong to blame the fatalistic element incontemporary theology for this intellectual failure.The fault lay more with the upper classes andintellectuals, who cared less about plague thanthey might have done, because they knew it wasprimarily a disease of the poor. This wasundoubtedly the reason for the relativeindiʃerence displayed by the Royal College ofPhysicians. The preacher, William Gouge, alsorevealed the social limits to his sympathies in1631, when he declared that it was lawful forthose who wished to ɻee from the plague-strickenarea, with three exceptions: the magistrates,because they had special responsibilities; the aged,"},{"pageNumber":1320,"pageContent":"because they were less vulnerable to infection; and‘the poorer and meaner sort’, because they ‘are notof such use, but may better be spared’.73In medicine, as elsewhere, therefore,supernatural theories went out before eʃectivetechniques came in. In the eighteenth century, forexample, physicians ɹnally ceased to regardepilepsy as supernatural, although they had notyet learned to understand it in any other way. Butthey now grasped that the problem was a technicalone, open to human investigation, whereas ahundred years earlier, as a contemporaryremarked, people were ‘apt to make everything asupernatural work which they do notunderstand’.74 The change was less a matter ofpositive technical progress than of an expectationof greater progress in the future. Men becamemore prepared to combine impotence in the faceof current misfortune with the faith that atechnical solution would one day be found, muchin the spirit in which we regard cancer today. AsSir Robert Filmer expressed it in 1653, ‘There bedaily many things found out and daily more maybe which our fore-fathers never knew to bepossible.’75 Meanwhile contemporaries showed"},{"pageNumber":1321,"pageContent":"more of that ability to tolerate ignorance whichhas been deɹned as an essential characteristic ofthe scientific attitude.76In other spheres also magic declined without anyimmediate prospect of a technical substitute.Dwindling reliance on love-potions did notcoincide with the invention of some more certainmeans of gaining the aʃections of another person,however much faith was placed in the power ofcosmetics, deodorants or seductive manners andclothes. Nor has the place of the village wizardever been fully taken by the police force and theadvertisement columns of the newspapers: today'sagencies for detecting thieves and recoveringmissing property are only moderately successful.Nor can the decline of divination be explained interms of the growth of superior methods ofprediction. The scientists of the seventeenthcentury devoted much eʃort to improving methodsof weather-forecasting77 and this type ofprognostication is no doubt now more advancedthan it was. So is the prognosis of the outcome of adisease. But the prediction of future events is morediɽcult today than it ever was in the relativelystatic, custom-bound society of the past. There is a"},{"pageNumber":1322,"pageContent":"wider range of choices open to the individual anda more complex range of circumstances to takeinto account. The wonder is not that older systemsof divination should have lasted so long, but thatwe should now feel it possible to do without them.The investment programmes of modern industrialɹrms, for example, require decisions to be takenabout future policies at times when it is oftenimpossible to form a rational view of theiroutcome. It is not surprising that industrialistssometimes use barely relevant statisticalprojections in order to justify what is essentially aleap in the dark,78 or that individuals haverecourse to private oracles of the coin-tossing kind.But no businessman would admit to hisshareholders that this was how he used statistics,and private oracles are taken to be a symptom ofneurosis.79 The decline of divination has thus lefta gap which society is as yet unable to fill. Perhapsone day the social sciences will take over the roleonce discharged by astrology, as they becomeincreasingly orientated towards forecasting thefuture.80 If so, this will be a belated attempt toemulate the prophetic beliefs of the past.The change which occurred in the seventeenth"},{"pageNumber":1323,"pageContent":"century was thus not so much technological asmental. In many diʃerent spheres of life theperiod saw the emergence of a new faith in thepotentialities of human initiative. The energetic ifunsuccessful Tudor eʃorts to control poverty andeliminate vagabondage were continued andextended. Agricultural writers campaigned againstwhat they called ‘the pattern of ancientignorance’, just as politicians rejected the appealto precedent. It was a sustained period ofinnovation, of experiment with ley farming, fendrainage, and new crops: fertilizers in place offertility rites. ‘If one experiment fail,’ wrote JohnNorden in 1607, ‘try a second, a third, andmany.’81 In industry there were innovations ofmany kinds, and the prolonged experiment withways of using coal in the manufacture of ironreached the eve of successful completion. Equallynotable faith in the potentialities of activism andexperiment was displayed by the radical groups ofthe Interregnum, who proposed to remodel thewhole of society by legislative action. Their hopeswere dashed by the Restoration, but the notionthat political remedies could be found for socialand economic discontent was less easily checked."},{"pageNumber":1324,"pageContent":"But it was above all the scientists who embodiedthese new aspirations. Francis Bacon listed asdesiderata the prolongation of life, the restitutionof youth, the curing of incurable diseases, themitigation of pain, the speeding up of naturalprocesses, the discovery of new sources of food,the control of the weather, and the enhancementof the pleasures of the senses. He wanteddivination put on a natural basis so that it wouldbe possible to make rational predictions of theweather, the harvest, and the epidemics of eachyear. His aspirations were the same as those of theastrologers, the magicians and the alchemists,even if the methods he envisaged were diʃerent.He disliked their clandestine habits and dismissedtheir beliefs as having ‘better intelligence andconfederacy with the imagination of man thanwith his reason’. But he conceded that their ‘end orpretences’ were ‘noble’.82Science itself retained some magical overtones,manifested in a preoccupation with theachievement of marvellous eʃects and a desire tooutdo the magicians at their own game. Scientistswere often more interested in devising conjuringtricks or secret writing than in catering for"},{"pageNumber":1325,"pageContent":"contemporary social needs. Yet even at their mostfanciful the scientists and inventors of theseventeenth century reveal a breath-taking faith inthe potentialities of human ingenuity. It can beseen in the inventions for which patents weregranted during the years before the Civil War.Here are machines for perpetual motion, enginesfor ploughing without horses or oxen, boats whichwill sail in all weathers, devices to improve thefertility of the earth, to make houses immune toɹre and ɻood, to control the winds, and to sendthe insomniac to sleep, ‘either with musical soundsor without’.83 John Wilkins's Mercury (1641)contained a variety of formulae whereby ‘a manmay with privacy and speed communicate histhoughts to a friend at any distance’. This was inthe tradition of the Elizabethan Leonard Digges,who, like a wizard, had boasted that his telescopeenabled him to declare what was happening sevenmiles oʃ; or of John Napier, who devised mirrorsto catch the sun's rays and burn enemy ships whilethey were still far away. In Mathematical Magick(1648) (so called ‘in allusion to vulgar opinion,which doth commonly attribute all such strangeoperations unto the power of magic’), Wilkinscontinued these eʃorts with projects for"},{"pageNumber":1326,"pageContent":"submarines and ‘flying chariots’.84The methods of the scientists were diʃerent fromthose of the magicians. They stood for controlledexperiment and innovation. Their ɻexibility madethem ready to consider new problems as theyarose. They gradually lost their attitude ofreverence for the hermetic wisdom of the past andcame to recognize that there was no precedent fortheir achievements. Above all they relied onunaccompanied human aid. But their ambitionswere much like those of the magi. ‘The end of ourfoundation,’ says Bacon's spokesman in NewAtlantis, ‘is the knowledge of causes and the secretmotions of things and the enlarging of the boundsof human empire, to the eʃecting of all thingspossible.’85 In the long run natural science was tochange the relationship of man to hisenvironment. By the mid twentieth century,scientiɹc mastery over nature was such that itseemed to some that men had become gods.864. SurvivalWe are, therefore, forced to the conclusion thatmen emancipated themselves from these magical"},{"pageNumber":1327,"pageContent":"beliefs without necessarily having devised anyeʃective technology with which to replace them.In the seventeenth century they were able to takethis step because magic was ceasing to beintellectually acceptable, and because theirreligion taught them to try self-help beforeinvoking supernatural aid. But the ultimate originsof this faith in unaided human capacity remainmysterious. We do not know how the Lollardswere able to ɹnd the self-reliance necessary tomake the break with the Church magic of the past.The most plausible explanation seems to be thattheir spirit of sturdy self-help reɻected that of theiroccupations. Few of these early heretics weresimple agriculturalists dependent on theuncontrollable forces of nature. In the ɹfteenthcentury most of them were artisans – carpenters,blacksmiths, cobblers, and, above all, textile-workers.87 They spoke of religion in practicalterms, rejecting the miracle of the Mass, because‘God made man and not man God, as thecarpenter doth make the house, and not the housethe carpenter’; or asserting that ‘Ball the carpenteror Pike the mason could make as good images asthose which were worshipped’.88 Their trades"},{"pageNumber":1328,"pageContent":"made them aware that success or failure dependedupon their unaided eʃorts, and they despised thesubstitute consolations of magic.Certainly it is usual to assume that the faith inself-help could not have originated in a purelyagrarian environment. ‘There is less magic intwentieth- than in sixteenth-century England,’writes Dr Christopher Hill, ‘because there is moreindustry. Magic is agrarian.’89 ‘Agriculturists,’declared H. T. Buckle in the mid nineteenthcentury, ‘are naturally, and by the verycircumstances of their daily life, more superstitiousthan manufacturers, because the events with whichthey deal are more mysterious, that is to say, morediɽcult to generalize and predict.’90 Thisassumption was held by David Hume, whoobserved that ‘in proportion as any man's courseof life is governed by accident, we always find thathe increases in superstition’.91 But it goes back tothe seventeenth century itself, for even then thecountryman, being more dependent on the forcesof nature, was thought to be more aware of thesupernatural. ‘In this respect,’ commented aJacobean clergyman, ‘the frequency of sermonsseems most necessary in cities and great towns,"},{"pageNumber":1329,"pageContent":"that their inhabitants, who... see for the most partbut the works of men, may daily hear Godspeaking unto them: whereas such as areconversant in the ɹelds and woods continuallycontemplate the works of God.’92 As ThomasFuller remarked, “Tis not the husbandman, but thegood weather, that makes the corn grow.’93But in fact it is not obvious that magic wasessentially agrarian. On the contrary, the evidenceof other societies suggests that crafts and simplemanufacturing techniques can acquire a good dealof mystery for the uninitiated. Tools can beworshipped as quasi-fetishes; ceremonial rules canbe devised to accompany technical procedures;and any specialized occupation can assume amagical charisma: smiths and metal-workers, inparticular, have magical associations among manyprimitive peoples.94 In medieval England therewere charms and magical observances surroundingthe spinning and weaving of cloth.95 In the earlyindustrial period the mining industry generated ahost of semi-magical practices, ranging from thebelief in the existence of subterranean spirits or‘knockers’, to a taboo on such actions as whistlingunderground or working on Good Friday. It also"},{"pageNumber":1330,"pageContent":"propagated a magical method of ɹnding ore: thedivining rod, cut and used in a highly ritualmanner, was introduced from Germany in the midsixteenth century and became popular a hundredyears or more later.96 The building industrysimilarly gave rise to a mystic fraternity. Becauseof their mobility, masons devised a secretpassword in order to identify themselves amongstrangers. In the seventeenth century Englishmasonic lodges began to attract amateurs in seachof occult wisdom, and non-operative Freemasonrywas born.97 Facts of this kind should make uschary about drawing too facile an equationbetween agriculture and magic, industry andrationalism. Agriculture, after all, was the ɹrstsector of the British economy to becomethoroughly capitalized and developed in a‘rational’ manner. Magic was rejected by men whohad faith in the potentiality of technicalinnovation but it must be remembered that in thesixteenth and seventeenth centuries much of thisinnovation was agricultural.It would also be wrong to presuppose undue‘rationality’ on the part of seventeenth-centuryurban dwellers. It was in London that the sects,"},{"pageNumber":1331,"pageContent":"with their prophecies and healing miracles, weremost successful; and it was there that the busiestastrologers had their practices.98 London was notexempt from witchcraft accusations, and the cityseems to have harboured every kind of popularmagician. The most that can be said is that in thelong run large urban concentrations of populationproved themselves inherently unsuitable for thepractice of much of the traditional magic of thepast. Thief-magic, for example, could function wellin a tightly-knit village society, where suspectswere personally known to injured party andmagician alike; but in the later seventeenthcentury London had a population of half a million.A man could walk along the streets withoutrecognizing the people he passed, and might noteven know his neighbours. There was little roomfor the magic of the sieve and shears. As relationsgrew more impersonal there was also less room forthe type of conɻict which gave rise to witchcraftaccusations. Moreover, new ideas circulated morefreely in the cities. There was a higher rate ofliteracy and a more rapid turnover of population.By the nineteenth century traditional magicalbeliefs were largely restricted to the more intimatecommunities of the English countryside."},{"pageNumber":1332,"pageContent":"It is therefore possible to connect the decline ofthe old magical beliefs with the growth of urbanliving, the rise of science, and the spread of anideology of self-help. But the connection is onlyapproximate and a more precise sociologicalgenealogy cannot at present be constructed. Toomany of the participants in the story remainhidden from view and the representative status ofthose who are visible is too uncertain. The onlyidentiɹable social group which was consistently inthe van of the campaign against certain types ofmagic is the clergy, but their attitude tosupernatural claims in general was highlyambivalent. It does not seem possible to saywhether the growing ‘rationalism’ of naturaltheology was a spontaneous theologicaldevelopment or a mere response to the pressuresof natural science. It would make sense, no doubt,if one could prove that it was the urban middleclasses, the shopkeepers and artisans, who tookthe lead in abandoning the old beliefs, but atpresent there seems no way of doing so. Anequally convincing claim could be made for theArminian clergy of the early seventeenth centuryor the aristocratic sceptics of the Restorationperiod."},{"pageNumber":1333,"pageContent":"What can, however, be clearly seen is that bythe mid seventeenth century the new intellectualdevelopments had greatly deepened the gulfbetween the educated classes and the lower strataof the rural population. Of course, evidence of thedisdain felt by intellectuals for popular‘superstition’ can be found from classical times.But in the seventeenth century the gulf wasemphasized by the appearance of well-borncollectors of popular folklore, like Sir ThomasBrowne in his Vulgar Errors or John Aubrey in hisRemaines of Gentilisme and Judaisme; for despitetheir tolerance towards the old ways such menwere acutely conscious of belonging to a diʃerentmental world.

The religion of the nineteenth century, saidJacob Burckhardt, was ‘rationalism for the few andmagic for the many’.102 The belief in ‘judgements’was frequently upheld by inɻuential clergymen,while many persons who incurred misfortunecontinued to ask what they had done to ‘deserve’it.
