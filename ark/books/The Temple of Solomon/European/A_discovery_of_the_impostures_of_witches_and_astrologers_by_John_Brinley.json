For I sadly observe, that the common peopleare exposed to the deceipts of all Pro∣fessions: They are the Issachars of theworld; They bear the burthens of all sorts of people, and few of them have thePrerogative or the Abilities of Ba∣laam's Beast to reply; Am not I thine Ass?Even in the concerns of Religion, where we expect, not only the most in∣nocent,Page [unnumbered]but most infallible Truths, are strange Deceptions and Pious Frauds; and besidesthe little talking Schisma∣ticks, which fill our ears with the noise of Sermons, thereare greater heads, and more advanced understandings, who make it therebusiness to abuse us. The Lawyers are grown delusive, even to a Proverb, ofwhich the narrowness of some men's, and the entangled condi∣tion of othersEstates, is too great an Evidence. Physicians have their Arts also, not only ofgaining our Coin, but even of deceiving us into Death it self, from hard andunintelligible names, pretending as strange effects.

And herein I hope I shall not in the leastdisoblige any wise or good men, of what Profession soever.Page 1"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext5/90CHAP. I.That most men are naturally inclin'd to Superstition, especially the igno∣rant sort.AN Owl, an Hare, and an Old-wo∣man, was Ancient∣ly the Emblem ofSuperstition; and truly if we shall di∣ligently search into the Causes of this Error,we shall find that Ignorance, and Dotage, vain hopes, and foolish fears,groundless expectations, and casual events have been the Springs from whencethis folly proceeds, which is the Mother of all these Omens andPrognostica∣tions. It is an Ancient observation,Page 2Primus in orbe Deos timor fecit, that fear Deified the first gods, and with∣outdoubt there is much truth in the Assertion.For though the Idea of one true God, and first Principle of all things, was at firstImprinted upon the Soul of man; yet the fears of after Ages Canonized themultitude of false gods. It was a Storm, and an Eclips, that ConsecratedRomulus; and Iove him∣self had not been Master of heaven, or worshippedupon earth, had not the terrors of his Thunders advanced the conceit of hisDivinity amongst the ignorant, and fearful multitude. Hence Aulus Gelliusobserves in Noct. Att. l. 5. c. 12. That he was not on∣ly worshipped as a IuvansPater, a friend and helper of Mankind, but as a Vejovis and hurtful Deity; and"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext6/90there∣fore his image was placed in a Tem∣ple near the Capitol-with darts in hishand, to signifie his hurtful power; and therefore for this reason, VirgilPage 3in his Georgics is thought to depre∣cate these unlucky gods.In tenui labor, at tenuis non gloria, si quem.Numina laeva sinunt, audit{que} voca∣tus Apollo.Upon the like grounds the rest of the Stars, and Planets came to be reckonedamongst the gods. For the ignorance of vulgar apprehensions, conceiting that itlay in their own powers to disperse what influences they themselves pleased,were not on∣ly fearful to offend these new Deities, which themselves had created;but also took great care to win and please, lest they should send forth suchMalevo∣lent Emissions of their fury, as might be to the prejudice of Mankind, orat least the ruin of those who neglected their worship. Hence also has it come topass, that the Devil himself has had his Votaries, and hath stillPage 4his devoutest worshippers; and the cause of this has not only been envy, or desireof Revenge, which prompts men sometimes to the most wicked and unlawfulpractises; but even cowardly and melancholly apprehen∣sions. And this is"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext7/90evident, first, in that the most ignorant and Narrow∣sould people are most oftenseduced by evil Spirits, or by the weakness of their own imaginations, to practiseunlawful or unnecessary, and fruitless Arts. And secondly, in that all Witches andNecromancers in their Spells, and most solemn Invocation of Devils, have this, orthe like Form. viz. Whereas thy Servant N. is unworthy to crave the help orassistance of Good Angels, give leave to the Daemons, &c. to come to myAid. And yet these sort of abused people have as many Followers as the greatestDivines, while the ignorant multitude in all Misfortunes, Crosses and Afflictions,forthwith make their Applications toPage 5them as the most ready help.If the man be sick, where shall he have his Physick, but from one that fetches itfrom behind the Curtain? If he lie under any Misfortune, he pre∣sently betakeshimself to some Fortune-teller or Conjurer. If the Cattel be sick, the White-Witchis presently sent for to bless it.I shall therefore make it my business to undeceive the people, and to shew themthat it is altogether unlawful to have recourse to such men, who pra∣ctise unlawfulArts; that in all Trials, Crosses, and Afflictions whatever, God alone is to besought after, who suffers us sometimes to fall into grie∣vous troubles, that we maythe more devoutly call upon him.Page 6CHAP.

To see wicked men advanced to thegreatest Honours, enjoy the most splendid Fortunes, and continue in the firmesthealth, and strength of body, and vigor of mind; while others of the mosttemperate dispositions, most ho∣ly habits, and most constant Pieties, labour underthe greatest Crosses, and Misfortunes imaginable, has startledPage 7the belief of many wise and good men. At this block the ingenious PoetClau∣dian confesses that he stumbled.Sed cum Res hominum tantá caligine volviAdspicerem; laetos{que} diu florere no∣centes,Vexari{que} pios, rursus labefacta ca∣debatReligio.But when I saw things so confus'd∣ly hurl'd,And strangely tost in this our lower world,The wicked flourish, and the pious quail,My tottering belief began to fail."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext9/90There is no need to multiply exam∣ples of this kind; tis the common Fate of manto fall into these doubts. The example of the holy David may serve for all, whosefoot had well nigh sliptPage 8upon the like consideration.But if we shall enquire into the Holy Scriptures, we shall find that Afflictions comenot but by the ap∣pointment or permission of God, who governs and disposeth allthings as seemeth best to his Godly wisdom, and so as that the events of all thingsmay contribute most to his own glory, and suit best with the happiness of hisSaints. We are assured in Iob, that Afflictions come not out of the dust. Iob. 5. 6.The evil (of punishment) is from the Lord. Amos. 3. 6.☞ So the Lord smote all the first∣born of man and beast in Egypt, Exod. 21. 29.So did he Iehoram the son of Iehosophat with an incurable disease, till hisbowels fell out. 2 Chron. 21. 18, 19.

Al∣tiores Genij hoc sibi asservarunt, the higherpowers reserve these things to themselves. Now and then peradven∣ture theremay be more famous and powerful Magicians, such were Simon Magus,Apollonius Tyaneus, Pasetes, Iamblicus, Odo de Stellis, that for a time canbuild Castles in the air, repre∣sent Armies, and perform very strange Feats; but allthese end in nothing, but the power of God protects those that fear him from theirMalevolence, and destroys all these Phantasms, bringing their wicked works andPage 11the Authors of them to inevitable ru∣in. So it fared with that great ene∣my of theChristian Faith Simon Ma∣gus, who when he had been several times bafled bySaint Peter, at last, to give further demonstration of his great power, ascendedthe Capitol, giving out to the people, that he would fly up to Heaven from whencehe came, and accordingly began his flight; up∣on which Saint Peter besoughtGod, that he would not suffer the world to be deluded by his Sorceries; andforth∣with the wicked wretch fell down, and in his fall put an end at once to hisdelusions and his life. So soon can God bring to destruction all those that workwickedness.

He rather glories in deceiving us, and bringingus into all kind of misery, both temporal and eternal. Besides he can neither do usgood nor harm, but by Godspermission, and there∣fore all good men have everacknow∣ledged, that whatever befel them, was the hand of God, yea, even whenthey have known, that the most Devilish instruments have been imployed againstthem. Thus Iob concludes, The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away.Iob. 1. 21. Histerrors he called the terrors of the Lord C. 6. 4. And he said also,that God scared him with dreams, and terrified him with visions. C. 7. 14.

So fared it with Iehoram the son of Iesabel, who though he knewthe Lords hand was upon him, and his people; yet was he so impatient to endurethe misery, and so Hellishly enraged, that he Swore to take away the life of theProphet Eli. 2K. 6. 31, 33.

Him therefore did God deliver from all his troubles, anddoubled his Blessings and his Re∣wards upon, and made his end gloriousPage 14and happy. The same Method of de∣portment is observable in Saint Paul, whowhen the messenger of Satan was sent to Buffet him, betook himself to Prayer,and had deliverance.I shall proceed no further in Instan∣ces, to shew that God alone has the power tohelp us in all our needs, and likewise such a Dominion over all crea∣tures bothgood and bad, that without his permission and assistance they can do nothing. Ionly shall mention that remarkable passage of Balaam, whom Balac did imagineto have been endu∣ed with such a power, as that he could Bless, or Cursewhosoever he pleased.

There∣fore let no man think it lies in thepower of Inchanters, Witches, or any of their Associates or Assistants, theDivels, to cure those whom the LordPage 15hath smitten, or to hurt any person, whom the Lord is pleased to Bless.CHAP. III.Several strange Diseases happen only from natural Causes in which neitherDivels nor any of his Instruments have any hand.THere is nothing (as we have formerly hinted) more usual with the Commonpeople, than to ascribe to Witchcraft, all Disasters, Mischances, or Diseaseswhatever, seeming strange to vulgar sense. I shall therefore in this Chapter give abrief account of some Diseases, which though proceeding from Natural Causes, Ihave observed that the peo∣ple attribute to Sorcery; and forth∣with a Messengerin any of these Cases is dispatched, either to a Cunning∣man for a Blessing, orelse the next Old-woman is suspected for a Witch, and the Curses of all theNeighbour∣hoodPage 16hood are mustered against her.1 st.

Now this disease, being not so common as the Measles, or theSmall-Pox, the Tooth-ach, or the Ague, the Countrey people forth with cry outthere's Sorcery in the Case; cut off some of his hair, and bring it to the Wiseman.2dly.

All which thoughproceeding from natural causes; yet the vulgar is ready to be∣lieve there issomething more in the Case. And that which doth more con∣firm them in thisCreed, is either the want of able Physicians, or their in∣ability to employ them; forthey are seldom so Charitable as to make any more Recipe's, than they receive"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext18/90Gui∣nies. And so the poor people are for∣ced to go to some sorry Emperick,who 'tis certain, will do them no good, and upon that disappointment, to someCunning man, who will do them less. Nay, it has sometimes happen'd, that honestpersons have been apprehended, Arraigned, and Condemned, through theadvices of such men; for in these Cases, it is observable, that a small matter willbeget suspicion, and upon this multitudes of Proofs shall bePage 21muster'd up, and so by a ready Climax, the poor people are hurried up to theGallows it self. Such are the miseries on the one hand, and the delusions on theother hand, of the Superstitious, and ignorant Multitude.CHAP. IV.That Devils may do mischief to man or beast, without any Association with Witchor Wizard.THough we do not deny, but shall hereafter prove that there are Witches, andNecromancers, and such persons as make wicked Contracts with the Devil, tothe ruin of their own souls, and the prejudice of others; yet it is most certain, thatthe Devil often does much evil of himself (by Gods permission) without anyAsso∣ciation with any of his forementionedPage 22Instruments. For being possessed with an irreconcilable malice against thewelfare of Mankind, he goes about continually seeking whom he may de∣vour,laying hold upon all opportu∣nities and advantages, whereby he may tempt orensnare us, or disturb our peace, or endanger our Salvation. Thus in the beginingdid he enter into the Serpent, while there was yet no Witch to employ him.

He burnt his sheep also with Fire, blewdown his house upon his Children, and killed them, and at last most cruellytormented the body of Iob, and af∣frighted him with Visions and Dreams, and thiswithout any the least suspici∣on of Witchery. To these examples we may addthose, whom the Gos∣pels mention to have been possest in the days of ourSaviour; and the Herd of Swine which by Christs per∣missionPage 23were driven head-long into the Sea by a Legion of Devils. He does not alwaysneed to be set at work by his Imps and Associates. If God permit him to afflictus, either for our sins, or for the tryal of our Faith, or Patience, or any othervertues; he is soon ready to execute his Office, and to proceed to the utmost ofhis com∣mand. It is our happiness that he hath his Chains of Restraint, that hispow∣er is limited, and his malicious nature kept within its bounds, other∣wise ourcondition were miserable, even beyond relief: he would not stand to tempt some,or more fully to contract with others; but his first bu∣siness would be utterly todestroy us all. Thanks therefore be given to thee, O Almighty Iesus, who hastover∣come the Devil, and dost still reserve him in Chains to the Judgment of theLast Day."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext20/90Page 24CHAP. V.That seeing Men, or Women, or Beasts may be Afflicted from some naturalCauses, or that some persons may on purpose Counterfeit many things; or thatthe Devil himself may be the sole Worker, people ought to be cau∣tious how theyAscribe their Distempers, or Troubles to Witch∣craft.THere is nothing more com∣mon with men of Shallow un∣derstandings and Looselives, than to Ascribe every little Cross, or unfor∣tunate accident to Witchcraft.

An approved truth by the ex∣periences of all Ages, That those, who neverDream of Witches, or ever re∣gard them, are hardly at any time tormented or hurtby them: But on the contrary, such as live in suspicion of them, such as are afraidof them, or seek to please them with Gifts, have commonly some mischief done,as the Reward of their fears and jealousies. And truly the judgments of God inthis particular are very just, in punish∣ing them by the same instruments they stoodin fear of, who have more awePage 26for the Devil, than confidence in God.3dly. All do grant, which have any knowledge in the power of Witches, that theywork only by the Devil; for though themselves do Threaten, Curse, make Images,and the like; yet the Devil is the great Instrument that works the Mischief.Therefore the advice of Saint Iames is not unseaso∣nable in this Instance. Resistthe De∣vil, and he will flie thee. Resist him, and he shall have no power to hurtthee, either by himself or by the in∣stigation of any Associates.

It draws mends minds from the true fear of God, making themPage 27to stand in awe of the most wicked and wretched creatures in the world, theDevil and a Witch, than which nothing can be a greater dishonour to the Creator,or more prejudicial to their own Souls.2. It bringeth honest and innocent people into suspicion and Infamy, and thehatred of all the Neighbourhood: for thus if the Horse be sick, or the Cow dead,or the Plum-tree do not blossom kindly, some harmless old woman is suspected,all her words, postures and actions are most criticaly observed, and the mostmalicious reflections made of them, that the envy of man can in∣vent. So the poorcreature comes to be hated and abused, and revil'd by all that know her, and thatinfamy shall never be wiped off her and her generation, even by her mostReli∣gious or innocent deportment of her whole life. Hence the poor woman ismade miserable all her life, and her family Scandalous to succeedingPage 28Ages, through the unreasonable fears and jealousies of foolish and inconsi∣deratepeople.

Where it may be demanded why,see∣ing there is such mention of Witches, and Sorcery, and the like, unlawful Artsin the Scriptures, they do not Ascribe any harms to them, as men do in thesedays: and the reason is, for that the Word of God doth never Assign In∣strumentsto be set on work by him, which have not power in themselvesPage 29to do what he employeth them about, whether it be Angel, Devil, or any otherCreature; and to teach us that they are but Satans slaves, and that it is not they,that do any, but that whatever is done, is the work of the Devil.CHAP. VI.That there are Witches.THat there are Witches, and such Persons as from contracts with the Devil haveundertook, and seem∣ingly performed some strange things; (though denyed bysome Sensual men of this Age, whose Interest it is, there should be neitherHeaven nor Hell, and who have therefore proceeded from the denial of the Soul,to the denial of Spirits, and from thence even to the denial of the Existence ofGod himself) is yet deducible from several reasons.Page 30"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext24/901st. And first from the most An∣cient and veracious Authority of the Word ofGod, in its forbidding such Diabolical practices, as in the first place. Deut. 18.10, 11, 12. There shall not be found among you any one, that maketh his Sonor his Daughter to pass through the Fire, or that useth Divination, or an Observerof times, or an Inchanter, or a Witch,Or a Charmer, or a Consulter with Familiar Spirits, or a Wizard, or aNecromancer.For all that do these things are an abomination to the Lord: and because of theseabominations, the Lord thy God doth drive them out before thee.From which words, it not only ap∣pears that there were those that wor∣shipedIdols, that gave themselves to Diabolical Arts; but also that for theseAbominations the Lord cast them out of the Land, and introduced his ownpeople the Israelites, strictly charging them, that they abstain fromPage 31such unlawful practices. For the Am∣monites caused their Children to passthrough the fire, not (as some have sup∣posed) to kill them, or burn them: butonly to pay a kind of Adoration to that Element.

For who can believe, that Solomon Murthered little Chil∣dren, or castthem into the Fire, be∣cause the Scripture saith of him, Cole∣bat SolomonAstharten, Deam Sidoni∣orum, & Moloch, Idolum Ammonita∣rum. And yetthis unhappy Custom hath so spread it selfever since through∣out the wholeworld, that even in America, the Brasilians do the same, as Iohannes Lerius inNav. Bras. re∣ports of them. And among Christians also Mothers did yearlycause their Children to pass over the Fire of Saint Iohn; which Custom, thoughcon∣demnedPage 32by a Council held at Constan∣tinople, and proved by Theodoret to have beenderived from this Custom; is yet retained and practised amongst those of theRomish-Church. But to leave ob∣servations, and return to our intendedBusiness.We find in the History of the Bible, the names and practices of certain Witchesand Sorcerers, as particularly we have the names of those two so famous or"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext26/90ra∣ther infamous Sorcerers of Egypt. 2 Tim. 3. 8. Dan. 2. 2. We read thatNe∣buchadnezzar had Dreamed certain Dreams, at which he was muchper∣plexed, and very desirous to know the Interpretation of them; he gaveCom∣mandment to call the Magicians and the Astrologers, and the Sorcerers,and the Chaldeans, for to shew the King his Dreams. So we have also accountsof other Witches, as Balaam, of Ieza∣bel and her Witchcrafts. 2 Kings 9. 22. ofManasses, who to the rest of his wickedness, caused his Children toPage 33pass through the fire in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom: Also he observedtimes, and used Inchantments, and used Witchcraft, and dealt with a FamiliarSpirit, and Wizards.

And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a womanwhich hath a Familiar Spirit at Endor. And Saul disguised himself, and puton other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to thewoman by night. So also did Balack send to Balaam to Curse his enemies. Allthese things were done, contrary to the practice of good Iosiah, who, as theSacred Records report, put away the workers with Familiar Spirits, and theWi∣zards, 2 Kings. 23. 24. These are such evident Proofs, that it is to me awonder that any one, who believes the Scriptures, can offer to deny the existenceof Witches, though there were no Demonstrations in these our days, to evidencethis so palpable a Truth.Page 35CHAP. VII.Of the ground of Witchcraft, and of all the Practices thereof.ALthough some persons, who have not altogether denied that there is a certainkind of Magick, will not yet be perswaded, that there is any Contract with theDevil; we shall en∣deavour to prove that there are Leagues and Covenants madebetwixt wicked persons and the Devil.1. The word Chabor, which is an Inchanter, signifies one joyned to another inLeague and Society; now we cannot suppose this League to be with any otherthan the Prince of Darkness, who Cooperates with these his Vassals, in theirblack and ungod∣ly Actions.2. From the Confessions of some of these miserable Creatures, may bePage 36"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext28/90confirmed what we here go about to Demonstrate. One Cyprian (whether theAncient Father, or some other I am not certain) avouches it from his ownexperience, who was himself once ensnared in an actual and expli∣cit Obligationwith this black Angel; but afterward through Gods mercy, was unloosed fromthsoe destructive Ties. So that as his Experience in the practice of Magick,rendred him a sufficient Witness, his Conversion to Christian Principles shouldengage us to Credit what he says, to be unfeigned.And lastly, the privy marks and brands of the Beast, found in several parts ofWitches bodies do confirm it; as also the very Copies of the Bonds, whereinWitches have confirmed their League and Familiarity with their Lord and Master,of such an one speaketh Mr. Fox, where the Bond was thrown amongst anAssembly ga∣thered together in Prayer and Fasting,Page 37for the Deliverance of a Young-Man thus engaged to Satan. But it may beobjected, that such Leagues and Con∣tracts are not needful, forasmuch as therenouncing of God, and giving ones self over to work uncleanness withgreediness, is an implicit Cove∣nant with the Devil; and that therefore no suchexpress Ceremonies are ne∣cessary, for the Holy Scriptures say, That hisServant a man is whose work he doeth, whether of unrighteousness un∣toDeath, or of Righteousness unto Salvation. To this I answer, that the Devil,who has ever since his Fall from his glorious Dignity into the Regions and powerof Darkness, and Confusion, made it his business to bring Mankind into the sameState of Damnation; and in that he could not violate the most Sacred Deity in hisown nature, he has gone about to deface his Image engraven in the Soul of man;"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext29/90does delight to imitate God, yet so as thereby to oppose him: soPage 38that as God makes a Covenant with his, so will the Devil with his; as God hath hisSeal of Covenant, so will the Devil have his mark; as God confirmeth his byBlood, so will the Devil have blood to ratifie the Cove∣nant, which he and his domake. Hence the Learned have observed, that in the times of ignorance, whenthe Devil had Dominion in the world, and through Gods permission led Cap∣tivemens minds in the dark mazes, and Maeanders of Superstition and Idolatry;those Devil-Idols in their names, had some resemblance to the Divine attributes;and also most of the Rites and Ceremonies used in the So∣lemnities of thosePagan gods, were in some measure (though not obvious to each capacity)conformable to the Divine Institutions injoyned to his people the Iews.A second reason of such Contracts may be, thereby to aggravate the sins ofWitches, and thereby to engagePage 38them deeplier to do him Service. For having led them on beyond hopes of mercy(though that, as the rest of his principles, be but a Fallacy) they will be apt towallow in all manner of Beastial and Sensual delights, and without con∣siderationplunge themselves into a desperate confusion; which conceit is increased andconfirmed in them, when they remember how they have renounced God, andgiven themselves to the Devil; who by this means holds them fast, and animatesthem to rush on, as a Horse into the Battel, to their utter ruin and destruction.And though it is sadly apparent to all those, not wholly given over to a reprobatesense, that this malicious enemy of our Souls, goes about seek∣ing all"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext30/90opportunities to hurt us; yet so sadly are these poor Creatures stu∣pified, thatthey do, Festinanti Equo calcaria adhibere, lay an obligation upon him that isready at any time to attend them. Hence is it that theyPage 39need not much soliciting to a Con∣tract, forasmuch as they think there∣by tosecure themselves of his Service, and have him always ready to prose∣cute theircommands. This is that which disposes them to the reception of such agreements,giving them (as they fondly conceit) Superiority over that mighty Spirit that rulesin dark∣ness, though on the Devils part it ex∣tends no further, than to a shortcom∣pliance with their humours in order to his detaining them from works ofre∣pentance, and a retrospection into their own wicked and wretched con∣dition.Now although upon consideration of the infinite loss accruing to men from suchactions, it may seem strange, nay almost incredible, that they should be wheedledinto such pernicious ex∣travagancies; yet if we have respect to the lamentablepropension of hu∣mane nature, to that which is con∣trary to the heavenlyInjunctions; and"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext31/90Page 41to the sinful follies proceeding from such propension, it may be sufficientDemonstration to enforce us believe this assertion; that there are such per∣sons as(besides that indirect and un∣willing Homage which is paid ever since the loss ofintegrity) do tie them∣selves in Spontaneous Indentures to the grand Master ofConfusion.No wonder then if the Devil catch those that greedily come unto his bait, since hisWiles and Devices are oft too powerful over the most Righteous and holy; doeshe not many times lie at lurch, and ensnare those who make it their business towatch a∣gainst him, and if he dares come into the most Sacred places ofDevo∣tion and Piety, to molest, no wonder if he Domineers amongst suchDebau∣cheries and impiety as is usually found in these Covenanters, who aresuch as are involved and swallowed up in Earthly thoughts and Meditations,having lost the Sense and KnowledgePage 42of Divine Mysteries; being given o∣ver of God unto Satans Temptation.

Many Examples may be had in Authors of this kind; where∣fore Ithought it needless to trouble my self about setting them down.No wonder then if such disorderly, violent, inconsiderate persons, so gree∣dy ofattaining their ends, so wholly estranged from all goodness (as these who are thesubject of our Discourse usually are) should seek for means to the Devil, to enjoytheir inordinate de∣sires, as regarding more the satisfacti∣on of their present will,then respecting their future state after death.All these things duly considered, it is not strange to think, that a man or womanmay be so seduced as to revolt from God, and make a Solemn Covenant withhis, and their utter and profest enemy.Page 44"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext33/90CHAP. VIII.That besides the forementioned open and express League, there are cer∣tainpractices used by Witches, which imply a Compact without any form of words.THough the practices of those miserable Caitifs, who do, con∣ceptis verbisjurare, to fight the De∣vils Battels, be so abominable, that no man, not whollydestitute of grace, but abhors them; yet there are ano∣ther sort, not lookt uponwith so much detestation, which ought to be as much detested, as lying under anequal pressure of Guilt with the former. I mean such as not being in actual Leaguewith Satan, perform such acts of Witchery, as do in a covert manner imply aLeague, and Homage due to their Black Master.Page 45These are such as we usually call White Witches; a sort of Sots who being Gull'd,and having their under∣standings Debauch'd by Superstition, do evil that goodmay come of it, that is, use Charms, Spells and Incan∣tations (all which are of noforce without the Cooperation of the De∣vil) to remove Distempers, and docertain Feats in some measure useful to Mankind, yet of pernicious con∣sequence"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext34/90to themselves.It may be objected, that 'tis not probable the Devil will attend those his immediateServants without some security, that they shall continue his. To this I answer, thatthey being something queasie, and not able alto∣gether to relish the openBlasphemy, and Impiety the others run into; he is contented to deal with themafter another manner, and so lets them think themselves loose, whereby he holdsthem the closer to him. He lets them make a shew of Religion, go to Church,Page 46hear the Word, and otherwise imploy themselves about seeming good things.And 'tis indeed a main Policy in the Mystery of iniquity, to appear in feignedColours.For if a man or woman delight to use Superstitious Forms of words, and thinkthere is a secret power, and force in Herbs, Minerals, or the like; and in usingthem, desireth in heart to have the thing effected; the Devil (who is ready to seizehis prey upon any occasion) to comply with them, seconds their Designs withsuccess: and so there is a secret Compact, for they have desired, and he hathcon∣sented, and wrought the Business too.Therefore those that do such things are in a kind of League with the De∣vil,though ignorantly they think otherwise; and as those which in Christs name Castout Devils, though they openly followed not Christ, yet finding success in theirattempts, werePage 47not against Christ, nor likely could speak ill of his power, by reason of theirSecret and implicit Faith, and Covenant with Christ: so these kind of personsfinding their practices suc∣cesful, are not against Satan, nor can lightly speak ill of"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext35/90his working pow∣er, because of the secret and implicit League they have withhim; more especially, because of the profit, they find insuing to them thereby. Andso he rests satisfied with this thought of them, that they will be surely his, becausethey are not against him; as also he lets them please themselves with hopes ofGods mercy. For that in thus doing, they suppose they sin not, nor are in dangerof the Devil, nor under Gods wrath, as are the others, who are profest and directVo∣taries of the Black Saint that rules in the Children of Disobedience.Page 48CHAP. IX.The reasons and grounds of Witch∣craft further Debated on.THat there are Witches, Sorce∣rers, aud such like, may be observed from whathath been said in the former Chapters; also that there are Leagues andObligations, both ex∣press and tacit; now for a further confirmation, let us a littleobserve, what Force or Efficacy there lies in natural things.That which Philosophers affirm of Nature, how she abhors a Vacuum, may wellmind us of the wonderful Connexion, and strict Ties wherewith the things of thisvisible world are linkt together amongst themselves, and the secret relation that isbetwixt these and the intellectual world, and of this cum Archetypo. This beingPage 49"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext36/90observed by the Aegyptians, they cal∣led Nature Magick, by reason of theEfficacy it has, in attractu similium per similia, & convenientium perconvenientia.This Attraction, or mutual Cohe∣rence of Superior with inferior things, theGraecians call 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, which we have Englished Sympathy.So the Earth (to explain it) agrees with the Water in that they are both alike cold;the Water with the Air in moisture; the Air with the Fire in heat; the Fire with theHeavens in purity of substance. Nor is the Fire joyned with the Water but by theAir; nor the Air with Earth, but by the Water: Stones and Mettals have quidcom∣mune with Herbs and Plants, these with Animals, Animals with theHeavens, the Heavens with Intelli∣gences, these with the Divine Attri∣butes, andwith God himself, by whose Image or similitude all things are made.Page 50The Universe is the Image of God, Man the extract or Epitome of the Universe,sensitive Creatures of Man, vegetatives of sensitives. Again, Plants agree withBrutes in vegeta∣tion; Brutes with Man in that they are both sensitive; Man withAngels in Intellectuals; Angels participate of Immortality. Divinity infuses it selfinto the mind, the Mind is com∣municated to the Intellect, the Intel∣lect to theWill, the Will to the Ima∣gination, this to Common sense, Com∣mon sense to theSenses in particular, and the Senses to the things sensible; and such is the"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext37/90Coherency of Nature, that every Superior power Commu∣nicates it self to theinferior, by a con∣tinued Series of Mediums; and every inferior being participatesof the high∣est, by being linckt to the middle Beings. So that, as things beingdispo∣sed into so wonderful Order, into a capacity and possibility of effectingmany things so remote, and unusualPage 51to what commonly happens, should Teach us to be cautious how we ascribewhatever is something strange, to Witches and Magical operations; So it mayconfirm us, that what is re∣lated concerning the Practices of these wicked people,is nothing but what is credible enough to be brought to pass, considering the greatpower of these Spirits, and the promptitude of Nature to strange effects.For 'tis the Opinion of Cornelius Agrippa, that Spirits are easily indu∣ced toobey the Dictates of Witches and Wizards, when they make use of Charms andIncantations. To which alludes Virgil, where he says,Carmina vel Coelo possunt deducere Lunam.No marvel then if the Devil insinu∣ate, and twist his power into the operations ofNature, when he is sought unto, who is ready enough to"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext38/90Page 52dance attendance, though not de∣sired.Magicians affirm, that with certain ingredients, having a Sympathy withSupernatural things, rightly disposed debitis circumstantijs, partim Physicè,partim Astronomicè, Devils may be drawn to have Commerce with men. Whichis also the opinion of Iambli∣chus, Proclus and Synesius, and of the wholePlatonick School.

Xan∣thus theHistorian tells of a young Dragon, that was restored to Life by a certain Herbapplyed to him by the Old one; and that the said Herb wrought the like Cureupon one Tillo. And Iuba tells likewise of another man in Arabia, that wasrestored to Life by the Efficacy of Herbs. It is to be observed, that it is not myDe∣sign to ascribe every thing that hap∣pens praeter vulgaria, to the working ofthe Devil and his Ministers, since Nature is so prevalent as to shew Mi∣racles: butto inculcate to my Reader, that since Nature is so strong of it self, the Votaries ofSatan may play such Feats, as makes them both ad∣mired and feared; beingaided by him, who has for many Thousand years made Remarks, and Collectedthe Experiments of this so Self-power∣ful Nature.Hence have Witches power to hurtPage 54not only in outward Goods, or in our Bodies; but they can work alterations in theMind too, by Spells, Medi∣cines, and Fumigations; stir up to Love, Hatred,Mirth, Sorrow, vex to Madness it self.

That it is of greatAntiquity cannot be denied, but who was the first Author of it is uncertain: yetits Credible that it begun at Adam, and was continued by his son Seth, andCommunicated to Posterity; in reference to which Opinion, is the Story ofSeth's Pillars; which Pillars were made (by reason of what they had heardfrom Adam, (viz.) that the World should be Twice de∣stroyed, once byWater, and after∣wards by Fire) to preserve the Scien∣ces to them that wereto replenish the Earth after the Deluge.

'Tis not to be doubted that Adam, both by reason of his Converse withAngels, and his great insight into the Intellectual world; as also by his greatknowledge of this visible world, which render'd him capable of distin∣guishingthings, and giving a name sutable to the Nature of each thing; could understandthe Nature of the Heavens, and those splendid Bodies there placed.

The Wise and ever-True God, who has made every thing good, and madenothing that was not to be of some use to man, did certainly never design thatGlorious and Resplendent part of the World, to be for a Gazing∣stock only,and not have operation or influence in the Universe; but to be a generalModerator, and Govenor of the most material Actions of Mor∣tal Bodies; ashe has reserved to him∣self the disposing of that pure substance Mans Soul.And such was his love to Mankind, that he would Teach a way whereby theymight recover part of that Knowledge was lost in the first Mans Fall andDisobedience. And so that they might not be altogether involved in Darkness,and obscurity of what was to come, he Taught them to Read in that GreatVolume, the Chief Contingencies of their Life.That what I say is probable, andPage 74not an Idle Whimsey of some Melan∣cholick Brain, is Manifest from thecommon Opinion of Learned Men among the Iews, Greeks, and Latines, andothers, who call the Heavens a Sacred Book, wherein by those Capi∣talLetters (the Stars) may be read the Events of things below. The LearnedOrigen, upon this place of Genesis, Et erunt in signa, Affirms, that the Starswere placed in this Order in the Heavens for no other end, but to shew, bytheir diverse Aspects and Figures, whatever is to happen while the Worldindures, aswell in general as in particular; yet not so, as that they were theCauses of all these things: never any such thing came into the Thoughts, muchless into the Writings of this Learned Man.

They say there is a strict Cohe∣rence, and Bond of Amity betwixt theCaelestial and Sublunary Bodies; that the Stars have certain Influences uponthe Bodies of men, which pre∣vail more or less according to their diversPositions: for example, that those who are Born in the Interlunium,"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext72/90Page 103should be weak and subject to Diseases; and that those who are Born whenthe Moon is in Conjunction with Male∣volent ill-natur'd Planets, do either diepresently, or are troubled with Epilepsies at the New-Moons: that Physiciansobserve some Diseases to increase or abate according to the se∣veral Aspectsand Positure of the Moon with other Stars.

Under Mercury, Mer∣chants?I shall now come to Answer those Arguments which Astrologers bring out ofScripture, from Reason, or Ex∣periments.First for Scriptures: to that out of Genesis, 1. 14. I answer, that they assumemore than the Sence of the words will permit; for though it be there said, thatGod set the Caelestial Lights for signs of things necessarily depending upontheir Course and Na∣ture, yet it cannot thence be infer'd, that they are alsosigns of things meer∣ly Contingent, and proceeding from the different Motionsof mans Will and Appetite.To that of the Stars fighting against Sisera in their Courses, I answer; That byStars in that place (accordingPage 120to some Interpreters) is meant An∣gels, which is plausible enough, for∣asmuchas both are promiscuously cal∣led the Host of Heaven: or it may be said, thatat that time they did not Operate by a Natural Influence, but a Supernaturaland extraordinary Power, God raising up an unusual Effect in the Stars, ofcausing Tem∣pests to the Annoyance of those Ene∣mies of his people.In that place of Iob so much by them insisted on, is nothing at all to their"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext85/90purpose: since it may with ease be Turned against them, that it is to beunderstood, that no man can under∣stand the Statutes of Heaven, but that Godhas reserved the Knowledge of such things to himself; besides, there is nothingsaid of the Influence, and Rule of the Stars over mens Minds or Actions,nothing of the knowledge of Future Events, but only Arguments of the DivineWisdom, to convince Iob of his weakness and Frailty.Page 121And though it be said, The Heavens shew forth the glory of God, and theStars declare his Handy-work; that makes not for them neither, the mean∣ingof the place being partly the same with that last mentioned, (viz.) that Castingup our Eyes to those glorious Luminaries, we may remember the power ofGod, who has made them all, and continues them in so wonder∣ful andunerring Courses.As for the Star which appeared to the Magi coming to Christ, it was noNatural but a Supernatural Star, having a Motion contrary to that of otherStars; few will (I suppose) be so impudent as to affirm, our Sa∣viour wasGoverned by the Stars, that he who Created, should be in Sub∣jection to hisCreatures. And though it appear'd at his Birth, and usher'd him into the world,yet (as St. Au∣gustine says) Non dominabatur Christo ad decretum, sedfamulabatur ad Testi∣monium,"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext86/90Page 122nec enim subjiciebat imperio, sed judicabat obsequio. To make this anArgument for their Art would be an absurdity; for if it had force andsignification in his Nativity, why had it not over all those Born at the same timewith him? I hope they will not say, that they were all to share in the sameCircumstances of Life.Let us now examine their Reasons, and see how they will stand Trial.Their first Reason is grounded up∣on a false Supposition, that there can be noother use for the Stars, than to be Characters wherein men may Read theirown Fortunes.The second likewise, (viz.) that we know no other reason for the seve∣ralMotions, and Aspects, is not good Reasoning, for 'twill not hold to Ar∣guefrom the Negation of our know∣ledge, to the Negation of the thing we cannotapprehend; so that if we cannot find what a thing is for, wePage 123cannot justly cut it out a piece of Ser∣vice, and infer a necessity of its beingdesign'd for that use we have devis∣ed to apply it to."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext87/90The third reason from the Cohae∣rence betwixt Caelestial and Sublunary thingsis no better Logick; for although they may sway the Elements, yet there is noreason they should do so in things meerly Contingent, and de∣pending upon theWill and slippery Appetites of Man: though Iupiter, or Mars, or any of therest, meeting in such an Aspect and Position one with another, may produce aTempest in the Air; yet I cannot perceive a necessity, that they must Dart aDis∣order into my Affections with their Malevolent Rays. And supposing thetime of a Nativity can be exactly ga∣thered, yet what reason can they shew forConfirmation of their Rules: they are only such as men have devised, and thatwithout any ground or WarrantPage 124from Scripture: what reason can they give that any Aspect should portend thatwhich they say it does, but only some Observation of a thing happen∣ing in thattime, which they cannot averr to proceed from that Aspect, but that it hadbeen so without it.And though Enoch, and Ioseph were given to Studies of this Nature, and thatMoses was skill'd in the Learning of the Aegyptians, and Daniel of theChaldaeans, yet it cannot be proved, that they ever favoured this way ofDivining at things to come: their knowledge proceeded from another Cause, towit, immediate Revelation; or else was gathered from certain and SolidPrinciples.It must be confessed that the Chiefest Bulwarks wherewith Astrologersde∣fend themselves, are Experiments; yet are they not so strong, but they may"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"05.05.2016A discovery of the impostures of witches and astrologers by John Brinley.http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A29517.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext88/90be Battered. For some particular Prae∣diction proving true, does not makePage 125the Rules Infallible, one amongst an hundred (perhaps made at the same time)Hitting, the rest proving False: why then should all those that Fail be slip'd byand not spoken of, or not be brought in judgment against the Art, as those fewwhich are True, are made so stifly to plead for it.Many very Eminent and Learned men have Discussed the vanity of Judi∣cialAstrology, as Picus Mirandula, Cornelius Agrippa, Franciscus Valle∣sius,and divers others, to whose Wri∣tings I refer my Reader.Galeatius Prince of Millain gave a notable Check to one of these men; whowas arrived at that height of im∣pudence, as to tell the Prince, he was shortly toDie a sudden and unusual Death, and that himself was to Live a long time afterhim.
