The project began in a planning colloquium at Claremont, California, May 31 to June 4, 1978. At this meeting, a team of scholars resolved to produce this translation volume as part of a research project on the Greek magical papyri, the project as a whole being designed as a contribution to the Cmpus Hellenirtimnt Noa' Testtamenti. The translations turncd out to be more difficult and time-consuming than had been expected. Since it seemed desirable to expand the Preisendanz collection to include as many newly discovered and newly published magical papyri as possible, the number of papyri increased from 81 to 131. In this respcct, the translation vol- ume differs from the Prcisendanz volumes. It differs also in that while Preisendanz reproduced only thc Greek sections of bilingual Greck-Demotic papyri, this volume includes the full translations of all bilingual texts. All translations are based on the Greek, Demotic, and Coptic texts. PGM I- LXXXI follow the Preisendanz edition, while PGM LXXXII-CXXX and PDM Supplement follow their critical cditions, which are indicated in the notes. Trans- lators were free to make changes in the texts when they thought it necessary; these changes are also indicated in the notes. Where earlier translations exist, they have been consulted, but all the translations included in this volume are new. Unlike the Preisendanz edition, this new volume does not have an tapparaus m'ti- cw. Instead, it has notes explaining difficulties in the text and the translation, and notes alerting readers to important information. It has been necessary to limit these notes to a degree which many readers may find drastic, but the team decided not to attempt what could only be a lengthy commentary on the papyri. Instead, they agreed that other research tools should be developed to encourage and assist further research on the papyri. The following research tools are presently being prepared: 1. An index of Greek words is being prepared by Professor Edward O'Neil. 2. A subject index based on the English translation is being worked out by Ms. Marjorie Menaul. 3. A collection of parallels between the magical papyri and early Christian litera- ture is being prepared by the research team. This part of the project is most dircctly related to the task of the Colpus HelleninicumNoa' Testamenti, namely, the collection of parallels from ancient literature to the New Testament and the other Christian literature up to approximatcly A.D. 150. 4. A comprehensive bibliography, including editions and investigations of the magical papyri, is being assembled by Professor David Hellholm. The present volume would not havc come about without the generous support of institutions and individuals. The National Endowment for the Humanities has funded the entire venture from the beginning by substantial grants from 1978 to 1983. Without this financial assistance, the project would simply not exist; schol-"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"arly team projccts of this magnitude cannot live on enthusiasm alone. Apart from the purely financial aspen, the officers of the NEH have helped more than they may realize bv their quiet cncouragement and confidence expressed ovcr a number of . years. A great deal of assistance also camc from the institutions where the project was initiated and whcre it is now based. These include the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity at Claremont, where the project was based during the years 1977 and 1978, and the Institute for the Advanced Study of Rcligion at the University of Chicago, where it has been from 1978 to the present. Thanks are especially due to the officers of thesc institutions, Professors James M. Robinson and James Brashler of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity; and Professors Joseph M. Kitagawa, formerly dean, and Franklin I. Gamwcll, currently dean, of the Divinity School of thc University of Chicago, as well as to Martin E. Marty, program coordinator for the Institute for the Advanced Study of Religion of the University of Chicago. The present project could not have succeedcd without thc unfailing loyalty and generosity of the members of the team, both contributors and consultants. Among these should be named Profcssors Jan Bergman, Walter Burkert, Franco Maltomini, and P. J. Sijpesteijn. The research specialists of the project, Professor William C. Grese (1977-SO), and Mr. Roy Kotansky and Ms. Marjorie Menaul (1980-83), not only helped to carry the burdens of administration and editorship, but made substantial contributions to the project as well. To all of them sincere thanks are due. H. D.

References cited thus refer to translations of the corresponding 262-347 Greek text of Preisendanz's Papyri Gvaecue Ma~icae, with each roman numeral (including those with appended letters, e.g., PGM Va) corresponding to a separate papyrus manuscript. Ro- man numerals after PGM LXXXI refer to texts whose transla- tions are based on editions published since, and sometimes overlooked by, Preisendanz. The bibliographies of thcsc cdi- tions are mentioned in the introductory note (*) to each spell. Arabic numerals usudy delineatc the compass of individual spells within the papyrus manuscript. Thc use of the scparate designations for each independent spell or charm represents a new feature designed to enable easy identification and ready reference to an individual spell. PDM xxi. 6-20 References listcd thus refer to Demotic (bilingual) spells corre- sponding to the texts whose editions are Listed in the introduc- tory notc (*) to each spell. PDM stands for Pa@ Demoticat! Mqicae, referring to this volume and not to be confused with DMP, an abbreviation for Griffith and Thompson, Dewtic Mgicd Papy', a work often referred to in the notes. Lower- case roman numerals are used simply to avoid confusion with spells labeled PGM. Arabic numerals are used as above. [PGM XI. PGM references bracketed thus come immediately after refcr- 44-48] enccs for bilingual Greck sections with the givcn spell. The ref- erences correspond to the appropriate Grcek portions in Prei- sendanz, whose edition contained only the Greck sections of the GreekIDemotic spells. Since this translation volume con- tains all the Demotic spells, Preiscndanz's numbering system is retained, but it is subsumed under the new Demotic collation. Texts set in roman type represent spells and portions of spells whose original language was Greek. Texts set with leader dots beneath represent spells and portions of spells whose original language was Demotic (Egyptian). Texts with a thin underscore represent spells and portions of spells whose original language was Old Coptic. Coptic is found both in the Greek texts of Preisendanz's edition and as glosses in portions ofthe DemoticiGreek bilingual spells; however, thc purely Coptic magical spells form a separate corpus not dcalt with in this volume."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Tr.: Vlct0Iy spell: Spell to be SpDh IAO SABA~TH ADONAI Refercnccs and Textual Signs An asterisk introduces an independent spell or a spell that con- tains most of the constituent parts necessary to effect the whole charm, though organic connections with adjacent spells can be recognized (e.g., spells entitled \"Anothw . . . ,\" or the like). The asterisk directs the reader to the contributor, whose name is given at the end of the spell. Some introductory comments may be found here as well. Bibliographical data, if appropriate, may also be listed. This abbreviation stands for \"translator\" or \"transcriber\" (if the text contains no recognizable words that can be translated). Phrases set in roman boldface type refer to general titles of charms which usually stand at the beginning of the spell and which are often followed by one or more subtitles. Many spells do not possess a title, either because of a scribal omission or because it has been lost in a lacuna in the text. Phrases set in italic boldface type refer to various subtitles and a number of types of rubrics (subsumed under the main title) that function in a titular sense to introduce a component fea- ture of a spell. These may introduce ingredients, additional in- structions, invocations, figures, magical names and characters, and so on, which are mentioned in the instructions in the text. In a long, multifunctional spell (cf. PGM IV. 2145-2240 and PGM XIII. 1-343), general titles are subordinate to the larger title, which describes an often elaborate ritual. In description, these general titles are identical to the main titles of most spells but are set as subtitles since they usually depend on a prior set of conditions to guarantee their efficacy. Small capital letters indicate magical names (voces mqicae) which are usually untranslatable and often meaningless to the reader. In some instances, small capital letters preserve recog- nizable Greek, Egyptian, or Semitic words that merit special at- tention. Portions of texts whose fragmentary nature precludes the possibility of proper translation, but which may in fact have been readable in the original, are also set in small capitals. A diagonal slash indicates every fifth line of translated text, cor- responding to the number given in the left-hand margin. Usu- ally these are numbered consecutively until a new papyrus num- ber is introduced. A bracketed number alongside the regular number refers to the line number of the original edition (in a GreekIDemotic text). Occasionally at the beginning the column number and line arc also cited (e.g., [Col. III,5]. A numberin parentheses refers to the original line of Preisen- danz in a GreekIDcmotic spell. The number corresponds to the PGM reference given within the bracketed number at the head of the spell."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Rcferenccs and Tcrtual Signs rxxiii ... An ellipsis in the body of the text refers to a lost portion rc- gardless of the size of the lacuna. Some punctuation (e:g., a comma or a period) may also be added at the end of the ellipsis. [spell] Brackets cnclosina a \\$,or& indicate that tlic words are not prc- served in the original tcxt. These include (1) suggested rcs- torations of lacuiiac; (2) editorial cspansions of thc tcst to elucidate the sense of the original language; and (3) phrases traditionally scr of by pointed brackets ( ), namely. nlodern corrections to scr;bal omissions or errors. Scholars interested in determining which use thc bracketed tcxt rcfcrs to are rcc- ominended to consult the texts of the original editions. As a general rule, bracketed texts will not divide a word, but rvill surround the whole word if its reading is fairly uncertain. (add the usual) Parentheses enclosing words simply indicate material in thc original texts best understood as parenthetical comments of the ancient authors and redactors. \"Come to Quotation marks enclosing words indicate material that is me. . .\" spoken (or intended to be spoken) or written (or intended to be written). Material not enclosed in quotation marks usuall)~ refers to parts of a formulary that contain instructions and di- rections apart from the matcrial to be written or spokcn. Such instructions are peculiar to the papyri that have prcscned mag- ical formularies, whereas the actual amulets and phylacteries found on papyrus usually contain simple invocations that have been transcribed as a result of following the instructions in such magical handbooks. Incantations originally writtcn in Greek meter are sct as verse, that is, they are indented en bloc, with the first letter of cach line capitalized. In cases where the meter falters within such a hym- nic portion, the original margin is restored to indicatc prose. In the magical formularies, this abbreviation stands for a name or names to be inserted by the rcadcr, the names of the persons against or for whom the magic is to be carried out. In the case of \"(the) NN matter,\" the reader understands that spccilic re- quests are to be named at this point. [R.K.K.] At thc end of each foomote, the bracketed initials refer to the contributing scholar responsible for the matcrial immediately preceding. Notes that carry no initials represent the joint ef- forts of the contributors and scholars."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Abbreviations of Periodicals, Series Titles, and General Reference Works AJA AKA APAW APAWPH ANET ANRW ARW BASP Bauer BCH BIFAO BoJ Bonnet, R&G BYZ CAH CE8 &mi., Coptic E~olo~icd Dictionary Cm, Coptic Dictwaary DMP EPRO Erman and Grapow, Worte&uch GGA GM HR HSCP NTR JAC JBL Amwican Journal ofiirchaeolo8y A~beitept zur.

The extant texts are mainly from the second century R.C. to the fifth cenrury A.D. TO be sure, this body of material represents only a small numbcr of all the magical spells that once existed.' Beyond these papyri we possess many other kinds of material: artifacts, symbols and inscriptions on gemstones, on ostraka and clay bowls, and on tablets of gold, silver, lead, tin and so forth.\" I The history of the discovery of the Greek magical papyri is a fascinating subject.\" We know from literary sources that a large number ofmagical books in which spells were collected existed in antiquity. Most of them, however, have disappeared as the result of systematic suppression and destruction. The episode about the burning of the magical books in Ephesus in the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 19: 10) is well known and typical of many such instances. According to Suetoniu~,~ Augustus or- dered 2,000 magical scrolls to be burned in the year 13 B.C. Indeed, the first ccn- turics of the Christian era saw many bumings of books, often of magical books, and not a few burnings that included the magicians themselves. As a result of these acts of suppression, the magicians and their literature went underground. The papyri themselves testify to this by the constantly recurring ad- monition to keep the books secret.' Yet the systematic destruction of the magical literature over a long period of time resulted in the disappearance of most of the original texts by the end of antiquity. To us in the nventieth century, terms such as \"underground literature\" and \"suppressed literature\" are well known as descriptions of contemporary phenomena. We also know that such literature is extremely impor- tant for the understanding of what people are really thinking and doing in a par- ticular time, geographical area, or cultural context. Magical beliefs and practices can hardly be overestimated in their importance for the daily life of the people. The religious beliefs and practices of most people wcrc identical with some form of magic, and the neat distinctions we make today between approved and disapproved forms of religion-calling the former \"religion\" and \"church\" and the latter \"magic\" and \"cult\"-did not exist in antiquity except among a few intellectuals.\" Thus the suppression of this magical literature has deprived us of one of our most important sources of ancient religious life. Modem views of Greek and Roman reli- gions have long suffered from certain deformities because they were unconsciously shaped by the only remaining sources: the literature of the culmral elite, and the archeological remains of the official cults of the states and cities. But not everything was lost.' At the end of antiquity, some philosophers and theologians, astrologers and alchemists collected magical books and spells that wcrc still available.

It is known that philosophers of the Neopythagorcan and Nco- platonic schools, as well as Gnostic and Hermetic groups, used magical books and hence must havc possessed copies. But most ofthcir matcrial vanished and what have left arc their quotations. The Grcek magical papyri arc, howcvcr, original documents and priman sources. Their discovery is as important for Grcco-Roman religions as is the discovery of the Qumran tests for Judaism or the Nag Hanunadi library for Gnosti~ism.~ Like these manuscript discoveries, the disco\\.cn of the Greek magical papyri \\\\,as and oftcn still is the outcome of sheer luck and almost incredible coincidences. In the case of the major portion ofthc collection, the so-called Anastasi collection. thc discovery and rescue is owcd to the efforts (and, if one may use the term, coopcra- tion) of nvo individuals separated by morc than a thousand years: the modern col- lector d'hastasi and the original collector at Thcbcs. In the nineteenth century, there was among the \"diplomatic\" reprcsentativcs at the court in Alexandria a man who called himself Jean d'hastasi (17801-1857). Believed to be Armenian by birth, lie ingratiated himself enough with the pasha to become the consular representative of Swede~i.~ It was a time when diplomats and military men oftcn were passionate collectors of antiquities, and M. d'Anastasi hap- pened to be at the right place at tlie right time. He succeeded in bringing together large collections of papyri from Egypt, among them sizable magical books, some of which he said he had obtained in Thebes.'\" These collections he shipped to Europe, where they were auctioned oEand bought by various libraries: the British Museum in London, the Bibliothtque Nationale and the Louvre in Paris, tlie Staatlichc Mu- seen in Berlin, and the Rijksmuscum in Leiden. Another papyrus was acquired by Jean Fransois Mimaut (1774 1837), also a diplomat, whose acquisition ended up in the Biblioth2que Nationale (PGM III).\" Unfortunately, we know almost nothing about the circumstances of the actual findings. But it is highly likely that many if the papyri from the Anastasi collection came from the same place, perhaps a tomb or a temple library.'\"f this ass~~mption is correct, about half a dozen of the best-preserved Ad largest extant papyri may havc come from the collection of one man in Thebes. He is of course unknown to us, but we may supposc that he col- lected the magical matcrial for his own use. Perhaps he was morc than a magician. We may attribute his almost systematic collcctions of qica to a man who was also a scholar,'~robably philosophically inclined, as well as a bibliophile and archivist concerned about the preservation of this material.I4 Although the person who collected the Anastasi papyri remains unknown, com- parable figures are known from later Egyptian literature. In the Demotic Papyrus no. 30646 in the Cairo Museum, there appears Prince Khamwas, the fourth son of King Ramses I1 and high priest of Ptah in Memphis. This legendary figure belongs to the Stories ofthe High Priests ofMemphis, published by Francis Llewelyn Griffith,'\" stories that in many ways can serve as illustrative companions to the Grcek magical papyri. Miriam Lichthcim has given this summary portrait in the third volume of her Ancieut E~yptian Literature: Prince Khamwas, son of King Ramses I1 and high priest of Ptah at Memphis, was a very learned scribe and magician who spent his time in the study of ancient monuments and books. One day he was told of the existence of a book of magic written by the god Thoth himself and kept in the tomb of a prince named Naneferkaptah (Na-nefer-ka-ptah), who lived in the distant past and was buried somewhere in the vast nec- ropolis of Memphis. After a long search, Prince Khamwas, accom-"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Intrt~duction to the Grcek h.iagic.ll Papyri xliii panied by his foster brother I~iaros, found the tomb of Nancferkaptah and entered it. He saw the magic book, which radiated a strong light, and tried to scizc it. But the spirits of Naneferkaptah and of his wife Ahwcrc rose up to defend their cherished possession. . . .'\" The collection of the Anastasi papyri, if it was brought together by one pcr- son, may have been buried with him, either in his tomb or in the rithblc of col- lapsed buildings. At any rate, whcn d'hastasi came to Thebes and the papyri were offered to him, he sensed their value and acquired them, thus saving them from destruction. It took almost another centur): however, before scholars learned to appreciate the value of the papyri and started investigating them. It is noteworthy that the auction catalog of d'hastasi's collection calls the material simply \"fromagc mys- tique.\"\" Until the middle of the nineteenth centur): the papyri were stored in the museums simply as curiosities. Scholarly investigations began when the great Dutch scholar Caspar Jacob Chris- tiaan Reuvcns (1793-1835) dcscribcd some of the content of the Lciden papyrus J 395 (PGM XIII) in his Lemes a M. Letronne published in 1830.'This work was reviewed almost immediately by the German historian of religion Karl Otfricd Miiller (1797-1840), who also translated Reuvens's excerpts into German.'' But Reuvens died before his edition of the Leiden papyri could appear. It was forty years before another Dutch scholar, the Egyptologist Conrad Lccmans (1809-93), published the edition (PGM XII, XIII)'o together with a Latin translation (1885).\"' The first publication, however, is due to the efforts of the British scholar Charles Wycliffe Goodwin (1817-78), who published one of the papyri (PGM V) to- gether with an English translation and commentarj for the Cambridge Antiquarian Society in 1853.22 Then the German philologist Gustav Parthey (1798-1872) edited the two papyri from Berlin in 1865 (PGM I, II).23 A very important new phase began when the Viennese papyrologist Carl Wessely (1860-1931) published in 1888 a transcription of the great magical papyrus of Paris (PGM IV), the Lon- don papyrus (PGM V), and the Mimaut papyrus (PGM III),I4 followed in 1889 by correction^.'^ In 1893 both Wessely\" and Frederick George Kenyon (1863- 1952)>' independently edited and published the magical papyri of London (PGM VII-X). The last major papyrus was published in 1925 by the Norwegian scholar Samson Eiuem (1872-1966),\"\" who had acquired in Egypt a valuable magical scroll with many drawings (PGM XXXVI). With these important publications, the major pieces of the Greek magical papyri known to this period had become available. It seems to have been a suggestion first made by the great scholar of Greek religion, Albrecht Dieterich (1866-1908), that all the available papyri should be published in a handy study edition. But this idea developed only gradually after Dieterich began teaching a seminar on the subject of the magical papyri at the Uni\\,crsity of Heidelberg in 1905.'' Today it is astonishing to learn that teaching such a seminar at that time was quite a daring enterprise. Magic was so utterly despised by historians and philologists that the announcement of the seminar did not mention the word \"magic\" but was simply phrased as \"Selected Pieces from the Greek Papyri.\"3o How far the dislike of the magical papyri could go is illustrated by a remark made by Ulrich von Wilamow~itz-Moellendorff: \"I once heard a well-known scholar com- plain that these papyri were found because they deprived antiquity of the noble splendor of cla~sicism.\"~' Dieterich? however, was at the edge of a wave of interest generated by the new"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"xiiv Introduction to thc Grcck Magical Papyri discipline of history of religions. His seminar therefore had a surprising attraction for students, some of whom wrote their dissertations on related subjects and be- came contriburors to the study edition. The plan for such a study edition was scri- ously threatened by Dieterich's sudden death on 6 May 1908, b~~t the ~vork was taken over by Dieterich's students, foremost of whom was Richard Wiinsch, chief editor. Adam Abt, Ludwig Fahz, Adolf Erman, Georg Moller, and other conrribu- tors33 stepped in to carry on the work. When the body of the material of PGM I-IV was almost read\\: World War I brokc out and interrupted the work. Wiinsch, Abt, and Mollcr wcrc killed in the war. Despite these terrible losses and the desperate economic situation follo~ving the war, the publisher, B. G. Teubner of Leipzig, did not give up the project, but decided to start over. The edition was entrusted to Karl Preisendanz (1883-1968), another of Dieterich's former students.\" Scholars at that time faced difficulties scarcely conceivable to us today, yet they persisted. In addition, a remarkable degree of international cooperation existed among the scholar^.^' Sam Eitrem from Oslo and Adolf Jacoby from Luxemburg joined the team, and British, French, and Dutch scholars gave their support to the effort. The Notgemeinschaft der Deutschcn Wissenschaft as well as other governmental agencies gave financial support, so that despite all the problems the first volume of the first edition of the Papyri Graecae Ma~icae could appear in 1928, with a second volume following in l93Ls6 While all this was happening, new magical papyri were being discovered and published. A third volume, which was also supposed to contain extensive indexes, therefore became necessary. But this volume never appeared, for World War I1 broke out. Despite the war, the work had progressed to the actual production of galley proofs, with the preface dated \"Pentecost, 1941,\"37 when on 4 December 1943 the publishing house of Teuhner in Leipzig was bombed and everything was de- ~troyed.~~ Fortunately, however, the galley proofs survived the war and are at pres- ent being used by a number of scholars in the form of Xerox copies. When Karl Preisendanz, the editor of the first edition and tireless promoter of the study of the Greek magical papyri before and after World War 11, died on 26 April 1968, the publishing house of Teubner, which had in part been relocated in Stuttgart, West Germany, decided to bring out a new edition. This new cdition was prepared by Albert Henrichs, a papyrologist from Cologne, who has been on the faculty of Harvard University since 1973.3' It appeared in two volumes in 1973-74.* The first volume is mostly a reprint of the first edition, though many corrections have been made. The second volume, however, is considerably different from the first edition. A number of papyri were reedited completely, and the papyri originally planned to appear in vol. 111 were added so that vol. I1 of the 1974 edition contains all pieces up to PGM LXXXI. The idea of a third volume containing the indexes was postponed because all indexes would have to be redone in view of the changes and additions in the material. I1 What is the signiiicancc of the Greek magical papyri? Scholars since Albrecht Dic- terich have consistently pointed out the importance of the Greek magical papyri to the study of ancient religions; thus we can limit ourselves here to a summary of the issues.+' Historians of religion are intrigued by the Greek magical papyri for a number of reasons. If, as Dieterich rightly says,\" the papyri are a depository of a great reli-"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Introduction to thc Grcck Magical Papyri XI\\. gious literature over many centuries, the recovery of the sourccs becomes a task of primary interest. In fact, thro~~ghout these sources we find citations of hymns, rim- als, formulae from limrgies othem~isc lost, and little bits of mythology called histo- riolae. These older materials arc now embedded in a secondary contest, but by carc- ful application of the methods of literary criticism they arc often recoverable.\" Taken as a whole, the material presents a plethora of interesting problcms for modern scholarship. One must realize first that the matcrial assembled under tl~c name Greek magical papyri represents a collection of texts of divcrsc origin and nature. This collection includes individual spells and remedies, as well as collections made by ancient magicians, from the early Hellenistic period to latc antiquity. Since the material comes from Grcco-Roman Egypt, it reflects an amazingly broad religious and cultural pluralism. Not surprising is the strong influence of Egyptian religion throughout the Greek magical papyri, although here the texts ncverthelcss show a great variety. Expressed in Grcck, Demotic, or Coptic, some texts represent simply Egyptian religion. In others, the Egyptian element has been transformed by Hcllcnistic rcligious concepts. Most of the texts arc mixtures of several religions- Egyptian, Greek, Jewish, to name the most important. The picture presented by the Greek magical papyri has been changed substan- tially by the inclusion of the translation of the Demotic magical papyri. In Prcisen- dam's edition, the Demotic material was dclctcd, even when it occurred in thc same papyrus as Greek sections apparently written by the same scribe. The inclusion of the Demotic material in the present translation raises new and intriguing questions regarding thc relationship between the Greek texts and the antecedent Egyptian sources. Further studies must clarify the process of transmission and transforma- tion ofthese texts. Such studies will gain new insights into the complex phenomena of the hellenization of religious traditions. (See also thc Introduction to the De- motic texts below.) Another interesting problem is posed by the fact that this material from Greco- Roman Egypt contains many sections that are Greck in origin and nature.\" How did this older Greek religious literature find its way into Egypt? Wc do not, and probably never shall, know. In this older material, the Greek gods arc alive and well. But Zeus, Hermes, Apollo, Artemis, Aphrodite, and others arc portrayed not as Hellenic and aristocratic, as in literamre, but as capricious, demonic, and even dan- gcrous, as in Grcek The gods and their activities resemble those in the popular myths and local cults, as rcported by mythographcrs or by Pausanias. Therefore, strange as it may sound, if we wish to study Greek folk religion, the magical papyri found in Egypt are to be regarded as one of the primary sourccs.~ Questions similar to those appropriate to the study of Greek religion must be raised in view of the material (divine names as well as entire passages) that comes from somc form of Judaism. Jewish magic was famous in antiquity:' and more sources have come to light in rcccnt years; but the origin and nature of the scctions representing Jewish magic in the Grcek magical papyri is far from clcar. Did this matcrial actually originate with Jewish magicians? How did it get into the hands of thc magicians who wrote the Grcek magical papyri? What kind of transformation took place in the matcrial itself? If the texts in question come from Judaism, what type of Judaism do they represent? The historian of religion will be especially interestcd in the kind of syncrctism represented in the Greek magical papyri.\" This syncretism is more than a mixture of diverse elements from Egyptian, Grcek, Babylonian, and rewish religion, with a fe\\v sprinkles ~fchristianity.~' Despite the diversity of texts, there is in the whole cor-"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"xlvi Ii~trociuction to the Grcck Magical l'apyri pus a tendency toward assimilation and uniformity. Such assimilation and unifor- mi% however, includes primarily thc rcligious traditions already mcntioned: the Romans, although in control of Egypt by the time most of the papyri were written, left only a few traces in the material. Thus the papyri represent a Grcco-Egyptian, rather than the more gencral Greco-Roman, syncretism. In this syncrctism, the indigenous ancient Egyptian rcligion has in part survived, in part been profoundly hellenized.\" In its Hellenistic transformation, the Egyp- tian religion of the prc-Hellenistic era appears to have been reduced and simplified, no doubt to facilitate its assimilatio~i into Hellenistic rcligion as the predominant cultural reference. It is quite clear that thc magicians who wrote and uscd the Greek papyri were Hellenistic in outlook. Hellenization, however, also includes the egyptianizing of Grcck rcligious tradi- tions. The Greek magical papyri contain many instances of such egyptianizing transformations, which take very different forms in different texts or layers of tradi- tion. Again, working out thc morc exact nature of this religious and cultural intcr- action remains the task of future research. The papyri also provide many insights into the phenomenon of the magician as a religious functionary, in both the Egyptian and the Hellenistic setting. One must be cautious, however, in making generalizing statement. in regard to thc figure of the magician in thc Greek magical papyri.\" Some of the magicians writing and using the spells may have been associated with temples of Egyptian and Greek dei- ties. According to Egyptian practice, the magician was a resident member of the temple priesthood. Genuine understanding of the older Egyptian and Grcck lan- guagcs and traditions can be assumed in some of the material, but by no means in all instances. There are texts rcflecting perhaps a different type of magician, a typc we know from the Greek religious milicu.\" This type of wandering craftsman seems keen to adopt and adapt every religious tradition that appeared useful to him, while the knowlcdge and understanding of what he adopted was characterized by a certain superliciality. This type of magician no longer understood the old languages, al- though he used remnants of them in transcription. He recited and used what must at one time have been metrically composed hymns; but he no longer recognized the meter, and he spoiled it when he inserted his own material. In the hands of magi- cians of this typc, the gods from the various cults gradually merged, and as their natures became blurred, they often changed into completely different deities. For these magicians, there was no longer any cultural difference between the Egyptian and the Greek gods, or between them and the Jewish god and the Jewish angels; and even Jesus was occasio~lallv assimilated into this truly \"ecumenical\" rcligious syncretism of the Hellenistic world culture. We should make it clear, however, that this syncretism is more than a hodge- podge of heterogcncous itcms. In effect, it is a new religion altogether, displaying unified religious attitudes and beliefs. As an example, one may mention the enor- mously important role of the gods and goddesses of the underworld. The role of these undenvorld deities was not new to Egyptian religion or, to some extent, to ancient Greek religion; but it is characteristic of the Hellenistic syncretism of the Greek magical papyri that the netherworld and its deities had become one of its most important concerns. The goddess Hckatc, identical with Persephone, Selenc, Artcmis, and the old Babvlonian goddess Ereschigal, is one of the deities most often invoked in the papyri.

Dcspitc all tliese changes, there has always been an unbroken tradition of magic. Why is magic so irrepressible and ineradicable, if it is also true that its claims and promises nc\\.cr come truc? Or do they? Do people ncvcr check up on thc efficiency of magicians? The answer appears to be that, in general, people are not intcrcsted in whether or not magicians' promises come truc. People want to belie\\~c, so they simply ignore their suspicions that magic may all be cicceptioil and fraud. The enormous role de- ception plays in human lifc and society is \\vcll known to us.j6 In many crucial arcas and in many critical situatio~is of lifc, cicception is the only method that really works. As the Koman aphorism s~vns it up, \"Mundus vult decipi, ergo dccipiatur\" (\"The world wishes to be deceived, and so it may be deceived\"). To an immeasur- abk exzcnt, people's lives carv on by \\\\,hat they decide they want to bclic\\re rather than by what they should believe or even know, by what appears to be real rathcr than by \\+,hat is really real, by props and by fads, and by gobbledygook of this kind today and that kind tomorrow. Magicians are thosc who have long ago explored these dimensions of the human mind. Kather than decrying the facts, they havc exploited them. Magicians havc known all along that people's religious need and expectations provide the greatest opportunity for the most effective of all deceptions. But instead of turning against religion, as the skeptics among the Greek and Roman philosophers did, the magi- cians made use of it. Aftcr all, magic is nothing but the art ofmaking people believe that something is being done about those things in life about which we all know that we ourselves can do nothing. Magic is the art that makes people who practice it feel better rather than worse, that provides the illusion of security to the insecure, the feeling of help to thc help- less, and the comfort of hope to the hopeless. Of course, it is all deception. But who can endure naked reality, especially when there is a way to avoid it? This is why magic has worked and continues to work, no matter what the evidence may be. Those whose lives depend on deception and de- lusion and those who provide them have formed a truly indissoluble symbiosis. Magic makes an unmalagcable life manageable for those who believe in it, and a profession profitable for thosc who practicc the art. Notes 1.

It should be notd that the story dcaling with the search for the sccret book has a parallel in Pseudo-Democrims, who may bc identical with Bolos of Men- des. According to this text, Democritus went to Mcmphis where he was received by Ostanes and his students in the templc of Ptah, but Osranes died before he initiated Democritu into his mystcries and handed his sccret books over to him. Dcmocrims also brought up the shadow of Ostanes from Hades and askcd him about the books. Ostancs replied that they were in the temple, where thcy were finally discovcrcd. Both names occur also in PGM (De- mocritus: VII.167, 795; XII. 351; Ostancs: N.2006; XII.122). The text is given in J. Bidez and F.

As I have tried to show, even the human selfwas regarded as a daimon which could bc handled by the magician in the same way as all the other energies of the universe. See H. D. Bea, \"The Delphic Maxim 'Know Yourself' in the Greck Magical Papyri,\" HR 21 (1981) : 156-71. 55. A beautiful testimony of this self-understanding is cited by D. Wildung, Egyptian Saints: Deijiution In Pharaoni~E~ypt (New York: New York University Press, 1977) 84-85, where the great magician Amcnhotep says about hiisclf: I am really magnificent among any people, one with a heaving hcart when he is looking for a plan in some unknown problem, like onc whosc hem knows it already; who finds a sentence cvcn if it was found destroyed; master ofwisdom, fricnd of the ruler, who does uscful things for the Horns, who makes his monn- rnents splendid in ordcr to causc everybody to remember him forcver at the au- gust place. Who guides the ignorant through rhe events since the primeval times, who shows thcir place to everybody who forgot about it; useful in his ideas, when he is looking for monuments to make immortal the name of his lord; who relates the proverb and acts with his fingers; leadcr of mankind, of engaging manners as a pleasant one. Who venerates the namc of the king and his power, who praises his Majesty at any time of the day, who is on his guard in all his decisions. . . .\" 56. A good illustration of the phcnomcnon is the social and psychological syndrome called \"cognitive dissonance.\" The syndrome can bc observed among persons of strong con- viction who, when faced with evidcnce to the contrary of their convictions (\"disconiirma- don\"), becornc more intanse and close themselves off from their social context, rather than dcvclop doubts about these convictions.

Johnson As important as the Grcck magical papyri are to thc understanding of Grcco- Roman religion, as noted by Betz in his Introduction to the Greek magical tcxts, d~cir full significance can k pcrccivcd only when it is realized that thcsc texts writ- ten in Greck are part of a larger corpus that also includcs texts written in that stagc of thc Egyptian language known as \"Demotic,\" and rhat thc corpus as a whole de- rives in vcry largc measure from earlier Egyptian religious and magical bclicfs and practices. The interrelationship bcrween the Greck and Egyptian aspects of thcsc magical texts is emphasized by the fact that not only did the major find of such texts, the collection of Anastasi noted by Betz, occur in Egypt, in the ancicnt capital ofThebes (modern Luxor) and include both Greek and Egyptian documents, but it also included documents that wcre bilingual-some of the spells wcre written in Greck, othcrs in Egyptian, all within the same texts and all for use by the same magician. Perhaps even morc telling is the fact that even in thc spells writtcn in Greek, the religious or mythological background and the methodology to be fol- lowed to ensure success may be purely Egyptian in origin. Thus it is only with the inclusion of the Egyptian matcrials together with the Greek, and the study of the complete corpus, that the full ramifications of this extraordinary body of material can be studicd and appreciated. All four of the Demotic magical tcxts appear to have come from the collections that Anastasi gathered in the Theban area. Most have passages in Greek as well as in Demotic, and most have words glossed into Old Coptic (Egyptian language writ- ten with the Greek alphabet [which indicated vowels, which Egyptian scripts did not] supplemented by extra signs taken from the Demotic for sounds not found in Greek); some contail passages written in the earlier Egyptian hieratic script or words writtcn in a special \"cipher\" script, which would have been an effective secrct code to a Greek reader but would have been deciphered fairly simply by an Egyptian. The longest of the four Dcmotic texts was at some time torn lnto two scctions (PDM xiv; PGM XIV). Thc longer second section was acquired by the Leiden Mu- seumofAntiquitics in 1828; it now beam numberP.Lugd.Bat.J 383 (formerly Anas- tasi 65). The shorter beginning section was purchased by the British Museum in 1857; it now bears number P.Lond.dcmot. 10070 (formerly Anastasi 1072). Thc definitive publication of the two sections, including hand copy, transliteration, and translation, with extensive commentary and glossary, is the work of F. LI. Griffith and Herbert Thompson.' Attention was attracted to thc Leidcn section very early when Reuvens recognized the value that thc glosscs into Greck lettcrs provided for the deciphcring of Demotic ~cript.~ The entire preserved text (both the beginning and the end of the original manuscript are lost) consists of nventy-nine largc col- umns on the recto and thirtj-thrcc smaller columns on the vcrso. All are in Egyp- tian with thc exception of three short passages in thrcc separate columns, which are written in Greek. Elsewhere occasional Greek words occur as glosses to Egyptian"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Ivi Introduction to thc Demotic Magical Papyri words or arc written in the Ewtian text in an alphabetic Demotic script appar- cntly dc\\,eloped for writing magical and foreign words. Much morc common than thc Greek passages is the use of the older Egyptian hicratic script in the midst of Demotic passagcs (as ifthe scribc were transcribing from an earlier manuscript and occasionally forgot to update what he was copying) and glosscs into Old Coptic, most frequently for the writing of magical names and presumably to indicate proper pronunciation (which would have been \\.cry difficult to do given the abbreviated nature and grcat age of the traditional Egyptian scripts). Each column of the rccto is written within a frame of horizontal and vertical lines; chaptcr or section head- ings are written in rcd ink (a tradition in Egyptian literature from Old IZingdom times\"). In some cases, the scribes, while writing thc body of thc text in black ink, left room for the heading to be addcd later in red ink but failed to do so. Such headings can easily be restored. The same scribe who wrote thc London and Leiden text also wrote a sccond manuscript in the Leiden Museum (PDM xii; PGM XII) that contains Demotic magical texts-the verso 0fP.Lugd.Bat.J 384 (formerly Anaaasi 75): Of the nine- teen columns of magical spells on the verso, the two columns at the beginning (the left end of the manuscript) arc purely Demotic, the following thirteen columns are in Greek (although two hcadings are written in Demotic), the next two columns are again in Demotic, and the last two columns at the right end of the papyrus are largely in Demotic although they have short passages in Greek cited in the middle. (Note that thc papym is broken at both ends, so it is impossible to determine how many more columns there were originally and in what language.) Within the De- motic sections of the manuscript are occasional passages written in the earlier hier- atic script and in alphabetic Demotic as well as Old Coptic glosses. It appears that this text was written before the London and Leiden text since it is in this text that one can see the development of the Old Coptic script being used for glosses. In the columns at the left end of the papyrus, thc Old Coptic glosses were written Letter by letter above the corresponding Demotic letter. Since the Demotic runs right to left, the glosses run the same direction. This would have been quite confusing to someone reading what appeared to be Grcck, so by the glosses in the second group of Demotic spells, at thc right end of the papyrus. the scribe had takcn to writing the glosses word for word, lcft to right, over the appropriate Dcmotic word. It is this latter system that is found throughout the papyrus of London and Leiden. In Leiden J 384, the scribe did not write within a frame or use red ink for headings. That both the papyri of London and Leiden and Leiden J 384 were written in Thebes, wherc they were found and sold to Anastasi, is indicated further by the fact that the dialect of Coptic to which the glosses and other alphabetic spellings most closely correspond has becn identified as ''archaic Thcban.\"' The British Museum also contains a second bilingual Greek and Demotic magi- cal text (PDM lxi; PGM LXI), P.Brit.Mus. inv. 10588.6 The recto contains eight columns of Demotic; two have occasional magical names written in Old Coptic and one has the names of some ingredients written in Greek in addition to two Greek sections within the Demotic. The verso contains turo colum~s of Demotic with occasional Old Coptic and four columns of Grcck. The Dcmotic sections use red ink for chapter headings (italicized in thc translations), as in the papyrus of London and Leiden. The fourth Demotic magical text is P.Louvre E3229 (formerly Anastasi 1061).' The preserved fragments (PDM Suppletnevit) contain scven columns of Dcmotic on thc recto and one column on the verso; the papyrus is broken at both ends. Both"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Introduction to the Demotic Magical Papyri lvii the earlier hieratic script and Old Coptic arc used, together with the alphabctic De- motic script developed for writing magical names and attested in each of these texts except P.Brit.Mus. inv. 10588. Section headings are written in red ink on the recto (italicized in the translations); thc columns on the recto are written within a red frame, as in the papyrus of London and Leiden. In all four of these texts, all of which can be dated paleographically to the third century A.D. or only slightly later, there is every indication that all the various scripts were written by, and for, the samc scribe, a bilingual person equally at home in Egyptian (old, current, and futurc) and Greek. The contents and the methodol- ogy are overwhelmingly Egyptian. Most of the material is completely Egyptian and its origins are easily traceable in earlier Egyptian religious and magical literature. The methods used arc likewise standard Egyptian practices. Some of this is indi- cated in the notes to the translations. By contrast, Egyptian divinities (in thcir own names or in the guise of their Greck counterparts) and Egyptian mythological references abound in the Grcck texts and Egyptian methodology is also frequent. For example, although threats against gods who might fail to do what one wants go back to the earliest Egyptian religio-magic literamre (Old Kingdom Pyramid Texts), but are unparalleled in clas- sical Greece, they arc frequent in the Grcek magical texts as well as those written in Egyptian. Much of the Egyptian background of the Greek texts has becn pointed out in the numerous texmal notcs added by Robert K. Ritner. The common source of thc Greek and Egyptian language texts is also indicated by thcir frequent use of identical strings of invocation names, including, in addition to Egyptian and Greck divinities, western Asiatic divinities, \"abracadabra\" names, and what appear to the modern reader as gibberish. Because the bulk of thc texts is written in Greek, and because there are short passages of Greek in some of the Egyptian texts,\" it has been suggested that the Egyptian texts are translations from the Greck. But therc are passages in Egyptian, written in Old Coptic, within many of the Greek texts and, as indicated above, thc religious and magical background of many of the spells, both Greek and Egyptian, is decidedly Egyptian. In discussing the Egyptian texts, Griffith and Thompson concluded: \"cven where therc are reasons for believing that the demotic is a transla- tion from the Greek, the original source, in relation to magic at any rate, was prob- ably E~ptian.\"~ The samc may be true for much of the Greck material. Onc must, at any rate, be lecry of overstating the Greek case and attributing too much to Grcck influence. The prcscnt collection of all the texts, Greek and Egyptian, in one easily usablc volume, points this out conclusively. This will, in turn, allow and encourage the comparative study of the purposcs, methods, props, magical names, and the like, of thc Grcck and Egyptian spells and encourage the study of thc antecedents of thc material in both cultures. This work will add grcatly to our understanding of the cultural milicu in which these magical texts were produccd and copied. Thus it is the hopc of all those who havc collaboratcd on the production of this volume that it will both further our knowledge of a dynamic pcriod in the history of man and also encourage futurc study of cultural contact and cross-fertilization.

As is truc with oracles in general, most of the rcsponscs provide ambiguous answers which leave tl~c exact interpretation up to the readcr. In this translation of Homer, which usually follows thc Osford Classical Test rather than that of Prciscndanz, a iowercasc lcttcr at the beginning of a translated xrsc indicates that the first word of the verse docs not hegin a sentence. Such verses often constitute or invohc incomplcre syntactical units.

Consult thr referencw in Maltomini, 78, n. 27. 13. Reading drvsporjzq for dvSpoyevrl (ct thc variant spelling of the Greek in PGM CXXIIIf., fr. A., 5). In PGMIV. 2610, Hckate is couplrd with Hermes as an androgynous bcing. 14. The mcaning of this unattested word 6vSpos is at bcst very spedativc; however, there is no quesdon that the word originally formcd a meaningful Greek epithet having to do with &$p, \"m.\" For similar, anomalous formations, consult the ocmrrcnces in PGM as citcd by Maltomini, 78, n. 29. In addition to his philological parallels, comparc thc tenn dv$vop, \"unmanly.\" 15. Thc word aipoyz~i)~ is now attestcd on a second-cenmty inscription from Egypt, SEG 8. 374. Although LST, Supplcmcnt, s.v., p. 5, translates thw \"rclatcd by blood.\" Maltomini is correct in suggm- ing here \"born oflwith blood.\" 16. Reading ~po~opap$ for rpo~opaun)? [R.D.K.] Maltomini suggests perhaps KpoKopaw (un- attested). Saffron is associated with Hckate in Orphic Hymn 1. 2; 71. 1, and clsewhrrc wirh Drmetcr and Pcnephone. 17. Thc word is attested in Tzeaes, AUg. 11. XX. 226, p. 132, Maranga. A similar epithet is used of Hekatc in Lydus, De mem. 3.10. 18.

The instructions call for the manufacturing of a waxcn doll; for this phanomenon in magic, con- sult the literamre cited by Maltomini; cf. PGM IV. 296%. PGM CXXV a-f Papyri nos. 8-15 in Maltomini's edition in Studi Clmsici e Orientali 29 (1979) : 113-20 (see'PGM CXXIII a-f for full reference) contain texts too fragmentary to translate. a. Papyrus no. 8 (Tav. XI) 113-16, dates to the fifth or sixth century and is madc up of three fragments: Fragment A contains several legible voces maoicae, viz., 1. Reading ~a~a~hrrr~dv for ~ara~hl)r~~dv. Cf. PGM VII. 430 for the same cxprcssion and I'GM IV. 2076, 2442,2450,2497,2624; LXIV. 1 for the use of thc verb in this scnsc. 2. That is, prrsumably wax takcn without smoking thc bccs. Cf. PGM IV 2378,2945 for a similar practice in crfcrcnrc to honry. 3. The tcn is hopclrssly corrupt at this point and thus defies explanation. The tcxr sccrns to contain a refrrencc ro rhe bones of a victim, thus wc rcad vp&~c (thus Maltomini) in thc .wries ofletters immc- diatcly following \"honcs.\" 4. The rcfcrcnce to \"left on=\" and \"right onc\" is not clear. Maltomini assumes the rcfcrcnccs arc to ?he left pan\" and \"the riglapar2' of thc mannikin, respectivrly. That is, the magician is to prick the kti part of thc mannikin up to the left cyc, and the same on thc righr. Howewr, it is more likrly on the basis of spells like PGM IV. 296-335 that \"the lcfr (onc)\" and \"the right (onc)\" refer to lcft and right \"needles\" prickcd into thc matching eye. Tl~c \"lcft onc\" means a nrcdlc hcld in the lcft hand, the \"right one\" a nccdle hcld in thc right. Cf PGM IV. 2943-50 for a similar rite in which thc cyc of a magic doll is pricked. 5.

Bibliograpllical data have been added for further study. More common terminology and names have not been explained since they can be found in easily available dictionaries. BE~N formula: Thr abbreviated formula stands for the long palindrome ABERA- MEMHoOUTHLERTHEXANAXETHRELTHUOOTHENEM a magical namC occurring sev- eral times in the PGM (scc I. 29% 11. 125-26; 111.67-68, 116-17; IV. 181; V 180; XIV. 25; CXXVIa. 13- 15, ctc.).

Usually invoked for beneficent results, this magical name has not been adequately explained although it has boon suggcstcd that the name contains Hebrew. BRASAX: This popular deity in magic (also spcllcd ARW) is identified with a variety of other names of gods and was explained bygema~ (assig~~ing the numerical value to d~c letters of the name) as the magic number 365 (see PGM IV. 331-32; VIII. 49, 611; XIII. 156,466, etc.). Accordingly the dcity is recognized as a solar god and is pictured on amulets as a snake-footed creature (the so-called angzripede), armored, and with the head of a cock.

ADONAX: An important angelic figure in gnosticism and in magic. The name originally came from the Old Testament designation \"my Lord,\" although this meaning had been long lost to the practitioners ofthe Roman Empire. See J. Michl, \"Engelnamen,\" RAC 5 (1965) : 202. For thc variant angel forms Adonael, Adonail, Adoniel, Adonaiel, see E. Peterson, \"Engel- und Dhoncnnamen. Nomina Barbara,\" RhM 75 (1926) : 394. - - 305). The Jewish origin, however, is still recognized (see PGMXII. 264). See J. Michl, RAC 5 (1965) : 203. Agathos Daimon: \"The good genius\" was originally an epithet of a god invoked at Greek banquets. In the PGM the name has hecome a dosignation for a gcrnd-one, however, who can he identified with a number of different dcitics. See Hopfiicr, OZ 11, sec. 264,294-95; R.

In Gnosticism he is one of the light-aeons and is described as having a donkefs face. See J. Michl, RAC 5 (1965) 212, no. 73: Eloaios.

Headless One (GreekAkephaIos): The Headless God is one of the most peculiar deities of the PGM. His origin seems to he in the older Egyptian religion, but he became very popular in Hellenistic Egypt, where he could be identified wirh Osiris (as in PGM 11. 98-117) and Besas (as in PGM VII. 222-49; VIII. 64-110). Headless dcitics are also known outside Egypt. Plutarch tells about the headless Molos in Crete (D$ om. 417E), Pausanias of the headless Triton in the temple of Dionysos at Tanagra (9. 20. 5); see A. Delatte, \"Erudes sur la magic grecquc V,\" BCH 38 (1914) : 189-249; K. Preisendanz, \"Akephalos,\" RAC 1 (1950) :211-16; K. Abel, \"Akephalos,\" PRE.S 12 (1970) : 9-14, with bibliography.

Helios: The Greek word for thc sun (Helios) can stand for the celestial body or for the dciry representative of that body. In the PGM, Helios is usually transcribed from Greek instead of translated as \"sun,\" unless that term seems completely devoid of the sense of a deity. Helios-Osiris: Although this link is possible through the fusion with Sarapis, for the older linkofosiris and Re, see A. Piankoff, TheLitanyofRe (New York: Bollingen, 1964) 19-21. Hephaistos: The important connection of Hephaistos, the Greek god of the hearth and of fire, with magic is reflected a fcw times in PGM (see VII. 379; XI1. 177, 417, 439). Since Herodotus, Hephaistos was the Greek interpretation of Ptah. See M. Delcourt, Hephaicos ou la l&ende du ma&& (Paris: Les belles lettrcs, 1957). Hernopolis: Hcrmopolis is \"the city of Hermes,\" the cult center of Thoth in upper Egypt, the modern Ashmunein; cf. PGM 111. 664; 670. See Bonnet, R&G 293-95, s.v. \"Hermopolis.\" Hesies: See Esies.

Iabas (Iabo, Iabe, lapos): This is apparently the Samaritan enunciation of the tetragram- maton YHWH (Yahweh), elsewhere rendered Iabe or Iabai; cf PGMV. 102; XIc. 1; XII. 4 and S.

Isis hand: Cloth or material taken from the dresses of statucs of the gods, especially of Isis, was considered magically potent. Isis is a widow of Osiris and thus identified with the color black.

See Gundcl, Dckane undDeknnsternbilder 233-34. Lamella, pl. lamebe: From the Latin for a thin, metal plate. Thc word is used to translate a number of Greek terms for tablets of thin gold, silver, iron, or lead. The lamcllac are usually engraved and worn as amulets or talismans (phylacteries). If lead is described, the tablets usually intend malicious or harmful magic. Lamps, not painted red: In the PGM we find frequent rcfcre~~ccs to the usc of lamps with no red coloring (see I. 277,293; 11. 57; IV. 2372, 3191; VII. 542, 594; VIII. 87; XII. 27, 131; LXII. 1). Dipping the clay into red ocher (miltor) or painting it on before tho firing, as customarily done, would give the lamp a reddish color. In lamp divination, howcvcr, the red color had to he avoided because of its association with Seth-Typhon. See W. Kroll, \"Min- ium,\" PRE 15 (1932): 1848-54; R. Ganszyniec, \"Lychnomnnteia,\" PRE 13 (1927) :2115- 19. Cf. also DMP col. V, 4, pp. 44-45 (with note), where the lamp is said to be white, without the application of red lead (pri). On the significance of red, cf. G. Poscner, \"Les signes noirs dans les rubriques,\" JEA 35 (1949) : 77-81. [R.K.R.] MASKELLI-MASKELLO formula: This well-known formula, written fully as MA~KELLI MASK- u Pinrr Sophia IV, chap. 140 [~c6cmot 3651). On thc meaning see Hopfner, oz I, sec. 7471 Preisendanz, \"Maskelli Maskclld,\" PKE 14 (1930) : 2120. Within this formula, among other things, occur four words which may be old Greek epithets: Ovcobaufiva, perhaps an cpithet of Hekate or of the moon goddess (thus LSJ, but of uncertain meaning); RhEzichth8n, a word which map be translated \"bursting forth from the earth\" (thus LSJ; see Cook, Zew, 111 4-5 for parallels and discussk~n. See also Bonncr, SMA 170; Orph. H. 52. 9); Hippochth8n (meaning unexplained, thus LSJ: Audollent, Ta6. Dej 38129; cf.

Material, magical: \"Material\" (mia; see PGMI. 99, W. 2336, etc.) is the magical substance such as hair, thread from clothing, etc., which is ofrcn ncccssary to make sympathctic magic effecri\\~e. See K. Preisendanz, \"Miszcllen zu den Zauhcrpapyri, I,\" WSt 40 (1918) : 1-8; Hopher, OZ I, sea. 667-77. Meliouchos: The meaning of this cpithet is still unexplained.

Nahlre (Greek Physh): Physls appears tiom early timcs as a deified conception of nature's powers of creation and crca~ivity. As such, Physis has an important role in most philosophi- cal schools, especially whcrc the concept of kntaphjssin (\"in accordance with nature\") seems at times to rise almost to the level of a religious credo (so in Seneca, De Prov. 117. 15 and often). Physis appears oftcn clse\\vhere as a goddess: cf., for example, Hyms. Orph. 10 which is addrcsscd to Physis. Much of its language closely resembles that in the PGM hymns to the moon (to whom Hymn. Orph. 9 is addressed). In PGM Physis the goddcss appears else- where at IV. 2883, 2917; scc also IV 939 and n. The surprising thiig is that she does not appear more oftcn in PGM. See K. KerCnyi, \"Die Gottin Natur,\" Eranos$ahrbuch 14 (1947) : 39-86. NEBOUTOSOU~TH: The name occurs frequently in magical literature and is often con- nected wid1 Aktiophis and Ercschigal. In PGM the triad is often attributed to dcities of the underworld, especially Hekatc. The name Nebutosoualeth may be derived from the Bahylo- nian god Nebo, but the origin is not clear. See K. Preisendanz, \"Ncburosualeth,\" PRE 16 (1935) :2158-60; Bonner, SMA 30,197-98.

At other times, the association is to be more long-lasting, and the god is to ally himselfwith the human (PGM I. 57,79-80, 177-81) evcn to the point of some real sorrof union (PGMIV 209,219-21; cf 11. 215-17; XIII. 927-31).
