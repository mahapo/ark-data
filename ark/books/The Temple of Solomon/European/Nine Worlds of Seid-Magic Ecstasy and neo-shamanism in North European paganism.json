I do that, in part, in the introductory chapter: it is part of thestory. Here, though, I wish to say something about ‘location’: mine,as author. This is not only a book about a loosely defined spiritualcommunity and its practices, but a product of that community.As researcher/practitioner I occupy one those ‘strange positions’that Marcus (1999: 3) indicates: even more strange because theexperiential communities that I explore are at once ‘exotic’ andpersonal; strange and familiar; with roots deep in Western society,and yet – because they draw directly on those roots, different,‘irrational’ and in many people’s eyes ‘weird’. Or Wyrd. The word isthe same, and implies fate, that which follows, active construction ofobligation and meaning.Next, I am located as a practitioner within the communities Istudy. I am neither an ‘objective’ ethnographer, nor a representativemember. I belong to some organisations, not others; I run work-shops and participate in e-mail groups; I hold opinions and includeon my website(s) ‘rants’ about the politics of practice; I amimplicated in the construction of seidr.A word about what I am not. I am neither a linguist or anarchaeologist, but I draw on both disciplines in what follows. I do soboth as practitioner and ethnographer. This book is not only‘about’ seidworkers, it is for seidworkers (among others), and it ismy hope that it may be as valuable (though, doubtless, as disputed)within this community of study as it may be within religious studies,anthropology, or sociology.Finally, a note about some of the words found here: today’s seid-folk draw on the Icelandic literature, and words from that literaturefind their way into their discourse — like ‘seidr’. I have been inContents ix"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"something of a quandary about transliterating these. The Icelandiccharacters dand p(eth and thorn, pronounced as ‘th’ in ‘there’ and‘thin’, respectively) feature in a number of these words. In the end Ihave adopted the following rule: when the word is used in anIcelandic context, I retain the character. When it is used in anEnglish context, I transliterate using ‘d’ for d, ‘th’ for P. Thus Idescribe Porgeirr the Lawspeaker of the Alping, but my friend’sname is Thorgerd, and a seeress from the old literature maybe referred to as Thurid or Puridr, depending on the context.Exceptions are made where today’s practitioners often retain theletter — most notably in the word ‘seidr’ itself, and often the god-name ‘Ódinn’. Seidr, by the way, is pronounced approximately ‘say-th’, with the ‘r’ coming from the Icelandic nominative case (you cansay ‘say-thur’, if you prefer) — alternative versions being noted inchapter 3.With this short note (and with an apology to Icelandic-speakersfor any liberties I take with their language, and especially for anymis-spellings or inaccuracies that my inexpert eye and my language-challenged Mac’s spelling checker have not caught) I welcome youto a small exploration of the Nine Worlds.x Preface"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"AcknowledgementsMany people have contributed to my construction of this book, inmultiple ways.

Why was I entering the UnitedStates? asked the official, and I replied, ‘I’m an anthropologist. Oneof the people I’m studying is getting married. I’m going to dance ather wedding!’.He laughed and waved me on. I walked, musing on the meaningsof the words I’d said, for myself and for the recipient. On the planeI’d been scribbling notes for a paper I had to write, and a futureresearch proposal, and thinking about George Marcus’ discussionsof ‘multi-sited ethnography’ (Marcus 1998). Now here was I, caughtin a maze of meanings, on my way to a wedding, and it wasWalpurgisnacht: Beltane Eve, May Eve.Some years before, I had met Winifred. She was the firstseidworker – she prefers the term 'spae-woman', one who sees whatis to come – that I ever saw in action, and I’d greatly enjoyed thediscussions, in person or email, with her since, as we struggled towork out the disputed territory of seidr, sets of shamanistic practiceof pre-Christian Northern Europe. She had talked of her friendshipwith another Heathen, and then the wedding invitation had arrivedand I made the long trip from Nova Scotia to, indeed, dance at thewedding. But neither the ‘wedding’ nor the ‘dancing’ were likely tobe quite as the customs officer envisaged. The wedding – indeed anexchange of marriage vows – was part of a weekend celebration ofspring, with rituals and a maypole, and the dancing I had in mindwould be that very night, before rather than after the exchange ofvows. There would be drumming, and guests were encouraged toChapter 1"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"dance around the bonfire, to – in the words of Winifred’s invitation– ‘leap, spring and bound’, in honour of the festival: and if they sochose, to dance to honour their animal spirits, taking on the move-ments of the animal, in a sense becoming the animal, strengtheningspiritual links between the worlds, between human-kind andanimal-kind, masked or unmasked, veiled or unveiled, drawing onand adding to the energies of the night and the fire.Winifred and others like her live between worlds – both theeveryday and shamanic worlds, here the Nine Worlds on the treeYggdrasill. Even within the ‘everyday’ worlds of people, they meet arange of discursive constructions from the rationalism of (much)scientific/discourse to the rationalist tolerance of ‘liberal’ main-stream religion or agnosticism, and from the human-privileging,God-centred discourse of (much) Christian fundamentalism to theEarth-centred focus of (some) Aboriginal groups and the ‘Earth isthe Goddess’ approach of (some) goddess spirituality. Winifred, andothers like her, are emphatically part of Western, society, with itstensions and contradictions. She is therefore making her way, livingher life, within sets of relations and modes of consciousness thatlink her to all these groups and more, at work, in communityendeavours, in attempting to create alliances that further her goalsand those of the Earth that she is, personally, sworn to protect.Less than a month later, I described the incident of the customsofficer, at a conference on folklore with the topic of ‘Going Native’(Blain 2000). Ethnography is changing and the ‘insider’s’ view is nolonger debarred. I was exploring ways to express my experiences,linking the communities of shamanists and seidworkers, andacademics. Two months later I was in Britain, talking with neo-shamanic practitioners there about seidr and debating theories ofwhat was ‘shamanism’. So many understandings, so many relation-ships – and I saw myself within the web of practitioners, connectedto all by strands of Wyrd, fate, history or social construction,positioned in such a way that I could write about these experiencesfor a wider audience. The result is before you now.This book presents an ethnographic exploration of NorthernEuropean shamanistic practice called seidr, within a framework ofrecent theorising of shamanisms and neo-shamanism. Its purposesare those of advancing thinking on neo-shamanisms and theirincreasing relevance within social relations of post-modernity;broadening knowledge of seidr while examining the present-dayconstruction of this specific ‘neo-shamanism’; and dispelling2 Introducing shamanism, seidr and self"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"misconceptions about neo-shamanisms in general (e.g. that they are‘all the same’) and seidr and Northern European ‘reconstructed-indigenous’ religious practices in particular. Additionally, the bookexamines the use of experiential anthropology in understanding andtheorising phenomena of altered consciousness and the interactionsof seidworker or ‘shaman’ with their spirit worlds.This therefore is an ethnography of seidr, as it is presently beingrediscovered, even ‘reinvented’, by groups in Europe and NorthAmerica. As such, the book not only describes seidr, its construc-tion and ‘performance’ – a term disputed within practice and theory– and its sources, but engages with debates within and aboutethnography and experiential anthropology.Focusing chiefly on ‘oracular’ or divinatory seidr reconstructedfrom instances in the Icelandic sagas, I locate seidr as ecstaticpractice within specific cultural contexts: Northern Europe of 1,000years ago, though with roots deep in the past, and the WesternEarth-religions revival of the present day. I examine the extent towhich seidr can be said to be either ‘shamanistic’, or ‘shamanic’,understanding the latter term to imply community sanction andstructuring of ecstatic/magical practice (Blain and Wallis 2000). Mywork here is aligned, therefore, with new research within anthro-pology and religious studies that understands shamanisms, whether‘traditional’, ‘neo-’ or ‘urban’, as historically and culturally specific,at once transforming and themselves in process of transformation,within contexts which are economic, socio-political and spiritual.In chapter 2 I introduce seidr, within a framework of NorthEuropean ‘Heathenry’, and some of the debates surrounding it.Chapter 3 is an exploration of the (re-)construction of oracular,‘high-seat’ or divinatory seidr, the rituals most likely to be metwith by observers. Chapter 4 explores issues of trance states,‘shamanisms’ and ‘the spirits’. Chapter 5 is an experiential narrativeof my introduction to, and exploration of, these relationships. Inchapters 6 and 7, questions of ambiguity, ambivalence, gender,sexuality and the ‘otherness’ of seidworkers – then and now – areexplored, and the final chapter examines some challenges andquestions of magic, neo-shamanisms, rationality, and the locationof myself as ethnographer.Within Western ‘post-modern’ society an increasing number ofpeople are turning to construct their own spiritual relationshipswith the earth, other people, and those with whom we sharethe earth: plants, animals, and various spirit-beings found in theIntroducing shamanism, seidr and self 3"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"mythologies of the world. For many, this goes hand-in-hand with asearch for ‘roots’, authenticity, a quest for meaning that seekers donot find in the hustle and pressures of their fragmented everydaylives. If as Bauman (1997) has suggested ‘post-modern society’ isabout ‘choice’, one of the most obvious examples lies in this questfor located spiritual meaning.There are several ways in which this quest has become manifest:religions, traditions or ‘paths’ often confused by researchers, butdistinct in the discourse of their followers. The ‘new age’ (not dealtwith in this book) focuses, in the main, on self-development,while borrowing from a number of spiritual traditions includingChristianity, Hinduism, Buddhism and various indigenous practicesfrom around the world. Numerous ‘neo-paganisms’ look to aremembered, or invented, past, often romanticised, although anincreasing number of today’s Western Pagans emphasise theirdeliberate construction of religion for today. A third strand is ‘neo-shamanism’, also romanticised, which draws heavily on construc-tions of ‘indigenous’ or ‘traditional’ (world-wide) shamanic practicein the Western literature from the eighteenth century onwards. Seidrcan be envisaged as a point of intersection of these second andthird strands.These ways of relating spiritually to the world have been toooften dismissed by anthropology, sociology or religious studies asirrelevant, either small-scale manifestations of dissatisfaction, oreven adolescent rebellion, teenagers’ attempts to distance themselvesfrom ‘establishment’ of church, state and parents. However, viewedfrom an approach that sees wealth in diversity, and contestation ascreation of meaning, they become part of the patchwork of post-modernity, processes of dynamic construction of present-dayWestern society. Followers of these new/old religious traditions maybe computer programmers, cleaners or clerks, graduates ofseminary education, bartenders or barristers, accountants,archaeologists, teachers, students or systems managers, or evenanthropologists – engaging with social life in many ways, andattempting to blend their spiritual practices with everyday life.My interest in writing this book lies in the intersection ofreconstructed European pre-Christian religion with ‘shamanisms’described from elsewhere, indeed in the overlap or interweaving ofthe second and thirds strand of spiritual thought described above:‘reconstructed’ Paganism, and neo-shamanism. Many descriptionsof neo-shamanisms are available, the most familiar of which is4 Introducing shamanism, seidr and self"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"probably Michael Harner’s (1980) The Way of the Shaman, whichhas become a basic ‘text’ for many practitioners. (For otheraccounts see e.g. Wallis, forthcoming, a.) Constructions of ‘CelticShamanism’ and ‘Norse Shamanism’, as magical practice for today,are increasingly appearing within pagan communities in Europe andNorth America. A number of popular books and magazine articlesdealing with ‘Celtic Shamanism’ (e.g. J. Matthews 1991; C.Matthews 1995; Cowan 1995) have whetted appetites for more, andwhile ‘Norse Shamanism’ or ‘Saxon Shamanism’ – either of whichmight conceivably be called seidr – have received less attention,these too are now attracting notice, particularly through the worldwide web and through Jan Fries’ book Seidways(Fries 1996).Groundwork was laid by Brian Bates’ novel The Way of Wyrd(Bates 1983), which deals with some of the Old English healing‘charms’ within the context of a shaman training an assistant, andhis later non-fiction account The Wisdom of the Wyrd(1996) whichgives as background for shamanistic practice (and for the derivationof his novel) both Old Norse and Old English material.This leads therefore to the ‘North European Paganism’ of thesubtitle (a term which its practitioners are rather unlikely to use, butwhich may make some sense to academics). Under various names,this can be regarded today as a set of linked religious and spiritual‘traditions’ that are being derived by their practitioners fromvarious source texts and archaeological finds. Notably, these sourcesare the Eddas and sagas – the great mediaeval literature of NorthEurope, much of it written in Iceland, popularised/romanticisedduring the nineteenth century and subsequently as ‘NorseMythology’, and most familiar to English-speaking readers in theform of children’s stories. The Eddas and sagas have been fruitfulfields of study for scholars of mediaeval literature, anthropology,history, religious studies, and folklore. They are also assiduouslyscanned (together with Old English texts and other pieces whichmight give clues to pre-Christian spirituality) by practitioners.These latter have a number of names for themselves and what theydo:Ásatrúis the name used in Iceland (see Strmiska 2000) andcommon in North America: other Scandinavian formations of thisterm – literally ‘faith in the gods’, coined as part of the nineteenthcentury romantic movement – include Åsatro,Åsatrú,Asatro.Theadoption of this term in Iceland was for present-day politicalreasons, and many practitioners, there and elsewhere, prefer theterms forn sidror forn sed, simply ‘the old way’. However, the termIntroducing shamanism, seidr and self 5"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"preferred by many practitioners in Britain, gaining popularity inNorth America and used by people elsewhere as a descriptor, issimply ‘Heathen’(heidinn, hedensk), initially used by those whofollowed the ‘new’ religion of Christianity to describe the followersof the ‘old ways’, later becoming a term of abuse, now beingreclaimed by those who have read the mediaeval literature, andthose who refer to the ‘people of the heath’ (Thompson 1998; Cope1998) – suitably for those who would follow the spirits of the land,wherever they may be.So, here, I explore the construction and experience of today’sseidr, as shamanistic practice derived from accounts in the Icelandicsagas. Seidr has a basis within reconstructionist Northern Europeanspiritual communities, and shamanistic groups who adopt methodsand principles derived from shamanisms elsewhere and from core-shamanism (Harner 1980). For an ethnographer of post-modernsociety it is a rich field of study. Its construction is somewhatproblematic, with terms and practices disputed in past and present,and gendered political aspects of its implementation that rapidlybecome apparent where discourses of seidr and seidworkers conflictwith discourses hegemonic in Western societies. In particular, thereare issues around gender and sexuality, and practitioners use theterms of the past within today’s narrative constructions, to recreateor subvert hegemonic practice and to shape new meanings forthemselves and directions for their communities. As culturallyspecific shamanistic, possibly shamanic, practice, seidr positions itspractitioners within the cosmology of the North and North-West ofEurope – the Well of Wyrd and the great tree Yggdrasill – as seekersmove within the Nine Worlds in quest of knowledge from deitiesand ancestors.I write as an anthropologist and as a practitioner. I follow thestrands of seidr practice from present to past, across an ocean andthrough the Nine Worlds of Norse, Northern, or more generally,‘Heathen’ cosmology. In this, what I produce here is a multi-sitedethnography (Marcus 1998), as I explore processes of seidr, f ro mpractitioner to practitioner, community to community, time to time;from spatially located ritual practice and my ethnographer’s tapedinterviews to worldwide email-discussion lists, and through my own,as well as others’, experiences. I write, then, in quest of my ownknowledges, situated by my relation to the practices I discuss: like aseer or shaman, and indeed at time asa seer, I go out into a worldof many levels that is only partly known, and return with6 Introducing shamanism, seidr and self"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"experiences to share. My journey has taken me into possible,disputed, past understandings of being and consciousness,linguistics and comparative religion, mediaeval literature andarchaeology, queer theory and understandings of ‘self ’ and‘meaning’ that slip away, change even as they are examined, as thevision changes when the seeress tries to probe further. On manylevels, therefore, this is a work of experiential anthropology (Goulet1994): observation is not enough to understand relations betweenseidworkers and the spirit world. My own experiences form part ofwhat I analyse, and inevitably position me within the layers ofmeaning that are constructed within the seidr seance and within thecommunities of those who engage with it. Insights within this bookhave been developed in dialogue with many beings. As practitionerand as writer, I engage with worlds and meanings, exploring ways torelate these within the discourses of academia and everyday writing,and by stepping outside these into the language of poetry andimagery. I deal here with current debates within academia andanthropology, on disputed ‘realities’, metaphor and representation,ethnographic theory and methods, ‘shamanism’ as a Westernconstruction of assumed primordial, primaeval, and ‘primitive’religion versus ‘shamanisms’ as creative, contested political andspiritual invention, as well as the multiple realities of theseidworkers.So, like the shaman, I journey out and back, within the culturalcontexts of the discourses of academia and those of seidworkers,and I am transformed by the experience.Introducing shamanism, seidr and self 7"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The saying of the NornsThe Welling of WyrdThey sit, three raised above all others in the room, hands joined:Urdr, who knows all past, and who has direction of this ritual;We rdende who holds the strands that make the present, and tellstheir weaving; centrally Skuld,obligation, asking: ‘do youunderstand me?’ Before them stands Jordsvin, the guide for thisspae-working, who asks ‘is there one here who has a question forthe Norns?’ And one after another, we step forth.We have come here by means of a journey beginning in the barnat Martha’s Orchard, which serves for the great hall of our feastingand assembly at Trothmoot,1June 1997.

Experienced workers stress thedifficulties of interpreting seidr imagery – answers are often complexand may be misleading – and emphasise obtaining a ‘second opinion’before committing oneself to a course of action based on seidrknowledge, for instance through rune divination, seen as anotherway to dip into the Well of Wyrd in quest of knowledge.I note also the differences between this public working, with itsmany questioners, and the private ‘journey’ sessions in which peopleseek their own answers, perhaps without knowing what it is theyseek. The small group with whom I had been working structuretheir rituals according to whether the rite is private or public:private journeyings require less scene-setting, as the group membersknow where they are going, and do not always have the pattern ofquestion and answer, question and answer.

Otherspae-workers, in interviews, report similar circumstances. Winifred –We rdende of the Three Norns ritual – speaks of a far less elaboratesetting when she does spae for a friend, or for herself. Jordsvin,himself a spámadr, a man who speaks prophesy, modifies and omitspart of the ritual when performing spae for his kindred. The seekercan be solitary, ‘sitting out’ to seek guidance.Yet however simple or elaborate the format of the ritual, thosewho do this work report on the intensity of the experience and itscentrality as a focus of identity construction. Winifred describes thefirst time she did spae-working:the moment when I stepped up to the high seat for the first timeand sat down in it and put the veil over my head and theystarted singing for me, what I felt then was that I had beenwalking my entire life to reach that one moment. So it was like,it’s really like a vocation for me, that’s calling me. And all thedifferent paths have come together in that.It is her contribution to the Heathen community, a way that she canassist her deities and her people. Jordsvin points out that ‘peoplelove it. My kindred loves it. When I do this some other people fromamong the pagan community show up also.’ He says that comparedto Winifred, he is only beginning to ‘scratch the surface’. He haslearned from her, and from receiving materials from the groupknown as Hrafnarin California, and attending their workshops.Winifred in turn says:I had been taking trance journeys myself for about five yearsbefore having Diana’s training...And I, for that I used, I’ve readlots and lots of books on shamanism and you know, picked andchose what seemed to make sense to me, in terms of ways, but itcame very easily to me.If answers are produced, where do they come from: Gods, spirits,those who have gone before, the seeker’s subconscious? Rational-liberal anthropology, of course, says the latter. Jungian psychologywould suggest a collective-unconscious origin. The answers do notalways have meaning for the speaker, but they do seem to for thequestioner. Practitioners have their own answers. ‘It’s not archetypesand the collective unconscious, or at least it’s more than that asThe saying of the Norns 11"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"well,’ says Jordsvin. ‘I expect most of this is coming from the deadpeople, because that’s where I go.’ He journeys within Hel’s realm:in Norse tradition, wisdom comes from the dead, from the mound.Others may focus on deities as the source of the answers, dependingon what is asked: rituals may involve deity-possession (described byWallis 1999b: chapter 2).Cosmology, deities and ‘lore’We are dealing, here, with people who have immersed themselves inthe mythology, literature and folklore of the North: the poetry andprose of the Eddas and Icelandic sagas, together with Old Englishpoetry, and folktales and folklore from Scotland, England,Scandinavia and much of Europe. From this, and drawing on thework of scholars such as Hilda Ellis Davidson (e.g. 1964) or KevinCrossley-Holland (e.g. 1980), practitioners have put together what istoday called Heathenism or Ásatrú, which they perceive as areligion for today, based on pre-Christian beliefs and traditions.Why do people come to this? Their stories vary considerably.Some, particularly in Europe but occasionally as part of anemigrant family, grew up with the mythology and the folklore.Others feel a connection to land, and the spirits of the land. Manyfollowers in Europe or North America seek a form of connectionwith ancestors, either physical or spiritual. Some approach from adissatisfaction with ‘established’ religion, others from atheism oragnosticism, often experimenting first with other ‘Earth-religions’,particularly Wicca. Often the search has taken some time. ‘I huntedfor this religion, since youth,’ one North American Heathen says. Inone way or other, they have formed personal connections with themythology, imagery, or philosophy. Thus, the spae-woman Winifredtells her story. During her not inconsiderable quest for spiritualmeaning:I realised that all the images I had and that I related to were ofNorthern Europe, of monasteries and traditions and customsand everything, and that the more I looked into all of thosethings the more I realised that they had Heathen roots.But an even stronger strand came from philosophical approaches,and own quest within religious studies. She describes her search,including:12 The saying of the Norns"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"the wish to move into a polytheistic religion, because I havealways had trouble with the idea of a monotheistic religion. Ithink polytheistic is much closer to reality as I see it anyway,and then of course that made room for the feminine principlethat I was looking for, also. I was able to find some of thesebooks that came out in the late 80s and early 90s, and was veryimpressed and was definitely seriously considering it, but whatfinally tipped the balance was reading Bauschatz’The Well andthe Tree, and his explication of the philosophy with Wyrd, youknow, coming out of the layers of the well, coming up into thetree, dripping down after life, life had formed the deeds ... Imean I’ve studied I think all of the major religious andphilosophical systems with, with great interest and havinglearned and gained from doing so, but none of them did I feelreally described reality the way I see it. And this did.A practitioner in England experimented first with Wicca and‘Celtic’ mythology, before turning to Heathenry after connectingwith ‘the runes’, the Northern writing systems used (at least today)for magic or divination.How did I get into this?...always had a feel for nature, anddecided, having not stuck with Wicca, Hermetic magic, etc, toget into my own land. But the ‘Celts’ didn’t work – too manyromantic images and too complex (enigmatic) a mythology.Then came the runes. I was home.In Britain, Harvey (1997) has described Heathen beliefs andcosmology, focused on the tree Yggdrasill and the Nine Worlds, andthe deities and other spirits described in Norse mythology: the Æsirand Vanir, and the Norns who spin Wyrd below the tree, togetherwith jotnaror giants,álfaror elves, and Landwights. There arenumerous ways in which Heathens relate to this cosmology,including seidr and rune-use in addition to formal (non-ecstatic)ritual practice. Within North American practice, I earlierinvestigated public narratives that prevail in the Heathencommunity, as they are indexed in the discourse of practitioners.These include (derived from Blain 1997, 1998a and forthcoming, b):1References to myths and stories of the Æsir and Vanir, forinstance to explain characteristics or personalities of the gods.The saying of the Norns 13"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Followers of Ásatrú index specific pieces of what is referred toas ‘the lore’. Knowledge of this material forms a backdrop toritual and discussion. Many Heathens consider that people doexperience the deities in their own ways, and personalrevelations (point 4, below) are known on one email list asUnusual Personal Gnoses (UPGs), which can be checkedagainst, and remain secondary to, ‘the lore’.2A concept of polytheism (as distinct from monotheism orduotheism, or a Jungian discussion of ‘archetypes’). The godsare spoken of as real entities, separate and distinct, withrounded personalities and differentfrom, for instance, Celtic orGreek or Native American beings or deities.33Along with this goes a sense ofcultural specificity. Blót andSumbel, the ritual forms of Ásatrú, are spoken of as distinct inkind from, e.g., a Wiccan circle. Again, they are drawn from‘the lore’.4The possibility of direct communication with these beings, tospeak with them and gain various forms of knowledge. Ininterviews with Heathen practitioners and theologians, thisnarrative of communication appears as an explanation of howthey ‘know’ about their deities and why these deities appear so‘real’ to them. Direct communication is a means of achievingpersonal gnosis (UPG). With this discourse of direct communi-cation may go:5The manipulation of consciousness or ‘reality’ by them orthrough magic inspired by them: including galdr (chantedmagic), runic magic, and spae-working or seidr. Not allHeathens practice seidr or attend sessions. More, probably themajority, engage in rune-divination or rune-magic, oftenincluding galdr. However, not all practitioners of Ásatrú engagein, or give credence to, magic as something they can perform.6A sense that spirituality is not separate from everyday life, butinforms it. Many Heathens place a high value on skills of dailyliving known from ‘lore’, archaeology or later folk-practices –woodcraft, fibre-crafts, smith-crafts, brewing, etc. A craft-fair isan important part of an Ásatrú gathering. Part of this is therelation of Heathens with Earth: focused on by some morethan others, though all see Earth as living, or personified by adeity.7A sense of individual merit and responsibility, combined withcommunity worth. Some Heathens list ‘Nine Noble Virtues’,14 The saying of the Norns"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"moral values or strictures. Others talk about individualresponsibility and ‘being true’ in more general terms: peoplehave a choice in what they do on a daily basis, and need toaccept responsibility for their choice.8This sense of responsibility goes hand in hand with anelaborate concept of ‘soul’ and ‘self ’, which is currently beingexplored by some Heathen researchers – with reference, onceagain, to ‘the lore’. With this goes a concept of personal orfamily fate or ørlög, and overall ‘Wyrd’, which people, and theNorns, weave.9The Elder Kin (deities) also are subject to the workings ofWyrd.Not all Heathens, then, are involved with seidr practices. Thosewho are, combine ‘lore’ with their personal experiences of deity andcosmology. They seek answers, for not only their own questions, butthose of the community, concerning direction, relations betweendeities and people, environment and the spirits of the earth. Theirdescriptions of where the answers come from make reference tocosmology, the Norns, the Well of Wyrd, and the tree Yggdrasill,which seidworkers see as the centre of the Nine Worlds and the linkbetween them, signified in the Common Germanic futhark (24-staverune-set) by the rune *Eihwaz, the Yew Tree. This concept of Wyrdis one that is being developed within the community. Though oftentranslated as ‘fate’ and sometimes equated to ‘karma’, it has a moredynamic sense. People are active agents in the creation of their ownpersonal wyrd, or ørlög. Their deeds and vows, strands oførlög,become part of the fabric of Wyrd. Seidworkers may beconceptualised as ‘reading’ Wyrd, seeing along the threads of thefabric to possible outcomes. Others within the community considerthat seidr in the past involved active interception of the fabric,‘tugging’ at the threads, and this concept will be investigated infurther chapters.Seidr or spae? What’s in a name...Within the seidr séance, the answers are only part of the experience.For the participants, there is a journey of discovery, a quest to obtainthe answers, assisted or accompanied by spirit-helpers, as alreadyoutlined. This is soul work: the seeress sends out part of her spirit,faring forth through the worlds to seek knowledge. There are differentThe saying of the Norns 15"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"ways in which the search for answers is described, experienced, oraccomplished. It may indeed be a ‘journey’, the seer may be ‘trans-ported’ to a place where answers are, or at times answers may bebrought by other beings. Practitioners develop their own techniques.Winifred calls her technique ‘spae’, from spá, speaking or fore-telling. She is spákona, a spae-woman: the word is akin to theScottish ‘spaewife’. Others use the term ‘oracular seidr’ for theseforms of divination, and seidr comes also in other, non-oracularforms, reflecting a wide range of practices associated with healing,protection, transition. According to Jordsvin:There are other forms of seidr being done, and there are otheruses besides what I was taught...I’ve also found, uh, that I canuse this to basically unhaunt houses.‘De-ghosting’ is his term for this. He could also point to the use ofseidr for warding people against harm, particularly psychic orpsychological danger, although physical danger may be warded also.Seidr may require a more active or deliberate participation thanspae, involving as it does journeying to speak with other beings –spirits – to find that which is unknown, or invoke their aid towardssome stated end.4Seidr was brought first to the Æsir by Freyja(according to Snorri5), and apparently learned by Ódinn who coulduse it not only to forecast future possibilities but (again accordingto Snorri) to manipulate them. This includes the possibility of usefor protection, and also for what Jordsvin calls ‘a kind of psychicattack, as messing with people’s minds’. He emphasises that this isnot what he does:You have to have a pretty damn good reason before you goplaying games like that. I’ve had some pathworking where I’vebeen shown how to do that, and it would be for self-defence inemergency purposes only. Uh you don’t do this because you’repissed at somebody, because they were snide to you, you do thisbecause they’re a threat to your life or health or somebody inyour family. So I stress I do oracular seidr, I also stress thatwhat I have done so far has been Diana Paxson’s and Hrafnar’sversion of oracular seidr. People develop their own varieties butmine is definitely a variety of that.Those who have derived the modern practice of spae-working – ororacular seidr – have drawn on accounts from the sagas, most16 The saying of the Norns"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"notably the scene in the Saga of Eirík the Redwhere a spákona,aspae-woman or prophetess, is asked to come to a Greenlandcommunity which has been undergoing hard times. Her costume –gloves, hood, staff, belt and talisman pouch, the stones thatdecorate her blue cloak – is described in some detail. Even hereating utensils are described. She is asked to predict the progress ofthe community, but to do so requires her to engage in an elaborateritual. She eats a meal of the hearts of all the kinds of animals kepton the farmstead, and the next day at nightfall she prepares to doseidr, which requires a special song6to be sung to ‘the powers’. Inthis case the song is sung so well that she is able to learn moreinformation than ever before, as many spirits, or powers, are said tobe satisfied by its singing.This and other accounts of seidr and/or spae-working have beenexamined in detail by those who are reconstructing the ritualswithin the North American Ásatrú community: most notably DianaPaxson and other members of her group Hrafnar (as Jordsvin’saccount makes plain), who in the article ‘The Return of the Völva’(Paxson n.d.) and other materials produced for circulation withinthe Heathen community indicate the derivation of their practices.From the old material it is unclear where the boundaries of ‘seidr’and ‘spae’ lie and whether these were distinct, though overlappingmagical techniques. Was the Greenland völva,Porbjörg, a seidr-worker who included spae, foretelling, as part of her seidr-practice,or was she primarily a prophetess who drew upon seidr techniquesto enhance her spae-work? She is addressed with respect, andalways as a spae-woman (spákona), whereas some others given theterm seidkonaare portrayed in a negative light.For instance: one source readily available7to Heathens andothers attempting to reconstitute Northern religious practices is thethirteenth-century History of the Kings of Norway, written by theIcelander Snorri Sturluson, usually known as Heimskringlafrom itsfirst words relating to the circle of the earth. The opening section isYnglingasaga, the story of the Yngling dynasty. Initial chapterstrace descent from the deities, euhemerised as kings, priestesses andpriests. Chapter 7, dealing with Ódinn’s practice of seidr, journeyingand transformatory magic, indicates a very negative approach toseidr and other forms of what is usually translated ‘witchcraft’. Inparticular, Snorri says that men performing seidr were ergi– ahighly insulting word at the time – so that it was taught instead togydjar, priestesses. The negative associations may occur in olderThe saying of the Norns 17"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"material, such as the verse which deals with the coming of Heidr inVöluspá, the Speaking of the Seeress, the first poem found in thePoetic Edda. Common translations give something approximating:‘She practised seidr where she could...playing with soul, she wasever dear to evil women.’ (This glossing is disputed, and is examinedin chapter 6, and ‘ergi’ in chapter 7.)In accounting for the ‘evil magic’ of seidr, historian JennyJochens (1996) suggests that it was magic practised initially bywomen, with its practice by men seen as problematic, effeminisingor ergi(even for Ódinn), possibly because it may (in her view) haveincluded female ‘receptive’ sexual activities. Though Jochens’characterisation ofergias necessarily sexual is not shared by allwho analyse the material within academia or within Northernspiritual practice, the term has become part of the vocabulary oftoday’s practitioners, as I examine in chapter 7. Further, and relatedto this as part of the context of today’s practice, ambiguity andambivalence about seidr and its implications for gender andsexuality are not all related to interpretation of the old material.These are those who still fear ‘women’s power’, and for whomrituals performed mostly or exclusively by women are suspect: manypractitioners of spae and seidr today are women, or gay men –marginalised by today’s society – and for some few this is sufficientto render the practice of either seidr or spae (or any ritual form inwhich clearly defined gender categories and gendered dominance ischallenged) doubtful at best, evil at worst. The discourses ofmainstream twentieth/twenty-first-century categorisations are hardto overturn, and it must be admitted that some of those who professto be ‘Ásatrú’ or ‘Odinist’ are seeking confirmation, not challenge,to their dearly held beliefs of superiority.8Knowledge and powerare linked, and in the poem Völuspáthe Völva’s power is clearlydemonstrated: Ódinn will know only as much as she tells him, whileshe knows all.Alone she sat out when the Old One came,the terrible Ás, and looked into her eyes:Why question me? Why test you me?All I know, Ódinn, where you left your eyeWithin the wondrous well of Mímir.Mímir each morning drinks his meadfrom Valfather’s pledge. Would you yet know more?(Völuspá28, my trans.)18 The saying of the Norns"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Throughout the anthropological literature, there are indicationsof magic-workers being viewed ambivalently within their cultures,with this ambivalence easily transformed to negativity. Suspicion ofsorcery is evident in the classical studies of African ‘witchcraft’(notably Evans-Pritchard 1937), and in later material such asCrawford (1967).9In her anthropological novel Return to Laughter,Bohannan (1964) produces a narrative of how a magic-workerbecomes a highly threatening figure. Turning attention nearer home,accounts from the Scottish witch-hunts of the early modern periodshow that a ‘good witch’ was considered by the church to be at leastas problematic as one who used her (usual) talents for ‘evil’ (Larner1981). When this material is viewed within an analytical frameworksupplied by anthropological considerations of gender, magic andsocial power, the negativity becomes more comprehensible,especially if dominant Western discourses of gender and dualismare considered as part of the equation – under development duringthe ‘witch-craze’, shaping the anthropological accounts of twentieth-century African magical practice, and informing consciousness andpractice of present-day Heathens. The embedding of ‘witches’,‘victims’, ‘unwitchers’ – and ethnographer – in ambiguities ofpolitics and discourse is made evident in Favret-Saada’s (1980)Deadly Words: Witchcraft in the Bocage. More recent accounts ofspecific ‘shamanisms’ within changing socio-political contexts pointto the re-emergence of ‘shamans’ as something that is notunproblematic. Thus, King (1999) discusses the re-emergence of‘vampiric shamans’ in Kamchatka. In a situation of change, onewho is seen as responsible may be viewed with suspicion, and theally may easily become the one most feared.Seidr and shamanismIt seems possible that both seidr and spae-working may form part ofthe rather scattered remnants of shamanic techniques in Norseculture, and have been related to the shamanic practices of othercultures (Dubois 1999; Hultkrantz 1992). Writ large, Norse cultureof the Viking age viewed through the (later) saga accounts does notstrike the reader as shamanicas such: this would have required theshaman to be a central figure within society, even while beingviewed ambiguously, whereas seidworkers appear in the sagas asmarginalised figures, and spae-workers, though respected, are rare.Yet, seeresses and other practitioners apparently did work in waysThe saying of the Norns 19"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"describable as ‘shamanistic’ – and often it is said that they weretrained by ‘the Finns’, referring probably to the nomadic Sámi, apeople who were truly ‘shamanic’ (see e.g. Pentikäinnen 1984, andHultkrantz 1994). Today’s seidworkers are drawing on the shamanicpractices of various indigenous religions, and the work of thosewho have studied these cultures and religions. Like other neo-shamans they have read The Way of the Shaman(Harner 1980) andEliade’sShamanism(1964), and some have read recent ethno-graphies. Winifred draws also on her training within Christianspirituality. However practitioners point to a need to keep thecosmological focus, maintain the journeying within a multi-dimensional ‘map’ of the Nine Worlds. They engage, therefore, witha debate over ‘authenticity’. When sources are sparse, how‘authentic’, how close to an original, can today’s practicesapproach? Rather than attempting perfect reconstruction, at leastsome practitioners focus on the cultural and cosmologicalframework. Techniques may be transferable – drumming, chanting,singing to achieve ecstatic communication with ‘spirits’ – but theexperience of the journey or the spirit contact, its focus and itsoutcome for self or community, is specific. As Heathen seidmanBilLinzie says (in an interview for the magazine Idunna):First off, I am faithful to the Northern Gods – in other words,Ásatrú – and have been for almost twenty years. Everythingthat I do, think, say, perceive, or whatever is passed throughthat belief system. And because it is filtered through thatsystem, everything I practice is authentic.(Linzie 1995: 17)This sense of ‘authenticity’ is rather far from that of practitionerswho consider that whatever they do must be a direct reflection ofpast practices. In Bil’s case the present day is experienced through acosmological filter. Indeed, if seidr experiences are ‘shamanic’ theymust be constructed in dialogue with whatever helping spirits arepresent, and therefore each seidr experience is unique, newlynegotiated: never simply replication. Bil makes plain that he is a‘shaman’ for today (he prefers the term ‘seidman’), a NorthAmerican working within a living landscape specific to his area ofthe United States. He is neither a Viking nor an ancient Saxon nor aGermanic tribesperson. What he constructs is for today, as acommunity practitioner dealing with a multi-cultural, multi-20 The saying of the Norns"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"religious community, mediating between folk, land and spirits.One point that many seidr practitioners make is that learning todo seidr is taught through doing it, and that the ‘teachers’ are not somuch other practitioners as those met within the journey: whichagain fits with traditional shamanic, and present-day neo-shamanistic accounts. Teachers may be ancestors, animal ‘allies’,spirits of the land or of plants, the Norns, deities including Ódinnhimself. Highly intense experiences can be involved with finding ateacher or communicating with ancestors or land spirits. Initiationor other trance-journeys may be experienced as terrifying, asrevealing, as wondrously beautiful, as all of these, resulting in majorchanges in how the person interprets their ‘self ’ and otherrelationships in which they are involved.The most common questions about seidr, however, regard whatoccurs or wherethe seer/ess journeys. Writer Diana Paxson, who hasdone considerable work in this area and derived much of the formmost often used for oracular seidr, recommends preparatoryactivities including breathing exercises, and guided meditationswithin a Norse cosmological framework, including those in whichthe purpose is to meet a spirit ally or guardian, a ‘power animal’.The one who journeys to seek answers should be able to deal withtransfers of energy and to have a source – from drumming, from apower animal, from a personal reservoir – to provide this energy. Anecessary part of the experience is to be able to describe it. Here –in the start of an initiation story, which led to her initialconstruction of oracular seidr – Diana Paxson has described a keyevent, occurring within non-ordinary reality, during a neo-shamanicworkshop run by Michael Harner.10I am walking through a grey land ... a world of grey mist thatswirls among mighty stones. The raven flies ahead of me, notclear... but brilliant as the image of the sun against closed eyelids,bright/dark/bright wings against the shadowed stones.Where are you taking me?’ I ask, and try to go faster.11I was aware of faint sounds from the world that I had leftbehind me, but wrapped in my grey cloak, I was insulated fromboth the noises and the chill of the building where the workshopwas being held. Long practice helped me control my breathingand sink back into trance, to trust myself to Michael Harner’ssteady drumming and let it thrust me into the vision again.The saying of the Norns 21"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The stones stand like pylons to either side, their rough surfacesinscribed with scratches whose meaning has been worn away bythe winds of countless years.

I would never have dared to claim a raven as an ally.Especially not this one, this Grandmother of ravens, whose tongueis as sharp as her pointed beak.But I thought that she was going to teach me what I want toknow...Ms Paxson adds, in her commentary, that she analysed the processeven as she experienced this shamanic ‘journey’. As a Westerner, shehad learned to separate personal experience from scientific‘textbook knowledge’, and to discount the former. She wassuspicious also, because of her knowledge of ravens in both Nativeand European mythology, and what they implied....When I sought a power animal in the Underworld, Iunderstood the significance of the raven who came to me. Butjust because I recognised her, it was easy to suspect myself ofwishful thinking. ...

Shut up andcome along!’The process of initiation, by spirits or deities, not people, can bequite terrifying. The experience of the seeress Raudhildr is a case inpoint. This is how it appears in my field notes, written after she hadtold me the story in a coffee-shop in Berkeley, California.She made a journey to visit the Maurnir, who (according to herand Diana) are female giants. The Maurnir dwell in a cave, andshe went there, naively she says, because she thought it would22 The saying of the Norns"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"be interesting. She was attempting to journey to all of thedenizens of the Nine Worlds.They were there, and saw her, and asked why she was there. TheMaurnir have much wisdom, and she asked (again naively, shesays) if they would teach her, if she could learn from them,share in their wisdom. They said no, they couldn’t teach her,but if she wished she could become part of the wisdom. Sheagreed that this would be a good thing.So they ate her.They threw aside the bones, as they ate. Her bones were lyingon the cavern floor, when Loki appeared and started dancingand singing, calling to the goddesses and gods to put her backtogether, which they eventually did. So Loki was dancing ashaman dance. When she was together again, she thanked himand asked him why he’d done this. He said ‘once, you gave me adrink’ (as an offering in a ritual).This account is also discussed by Wallis (1999b: 87) as involving the‘death and dismemberment’ experiences of traditional shamanicinitiations. I give another ‘initiation’ account, that of Bil, in chapter7. Such accounts are difficult to deal with, for many anthropologists,and lead to questions about how to regard and treat such data aspart of the construction of meaning and expertise of practitioners.Part of the work I am turning to within experiential anthropologyinvolves finding ways to convey these meanings, in poetry or prose.Performance or accomplishment?Within studies of shamanisms today, a word much in use is‘performance’. Seidr as I have described it here can indeed be seenas ‘performance’: the scene is set, those working within it act tochange the awareness of their ‘audience’, and there is a script, anoutline which the production will take, even though the details of itemerge from the interaction of all those present. Seidr can beanalysed with the same tools used to evaluate a stage production;and from the point of those observing, either the performance‘works’ (in its effect on the audience), or it does not. From the pointof view of the ‘performer’, things are rather different. GalinaLindquist (1997) has discussed the use of this term and thetheoretical perspectives associated with it, in entitling her book onneo-shamanic seidr in Sweden,Shamanic Performances on the UrbanThe saying of the Norns 23"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Scene. As my own orientation to the material is that of bothseidworker and theoretical analyst, I will give several sides to thisargument in stating my own position.Several seidworkers and other neo-shamanic practitioners haveexpressed opposition. The popular view of ‘performance’ is ofsomething that is a scripted role (‘playing a part’), unreal, fictional,‘made up’, fake, put on for effect, or all of these at once. ‘What aperformance!’ we say when a child throws a temper-tantrum: orwith very different emphasis, when the singer who has transportedus to another realm bows, smiles and becomes – we consider – likeeveryone else: despite the glorious voice, to the audience she was not‘really’ Brunnhild, she neither truly loved, nor truly died.So, for Jonathan Horwitz, shamanic practitioner and teacher,whose essay on the internet (Horwitz n.d.) addresses problems ofviewing shamanism as ‘performance’ or ‘role analysis’: in hisshamanic work there is nothing that is ‘fake’, he engages with realworlds and real spirits. Lindquist explains that for her also, asparticipant/ethnographer within Horwitz’ seance, the moment wasclearly real. Yet within anthropology ‘performance’ has distinctmeanings, as outlined by Csordas (1996) and Schieffelin (1996),which Lindquist examines, and which I turn to, below.First though, for me the word holds another meaning, from earlytraining as a dancer, where ‘performance’ was contrasted with‘rehearsal’ and so implied total involvement, focused appreciationof what one was doing, and a sense that meaning cannot beseparated from doing: seidr (or dance) is process, not ‘thing’ ordefinition. The performance, as ‘doing’, as ‘creating’, engages the‘performer’, absorbs her, demands fullest attention, to be successfulin likewise involving its audience. This meaning resonates withattempts to connect experience with ‘what is done’, perception withaction, and hence performance with event, within a culturalinterpretative frame, as persuasive act which creates conditions forchange in both audience and performer (to use Csordas’ 1996definition).Seidworkers like other neo-shamans – and traditional shamans –are sensitive to the charge that their ‘performance’ is not ‘real’. Yetindeed where traditional shamanisms are fuelled by communityenergy (Turner, pers. com.) part of the process may be construed as‘performance’ within the popular discursive sense, in its scene-setting, and the need to put on a ‘show’ that is sufficiently engagingto draw in the (human and spirit) bystanders so that that interaction24 The saying of the Norns"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"of shaman and spirit can become increasingly ‘real’ or vivid to allconcerned. Shamans may be judged by their ‘performance’,therefore: is it sufficiently convincing? Schieffelin (1996) gives anexample of rival practitioners, in a New Guinea mediumistic séance,where the performance of one or of his spirit-helperis notsuccessful: it is rejected by the audience/participants. In oracularseidr there may be audience members for whom the ‘performance’ isnot effective and questions are asked about the validity of this seidr:which relates not only to whether a particular seeress did ‘actually’engage with spirits or ‘see’ as claimed, but to the use-value ofinformation received and reliability of the spirits the seer contacts.Is a particular spirit trustworthy? Each audience member evaluatesthe séance through their own past experiences and engagement withdiscourses of spirit beings.Csordas indicates that the ‘performance’ concept is often appliedto ‘a ritual’ as a whole, without attention to the details within it asalso, anthropologically, ‘performances’, and explains further:Here is what I mean: The shaman’s formal narration of hisjourney to the realm of spirits is taken as data byanthropologists, but he is rarely questioned about the qualitiesof that realm and what it is like to move about in it. Theshaman’s narrative is treated as an element within the ritualperformance – is it not the case, however, that the experience henarrates has the structure of performance in itself, prior tonarratization?(Csordas 1996: 94–5)Csordas refers here to what he calls the ‘imaginal performances’ ofthe shaman’s engagement with spirits, clients, or others, details ofwhich do not necessarily appear within whatever narrative isproduced in the course of the event observed. He calls, therefore, forattention to those invisible details: ‘experiential specificity’. Thosedetails, for me, form the central experience of the shaman orseidworker – which I am trying to display in this book – but it ishere that the concept of performance (particularly ‘imaginalperformance’) becomes most problematic, because here the shamanis most open to the (outsider’s) charge of invention. Schieffelin’spoint that for the New Guinea Kaluli it is the spirit (not themedium) whose performance is judged raises the question of how,anthropologically, we can approach questions of evaluating theThe saying of the Norns 25"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"construction of meaning within seidr or shamanism. Rather than‘performance’, therefore, my preference is for a phrase which ismore cumbersome but avoids the concept of ‘fake’ or ‘role’: whatthe seidworker does can be addressed as negotiation within acultural framework, interaction with spirits, and through this,activeaccomplishment of meaning.Seidr and the anthropologistWithin today’s anthropology, therefore, there are attempts beingmade to find ways to discuss such experiences, dealing withconcepts such as the reality of the experience to the participant, andwithin it (or its narration) the use of what is seen by outsideobservers as symbol and metaphor. Goulet and Young (1994) speakof such ‘extraordinary experiences’ in terms of multiple realities.Within one reality mode, so to speak, we construct experience andmeaning by attending to sets of symbols and sensations that withinanother reality mode would go unchecked. As we shift mode, newpossibilities become apparent, and old ones disappear. Ms Paxson’scommentary on her experience illustrates this point. By heraccount, she had to work rather hard to prevent her rationalistpreconceptions from disrupting her journey; and the subsequentevents involving finding her teacher led her to consider that she wasnot simply inventing a scenario.I know that I can make up stories,Diana said.Was I inventing this one now?Other seidworkers have likewise answered: No. Jordsvin pointsout that his physical experiences after doing oracular seidr tally withthose of others: a feeling of cold, hunger, and a need to replenishenergy, often followed by a ‘second wind’ he calls ‘seidr rush’. Hisanswers, even those which make no sense to him, do so to thequestioner.I don’t think I’m crazy. I get people coming up to me after theseseidr sessions when I’m stuffing my face, and resting, and they’llsay, oh you said this that and the other. And you know I’ll say,yeah, I wonder what the Hel that meant. And they’ll say, well itmeant this this this, that was right on the money. And I did notknow it, this is things for people I did not know.But can I, as an anthropologist, tell his experiences in this way?As a fieldworker, I collect descriptions of seidwork, from Jordsvin26 The saying of the Norns"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"and others. His experiences are direct, compelling. As anexperiential ethnographer, I also record my own impressions,images, experiences. The description with which this chaptercommenced was of my experience as an audience member: laterchapters will indicate how I, as well as others, experience the HighSeat of oracular seidr. A large part of my work is in discovery orinvention of ways to relate these experiences, so that the audiencefor my telling – conference attendees, readers of this book – doesnot dismiss them as ‘fantasy’, ‘imaginary’, or by asking ‘what werethese people on?’In relating participants’ accounts, I treat them as description ofprocesses which are occurring. I do not, however, seek to test the‘objective reality’ or otherwise of the processes or the events. Here Ilook to the work being done by others such as Goulet and Youngwho emphasise the need to take seriously the accounts ofinformants, as perception, description informed by world-view,experience constructed within shamanistic framework, situatedknowledge. In order to describe processes of identity construction,as I am attempting to do, this is essential. It does not meanpresenting emic or subjective-insider accounts and theorising as asingle, literal truth. As research fieldworker, I become a broker,attempting to create understandings between cultures or sub-cultures. This task of brokering is a necessary component inattempting to represent ‘insider’ meanings, and translate these into adiscourse that ‘outsiders’ will find acceptable or comprehensible:and hence a concomitant to making a contribution to anytheoretical discussion of identity formation.It is becoming more acceptable to present aspects of the world –or worlds – in ways that do not lay claim to total ‘Truth’ or ultimate‘Reality’. Post-modernist rejection of metanarrative opens possibil-ities for multiple analyses, in which contradiction does notinvalidate insight. Put more simply, the ethnographer need not, inmy view should not, attempt to force observation into a single,scientific, explanatory framework. Seidr is experienced byparticipants from within their own spiritual world-views, as partialtruths, as community construction where ‘community’ includesmore than the visible human participants. I do not attempt to‘rationalise’ the experience or its narrative. I examine its discursiveconstruction, its specificity, its embeddedness and its politicaldimensions, and pose questions about how seid-processes structureidentity, in the knowledge that participants themselves viewThe saying of the Norns 27"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"‘identity’ as a complex matter, and ‘self ’ as requiring both spiritualand socio/psychological theorising. How do these participants, inthis setting, at this time, accomplish meaning? The tradition ofrejecting definitions of ultimate ‘Truth’ is an honourable, thoughminority, one within the social sciences: from the interpre-tative/hermeneutic approaches of (e.g.) Winch (1958) or Taylor(1971), to later social constructionist and narrative approaches, toSmith’s (1987) bifurcated consciousness or Haraway’s (1988)situated knowledges or Marcus’ (1998) multiple meanings andmulti-sited ethnography. I draw on discourse theory, and speak ofcompeting discourses, in order to attempt my own understandingnot only of individuals’ construction of meaning and identity, butof the social natures of self-perception and self-construction, andhow these in turn form part of the constitution of social relationswithin today’s multi-cultural, multi-ethnic and multi-faith societies:including social relations of shamanisms.I stand between worlds, as broker – between liberal-humanism,constructed from academic scepticism and the need for knowledge,and Heathen understanding of the Nine Worlds. Further, I standbetween present and past. I move from one to the other, in my wordsand my sentences, drawing on first one narrative, then another,examining likewise my own. I draw on those ethnographers whomaintain the necessity of an anthropologist experiencing andpositioned within what she is attempting to understand (Favret-Saada 1980), and speak of the need to enter ‘the realm of spiritualexperience’, and treat one’s own experiences as analysable (Turner1994: 72).Yet I continue to write academic papers where I use other folk’swords to describe what I myself know, in part because doing it thisway is more readilyacceptable. And I do this in the knowledge –which I in turn present likewise – that my experiences of doubt, ofattempting to rationalise, of attempting to ‘switch off ’ myacademically trained mind – are not unique but shared with thosewhom I study, and that they too theorise their practice of tenth-century skills within a twenty-first-century milieu. After writing anarticle in which I looked at paradoxes inherent in presenting seidrfor an academic audience – prepared for a book on fieldworkresearch – I discussed my account with Winifred, who balances herwork as a spae-worker with that of a government research ecologist.This is part of her comment.28 The saying of the Norns"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Scientific/ rationalist thinking has a knowledge-domain – alarge one – where it is an eminently suitable tool for the taskswithin that domain. But as you pointed out in your paper, anyconceptual approach comes with its own built-in blind spots,and science is certainly no exception.

As a way of knowing theworld its possibilities are currently limited by its lack of validation,of the sort a twenty-first-century scientist can accept. Yet it has itsown means of testing.Spae-working is another, different route to knowledge; anothertool for the toolbox of the knowledge-craftswoman, which Iaspire to call myself. In the same way that I seek to acquire,interpret, and use knowledge about the world we live in throughthe tool of science/rationality (and I am perfectly competent touse this tool, and respect it as far as it goes), I also seek toacquire, interpret and use other forms of knowledge, outsidethe domain of science, using very different tools. These othertools have gone through their own very rigorous process oftechnical evolution, testing, validation and interpretation,through many generations of many different cultures, religionsand world-views. They are not foolproof, not perfect, not yetfully developed – just as can be said with respect to science andrational thinking – and even more, it is hard to acquire goodtraining and ‘professional’ validation in these areas, at least inour own society.Her task now is to combine her realms of knowledge, and use onemeans within the area of the other. My description of it – in termsof multiple competing discourses – is somewhat different, becausemy starting knowledge-domains are different, but I feel also the needto defragment the whole, and agree with her sentiment that:None of this is easy, either intellectually or psychologically, butyou know how it is: one feels the irresistible urge toward whole-ness, and must heed the call no matter how difficult the path.The saying of the Norns 29"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"So now I conclude this chapter, with the words that came to me as Ifirst wrote of the experience of the Three Norns’ seidr.

Her clothing andshoes, her staff and cloak, are detailed. She is asked to predict theprogress of the community; she eats a meal of the hearts of the farmanimals, and the next day a ‘high seat’ is made ready for her, whereshe will sit to foretell. She engages in ritual practices known as seidr,which requires a special song to be sung to ‘the powers’ in order thatshe may gain their knowledge, in what appears to be ecstatic trance.Today, people are making attempts to reclaim practices of seidr.The previous chapter described a specific seidr ritual: later chapterswill relate more of what people do, and meanings they inscribein/from their practices, meanings which are not always simple oruncontested. They rely on accounts from the sagas and Eddas,scholars’ analyses of this literature, and parallels with shamanicpractices elsewhere, using these within a framework of Norsecosmology and beliefs about soul, afterlife, and the Nine Worlds.Seidworkers engage in faring-forth, trance-journeying, for a varietyof ends, including healing and divination.In this book I am attempting to discuss seidr as sets of practiceinformed by shamanisms (traditional and ‘neo-’) within a largelynon-shamanic community, today and in the past. I hope to indicatesome of the ambiguities inherent in early descriptions andimplications for present-day understandings and contestations ofseidr and its practitioners, and to examine how today’s workers arereconstructing seidr along with its dilemmas and contradictions, asshamanistic practice, which may possibly at times be described asshamanic, within spiritual and religious movements around the turnof the millennium: 1,000 years after the Viking voyages to Vinland.Chapter 3"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Many diverse interpretations of seidr are possible, and the termdoes not imply the same practices to all people. Within NorthAmerica and elsewhere, groups such as Hrafnar, mentioned in theprevious chapter, are developing ‘high-seat’ or ‘oracular’ seidrwithin a context of present-day Heathenism: they are also experi-menting with ‘god-possessory seidr’ as described by Wallis (1999band forthcoming, a). Within Scandinavia, neo-shamanic groups arereconstructing oracular seidr in somewhat different ways, describedby Lindquist (1997) and Jakobsen (1999). I make no claim to haveuncovered the ultimate or only meaning of the term; nor is thisclaim made by any of the groups that I know. It seems likely thatmeaning and implication varied across time and even from onecommunity to another and between individuals during the periodfrom which we have stories of seidr practice. It may have been that,at times, groups of individuals were interested in meeting andsharing techniques and practices; certainly this is the case today, asan issue of the neo-shamanic newsletter Spirit Talk(Kelly 1999a)makes plain, by offering a platform to shamanistic and Heathenpractitioners, myself included. The diversity of articles in this issue,and in a 1998 issue of the Heathen journal Idunna, indicates a widevariety of meanings persist for the term seidr.I will begin with the sources from which reconstructionscommence, and some of the debates, ambiguities or argumentsaround seidr practice and meaning, today or in the past. As today’sHeathens are well aware, the past shapes the present, with actions orthoughts long within Wyrd’s Well forming part of the weaving ofpresent-day Earth-religion. And so I begin where everyone begins,Heathen, neo-shamanist, or academic, with the narrative from theSaga of Eirík the Red.A spákona,Porbjörg, is invited to that Greenland farm. Shewears a hood of lambskin lined with catskin, and has white catskingloves. Her gown is girdled with a belt of touchwood, from whichhangs a bag to hold magical items. Her cloak is blue, fastened withstraps and adorned with stones, and stones stud the head of herstaff, which is topped with a large brass knob. Her calfskin shoesare tied with thick laces, with tin buttons on their ends. On arrival,she does not foretell, but eats the meal described before. The nextday she sits in the high seat, on a cushion stuffed with hens’ feathers,to make her predictions.The description continues:32 The Greenland Seeress"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"A high-seat was prepared for her and a cushion laid under her;... at sunset, she made the preparations which she needed tohave to carry out seidr. She also asked for those women whoknew the wisdom (chant) which was necessary for seidr and wascalled Va rdlokur. But those women could not be found. Thenthe folk dwelling there were asked if anyone knew it. ThenGudrídr said, ‘I am neither magically skilled nor a wise-woman,but Halldís, my foster-mother, taught me that chant in Icelandwhich she called Vardlokur’...The women made a ring aroundthe seat, and Porbjörg sat up on it. Then Gudrídr recited thechant so fairly and well, that it seemed to no one that they hadheard the chant spoken with a fairer voice than was here. Thespae-wife thanked her for the recital and said (that) many of thepowers were now satisfied and thought it fair to hear when thechant was recited so well... ‘And now many of those things areshown to me which I was denied before, and many others’.(Eiríks saga rauda, 4, trans. Gundarsson 1994: 33)The song Gudrídr sang is, unfortunately, not given us.The account ofPorbjörg the Seeress is the basis for today’spractice oforacular seidr, also known as high-seat seidr or spae-working, which I examine in this chapter.Seidr in today’s Heathen practiceHrafnar and other groups, beginning their reconstructions with thestory ofPorbjörg, look for details emerging from the account. TheGreenland Seeress needed first to familiarise herself with thecommunity and its energies, she then sat on a high seat and a specialsong was sung to ‘the powers’ that enabled her to gain herknowledge – or ‘the powers’ to give it to her. The word ‘powers’(náttúrur, from Latin natura, nature, in plural meaning spirits, andtherefore an adopted rather than native Old Icelandic word) isuncertain: it may refer to ancestral spirits, elves (álfar), guardian oranimal spirits or other wights or beings, or deities. Siikala, drawinga parallel with descriptions of the Finnish tietäjä, suggests that ‘thevardlo(k)kur song invokes the companions guarding the witch, herguardian spirits, and at the same time conducts him [sic] to a stateof altered consciousness’ (1992: 72).The mechanisms of how theseeress entered the trance in which she was able to acquireknowledge and the process of questioning her are not evident in theThe Greenland Seeress 33"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"account. Hrafnar have therefore gone to other sources to find detailsof how a seidr seance might be conducted.Their main resources have been the Eddic poems Völuspá,Baldrsdraumr, and Völuspá in skamma(the ‘Shorter Völuspá’,forming a part of the poem Hyndluljöd). Each of these appears toshow part of a question-and-answer process, in which one whoknows, a seeress, a völva, is asked to reveal her knowledge. InVöluspáthe seeress speaks in answer to Ódinn, the god/magician; inBaldrsdraumrÓdinn travels to a grave-mound, just outside Hel’srealm, and there raises the dead völva to answer his questions. InHyndluljöd,the giantess/seeress Hyndla is speaking to Freyja andher follower Óttar about Óttar’s ancestry, when (in the ShorterVöluspá) she starts to foretell the coming of Ragnarok and the fatesof the Gods. From BaldrsdraumrHrafnar have taken the calling ofthe seeress:Way-tame is my name, the son of Slaughter-tame,tell me the news from Hel – I know what’s happening in theworld:for whom are the benches decked with arm-rings,the dais so fairly strewn with gold?(Baldrsdraumar, 6; Larrington 1996: 244)1From Völuspáand the Shorter Völuspácomes the pattern ofquestion and seeress’ answer.Much we have told you, we will tell you more,It’s important that you know it, do you want to know more?(Song of Hyndla; Larrington 1996: 258)2or the briefer version ofVöluspá:Do you understand yet, or what?(Larrington 1996: 7)3Diana Paxson (n.d.) has described the construction of the high-seat seidr ritual in The Return of the Völva, written initially forMountain Thunder, a Heathen journal. I begin here, though, with adifferent narrative – what the anthropologist, observing, sees andhears, what she is told is happening. It is therefore the account of asympathetic ‘outsider’.34 The Greenland Seeress"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The ethnographer’s narrativeA room is prepared, with a ‘high seat’ or seidhjallr. The seidrleader may use various ways of ‘warding’ this space, by singinga runerow or calling to the dwarf-guardians of the directions.She or he calls to the deities who themselves do seidr, Freyjaand Ódinn. A song referring to various spirits or wights, and toFreyja and Ódinn, evokes an atmosphere in which people aligntheir awareness with the cosmology of northern Europe:alternatively one could say that the song summons the spirits,and people become aware of them. Those who will ‘seid’ (theword is a verb as well as a noun) ask their spirit or animal alliesto assist or lead them. Drumming and singing accompany andfacilitate the induction of the ecstatic state. The guide narratesa meditative journey whereby all present, seers and questionersalike, travel down from an initial ‘safe place’, through a tunnelof trees, to the plain of Midgard and the great tree Yggdrasill,then below one of the roots of the World Tree past Urd’s welland through caverns of Earth, or spiralling through various ofthe Nine Worlds, and finally across the echoing bridge with itsguardian maiden Módgudr to the gates of Hel’s realm, theabode of the dead, for in Old Norse tradition wisdom comesfrom the dead, the ancestors. Audience members are expectedto engage with the meditation through visualisation, so thatthey are conceptually in the other world, or worlds, described.The ‘audience’ are told that they now sit outside the gates: onlythe seeress or seer will enter Hel’s realm, urged on by furthersinging and drumming, ‘journeying’ to seek answers toparticipants’ questions. The audience participants remain, in alight trance state, while the seidworker enters deep trance andjourneys on her or his own, assisted by spirit allies or ‘poweranimals’. The seidr-guide sings the seeress through Hel’s gates,and invites other participants to ask their questions, for theseeress to answer.Questioners step forward, and the seeress speaks to them.Usually she sits still, with a veil over her face. Sometimes shemay sway; one, Raudhildr, leans forward, unveiled, and maytake the querant’s hands. When she tires, or when there are nomore questions, the guide ‘calls’ her back from the ancestors’world, and she steps down from the high seat, often movingstiffly, cramped and dazed: another may take her place.The Greenland Seeress 35"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Questions are asked with emotional intensity, and indeedexperienced seidworkers say that the degree of emotion, ormeaning, which the question has for the asker is an importantpart of how ‘truly’ it is answered.

For Winifred, a large part of her work isin making contact with deities, and attempting to place otherpeople, her seidr clients, in a relationship with them.One of the reasons that I love the seidr work is that due topeople’s questions I have the chance to see their relationshipswith the deities that are, for example Sif comes often for afriend of mine, whom I do seeings for...And one of the most interesting seeings that I had was for ayoung man, and Heimdall came for him ...

At other times he travels as a raven,seeing the countryside below him. A question may bring contactwith deities, particularly Heimdallr, Freyja, or Ódinn.

Differences are emerging, for instance in themeditation: not all groups follow the process of spiralling throughdifferent worlds on the path to Hel’s realm which Hrafnar hasdeveloped. Further, not all seidworkings are oracular: people ‘makeseidr’ for protection and for healing (Blain, forthcoming, a).Jordsvin finds himself called upon by people outside his religion touse his trance-journeying abilities to ‘unhaunt houses’.

He described his first venture toHel’s realm, and how he negotiated being in two worlds andmeeting an otherworld seeress.I found it difficult at first, but it got easier and I think as thetime went by, whatever that was, it got increasingly easier andmore and more vivid.. and I was more and more there. And atfirst I had some trouble negotiating being in that world and thisworld, being in the room and in Hel, but I found the staff veryuseful, and ended up clinging onto, onto that for dear life quitea lot of the time. That was a good connection. I found myselfable to sort of look both ways at once. So yeah it gotincreasingly vivid. And I, I heard – the seeress speak as much asI did ‘see’ things myself, and pick up, I don’t know how else toput it, pick up and sense things from what people were asking....I didn’t experience anything I was expecting to experience.Well that’s not entirely true. I mean, I think, I understood theway to, I was going to narrate things, and the way I wouldexperience them in terms of seeing and speaking and listening,I was expecting that to happen because that’s the way I workwith spirits anyway, it’s often all the senses at once, and all overthe place, rather than you know I just have visions or I just hearvoices. So I was expecting that. But everything else, you knowgetting to Hel’s gate ... one of the gates was made of bones,human bones... And I went through and it was just darknesseverywhere. Loads of darkness. Which was actually very, verynice, because as much as it, you know, didn’t feel very pleasantbecause it was a place of death it was also very pleasantbecause it wasa place of death.

Here I will consider first a more detailed account of theHrafnar journey to Hel, then compare this with seidr-practices fromother neo-shamanisms.The road to Hel’s realmWithin the Hrafnar method, the guided journey to Hel’s realm has apurpose. It puts the listeners into a frame of mind where they canstart to think in terms of cultural symbols from Northern Europeanmythology. This is particularly important when the seidr isperformed for a large audience, or one including people whonormally work within other systems of symbols and meanings.Diana Paxson explains the journey and its meaning and purpose, inmaterials she has prepared for training seidworkers (Paxson, inprep.).The journey begins in Midgard, described as the ‘non-ordinaryversion of ordinary reality’, a parallel to the everyday world withlandscapes and creatures that are familiar. In its centre stands thetree Yggdrasill, ‘the axis of all the worlds,’ which Hrafnar and otherpractitioners see as equivalent to the World Tree of Siberiancultures. She continues:Its structure provides an organizing principle for the mythologyand a map of the cosmos which can be used for journeying. Itsform is convenient for visualization; it can be circled to explorethe four elemental worlds attached to the Mid-world, climbedto reach the world of the light-elves (devic forces) and Asgard,home of the gods. Beneath its arching roots lie the entrances tothe world of the Dark Elves and the road to the Underworld.For Hrafnar, the Tree is central, and the starting point for themajor journey. Those who prefer a less formal approach to the seidrjourney also use the Tree as a focal point.

I quote part of Paxson’sexplanatory materials, here, to give a sense of how this is presented(note that this is not a script for the meditation journey).The entrance to the Underworld lies to the north, where primalice and fire met to produce the mists of Niflheim. There,beneath the level of Midgard, lies the well called Hvergelmir,the boiling cauldron, source of the river Gjöll (roaring,resounding). Here, perhaps is also where we encounter the dogGarm, who must be fed before the traveller can continue on.Below the level of Midgard we pass first through Svartalfheim,the home of the dark elves, or dwarves, which can also beinterpreted as the personal unconscious, populated by theshadows of one’s past. This world is also a source ofknowledge, but when we are journeying for others, we seek thechthonic depths, home of the ancestors.The river plunges downward, but the path circles to the east,passing through the Ironwood where wolves roam... Here risethe roots of the moist mountains of Jotunheim. The river Slithblocks the path, its lead colored waters rushing down to join thehidden Gjöll. Swords, spears, and all kinds of weapons aretumbled along in its torrent. Fortunately a bridge allows thetraveller to cross....The traveller passes through the outskirts of Myrkwood,which bars the way to Muspelheim, the realm of fire. Here,perhaps, the path is crossed by the river of blood whichThomas the Rhymer encountered on his journey to Faerie, fedby all the blood shed on earth, which rises to the traveller’sknee.... But still the road leads around and downward, until thethundering of another river is heard, that of the Thund Thvitr(Thunderflood), which cascades down from the heights ofAsgardr. Only Thor can wade that river...... Louder and louder resounds the roar of the river Gjöll,rushing through a deep chasm. As the path winds down, a stonebuilding, perhaps a tower, can be seen at the edge. From itsdoor comes a Jotun maiden, Modgudh, who bars the way withher spear. In order to pass, the traveller must state his or herpurpose in travelling to the Underworld.40 The Greenland Seeress"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"From the brink of the abyss a bridge arches to the other side,bright as the gleam of a sword. The air above it glitters as if itwere thatched with gold. If this is indeed a sword bridge, it willgrow broader if the traveller crosses without fear, but narrow toa cutting edge if he is afraid. On the other side of the river awall surrounds Hella’s realm. To the east the air seems bright;to the west, dark and gloomy.The seeker moves around to the eastern gate, from whichOdin summoned the Vœlva. Hemlock grows here, even when itis winter in the world. A slain cock thrown over the wall will flyup alive on the other side. Of the land beyond the gate we knowonly that it holds the Vœlva’s gravemound, Hella’s hall,Eljudhnir, and Na-strond, the Corpse-strand, whose walls arewoven of serpents whose venom floods the floor. It is there thatthe oath-breakers and murderers must dwell. I suspect thatHella’s hall is in the middle, and that like the goddess herself, itis half bright and fair and half in gloomy shadow. Some of thedescriptions of Hel are forbidding indeed, but when Hermodsought Baldr there, he saw him feasting in splendor.(Paxson, in prep.)The importance of the journey to the seeress may be different. Thetraining material suggests that by providing symbols and imagesthat stem from the Norse literature, it increases the possibility thatthe ‘original material’ that follows, the visions of the seeress and herdescription of these, will be also within ‘the same stratum of thecollective unconscious,’ the imagery of the North. The meditation,then, becomes a way in which the subsequent seeings are embeddedin cultural/cosmological awareness.The descriptions come from an assiduous search in, andfamiliarity with, the literature, especially the Poeticand ProseEddas, Saxo’s Gesta Danorum, and relevant modern commentariessuch as The Road to Hel(Ellis 1968) and Gods and Myths ofNorthern Europe(Davidson 1964/1990). Part is from those poems ofthe Poetic Eddathat give cosmological description:Grímnismál(thesayings of Grímnir) tells of Hvergelmír, source of all waters, ofThund, or the ‘thunderflood’, and of the concept of rivers flowingfrom Asgardto Hel. The same poem speaks of the three roots ofYggdrasill, Hel lying under one. From Völuspácomes the dog Garmwho guards the way to Hela’s realm: Ódinn meets him also in thepoem Baldrsdraumr(Baldr’s dreams), as he rides to Hel to raise aThe Greenland Seeress 41"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"dead Völva, to learn the meaning of the dreams of his son. Theechoing bridge and the giant maiden Modgudr come from Snorri’saccount (in his Edda) of Hermod’s ride to Hel’s hall after the deathof Baldr. The details of the hemlock, and the crowing cock, comefrom descriptions in Saxo Grammaticus’ account of the visit of thehero Hadingus to the otherworld. Other details are from folklore.This guided meditation or ‘pathworking’, however, has beenmuch debated within the community of Heathen seidworkers. Tosome, it appears to slant the seidr ritual in the direction of present-day neo-pagan practice, where ‘pathworkings’ are more familiar: acriticism is that the audience members are not ‘really’ journeying, asthe imagery is provided for them. One practitioner, Yngona,commented that pathworkings are training exercises connected with‘the journey within’: if someone is ‘really there’ in the otherworld,what they will see will not be the pathworking.The route above seems far too circuitous. If I wish to gosomewhere then I simply GO. I indeed utilize Yggdrasil as the‘ladder’ it is. Descending both up & down (so to speak), but allthis other rigmarole is fluff. Again, in my opinion. . . When youare really, truly in the other planes you will see things that youcannot describe. When we apply paths, tunnels and shrubs andsuch we are merely applying what our mind feels it needs tocope with a world not defined by time, space or events. Whenwe break free from these restraints, for indeed they are, ourVisions become more clear and our journey more profound.The Hrafnar seeress Raudhildr replied:There is a part of the human mind that from time to time needsto be distracted so it does not interfere with the work at hand.The journey ‘persuades’ that part of the ‘busy mind’ that a‘real’ thing is happening and that one needs to pay attention. . .Another reason Hrafnar does the long journey is because ofwhere we offer seid. It gives context and spirit worldview tonon-Asatruar or new folk who are not as well read. Anotherreason to do it this way has been that some folk go into trancemore slowly than others. Those who go into trance quickly tendto not recall the long version of the journey, just that they arewhere they need to be.Is this the sort of answer you wanted? Forgive the humor inthis, but, would you know more?(From email discussion of seidr, 1999)42 The Greenland Seeress"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Much of this discussion may have arisen from a perception that thepathworking is a way of inducing ecstatic trance in the seer: itsprimary purpose however appears to me to be for the audience,particularly where, as Raudhild says, this audience is not familiarwith the cosmology.Neo-shamanistic practitioners, constructing the seidr within asetting in which all present are used to working shamanically, usesinging, not pathworking, as a means of allowing a more generalaccess to an ecstatic state, as do some Heathen groups. However,among those practitioners that I have met, there is a generalacceptance that people will reconstruct the seidr in their own way,and that the Hrafnar version with its elaborate meditation performsa different function from the seidr trances described by Lindquist(1997).I turn, therefore, to seidr as described by other shamanicpractitioners.Neo-shamanistic seidrLindquist gives a detailed account of today’s ‘seid’ in Sweden,4asconducted by the neo-shamanistic group known as ‘Yggdrasil’,and something of its history: beginning as an idea about ‘Nordicshamanism’ and resulting in research by practitioners which ledthem to the Greenland seeress. In her description, seid appearsfirst as a means, for its practitioners, of focusing spirit power andinfluencing events, with a specific example of the rescue of theHansta woods from developers. Several people may take theirplaces, in turn, on the seidhjälle, each völva (female or male)stating an intention at the outset, for instance; ‘I seid for all thewoods on the Earth, and especially for the Hansta woods’(Lindquist 1997: 139). She or he undertakes an ecstatic journeyand speaks with spirits or deities, towards the stated purpose. Onreturn, the völva may or may not make statements about theirjourney. Lindquist terms this ‘instrumental seid’, made for apurpose.‘Research seid’ is taken similarly, though in quest of informationof the past rather than to effect change. Lindquist also discussesseid for divination, and for personal counselling. In all cases theoutline of the ritual is the same. The seid begins with the völvaseated on a high platform, the seidhjälle, holding her staff betweenher legs as if riding it. Others in the circle drum and sing seid songs,while the seeress journeys, with a specific question in mind orThe Greenland Seeress 43"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"generally to seek knowledge from present, past or future. The völvaraises her staff to indicate when she is ready to speak, and describeswhat she has seen. The others then drum her back. In counsellingseid the focus is to answer the specific questions of individuals inthe circle. When the seer raises his staff, members of the circle taketheir places before him, one after the other, each asking what hasbeen seen for them. (It should be noted that since the time ofGalina’s description, practices have developed further (Høst, pers.com.)Within Britain, some shamanistic practitioners (with initial linksto Harner’s ‘core-shamanism’) have been learning seid, under theguidance of Danish seidworker Annette Høst, who first madecontact with seidr through the Swedish ‘Yggdrasil’ network. Agroup member produces the newsletter Spirit Talk, of which theissue dated Early Summer 1999 (Kelly 1999a) was devoted toseid/seidr. Here, and in a more detailed account in an academicconference volume (Høst, forthcoming) Høst describes her basicseidr ritual: basically similar to that of Yggdrasil, but drawing onher own study of the sources in the literature.The volva sits on the high seat holding onto her staff,surrounded by a circle of singers. The sound carries the volvainto an altered state of awareness, into the spirit world. Thereshe meets with spirits, gods and forces, and puts forward herrequest for help or knowledge. When her main task iscompleted and the song dies out, and volva is still ‘between theworlds’ and in this state she can give oracular answers toquestions from members of the group.(Kelly 1999b)From this, and from a discussion with Annette Høst, David Scottand Karen Kelly, divergences between this modern Europeanshamanism model and Hrafnar’s oracular seidr become moreplainly located within the orientation of practitioners and,particularly, their sense of what the seidr is planned to do. Davidand Karen participated in a demonstration of the Hrafnar version,conducted by Diana Paxson in London, which they foundinteresting though somewhat disorienting in its differences. Karenpointed out that for her group of ‘shamanically experienced’ people– in the sense that all present have quite extensive acquaintance withworking shamanically – doing a guided meditation to the gates of44 The Greenland Seeress"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Hela’s realm, with the expectation of gaining a light trance state butnot necessarily remaining in this, was much less ‘ecstatic’ as anexperience than being part of a singing circle accompanying theseeress into a trance state and remaining there throughout theritual. They find the Hrafnar ritual more formal, more highlystructured, but appreciate its suitability with a large group wheresome may have little previous experience with shamanistictechnique. In the Hrafnar version, not all practitioners use the staffwhile in the high seat.. They found the lack of a staff strange,though David pointed out that in the Hrafnar version, a personstands behind the seeress, ‘shadowing’ her and giving emotional andenergy ‘support’ (and occasionally physical support if needed). Hehad taken this role, and considered himself to have been acting ‘likethe staff ’, becoming a channel for the energy that carries the seeressthrough the ecstatic journey.There are other differences of implication and approach,concerning the meaning of the term ‘seidr’. Whereas the Hrafnarversion focuses on the cosmology of the Nine Worlds, the Well ofthe Norns and the tree Yggdrasill, and includes invocations toÓdinn and Freyja, other shamanistic versions have less specificity,most practitioners assuming a more general ‘neo-shamanic’approach to the upper, middle and lower worlds though drawing onfamiliarity with Nordic mythology and cosmology. However, forthose practitioners who have grown up with the mythology of theNorth, or who have studied the literature extensively, this may notmake a difference: for many of the European practitioners, it seemsthat the cosmological framework is there, whether or not deities areinvoked – a cosmology rooted in the sense of the land and its spirits,and of the tree Yggdrasill. Likewise, when Heathens work in smallgroups, no guided meditation may be used: the cosmologicalframework is simply there, as it is when one individual ‘sees’ forherself or on behalf of another. Invocations may be to landspiritsand to one’s fylgia or animal ally rather than to deities; indeed theremay be no formal ‘invocation’ but simply chanting in which namesfrom the mythology are used.For practitioners whose consciousness is not rooted in thecosmology of the Well, the Norns and the tree Yggdrasill, though,there may be a substantial difference in meaning and implication, sothat ‘seidr’ (however undertaken) becomes but one more way tocontact ‘the spirits’.Some shamanistic practitioners may use the term ‘seid’ to referThe Greenland Seeress 45"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"specifically to an ecstatic experience involving song, staff and highseat. Conversely, Heathens tend to use the term ‘seidr’ for anyshamanistic practice conducted within Heathenism, that is withinthe cosmology of the Norns, the Well and the Tree. Healing, seeing,or engaging with Wyrd, accomplished within an ecstatic trance istherefore ‘seidr’, and outsitting or útiseta(described in the nextchapter) is equally ‘seidr’, because of the mythological embedding,the cosmological focus. For the European practitioners associatedwith Høst (and many Heathens practising in Britain and Europe),embedding likewise results from drawing on powers of earth andnature spirits associated with the land, and this sense ofembeddedness – be it based in cosmology or nature – returns us tothe words of Bil, quoted in the last chapter:Everything that I do, think, say, perceive, or whatever is passedthrough that belief system. And because it is filtered throughthat system, everything I practice is authentic.(Linzie 1995: 17)In order to further appreciate these practices of seidr, it isnecessary to turn to a consideration of seidr as shamanic orshamanistic practice, definitions of shamanism, and contestedinterpretations of the descriptions of the old literature; to conceptsof what or who are these ‘spirits’; and to the means by which peoplemight approach them, today or in the past, and this I do in the nextchapter.46 The Greenland Seeress"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Approaching the spiritsThe seer/ess as shamanistic practitionerIn this chapter I intend to introduce some theorising of‘shamanism’ as engagement between practitioner and spirits,emphasising the ‘reality’ of spirits to the participant and hence theneed to ‘take spirits seriously’. It should be stated at once thatNorse culture of 1,000 years ago was not obviously ‘shamanic’ inthe sense in which Tungus or Sámi or Déné culture is said to be orhave been shamanic: the sense in which Guédon says that ‘Shama-nism permeates all of Nabesna culture: the worldview, the subsistencepatterns, and the life cycles’ (Guédon 1994). In the saga descriptionswe find neither a reliance on a shamanic worldview nor a ‘shamaniccomplex’ of activities; no ‘shaman’ is described as central tocommunity life. There are kings and queens and battle-leaders,godar associated with different deities, and in Iceland the emergenceof a representative system of godar, as regional administrators, co-ordinated by a ‘lawspeaker’ – and no shamans, only occasionalseidworkers and other magic practitioners. Yet there are occasions –particularly in times of trouble or famine – where these seidworkersbecome important, as in the episode of the Greenland Seeress.What does this mean for interpretation of the cultures describedin the old material? Particularly, what does it imply for today’spractitioners, in terms of their constructions of meaning?A possible conclusion is that oracular seidr and other magicalpractices may represent rather scattered remnants of shamanistictechniques in Norse culture, related to the shamanic practices ofother cultures, notably the Sámi (e.g. Dubois 1999), though notnecessarily derived from Sámi practice (Hultkrantz 1992), andindeed this is where I began my inquiry as to the existence ofshamanic versus shamanistic traits in Old Norse society (BlainChapter 4"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"1999). Grundy points out (1995: 220) that ‘The only figures inGermanic culture which we can point to as bearing significantresemblance to the “professional shaman” ...are the seeresses whooccupy a position of respect based on their visionary capabilities’though they do not demonstrate other shamanic techniques oractivities. The seeresses often are said to have been trained by ‘theFinns’, which probably refers to the nomadic Sámi. Sámi shaman-ism has been described in Scandinavian accounts at least since thetwelfth century, and up to the present day (Pentikäinen 1984).This question of ‘seidworker’ or ‘shaman’ connects withquestions of what ‘shamanism’ is and how it can be used, as aconcept, to explain or assist understanding of cultural manifest-ations such as seidr or out-sitting: and how far the term‘shamanism’ can be used of people’s ecstatic practices in today’sWestern world. The term and its use have a history, discussed forinstance by Flaherty (1992), and Pentikäinen (1998). ‘Shaman’ wasinitially specific to Tungus/Evenki speaking peoples: from explorer’saccounts, ‘shamanism’ was constructed, generalised and univer-salised into a Westernism (Wallis 1999a), an abstraction coined toexplain aspects of religious and spiritual practice of ‘other people’,in societies as different from the defining Westerners as possible. Inshort, the term has been a Western way of ‘othering’, exoticisingand decontextualising specific spiritual/religious/magical practices.Attempted precise definitions of ‘shamanism’ range fromEliade’s (1964), of soul flight to an upper world, to Jakobsen’s(1999), of mastery of spirits. These definitions, to my mind, missessential components of what shamans do: social dimensions ofpractice (Oosten 1984). Shamans work within communities, andwhat they do, spatially, geographically and politically located,changes over time and with changing circumstances. Yetconventional views, whether within academia or the popular cultureof the ‘new age’, are of shamanism as somehow ‘timeless’ or‘primordial’ (as Greene (1998) points out), with the shaman as arepository of unchanging magical practice, close to ‘nature’ and theanimals. A different kind of understanding may be gained byviewing shamans, and their shamanisms, in context, in particulartimes and particular (socio-spiritual, economic, geographical andclimatic) landscapes, as political beings engaged in forming andmaintaining relationships with other members of their specificcommunities, both human and non-human: with their activitiessupported by the community (Blain and Wallis 2000). For example,48 Approaching the spirits"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"in the regeneration of Buryat shamanism, ‘the determinants oflocale and kinship establish the specific connection to nature and tothe particular efficacious spirits’ (Fridman 1999: 45). However, thereluctance of contemporary Western scholarship to take magic, orspirits, seriously (Tambiah 1990) may be reflected in what Dowson(1996) and Wallis (1999b) call ‘shamanophobia’ – to which Wallisadds ‘neo-shamanophobia’ – within academia.In attempting to understand seidr I prefer to approach‘shamanism’ as indicating the construction of specific relations ofnegotiation and mediation, achieved through techniques of trance –ecstasy attained by otherworldly experience – embedded in specificsocial relations and cultural settings. Thus the trance both emergesfrom and partly constitutes socio-political relations within thecommunity. A particular ‘shamanism’ becomes a specific expres-sion of community and identity (see e.g. Pentikäinnen (1994), oncircumpolar shamanism as identity), while simultaneously impli-cated in processes of cultural/political change through the agency of‘shamans’ and others within the community. I take, therefore, adynamic approach to ‘shamanism’, which here becomes a conveni-ent way to describe specific ecstatic practices, supported by thecommunity and on its behalf, together with the specific culturalsupport for such activities.The Old Norse material becomes particularly interesting,however, because shamanistic activity is notsupported by the entirecommunity: it is contested on a number of levels (Blain and Wallis2000). Here it may be useful to remember processes of changewithin the period described by the sagas: expansion of trade links,centralisation, Christianisation, the settlement of Iceland, amongothers. Conceivably, in some communities, in some periods aseidworker didhold a position not so dissimilar to that of a Sámishaman. Rather than saying that there was one unified ‘Norse’culture, it may be more helpful to examine instances – told longafter the occurrences they purport to describe – in terms of howthey reflect shamanistic techniques elsewhere, how these techniquesmay have been embedded in community practice, and how theirdefinition may have been contested, in past and present. That is:understandings of ‘seidr’ (or for that matter of Sámi shamanism)were likely to have varied from one person to another, onecommunity to another, one time to another, and some clues to thediversity of those understandings may be held in the stories thatwere told by the saga writers.Approaching the spirits 49"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"How far, therefore, do or did these seeresses, and seers, work‘shamanically’, according to this more dynamic approach to‘shamanism’?Seeresses enter again and again into the Icelandic poems andsagas. Katherine Morris (1991) has catalogued some of theiractivities. For instance:Heid, the sibyl ofHrólfs saga Kraka3, was also treatedhospitably and then asked to prophesy... King Frodi asked herto make use of her talents, prepared a feast for her, and set heron platform for her spell-making. She then opened her mouth,yawned, cast a spell and chanted a verse...(Morris 1991: 45)Pórdís, the seeress ofKormáks sagaand Vatnsdæla saga,was‘held in great esteem and knew many things’, and the hill behind herdwelling was named after her, Spákonufell, the mountain of theseeress. These women, and others, such as Oddbjörg ofVíga-Glúmssaga, Kjannok ofHeidarvíga saga, Heimlaug ofGull-Póris saga,arewoven into the fabric of the family sagas, the stories of everydaylife, written by Icelanders two or three hundred years afterChristianisation to tell of the lives of their ancestors who settled thecountry. Some details of these women are given in chapter 6. Theycan be seen as semi-historic; they, and others like them, lived andhad their being within a cultural framework in which trance, magicand prophesy were possibilities for women: to the extent that in thelater legendary sagas and short stories (told for entertainmentvalue), the seeing-women appear once again.Thus, in the Tale (páttr) of Norna-Gest, it is told that three wisewomen came to the house of Norna-Gest’s parents, at his birth, andforetold his future: a lack of attention to the youngest norn causedher to attempt to countermand the great prophesies of her elders,stating that the boy’s life would be no longer than that of the candleburning beside him. The eldest norn extinguished the candle andgave it to the boy’s mother to preserve. Three hundred years later, sogoes the story, Norna-Gest related his story to the king of Norway,accepted Christian baptism, and had the candle lit, dying as theflame expired. Arrow-Odd, the hero ofÖrvar-odds saga, likewisehad an extended life, of 300 years, and both this life and the strangedeath that ended it were predicted by a seidkona known as Heidr.The implication is that the prediction of the death is in some way50 Approaching the spirits"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"adverse to Arrow-Odd, and indeed it occurs through his (muchearlier) attempts to circumvent it.Seeing might be only one component of what one who wasfjölkunnigr– possessing much knowledge – could do. The accountsrefer to people who change shape, to avoid enemies, to seekknowledge, or to cause trouble. In sagas and later folktales, peoplewould discover that their problems were associated with theappearance of a particular animal. When this animal was woundedor killed, a woman would have a similar wound. In the Saga ofKormák the Skáld, when Kormák and his brother set off in a ship, awalrus appears close by. Kormák aims a spear at it, striking it, andit disappears. The walrus had the eyes of the woman Porveig,described in the saga as fjölkunnig.‘Póttust menn par kenna auguPórveigar.’1Reportedly,Porveig died from this spear-wound.At other times the metamorphosis was made for protection, as inaccounts of swan-maidens who guarded chosen warriors. Theshapeshifter is hamhleypa, one who is hamramr, shape-strong.Another example from Kormáks sagais Vigi, who is bothfjölkunnigrand hamramr; he sleeps by the door of the hall, andknows the business of everyone who enters or leaves.In the old material there is no overall word for ‘shaman’, butmany words for components of shamanic practice. This mayindicate that by the time of the composition of the sagas, twohundred years post-Christianisation, the practices were in decline.Alternatively, it may suggest that the specific components ofshamanic/ecstatic practice were widespread, general knowledgewithin the community, with individuals having their ownspecialisations of practice. What people were called depended noton the techniques they engaged in, but their relations with others inthe community. If these relations were bad, a woman was fordæda,aword implying one who performed evil magic. Where relations weregood, we have the spae-woman. (In Scotland, the term spae-wifeisstill used today.)So, seidr-related practices are described, in the Icelandicliterature, as relating to individual skills, but their practitioners arenamed according to their relations with others in the community.Seidr was not simple, and not necessarily either ‘good’ or ‘evil’, butwas in some sense woven into the daily life of practitioners andthose they worked for. In the stories the episodes deal mostly withindividual seidworkers and individual clients. There are, however,exceptions.Approaching the spirits 51"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"In one case we have a woman awarded a name within thosecommunities she visited:Purídr sundafyllir, ‘Thurid sound-filler’,who according to the Book of Settlementsgained her name bycalling fish into the sound, by means of seidr, thereby providingprosperity for the people. Borovsky (1999) points out that thisinstance and that of the Greenland Seeress hold an association withfertility or prosperity, and she speculates that practitioners usedseidr techniques, calling the spirits, to actively accomplish thisfertility by bringing the components ofinnangardand útangard–approximately settlement and wildness, deities and giants, knowableand unknowable – back into balance within the communities. Ifso, these are examples of seidr as active magic, involving spiritsand ecstatic practice for community benefit and with communitysupport: that is, potentially ‘shamanic’ in the dynamic, community-based sense referred to above. Several of today’s practitioners,including Raudhildr, Jordsvin and Susan, have speculated likewise:it ‘fits’ with their practices today.References to seidr, therefore, are plentiful but fragmented. Theydo not form a manual for practice. Yet from this fragmentation,today’s practitioners work to construct seidr, not as an individualtechnique in itself, but as part of a developing complex of beliefsabout soul and self, person and community, within communityrelationships that involve people with other beings, wights of landand sea or stream, deities known to Heathens as their ‘Elder Kin’.All these beings form part of the fabric of Wyrd, the destiny whichpeople and deities make together, woven by the Norns, Urd,Ve rdandi and Skuld, who are invoked within Hrafnar’s seidr ritual,as they sit by Urdarbrunnr,Urd’s Well, at the root of the AshYggdrasill.Seidworkers have the task of contacting these beings, negotiatingwith them, linking together these multiple communities through theuse of altered-consciousness states. How they do this, and who theymeet with, we shall see.Attaining tranceA word about ways of attaining trance or altered-consciousnessstates is in order. As mentioned above, Hrafnar’s oracular seidrutilises both drumming and singing, the journey meditation mayalso provide a way into trance states, and the repetitive nature of the52 Approaching the spirits"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"pattern of question and answer may help sustain the focused trancestate in the seer/ess. This is not the only mechanism for attainingtrance, or the only ones used by Heathen seidworkers. Whether fororacular seidr or in other forms, some practitioners use forms ofgaldr or rune-chanting; many have their own ‘shamanic songs’ thatthey have received (or composed) in trance and use to attain,deepen, or work within ecstatic states; some use rattles or otherinstruments, others dance, and of course many combinations ofthose methods are possible, and means of attainment will bevariedto suit circumstances and surroundings. Harner-based neo-sham-anism, though, tends to privilege the drum above other methods(for discussion see Wallis, forthcoming, b).Within ‘traditional’ shamanisms or contexts of altering conscious-ness a number ofother methods are described. These are notnecessarily ways into the trance: in Sámi shamanism, drum andchant may be a vehicle for travel within the otherworlds. Shamanismsdescribed within Eurasian contexts include use of a number ofstring and wind instruments (see e.g. Basilov 1997). Other methodsof achieving or assisting trance states include use of consciousness-altering substances such as alcohol, cannabis, and ergot (Clavicepspurpurea) in Eurasian contexts, or tobacco, peyote, psilocybin mush-rooms (Psilocybeand Strophariaspp.), ayahuasca/yajé (Banisteriopsisspp.) and a variety of other plants in the Western hemisphere (seee.g. Ripinsky-Naxon 1993; Schultes and Hoffman 1992). Withinseidr practice whether in the past or today, a number of these maybe relevant. First, however, a word about the use of entheogenswithin neo-shamanisms generally.Despite Harner’s early engagement with specific consciousness-altering substances, notably ayahausca and (terrifyingly, by hisaccount on pp. 14–16) maikua, a species of datura, as described inThe Way of the Shaman(Harner 1980), core-shamanism’s methodsdo not usually include use of entheogens. Harner states:Shamans have to be able to journey back and forth betweenrealities. To do this, in some cultures, shamans takemindaltering substances; but in many other cultures they donot. In fact, some psychoactive materials can interfere with theconcentration shamanic work demands.(1980: 44)and elsewhere comments that in his own research,Approaching the spirits 53"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"from (various North American Native groups) I learned howshamanism could be practiced successfully without the use ofthe ayahuascaor other drugs of the Conibo and the Jivaro.(1980: 19)Opinion on use of entheogens is divided among neo-shamanicpractitioners, and may emerge, heatedly, as disagreements over whatis or is not ‘real’ shamanism. However, a number of other writersaccept that entheogens have uses, for instance practising shamanGordon MacLellan.The use of mind-altering, usually plant-derived, drugs has beenone of the most widely promoted traditional shamanicpractices and, alongside drums and rattles, seems to be anexpected part of every shaman’s repertoire... ‘Teacher plant’ is atitle given in some traditional cultures to certain plants whichare recognised as being especially effective agents for inducingtrance and for taking a shaman on powerful journeys...Theteacher plants are very powerful, and the drugs that are derivedfrom their extracts open routes into Otherworlds that may bewildly different from those entered by other means. Theseworlds are full of colour and changing perspectives, deeplysurreal experiences and, at times, numbing horrors... in thehands of an experienced shaman, the teacher plants themselveswill meet the traveller and through their influence she willencounter spirits rarely met elsewhere and experience a world ofawareness and consciousness far in excess of the basic chemicalinfluences.(MacLellan 1999: 45–6)So, some of today’s neo-shamans make use of ‘psychoactive’substances, in addition to drumming, rattling, chanting, music,dancing, etc. Complexities arise, however, in the ways in whichentheogen use, more than any other method, is politically contestedwithin Western societies. It is noteworthy that those neo-shamanic‘best-sellers’, the ‘shamanovels’ (I borrow the term from Noel 1997)of Casteneda, in the psychedelic 1960s described entheogen use, butby 1972 Casteneda’s teachers promoted ways to get there withoutusing ‘drugs’: as Wallis says, ‘again nicely timed for a post-psychedelic audience’ (Wallis 1999b: 35). Harner’s espousal of anentheogen-free neo-shamanism seems to me likewise to relate to54 Approaching the spirits"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"prevailing tendencies within the mostly US context of theFoundation for Shamanic Studies, and the time of the ‘war ondrugs’.Where does this leave today’s seidr practitioners? The mostrelevant substance for seidr practice in the past would appear to beAmanita muscaria, uses of which in Siberian shamanisms have beenattested by a variety of writers (see e.g. Basilov 1997; Eliade 1964;Wasson 1971). While there can be no direct claim for use, there havebeen speculations that A. muscaria-induced trance has featuressimilar to trance states described in sagas, notably the ability of theLawspeaker, Thorgeir, to remain ‘under the cloak’ in what isapparently a trance state for a very long period of time (asdescribed later in this chapter). The sagas, however, do not mentionany entheogens in any context that I can discover: the special mealprepared for the seeress in Eiríks saga raudais of the hearts ofanimals and is eaten the night before her seidr is to occur.References to drinking in the Eddas (e.g. Mimir’s well, the mead ofpoetry) are ambiguously metaphorical at best (though in a highlyspeculative mode, Steven Leto (2000) suggests that the use of bothA. muscariaand P. semilanceatamay be represented metaphoricallyin various poems or sagas). Archaeology, however, gives someevidence, from several hundred henbane seeds found in the pouch ofa burial considered to be that of a seeress (Price, pers. com.) and avery small number of cannabis seeds present in the Oseberg burial(often considered to be that of a seeress or a priestess), carefullyplaced, Neil Price tells me, between the cushions and feathers piledby the bed.2This should be seen in context.A. muscariawas (and is today)used by Siberian shamans, and a variety of other plants which aretoday recognised as psychoactive do and did grow in NorthernEurope and may have been known and used shamanically from verylong before the period of seidr (remembering that that designationcovers a wide area, and that the period of time in which seidr mighthave its roots is indeed long).3These include the rather dangerousnightshade family members henbane (Hyoscyamus niger) anddeadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna), and fungi including ergot(Claviceps purpurea, found apparently in the stomach of the IronAge ‘Grauballe Man’ in Denmark), and ‘liberty caps’ (Psilocybesemilanceata); there may be evidence of use of hemp in theEuropean ‘Celtic’ Iron Age (Green 1996); and other plants that mayhave mildly psychoactive effects include artemisias such as worm-Approaching the spirits 55"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"wood and mugwort. (While the activity of the last is very mild ifindeed there at all, at least it has some claim to status as a ‘sacred’herb within Anglo-Saxon magical/healing practice, for instance inthe ‘Nine Herbs Charm’ (Rodriguez 1993: 136) and numerouscommentators, notably Leary (1968; Leary, Metzner and Allpert1964/1983) have pointed to the importance of cultural/psychologicalassumptions or ‘set’ in evaluating the effects of mind-alteringsubstances.)The foregoing should indicate that both psychoactivity ofsubstances, and the concepts of what are meant by ‘ecstatic’ or‘trance states’, are highly complex. Attempts to ‘measure’ the effectsof different methods of trance-induction (see e.g. Dronfield 1993,1995) may succeed in associating particular entoptic patterns withmeans of trance-induction, but they do not indicate what is possiblefor the ‘shamans’ to effect through the trance. Similarly (thoughnon-entheogenically), Goodman (1990, 1999) indicates patterns andsimilarities in altered consciousness visions described by volunteers,facilitated by the adoption of positions indicated in statuettes, cavepaintings, and other sources seen as ‘shamanic’, while listening to adrumbeat. Yet, while such attempts give insight into alteredconsciousness in Western naïve subjects, they do not indicate what a‘shaman’ may do with experiences so derived or how she or heinteracts with spirits. The Foundation for Shamanic Studiesdifferentiates between an ‘ordinary state of consciousness’ (OSC)and ‘shamanic state of consciousness’ (SSC), a distinction used inturn by Achterberg (1985) and others. But (as Achterberg indeedindicates) there are many states of consciousness that each of usgoes through in the course of a waking day – and in sleeping,dreaming, or ‘lucid dreaming’. Privileging one state as ‘shamanic’implies that this is what shamans do – but shamans may deliberatelyseek different states for different types of interaction with spirit andhuman worlds (and indeed much of their work may take placein a very clear-headed ‘everyday reality’). It seems to me that whatdistinguishes ‘shamanic’ from ‘shamanistic’ or ‘alternative’ prac-tices is that the ‘shaman’ works with these states, and withcultural/cosmological understandings of spirits met, to achievesomething – useful knowledge, diagnosis, healing, balance, a shift inperceptions of others, an alteration in Wyrd; not only a temporaryalteration in the practitioner’s perception.As already stated, there seems no direct evidence for the use ofany entheogens specifically in seidr or for trance-induction during56 Approaching the spirits"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"the saga period: yet it would seem highly unlikely (especially givencontacts with Sámi and other practitioners, and given that seedshave been found in appropriate contexts) that nopsychoactivesubstance would be used in any ‘Germanic’ area for trance purposes– the prime contenders, as implied above, being Amanita muscaria,henbane, hemp, ergot, and probably Psilocybe semilanceata. It isinteresting to note that while at least in the UK and much ofScandinavia (Leto, pers. com.) ‘toadstools’ (referring to almost anywild mushroom) have been regarded with extreme suspicion, thecolourful red-and-white fly agaric (A. muscaria) has been the subjectof much ambivalence, regarded as ‘poison’4yet in folkloreassociated with elves, and the subject of copious nineteenth- andtwentieth-century illustrations. The small, inconspicuous P.semilanceatahad by contrast apparently dropped out of sight andfolk-memory until the middle of the twentieth century, when thediscovery by Westerners of psilocybin mushrooms in Mexico led toa developing awareness of ‘magic mushrooms’ in Europe.An alternative etymology for the term ‘seidr’ relates it to ‘seethe’,and indeed one version of today’s seidr practice, in Norway andBritain, includes tein-seid, herb-seid. This is related more to healingherbalism than to shamanic use of entheogens, but is indicative ofan association with plants, and their preparation and use, bypractitioners or clients.Of today’s seid-practitioners, one describes his association withthe ‘Little Red Man’ (Amanita muscaria) in the website athttp://www.angelfire.com/nm/seidhman/luck.html (Linzie n.d.). Morecommon, though, is the attitude that ‘drugs’ are not appropriate:particularly within a US context. Certainly in oracular seidrsessions that I have attended, entheogens have not been in evidence(other than mead or beer used as an offering and for consumptionafter the ritual, not before). However, some seid-practitioners makeuse of entheogens in private ‘journeying’ or spirit contact, and forhealing-seidr and protection seidr, often in an attempt to determinecourses of action to follow, to give greater clarity to what can beseen and understood: these might be Psilocybemushrooms orcannabis, artemesias such as wormwood or mugwort, or sometimesA. muscaria. Some say they have ‘tried everything’, to find whatworks and to explore possibilities. It should be pointed out that (asMacLellan stresses), sacramental use of entheogens is not the sameas recreational use. ‘It’s not just dropping acid’, said a practitioner.Bil gave me a detailed account of his use: once again stressingApproaching the spirits 57"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"that these are spirits that he contacts to help him ‘make seidr’ anduse the seidr effectively.I make fairly extensive use of entheogens, in particular,Fliegepilz (amanita muscaria var. muscaria), toloache (daturainoxia), Johnson grass seed (stipa robusta) and several varietiesof artemisia (a. lucoviciana; a. franserioides). All of which arelegal. I use them to make seidh, both healing kind and theprotective kind. I don’t recommend them to anyone, personally.Their ghosts are of their own mind and they will often volunteertheir services. They will not be controlled, and toloache can bevery dangerous although the others don’t have the same person-ality that he does (which is fairly ruthless and occasionallybloodthirsty).I only deal with these because they came to me during theperiod when the spirits had me. They showed me where theygrow and how to use them (and still do). They make decisionsin many cases and possess skills that I don’t have. They can goplaces I’ve never heard of and can figure out things that I amunable to.Most (or many of these plant-ghosts) can be very seductive, Isuppose. I personally have never trusted any of them although Ifind the Fliegepilz to be friendly. All of them have a fairlyruthless side, though, including the Fliegepilz.When I make a seid, I work with a team of ghosts; differentsituations call for different team makeups. Inevitably, one of themembers, for me, will be one (or more) of these. They lendpower, control, intelligence, or clarity. They come together withothers and act through me to make changes here on thisMidgard. They maintain an interest here – their physical formsare here – but they are more like ghosts than plants. They arelike the blackmarketeers of the ghost world. They can makeshady deals, seem to know everyone, have their hands in every-one’s cookie jar and are master string-pullers and button pushers.I’ve definitely gotten into tight binds because of the way thatthey work, but they are thorough. They are able to make longrange plans far better than I. Sometimes, I’d rather not workwith them, but everytime I’ve tried that option there were trulylarge messes to clean up afterwards.I work with them because they were the ghosts who pickedme up when I was dying.

But while I live they are my staunchest comrades-in-arms.Finally, in god-possession seidr the Hrafnar group may find alcoholconsumption to be a component of the trance (Wallis 1999b), butalcohol is not generally used as a trance-producing substance,although it may be used as an offering in heathen rituals and thereis acknowledgement that it has the power to alter consciousness, notmerely through the usual effects of alcohol but through ritualblessing and through similarity to the ‘mead of poetry’ consumedby odinn and given by him to those people selected as poets.The description in the saga of Eirik the Red includes onesentence on the preparations the seeress needed to make. Theplatform is already built, with its cushion of hens’ feathers in place.The seeress’ costume has been described. She has yet to find thewoman to sing the song. We are told:En um morgininn at álidnum degi var henni veittr sáumbúningr sem hon purfti at hafa til at fremja seidinn.(Gordon 1957: 56)And the next day at sunset she made the preparations that sheneeded to carry out the seidr.What these preparations were, we do not know. Anything ispossible: adding items to her dress (which is another possiblereading of the sentence), lighting a smoke smudge, arranging thetorches, addressing her spirit guardians or deities, dancing, or eveningesting mushrooms. Nor are we likely ever to know.Seidr as evil magic?Of today’s practitioners, many follow the Hrafnar group or Bil inusing the word ‘seidr’ for what they do, whether they work ascommunity-diviners using oracular seidr, ‘sit out’ in quest of privateknowledge, work with spirits to make others ‘whole’, or otherwiseengage with Wyrd. Some prefer to use the term spá, well-attested inthe sagas for those who speak with foreknowledge. Thus Winifred isa spákona, Jordsvin a spámadr.Spá(or spae, as in the Scottish‘spaewife’) refers to foretelling, or prophesying. These words,spáand seidr, have differing implications within the old literature – thespákonaor spámadris spoken of with respect, for the most part,Approaching the spirits 59"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"whereas the seidkonaor seidmadris often regarded ambivalently.Seidr may imply not only trance-divination, but what Jordsvin calls‘messing with people’s minds’ (this is not, he emphasises, what hedoes, whatever people call it); or using shapeshifting to journey inthis world, not the spirit world, and use the knowledge gained tothe detriment of others, and influencing or affecting other people’sbehaviour by means of the journey.An example from the old literature is from Egils sagaSkallagrímssonar. Egill is in the power of his enemies, in York,England, attempting to write a poem which will save his life. Hecannot concentrate for the twittering of a swallow – all night long –by his window. His friend goes up onto the roof, and sees the birdflying off. The implication is that the bird is his arch-enemyGunnhildr – Queen at York, and later of Norway – who is striving(unsuccessfully, thanks to the friend’s intervention) to prevent hiscomposition and thereby cause his death. Various interpretations ofGunnhildr, and of ‘evil magic’ and ‘women’s magic’, will be furtherexplored in chapter 6.This leads to another important point about the old literature. Itdeals in seeresses and fordæda, female practitioners. Most accountsof seidr are of women. Male seidworkers of saga-times – in the late,Christian accounts that we have – were deemed to be ‘ergi’, un-masculine, possibly crossing gender barriers in ways not then accept-able. It is unclear at what time this negativity spread to includeseidkonur(seidr-women), or how the spread of Christianity affectedways in which seidr-workers were regarded.Another word, though, is útiseta, and this is how some men –including leaders, kings – are spoken of in the sagas as gainingknowledge,seta úti til fródleiks(sitting out for wisdom). A variantof this may be going ‘under the cloak’ as it is said did Thorgeirr thelawspeaker of the Icelandic Althing, prior to taking the decisionto have Iceland formally convert to Christianity (Blain, in press).Out-sitting is used by Heathens and neo-shamanists today, and itsdescription forms another piece of the puzzle within this chapter ofhow people ‘make seidr’, as part of the construction of Northernecstatic practice today.Under the cloakAs the story is told, one thousand years ago, the Icelanders were ina quandary. Some were adherents of the old religion,Heidnior60 Approaching the spirits"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Heathenry, while others had taken up the new religion ofChristianity, and there were external pressures, including economicsanctions and threats to people who were held hostage overseas,inclining the people towards the new religion. There was debate andargument before the Law Rock. In the twelfth century Ari Porgilssonwrote a description of the ‘conversion’, in his Islendingabók.5...the Christian people and the Heathen declared that theywould not live under each other’s laws, and they went away thenfrom the law-rock.Then the Christians asked Hall of Sída to declare the lawsfor the Christians to follow. But he declined, making a bargainwith Porgeirr the Lawspeaker that he should declare the law,being himself still Heathen. And when the people came to thebooths,6then Porgeirr lay down, and spread his cloak overhim, and he lay all day, and the night after, saying no word.And the next morning he sat up and called people to the law-rock.There he addressed them, when the people came, saying thatthis seemed to him a desperate condition, that the people andthe land be not under one law; and he related to the peoplemany things that they should not allow to come to pass, andsaid that such disturbances must happen, that it was to beexpected that such fights would arise between people that theland would be laid waste...To resolve the situation, therefore,Porgeirr went ‘under the cloak’,and his pronouncements when he emerged were adopted by bothsides. His solution was that the people and the land becomeofficially Christian, but that some Heathen points of law should beretained and that people’s religions, practised in their own houses,should be their own business.7The account does not reveal thesources ofPorgeir’s knowledge, though it indicates that the people,of both old and new religions, were inclined to take his word for it.Porgeirr speaks with authority and assurance, and his method ofgoing ‘under the cloak’ is accepted as a valid means of pursuingknowledge: and when he emerges, he speaks as though he has seenpossible futures. He appears to be engaging in a form of útiseta,‘sitting out for wisdom’. I find convincing Jón Adalsteinsson’s(1978) arguments that the account ofPorgeirr is comparable withdescriptions of others who clearly go ‘under the cloak’, and stayApproaching the spirits 61"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"there for extended times, for magical or divinatory purposes.Sometimes they are described as ‘muttering’, ‘mumbling’ or‘murmuring’ into the cloak. Adalsteinsson points out that:To mutter or murmur or mumble into one’s cloak thus means,as far as one can tell, to rehearse some kind of soothsaying.Those who practised this seemed by their conduct to be able tosee what was hidden to others and to gain information in asupernatural way. They appear to have pulled their cloaks overtheir heads merely to concentrate better on their task.(Adalsteinsson 1978: 113)Adalsteinsson sees Porgeir’s behaviour as more intense and longer-lasting: paralleling descriptions from Ireland and Scotland of theseer who would lie wrapped in a bull’s hide, for knowledge, otheraccounts from Iceland of those who lie still while their spirits traveland cause events to occur, and indeed the Heimskringladescriptionof Ódinn who lay as if ‘asleep or dead’ while his spirit journeyed,discussed in more detail in chapter 7.In the descriptions, the knowledge gained through sitting outwould be used by the out-sitter, or revealed at a later stage, ratherthan narrated in trance. Sitting out typically involved sitting on agravemound or at a crossroads, going under the cloak could bedone wherever one was, but both implied a distancing of oneselffrom the other human members of the community. The one whowas sitting out was not to be disturbed, and in particular their nameshould not be mentioned (Adalsteinsson 1978). Útiseta also becameproblematic, proscribed in Iceland in the laws of the thirteenthcentury, which remained in place until the nineteenth, in terms thatname ‘...fordæduskap ok spáfarar allar ok útiseta at vekja tröll uppok fremja heidni,’ ‘sorcery and spae-working (foretelling) and sittingout to wake up trolls and practising Heathenry’, a wording whichassociated útiseta with gaining knowledge from other beings orspirits (we can treat the term ‘trolls’ as a derogatory re-workingduring Christian times). Referring to this law, Hastrup commentsthat ‘By the act of sitting out, which was a metaphor for leaving theordinary social space, it was possible to invoke supernatural beings’.While the penalty was death, no-one was convicted until Iceland’ssmall witch-craze in the seventeenth century (Hastrup 1990: 391).As with seidr, members of today’s Heathen community areattempting to rediscover techniques of útiseta, seeing it as a solitary62 Approaching the spirits"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"practice, whereas oracular seidr is a community ritual.Men (and some women) appear also as practitioners of galdr, sungor spoken spells, which do not in themselves involve theshapeshifting, journeying or other shamanic/ecstatic components(and which together with knowledge of runes in the early modernperiod formed the basis of the few witchcraft accusations andconvictions in Iceland – Hastrup 1990). However, that men couldperform seidr is evident. In chapter 7 I discuss how the ninth-centuryNorwegian king Haraldr Finehair, and his son Eiríkr calledBloodaxe, were responsible for the death of Eirík’s brother Rögnvaldrrettilbeini,a seidmadr, and the troop of eighty seidmenn with whomhe was associated. Rather than representing a purely individualrelation between people and the spirit world, the practice of seidrand útiseta appears now associated with gender and with politicalpower, and these dimensions will be explored in subsequent chapters.Other, perhaps associated, political dimensions are evident alsoin today’s community, as will become apparent. However, manypeople are enthusiastic about the techniques, and about theirpotential for use in healing and alternative medicine, as well asdivination. They also see journeying and útiseta as a way to gainpersonal knowledge of the cosmology of the World Tree,Yggdrasill, and of deities and other wights, and so to explore thepossibilities of religion together with conceptions of self and spirit.Approaching the spiritsIt is important, here, to return to the idea of ‘the spirits’, evaluatingthem from the practitioners’ viewpoint – external, independent beingswho may (at times) assist but require to be negotiated with, cajoled,even fought. Political dimensions of seidr lie therefore in both‘everyday’ and ‘otherworld’ realities. Bil’s references to plant-ghosts,or helpers, as tricky, potentially dangerous, but assisting him as‘comrades in arms’, have been already noted. A return to thisdiscourse of the reality of spirits can indicate some of these ‘spirits’that may be met with, and the ways in which seid-people are calledon to interact with both human and spirit worlds, mediatingbetween these.‘Spirit beings’, therefore, may include ancestors, deities, plant oranimal ‘helpers’, but refers also to various others associated withplaces, people or practices, who may help or hinder. While these areoften ‘explained away’ (within psychology or anthropology ofApproaching the spirits 63"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"shamanism) as archetypes, fragments of the seer’s personality, orremembered or reconstituted cultural expectations, within contextsof active shamanistic accomplishment of meaning these beings aremet with as real, external entities who are not subject to the‘control’ of the seeress. (This is discussed as a possible associationfor the term ‘ergi’ by Blain and Wallis (2000), and will be furtherpursued in chapter 7.) Suffice it to say here that seers in tranceinteract with ‘spirits’, treat them as ‘real’, and that this spirit-realityis presented as one reason for the careful construction of oracularseidr, as will be discussed below.At times, seers seek spirits in quest of knowledge; at times, spiritsseek the seer. Often there are ‘ancestors’, and they may be helpful,interested, even approving or guiding. But spirits may be ‘there’ fortheir own purposes, at odds with those of the practitioner: diseasespirits, for instance, or those associated with other problems, thatmay move between ‘realities’ even as the seidworker does. Afterexperiencing strange, toothed ‘monsters’ (described in chapter 5) Iasked Bil’s advice.I’ve encountered the beasts you describe several times. Themouths and the size of the creatures are always different (unlessit’s one I’ve come across before). They vary greatly in bothlooks and personality. Some were not friendly disposed towardsme, some were filthy (carrying disease, I’m guessing), some wereenemies, and one lived in my house for a long time neverbothering me, but bothering people who slept over evenknocking one out of bed. My guess is that they are troll. Nevertravel with companions (that I’ve noted), large variety ofpersonality, never seen one in the daylight. Got into it with oneand came out ahead (but sick afterwards), been chased by afew. The one who lived in my house was fine (very protective ofthe family, but a minor thief on occasion – didn’t much likecompany over).Heathen seer Ybjrteir discusses incidents when spirits have beendifficult or dangerous. During an oracular seidr, a participant askeda question of an ancestor, who turned out to be ‘not a pleasant orgood wight’, came into Ybjrteir’s body and refused to leave. Theseer’s sprit helpers told him how to expel the invading presence fromhis spirit-body (indeed saying, ‘just shit it out!’) and so he learned away to deal with a hostile invasion. For this seer, seidr is not only64 Approaching the spirits"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"‘high seat’ but includes ‘trance and healing work’. He has methostile spirits during these forms of seidr also:I did a co-journey with someone that I thought was experienced... and she wondered why she was involved with a well. Duringthe journey I encountered one of the most frightening and Ibelieve dangerous creatures...I have no idea if it is any mythicalstory...but it was a white snake with yellow eyes and yellowmarkings...I immediately became nauseated and cold...when Icame out of the trance my hands and body were ice – PURPLE– my friends had to get me into a warm shower.Such are not the kinds of spirit-beings that practitioners hope tomeet, though this may be necessary to effect healing or protectiveseidr, or ‘deghosting’.Examples of very different spirit-beings have already been met.Some are immense, powerful, the Maurnir (female etins or giants)who ‘ate’ Raudhildr being a case in point. Raudhildr considers thereare things she can now do which directly result from that experienceof dismemberment and re-constitution (at the behest of Loki,another ‘spirit being’). She is, within her seidr community, soughtas one who has knowledge, skill, whose seidr practice and‘performance’works. She engages with Wyrd on behalf of thecommunity, and this is recognised.Those Maurnir are not lightly to be sought, and she has metthem only once since that time. But even spirits closer to thepractitioner can be difficult, dangerous, not entirely predictable, asshown by Bil’s multiple spirit-helpers. Indeed, only the seer’s fylgja –animal ally or personal spirit-helper – can be regarded as reliable.There are others who appear: beings who have knowledge,especially if a querant asks something relating to a deity. Much ofthe work that Winifred described to me, for instance, involvesdeities, and she becomes a mediator, conveying information toothers that is not intended for herself. Several seidfolk have reported‘god-possessory’ experiences, not necessarily having sought theseout. Ybjrteir described a situation in which god-possession wasunintentional, but appropriate:there was no expectation of it...someone just asked what Freyrwanted to teach him and Freyr stepped right in....it is as ifanother being has just comfortably sat down into your skinApproaching the spirits 65"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"with you...you are aware in the trance of them speakingthrough you and there is no fear, unlike the uncomfortablenessof the angry dead man’s spirit.

It was a niceside effect.Hrafnar’s god-possession experiences should be likewise described.These commenced, members told me, when, intending to celebratean academic achievement by having the achiever welcomed into aparty ‘as if ’ he were Ódinn (by quoting appropriate lines of Eddicpoetry) they found that the personality they were dealing with wasnot that of their friend: he was possessed by the god. Theyinvestigated rituals of possession (intending that this should occuragain only deliberately), drawing on practices from Umbanda –including learning that the gods often like ‘to party’, but that theone who is possessed should strike a ‘deal’ with the god beforeletting her or him ‘take over’, part of the bargain being that if thegod desires to drink or smoke, she or he should ‘take it with them’when leaving: which possessing entities seem to do. Duringpossession, the deity may give guidance to people within the room,as the mood takes her or him. A participant-observer’s descriptionof Hrafnar Odin-possession, reads thus:In effect, the possessed become the horse vehicle for the god. ...the possession ceremony, which lasts about one and a halfhours, follows a strict procedure. It begins with an explanationof what is going to happen, so that all persons present are fullyaware of the format, any dangers, and the responsibilityinvolved. Everyone is then purified with smouldering herbs,candles are lit and each person is blessed with appropriaterunes, in preparation for the journey. A horn of mead is passedaround and each participant makes a toast to Odin, givingeither informed consent in the wish to become a horse of Odinor passing the opportunity on this time. Singing then follows toinvoke the god, again based on Nordic sources. As they becomepossessed the participants pick up garments that have beenmade available to them and that are characteristic of Odin,including a wide brimmed hat, a cloak, and an eye patch torepresent his missing right eye.

His account further illustrates how practitioners see or meettheir spirits. He did not expect this experience.I have never thought that sort of thing would happen. I wasexpecting to meet Woden or have one of my helpers appear. Asit was they appeared well before then, and all of them weresupporting me on the wayHe described the seeress:And then you know the mound appeared, just this green turfedmound, very sort of – reminds me of a painting by Rousseau –just sort of very thereamongst this blackness and then therewas a tree there, yew tree there, and then the seeress comesout, and I could see in the distance, and it was definitely in thedistance, rather than very close, a hall, which was shimmeringgold-like as well. And the seeress appeared, and she wasdangerously thin (laughs) mainly because she’s dead I presume!But at the same time sort of wiry with it.

I found it difficult to get back to the gates, and it was veryappealing to stay behind, and as if she was sort of, Hel waspulling my legs, to keep me there, and I was kind of willing,really, for a while longer, so you know, a struggle to get back.From the seidworker’s perspective, this völva was not ‘called’ orinvoked, she was simply there, presumably (if one ‘takes the spiritsseriously’) for her own reasons. I discussed this experience throughemail with Raudhildr. She commented on her own experiences with‘The Völva’:She does things for her own reasons and becomes involved forher own purposes. The Maurnir sheltered her in their cave frombefore Ginnungagap for their reasons. She saw the worldcreated. She knows and doesn’t tell anyone, except maybe Vorthe necromancer of Frigga.She is also not above playing some pretty nasty tricks.I requested further explanation. Writing as if ‘in a seidr trance’, shetold me:There is a resurgence in the power of the Volva and the Maurnirto interpret creation to us again. But they have not moved with68 Approaching the spirits"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"us in the stream of our world and are still exacting the olderprice for services rendered. Does this make sense? It seems asthough I am typing in a seidh trance.They are the only ones who know the beginning of our story.Because we have no context for the end without the beginningwe are starting over. We will have to embrace the mysteries ofthe coming into being of the worlds through the lens of ourknowledge here and now before moving along the path of thereligion of the ancients to the never ending conclusions of theconfining of life in the parameters of understanding.This is why the Volva comes now, I see, she is safer toapproach than the four. She is ‘dead’ in the sense that she is acast-off garment, a face that no longer could speak to / interpretfor creation to the created.8A new face she wore, again, cast offfor another. Until that other was not the one to bridge the gapto the beginning, and was cast off in turn. One Dis, One spirit,interrupted ...Thus, mutually confounded by the world as it is in its presentface, we and she look again to the most primal face and beginat the beginning. Learning our letters, the runes, as keys to thecosmos; learning our numbers, the Norns as weavers of fate,taking our measure the goddesses and gods with guidance andoccasional counsel. Counting our fingers and toes and namingthem, meeting the wights and the mighty dead once more forthe first time. Learning to remember primal terrors so as to betaught survival and that fire is hot.And the resistance to seidhr arises again, because seidhrproves that we do not have the answers and that humankind isnot wise without ‘other’ and our fear of our own frailty makesus shun the practice just as it did our ‘ancient’ kin of faith, whowere beginning to know enough to be too proud to be seen notto know.The ‘spirits’ met with, then, encompass a wide range, in additionto the plant and animal ‘helpers’ previously encountered. Someappear closely connected with individual seidworkers, but othersseem to be involved with the re-awakening of seidr: they may havelong-term goals which do not necessarily coincide with those ofpractitioners or audience. Yet others are incidental, problematic,once again pursuing their own aims. All are, to the practitioners,very ‘real’. This interaction with the spirit world is something that isApproaching the spirits 69"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"taken account of in the construction of ‘ritual’ for today. As indicatedpreviously, Hrafnar have been challenged on why they involvepractitioners in a complicated ‘journey’ in their oracular seidr ritual.In an email discussion of seidr, Ra udhildr explained it thus:My reasoning for going to the spirits, rather than calling themto us is not grounded in anything but my darker self, mysuspicious nature and my mistrust of the behavior of otherhuman beings. This culture has no training or grounding inhow to respectfully treat the spirits that come. Forgive thisharshness, but I have seen a great, disrespectful stupidity inmany pagan communities, including our own.If the wights are offended it can damage the luck of theoffender for life. There are dozens of cases of this in folkloreand myth. My feelings about this are simple – Not on mywatch, never. Even if the individual does something to richlydeserve it. Not on my watch.If the wights are sufficiently angered, they can turn on theseer/ess as well. I will not willingly endanger my own luck, orthe luck of another seer or his/her well being. I will notendanger my own well being without profound need.I will not call spirits into a place where I do not know andtrust every single person. It is too easy for someone who has norespect for anybody else to find a way into a public seidh. If youdon’t think it is possible for problems like the ones I havementioned to pop up, then you have never been asked a trickquestion by a malicious soul, asked the exact same question bythe same questioner at the same event six years running (to therage of certain spirits who told me I was not allowed to answerit), nor have you had to watch your seer be asked to tell aquestioner what kind of ice cream he had for dinner.Did the ‘ancient heathens’ not have problems of having to mediatebetween wights and ‘stupid people’, she was asked? Not in the samesense, she replied, as there was an awareness of, and respect for the‘reality of spirits’.They had a culture of ‘faith’ that those raised in the modernworld lack. A respect that spirits could affect their world. . . . Ihave been in a space with a wight, normally kindly, who wasdisruptive and angry because of a single person in the space.70 Approaching the spirits"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Things fell down and broke when the individual entered. Whenthe individual left, everything was wonderful and peacefulagain. I immediately went and put down an offering as anapology for bringing the person into the wight’s space.Several people got sick right after that and had coughs thathung on weeks. Again a case of a kindly wight being dangerous.Whatever academics or other observers may think of their work,these seidworkers are themselves ‘taking spirits seriously’ and candiscuss their encounters in ways that make sense to other seidfolkelsewhere, who recognise the same beings in their own practice. Inunderstanding the meanings of seidr for its participants, it isnecessary to admit this reality, for them, as they undertake theseexperiences that appear so meaningful both for themselves and forthose of their communities who watch and listen, bring theirquestions, and evaluate those ‘seeings’ for their usefulness withintheir own lives.Seidr as contested practiceAs this and the previous chapter make plain, a direct equation ofseidr as shamanistic practice today with seidr of the past is notpossible. Today’s practices are being constructed from evidencewhich though not scanty, is rather patchy and incomplete,fragments scattered throughout the sagas and Eddic poems. Thenature of people’s relationship to seidr – as something specifically‘constructed’ consciously – implies that the processes may be betterdescribed as ‘neo-shamanistic’: not directly embedded in everyday-cultural understandings of the cosmology of the Nine Worlds or ofwhat seeresses do, a product of a ‘fact’-based knowledge that can bearticulated, rather than ‘habitus’ (see e.g. Vitebsky 1995a ondifferences between ‘neo-’ and ‘traditional’ shamanisms), though forsome practitioners cosmology and the everyday are becomingclosely interrelated. Questions arise about meaning and contest-ation, in both past and present. Dimensions of, and debates around,seidr give interesting examples of how discourses and competingdefinitions are played out, how people create their understandingsof self and community, self and spirit, within a context of spiritualtradition and today’s research. The construction and practice ofseidr show people actively involved with their lives and theiridentities; as they themselves would say, creative agents in theApproaching the spirits 71"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"formation of their own Wyrd, constructing meaning in otherworldsand in their daily lives.In subsequent chapters some of the sites of contestation will befurther examined, before returning to a consideration of seidr andacademia, and similarities between the journey of the seidworkerand that of the ethnographer who sets out to chart a largelyunknown terrain; and to questions about shamanism and academia.First, however, I return to personal perception: my own account ofexperiences with seidr and my insertion into seidworkers’ discourseand practice. I ask you, therefore, to step into the world of thebeginning-seidworker, and to suspend academic doubts, as I recounthow I came to make my own journey in the mound.72 Approaching the spirits"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"The journey in themoundNarratingEvery story is told for an audience. Pieces of the narrative thatfollow were addressed, initially, to various audiences: friends,colleagues, co-workers within seidr. The account of my firstencounter with oracular seidr was written for two friends; later, partof it was incorporated into a paper given to the Society for theAnthropology of Consciousness (Blain, forthcoming) and usedagain, together with Jordsvin’s narrative of visiting Hel’s realm, at afolklore conference (Blain 2000). Other pieces come from fieldnotes,from poems, from email discussions, from a website I constructed toshare with others who journey in quest of knowledge of self. Thenarrative is, of course, partial, selected for the particular readershipof this book.Storytelling, though, is constructed within audience participa-tion, feedback through which the narrator becomes aware of howher words affect her listeners. A move from academic mode intostorytelling is dangerous, in a mostly academic book. Yet in theinterests of taking both spirit and human research participantsseriously, my own experiences require to be presented. These formpart of my understanding of community and consciousness, andinform the processes through which I approach other people’snarratives. At times my experiences echo those of others: at timesthose others, heard later, become an echo or a counterpart to myown.In what follows I describe something of my own journey, andsomething of those others – human or otherwise – whom I have metwith, on the way. I move from an interested spectator, to a beginner,a seidworker, a guide, and once again return to ethnography, withincontexts that include seidr in quest for my own knowledges, and forChapter 5"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"healing, as well as the oracular practices described elsewhere in thisbook. Largely absent from this account, though, are the discussionsand debates with other practitioners, some very considerably more‘expert’ than myself (for instance discussions with Bil about thestrange, toothed beasts I met as described later in this chapter,entheogen use, and healing-seidr, or with Raudhildr about Wodenand the seeress in the mound). These emerge, at times, in otherchapters. In the meantime, this chapter serves to indicate that thenarratives of ‘what is seidr’ and ‘doing seidr’ constructed else-where have their being within practitioner dialogues, and that theperceptions shared with me as part of my research were given in theunderstanding that I partook in at least some of the experiencesrelated.This chapter is also a reminder that seidr is being reconstructed,or ‘reinvented’, newly for today, within contexts of post-modernityin Britain, the US and elsewhere. There are no ‘master shamans’whose knowledge and practice we can draw upon, but simply thosewho have tried to put something together and who discover, oneway or another, that ‘it works’, giving them insights and under-standings, ways to approach their own lives and at times touch, healor guard those of others, ways to create and assist communities. Theexperiences I describe include many that are solitary, individualised:but such is not the overall focus of seidr. Unlike some other Westernneo-shamanisms, this is not merely a tool for self-discovery or self-help, but for engagement, mediation between human and spiritcommunities, where the spirits encountered have ‘their own agendas’and are not necessarily benign.Some of the experiences narrated here are discussed or drawn onelsewhere in this book. They are not unproblematic. As indicated inearlier chapters, within the linked communities of participants thereare questions and disputes over what is experienced, how far it is‘external’ to the seeress or ‘shared’ between participants, how far itreflects or is informed by practices described in the sagas. The finalinstance related here, of ‘the Völva’ emerging from her mound togive answers to a seer, has been quite extensively debated betweenparticipants. Based in the discourse of ‘taking spirits seriously’, wasshe indeed a ‘seeress’ and to what extent were her answerstrustworthy? What was her stake in the proceedings? Why did sheappear (for the seer did not ‘summon’ her)? What is the ‘use-value’of seidr perceptions? This chapter, though, gives my ownimpressions: those of others are elsewhere in this book.74 The journey in the mound"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"ExperiencingThe first time I was present at an oracular seidr was in summer1996, at a festival, Trothmoot, held at the Gaia retreat centre nearKansas City. For some years I had been reading about seidr, on theinternet, and corresponding with people about it via email,witnessing, some time previously, major disagreements on an emaillist ensuing from descriptions of seidr as ‘shamanism’, readingaccounts by Heathens of these contested terms. Oracular seidr was,I thought, something I should see, and learn about, as an academicresearching identity in Earth-religions, to grasp how people con-structed the realities they worked within. I knew the story of theseeress Thorbjörg. I knew the basics of how the seidr séance wasconstructed, following Hrafnar’s deductions from the literature, andhad some familiarity with anthropological material on shamanismsand consciousness. Two friends were interested in pursuing thisfurther, incorporating a more shamanistic practice into the small‘kindred’ we had developed previously, and I had asked for, andreceived, training materials from Jordsvin, whom I was interviewingas part of my research. I read up on neo-shamanic journeying,dipped briefly again into some of the anthropological literature onshamanism, and was ready to face the unknown. In participation inneo-pagan guided meditations, I had discovered a talent forassisting others, through voice and imagery, into light trance states.Having worked with altered consciousness within circle rituals andon my own, I could, to some extent, visualise the ‘journey’. I waseager to see the session, report back to my friends, and usethis experience as part of my ethnographer’s construction of‘Heathenry’, another aspect to reconstructed religion, part of post-modernity’s diversity of spirituality. I did not envision myself as aseidworker.It was late at night, after the other events of the day, and theroom was dim, candlelit, still warm from the exceeding heat ofKansas at midsummer. My brain switched into ‘taking notes’ modeas people were seated and the seid-folk began the preliminaries,chanting a rune-row, invoking deities, singing the journey song,drumming and singing the songs that called their power animals. Innear-darkness, Diana narrated the journey down beneath the rootsof the World Tree, to Hel’s realm, and Winifred sat in the high seat,her face veiled, and in trance went through the gates.I had been working hard, visualising the journey and takingThe journey in the mound 75"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"mental notes. What I did not expect was the very strong pull,experienced both as a yearning and as a direct physical tug to thepit of my stomach, to follow her. Remembering the instructions, Iconcentrated on visualising the gates before me, closed. Diana hadsaid the seeress would remain connected to us, by a silver cord. I feltthe cord, an umbilicus between myself and Winifred, felt its tension.Questioners stepped forward, and listening, I felt that attachment,that pull. Some asked of jobs, some of relationships, health, futuremeetings, relatives. One asked of a severe health problem and theneed to face her mortality, and I listened in the half-world of trance,before the gates, profoundly moved. When Winifred left the highseat, I felt my body doing work, drawing her back, lending my ownstrength. With a second seeress in the chair, I was more able todistance myself. Now there was no call to enter the gates, though Icould sense that later, at another time, there would be. The seeresswas tiring, and still there were questions. Diana, taking the highseat, called to me to stand behind her and ‘shadow’ her, givingprotection and physical stability, should she sway in the seat.After the session, I walked to my tent, up the steep rocky path tothe campsite. Though we had been ‘talked back’ from the gates, upto the World Tree and through a tunnel of trees to the ‘consensusreality’ of sitting in our circle of chairs around the high seat, I couldsense that I was moving in another reality, walking back from Hel’sgates, and used the sensation of physically climbing to help myreturn from the light trance of the audience-participants.SeeingArmed with more information I returned to my small workinggroup, and some weeks later, in Thorgerd’s living-room, wejourneyed to the gates and spent time sitting before them, tofamiliarise ourselves with the journey there and back. On thesecond journey, in July 1996, a raven sat on a gatepost, its head onone side, eyeing me. Somehow its slightly ramshackle farm gate wassuperimposed on my visualisation of the great gates of Hel’s realm:a farm gate similar to the ones in the countryside of the burialcairns in my own land. I was conducting the narration to Yggdrasilland down beneath its roots, acting as guide for my friend, Amber,singing her through Hel’s gates while Thorgerd drummed. We werenot attempting a question-and-answer session: rather we werefamiliarising ourselves with the landscape and the process, mapping76 The journey in the mound"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"out the territory. Amber went through the gates, moved around, saw– a hall, with two men talking: what more she saw and described isno longer with me – and returned.Thorgerd drummed some more, for me, as I moved through thegates.Seeress, what do you see?I sat on our improvised high seatwith a shawl over my head, waiting for something to happen andwondering whether the experience of guiding Amber had broughtme too much out of trance. At first there was nothing, no sensation,resolving into greyness, then shapes, as if surrounded by rocks,boulders that I could not touch. I walked amidst them for sometime, trying to move onward. Then my waiting friends rememberedto sing for me... Did I see a path and a tree? In later visions I did.This first time, I was within a hall, filled with people, and a brightgleam of gold. But the people did not see me, for I was not of thisplace, but I moved through, and out......into a strange place, a plain of whiteness, bright and cold, notsnow, simply whiteness all around, with no markers, no features.Then came the raven, flying back and forth, black against the white,glossy feathers reflecting the light, then returning to me, sitting onsomething – what, in the whiteness, I do not know – with its headon one side, again looking at me. It had a white streak on one sideof its head. There were no words. It was flying again, and I movedon, in my person’s shape, rather clumsily through the white veilingbrightness, on a path that I knew to be there, and now there weresome shapes, geometrical and changing, and the raven flew farther...Three ears of grain were before me, clear and distinct in theforeground, and as I looked beyond, an image, a place, a glen orvalley between hills, with in it a flowering meadow. In the centre wasa log, and on the log one who sat wrapped in his great grey-bluecloak with his hat over one side of his face and with his travellingstaff at his side, who looked at me in greeting. I paused, drawn,wishing to go further, but something in his face, or his movements,told me it was not yet time for me to be there, and I found myselfback before the gates, with Thorgerd and Amber, filled with thepurest delight, the most utter happiness I had known: delight in theknowledge that I could do this, and, most of all, that I had met theone whom I recognised, who had spoken to me before in words andsensations, the Wanderer of the worlds who seeks for knowledgewhere it is to be found.On the next journey we experimented with questioning, and Ifound that I could wait, in darkness, for a question and, with someThe journey in the mound 77"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"difficulty (due to the wish of my academic’s brain to analyse ratherthan speak the vision) relay what then came to me. At the end theguide gave me space to go where I would, and once again the ravenwas there and I was back in the meadow; and this time I sat,sheltered by his cloak, and he called me ‘daughter’.MeetingSeveral others who met with us for ritual had become interested inwhat we were doing, and we agreed to run a animal-ally (‘power-animal’) meditation. I had received a copy of Diana’s seidr workshop,and I planned to use the meditation from this, a little modified tosuit what we had been doing. Both Amber and I already knew ouranimals – so we thought. We arranged a session where Thorgerdwould drum for us all, and I would narrate, take over the drummingwhen we reached Yggdrasill so that she also could participate, andwatch: then a few days later Thorgerd would drum for me alone.As I began the narration to Thorgerd’s drumming I could seewith double vision: the room of participants, of whom I wasattempting to retain awareness, and the tunnel of trees that leddownward, downward, to the plains of Midgard. As I talked of thetree Yggdrasill, and the squirrel Ratatosk that ran up and down, Icould both see and touch the rough bark before me. Thorgerd’sdrum ceased and I began a slow beat, as steady as I could make it,directing them to turn from the tree, and move where they would,across the plain, to forest, hill or stream, to where their ally inanimal form, their friend, fylgja, spirit-helper, part of their ownspirit, waited for them. Even as I continued to drum I felt myselfmoving also, the raven came to guide me further onward, and Icould see and hear other creatures – a blue jay screeching, as I recall– even before I let the drum fall silent.Several came by me. Most clear was a vixen, who trottedpurposefully along, on the grass by the edge of the forest, andacross a little mound. She was not for me, but for another of mycompany, this I knew. I became aware of some kind of large, white-ish shape half-seen in the woods; a great cat; another, smaller, ofwhich the claws were its most prominent feature. There were manybirds. For a little while I flew among these, all the while knowingthat there was something more. I returned to the grass by theforest’s edge and waited, sitting and gazing into the shadowsbeneath the trees.78 The journey in the mound"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"A stag came out of the forest, his antlers tipped with gold by thesun’s rays.Oh, beautiful!I thought.Are you for me? He looked at meand moved aside, and behind him another creature trotted outto look me squarely in the eyes.

It came to me that I shouldhave known this.I returned, shocked, briefly, to awareness of the room and itsparticipants. All seemed well, and in trance. Then I was once againby the forest’s edge, standing by the great predator with my fingerson his fur, as he twisted his head to look round at me again.So soft,despite the rough exterior.I was surprised by the softness andthickness of his pelt. Then I was riding bareback, as if on a horse,with my arms around the great beast’s shaggy neck, feeling thewarm soft hair, and I remember laying my head down on the wolf ’sback as we sped over land and sky, rejoicing in strength and softnessand speed.Then back, to an awareness that some of the group were stirringfrom their trance state.I returned, flying again with the cloud of birds and the raven thathad first greeted me. Then I stood again at the forest’s edge, andtook leave of my guide with his thick soft fur, and agreed to meetagain, soon, for he had much to show me, as he let me knowwithout words. I returned to the great tree and, surfacing, took mydrum, struck three loud beats, and commenced the narration ofleave-taking and return. We looked at each other, dived into finger-foods we’d brought, shared, and ate to ‘ground’ our beings in thetangible reality of hunger and food, then I asked, ‘whose was thefox?’The purposeful vixen had been for Thorgerd, the white beast fora man who thought, though was not sure, he had met a white goat.Others had met with a lion and a lynx. The stag was connected onlywith my own vision, as I was to discover later.*****A few days later, Thorgerd drummed for me alone and as I laywrapped in a blanket, she recited the narration to take me to theplain of Midgard and the World Tree. This time the wolf waswaiting, and again I rode on his back. Then the world changed, andI changed, and now I became a wolf, part of the pack, with cubswhich may have been my cubs, and I watched them play and IThe journey in the mound 79"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"played with them, then, leaving them in the den, ran with the packthrough the forest, tracking our prey.We found the great stag of the woods and tracked it, purpose-fully and wordlessly, which seemed to take a long, long time,running through the forest with a joy of life and movement, andcommon purpose. Thus began a long journey. Space preventsinclusion of the entire account, from my fieldnotes. Also my doubtsre-emerge, about ability to present feeling, sensing, experiencing inways that a non-shamanic audience will grasp. Suffice it to say thatit took time. My first ‘initiation’ was to run as a wolf with the pack,blending ‘self ’ and ‘other’, to track and kill the stag. We pulled itdown, and ate, tearing at skin and flesh with strong teeth. Then weslept.Next, waking or dreaming, I was in bird shape, and flying, high,onward, then walking as a person, and then once more with thewolf, again riding on his back, as he commenced a journey, runningfaster and faster, first on land towards the mountains, and thenthrough the air, and now the wind howled like a wolf and all aroundwere other shapes, wolves and horses, spirits on the wind . . . As Irode with the Wild Hunt, I saw many things, before standing on amountain top to have some questions answered by the Wanderer’smany words, and become, myself, challenged before I experiencedmy death by both spear and noose, absence of breath, blackness,which was understood and welcomed.Much later, I was flying high over a chequered world of field andforest and town, with here and there the black smudges of smoke.There were again many words, though I cannot now rememberthem, but it was important that I see this world and knowsomething of the problems that beset it. Then down, lower, to wheremany did battle, and the ravens waited to feast.Then I stood alone and robed in a circle of great grey stones,waiting, and the wolf came for me, and I rode, and the worlddissolved . . .I sat up, returned, dazed, in Thorgerd’s living room, as shefinished the narration of return to the world of the living. She said,‘You were very far away...’SpeakingI found that in oracular seidr the journey was less clear, as I wasconscious of the audience, wondering about their level of comfort,80 The journey in the mound"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"their level of trance, attempting to facilitate their experience, exceptwhen I sang the runes or sat in the high seat. The almost formulaicritual ‘performance’ led to its own state of altered consciousness,different from that of the solitary or facilitated journey. I would gothrough the gates, wait to be sung onto a path, and see first manypeople, then a tree, and by the tree I could find answers, though theycame slowly when people asked, and speaking, requiring towithdraw sufficiently from the deep trance state to be able toarticulate with physical tongue, throat and lips, was hard, and hassince become still more hard.Then came a journey several months after I first went throughHel’s gate, early in 1997. This journey was different from the start.As I did the narration to the gates, it seemed increasingly that thiswas for the others, I was facilitating their journey, but though I feltmyself moving into a light trance I did not see the gates. Sitting onthe high seat with the veil over my head, I was in a mound, at onceseeing the one who dwelt there and being myself the dweller in themound, buried there long before. To the questions, answers arosewithin the mound, from the glitter of flecks of gemstones in thesoil, from images projected onto walls of stone or earth, frompatterns formed by stacked stones before me. At times my awarenessseemed to incorporate a large hall of feasting people, who yetformed part of the mound – howe, barrow or cairn, I did notinquire at this time. When Thorgerd, a craftswoman, asked of herwork, I heard the ringing of hammer on anvil, and saw the dwarf-smith who laughed when I passed on the question to him. Myfriend had asked this question before, which was why he laughed. Inthe mythology, dwarves crafted the finest objects, and forgedprecious metals.Two days later, sitting at my computer, the images returned tome.Around me earthabove me roots, turfdarkness encirclesand the scent of moist soil,mouldwith a freshness of new lifeas seeds stir in soilwaiting rebirtha fresh spring, a new yearThe journey in the mound 81"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Here is silenceYet now I turn, to hear the clamour,of hall bright-beaconed,laughing and boasting,feasting with noisy cheerthose who wait with me,laid in this mound, or comefrom where they fellto join their kin...... Fires glow in the encircling darknessbellows-blown;deep in the eartha dwarf-smith forges gold...Here was a silence of many words.ListeningOver the next two years, the walls of the mound became clearer,stone-built, so that at times the answers lay in the patterns of theirarrangement and positioning. In an example from my fieldnotes,an account describes waiting on a ‘high seat’ constructed fromcushions, while my guide drummed. The wolf came at this point,the guide talked me ‘through the gate’ and I was on my own. Itwas dark, with a little light which seemed to be from a flame or fireset within the place where I was. I could see stones of thewalls, reflecting the flame. I was in the mound, and the walls werestones.The first question concerned a job. I ‘saw’ first a woman whostood holding a straight staff, which she held planted on theground. She seemed to be a guardian. She was standing on the bankof a stream or small river, and animals were coming to the river todrink. I wasn’t sure what they were. Some may have been cats, andother small animals seemed a bit like mice. The river ran quite fast,but they were all able to drink, and the woman remained on guard,on the bank. Then the vision changed: another woman now sat at atable and sorted some small flakes or leaves, mint or another herb,putting some into small packets and lining them up on the table. Icould not describe her, because the focus was not the woman butthe little green leaf flakes. But when I spoke of this, the picture82 The journey in the mound"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"changed back to the river and the guardian on the back, but now Icould see a bird on a rock in the stream, like a wagtail, long tailwagging up and down. I gave some more description of the scene,and there were more animals there. The waters were healing, andmoving on.The questioner asked what message Freyja had about what sheshould be doing. There was a sensation of a very large animal withvery large horns, which I couldn’t quite see. The concentration ofthe trance gained intensity, and I was falling into the darkness ofthe vision. I was aware of opening my eyes, under the veiling scarf,to blackness, no light at all, while retaining the sensation of fallinginto the dark, or into the mound. Closing them I was in thepresence of the aurochs; ‘Audumbla’, my mind echoed. I could seethe horns, but not the whole animal. The shape of the hornschanged, and there was the face of a deer, somehow very female, mywolf very briefly, then the cats of the goddess’ chariot, gold-brownand a little striped, and I knew that these were not domesticatedanimals. I recalled that there had been a question – what should shebe doing? – and was aware of formulating it, and then there werewords which did not come from the cats or the aurochs, althoughthe power of the aurochs was in them and I was not describing butspeaking for another. The exact words are hard to recall, the onlyhazy part of the experience. The sense of being that was behindthem was what absorbed my attention. However, the gist was thatthe querant had healing hands, something about gathering herbs(and I was returned briefly to the little flakes of mint), but that shehad to use her gifts and she had to speak about it. There was more,an elaboration. The questioner pointed out that speaking andgathering herbs didn’t pay the rent and asked Freyja how she sawthis being possible. For some time there was no image, simply asense of power together with exasperation – why does she ask this,why doesn’t she understand? – and I found myself re-emerging,asking what the querant should do, reformulating her query. Then Isaw one of the cats, looking very puzzled and a little put out, andagain I felt I was falling, though not so strongly as before, andsaying with some exasperation that the querant had to do, theimplication being get on with it, get the word out there aboutherself, keep working at it, take a chance.I do not remember coming out of Freyja’s presence. I do knowthat I returned to a ‘resting’ state, in the mound, with the wolfbeside me. I tried opening my eyes again, and again there wasThe journey in the mound 83"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"darkness. The second querant asked about whether she would makea planned move to another country, or should seek work locally.The answer was fairly straightforward: grey skies, stormcloudsand wind, what seemed to be the patterns of a hurricane, a linedrawn across the sky; then someone who leaned over a table with achart or map on it, in a laboratory, wearing a lab coat, planningsome detailed work, then others were there also. Outside the stormwas still raging. I could see trees bending in the wind, and they werein leaf. I said that it seemed that she should seek work whereshe was, that there would be some kind of technical or scientificwork, and that there was not a real possibility of going away forsome time.My guide’s question also concerned work, whether the small jobsshe was getting would grow into something else, whether the seedswould finally sprout. The answers were very visual: first a pattern, ageometric shape like a ‘V’, golden-brown, faceted and multi-layered,which remained there in the darkness when I opened my eyes, thenwith them closed turned so that I was looking into it, and from thecentre grew a small sprout, which gained strength and produced aflower, like a buttercup, which I viewed head-on. The flower changedto become crystalline, like a pattern of quartz crystals. I reportedthat seeds might sprout but that the result would not be direct, buttransformed in some way.There were no more questions for me, and I rested in the dark-ness, again seeing the wolf, then returned through the gates. Iopened my eyes under the veil, to the brightness of a candle on theright. The guide drummed. I felt rather dazed but recovered fastand on leaving the high seat, drummed briefly to get my bearingsbefore asking Thorgerd if she would take the high seat.Even at the time of writing the fieldnotes from which thesedescriptions are taken, the day after the event, I did not have a goodmemory of what Thorgerd said, other than in her answer to me. Myfocus was on her and on the pattern of question and answer, not onthe details of what she saw. To my question, she described ameadow with a picket fence across it, a very large meadow. Catswere moving through the fence, although the gaps in the fenceseemed too small for them. They were like ghost-cats, shadow-cats,moving and merging one with another. She was tired, and I broughther back after this answer, without seeking clarification.A month before this séance, I had attempted a personalexploration which produced a series of images, including Hebridean84 The journey in the mound"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"sea waves, caves, terns flying and a squabble between different birdsfor something, an eagle. Emerging quite clearly were the pillars ofStaffa, which I had seen once, on a boat trip from Oban in mymother’s company. Several days later I journeyed again, chanting atune which had come to me some months previously and gelled inmy mind after the Staffa journey. Now I found there were words,and images to go with them. Gulls and terns, whitecaps on thewind-whipped seas, fish, an eagle (seemingly a sea-eagle rather thana golden eagle or osprey) and the wolf, who ran swiftly over therocky shore and up into the hills behind. My drum sang its ownsong, and my voice seemed to echo with harmonics, amplified bythe nearness of the drumhead.Two weeks later at Thorgerd’s house, I drummed again and sanga rune-row, then used my new song as the method of trance-induction. Thorgerd drummed for me during trance. Jumbledvisions merged one to another: several animals, the wolf, a distantfriend, interspersed with the stone circle that had been a part of myvisions since I began this project, and the stacked stone and earthwalls of a tomb, the mound of the dweller of my earlier poem. HereI was revising past memories through present experience. I hadentered this vision with questions, and near the end a small figureappeared, a woman cloaked and hooded, her face aged and almostskeletal yet at the same time filling out with the flesh of youth, smallin distance as if viewed through a reversed telescope, yet near,present beside me in the mound. It seemed that she was Heidr, theseeress (or at least aseeress), and answers formed to my questions,before it was time to leave.I had begun to suspect that my mound had a physical location,and knew where it might be. On a trip several years previously, Ihad glanced briefly into the chambered tomb, and left, because ofpressures to not spend time there, to continue on a family visit,return to the car and drive to where we were to spend the night in aScottish bed-and-breakfast. I had at the time made a promise tomyself, or to the place, to return: which I had through reading andthrough the internet, but never in person, though I was beginningto, now, in the seidr trance and in dreams.And an opportunity arose. In June 1999 I reached my destination,tired from a sleepless transatlantic night-time flight, yet successfullyreliant on public transport to reach a small West of Scotlandvillage. There were many things in the area that I wanted to see, butwhen I arrived my first destination was the burial cairn that IThe journey in the mound 85"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"remembered. In the late afternoon of a bright summer’s day Ientered, gazed around, noting the stacking of the stones, the waythe sun entered the chamber. I stayed there a little while, reflecting,and started to chant a rune-row, but it seemed to me that the air wasdead, the sound did not reverberate, this sound was not right for theplace. I took some photographs, with results that later astonishedme: though I could not, at that time, sense it, there was an energyhere that was living, bright, vibrant.Two days later I returned. I walked around the outside, takingmore pictures, then put away the camera, and spent some timefeeling myself become part of the landscape, the scenery, theambience of this place. Then, taking a deep breath, I climbed downinto the tomb.It was cool, cold on the stones striking into my bones, a relieffrom the heat of the late afternoon, becoming colder, and then I nolonger was aware of the cold of the stone where I sat. I chanted alittle, the song that had come to me some months before, whichseemed to fit. Over and over, then silence. I studied the walls, thestacked stones, the large stone slabs of the base, the capstones.Some present-day constructions of meaning were evident in thescratched graffiti, some older than others, though. In the stillness Iwaited, and my song still echoed: stillness, silence, eyes closed now,heart rate increased, a waiting of anticipation.Thoughts, impressions, voices: a face that changed to becomeanother, and another, and that one a child, then changing again,though with likeness one to another, hazy, with a memory ofdissolution, of burnt bone, of merging into the others, into thewalls, into the floor. The community was here, and I was of them,looking out over the valley and awaiting something – what?Fragments of my poem from the mound surfaced, though thesepeople were far older than their descendants of whom I’d spokenthen. But I did not know, then, where I had waited for words tocome, waited for rebirth, waited for those who would uncover wallsand floor, let the light into this place that with my eyes shut or evenopen had become so dark, despite the sunlight that streamed behindme, to warm my back and counter the effect of that so-cold stone: awarmth that I no longer needed, absorbed into this community, partof these presences that permeated walls, roof and floor.I understood that there were sounds in the silence, voices,whispers, and I was part of the sound.86 The journey in the mound"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"RememberingFrom my seidr experiences, too many impressions remain with meto detail here. I will sketch only a few images that appeared –though whether seen, heard or otherwise sensed in a deep-tranceblending of senses, is not clear to me: ‘seen’ or ‘heard’ are everydayunderstandings of separate, documentable perceptions. Some madeno sense to me, only to the querant. A white mask with curling lips,Buddha-like; a person who walked with a staff, leading othersaround a spiral, maze-like hillside track; a wild cat in a cave. Ilearned that the details were important and that I should attempt torelate them, during or after the seance. Undertaking a healingjourney for a friend, I received a strand of spun yarn and grain tofeed his deer-fylgja, and found a blue bead for him to hang on thethread, with its counterpart, later, in the physical bead that anotherfriend produced for him.I made a new staff of yew wood, carved with rune-verses. I learntto sit leaning forward with the staff supporting me, so that itbecame a branch of Yggdrasill, a connection to all the Nine Worlds,and I could sway, falling into the vision, focusing into its intensity,sometimes resting my forehead on the staff. At time, now, it seemedI could see those strands of Wyrd, connections, fine gold wiresshimmering, or rough home-spun. They led to strange places,through the walls and entrance of the mound. There were someinstances when I could reach out to those threads, touch them,smooth them, cause a ripple which moved along the strands, but Iknew this was not to be lightly done. At other times the engagementwith Wyrd was through interaction. In seeking guidance forquerants I found a creature, large-toothed, open-mouthed, seemingto threaten them: from my non-involved position I could stretch outa hand to close its mouth. In a private trance-session, months later,a beast appeared, akin to the other, and now I could see it moreclearly – white, red-spotted, with thin neck, open mouth, bent onpursuits relating to someone of my acquaintance (I knew notwhom); when I closed the mouth, it disappeared.There are images, too, of a different kind, from when othersmade seidr. Again at Trothmoot, I watched the seidfolk, Jordsvin,Winifred, Raudhildr, Diana, and it was to Raudhildr that Iaddressed my question. I was living in Canada, about to undertakea journey to Britain to see family, friends and places. How wouldmy journey change me?

But she could see no outcomes, gainno sense of what would be. She saw, instead, trees, waving in thewind, thick, green, concealing: they were calling me, she said.Over a year later, now returned to Britain, I sat with staff inhand to guide a seer’s first venture to Hel’s realm. Others of thesmall gathering sang the journey song, chanted and visualised therune-row, we invoked Freyja and Ódinn, I narrated the journey toHel’s realm, and the seer went through the gates. He described ayew-tree, a mound, a hall shimmering in the distance. (‘I am notgoing there,’ he said emphatically.) The mound opened, and from itcame the seeress, wiry, bony – though I was ‘outside the gates’ Icould sense her, almost see her, and she gave or prompted answersto the questions we asked, some ‘making sense’ only to the querants.I was about to move, to take up my present job. What was mostimportant that I should remember, in my move? There was apause, and the seer’s somewhat puzzled voice said, ‘cats?’ Then hecontinued: I had been right to return home, called by the land andthe trees; I should live out of the city as soon as I could; I wouldhave good students; most importantly, I should retain links to thoseI knew... and there were cats again, many of them.Later, long after the session was ended, I found others of thecompany discussing how they had seen the gates of Hel’s realm. Forthe seer, one had been made of human bones. He described it formy ethnographer’s tape-recorder, and in a later communication thecats – uncountable shadow-cats, running from behind him, from themound, from the seeress, out to the gates of Hel, merging andmelding.Thoughts, impressions, voices, ideas; now once again as anethnographer, I sit at my computer and spin the narrative strands,concepts, discourses, into an account for presenting to an audience,attempting to find words that reflect the peculiar sensations andperceptions of these ‘otherworld’ experiences. I draw on the ideasthat come from others, informants, participants of all kinds. Inattempting to ‘take seriously’ both the spirits and all those whoengage with the spirit world, I turn next to the context of seidr, thenand now: to look at areas where understandings are created andsome of the processes, and contestations, that surround theirconstruction.88 The journey in the mound"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Re-evaluating theWitch-QueenThe women of the sagasAn understanding of seidr and Northern magic, in the old literatureor today, requires consideration of the times and places referred to,the political struggles taking place, and the location of people asseidworkers or clients within frameworks of everyday life and workincluding dimensions of gender and social class: and further arecognition that neither gender nor class are static properties ofindividuals, but constructed and reconstructed by and within thecommunity. Today’s gendered processes are not those of the tenthcentury, or before. Nor are they those arising after Christianisation,at the time of writing of the old accounts.This book is not a work of history or literary criticism. I do notexamine the sagas to determine their ‘truth’, their literaryconstruction, or even the devices used by the authors to tell theirstories. I have no expertise in this area. The major analysis of seidrin the texts is that of Strömbäck (1935). Here, rather, I examineinstances and words, and attempt to reflect some sense of thevariety of description of seidworkers and the embedding of thisdescription in context and processes of the times of writing – inorder to understand how discourses of the time of writing, andtheir contradictions, decontextualised, become those of the present,interpreted and recontextualised, as today’s readers draw on past toshape present and future. Multiple readings of the saga material arenot only possible, but inevitable within today’s multivocal society, aseach reader, academic or practitioner, brings to the material theirown awareness of gender and sexuality, society, community andindividual, Heathenism, Christianity, and centralising politicalprocesses.Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"In what follows, I am not regarding the sagas of Icelanders as‘historical’. Much ink has been spilled over whether they reflectreasonably accurate accounts of the times of settlement or conver-sion to Christianity of Iceland, preserved in the oral tradition, orwhether they are essentially ‘fiction’. My assumption, here, is thathowever ‘accurate’ they may or may not be regarding characters andevents, what they hold are understandings from the thirteenth andfourteenth centuries of how the writers’ ancestors might have lived;and when many descriptions tally, we have a sense, therefore, thatthese were possibilities open to women or men, filtered throughcultural change and shifting political circumstances. The accounts,in the versions read by most of today’s Heathen practitioners inNorth America or Britain, have been further filtered through theinterpretations of nineteenth- and twentieth-century translators,though a number of practitioners both in English-speaking and,more obviously, in Scandinavian countries and in Iceland, arereading (today’s normalised versions of ) Old Icelandic texts.Seidr appears in some of today’s contexts as ‘women’s magic’.The tendency within reconstructionist communities is to view seidr,or magic, as essentially unchanging: spell-casting, shape-changing,done by individuals and either approved of or disapproved of bysociety. Arguments arise, as previously indicated, over whether seidrwas ‘evil magic’ and ‘women’s magic’: connections between the twomay be seen in terms of Christian misogyny. Yet examining theextent to which seidr was associated with women, and (with othermagical or shamanistic practices) seen as ‘evil’, cannot be so simplydone. Practices were constructed over centuries, reconstructedwithin changing political and economic circumstances, and peopleused them, deliberately, within communities and societies to specificintents and purposes. Here I look at some of the women who ‘didseidr’, and in the next chapter, some of the men who were and areseidworkers, and how perceptions of the gendering of seidr affectsits practice today.As indicated earlier, most of the accounts of seidr or magicalpractice, from the sagas, are of women. Some detailing of theirexploits is required, here. They appear as part of the action,influencing events, sometimes as central figures. Some have beenmentioned already: Heid, in Hrólfs saga Kraka,Pórdis the seeressand Pórveig the spell-caster, in Kormáks saga, and (with furtherdetails below) Oddbjörg ofVíga-Glúms saga, Kjannok ofHeidarvíga saga, Heimlaug ofGull-Póris saga, and others.

It is time, now, to enquire furtherabout these women, and how what they did appears to relate totheir communities.I earlier mentioned Pórdis. In the Saga of the Water-dalers(Vatnsdæla) the same spákona Pórdís uses her power to resolve adispute in court. ‘She had foresight and could see into the future,and therefore was chosen to arbitrate in important cases’ (Jones1973: 118): when one party will not accept her judgement, she usesmagic to cause them to adopt her peaceful solution.In Víga-Glúms sagathe seeress Oddbjörg is described as‘gledimadur, fródog framswn’; ‘a cheerful person, wise and capableof seeing into the future’ (Hollander 1972: 57). However, it is said ofher that she will give good or bad ‘spá’, foretellings, depending onhow she is treated, and when she predicts misfortune for two youngboys she is shown the door of their grandmother’s house: herprophecy is, of course, borne out by the saga. In Heidarvíga saga,Ólöf, called Kjannok, is said to be ‘vitur mjög ok kunni mart gerlaadsjá . . . fródog forn í skapi’, ‘very wise and could see many thingsclearly . . . learned and leaning to the old ways’. She charms herfoster-son so that he takes no harm from weapons.1From Gull-Pórissaga, there is Heimlaug the völva who dwelt at ‘Völva’s-steading’ inComb-heath. She gives the leading characters information whichmay be gained from far-seeing, receiving a gold finger-ring for herknowledge. (Icelandic from Netútgáfan, n.d.).The later legendary sagas and short stories, which are fiction,told for entertainment value, reintroduce the seeing-women, butnow their magic is akin to the ‘witchcraft’ or spell-craft,supernatural events or powers of later Western fairy-stories, whichappears, often seemingly without cause, to create a circumstancewhich drives the plot, rather than the embedded magic or seeingfrom within the community. The instances of the ‘norns’ in thePáttr of Norna-Gest, or the seidkona Heidr in Arrow-Odd’s saga,given in chapter 4, are examples.Seeing was not all that the women could do. We have accounts ofpeople shapeshifting, using their abilities to hide themselves orothers, causing illusion to be cast.Völsunga saga, the longest of thelegendary sagas, holds many instances of magical practice: forinstance the mother in law of Signwturns herself to a wolf, byRe-evaluating the Witch-Queen 91"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"‘tröllskapar sakir og fjölkynngi’, spell-craft and fjölkynngi.

First, there is the story ofthe rival fjölkunnig(much-knowing) women, Geirrid and Katla,who each have an interest in the young man Gunnlaug. When hecomes to grief, riding home one night, Katla accuses Geirridof being kveldrida, a night-rider who has magically attackedGunnlaug; but Geirrid is cleared in the ensuing legal action. Katlagives her son Odd a charmed tunic whereby no weapon can woundhim. In a fight, a woman attempting to separate combatants has herhand struck off, and Geirrid states that Katla’s son has done this. Agroup attempting to bring justice goes to seek Odd: three timesKatla disguises him, so that first he seems to be a distaff where sheis sitting and spinning, second a goat she is grooming, third a pigsleeping by the house. Each time the searchers realise, after leaving,that they have been tricked. Finally they take Geirrid with themwearing a blue cloak, and Katla realises that now no sjónhverfing,delusion or optical illusion produced by her magic, will work.Geirrid places a bag over Katla’s head, Odd is found, and he and hismother face death for what are perceived as the problems they havecaused.Other magical workers named are Porgríma galdrakinn(translated as Thorgríma witch-face, Thorgríma the witch, though‘magic-face’ might be more precise) and Porgunna. Thorgríma ismentioned by name on several occasions: in one, she is asked tobring a storm to cause trouble to another character. Thorgunna is awealthy woman whose possessions arouse envy, and when she diesanother woman takes some of the prized goods, againstThorgunna’s expressed wishes.

This saga is also rich inmagical or supernatural occurrences, involving giants or trolls,draugar(the walking dead) and so on. Grettir, the hero, famed forhis strength, is a social problem, a disruptive element within thesociety from which he is eventually banished. His death isaccomplished with the aid of an elderly woman, Thurid (Puridr) thefoster-mother of Grettir’s foe Thorbiorn Angle (Porbjörn öngull).She first foretells his death: it is unclear whether she has ‘seen’ hisdeath or whether the words are themselves a spell that helps bring itabout, and equally unclear (at least to today’s reader) whether herposition, lying in the stern of a boat covered with wraps, indicatesthat she is engaging in a form of útiseta or merely that she does notwant Grettir to know, until the last moment, that she is present inthe boat. Sitting up, she says that the remainder of his life will bewithout health or good luck, increasingly until his death.Grettir casts a stone at her, breaking her leg, and says that heknows some evil will now result to him from her fjölkynngi: which isthe case. Thurid later charms a log, using runes and galdr (spokencharms), walking backwards, widdershins around the log, beforecausing it to be pushed into the sea where it drifts against the windto the island where Grettir is living out his exile. A servant therecollects it for firewood, and Grettir, attempting to split it, finds thathis axe turns to wound his thigh; the wound becomes gangrenous,incapacitating Grettir so that Thorbjörn and others finally succeedin killing him. His brother claims that his death has been caused bythe old woman’s spell (galdrar ykkrir og forneskja, ‘your charms andold-time lore’) and fordæduskap, usually translated ‘witchcraft’.Thorbjörn is accused of sorcery, exiled from Iceland, and ‘Var pá ílög tekidadalla forneskjumenn gerdu peir útlæga’, at that time thelaw was passed that all old-lore practitioners (sorcerers) should beoutlawed, says the saga.This is another case of an elderly woman who had earlier ‘knownmuch’ but whose practice had, apparently, ceased with the comingof Christianity.

She is a historical figure, a woman whoexercised power in a man’s world, and the accounts are written fromthe points of view of those who were her opponents. Her reputationis bad. In the sagas of Icelanders she is portrayed as initiating thechain of events occasioning feuds in which first Gunnar, then Njálland his family become enmeshed, by a spell she casts on a lover whowishes to return to Iceland.Gunnhildr can be understood both as a historical personage anda literary fiction. She appears to have been the daughter of aDanish king, Gorm the Old, and his English wife Thyra, and sisterof the Danish king Haraldr Bluetooth (Jones 1984). Yet she isidentified in Egils saga,Njáls saga, and Heimskringla, probablyfollowing the account in Ágrip af Nóregskonungasögum, as daughterof Ozur Toti, an indication that by the time of their writing she hadpassed from history into folklore: a translator of Ágrip speculatesthat her recasting as a ‘commoner’ is in part due to ‘Icelandichostility toward Gunnhildr, whom they may have wanted to havehad more humble origins’ (Driscoll 1995: 87, note 15). Her firstappearance in Heimskringlaand Egils sagatells of her being trainedin ‘magic’ by ‘Finns’, implying that she was learning Sámishamanism.Haralds saga hárfagratells of how she was found withtwo ‘Finnish sorcerers’, whom by sending to sleep she betrayed totheir deaths at the hands of followers of Eiríkr called Bloodaxe, theKing’s son: she then married Eiríkr.She bore at least one daughter and seven sons, in a period ofstormy politics involving the sons of Haraldr Finehair whocompeted for power during their father’s lifetime and after hisdeath. She was variously queen in Norway and at York. Much ofEgils sagadeals with the feud that developed between its hero andEiríkr and Gunnhildr, during which Gunnhild’s son Rögnvaldr wasslain. She is known as Egil’s implacable enemy. Chapter 59 ofEgilssagarecounts Egil’s visit to York, when Gunnhildr spoke for hisdeath, and took the shape of a swallow, twittering outside his94 Re-evaluating the Witch-Queen"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"window to hinder composition of his ‘Head Ransom poem’, herplan being thwarted by the arrival of his friend Arinbjörn. The sagaimplies that Gunnhildr has ‘called’ Egill to York, by setting a seid-spell on him.After her husband’s assassination in Northumbria, Gunnhildrwith her children travelled to Orkney, and later Denmark,remaining a major player in political intrigue. Eventually her sonHaraldr became king of Norway. Several of her sons, includingHaraldr, died in battle, and her sons were ousted from rule by EarlHákon of Hladir (around 970 CE). Gunnhildr ended her days inexile in Scotland: however, an account in the Saga of the Jomsvikingsrelates that after journeying to Denmark in pursuit of a marriagewith King Harald Bluetooth (unlikely, as he was her brother!) shewas drowned in a bog. This was to result in a fresh interest in her in1835 when a body was discovered in the bog (Fischer 1999; Glob1969).The historians of the 19thcentury were never in doubt. Thepeat-diggers had found Queen Gunhild and despite her badreputation – she was, after all, of Royal blood – King FrederikVI arranged for a beautifully carved coffin at St. NicolaiChurch in Vejle.(Fischer 1999: 9)Though the woman’s body found was later dated as Early Iron Age,the legend of the witch-queen had been given new life.The episodes ofNjáls sagaand Laxdæla sagaoccur during thekingship of her son Haraldr called Greycloak, when she institutes asexual relationship with a visiting Icelander, Hrútr, who is inNorway to claim an inheritance. As the story goes, Hrútr is notgiven much choice, his uncle Osur saying, ‘I know Gunnhild’snature. The moment we refuse her invitation, she will hound us outof the country and seize all we own.’ (Magnusson and Pálsson 1960:42) Njáls sagatells that Gunnhildr wins the inheritance for Hrútr(who rewards her by returning to her half) and later lays a spell onHrútr, when he seeks to return to Iceland, so that his marriage therewill remain unconsummated. The resulting divorce sets in motionthe chain of events of the saga. Her portrayal in Njáls saga, as inEgils saga, is overwhelmingly negative.Laxdæla(chapter 19) iskinder in dealing with the episode, which it portrays as a love affairwithout mentioning the spell.Laxdælastates that when Hrútr’sRe-evaluating the Witch-Queen 95"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"nephew Óláfr ‘the Peacock’ travels to Norway, Gunnhildr andHaraldr show him favour for his uncle’s sake, though adding as apiece of gossip that ‘some say’ it was for his own sake also, implyingthat his good looks led to a ‘special relationship’ with Gunnhildr.Discussions ofNjáls sagahave tended to view Gunnhildr as a‘destructive prima donna’ (Lönnroth 1976: 76) introduced into thestory as a literary device, giving clues to thirteenth-century Icelandicidentity by indicating dangers to the hero, providing a contrastbetween the known world of home and family and the king’s court.At the King’s Court there is more romance but even lesssecurity than at the Allthing. The king sits in his hallsurrounded by beer-drinking warriors as the Icelandic visitorarrives to have his heroic valor tested. Evil royal advisers andbeautiful but dangerous women lurk behind the throne(Lönnroth 1976: 59).This accords with Hastrup’s (1985) structural analysis of mediaevalIcelandic culture and identity, which draws on concepts ofinnangardand útangard, the worlds within and without, communityand wildness, known and unknown. In these saga accounts,Gunnhildr is of the útangard.Historically, Gunnhildr and her children received Christianbaptism in England, though how seriously she took this is notrelated. She was a patron of poets, commissioning the Eiríksmál onher husband’s death, and may herself have been a poet, though theone verse accredited to her is an unlikely praise of King Hákon,Eirík’s half-brother, who had caused her family’s exile in York (Jesch1991).Of all women, says Snorri in Haralds saga hárfagra, she was themost fair and most skilled in magic. From this mention onwards,she is spoken of as fjölkunnig(much knowing), as hamram(shape-strong) and as a worker of seidr. The accusations levelled againsther by her enemies are those which Loki charged against Freyja –witchcraft and nymphomania.Ágripcalls her ‘of all women themost beautiful; a woman small of stature yet great of counsel,’(Driscoll 1995: 9) but makes plain that in the eyes of the (probablyclerical) author of this history, her counsel was ‘wicked’ (illrödug)and she was to blame for her husband’s reported cruelty.A task faced by researchers and today’s seidr practitioners, alike,is evaluating the accounts. For our understanding of the concepts96 Re-evaluating the Witch-Queen"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"and their applications, it may be that the ‘historical fiction’ is insome ways more important than the actual woman – of whom verylittle is known, although one assumes that she must have been quitehighly regarded by at least some of her contemporaries: she wasalways able to find refuge and support. In the later accounts,Gunnhildr has become the archetypal sorceress, ‘the prototype ofevil and revenging women in the old Norse corpus’ (Jochens 1996:180). The accounts in Heimskringlaand possibly Egils sagawerewritten by Snorri Sturluson, a descendent of Egill, around 1230.The Njáls sagaportrait of Gunnhildr, from around 1280(Magnusson 1975), continues the trend. Her daughter Ragnhildrwho married Arnfinn, son ofPorfinn earl of Orkney, appears inOrkneyinga sagaas another political, scheming, woman. GwynJones points out that ‘In fact, there is no evidence that Eirik,Gunnhild, and their royal brood were greedier, crueller, moredevious or ambitious than their fellow contenders for rank andriches in Norway’ (1984: 122, fn.).Today, Gunnhildr has the name of a woman who used her skillsin politics or magic to further her own interests, sometimes cruelly.Today’s readers know her through the elaborations of thirteenth-century saga-writers whose chief business was to tell the stories oftheir own ancestors, her enemies. Jesch (1991) has pointed tomisogyny inherent in these accounts, and Jochens (1995: 180)comments that ‘the earliest Old Norse narratives offer a morenuanced portrait that include references to her beauty, paganbeliefs, magical knowledge, and cunning’.This is the background against which today’s seidworkers seethemselves and their magical/shamanistic practice. Academia hasemphasised negative evaluations of seidr, and many accounts withinthe Heathen community have likewise positioned seidr as somethingto be regarded with suspicion, even fear.Past and present: evaluating the seidwomenToday’s practitioners are working, therefore, with conflictingdefinitions of seidr: ‘evil magic’, or constructive; something done bywomen, or a special skill that anybody might learn; valuable ordestructive according to discursive constructions within thecommunity. Some say that ‘seidr’ should mean onlyevil magic, withactivities of journeying and divination more properly termed ‘spae’.There are the arguments that seidr involved ‘messing with people’sRe-evaluating the Witch-Queen 97"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"minds’, changing memories or personality characteristics, turning(or threatening to turn) ‘the world upside down’ (from Ljót inVatnsdæla saga, which may refer to an earthquake or personalturmoil), with Gunnhild’s curses given as evidence. Yet theseaccounts can be read as attempts to defend, or to avenge. I asked theseeress Raudhildr about such ‘negative’ views, and how she saw herpractice in their light. Her response:I agree that defense/vengeance can be read into some of theseaccounts.One might also note, the mind and the sword can be equallydeadly if wielded ‘properly’. I find it interesting the judgmentsmade about death by magic as opposed to death by the swordand how that difference bears on opinions of the practice of seid.I made reference, in chapter 3, to the account of the seidkonaPurídr sundafyllir, who called fish into the sound, thereby bringinglife, not death: and speculations that this seidwoman and theGreenland Seeress were effectively dealing with the threads of Wyrdso that they acted to restore balance within the community and itsenvironment; engaging in shamanistic practice, performed for thecommunity, going beyond telling the future to engaging with itsconstruction. Raudhildr gave me a present-day example of ‘fishing’seidr designed to benefit individual or community (also in Blain,forthcoming). On a Californian fishing expedition, one person hadcaught no fish.I touched his line and ‘sang along it’ to the fish. I asked them toplease give one more of their kind to this good man. I said hewould make offering to the gods and wights of the sea for theprosperity of all their folk in return. I sang of the man’sworthiness to receive such a gift. How a great fish giving himselfto this man would bring honor to all parties. I sang of hispower and his bravery as a warrior (the gent was a VietnamVeteran). Lastly I thanked them for listening to my song. I tookmy hand off the line and a fish hit his line so hard I heard theline slap against the side of the boat. Two minutes later he hadthe fish on the deck. I don’t like the practice, but on the big tripboats, they will sometimes club the fish. But this one didn’t needit. The gentleman knelt down and touched it, said ‘thank you’and the fish stopped moving. It was very powerful. No more98 Re-evaluating the Witch-Queen"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"than two minutes after that, the boat limited out and the lineswere pulled out of the water and we headed home.This active construction is something emerging frequently inRaudhildr’s discussions of seidr, an important aspect of what she isdoing. Stephan Grundy instances Purídr sundafylliras an exampleof ‘socially constitutive seidr’, others being the accounts ofPórdisspákona from Vatnsdæla (as previously mentioned), using magic tobring about a peaceful solution to a crisis, and ‘another Pórdís, inGunnars saga keldugnúpsfífls [who] uses seidr to force Gunnarr topay the weregild for her brother whom he has slain, since there isclearly no man in the family to bring him to law’ (Grundy, pers.com.).Grundy relates this socially approved use of seidr to the relationof women to the law of the times, and its mechanisms forenforcement.In these examples seidr may, I think, be seen as the way inwhich a woman could complement a not always adequatepower of law, just as men at times had to complement it withfighting. In this regards, I might suggest that some of the horrorfelt towards seidr had something to do with the fact that it wasusually performed in secret and normal methods of defenseagainst it could not be used. Hence it bore a whiff of the moraltaint associated with secret murder – and in these ‘sociallyconstructive’ examples, we note that the primary operators arefemale and therefore permitted means of enforcement orredress other than physical challenge to the offender.(pers. com.)The suggestion here is that seidr used for community constructionor protection was acceptable when done by a woman, but that menwere expected to seek other forms of redressing the social balance(see also Dubois 1999). Seidr in this account parallels the use ofstrength or weapons, and indeed seidr can be seen as a means ofstrength or a weapon, one which is hidden. As Raudhildr said, ‘themind and the sword can be equally deadly’. This concept of seidr ashidden, therefore less acceptable for men, is further pursued in thenext chapter.So for at least some within today’s Heathen community, seidr,defined as use of hidden skills which enable the practitioner toRe-evaluating the Witch-Queen 99"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"contact spirits and with their aid to ‘see along’ the threads of örløgor Wyrd or actively manipulate those threads, is legitimate andacceptable practice when performed for the benefit of the com-munity.

They cite averse from the poem Völuspáwhich almost all practitioners haveread (in various translations): its interpretations display contest-ations of ‘women’s magic’.Heidi hana hétuhvar er til húsa kom,völu velspáa,vitti hún ganda;seidhún kunni,seidhún leikin,æ var hún anganillrar brúdar.(Kuhn and Neckel 1962:Völuspá22)Verse 22 introduces the name ‘Heidr’, giving what information wehave about this entity. The manuscript sources are not in totalagreement, with ‘seidhún hvar er hún kunni’, and ‘seidhúnhugleikin’. A nineteenth-century interpretation has ‘vél’ (deceit,artifice) in place of ‘vel’ (well or pleasing), and as diacriticalmarkings are not present in the earlier versions, either reading ispossible. All the more scope, therefore, for today’s interpreters.Translations available to practitioners vary.Heith she was hightwhereto houses she camethe wise seeress,and witchcraft pliedcast spells where she could, cast spells on the mind:to wicked womenshe was welcome ever.(Hollander 1962: 4)Larrington’s translation is probably the most read among today’sHeathens. She gives:Bright One they called her, wherever she came to houses,the seer with pleasing prophecies, she charmed them with spells;she made magic wherever she could, with magic she played withminds,she was always the favourite of wicked women.(Larrington 1996: 7)100 Re-evaluating the Witch-Queen"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"A translation in an article in the Heathen magazine Idunnagave:She was called Heidhr when she came to houses, a volvaprophesying well/deceitfully, she knew gand-craft, she practicedseidhr where she could, practiced seidhr, playing with hugr, shewas ever dear to evil women.(Gundarsson 1995: 9)The translation by W.H.

There are some obviousdifferences: The fourth half-line produces multiple sets of possiblemeanings, in the above translations. Was Heidr ‘enchanting staves’or ‘charming (people) with spells’ or ‘knowing gand- (staff or wand-)craft’ or ‘wise in talismans’, and all from the phrase, ‘vitti (orperhaps ‘viti’) hún ganda’. So the debate goes on – exasperatingly tosome of today’s Heathens who seek ‘truth’. ‘Anyone else wishsomeone would just translate it all just as it is?’ was a recentcomment on an email list.

All share the common element of the lastline: Heidr, the archetypal seidworker, was specifically welcomed bywicked women.Heidr, discourse and interpretationWhen members of the community raise the question of why Heidrwas associated with wickedness, or evil – as they do – they askquestions such as ‘What does the text say?’ or ‘Could it be aChristian interpolation?’ But no text here is definitive, and thedating of the poem is debated. For the community as a whole, thereRe-evaluating the Witch-Queen 101"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"are no easy answers, and so the debate about whether seidr (orHeidr) is intrinsically ‘evil’ continues. Meanings shift and changewithin changing contexts of practice. Every interpretation ortranslation relies on previous decisions as to which version was‘better’, and there is no simple answer.In approaching understandings through discourse and narrative,meanings of a text are constituted by many people, including writerand reader, and any or all that come between, within the specifics of(changing) context. The text becomes a site of contestation.Sometimes within Heathen interpretations the part of the editor,scribe or redactor is recognised: many agree that the Eddas are notsacred scripture, (not absolute Truth for all times) but the inspiredpoems of various individuals who lived in their own times, theirown places. The meanings that today’s readers bring to Eddicanalysis are not necessarily those that their creators wouldrecognise.As a practitioner, I explore the context. The preceding verseintroduces Gullveig, Love of Gold or Intoxication-of-Gold, whocame among the Æsir. Three times she was burned in the hall ofHár, yet remained living. The common interpretation is thatGullveig became Heidr, with interpreters mostly in agreement thatGullveig/Heidr is also Freyja,2who came among the Æsir after thewar of Æsir and Vanir, and who, according to Snorri, taught seidrto the Æsir. Gullveig/Heidr was burned, but lives. As Heidr, shecomes to houses, she foretells, she knows the magic called seidr.Why was she burned? The commonest interpretations within theHeathen community (and academia: see Schach 1983) are that shebrought to the Æsir the love of gold, which caused problems so thatthe Æsir attempted to remove the problems by removing Gullveig;or that her magic caused problems for the Æsir, with the sameresult. Less negative viewpoints are that as she shines more brightlyafter the burning, there may be an association with ‘thrice-refinedgold’; or even a parallel with Ódin’s ordeal on Yggdrasill, if it is the‘initiatory’ experience of burning that enables her to have theknowledge of seidr.Some academic interpreters see the verse as an example of late-Heathen distrust of magic or seidr, misogyny, or indeed both.It may well be... that this description of Heidr (especially thelast lines) sounds strange in the mouth of the sibyl who isdeclaiming the poem. But in fact it demonstrates that the poet102 Re-evaluating the Witch-Queen"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"let his zeal override the thought of what would be the mostnatural thing for the sibyl to say. It was not only that Heidr hadan evil purpose among the Æsir, but also that sibyls andenchanters were already unpopular with many people in pagantimes.(Nordal 1978: 44–45)Jochens reads the phrase as indicative of late-Heathen misogyny:In the divine world, we now see evil associated with Gullveigand Heidr...the two new names stand for female being who areassociated with evil. Heidr may simply mean ‘witch.’ Gullveig,the personification of gold in female shape, brings into theworld the first war... As Heidr she offers magic to the gods, andher art is appreciated by ‘wicked women.’(1989: 353)The most problematic phrase is in the last lineillrar brudar.Brudr,literally ‘bride’, is glossed as a generalisation for ‘women’, actual,past or potential brides. Dictionary definitions (Zoëga 1910) ofillrgive (1) ill, evil bad; (2) hard, difficult (3) close, mean, stingy. Yet thesame dictionary glosses illprælias ‘wretched thrall’, thus introduc-ing another potential understanding of ‘illr’. Some of today’sIcelandic Heathens have suggested it be read as ‘wretched’ or‘unhappy’ (Jörmundur Ingi Hansen, pers. com.), giving the sense of‘unhappy young women’, or perhaps simply ‘unhappy people’.From this, Heidr becomes one bringing relief to people in need!The phrase may have had more than one interpretation, even atthe time of writing. I am attempting to understand meaning withincontexts of the political and material circumstances in which womenand men lived and had their being: semi-isolated farmsteads ofIceland or Norway or Scotland, the long dark of winter nights.Numerous commentators have pointed to a relative equalitybetween women and men, at least in terms of the household, at thetime of writing, but this equality was only partial, especially inareas in which power was being centralised with all the implicationsof hierarchical organisation of power implied thereby. In manycultures those with low levels of political power choose to usemethods of magic, identified as ‘witchcraft’ or ‘sorcery’, which maybe an attempt to influence events or bring about their wishes: theclaiming of power by those who have little. This is how Lewis (1989)Re-evaluating the Witch-Queen 103"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"describes instances of North African possession. The women whoare possessed acquire some social power thereby.Interpretation of interpretationPermit me, though, to position these understandings within adiscussion of interpretation. Anthropological narratives are full ofsuch accounts – some, though, highly problematic in bothdescription and interpretation where ‘European notions of ration-ality and the discourse of an often positivist science have been usedas a universal benchmark against which other cultures are judged’(Greenwood 2000: 39). Classical ethnography, interpreting ‘witch-craft’ in functionalist or structuralist terms of power-seeking andill-feeling in the community, has tremendous difficulty in dealingwith the effects of, for instance, shamanic healing ceremonies.In Anthropological writing, a Western ontology is still oftentaken for granted. When posing questions about experience, thepatterns of Euro-American ‘common sense’ resonate so subtlywith our working assumption that we fail to notice theircultural specificity.(Salmond 2000: 55)Western dominant assumptions reappear as categories: thedistinctions made not only between ‘witchcraft’ and ‘shamanism’,‘witchcraft’and ‘sorcery’,but between ‘possession’and‘shamanism’, being cases in point. (Lewis (1989) and others havepointed out that possession and shamanism may not be easilydistinguishable, or indeed distinguishable at all, in practices ofspecific societies or their ‘shamans’: but the distinction remainsin both popular and academic descriptions.) Alan Harwood (1970:xv) quotes definitions derived from Evans-Pritchard’s work:‘Witchcraft...is “a mystical and innate power, which can be used byits possessor to harm other people”. Sorcery, on the other hand, is“evil magic against others”.’ (Most often sorcery is believed toinvolve the use of ‘medicines’ to harm, in these studies.)These words, ‘witch’ and ‘sorcerer’ had their roots in dominantWestern discourses, both of ‘good’ and ‘evil’, and of ‘rationality’:‘witch’ then was used as referring to a practitioner of potentiallyevil magic, and so supplied it as a translation for whatever localterm ethnographers were presented with. Often word-meanings104 Re-evaluating the Witch-Queen"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"were gained first from other non-native personnel who had hadreason to gain a fairly close acquaintanceship with Native languages– such as Western missionaries, who would have their own reasonsfor decrying local spiritual practices and practitioners. In additionto this circularity of definition, classical anthropology tended toignore rapid changes taking effect in many societies studied, andtensions between colonial administrators’ views of how a societyshould be run and local traditional practice. Indeed, especially in asituation of rapid change, those with less power may well choosemagical means of bringing about results pleasing to them. Theseresults however need not be negative for the community as a whole,and not only those of low status engage in such practices. Theethnographic work of (for instance) Taussig (1987) or Kapferer(1997) indicates complexities of meaning constructed within politicaldimensions, with ‘magic’ used and experienced in multiple ways.Favret-Saada’s (1980) experiences in the Bocage indicate how muchthe interpreter/ethnographer becomes part of the multiplicity ofmeanings, and how those meanings are dependent on embedded-ness within events and discourse. Lines cannot easily be drawnbetween negative and positive magic. I have already indicated thatin saga accounts of seidr, we distinguish ‘positive’ from ‘negative’only in terms of who is telling the story, or who is its leadingcharacter.Multiple contested meanings need not relate only to the present.Who would be these ‘illrarbrides’? Wretched young women, evilsorceresses, people powerless (taking ‘brides’ literally) in a strangehousehold, scheming to strengthen their own position? Should webelieve, with Jochens, that by the time the verse was written,probably, as Grundy points out, by a poet with knowledge of bothHeathenism and Christianity, patriarchy had gone so far thatwomen who sought to further their own position were automatically‘evil’? This argument is not convincing to me. (Even if two or threehundred years later it might have more basis, it still seems toosweeping. Even in the mis-titled ‘burning times’ of ‘witchcraft’ trialsand accusations in parts of Europe, realities in any village weremore nuanced.)Another, speculative, interpretation might run as follows. Theprimary cause of death for young women, until the present century,was childbirth. Dread of childbirth included not only concernsabout dying (especially if close relatives had died in childbirth), butconcerns about labour, its duration and intensity, including fear forRe-evaluating the Witch-Queen 105"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"the child as well as fear for oneself. The Icelandic sagas, chieflyconcerned with matters of feud and politics and the doings ofmales, do not give details of difficult labours: but material dealingwith Icelandic Christianity recounts numerous instances of womenseeking reassurance regarding childbirth (Jochens 1995). When theoutcome of an event or process is uncertain and factors other thanskill are concerned in this outcome, people often have recourse tomagic to seek knowledge or to attempt to control events. It wouldbe indeed surprising if childbirth and reproduction were notareasassociated with magical practices. Ability to conceive and produce ahealthy child was prized. In some other societies a women’s positionwas not secure within a household until she had done so, thoughagain the sagas do not, to my knowledge at least, explore this area.Heidr being welcome to illrar brudarmight be read then as anassociation with bringing relief – whether of the pains of labour orthe uncertainty of a secure outcome, uncertainties of the ability toconceive and bear children, or all of these, is something that can beconjectured.Is Heidr a midwife?Most scholars consider that Gullveig, Heidr and Freyja refer to thesame Goddess.3Now, many Heathens speak of Freyja as a goddesswhom women asked for help in childbirth. Grundy points out(1996: 60) that ‘Only once, in Oddrúnargrátr, does she appear as apatroness of childbirth; a prayer to hold in giving birth calls on“kind wights/Frigg and Freyja/and many gods”.’ Further, if thispoem is late, the reference to ‘Frigg and Freyja’ may be an attemptto make the poem seem archaic and Heathen. A Christian poet maynot have known what goddesses would be called upon in childbirth,but put in the names of the two most important, or the first twothat came to mind. This cannot be regarded as evidence that Freyjawas indeed called upon to assist childbirth. However, there isanother, rather tenuous, link, indicated by Näsström, from thepoem Húsdrapa. Heimdallr recovers Freyja’s magical necklace,Brisingamen (which Näsström (1996a), connects with the shiningsea, and with Freyja’s name ‘Mardöll’). The jewel is referred to ashafnwraor sea-kidney (which Näsström (1996b) identifies as adehydrated palm fruit, conveyed from the West Indies by the GulfStream, with a brownish red colour, and associated in folklorewith fire), which Näsström finds was used in folk-medicine to106 Re-evaluating the Witch-Queen"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"facilitate deliveries, and in Iceland called lausnerstein(deliverystone, ‘loosening’ the baby from the mother).Evidence associating Freyja/Heidr with childbirth is thereforeunclear, though tantalising. The suggestion that Heidr is a midwife,whether magical or practical, remains purely speculative.In the meantime, some other intriguing possibilities remain. IfHeidr is concerned with reproduction – or with making suchreproduction possible – the concept of ‘empowering staff ’ may bereconsidered also. Some researchers have associated ‘staff ’ and‘penis’ (see Jochens 1996). (Could illrar brudarbe read as‘unsatisfied women’ whom Heidr could help?) Yet what I have readof these comments suggests Heidr as disempowering rather thanempowering, fitting the stereotype of the witch who renders menimpotent. One could say, however, that if Heidr, or her followers,had the one power – of arousing and maintaining desire – they mayalso have had the opposite power. One might think also of the spellwhich Gunnhildr was said to cast on her erstwhile lover, Hrútr,preventing genital sex with his wife Unnr through over-engorgement(Njáls saga,chapters 6–8).Five centuries after the likely date of composition of the poem,some European ‘witches’ were charged with causing impotence,miscarriages or the birth of children who were ‘imperfect’,preventing conception, and so forth.4Women who healed could besaid to have the power of harming;5women who assisted childbirth,mitigating its pains, were in the eyes of some churchmen thegreatest sinners of all. Yet even then the Scandinavian countrieswere on the periphery of the ‘witchcraze’, not its centre, with only afew instances (such as that of the ‘Blakulla’ trials in Sweden)showing the misogyny that seems to have been one factor amongothers, elsewhere. In other Northern countries, such as Scotland,witchcraft accusations came late, and were politically motivated.According to Hastrup (1990), Iceland did not have a true ‘witchhunt’ at all, and there, as in Finland, accusations were chieflyagainst males. Morris (1991) suggests that the ‘Icelandic sorceress’did continue to practice ‘witchcraft’ – seidr, midwifery, and folk-magic – but that this was not treated with the negativity which attimes suggestions of ‘magic’ received in parts of continental Europe.But when the collection of traditional poems to which the nameEdda became attached – including Völuspá– was rediscovered inthe seventeenth century, and even more when the stories and deedsof gods and heroes were lauded and romanticised in the nineteenth,Re-evaluating the Witch-Queen 107"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"circumstances were ripe for a reading of Gullveig/Heidr as the ‘evilwitch’, causing harm and sowing discord by her very being; andsuch readings have persisted up to the present day. Today, when oursociety appears to be more aware of contradictions and misogyny insome of its still-dominant narratives of women as evil, Heathensand scholars alike ponder the extent to which the Völuspápoet wasinfluenced by ‘Christian’ ideas, or to which ‘misogyny’ was part oflate-Heathen thought. Yet it seems to me that this debate is notnecessarily pertinent to the verse at issue here. The words werewritten in one era, and read and interpreted in others, throughfilters of the intervening periods. Nor do we know the extent towhich the verse might hold different meanings to different people,even at the time of its composition. For my own purposes, I preferto interpret the verse:Heidr she was calledwhen to houses she came,Völva well-foretelling,empowering staffs;Seidr she practisedSeidr with thought playing,Joy was she everto despairing women.The slant on Heidr thus given is in accordance with how sheappears to at least some Heathen practitioners today, and is onethat ‘makes sense’ to many women. It is not presented here asconclusive or as a scholarly glossing of the verse: that is not my fieldor my purpose. In the spirit of experiential anthropology, I haveexamined my own situation and the understandings that result fromit, reflexively, as a community practitioner, and attempted to showtheir construction. The community is divided on Heidr and hermeaning for today’s practitioners, and this is linked to the ways thatseidr as shamanic-magic is received and explained today.Women and magic, a continuing strand ofpractice?There have been suggestions that the practice of the völva, going tohouses, did not die out in Iceland, becoming instead modifiedwithin changing conditions of daily life.Icelandic lawcodes never included proscriptions specifically againstthe practice of the völva. Today, interpretations both of the lack ofsuch proscription, and the increasing targeting of male practice asunlawful, are disputed. To Jochens (1996), these indicate that men,108 Re-evaluating the Witch-Queen"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"including churchmen, took over practices ofspáand rune-work,with this divination becoming increasingly problematic. However,Morris (1991) implies that ‘seeking for knowledge’ in Icelandremained part of the complex of activities that were appropriate forand performed by women: it became problematic only when menpractised it, possibly (as I conjecture) for political reasons.Icelandic Ásatrú’s current Allsherjargodi, Jörmundur Ingi,indicated to me that women in Iceland maintained some of thepractices associated with seidr, often unthinkingly, as everydayactivities, gendered practice, simply things that women do in theirhouseholds and kitchens.I remember when I was a little kid living out in the country. . .the women would close themselves into the kitchen, to ah, to dosome things that they were whispering about, and the menwould simply keep away... and we were just little kids, wesometimes stayed in there, they didn’t bother with us. They weredoing some sort of little magic tricks which we didn’t know wasmagic and probably they didn’t know either ... from some signsor whatever, usually you know, whom they should marry orhow things should go and so on, and so they have been doing itall the time.The extent to which these activities would be considered seidrisof course debatable. The word covers a range of meanings, notnecessarily those of the Heathen period. Jörmundur, however,considers that women’s magical practice was continued, as part ofeveryday life. On occasion possible links with seidr or spá, couldbecome more evident, as with the coming of the ‘spiritualism’movement to Iceland in the ninetenth century, when, he says:...while this movement was sort of a fringe movement every-where else, it was here part of ah, high society. It wasintroduced into Iceland mostly by priests and lawyers...so rightfrom the start, it got a socially accepted stamp on it, it was thein thing, to be an adherent of this, and very strangely whathappened was that women would flock to this and all of asudden, you would have mediums, women, everywhere, and themost astounding thing about that was that the way they wereconducting these seances, what they were doing of course, wasthat you can read the story of the Völva, in the saga of EiríkRe-evaluating the Witch-Queen 109"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"the Red, and they held the ceremony exactly. So I have thetheory that women were doing this all through the Christianera, they were simply having little ceremonies like that withouteven realizing that this was religion. This was just somethingthat women did, and men didn’t interfere in.Again, interpretations of spiritualism, in Iceland as elsewhere,vary (see e.g. Swatos and Gissurarson 1996). Yet, the words for awoman who does this kind of magic, völva, vølve, have remained;or, as in Scotland, the spaewife. They are re-emerging to describetoday’s practice, whether drawn from core-shamanism as describedby Jakobsen (1999) and Lindquist (1997), or the reconstructions ofHrafnar and other Heathen groups, as discussed here. Dialoguebetween these constructed practices reveals considerable approach-ings, as each draws on the story of the Greenland Seeress, andbeyond that on the concept of the being who worked magic forÓdinn, at his request, to foretell the fate of the Æsir and the NineWorlds: and on the Well of Wyrd at the roots of Yggdrasill, theWorld Tree. Today’s practice is shared by men and women. TheScandinavian groups use the same word,vølve, to describe both,some reconstructionists preferring seidkonaand seidmadr. I turn,therefore, to contestations of gender and sexuality surroundingthose men, and women, who do seidr today: and to further debatesover the relationship of seid-practitioners to ‘the spirits’ and who orwhat those might be.110 Re-evaluating the Witch-Queen"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Ergi seidmen, queertransformations?Many of the accounts of seidr, as earlier indicated, are of womenpractitioners, to the extent that scholars and practitioners alikespeak of seidr as ‘women’s magic’.

In Hördaland there was a seidman who wascalled Vitgeirr; the king sent him a message and told him tostop making seidr. He replied and said:There’s no harmif we do seidr,children of ordinary menand ordinary women,when Rögnvaldrstraight-leg does seidr,Harald’s famous son,in Hadaland.And when Harald the king heard this, then by his advice Eiríkwent to the Uplands and came to Hadaland and burned hisbrother, Rögnvald, in his house with eighty seidworkers, andthis work was much approved.(Haralds saga hárfagra, chapter 36, my trans.)This event may be seen as part of political processes ofcentralisation of kingship, together with Eirík’s removing a closerelative who while unlikely to seek the over-kingship, might supportanother claimant among many half-brothers hoping to succeedtheir father. The later king Óláfr Tryggvason is also said to havecaused the death of eighty seidmenn, and while Snorri uses themasculine pronoun ‘peir’ for them, older sources seem to havedescribed them as including males and females (Jochens 1996:125);112Ergiseidmen, queer transformations?"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"the word menn(singular madr) meaning ‘people’. Here again it islikely that politics played as great a part as religion. (‘Eighty’probably indicates ‘a large number’, not a precise count.)There is little information about Rögnvald: he had a personalconnection with ‘Finns’ or Sámi; he performed seidr as part of alarge group of others involved in this practice; and his seidworkingwas not liked by his half-brother and father. One may speculatefurther on reasons for this dislike: Rögnvald’s ‘making seidr’ mayhave been viewed as permissive sanction for others’ seid-practices(as implied by the poem). Why Haraldr Finehair did not like seidrcan only be guessed: I have speculated that any form of shamanicpractice introduces unpredictable elements into political decision-making (unpredictable, that is, for those who do not themselvesspeak to ‘the spirits’) and suppression of shamanic activity can befound in Western colonising (and missionising) in North and SouthAmerica, and more recently Soviet suppression, with occasional co-opting, of Siberian practices. The shaman’s ‘reasons’ for advisingvarious courses of action are neither obvious nor explainableto those who, once again, do not themselves speak to the spirits.Shamanic activity is localised and predicated on local loyalties.There are, therefore, many reasons why those bent on extendingtheir spheres of influence might seek to obliterate local shamanismsand their practitioners, and why the local practitioners, adjustingtheir practice to changed political conditions, might at timesreinforce their ‘difference’ from the governing classes or powers (seee.g. Taussig’s (1987) discussions of nuanced adaptations of SouthAmerican practitioners) and at other times become part of the‘system’ for dealing with those unpredictabilities which were not sopolitically threatening – small-scale charms, the uncertainties ofchildbirth, weather and crops, etc.There seem to have been few attempts to examine the history of‘conversion’ to Christianity of North and West Europe as complexinterweavings of religion in the service of politics, possibly becausethe dominant assumption has been, until very recently, thatChristianity was on the whole ‘a good thing’, bringing progress,enlightenment, truth, justice and better treatment for women. Theconverse view that Christianity was responsible for bringing a floodof ills in its wake, including repression of sexuality, denial ofgoddesses, subordination of women, and leading eventually to theexcesses of capitalism and environmental degradation, is held bymany Pagans, including some Heathens and neo-shamanists today.Ergiseidmen, queer transformations? 113"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"It can be traced to nineteenth-century romantic movements, andreappears in much neo-pagan writing (see e.g. Markale 1986).Application of post-colonialist and discourse theory would tendto suggest more nuanced interpretation of specific, local practicesand events, within changing contexts of climate, power and tech-nology, and in situations where ‘boundaries’ between ‘cultures’ and‘religions’ are permeable, not fixed. Anthropology is producing newunderstandings of missionising and conversion elsewhere (e.g.Salmond’s (2000) account of missionaries and Maori), and it will beinteresting to see what relations of politics, religion, power andresistance emerge within the history of European conversion in thenext few years. As I am not a historian, I do not attempt to engagewith these historical processes, other than speculatively: my focus ison the construction of practice today, and I engage with the past tounderstand the present. Like other seidr practitioners, I amhandicapped in my search for meaning by a lack of nuancedinterpretations of the past. I therefore am here attemptingto provide a context for Rögnvald – and Vitgeirr – to understandthe complex meanings, including what appears as progressive‘demonisation’, surrounding men making seidr.The evidence of the sagasIn Gísla saga Súrssonar,‘Porgrímr hastened to his seidr and built ascaffolding and worked fjölkyngiwith all ergiand skelmiskáp(devilry)’ (chapter 10). Kotkell ofLaxdæla sagauses both seidr andgaldr (sung spells, often associated with rune-magic, and more oftenassociated with men): Kotkell builds a seidr-platform, ascends it,and with his sons chants galdr to raise a storm. Other malepractitioners are positioned as fjölkunnigr: an example being themagic-worker ofKormáks sagawho sleeps by the door and knowsthe business of everyone in the hall, a way to keep safe thosepresent.These accounts indicate that at the time of writing it was under-stood that men could, and had, engaged in seidr practices. But thereis no male equivalent to Porbjörg, or Pordís spákona, or Puridrswndafyllir. Men appear in the sagas engaged in shamanisticpractices, but this is rarely elaborated upon, and if called seidr(rather than útiseta) never positioned as ‘socially constitutive’. Theone detailed account of seidr by a male is of Ódinn, fromYnglingasaga.114Ergiseidmen, queer transformations?"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Odin could transform his shape: his body would lie as if dead,or asleep; but then he would be in shape of a fish, or worm, orbird, or beast, and be off in a twinkling to distant lands uponhis own or other people’s business ...

By means of this he could know beforehand thepredestined fate of men, or their not yet completed lot; and alsobring on the death, ill-luck, or bad health of people, and takethe strength or wit from one person and give it to another. Butafter such witchcraft followed such weakness and anxiety [ergi],that it was not thought respectable for men to practice it; andtherefore the priestesses were brought up in this art.(Heimskringla, trans. Laing 1844/Online Mediaevaland Classical Library (OMACL))Several points emerge from this account. It is not clear exactly whatis indicated by seidr. Some techniques of ‘faring forth’ are addressed,which seem to fit well with the accounts ofútiseta, discussed inchapter 4. Necromancy, calling the dead from the earth, is separatelydealt with. Ódinn could know, by means of seidr, the course ofpeople’s lives, and cause various things to occur – all, apparently,things benefiting him, not the recipient (except when this recipientreceives another’s strength) – but how this ‘seidr’ was done is notsaid. Finally, we are to understand that seidr was not appropriate formen because of the ergithat followed, and therefore was taught towomen. Snorri was writing 200 years after Christianisation, and thedevelopment of the concepts he incorporates is unclear: however, thetone of the passage adds to the general implication that seidr andthose engaging with it are dangerous, ambiguous – and that it wasgenerally performed by women. Additionally, the tone of thenineteenth-century translation used above – the translation mostaccessible to practitioners because it is available on the internet fromOMACL – indicates an unwillingness to deal with the concepts ofeither seidror ergi, which did not fit in with the romantic,nineteenth-century notions of a Viking ‘warrior god’.Jochens (1996) examines both older material (e.g.Völuspá) andlater material (e.g.Ynglingasaga) to suggest that seidr was initiallyErgiseidmen, queer transformations? 115"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"women’s magic, with its practice by men seen as problematic,effeminising or ergi(even for Ódinn), possibly because it includedfemale ‘receptive’ sexual activities.

Withoutnecessarily agreeing fully with Jochens that magic within Germaniccommunities was originally a female domain, appropriated by malesduring an increasingly patriarchal period prior to Christianisation,it is still possible to see gender and gender-constructing processes aspart of a dynamic marginalising of seidr. Jochens points to agradient from the respect with which the seeress Veleda appears tobe regarded, as described by Tacitus (Historia, book IV) todescriptions of female spell-workers in the Icelanders’ sagas (suchas Katla in Eyrbyggja sagaor Ljót in Vatnsdæla saga). In Jochens’view, this movement towards seeing female workers of magic – andmale workers of female magic – as ‘evil’ had occurred by the timethe Völuspáverse about Heidr, previously discussed, was composed.Men and seidr todayWe are back, then, with concepts relating seidr with women andambiguity. This has not escaped the attention ofthosereconstructing seidr today. Diana Paxson initially saw high-seatseidr as ‘something for the women to do’ while men were engagingin ‘playing Viking’. Men had competitive athletics, women hadmagic. But in today’s climate of equal opportunity, some womenengaged in ‘Viking games’, some men tried out the experience ofseidr – and experiencing something new and different, found acalling for themselves as seidworkers.Elsewhere, writers and shamanists were already exploring seidr.Bates’ (1983) The Way of Wyrddescribes a young cleric sent to (stillHeathen) southern England in order to find out about the ‘OldReligion’. Essentially coming as a spy, then, he meets a shaman andbecomes the shaman’s apprentice. The shaman’s activities arebased on the ‘charms’ in Old English texts, the Lacnunga andLeechbook (see Storms’ (1948/1975) Anglo-Saxon Magicfor textsand commentary). Bates’ novel influenced a number of men andwomen, notably in the UK.

They have derived their practices from theliterature, from merging basic Heathen or Pagan rites with moreobviously ‘consciousness-altering’ practices, or from using ‘shamanic’techniques derived from academic descriptions of shamanic prac-tice or basic neo-shamanism texts together with what is knownof rune-magic and meanings, within the cosmology of Wyrd,Yggdrasill and the Norns. Books such as The Well and the Tree(Bauschatz 1982) Runes(Elliott 1989), or Anglo-Saxon Magic(Storms 1948) are therefore among ‘source texts’ for would-be‘Northern Shamans’ who often look to Ódinn, or Woden, as ashamanic deity.So, people were practising ‘seidr’ before the development oforacular seidr by Hrafnar, or the adoption of ‘core-shamanism’techniques within Scandinavian, Saxon or more generally‘Northern’ cultural contexts. (Several of those who since receivedtraining from Hrafnar were constructing their own shamanistictechniques, or ‘talking to spirits’ before adopting the form of theoracular seidr.) Many of the individual workers of the past 25 yearshave been men. Malcolm, in Scotland, is an example: initiallytaught ‘Northern Shamanism’ by a Swedish ‘Tattare’ (tinker or‘gypsy’) practitioner in 1981, he says, ‘I call what I do seidr, becausethat’s what Sven called it’. His work today is a blend of Sven’steaching, what he learnt from Hrafnar workshops and manuals, andhis researches in literature and folk-practices.Bil, in the south-western US, has formulated his practice fromSámi teachings and personal research, owing little to Hrafnar orcore-shamanism.

Looking back I think theycame in stages or phases. They told me they were ‘remakingme.’ (I can think of a lot easier ways of getting remade,though.) Sometimes they came in my sleep. A lot of the timethey came when I was awake like images cast up on Saran Wrapin front of me (I still work that way, with my eyes open andbody moving).Some of them were ghosts of animals, trees, and herbs(most, I found out later, could change their appearance at will).They told me my luck was gone, was spent. My life was in theirhands. I asked them ‘What will you do if I fight it? Do thingsmy own way?’ They didn’t care; they were running the showanyway – they said ‘Go ahead. It won’t change a thing.’ Mypneumonia came to me on Dec. 18th at 3 PM and left on Sept.3rd (the following year) at around 3 PM. They informed methat medications were meaningless (I tried anyway); they wererebuilding me.

Bil’s work (see Linzie n.d.) involves ‘wholemaking’, workingin trance to reconcile people’s bodies and spirits: definitely affectingtheir lives.

They have read the material, they know the reputation, andask what are the implications ofergifor practice today.The ergiseidman?Some non-practitioners take the view that regardless of practices orideologies 1,000 years ago, today gender and sexuality should notmatter in the organisation of human activities, and hence thatquestioning links becomes dubious. An example is a recent letter tothe journal Pomegranatefrom a long-standing ‘Northern Tradition’leader in the Western US:There is no evidence that the practice of seidh makes you‘unmanly’ (neither does being gay for that matter – where haveyou people been for the last 20 years?). But because thesepractices involve being ‘possessed’, and since genuine posses-sion is virtually impossible to control (ask any Voodoo drummeror Pentecostal), there is plenty of evidence that you can be‘unmanned’ by these practices.For the difference between ‘unmanly’ and ‘unmanned’ pleaseconsult a dictionary.Any genuine psychic experience can ‘unman’ anyone (male orfemale), and being a man who embraces his anima is not goingto give you special dispensation to avoid this.(Priest 1999: 3)These comments touch on some central issues within seidr andshamanism, addressed within this book.1My point, however, is notwhether seidr makes male practitioners ‘unmanly’, but how seidr isexperienced by practitioners and by others in the community, forwhom it may be performed; how past interpretations – andreinterpretations of those interpretations – affect the discourse anddevelopment of seidr as shamanistic ‘performance’ today; and justpossibly, whether men have to become ableto be ‘unmanly’ in order120Ergiseidmen, queer transformations?"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"to practice seidr (a reversal of Ms Priest’s formulation). There areindeed indications that both men and women engaging with seidr,but particularly men, were viewed with suspicion in the past – andthat this ‘suspicion’ was expressed in terms decrying deviation fromthe hegemonic masculinity portrayed in the (later-written, post-Christianisation) sagas. Use of the term ‘ergi’ is notably explored inMeulengracht Sørensen’s (1983) work on nídand ergi(of which theEnglish title is The Unmanly Man).2The challenges have theirechoes in experiences related by men today who seek to justify theirpractices as they are creating them. But to appreciate this is toexamine the insertion of seidworkers into the discourses andpractices of their times – now or in the past.Much of today’s Western society remains homophobic. Heathenand Pagan culture is not immune from this homophobia, althoughsome sections of the alternative spirituality communities do attemptto consciously combat it. As Wallis (1999b) points out:Many Heathen neo-shamans in Britain and North America,in contrast to being ‘safe’ and ‘Westernised’, confront andchallenge conservatism both in Heathenism and wider society.Heathenism writ large is a conservative paganism with moral,ethical and spiritual values adhering to ‘middle’ England andAmerica. ‘Traditional’ family values are sacred and the issue ofsame-sex relations remains controversial.(Wallis 1999b: 207)Indeed, one British Ásatrú organisation holds as official policy that‘homosexuality’ is ‘anti-family’.Today’s seidworkers include gay and straight practitioners: forthem, in their practice, sexual orientation is not an issue. How seidrconnects with their community identity, however, is. Malcolm putsit thus:I’m playing around with the idea that male seidr-working maybe connected with loss of aggression, or potential for violence,and that this may be related to the meaning of ‘ergi’ ... I’m noIcelandic/Old Norse scholar, just someone who is trying to seeif his own experience corresponds to some apparently verycryptic statements about male seidr practice in the old material.. . .

The speaker was not attempting to preventthe practice of seidr: rather he was completely dissociating himselffrom it. It was ‘other’. His unwillingness to read anything thatmight relate to gay practices or identities extended to regarding anyuse of the words ‘homosexual’ or ‘gay’ as ‘flaunting’ of suchpractices: any discussion of non-hegemonic sexuality,or of seidr,thereby became suspect. Two years later, in 2000, during an emaildiscussion involving seidr and ergi, the list moderator had to issue astrong reminder that homophobic statements would not betolerated.Jordsvin, as a well-known gay seidworker, is on the receiving endof such comments: that Heathenism is not immune to thehomophobia of the wider society is evident from his experiences.I occasionally get bigoted rants via email, usually from youngmales high on testosterone and bravado, usually with blatanthomophobic content. Large sections of the Heathen com-munity really need some education on this matter.From these experiences, the situation of seidworkers withintoday’s society is not unproblematic. Seidr practices exist in tensionwith dominant discourses of suspicion against men who do ‘female’things, which permeate Heathen, as other, communities. For thosewho come to Heathenism as ‘a conservative paganism with moral,ethical and spiritual values adhering to ‘middle’ England andAmerica’, seidr is dangerous, problematic, with the seidworker as anambiguous figure: a ‘seeress’ can be romanticised, but men who do‘women’s work’ are difficult to reconcile with the model of theindependent ‘Viking’. Hence the ‘rants’ received by Jordsvin. So,here, I look further at relations of present and past, how today’sHeathens weave a strand connecting the two, tendencies to viewboth seidmen and seidwomen with some ambivalence, and, notleast, how ergibecomes a way of relating to the worlds, ‘a process ofidentity and a means of dissonantly ‘queering’ the perceived socio-spiritual norms of the present and the past’ (Blain and Wallis,forthcoming).122Ergiseidmen, queer transformations?"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Ergior argras insultFirst, a look at the verses in whichergiis most evident – andmost well-known among today’s Heathens. In Lokasenna, Loki hasarrived, uninvited, at a feast. He proceeds to insult other gods andgoddesses, who return the favour (until Thor arrives, late, and usesforce rather than words to expel him). During the exchange betweenÓdinn and Loki, each uses the epithet argrof each other. Opinionson interpretation differ.(Ódinn says). . . eight winters you were, beneath the earth,a woman milking cows,and there you bore children,and that I thought was argr.(Loki says)But you once practised seidr on Samseyand you beat on the drum as witches do (völor, volvas,seeresses)in the likeness of a wizard (vitki)you journeyed amongmankindand I thought that showed an argnature(Lokasenna, 23 and 24, based on Larrington 1996: 88–9)3Another god, Njördr, refers to Loki as an ás ragur(translated byLarrington 1996: 90 as ‘pervert god’) who has given birth to children.One interpretation is that the accusation against Loki, relatingspecifically to sexual activity, gives a meaning for argrof becomingsexually ‘female’. (In one story from Snorri’s Edda, Loki became amare, and bore a foal; the story of being a woman for eight wintersis not known.) This interpretation implies sexual contact, ‘passive’or ‘receptive’ homosexuality, suggesting that Ódinn also had engagedin ‘receptive’ sexual practices. The counter-argument is that argrrefers not to one specific set of behaviours, but more generally topractices not within the normative ‘masculine’ repertoire. Loki didsomething ‘not masculine’ (giving birth, milking cows) and Ódinndid something also ‘not masculine’ (performing seidr, beating adrum, journeying as a vitkior sorcerer, activities associated in thisculture with women). This distinction, therefore, is between sex andgender practices.The words ‘passive’ and ‘receptive’, in this discourse, requireErgiseidmen, queer transformations? 123"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"consideration. They are today’s words, and imply a direct equationof homosexual practice with a model of heterosexuality that isheavily reliant on ‘active male, passive female’ constructions:a twentieth-century psychological/psychoanalytic elaboration ofnineteenth-century ideas about womanhood, severely critiqued fromfeminist and queer theory approaches today (see, for example,Butler 1993). But they remain part of the discourse of bothacademics and Heathens who read these passages: part of a general,partly institutionalised, assumption of heterosexuality as ‘natural’,homosexuality ‘deviant’, and of male and female ‘normal’ hetero-sexualities as distinct, based in character traits that are biologicallyrelated directly to XX or XY chromosome combinations. However,queer theory approaches can point to the ‘constructed’ nature ofallsexualities, diversely socially sanctioned within specific cultures –thus giving other readings ofergi, in contexts of changing times anddiverse styles of masculinities or femininities, whether in present orpast. I shall return to this point later in this chapter.Initially, it may be more useful to regard ergias primarily aninsult, that can be used to convey the meaning (pejoratively) of‘homosexual’ or of ‘acted upon sexually’, or simply ‘coward’,without specifying any of these.Ergiapplied to women is mostoften read as ‘sexually promiscuous’ (Meulengracht Sørensen1984), but can be construed as ‘taking the initiative sexually’. In thissense Freyja is ergi(Høst, pers. com.).Classic examples of such insults, between men, occur in the firstpoem of Helgi Hundingsbani (in the Poetic Edda), in which twowarriors – Sinfjotli and Gudmund – engage in a ‘flyting’ or insult-battle: giving detailed and contextualised descriptions of the otherwarrior: castrated by Thurs-women, daughter of a Troll-woman,milking goats, a mare for a horse, performing the work of slaves,being sexually ‘used’ by the speaker – and, paralleling Loki’s insultto Ódinn, being a völva.4The whole draws on discourses of gender,sexuality and status current at the time of composition, in ways thatare stylised and specific to the ‘flyting’ genre within which the poetwas working, and hence indicating the most deadly of insults thatone man could give another – or at least a twelfth-century concep-tion of the ‘deadly insults’ of an earlier period, used for purposes ofentertainment and education. For let us not forget that these arepoems, told for the poet’s own purposes which one presumesincluded getting some response (such as shock or laughter) from theaudience.124Ergiseidmen, queer transformations?"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"The words argrand ergido not occur in these insults: rather, thecontext of the ‘insult’ verses can be summarised using them.

And this is how ergiis interpreted bysome of the men who perform seidr today. Bil says (also quoted inBlain and Wallis 2000):There is no reason to doubt that homosexuality existed at thetime of the Vikings and that, at least, ‘effeminism’ andcowardice were two character traits which were frowned uponand that both were lumped into the category of ‘ergi.’ Also, it isfairly easy to tell that the seventh to twelfth-century Norsemanused the term as an insult. True connections between the terms‘ergi’ and ‘seid’ are speculative at best.I think that an in-depth study of ‘the practice of insults’might be in order. It would seem . . . insults were not only toforce the emotional hand of the insulted but were also (for thirdparties) 1) fairly common, 2) often involved sexual innuendoes,3) contained a small grain of truth wrapped up inembellishment, and 4) rhetorically misdirecting leading thelistener to make a character judgement based either on theembellishment rather than the ‘grain of truth’ or to make analtogether incorrect assumption about the insulted.Malcolm, practising in Scotland, relates that the word argiis stillused there today.I can remember the context of two uses. First was one where Iwas challenged (aged 15 or so) to fight someone, and refused,Ergiseidmen, queer transformations? 125"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"and was accused of being ‘argi’... Oddly, when backed into acorner, dealing with it by throwing the attacker into a puddle,and refusing to ‘give him a good kicking’, was still considered‘argi’.

My relatively non-violent solution was considered‘argi’, just as failure to fight at all was.The second situation was when I was in a village talking tosomeone much later in life (in my 20’s or so), and hearing ayoung man spoken of as ‘argi’ because he asked the police todeal with a threat against his sister, instead of dealing with itpersonally.‘Argi’ here apparently implied ‘coward, unmanly, not using theresources men are expected to use’. Within a context of present-dayHeathenry, such terms carry mixed messages, positioning speaker orreferent within discursive contestations of gendered identity,sexuality and power.Ergimay still be used as an insult; alternativelyit may be used by a practitioner to try to uncover, or explain, themeaning of his (or indeed her) own seid-work or the ways in whichthe practitioner’s identity is changing or developing: hence, itbecomes part of the vocabulary of some members of the seidrcommunity, to indicate a perception of potential for comm-unity/seidr involvement. In this sense, the ergiperson is one whomoves between the worlds, deliberately transforming ‘self ’ in specificrelationships with people and other beings: not necessarily gay, butcertainly ‘queer’ in the sense in which Wallis (2000: 253) uses thisterm to describe neo-shamanism, following Halperin (1995: 62) insaying ‘queer’ is ‘by definition whateveris at odds with the normal,the legitimate, the dominant’. To examine this, I will furtherinvestigate some of the comments of today’s seidmen, beforeconsidering theories of shamanisms and gender, and returning topolitical dimensions of practice.Ergias seidr practiceThis conception of ‘queerness’ returns us to the practice of seidrtoday, and the experiences of the seidworker.

Many seidworkers, and other shamanistic practitioners, pointout that this involves a loss of ‘ego’ or an abnegation of self or ofprivilege. Bil, and others, relate this to the concept ofergi.My sexuality is heterosexual. I was never approached by theghosts who follow me to change that in any way. I was, however,severely ‘lambasted’ for carrying too much of a ‘machoattitude’ and was forced to make many changes in that area – somuch so, that folks often wonder, now, if I am homosexual ornot. . . My eccentricity doesn’t stem from sexuality or sexualpreference but mainly from the fact that I have no emotionalreactions any longer (I have emotions; I just don’t demonstratereaction with them, that’s all).(Bil)Personally, I resonate with what Bil is saying, to an extent. I doreact less than most people, very much so...Perhaps this isbecause emotion is so important to the seidr work I do. It’s likethe fuel for the tools I use, so maybe I’m conserving it?(Malcolm, discussing Bil’s statement,taken from Blain and Wallis 2000)Jordsvin, though, suggested that ‘gay men may have anadvantage in practising seidr, that they may be more ‘called’ to it, bea little better or learn it a little easier’. It has been noted that peoplewho are marginalised within their society are in a position wherethey must attend to levels of meaning that escape from, or that arenot obvious to, those privileged by dominant discourses: indeedmuch feminist scholarship points to those in disprivileged positionsdeveloping multiple ways of understanding the world. DorothySmith’s (1987) ‘bifurcated consciousness’ comes to mind.Thus, in indicating how he came to be a seidman, Ybjrteir toldme that (after communicating with spirit-beings as a child):Then puberty came! I wanted to fit in, so I learned to wear twoselves – the part of me that I kept hidden that could talk withand see other things and the part of me that I showed to myparents and friends at school. ... at high school I was a greatstudent, played sports, had girlfriends; while, at the same time Ihad other abilities and that I was Gay. This is the beginning oflearning how to switch forms back and forth.Ergiseidmen, queer transformations? 127"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Those who are marginalised may draw on their specific under-standings in ways that elude those in more privileged positions. If intoday’s society, women and gay men are more used to dealing withmultiple understandings of social relations, and interpreting oneunderstanding in terms of another, this may constitute anadvantage in shamanistic practice. But it is also an overt politicalpositioning, relating to processes of secular, as well as spiritual,power, and to attempts to claim locations – identity politics existingwithin a Western perceived need to categorise and name practiceand theory, as recognition is given only to that which is categorised.The Western term ‘homosexual’ is recent. Foucault (e.g. 1980aand b) points to the nineteenth-century invention of ‘homo-sexuality’ as a social construct, a way of labelling personalawareness of sexuality, and of categorising and pathologisingpeople while institutionalising specific kinds of heterosexualities:creating therefore a category of pathological ‘deviance’ and anormative system of binary opposition. The term then becamecentrally part of the conscious awareness of people generally, ameasure of social acceptance and a major identity focus. Itbecomes, now, difficult for either practitioners or researchers tounderstand seidworkers or ergiwithout reference to today’scategories: a difficulty that has plagued other accounts of multipleor alternate genders, notably understandings of ‘berdache’ or ‘two-spirit’ practitioners in North America. Likewise, Herdt (1996: 24)points also to ‘misinterpretation and labelling in the third-genderroles of Polynesia from the time of Captain Cook to the present’.Simply put, it becomes hard for Westerners to see sexuality as partof nuanced social relationships, informing all relationships (notonly those which are overtly ‘sexual’) in siting and shaping ‘selves’.In the case of seidr, too, the relationships formed are not only withother humans but with those ‘spirit’ figures that are equally difficultfor researchers to deal with. Seidworkers, therefore, are anomalousfigures, working within a broad cultural framework in whichdominant discourse rejects concepts of ‘the spirits’ or ‘deities’, andyet within specific contexts or learning paths where spirits or deitiesare the teachers. Within indigenous shamanic practice, the shaman’sspirit ‘helpers’ may indicate possibilities or work to be done, set thepace and give directions. Western society rewards male autonomy,and there are issues here of suspension of control. In accordancewith indigenous shamans, and in contrast to Western society’sexpectations of them, these seidmen give accounts of working with128Ergiseidmen, queer transformations?"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"spirits and relinquishing ‘control’. These experiences compare withanthropological descriptions of shamanic practice – texts withwhich seidworkers are familiar.So, some seidworkers, male and female, have suggested that inthe past,ergimay not always have been an insult; and further, that itcan be used to describe the state of ‘making seidr’ or an orientationto the Nine Worlds that enables seidr. This is connected with themultiple gendering of shamanisms elsewhere, and it is to this that Iturn next.Many genders or ‘changing ones’?Many researchers have attempted a theoretical understanding ofshamanism as incorporating an ability to move between ‘realities’generally considered ‘male’ or ‘female’. The ‘third gender’ conceptas introduced by Czaplicka is that ‘Socially, the shaman does notbelong either to the class of males or to that of females, but to athird class, that of shamans’. She indicates that by clothing or ritualobservance (‘taboos’), Siberian shamans might by incorporatingcharacteristics of both males and females hold an in-betweenlocation. However, she continues: ‘Sexually, he may be sexless, orascetic, or have inclination of homosexualistic character, but he mayalso be quite normal’ (Czaplicka 1914: 253) which, while indicatinga distinction between ‘gender’ and ‘sex’ that more recent researchershave found useful, also re-essentialises a two-sexed Euro-centric ‘normality’ of binary opposition, repositioning all other‘inclinations’ as deviant. Czaplicka’s ‘third class’ thereby appears asone in which the shaman is privileged to engage in ‘deviance’: whichcould be a suitable description of how ‘shamans’ (and at timespoets, artists, and others who engaged with a reality outside that ofnormative everyday experience) were regarded by early twentiethcentury European society, but not very convincing when applied todescriptions of practitioners.Applying a ‘third gender’ concept to research among the Inuit,Saladin d’Anglure sees shamans existing ‘on the border betweensexes/genders’ (1992: 148). His ternary or triple model is based inInuit descriptions of the changeability of gender: not somethingfixed at birth, but something ‘unstable and changeable’ (147) andrather than adopting Czaplicka’s ‘in-between’ third gender, hisculturally specific model indicates a third sex/gender dimensionErgiseidmen, queer transformations? 129"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"shown at right angles to a male/female axis and involving spiritualcomponents different from those associated with either ‘females’ or‘males’ within Inuit constructions of gender.The most familiar term for the ‘third gender’ practitioner is‘berdache’, indicated in a number of studies of Native NorthAmerican and other ‘shamans’ or ‘medicine people’: often critiqued(Epple 1998) but used despite or because of the plethora of specificcultural names, e.g. the Zuni llamana(Roscoe 1991), Navahonádleehi(Epple 1998), Mohave hwame-and ayaha-(Roscoe 1996),for those who occupy third- or fourth-gendered locations withintheir respective cultures. Some ‘berdaches’ themselves use the word,others seeing it as a remnant of colonialism prefer ‘two-spirit’.However, while the terms are used often of shamans, it is clear fromdescriptions given by anthropologists and two-spirit practitionersthat the two-spirit very often, perhaps usually, are not themselvesengaging with altered states of consciousness as shamans, althoughholding specific responsibilities to both human and spirit worlds.However, the institutionalisation of two-spirit locations within anumber of cultures (male berdaches documented in 150 NorthAmerican Native nations, female in half that number (Roscoe1996)), together with expressed negativity towards seidfolk andother shamanistic practitioners from cultures in which a binary,heterosexual gender duality is institutionalised, indicates that somequestioning of the commonly accepted models and linkages of sex,gender and altered consciousness is in order, and that the socialrelations surrounding the two-spirit may shed some light on the argrseidmadr.Roscoe attempts a multi-gendered model. He finds the concept of‘gender-crossing’ to be wanting, pointing to berdache status asmulti-dimensional, and saying that ‘the most reliable indicators ofberdache status were its economic and religious attributes and notgender or sexual difference alone’ (1996: 335). He locates femaleand male berdache ‘roles’ as third and fourth genders, and abstractsfrom North American instances a model of ‘minimal conditions’enabling berdache social relations to develop, relating to gendereddivision of labour; a belief system in which anatomical sex isconceptualised as ‘unstable, fluid and nondichotomous’ and inwhich gender is not determined by anatomical sex; and ‘theoccurrence of historical events and individuals motivated to takeadvantage of them in creating and shaping gender identities’ (1996:371). He further hypothesises that:130Ergiseidmen, queer transformations?"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"for a given society in which multiple genders were present, itwould take not only the elimination of the economic dimensionof such statuses but a lapse in the belief systems rationalizingthem and the introduction of a dual-sex ideology to effect a fullcollapse of such roles(Roscoe 1996: 372)Questions arise whether the society that produced seidr can beconceptualised as one in which a multi-gendered worldview wasbreaking down within the kind of situations Roscoe hypothesises,and whether the reinvention of seidr and other western‘shamanisms’ today are enabled by reassessments of gender andsexuality. Further, there is another dimension in applying thisalready multi-dimensional model to shamanistic practitioners,which is that of the spirit-connections of seid-practitioners now andin the past and ways in which these also are ‘gendered’.One researcher attempting a queer theory approach to theconcept ofergiis Solli, who refers to the Ynglingasagapassageabout Ódin’s seidr, seeing tension between Ódinn as ‘warrior’s god’and as argr seidmadr, the ‘unmanly performer of seid’ (Solli 1999a:342). Her resolution is through a third-gender concept, examiningvarious discussions of gender location. Among these is Czaplicka;yet Czaplicka, as I have indicated, appears to employ a frame of(more or less fixed) male ways of being, (more or less fixed) femaleways of being, with the shaman being ‘allowed’ from the first intothe second. It may be that a more fluid using of these concepts ispossible, without imputing a doubtful monolithic unity to ‘OldNorse’ culture, over generations, even centuries. This Solli impliesin seeing ‘shamanism [as] . . . also the technique of transformation’(1999a: 345).Transformation, though, applies to society as well as shaman.There is a need to understand Odin’s ‘gender status’ constructedwithin changing political/spiritual environments, and a need to lookat how we ‘know’ about Ódinn. Solli views him bridging betweenÆsir and Vanir (seeing Vanir as fertility/earth gods, Æsir as war/skygods, a view shared by some Heathens though not all) with, asaforesaid, tensions in the literature between Ódinn as ‘warrior’s god’and seid-practitioner. Yet as Grundy (1995) indicates, Ódin’sassociation with war or battle may be connected not with his own‘masculinity’ or abilities in war, but his status as death-god. As giverof death, he is giver of victory to the side with fewer dead. TheErgiseidmen, queer transformations? 131"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"association ofdeath, ancestors and seidr/shamanism runsthroughout the material, including the passage where he hangs onthe tree Yggdrasill, thereby gaining knowledge of the runes.5Each part of the material was written within a context, from thatof court poets praising patrons who traced descent from Ódinn,to that of the thirteenth-century politician Snorri Sturluson andhis systematisation of the material. A dynamic treatment of theliterature locates it within specific relations constitutive of ‘male’and ‘female’ practices, themselves fluid over time (and withoutuniversal meanings even at any given time). Within this fluidapproach, multiple genders in the ninth or tenth century may havebeen ‘othered’ by the thirteenth, in a religio-political scene that wasnot leaving much room for shamanistic understandings (or indeedfemale and non-hegemonic-male understandings).Solli (1999a) suggests evidence for ‘third gender’ of seidworkersfrom a verse in the Shorter Völuspá, in the poem Hyndluljód.Translated, this gives:All the völvas are from Vídólfr (Wood-wolf)all the vitkis from Vilmeidr (Wish-tree)the skilberendr(or seidberendr) from Svarthöfdi (Dark-head)the giants all come from Ymir.6The poem purports to give the family descent of a person, Óttarr,with the insertion of genealogical information about the gods, andthis peculiar verse which Solli interprets as about seid-makers:female völvur, male vitkar, and seidberendurwho are third gender,‘two-spirit’.Seidberenduris usually translated ‘seidmen’, but themeaning of ‘berendr’ is, says Solli, ‘a very coarse word for femalegenitalia in old Norse’ (1999a: 344). Seidwoman and historianGunnora Hallakarva had earlier alerted me to this word, indicatinga legal proscription (from the Gulapinglawcode) against the use ofthe word berendiof men.‘... Item three: if a man compare another man to a mare, or callhim a bitch or a harlot, or compare him to any berendi’.Berendiis used to indicate a female animal, one which bears young,though the narrow sense of the word is used to refer ‘to thesexual parts of a female animal, particularly a cow’, and thereare examples of it in this sense in Swedish and Danish dialects.It is derived from the verb bera, ‘to give birth’.(Hallakarva, pers. com., citing Ström 1974: 9 fn. 3)132Ergiseidmen, queer transformations?"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Like ergi, the word, then, would be an extreme insult. Yet, thederivation from ‘bera’ may also imply a seidworker actively givingbirth to the seidr; which concurs with Gunnora’s further statementthat ‘to me the term seidberendr evokes a sense of “bringing seidrforth from within oneself ”’.Additionally, rather than implying female, male and two-spiritseidworkers, the verse may refer to three types of magic (and theirpractitioners). Particularly, a vitkiengages in spoken spells or rune-work, and in notes to Sigurdsson’s edition is interpreted asgaldramadur (Sigurdsson 1998: 402, also reading seidberendurliterally as ‘peir sem fremja seidr’, those who make seidr). A readingof three types of magic may give a völva’s seeing-magic, notnecessarily with spirit-intervention;galdra-magic using spokencharms or runes; and seidr-magic. Yet this in turn may be read asmore nuanced, with gradation from respected seeresses, suspectedrunic magicians, shunned and insulted seidworkers, and to concludethe verse, giants who all come from Ymir. A gendered distinctionhere need not be that of three types of seid-practitioners.Völvaimplies a woman;vitkia male rune-worker; yet seidberendurneednot in itself be specific, perhaps implying further possibilities –potentially linking gender and magic with action, agency,performance, bringing forth, as Gunnora suggested, from withinoneself. (I am not disputing Solli’s reading of ‘seidberendur’ as anoffensive term, but suggesting further room for investigatingambivalence, in present or past.)Agency leads to the question of both gender and shamanism asperformativity, active accomplishment of meaning: gender does notreside in biological sex, neither is it confined by binary oppositionof ‘roles’ which can be breached only because the shaman has a sortof cultural permission to do so. ‘Gender performativity’ (see e.g.Butler 1990) implies gender as doing, creation, meanings activelyaccomplished by shaman and community rather than transgressionof fixed boundaries.7Gender and sexuality are actively constitutedwithin, and constitutive of, specific sets of social relations, which forthose practising seidr today include spirit as well as humancommunities: and many differing relations can be so constructed.Experiences and constructions within altered-consciousness statesshape practitioners’ understanding of ‘self ’, gender included: wheregender is fluid, malleable and changeable, and practitioners of seidrfind their lives transformed in many ways by the experiences theyundergo. These experiences include, as shown in chapter 4, meetingsErgiseidmen, queer transformations? 133"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"and negotiations with diverse spirits, possibly involving levels ofspirit or deity-possession. Thus for ‘James’:seidr focuses on both ‘male’ and ‘female’ deities, Woden andFreyja, in rituals of possession. The rituals also involve spiritcreatures, including two lynxes, and a berdache. With thesehelpers my experience transcends conventional understandingsof gender. At times it can be described as experiencing female,or male, or both. It is sometimes difficult to express how theexperience is gendered. This is something I am still learning tocome to terms with, explain and interpret.I think many people (especially men) would find seidrdisturbing because of how it makes them feel (apart from theradical change into shamanic consciousness), going beyondstereotypes of male, female, gay, etc. For me, seidr with Freyjaallows an integrating understanding of what it is to be male,female and other, multiple possibilities. That is empowering andaffects how I live with my reality, world, local and spiritualcommunities. It changes who I am.(Taken from Blain and Wallis 2000)Some have questioned whether possession is found in the oldliterature. Paxson thinks that it can be found, offering as anexample the story of Gunnar Helming in the Story of ÖgmundDytt,who ‘impersonates’ the god Freyr. Gunnar, having fallen outwith Norwegian king Óláfr Tryggvason, goes to Sweden where hemeets a priestess (gydja) travelling the countryside with a wagoncontaining the god Frey’s statue, who is spoken of as Frey’s wife.Gunnar goes into the wagon to fight Freyr, takes his place in thewagon, travels with the gydja, and the people are delighted that notonly can ‘Freyr’ now walk around, eat and make merry, but thecrops grow better than ever before, and Frey’s wife is pregnant. Theking, hearing about this, sends Gunnar a message that he can returnhome, which he does bringing his priestess-wife. Paxson considersthis story may be read as indicating the possibility of a personbecoming possessed by the god, letting the god speak through himwhen needed.The story holds several possibilities: a reading of ‘possession’implies the priestess may travel with a ‘shaman’ (Gunnar’s fight withFreyr being a fight with the previous shaman) who acts as thevehicle for god-possession. Alternatively, I suggest ‘Frey’s wife’ can134Ergiseidmen, queer transformations?"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"be read in light of Siberian spirit marriage (see e.g. Eliade 1964):Perhaps the shaman-gydja has a spirit-spouse, Freyr, and a human-spouse, Gunnar. Writing for a Christianised audience, though, thewriter implies that if Freyr is said to speak, this is either (demonic)magic applied to the statue, or Gunnar’s impersonation, rather thanthe gydja relaying Frey’s messages. As Wallis (forthcoming, a)points out, these explanations need not be in conflict.8I have introduced this story to indicate some of the complexitiesinvolved in spirit-relationships, and different ways in which thesecan be interpreted depending on the narrator’s location andperspective. Further, in ‘spirit-spouse’ situations, the gendering ofthe ‘spouse’ need not be obvious: introducing further complexity,but reaffirming that relationships constructed in both spirit andhuman worlds take their own forms.In reading the mediaeval material, today’s participants recognisethat it was largely written by those for whom, for whatever reason,the seidworker was ‘other’. Just how much ‘other’ is what I nextconsider, exploring a suggestion that the ‘exotic’ or shunned natureof seidr is due not to ‘third gender’ locations of practitioners, but toits ‘foreign’ origin.Seidr as a Sámi borrowing?Dubois (1999) uses seidr as an example of practices which, in hisview, entered the cultural complex from elsewhere to becomeassimilated, modified and adapted (in my paraphrasing) as partof the conceptual/magical apparatus available within Heathenry/Heidni. He contrasts this adaptation of seidr with the coming ofChristianity, in which the initiators, converts or priests, did not seekto merge Christian and non-Christian practices, but went to somelengths to avoid incorporating pre-Christian understandings andactivities.Seidr thus demonstrates a dynamic process of religiousexchange operating in the Viking Age in which individual ritualelements – and sometimes even practitioners – crossed culturaland economic lines, becoming reinscribed within the worldviewof the recipient community. Seidr replicated strongly shamanicrituals among Sámi and Balto-Finns, but it also becameassimilated into the preexisting repertoire of religious practicesand mythology operating among Scandinavian pagans. ThisErgiseidmen, queer transformations? 135"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"assimilation effected its own substantive changes on thetradition, rendering it a new entity, the product of religioussyncresis.(Dubois 1999: 137)Earlier, Dubois states that ‘Seidr practitioners are frequentlydepicted as foreigners, people with Sámi or Finnish connections or(more rarely) links to the British Isles’ (1999: 128). The specifics ofseidr and hamfarir– journeying in other shape – are associatedwith ‘foreign’ practitioners, particularly Sámi or ‘Finns’, andoccasionally Hebrideans. It may be that specific practices andpractitioners are imports. However, the framework within whichthey are described is one in which most people accept the practices,and in which an animist world-view seems to have been quiteprevalent. Indeed Dubois says as much: a range of spirits could befound in rocks, trees, waterfalls, houses, natural features or artefacts,within Nordic, Anglo-Saxon, Finnish, and Sámi beliefs andpractices. Offerings to Dísirand other clan spirits point to a focuson ancestors, and the concept of the fylgja, the following spiritattached to one's self at birth, provides another of the componentsassociated with an animist world-view. Therefore while it seemslikely that components and practitioners of Sámi shamanismmigrated into ‘Nordic’ practice, it seems to me that the developmentof ‘seidr’ cannot be viewed only as a Sámi loan, howeverassimilated. Shamanic practice elsewhere, as previously noted, iscreative and adaptive; seidr practitioners would develop and changetheir practice, within specific socio-historic circumstances, inassociation with Sámi practice and within regional constructions ofgender accomplishment. Sámi practitioners, described in (e.g.) thetwelfth-century Historica Norwegiaeand recent ethnographicaccounts (Pentikaïnen 1984), were as Dubois says mostly male,though often with female assistants; the seidworkers of the sagaswere generally female. (There may even be a connection with Norsewomen training as ‘assistants’ to Sámi, but practising in their ownright and their own way (Blain and Wallis 2000).) Evidence forindigenous practitioners comes from ‘Viking age’ burials wherestaffs, similar to those described for seeresses, have been found.Price (2000 and in press) details numerous sites in Scandinavia inwhich either staffs have been identified, or objects previouslyotherwise classified may be re-interpreted as ‘shamanic’ staffs,9sometimes associated with other ‘shamanic’ items such as a136Ergiseidmen, queer transformations?"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"talisman pouch at Fyrkat containing bones of small mammals andbirds, and henbane seeds. Most are from burials identified as thoseof women, but one in Norway is of a man, and in several others noattribution has been made, or the staffs are not in a burial context.Importantly, many of these burials appear to indicate high status:however their doing of ‘seidr’ may have been viewed, these were notmerely marginalised practitioners of a ‘foreign’ art.Rather, the claimed ‘foreign-ness’ of many practitioners, in thesagas, may be read as the author’s distancing him or herself fromsuch ‘queer’ practices: practitioners are ‘othered’ by description asSámi or Hebridean, just as they are ‘othered’ by having the saga‘hero’ positioned in disbelief, or as Quinn (1998) indicates, showingdistaste by ignoring the seer’s advice or warning (which is, however,later borne out by events). Earlier shamanic/shamanistic practice isalso suggested by the burial described by Hjørungdal (1989) fromHordaland in West Norway, which included a wooden staff hypo-thesised to be that of a seeress, dated to around 550 CE(IngegerdHolland, pers. com.) several hundred years before Rögnvaldr and hiscolleagues were burnt out by the king who did not like seidr.10In indicating a context of shamanistic awareness withinNorthern and Western Europe generally, we can go back furtheryet. Coles (1990, 1998) interprets wooden figures found from theNeolithic to the Iron Age in terms of shamanism and under-standings of gender and ambiguity: in this she suggests possibilitiesof ‘links with Scandinavian rock art, with the north-westernEuropean bog-bodies, and with the god Odin of northernmythology’ (1998: 164). She suggests links between the wood fromwhich the figures are made, and gender: there are clearly-malefigures of oak, a clearly-female figure of alder, and several of yew orpine which are ambiguous, thus giving yet another slant to latergendered practices. She draws on material from Siberian shamanisms(Anisimov 1963) in which such wooden figures are described. In theambiguous yew-wood figures she sees a possible association with (orprecursor to) Yggdrasill and Ódinn. While this is, once again,speculative, the combination of the wood and gendered ambiguityis at least suggestive – particularly when it is added that severalyew-wood figures (with date ranges 2351–2139 BCE1096–906 BCE,606–509 BCE; Coles 1998: 164) appear to be one-eyed.What these and other assorted pieces of evidence may indicate issome sort of indigenous shamanic practice across Northern Europewith, one presumes specific local patterns, associated with genderErgiseidmen, queer transformations? 137"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"ambiguity, developing gradually within later ‘Norse’ contexts andwith considerable Sámi input into the various strands of seeing,hamfarirand protective or attacking magics, all requiring some sortof alteration of consciousness and communication with spirits, thatcame eventually to be associated with seidr– not as monolithic‘Northern Shamanism’ or a single ‘ritual form’, but as sets oflinked, complex practices possibly undertaken by different practi-tioners within communities. It remains entirely possible thatelements such as the use of the seid-platform were relatively recentadaptive ‘borrowings’, indeed part of a ‘dynamic process of religiousexchange’ and ‘decentralised, circulating flow and exchange ofreligious ideas’ (Dubois 1999: 137), the flow being multi-directional.However, to me it seems likely that ‘cultural’ boundaries and‘worldview’ were less sure, more permeable than earlier accountsassumed, meanings and ‘performance’ of practices more fluid.Ambivalent interpretation of seidworkers at the time of sagawriting need not indicate doubt about a ‘foreign’ practice. The rootsof seidr – and of distrust surrounding it – may lie deep in thenorthern landscape.However, whether seidr is a ‘borrowing’ from Sámi practice, or‘indigenous’ fluid practices developed and changing over time inmulti-directional, multi-vocal exchange with Sámi and otherpractitioners, may not be the most telling of its features for today’spractitioners. More important are the nuances that surround seidrpractice, whether past or present. In this we can see seidr as partof a complex of activities including seeing, runic or spoken magic,and out-sitting. But the associations of seidr with spirit contact,spirit marriage, spirit-possession, and the ability to manipulatethought, or Wyrd, always problematic, seem to have beenincreasingly so for men.The underhanded, covert workings of seidr must haverepresented a further reason for male aversion to it, at least inpublic. In a society that valued a forthright male manner and aready embrace of outward conflict, a ritual allowing the secretmanipulation of another’s will would violate ideals of propermasculinity... Such trickery is typical of Ódinn... but it appearsmore problematic for his male disciples.(Dubois 1999:137)While the ‘ready embrace of outward conflict’ may be more138Ergiseidmen, queer transformations?"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"apparent than real – the sagas may draw on conflicts as theexception that makes a good story, and Byock (1982) discussesnumerous ways of conflict-avoidance evident in sagas beforeviolence occurs – as I have indicated, others too have suggested thatthese ‘underhanded’ ways of operating go against hegemonicmasculinity, though they may be valued when undertaken bywomen denied the legal remedies afforded by the Icelandic systemto men. Some seidworkers today would dispute that thesetechniques would always have been seen as ‘underhanded’ but inworking with seidr today they know the saga passages, and thereputation that seidr acquired.And whatever was the case in the tenth century, distaste for seidrarises in some sections of society today: as evidenced by themessages Jordsvin received and the internet exchanges I describedearlier, and Raudhild’s mention of ‘resistance to seidr’. Theactivities of ‘contact with spirits’ and the descriptions given here arecounter to hegemonic assumptions about what people can andshould do. In a world that values rationality, acquisition ofbelongings or artefacts, and advancement through institutionalisedgendered social hierarchies, shamanistic practice is threateningbecause it allows for possibilities of creating meaning outside thecircumscribed ‘choice’ of ‘legitimate’ socio-economic activity. Manyneo-shamanisms appear in the West as individual practice, forms ofpsychological ‘self-help’ that marginalise the practitioner whileexoticising the ‘other’, the ‘primordial traditional shaman’. Seidrinverts this procedure by being community practice, and by drawingdirectly on the cultural and historical roots of the societies withinwhich it is practised today. It reminds us that the ancestors ofWestern society were not ‘rational’ in today’s terms, and that theydealt, or were forced to deal, directly with death, transformationand knowledge, in ways that are non-normative in today’s society.So today’s practitioners, male or female, create relationships withancestors and ‘spirits’, and in living these become changed by theexperience.

She or hehas become entirely reliant on others.It seems to me that the charge ofergi, applied to men, may relateto this extreme vulnerability. Within a world in which direct,physical, expression is paramount, and physicality is the measure ofa man, the seer has abrogated manhood. That the seer is holdingthe attention of all present and communicating with spirits –negotiating with them, at times striving to wrest a solution fromthem – is, for the literalist, not obvious (though it may be central tothe identity of the seer). Meulengracht Sørensen interprets theword, and the associated charge ofnid, as political, within thecontexts of the writing of the sagas and the rather extremeexamples of violent maintaining – or taking – of hegemonic‘masculinity’ given in, for instance,Sturlunga saga.His account ofníd(infamy) and ergiis an interpretation of thesaga texts as incorporating concepts of (literal or figurative) ‘phallicaggression’. In his understanding of the texts, often concepts ofnídand the protagonist’s attempts to free himself of this taint drive theplot of the sagas. He points out that seidr (in the passage aboutÓdinn) was said to render its male practitioners ergi, and later saysthat ‘witchcraft ... was closely associated with the practice ofergi’(1983: 55). (As he has previously said that one ‘branch of meaning’in the ‘ergi-complex’ is ‘versed in witchcraft’ (p. 19) this may besomewhat circular.) However, following this reasoning, at least inthe sagas letting oneself become vulnerable would be ergi, andhence seidworkers are ergi. In a context of increasing distrust ofshamanic outcomes, and reliance on individual or family abilitiesfor protection or defence, one who makes himself vulnerable,ergi,isavoiding proper duties and responsibilities associated withhegemonic masculinity in saga times. For women, the equationswould have been a little different – the status of cultural protectionafforded to women meaning that jettisoning awareness of physicalthreats would be acceptable in some circumstances.11So there may be many reasons for seidr or shamanistic practice140Ergiseidmen, queer transformations?"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"to be seen as problematic,ergi, particularly for men. The seidworkerI interviewed after his first high-seat trance said, ‘You’d beinterested to know that I felt extremely ergi.’ He was referring to theflow of information through him, and his openness to the spiritsand to the people gathered. I, from a different position within theseance, could relate it to perceived vulnerability. These multipleinterpretations need not conflict. Today’s seidfolk are reclaimingwords, inscribing their own meanings as they find practices that‘work’. The context of today’s practice, the ‘safe spaces’ in whichoracular seidr occurs, is not the context of the thirteenth centurywhen accounts were being written.The response of a seid-attendee, Einar, to a heated emaildiscussion on seidr,ergi, and nid, made this plain.Today, we have a totally different culture. Some of what maynot have been acceptable in the tenth century is acceptabletoday. I’ve met a number of men who say that their lives areenriched by the practice of Seidhr or Galdr. Why not take whatworks (e.g., seidr) and discard what doesn’t (e.g., slaying anenemy if there is a dispute)? I say hail to those who take whatthey can use from the lore to enrich their lives. If it works,great! If it doesn’t work or clashes with the law, etc., it’s of littleor no use!Einar continued:Far too often the misunderstood ‘ergi’ accusation gets thrownabout. . . . [I am] just noting that there are those who sendprivate (and sometimes public) hate mail to men who practiceSeidr, etc. It is hoped that ... we can move beyond the hate andphobia of a few vocal people who spoil it for the rest of us byusing a reconstructionist view without a modern critique.Men and women who engage with seidr today are shaping their ownunderstandings ofergias they deal actively with discourses ofgender and sexuality, positioning themselves as active agents ofchange as they seek to understand their own worlds. Some areactively attempting to reclaim the term to describe themselves, theirpractice, their philosophy. Seidr therefore is political practice, and‘queer’ practice, existing within gendered political dimensions today.Ergiseidmen, queer transformations? 141"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The dance of theancestorsSummarising seidrThis final chapter is an attempt to draw together and summarisesome of the strands that have been elaborated previously. Here Ireturn to issues of presenting understandings of seidr andshamanisms, tensions between practitioners and academics, andengagement with post-modern discourses of reality and the critiqueof ethnography. How far do these interpretations hold, when theethnographer deals with culturally contextualised spirits, andattempts to present her own understandings gained within the seidrtrance? Can this be done, or is academia too ‘shamanophobic’? Idraw, here, on my experiences of presenting material to an academicaudience, and I examine some of the challenges that have beenraised regarding engaging with seidr and neo-shamanic practices,and the multi-sited nature of this kind of research.Debates within academia parallel those within the communitiesthemselves, and I again examine some of these similarities,revisiting the context of Western approaches to shamanism and tothe ‘Old Religions’ of the North. Constructions of meaning movefrom seidr as ‘authentic’, to seidr as ‘transformational’, seidr as‘recovering roots’, and attempts to avoid appropriation. Finally,returning to ethnography, I again make use of the metaphor of theethnographer as shaman, moving between worlds and beingchanged by the experience.As part of today’s post-modern explosion of spiritual expression,religions and practices of Northern Europe are being reconstitutedor reinvented, in North America and Europe; and seidr with them,as we have seen, though owing much to descriptions of shamanicpractice, especially Sámi and Siberian shamanism. Descriptions ofChapter 8"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"seidr and its accomplishment today can be found on websites and injournals of Heathen and shamanistic groups: examples being themagazines Idunnaand Spirit Talk. I have been asked to composeshort accounts of seidr for various audiences, for instance as part ofthe Pagan Federation’s ‘info-pack’ on shamanisms.Galina Lindquist (1997) describes how practices derived from the‘core-shamanism’ of Michael Harner, and from others (followingHarley Swift Deer) who have looked to North American indigenousspiritualities, are becoming ‘re-embedded’ in the context, landscapesand cosmology and cultural knowledges of Northern Europe (inLindquist’s examples, specifically Scandinavia: this is happeningalso in Britain). Most of the people whose words and visions I havedrawn on in this book have begun with an explicit exploration ofHeathen cosmology, the Nine Worlds, the Well of Wyrd, the treeYggdrasill, and the Æsir and Vanir. They are working, first, toconstruct religious practice and spiritual community, and they havestumbled across seidr, reinventing it as magical or shamanisticpractice, arising from the traces and descriptions in sagas andEddas, and from remaining folk-practices in Iceland, Scotland andelsewhere. Others were already experimenting with seidr for healing,but oracular seidr in its present form was first practised withintoday’s Heathenry in the US when Diana Paxson went looking for‘something for the women to do’ while men were involved inperforming ‘viking games’ and drinking beer, playing out thegendered, non-ergistereotype of the macho warrior. The result wasthe creation of ritual and tranceworking that has moved from beinga ‘fringe’ part of a ‘fringe’ religion, to being an expected part ofHeathen gatherings, something that is displayed within the widerPagan community as specifically ‘Northern’ practice, and conductedat large festivals by Heathen practitioners. Practitioners are sharingperceptions and experiences with those who derive their practicefrom Sámi and Siberian roots, and those drawing on the energies ofland and nature spirits (Høst, forthcoming) and some interestingconversations are taking place.Discourses of contested practiceIn previous chapters I have discussed seidr as contested practicewithin the religious movements that generated it, with itsambiguous and uncertain derivation from the old literature. Theterm’s meaning is disputed. Within academia, also, challenges haveThe dance of the ancestors 143"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"been levelled at seidr, seidworkers, and those who would treat this as‘shamanistic practice’. These challenges appear to me as part of a(post?)modern quest for authenticity, sureness, roots, boundaries,and for definition of the indefinable. In addition to questions ofsexuality and gender, dealt with in the previous chapter, theyinclude: contested definitions of seidr as ‘shamanism’, or pastpractitioners as ‘shamans’; questions of whether today’s practi-tioners are ‘shamans’; challenges of ‘inauthenticity’ of today’spractices; and challenges to the ‘impartiality’ of those who engagewith experiential ethnography, exploring alternative consciousnessand the Nine Worlds.These deal with issues discussed in earlier chapters. I use thesecomments, now, as focuses for summarising earlier material, andexploring academic implications; and for examination ofproblematic relationships between seidworkers, other neo-shamans,and the academics who profess to find their practices of interest instudying religions of post-modernity.‘Is seidr “shamanism”?’This question seems predicated on the assumption that a discretesomething called ‘shamanism’ exists and can be clearly defined.Indeed, as discussed in chapter 4, there have been a number ofattempts to define ‘shamanism’. Most seem to agree that the termcomes from the Tungus/Evenki word for a practitioner of particularkinds of work involving altered states of consciousness andrelationships between ‘spirits’ and human community. Coming intoEuropean discourse through both Russian and German explorers’tales (Shirokogorov 1935; Flaherty 1992) the term ‘caught on’among Westerners eager for stories of exotic practices of ‘others’,and came to be used of other Siberian peoples and extended moregenerally as an ‘ism’ to cover whatever the user wished to define as‘shamanism’: based on an understanding of ‘primitive religion’ asdifferent,exotic, and as such, definable. Eliade’s (1964) definitionof ‘archaic techniques of ecstasy’ is cited by academics andpractitioners ofcore-shamanism or other Western ‘urbanshamanisms’ that claim a grounding in research. Other definitionsappear to grapple with some sort of ‘essence’ of shamanism, forinstance the familiar one of Shirokogorov, of ‘mastery of spirits’and the shaman therefore as one who controls spirits: or withattempting to explain it all away – a further definition, of shama-144 The dance of the ancestors"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"nism as psychopathology that is culturally sanctioned, has arisenfrom older views of shamanism as psychopathology plain andsimple. It, too, arises from a sense of the shaman as one whoinitially is dealing with some kind of problem (whether described asawakening by spirits, or as mental illness) which the shaman then‘masters’. A number of researchers have commented on the racisminherent in such stereotyping of shamans or peoples (e.g. Merkur1992: 26).Part of the debate over definition lies in the extent to which‘shamanism’ and ‘spirit possession’ are differentiated. As Lewis(1989) and Merkur (1992) point out, shamanism and possessionoften occur together, not only within the same community butwithin the same individual, even during the same seance where apossessing spirit takes over the body of the shaman while herconsciousness is elsewhere, for instance seeking answers toquestions.It is important to note that these definitions come from outsiders,people who do or did not usually engage with shamanic practice.However, those who are involved with core-shamanism (or manyother neo-shamanisms) tend to deal more in practicalities, repro-ducing definitions close to that of Eliade’s, which has indeedbecome required reading for sectors of the neo-shamanistcommunity. Of Eliade’s listed techniques or methods which hesuggests define shamanism,entering an altered state ofconsciousness and ascending to the sky, or descending to the lowerworld, is paramount;1though as Heinze (1991) points out, Eliade’sChristian focus tended to privilege the ascent to the sky.I have tended to see attempted definitions of shamanism assaying more about Western approaches and discourses than they doabout ‘other people’s’ practices: and shamanism not as a ‘thing’ butas a concept constructed to meet needs of Western academics fordefinition. Ecstatic trance seems to be found almost everywhere, butin diversity, not sameness. Rather than seeing a universalised‘shamanism’ I prefer to speak of specific ‘shamanisms’ that are notprimordial or static. ‘Shamans’ are active agents, changingrelationships and societies as they change consciousness.‘Surely the seidwomen were not shamans!’Merkur (1992) has pointed to the problem that each definitionomits some people who are, by others’ definition (including theThe dance of the ancestors 145"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"definition of other shamans), ‘shamans’. The approach that I haveadopted in this book, and elsewhere, is one that avoids definition. Inan article with Robert Wallis, we said:We feel the endurance of the term ‘shamanism’ espouses itspotential for careful application, in an approachto shamanismrather than according to globalising definitions. Dowson’s‘elements of shamanism’ (1999) embrace diversity to avoid themetanarratives definition embodies. Techniques of trance areembedded in specific social relations: shamans enter a trance inorder to engage with a spirit world, and this engagement issocio-politically supported by the community. By focusing onthe socio-politics of shamanism, as well as ‘techniques’ oractivities in the spirit world, we can discern cross-culturaldifference as well as similarity. The ways that shamans andshamanic practices are sanctioned by their communities showhow different shamanisms are across the world. The study ofshamanism in this way is not monolithic (searching for thesame thing everywhere, across space and time) because itemphasises difference. Neither is it vague: the shaman stillassumes very specific social/spiritual activities.These specific shamanisms are neither static nor bounded, butchange with time and circumstances, so that shamans are activeagents of cultural change.(Blain and Wallis 2000: 398)We received a comment that it was an ‘almost non-definition’. Iwould disagree only with the word ‘almost’: the statement was notintended as a definition, nor were we trying to claim that seidr eitherin past or present is ‘shamanism’ (that Western abstraction or idealtype). What we were saying, and I am asserting now, is that anunderstanding of seidr (and some other neo-shamanic manifest-ations) is facilitated by drawing critically on the immense andgrowing literature on shamanisms; and can in turn contribute tounderstandings of ‘shamanic’ practices elsewhere. I attempt toengage with what today’s seeresses do, and how they understandseidr, community and self, by juxtaposing past and present,examining the ways today’s seidworkers use the literature, askingquestions about relationships of seidr to other possibly-ecstaticpractices today and in the past. (A link with Sámi practice, forinstance, appears quite strongly in both times.)146 The dance of the ancestors"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"The seidwomen were practising specifically according to whatthey had learned, within relationships constituted with otherindividuals and processes, and with the particular spirits they met intheir practice. In the literature they appear at times embeddedwithin community, whether acting on individual causes or engagedin ‘socially constitutive seidr’: maintaining the course of justice,creating prosperity for the community, actively engaging with Wyrdrather than merely reporting it. We do not know about theirtraining, or initiation. The sources – the Icelandic sagas – are late,and post-Christian.If we do attempt a precise definition, such as Shirokogorov’s(1935) concept of mastery of spirits, it seems to me that there is noway to decide whether the seidworkers of the sagas were ‘shamans’.Their relationships with their spirits are not described, other than inthe situation of the Greenland Seeress who comments that becausethe song that calls her helper spirits has been so well sung, she wasable to see further and know more than ever before (and as it is notshe who sings the song, the question of ‘mastery’ here does notseem possible to ascertain). But she is very clearly entering intosome kind of spirit-relationship, and doing so on behalf of thepeople who have requested her to ‘see’ for them. This relationshipwith the spirits is problematic for today’s practitioners, whounderstandably want to gather more information than the sagagives. A number, however, are finding their own sources ofinformation, namely ‘spirits’ whether of land or ancestors, whoappear to them, in trance, as teachers and helpers, at timesproblematically. (As has been indicated earlier, spirits are not always‘nice’ or of good will.)‘Don’t today’s people claim to be shamans?’I know only one seidworker who commonly and explicitly refers toherself as a ‘shaman’. Others prefer the terms ‘seidwoman’ or‘seidman’ or their Icelandic equivalents,seidkonaand seidmadr.Forsome, this is borrowed from the ‘etiquette’ of core-shamanism: theterm ‘shaman’ is an honorific given by a community in respect ofwhat you do, you do not call yourself a shaman, others will give youthe status. Thus today’s shamanists may pay respect to indigenousshamans and to the community-embeddedness of their practices(Wallis 1999a). One cannot be a ‘shaman’ without a community:serious ‘urban shamanism’ today is not work aimed at self-The dance of the ancestors 147"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"improvement or self-gratification (see e.g. Heinze 1991), althoughindividuals’ attendances at beginner neo-shamanic workshops ordrumming groups may well be (see e.g. Jakobsen 1999).2Others donot use the term ‘shaman’ because it does not seem relevant, as theyprefer to describe what they do in culturally specific terms. Yetothers, such as Bil, avoid the term from a wish to dissociatethemselves from the attendees at new-age workshops. Bil does onoccasion use the word, comparatively, to explain what he does interms of specific traditional shamanisms, including Sámi practices.Scottish seidman Malcolm says that originally he called what hedid ‘Northern shamanism’, though he did not think of himself as a‘shaman’. The spirits with whom he works told him that he wouldknow when he was a shaman, because the community would callhim that. After eighteen years of practice within Northerncosmology he still does not call himself a shaman. Human membersof the Pagan community sometimes do. His spirits, he says, do not(and he has learned that they themselves are the ‘community’ towhom they originally referred): but ‘they have stopped laughing’when the humans use the term.In/authentic seidr todayA charge of ‘doing it wrong’ arises both from practitioners (aboutother practitioners); from non-practitioners within the Heathencommunity (as part of a quest for authenticity) and withinacademia (from those who seem to think that the point is toreconstruct a seidr ‘performance’, to mimic those of 1,000 years agorather than to engage in seidr as explorations of community-consciousness and cosmology within a present-day framework).Critics rightly point out ‘we don’t know’ what the seeress did. Theliterary sources are late and post-Christian. Nevertheless, thesources indicate that the concept of ‘the seidkona’ was very muchpresent in the awareness of thirteenth- and fourteenth-centuryIcelanders, with every indication that the phenomenon of seidr wasknown and accomplished in Norway, Scotland, Sweden, Irelandand that it was a development of practices that were at leasthundreds of years old.The single detailed description of practice, the account of theGreenland Seeress, is indeed not likely to be ‘correct’ as adescription of a specific incident: but the numerous accounts thatrefer to seidr, or that give pieces of the puzzle, indicate that practices148 The dance of the ancestors"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"were known and widespread: building a seid-platform; holding astaff; the use of chanting; the giving of counsel that could not beknown (e.g. about events taking place at a distance); and the relatedpractices of travelling in altered shape, casting illusions, givingprotection.Today’s seidfolk are taking the pieces as and where they findthem: scouring the sagas for details, drawing on the Eddic poems.They are also ‘borrowing’ and adapting from any source that seemsrelevant. Some have had Sámi teachers: but they frame what theydo within the Heathen cosmology of the Well, the Tree, and theNine Worlds. Some seidr practices are becoming widespread withinthe community – many both women and men engage in journeyingfor personal knowledge or development. However, those who areseen as community seidworkers are those who sit in the high seat, orengage with healing or ‘wholemaking’ for others, and who havebeen practising for some time. A small but increasing number areengaged in ‘becoming a seidworker’, learning the techniques withinthe cosmological framework.The learning is not only from human seidworkers. The teachersare ‘the spirits’, especially ancestors and Landwights, and includingthe deities who themselves perform seidr, Freyja and Ódinn. Theremay be a defined initiation, sometimes over a protracted period,followed by a period of learning – potentially life-long – in howto use the skills so gained. None of the people I have spokenwith, not even Bil or Raudhildr, describe themselves as ‘mastersof spirits’. The spirits are there, participants, helping or hinder-ing, having to be persuaded and placated, or doing their ownpersuading: creating new sets of social relations which surround the‘shaman’ or seidworker. ‘This is something I am still having to cometo terms with, explain and interpret’, said ‘James’ (in chapter 7).Similar statements have been made elsewhere, by experiencedshamans:The shaman’s path is unending. I am an old, old man and still anunutsi(baby) standing before the mystery of the world.(Huichol shaman Don José Matsúwa, quoted bySchultes and Hofmann 1992: 138, cited by Gyrus n.d.)To me it seems that the ‘mastery of spirits’ definition remainsthat of an outsider. What shamans, or seidworkers, or other ecstaticpractitioners experience is assessable, or accessible, only by anThe dance of the ancestors 149"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"insider – human or spirit; for these spirits, to the ethnographer whoseeks to map the terrain of seidr, are party to the negotiation of itsshaping. The seidworker may experience these varied ‘spirits’ eitheras parties to the construction of a dialogue (in which informationis given) or as possessory entities. In either case they can bespoken with: one might say even interviewed! However, thisapproach, which is dependent on treating seidr or shamanicevents and experiences as occurring within a ‘reality’ that can bemapped or described, taking ‘spirits’ seriously, leads to a furtherchallenge.‘Have you jettisoned impartiality?’As I am both a researcher and a practitioner, this may indicate thatI do prefer seidworkers’ multivocal accounts of their practice, andinterpretations, to those of Eliade or the ‘master of spirits’ conceptpreviously mentioned. The later requires, I feel, some furtherdeconstruction. A major strand in the Western concept of theindividual, unique ‘self ’ is that of control: which appears in manycontexts. Before I saw, and participated in, seidr, I had engaged withnarratives of ‘control’ appearing within the discourses of many (notall) men as fathers, in a study of parenting in Halifax, Nova Scotia,which I linked (Blain 1992) to the construction of the liberal,rational, capitalist, usually male, individual discussed anddeconstructed by Venn (1984). It seems strange to see this debatereplayed regarding neo-shamanisms. Here several strands areinterwoven, including not only the aforesaid western concept of‘control’ but diverse readings of shamans’ (or apprentices’) storiesof battles, or of ‘performances’ witnessed by Western explorers andmissionaries. For the tales of the ‘mastery’ or ‘control’ of spirits areto me like nothing so much as the folk tales or Arthurian legendswith which I grew up (Lancelot may work hard and be the bestknight, but there is always another challenge and eventual defeat):or even the ‘flytings’ discussed in chapter 7. The enemy, defeated in(actual or spiritual) battle is defeated also with words, whethertaunts or boasts. Or as a British shamanistic practitioner withwhom I discussed this said:Now you’ve got me analytical, and thinking about the numberof times I’ve spent a few hours in a state of general dread and150 The dance of the ancestors"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"scrabbling near-competence, only to come out at the end andSMS my wife with ‘We won.’ . . . A bit of healing is a bit ofhealing, but if something kicks seven shades of crap out of youand leaves you with bruises on your ribs, by the gods it was afoe worth boasting about!Further, if we view ‘shaman’ – or seidworker – not as a one-dimensional, glamorous but rather stereotyped figure, but as anactive agent of community construction, there is surely no reason tosuppose that all relations with all spirits will be the same. Taussig’s(1987) accounts of Colombian shamans’ politically negotiated con-structions have been referred to earlier: these and other ‘traditional’practitioners exist in a changing environment, using whateverresources they can, constructing or reinventing themselves and theirsocial relations of practice within contexts of historic colonialism,neo-colonialism, religious competition, spirit involvement andcontestation, environmental degradation, disease and death. Insuch accounts, the shaman is ‘negotiator and negotiated in adeeply political process that destroys any belief in shamanismsolely as a safe or benevolent phenomenon’ (Wallis 1999b: 45).The enmity of other shamans, combated in trance, is part of this.Whose spirits are more powerful? (See e.g. Vitebsky 1995b.) Thebattle of Sámi noiades mentioned in the Historia Norwegicais a casein point.The human-cultural context of seidr – and most ‘European’ neo-shamanisms – may be considerably less problematic, yet stillseidworkers are involved with negotiating meaning and practice, inthe spirit as in the everyday world, where that meaning and practiceare immensely variable, and where the outcome is certain only inhindsight. Previously-negotiated meanings ensure that there areallies or associates who can probably be counted on, if appealedto correctly or (e.g. in Inuit shamanic practice) challenged appro-priately, and practice, as with other areas of social relationships,increases skill.Here, though, I should add that the definitions given in beginner‘core-shamanic’ practice also emphasise ‘control’, in this casecontrol through association with essentially benign spirits or guides:consumer-shamanistic practice for middle-class urbanites.[C]ore-shamanism emphasises that the shamanic state iscontrollable. This is important in Harner’s teaching of core-The dance of the ancestors 151"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"shamanism to Westerners, because the path to becoming ashaman can be conveyed as safe and suitable for teaching in aworkshop scenario. It may also represent an attempt todestigmatise shamanism following decades of oppression inindigenous communities by colonising cultures and religions. . .The emphasis on control in Harnerism promises the techniqueis safe to practitioners. It also reveals the Western need for‘control’ (over consciousness, emotions, or money) where nosuch precedent may be found in indigenous shamanism.(Wallis 1999b: 46)From the accounts of Bil, chapters 4 and 7, or Raudhildr, chapter 2,seidr does not emerge as a notably ‘safe’ practice.Reinventing WyrdToday, seidworkers may be few in number, but they experiencetransformation of self and others, within negotiated relationshipswith spirits and with human members of their communities. Theydraw on understandings of cosmology and past practice, togetherwith these negotiated relationships, to create their practices today.Their clients seek instruction on daily life in a complex urbansociety, once again based on understandings from practices of 1,000years ago which may combine the attraction of the exotic shaman‘other’ with nostalgia for a supposed past. Yet however audiences orclients view their work, seidworkers are not reconstructing the past,but shifting across 1,000 years to weave Wyrd from past threads,in creating shamanic forms for the present and for the newmillennium. They talk about fear and change, within meetings, theexperience of trance, mingling everyday and ‘extraordinary’, knownand unknown. Bil’s web page gives an attempted answer to ‘wheredoes the seidman go?’I have friends who only live in the Otherworld (who have noexistence in the world of man), and I have enemies as well. Wego places like anybody else: we go to the store, we go to work,we go visit the family inside the mountain, we go to Taco Bell,we go to the Land of the Dead. We see the same things thateveryone else see; we just see a lot more of it than the averagefolk – that’s all. Every single person interacts with ancestors,alfar, jötnar, and trolls of one kind or another every single day.152 The dance of the ancestors"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"It’s just that the interpretation by the average person is usuallyin terms of good luck or bad luck. We, on the other hand, cansee the puppet strings. That’s just the way it is.(Linzie n.d.,http://www.angelfire.com/nm/seidhman/seidgo.html)They also talk about the ethics of seidwork, remembering thoseother challenges – from the literature and today’s readers – of seidras mind-control. Thus, the respected seeress Raudhildr states herviews on the practice of seidr techniques within today’s community:It must benefit the practitioner in the long run.It should benefit Midgard and the Gods when they touchdirectly with the practice.It must be done safely with utmost respect for the Goddessesand Gods, the community, and the practitioner.If something unsafe to the practitioner must be done for thebenefit of the community and the Gods & Goddesses, it is thedecision of the practitioner and hi/r allies so to do. They shouldbe responsible in that decision and the community shouldsupport it if conscience will allow.(Email discussion, 1999)Shamans and anthropologistsSome researchers have described a curious ‘double standard’ –‘native informants’, but not ‘Europeans’ or academics, can speakand theorise from within ‘irrational’ discourses of magic orspirit helpers (Blain 1998a; Wilson 1994). Others mention‘shamanophobia’ (Dowson 1996), to which Wallis (1999a) adds‘neoshamanophobia’, within academia: a reluctance to consider‘shamanic’ constructions for human events. ‘Magic is a virtualtaboo in post-Enlightenment scholarship’ say Arnould et al.(1999:63). So, to speak of the human-political situating of seidris acceptable; to describe the politics internal to the seid-journey,as a form of ‘truth’ that can aid analysis (rather than a phenomenonto be analysed) is often not. ‘Spirit-helpers’ thus become culturallydefined aspects of one’s own personality, not external agents:part of the individualisation and psychologising of perceptionthat pervades Western academic discourses of the rational, unitaryself). In the Western neo-shamanic movement, it is common forThe dance of the ancestors 153"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"practitioners to speak of Jungian theory, archetypes, and toindividuate ‘spirit guardians’ and ‘higher selves’, entities thatare attached to an individual person and may be explained asforming part of that individual’s psyche, consciousness orsubconscious. Similar discourses are used to explain academicunderstandings of the imaginal. (Is it ‘real’, or is it all in my head?)Researchers attempting to explain the ‘otherworldness’ of shamanicecstasy and the images that appear have investigated neurologicalactivity promoted by entheogens or by the stimulation of repeatedsound (drumming, chanting) and movement, exhaustion, fastingand so forth: processes which are internal to the individualconcerned.But those who study shamanisms within context point out thatthe images are not the same in all cultures: not only the meaning,but what is seen or heard, changes. Even the experience ofanthropologists, undertaking experiential research embeddedwithin different socio-cultural contexts, changes – Michael Harner’sterrifying entheogen-induced initiatory experiences of Jivarocosmology (Harner 1980) are dramatically different from theexperiences reported in this book. Perception and meaning areembedded within specific cultural and historic community inter-pretations. These shamanisms rely on similar possibilities (abilitiesof humans to remember dreams, to interpret images, to shiftawareness in response to stimuli, and so forth) but the ‘shamaniccomplex’ differs in what is done and how this is interpreted (Hoppál1987). But there is more. In shamanic cultures, shamanism isnot one part or aspect of culture that can be examined or not, asthe ethnographer chooses. Describes her experiences as anethnographer among the Déné, Guédon says that ‘Shamanismpermeates all of Nabesna culture: the worldview, the subsistencepatterns, and the life cycles’ (Guédon 1994).In the old material, as earlier discussed, seidr is not usuallydescribed as central to the community. Yet in the sagas thepossibility of magical action, of altered consciousness, of involve-ment with the community through seidr, is there, present, and whenit does occur it is non-remarkable. Though usually occurring on anindividual basis (as do almost all activities in the sagas (Hastrup1996)), at times it does have a community focus, as in the instancesof Thúrid the sound-filler, the Greenland Seeress, and Thordísspákona.

Relations constructed betweenpeople of the community include those that involve other beings,spirits, powers, deities.However, the communities of today who have informed thisbook are deliberately constructed, rather self-consciously: groups ofpeople who come together here and there, to link themselves withthe deities of the Eddas, the Æsir and Vanir of Northern Europeand ‘worship’ in what they consider to be ‘old ways’. Some havebased their practice initially on ritual worship believed to parallelthat of the ‘Viking age’. Others associate themselves chiefly withspirits of land and sea, and only secondarily with the deities ofÁsgard. Oracular seidr was a deliberate construction. But howeverit arose, seidr, for some groups, is now central to communitypractice and understanding ofhow to relate todeities and wights.Relations constituted through seidr locate the seidworker withrespect to others – her clients, and the spirits she contacts. Theseidworker becomes a mediator between people and spirits, active increation of community and knowledge. Winifred is an example:One of the most interesting seeings that I had was for a youngman, and (the deity) Heimdall came for him, and it waswonderful ... they set up this whole thing where they went into asauna together and had this man-to-man talk about how to bea man and follow the man’s path, and the interesting thing wasthat I wasn’t allowed to hear what they were saying to oneanother, but just to understand that Heimdall had thisknowledge for him and that I had to pass it on to him... youknow, sweat lodge and the whole, the whole deal and it was like,these are male mysteries and they’re not for me, only themessage was, it’s my right to carry. But it was very warming tosee a young man being taken in hand by Heimdall and set uponhis man’s path.Approaches to seidr and shamanism can look beyond theconcept of technique or individual relationships, to shamanicpractice embedded within social relations that include personalrelations of friendship and community constructions of gender,ethnicity, sexuality and status: situatings of seidworker and clientsthat are part-constituted by other beings, ‘spirits’, animals, deities.Narratives of ‘the spirits’ and of the shaman as entering intosocially constitutive relations with them, however, are what becomeThe dance of the ancestors 155"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"most problematic for a Western rationalist audience, for whom non-belief in ‘spirits’ is axiomatic. I have seen a conference returning,time after time, to the question of ‘do the spirits exist?’ Inpresenting any material that relates to personal experience, I have todeal with the challenge of whether I have ‘belief ’ in ‘the spirits’: abelief that would seem to discredit my credentials to do ‘impartial’or ‘unbiased’ ethnography. (That non-belief also constitutes ‘bias’would be seen as likewise irrational by adherents of the non-beliefdiscourse.)I could say that to my respondents, the ‘belief in spirits’ is real,and therefore it becomes part of the way in which they shape theirworld, create their realities, manipulate their consciousnesses: theethnographer, however, standing outside, can see how the belieffunctions within the community. This has been the approach takenby many researchers – and shades into the view that such belief isappropriate for those studied, but not the researcher, which carriesits own implicit ethnocentric assumptions of superiority (Wilson1994). Two, linked, sets of problems become evident. Chapter 2included an extract from an article prepared by Diana Paxson,author, and initial researcher, within the community, of oracularseidr. In it, she moves back and forth between the discourse of‘spirits’ and the discourse of ‘rationality’: furthermore, she says shedid this when experiencing trance. She had to learn to set heracademic brain ‘on hold’ at times. She, like Winifred and Jordsvin,Bil, Thorgerd, ‘James’, Malcolm, Susan, Raudhildr, like the manyothers named and un-named in this book, like myself, is part ofpresent-day post-industrial society, immersed in its dialogues,products of its education system, bombarded with information thatsupports the rational individual self and denies ‘spirits’. Yet theseseidworkers author their ‘selves’ through a discourse which iscontested even within their community of choice, making sense oftheir experiences and relating these also to their ‘other’ worlds:reflexivity, as Cohen (1994) points out, is not only the prerogative ofthe ethnographer.Taking the view that ‘they believe it, so I’ll accept it as emicdescription’ positions the researcher as having access to a ‘truth’outside, and at odds with that of her participants. It is, to say theleast, patronising. It may also, in the final resort, actively denyaccess to the ‘realities’ of participants (Turner 1994) – including theresearcher’s own experiences. And in distancing the ethnographerfrom this ‘belief ’, it starts to reify ‘emic knowledge’ as fixed, static156 The dance of the ancestors"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"and unchanging, as generally shared, rather than as the specificconstruction of interpretations that each person, ethnographerincluded, engages in, and with.For some time, my choice was to refuse to adjudicate belief, as Iindicated in the introduction. However, ‘belief ’ is, in my view, not agood description for the relation of shamanists and other beingsthat share the worlds of their lives. These beings are part of therelationships, partial creators of community endeavours. They aresimply there: and in an ethnography of encounters with a spirit-world, the spirit-beings communicate their part. While shamanismmay involve mimesis, ‘performance’, dialogue too is part of theprocess, and in interpreting ‘extraordinary experience’ I am requiredto take seriously not merely the human participants’ perceptions,but the ‘spirits’ themselves. This has come to mean acknowledgingpublicly that I can understand only through experiencing, and thatin my brokerings of knowledge from one group to the other, itbecomes needful to say that ‘I know’ this experience not only asobserver and repository of stories and confidences, but throughdirect connection, trance and seidr seance, speaking for the spirits,speaking from the mound, dancing with the ancestors. Hencechapter 5 of this book.I see Winifred and the others moving between the worlds,constructing meaning from discourse, relationships, surroundings:two images come to mind. Guédon talks of Déné concepts of place,location, without boundaries: the hunter moves from a ‘home’point, out and back, out and back, creating knowledge of place thatmay be used and known also by others, from their own points ofreference. Likewise, the ‘shaman’ moves from the safe place, out intothe unknown útangardand returns, to trace a different journey nexttime, and journeys intersect, mapping the territory in a way that iswithout boundaries. To me, the shaman becomes a metaphor for theethnographer of post-modernity, moving through the worlds,moving between levels of analysis, in an attempt to reconstructsomething in her own understandings, her own life, that approacheswholeness, an understanding of living that is complete, not frag-mented, returning in her journeys to a pole of being, a World Tree.I cannot create ethnography by appropriating local knowledges.(This was the old image of ethnography, that the anthropologistwould go ‘elsewhere’ and come back with pure description,informants’ stories and ‘objective’ observation. It never, of course,worked like that: the ethnographer’s gathering of local knowledgeThe dance of the ancestors 157"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"being always partial, observations always situated.) My choice is toenter the world of the seidworker, as a native-speaker: but simply‘going native’, total cultural immersion, in itself is not enough. Myunderstandings of seidr include understandings of its links to the‘outside’ world, and my own locations within these; and how ‘thespirits’ see these links. I seek to understand the construction of seidrand its community, the contradictions and contestations therein, byunderstanding my ‘self ’ as part/not part of that community, assituated within its relations, with my own knowledges that are nottotally shared with others, though specific others have parts therein.Critical awareness and reflexivity are constructed in the inter-sections of the worlds, in the journeys; in experiencing ecstasy, andmy attempts to communicate it in prose or poetry, here andelsewhere – and in the tension between these discourses and those ofthe academic world that I likewise inhabit.This book has been a journey of many paths. ‘Shamanisms’ arebeing re-created on many levels, in many ways, as increasingnumbers of people jettison ‘established’ religion and seek asindividuals and as interlinked communities, for spirituality. Manyturn to ‘indigenous shamanism’ still seen, mistakenly, as primordial,unchanged, a ‘first religion’; but in this post-colonial world chargesof appropriation, theft of culture and spirituality, have weight, andoften people who are not part of ‘indigenous’ communities will seekto avoid appropriation. The quest for meaning, then, turns to theancestors – and to those spirits of place, animals and plants, thatpeople the landscapes, both physical and cosmological, in which theseeker feels most ‘at home’.We do not know, in North-Western Europe, how the earliest‘ancestors’ conceptualised their spirituality. Cave art and rock-artmay now be seen as ‘shamanic’, but it is only with the – relativelyrecent – writing of the sagas and Eddas that memories of a largelyanimist landscape start to reveal themselves in words. And there inthe landscape, in mounds, hills, howes, barrows, are the ancestors.Yet the seidfolk do not reconstruct the past, though their practicesare based in it. It is from today’s understandings of past, present,life and death, spun from a multitude of narrative strands thatinclude those of the past, the Norns, Wyrd, that they go in trance toseek answers, to seek themselves. What they find changes them, andleads to questioning of everyday understandings that are otherwisetaken for granted. Likewise my ethnographic journey leads meonward, from one site of practice to the next, and my personal158 The dance of the ancestors"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"understandings of self and other, community and friendship, arealtered.

It has been pointed out thatindividuals use the word ‘archetype’ in diverse ways and that Jung’sown meaning may not be too far from an Ásatrú conception of deities.In a recent debate via an email discussion list, it was pointed out thatnewcomers to Ásatrú speak of the God/esses as archetypes, while ‘oldhands’ speak of them as ‘real’. From the point of view of discourseanalysis, part of this may be that exposure to Ásatrú discourse ‘permits’a person to come to speak and think of deities existing independentlyof people without feeling they will be regarded as ‘flaky’. In myinterviews, some do use the concept of archetypes, and it seems thatthey do so to express something that has its being on a cultural orsocial level, rather than uniquely within the individual psyche (which ishow the word is often used by neo-pagans).4 Alternatively, the spirits may be called to the person who seeks theiraid. This point is currently debated by the community, sometimesheatedly. In either case, the construction of the activity is one thatinvolves active seeking or calling, followed by dialogue and oftennegotiation.5 Snorri Sturluson, whose Edda, written in the early thirteenth century asa guide to help young poets who required to know their mythology, isthe most coherent account of the mythology and cosmology of theNorth of Europe: though it is set within a euhemerised-Christianisedframework, and may be over-systematised due to the author’s familiar-ity with Greco-Roman mythology.6Vardlokur, of which the meaning remains obscure.

(p. 69),and suggests that an automatic reading of ‘witch’ as negative is aproduct of Western ethnocentrism.

The study is complicated, butseems to suggest support for association of the art components withaltered consciousness states, and at some locations specifically withpsilocybin, thus giving some support for hypothesised use ofP.semilanceatain achieving the state relating to the art.4 It is worth noting at this point that some otherAmanitas, notably A.phalloidesand A. virosa, are indeed deadly poisonous: and thatalthough from most illustrations there seems little likelihood ofmistaking A. muscariafor either of those, mushrooms in the field donot always look quite like mushrooms in the book.

They have a few adherents within the community: however, onthe whole the community rejects them, as do academics today, as beingattempts to create an artificial order based on flawed methodologicalprinciples and nineteenth-century definitions of deity. See Rydberg1906 (Norroena Society translation, containing the first three volumesof Rydberg’s six–volume Swedish work). I should perhaps add that I donot recommend this as an introduction to Norse mythology!3 ‘Heidr’ may not be a personal name, but simply a word for ‘magicworker’ that refers here to Gullveig. Indeed, Boyer (1983) points outthat ‘We do not know whether Heidr represents Gullveig, or the sybilherself who has been speaking since the beginning of the poem... orelse the sorceress who invented seidr (Freyja?)’ (1983: 122). So even theequation of Heidr and Freyja is complex and may be attained by morethan one route.4 Though claims regarding their numbers have been much exaggerated,charges, trials and at times executions, did none the less occur.5 According to Christina Larner (1981) those who used their talents to healwere regarded by churchmen as moreevil than those who did not do so.7Ergiseidmen, queer transformations?1 And indeed addressed also in the article (Blain and Wallis 1999) in ThePomegranate, to which she was responding.2Nidrequires some explanation.

Ido not share her speculation on this, but concur in seeing Ódinn ascentral to Norse ‘shamanic’ practice, ambiguous, feared, and in thesense used by her (1999a), again following Halperin (1995), ‘queer’.However, Grundy does not regard Ódinn as a shaman, and suggeststhat (at least in the literature and in the interpretations of its writers)the hanging on Yggdrasill is not partial, and Ódinn should be seen as agod who died physically. Shamanistically these interpretations may notbe in conflict.6 The poem is given in the fourteenth-century manuscript Flateyarbók,and this verse quoted – differently – in Snorri’s Edda.Eru völvur allarfrá Vídólfi,vitkar allirfrá Vilmeidi,skilberendur [seidberendurfrom Snorri’s Edda]frá Svarthöfda,jötnar allirfrá Ymi komnir(Hyndluljód32, Sigurdsson 1998: 402)7 Though it must be remembered that, for some in today’s multivocalcommunity at least,ergiand seidr do indicate transgression, according tothe comments made to Jordsvin and others. Seidr is contested practice.8 This story indeed holds many meanings. It is cited by both academicsand Heathens as indicating a ‘cult of Freyr’ in which the god’s statue istaken around the country in a wagon, and parallels with the ‘cult ofNerthus’ (described in Tacitus’Germania) thereby drawn.9 A number of these apparent staffs are metal. Price’s work includes a re-evaluation of them, in a context of seidr as shamanic practice in lateIron Age Scandinavia.10 Also, Solli mentions white phallic stones (1999b) associated with iron-age burials – speculating these may have associations with sacredness,164 Notes"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"alternate gendering, and shamanic practice, several centuries before the‘Viking age’.11 It could be speculated that the openness associated with the seidr trancein a community environment was still a problem – either that theinsights afforded therein were given to all, regardless of their degree ofkinship with the speaker, or that the seidwoman was deliberatelyputting herself into a relation of reliance on the audience/participantswho might not be kin to her (which could even be seen as a kind ofpromiscuity, thus linking to the common meaning of the term appliedto women).8 The dance of the ancestors1 ‘. . . the shaman specialised in a trance during which his soul is believedto leave his body and ascend to the sky or descend to the underworld’(Eliade 1964: 4–5). Note the ‘is believed to’: Heinze (1991) points outthat Eliade did not ‘believe in’ either the shaman’s spirits or her/hisjourney.2 Long-term shamanistic practitioners who have spoken with me quiteemphatically do not view workshop attendees as ‘shamans’. Some ofthe workshop attendees, however, do use the term of themselves.
