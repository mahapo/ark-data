Robin Flower) How should we approach a religion of the past when it has left no creed for usto study, no sacred books or descriptions of rituals, no life of its founder and,indeed, little trace of the religious leaders and thinking minds who contributedto its development? Sometimes it is only possible to put together a fewfragments of recorded beliefs and practices, to study carved stones or to findtraces of mythology in legends and folk traditions and the tentativeinterpretation of names of nearly forgotten deities. This is roughly the positionwith the beliefs of some of the peoples of northern Europe, such as the Finno-Ugrians (including the Saami or Lapps and the Estonians), the Balts (includingthe Lithuanians and the Letts) and the Slavs. Traces of their mythology survivein folklore and folk art, and archaic features of surviving Baltic languages makethe names of super-natural beings of much interest to scholars. In Finland thematerial collected by Lönnrot in the early nineteenth century, found in the laysmaking up the Kalevala, indicates a fine heritage of mythological tradition, butafter so long a space of time there is little definite evidence from which toreconstruct ritual and belief (Honko 1987). In the case of the Celtic andGermanic peoples, however, the position is different, in studying their religionwe are faced with many problems and there are vast gaps in our knowledge,but we have evidence from early art and archaeology in many different regions,and in addition an extensive early literature from medieval Ireland and Iceland.Although this was recorded by Christian chroniclers and story-tellers, in mostcases in monasteries, it has, nevertheless, preserved a1 good deal of informationabout pre-Christian traditions and myths. Antiquarian enthusiasm for the pastand the lively spirit of many of the old tales have ensured their continuedexistence in manuscripts and popular oral tradition long after Christianity wasfirmly established. It should therefore be possible to build up at least a partialpicture of the old religion of north-western Europe, provided we realize thepossibilities and limitations of the sources available."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION2How much is known of these peoples whom we call the Celts and theGermans? The terms ‘Keltoi’ or ‘Celti’, and in some cases ‘Galati’ and ‘Galli’,were used by Greeks and Romans for the northern barbarians who at timesposed a considerable threat to the Mediterranean countries and dominatedmuch of western and central Europe. Such terms seem to have been first usedby the Greeks of the people north of Massilia, a Greek colony in southernFrance, while the Latin term first occurs in a poem by Rufus Festus Avienus,Ora Maritima, in the fourth century BC (Rankin 1987:1 ff.). The Celts movedin many directions, invading Italy and Greece and sacking Rome and Delphi,settling in Spain and as far east as Turkey, where St Paul knew them as the‘Galatians’. However, those who spoke the Celtic language in Europe have leftno literature, and only traces remain in inscriptions and the names of placesand persons. At some time in the first millenium BC, although the date is muchdisputed, they reached the British Isles. The Gaelic form of their language wasspoken in Ireland and taken into Scotland and the Isle of Man, while theBrittonic form spoken in southern Britain survived in Wales and Cornwall andalso in Brittany, where it was probably taken by refugees from Britain. It is fromtraditions preserved in the literature of these countries that we are able to learnsomething of Celtic religion before the coming of Christianity.It was after the discoveries made in the salt-mines at Hallstatt in Austria in1846, and a few years later at La Tène in Switzerland, that the existence ofCeltic art was recognized for the first time. At Hallstatt there were a numberof rich burials, while weapons and other objects of metal had been thrown intothe lake at La Tène, which apparently had been a place of offering. The term‘Hallstatt’ was used for the styles of art of the early Celtic period, from about700 to 500 BC, and ‘La Tène’ for the later period, during which the art becameeven more original and striking. The furnishing of rich graves showed that theCelts had traded with Etruria and Greece, but they had also produced their ownworks of art, impressive in their individuality. As more material becameavailable for study, it grew clear that many of these were of symbolic andreligious significance. There were powerful figures in stone, which might begods or ancestors, rich graves where both men and women were buried withwagons or chariots under burial mounds, many heads carved in stone, andoccasional ritual groups in metal, like the little Strettweg Wagon on which agroup of men and women with two stags have been placed around what seemsto be a goddess (p. 24). In the La Tène period the metalwork was particularlystriking, with complex linear patterns, spirals and foliage, as well as humanfaces and naturalistic animals and birds, often suggesting deliberate symbolism.When this style of art died out on the continent, it continued in the British Isles,and its final expression can be recognized in the splendid illuminatedmanuscripts and carved crosses of the Christian period. Ireland never cameunder Roman rule, and not only did the art there develop freely from earlierCeltic traditions, but a rich literature grew up in the early Middle Ages whichreflected in its heroic tales a life-style of kings and warriors very similar to that"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION3of the Celts as earlier Greek and Roman writers haddescribed them. It is nowbecoming recognized to an increasing degree that these tales have evolved in aChristian setting, and were intended for sophisticated audiences of a verydifferent kind, but this does not mean that some early traditions cannot befound in the tales, antiquarian prose works and poems (McCone 1990:3 ff.).The most impressive study of the Celtic peoples in early times was that ofPosidonius, a Syrian Greek who died about 50 BC. He went to considerabletrouble to gather information about their customs and way of life, andalthough his original work is lost, it is so often quoted by later writers that it ispossible to reconstruct much of what he wrote (Tierney 1959–60). He and laterhistorians interested in the Celts all emphasize their reckless courage andferocity in battle, where they often fought naked, as they are sometimesdepicted in classical art. There is general agreement as to Celtic enthusiasm forfine clothes, ornaments and elaborate hair-styles. Apparently they spent muchtime in feasting and drinking, and set great value on magnificent and impulsivehospitality, expecting generous treatment from the leaders whom they followedinto battle. Their less endearing qualities were boastfulness and vanity, with atendency to flare up at some imagined insult. Celtic chiefs were notorious forindependence and touchiness and constantly quarrelled among themselves; hadit not been for this, they would have been a far more serious threat to theirsouthern neighbours. Classical writers were shocked and fascinated by theirferocious treatment of defeated enemies, and by their passion for head-huntingand preserving the skulls of the slain. Celtic disregard for human life, on adifferent level from the cold inhumanity of the Romans when putting downinsurrection, caught the imagination of historians and artists. They werefurther fascinated by rumours and theories concerning the learning andpractices of the druids, whom some regarded as natural philosophers andothers as savage priests encouraging resistance to Rome.The Germanic peoples who also settled in the British Isles cannot be traced backas far as the Celts, and their origins prove elusive, although their language, like thatof the Celts, belonged to the Indo-European group (Mallory 1989:84 ff.; 95 ff.).The Romans used the term ‘Germania’ for the area enclosed by the Rhine, theVistula and the Danube, where tribes speaking an early form of Germanic causedmuch trouble to them in the Rhineland. According to Julius Caesar, the Germanswere settled to the east of the Rhine in the first century BC, with the Celts on theother side, but this must be a misleading simplification of the confused situationthat actually prevailed there. Germani in Latin means ‘children of the same parent’,and seems originally to have been a tribal name, possibly even the name of a Celtictribe. It is often not possible to know whether the language of a certain tribe wasGermanic or Celtic, but the earliest Germanic-speaking peoples were distributedfairly widely over northern Germany and southern Scandinavia, and thengradually spread through modern Holland, Denmark, Poland, Czechoslovakiaand southern Russia, crossing into England in the fifth century AD. How early theirlanguage can be traced back is an unsettledquestion (Todd 1975:19; Mallory"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION41989:87). The earliest Germanic text is in Gothic—an East Germanic languagethat was spoken up to the sixteenth century—since parts of the Bible weretranslated into Gothic by Bishop Wulfilas in the fourth century AD.The outstanding source for the life of the Germanic people at the end of thefirst century AD is the short monograph of Tacitus On the Origin and Geographyof Germania (generally known as Germania). Tacitus was a close friend of theyounger Pliny, whose father had served on both the Upper and the Lower Rhineand written twenty books on the Roman campaigns there, unhappily now lost.He could also have been in touch with soldiers and merchants who could givehim information. His book shows the lively interest that educated Romans tookin the northern barbarians, and he deliberately stresses the contrast between thetough upbringing of German youth and the luxury and corruption of Romansociety. He praises their warrior ideals and their loyalty to their leaders, whilenoting that when not engaged in battle they spent much time in indolence,drinking and boasting of their exploits, while their wives and older folks did muchof the hard everyday work. He realized that there were considerable localdifferences between the tribes, and recorded what he could find out of theirreligious practices; his picture of a warrior society is on the whole in agreementwith that given in later Germanic heroic poetry. Although doubts have been caston his reliability, the information he gives has been confirmed rather thandisproved as archaeological evidence enables us to build up a fuller picture of lifein Germania and in the Roman period.Clearly Celts and Germans had much in common, and were in close touchwith one another in the Rhineland in Roman times, again in Britain in the fifthcentury AD, and in the British Isles in the Viking Age, even though they mightbe fighting one another for dominion or territory. Their life-styles were similar,and it is often impossible to decide from burial customs or archaeological remainswhether a particular settlement was Celtic or Germanic. But language, after all,was an essential difference (Evans 1982), and their literature, art and mythologydeveloped in different ways. The tendency now is to see them as distinct cultures,and to ignore the strong links that undoubtedly existed between the thought-patterns and world-pictures on which the myths were based. In each case theculture was an oral one, since writing and the Roman alphabet only came in withthe establishment of the Christian church. Before this the only permanent recordswere Germanic runic inscriptions from about the second century AD onwards,and a few in Ogam ceremonial script (Dillon and Chadwick 1967:207). Runicinscriptions were used for memorials of people or events, to record short poems,and to inscribe names of makers or owners on precious objects, as well as forspells or charms, but early inscriptions are unfortunately difficult to interpret.There has been much discussion as to how far runes were used for religiouspurposes (Flowers 1986). Writing is believed to have been known to the Celticdruids, but it was never widely practised or used for transmission of religioustradition, with the result that no collections of sacredwriting survive(Guyonvarc’h and Le Roux 1982:263 ff.)."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION5The Germanic peoples established areas of settlement as the power of theRoman Empire declined, in what is known as the Migration Period, from thethird to the sixth century AD. The Franks moved into Gaul, and were convertedto Christianity early; the Visigoths went into Spain, the Lombards andOstrogoths into Italy, and the Alamanni into southern Germany and Switzerland.Angles and Saxons from the Danish peninsula and northern Germany arrivedas military war-bands and also as settlers in southern and eastern England, andabsorbed, overcame or drove westwards the Celtic peoples living there. TheChristian church had already been established to a limited extent in RomanBritain, and some of the new settlers were in close touch with the ChristianFranks, so that when Augustine came to Kent in 597 to establish the new faith,his mission proved successful. Christianity had also been established in Irelandby St Patrick and others, and monks from monasteries in the Celtic west helpedto convert Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, and worked as missionaries in Frisia andGermany. Bede’s account of the conversion, written in the eighth century, givessome glimpses of opposition to the new faith, as do also some of the early Livesof Christian saints; but information about the pre-Christian religion comesmainly from archaeological evidence gained from rich graves and extensivecemeteries of the early settlement, from place—and personal names, andfragments of literary and antiquarian material.The position was very different in the Scandinavian countries, where the oldreligion was not given up until some centuries after the conversion of Britain.Scandinavia at this time consisted of many small kingdoms constantly fightingamong themselves, with frequent changes of ruling dynasties. The northernpeoples remained outside the Christian church, in spite of many contacts withChristians and attempts by St Anskar and others from Germany to win over therulers and set up churches in the market-towns. Not until the second half of thetenth century did Denmark accept the new faith, and Norway a little later, as theresult of the vigorous efforts of Olaf Tryggvason. Iceland made Christianity theofficial religion in the year 1000, while Sweden held out until well into theeleventh century. It is therefore mainly on Scandinavian material from the closeof the pre-Christian period that we have to rely for knowledge of the earlierreligions of north-west Europe, as will become clear in the course of this study.Like the Celts and Germans, the Scandinavians began to expand in variousdirections from the eighth century onwards, in search of trade and plunder, andthe period of their restless activities in Europe and beyond is known as the VikingAge. In some areas they seized land and established colonies, but their expansiondiffered from the earlier ones because they did not move as tribes from theirhomelands. They went out as individuals or in small local and family groups;many were young men in search of wealth and renown, together with farmerswho left their homes for the summer to be run by their wives and slave labour,while others travelled as merchant-adventurers and hoped to return after yearsabroad to buy land with their profits. Viking warriors were largely organizedinsmall bands or ships’ crews, joining together in temporary alliances for military"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION6expeditions, trading voyages or piracy. They might serve under famous leadersfor a while, and then break up again, although sometimes they built up extensivearmies or large fleets of warships, like the forces that invaded England in 866 orthose that attacked cities in Merovingian France. Their fine ships and expertseamanship gave them mastery of the northern seas, and enabled them to travelfar. They moved westwards to the British Isles, the Faroes, Orkney and Shetland,Greenland and the western shores of North America, as well as southwards toSpain, southern France and the Mediterranean. They went eastwards fromSweden along the Russian rivers to markets such as Bulgar on the Volga, andultimately down the Dnieper to the ‘Great City’, their name for Constantinople.They went in search of silver and goods, gaining what they wanted by trading,raiding, imposing tribute on weaker people like the Lapps and the Slavs,ransoming prisoners or selling them as slaves, and earning payment for fightingas mercenaries in foreign kingdoms. In pursuit of their aims they endured greathardships, embarking on long journeys through difficult terrain and bitterweather, risking organized resistance or attacks from savage tribes. While theycame into contact with the Christian church in their wanderings, they werereluctant to pay it more than lip-service, and were prepared to rob and pillagerich monasteries and churches if the opportunity offered.The Vikings in their turbulent adventuring displayed some of the samequalities and weaknesses as their predecessors had done. They fought with aterrible ferocity that shocked those who witnessed it, and yet we know thatmany of them were also able farmers and good family men, returning to theland after a few years of raiding. They were loyal to their leaders and comrades,although apt to be independent and quarrelsome, and seldom able to combinesuccessfully under one supreme commander. They were opportunists, excellingin rapid attacks from the sea and escaping before any force could be organizedto oppose them. They resembled the Celts in a love of fine clothes, well-groomed hair and showy ornaments, and also in their admiration forgenerosity and hospitality. The Vikings made few permanent settlements, butone outstanding achievement was the establishment of an independent colonyor free state in the uninhabited island of Iceland, which lasted until the islandcame under Norwegian rule in the thirteenth century. Here the law was thesupreme arbiter, and there was no single ruler at the head as in other medievalkingdoms. It is from Iceland that our most valuable material on early religionin the north is obtained, for when writing came in with Christianity in theeleventh century, the Icelanders recorded all they could about its settlement andearly history, of which they were justifiably proud. The government and lawsystem of Iceland was set up by men who were whole-hearted supporters ofthe old religion of the northern gods, and thus we have a unique opportunityto observe how they went about it and where their priorities lay.Since we are nearer in time to the Vikings than to the Celts and continentalGermans before their conversion to Christianity, we have more hope of learningsomething of their religious beliefs and practices. However, their culture too"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION7wasoral, and there is little literature recorded in the Viking Age itself by thosewho had not become Christian. We depend on memories of that period reflectedmostly in Icelandic sources recorded after the conversion. There are valuableaccounts of the settlement of Iceland and histories of the early kings of Norway,and also a rich collection of Icelandic Family Sagas. These consist of prose tales,varying from short stories to what might be regarded as novels, dealing with theexploits and relationships of leading Icelanders in the early days of thecommonwealth. These are partly based on family traditions and historic events,and partly fictitious. Some are clumsily put together, but the finest, such as NjálsSaga and Egils Saga, may be regarded as historical novels of outstanding quality.These sagas are of a very different nature from the heroic tales of Ireland,preserved mainly in manuscripts of the twelfth century, but in many casesjudged to be considerably earlier than this. In both cases it appears that earlymotifs and traditions going back to pre-Christian times have been deliberatelyemployed by skilful story-tellers and poets of Christian communities, familiarwith the medieval learned literature of their own time. In the Irish prose tales,old gods and goddesses may appear as kings and queens in an heroic setting ofstruggles between neighbouring kingdoms, and mighty achievements andtragic losses are seen against a background of portents and marvels, while poetsand druids comment on the inevitability of fate. A favourite theme is a journeyto a super-natural world by entry into a fairy mound or by a voyage over thesea. The setting of the Icelandic sagas is more realistic, even though the maincharacters may be portrayed as far larger than life. Traditions about vengeancekillings and dominant local characters, preserved in popular tales, have mergedwith influences from romance literature and heroic poetry from the Germanicpast, and out of this fruitful combination outstanding works of tragic andcomic narrative have come into being. The background is that of farmstead,pasture and dairy, and heroic combats take place over winter fodder, strandedwhales or the burning of woodland, against the austere setting of a bleak islandwhere constant hard work and good luck were necessary for survival, whilebattles in the lawcourts are as exciting as those in the countryside.These Family Sagas do not contain a great deal of information about the earlyreligion, since the past tends to be viewed through the eyes of thirteeenth-centuryantiquarians, and the idea that the tales are a faithfully preserved record of theearly period has long been abandoned. On the other hand, family traditions couldbe long-lived, and some of the material is based on pre-Christian poetry. A littlemay be learned also from the legendary sagas, the Sagas of Old Times. These dealwith the adventures of kings and princes in early Scandinavia and of daringIcelanders away from home, most of them imaginary characters of invinciblestrength and bravery, and again show the influence of the romances. However,in some cases earlier heroic poems have been used as a source, and there arescattered memories of the cults of the old gods in the Scandinavian homelands.In their enthusiasm to preserve all they could of their past, even though itmightbe a pagan past, the Icelanders recorded much early poetry. Poems on"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION8mythological themes have been mostly preserved in a precious manuscript of thethirteenth century, the Codex Regius, copied from an earlier one, generallyknown as the Elder or Poetic Edda. These deal with adventures of the gods, andwith wisdom-contests between supernatural beings, and some may date back tothe pre-Christian period. There are also many short poems by Icelandic poets(skalds) whose names are known, which come under the general heading ofSkaldic Verse. They are in a complex, artificial style, with much use ofmythological imagery, and this forms an important source for our knowledgeof the supernatural world, since a number of poems predate the conversion andsome go back to the ninth century. In addition, we have the treatise known asthe Prose Edda by Snorri Sturluson, a brilliant writer and master of Icelandicprose, as well as a poet in his own right. He was a member of one of the mostpowerful Icelandic families, who took a leading part in politics (resulting in hisassassination in 1241), but who was also an historian with an intense interest inthe past of Iceland and Norway. He set out in the Prose Edda to provide a guideto young poets in a Christian society by retelling the old myths and collectinginformation from early poetry about the gods and their world, illustrated bymany quotations and ending with a treatise on metre. This work is a treasure-house of material, and it would be difficult to gain any coherent picture ofScandinavian mythology without it. Snorri was one of the few scholars workingoutside a monastery; he possessed true scholarly integrity, and an ardent curiosityabout the past without any desire to draw moral lessons from it.If we are to search out the nature of northern religion before the coming ofChristianity, it is clearly necessary to be prepared to range over a wide field;evidence may come from historical records, early literature and language, place—and personal names, archaeological discoveries and iconography, as well as thecomments of outsiders and the speculations of Christian scholars concerning pastbeliefs and practices. The Celts and Germans (including the northern Vikings inthe latter class) shared a common heritage and way of life, in spite of considerabledifferences in date and background. Their societies were predominantly warriorones, with many small kingdoms and restless war-bands, run by leaders who hadto justify their authority by skill and courage and good fortune in battle if theywere to hold the loyalty of their followers. Their religion had to be one suitablefor a world of continual challenge and struggle for survival in a demandingenvironment. Much of the religious tradition that survives has to do with theobtaining of victory and good fortune in battle; another important element is thereliance on divine powers when choosing a king who will achieve prosperity forhis people and maintain a good relationship with the Otherworld. Thefruitfulness of the land and the achieving of good harvests was of tremendousimportance in the treacherous northern regions, where both sunshine and rainmight be denied to the farmers and the summer was short, giving way in the mostarctic regions to the almost total darkness of winter. These needs were linked withregular sacrifice to the gods at certain turning-points in the year,ceremonies inwhich all men and women took part, and also with the importance of the central"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION9place of assembly, the holy centre for every district where contact might be madewith the divine world.The link between religion and traditional wisdom was also a powerful one,and sufficient memory of seers and seeresses, poets and druids and lawmenhas survived in the written sources to indicate a rich store of oral lore passedon to each new generation. Much of this has disappeared for ever, but stillthe impression left behind is strong. Skill in words was valued by thesepeoples as much as valour in battle; they all delighted in riddles, word-games,intricate poetic language and skill in argument. The Celts in the secondcentury BC, according to Diodorus Siculus, made use of riddling speech andhinted at meanings, leaving much unsaid. We know that the Scandinavianstook great pleasure in puns and complex riddles and the intricacies of skaldicverse. It is unlikely that they would display a childish naïvety in their myths,although one possible result of such subtlety in use of words might be thatthose who came into contact with them failed to understand their religiousbeliefs. Oratory, word-skills and inspiration were all seen as gifts from thegods, while the upholding of law was part of the divine order; it is essentialto remember this and not to undervalue the significance of their myths ordismiss them as childish fantasies.There is no doubt that the way back to a lost religion is not easy, and earlierattempts to interpret northern mythology should warn us how easy it is to startwith preconceptions, insisting on one particular line of approach to theexclusion of all else. At one time legends of the supernatural world wereexplained as varieties of sun myths, and sun gods and sun weapons identifiedin the early tales and legends. In the early twentieth century Mogk madedogmatic statements rejecting Snorri’s picture of the supernatural world aswithout any firm foundation, while—as an example of the oppositeapproach—the Swedish scholar Rydborg accepted everything in Old Norseliterature as trusty and reliable, weaving an ingenious tapestry into which everystrange detail in the poems and tales was fitted. Among other problems, wehave to distinguish between the mythological material composed in a Christiansociety for purposes of entertainment and the conceptions that have beenpassed down from the pre-Christian period. Most of our evidence comes fromthe period immediately before the conversion, but the religion of the Celts andGermans stretches far back into the darkness of earlier centuries. It must havedeveloped in different ways over the wide area of north-western Europe in theprocess of time. Moreover, the religions of neighbouring peoples, the variouscults of the Roman Empire, and the teachings of the Christian church insurrounding countries were bound to have influence on it. We must avoidpicturing one clear-cut and easily defined religious faith, seeing it rather as ageneral world-picture or a group of prevailing assumptions and beliefs,reflected in imagery and practice that were shared by the Celtic and Germanpeoples before Christianity. It is for this reason that some Celtic and earlyGermanic material needs to be considered along with the later evidence from"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION10Scandinavia. In spite of the problems and frustrating gaps in ourknowledge,we are surely fortunate to possess so much material of varying kinds on whichto draw. The nature of this material and the problems and rewards encounteredin interpreting it will be the subject of the following chapters.It must be stressed that this will not be a straightforward account of themyths and beliefs of the peoples of north-west Europe. It is proposed insteadto consider the differing kinds of evidence in turn, to see what particularproblems each presents, and how each has been used to build up ourunderstanding of the religious background. It is necessary also to realize thatour interpretation of any past religion must be influenced to some extent bythe thought-patterns of our own time and the prevailing fashions amongscholars. Whenever the work of some outstanding thinker sets us on a newcourse in the interpretation of past religions, there is a period when the evidenceis seen in a fresh light. Sometimes the exciting theories prove unreliable as timegoes on and disciples of the master exaggerate this particular approach, buteven when a reaction against them sets in, they may have contributedsomething to our better understanding. Various approaches towards thereligion that preceded Christianity in north-west Europe will be consideredtherefore in the final chapter. The intention is to show both how complex andincomplete is the evidence on which we rely, so that a number of differentconclusions may be drawn from it, and yet at the same time how the gradualbuilding-up of the evidence over a wide field is making a fuller understandingpossible. Popular books on mythology seldom reveal the sources of the theorieson myths and cults and deities that they confidently present, and it seemstherefore worth while to explore the sources of our information rather thanto present it as a complete and reliable whole."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"111Help from ArchaeologyMany such ancient treasures lay within that house of earth, the vast heritageof a noble race, hidden there by someone in times gone by, with deliberateintent.(Beowulf 2231–6) There is a good reason for starting with archaeological evidence for a lostreligion: it is the only evidence that goes back to the early periods of Celtic andGermanic culture, far beyond that of the written sources in north-west Europe,while in later periods it may confirm or throw new light on conclusions drawnfrom written sources. There is much detailed evidence both from excavatedsites and from cult objects that have been discovered accidentally, and this hascontributed to our knowledge and also to our problems over the years. Someof the most important finds, like the Gallehus gold horns and the GundestrupCauldron, were found before the twentieth century began; much valuableevidence from graves was destroyed in the past, by both grave-robbers andirresponsible excavators, while the provenance of important early finds oftenremains unknown. In more recent years there have been expert investigationsof sites that would have attracted little interest earlier, like that of the Ango-Saxon centre at Yeavering in Northumberland. Now if a rich wagon-burial orship-grave is discovered, it will be investigated and recorded with all the newskills available, while the exploration of early cemeteries goes far beyond theselection of valuable artefacts and destruction of anything else, which was oncethe pastime of many landowners. Work has also progressed on the iconographyof carved stones from the pre-Christian or early Christian periods in the north.To deal adequately with the archaeological finds that have some bearing onthe pre-Christian religion would require a book in itself, and perhaps severalvolumes. Here only a small number of examples has been selected, of widelydiffering types, to give some idea of the way in which archaeological discoveriesmay contribute to our knowledge of the religious past, especially when theycan be linked with evidence from literary sources. They show also how difficultit is to draw reliable conclusions about beliefs from material remains or earlyworks of religious art alone, with no additional help from written records.

Greek and Latin commentators on the religionof these peoples indicate that most of their ceremonies were conducted out ofdoors, and for centuries their holy places appear to have been in forest clearings,on hilltops, on the shores of lakes or on islands. Such sites can offer little chanceof identification if there were no buildings or carved stones to mark them out.The kind of evidence we may hope for is a boundary ditch enclosing a temenosor sacred space, inside which there may be signs of burning, animal or humanremains, post-holes, ritual pits, and occasionally altars or isolated finds.One example of an early Celtic site is at Aulnay-aux-Planches (Marne) inFrance (Brisson and Hatt 1953). This is a group of three cemeteries excavatedat various times between 1927 and 1951, and the site appears to have been inuse for a period of over four centuries, from the end of the tenth to the sixthcentury BC. The earliest graves, probably those of a semi-nomadic peoplesettling near the ancient highway, were flat cremation ones. The secondFigure 1 Plans of sacred sites at (a) Aulnay-aux-Planches (Marne), France and (b)Libenice, Czechoslovakia (after Piggort)."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"HELP FROM ARCHAEOLOGY13cemetery seemed more organized, with the graves possibly protected by stones,and contained some examples of partial cremation; it was near this that a largeritual enclosure was found, thought to be of about the same date. The thirdgroup of graves included a number surrounded by circular ditches, thought tohave been under small mounds, possibly the graves of new arrivals withdifferent burial customs. Flat cremation graves continued at the same time.There were 28 mounds in all.The enclosure by the second group of graves was about 89 m×15 m, andsurrounded by a ditch about 2 m in width. It contained a central grave, in whichthere was an urn holding bones, with some small pots around it. There wereother cremation graves, together with an adult skeleton with no grave goods,and in another pit the bones of an infant. There were traces of marked or shapedstones which seemed originally to have been arranged in lines (Figure 1a).This is an important site, indicating that some kind of ritual associated withthe dead went on in the early Hallstatt period, inside a closed space. It evidentlyincluded animal sacrifice, since bones of various mammals were found,including dog, fox and young boar, and perhaps human sacrifice also. It is noteasy, however, to establish the exact sequence of graves in the enclosure, andwe can make no definite assumptions as to the kinds of rites that took placethere, or to what supernatural powers those taking part may have addressedthemselves. We cannot say whether the enclosure was in use at regular festivalsor in times of crisis, or for the funerals of important people. We do not knowif the graves it contained were those of people of high rank, or whether somerepresent human sacrifice. Here we are dependent on informed guesses, basedon what the archaeological evidence suggests, and on what we expect of thereligion of the early Celts.Comparisons have been made between this site and another at Libenice nearKolin in Czechoslovakia, this time an oval enclosure surrounded by a ditch,excavated in 1959 (Filip 1976:83 ff.; see Figure 1b). Inside, near the centre, wasthe grave of a woman, buried with elaborate jewellery of about the thirdcentury BC. At the eastern end were pits which seem to have been dug out morethan once, possibly for libations, as well as pairs of post-holes. At the foot ofwhat must have been two large posts were two neck-rings of bronze, whichcould have hung on these or been worn by wooden figures set up there. Therewere also animal bones, and the graves of four other people, including a child.In addition, there was a standing stone, roughly pyramidal in shape, a pitshaped rather like a keyhole, and stone blocks which may have formed an altar.This has led to suggestions that here we have the grave of a priestess of the LaTène period, that idols with torcs round their necks stood in the enclosure, andthat human and animal sacrifices took place there, while a skull among thefinds was used for libations.Once again, however, there are extensive gaps in our knowledge. It isdifficult to decide on the date of the enclosure, or how long it was in use; anexisting sacred place may have been utilized by those who buried the woman"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE14there with careful funeral rites. We suffer from the lack of other excavated sitesfor comparison, although a considerable number of possible ritual enclosuresin Celtic territory are now known, and one can hardly make a direct link withthe site at Aulnay-aux-Planches when so many centuries divide the two. All thatmay be safely concluded is that there were enclosed places—and often theposition of these is worth studying—where some kind of ritual activity andanimal sacrifices took place which may have been associated with the dead.The hope is always that such scattered sites may be matched with furtherdiscoveries of a similar kind, so that the gaps in the puzzle grow smaller.THE BURIAL AT VIXThe Celts as we encounter them in the literature seem to be dominated bypowerful and energetic leaders, both men and women. It seems possibletherefore that something might be learned of their ideas about the Otherworldfrom the way in which leading members of society were disposed of after death.One of the most dramatic discoveries of this century was that of a grave at Vixin the upper valley of the Seine, containing a woman of about 35 years of age,buried with considerable pomp. This was discovered in 1953 and excavatedby Joffroy (Joffroy 1962). The tumulus that originally covered the burialchamber had disappeared, and the chamber had escaped discovery because itwas dug out below ground level. The original mound must have beenenormous, since the diameter of the base was about 42 m. In the burialchamber, which was almost square, there was a wagon with its wheels detachedand propped against the east wall, with stones to wedge them in place. Thewagon was in the centre of the chamber, and inside it the woman had beenplaced in a sitting position with her legs stretched out; Joffroy assumed thatthe wagon had been used as a litter supported by bearers to carry her to thetomb, and that horses had not been employed, since no harness was found.The most striking object in the chamber was a crater, a type of vessel usedat feasts for mixing wine and water (Figure 2). A number of such vessels, ofGreek origin, have been recovered from Celtic graves, but this one wasenormous, far larger than any other example known. It stood 1.64 m high(about 5′5′′), and weighed 208 kg (about 470 lbs). Joffroy (1962:126) claimedit would have held about 1,200 litres of liquid. He concluded that it would havebeen impracticable for use at a feast because of the difficulties in serving winefrom it, and that the wagon might have been used to transport it to the grave.It was of skilful and elaborate workmanship with splendid decoration. On eachside of the handle was the familiar gorgon head usually found on craters, butin this case executed with unusual power and restraint. Round the neck was afrieze of warriors, some marching and others driving in four-horse chariots. Onthe lid was the figure of a woman resembling a seeress, wearing a veil over herhead and shoulders and with one arm outstretched. Other objects in the chamber included bowls, jugs and metal vessels of"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"HELP FROM ARCHAEOLOGY15various kinds, as well as bowls in Greek figured ware. These, however, are notvessels associated with feasts, but rather suggest the dispensing of liquid inceremonial rites, and one object found was thought to be an aspergill used forsprinkling. A large piece of red material, possibly leather, had been laid overthe objects, which Joffroy thought might have been a tent. The dead womanwas richly adorned with jewellery. A magnificent diadem of gold was still inplace on her head, ending in two huge knobs of gold, with little winged horsesat the points where these were joined to the curved headpiece. She worebrooches and necklaces, as well as bracelets on her wrists and ankles, while alarge bronze torc lay upon her body. In spite of damage from the collapse ofthe ceiling and flooding of the chamber, it has proved possible to restore thecrater, wagon and other pieces, so that the quality of their workmanship canbe appreciated.Not surprisingly, there has been much discussion concerning the contentsof this tomb. One explanation for the enormous crater was that it was adiplomatic gift to a reigning queen, but this seems unlikely. The most interestingsuggestion is that made by Bourriot (1965). He argued that this outsize vesselwas probably a special offering made for a shrine, like the two huge cratersmentioned by Herodotus (I, 51) as sent by Croesus to Delphi and placed in thetemple there. He thought that it was never intended for mixing wine becauseof its size and weight, but that it might be used for sacrificial blood. There is aFigure 2 Crater from Vix grave. Drawing by Eileen Aldworth."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE16well-known passage from Strabo (Geography VII, 2.3) describing white-hairedpriestesses of the Cimbri climbing ladders to cut the throats of prisoners of war,who were suspended over enormous vessels of bronze (the term krater is usedat one point) in order to judge from the flow of blood what the outcome of acampaign would be. This would suggest that the woman at Vix was a priestessor seeress, although she might also be a princess in her own right. The vesselwould then have belonged to a local shrine, probably on Mount Lassois nearthe grave. If it was made as a gift, the choice of the procession of warriors withchariots, together with a sinister gorgon head and a figure on the lid resemblinga seeress, would be appropriate for a vessel destined as an offering to a deityof war served by a priestess.This is an attractive idea, in spite of difficulties that Bourriot himselfacknowledges. There is a considerable gap between the Vix grave of the sixthcentury BC and the writings of Strabo, who died in AD 25, although he may beusing information from an earlier source, and it is possible that such divinationceremonies associated with warfare were kept up for centuries. There is as yetno evidence for a sanctuary on Mount Lassois, although the possibility cannotbe ruled out. White-haired priestesses such as Strabo mentions hardly accordwith a woman in her thirties, but Bourriot claims that this expression may be usedof fair-haired people typical of northern Europe. It is not certain that the Cimbriwere a Celtic tribe, but this is a minor point. We are left with the problem of whythe crater was deposited in the grave if it belonged to a temple: possibly a changeof leadership might be the reason for this, or the death or incapacity of a famousseeress. The skull of the woman in the grave showed signs of a blow, althoughthis is not thought to have caused her death.The Vix tumulus is a good example of the problems and possibilities presentedby a rich burial of the pre-Christian period. It is one of a series of wagon burialsdated before 475 BC, the majority of which were in eastern Gaul; and all but oneof the fifteen examples given by Joffroy were under tumuli. No others, however,were in as good condition as that at Vix, and many had been robbed. Where thesex could be determined, most of the dead were males, but there was at least oneother woman. The body was usually placed in the wagon after the wheels hadbeen removed, and when the vehicles survive, they seem to be of a type meantfor processions or ceremonies rather than utilitarian use. The Vix burial standsout because of the size of the crater and what appear to be ritual vesselsaccompanying it. It seems unlikely that the wagons were chosen to symbolize ajourney of the dead, particularly since the wheels were removed; they may havebeen included because they were used at the funeral, or as a status or cult symbol.The removal of the wheels can hardly be explained here by a desire to ‘kill’ thevehicle that had brought the dead to the grave, since they were carefully placedupright in the grave and no damage was done to the wagon. Bourriot’s ingenioustheory to account for the crater, it may be noted, was suggested by a passage fromliterature, and clues are needed from literature or art to help us to understandthe significance of such archaeological finds. Since the early Celts left no literature"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"HELP FROM ARCHAEOLOGY17behind, we have to rely largely on conjecture, and one theory may succeedanother in the case of elaborate graves like that of Vix. Those that are wellpreserved and virtually intact are certain to provide surprises, and may give theimpression that they are the result of exceptional circumstances. Consequentlythey alter our perspective and make us aware of fresh possibilities in the attitudeof past communities towards their dead.THE SHIP-BURIAL AT SUTTON HOOAnother illustration of the surprise element comes from Germanic territory,about a thousand years after the Vix burial, at the time when the pre-Christianreligion was being abandoned in Anglo-Saxon England. Just before war brokeout in the summer of 1939, a rich intact grave was discovered in Suffolk onheathland near Woodbridge. The treasures from this grave can now be seen inthe British Museum, and the detailed report of the find was published by Bruce-Mitford (1975–83). There has been constant discussion and argument eversince the discovery as to the workmanship of the objects in the ship, their placeof origin and their possible significance. They were found in what had been awooden burial chamber, set up on the deck of a large sea-going ship, about 28m in length; this had been dragged up from the river Deben on to the heath andlowered like a huge coffin into the place prepared for it, after which a moundwas built above. The ship contained many grave-goods of outstandingworkmanship and symbolic importance, but after fifty years of lively discussionwe still do not know whether there was a body in the grave or not.The grave was apparently prepared for a man, since it held weapons, shield,helmet and mailcoat, and these of such superb quality that the owner waspresumed to be a warrior leader and probably an East Anglian king. All theaccoutrements were of impressive workmanship, resplendent with gold andinlaid ornament, so that they suggest weapons and armour intended forceremonial use rather than for battle. There was also a purse with an elaboratejewelled cover holding Merovingian gold coins, and a stone whetstone with aset of carved faces and a bronze stag at the top, thought to be a sceptre such as aking might hold on his lap on state occasions. There were rich jewelledshoulderclasps to fasten a cloak, and a huge gold buckle with intricate interlacingpatterns, unsurpassed by any previously found in Germanic graves. Indeed, manyof the objects are without parallel as examples of intricate work in cloisonné,niello, garnets and glass, delicate cell-work and ingenious fastening devices.There were small belt-fittings, strap-ends and scabbard mounts of similar highquality, as well as a number of puzzling fragments like a set of delicate goldfittings that may have come from a slender wand of bone or ivory. A small lyreand a set of playing-pieces with a board were among the personal possessionsarranged round the place where the body might be expected to lie.It is possible that the body itself had simply disappeared in the acid soil. Thefirst assumption, however, was that the grave was a cenotaph, and that the dead"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE18man’s body may have been lost in battle, as could have happened to at least oneEast Anglian king of the seventh century, if he drowned in a river with many ofhis warriors (Bede, Ecclesiastical History III, 24). A less convincing suggestionwas that the dead received Christian burial, while the royal treasure was carefullyplaced in the mound because of associations with the old religion, in the transitionperiod between the old faith and the new. Another theory was that the body wasoriginally in a wooden coffin inside the burial chamber (Evison 1979), butconvincing arguments against this have been put forward by East (1984). It hasalso been claimed that the body was cremated, since burnt remains were notedin a great silver dish in the centre of the chamber (Vierck 1979). Other moundsat Sutton Hoo were found to have held cremated remains, those in Mound 2,for instance, being placed on a wooden tray, while there are some examples inrich Anglo-Saxon graves of ashes of the dead being buried with unburnt grave-goods. As to whose the grave might be, the suggestion made by H.M.Chadwick(1940) at the outset has proved on the whole the most acceptable; he claimedthat it was the grave of Redwald of East Anglia, who died about 625. This seemedimpossible when the coins in the purse were dated by numismatists to the secondhalf of the seventh century, but a revised dating, although not fully accepted, was625–30. Redwald was a powerful and successful king, said to be the leadingAnglo-Saxon ruler of his time, and although he accepted Christianity, Bede (II,15) tells us that he slipped back into paganism, setting up an altar to the devilalongside that of Christ, and that his queen and some of his counsellors wereopposed to the Christian church. Such a background might account for a ship-burial, perhaps with cremation of the body according to family tradition, eventhough some of the objects buried in the graves, such as a set of silver bowls withequal-armed crosses, are in the Christian tradition.We have to bear these problems in mind in considering what may be learnedfrom Sutton Hoo of the pre-Christian religion in East Anglia. First, the chosenrite was ship-burial, and this on an ambitious scale. The provision of a ship thatcould hold 40 oarsmen indicates that this symbol was felt to be sufficientlyimportant to justify the expense and effort involved. Traces of anothershipburial, although of a smaller vessel, were found at Snape, 9 miles away, in1862; unfortunately, this grave had been robbed, but one elaborate gold ringand fragments of a blue glass vessel indicate that this also was a rich burial(BruceMitford 1955). In excavations in the same cemetery in 1988, a burialin what appears to be a log-boat was found, indicating that the ship was afamiliar funeral symbol in this part of East Anglia (Filmer-Sankey 1992). Thebody, unfortunately poorly preserved, may have been that of a child, and theonly surviving grave-goods were a knife, a buckle and stud, and a pair ofdrinking horns placed at the foot of the grave (Filmer-Sankey 1990). In 1991a further find was made of a burial in a boat 3 m in length; this contained abody, not well preserved, with a sword, three spears, a shield, a knife and aspindle whorl. A horse’s head with bridle and bit was found in a pit near thegrave (Filmer-Sankey forthcoming). Mound 2 at Sutton Hoo also contained a"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"HELP FROM ARCHAEOLOGY19ship-burial of an unusual type, with the boat laid across the top of the burialchamber; a parallel to this is known from Hedeby in Denmark.Clearly, then, the main ship-grave at Sutton Hoo cannot be regarded as anisolated instance. The problems it presents serve as a good illustration of thelimitations of archaeology as a means of interpreting burial customs. The use ofboats or boat-like coffins for the dead, as well as the making of ship outlines instones round graves or sacred places, is known in Scandinavia from early times.Ship-burial came into general use about the sixth century AD, and continuedthroughout the Viking Age, while ships and boats were also used in cremationfunerals, and there are additional instances of ship-graves in regions of Vikingsettlement such as the Isle of Man and Russia. Altogether hundreds of shipgravesare known, although they only represent a small fraction of the number of VikingAge graves recorded (Müller-Wille 1968–9:87). Vessels were provided for bothmen and women, and varied from simple boats or parts of boats to themagnificent ships found at Gokstad and Oseberg in southern Norway. TheOseberg ship was about 21 m in length and had held the bodies of two women,with a richly carved processional wagon and many other splendid objects ofcarved wood which were preserved along with the ship itself in the blue clay ofthe burial place. Ships and boats or parts of boats may be buried under moundsor in flat graves, or burnt as part of a funeral pyre, where they are recognizablefrom the large number of metal rivets found among the ashes. There may be aseries of ship-graves in one cemetery, as at Vendel and Valsgärde in Sweden,varying in date so as to suggest that members of the same family had been buriedin this way over several generations. In one site at Kaupang in south Norway anumber of men and women had been buried in boats in graves crowded togetheron a small headland, giving the impression that this particular spot was sacred.Often the prow of a buried ship points towards the sea or a river, and thereis equipment that suggests preparation for a voyage. In the graves at Vendel,of sixth-century date onwards, the dead were placed sitting upright in theirvessels, as if they were intended to steer them into the Otherworld. The Osebergship, on the contrary, was weighed down by stones, as if it were essential tokeep it fast in the grave. When only parts of ships were used, or the outline ofa ship made over a grave in stones, it would seem that the symbol of a vesselwas in itself of importance. The use of this funeral symbol may have beenrestricted to certain families, since in many cases there are no more than oneor two ship-burials in a cemetery (Müller-Wille 1968–9:75). The practice is notlimited to rich graves, and so can hardly be explained as the provision of astatus symbol, nor does it seem simply to symbolize the journey to anotherworld, athough such associations may well have increased the popularity ofship-funeral. One possibility is that the funeral ship was used by those whoworshipped the Vanir, the powers of fertility, associated with seas and lakes andalso with places of burial under the earth, since the ship is known to have beenamong their symbols. If the lady in the Oseberg ship with her attendant was apriestess of the Vanir cult, the ship and the wagon found with her might have"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE20been used on her progress from one community to another to bring blessingand fertility, as suggested by some accounts in the literature (p. 133).These are possibilities, but the ship may well have had different meanings forthe various families who found it appropriate as part of the funeral setting. It hasalways been used as a fitting symbol for departure, and from a purely practicalpoint of view made a convenient framework for a funeral pyre, while it was alsoone of the most precious possessions of a Viking leader renowned for his exploitson the sea. The fact that a number of ships have been found in Anglo-Saxongraves in the period before the Viking Age introduces problems of the relationshipbetween the royal dynasty of East Anglia and the Scandinavian kingdoms andso brings in new complications to the vexed question of ship-funeral.A further source of possible evidence concerning religious beliefs is thecollection of objects in the burial chamber of the ship in Mound 1 at Sutton Hoo.There were personal possessions of great beauty and value and possible symbolsof royal power (Davidson 1992b:30), but also others that seem to represent lifein a king’s hall. There were a number of bowls, cups, dishes and drinkinghorns,including two huge aurochs horns set with silver, such as could be passed roundthe hall at a feast. The lyre found in the chamber might be one used by the kinghimself, or by the king’s poet who sang his praises, while playing-pieces mightalso symbolize the king’s power and the skill and luck which brought him victory,since they are often included in lists of royal or even divine treasures (Davidson1988:164). There are striking parallels between these grave-goods and those intwo other outstanding graves from the early Anglo-Saxon period, the moundsat Taplow and Broomfield, unfortunately never properly excavated and recorded(East and Webster, forthcoming). Symbols of feasting are found in manyGermanic graves, sometimes on a lavish scale and sometimes on a homely one,and it is possible to regard this as religious symbolism, since the sacrificial feastin honour of the gods was of major importance for both Celts and Germans as alink between the human and divine worlds (p. 89). At Sutton Hoo there wereprovided not only the means of serving food and drink but also vessels for itspreparation, including three large cauldrons, one with a chain of elaborateworkmanship for suspension over a fire, three buckets and a tub. The largestcauldron, made from a single sheet of bronze, would have held about 100 litres,and may have come from the same workshop as one in the Taplow grave.Another point worth noting is the decoration of various objects. An analysisof significant motifs in the Sutton Hoo treasure was made by Hauck (1954), andhe emphasized those associated with the cult of the Anglo-Saxon Woden, suchas dancing warriors and battle scenes on the plates on the helmet, the eagle anddragon on the great shield, and even knots and chains, because of Woden’s powerto bind warriors and render them helpless. Other symbols might be linked withother cults; the boars on the shoulder-clasps are a motif widely associated withthe fertility deities, while the mysterious faces on the stone sceptre might representroyal or divine ancestors (Enright 1983). The stag on the top of the sceptre aswell as the trout in the centre of one of the hanging bowls are symbols of"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"HELP FROM ARCHAEOLOGY21Otherworld powers in Irish literature. Such decorations are unlikely to bemeaningless exercises in attractive ornamentation; there is no doubt thatprotective, threatening or lucky motifs were deliberately chosen for ceremonialtreasures of this kind, associated with traditional lore and divine power.If we ask why such a brilliant assortment of beautiful and valuable objects wasleft in the earth, we can give no clear answer. Some of them might be felt unsuitablefor use once the old religion was abandoned, but there are also pieces with Christiandecoration included in the treasure. Other rich graves of this period show that theGermanic peoples were accustomed to sacrifice much wealth at the death of a king,but the sheer richness of this grave is another of the surprises that an archaeologicalfind can produce, contradicting our previous assumptions and theories. We haveto seek to discover, if we can, the attitude to kings and to the supernatural worldthat rendered this natural and desirable (p. 135).A further problem is the relationship between the various mounds in the cemetery,now thought to be a small one, used for a relatively brief period and restricted towealthy and privileged members of society, probably from the reigning dynasty.Seven mounds in all were investigated, and there are twenty marked on the plan. Wedo not even know for certain if the mound that held the treasure was the latest ofthe series, as it presumably would be were it the grave of Redwald. The problem iscomplicated further by a series of humbler burials, about thirty in all; twelve of thesewere in the neighbourhood of Mound 5, and roughly contemporary with it, whilethere was a further group of eighteen similar burials on the eastern periphery of thecemetery (Carver and Copp 1990b:9). These additional graves were carefully dug,but contained virtually no gravegoods, and a number of the occupants had met witha violent end. Some had wrists and ankles bound, while others had been beheaded;one was in a peculiar position, as if running or leaping, and seemed to be holding aprimitive plough (Figure 3). The bodies were unfortunately not well preserved, andhave only been recorded through a new technique that reveals the outline left in theFigure 3 ‘Ploughman’ figure from Sutton Hoo cemetery (after Carver)."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE22grave (Carver and Royle 1988:20; Carver and Copp 1990a:7). It now seems possiblethat the graves associated with Mound 5, some of which had traces of animal remainsin the vicinity, might be sacrificial burials; evidence of this kind is difficult to interpret,however, since such victims of violence might be the result of a massacre or ofexecution in later times, buried in an abandoned pre-Christian cemetery (Davidson1992a). There are clearly some animal remains at Sutton Hoo, but no sign of the linesof animals, mainly horses and dogs, found in the great Scandinavian ship-graves.Further excavation will throw more light on these problems, but no doubtwill also create new ones as our knowledge increases. We are most fortunateto have the opportunity to gain detailed information about so important a siteas Sutton Hoo, recently excavated and re-examined with great thoroughnessaccording to a systematic plan in a way that should add greatly to ourunderstanding of the pre-Christian religion in East Anglia (Carver 1992).THE HALL AT YEAVERINGA site of a different kind which also belongs to the period of transition beforethe establishment of the Christian church in Anglo-Saxon England is that ofYeavering in Northumberland (Figure 4). This was excavated by Hope-Taylor,and is the subject of a detailed report (Hope-Taylor 1977). Above the road andthe river Derwent, in which the first Christians were baptized, is a high roundedhill known as Yeavering Bell. This had served the Celtic people of the area as aplace of assembly and perhaps a holy place. The enclosure there was not adefensive earthwork; it could have been used for holding cattle or for a market,but there was also a tumulus and a stone circle with cremation burials scatteredin and around it, as well as a cemetery which had been ploughed over, probablyin Roman times. When the Anglo-Saxons gained control of Bernicia, this areaseems to have been established as a royal centre, visited by the king from timeto time. There were two halls, one of which may have been used as a temple,or at least as a place where people gathered for sacrificial feasts which formedan essential part of the old religion. There were traces also of a curious structurelike a wooden amphitheatre, thought to mark the place of assembly, and theseimpressive additions are probably due to Edwin, who became king ofNorthumbria about 625. His dramatic rise to the kingship and his relationshipwith Redwald of East Anglia are told in some detail by Bede in his EcclesiasticalHistory (II, 12 ff.). He was baptized by Paulinus in 927.The building known as D2 on the excavation plan, the supposed temple, had ahuge post outside at the northern corner, while there were three posts inside at thesouth end. Inside the east door was a huge pile of ox-bones and a heap of oxskulls.The hall was rectangular in plan, with inner walls of wattle and daub strengthenedoutside by timber; beside it stood a second smaller building which could have servedas the place where the food was cooked.

The hall measured 11 ×5.5 m and would haveheld a considerable number of people. Later the post-holes inside had been filledup with stones and the building apparently abandoned. A Christian church witha new cemetery was finally added to the site.This is the only case up to now of a building containing some evidence forceremonial religious feasts, with the possible exception of Hofstaðir in Iceland(O.Olsen 1966:182 ff.). Bede (Ecclesiastical History 1, 30) records a letter fromPope Gregory, advocating that such places be retained and used for Christianfeasts at appropriate festivals; Christians, he suggested, should continue to putup temporary shelters outside while the festival was in progress, presumablybecause many people came in from the surrounding countryside, and in factsome flimsy hut-structures were found outside the hall at Yeavering.

Various animalremains apart from the ox-bones may have had cult significance. The name ofEdwin’s town was Gefrin, meaning ‘Hill of Goats’, and a goat’s skull was foundin what may have been a dedicatory burial of a man with a staff, althoughwhether he was a Saxon or a Celt is not known (Hope-Taylor 1977:245–6),while in one grave there was a body in one half of the area and a single ox-toothin the other (102). The site at Yeavering is an example of how archaeologicaldiscovery can fill gaps when we have some knowledge of the historic past, andshows also how fruitful systematic excavation of a site may prove even thoughno treasure or even elaborate buildings are discovered there.THE STRETTWEG WAGONClearly it is possible to learn something of a lost religion from the evidence fromburials and sites used for ceremonial purposes. A further source of evidencecomes from single objects that appear to have ritual significance, some left inthe earth as offerings or hidden there to save them from pillage or desecration,and others included in graves, found on cult sites or abandoned in bogs. Anexample from a very early period comes from a cremation grave of about theseventh century BC, found along with a number of metal vessels at Strettwegin Austria (Megaw 1970:59). Unfortunately, as in many similar cases, the findwas made (in 1851) in the period before effective archaeological techniques hadbeen developed. The so-called wagon is a bronze platform on wheels, 240 mm(nearly 14 inches) in length, with a number of standing figures on it, arrangedin a systematic group. In the centre, towering over the others, is a female figurewith earrings, wearing a belt; she carries a shallow bowl on her head, supportedby a small protective pad, such as women still use in countries where they areaccustomed to carry burdens in this way. This figure resembles in style a Greekwarrior in bronze from Olympia, and Sandars (1968:215) suggested that it hadbeen made by a Greek craftsman working to native orders or by someonetrained in a Greek workshop. Before and behind this female figure there is apair of mounted warriors, facing away from her, and between the pair ofhorsemen stand a woman and an ithyphallic man brandishing an axe. At thefront of each group is a fine antlered stag, with a youthful figure on either sideof it, with a hand on one of its horns. All except the central figure are naked.There are many possible explanations of this impressive little group, butwithout comparative material from the period or literary analogies we are leftgroping in the dark. It might be a representation of some ceremony in honour ofthe stag, or of the central figure, which certainly suggests a goddess, depicted aslarger than human. It has been suggested that the stags are mythical creaturesassociated with the sun, which has been related to these animals in early medievaltimes. The Huns, for instance, retained a legend of the stag with a sun on itsforehead, while there are later Christian legends of St Hubert and St Eustacemeeting a stag bearing the cross on its horns, which might be a development of"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"HELP FROM ARCHAEOLOGY25the same tradition. The fact that the model was placed beside ashes of the deadmight indicate that it had some link for the mourners with the afterlife, possiblyindicating a welcome by the goddess. But in our present lack of knowledge ofreligious practices at this early time, we can only note it as an example of possiblemythological imagery associated with wild creatures of the forest world.THE GUNDESTRUP CAULDRONPerhaps the most celebrated find of a ceremonial vessel is the bowl or cauldronfound in 1891 by a man cutting peat in an area of bogland in Vesthimmerlandin North Jutland. It had been beaten out of a single sheet of silver, and decoratedwith a series of plates inside and out. A round medallion was fitted in the centre,and there were five inner and seven outer panels, on which traces of gildingremained and which were all richly ornamented, soldered on to it (Figure 5aand b). Before the bowl was deposited, however, these plates had been torn offwith considerable force and placed inside it. Although a careful search wasmade, certain parts such as portions of the rim were never found; it is possiblethat some of the lost pieces had been of gold. It is generally assumed that thebowl was left as a votive sacrifice, like other famous finds of the early Iron Agein Denmark, although Taylor (1992:66) suggests that the recorded evidenceof the discovery indicates that it had been left on dry ground in rough grass,presumably with the intention of recovering it.The outside plates consist of busts of four male and three female figures, whopresumably represent deities (see Figure 5a). The seven plates (a-g, using lettersintroduced by Klindt-Jensen in 1950) do not completely cover the cauldron,and some have thought that an eighth is missing. Their order is uncertain, butthat of the inner plates is agreed to have been B, A, C, E, D (moving clockwise).The supposed deities had eyes set with red or blue glass, and they areaccompanied by various small figures and attributes. The inner plates are morevaried in subject and treatment (see Figure 5b). Plate A shows a male figureseated cross-legged, with antlers rising from his head, accompanied by a stagand a boar, with more fantastic animals round the outside. This is probablythe best-known scene from Celtic art, appearing in countless publications. PlateB has the figure of a goddess, closely resembling one of those on the outsideplates (Plate e); below her are two small wheels, which might represent achariot or wagon, and she is accompanied by two elephants, depicted likehorses with trunks, two griffins and what seems to be a lion. Plate C also has acentral deity, in this case a male, who closely resembles one of the small outsidebusts accompanying the goddess on plate e. Beside him is a large figure in ahorned helmet, either kneeling or leaping, holding part of a wheel, while thereare also griffins, lions and a serpent. Plate D shows three animals thought tobe bulls, accompanied by three men with swords who seem about to slay them.Plate E, another famous scene, shows one large upright figure and two lines ofsmaller warriors, those at the top on horseback and those below on foot,"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE26accompanied by three men playing the Celtic wartrumpet known as the carnyx,which ends in a boar’s head. The dominating figure is holding up a small man,and either plunging him into a kind of tub or lifting him out of it, and he has aleaping dog at his side. The medallion at the base has a scene in a different style,showing a huge majestic bull apparently sinking to the ground while it isattacked by a man with dogs. One dog appears to have been killed, but theattacker seems about to deliver the final blow.When a replica of the cauldron was shown in London in 1970 as part of anexhibition of Early Celtic Art, it greatly impressed those who only knew it fromillustrations by its size and splendour. It is 69 cm in diameter and 42 cm high,and is clearly a treasure-house of myth and religious symbolism. There has beenlong and complex argument as to where and at what date it was made, and wecan only guess at its purpose and at the reasons for the choice of deities and ritualscenes, which are now thought to have been the work of as many as five differentcraftsmen (Larsen 1987). Megaw (1970:131) said of the cauldron: ‘Probably noother surviving relic of prehistoric European craftsmanship—with the exceptionof Stonehenge—has occasioned so much publication and dispute.’ At first manybelieved it had been made in Denmark, but later there were claims that it had"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"HELP FROM ARCHAEOLOGY27come from Gaul or from the Danubian provinces near the Black Sea, as well asmore remote areas such as Persia or India. Indian influence has again beenrecently stressed by Taylor (1992), who believes the cauldron to have been madein Thrace. Suggested dating has varied from the fourth century BC to the sixthcentury AD. The most popular dating however is the first century BC, which wasoriginally suggested by Sophus Muller in 1891.A detailed study by Olmsted published in 1979, based on styles of art,craftsmanship and iconography, has come out firmly in support of this dating,and he would suggest the period 80–50 BC and claim north-western Gaul as theplace of origin. Such an object could have been taken across the Rhine from somereligious centre in Gaul, perhaps as loot allowed as part-payment to Germancavalry employed by Julius Caesar on his campaigns, and in this way could havereached Denmark. Part of the difficulty in reaching conclusions about thecauldron is the variety of styles in the plates, and the use of animal motifs familiarFigure 5 The Gundestrup Cauldron, (a) Outlines of outer plates and (b) outlines ofinner plates. Klindt-Jensen’s lettering is followed in both cases but rearranged (afterPowell)."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE28in the Mediterranean, Near East and Scythian regions of Europe. It has even beensuggested that additional plates from some casket or shrine have been fitted onto the bowl at some stage (Megaw 1970:131). The treatment of the great bullon the base has been recognized as oriental rather than Celtic (Powell 1971:203),and it is now claimed that it was originally a horse’s bridle decoration, solderedover a hole in the cauldron (Larsen 1987). The griffins and lions and elephantsmust also be due to non-Celtic influences. However, there are also a number offeatures unquestionably Celtic in character, such as the carnyx, the torcs wornby the deities, the serpent with ram’s horns, and the more realistic animals suchas stag and boar. Olmsted has produced a number of parallels from Gaul to thevarious motifs and styles of art used on the cauldron.The purpose of the cauldron must have been a ritual one. It is hardly suitablefor holding liquids, whether wine, ale, blood or water, because of the elaborateinternal decoration (Sandars 1968:253). It seems probable that it belonged tosome shrine, and the busts on the outside and on some of the inner plates indicatethat it was made in honour of certain deities. In these representations on theoutside of the cauldron we have no action, only existence in a timeless settingwith men and animals alike in the grasp of divine powers (Sandars 1968:256).One male deity holds a man in each hand, while each man in turn holds a boar;another grasps two stags, and a third two sea-creatures. Below this last there isa fantastic animal with a head at either end, and the most plausible explanationof this is that it represents one of the metal ‘fire-dogs’ used to hold logs, found inCeltic areas (Powell 1971:202); this is confirmed by the tiny seated figures byeach head holding cups as if drinking at the hearth. The three goddesses areshown with varying arm-gestures. One raises hers as if in welcome, and has twosmall male busts, one on either side; she seems almost identical with the goddesswith wheels on plate B. The second (g) has crossed arms, and on one side of heris a youth struggling with a lion (the popular Heracles motif) and on the other awild dancing figure. The third (f) holds a bird in one hand, while her other isacross her breast, where there is a human figure apparently falling and an animalon its back: these might be helpless victims of her power or intended to be underher protection. She has two women attendants, one plaiting her hair and the otherupright on her shoulder.Various attempts have been made to identify these deities, none of themwholly convincing. The study by Olmsted is the most ambitious one, givingstrong arguments for an origin in north-western Gaul and going on to claimclose links between the religion of the Celts in the early Iron Age in Gaul andIreland, and to argue that a study of deities in Irish medieval sources shouldtherefore lead to a better understanding of those on the cauldron. The bull isclearly of importance, because of the two bull-slaying scenes, and Olmsted hasendeavoured to link the plates with episodes and characters in the Old Irishepic, the Táìn Bo Cúailnge, in which the hero Setanta, better known by hisnickname of Cú Chulainn, plays a major part in the struggle over the possessionof a marvellous bull, the Donn Cúailnge, which Medb, Queen of Connacht,"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"HELP FROM ARCHAEOLOGY29was determined to obtain from Ulster whatever the cost. According to oneversion outside the main manuscripts, the bull was finally killed by warriors(Olmsted 1979:205), and Olmsted suggests that this killing, and also theconflict between this bull and the other famous bull, the Finnbennach, explainscenes on the cauldron. Two small bulls confronting one another on Plate Acould be a representation of the fight, while various creatures on the same platecould represent the animal shapes taken by the two swineherds who finallybecame bulls in the Irish epic (Olmsted 1979:144 ff.). He also links the tallfigure by the wheel on plate C with the hero Cú Chulainn fighting Medb’s loverFergus with a broken chariot (Olmsted 1979:154). He follows an earlierscholar, Jubainville, in suggesting that Cú Chulainn was originally the god Esus,well known in Gaul, who appears with a bull on certain monuments.It is generally accepted that Medb herself, with her long record of royalhusbands and lovers, her fury in battle, and her links with territorial possession,is based on memories of an earlier goddess (p. 109). Olmsted associates her withthe bust on plate B representing a goddess in a chariot, pointing out that in theTáin Medb’s chariot is driven clockwise round the army to bring good fortune.The serpent on the same plate he links with the Morrígan, who took the shapeof an eel to hamper Cú Chulainn in battle. The plate with the marching and ridingwarriors can, of course, be fitted into any tale of battle, and the figure holding aman over a vessel Olmsted identifies with the god Teutates, to whom men wereand Esus as two linked gods in Celtic tradition, and the cross-legged god withsacrificed by drowning, taking Teutates as another name for Esus. He sees Lugantlers as Mercury/Lug, father of Cú Chulainn in the Irish epic.Thus by many references to passages from the Táin and other early Irish texts,as well as to various figures of deities on monuments in Gaul, Olmsted hasclaimed to elucidate the various plates on the cauldron, arguing that they havebeen carefully put together to illustrate a major mythological theme, of whichwe possess a late version in the Táin. Here we have an attempt to make sense ofa series of mythological pictures by selecting various details and finding parallelsin a literary framework of a much later date. Surviving manuscripts of the Táinare all later than the eleventh century, although the material is known to be a gooddeal earlier than this. We can see here both the rich possibilities and the problemsof iconographical interpretation with the aid of later literary sources from theChristian period. So much clearly depends on selection if the whole is to be madeto fit together. In this case one weak point is the doubt as to whether the figureon plate C really holds a broken wheel, with which he is attacking the bearded‘god’. Others have seen it as the symbol of a turning wheel, and it seems to beheld in the hand of the central figure. There is no really valid reason for identifyingthe goddess on plate B with Medb; even if she is meant to be riding in a chariotor wagon, this symbol of the travelling goddess is so widespread in both Celticand Germanic tradition that it might lead to quite different interpretations (p.198). The two male figures at her side (e) might be worshippers, or could fit intovarious symbolic patterns beside that of her husband and lover, Ailill and Fergus,"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE30as suggested by Olmsted. There is nothing about the similar goddess on plate gto strengthen the interpretation, and the idea that the Heracles figure with thelion and the dancing man represent Cú Chulainn being trained in warfare duringhis visit to Scáthach is unconvincing. The insistence that the tall man in thewarrior scene must be putting a man into a tub and could not possibly be liftinghim out of it seems unreasonable, nor does the object in the picture reallyresemble the Maryborough bucket and so appear to be a funeral vessel. Thesolution given in this last case is simply one of a series of guesses such as havebeen put forward over the years to explain this tantalizing ritual scene. Again, ifthe main legend depends on the fight between two bulls and the slaying of thesurvivor, why are there three animals on plate D? Bull sacrifice is known to haveplayed an important part in early Celtic religion, and there are many otherpossible reasons for the presence of the bulls outside the plot of the Táin.However, anyone who battles with the vexed question of the interpretation ofscenes on the cauldron will have to take the arguments used and the evidencepresented by Olmsted into consideration. Attempts of this kind are essential if anyprogress is to be made, and certain parts of the mythological framework may bevalid even if weaknesses are found in details of the argument. The horned deitywho sits cross-legged, with a torc round his neck and another in his hand, whilehis other hand grasps a serpent, is clearly a figure of major importance. He isevidently closely linked with the stag beside him, whose antlers match his own, andwith the boar on the other side, and these two seem unquestionably to be of nativeCeltic origin in contrast to more fantastic animals elsewhere on the cauldron.Olmsted is unwilling to accept this horned deity as a god called Cernunnos, andseems justified in this. The basis of such claims is one incomplete inscription on apiece of an altar found at Notre Dame in Paris, which reads.ERNUNNO; it showsa deity with short horns, not antlers as on the cauldron. The interpretationCernunnos (‘Horned One’) is not accepted by all (Le Roux 1953), and might be atitle. Horns as a sign of power are a very widespread symbol, and it cannot beassumed that all horned figures represent one particular deity. Both the torc, symbolof prosperity, and the serpent can be found in Gaul as attributes of Mercury, andMercury is the Roman equivalent of the god Lug, known to be important in Gaul(p. 46). The serene and enigmatic appearance of this figure certainly conveys animpression of divine power, while the link with the animals of the wild, the stagand the boar, is in keeping with Celtic imagery of the divine world. The possibilityof eastern influences in this panel, however, has been strongly stressed by Taylor(1992), who accounts for them by the assumption that the cauldron was the workof silversmiths working in Thrace.Faced with such a rich series of what appear to be divine figures, male andfemale, together with ritual scenes, we realize the wealth of religious imageryfrom the past to which we possess no satisfactory key. When examined at anypoint in detail, the evidence is found to be rich and promising, but we arespeedily led away from the simple outlines of a past religion as depicted inpopular mythologies, and are left groping for the way. This is especially the case"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"HELP FROM ARCHAEOLOGY31when we are dealing, as here, with a ceremonial object found in isolation, byaccident, connected with no recognizable site, and hard to date, and when thepictorial art, as in this case, shows obvious signs of foreign influences. In spiteof the enormous amount of published literature on the cauldron and itsacknowledged importance, we still have little understanding of its use inreligious ritual, or why it came to be finally abandoned in a Danish peat-bog;but we are left with a conviction of rich mythological symbolism, and with theimpression of a series of deities once of great importance in Celtic religion.THE MEMORIAL STONES OF GOTLANDMany centuries after the probable date of the Gundestrup Cauldron we haveanother rich field of pictorial imagery in monuments raised to honour the deadon the little island of Gotland in the Baltic, an important place on the route toeastern Europe from Sweden in the Viking Age. The Gotlanders became richbecause of the many travellers and merchants and fighting bands who made astop on the island when leaving or returning to Scandinavia, and many of theirown folk must have left on Viking expeditions never to return. There is a wholearmy of stones raised to commemorate the Gotland dead, some enormousmemorials about 10m high, others smaller but elaborately decorated. Theymust have been a striking sight when new, for traces of colouring have beenfound on them and details of the pictures may have been filled in in brightshades, where now only the silhouettes are left to us. The biggest stones withmany panels of pictures must have originally resembled great paintings or richinlaid metalwork (Lindqvist 1941:23). Some stones are still standing in thecountryside, while many have been found beneath the floors of medievalchurches, and are in the museum at Visby.They continued to be put up throughout the Viking Age until about theeleventh century, the majority before the coming of Christianity, although a fewlate ones bear Christian symbols. Thus they offer a unique opportunity to learnsomething of ideas about the Otherworld and the fate of the dead, and it ispossible to compare the imagery used on the stones with that of some of theearliest poetry that survives in Iceland. The first stones were put up in theMigration Period, and were probably inspired by memorial stones of theRoman Empire in southern Europe. A number have a great whirling disc ascentre-piece, accompanied by two smaller discs which may be imitated fromsymbols of the sun and moon on Roman tombstones, together with variationssuch as spirals and rosettes and small figures of men and fantastic animals(Figure 6). It seems possible that such stones reflected ideas about the cosmos,since on one stone there is the outline of a central tree, corresponding to theimage of the world in mythological poetry (Davidson 1975:175 ff.). At thebeginning of the Viking Age, about the eighth century, elaborate pictures ofships were introduced, usually in the lowest panel of the stones, and otherpanels were added showing scenes of action. The ships are of considerable"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Figure 6 Stone from Bro, Gotland (after Lindqvist)."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"HELP FROM ARCHAEOLOGY33interest in view of the increasing popularity of ship-funeral at this period inScandinavia, but as with the ships in the graves, we cannot be sure whether theyrepresent a voyage to the Otherworld or whether the man to whom the stonewas raised as a memorial was lost at sea and perhaps owned his own ship. Bothfactors may have made the ship symbol a popular one. The other picture mostfrequently found on stones of the Viking Age is that of a rider on a horsewelcomed by a woman who offers him a drinking-horn (Davidson 1976:300ff.). There are as many as twelve examples of this in Lindqvist’s recorded listof stones (1941) and other possible cases where stones have been damaged; thewoman with the horn has also been found elsewhere, for instance on a stonedating from the Viking Age at Sockburn-on-Tees in Yorkshire (Lang 1972) andalso as an amulet in a grave at Birka in Sweden, while her companion, the ridingman, was found as an amulet in another grave (Davidson 1967:201, nos 62,63). The welcoming scene is usually depicted on the top panel of the stone(Figure 7), and is clearly of importance; sometimes it appears above the ship,and sometimes a number of other panels are added, some depicting scenes fromheroic tradition, particularly those concerned with various heroes of Odin.From western Scandinavia we find a similar motif in early poems, two ofwhich, Eiríksmál and Hákonarmál, were composed in the tenth century bycourt poets in honour of two Norwegian kings, Eirik Bloodaxe and Hakon theGood. In these the dead king is described as entering the hall of Odin after hislast battle, to join the heroes feasting with the god; when he arrives at Valhalla,he is welcomed by valkyries, one of whom greets each newcomer with a hornof ale, and is then taken in to meet Odin. In view of this tradition, borne outby poetic imagery in other sources, certain details in the welcoming scene onthe stones become significant. There is what appears to be a stylized hall, whichbears some resemblance to a burial mound; a flying figure with a spear mightbe identified as a valkyrie above the battlefield, while a dog that appears besidethe warrior could be the dog mentioned in mythological poems as guarding theroad to the land of the dead. Here where we have some literary evidence todraw upon, the various motifs on the stones fit together to make some sense,and we may be more confident in our interpretation.There is no doubt that the idea of a hero welcomed by a woman with a hornwas a familiar symbol in the pre-Christian Viking Age, although we cannot becertain whether the rider depicted on the stones is a dead warrior or possiblyOdin himself. Two stones show him on a horse with eight legs, indicating thatthis is Sleipnir, the eight-legged horse of Odin which could bear him betweenthe worlds. I have suggested that the basis of the eight-legged steed is the bier,carried by four men to the grave (Davidson 1964:142), and Odin’s steed mayalso be deliberately used here as a symbol of the journey of the dead hero tothe Otherworld. The evidence of the Gotland stones shows how usefuliconography can be when we have a number of examples of the same motif,and at the same time some knowledge of the date and historical background,so that it is profitable to compare the imagery with that used in literature; but"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE34we are left wondering how far the image of the dead man riding to Valhalla isto be viewed as a poetic one only, like the final crossing of Jordan in Negrospirituals. Was it an image used by poets and stone-carvers alike because itappealed to the imagination at that particular time, and was a means ofexpressing praise and appreciation of a king or leader, or are we to assume thatat some period it was a generally held religious belief? To such questionsarchaeological evidence alone is unlikely to give us an answer.Figure 7 Stone from Alskog, Gotland (after Nylen)."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"HELP FROM ARCHAEOLOGY35THE CONTRIBUTION OF ARCHAEOLOGYArchaeology offers one clear advantage in a quest for a lost religion: it can takeus back beyond the limits of written sources. In the case of the religions ofnorthern Europe, most of our literary evidence comes well after the acceptanceof Christianity, and sometimes centuries have passed since the old faith wasabandoned. Graves and holy places and iconographical material, on the otherhand, take us directly back into the time when the religion of the gods still hadmeaning. Archaeology may also help to establish reliable dating for a customor expression of belief, especially when objects such as coins, weapons, potteryor brooches are included in the find, since these can be fitted into an existingseries of types already dated from previous work. In addition, there are nowscientific methods of checking dating, such as carbon-dating, pollen analysisand dendrochronology, which have become increasingly reliable in recentyears. Third, archaeology may provide us at any time with a new find thatmakes us revise previous assumptions when we are faced with exciting, thoughperhaps disturbing, fresh material. New methods of examining archaeologicalevidence, like the reconstruction of decayed bodies in some of the minor gravesat Sutton Hoo (p. 22), may add considerably to our knowledge. Earlierarchaeologists concentrated on artistic treasures or interesting artefacts thatmight be obtained from a site, but this has now given place to a wider curiosityconcerning methods of workmanship, ways of disposing of the dead, andinformation about living conditions of the time. The practical problemspresented by burial or cult places and the religious practices of the past aregradually being outlined in surer strokes.On the other hand, we cannot expect the evidence of archaeology to leadus to an understanding of the thought-processes of those who performed theritual or disposed of the dead with complex rites. There is much in ceremonialthat leaves no trace for the most careful archaeologist to find, and we may welljump to precipitate conclusions concerning human sacrifice or barbaric ritesfrom incomplete evidence. Oversimplification is always a danger, as is also thelinking of widely separated pieces of evidence because of the desire to fit theminto a favourite theory. There is also the danger of taking short-cuts in the desireto identify some mysterious figure in wood or stone with a particular god orhero with whom we happen to be familiar. Two rudely carved but impressivefigures from a cult place on the moor at Braak in Schleswig, for instance, onemale and one female, were hailed on their discovery as early Celtic or Germanicdeities, or the founders of the race in German tradition. More recent tests bypollen analysis have dated them to the Viking Age, and it is possible that theywere set up by Slavs in that area (Jankuhn 1957:50). While post-holes on a cultsite can give us some idea of the size of the posts for which they were intended,they can tell us nothing of the purpose or appearance of the posts once set inthem. The amount that can be conjectured and confidently published on thestrength of a few postholes is illustrated by the many models presented as"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE36reconstructions of the pre-Christian temple at Uppsala (p. 87). Moreover, thebewildering variety of funeral customs in the pre-Christian period that becomesapparent when we have a considerable amount of archaeological evidence fromone area makes it very difficult to draw any firm conclusions as to beliefs aboutthe dead. A good illustration of this is the evidence from cemeteries and isolatedgraves in Roman Britain (Hutton 1991:234 ff.).Certainly archaeology can bring us closer with startling vividness toreligious images from the pre-Christian past; we may look directly into a facethat once represented a deity that men and women worshipped, or see howobjects in a burial chamber were left after the last rites were performed. Noprose description can have quite the same impact, and vivid, eye-witnessaccounts that are also objective are extremely rare. We are able also to see thesplendid treasures that once graced a shrine or a grave when these can berestored to reveal their dignity and power, even though they are separated forever from their ritual setting, and the words spoken over them lost to us. Oneof the most valuable contributions of archaeology to our knowledge of pastreligions is its power to confirm or throw new light on accounts of beliefs andcustoms in the written sources whose reliability has been doubted. Whendifferent sources of evidence are brought together, we may come closer to anunderstanding of ritual and imagery. There is little hope now of finding newliterary material, but a major archaeological discovery may happen at any time.We have the example of what happened in 1982 on a ‘rescue excavation’ atFlag Fen in Peterborough, when the remains of a great wooden platform werediscovered, with wooden buildings on it, much of the wood from the BronzeAge preserved in the waterlogged soil. This may prove to have been a greatsacred centre, although it is as yet too early to say, and will certainly addconsiderably to our knowledge of the period (Pryor 1990).

Many names of divine beings from the old religionwere remembered in Christian times in both Scandinavian and Irish sources,but it is difficult to establish how many of these names are ancient ones unlesswe find them in early inscriptions or recognize them in place-names. We maybe helped by iconographical sources, such as the memorial stones of Gotlanddiscussed in the last chapter, which provide evidence for the cult of Odin in theViking Age in eastern Scandinavia, and support imagery from skaldic poetryconcerned with the deaths of kings and heroes. Odin himself, however, remainsan elusive figure, as he proved himself to be in tales of his visits to the mortalworld, and even if his eight-legged horse appears on the stones, we cannot besure that the rider is Odin himself (p. 33). The same is true of various ridingwarriors from the Migration Period, depicted in stone or metalwork, whichhave been identified with the god (Kuhn 1938) (Figure 8). The rider shown onone of the helmets from a grave at Vendel in Sweden, dating from the periodbefore the Viking Age, with an eagle and raven flying above him, and a spearin his hand, seems likely to be a representation of Odin (Davidson 1965:24)(Figure 9), but even here the position is complicated by possible influences frompictures of warrior saints from southern Europe.

They are knownas ‘bracteates’, from the Latin name aureae bracteae given to them in Denmarkin the seventeenth century. About 300 examples are recorded, the majorityabout the size of an old penny, although some are larger and have been set inelaborate frames. The fact that so many survive testifies to the value set onthem, and they seem to have been used as amulets. They have been found ingraves of both men and women, though more frequently in women’s graves,and also in hoards of gold or silver, while isolated examples have beenFigure 8 Metal ornament showing horseman with spear, Bräunlingen, Kr.Donaueschingen.

These last may have been deliberately buried to makethe soil fertile, while the presence of one or two in a hoard might be due to thebelief that they gave protection to buried wealth. They were presumably wornround the neck to give luck and protection to their owners.There are four main types of bracteate; Group A has developed frommedallions showing the head of an Emperor (Figure 10); Group B shows one,two or three standing figures, and is based on the Roman motif of Victorycrowning a hero (Figure 11); while Group C originates from the figure of anEmperor on horseback (Figure 12). There is also a type D decorated with abstractanimal ornament in the Germanic style, not dependent on classical models.

More recently, Hauck has produced amajor study of bracteates in 1970 and a Corpus in four volumes, listing all knownexamples, in 1985. He gives enlarged photographs and drawings which enable thedetails to be studied, and has sought to link the figures and symbols on them withthe cults of the Germanic gods. His work makes clear the complex art and vigourof these strange little ornaments, far removed in spirit from Roman or Byzantinemodels. A number have runic inscriptions, unfortunately not easy to decipher,which appear to be magical formulae to enhance the power of the bracteates.Hauck takes the symbol of breath issuing from the mouth of the single head onthe A bracteates as a symbol of creative power coming from a god, while the birdwhich is often found with the head, presumably copied from the Roman eagle, heassociates with Wodan’s raven. The ending of the Emperor’s helmet or diadem ina bird’s head is taken as a further indication of the character of the god and hisability to take on bird-shape, while he also links the horse on the bracteates withthe Germanic cult of Wodan (Hauck 1970:396 ff.). Some of the B group ofbracteates he interprets as representing the slaying of Balder, and those showing afigure with his hand between the jaws of a wolf-like creature (Figure 13) as an earlyillustration of Tyr’s binding of the wolf resulting in the loss of his hand (p. 74). Onesmall group of bracteates shows a female figure holding what appear to be weavingimplements (Figure 14), who may represent a Germanic goddess (Enright 1990),and this is an important piece of evidence in view of later literary descriptions ofsupernatural female beings (p. 115). All these are possibilities worth noting, butwe do not yet seem able to identify any of the figures on the bracteates consistentlywith later deities worshipped in Scandinavia. As Enright (1990:154) states in hisdiscussion of the weaving figure, recent work on the bracteates can add to ourunderstanding of early religion, but ‘they demand a highly specialized and intenseFigure 12 Bracteate from Holmsland, Ringkøbing, Denmark, type C (after Hauck)."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"GLIMPSES OF THE GODS41type of scrutiny before their often enigmatic messages can be deciphered andunderstood’.A similar use of what might be seen as symbols of power, perhaps associatedwith the luck of one particular family, can be found on Germanic and Anglo-Saxonbrooches with elaborate designs in relief, and also in scenes and figures used in thedecoration of helmets, scabbards, sword pommels and shields. In one series ofAnglo-Saxon brooches, parallels to which are found in Germany, Vierck identifieda face with staring eyes, sometimes shown with a triangle below the mouthenclosing the disjointed parts of an animal figure (Figure 15), as representing thecreative god of the Germans (Vierck 1967).

Again, however, native tradition mayinfluence the original design, as in the addition of a tiny dancing man on the SuttonHoo plate, who is guiding the spear of the warrior (Davidson 1965). On Swedishand Alamannic helmet plates of the same period warriors are shown together withbears and wolves, and are sometimes depicted in dancing attitudes (Figure 17);these have been claimed as representations of the god Wodan, closely associatedwith warriors and the dead (Paulsen 1967:142). Such representations may bringus nearer to an understanding of the cult of the warrior god, but we still cannot besure whether he was instantly recognizable to his worshippers in such pictures, orwhether some of the figures may represent dedicated warriors who followed thegod rather than the deity himself.There are some tiny pictures in metal of another type which might be seenas amulets, which have not been imitated from sophisticated southern models.They consist of minute pieces of gold foil, not much bigger than a finger-nail,which are found in sets in the foundations of certain buildings. As many as 19were laid in the post-holes that once held the supports of a possible pre-Christian temple under the medieval church of Mære in Trondheim (Lidén1969), while 26 were discovered at Helgö in Sweden, in what appears to havebeen a sacred centre, probably used for feasts (Holmqvist 1975). The usualscene depicted on them is of a man and woman facing one another, sometimesembracing and sometimes separated by a leafy branch, and the generallyaccepted explanation is that they represent the Vanir fertility deities, who couldbring blessing to the land, to flocks and herds and to human families (Figure18). It is perhaps significant that the pieces from Helgö show great variety inthe treatment and dress of the tiny figures, only two being identical, whichsuggests that they may have been deposited there on different occasions.M.Olsen (1909) long ago interpreted the poem Skírnismál, in which the fertilitygod Freyr woos the fair maid Gerd, daughter of a giant in the underworld, asFigure 15 Anglo-Saxon brooch from Warwick (after Vierck)."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"GLIMPSES OF THE GODS43Figure 16 Design on helmet plate (reconstructed) from the Sutton Hoo helmet (afterEvans).Figure 17 Metal plate from Alamannic grave showing dancing warrior (afterPaulsen)."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE44a myth of the divine marriage, in which the coming-together of these divinepowers connected with the sky and the earth meant new life in spring and aseason of plenty, and many have taken this as the significance of the tiny goldenfigures.

Clearly recognizable representations of individualgods and goddesses cannot, it seems, be found on amulets.Nor have early coins hitherto proved helpful in this direction. Images on Celticcoins, such as those of Apollo, were presumably copied from the Romans, whilethe majority of Scandinavian coins were made for Christian kings, and designsagain tended to be copied from southern neighbours. Hutton, however, selectsone coin of the early first century AD as seeming to show the face of a Celtic deity(Hutton 1991:164). It came from Petersfield in Hampshire and is now in theNational Museum of Wales, and shows a male head with antlers and a wheelset on what seems to be a crown. Once more, however, identification is difficult.We need to turn to other types of iconographical evidence where more detailsare given and names may also be provided.STONES FROM THE ROMAN PROVINCESThere is one rich field for the identification of divine figures of which, as yet, fulluse has not been made. The Roman occupation of England, France, Germanyand the Netherlands resulted in an enormous number of inscribed stonesdedicated to various gods and goddesses, including statues, altars and votiveplaques. Some have an inscription only, while others have pictures of the deities,according to Roman fashion, in anthropomorphic form. Any museum in aRoman town or military centre is likely to include a number of such stones, somepresented in conventional Roman style, some clumsy copies of such works, andothers powerful and barbaric, with little attempt at naturalistic treatment. Suchstones may be dedicated to deities from distant parts of the Roman world, suchas Astarte, commemorated on a stone at Corstopitum on the Roman Wall, whenthey were erected by men of various nationalities serving in the Roman army.Many others, however, represent local deities, and have been placed by farmersor landowners on their estates, or perhaps erected by small communities. Thosewho introduced them were evidently desirous to follow the new fashions in artand to honour their favourite deities in the Roman manner.Both Celtic and Germanic deities are usually identified with one of the mainRoman gods, such as Apollo, Jupiter or Mars, but their own titles may beincluded in the inscription. On such stones lost gods occasionally manifestthemselves, and we can learn something more of their characters from the titlesgiven to them. Unfortunately, it is not always obvious which native deities havebeen honoured in this way. The Roman gods could be defined with someprecision, and each was deemed to preside over certain aspects of life, but theCeltic and Germanic deities were far from being specialists, and the same Romangod is not always chosen to represent one of them. It seems that numerous localdeities might possess powers to heal, help in battle, rule the sky and the winds,and give the land fertility. Many Celtic names occur once only, and Sjoestedtpointed out that there were as many as 59 different ones associated with Mars,so that what is obviously one Roman deity could be used to represent a great"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE46many local gods (Sjoestedt 1982:27). There are, for instance, a number of stonesin Cumbria dedicated to Mars Belatucadros, meaning ‘Fair Shining One’, or ‘FairSlayer’ (Ross 1967:181). In this case pictures are lacking, although it is possiblethat this local god was represented by carvings of warrior figures withoutinscriptions found in the area (Hutton 1991:224). Another name of a deity foundin both Britain and Gaul is Maponus, meaning ‘son’ or ‘youth’, represented asApollo on an altar from Hexham (Richmond 1943). He may be remembered asMabon in the Welsh Mabinogion, a mighty hunter who pursued the great boarin the tale of Culhwch and Olwen, while his mother Modron seems to correspondto the Celtic Matrona, the divine Mother, who gave her name to the river Marnein France. Here, then, we may have traces of a mother and son linked withhunting and the countryside.There seems to be a clear link between the Roman Mercury and Lug, oneof the outstanding Celtic gods of the Roman period, who gave his name to oneof the four festivals of the Celtic year, Lugnasa on 1st August, and wasworshipped in every part of the Celtic world, Gaul and Britain, Spain andIreland (Tovar 1982). Apollo, like Mars, however, is linked with many differentnames and titles. One name found in conjunction with him is Belenus, probablyfrom bel (‘shining’), recalling another Celtic festival, Beltene. Another nameis Grannus, again thought to mean something like ‘shining’ or ‘burning’.However, neither of these gods appears in the literature, and we cannotconclude that they were simply sun gods, since inscriptions in which they occurindicate other characteristics beside those of warmth and brightness.Problems raised by almost forgotten Celtic divinities are well illustrated by theenigmatic figure of the horned deity on the Gundestrup Cauldron, often referredto as Cernunnos (p. 30). Opinions differ widely as to whether various other hornedfigures in Celtic art can be identified with one particular god. In some cases, knobson the heads of male divinities claimed as horns, for instance, have been explainedaway as rough representations of the winged hat of the Roman Mercury. Someearly horned figures associated with serpents have been linked with the figure onthe Gundestrup Cauldron, and attempts have been made to identify him with theLord of the Animals in early Irish literature; but the extent to which such a deitywas ever worshipped by Celtic tribes still remains an open question.There were fewer attempts to find classical counterparts for the Celtic goddesses,although Brigantia and Brigid are sometimes identified with the Roman goddessMinerva, who had powers of healing, encouraged crafts, and was associated withthermal waters (Ross 1967:360 ff.). The Celtic name of a goddess is often retainedin the inscriptions. Thus we have Rosmerta, often shown along with Mercury, whopresumably represents some local deity; he may carry a purse while she has a basketof fruit, indicating that they are bringers of fruitfulness and prosperity andconnected with the land. Rosmerta’s name has been interpreted as ‘Good Purveyor’(Green 1986:97), and she is sometimes depicted stirring a tub or bucket whichWebster (1986:61) finds hard to explain, but which surely might represent a churn(Figure 19). Another important goddess was Epona, mentioned in many"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"GLIMPSES OF THE GODS47inscriptions and represented on stones in Britain and on the continent, includingnearly 300 in Gaul alone. She is consistently associated with horses, and may beshown riding, usually side-saddle, accompanied by a mare or foal or by two ormore horses which she feeds with corn (Johns 1971:39). She is also associated withdogs, birds and healing springs, and is linked with the Mother Goddesses whobrought fertility and protection for their worshippers, and were concerned withthe well-being of the land, the care of animals, including domestic ones, and thedestinies of young children. Epona seems to have been called on by those interestedin horse-breeding and the use of horses on farms, while some classical writers referto her presiding over stables (Linduff 1979), and there are dedications to her putup by soldiers in Roman cavalry regiments. As Linduff points out, many auxiliariesfrom Gaul fought on horseback, providing their own horses, and kept up theirnative traditions and beliefs. It seems likely that Epona goes back into the Celticpast, since horses had long been of great importance to the Celts, but that in Romantimes she was adapted to a new way of life, and attracted a wider range ofworshippers. It has been suggested that she was linked with the goddess Macha inIrish tradition, and with the Welsh Rhiannon (Ross 1967:224 ff.), but if memoriesof her are preserved in later literature, it is under some name other than Epona.The German gods depicted in the Roman style are a little easier to identify.It is possible roughly to equate Jupiter with the Germanic thunder god Donar(later known as Thunor and Thor), and Mercury with the Germanic Wodan(OE Woden and ON Óðinn), while Mars was sometimes identified with thegod *Tîwaz (remembered as Tiw or Tig by the Anglo-Saxons and by theScandinavians as Týr). We cannot, however, assume that such identificationscan always be relied upon; the thunder god with his club, for instance, maysometimes be represented by Hercules. The Roman Mercury and the later Odinhave a number of traits in common. Both wore cloaks and wide-brimmed hats,although Odin was thought of usually as an old man and Mercury usuallyFigure 19 Rosmerta with her churn (?), from Corbridge, Northumberland (after Ross)."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE48(though not invariably) as a divine youth. Both were regarded as guides to theunderworld, helped their followers to gain treasure, and featured as cunningthieves, so that they both may be viewed as trickster figures. Titles such asMercurius Mercator and Negotiator in inscriptions recall one of Odin’s names,Farmatýr, ‘God of Cargoes’, a side of the god that tends to be forgotten becauseof the emphasis laid on him as god of battle. The association of Odin with thebattlefield and his great spear which caused strife among men may have beentaken over from Tîwaz, who had become a shadowy figure by the late VikingAge. The Germanic Wodan is thought by some to have been primarily a rulerof the land of the dead, whose cult came into Scandinavia comparatively late.Titles given on the stones often serve as helpful clues to the charactersof the deities. Two dedications at Housesteads on the Roman Wall refer toMars Thincsus, and these presumably refer to the god’s association withthe thing or ‘Assembly’ where law cases were held and new laws decided.Thor presided over the Althing in Iceland, but Tîwaz may have been theguardian of law at an earlier period. It must be recognized that theGermanic gods inevitably changed in character as tribes moved from onearea to another, and communities developed new needs and organizations.In Iceland, for instance, there was no royal dynasty to depend on Odin’sfavour for continued rule and no regular army was needed where youngmen could be trained in the lore of the warrior god. Thus traditionsconcerning Odin are largely based on those remembered from Norway orDenmark, and the strongest emphasis in Icelandic poetry is on Odin’spower to inspire poets.Germanic female deities fall into two main classes. First, there are the wargoddesses or battle spirits, like the Alaisiagae, mentioned together with Marson three stones at Housesteads, whose names—Bede, Finnilene, Baudihillie andFriagabi—are similar to some of those given to the valkyries in Norse literarytradition: the last two are interpreted as ‘Ruler of Battle’ and ‘Giver of Freedom’(Bosanquet 1922). This seems to indicate female spirits who helped todetermine the course of battle and saved warriors from the panic that led todefeat and death, and who were associated with the Germanic war god longbefore the Viking Age (Davidson 1988:69). A second group of female spiritsare those who come under the heading of the Mothers (Matres, Matronae), the‘Giving Ones’, who are also found in Celtic tradition. Names like Garmangabi,‘Giving’ or ‘Generous’ One, on a stone from Lanchester near Durham may becompared with later goddess names such as Gefion and Gefn, emphasizingtheir power to bring gifts. The cults of such goddesses must have brought inthe women of the community, but they certainly had their male worshippersalso, as in Roman Britain stones in their honour were in many cases set up bymen serving in the army (Barnard 1985). Some of the dedications are to‘foreign’ (ollotatae) or ‘overseas’ (tramarinae) Mothers as well as to local ones,perhaps because those making them wished for continued help and luck fromthe supernatural beings associated with districts where they had previously"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"GLIMPSES OF THE GODS49lived or served (Barnard 1985:243). This emphasizes the link between suchgoddesses and particular regions, and indicates general recognition that thoseof other peoples belonged to the same category as the familiar beings on homeground.Nehalennia appears to have been an important Germanic goddess of thistype, although we have no indications of the particular tribe to which sheoriginally belonged. She had two temples on the island of Walcheren at themouth of the Rhine, which were overwhelmed by the sea, but a large numberof altars and inscribed stones associated with her cult have been recovered fromthe sand. Many were set up by merchants and travellers in thankfulness for asafe crossing, and she is often shown beside the prow of a ship. She also appears,however, with baskets of fruit, horns of plenty, loaves (some very like theproducts of local bakeries in recent times) and with a small dog sitting besideher (Figure 20). Such attributes indicate that she was a fertility goddess, whomay also have possessed powers of healing and been associated with the realmof the dead (Hondius-Crone 1955; Stuart et al. 1971). Figure 20 Drawing of goddess Nehalennia by Cannegieter, as shown on an altarfrom her shrine at Domburg, The Netherlands (after Hondius-Crone)."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE50Much more might be done in further study of this large body of evidencefor cults and native traditions of the Roman period. One scholar who madeconsiderable use of it was de Vries (1957–8), but the tendency to keep Celticand Germanic studies apart, together with the fact that the carved stones haveremained largely within the province of the classicists, has halted progress,particularly on the Germanic side. The absence of any comprehensivehandbook of such stones was lamented by Buchholz (1975). Much of thematerial was collected in museums many years ago, but there has been a steadyincrease in finds from excavations or chance discoveries on Roman sites; oneexample among many is the discovery in 1957 of a number of carved stonesdeliberately broken and thrown into a well at Lower Slaughter inGloucestershire, thought to have been deposited there in the late fourth or fifthcentury by disapproving Christians (Toynbee 1976:89 ff.). Certainly, study ofthis type of evidence from any part of the Roman provinces soon makes clearthe complexity of local cults and worship of individual Celtic and Germanicdeities and prevents any simplistic approach.MYTHS AND MONUMENTSRepresentations of divine beings and scenes from pre-Christian myths havebeen found on crosses and grave stones of the early Christian period inScandinavia, northern England and the Isle of Man. It seems to have been thepractice to introduce Christian teaching by comparison with earlier myths, andone opportunity for doing this was on crosses and memorial stones in honourof the dead. A striking example is that of Thorwald’s Cross from Andreas inthe Isle of Man, dated to the eleventh century, which shows Odin beingdevoured by the wolf in the last great battle (Figure 21). The god can beidentified by the raven on his shoulder, by his spear, turned downwards as asign of defeat, and by a characteristic knot often associated with him, as onsome of the Gotland stones. The intention seems to be to contrast thedestruction of the pagan god at Ragnarok with the resurrection of Christ andhis victory over evil, as the Odin figure is placed below one of the arms of thecross. Other subjects associated with Ragnarok are found on the cross stillstanding in the churchyard at Gosforth in Cumbria. One panel appears to showthe bound Loki, with his wife beside him catching poison in a bowl as it dropsfrom snakes hanging above the hapless prisoner, exactly as described by Snorriin Gylfaginning 49, some centuries later. The resemblance here seems too closefor mere coincidence, and attempts to argue that the scene is based on someobscure Christian allegory are not convincing.It may be assumed that such mythological scenes were once carved earlier inwood to decorate the halls of rich men and to enrich the shrines of the gods, sincethere are allusions to such carvings in early Icelandic poems (p. 103). Severalpoems describe the exploit of the god Thor when he fished for the World Serpent:one early poem on this subject by Bragi is presented as a description of a carving"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"GLIMPSES OF THE GODS51in a hall, while another by Thjodolf of Hvin describes a picture on a shield. Thetale of Thor’s fishing is also told in direct narrative style in the Edda poemHymiskviða, and finally retold in prose by Snorri in the Prose Edda in thethirteenth century. Here then we have a well-substantiated pagan mythpreserved in early literature, clearly felt to be important.There are four surviving carvings of Thor’s fishing. In each case he is in aboat, and in three out of the four he has a companion with him, assumed to bethe giant who accompanied him in the Edda poem and cut the line in terrorwhen he saw the monster. The only stone showing Thor alone is from Altunain Sweden, dated to the early eleventh century, on which the ox-head that Thorwas said to use for bait and the struggling serpent are visible (Figure 22). Thereis no indication that this stone was a Christian monument. Another stone fromHørdum in Denmark is in bad condition and hard to date, but the fishing-lineand part of the serpent can be made out, while both here and on the AltunaStone Thor has his foot through the bottom of the boat, as in Snorri’s account.A third stone from Gosforth in Cumbria, dated to the tenth century, has beenbuilt into the inside wall of the church, but may originally have been a panelfrom a Christian cross (Figure 23). Thor is seen in the boat holding up hishammer, and the ox-head and several fish are visible, but not the serpent; thismight, however, have been shown on a lower panel. Earlier than any of thesestones is one from Ardre in Gotland, probably from the early eighth century,which has several little scenes on it: one has been interpreted as Thor obtainingthe ox, and another shows him with a companion in a boat.The literary sources and the carvings have been discussed in detail by P.M.Sørensen (1986), who claims that this particular myth must have continued in aFigure 21 Odin devoured by the wolf, Andreas Cross, Isle of Man (after Simpson)."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE52reasonably stable form for over 500 years. Snorri in his account seems to havekept faithfully to the version in the early poems. We do not know whether thehooking of the serpent originally formed part of the story of creation, fittinginto the familiar pattern of a god overcoming a monster so that order mightreplace chaos, or whether it was one of the happenings foreshadowingRagnarok, when Thor was finally slain by the serpent although he overcameit. Snorri refers to two different traditions: one was that Thor slew the serpentwhen he pulled it up from the depths, and the other that it fell back into thesea when the giant cut the line, so that the end of the world was postponed fora little longer. Thor’s struggle to lift the giant’s cat from the floor in another ofSnorri’s tales (p. 82) is evidently based on the latter version.Sørensen points out that both artists and early poets have emphasized theconfrontation between serpent and god, each staring into the eyes of the other.The giant, he thinks, may have been introduced into the myth in the Viking Age,symbolizing Thor’s journey from the cultivated farming world to which hebelonged to the wild country of the giants where monsters abounded. HeFigure 22 The serpent takes Thor’s bait, on stone from Altuna, Sweden."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"GLIMPSES OF THE GODS53reminds us how myths are likely to change over a long period of time, and alsohow limited pictorial material must be: ‘The picture is a primitive mediumcompared to the written word, and it is in reality not intelligible if we do notknow the story which it illustrates’ (1986:258). However, one great advantageof such evidence is that it may reveal the essential point of the myth, and alsogive a date at which a myth was known, perhaps much earlier than anysurviving written source.Some of the more elaborate of the Thor’s hammer amulets, popular in thetenth century and perhaps made in imitation of Christian crosses, could havebeen inspired by the contest between god and serpent (Figure 24). Two examplesfrom Östergötland and Scania show a bearded face with round staring eyesrepresenting the god, and a twisted shape which could represent the serpent(Davidson 1967:p1. 67). Once we are familiar with a myth, as here, it is possibleto recognize symbolism based on it. It has been suggested that the use of thefishing scene on a Christian monument might have been inspired by a learnedChristian allegory of God the Father fishing for the devil and using the crucifiedChrist as bait, but it is doubtful whether this was ever used in art at a date as earlyas the first Thor carvings. Nor does it seem likely that such an obscure motifFigure 23 Thor and the giant fishing, on stone in Gosforth church, Cumbria."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE54would be used on monuments intended for public edification. However, the workof Roe on early Christian crosses in Ireland has shown how somewhat fantasticscenes once taken as non-Christian can be shown to belong to a firm Biblicaltradition or to have been inspired by Christian legend (Roe 1945). Anotherexample is that of the impressive carved stone found at Repton in Derbyshire in1979, showing a rider on one side and on the other a serpentine creature with ahuman face, apparently devouring two men. The conclusion reached in a detailedstudy (Biddle and Kjolbye-Biddle 1985) is that this should be dated to the eighthcentury in Mercia, and that it forms part of an early Christian cross. To reach aconclusion in such cases is difficult unless we have a number of examples of aparticular motif for comparison, as in the case of Thor’s fishing. When the themehas also been treated in later literature, evidence of the carvings can clearly beof great value for the study of northern mythology.NAMING AFTER THE GODSIt is clearly difficult to identify divine beings shown in metalwork or stonecarvings unless these are accompanied by a helpful inscription. Certainattributes like the hammer of Thor may help to identify a god, or we may beable to recognize a scene from an account in literary sources, as in the pictureof the bound Loki on the Gosforth Cross. Fortunately, however, there are otherways of tracing the names of deities, and one is by a study of the landscape andof the names given to local features that go back to early times. Such nameshave to be traced back in early records, and it is important to realize that thestudy of place-names is a discipline in which short-cuts may prove misleading.Some names that seem to link up with the pre-Christian past may be due toantiquarian speculation, as O.Olsen (1966:92 ff.) pointed out in discussing theFigure 24 Thor’s hammer amulet in silver, from Kabbarg, Scania, Sweden (afterSimpson)."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"GLIMPSES OF THE GODS55use of the term hof in Scandinavian place-names. This word is often translated‘temple’ but seems sometimes to have been used for secular enclosures andbuildings. In Norway he found 22 farms where the name of a god had beenlinked with the syllable hof, and 85 simply called Hof, and thought it possiblethat in these cases a farm had been used as a place to hold feasts in honour ofthe gods. In Iceland about 100 farms with the name Hof were recorded in 1910,but of these only 5 were recorded in the early eighteenth century; so that manymay have been added in reports on local antiquities made by clergy a centuryor so later (O.Olsen 1966:172 ff.). A few of these may be genuine temple sites,the most probable being a farm in north-eastern Iceland called Hofstaðir, whichhas a different lay-out from the normal hall and traces of a field-kitchenoutside, so that it could have been used to prepare food for a large number ofpeople. But great caution is needed, since even if hof names can be traced backto medieval times, they may merely indicate chapels built by Christians, so thatthere is little reliable evidence on which to draw.Another name denoting some kind of holy place is ON horgr (OE hearg),which may originally have denoted a place of sacrifice out of doors, but waslater applied to buildings (Turville-Petre 1964:239–40). One English exampleof its use is Harrow, where there is an impressive hilltop site appropriate for aholy place. In Scandinavia such elements can be combined in place-names withthe name of a god, but not in England, so if they mark places there wheresanctuaries once stood, they were presumably for the worship of the gods ingeneral. In Denmark the word hylde is found in place-names, and is thoughtto mean a shrine of wood or possibly a wooden platform on which the godswere placed, as in Onsild, earlier ‘Othenshylle’ (Hald 1965:251). Another wordthought to be used for a holy place is OE weoh/wig (cf. ON vé, Danish wi,Swedish vi), but it is hard to trace this in later place-names—one possibleexample is Weyhill in Hampshire (Gelling 1973:110 ff.).There are, however, many names that seem to be associated with a particulargod or goddess. These may be linked with some noteworthy feature of thelandscape. A Celtic example from Kerry in Ireland is that of two rounded hillsresembling breasts, known as the Paps of Anu (Dá Chick nAnann). In theliterature Anu is called ‘Mother of the Gods’, and a ninth-century glossarycomments ‘Good is the food which she gave’ (Ó hÓgáin 1990:151); the namingof hills after her shows that traditionally she was identified with the earth itself,even if a particular example may not go back to a time when she wasworshipped as a deity. The god Lug (p. 46) plays some part in Irish literature,but the chief evidence for his cult in pre-Roman times comes from place-names.Lyon in France was formerly Lugudunum, derived from his name, and othertowns such as Laon, Loudon and Leiden were also called after him, as well asCarlisle in England, whose Roman name was Luguvallium. There are manyplaces called after him in Ireland, including hills, earthworks and lakes, one ofwhich is Lough Lugborta at Uisnech, where according to local legend he wasdrowned (MacNeill 1982:7). MacNeill has shown how the Irish festival of"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE56Lugnasa is associated with various customs and traditions, and these help tobuild up a picture of the god.In Anglo-Saxon England a considerable number of place-names have beenclaimed as proof of the worship of pre-Christian deities, some still in use fortowns and villages and others former names for fields or farms. However, Gelling(1973) has shown that a number previously accepted by Stenton, Ekwall andothers have proved unacceptable when earlier spellings were examined in greaterdetail. She accepts a few Woden names as evidence for the worship of the god,such as Woodnesborough in Kent, meaning Woden’s Hill or Tumulus, which isconfirmed by the survival of a large mound beside the church up to the end ofthe eighteenth century (Davidson and Webster 1967:7). The name Wodneslawenear Biggleswade, a site now lost, has a similar meaning. Names accepted byGelling as associated with Thunor, the Anglo-Saxon thunder god, are Thunderleyand Thundersley in Essex, names meaning Grove of Thunor, and perhaps usedof a holy place in a forest clearing or a sacred grove. The close link between thethunder god and the great oaks of the forest in Germanic territory was pointedout by H.M.Chadwick as long ago as 1900. It was formerly thought thatThurstable in Essex was a good example of a name derived from Thor, and thatthe last part, from stapol, a post or pillar, confirmed Thor’s association with thepillars of the hall in Norse tradition (Turville-Petre 1962). This is a warningexample of over-rash conclusions where place-names are concerned.Bronnenkant (1982–3) has now shown that it is far more probable that the nameThurstable’ was taken from that of a Danish settler, and that the pillar could havebeen some kind of boundary-mark without religious significance.Names based on Tiw or Tig are harder to find, but one good example isTysoe in Warwickshire, which is of interest because it is close to the Vale of theRed Horse, where the figure of a horse was formerly cut in the turf (Davidson1982:55), and might conceivably have had some connection with the earliergod. The fertility deities, and especially the goddess Frig (the Germanic Frîja)after whom Friday was named, must have been important to the Anglo-Saxons,but places named after them are rarely found, perhaps because such nameswould tend to be suppressed by missionaries at the time of the conversion.However, it is worth noting that the name frigedene in a recently discoveredcharter of AD 963 means ‘Valley of Frig’, and indicates that the modern Fridonin Derbyshire was named after her (Brooks et al. 1984:150–1). The puzzlingdistribution of pagan names may be because those that survive were outsidethe immediate area controlled by the local ruler and the first Christian priests,who would object to names of pagan significance (Gelling 1961:20). Absenceof place-names of this kind in certain areas of the country does not necessarilymean that the cults of the gods were unknown there.In Scandinavian countries there are place-names associated with the maingods, Odin, Thor and Tyr, together with Freyr and Njord, the fertility deities,and lesser-known gods who may have been of importance before the VikingAge, such as Ull. Once more, the distribution raises problems. Odin names are"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"GLIMPSES OF THE GODS57rare in some areas and totally lacking in Iceland. Various suggestions have beenmade to account for this, such as the arrival of his cult late into the north, orthe sinister nature of the god, leading to avoidance of his name. However, inDenmark some Odin names have survived, in particular three examples linkedwith vi, denoting a shrine or holy place, of which Odense is the outstandingexample. No other god’s name in Denmark is linked with vi, and Hald suggeststhat this marks Odin’s importance as the warrior god worshipped by kings andaristocrats in the last period before Christianity (Hald 1965:252). Two of thevi names are near Lejre, and may have been on the royal estate there. The lackof Odin names in Iceland, where there was no royal dynasty, is consistent withthis. One isolated example of an Odin name in northern England isOthenesberg (Hill of Odin), recorded in a document of 1119 for the hill nowknown as Roseberry Topping in the North Riding of Yorkshire. This conicalhill is a striking landmark; it is not a burial mound or artificial hill like someof those in England named after the Anglo-Saxon Woden, such asWodnesbeorg for a long barrow in Wiltshire. However, it is possible that thenaming after Odin in Yorkshire was the result of late legends about the godrather than of a cult place dedicated to him in preChristian times by earlyViking settlers. Both Woden and Odin apparently continued to be associatedwith high places and graves after the coming of Christianity.Another feature hard to explain is the presence of Ti names in Denmark,where his name is next in popularity to that of Thor, although it is rare inNorway or Sweden. In Denmark as in England many place-names have nowbeen rejected as evidence for the existence of pre-Christian cults (Hald 1969:50ff.). Undoubtedly the most popular god was Thor, to judge by the number ofplaces called after him throughout Scandinavia, while his name forms part ofmany personal names of both men and women. Nevertheless, the popularityof Thor may lead us astray. An English example of this is Thurstaston in theWirral, an area settled by Scandinavians in the Viking Age. Here a huge stoneon a stretch of heathland is locally known as Thor’s Stone, and children andreaders of popular guidebooks are likely to be told that Thurstaston was namedafter the god Thor and that human victims were formerly sacrificed on thestone, a theory apparently due to a confident pronouncement by Sir JamesPicton, the Liverpool antiquarian (N.Ellison 1955:78). However, the namecomes from Thorstein, presumably one of the Scandinavian settlers, and thelast syllable is from tun, indicating not a stone but the enclosure for a house.The stone itself is a piece of soft red sandstone left behind by quarrymen whenthey removed the harder stone round it.Examples of later folk-traditions influencing place-names can sometimes behelpful, however, and such names are often found in Ireland. In Munster, forinstance, there are tales from the end of the last century of a supernaturalwoman called Áine, said to inhabit a certain mound, a little hill called CnocÁine. On St John’s Eve, the midsummer festival celebrated by bonfires, bunchesof burning hay and straw were carried round it and then taken to the fields to"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE58bring a blessing to the cattle. It is said that one year a group of girls lingeredon the hill, until finally Áine herself appeared and politely asked them to leave,since ‘they wanted to have the hill to themselves’. To explain what she meant,she let them look through a ring, and they saw the hill crowded with a host offairy beings previously invisible (Fitzgerald 1879–80:189 ff.). In such tales wehave an echo of traditions linked with the land itself, inhabited by supernaturalbeings who could bring good fortune if treated with respect, even if, as in thiscase, the link with a particular hill or spring may not go back to pre-Christiantimes. Although the names of goddesses have left less imprint on place-namesthan those of male deities, we can find compensation for this in the largenumber of local legends in Scotland and Ireland, as well as Norway andSweden, associated with hills, preserving the memory of Otherworld femalebeings. If used with a full knowledge of their limitations, place-names may offeressential clues to the existence of pre-Christian cults.Another place to search for the names of past gods is in personal names recordedin written sources or inscriptions. We know little of the god Ull, occasionallymentioned in the literature, whose name is found in a few place-names in Norwayand Sweden in two forms, Ullr and Ullinn. The name (o)wlþuþewaR was inscribedin runes on a scabbard chape found at Thorsbjerg in Denmark, dated about AD300. This has been interpreted as Servant of Ull, which would indicate knowledgeof the god at an early date. Ull’s name is related to the Gothic word for glory,wulpus, and it has been thought that he was an early sky god. However, he is alsosaid in early Icelandic poetry to be the god of skis, which suggests links withnorthern Scandinavia, and there is little trace of his cult in Denmark. The name‘Servant of Ull’ is not in itself a definite proof that the man who bore it was aworshipper of the god, and indeed it is hard to be sure what naming after a godimplies. While there were some places named after Odin, he was rarelyremembered in personal names, unless some name like Hrafn (Raven) was usedas a substitute, because of the association of the raven with the god. The nameOthinkarl has indeed been found on four Danish runestones as well as in aNorwegian inscription and again in a Swedish document, and it has been suggestedthat the use of ‘karl’ here might signify ‘Odin’s man’. On the other hand, twobishops of the late tenth and early eleventh century bore this name, possibly becauseboth belonged to aristocratic families in which a link with Odin was an establishedtradition (Hald 1971:38), and if such a name denoted a dedicated follower of thegod, it seems unlikely that it would have been retained by Church dignitaries soonafter the conversion. Thor names also present problems. Out of about a thousandnames recorded in Landnámabók, of Icelandic settlers and their families, aboutone-quarter have Thor as an element, showing that such names were extremelypopular in the Viking Age. Thor names are not, however, found in earlier heroicsources, and are rare in Germanic territory on the continent, supporting the theorythat the cult of the god was mainly a northern one.New fashions in names do not, however, always come from new cults. Suchevidence as we have linking Thor names with the worship of the god comes from"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"GLIMPSES OF THE GODS59fairly late sources, such as Eyrbyggja Saga, where a youth called Grim is said tobe renamed Thorgrim and to become a priest of Thor, and Thorolf of Mosturwho set up a temple to Thor is said originally to have been named Hrolf. Oneexplanation suggested for the lack of early Thor names is that those with theprefix ás (from áss, god), such as Asmund and Aslak, might indicate the influenceof Thor, frequently called Ása-Thor in the literature. There is an example of aman called Asbjorn in Landnámabók (M, 8; H, 302:346) dedicating his land toThor and calling it Thorsmørk, but this is hardly sufficient to prove the theorycorrect. Only one name with such a prefix (Ansu-) is found in runic inscriptionsand no examples are known from early place-names, so Hald concludes thatThor names were a fairly late development in Scandinavia (1971:50). On theother hand, the name Thorir is found reasonably early, and it has been suggestedthat in its earlier form (Wihar) it might mean Priest of Thor. Clearly, it is difficultto establish anything about cults of the gods on place-names alone, but inconjunction with other evidence they may provide valuable information.DIVINE NAMES AND TITLESOne further way to discover the nature of the northern deities is to study thenames by which they were known. Unfortunately, there is often considerabledisagreement as to how a name should be interpreted. The important butelusive Celtic god Lug bears a name generally taken to mean ‘shining’ or‘brilliant’, and we are told in the literature that his face shone. Many earlierscholars assumed, therefore, that he was a sun god. However, another schoolof thought derived his name from the word for raven, since coins andmedallions of the Roman period showed the youthful genius of the city of Lyon,presumed to be Lug, accompanied by ravens. A Greek writer also stated thatlugus in the language of the Gauls meant raven, possibly because it resembledthe Greek word for ‘black’ (Ross 1967:249 ff.); again the evidence isinsufficient to be convincing. One of the stock epithets applied to Lug,lambdada (of the Long Arm), is ambiguous, possibly referring to his famousspear or to his wide powers as a ruler. The identification of Lug with Mercury(p. 79) hardly fits in with the conception of a sun god, although the bringingof light and warmth could have been one of Lug’s many functions. He was alsocalled the Many-Skilled, indicating diverse powers. Sometimes it seems as ifhe was regarded as a triad of deities, for there are references to his two brothersof the same name, and in inscriptions his name is sometimes in the plural form(Sjoestedt 1982:57). Thus, while his name contributes something to ourunderstanding of his character, it leaves many problems unsolved.Another of the main Irish gods, the Dagda, has a name meaning the GoodGod, a title rather than a personal name. It signifies a being of many powers onceagain, ‘generous in giving’ rather than ‘good’ in any moral sense; he was famedfor his hospitality in the tales, and other titles he bore were ‘Father of All’, and‘Mighty One of Great Knowledge’. In view of this, it is a little surprising to find"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE60him represented as an undignified, pot-bellied individual, armed with a primitiveclub and clad in a short tunic and hood like a worker on the land. However, hewas clearly a dynamic figure, with abundance of energy and a huge appetite. Thisformidable character who mates with giantesses seems, like the ScandinavianThor whom in some ways he resembles, to embody the disturbing power of theancient gods, still remembered in tales told in Christian times.The complications surrounding the names of divine beings are illustratedby those of Odin. In one poem of the Poetic Edda, Grímnismál, a list of 47names is given, and others may be found elsewhere to make a total of about170 (Falk 1924). Some of these names are comprehensible in the light ofsurviving tales and legends, such as ‘God of the Hanged’, since hanging wasthe traditional method by which victims, human and animal, were said to besacrificed to the god. Some of his names are related to his power on thebattlefield, such as ‘Father of Victory’ and ‘Raven God’, since slaughter in warprovided food for the ravens preying on corpses. Other names are in keepingwith his reputation as a wanderer through the world in disguise, such asVegtamr (Roadwise), or Grimnir (Masked One); Karl and Greybeard recall hisappearance as an old man in a cloak. The name Odin is derived from theadjective óðr, meaning ‘raging’ or ‘intoxicated’, and the German forms Wodan/Wutan come from *woþu, meaning ‘madness’ or ‘fury’. Adam of Bremen’scomment on the god’s name was id est furor. As in the case of Ull, the name ofthe god is found in two forms, Óðinn and Óðr.A god may be referred to by a title rather than a name, and a powerful deityis likely to have many titles, which may be used in inscriptions as well as literarysources, and are sometimes mistaken for names of separate deities. In Icelandicskaldic verse we find descriptive phrases for the deities in the form of kennings,which rely on a knowledge of myths. In his Prose Edda Snorri has much to sayabout the composition of skaldic verse, and when he describes gods or goddesseshe often turns to kennings used in such verses for his information. In a kenning,the name of a person, place or object is not given directly, but replaced by astatement of its relationship to some person or thing. A skaldic poet would notcall a spade a spade, but might refer to it as ‘sword of the soil’, or ‘ladle of earth’,or even ‘ladle of Thor’s mother’, whose name was Jord, ‘Earth’. Thus kenningsmight be as complex as modern crossword-puzzle clues. A king or leader couldbe alluded to as ‘hater of the fire-bed of the serpent’, as was Harald Hardradi ina poem by Thjodolf Arnorsson quoted in Heimskringla (Haralds SagaSigurðarsonar 5, verse 81). ‘The bed’ and ‘the fire of the serpent’ are two familiarkennings for gold, because gold shines like a fire, and serpent-dragons were saidto lie on golden treasure in burial mounds, while ‘the hater of gold’ means a leaderwho does not keep wealth for himself but shares it among his followers, so thatthe phrase could denote a generous leader. At their best, kennings can besurprising and creative, providing rich imagery to add depth to a poem; at theirworst, they are boring conceits and exercises in ingenuity. Their importance forthe study of Norse mythology is that they may throw light on lost or incomplete"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"GLIMPSES OF THE GODS61myths or mythical beings. The kenning quoted above is based on heroic legend;the famous serpent guarding treasure was Fafnir, slain by the hero Sigurd theVolsung to gain an enormous treasure. Thus without using a dull simile, andemploying very few words, the poet compares Harald in his youth to acourageous prince of the past by recalling this well-known story. There mightalso be a touch of humour here, since Harald was known to be greedy for goldand to show great skill in amassing it.Women described in kennings are usually represented as goddesses,valkyries or norns, and a study of such kennings is one way of learning moreabout such beings. In a tenth-century poem, Kormak, a pre-Christian poet,described the girl he loved as the Gunna of the sun of the sea (Turville-Petre1976:47–8). Gunna is a valkyrie name, from a word meaning ‘battle’, whichmay be used in personal names such as Thorgunna, although we are toldnothing about Gunna herself in mythological sources. ‘The sun of the sea’ isanother kenning for gold, which is also called ‘fire’, ‘gleam’ or ‘light of the sea’or ‘of rivers’. This might be based on a memory of lost treasure-ships, or of goldthrown into the water as an offering. The meaning of the kenning ‘goddess ofgold’ is a woman, since women wear gold as ornaments. Kormak often usessea-images in his love poetry, which is far from being artificial verse-makingand ranks among the best examples of skaldic poetry that have survived. In thisparticular poem he declares that the girl he loves is worth more than all theworld’s wealth, and while the image of evermoving light on the sea is used toexpress his own wanderings, she is said to be held in his constant heart, and ina further kenning is described as ‘tree of riches’.In this case we have the name of a goddess, presumably of a minor kind, andsuch kennings often record such names, and occasionally tell us something ofthe attributes of a goddess. Skadi, for instance, is said to have been the wife ofthe god Njord, one of the fertility deities associated with seas and lakes, whowas of some importance in the Viking Age. However, she was forced to partfrom him because she belonged to the mountains and he to the sea-shore, andthey could never dwell happily together. Skadi is called ‘divinity of skis’ in twoearly skaldic poems. Snorri says of her: ‘She goes about much on skis and witha bow and arrow and shoots wild creatures’ (Gylfaginning 22). The mysteriousgod Ull, thought to be important before the Viking Age, is also said to be a godof skis, and said to use a bow and to hunt. On the basis of this it has beensuggested that the two are a pair of deities connected with the north and withwinter, and some have gone further and claimed that Skadi was originally amale deity, as her name is a possible masculine form, or even tried to identifyher with Ull. She is one of the few goddesses, however, about whom we are tolda fair amount in the literature, and the reference to her holy places (véum okvongum) in Lokasenna 51 indicates that she was of some importance. It seemspossible that her cult flourished in Halogaland, since she shows characteristicsof the Saami, who were renowned for skiing, shooting with the bow andhunting; her separation from Njord might point to a split between her cult and"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE62that of the Vanir in this region, where Scandinavians and Saami were in closecontact (Davidson 1990). Her name, unfortunately, gives little help; it mightbe related to the noun skaði, meaning ‘harm’, or to Gothic skadus/OE sceadu,‘shadow’. In this case, the early kennings indicate certain characteristics of thisgoddess which might have gone unnoticed.The main Scandinavian deities are often described in kennings. Snorri inSkáldskaparmál 1 states that one god may be named in terms of another: ‘whenwe say the Tyr of victory or the Tyr of the hanged, or the Tyr of cargoes, theseare terms for Odin’. The connection of Odin with victory in battle and withhanged victims is well attested, but the name ‘God of Cargoes’ is moresurprising; however, Snorri in Ynglinga Saga 6 claims that Odin found treasurein the earth for his followers and brought them wealth, and this is anothercharacteristic shared with the Roman Mercury (p. 79). A point worth notingin Snorri’s statement quoted above is that Tyr could have his name used as anequivalent for ‘god’ in a kenning; this seems to indicate that he had some specialsignificance in early tradition, although by the late Viking Age he plays littlepart in the myths. Tyr’s name is also used for a warrior in kennings: in ahumorous poem said to be composed in Vinland in Eiríks Saga rau¢a 9, inwhich the poet refers to himself as a warrior, he uses the kenning: ‘the Tyr whodemands the hat of Bild’. Bild is one of Odin’s names, and his hat is a helmet,so the poet is a fighting man ready for conflict. If Tyr were in early timesassociated with battle and identified with Mars (p. 47) this might help toexplain the part he plays in kennings.Some kennings simply state the relationship of two or more deities, as whenThor is called ‘Son of Odin’. Since this link is found in early kennings, the ideaof Odin as his father cannot be a late invention by Snorri. Other kennings referto Jord (Earth) as Thor’s mother, indicating a link between sky god and earthgoddess. When Thor is called the father of Modi and Magni, whose namesmean ‘strength’ and ‘anger’, it seems that we simply have personified qualitiesof the god, and the same is true of his daughter Thrud (strength), while he isalso said to dwell at Thrudheim. Other Thor kennings, such as ‘Possessor ofMjollnir’, his famous hammer-axe, can be understood from the recordedmyths, as may also such kennings as ‘Defender of Asgard’ and ‘Defender ofMidgard’, since he protected the world of the gods and the inhabited earth, aswell as those that describe him as the slayer of various giants.The kennings certainly create problems, but it is essential to study them ifany serious attempt to understand the myths and the nature of the variousnorthern deities is to be made. Fortunately, systematic lists of kenningsaccording to subject have been made available by Meissner (1921), whichmakes it possible to trace those used of supernatural beings, and to discoverwhich were used by the early poets. Since many of the kennings come from thepre-Christian period, they can, like early works of art, give us a direct link withthe Scandinavian world-picture before the coming of Christianity.When we survey the different kinds of evidence that can extend our"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"GLIMPSES OF THE GODS63knowledge of the gods and their significance in daily life, it soon becomesapparent that we are losing our guide-lines and straying away from the neat,rational picture of deities that tends to be given in popular mythologies. Thisis generally based on the myths that have come down to us, but only aftersimplifying these and avoiding their obscurities and contradictions. It isessential to realize how tangled the web of beliefs and traditions concerningthe gods must in fact have been, and this has been apparent in attempts to cometo terms with the divine world pictured on the carved stones or rememberedin poetic imagery. Certainly without the background of the northern mythsthemselves it would be hard to fit the surviving evidence into any sort ofcoherent pattern, and it is to these therefore that we must now turn."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"643The Gods in the MythsThe Germans do not think it in keeping with the divine majesty to confine godswithin walls or to portray them in the likeness of any human countenance. Theirholy places are woods and groves, and they apply the names of deities to thathidden presence which is seen only by the eye of reverence.(Tacitus, Germania 9: trans. Mattingly)SOURCES OF THE MYTHSWhat Tacitus noted of the Germans of the first century AD has a convincing ring,and is borne out by the crude yet impressive wooden figures surviving from bothGermanic and Celtic territory. Such figures served as symbols for the divinepowers without any attempt to represent them as either handsome or monstrousbeings; they existed as vague symbols of those ‘hidden presences’. Animal or birdsymbols might also represent the power and presence of divinities. Althoughanthropomorphic figures of gods were known in the northern Bronze Age, it wasnot until the Romans were established in Gaul and Britain that the new fashionof depicting deities in the form of men and women gradually became popularamong the native population (p. 45). Stories of the gods, however, must have beentold from very early times, and as these developed the deities were likely to takeon more human shapes and characteristics, while retaining majestic or demonicpowers. Thus Thor is described as a huge red-bearded man with flaming eyesand a quick temper, and the Dagda is a robust, pot-bellied figure in shabby clothesbut of enormous virility and strength. Irish goddesses who give birth to divineoffspring in rivers are represented as daughters of Irish kings, while the divineFreyja is something between a lusty giantess and a fair maiden whose white armslight up the darkness of the underworld. They are not sentimentalized and donot become amiable figures, although they may be gift-bearers and bring greatbenefits to mankind; on the contrary, they remain ruthless, unpredictable andprone to take offence, so that it is dangerous to encounter them.This picture of the deities is not due to hostile Christian influence; it ischaracteristic of the earliest surviving material, although Christian writers maystress the less admirable features of the pagan gods, and represent them ascorrupt or stupid. Humour in tales of the deities seems to have existed from"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"THE GODS IN THE MYTHS65the beginning, and is found in mythological tales from many areas of the world.In northern Europe, this may take the form of broad comedy, as in the poemThrymskviða when Thor disguises himself as the fair Freyja and gets entry intothe hall of the giants arrayed as a goddess bride under a veil. He shocks eventhese barbarous characters by the gusto with which he demolishes a largeportion of the bridal feast, not contenting himself with the dainties preparedfor the women, but devouring also roast oxen and salmon in huge quantities,while he out-drinks the stoutest of the wedding guests. Yet this is more than acrude caricature of the powerful thunder-god, for skilful reminders of his divinepower and energy are given at every turn. So terrible are his fiery eyes seenthrough the bridal veil that the prospective bridegroom retreats the length ofthe hall in alarm when he attempts to steal a kiss, and once the god gets hishands on his hammer again—the object of the whole charade—he shatters theskulls of the giants round the table and leaves them dead. This is no comic Thorset up by an anti-pagan poet as a target for mockery, but the ancient thunder-god constantly threatened by the forces of chaos and using his great hammer-axe to defend gods and men from attack (p. 80).The sources of the Norse myths are varied, and attempts to interpretincomplete or confused texts often frustrating. There are references to lost talesand occasional snatches of somewhat obscure narratives about the gods in earlyIcelandic skaldic verse of the pre-Christian period, and poems of the PoeticEdda which deal with mythological subjects. Eddic poems are not alwaysnarrative poems, since a number consist of questions and answers exchangedbetween two supernatural beings; such compositions must have been popularin the Viking Age among those skilled in lore about the gods and their world.We have also tales of gods and goddesses in the prose literature, some clearlylate, others likely to be based on earlier sources. A number of the myths havebeen collected and retold in the Prose Edda of Snorri Sturluson, and in manycases they come from poems still extant, so that we can compare the twoversions, but there are others whose sources are lost. A few more stories areincluded in Ynglinga Saga, the first section of Snorri’s Heimskringla. There aresome further tales, mainly about Odin, in the early books of the Danish historyof Saxo Grammaticus, which he had heard or read in the late twelfth century,and some of these are not found elsewhere, while others are earlier thansurviving Icelandic versions of the same tales. Saxo, however, was asophisticated Christian writer, who had received a modern education at oneof the new universities, and cannot be wholly relied on to pass on an old talein the form in which he received it. Snorri, on the other hand, wanted to retellthe tales as they were found in early poetry, so that young poets couldunderstand allusions to the myths. He is not likely to invent or alter materialdeliberately, although he may yield to the temptation to make slightly bettersense of an obscure source. Each individual tale has its own problems andcomplex links with other sources; there may be signs of Christian or foreigninfluence, or links with myths outside Scandinavia. The tales need to be seen"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE66also as part of a larger cosmic background, often neglected in popularcollections of the myths. We have no detailed, consistent account of this setting,and it has to be reconstructed from hints and references found here and there.In early Irish literature the mythological material is more limited, butbecause of the wealth of stories recorded, there are many indications oftraditions concerning gods and goddesses and their divine world. In some ofthe heroic tales they are represented as human figures from royal families rulingthe separate kingdoms of Ireland in the early Middle Ages. The tales maycontain poems, some of which are lyrical descriptions of the Otherworld, whileothers are speeches, sometimes by supernatural beings. There is alsomythological material in local legends, and in the tales of journeys tosupernatural realms where time and the ordinary conditions of human life areno longer applicable. The tales were recorded in the monasteries, andsometimes attempts were made to fit them into a biblical framework so thatmuch of the original content is lost, and it may be hard to find any purposebehind some apparently pointless narrative. In a study of Christian influencein Irish sagas and other prose works of the early medieval period, McCone(1990) stresses the importance of the introduction of Christian tradition or thedeliberate use of allegory in many of the tales. His emphasis on the unlikelihoodof pre-Christian tradition surviving unchanged through centuries of Christianeducation is in general agreement with the present attitude towards theIcelandic sagas. Nevertheless, the survival of oral tradition in both cultures,together with a strong antiquarian interest in the past, makes it possible forsome memories to survive, even though deliberately edited from a Christianviewpoint. Clearly, each separate text must be treated with great caution.Traditions of early battles in which the gods take part have survived in aconfused form in Ireland; we have the accounts of the two battles of MagTuired, in which Lug and the Dagda and other possible gods appear (p. 72).There are also pre-Christian traditions in the collection of tales about Finn,leader of a band of hunters and warriors in the forest; these became popularfrom about the twelfth century onwards and contain material that differs fromthat of the heroic tales told at court. In addition, there are collections of twelfth-century material about local places and past events, known as the Dindsenchus,which have been described as ‘mythological geography’ (Sjoestedt 1982:12).They seek to explain various place-names, while the Lebor Gabala (Book ofInvasions) gives an account, half-way between antiquarian history and fantasy,of the various invasions of Ireland in the remote past. In the twelfth centuryvarious manuscript compilations were made in Wales, but this material is lessrewarding from the mythological standpoint than the collections made inIreland and Scandinavia at that period. Some mythological traditions can berecognized in the prose tales making up the Mabinogion, but these are no morethan fragments recast in skilfully wrought tales, and the Arthurian romancessimilarly can only give us fugitive glimpses of possible lost material.In any case, the myths seem to have developed separately in the various Celtic"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"THE GODS IN THE MYTHS67areas, so that painstaking attempts to fit them into a coherent religious patternby taking isolated items of evidence and tracing similarity in names are not veryrewarding. Further progress must depend on detailed and disciplined study ofindividual sources. It is proposed here to deal mainly with the main northernmyths that appear likely to go back into the pre-Christian past. A favouriteapproach to these myths is to review the evidence for the main deities, the datesand nature of the various sources, and any philological clues that seem relevant.It is important also, however, to consider the character of a deity in a widercontext, as we find it in the realms of early literature and art, and to assess theimportance of the cult for rulers, warriors, travellers and farmers, and in the lifeof the community. In many cases we are left with the names of supernaturalbeings for which no evidence of a cult exists, so that we have to consider theproblems of literary traditions about the deities on the one hand, and theirinfluence on the lives of men and women on the other. The myths underconsideration in this chapter come from literary tradition, but in many cases itis evident that visual imagery from early art has to be considered along with them.THE DIVINE WORLDMythical geography is found in the Scandinavian tradition, as in the Irish,although here it is not a case of listing localities associated with the Otherworld,but rather of attempts to map the Otherworld itself. The mythological poemsof the Edda of the question-and-answer type name many places out of thisworld where cosmic events have taken place or will take place at the end oftime, as well as obscure characters who may be minor gods or giants orsupernatural animals who have played some part in these events or will do soin the future. Thus it is asked where the last battle between gods and giants willbe fought (Vafprúðnismál 18) and the reply is that it will be on Vígríðr (Fieldof Battle), although in another poem (Fáfnismál 15) an island with a differentname is given. In Grímnismál names of the dwellings of various gods arementioned. Odin’s hall, Valhalla (Hall of the Slain), is well known because itplays so large a part in images of warfare and death, but the significance ofother halls, like Yewdale (Ydalar) where Ull is said to dwell, or Folkfield(Folkvangr) where Freyja allots seats to the dead, has been lost. The poems alsohave many allusions to rivers in the underworld, and in the lands of gods andgiants. For instance, one river called Fearful (Sliðr) is mentioned in Voluspá(36), flowing through poison dales near where Loki lies in his bonds, bearingweapons in its current, and such a river seems also to have been known to SaxoGrammaticus (Davidson 1980:35). In Snorri’s account in Gylfaginning ofHermod’s ride to Hel to reach the dead Balder, we have an impressive accountof a journey through vast spaces of gloom and darkness, which at one point islit up by a bridge with a thatched roof of bright gold which spans the river Gioll(Resounding), and is guarded by a maiden called Modgud, who directs him onhis way to the realm of the dead. Neither bridge, river nor maiden is mentioned"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE68elsewhere in early literature, although Gioll Bridge (Gjallarbrú) is rememberedin the Norwegian ballad Draumkvaede which deals with a vision of theOtherworld and the road to be taken by the dead (Liestøl 1946:36).Such a wealth of obscure names indicates that there was a whole body oflore connected with the worlds of gods and giants, and it is interesting tospeculate as to how it came to be built up. There is little evidence for anestablished priesthood of the gods in Scandinavia, but there are references towise men at the courts of kings who gave counsel, interpreted dreams, andforetold the future, and they may have contributed to the background of themyths. It is also possible that poets made an intellectual game of inventing suchnames. De Vries (1933:97) draws attention to a question near the end ofHymiskviða (38), the poem describing Thor’s fishing for the Serpent: ‘Who outof those who relate tales of the gods (goðmolugar) can tell it better?’ Hesuggests that this term, not found elsewhere, refers to a professional classresponsible for relating myths, and giving, so to speak, the approved version.A possible parallel to the Scandinavian examples may be found in the accountsof visits to fabulous lands in Irish literature, known as echtrai or immrama(Dumville 1976). The former may be roughly defined as accounts of journeysby human beings to a supernatural realm, either by a voyage across the sea orby entry into a fairy mound (Mac Mathuna 1985:255). The immram is a voyageto an island, largely ecclesiastical in inspiration, although parts may be derivedfrom secular literature, but it is not always possible to make a clear-cut distinctionbetween the two (McCone 1990:79). The immrama may be regarded as frame-tales, for once the framework of a visit to an island of marvels became popular,it was easy to find new ways to fill it. The original idea of a supernatural realm,from which Otherworld beings came to visit kings and heroes and sometimes totake them back with them, must be pre-Christian, but in many of the tales thathave come down to us there are signs of Christian imagery and learnedspeculation. The ingenuity of poets and story-tellers did not end with the comingof Christianity, and it is not always easy to distinguish between the old lore andthe new. The existence of this perplexing mass of details must not be forgotten;it is all too easy to select a few that seem to make sense and to ignore all the rest.Certain features concerning the world of the gods, however, seem reasonablywell established. One is the importance of its centre, represented in local sacredplaces by a tree or a pillar, a mound or a great stone. The central tree of the godshad more than one name, but in the poetry of the Edda it is most often given asYggdrasil, thought to mean Horse of Ygg, a name for Odin; if this is the correctinterpretation it may refer to Odin hanging on the tree, as described in Hávamál.In the Irish Dindsenchus there is mention of huge trees that in the past markedsacred places, and that were linked with the choice and fate of legendary kings(Watson 1981). In Asgard itself, Yggdrasil marked the place of assembly for thegods, where decisions were made affecting them and mankind. The fruit of thetree was linked with human births, and was also a source of healing. Yggdrasilwas said to grow and to be destroyed continually, as living creatures of the"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"THE GODS IN THE MYTHS69mythological world, hart, goat and squirrel, gnawed at it; this suggests that itsymbolized the ever-changing existence of a kingdom or tribe, or indeed ofhuman life on earth. Not only was it the centre of the kingdom of the gods, butalso of a series of worlds making up the cosmos. Nine worlds are mentioned morethan once, but never clearly specified. A possible list can be built up from one ofthe Edda poems, Alvíssmál, in which different terms for parts of the natural worldsuch as sun, wind, clouds and sea, are said to be used by different classes of beings.1 have suggested elsewhere (Davidson 1975:83) that the nine worlds might bethose of Asgard and Vanaheim for the two races of gods, Midgard for mankind,Jotunheim for the giants, Alfheim for the elves, the world of dwarves in the earth,Hel for the dead, and, in the last two cases, possibly the world of the heroes inValhalla and that of the most powerful gods who are named in the poem as theHoly or Mighty Ones. No doubt the identity of the nine varied from time to timeas the emphasis changed or new imagery was introduced.The representation of Yggdrasil as the centre of the nine worlds brings in afresh complication, that of the conception of a tree rising through a number ofworlds which is found in northern Eurasia and forms part of the shamanic loreshared by many peoples of this region. This seems to be a very ancient conception,perhaps based on the Pole Star, the centre of the heavens, and the image of thecentral tree in Scandinavia may have been influenced by it (Hultkranz 1990).Among Siberian shamans, a central tree may be used as a ladder to ascend theheavens (Eliade 1951:244 ff.). In Norse tradition, however, it is not clear whetherthe various worlds are one above the other or grouped round the tree. There areallusions to worlds under the roots of the tree, while the realm of the gods maybe pictured in the sky, with a rainbow bridge connecting it with other worlds.Those who have tried to produce a convincing diagram of the Scandinaviancosmos from what we are told in the sources have only added to the confusion.The conception of an eagle at the top of the tree and of the World Serpent curledround its roots echoes various cosmologies in Asia which may have influencedScandinavia from the north. On the other hand, we know that the Germanicpeoples in central Europe worshipped their gods in forest clearings, and that thesky god in particular was associated with the oak (H.M.Chadwick 1900), so thata central tree was a natural symbol for them also.A characteristic of the Otherworld tree in Irish tradition is that it bearsblossoms and fruit of gold and silver, making music when shaken and healingsickness and despair. It is usually pictured as an apple tree, although the greattrees of the past are sometimes described as bearing mixed fruit of apples, acornsand nuts. In a number of the tales describing journeys to the Otherworld,branches are brought by visitants to earth which bear gold or silver fruit, fromwhich some of the fabulous trees of the past were said to have grown (Watson1981). The land where such wonderful fruit trees grew was known as the Landof Youth or the Land of Promise, the Plain of Delight or other alluring names(Dumville 1976:79 ff.). It was a place of happiness and beauty where sicknessand decay were unknown, inhabited by lovely women who welcomed heroes"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE70from earth; it remained outside human time, so that what seemed a brief staythere might afterwards prove to have lasted for centuries.Traces of a bright Otherworld with golden trees are discernible in Norseliterature also; it is suggested, for instance, by some names for the dwellings ofthe gods (Davidson 1988:187), while golden apples were among the treasuresof Asgard, preventing the gods from growing old (p. 73). The bright realm issometimes contrasted with a dark and noisome place of death, haunted byserpents. This is perhaps an image of the grave; and the two opposed picturesmay owe something to Christian teaching concerning heaven and hell, althoughagain some elements here may go back to pre-Christian tradition. There is noconsistent picture in Norse literary tradition of the fate of the dead, although theroad to the Otherworld appears to have left vivid memories in the literature.The magnificent poem Voluspá, usually dated to about AD 1000, is one ofour main sources of knowledge for the creation and destruction of the worldsof gods and men, and also of Norse cosmography at the end of the pre-Christianperiod, as it was for Snorri. The unknown poet appears to be familiar withChristian traditions, although not necessarily of the Christian faith. Certainlyhe (or she) was surveying the lore of the gods at a time when the doom of the oldreligion seemed certain, and the familiar world-picture of past generations wasrapidly being replaced by that offered by Christian teachers and missionaries.In this poem the powerful gods Odin and Thor and a host of lesser deitiesare represented as dwelling together in Asgard, a stronghold surrounded by awall and approached by a bridge guarded by Heimdall, watchman of the gods.The list of halls given in Grímnismál indicates a cluster of buildings roofed withgold, among which is Odin’s hall, Valhalla. This has come to occupy a majorplace in any account of Norse religion, because of the emphasis on the manygreat kings and heroes who died in battle and went to join Odin, enjoyingunending battle and feasting until the end of time. The arrival of a hero atValhalla was a popular motif used on memorial stones erected in Gotland aboutthe eighth century (p. 33). Valhalla was never the dwelling-place of theuniversal dead, but intended for outstanding heroes to support Odin in the finalbattle against giants and monsters, giving him a powerful reason forsummoning them to his hall and bringing their careers on earth to a close.Somewhere not far from Asgard was Jotunheim, where dwelt the frost-giantswho were the enemies of the gods, eager to rob them of their treasures, carryoff the fair Freyja and the sun and moon, and destroy Asgard and the inhabitedearth. It is less clear where the Vanir dwelt, since the chief gods, Freyr and Njordwith a number of others, are represented along with the Æsir in Asgard, but itseems probable that it was in the underworld. There is certainly a link betweenthe Vanir and the land-spirits who dwelt in mounds and hills and in water,supernatural beings who befriended some of the early settlers in Iceland (p.119), and probably also between the Vanir and the Elves, who lived on in folktradition as lesser beings. Most of the goddesses who became the wives of thegods came from the underworld, and were said to be the daughters of giants."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"THE GODS IN THE MYTHS71The greatest of the goddesses was Freyja, sister of Freyr and daughter of Njord;she is a goddess of many names, and may originally have been the same asFrigg, the wife of Odin, since elsewhere in Germanic tradition we hear only ofone goddess, Frija, who was the wife of the sky god (p. 108).Once more it must be stressed that we are dealing with shifting and oftenconfused traditions. In the Edda poem Skírnismál, for instance, Freyr or hismessenger travels down into the underworld, a long and daunting journey, toseek out the fair maiden Gerd, the daughter of a fearsome giant. The journeytakes him over high mountains, dark valleys and turbulent rivers, like the roadto the Land of the Dead (Ellis 1943:178 ff.). The purpose of this wooing has beentaken as the marriage of sky god with earth goddess, and Gerd is threatened withutter sterility and negation if she rejects Freyr’s love. The unknown editor of themanuscript book of poems in which Skírnismál is found has linked this themewith Asgard in his introduction by making Freyr seat himself on the seat of Odin,from which he can look out over all the worlds, so that he catches sight of Gerdin the underworld and is overcome with desire for her. This may be seen as anexample of how separate themes have been linked together in the twelfth andthirteenth centuries in an endeavour, like that of Snorri in his Prose Edda, to createa rational whole out of disconnected fragments. The earlier poets and story-tellers would have been unlikely to demand such accuracy and consistency as isrequired by the modern academic mind.Thus we are left with glimpses of a rich and complex world of gods and othersupernatural beings, with entries and exits linking it to the everyday world knownto us. It has been coloured by the imagination of poets and the teaching of wisemen and women concerning the supernatural world, and continued to furnishinspiration to many poets and story-tellers over the centuries. Some scholars, likethe Swedish Rydborg in the last century, have persevered in the hope that aconvincing structure could be built up from the scattered clues, accepting all asof equal value; but this is a hopeless quest, based on the erroneous assumptionthat a set mythology once existed that was logical and tidy in every detail, andremained so over a long period. All that can be claimed is that certain conceptionsconcerning the Otherworld were generally accepted, and that the most powerfulmyths were enacted against this vivid but confused background.MYTHS OF THE DIVINE COMMUNITYOne myth found in both Germanic and Celtic traditions is that of a war in thebeginning between two companies of deities, possibly those of the sky opposedto those of earth and sea. In Scandinavian tradition the two opposing sides werethose of the Æsir and the Vanir, while in Irish tradition the Tuatha De firstdefeated the Fir Bolg and then the Fomorians, the latter led by a former king ofthe gods deposed for his meanness and tyranny. The first battle was a victory forthe gods and ended in a truce, with Ireland divided between them. The secondbattle, described in greater detail, was one in which the Fomorians displayed"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE72powerful magical skills and the gods had to meet them with both force and spells.At this point Lug, the Many-Skilled, became their leader, and they achievedvictory, because those slain on their own side were brought back to life byimmersing them in the Well of Regeneration, and Lug himself slew their chiefopponent, Balor of the Evil Eye, with a stone from his sling. These are describedas the two battles of Mag Tuired, which some think was derived from an earlieraccount of one battle (Gray 1980–1:196). Points of importance are the truce thatended the first battle, the various institutions established among the people as aresult, and the emphasis on the four treasures of the gods, which were the stoneof Fal, the spear of Lug, the sword of Núadu and the cauldron of the Dagda. Inher study of the myth, Gray (1980–1:184) emphasized that here we areconcerned with the establishment of society and its periodic regeneration.In Scandinavian tradition as we have it in the poem Voluspá and the accountin Ynglinga Saga 4, there is little information about battles (though Snorri clearlyimplies there was more than one), but we are told that this was the first war inthe world, beginning when Odin hurled his spear. It ended in an agreement bywhich both sides exchanged hostages, so that Freyr and Njord came to dwell withthe Æsir. One important result was the creation of the divine mead of inspiration.It began when the gods all spat into a bowl as a sign of unity, and from the divinespittle created a wise giant, Kvasir, who could answer all questions. However,he was killed by two malicious dwarves, who let his blood flow into three vatsand mixed it with honey to make mead. This was the drink bringing inspirationand wisdom, but they were forced to give it up to a giant named Suttung, whoseparents they had killed, when he threatened to drown them. Thus in poetry thetreasured drink might be described as ‘blood of Kvasir’, or ‘ship of the dwarves’(since it saved them from a watery death). Suttung shut up the mead within amountain, but Odin found a way to reach it, boring a hole in the rock andcrawling in in serpent form. He then persuaded the giant’s daughter to let himtake three drinks of the mead after three nights of love-making, and havingswallowed it he flew back to Asgard in eagle-form and spewed it out into vesselsthat the gods had made ready to receive it. This part of the tale is depicted onone of the Gotland stones from Larbro, in Stora Hammars (Lindqvist 1941:1,fig. 85; II, 83 ff.), so that it was known as early as the eighth century (Figure 25).The idea of a divine drink is found in other mythologies, and the tradition of thesacred soma in Iranian sources is particularly interesting to compare with theNorse myth as related by Snorri in Skáldskaparmál and referred to in the poemHávamál (Davidson 1978b:107).Another myth concerning the gods as a group is that of the building of theirstronghold. This also is one of the myths of the beginning, and is told inGylfaginning 41. Snorri declares it a story worth telling, but we do not knowhis source. When the gods were setting up Asgard, a craftsman offered to builda wall round it, as a defence against the giants, and to complete his work in ayear and a half, by the first day of summer, or forfeit any payment. If hesucceeded, he was promised Freyja for his wife and the sun and moon besides."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"THE GODS IN THE MYTHS73The gods thought that he could never finish in so short a time, since he was tohave no other builders to help him, but he was assisted by his powerful andsagacious horse, which moved the stones without difficulty and did twice asmuch as his master. Three days before the time was up, he had almost reachedthe gateway and ended the wall, and the gods were appalled. As on otheroccasions, they were saved by the cunning of Loki, who took on the form of amare and lured away the giant’s stallion. The work was left incomplete, thesmith flew into a mighty rage, and was slain by Thor’s hammer, as herecognized him as a hostile giant. One result of this was a splendid strongholdfor the gods, and another a colt produced by Loki in his mare-form; this grewinto the wonderful eight-legged horse of Odin.Another tale of a contest between gods and giants is that of the theft of thegolden apples that enabled the gods to retain perpetual youth. Here we arefortunate in having a skaldic poem of the ninth or early tenth century,Haustlong, considerably earlier than the account in Snorri’s Skáldskaparmál(Holtsmark 1949; Kiil 1959), giving us part of the story. As Snorri tells it, thethree gods, Odin, Loki and Hoenir were on a journey together and becamehungry. They took an ox from a herd nearby and set about roasting it, but themeat failed to cook. Then they saw a huge eagle on the tree above who offeredto cook the meat if he might have his share. They agreed to this, but when theeagle carried off the greater part of the carcase, Loki struck it with a stick,whereupon the bird flew up into the air with the stick attached to him and Lokiclinging desperately on to it. The giant Thjazi, as the eagle proved to be, refusedto release Loki until he promised to bring to him the goddess Idun (possiblyFreyja under another name) and her apples of youth. Loki enticed Idun out ofAsgard so that the eagle could bear her away. Before long the gods developedwrinkles and grey hair, and when they discovered Loki’s guilt they threatenedhim with death if he did not bring the goddess back. He borrowed Freyja’sfeather-coat and flew as a falcon to Jotunheim, changed Idun into a nut, andcarried her back to Asgard. There the gods had prepared a heap of shavings towhich they set fire as Thjazi came in pursuit of Loki in his eagle-form; his wingswere singed, and he fell, to be killed in what Snorri declared to be a most famousslaying. There are few differences between Snorri’s account and the early poem,which professes to describe pictures on a shield; it may be noted that SnorriFigure 25 Odin returns with magic mead, on memorial stone from Larbro, StHammars, Gotland (after Nylen)."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE74makes specific reference to apples, while the poem refers only to the secret ofyouth known to Idun, and also that there is mention in the poem of flamingdarts used to slay Thjazi, presumably the lightning of Thor. Snorri cannot,however, be accused of having changed or remodelled the tale to any greatextent.The gods again appear as a group in the myth of the binding of the wolfFenrir. As Snorri tells it in Gylfaginning 24, the most dangerous of Loki’ssinister offspring was a wolf cub, which was raised in Asgard, and which grewso huge and ferocious that only Tyr was bold enough to feed him. The godstried to bind him, but every chain broke as soon as he exerted his mightystrength. Finally, Odin had a special chain forged from secret, invisible things,such as the roots of a mountain and the breath of a fish; this appeared to be asilken cord, but no force could break it. The wolf refused to have it round hisneck unless one of the gods put a hand between his jaws as a pledge that thecord was as harmless as it looked. Tyr was the only one prepared to risk hishand, and he lost it when the wolf found the chain could not be broken, whilethe other gods laughed. Thus the wolf was bound, but Odin knew that hewould break loose at Ragnarok, and that it was Fenrir who was fated to destroyhim, as shown on a cross in the Isle of Man of about AD 1000 (p. 50). Tyr withhis hand in the jaws of a wolf has been claimed to be recognizable on a groupof bracteates of about the sixth century (p. 40).Again, the gods are represented as a company in the account of Balder’sfuneral. The source for Snorri’s description of this in Gylfaginning is notknown, and it is possible that he is describing a picture here, or making use ofsome early poem which described one. Snorri retells the Balder story at somelength, representing him as the divine son of Odin, loved by his mother Frigg,who did all she could to protect him. In the poem Baldrs Draumar (‘Balder’sDreams’) Balder had a series of ominous dreams, and Odin rode down into theunderworld to discover what fate had been decreed for him. Snorri makes hisdeath a result of the machinations of Loki and caused by a shaft of mistletoe,the only plant that had given no pledge to Frigg never to harm her son. Balder’sdeath acts as a prelude to Ragnarok, the time when the ruling gods weredestroyed and the earth, engulfed in flame, sank beneath the sea.When the gods and goddesses assembled at Balder’s funeral, they watchedwhile he was placed on a funeral pyre on his ship, which was then sent out tosea. It is a vivid account, followed by two strange tales. First, a character calledHermod rode down to the realm of the dead to see if Balder could be broughtback from death; Snorri calls him a son of Odin, but he rode Sleipnir and mayoriginally have been Odin himself. Hel, the ruler of the land of the dead,declared that Balder could only return if everything on earth wept for him, butagain Loki prevented this, appearing as a giantess in a cave who refused to jointhe others in their weeping. Then comes the account of the punishment the godsimposed on Loki, binding him under three great stones and leaving him withvenomous snakes dropping poison from above. His wife helped him by"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"THE GODS IN THE MYTHS75catching most of the poison in a bowl, and this is apparently the scene carvedon the Gosforth Cross in Cumbria in the Viking Age (p. 50).The coming of Ragnarok is again something that concerns all the gods, sincegiant adversaries ride across the rainbow bridge and enter Asgard, and otherscome by sea with Loki, escaped from his bonds. In what may have been aseparate tradition, the wolf, serpent and Loki himself all escape from the placeswhere the gods have secured them and join in the attack. The poem Voluspátells of a series of duels in which Odin, Thor, Tyr, Freyr and Heimdall fall,although their opponents also perish. In the scenario of the fall of the gods,however, it is Odin who remains in the centre of the picture.Although Balder’s name occasionally occurs in place-names, there is no clearevidence that he was ever worshipped as a god, and the origin of the Balder legendis one of the most tantalizing problems in Scandinavian mythology. Accordingto Saxo, he was one of the warriors of Odin, and therefore like other famouschampions known as his son, and he was killed by a rival warrior, Mother. Balderreceived aid from a group of supernatural women who seem to be valkyries, andwas clearly under Odin’s protection. Instead of the plant mistletoe, there was onespecial sword which could cause his death; Mother obtained it from theunderworld and dealt Balder a fatal wound. The idea of a young god smittendown and lamented by all nature might come from some tradition associatedwith the fertility deities, or brought in from abroad, but the question remainsunresolved. It is a good example of a tradition brilliantly retold by Snorri in thethirteenth century which has been accepted without question in most books onnorthern mythology and in Frazer’s Golden Bough. There is general agreement,however, that Balder’s death marks a final setback to the power of Odin, andleads on inevitably to Ragnarok and the fall of the gods.The conception of a company of gods living together in Asgard appears wellestablished in the religion of the Viking Age. The gods were honoured in agroup at religious feasts, and several were mentioned together in oath formulas,while they could be appealed to as a group in cases of treachery and oath-breaking. In Voluspá there is a convincing picture of them establishing orderand sitting as a council to deliberate and make judgements. Plural terms areused for the gods in the poetry: such as Regin, emphasizing their power to rule;and Hopt and Bond, words referring to their power to bind. It may be notedthat in the first century AD Tacitus refers to the Germans consulting orappealing to the gods as a group. There is no myth of a single creator god; inVoluspá three of them are said to cooperate in the creation of man.The Irish sources also give a strong impression of a company of divinebeings, the Tuátha Dé Danann (people or tribes of the goddess Dana). Theseinhabit a number of mounds or islands, or dwell under the sea, just as thevarious Scandinavian deities have separate dwellings but form a companyunited against the giants. There seems no possibility that the conception of thegods as a group developed late in the work of writers like Snorri. Indeed, thepicture of a settled divine community, even if disturbed by quarrels and rivalries"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE76from time to time, is paralleled in many other mythologies throughout theworld. There is also evidence for Scandinavians setting up a number of woodenfigures to represent their gods, to whom they made offerings (p.94), andreferences to more than one image in pre-Christian shrines. As far back as weare able to go, there is evidence for organized worship of a group of deities,although separate gods might have their individual cults.MYTHS OF ODINOdin appears in the northern myths in three main aspects, as ruler of the land ofthe dead, god of battle, and god of inspiration, magic and wisdom; his long listof names emphasizes these varied characteristics and powers. In the myths as wehave them, he is Allfather, leader of the gods, some of whom are called his sons,the eldest being Thor, according to Gylfaginning. In Snorri’s preface to the ProseEdda, however, he makes Odin a distant descendant of Thor, here representedas a prince from Troy who moved into the northern world. Once the urge tocompile genealogies comes over a writer of the twelfth or thirteenth century, itseems that he moves on learned lines of his own and departs from oral tradition.The myths representing Odin as the god of death are linked with his powerto rule the battlefield and to award victory to whichever side he chooses. In hisdesire to bring great champions to Valhalla, he either comes to summon themhimself or sends the valkyries, his female attendants, to escort them to theOther-world when their time on earth is over. He shows great favour to manykings and heroes, such as Sigmund the Volsung, whose story is told in the lateVosunga Saga, partly based on earlier heroic poems. In his youth Sigmundobtained a splendid sword from the god, when Odin as an old man in a cloakentered the hall of King Volsung and plunged it into the tree-trunk supportingthe roof. None could draw it out except the young Sigmund, and from that timehe was Odin’s favoured warrior, until finally the same old man met him on thebattlefield and shattered the sword with his spear.Another king supported by Odin was Harald Wartooth of Denmark, whoaccording to the Danish historian Saxo (VIII, 263) was instructed in battlestrategy by the god and granted many victories; finally, however, at the battleof Bråvalla Odin took the place of his charioteer, and in spite of the old king’spleas flung him down and slew him with his own sword as he fell. Other talesof Odin’s gifts and relentless withdrawal of luck in the end can be found in theliterature, and he is more than once accused of faithlessness and treachery. Inthe tenth-century poem Hákonarmál, Odin is asked why he allows noble kingsto fall in battle, and his reply is significant: ‘The grey wolf watches the abodesof the gods.’ Under the constant threat of Ragnarok, when the wolf will devourhim, Odin must gather the finest champions to defend Asgard from theexpected attack.Tales of Odin’s doings on earth are linked with his image as a divinesupporter of kings, and this is partly responsible for the large part that he plays"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"THE GODS IN THE MYTHS77in the mythological literature, much of which must have been popular in royalhalls. Valhalla was reserved for princely champions and warriors ofoutstanding renown, while the dead in general passed to the realm of Hel,personified as a giantess and said to be Loki’s daughter. Odin knew the waydown to the realm of death, and sometimes travelled there to learn what thefuture was to be, as in the poem Baldrs Draumar. Sometimes, like the GreekHermes, he is the guide who conducts the dead to the Otherworld. In VosungaSaga he carries away the dead son of Sigmund in his boat, and in one poem,Hárbarðsljóð, he is represented as a ferryman.There is no doubt that Odin in the myths displays certain shamaniccharacteristics, since the main function of the shaman is to journey in spirit tothe Other-world, consult the gods or the dead, and bring back the soul ofsomeone threatened with death. It is usually on Sleipnir, his eight-legged horse,that Odin travels from one world to another, although when on earth he is usuallysaid to walk in the guise of an old man with one eye, his face hidden by a hoodor a broad-brimmed hat. The eight-legged horse is portrayed on Gotland stonesof about the eighth century (p. 33). Like the shaman again, Odin could journeyin animal—or bird-form, while his body lay in a trance (Ynglinga Saga 7), andin some early poems he travels as an eagle; again like the shaman, he receives newsof happenings far away, brought to him by his two ravens. In the poetry theirnames are given as Thought and Memory (Grímnismál 20), a partialrationalization, but perhaps based on earlier tradition, since a pair of birds isfound on bracteates well before the Viking Age. The image of Odin hanging ona tree and enduring torment in order to win mastery of the runes, as given inHávamál (138), is also consistent with the initiation of a shaman through torture,death and resurrection before he can achieve his full powers.Odin was seen as the god of ecstasy and inspiration. He could inspire warriorsin battle to a state of berserk rage in which they feared nothing and felt no pain(Davidson 1988:79 ff.), and could also give command over words to poets andorators. The meaning of his names Wodan/Odin was ‘fury’, or ‘madness’, andthis is in accordance with this side of his character. The emphasis on the mead ofinspiration is strong in skaldic poetry; poets like Egil Skallagrimsson claimed tohave drunk from it, and often refer to poetry as the gift of Odin, using a wealthof kennings. The story of the recovery of the mead from the giants, referred toearlier, seems likely to be an ancient one. Part of the gift of inspiration offeredby Odin is that of wisdom and magic. He has knowledge of the future, gainedthrough the power to visit other worlds, and this is much stressed in themythological poems. In Vafþrúðnismál, in spite of the warnings of Frigg, he visitsanother ancient giant in pursuit of wisdom, although he risks death if he losesthe question-and-answer game. As a practitioner of magic, Odin is supreme.Many spells associated with him in Hávamál are for use in battle, and he wasfamed for his power to free men from bonds, either material or psychological,and to bind his enemies. This destructive influence over the mind was the oppositeof the gift of ecstasy which gave freedom from fear. The object of his sacrifice"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE78on the World Tree was to gain knowledge of runes, which were employed indivination ceremonies, and probably reddened with sacrificial blood (Davidson1988:148, 153). There is a second tradition of how he gained knowledge bysacrifice, by giving one of his eyes to the guardian of the spring beneath the rootof the World Tree in return for a drink of the water that could reveal hiddensecrets. This guardian was the mysterious giant Mimir, who according to Snorrihad his head cut off by the Vanir to whom he was sent as a hostage (YnglingaSaga 4). The head was returned to Odin, who preserved it and consulted it intimes of crisis. Some have assumed this to be a borrowing from Ireland, but thelink between a speaking head and a well has interesting parallels in English folktradition (Simpson 1962). In Hávamál Odin is represented as a mighty seer, andhis knowledge of the future is another of his gifts to men, though not always awelcome one. This foreknowledge of the god, acquired through dangerousjourneys and personal torment, was linked with the destinies of kings andkingdoms, an important element in the religion of the gods.Odin must be seen mainly as a deity of aristocratic warriors, and his cult, likethat of Mithraism, was well suited to fighting men. On the whole, he appearshostile to women, although the Odin tales contain a number of intrepid womenof noble birth who are prepared, like Brynhild, to end their lives and join the deadheroes in another world. However, the picture of women given in Hávamálstresses their fickle nature and dangerous influence on any who trust them.Starkad, a typical hero of Odin, whose story is told most fully in Saxo’s history,held women in utter contempt. Odin’s own unsuccessful wooing of Billing’sdaughter (not known elsewhere) is presented in Hávamál as comedy. Arrivingat her invitation to enjoy a night with her, Odin found armed guards awaitinghim, and when he came back later a dog was tied to the bed. The wooing of Rind,however, was a different matter, and came about, not because he was overcomewith desire for her, but because he knew he must have a son by her to avenge thekilling of Balder. Saxo tells this story (III, 78), indicating that there were otherversions, and, according to him, all Odin’s efforts to woo the princess failed, untilhe disguised himself as a woman doctor and persuaded her father to leave Rindin his charge. Later a son, Vali, was born to her who grew up to kill Mother,Balder’s slayer. An early poem of the tenth century refers to Odin working magicon Rind, and in the poem Baldrs Draumar the vengeance of Vali on Mother isprophesied, so that this story may be an early myth. In his dealings with thedaughters of giants, Odin shows himself a deceiver and trickster, using them forhis own ends, not an ardent lover, like Freyr, or a dangerous enemy, like Thor.The Celtic god who most closely resembles Odin is Lug, who was a majordeity among the early Celts on the continent and in Britain (p. 59). Not manytales about him survive, but in the account of the Second Battle of Mag Tuiredwe are told how he came by the title of ‘the Many-Skilled.’ He arrived at thecourt of Tara, and when asked what he could do, made a series of offers, sayingthat he was skilled as a craftsman, a smith, a champion, a harper, a poet, awizard, a doctor, a cup-bearer and a worker in metals. There were already men"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"THE GODS IN THE MYTHS79possessing such skills in Tara, but since no one possessed them all as he did, hewas welcomed in, to become the new ruler of the gods. He killed Balor, theirmost dangerous opponent, and brought them victory (p. 72). Another tale tellshow Lug was visited by a king from Tara, who saw him reigning as a king inthe underworld, attended by a fair lady who represented the sovereignty ofIreland (MacCana 1955–8). Lug was said to be the divine father of the greathero Cú Chulainn, whom he protected in battle and healed when wounded.Both Lug and Odin were identified with Mercury by the Romans; both wereprotectors of kings and warriors, and might father heroes; both were gods ofvaried skills, carried great spears, and had marvellous steeds to bear them overland and sea. They were associated with ravens and crows, and each had a pairof ravens to bring tidings, while they could also fly in eagle-form. Both had cultplaces on hills, and are represented as ruling over the dead. There are, however,considerable differences between them. Lug is usually represented as a youthfulfigure, like the young Mercury, and heals wounded warriors, which is not verycharacteristic of Odin, although his protégé Starkad survives terrible wounds.In fact, the resemblances between them are not of the kind to suggestborrowings at a late date; they are more likely to be memories of a powerfulgod who developed differently among the Celts and the Germans.Few myths concerning the earlier Germanic Wodan or the Woden of theAnglo-Saxons have survived, but there is one related by Paul the Deacon, inhis eighth-century History, probably taken from an earlier work, the OrboGentis Langobardum. In this, Wodan’s wife Frija wanted her husband to givethe people of the Winniles, whom she favoured, a new name and grant themvictory in battle. She told the whole tribe to come out at sunrise, bringing theirwomen with them with their hair hanging over their faces, and turned Wodan’sbed round so that he would see them as he woke and no longer be facing theVandals whom he had previously favoured. His first words were: ‘Who arethese longbeards?’ and Frija then told him that now he had given them a namehe must grant the gift of victory to go with it. The idea of the god and his wifesupporting rival claimants is found again in the prose introduction toGrímnismál. Wodan is the Langobardic myth seems to be regarded as a skygod, associated with the rising sun, and the idea of Odin looking down on earthis found again in the tradition of his seat, from which he can view all worlds atonce. This suggests that his powers for the Germanic peoples were by no meansrestricted to the dark underworld and the realm of the dead.MYTHS OF THORWhereas myths about Odin are concerned largely with the acquisition of wisdomand the fates of rulers and kingdoms, ending with the fall of his own realm ofAsgard, those associated with Thor are of a different kind. They emphasize hispower over the natural world, and his many contests with supernaturaladversaries in his position as protector of the gods and of mankind. In some of"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE80the earliest skaldic verse, going back to the ninth century, he is described asadvancing with fire and thunderous clamour, rending rocks and destroying hisopponents. He is associated with storms and wind, but above all with thunderand lightning. There seems no doubt that his great axe-hammer, one of thetreasures of the gods and greatly coveted by the giants, represents the power oflightning to fell trees and shatter rocks. The poem Thrymskviða deals with theattempts of the giants to acquire it; we are not told how the theft came about,but it might have been due to the treachery of Loki, when forced in somedesperate situation to agree to the giant’s demands, as happens in other tales.Once the hammer was lost, there was no possibility of Asgard surviving for long,and if Freyja were taken from the gods, the loss would be a fatal one.Thor in various myths is said to be absent from Asgard, busy killing giants,and he evidently made many journeys into Jotunheim, some of which featurein the surviving tales. His journey to the realm of Geirrod was rememberedfrom an early period, as there is a long poem, Thórsdrápa, about it by EilifGodrunarson which goes back to about the year 1000 (Skáldskaparmál 18).In Snorri’s account, Loki was captured by the giant when he was flying in hishawk-shape, and Geirrod starved him until he agreed to bring Thor to his realmwithout his hammer or his belt of strength. However, the god was warned ofhis danger by a friendly giantess, who lent him another belt, her own irongloves, and a magic staff. With Loki clinging to his belt, Thor crossed a mightyriver, and they were nearly swept away. Then he saw that the flooding wascaused by one of the giant daughters of Geirrod, standing astride the river andurinating into it. He struck her down with a boulder, and then caught hold ofa rowan tree (henceforward called by poets ‘Salvation of Thor’) and climbedout into the giant’s kingdom. He was given a goat-shed for lodging, with oneseat, and when he sat on this it began to move upwards towards the roof, untilhe forced it down with his magic staff. Thus he broke the backs of the tworemaining daughters of Geirrod, who had intended to kill him. Then Thorentered the giant’s hall to take part in games of skill. Geirrod hurled a red-hotiron-bolt at him, but he caught it in his iron gloves and flung it back, piercingthe pillar behind which the giant tried to shelter and running him through.This myth has a number of interesting features. The giantess causing theriver to swell is also found in Irish tradition, for the Morrígan, a sinister battlegoddess, increases the flow of a river in this way, and there are other relevantexamples (Bower 1975). It certainly emphasizes the link between the hugegiantesses and the natural world, and is an example of the monstrous, barbaricelement found in a number of myths. In this case, however, it is not clear whereSnorri found his story. He certainly knew Thórsdrápa, but also gives aquotation from another poem in direct narrative style, referring to the increaseof Thor’s divine strength, which suggests a lost source. Perhaps from this alsocomes Thor’s robust comment as he flings a rock at the giantess: ‘A spring mustbe dammed at the source!’ Unfortunately the language of Thórsdrápa isobscure, with complex multiple kennings, so that it is hard to be sure exactly"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"THE GODS IN THE MYTHS81what is implied. It is clear that Loki deceived Thor into making the journey,while much emphasis is laid on the crossing of the tumultuous river, and on theincrease in Thor’s divine might. The flood is connected with the giantess, butin what way is not made clear. There is a reference to water as ‘the blood ofthe sun’s dwelling’ (that is, rain falling from clouds) and the river is called ‘thewater of the women of the giant’. In the poem Thor has his servant Thjalfi withhim as well as Loki, and there is apparently a fight with giants before the godreaches the hall. This is a good illustration of the problems confronting anyonewho attempts to continue the search for a particular myth beyond Snorri.The episode where Thor overcomes the giant in the hall is included in thepoem, and this could be developed in different ways by later writers, as Simpsonshows in her study of the fourteenth-century Thorsteins Saga (1966:13 ff.). Thetheme was also treated by Saxo Grammaticus, at about the beginning of thethirteenth century, in his account of Thorkill the Far-Travelled in Book VIII, whodiscovers the battered bodies of Geirrod and his daughters among the rocks. Herefers to Thor driving a flaming ingot through the giant which smashed themountain to pieces, while his thunderbolts destroyed the giantesses. There seemsno indication apart from Snorri that Thor travelled without his hammer on thisoccasion, but he was evidently lured into a trap of some kind. It seems that therewas a tradition that Geirrod was an underworld smith, since on one occasion ina poem he is called the giant ‘of the big bellows’ (Flateyjarbók III:417).Another tale told by Snorri but not found in the skaldic poets, is Thor’sjourney to the kingdom of Utgard-Loki. Part of this as told in Gylfaginning 43ff. may be Snorri’s own invention, since the account of the contest in the giant’shall is witty and sophisticated, with use of allegory and personification notnormally found in Norse myths, but this does not mean that the frameworkof the tale was not based on an early source. Thor was accompanied here byLoki and Thjalfi, the latter said to be the son of a farmer at whose house hestayed on the way. That night Thor sacrificed his goats for dinner and cookedthem in his cauldron; after the meal he collected the bones on the skins, andrestored them to life by raising his hammer over them. Unfortunately thefarmer, disregarding Thor’s warnings, had cracked a leg-bone, so that one goatwas lame. He was terrified by Thor’s rage at his disobedience, but in the endthe god relented, only taking Thjalfi and his sister (who plays no further partin the tale) with him as his servants. They travelled through a huge forest, wherethey met an enormous giant called Skrymir (‘Big Fellow’), whose glove was sohuge that Thor and his party took it for a hall. The giant journeyed with themand humiliated Thor by leaving him with a bag of provisions which he wasunable to open, and keeping them awake at night by his snoring. Even whenThor struck him with his hammer, he remained apparently unaffected. Utgard-Loki’s stronghold was so huge that Thor was able to crawl in under the gate,and more humiliation awaited him inside. Thjalfi, a swift runner, was utterlyoutstripped by his opponent, while Loki was defeated in an eating contest. Thorhimself failed to drain a huge horn in three draughts, to overcome an old"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE82woman in a wrestling match, or even to lift the giant’s grey cat from the floor.Not until they were outside the gate next morning was it revealed howdeceiving magic had been practised against them. The blow from Thor’shammer had fallen on a mountain and left a huge cavity in it; the bag he couldnot undo was fastened with bands of iron; Thjalfi had raced against Thought,swifter than any runner; while Loki’s opponent was Fire, which devoured dishand meat together. Thor himself had been given a horn with its tip in the sea,and his great efforts to empty it had brought down the level of the ocean, whilehe had wrestled with Old Age, against which the strongest fights in vain. Thecat was in reality the World Serpent, and all were terrified when he got one ofits feet off the ground, lest he should pull the monster out of the depths.We have no idea what original myth may lie behind this brilliantly told tale.N.K.Chadwick (1964) has shown that there are parallels to the adventures inthe forest in Russian medieval poetry about the giant hero Svyatogor, who playsa part resembling that of Skrymir, while the hero Ilya finds himself in a positionresembling that of Thor. The term ‘Utgard’ can be used for ‘regions beyond’, andmight in this case refer to the mountains of the Caucasus, where there were earlytraditions of a bound giant, still remembered locally in the nineteenth century;like Loki, this giant was to break free from his bonds at the end of the world. Talesabout him might have been brought into Scandinavia by Vikings visiting theCaucasus region in the tenth century (Davidson 1976:314 ff.). The problemsinvolved in this single well-known tale indicate the limitation of our knowledge.Another tale of Thor matched against a giant is that of his duel withHrungnir, again found in a tenth-century poem, Haustlong, and retold bySnorri. In the account in Skáldskaparmál (17), Thor was away from Asgardwhen Odin was challenged by the giant Hrungnir to race his horse Sleipniragainst that of the giant. Odin won easily, but Hrungnir galloped into Asgard,where he was invited to drink with the gods, and became boastful and abusive,threatening to sink their stronghold into the sea and carry off the goddesses.When Thor arrived with his hammer, Hrungnir claimed immunity as a guestand challenged Thor to a duel. For no very clear reason, the giants made a hugeman out of clay with a mare’s heart, called Mistcalf, to stand beside Hrungnirwith his heart of stone, stone shield, and whetstone for a weapon. Thjalfi toldhim to stand on his shield in case Thor came up from below, but the godappeared with thunder and lightning and hurled his hammer. Hrungnir threwhis whetstone, and the weapons met in mid-air so that the whetstone wasshattered, one piece lodging in Thor’s head, while the hammer smashedHrungnir’s skull, and Thjalfi broke up the clay giant. The seeress Groa failedto remove the stone from Thor’s head and there it remained.Much of the skaldic poem is taken up by description of the god’spreparations for battle and his approach in the terror of the storm. Hrungniris said to fall before the hammer, with no reference to a clay giant; such anirrelevant figure might conceivably be based on some kind of ritual performedto illustrate the myth. The whetstone is mentioned, and there might be a link"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"THE GODS IN THE MYTHS83between the piece lodged in Thor’s head and the so-called gods’ nails(reginnaglar) set in the high seat pillars of hall or shrine, which were apparentlyassociated with Thor (Eyrbyggja Saga 4). The duel with Hrungnir seems tohave been one of Thor’s most celebrated exploits. In Lokasenna his hammeris called ‘Bane of Hrungnir’, and other kennings that refer to this battle indicatethat it was part of a widespread myth, although as retold by Snorri it gives theimpression that he does not understand what is recorded about it by the poets.The most popular of the myths about Thor in the Viking Age, however,appears to have been the tale of his fishing for the World Serpent. The survivingcarvings of this in various parts of the Viking world, together with accountsfrom early skaldic poems, show a continuous tradition for at least fourcenturies (p. 51). This myth may originally have been one concerning the eventsat the beginning, when the gods secured various monsters who threatened theirsecurity. In some of the surviving accounts, however, it seems to indicate amoment of crisis, when Thor almost raised the serpent from the deep but it sankdown again, leaving the world safe for a while; the account of the struggle tolift the grey cat in the hall of Utgard-Loki sounds like a humorous echo of this.There must have been other supernatural adversaries of Thor afterwardsforgotten. A verse in his praise by Thorbjorn Dísarskáld lists two giants andsix giantesses as his victims, while another poet Vetrlidi refers to the killing oftwo other giants and a giantess as well as the crushing of Gjalp, one of Geirrod’sdaughters. Unfortunately, our knowledge of the giant world is all too limited.Thor’s enemies are usually called frost-giants, living in the mountains, andfrostgiants were said to be among the first beings created, many of whichperished in the blood of Ymir, the first being from whose body the world wascreated. There were also giants of the underworld, ancient beings full ofwisdom and knowledge of the past which went beyond that of the gods. Thetales preserve remnants only of what must have been a great body of giant lore.Sometimes the Vanir, the deities of fertility, are represented as fair giants ofearth and water, and giants are often fathers of the goddesses.The god in Irish tradition who has most in common with Thor is the Dagda,the ‘Good God’. Like Thor he is enormously strong, and renowned for his hugeappetite. This is shown in the tale of the Second Battle of Mag Tuired, when hisenemies the Fomorians prepared a meal of porridge for him containing 80 gallonsof milk and equal amounts of meal and fat, together with carcases of goats, sheepand swine. This they poured into a hole in the ground, and challenged him toeat it all. He devoured it with the help of an enormous ladle, and even managedto mate with the daughter of the Fomorian leader afterwards. Like Thor, whoin Hymiskviða is seeking cauldrons for the gods’ feast, he was associated withsuch vessels, possessing a famous cauldron that held enough to satisfy everyguest, and he had a huge club as his weapon with which he could both slay andrecall the dead to life, as Thor did with his hammer. Both these weapons seem tohave been associated with the marking of boundaries. Thor and the Dagda weredown-to-earth, undignified figures, walking rather than riding, although Thor"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE84had his wagon drawn by goats. Yet just as Thor was associated with law and waspatron of the Assembly, so the Dagda is called ‘Lord of Perfect Knowledge’. Againthere is little indication of borrowing here, yet the two gods have much incommon in their tremendous power and virility and closeness to the land, andtheir somewhat primitive weapons, while they are convincingly represented aspossessors of divine energy.MYTHS OF LOKIAmong the complexities of giant lore must be counted the double nature of Loki,sometimes a small, nimble figure, clinging to Thor’s belt or carried by an eagle,and sometimes a mighty bound giant who will break loose along with wolf andserpent on the last day and lead other giants in an attack on Asgard. There isuncertainty as to whether he was ever counted as a god, yet he was a friend ofboth Odin and Thor and went on adventures with them, while he made illicitlove to the goddesses and was a resident of Asgard, knowing its most intimatesecrets, according to the cynical poem Lokasenna. He was usually responsiblefor the theft of divine treasures by the giants, but also the only one who found away to get them back again. Thus he helped to recover Thor’s stolen hammer,stagemanaging the scene where Thor was disguised as Freyja (p. 65); he deprivedthe giant builder of his horse, and rescued Idun and her apples. He was alsolargely responsible for the making of the gods’ finest treasures, as recounted inSkáldskaparmál. When he cut off the golden hair of Thor’s wife, Sif, Thorshowed such fury that Loki had to find dwarf craftsmen to make her new hairof pure gold. They then went on to make a magic ship for Freyr which could goagainst wind and tide, and a wonderful spear for Odin. After this Loki assembleda rival team of craftsmen, wagering his head that these could not produce finertreasures. However, they set to work and made a golden boar for Freyr andFreyja, the gold ring Draupnir for Odin from which more rings dropped everyninth night, and finally Thor’s hammer, declared the most valuable treasure ofall. Thus Loki finally lost his wager, but in the end kept his head, although thedwarves sewed up his lips for a while. According to this tale the very existenceof the gods, depending as it did on the invincible hammer, was due to Loki,although characteristically he did his best to spoil it in the making.Other myths about Loki show him to be a master of shape-changing. Hecould become a mare, and even produce a colt, so that Sleipnir, the eight-leggedhorse of Odin, was among the treasures of the gods; he could fly in hawk-form,and after Balder’s death became a salmon in a vain attempt to escape the furyof the gods. The early poem Haustlong implies that Loki and Heimdall foughtin the form of seals in the sea. Many of the sources telling of Loki’s tricks arelate (de Vries 1933), and entertaining trickster tales of this kind are likely tobe invented by story-tellers long after active belief in the gods came to an end.His character of divine thief, however, may well go back to early times. Therehave been many attempts to analyse Loki’s part in the myths, and he has been"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"THE GODS IN THE MYTHS85interpreted as a fire demon, a water demon, a figure closely linked with theChristian devil, or with the spider (locke in Swedish) in folk tradition (Rooth1961). The general character of Loki in the myths, however, is that of thetrickster who appears in a number of mythologies. Such figures are ambivalent,doing both good and harm to their companion deities; they act to some extentas culture heroes, since their adventures, which often bring comic mishaps uponthemselves, may result in great and lasting benefits for the gods and formankind. By their relationship to the great gods, they act as catalysts, releasingcreative activity.There is a parallel to Loki in Irish tradition in the form of Bricriu, nicknamed‘Poison-Tongue’, who is represented as a satiric poet at the court of Conchobar(Ó hÓgain 1990:58). He, like Loki, was a builder, for while Loki built a specialhouse facing in four directions when attempting to escape from the gods,Bricriu in the tale of ‘Bricriu’s Feast’ built a wonderful hall in which he held abanquet for the champions of Ulster and their wives (Ganz 1981:221 ff.). Hethreatened to create endless strife if they did not accept his invitation, and whenthey came he skilfully set one against another, just as Loki in Lokasenna arriveduninvited at the feast of the gods and flung inflammatory words and insults atboth gods and goddesses; but his scheming, like Loki’s, led to his downfall andhe suffered in the end more than his victims. Loki’s involvement in the Baldertale has caused much argument, and some have thought it a late addition tothe myth. Even more mysterious is his appearance as a sinister giant, associatedwith death, and finally bound under rocks until the coming of Ragnarok, whilehe is also said to have fathered three evil monsters, the wolf, the serpent andHel, ruler of the realm of death. He has sometimes been seen as the shadow-side of Odin, a second creator whose plans are essentially evil. It may also benoted that he plays an essential part in early sources in luring both gods andgoddesses out of Asgard into the realm of the giants, and such expeditions endwith the triumph of the gods over their enemies. Detailed studies of Loki, suchas those by de Vries (1933), Dumezil (1948) and Rooth (1961), with discussionof various theories, show how difficult it is to establish the early backgroundof these stories of the gods, or to discover what they meant to those who listenedto them or narrated them. The Loki tales, amusing, lively and deservedlypopular, are among the most difficult to assess.OTHER DEITIES IN THE MYTHSOther gods appear only briefly in the myths. Freyr in Skírnismál is the wooerof Gerd (p. 71). Tyr is the central actor in the story of the binding of the wolf;it has been claimed that he was an early sky god whose powers later passed toThor and Odin. Njord, Heimdall, Hoenir, Aegir and Bragi figure briefly, butknowledge of them is limited. The goddesses were clearly important in northernreligion, yet only Frigg and Freyja play any main part in the tales, while thereare brief appearances by Skadi, daughter of Thjazi the giant, Gefion, who"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE86ploughed the island of Sjaelland out of Sweden, and Idun who guarded thegolden apples; it is possible that these last two are to be identified with Freyjaunder different names. The subject of the goddesses, however, will be discussedin a later chapter (p. 108). The main myths of the gods referred to here showwhat problems of interpretation face us if we scrutinize them in detail. Clearlythe poets have done much to build up a large body of religious literature, andit is possible, as Phillpotts (1929), Holtsmark (1949) and more recently Haugen(1983) have suggested, that some of the poems were acted at assemblies orreligious festivals; the wooing of Gerd in Skírnismál and the account of thestealing of Idun have been suggested as possibilities. There are a number ofpoems in praise of Thor, but none on Odin or other gods has survived, althoughthe wisdom of Odin is extolled in some of the poems that make up Hávamál.However, before we attempt to draw conclusions from this kind of evidence,it is necessary to survey the material that has to do with the cults of the gods,in order to discover the part they played in the communities to which theirworshippers belonged."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"874The Cults of the NorthernGodsIt was the ancient custom when sacrifice was made, that all landowners shouldcome to the place where the sacrifice was to be, bringing with them theprovisions needed for as long as the feast should last. All people should haveale at the offering.(Heimskringla, Hákonar Saga goða 14) Evidence that needs to be kept separate from the recorded myths concerning thegods is that which has to do with the religious practices of the pre-Christiannorthern world, concerning the worship of the gods and cult rituals in which therulers, individual worshippers or the people in general took part. Various writtensources tell us something of such religious practices in the Viking Age, withoccasional glimpses further back in time, and such evidence must be joined withthat obtained from archaeology, artefacts and iconography to fill some of thegaps in our knowledge of the past. Since much of the literary evidence wasrecorded in Christian monasteries, we face the usual difficulties of possiblemisunderstandings and prejudice; we have to remember also that those genuinelyinterested in the religion of the old gods could have been influenced by what theyhad read of heathen deities in the Old Testament or in writers like Virgil. Forinstance, there is little archaeological evidence for elaborate temples in pre-Christian Scandinavia, and some literary descriptions may have, therefore, to bediscounted as unlikely to be based on genuine tradition. What are we to makeof Adam of Bremen’s description of the temple at Uppsala, written in the eleventhcentury? (O.Olsen 1966:116 ff.). His account of the figures of the gods there isof great interest, but a note added to the text (scholium 139) tells us: A golden chain goes round the temple. It hangs over the gable of thebuilding and sends its glitter far off to those who approach it, becausethe shrine stands on level ground with mountains all about it like anamphitheatre.(Jones 1968:327) Various attempts have been made to explain this chain. Was it taken from thebiblical account of Solomon’s temple (11 Chronicles 3:16; 1 Kings 7:17)? Or"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE88is the description based simply on gilded carving in wood running along theroof? In the Edda poems there are references to halls of the gods roofed withgold, and these might have been suggested by the gilded roofs of palaces inConstantinople, which greatly impressed Scandinavian visitors (Davidson1976:271); it is conceivable that such memories influenced the description ofthe Uppsala temple. Another possibility, suggested by Lindqvist (1923), wasthat the writer had seen a shrine for a reliquary with this type of decoration inthe church of St Erik in Westgotland. As for the reference to mountains(montes), these presumably were the great burial mounds that still stand nearthe medieval church at Gamle Uppsala, since there are no high hills around it.Such are the complications that can arise from a single descriptive passage,and in this case archaeology cannot offer much help. As Olsen pointed out, thetraces of an earlier building were limited to a few post-holes under the medievalchurch. From these Lindqvist built up the model exhibited in Swedishmuseums, but there were other different reconstructions. Lindqvist wasinfluenced by a detailed description of the temple of the Wends destroyed bythe Danes in the twelfth century, as described by Saxo Grammaticus in BookXVI. Of shrines and temples erected in the pre-Christian period in north-western Europe, we in fact know very little (p. 139). What further evidence,then, can be found regarding public worship in the pre-Christian period?COMMUNAL WORSHIPAmong the Celtic peoples, the druids are known to have been a well-organizedgroup, who acted as priests and possessed considerable power and influence.The Germans and Scandinavians appear to have been without any such highlytrained professionals, with the consequence that it was the king or chieftainwho usually made contact with the gods on behalf of the people at the sacrificialfeasts held at certain fixed points of the year. No doubt the time of such feastsvaried in different periods and in different regions, but there were certain timeswhen cooperation with the gods was felt to be especially necessary. The mostimportant of these was that marking the new year, celebrated at the end ofOctober, at the beginning of winter. This feast lasted over a number of days,and was known as the Winter Nights in Scandinavia, corresponding to the feastof Samain among the Celts. Like all periods of transition, it was a dangeroustime, when there was communication with the dead as well as with the gods,and meetings with supernatural beings might take place. Celts and Germansused the half-year as the basic unit in time-reckoning, beginning with winter,and the other important point in the year was the opening of summer at theend of April. Hallowe’en and the first of May have remained important for folkcustoms in the British Isles over the centuries. There was also a festival atmidwinter, originally in January, but tending to be identified with the Christmasfestival in Christian times, and another at midsummer; the Eve of St John theBaptist on 23 June is still celebrated with bonfires in Scandinavia."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"CULTS OF THE NORTHERN GODS89Snorri Sturluson in Ynglinga Saga 8 refers to three main sacrificial feasts inScandinavia: one at the beginning of winter when men sacrificed for plenty, oneat midwinter for the growth of crops, and one in summer for victory. In Irelandthere were two further feasts, on 1st February and 1st August, the formerprobably connected with the rearing of young animals and the latter with thefirst-fruits of harvest. Snorri’s reference to sacrifice for victory is important toremind us, however, that offerings to the gods were intended to bring not onlya blessing on crops and herds and the health of the land, but also good fortunein battle. The feast at the beginning of summer was important for the openingof the fishing season, and also for the setting-out of Viking expeditions and forcampaigns against other kingdoms, while at the same time traders might bestarting on long hazardous journeys in search of wealth.The essential element on such occasions was the feast, in which all took part,and this was a commensal meal shared with the gods. The brewing of the aleor mead was of particular importance, and this was hallowed to the gods beforethe feasting began. Sometimes drinking-horns were passed round the hall, likethe great aurochs horns included in the Sutton Hoo treasure (p. 20), whilesmaller horns have been found in many graves, recognizable from their metalfittings. In the fifth century in Denmark, feasters may have made use of thesplendid silver horns decorated with gold plates found at Gallehus (Figure 26),unfortunately stolen and melted down in the early nineteenth century; the littleFigure 26 Panels from the golden horn from Gallehus (afer Oxenstiern)."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE90scenes shown on them, including a possible horse sacrifice, could be associatedwith such festivals (Oxenstierna 1956). From Celtic areas there are manywonderful flagons and drinking-vessels of superb workmanship, some goingback to early periods, as well as cauldrons for holding liquid and great vesselslike the one from Vix (p. 14).The obligation to drink to the gods at such feasts may have influenced theChristian custom of drinking to Christ, the Virgin and various saints at themedieval guild-feasts in Scandinavia (Grønbech 1931:11, 146 ff.). In HákonarSaga goða 14 Snorri represents Jarl Sigurd drinking first to Odin for power andvictory, second to Njord and Freyr for peace and good seasons, and finally tothe memory of dead ancestors. As there was no king in Iceland, the goði, theleading man for each district, presided and drank to the gods, probably holdingthe feast in his own hall. The gods were honoured in a body at the feast,although the brewing of the drink was especially associated with Odin, and theanimal sacrificed might be the symbol of a particular god, as the boar waslinked with Freyr. Two tales from early continental sources indicate theimportance of the hallowing of the drink. In the seventh-century Life of StColumbanus (ed. Krusch, 1905:213), the saint came across a group ofAlamanni in Switzerland, clustered round a large vessel called a cupa, holdingabout 20 measures of beer, which they told him they were offering to Wodan.The saint rather unkindly blew upon the vessel, whereupon it shattered with aloud crash and the beer was lost. St Vedrastus performed a similar feat whenaccompanying the Frankish king Chlothar to a feast in the early days ofChristianity, where the festival ale had been divided into two portions, and oneleft unhallowed for Christians to drink. Vedrastus made the sign of the crossover the hallowed ale, and the vessel holding it burst asunder; we are told thatthis made a great impression on nonChristians, and many were converted(Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Scriptores Rerum Merovingicarum1896:III, 410).The other essential for the feast was an animal to be sacrificed. The meatmight be cooked in a cauldron or roasted over the fire, and the three animalssingled out in the literature as sacrifices are the boar, the bull and the stallion,all three fighting animals, appropriate offerings for warrior peoples. We findthem used for feasts in the Otherworld in both Norse and Irish literature. InGylfaginning 37 a boar is cooked each evening for Odin’s warriors to feastupon, yet is whole again the night after. The Celtic god Manannan had a supplyof pigs that could be devoured over and over again (O’Rahilly 1946:122), whilethe Dagda in the Second Battle of Mag Tuired possessed pigs ‘perpetually alive’so that the supply never gave out, together with a wonderful cauldron whosecontents never failed to satisfy all who came to the feast. Similarly, Thor couldraise his goats to life after they had been killed and eaten (p. 81) and in a numberof Irish legends St Patrick could restore a bull to life (MacNeill 1982:393). Itis possible that the widespread custom of placing food and drink and the vesselsand dishes for a meal in many graves of the pre-Christian period may have been"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"CULTS OF THE NORTHERN GODS91inspired by the symbolism of the Otherworld feast, and also by the idea of thefeast as a means of communication between the worlds.For the main sacrificial feasts, one outstanding animal seems to have beenselected as a suitable offering to the gods. The name given to the boar sacrifice inNorway was sónargoltr, which appears to mean ‘pig of the herd’, presumably theleader or prize boar. Accounts of famous boar-hunts in Welsh and Irish traditionmay have had some ritual significance. The killing of the aurochs, the great wildbull that roamed round northern Europe, was said by Julius Caesar (Gallic WarVI, 28) to have been a test of manhood among German youths, who had to trap itin a pit and then go down and kill it single-handed. In the case of the horse sacrifice,one way of selecting victims may have been by horse-races or horsefights, of whichwe read in saga literature. There is archaeological evidence for feasts held on theshores of a lake at Skedemosse on the Baltic Island of Öland, where offerings ofvarious kinds were thrown into the lake together with the bones of the slaughteredanimals. The name of this site is thought to come from skeið, meaning either ‘afight between stallions’ or ‘a horse-race’, and such contests could have taken placeon the long ridge near the lake, to decide which animals should be killed in theautumn (Hagberg 1967:70 ff.). The ritual importance of the horse fight isconfirmed by a carving of two men urging on their animals against one anotheron a stone from Häggeby in Sweden (Figure 27); it is dated from the Vendel periodand roughly contemporary with the finds at Skedemosse.Snorri gives an account of a horse sacrifice, the source of which is notknown, in Hákonar Saga goða 17. It was held in Hladir and the king came forthe sacrifice at the beginning of winter, and was expected to preside over it,although, having been brought up as a Christian in England, he was reluctantto do so. The horse-meat was cooked in a cauldron, and the king tried to satisfyFigure 27 Stone from Häggeby, Sweden, showing horse fight."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE92the people by opening his mouth over it as the steam rose, but this only causedresentment. At the next feast he consented to eat some of the liver: what seemsto be essential was to consume blood from the offering. After the conversion,Icelanders mocked at the pagan Swedes for licking their sacrificial bowls(Strömbäck 1975:79), apparently in their eagerness to consume the last vestigesof the blood of the sacrifice.Memories of the horse sacrifice might still have existed in Snorri’s time, butwhen we find an account of a sacrificial ritual recorded by Giraldus Cambrensisin the twelfth century as taking place in Ireland, it is difficult to know whatreliance to put on it. He had heard, he stated in his Topographia Hiberniae (3.25)(thus suggesting an oral rather than a written source), that one tribe in Irelandcelebrated the inauguration of a king by a shocking ceremony, whereby thechosen king acted the part of a stallion mating with a white mare in the presenceof all the people. The animal was then killed and the meat cooked in a cauldron,after which the king bathed in the broth and also drank from it, as well as eatingsome of the flesh. This account has aroused interest because of resemblances tothe Hindu rite of the ásvamedha, which is the subject of a hymn in the Rigvedawith a detailed liturgical commentary. This took place at the consecration of aking, and again a white horse, this time a stallion that had never been ridden,was sacrificed, after a year of running free. The chief queen lay down beside thedead stallion, and both were covered by a cloth. A choir of priests and womenthen described the sexual union between them in explicit terms. Finally, the horsewas roasted and offered to the god Prajapati; the animal appears to representthe universe (Campbell 1962:190 ff.). The traditional horse sacrifice can betraced back before the first millenium BC. It is hard, however, to accept that anysuch ceremony could have taken place at so late a date in Christian Ireland,although there may have been memories of it in local tradition. Again, thesacrifice is associated with a new king, and a bull sacrifice, the tairbfeis, was alsoconnected with this in one of the Irish sagas, Togail bruidne Da Derga(Destruction of Da Derga’s Hostel, Ganz 1981:65), when a man with secondsight is said to eat some of the flesh and drink the blood of a sacrificed bull, andthen dream of the future king. Strange rituals might have persisted in the selectionof a king after the regular feasts to the gods had long been forgotten.Possible memories of such feasts may also have survived in tales of ‘Hostels’,presided over by a supernatural host; these might possibly be memories of feastsin the Otherworld, as in Scandinavian tradition (Löffler 1983:114 ff.). Anothersignificant tradition is the arrangement for the carving and distribution of theboar at feasts, which is found in a number of tales. The most celebratedwarriors could lay claim to the choicest cuts, and according to Posidonius thiscustom went back to very early times among the continental Celts (Tierney1959–60:247). Men were prepared to fight to the death rather than be cheatedof their rightful portions, and lists indicating the correct distribution accordingto rank have survived in the written sources.An important feature of the sacrificial feast was that as well as being an"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"CULTS OF THE NORTHERN GODS93opportunity for sharing a meal with the gods it was an occasion for divination,as was also the feast at the inauguration of a king. The sacrifice was a time forlooking forward to the future, seeking omens for the prosperity of the kingdomwith the promise of rich harvests and victorious campaigns. The Scandinavianboar sacrifice was said to be associated with enquiry into the future (YnglingaSaga 18), while people might to some extent influence their own futures bymaking a solemn vow to achieve some great exploit, while laying a hand on thesacrificial boar. The idea that the annual feasts were opportunities for learningthe future of the kingdom or of individuals in the coming year has left traces inthe customs and games linked with Hallowe’en; but the main purpose was torenew the contract with the gods, so that the luck and prosperity of the land mightcontinue. Besides the feasting, there would be sports, racing, wrestling and manyother activities and contests, probably including story-telling and the recountingof myths about the gods. There is an account in the Fornmanna Sogur (VI, 99)of Harald Hardradi of Norway arranging for the telling of a saga to last out theYule feast, and such entertainment continued to form part of Christian festivals.Times of crisis, such as the death of a king, or the threat of enemy attack, wereoccasions demanding sacrifice. The period between the death of a ruler and theinstallation of his successor was like that of the new year, when the kingdom washeld to be particularly vulnerable. Another time for a public appeal to the godswas the annual opening of the Assembly in Scandinavia, so that law cases couldbe heard and decisions taken affecting the community as a whole. The gods weresaid in Voluspá to set up their own assembly, and were represented as supportingthose held on earth. To break up a hallowed court, as King Eirik Bloodaxe isrepresented as doing in Egils Saga 56, was felt to arouse divine anger. In this casethe king cut the ropes that enclosed the court before judgement had been given,and declared Egil an outlaw, but Egil retaliated by carving runes and setting upa horse’s head on a pole as a spell to bring down a curse on the king and his wife.Two verses are quoted at this point which may well be genuine early material(Almqvist 1965:90 ff.), and Egil mentions three of the gods, Odin, Freyr andNjord, and demands also that the land-spirits drive the king from his realm.The gods might also be called upon in various forms of oath, since thebreaking of a solemn contract aroused their anger, and would result in loss ofluck and perhaps of life itself. In Landnámabók (H, 268) the words of the oathtaken on the holy ring reddened with the blood of sacrifice are given, beginning:‘I make an oath on the ring, a law oath, so help me Freyr and Njord and theAlmight God...’. There have been various suggestions as to who the AlmightyGod might be, including Thor, Odin, and even Ull, who is associated with aring in the poetry; Thor seems most likely because of his close link with lawand order, but the expression might simply be due to Christian influence at thetime when the words were set down. The inclusion of Freyr and Njord in suchformulae was probably due to their close link with the land, since there seemsto be an assumption that the land itself was sullied by the breaking of an oath.The sacred ring, for which in Iceland the goði was responsible, is mentioned in"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE94a number of sagas, and in Eyrbyggja Saga 4 it is said to be kept in Thor’s temple,and called the altar-ring. It is described as without any join and about 20 eyrar inweight, which would make it a heavy arm-ring, about 550 g. In some later texts aweight of only 2 eyrar is given, suggesting a finger-ring, but Magoun (1949) arguedthat an arm-ring was more likely, pointing out that in Eyrbyggja Saga 44 Snorrigoði escaped a wound from a sword because he was wearing the ring on his arm.Confirmation of the taking of an oath on a ring is found in the Anglo-SaxonChronicle under the year AD 876, when the Danes made peace with Alfred ofWessex and ‘swore oaths to him on the holy ring’. The oath hallowed the wordsspoken, establishing them as the will of the gods. In Víga-Glúms Saga 25 the hero,a follower of Odin the deceiver, swore a misleading oath; the trick depended onuttering words that were not literally untrue but gave a false impression due to theemphasis of the speaker. His cunning, however, did not save Glum from the angerof Freyr, whom he offended by sheltering an outlaw in the god’s holy place.Outlawry, the most frequent punishment for a serious offence in the Viking Age,placed the condemned man outside the community of both his neighbours and thegods, and this too was confirmed by a religious form of words. What we learn ofthe worship of the gods as a group indicates that they were called on in all importantmatters concerning the community. The prosperity of the land depended on theright relationship between ruler and deities, so that the contract between humanand divine worlds remained unbroken. While there was no moral obligation, therehad to be faithfulness to a pledged word, and each side had certain claims on theother. There seems to be no sense of guilt, gloomy overtones, or required penance,although in the appeal to the gods of battle the position might possibly be different.In the regular feasts in honour of the gods the atmosphere was apparently one ofhospitality and enjoyment: everything that can be discovered about the celebrationsat Skedemosse in the period before the Viking Age, for instance, suggests that agood time was had by all, and that the torch-lit feasting and throwing of offeringsinto the water must have been a memorable experience (Hagberg 1967).No doubt there were also appeals to the gods of a more practical nature whenoccupied in the business of everyday, and we have one brief but valuable eye-witness account by an Arab writer and traveller, Ibn Fadlan, who visited theBulgarian capital on the Volga and watched the doings of some toughmerchantadventurers known as the Rus, assumed to be Swedish Vikings whocame down the river in their ships hoping for successful trading. The value ofthis account is that the writer was interested in the customs of foreign peoples,and had no particular reason to slant his description for purposes of propaganda.He tells us that at Bulgar in AD 921 these northerners set up a group of crudewooden figures, one upright piece of wood with a face like a man’s surroundedby smaller figures, and placed a number of long stakes in the ground behind them.A trader on his arrival would make offerings of bread, meat, leeks, silk and beerto the main figure, entreating him to let him obtain a good price for his wares. Ifall came about as he hoped, he returned to sacrifice sheep and cattle, leaving someof the flesh beside the figures and setting up the heads of the slaughtered beasts"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"CULTS OF THE NORTHERN GODS95on the stakes. If, however, things did not go well, he would turn to some of thesmaller figures and ask their help, and Ibn Fadlan was told that these were thesons and daughters of the god (Smyser 1965:97). We cannot tell who the mainfigure represented; it could have been Odin, since these were fighting mendependent on their swords. Among Odin’s powers as listed by Snorri in YnglingaSaga was that of gaining wealth for his followers, and since he was the Allfather,other deities could be called his children. Here we have an example of sacrificeby individual members of a group, in one of the few passages that afford a glimpseof how men away from home acted towards their gods in the Viking Age.CULTS OF THE BATTLE-GODSThere is no doubt that the warrior nations turned to their gods for support inbattle, and we learn from the literary sources of various practices used to obtainhelp from the gods and also to glorify them in warfare. What appears to be anearly religious practice among the Celts which impressed and shocked otherpeoples was that of collecting and preserving the heads of enemies slain inbattle. There is evidence for this in early literary sources, backed byarchaeological finds, particularly from the sanctuary of Entremont in southernFrance where skulls or severed heads were carved on pillars, and actual skullsfound in the sanctuary and sacred way; this sanctuary dates back to the thirdcentury BC and was destroyed by the Romans in AD 124. Some of the pillarshad a skull-shaped niche with a hook inside, on which it is thought actual skullswere suspended (Benoit 1975). Posidonius in the late second century BCdeclared that the Celts cut off the heads of those slain in battle and attachedthem to the necks of their horses, displaying them in triumph, while they alsoembalmed and carefully preserved the heads of their most distinguishedenemies (Tierney 1959–60:250). Here we have something distinct fromsacrifice: it might be viewed as a test of courage, like the overcoming of a fierceanimal in the wilds, or as the parade of a trophy, or as the acquisition of anobject bringing luck and power. However, the preserved heads at Entremontwere evidently linked in some way with the worship of the gods. Great statuesof seated figures in the sacred way held in one hand something resembling athunderbolt, while the other hand rested on a severed head. Livy in the thirdcentury BC (X, 26.11) stated that skulls might be decorated and used asdrinking-cups in temples, and it seems likely that the preserving andconsultation of severed heads was part of the cult of the gods.Certainly the practice was remembered vividly in the Irish sagas. Many heroesor their wives boast of heads brought back from battle, and when the great heroCú Chulainn slew a number of foes he piled up their heads and displayed themtogether with the weapons and armour he had won. It seems that such practicestook place in battle in the Roman period in Britain, for at Bredon Hill inGloucestershire, where an Iron Age camp was captured by the Romans, about50 headless skeletons were found, and some skulls appear to have been set up"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE96on a gate (Hencken 1938:21 ff.). The practice was not restricted to the Celts, sinceaccording to Herodotus it was well established among the Scythians in the fifthcentury BC, and he details in Book IV the gruesome methods used to preserveand decorate the skull of an enemy and to strip off the skin to fasten it to the bridleof the successful warrior’s horse. It seems that the Germans also preserved heads,although on a lesser scale. After the terrible defeat of the Romans at the TeutobergWood, Tacitus relates how human heads had been nailed to trees (Annals 1, 61),while heads were said to be collected by the Alamanni (Reinach 1913:44).One link with the cult of the gods might be found in the motif of the speakinghead, which is found in Scandinavian and English folk tradition as well as Irish.In the Yellow Book of Lecan there is the vivid account of the fate of the Irish story-teller and singer, Donn Bo. After he was killed in a battle along with his king,Fergal of Ulster, the victorious king sent a man to the battlefield to bring back ahead. He heard the voice of Donn Bo singing in honour of his lord, and took backthe head of the minstrel to the hall, where it was placed on a pillar, and sang sosweetly that the hearers were moved to tears. The head of King Fergal was alsotaken to the hall of another king, who treated it with much honour, washing itand combing the hair and putting a velvet cloth around it, while he offered sheepand pigs before it at the feast before it was taken back for burial. It is said thatthe head blushed with pleasure, and ‘opened its eyes to God to render thanks forthe respect and great honour which had been shown to it’ (Stokes 1903).Veneration of a head in a Christian context may also be seen in the honour paidto that of St Oswald and other early saints in Anglo-Saxon England. Theconsultation of a speaking head is linked with Odin in the tradition of his use ofthe head of Mimir (p. 78), said to be the guardian of the spring of knowledge,but Snorri’s account in Ynglinga Saga 4 leaves much unexplained.Both Celts and Germans were notorious for the cruel killing of captivestaken in warfare; the literary evidence suggests that the main motive behindsuch killings was to discover whether they would obtain victory. Posidoniusstates that the Celts observed the last convulsions of the dying and interpretedthe future from them, and according to Strabo the priestesses of the Cimbri cutthe throats of their prisoners to judge from the flow of blood what the resultof warfare would be (p. 16). Other prisoners were disembowelled, presumablywith the same end in view. Another reason given for the sacrifice of captives inthe written sources is as a thank-offering for victory, along with horses andbooty of various kinds, because a vow to this effect had been made to the godsbefore battle. Tacitus refers to such a sacrifice by the victorious Hermundariin the first century AD (Annals XIII, 57), and to confirm such statements wehave extensive finds of the weapons and armour of fighting men, together withhorses and sometimes human remains, in the peat bogs of Denmark andnorthern Germany (Hagberg 1967:79f.).We read too of the practice of drawing lots to decide which out of a number ofprisoners should be sacrificed, so that the choice might be made by the gods ratherthan by men. One particularly convincing tale of this kind is that of the escape from"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"CULTS OF THE NORTHERN GODS97death of a young officer of Julius Caesar, sent as an envoy to the German leaderAriovistus and treated as a prisoner of war (Gallic War I, 53). He would have beenput to death by burning immediately had the lots not gone against it, so that hewas held for a later occasion, but then the Romans attacked and he managed toescape and rejoin his own side. There are similar tales of some of the earlymissionaries escaping death. St Willibrord in Heligoland in the seventh century wasmade a prisoner with some of his companions after he had killed sacred cattle andbaptized converts in a sacred spring, and lots were consulted three times a day forthree days to decide which prisoners should be put to death; Willibrord escapedon each occasion, although one of the monks with him was killed (Talbot 1954:10).A letter of Sidonius in the fifth century (Dalton 1915:VIII, 6; II, 150) refers casuallyto the custom of Saxon pirates of offering every tenth man among their captivesto the god of the sea, when setting off for home after a successful raid. Sidonius,while deploring this, finds some excuse for them because it was the fulfilment of avow that they felt bound to carry out.There are many references to human sacrifice in classical and other writers whodescribe the customs of Germans and Celts, and some archaeological evidenceseems to confirm this. Nevertheless, the question is far from simple, and the partplayed by human sacrifice in the cults of the gods is not easy to define. It seems thatprisoners of war were sacrificed, and that human sacrifices also took place at timesof crisis. In 1922 von Amira claimed that the cruel methods of execution carriedout in the Middle Ages such as hanging, burning, drowning, burying alive and soon, were based on earlier sacrificial rites among the Germanic peoples, the methodchosen depending on the nature of the crime and the god to whom the sacrificewas made. In 1942 Ström pointed out the weaknesses in this theory, which hadbeen generally accepted by scholars. He argued that there was no evidence forhuman sacrifices on such a scale, and that the usual punishments for crime werefines and outlawry; moreover, the gods were not held to deliver moral judgementsand impose death for wrongdoing as claimed by von Amira. There has been debatealso over the significance of the large number of bodies found in the peat-bogs ofDenmark and northern Germany within the last century, some showing signs of aviolent death and with multiple injuries. It is possible that some of these could besacrificial victims, particularly if they are accompanied by animal bones and signsof burning (Struve 1967). Many, however, might be the result of murders or revengekilling, while if the injuries were inflicted after death they could be due to hatredor fear of the dead. The discoveries of recent burials of what might be sacrificialvictims at Sutton Hoo have forced us to reconsider the significance of sucharchaeological evidence (Davidson 1992a).Many references to human sacrifice are associated either with the practicesof the druids, who acted as priests, teachers and judges among the Celticpeoples of Gaul and Britain, or with the cult of Odin in Scandinavia. In bothcases there is a link with warfare, in which the druids and the followers of Odintook an active part. The conclusions of Le Roux and Guyonvarc’h (1982:78ff.) is that while druids performed sacrifices as part of their priestly function,"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE98human sacrifice was extremely rare, and we must be aware of the possibilityof exaggerations and errors on the part of classical and later writers. There isa general tendency both in the past and in our own time to assume that humansacrifice has taken place when there are other possible interpretations. Theelaborate theories put forward concerning the death of the young man foundin the peat at Lindow in Cheshire in 1984 is an example of how speculationmay be presented as scientific proof in such a way as to mislead the unwaryreader (Ross and Robins 1989).THE CULT OF ODINIt does not seem possible to see any of the northern gods as simply a god ofbattle, but the favourite deity of those devoted to the craft of fighting in theViking Age was unquestionably Odin. Those killed in battle were dedicated tohim, according to the literary sources, and the custom of flinging a spear overthe enemy at the outset of a battle with such words as ‘Odin take you alP isreasonably well attested. A spear is thrown in Eyrbyggja Saga 44 before anattack as ‘an ancient custom to bring good luck’, while an early Danishchronicle records one flung into the sea after Otto I had defeated HaraldBluetooth of Denmark (Paulsen 1967:120). In the poem Voluspá Odin is saidto have hurled his spear as the first act to bring war upon the world, giving apossible mythological basis for the custom. According to Saxo, who knewmany tales of Odin, the god promised immunity from wounds to HaraldWartooth of Denmark if he promised him all those whom he killed by the sword(VII, 247), and warrior leaders themselves are represented as regarding theirown deaths in battle or by torment as a sacrifice to the god.The spear symbol was evidently of importance for Odin’s cult, and inYnglinga Saga 9 Snorri states that Odin was marked with a spear when at thepoint of death and required that his followers should imitate him, an obviouscontradiction to the tradition that he was killed by the wolf at Ragnarok. Ifthere were such a popular custom among those of Odin’s worshippers who diedat home, this might explain the very large number of spears buried with fightingmen in Germanic cemeteries, some obviously fitted with difficulty into thegraves, because of their length. There are also a number of splendidlyornamented spears, some with runic inscriptions, found on the continent fromRoman to Merovingian times, and presumably of ritual importance. Thesymbol of a spear for a battle god may be very old, and was possibly linkedwith Tyr before it passed to Odin. When Odin hung on the World Tree as asacrifice to obtain wisdom, according to the often-quoted passage in Hávamál,he was said to be pierced by a spear, and this may have been one way by whichcaptives were despatched as sacrifices.The purpose of Odin’s self-sacrifice in the poem was to gain knowledge ofrunes and power to use them, and when sacrifice was used in divination, runesseem to have played a major part (Davidson 1988:153 ff.). The casting of lots"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"CULTS OF THE NORTHERN GODS99to decide which prisoners should die may also have been linked with runes, andaccording to the literature the runes had to be reddened with sacrificial bloodto be effective. The blood of the slain animal, known as hlaut, was consumedat the sacrificial feast, while some was also said to be kept in a bowl in thetemple, and sprinkled on the walls (Eyrbyggja Saga 4). The verb rjóða (‘toredden’) is frequently used in references to sacrifice in the poetry; in Hyndluljóðfor instance, a worshipper of Freyja is said to redden a sacrificial place untilits stones shone like glass. It seems that it was the blood of a slain creature thatmade a sacrifice effective and knowledge of the future possible.The cult of Odin included the knowledge of battle spells. A number of theseare listed in Hávamál, supposedly spoken by Odin himself, and again inSigrdrifumál, where they are said to be taught to the hero Sigurd by a valkyrie.One of the most important was the spell to free Odin’s followers from bonds,together with another to put bonds on the enemy. This is a reference tohelplessness and panic in battle, paralysing a fighting man so that he wasincapable of the right reaction to save himself from defeat and death. Weaponsare useless if the resolution to use them deserts the warrior, and in Hávamál148 Odin claims the power to bring this about: Should I have urgent need of shackles with which to fetter myadversaries, I can blunt the edges of hostile weapons, and neitherblades nor staves can harm me. A reckless confidence in battle was one of Odin’s gifts, of great value to theprofessional warrior and the leader who depended on his sword for survival.Among the various types of ecstasy that the god could grant to his worshipperswas the wild ecstasy of battle. The extreme form of this was shown by theberserks, utterly dedicated to the cult of Odin, who knew no fear when fightingand were impervious to the pain of wounds. The indications are that such mendressed in the skins of wolves or bears and belonged to special warrior societies,in which they remained for life, while young fighting men from leading familiesfor the most part served in the army for a while before settling down on theirestates (Davidson 1989a). Although in the sagas the berserk appears as a kindof ogre with supernatural powers to blunt weapons, such warriors evidentlyformed an essential part of the fighting force, much valued by the earlyScandinavian kings; in the tenth-century poem Hrafnsmál we are told how theywere prized by Harald Fairhair, as warriors ‘in which a wise ruler sets his trust’.Professional warriors of this type must have existed much earlier, since Tacitusin Germania 31 refers to men among the Chatti utterly dedicated to warfare,continuing in active service until too old to fight any longer.Such a warrior appears in the literature in the person of Starkad, of whom Saxotells us a good deal and who also plays a part in some of the legendary sagas. Hewas a ruthless, implacable figure, showing utter scorn for comfort, fine clothes,good food and drink or women, harsh and bitter in speech, and refusing even in"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE100old age to give way to wounds or weakness. Starkad is represented as a followerof Odin from his youth; it was said that the god trained him and even caused himto commit crimes such as the slaying of his king, actions that broke the normalheroic code of loyalties. On one occasion he conducted the sacrifice of a king toOdin, persuading the victim that it was to be mock sacrifice: the king was hangedand stabbed according to the rites of the god, so that the army could obtain afavourable wind. These traditions of Odin as a god of warriors were presumablypassed on to young men who were learning the art of warfare, and those speciallytrained in his service, and this has helped them to survive in the literature.The cult appears to have had a real impact on Scandinavian youth, since wehear accounts from outside sources, such as the Greek history of Leo theDeacon in the tenth century, of how the Vikings in battle would take their ownlives rather than yield to the enemy (Davidson 1972:24). Such an act meantthat they gave themselves to the god as an offering, and to die in this way wasrepresented as a privilege, giving entry to Valhalla to join the great heroes ofthe past. This may have been a popular conception rather than a clearly definedbelief put forward by religious teachers, and has no doubt been romanticizedby later poets and story-tellers, as in the death-song of Ragnar Lodbrok, oneof Odin’s heroes, with its flamboyant delight in a painful death: ‘Gladly shallI drink ale in the high-seat with the Æsir. My life-days are ended. I laugh as Idie’ (Krákumál, verse 25). The effect of such lore on young fighting men cannotbe doubted, however, and it must have been partly responsible for the vigorousimpact of the Viking forces on Europe.Odin’s cult in the Viking Age was not limited to warfare; it was closely linkedwith the power of the king and his contact with the gods, for the god was viewedas the ancestor of kings as well as famous warriors, like the Irish Lug with whomhe had much in common (p. 79). Neither Odin nor Lug can be viewed as aspecialized god of battle; rather, both were deities of varied aspects, whose cultswere peculiarly appropriate for warrior societies ruled by kings who were calledon to wage warfare in order to survive. Odin’s contacts with the world of thedead and journeys between the worlds may have been primarily associated withthis, but since so many kings and their followers died on the battlefield, the linkwith warfare received constant emphasis in both literature and art. Similarly,Odin’s powers of inspiration in the understanding of runes and the craft of poetsextend beyond the world of warriors, but came to be associated with it. The poetswho were also followers of Odin developed and communicated the imagery ofValhalla. We do not know how far a cult of Wodan among the Germans providedfor the needs of men and women outside the demands of warfare and the fortunesof the royal dynasties, but it seems clear that the power of the god increased asthe king became the central figure in the community. Both Odin and Lug werethemselves seen as rulers; Lug led the other gods to victory, while Odin ruledAsgard, in spite of the far-reaching powers of Thor and Freyr. As has been seen,there is little evidence for local shrines devoted to Odin’s worship (p. 57), andsuch centres as existed seem to have been associated with royal dynasties. It is"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"CULTS OF THE NORTHERN GODS101not surprising that we hear comparatively little of the god in Iceland, althoughthe appeal to him as the god of poetry by skalds like Egil Skallagrimsson keptthe heroic imagery alive, since poets were often fighting men as well as skilled inword-craft. As Snorri realized, it was scarcely possible for young Icelanders tounderstand their native poetry without considerable knowledge of Odin’s powersand mythical exploits.THE CULT OF THORWhile Odin was singled out for worship by kings and warrior leaders andfighting men on expeditions abroad, he was evidently of less importance forthose living on the land, depending on hunting, fishing and farming. Both Freyrand Thor, on the other hand, had worshippers among members of the localcommunity. Thor’s ring was used for the swearing of oaths, and he presidedover the Assembly, which opened on his day, Thursday, in Iceland, while hisimage apparently stood in the Assembly Place in Sweden, since Adam ofBremen (97, lxii) tells of a Christian missionary breaking it up with an axe andbeing killed by the angry crowd. Another symbol of the thunder god in forestcountries was the oak, although this would mean little to Icelanders. StBoniface cut down a great oak called the Oak of Jupiter in Hesse, which thepeople held in high regard (Robinson 1916:63), and Jupiter is usually equatedwith the thunder god on the continent (p. 47).Images of Thor are mentioned more often in the literature than those of othergods. Whether there was really a figure of the god in his wagon at Thrandheimwhich could be pulled along (Flateyjarbók I, 268:320) is doubtful, but the noiseof his wagon bringing thunder is emphasized in myths and poems, and this mayhave been acted out in ritual; Saxo refers to hammers in Thor’s temple in Swedenused to imitate the noise of thunder, removed by Magnus of Denmark in 1125 (XIII,5). The popularity of the hammer sign and the uses it was put to in the Viking Ageindicate the strength of the cult of Thor in Norway and Iceland (Figure 28). It wasused to mark boundary-stones, was raised over a new-born child as a mark of itsacceptance in the community, and according to the poem Thrymskviða wasbrought in at weddings to hallow the bride, and laid on her lap. It was also depictedon memorial stones for the dead, to whom Thor’s protection extended, while theconception of the hammer restoring the dead to life is found in the myth of Thorraising his goats to life after they had been killed and eaten (p. 81).Thor’s link with the home was indicated by the use of his image oncarved pillars in the hall on either side of the central seat, probably thosesupporting the roof. The pillars were clearly of symbolic importance, andare mentioned several times in Landnámabók and the sagas. It is possiblethat in Norway they were found in shrines of the god rather than in the hall.Settlers arriving in Iceland from Norway were said to bring them along andto throw them into the sea as they approached the coast; in one case this issaid to be so that Thor could determine where his home was to be"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE102(Eyrbyggja Saga 4), and the settler in question, Thorolf of Mostur, hadpreviously consulted Thor as to whether he should leave Norway forIceland. The phrase used in Eyrbyggja Saga for enquiry of the god is gekktil fréttar (‘went to enquire’), and comparison may be made with the Scotsdialect-word frete, meaning, according to Craigie’s Dictionary, ‘belief inomens, an omen, or a foreboding’. Thor as god of the sky, was evidentlyoften called upon when making a voyage; Helgi the Lean, who had beenbrought up a Christian, nevertheless ‘called upon Thor for seafaring anddifficult decisions, and matters he considered of greatest importance’(Landnámabók H, 184). Thorolf of Mostur, on the other hand, was whollydedicated to Thor, whom he called his ástvinr (his ‘beloved friend’). Whenhe had found the site for his house, he marked out the boundaries of his landwith fire—another rite presumably connected with Thor, who guardedboundaries and was associated with fire because of his power over thelightning. At the point where Thor had come ashore, the local place ofassembly was marked out, and this had to be kept holy and free frompollution by blood or excrement. When later there was an act of deliberatedesecration by Thorolf’s neighbours, and blood was shed in the fighting, afresh assembly-place had to be found, since ‘the field had been defiled byblood shed in enmity, so that now the earth was no holier there thanelsewhere’ (Eyrbyggja Saga 10). Thorolf also built a temple for Thor, inwhich were kept the sacred ring on which oaths were sworn and the bowlholding sacrificial blood. This saga was probably written at the Augustinianmonastery established at Helgafell in AD 1184 (Mabire 1971), whichFigure 28 Stone from Svenkista, Sweden, showing Thor’s axe-hammer (afterSimpson)."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"CULTS OF THE NORTHERN GODS103became one of the intellectual centres of western Iceland by the thirteenthcentury, and local tradition that it preserves regarding the early worship ofthe god seems likely to be reliable.Thor is the only god with poems surviving in his praise. Some of thesedescribe a picture of Thor’s exploits on a shield or a carving in a hall, and visualrepresentations of Thor were evidently popular: we have several examples onstones surviving from the Viking Age (p. 50). Some of these myths mayconceivably have been acted at festivals (p. 86). Tales of Thor in the laterliterature represent him as a loved and popular deity. In spite of the terrorevoked by his red beard and flashing eyes, which represented the power of thestorm, his huge appetite and quick way of dealing with troublesome adversariesendeared him to his worshippers, contrasting favourably with the wiliness ofOdin and the more dubious aspects of Freyr. Thor figures above all in theliterature as protector of gods and mankind, supporting law and order and thegood of the community more wholeheartedly than any other god.THE CULT OF FREYRThere are examples of men in the saga transferring their loyalty from Thor andOdin to Freyr, or forsaking Freyr for another god. There is a good example of thisin Víga-Glúms Saga, where Freyr in the end proves victorious. Holtsmark (1933)showed very convincingly that here the family of the hero, Glum, was originallydevoted to Freyr, owning a share in a field sacred to the god, which was expectedalways to bear a good crop. Glum’s father died while he was still a boy, and hismother was cheated of her rights by greedy relatives and neighbours; Glum thenwent to visit his grandfather in Norway, proved himself a successful fighting manby a contest with a bear, and returned home with a cloak and sword, which aresymbols of Odin. He killed one of the troublesome neighbours in the sacred fieldof Freyr, arousing the god’s hostility against him. In the end Glum had to forfeithis land, finding Odin no protector against the anger of Freyr, for all his successesas a warrior. This is an example of narrative writing, and no clear statements aremade about the change to the cult of Odin, but Holtsmark’s interpretation appearsto be a valid one, and the picture of Freyr’s hostility is clear. Those who looked onFreyr as a special protector were likely to be closely linked with the land orguardians of a sacred place under the rule of the deity, associated with his shrine,and the mention of a number of Icelanders bearing the title Freysgoði inLandnámabók indicates that they had some priestly connection with the cult ofthe god. In Sweden Freyr was worshipped by the royal family at Uppsala, who asindicated in Ynglinga Saga traced their descent from him, and the cult of Freyrseems to have spread from Sweden to Norway and then out to Iceland. There is areference in a late saga of Olaf Tryggvason to two wooden men, presumably imagesof the god, being taken from Freyr’s mound: one was kept in Sweden while theother was sent to Trondheim in Norway, where a cult centre existed in the tenthcentury (Flateyjarbók I, Óláfs Saga Tryggvasonar 323:403)."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE104A well-known character among these priests or leading worshippers of Freyrin Iceland was Ingimund, a man from western Norway who came out toIceland and settled in Vatnsdale in the east. According to Landnámabók (S.179), a silver amulet of Freyr that he kept in his pouch disappeared, and waslater found in Iceland, in the place where he came to live and where he built ashrine for the god (Davidson 1990:29). Ingimund’s grandfather was a jarl inGautland, not far from the centre of Freyr’s cult. Another Freysgði wasThorgrim Thorsteinsson, grandson of Thorolf of Mostur who was devoted toThor, and father of Snorri goði the main character in Eyrbyggja Saga.Thorgrim’s death is related in Gísla Saga, and it is said that after he was buriedFreyr kept his mound free from frost and snow, since ‘the god was unwillingto let frost come between them’ (18). His son Snorri, however, showed nointerest in the cult of Freyr, and became guardian of the temple of Thor thathis great-grandfather had set up at Helgafell. Another Freyr worshipper wasIngjald, who built the temple mentioned in Víga-Glúms Saga. He was the sonof Helgi the Lean, brought up as a Christian but said to put his main trust inThor (p. 102). The impression left by the two last examples is that worshippersof Freyr were individuals who broke away from the family tradition.The reference to Thorgrim’s mound is in keeping with the link betweenburial mounds and Freyr in Sweden, indicated in Ynglinga Saga 10, where itis said that offerings were brought to Freyr’s own mound after his death. Thereseems, indeed, a possibility that early Swedish kings were identified with Freyrafter death. Another characteristic of places sacred to Freyr in Sweden andNorway was that sacred horses were kept there. In a late tale in Flateyjarbók,Olaf Tryggvason is said to have ridden a stallion at Trondheim intended forsacrifice to Freyr, while he afterwards destroyed the wooden image of the god(Óláfs Saga Tryggvasonar I, 322:401). In Hrafnkels Saga there is an accountof a sacred horse belonging to the hero, which no one was permitted to rideon pain of death because it was dedicated to the god; the horse was namedFreyfaxi (Mane of Freyr). This picture of Freyr’s cult in iceland used to beaccepted as a genuine tradition from pre-Christian times, but Nordal in 1958gave convincing reasons for regarding it as a late fictitious saga. There is nofirm evidence for any Hrafnkel Freysgoði in this part of Iceland, or for thehistorical existence of other characters in the story. Here we have a goodexample of the difficulties in assessing the value of literary sources, for in thisbrilliant short saga careful efforts have been made to render the storyconvincing by the inclusion of local details and vague genealogies. The idea ofhorses dedicated to a god, which is undoubtedly ancient, may have been givennew interest by the account of the temple of the Wends at Ancona, destroyedby the Danish king Valdemar in AD 1169, which is given by Saxo Grammaticusin Book XIV of his history. Here sacred horses were used for divination, andthere is mention of a white horse that none might ride. The name ‘Freyfaxi’ mayhave come from the tradition of the horse in Vatnsdæla Saga belonging to thefamily of Ingimund, a known worshipper of Freyr. The horse-fights known to"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"CULTS OF THE NORTHERN GODS105be popular in Scandinavia may originally have been associated with Freyr’scult, and perhaps the horse sacrifice also, although in Víga-Glúms Saga an oxis the offering made to the god.It is tempting but perhaps time-wasting to pay too much serious attentionto the robust comic tale of Volsi in Óláfs Saga helga in Flateyjarbók (11, 265:33ff.). When an old farmhorse died, it was decided to use it for food ‘as do heathenmen’. A thrall cut off the horse’s male organ, here said to be called vingull bythe ancient poets. The mischievous son of the house ran indoors with it to shakeit at the women, with appropriate jests, and his sister told him to take thedisgusting thing away. However, the old mother dried it, wrapped it in linenand herbs and kept it until the autumn, when she brought it out for worship.Each in turn spoke a verse over it, addressing it as ‘Volsi’, and ending with thewords: ‘May Mornir receive this sacrifice (blæti)’. News of this reached St Olaf,and he came to the farm in disguise. When the usual ceremony took place andhe was given the Volsi, he spoke a verse, and then threw it to the farm dog.Much learned ingenuity has been expended on this tale, and it has beensuggested that the ‘Mornir’ were fertility goddesses, or that this was a name forSkadi, the wife of Njord (Ström 1954). A close parallel, however, has beenpointed out in the custom still known in the Faroes, called the ‘Drunnur’. Thetail-bone of an ox or sheep, decorated with ribbon, was passed round at awedding feast, and whoever received it had to compose a short verse in rhymingcouplets before delivering it to the next victim. The verse was usually an insultingone, full of sexual innuendo. Something similar went on at harvest feasts inScotland and Bavaria, and it seems that earlier the dried penis of an animal wasused as in the Icelandic tale (Coffey 1989). The Faroese word for the tail-pieceis drunn, apparently Celtic in origin. The passing round of an obvious phallicsymbol at weddings and harvests was therefore likely to have been a practiceknown to the story-teller and his audience, but the joke might lie in the link madebetween such ribald games, familiar to Christians, and the pagan gods, and wecannot assume that we have memories here of a formal pre-Christian ceremony.There are, however, various hints about disreputable practices associated withFreyr, such as Saxo’s reference to ‘womanish bodily movements, the clatter ofactors on the stage and the soft tinkling of bells’ at Uppsala (VI, 185), andChristians showed special disapproval of rites connected with the Vanir.In Ynglinga Saga Freyr is represented as a divine king, continuing to blesshis people from his mound. There are also Danish traditions of a king beingcarried round among his people after death, as was one of a series of rulerscalled Frodi in Saxo (V, 171); this name, which might be translated‘fruitfulness’, may be a title rather than a personal name. Freyr himself is calledinn fróZði in the poem Skírnismál. The Anglo-Saxons had a memory of Ingand his wagon, mentioned in the Runic Poem, and this name too is associatedwith Freyr, sometimes called Ingi-Freyr. One of the difficulties in understandingthe cult of the Vanir deities, Freyr and Freyja, is the variety of names underwhich both seem to have been remembered. A ceremony connected with Freyr"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE106in the literature is the bringing of the god’s image in a wagon to bless the landin the spring. There is a celebrated account of such a ritual for a goddess inTacitus (Germania 40), said to take place in Denmark in the first century AD(p. 133). In Flateyjarbók (Óláfs Saga Tryggvasonar I, 277:337 ff.) we haveanother comic tale in which Freyr’s image is similarly taken round the farmsin Sweden, in a wagon drawn by oxen, attended by a young woman called hiswife. The humour depends on a young Norwegian taking the place of Freyr’simage, deceiving the simple-minded Swedes and delighting them by being ableto eat and drink at their feasts, and finally getting his wife pregnant. Evidentlysuch journeys of the god were known to go on in Sweden, and are mocked athere by the Christian story-teller. Another brief reference to a god in a wagonwho may be Freyr is found in Flateyjarbók (Óláfs Saga Tryggvasonar I,467:579), where the wagon of Lytir (otherwise unknown) is used fordivination, and said to become heavy when the god is within. It was drawn tothe royal hall, and the king put questions to Lytir. Such journeys may be seenas divination ceremonies, when omens were observed to discover if the harvestwould be good, or questions put concerning the future of the kingdom or ofindividuals in the coming season.Freyr, god of the land, could be evoked by the Swedes as a god of battle also,since his emblem, the boar, was set on shields and helmets and was a favouritesymbol for warriors. He is called in poetry ‘ruler of the hosts of the gods’(Skírnismál), while battle is called ‘sport of Freyr’ in a poem quoted inHeimskringla (Haralds Saga Hárfagra 15). The early kings of Uppsala weresaid to possess great helmets as battle treasures, bearing names like Hildisvin(Swine of Battle), and some helmets pictured on helmet plates from the Vendelgraves (Stolpe and Arne 1927) appear almost like boar-masks. It is conceivablethat the king put on such a helmet in order to be possessed by the god, and itmay be noted that in one of the Edda poems, Hyndluljóð, a young prince whoworshipped Freyja was disguised as her boar when he went down to theunderworld to learn about his ancestry. The world of battle was closely linkedto that of death, and Freyr is connected with both these worlds, as was Odin.Odin, Thor and Freyr are the only three gods who emerge from the writtensources as actively worshipped in the Viking Age. A number of others arementioned in the literature, but no definite information is known about theircults. This applies to such familiar names as Loki, Njord, Tyr, Balder, Heimdall,Mimir, Ull, and the mysterious twin deities mentioned by Tacitus known as theAlcis. Many theories have been put forward as to the significance andimportance of these various deities in the periods before the Viking Age, buthere we are confined to conjecture and speculation. However, there is somedefinite information in the literature concerning the worship of the goddesses,and this will be discussed in the following chapter."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"1075Goddesses and GuardianSpiritsFreyja kept up the sacrificing, for she alone lived on after the gods.(Ynglinga Saga 10) It would be a mistake to neglect the goddesses in this survey, since there is goodreason to believe that their cults were important in everyday life, and were byno means confined to women and children. They were of considerableimportance also among the Celtic peoples—even though we have little evidenceas to how they were worshipped—for traces of powerful female divinities maybe found in many Irish tales. One reason for our limited knowledge is no doubtbecause most of our records were written by men, and usually by monks, whowould be unlikely to know much of the lore and practices of mothers, wives andunmarried girls who turned to the female deities to help them to achieve a goodmarriage or to give them healthy children; nor were they likely to give suchmatters their approval. Christian writers tended to condemn fertility rites, suchas were usually associated with the female deities. Moreover, confusion is causedby the practice of giving many different names to one goddess, so that it is oftenassumed that these are separate divinities. It seems also that the goddesses wereoften worshipped in small local cults rather than in established public rituals likethose of Thor or Odin. Sometimes they were represented as a group, receivingworship in Scandinavia as the Dísir, while the norns, valkyries and various femalespirits of the Vanir are often introduced as groups of beings in the tales. In Irelandthere is often a trio of goddesses under one name, as in the case of the Irish Brigid.Again, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between goddesses and giantesses;a goddess might be conceived as huge or even monstrous in stature, while agiantess from the underworld might become the bride of a god.The importance of the goddesses is indicated by their frequent appearanceon carved stones of the Roman period in both Germanic and Celtic regions,and it may be noted that many of these stones were raised by men, includingindividuals of importance in the Roman army. Some outstanding female deitieshave already been mentioned in earlier chapters. There is the Germanic goddessNehalennia depicted on many carved stones recovered from the North Seacoast in Holland (p. 49) and the Celtic goddesses Epona and Rosmerta, popular"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE108both in Britain and on the Continent (p. 46). The inscription to Sulis Minervaat Bath shows that the temple there was dedicated to a Roman goddessidentified with Minerva, who must have been associated with a sacred spring(p. 129). Many goddesses, such as Coventina, guardian of the spring nearCarrawburgh on Hadrian’s Wall (p. 131), and Sequana, the deity worshippedat the source of the Seine, were of sufficient importance for their worship tobe taken up by the Roman officials so that their names have survived. Thereason for this seems often to be the healing properties of a spring over whichthe goddess presided, but many of these enigmatic figures had evidently otherpowers to do with fertility and divination.THE CULT OF THE GREAT GODDESSClearly there was a multiplicity of local goddesses, but the literary sources also tendto give the impression of one supreme and powerful goddess, who might beregarded as wife or mistress of her worshipper. If he were a king, her cult wouldbecome part of the state religion, and she would receive official worship along withthe leading gods. In Scandinavian tradition the main goddess appears to be Freyja,sister and perhaps also bride of Freyr; the names of these two Vanir deities are reallytitles, meaning ‘Lord’ and ‘Lady’, and Snorri tells us that Freyja had many othernames. There is also the goddess Frigg, wife of Odin and therefore Queen ofHeaven, who figures in the myths as the weeping mother, lamenting the fall of herson Balder and later that of Odin, her ‘second woe’, as Voluspá expresses it. It seemsas if these two figures with similar names may indeed be two aspects of the samedeity. Sometimes it is Freyja who is paired off with Odin in the tales, and she too isrepresented as a weeping goddess, shedding tears of gold; her tears serve as afavourite poetic symbol for gold in the kennings. Why Freyja weeps is notaltogether clear; she is said to be searching for her husband, of whom we knownothing, but since he is called Óðr he may be a doublet of Odin.Other possible representations of the main goddess under different names areIdun, the guardian of the golden apples of youth (p. 72), Gerd, the radiant maidof the underworld who meets Freyr as his bride in the poem Skírnismál (p. 71),and Gefion in Danish tradition, who according to Ynglinga Saga 5 ploughed theisland of Zealand out of the land of Sweden, leaving a large lake behind.Additional names given by Snorri to Freyja are Mardoll, suggesting a link withthe sea; Horn, thought to be related to horr, ‘flax’; Gefn, which like Gefion isrelated to the verb ‘to give’; and Sýr, ‘Sow’. All these names are relevant for theunderstanding of her cult, for she was connected with water and the sea, and flaxwas an important crop for which her blessing was sought; she was regarded as agiving goddess, bringing bounty to the fields, animals and mankind, while thesow was the female counterpart of Freyr’s symbol, the golden boar.There are various myths in which the gods strive to protect Freyja or rescueher from the giants who long to possess her; she is represented as the desiredone, universal lover of gods and men. Her love-dealings with various gods are"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"GODDESSES AND GUARDIAN SPIRITS109referred to in outspoken language in the poem Lokasenna, where Loki accusesher of accepting most of the gods as her lovers. In Irish literature we haveparallels in figures like Medb, the queen of Connacht, with her constant streamof lovers, who shows no hesitation in granting her favours to any handsomehero who will give her help when needed (Bower 1975). Freyja takes her loverOttar, who is of royal lineage, down into the underworld in the poemHyndluljóð so that he may learn his ancestry; this is one of the occasions whereshe might be seen as a supernatural bride of the ruler of a kingdom. She hadalso dominion over the dead, and was said in Grímnismál 14 to possess halfthe slain while half passed to Odin. There is some indication that women werewelcomed by Freyja after death, possibly after a sacrificial death; in Egils Saga78 a woman who was proposing to commit suicide declared that she wouldeat nothing more until she came to sup with Freyja. It is possible that while inthe figure of Frigg we see the great goddess ruling in the heavens, looking downwith Wodan upon earth or sharing Odin’s high seat (p. 79), in Freyja we seerather the goddess as queen of the underworld, at home in the land of the dead.Freyja is represented as possessing a famous necklace, Brisingamen, if indeed itis a necklace and not, as some have claimed, a girdle or an amulet of some kind.One early skaldic poem refers to Loki and Heimdall fighting over this in the formof seals, so that evidently one of the exploits of Loki the arch-thief was to steal it;he does this again in one of the late legendary sagas, Sorla þáttr. A necklace is asymbol associated with the goddess from the earliest times of which we have record(Gimbutas 1982:44), so there are probably valid reasons for retaining it; theunderworld maiden won by the hero in a late poem Svipdagsmál is called Mengloð,‘Necklace-glad’, which may be another of Freyja’s many names. Hoever, themeaning of the name Brisingamen (?necklace of the Brisings) and its possible linkwith a splendid neck-ornament in Beowulf (1199) called ‘necklace of the Brosings’remains an unsolved problem. Another precious possession of Freyja was her‘feather-form’, which enabled her to fly as a bird; this she lent to Loki inThrymskviða so that he could fly to the land of the giants, and again, according toSnorri, when he went to rescue Idun. Frigg apparently possessed a similar bird-form, since in an early kenning she is called ‘mistress of the hawk’s plumage’(Skáldskaparmál 1, 18). The link between birds and goddesses is strong in bothScandinavian and Celtic tradition, and seems to go back to early times, judgingfrom the importance of the bird symbol in Celtic art. Again, Freyja is associatedwith precious metals; her tears are of gold, and she is a giving goddess, bringingprosperity and riches like her brother Freyr and her father Njord.However, we hear little of rich goddess-images in temples in Norway orIceland. The only goddess figure described as richly adorned in a shrine is thatworshipped by Jarl Hakon of Halogaland in the late tenth century. The jarl wasfor some years virtually king of Norway, and was a determined opponent ofChristianity, finally overthrown by Olaf Tryggvason. In a number of tales he issaid to have worshipped Thorgerd, called Holgabrúðr (presumably ‘Bride ofHelgi’); he showed her great devotion, and she was known as his wife. In the Saga"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE110of Olaf Tryggvason in Flateyjarbók (I, 326:408), Olaf is said to take Thorgerd’simage from the temple at Trondheim, strip it of its fine robe and gold and silveradornments, drag it along at his horse’s tail and finally break it up and burn italong with the image of Freyr. The title ‘Bride of Helgi’ might be accounted forif Helgi were the mythical founder of the kingdom of Halogaland; the goddesscould be seen as his wife, who became the bride of his various successors in turn.When he destroyed her image, Olaf declared that now she had lost Hakon, herhusband, ‘who was very dear to her’, and added that the chiefs of the land hadbeen loyal to her in turn, and had given her high praise.Although such accounts are late, they are consistent in stressing Hakon’sdevotion to the goddess, and there is one earlier reference of the tenth centuryin a poem of Tine Hallkelsson which refers to Hakon in the arms of Gerd. Theaccount of Hakon offering up his young son Erling, ‘by such rites as werecustomary’ (Flateryjarbók, Óláfs Saga Tryggvasonar 1, 154:191) soundssuspiciously like propaganda against the pagan jarl, but other tales are moresympathetic. Particularly impressive is the description of Thorgerd with hersister Irpa sending down a terrific hailstorm against the jarl’s enemies, who sawThorgerd as a monstrous being shooting arrows with great skill and rapidity.After a second hailstorm, the two goddesses appeared again on Hakon’s ship,like the huge trollwomen said to be seen in dreams by men who took part inthe Battle of Stamford Bridge (Davidson 1988:95). Dream imagery of this kindfrom the Icelandic sagas can provide valuable evidence for pre-Christiantraditions; evidently it raised no objections from Christian writers as long asit was presented in dream-form.In another tale of Thorgerd (Flateyjarbók I, 114), Sigmund from the Faroesvisited Hakon, and was taken by the jarl to a shrine in the woods surroundedby a fence with gilded carving, holding images of the gods. Among the figureswas one of a woman splendidly adorned, sitting on a bench, and Hakon threwhimself on the ground before her, remaining like this for a long while. He thentold Sigmund that they must make her an offering, and put down some silver;if she accepted it, he said, the ring on her finger would become loose. However,he failed to get it from her hand, whereupon he threw himself down again andwept; then he tried again, and was able to remove the ring. This he gave toSigmund, in return for a promise never to part with it. Here no prejudice againstThorgerd enters into the narrative, and it is possible that in such tales we catcha rare glimpse of the cult of the northern goddess seen as the wife of the ruler.The name ‘Thorgerd’, rather than ‘Gerd’, which is used in the early poem,may be due to confusion with one of Hakon’s many wives. She was an historicalcharacter called Thora, daughter of Skagi Skoptason, and bore Hakon threechildren (N.K.Chadwick 1950). Gerd is one of the possible names for thegoddess, used in Skírnismál. The vivid and haunting tale of Hakon’s end givenin Heimskritigla, when he was hidden in a pit in the earth, and a herd of swinedriven over it to conceal him, might be a misunderstanding of some referenceto Gerd, and to the boar or sow that was the emblem of the Vanir deities. The"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"GODDESSES AND GUARDIAN SPIRITS111picture of Thorgerd with her bow is less suggestive of Freyja, but she may havehad some link with a goddess of the Saami, the Lapp peoples, in Halogaland,with whom Hakon was in close contact (Davidson 1990). No doubt thedominant goddess with her many names varied in character according to thebackground against which her worship took place in different regions ofScandinavia.It has been claimed that the cult of the Great Goddess was a powerful andimportant one in Scandinavia, and that the later cult of Odin in the Viking Agetook over some of its ritual and symbolism (Ström 1954). However, theevidence we possess hardly justifies such sweeping assumptions. It is vague andsuggestive merely: for instance, a series of verses on the early kings in the poemYnglingatal, composed in the tenth century by Thjodolf of Hvin, tells how anumber of Swedish kings met their deaths by drowning, burning or hanging,brought about by their wives. Such ‘wives’ could be references to the goddessviewed as wife of each king in turn, and when Snorri used the poem in YnglingaSaga, he may have rationalized a record of sacrificial deaths. Here we are inthe realm of speculation, since the verses are puzzling and obscure. It can onlybe said that a strong tradition of the goddess as the wife of the reigning kingsurvives in Scandinavian literature, and that this is related to the last paganruler of Norway, Jarl Hakon, at the end of the tenth century.This offers an interesting comparison with the territorial goddess in Irishtradition, who in the early literature is described as proffering a cup to the mandestined to be king (MacCana 1955–8). In Irish literature we have the kingappearing as a representation of human society, and the goddess as the divinepower manifested in nature (McCone 1990:129 ff.). McCone points out thatsuch an image of divine power in the natural world has biblical parallels andcould therefore be accepted and developed by Christian monastic writers. Asimilar development of the ideals of kingship may be seen in the work of SaxoGrammaticus in the late twelfth century, when he uses native tales and poemsin which protective guardian spirits assist princes to attain sovereignty; this isto support current theories concerning the virtues and vices of kings in his owntime (Johanneson 1981). Here again, then, it is necessary to bear in mind thedifficulties in attempting to reconstruct the thought-patterns of an early religionfrom the works of sophisticated writers of medieval Christian times.Some of the evidence from early Irish literature, taken into considerationtogether with popular tradition, shows memories of beliefs in a major goddess.In a detailed study of legends about Cailleach Bearra or ‘Hag of Beare’, ÓCrualaoich (1988) suggests that on one level she appears to represent a versionof ‘a Mother Goddess emanating from the worlds of Indo-European and evenold European cosmology’. She is linked with the image of a female guardianof the wild and also with that of the Sovereign Queen, and these two aspectsare recognizable in the ninth-century ‘Lament of the Old Woman of Beare’(Murphy 1953). 6 Crualaoich suggests that there may be Norse influencesbehind her associations with wild nature, while other important links are with"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE112the cow, and with reaping contests in harvest time. In the ‘Lament’, the Hag isidentified with an elderly Christian nun, looking back on a glamorous past asthe bride of kings; this is strengthened by the use of the word caille for a nun’sveil. The Hag is linked with the Beare peninsula in south-west Ireland, butWagner (1981) has suggested that earlier names given to her might be derivedfrom titles of the Magna Mater from much earlier times.Another side of the Cailleach Bearra is that of a Hag of war and death, andshe shares such characteristics with various war-goddesses of Irish tradition(Ross 1973:155 ff.). Legends concerning her are by no means confined to onepart of Ireland, and are also known in Scotland. In some of these she can berepresented as Creator and Shaper of the landscape, suggesting the figure ofDivine Mother. She is said to have taught the people how to thresh corn, andto have put to death a number of men who could not overcome her in a reapingcontest. Similarly, the Irish goddess Ána/Aine is said to have been overcomeby Lug in a harvestcontest. Such scattered but valuable evidence for a powerfulcreator goddess emerges when brief glimpses of such a figure in the literatureare studied in the light of local legends.Another powerful Celtic goddess who was more than a local deity andpossessed far-ranging powers is indicated by the rich traditions associated withthe Irish Brigid. Here we have a good example of a former deity transformedvery successfully into a popular and revered Christian saint. It has been thoughtthat the Minerva mentioned by Julius Caesar as the chief goddess in Gaul whoinspired craftsmanship (Gallic War VI, 17) might be the same goddess, knownas Brigantia to the Romans, who gave her name to the Brigantes, a tribe thatcame originally from central Europe (Joliffe 1941:37 ff.). A third-centuryinscription on Hadrian’s Wall identifies Brigantia with Dea Caelistis, thusexalting her to the highest rank of divinity. The Romans also saw Brigantia asa goddess of victory and with powers of healing. Joliffe suggested that theRomans deliberately promoted Brigantia into a major deity for politicalreasons, but the wide-ranging powers of Brigid were echoed in the cult of thesaint. In Cormac’s Glossary Brigid had two sisters of the same name, daughtersof the Dagda, one of whom specialized in healing and one in the craft of thesmith. She was associated with such crafts as dyeing, weaving and the brewingof ale, and with the welfare of flocks and herds, as well as with the art of poetry,and with traditional learning, divination and prophecy, so that her powersextended into many aspects of the life of the community.The Christian Brigid was said to have been the Abbess of Kildare, andreferences to her go back to the seventh century. She had the power to increasethe milk-yield and to help with butter-making, to change water to ale and stoneto salt, and was called ‘the All-Giving’. She was fed by a cow which seems tobe a creature of the Otherworld, and her festival was on 1st February, theancient spring festival associated with the rearing of young animals (p. 89).There is, however, no firm evidence for the Abbess as an historical figure (ÓCathasáigh 1982:82 ff.). There seems good reason to believe that here we have"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"GODDESSES AND GUARDIAN SPIRITS113scattered traces of a once-powerful goddess, whose cult was important for thecommunity as a whole.THE LOCAL GODDESSESNevertheless, the goddess figure is not really an isolated one; Snorri in the ProseEdda is certainly under the impression that there was a large company of femaledeities. In reply to the query as to who were the gods, the High One gave thenumber as twelve, and his companion added: ‘No less holy are the goddesses(ásynjurnar) nor are their powers less’ (Gylfaginning 19). There are referencesto worship of the Dísir, another word for female deities generally used in theplural, although día is occasionally used of a single goddess such as Freyja orSkadi. It is said that sacrifices were offered in the hall of the Dísir at Uppsala,and there are also references to feasts in their honour in the autumn taking placein Norway, as in Víga-Glúms Saga 6 and Egils Saga 44. The former of thesewas held in the hall of the hero’s grandfather in western Norway, and the latteron one of the king’s estates, attended by Eirik Bloodaxe and his queen. It is notclear whether this was a feast held separately from that of the gods, since itseems to have taken place at the same time of year, in the period of the WinterNights (p. 88). It is generally assumed that the Dísir were family guardianspirits, closely associated with particular localities, to whom sacrifices weremade for the luck and fertility of the land and those owning it, and thus at thehighest level connected with the royal dynasty.They may therefore be linked with the group of supernatural beings knownas land-spirits, who were closely connected with the land itself. Someinteresting traditions have survived in Landnámabók about help given to earlysettlers in Iceland who made a voluntary contract with such local spirits(Davidson 1988:103 ff.). A number of these were female, and traditions surviveup to recent times of stones in Iceland sacred to the land-dísir which had to beleft undisturbed, so that the grass remained uncut round them, and childrenwere forbidden to play games close by, in case the protective spirits wereoffended (Turville-Petre 1963). A number of places in Norway and Swedenwere also named after the Dísir (de Vries 1957–8:11, 298). The land-spirits,male and female, were said to promote the increase of livestock and maintainthe prosperity of the farms, as well as giving good luck in hunting and fishing,and bringing helpful counsel in dreams.Memories of such figures may be found in traditions of female supernaturalbeings in Sweden, such as the sjörå and the skogsrå (Lindow 1978:39), the firstassociated with lakes and rivers, and the second with forests. In Irish literaturethere is also evidence of female guardian spirits who were connected withcertain families. In her study of the Irish Banshee, the death-messenger, Lysaghtcame to the conclusion that such a spirit was associated with families of earlyorigin (Lysaght 1986:53 ff.). Parallels can be found in the Scottish Highlands,where, as in Sweden, there are legends of supernatural women who looked after"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE114both the animals on the farm and the wild creatures in the forests and hills. Onename for such a being is Glaistig, and they were closely linked with particularplaces. The Glaistig of Glen Duror, for instance, protected cows, while theMaiden of Callart guarded the deer on the hills. She once gave a wonderful dogto an old hunter, whose own dog was growing old and could no longer run fast,and she promised that the hound would never fail to run down any four-footedcreature that he pursued. When his master died, the dog disappeared into a cavein the rocks and was never seen again (MacDougall 1978:53 ff.). Twomountains called the Maidens were said to be named by him after the twosupernatural women who appeared to the hunter. It seems that the protectivespirit, like Jarl Hakon’s Thorgerd, had a ‘sister’ with her when she appeared,although only one of the pair offers a gift.The family guardian spirit, who brought prosperity to the land but was alsoconcerned to protect the women and children of the family and ensure thesuccession, is also found in the Scottish Highlands. One instance is the Fairy Wifeof Clan MacLeod, said to have given lan Keir, the Chief who died in 1390, the FairyBanner still to be seen in Dunvegan Castle, promising to protect the Clan as longas it remained in the family’s possession. A story is told of how she was once seennursing the baby who was the heir, and wrapping him in the banner, when his nursehad left him alone, while she sang a lullaby still preserved in the family (MacGregor1937:20 ff.). She also gave a chanter to lain Og MacCrimmon, a young man whoafterwards became the hereditary piper to the Chief (MacGregor 1937:34 ff.).There are many other examples of tales of this type, such as that of the spirit NicGilmichael, a maiden attached to the Campbells of Glen-Faochan, who lookedafter the servants and punished them if they neglected their work. When the estatewas sold, it was said that at night she could be heard lamenting among the treesaround the house (MacDougall 1978:47).The giving of a hunting dog to an unnamed ‘gentleman’ in the story fromCallart recalls various instances of gifts of animals from the land-spirits inIceland. In one case the gift of a goat resulted in the increase of the farmer’s herd(Davidson 1988:103). Just as the dog vanished into a hill when his master died,so a flock of sheep that prospered through help from a land-spirit plunged intoa waterfall on the death of the farmer (Davidson 1989b:107). Similarly, thereare stories from Wales about women who come out of a lake bringing wonderfulcattle with them, become the wives of farmers, and then return taking the animalswith them when the husband does not keep his side of the contract. The mostfamous of these is the tale of the Lady of Llyn y Fan Fach, a mountain lake nearLlandeusant (Rhys 1901:1, 2 ff.). The widespread distribution of such legendsis a testimony to the established belief in a local female spirit of land or water,who might be viewed as a local goddess (Wood 1992). Such figures in the talesoften possess a dual nature; they can be benevolent and generous, showing greatloyalty to the families to which they are attached and saving individuals,including the children of the house, from danger; but if angered or humiliatedthey may prove dangerous and formidable powers."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"GODDESSES AND GUARDIAN SPIRITS115There seems good reason to believe that such beliefs among the country peoplein both Celtic and Germanic areas went on for many centuries, and they give someidea of the part played by local goddesses in the community in the period beforeChristianity. Here we are left with a host of legends, to which one can hardly givethe name of ‘myth’, but which were passed on in local tradition, surviving becausethey were often associated with natural features such as lakes, springs andmountains. The many representations of the Mothers on stones of the Romanperiod suggest a similar attitude to female protective spirits of this kind (p. 48).Another group of minor goddesses may be seen in figures associated with boththe plough and the spinning-wheel in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. JakobGrimm had noted them as possible memories of pre-Christian goddesses (Grimm1883:265 ff.), and Waschnitius published a rich collection of such traditions in1913. They bore names such as Holde, Frau Holle, Perht and Berta, spelt invarious ways in different regions, or less frequently, Frau Gode, St Lucia andother names. Some of these might be titles: Holde seems to come from anadjective meaning ‘merciful’, ‘benign’, and Perht and Berta from one meaning‘bright’ or ‘glorious’. Holde and Perht were closely associated with spinning, andlegends about them circulated in the spinning-room where women and girlsworked. They approved of good spinners, but punished those who were lazy andslovenly, setting fire to their distaffs or tangling and breaking their thread(Waschnitius 1913:20, 33, 56, 65, 89 etc.). They were also angered if anyoneworked at her wheel at forbidden times, such as the days between Christmas Eveand Twelfth Night, or on Saturday evening, Sunday or the evenings of variousfestivals, while spinning at night was also prohibited. In extreme cases they weresaid to cut open the stomachs of offending ones and put in chopped straw, orsweepings from the floor. Naughty children who did not eat up their food mightbe threatened with similar treatment, or told that Perht would stamp on themin the night, or Frau Holle would carry them off in her sack.However, in spite of such sinister threats, they were evidently regarded asthe guardians of children. There were legends in some families that Birta as aWhite Lady would rock the cradle when the nurse fell asleep, and that FrauHolle would draw children to her pond and reward good ones generously. Theyalso helped young women and brides: Frau Berta in the Tyrol would visit them,give them thread and yarn and help them with their spinning, while inThuringia Frau Holle, appearing as a grey-haired woman with long teeth,might leave a gift by the distaff, or bring children presents in her wagon on NewYear’s Eve. They might also be present when a bride’s chest was taken to hernew home, while young women who bathed in Frau Holle’s pool hoped tobecome healthy and fertile wives.There is also mention of such women driving wagons, and of those whohelped them when the wagon broke down being rewarded by chips of woodwhich turned into gold (Motz 1984). They were also said to travel with aplough, attended by a troop of tiny children. Sometimes these are said to bethe spirits of those who died unbaptized, or infants who had been carried away"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE116leaving changelings in their place, but it seems possible that at one time theywere thought to be the souls of the unborn, since in some districts babies weresaid to come from Frau Holle’s house, or from her pool. The association withthe plough is interesting in view of later Plough Monday ceremonies, since theperiod associated with these female spirits extended to about 6 January. Motz(1984) has argued that these various beings represented an earlier Germanicwinter goddess, but this hardly seems to be borne out by the evidenceWaschnitius collected, and spinning is not confined to winter. However, theycertainly visited homes at Christmas, when tables might be laid for them ormilk left with spoons crossed over the bowl; the position in which the spoonswere found when the family returned from church would foretell the future ofmembers of the household in the coming year, while the milk might be givento the hens to help them lay, or to the cows (Waschnitius 1913:36, 48, 57, 62).Records of such visits go back to early sources, which refer to a troop ofchildren accompanying the goddess, and those who tried to get a glimpse ofthem being smitten with blindness. Special cakes or prepared dishes would beeaten on the feast-days of such beings, while the day might also be celebratedby bands of masked or disguised youths waving whips and chasing passers-byor visiting houses; sometimes the local goddess might be carried about,represented as a grotesque or monstrous figure (Waschnitius 1913:37, 57, 73).There is no doubt of the link between such spirits and the natural world.Frau Holle was said to be making her bed or turning her mattress when snowfell; fog was the smoke from her fire, and thunder caused by her reeling her flax.Holle might bring flowers and fruit from her beautiful garden, and she was saidto go round the fields to make them fruitful, like Nerthus in Denmark muchearlier (p. 133) and to awaken the apple trees in spring. Waschnitius suggestedthat her connection with spinning arose from her link with the growing of flax,but it may be noted that there is also a widespread and ancient link between aspinning goddess and human destinies (p. 138). Again, the dual nature of thesegoddesses is very marked; the local spirit might appear as a benign White Ladyrising from her pool or as an ugly monster. There is also folklore from theBritish Isles connected with supernatural helpers who use a spinning-wheel,such as the tale of Habetrot, where an old woman who lives under the earthwith a company of other spinners befriends a feckless girl who hates spinningand ensures a splendid marriage for her (Briggs 1970:303).Such legends are a valuable source of evidence for the nature of the beliefin the protective goddesses who especially helped women and children.Parallels to those customs noted by Waschnitius may be found in records oflocal traditions in many parts of north-western Europe, for instance thoseassociated with St Brigid in Ireland. Her festival is 1st February, and on thatday spinning was forbidden, and sometimes ploughing and smithying also. Thesaint was said to travel round the countryside on the eve of her festival, andbuttered bread or a dish of porridge might be left on the window-sill for her,or the table set with food as for the German visitants. Images of Brigid might"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"GODDESSES AND GUARDIAN SPIRITS117be carried round, or a girl dressed in white might represent the saint. A wildgroup of youths in fantastic costumes, known as the biddies, might also visithouses and terrify the children (Danaher 1972:13 ff.).There is also a tradition found in France of a travelling goddess fleeing fromher enemies who made the corn sprout and grow with miraculous rapidity. Thislater became attached to legends of the Virgin Mary fleeing with the ChristChild to Egypt, and to various female saints. Berger (1988) has shown that itcan be traced back to medieval times. Another striking example of thetransference of earlier rites to Christian tradition is given by Thevenot(1968:191). He describes pilgrimages to the shrine of Notre-Dame-de-la-viein a remote district north of Lyon, which continued as late as 1960. Gifts suchas cereals, cheese and butter were brought in large quantities to the little chapelof Belleville, where there was a sacred spring, and gifts of sheep and cattle soldby auction. A small stone figure there is said to represent the Virgin, and thisis clearly of considerable age; Thevenot thinks it may even date back to Romantimes. According to local tradition, it originally represented a pregnant woman,but was mutilated some time in the last century because this was felt to beimproper. The figure wears a hood and holds an object like a muff, apparentlya symbol of the spring whose waters were believed to have healing powers.Women in particular came for healing, bringing cloths to dip in the water andapply to afflicted parts of their bodies, and there are records from theseventeenth century of dead babies being temporarily restored to life whenbrought there, so that it was possible to baptize them.Clearly, there is a considerable amount of material provided by folk traditionand legend that can add to our understanding of the cults of local goddesses inpre-Christian times, and a great deal remains as yet unexplored. From the pre-Christian period archaeology provides us with a few hints only. In Scandinavialocks of hair, gold rings and various women’s ornaments have been found atoffering-places in use before the Viking Age, and also traces of flax, togetherwith instruments for beating it (Arbman 1945). In the sixth century Gregoryof Tours refers to offerings of cheese, wax, bread and spices of various kinds,‘which would take too long to enumerate’ (Hagberg 1967:67). A good deal ofwork has now been done on offerings of weapons thrown into lakes or swamps,but we know little about the kind of offerings that might have been made tothe goddesses, and such objects as cheese or bread would leave little trace inearth or water. Written sources may help to fill the gap here, and remind us ofthe constant link between female spirits and the work done on the farms instable, kitchen or dairy, while the value of popular tradition in filling the gapmust not be underestimated.GUARDIAN SPIRITSIt becomes apparent that the mythical world must be extended beyond thecompany of the powerful individual gods to that of supernatural guardians and"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE118protectors of a lesser kind, with whom a covenant might be made. It is notalways easy, however, to draw a clear line of separation between them and theleading gods. Worshippers of Thor or Freyr in the sagas might similarly makea covenant with their favourite deity and receive help in making decisions andplanning a course of action (p. 102), and certain families apparently chose toworship one particular god, usually Thor or Freyr, in this way.There are also examples, however, of local guardian spirits, either male orfemale, attached to a family, and the valkyries, originally spirits of battleassociated with the war god, may also function in this way, appearing in poemsand stories as the guardians and brides of young heroes. Such beings are foundin the early books of Saxo’s History, usually appearing in a small group, andagain in the Helgi poems (Davidson 1988:93 ff.). Besides giving help andvictory in battle to their protégés, and receiving them after death, as would beappropriate for a battle spirit, they may also present a young prince with aweapon and even give him a name.Together with the norns and the Dísir, they appear to determine the destinyof an individual and may be present at the birth of a child. The norns arerepresented in the poem Voluspá as three powerful women who ‘cut on wood’;Holtsmark has explained this expression by the custom in Norwegianfarmhouses as late as the nineteenth century of recording important dates ornumbers of months or years by notches cut into a plank in the wall, often abovea window (Holtsmark 1951:85 ff.). In the poem the three are named Urd,Verdandi and Skuld. Urd is the name of the being representing fate who sitsby the spring under the World Tree, and she might therefore be linked with thetime of birth when an individual’s fate is decreed. Verðandi comes from the verbverða (to become) and could stand for the time of life on earth; while Skuld(something owed) could be linked with death, the debt which all must pay(Njáls Saga 119). It has been suggested that this concept of three fates has beenborrowed from classical mythology, but if so it seems to have been thoroughlyabsorbed into native tradition. In the first of the Helgi poems in the Poetic Eddathe norns are described in a cosmic setting, ‘with power weaving the web offate’, and fastening the golden threads of the young prince’s destiny ‘in themidst of the hall of the moon’. In the Icelandic Sagas, however, the norns havebeen transformed into local wise women, journeying round the farms anduttering words of prophecy concerning the destiny of small children. Here wehave certain echoes of the Mothers of an earlier period, with their rolls ofdestiny and infants in their arms or at their knees.Again, there is some confusion between such figures who determine the fate ofmortals and the Dísir, sometimes represented as supernatural beings attached toone particular family. In an early poem of Bjorn of Hitdale, he refers to foreseeingDísir, who are summoning him to death, and there is a reference in the Edda poemAtlamál to Dísir seen in a dream summoning the king to join them, which meansthat he is about to die. In a series of verses attributed to Gisli Sursson in his saga,thought to have been composed after his lifetime however, perhaps in the twelfth"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"GODDESSES AND GUARDIAN SPIRITS119century, there are references to two women who visited him in his dreams whenhe was living a lonely life as an outlaw. One of these was destructive and hostile,while the other was compassionate and welcoming. The threatening womanforetold his death by violence, but the other promised to receive him into herdwelling. Two companies of women, one dressed in dark clothing and armed likevalkyries and the other in shining white, appear in the tale of the death of Thidranditold in Plateyjarbók (I, 418 ff.). The dark women are said to be the Dísir of thefamily, angry because Hall and his household had accepted Christianity, while thewomen in white are the Dísir of the new faith, as yet too far away to be able toprevent the slaying of Thidrandi as an act of vengeance by the family spirits(Davidson 1988:140 ff.; 106). In both cases we have what appear to be memoriesof an earlier belief adapted to fit into a Christian setting.The term fylgja (‘following one’) is another used occasionally for a femalespirit in the literature. It can refer to an animal form, which may representsomeone in a dream, or be visible to a person with second sight as it accompaniesits human partner (Davidson 1978a). However, the fylgjukona (‘followingwoman’), seen by those with the poet Hallfred at the time of his death, is evidentlyan attendant spirit of the family, who is received by Hallfred’s son after the poet’sdeath (Hallfreðar Saga 11). She may be compared with the spirit seen in a dreamby Glum on the death of his grandfather in Norway (Víga-Glúms Saga 9). In theverse describing her, she is called a goddess, but in the prose account she is saidto be the hamingja of the dead Vigfuss. This word can be used for good fortuneand strength, such as a powerful king possessed, and she seems here to representthe good luck of the family, which was now to pass to the hero.Among the land-spirits attached to the countryside, there are many malespirits also, sometimes called ‘rock-dwellers’ in the Icelandic sagas (Davidson1988:103). One of these visited Goat-Bjorn in a dream, according to a tale inLandnámabók (S, 329; H, 284:330), and offered to enter into partnership withhim. Another spirit said to dwell with his family in a great stone (Kristnis Saga2; þorvalds þáttr 2) is called both ármaðr, ‘harvest-man’, and spámaðr, ‘onewho foretells the future’. He was driven out by the Christian bishop withprayers and holy water, and the farmer regretted his departure, since, he said,‘he tells me beforehand many things that will happen in the future, he guardsmy cattle and gives me warning of what to do and what to avoid, and therefore1 have faith in him and 1 have worshipped him for a long while’. Another rock-dweller is Bard of Snaefell, a mountain spirit who helped people in need andprotected them against evil beings, whose story is told in a half-legendary sagaBárðar Saga Snaefellsáss. He lived high in the mountains, and is described aswearing a grey cloak and hood, with a belt of walrus-hide round his waist, andcarrying a long staff like a shepherd’s crook with a two-pronged handle and aspike to help him across the glacier. He also had a family which included anumber of daughters, some of whom might visit local farms, but remainedhidden from sight, like household guardian spirits. He is called the ‘god’ (áss)of Snaefell, and there are references to other such beings on Svinfell (Njáls Saga"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE120123), and Dovrefjell in Norway, where the giant Dofri was said to have fosteredand helped Harald Fairhair (Ellis 1943).The land-spirits were held to be offended and alarmed by violence. In one placein southern Iceland where a settler was murdered by his thralls, it was said that noone for a long while dared settle in this area ‘on account of the landspirits’(Landnámabók S, 330:333). It is recorded that no ship was permitted to enterIcelandic waters with a threatening figure-head on the prow, because this wouldalarm the land-spirits (Landnümabók H, 268:313). This should not, however, betaken as an indication that the hard-headed Icelanders had a naïve, childish beliefin such spirits. Land-spirits were a symbol for them of their independence, as maybe seen in the tale of the wizard sent by a Danish king to Iceland in the form of awhale who was frightened away by the land-spirits who appeared on every side,since ‘all the mountains and hills were filled with landspirits, some great and somesmall’ (Heitnskringla, Óláfs Saga Tryggvasonar 33). This is a jesting tale mockingat the pretensions of the ambitious Danish king, but on the other hand there was astrong assumption that was anything but naïve that the spirits of the land must bein harmony with their rulers to ensure prosperity (Davidson 1988:107).The figures of such protective spirits appear to resemble those depicted oncarved votive stones of the Roman period in England, known as the Cucullatior ‘Hooded Ones’ (Figure 29). They are found near Hadrian’s Wall in the northand also in the Cotswolds, and appear to be male, usually depicted in groupsFigure 29 Three hooded figures from Romano-British carving, Cirencester.Drawing by Eileen Aldworth."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"GODDESSES AND GUARDIAN SPIRITS121of three; they wear a hood and a cloak that reaches either to their knees or downto their ankles. Sometimes they are pictured in company with one of the MotherGoddesses, and like her they may carry symbols of plenty, such as fruit or eggs.Sometimes these little beings are depicted in naturalistic Roman fashion, whileother carvings are clearly the work of native artists. The votive tablets indicatethat both soldiers and civilians took an interest in these protective spirits, andbelief in them evidently flourished among the Celtic people of Britain, as someof the stones were set up on country estates (Davidson 1989b).Such traditions did not wholly die after the coming of Christianity, sincethere is a rich store of tales about brownies and other house-spirits recordedin many parts of the British Isles. They might be attached to certain families,and they helped with the hard work of the farm, such as harvesting andthreshing, with the care of the animals, and also in the dairy and kitchen. Theyprotected the women and children, and sometimes helped over childbirth. Inreturn for their labours they asked little more than a supply of fresh creamymilk, left on the hearth or outside the house; if cheated over this, or treated withdisrespect, they could be both mischievous and dangerous, and there are manyamusing tales of how they turned the tables on those who made themunwelcome. They were known under various names, such as Hob, Puck,boggart, grogach in Ulster, bwca in Wales, and fenodoree on the Isle of Man.There was much local tradition about them in the sixteenth and seventeenthcenturies in England, as we learn from Shakespeare’s Midsummer Night’sDream and Milton’s L’Allegro, and many references in plays and verse. Suchguardian spirits brought good luck to the household, and took it away if theyleft. They were generally male, but occasionally had female companions(Davidson 1989b).Such humble spirits need to be borne in mind along with the greater godswhen striving to reconstruct the lost religion of northern Europe. Closeparallels to the British spirits are found in other European countries, and itseems probable that half-serious, half-mocking beliefs of this kind formed afamiliar part of the supernatural in earlier times, contributing to the generalpicture of the Other-world. Their comparatively humble status helped themto survive the hostility of the Christian church and to linger on in folk tradition.In the Viking Age they may have been part of the company of the Vanir. Weoften hear of the ÆSir and Vanir, and also of the Æsir and the elves in the poetryof the Edda. The earlier conception of elves differed from the tiny creatures ofmodern children’s tales, and one of the Norwegian kings who was said tobenefit his people after he was laid in his mound was called the Elf of Geirstad(p. 122). Elves were also linked with Freyr, said to dwell at Alfheim. This groupof lesser beings, then, must not be discounted in any study of the divine worldof pre-Christian tradition, and here we have an example of the value of folktradition in helping us to reconstruct the past, even though our ideas of the wayin which this was preserved and developed may differ greatly from those ofearlier scholars like the Grimm brothers."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE122THE CULT OF THE DEADThe attitude to the dead in northern religion is by no means easy to define.Many of the tales that have found their way into the Icelandic sagas express aprimitive attitude towards the dead, who are viewed as hostile to the living,grudging them life and desirous to deprive them of it. A terror of the dead isexpressed in tales of those who refuse to lie quiet, and who as draugar, animatedcorpses of great strength and ferocity, become destructive beings who lay wastewhole districts in the long winter nights. The only means of dealing with therestless dead was to overcome them by force, cut off their heads, and finallydestroy the bodies by burning (Davidson 1981b). Archaeology provides us withexamples of mutilated and sometimes headless bodies with the head includedin the burial, which might be the result of such fears of the dead walking outof the grave (Simmer 1982:43 ff.).However, in spite of this deep-rooted fear of the dangerous dead, there is someindication that the dead might also be regarded as guardian spirits, helping andsupporting the living. For this reason they must not be forgotten in anyconsideration of such spirits in the family or community. The Celtic custom oftreasuring the heads of dead enemies seems at least to have been partly based onthe belief that this brought strength and good fortune to the victor. Graves offormer kings were regarded as sacred places, and also as centres of inspiration.It was of importance to know where kings of the remote past were buried, andthe poem on the Swedish kings composed in the tenth century, Ynglingatal, whichwas used by Snorri in Ynglinga Saga, shows the emphasis on death and the placeof burial in the case of these semi-mythical figures. There are references toofferings of gold, silver and copper at Freyr’s mound (Ynglinga Saga 10), whilethe Norwegian king Olaf known as the Elf of Geirstad was said in Flateyjarbók(Óláfs Saga helga II, 6:7) to be worshipped after death; this was the king held tohave a special link with his descendant Olaf II, the Saint. The story goes that theyounger Olaf could not be born until the sword of the earlier king was broughtfrom his burial mound, together with the sword-belt and a gold ring, and the beltput round the mother, while the name ‘Olaf was afterwards given to the newbornchild. There is a strange account of St Olaf’s men asking him if he had been buriedin the mound of the earlier king, whereupon he became angry, denying that hissoul could ever inhabit two bodies, ‘either now or on the Resurrection Day’, sincethis was clearly contrary to Christian teaching.The use of the term ‘Elf for the dead king is of particular interest here. It isalso said of this Olaf’s brother, Halfdan the Black, that many different regionsof the kingdom wished to possess his body after death, ‘for they thought if theycould obtain it it would bring them prosperous seasons’ (Heimskringla, Hálf-danar Saga 9). There seems to have been an assumption also that the remote,unknown dead of an earlier period might still be able to help the living.Archaeological evidence shows that sacred places such as Tara in Ireland andTynwald in the Isle of Man were situated on earlier burial grounds, while the holy"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"GODDESSES AND GUARDIAN SPIRITS123centre at Uppsala in the Viking Age was surrounded by many grave-mounds largeand small, some of which go back at least to the Migration Period.The importance of the burial mound is confirmed by extensivearchaeological evidence for rich burials, apparently necessitating elaboratefuneral ritual and expensive provision of valuable grave-goods (p. 21). Thegreat Scandinavian ship-burials must have been planned with deliberate useof religious symbolism, and one contemporary account by an Arab writer ofthe early tenth century certainly confirms this. In Ibn Fadlan’s detailed accountof a cremation funeral on the Volga by Swedish merchant-adventurers in 921,we find reference to complex funeral rites, including songs, ritual actions andanimal and human sacrifice (Smyser 1965). Of especial interest is hisdescription of the ceremony where the girl who was to be offered up as asacrifice as the bride of the dead chief was made to look through a frame intowhat appears to represent the Otherworld; she described it as green and fair,claiming to see her husband and her dead kinsfolk awaiting her.The welcome by ancestors and kindred in the Otherworld is rememberedtoo in Icelandic literature. According to Eyrbyggja Saga 11, ThorsteinThorolfsson, while still a young man, was drowned along with his crew whenout fishing one night. He and his companions were seen by a shepherd enteringthe holy hill Helgafell, which his father had chosen as a sacred place when hesettled in Iceland (p. 102). Inside, it was bright with lights and men were sittingdrinking, as his father from the world of the dead welcomed his son, and hewas led to the seat of honour. There could not have been many inside the hill,since Thorolf, the drowned man’s father, had been one of the first settlers tocome out to this part of Iceland, but it seems as if the concept of ancestorsdwelling in a hill was already established. Another relevant passage is fromVíga-Glúms Saga 26, where the hero, who had offended the god Freyr, had adream. He is said to see Freyr sitting on a chair near the river, while many peoplethronged about him, and was told that these were his own dead kinsfolk, whohad come to beg Freyr not to let him be driven from his land. Here Freyr is seenin company with the dead of one particular family, and Glum’s forebears striveto help him to escape the god’s anger, although without success.Another reason for seeking the help of the dead was to receive inspiration.In a tale from Flateyjarbók (Óláfs Saga Tryggvasonar 174:214), a shepherdcalled Hallbjorn is said to have sat on the burial mound of a dead poet calledThorleif while minding his sheep. He wanted to make a poem in praise of thedweller in the mound, but was not skilled in word-craft and could get no furtherthan the opening line: ‘Here lies a poet...’ One night he dreamed that themound opened, and a huge man came out and sat beside him. He thankedHallbjorn for his efforts, and told him that he was going to recite a verse to him,and that if Hallbjorn remembered it after he woke up he would become afamous poet. After this Hallbjorn found no difficulty in composing poetry; heis remembered as a poet at the Danish court and later at that of King Sverri inNorway, although his work has not survived. This tale offers an interesting"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE124parallel to that of the gift of poetry given to Caedmon as related by Bede in hisEcclesiastical History (IV, 24). Caedmon was inspired by an angel, whoappeared to him in the stable and taught him a verse, while Hallbjorn got hisinspiration from the dead poet. There seems no reason why the Icelandictradition should not be an independent one, and indeed a much later Icelandicpoet of the nineteenth century claimed to have learnt a verse from a dead poetin a dream in a similar way (Turville-Petre 1966).There are further instances of dreams caused by sleeping on burial mounds.When King Halfdan the Black wanted to have meaningful dreams, by which heprobably meant dreams foretelling the future, he was told by a wise man that hehimself would sleep in ‘the dwelling of swine’ when he needed to dream. N.K.Chadwick (1968:41) suggested that this might mean that the seer used to sleepon a burial mound, since the pig was the symbol of Freyr and the Vanir, and Freyrwas specially associated with mounds; this idea might have arisen from akenning. Another story in Plateyjarbók (Óláfs Saga Tryggvasonar I, 206:253)tells of a dream of Thorstein Ox-Foot which resulted in the recovery of hismother’s power of speech. When he was a boy aged 10, he was out with a servantwhen they came to a great burial mound. He declared that he was going to sleepon it, and ordered the thrall not to wake him, however he behaved in his sleep,‘for I believe that much depends on it’. He was very restless while he slept, butthe man did not wake him. Next morning he told his dream, and how a man inred, of great size, had come out of the mound and invited him in. There he saweleven other men in red and twelve in black, with an evil-looking leader of theblack men who bullied the rest. Thorstein was told that this man possessed a ringthat could heal his mother, who was dumb, so he attacked him with an axe, andbattle broke out. The wounds dealt by the men from the mound had no lastingeffect, but those of Thorstein did, and so with his help the men in red werevictorious, and Thorstein obtained the ring. The man in red then entreated himto pass on his name to a son, so that the dead might ‘come under baptism’. Herea Christian slant has been given to the tale, but the idea of the dream on themound and the healing obtained as a result seems likely to have come from anearlier world of belief. The two contrasted pictures of the dead—one of hostilebeings and the other as helpers with whom a contract could be made—arecharacteristic of the attitude to the dead as a whole in Norse tradition.Dead men may also appear in dreams, like the land-spirits, to give neededinformation. In Flóamanna Saga a man learns in a dream how he can overcomea berserk in a duel. In Sturlunga Saga 136 a dead man who had fallen in battleis said to appear in one of the many dreams mentioned in this saga, a gruesomefigure with his head half-sliced away, to foretell violence to come. Anotherdream-figure in the same saga is said to be the famous Gudrun of heroictradition, who declared she had come from Hel, the abode of the dead, to givewarning of a coming battle to a girl aged 16, whose name is given. Sometimesthe dead appear to complain of being disturbed by the living, like the deadseeress in Laxdæla Saga 76 whose grave lay under a church, or Asolf in"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"GODDESSES AND GUARDIAN SPIRITS125Landnümabók (H, 21:63) who objected to a girl herding cattle wiping hermuddy feet on his mound. His bones were afterwards dug up, whereupon heappeared in a dream to the man who had disturbed his peace, threatening tomake his eyes start out of his head if he did not leave him alone. Asolf hadalways been a difficult character: he was one of the few Christians to settle inIceland early on, had not got on with other people and finally retired to livealone as a hermit, but was remembered as a man with special powers. Thestrength of the dream tradition and the conviction that many have the powerto ‘dream true’ still persists in Iceland, and dreams clearly formed an importantlink both with the dead and the land-spirits.It is evident that the guardian spirits of the pre-Christian religion cannot beeasily arranged in clearly defined compartments. It is important to recognizetheir complexity, and also how such concepts continued to develop in Christianliterature because of their power as symbolic images. Many of these guardianspirits belonged to local or family tradition, so that there was much that wasspontaneous and individual about them, and we are fortunate that in Icelandsome pre-Christian beliefs and practices have been remembered and recorded.If we are to understand the religion of the past, it is essential to investigate suchevidence, to gain some idea of what such traditions meant to those whopreserved or added to them. Some understanding of how folklore traditionsevolve and are passed on, often with the help of written literature, is a valuableclue towards the interpretation of a religion never fully organized or governedfrom a powerful centre. After the change to Christianity, the figures of theguardians became increasingly blurred, as one image influenced another. It maybe noted that comparatively few of them have personal names, with theexception of the known dead and the valkyries, many of whose names wereprobably invented by poets of the Viking Age.Belief in such spirits was evidently linked with the cults of the gods, and avariety of different beings, male and female, were apparently included in thegroup known as the Vanir, led by the god and goddess associated with fertility.The saga-tellers make frequent use of tales about them to enrich their plots,and the number of helpful spirits mentioned in Landnámabók in a casual waygives some idea of the richness of the material on which they could draw. Theyformed a link also with the older heroic legends, such as we find in the Helgipoems and Saxo. Further back in the Germanic and Celtic past, the vast numberof votive stones and representations of guardian beings of various sorts thathave survived into our own day in England, France, Germany and theNetherlands shows that such traditions played a part in the lives of the rich andinfluential as well as in those of simple folk. In Christian times similarly we findan enormous amount of material concerning local saints and their shrines,including hymns in their honour, carved stones in churches and gifts and votiveinscriptions left by those who received help and healing. Some of the earlierguardian figures, such as Brigid, took on new life in the character of Christiansaints.

In any account ofthe pre-Christian supernatural world, it is evident that this popular elementmust not be forgotten, since it was one that was very real to the men and womenof the Viking Age and earlier, and they perceived no clear line of separationbetween such spirits and the cults of the greater gods."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"1276Contacts with theOtherworldFar have I fared, much have 1 dared,oft have I tested the Powers(Vafþrúðnismál 3) The surviving evidence for the pre-Christian religion in north-western Europeleaves us with a confused but lively impression of a world-picture now lost, whichonce inspired an abundance of tales and legends, as well as a vigorous pictorialand symbolic art, even though very little of this has survived. Much of the artwas carved in wood, and the examples that have come down to us, like thosefrom the Oseberg ship from southern Norway in the ninth century, showcomplex skills in artistic expression, as well as a plentiful use of symbolism.Another source of art almost wholly lost is that of designs and narrative sceneson narrow panels of tapestry or embroidered pictures, which were set up in hallson festive occasions, or on board ships in harbour. Isolated examples like theBayeux tapestry and the roll from the Oseberg ship with its medley ofsupernatural figures (Figure 30) reveal how rich a source this could have been.A number of references to such pictures of mythical or heroic subjects in OldNorse poetry indicate that this kind of work, carried out by aristocratic women,may have had a considerable influence in preserving religious traditions,especially since tapestries could easily be transported from one area to another.We rely mainly on carved stones to put alongside the written sources,together with metal work of the pre-Christian period. Some prove to be insurprisingly close agreement with the later literary accounts, although thecarving may be older by some centuries than the written sources. The pictureof the bound Loki on the Gosforth Cross, for example (p. 50), orrepresentations of Thor fishing for the World Serpent (p. 52), indicate that somemotifs have altered little over a considerable period of time. However, moreperplexing pictures like the plates on the Gundestrup Cauldron (p. 25) or tinyscenes on the gold bracteates (p. 41) show us how little of the symboliclanguage of the past we really understand, and remind us that the chances ofsurvival may lead us to overvalue the trivial and neglect the symbols of greaterimportance for those who worshipped the old gods and goddesses. It is worth"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE128reviewing the scattered material at this point, to see if there is any hope ofbuilding up a coherent scheme of the relations of men and women with thesupernatural world in a pre-Christian society. Here it is necessary to distinguishbetween evidence for religious rites and customs on the one hand, and thecontent of the myths on the other. In this chapter it is intended to survey whatappear to be the outstanding characteristics of the religious life of theScandinavians before the conversion, putting this against the vaguerbackground of our picture of the Celtic and Germanic past.THE EARLY CENTURIESEarly accounts of the Celts and Germans from outside observers stress the useof sacred places in the open air, rough wooden figures of the gods, and the practiceof animal and human sacrifices, as well as the leaving of offerings in water or inthe earth. Such archaeological evidence as we possess consists mainly of isolatedsites within some kind of enclosure. Graves often in association with such sitesoffer some chance of dating, but those discovered before the Roman period areusually too isolated in time and space to allow firm conclusions to be drawnabout the religious rites for which they were intended. Lucan in the first centuryBC refers to ‘grim-faced gods, uncouthly hewn by the axe’ (Pharsalia III, 411–13), and wooden figures that accord with such a description continued to be setup as late as the Viking Age, proving very difficult to date. However, the Celts insouthern Gaul who came into contact with the Greeks and Romans were ableto produce impressive male figures in stone considerably earlier than this. In thesanctuary of Roqueperteuse in southern Gaul there are two memorable JanusFigure 30 Figures on tapestry found in Oseberg ship burial."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"CONTACTS WITH THE OTHERWORLD129heads facing in opposite directions, perhaps of the third century BC or evenearlier. Another two-faced figure that must surely represent a god is the sandstonepillar from Holzgerlingen, which stands 2.3 m high and is topped by a formidablehead with a face on either side, under the remains of a horned or moon-shapedcrown (Sandars 1968:248). The towering statue of a grim warrior figure fromHirschlanden which stood on a mound and has been generally taken as afunerary memorial may go back to the sixth century BC (Megaw 1970:47); fromabout the third century we have the line of figures seated cross-legged in thesanctuary at Entremont along the sacred way (Benoit 1975). Thus there areindications of powerful divine beings, whether gods or ancestors, occupying aplace in the Celtic world-picture at an early date, but we depend on a few chancesurvivals only to give us hints of the nature of the Celtic Otherworld.A ritual that goes back to the Bronze Age and was continued by the Celts isthe deposit of offerings and sometimes sacrifices of animals placed in deep shaftsor pits in the ground (Figure 31). It is hard to be sure in some cases whether thesemight simply be rubbish or storage pits with no religious purpose, but thepresence of a number of dog skeletons and occasional human ones, the trunk ofa cypress sapling in one pit, and finds of carved human figures, indicate that someat least were intended to hold offerings and presumably that they were viewedas possible entries to the underworld (Green 1986:132 ff.). Groups of such shaftshave been found both in Britain and on the continent, and a large number in thearea around Chartres may have been associated with the centre where druidswere said to meet (Ross 1978–80). The problems involved in assessing this typeof evidence for ritual practices have been discussed by Wait (1985:51 ff.). In asurvey of a number of such shafts from the Iron Age and the early Roman periodin Britain, he emphasizes the large investment of time and manpower in makingsuch shafts, and also notes an apparent shift in the later examples from offeringsconnected with local fertility to those of ‘more personalised material objects ofwealth’ (Wait 1985:82).The period from the first to the fifth century, when the Romans wereoccupying Gaul and much of Britain, gives us more evidence on which to draw.There is indication of a flourishing religion among the native population withbeliefs in many supernatural beings, male and female, and of sacred places onhills and islands, in woods and beside springs and lakes. We have a vast numberof altars and votive stones surviving from military and domestic sites which havebeen set up in honour of Otherworld powers. Some Celtic sacred places weretaken over by the Romans and developed as popular centres for pilgrims. Oneoutstanding example is the temple of Sulis Minerva at Bath, where the sacredhot-springs must already have been associated with a goddess who was identifiedwith the Roman Minerva. What had apparently been an open pool was roofedin with great skill by Roman engineers, so that visitors to the shrine could lookthrough three large windows at the water rushing out of a cavern through a stonearch. The mist and steam rising from this must have made it an impressive place,and groups of statuary were placed at water-level, while baths were provided as"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE130another means of making use of the sacred waters. There seems to have beena deliberate attempt to add to the romantic mystery of the place, and parallelscan be found from other Roman sites (Cunliffe 1986:4). One can but wonderwhether this added to the reputation of the goddess among the local people,or whether they felt saddened to have her taken over by their new rulers.Certainly the temple was a commercial success, attracting rich pilgrims, tojudge from the valuable gifts recovered from the spring, including coins, jewels,inscribed gems and fine metal vessels. Some of those who visited it must havebeen people of importance from various parts of the Empire, but there are alsoFigure 31 Ritual shaft from the Vendée, France (after Piggott)."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"CONTACTS WITH THE OTHERWORLD131clues as to the simpler rites offered to the guardian goddess of the spring beforethe Romans developed it. As well as rich gifts and money, there are two militaryitems, suggesting requests for help in a campaign or gratitude for its success,one a piece of harness decoration and the other a washer from a model ballista.There is also the somewhat depressing collection of curses written on lead,calling down the wrath of the goddess on some unknown person (thoughpossible suspects are named) who had stolen from the worshipper or injuredhim in some way. This process had been organized in typical Roman fashion,with a set formula provided, and a temple scribe supplying an approved formof invocation that could apparently be copied out by the applicant (Cunliffe1986:10), but again it strongly suggests a more spontaneous approach to sucha deity linked with the natural world, in a place where there seemed to be anopening into the underworld, before the Romans came.A similar place of offering on a smaller scale is Coventina’s Well, now onlythe site of a former spring in marshy ground near the Roman fort ofCarrawburgh on Hadrian’s Wall between Chesters and Housesteads (Allason-Jones and McKay 1985). In Roman times a small shrine and carefullyconstructed well were made there, and the well may have served as the centreof the shrine, left open to the sky. When the site was excavated in 1876,inscribed stones bearing the name Coventina were found; in this case we donot know if she was a local goddess or was perhaps brought into Britain byGerman troops manning the fort. The well yielded a large number of coins,together with objects of bronze, bone, pottery, glass, lead, leather, jet and shale,as well as the boar-tusks, deer-horns and animal bones which unfortunatelywere not retained. We have no evidence here for curses offered at the shrine,but gifts seem to have been made in gratitude for benefits received. The historyof the well shows the problems of interpretation facing the investigators. It isnow apparent that various published references to the finds have beenmisleading: for instance, there was only one pin recorded, while the attractivemodel of a small dog, claimed along with finds of many pins to prove theexistence of a healing cult, seems not to have been found at the spring at all.However, the fact that the water from the well continued to be valued by localpeople until the spring was destroyed by lead mining in the last centuryconfirms the importance of the water from this source, and this is emphasizedby the carving of three nymphs with jars on one of the stones found at the site,and another of a reclining figure on a stele holding a water-plant. Such a centreby a spring for a local cult is in accordance with many other sacred wells andsprings on Celtic territory. Humble offering places of this kind must have beencommon among both Celtic and Germanic peoples before the Romanoccupation and again after they left.There are many tribal deities mentioned in inscriptions on votive stones andaltars who were fitted into the existing Roman system as far as was practicable,and sometimes given a Roman name alongside the native one, as in the titleSulis Minerva at Bath, or in place of it. In the later evidence from the literature"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE132of the British Isles, we have vague indications of powerful Celtic deities whichmay be strengthened by the earlier material. It is important that neither theevidence of the monuments nor that of the literature should be considered inisolation, provided always that gaps in time and in geographical space are takeninto account.There is little support now for O’Rahilly’s theories (1946) of one supremedeity of the Celts, put forward with much vigour and determination earlier inthis century. On the other hand, there were certain powerful gods like Lug andthe Dagda, whose cults evidently extended over a wide area.On the Germanic side, it seems as if at least three main deities, equated by theRomans with Jupiter, Mars and Mercury, were already established by the time theRomans reached the Rhineland. Among the Germans also there were recognizedgoddesses, some of whom, like Sulis and Brigantia, were deliberately developedby the Roman authorities, for their own purposes. Clearly, one of the most fruitfulways to discover more about the early religion of these peoples is to make moreuse of the rich material available from the provinces under Roman rule. Here wefind many protective deities, some apparently of local importance only and otherswith an influence over a wide area by the time the Roman establishment showedan interest in them. Their powers included support in battle, help in travel and inthe winning of wealth, as well as power over the weather, the fruitfulness of theland and the prosperity of crops and animals. Help might be sought from suchpowers by means of dreams, as is indicated by some of the inscriptions in temples,where altars are said to have been set up at the command of some deity (Henig1986:161). This is in agreement with the later accounts of communications fromsupernatural beings in Scandinavia, including both the major gods such as Thorand Freyr and also local spirits linked with the land.Reliance on messages received from dreams, signs and omens, and variousforms of divination is indicated in the written sources, and continued to be ofimportance throughout the Viking Age. Tacitus noted this practice among theGermans in the first century AD, and in Germania 10 gives an account of thecasting of lots, either by a priest on behalf of the community or by the fatherof a family on private occasions. One important use of the Germanic runicsymbols in early times may have been in such ceremonies (Davidson 1988:153).He tells us also of sacred horses consulted by those desiring to discover the willof the gods, since these animals, he declares, were in the confidence of the divinepowers, whereas the priests and nobles were merely the gods’ servants. This isa striking observation, indicating the value placed on horses as animals linkedwith the supernatural world, and helps to explain the wide popularity of thecult of the goddess Epona (p. 47). Another means of discovering the future wasby observing the movements of birds and animals: thus Boudicca before theopening of her revolt against the Romans released a hare and observed thedirection in which it ran, according to Dio Cassius (X, 2). A similar relianceon the movements of animals as a help in making decisions continued into theViking Age, to judge from a reference in Landnámabók (S, 68, H, 56:96). Here"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"CONTACTS WITH THE OTHERWORLD133a family chose to build their house in Iceland in the place where their mare laydown for the first time with her load on her back.It seems that methods of divination played an important part in theorganized religion of gods and goddesses as well as in private life, and thosewith special gifts of second sight possessed considerable influence in thecommunity. Of particular interest are the seeresses among the Germans in theRoman period, of whom we learn from Tacitus and others. The best-knownof these is Veleda, an influential figure in the tribe of the Bructeri in theRhineland, who played a leading part in political life and was one of the arbiterswhen an agreement was made between the Romans and the people of Cologne.She is said to have sent her decisions by a messenger, while she remained in ahigh tower (Davidson 1981a:127 ff.). Among the Celtic peoples of Gaul andBritain, the druids had considerable influence in the Roman period, andaroused the curiosity of the learned Roman world. They encouraged andpreserved religious learning, and were also associated with divination andprophecy. They undoubtedly played an important political role also, thuspaving the way for their own suppression, but it was difficult in any case in thepre-Christian era to separate the religious and secular sides of life.There is early evidence for the ritual progress of a deity around thecountryside to visit farms and bless crops and households. Tacitus describesthe journey of the goddess Nerthus in Denmark in Germania 32, and there arereferences to such processions in Roman Gaul, as well as in Scandinavia in theViking Age. Gregory of Tours describes how a goddess, whom he callsBerecynthia, was drawn through fields and vineyards ‘according to thewretched custom of the pagans’ to bring them prosperity, while the people sangand danced before her (Liber in Gloria Confessorum 77). Two skilfully madeprocessional wagons thought to date back to the late second century BC wererecovered from a peat-bog at Dejbjerg in Denmark, with a little alderwoodstool which could have been used as a seat (Brøndsted 1938–40:III, 52 ff.), andthere may be links here with earlier wagons of the type discovered in the Vixtumulus (p. 14), in which a woman of importance was placed. Later literaryevidence links the processional wagon and the journey round the countrysidewith the fertility god as well as the goddess (p. 106), and the practice may beseen continuing into the Christian period when statues of the Virgin Mary ora saint were carried round to bless the fields (Berger 1988).Another ritual reported to Tacitus in the first century AD was that of theannual gathering in a sacred wood by various tribes of the Semnones to witnessa human sacrifice. He describes this in Germania 39, alluding to the Semnonesas the oldest and noblest of the Suebi, and may have received his informationfrom Masyos, a king of the Semnones who visited Rome in AD 92, or one ofhis followers. Anyone entering this wood had to be bound with a cord as a signof submission, and might not get to his feet again if he fell. The wood is said tohave been the place where this people had their origin, and was evidently thesacred centre, standing for the place of creation. Here they worshipped the god"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE134said to be the ruling deity (Regnator omnium Deus). Many attempts have beenmade to identify him; one suggestion is that he was Tîwaz, the early sky god,and another that he was Wodan, on account of the symbolism of binding.Whatever the name of the deity worshipped, there is significance in theemphasis on the great sanctity of the place.FUNERAL SYMBOLISMMuch of the evidence for religious symbolism comes from graves, and while itis often impressive, it is not easy to interpret. It does not seem possible to explainwagon—and ship-graves simplistically as always signifying a belief in a journeyafter death. Again the practice of putting food and drink in the graves, andproviding an array of dishes, drinking vessels and flagons, as well as cauldrons,large bowls and firedogs to hold logs for the hearth, cannot be dismissed as apractice based on a naïve belief in life continuing within the grave. The idea ofthe Otherworld feast, and its link with some kind of belief in continued life withthe ancestors in another realm, has left many traces in later literature. In anycase it is reasonable to suppose that such customs meant different things to thevarious families who practised them; family funeral traditions were of greatimportance, and could account for one particular custom found in a series ofgraves but not throughout a whole cemetery or locality. A distinction needs tobe made also between the disposal of certain objects that might be felt to belongto the dead by right, such as weapons and jewellery, and offerings placed in thegrave for the use of the dead, possibly based on some concept of the after-life(Young 1976:36). Some grave-goods again might be viewed merely asaccessories of costume, or possibly as indicating rank.It does not seem possible to lay down any rule as to why inhumation orcremation was chosen as a funeral rite. It must be remembered that cremationis only possible when there is an ample supply of wood; it was a natural meansof disposing of the dead in forest areas, but one would not expect to find itpractised in Iceland. In Anglo-Saxon England it was likely to depend on familycustom and local tradition brought from their former homelands by theGermanic settlers. The great Germanic cremation cemeteries of the Romanperiod on the continent indicate only the simplest of burial rites, with the ashesplaced in a simple urn and deposited in the ground, but we lack any informationconcerning the funeral rites that went on while the body was reduced to ashes.The symbols used on funeral pottery later became increasingly complex andinteresting, and included animal symbols such as boars, horses and birds, as wellas axe-heads or possible lightning symbols, found on a number of Anglo-Saxonurns (Myres and Green 1973:60 ff.; Myres 1977:63 ff.). Recently there has beenmuch valuable study of the lay-out of cemeteries, and of the customs associatedwith death and burial. Nevertheless, as far as beliefs in the after-life areconcerned, we have not progressed much further since Cumont published hisstudy of the Roman beliefs about death in Lux Perpetua (1949), where he pointed"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"CONTACTS WITH THE OTHERWORLD135out that concepts of the soul residing in the tomb could be held at the same timeas those of the dead joining their ancestors in an underworld kingdom, orescaping to some kind of celestial paradise. No common consensus as to the fateof the dead can be expected, and varying concepts, as Cumont demonstrated,could exist side by side, and be given expression in religious imagery.Looking back on the customs and beliefs of the early centuries, we areinevitably being influenced by what we know of those of the Irish andScandinavians of later times, when the existence of written sources helps tointerpret the evidence of archaeology and iconography. This is bound to be soeven though the sources themselves may be misleading and difficult to assess.Whatever the problems, it is impossible to escape the conclusion that there ismuch continuity in religious concepts in the attitude towards the dead, just asin attempts to learn the future, methods of consulting supernatural beings, andways of worshipping the gods. Undoubtedly, the funeral rites of kings andimportant people must have formed an important part of religious ritual inwhich the whole community participated. Spectacular funeral ceremonies, forwhich we have ample evidence both from archaeology and written sources,must indeed have been memorable occasions, passed down to later generationsby those who witnessed them. The Anglo-Saxon heroic poem, Beowulf,generally dated back to about the eighth century but certainly composed in aChristian period, contains impressive accounts of pre-Christian funeral rites.There is one passage describing the burning of slain warriors on a funeral pyreafter a battle, and another concerned with preparations for the funeral of thehero, who is also cremated on a huge pyre, the ashes of which are covered by agreat burial mound to perpetuate his memory. There is a ruthless realism in theaccount of the mass funeral of the warriors (1119 ff.). Heads melt and breakup in the heat as the flames roar upwards, old wounds reopen on the bodies,until finally the greedy fire devours all. A woman chants a dirge as the bodiesare consumed in front of the burial mound that is to receive the ashes. Armouris burnt along with the corpses, while more treasures are brought ‘from thehoard’ to be placed with the ashes. When Beowulf’s time comes to be cremated,we are told that wood was collected from various parts of the kingdom, andof the enormous pyre, hung with shields, helmets and coats of mail. Once moreas the great fire roared upwards, a woman sang over and over again a dirge tothe dead ruler who had saved his people by his battle with the dragon. Afterthe burning, it took ten days to build a mound on the headland to cover theashes, and afterwards twelve of the leaders of the people rode around it,chanting a lay in honour of the hero which concludes the poem (3110 ff.).Archaeological evidence suggests that such passages were not wild flightsof fancy on the part of the poet or imitations of classical models far removedfrom actual experience. Great cremation funerals certainly took place atUppsala in the period before the Viking Age, from evidence gained from theexcavations of three great mounds believed to be the burial places of threeSwedish kings of the sixth century. The construction of the pyre seems to have"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE136been in the form of a kind of wooden shelter like a charcoal-burner’s hut witha pointed top, inside which the body was placed (Lindqvist 1936:148 ff., 339),and the cremation was clearly on a grand scale. At Asthall in Oxfordshire,much nearer home, a mound had been built over a cremation burial of theseventh century, and a wall put up round it (Leeds 1924). We now know thatthere were several cremation burials under mounds in the cemetery at SuttonHoo (Carver 1992:367–9), which it may be assumed would involve elaboratefuneral ceremonies, since these were burials of important people. There is nodoubt as to the riches of inhumation burials in the pre-Christian period, ofwhich the famous ship-grave at Sutton Hoo (p. 20) and the great Scandinavianship-graves of the Viking Age furnish impressive examples. Earlier scholars likeStjerna were perplexed by the fact that such archaeological evidence as wasknown did not correspond to the literary accounts in every detail, but now thatwe know of the many local variations and separate family fashions for thedisposal of the dead, we no longer expect agreement and uniformity.The funeral ceremony of a king as described in Beowulf must indeed havebeen a memorable experience, and when it was over the great mound was leftto be, as he had promised before he died, ‘a memorial to my people’. Theimportance of the mound as a symbol of the powerful dead and as a link withthe cults of the gods has already been discussed (p. 122). Moreover, knowledgeof such graves formed a framework around which history could bereconstructed. Like the kings of ancient India (Gonda 1956), the Scandinaviankings, even those minor rulers who possessed only small kingdoms, wereregarded as the protectors of their people, representing them in relations withthe gods, so that the god of the king was the god of his people also. He formedthe link between human and divine worlds, and this helps us to understand theimportance of the royal funeral in pre-Christian religion.COMMUNICATION WITH THE OTHERWORLDNot surprisingly, the ruler also played a major part in the feasts held regularlythroughout the year which dominated the calendar, including sacrifice anddrinking in honour of the gods (p. 88). In the main religious centre the kingpresided over this whenever possible, while in Iceland the goði of each districtappears to have been responsible for its organization and the hallowing of thesacrificial meat and the drink. This was the main way in which the communitycould meet together and seek the blessing of the divine powers as a whole.There were also many ways by which a family or an individual couldcommunicate independently with the divine world. The literature leaves theimpression of a constant search for hidden knowledge, which includedinformation as to events to come, revelation of where concealed people oranimals might be, counsel as to what course of action to take, and reassuranceabout the coming season or the result of a campaign or enterprise. The studyof signs and omens and the use of prophecy, as well as deliberate inducement"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"CONTACTS WITH THE OTHERWORLD137and interpretation of dreams, appear to have played a considerable part inreligious practice.The position of wise men and women, seers and poets, is hard to define, butas in the Roman period their influence is unmistakable. The Scandinavianpeoples had their seers and seeresses, as well as interpreters of dreams andomens. There are memories in the literature of a ceremony known as seiðr,which Snorri in Ynglinga Saga 7 associated with Odin and the goddesses. Someof the accounts of this show striking resemblances to shamanistic practices innorthern Europe and Asia in more recent times. The most detailed account,which includes a description of the costume worn by the seeress and the highseat on which she sat and from which she delivered her replies, is found in EiríksSaga rauða and represented as taking place in Greenland. It seems mostunlikely that this was possible in a new colony at so late a date, and moreprobable that this is a tradition from northern Norway transported to theGreenland scene (Davidson 1990). Here we have yet another illustration of thedifficulties of using saga literature in assessing evidence for religious practices.Nevertheless, the concept of the volva on her high seat seems to be firmlyestablished in Norse tradition, and this may be something that developed inthe north from the consultation of the seeresses in Germany centuries earlier(p. 133). The practice of seiðr may have been influenced by northern divinationceremonies in Halogaland, but the priestesses of the goddesses further southmay also have been consulted about the future when they went round on theirvisits to the country districts, leaving vague memories in the Icelandic sagas.There is no lack of evidence in the written sources of the important part playedby signs and omens in everyday life. This was especially so in warfare, a timewhen instant decisions had to be made with imperfect knowledge of the facts.Rimbert in his ninth-century Life of Anskar (XIX) tells of the retreat of an armedforce of Vikings from the defenceless market-centre of Birka in Sweden, becausewhen challenged to cast lots to see whether the gods were in favour of an attackafter ransom-money had been paid, they received a negative answer with adirective to move on and make an attack elsewhere. Not surprisingly, the writersaw this as a miracle, but there seems no reason to doubt the basic facts of theaccount, or the statement that the Scandinavians were accustomed to accept suchmessages from the gods and to act accordingly; and Rimbert was writing not longafter the event took place (C.H.Robinson 1921:xix, 65 ff.).In early Irish literature there are references to frequent consultation of thenatural world, relying on the movement of clouds, or flames, or the sea, toprovide clues for action (Davidson 1988:150 ff.). The Scandinavians also usedthe sea (pp. 101–2), and in both literatures there are references to observationof birdflight and behaviour as a way of gaining information or reaching adecision. The understanding of bird-omens is among the skills taught to youngwarrior leaders; in Rígsþrula in the Poetic Edda it is mentioned as part of the loretaught to a young prince, while in Reginsmál and Sigrdrífumál it is included inadvice given to the young hero by Odin and a valkyrie. The reference in"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE138Reginsmál 20 to a dark raven on the road counting as a good omen may becompared to a passage in the early Life of St Gregory (English HistoricalDocuments 1,688) relating how King Edwin of Northumbria on his way tochurch stopped to listen to a crow cawing ‘with an evil omen’; his Christianbishop Paulinus told a servant to shoot the bird, and later brought it into the hallto prove that since it did not foresee its own death it could not prophesy deathfor others. Ravens and crows were associated with Wodan, Odin and the CelticLug, and had close links with the battlegoddesses who might appear in this form.There is no doubt of the awareness of fate in the mythological literature ofthe north, and this must have strongly influenced the attitude of the peopletowards the divine world. The picture of the battle-spirits under Odin’s commandgoverning the fortunes of war, and of the norns determining the destiny of thenew-born (p. 118) indicates the general acceptance of the concept of anoverruling destiny. It is this that gives force to the tales of kings and heroes whogo down fighting, and of Odin himself unable to avert the fate that he foresees.There are some indications that a powerful goddess was associated with destiny,and the suggestion has been made that a female figure with weaving implementsshown on certain bracteates of the sixth century might represent such a power(p. 41). Weaving swords have been found in women’s graves in Germany in thevicinity of place-names associated with the gods, making it possible that emphasison fate formed part of the cult of the main goddess (Enright 1990). It is theawareness of fate that gives depth and irony to the finest of the Icelandic Sagas,and to BrennuNjáls Saga above all. This saga at many points seems to have itsplot deliberately shaped to recall the myth of Ragnarok. Njal, wise father andelder statesman though he is, cannot avert the doom threatening himself and hissons, even while he foresees it. The innocent foster-son whom he loves is struckdown by his foster-brothers in a harvest field, just as Balder was slain. This strongemphasis on fate must be taken into account in any attempt to reconstruct thereligious world-picture that preceded the Christian one.HOLY PLACESFinally among aspects of religion affecting daily life we must include holy placesand shrines. The local centre where the king was inaugurated appears to haverepresented the original centre of creation; sites such as Tara in Ireland were holyplaces, where sacrifices could take place and people assemble in times of crisis. Thehalls where feasts to the gods took place were likely to be at or near such centres,while in Scandinavia law cases could be held there and new laws proclaimed. Besidesuch main centres as Uppsala or Thingvellir, there were many local holy places,the centres of small communities. There were also the many spots in the countrysideand on the farms associated with land-spirits and supernatural beings who couldbring fertility and give help and protection to their worshippers. A settler in a newarea such as Iceland might deliberately choose a holy place in a spot marked bysome striking natural feature, like the little rocky hill of Helgafell in Snaefellsness"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"CONTACTS WITH THE OTHERWORLD139in western Iceland (p. 102). There is a superb view from the top of Helgafell on aclear day, extending far over land and sea in all directions, and this is characteristicof holy places. There are many such in Celtic areas that are high, with a good viewover the land, and the custom of climbing up to some of these on feast-days lingeredon in Ireland up to modern times, as MacNeill has shown in her Festival ofLughnasa (1962). Thus the countryside had an abundance of holy places, someprivate, some enclosed, and others in the open spaces far from human habitation.These were reminders of the divine world, and usually places of offering, sometimesmarked by signs of burning, or animal bones; occasionally some ceremonial objecthas been abandoned there, as in the marshes and peat-bogs of Denmark andnorthern Germany. Other sacred spots were in forest clearings, and sometimes suchplaces have left a record in local names.There must presumably have been a number of small shrines and temples,although evidence for the existence of large elaborate buildings of this kind islacking, apart from those, like the temple at Bath, enlarged and developed bythe Romans (p. 129). Individuals built small shrines for their private use, andthere were evidently temples of some kind at important centres like Uppsala,the centre of a kingdom. Here the sacred treasures of the gods would be kept,like the ring of Thor, or the bowl for sacrificial blood (p. 102). As to theappearance of such shrines, one possible clue might be seen in the striking andunusual stave churches of Norway (Figure 32), built in wood by much the samemethod as the great Viking ships (Lindholm 1968). As many as thirty-onesurvive in Norway, although many have been largely rebuilt and the earliestonly go back to the eleventh century, since the wooden bases and walls of thebuilding, packed in with stones, could not last very long. With their series ofroofs decorated with elaborate carvings, rising up to a central point, and theirdark, mysterious interiors with carved heads whose grim outlines show littlelink with Christian tradition, these churches are very different from earlychurch buildings in Anglo-Saxon England or Germany. Their structure dependson the number and arrangement of their ‘masts’, the wooden pillars supportingthe roof which rest on a ‘ground-sill’, formed of four massive lengths of timberarranged on the ground to form a square. There may be as many as six differentlevels from the ground to the central roof in a large stave church such as theone at Borgund, and the roofs at different heights are grouped round the centralsanctuary. Thus the importance of the centre is emphasized, while a coveredway runs round the outside of the building, enclosed by a low wall with anarcade above. Such a structure would be in keeping with the pattern of thedivine world in the mythology, and figures of the gods or some sacred objectcould be kept in the heart of the building under the central roof.After the Reformation it seems that some of the carved wooden figures fromthe stave churches were taken out and kept by some of the families in Setesdaland Telemark up to the eighteenth and nineteenth century (Bø 1989). They aresaid to have been honoured with simple ceremonies such as receiving a bowl ofale at the Christmas feast, or being given gifts of food, eaten by mice and rats,"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE140and to have brought good luck to the farm (Lid 1928:158 ff.). EarnestProtestant pastors and some scholars assumed that these were indeed pagan‘gods’ that had been preserved from the pre-Christian period, but the evidenceis against this. However, it is an interesting example of how a secondarydevelopment could take place, and Christian figures whose origin had beenforgotten could turn into protective symbols not unlike those recorded innorthern tradition. If, indeed, shrines similar to the early stave churches existedin Scandinavia before the coming of Christianity, they would presumably havebeen fairly small, and no definite archaeological evidence for them has beenfound. There were evidently pre-Christian buildings under the medievalchurches at Uppsala in Sweden, Jelling in Denmark and Maere in Norway(Lidén 1969), but the evidence is insufficient to give us a convincing plan ofan early temple.Figure 32 Stave church at Gol, Hallingdal, Norway (after Lindholm)."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"CONTACTS WITH THE OTHERWORLD141Much work has been done in recent years on the small temples and shrinesset up in Britain and Gaul in the period of Roman occupation, some of whichare now believed to have pre-dated the coming of the Romans (A.Ellison1980; Rodwell 1980). Some of those excavated consisted of a central area,usually square, known as the cella, which might be left open to the sky orroofed over with a small tower (Figure 33). Some sacred object or symbolmight occupy the cella, and in one temple in Gaul this contained an enormousstone menhir (Wilson 1980:5). The temple might be enclosed outside by anambulatory, like the stave churches, by means of which visitors and pilgrimscould look into the sacred place through an opening. The amount of classicalinfluence on these buildings has long been a subject of debate, but it has beenclaimed that it was on a limited scale only, and that the use of the traditionalnative form of building probably continued under the Romans (Home andKing 1980). It seems that in some areas, such as the valley of the Somme, theselittle temples may have been as plentiful as parish churches in Christian times,although it is often not easy to identify them, or the smaller shrines whichcertainly existed (Wait 1985:156). The majority from pre-Roman times inBritain were isolated from domestic sites, but found in or near places with aconcentrated population, perhaps by some natural feature such as river orforest; in some cases simple shrines were later replaced by temples (Wait1985:173). In the case of the Celtic temples, the ground-plan generallysurvives, whereas the wooden shrines in Scandinavia could leave few or notraces behind. It may be reasonably assumed, however, that a number ofshrines sacred to supernatural powers existed in both Germanic and Celticareas, and this would serve as yet another reminder to the people of the partplayed by religion in their daily life. Figure 33 Reconstruction of a Romano-British temple (from Yorkshire MuseumGuide, ‘Roman Life’)."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE142FITTING THE PIECES TOGETHERThe general picture of religious observance throughout the year, and of theindividual cults of the gods, is one that holds together reasonably well.Moreover, the evidence from Germanic and that from Celtic sources has a gooddeal in common. It was hardly a demanding faith with stern requirements fromthose who practised it, in either statements of belief or the faithful followingof ritual. We are not likely to hear of converts to this kind of religion; rather,the ritual was there for those who desired to take part in it, and there was noinbuilt hostility towards other forms of belief and practice. It may be seen asproviding a framework holding the community together, by regular feasts andsacrifices, appeals to the divine powers for prosperity at home and victoryagainst enemies, and emphasis on the ruling king acting as intermediarybetween the people and the gods, bringing blessings on the realm that couldcontinue after his death. Beside the cults of the main gods, there was a strongtradition of a powerful goddess, both at the aristocratic level and throughoutpopular tradition. While the regular sacrificial feasts at points in the calendarand appeals to the gods for guidance provided a support for living, theelaborate funeral ceremonies and the rich symbolism of a journey to theOtherworld, of the dead king joined with the gods, and of the beneficialinfluence of the ancestors, together with the welcome of the goddess or ofprotective female spirits into the world of the dead, provided a possibleframework for the acceptance and recognition of death.For many, this background of religious observance, linked with lively localbeliefs in lesser beings belonging to the natural world who could give luck andprotection, an elaborate system of omens and portents, and the possibility ofenquiry into the future in various ways, was no doubt sufficient. Althoughundemanding, it was a faith constantly brought to mind by set festivals, holyplaces and a wealth of tales about supernatural beings. There are referencesin the literature to men who trusted in their own strength and might, and it isprobable that then as now many pursued their own objectives without spendingmuch time or thought on assistance from the divine powers. There would beno penalty for or condemnation of such an attitude. The test of beliefs andpractices was how far the individual who held to them proved lucky andsuccessful, for a fortunate man or woman was felt instinctively to be in tunewith the powers governing the world, and it was prudent not to swim againstthe current. There are few certainties here, it would seem, to induce a personto die for his faith, and yet a number certainly died at the hands of OlafTryggvason and others. We have no knowledge of whether they were resistingthe greater demands Christianity would make of them, or how much theybelieved faith in the old gods to be satisfactory and right. There was certainlyno condemnation of the faiths of others, but rather a willingness, it seems, toaccept new gods into the pantheon that governed their world, if it could beshown that faith in them proved profitable."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"CONTACTS WITH THE OTHERWORLD143For those desiring a deeper insight into the supernatural world and the divineorder, there was the possible pursuit of wisdom, divination and the learningof the past that had come down by oral tradition from previous generations.Of this, unfortunately, we can expect to recover little, but there is no doubt thatit formed an important part of the old religion that must not be ignored. It wasprobably those most familiar with it who held back from entry into theChristian church. On the other hand, as suggested by Bede’s account of theconversion of Northumbria, one attractive alternative offered by the new faithwas entry into greater certainty, a system of rewards and punishments, and awide field of fresh learning, including that of the extensive written literatureavailable for those who became converts.Much of the religious life of the pre-Christian era in northern Europe ishidden from us now for ever, and we can do no more than offer tentativesuggestions as to the strengths and weaknesses of a world-picture that provedacceptable to warrior peoples over a period of many centuries. Apart from theritual, the fixed customs marking out the year and protective practices availablein times of impending danger and threat, we have also the mythical traditionin the fragmented form in which it has reached us, better preserved inScandinavia, for all its incompleteness, than elsewhere in north-westernEurope. Many scholars have worked with industry and enthusiasm in attemptsto understand the significance of these myths, and their various attempts tointerpret them will be examined in the final chapter."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"1447The InterpretersOur little systems have their day and their hour; as knowledge advances theypass into the history of the efforts of pioneers.(Letter of Andrew Lang to the widow of Max Müller) THE MEDIEVAL CHRISTIAN VIEWPOINTNo religious system can exist in a vacuum. It grows and develops subject tooutside influences, which are apparent in the religious art of the period and inthe surviving myths and legends. Beliefs and practices change according to thechanging needs of those familiar with them, while they are subject also tocertain general laws. Those interested in the history of religions are constantlytrying to determine the patterns of myth which survive from the variousreligions of the past. However, fashions of interpretation change according tothe current mode of thought, and the emphasis varies in each generation. Inthe early centuries of Christianity, when the cults of the pagan gods stillflourished in certain areas and had not been forgotten, the usual reaction wasto regard such gods as devils, part of the forces of evil battling against thekingdom of Christ. This was, however, by no means the only attitude open tothe medieval scholar with an interest in antiquity.Saxo Grammaticus in the early thirteenth century distinguished betweenthree species of wizard, in which he claimed that the northern peoples hadpreviously placed their trust (1, 19–20). First, there was the powerful race ofthe giants, second that of the gods, ‘masters of the Delphic art’ who overcamethe giants, and then a third race which emerged from the union of the first two,with lesser powers than the gods but still viewed as divine by the foolishpopulace. Snorri Sturluson, however, writing at about the same time, saw thematter differently. According to him, the men and women who peopled theearth after the Flood forgot the creator God who had preserved Noah, butwhen they gazed on the wonders of the world, they realized that some almightypower must have created it. They gave various names to this deity, and inScandinavia hailed him as Odin. Thus Snorri viewed the pre-Christian religionas a groping attempt to discover the truth about the divine world, and felt able"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"THE INTERPRETERS145to consider the beliefs of his forefathers objectively and without condemnation(Faulkes 1983). At the same time, according to theories of contemporaryscholarship also familiar to Saxo, he could see Odin and the other leading godsas originally human beings, whose great achievements led poets and story-tellers in the course of time to invest them with divine qualities (Bætke 1950).With his customary ingenuity, Snorri set the myths into a narrativeframework, presenting them as information given by three of these so-calleddivine powers in reply to the questions of a Swedish king Gylfi, who was anearnest seeker after knowledge. This allowed him to bring in another favouritetheory of the time, namely that demons delighted to lead mortals astray; thisfreed him from any personal responsibility for the tales and information aboutthe divine world that he was setting before his readers. He was accordingly ableto enjoy the material about the old gods, presenting it with wit and imaginativeappreciation. Indeed, any medieval scholar brought up on the classics waslikely to take an interest in stories of divine beings, which they would meet inthe works of Ovid and other favourite texts. The gods of the Greeks andRomans were sufficiently far removed in time and space to be regarded withdetachment, while their own native deities fell into in a somewhat differentcategory. Nevertheless, the rich heritage of their early poetry made it impossibleto ignore these traditions, and thus a treasury of popular lore about the godsand tales of their exploits came to be passed down both among the learned andthe illiterate in Iceland, and we depend largely on Icelandic tradition for ourknowledge of the mythology of the north.THE FIRST COLLECTORSThe first serious attempt in modern times to make a systematic study ofGermanic religion was that of Jakob Grimm in Germany. He and his brotherWilhelm began collecting folk-tales early in the nineteenth century, and theirfirst book of ‘Nursery and Household Tales’ (Kinder—und Hausmärchen) waspublished in 1812, after six years of work. They differed from earlier retellersof popular tales in seeing them not merely as entertainment but rather asremains of earlier myths, reflecting past beliefs and customs; they thus offereda means of investigating the Germanic past that Jakob in particular found sofascinating. He continued to work on the laws of language and on the beliefsof earlier times all his life. The brothers set out intending to record the tales asnearly as possible in the words of the narrator, but their first efforts provedunsuitable for children’s reading, and Wilhelm carried out a good deal ofrewriting and polishing to avoid adverse criticism (Tatar 1987:3 ff.). The storyof Evald Tang Kristensen’s struggles in Denmark later in the century to recordsongs and tales from poor country-folk without ‘improving’ them, and theresistance he met from established scholars, illustrates the obstacles that layin the path of those who tried to record oral traditions as they received themfrom the tellers (Rockwell 1981:88 ff.)."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE146Jakob’s work was not confined to folk-tales, and in 1825 he completed hisDeutsche Mythologie. The final edition of four volumes produced in Englishby Stallybrass (1883–8) still proves a treasure-house of odd and surprisinginformation, much of it collected locally. Grimm put together all he could findabout the names of gods and other supernatural beings, as well as cult practices,sayings and legends from various parts of Germany. He has references to suchvaried subjects as swan maidens, encounters with the devil, heroes asleep inhills, and the like, as well as to early Germanic laws, the folklore of nature andweather, and much more. Even if some of his learned etymology is no longeracceptable, there is still much that is of great value in his recognition of apossible mythological basis in popular traditions. He deliberately left theScandinavian material alone in an attempt to concentrate on the rarer evidencefrom the continent, as he explains in his introduction, so as to ‘gain clearnessand space and to sharpen our vision of the Old German faith, so far as it standsopposed to the Norse or aloof from it’.In a later preface of 1844 (Grimm 1883:III, xxix) he comments on the recentinterest shown in Celtic antiquities by scholars, ‘insisting that this downtroddenrace, which once occupied wide tracts of Germany, shall receive its due’. Seriouswork in early Welsh literature had been done in England and Wales from theseventeenth century onwards, but the idea of a Celtic religion had not been takenseriously. Irish manuscripts were still virtually inaccessible, and Scots and Irishregarded as barbaric foreigners (Piggott 1967:14). Then came the romanticizingof the druids in the eighteenth century to confuse the position still further (Piggott1968). It was to be some time before the possibilities of archaeological finds, theimpressive monuments from the early period, and the rich store of carved stonesfrom the Roman provinces, were seen as a means of throwing light on the peopleswho produced the early literature of Celtic Britain, and on the rich assortmentof native gods and goddesses whom they once worshipped.THE SOLAR MYTHSAs the evidence increased, it became obvious that there were resemblancesbetween the myths of different European cultures, and various theories ofmythology evolved. Our interpretation of the religion of Germanic and Celticpeoples has always been influenced by the prevailing theories of the time, andmust be judged in the light of contemporary thought. As we look back on earlytheories now from a different viewpoint, they seem awkward and exaggerated;but it is important to consider how they shaped our present conception ofmythology, also doomed in time to become outdated. The years of debatebetween Frederick Max Müller and Andrew Lang and their followers in thesecond half of the nineteenth century resulted in an increase of interest andcuriosity among scholars and the general public alike concerning earlierreligious beliefs, and much profitable work was done in the course of thecontroversy. Müller was a formidable German scholar studying the science of"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"THE INTERPRETERS147language and early Indian religion at Oxford, while Lang was a Scottishhistorian, poet and journalist, with very wide interests and considerableknowledge of anthropology. Both were prolific writers and good speakers anddebaters, able to express their ideas in such a way as to catch the interest of awide public. They produced lengthy books and innumerable articles, althoughthey wasted much energy in what now seem vain repetitions and attempts toscore points against one another. Both wanted to account for the savage andbarbaric elements in Greek myths, and found different ways of doing so.Müller discovered a philological link between the names of Greek gods andheroes and Sanskrit names in Vedic literature, and then found that this alsoapplied to names of some of the deities in European tradition. He claimed thatDyaus pita, the Vedic sky god, as well as the Roman Jupiter, could be linked withthe Greek Zeus, and that these names could be traced back to the Indo-Europeanform *dyeus pater, which might be translated ‘Father Sky’, standing for day andthe bright heavens, whom he saw as representing the earliest sky god. Anothermajor deity *perkumo was seen as the god of thunder and storm and patron ofwar, and from his name Müller derived those of the Indic rain god Parjanyas, theSlavic Perun, and the mother of the Norse Thor, Fjörgyn (Mallory 1989:129).Müller’s essay on Comparative Mythology was published in 1856, andbrought a new approach to the religions of early Europe. He claimed that theGermanic god *Tîwaz was derived from the same root as Zeus and other namesfor sky deities, and that he must therefore have been the chief Germanic sky god.As well as seeing an Indo-European origin for many myths, Müller believed thathis new approach helped to explain much that was puzzling in the mythologicalliterature, due to earlier attempts to interpret poetic symbols literally. The solarbasis of our myths, he argued, had left an indelible mark on our legends andtraditional language: ‘Every time we say Good Morning we commit a solarmyth.’ Indeed, as a general rule, myth arose out of ‘the disease of language’, thetendency to take poetic metaphor literally; taking a humble example from a folk-tale, he suggested that Dick Whittington’s cat could have come into being owingto misunderstanding of the French word for ‘trade’, echat.Much of this is unsatisfactory, as was immediately apparent to Lang, whoonce remarked that the history of mythology was ‘the history of rash,premature and exclusive theories’. He pointed out that there was no generalagreement as to the interpretation of the names of various gods; otherphilologists, for instance, derived Tyr’s name from a word for god representedby Latin deus, Iranian deva, and Old Irish did. As for savage and fantasticelements in Greek myths, Lang provided a different answer, finally expressedin two volumes entitled Myth, Ritual and Religion, published in 1887. Heturned to evidence for beliefs and customs recorded from undevelopedcommunities in various parts of the world, and showed how such myths mightseem appropriate to their way of life. For him, then, myths preserved traditionsfrom an earlier phase of human development. He was much influenced by thework of E.P. Tylor and the evolutionists, and in this differed from Muller, who"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE148had a higher respect for the mentality of the so-called primitive savage thanhad the early anthropologists. Thus while Müller explained the myth of Cronosdevouring his children as evolving from a poetic description of the sundevouring the clouds, Lang saw it simply as based on memories of a time whencannibalism was a common practice among savage tribes.The controversy dragged on for about thirty years, and distinguishedscholars at the London Folklore Society debated it with passion and eloquence,for this was the main centre for the arguments that aroused interest throughoutEurope (Dorson 1958). In the course of time Lang yielded some ground, sincehe recognized that some early myths must be based on the forces of the naturalworld of storm, rain and the return of the sun after the winter dark in the north.It was his approach, nevertheless, that became the generally accepted one, sinceit offered more chance of development than that of Müller, while it was verymuch in agreement with the current theories of evolution. The death of Müllerin 1900 robbed Lang of his most redoutable opponent, but Müller’s years ofresearch and exposition were not in vain. Out of his solar theories developedthe conception of the supreme sky god, recognized in the myths of variousEuropean cultures. Thomas O’Rahilly, for instance, saw the sun as the DivineEye of heaven, and therefore represented in Irish mythology by the one-eyedgod Balor, who was slain by Lug (p. 72). He linked lightning with the sun, andinterpreted the spears of Lug and Cú Chulainn as lightning weapons, togetherwith that of the hero MacCecht, even though this was said to be dark andoozing with blood. Famous swords of Celtic legend were placed in the samecategory, such as Caradbolg, the weapon of the hero Fergus, which became theExcalibur of Arthurian legend. O’Rahilly battled with other theorists, however,like Sir John Rhys, who saw Lug and his son Cú Chulainn as sun gods, as wellas with such distinguished Celtic scholars as Eleanor Hull and Alfred Nutt.Indeed, one of the fascinations but also the weaknesses of solar mythologywas the number of possibilities available when choosing characters andobjects to identify with the sun. Other scholars preferred to stress theimportance of thunder and lightning, which obviously played a prominentpart in Germanic mythology, while sky gods such as Zeus clearly wielded thethunderbolt as their weapon, and there is little doubt that Thor’s invaluablehammer-axe was regarded as a thunder weapon, shattering rocks andbringing down fire from heaven. Others, such as Zimmer and Mogk, soughtto interpret Odin as a god of the storm, stressing his association with the WildHunt and attempting to connect his name with the Indian Vata. Many ofthese theories were abandoned after a time, because of objections to thederivation of names, or more often because fuller investigation into thecharacter of the god showed that such an interpretation was inadequate. Onthe other hand, the importance of the natural world for the northern peoplesmade it likely that such imagery was employed in their myths and reflectedin the character of their dominant gods."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"THE INTERPRETERS149RITUAL AND MYTHTowards the end of the century a new approach to myth was developed as therewas increased interest in early ritual and its importance in religious life. Thewritings of James Frazer, making up the various sets of volumes that appearedat different dates under the title of The Golden Bough, had for many years anenormous influence on the interpretation of early religion. His first two volumeswere published in 1890, and were based on Frazer’s extensive knowledge of theclassics gained at the University of Glasgow. When he moved to Cambridge hecame under the influence of the Old Testament scholar Robertson Smith, whileat the same time he, like Lang, was convinced by the evolutionists. In spite of hisstrict Christian upbringing—or perhaps as a result of it—he saw religion as aninevitable but limited stage in human development, which was to be replaced byscience. For him customs and myths were a survival from the past, and he becameincreasingly fascinated by the way humanity had progressed in facing the variousproblems posed by conditions on earth. He spent many years in untiringamassing of evidence from books, drawing on reports from the Mediterraneancountries as well as Greek and Latin literature, together with evidence fromGermany and the British Isles, although he made little use of Scandinavianmaterial. Beginning with the tradition of the slave who reigned as king in thesanctuary at Nemi until overcome and slain by his successor, he finally built upa monumental structure, of which the focal point was the sacrifice of the king ata certain stage in his reign, while he also concentrated on the distribution andsignificance of the custom of totemism. In considering the northern gods, hereturned to some extent to the medieval theory that they were originallyoutstanding leaders, as he brings out in his volume on Balder the Beautiful, basedon the Scandinavian myth. For him, myths were essentially early and misguidedattempts to give a scientific explanation of the world, as wizards attempted towin control over the forces of nature (Ackerman 1987:231 ff.).There has been a strong reaction against Frazer’s work in recent years, sinceanthropologists felt that he relied on second-hand material and travellers’ accountswhich were often of dubious value, doing no fieldwork of his own. He made nodistinction between different types of evidence, mixing sophisticated poetry likethat of Virgil with naïve works of fiction written for entertainment, or with modernaccounts of village ceremonies in remote places; he lacked historic sense, and acritical approach to sources. He viewed undeveloped societies and those of earlytimes as primitive and credulous, with their ritual organized by wizards who werelargely charlatans, deceiving their hearers. He looked back pityingly from theachievements of his own time, and such a negative attitude as this was hardly likelyto result in the understanding of early religious thought. The reason for Frazer’senormous success was partly due to his undoubted ability to perceive underlyingpatterns that had not been previously recognized, and his confident explanationof strange myths in a way more satisfying than those of Müller and Lang. He couldsupply an enormous amount of material to convince his readers, and the"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE150connections are undoubtedly there, even though he remained blind to the powerand importance of symbolism and the imaginative and mystical possibilities ofmyths and ceremonies. Along with the religions of the past, he explored the folk-customs of his own time, and, like Lang, saw these as part of the generalevolutionary picture. He also offered, as it seemed to many, a new freedom ofthought, and an escape from religious domination. He made no overt attack onChristianity, and in fact aroused less hostility from the churches than RobertsonSmith, whose attitude to the religion of Old Testament times was not nearly asdestructive to Christian thought and belief.For all its limitations, Frazer’s approach brought an advance in theunderstanding of myths, as he showed how the new patterns he had revealedprevailed over a huge area of mankind. Two theologians, S.H.Hooke andE.O.James, were able to benefit from his work in their study of the religions ofthe Near East, although they differed profoundly from him in their view of mythand belief. They saw myths as the spoken part of religious rituals, the utteredword possessing, in Hooke’s words, ‘the efficacy of an act’ (Hooke 1933:3). Forhim the original myth, in a symbolic fashion, was ‘seasonally reenacted in theritual’. In their work on the early religion of the Hebrews and their neighboursin the Near East, both Hooke and James viewed the various religious systems ascoherent totalities, and not merely as examples of a common pattern (Porter1977:139). They also established the concept of the sanctity of kingship,including the rite of the sacred marriage, and this part of their work was laterconfirmed by the discovery of new texts not known in their time. Although theirresearch was not directly linked with the religions of north-western Europe, it isclearly of importance for our better understanding of ritual and practice.Another classicist, contemporary with Frazer at Cambridge, was Jane EllenHarrison, who produced brilliant and exciting studies of Greek ritual andmythology, culminating with Thetis in 1912. She showed how Greek mythcould arise out of ritual, and survive the rite that gave it birth, so that it is oftenhard to understand it when it appears in later literature. She also showed howmyths, once freed from their ritual origin, may be subsequently attached tohistorical events and people. Meanwhile A.B.Cook, also at Cambridge, hadbeen working for many years on the concept of Zeus as sky and thunder god,and tracing this further afield in northern Europe. He was one of the first tomake serious use of iconography as well as written sources.These various theories of myth all have their weaknesses if pushed too far, astended to happen among later followers of those who originated the theories. LordRaglan, for instance, carried the ritual theory to absurd extremes, making dogmaticassertions that myth could originate in no other way. For him there was also onecentral ritual, the periodic sacrifice of the king, which he believed spread from theNear East throughout the world; before that no myths had formed a part ofreligious teaching. The new advances, which proved so exciting and disturbing atthe outset, gradually became established as the accepted way of thought in studyingpast religions, until they in turn were thrust aside by later explorers and treated"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"THE INTERPRETERS151perhaps with unmerited scorn by the next generation of scholars. Where manytheorists tended to go astray was in assuming that one set of rules only must beaccepted, and that religious development must have followed a single path.Another common weakness was the habit of ignoring previous theories, assumingthat all was chaos until at length the new thinker saw the light (Strenski 1987).Charlotte Burne, an outstanding folklorist in the early years of this century andthe first woman President of the Folklore Society, saw more clearly than most thedanger of rigid conformity to one path only. In a wholly admirable review of TheGolden Bough in 1901, in which she praised Frazer’s skill in managing such variedmaterial, she observed shrewdly: ‘The fate of the solar mythologists should be awarning to us. There is no master key’ (Burne 1901:240).Another scholar who was to have a wide influence on the study of religion,and who, like Frazer, brought together material from many parts of the worldand studied the patterns which emerged, was Mircea Eliade, a Romanian scholarwho for many years worked in the University of Chicago. His view of myth wasvery different from that of Frazer. He saw myths essentially as tales revealing howthe world or some custom or ritual first came into being, and he claimed thatwhen such myths were narrated, the purpose was to reorientate those wholistened, by letting them return to their own creative beginnings. The creationof the world and of the first gods and giants, the making of the initial human pair,the establishment of order and of the calendar, and the introduction of variouscrafts and skills, were clearly regarded as important in both Germanic and Celticmythology, as far as can be judged from surviving written sources. Eliade believedalso that the sacred centre in each kingdom represented the original centre wherethe work of creation began. For him this explained the meaning of the wild orgythat often accompanied important religious festivals; just as creation meant theestablishment of order out of chaos, so this time of frenzy before returning to thefamiliar ordered world brought back something of the power and energy of thebeginning, and provided briefly an escape out of time.In his Patterns in Comparative Religion, published in 1958, Eliade showedthe persistence of certain symbols used in many regions of the world asexpressions of divine power. They are often taken from the world of nature,and include sun, moon, wind and water, stones, plants and trees, as well asmany living creatures. According to Eliade: Each must be considered a hierophany in as much as it expresses insome way some modality of the sacred and some moment in itshistory; that is to say, some one of the many kinds of experience of thesacred man has had.(Eliade 1958:2) In this Eliade was following Rudolf Otto, who in Das Heilige, published in 1917,first translated as The Idea of the Holy in 1923, claimed that religion rose out ofan independent form of experience. He sought to make clear the ‘extra’ in the"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE152meaning of holy, that something that makes it ‘above and beyond the meaningof goodness’, and he coined the term ‘numinous’, which has proved of great valuein the understanding of religious experience (Otto 1952:6 ff.). Eliade learnt muchalso from the work of Carl Jung in depth-psychology. Jung had found in thedreams of his patients images and symbols resembling those used in myth andlegend, even though they were apparently unacquainted with these from theirreading. Symbols in dreams such as dragons and monsters, the horse, the hareand other animals, the tree reaching to heaven, the flying steed or thesupernatural helper, convinced him that there is a basic need for such images. Hebelieved that certain of these were archetypal, part of the human inheritance fromearly times, and consequently they offered a clue to the regaining of wholenessfor those whose minds were disturbed. For Jung, as for Frazer, historic evidencefor the evolution of the various symbols was unimportant, but his work provedhelpful to Eliade in emphasizing the importance of myths and the reason whycertain images are so readily welcomed into religious systems.Eliade has been criticized for his unscientific approach, for putting too muchreliance on depth-psychology, and for making claims for myth impossible toverify (Strenski 1987:106 ff.). Even if we do not follow him all the way in hispattern of ‘timeless’ myths, it should be recognized that his work has been ofgreat importance for the better understanding of symbols in early religion, andthat the major symbols may be included in ritual, but are by no means whollydependent on it. Eliade’s survey is on a world-wide scale, so that only a part isdirectly connected with Germanic and Celtic religion, but there is much thatis relevant for this study in his writings. His work helps to explain thepersistence of certain patterns hard to understand, and the long life of certainsymbols in literature and art.THE STRUCTURE OF MYTHYet another ambitious scheme which ranges over myths from many parts of theworld is that of Claude Lévi-Strauss, which has been claimed to offer a morescientific approach than that of Eliade and his followers. Lévi-Strauss argued thatthe confusion over the understanding of myth resembles that formerly facingthose working on the development of language. At first in comparing differentlanguages they found nothing but confusion, until they realized that it was notthe individual sounds but the combinations of sounds that provided thesignificant data. Myths like languages are made up of units, and need to bebroken down into these if we are to comprehend their true significance. Insteadof attempting to determine the original or ‘true’ form of a myth, he believed thatit was necessary to get together all available versions and subject these tostructural analysis. To some extent this is an enlightening approach, the maindifficulty being the enormous amount of material that needs to be collected andstored in the case of the more important myths. Nor is it always easy to agree onthe essential features of a myth in its various versions, particularly in the more"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"THE INTERPRETERS153complex and fragmentary tales. One helpful discovery that has emerged fromthis approach, however, is that of the importance of polarity and contrast inmyths, with light opposed to darkness, life to death and so on. Another is theinsistence by Lévi-Strauss on the creative thinking of human beings, even in theearliest times of which we have record. He insisted that so-called ‘primitives’ werein no way inferior in their thought processes to modern men and women,pointing out that a stone axe and a steel axe may be equally well made and theonly reason that the second is superior as a tool is because steel is a differentmaterial from stone (Lévi-Strauss 1958:66). Consequently his work has resultedin a higher appreciation of early myths and legends, and proved a much-neededcorrective to Frazer’s contemptuous approach to the religious thinking of thosefollowing a simpler mode of life and an oral tradition.THE APPROACH OF DUMÉZILThe work of Georges Dumézil is of more immediate relevance for theunderstanding of the beliefs and traditions of the Germanic and Celtic peoples,because he is primarily concerned with the patterns that emerge among thosepeoples whose language indicates descent from the Indo-Europeans. He hasintroduced new meaning into strange myths like that of an early battle betweentwo companies of the gods (pp. 71–2), and his explanation of this has ‘the notinconsiderable merit of recovering order and purpose from apparent chaos’ asMacCana puts it (1970:61). He starts with the figures of the main gods of thevarious pantheons rather than attempting to deal with myth as a whole, claimingthat among peoples of the Indo-European group there were three main socialdivisions, reflected in the nature of the main gods whom they worshipped. Hefinds this tripartite division among the gods of Ancient India, and again amongthose of Ancient Rome, and goes on to apply the same pattern to othermythologies, including those of the Germans and the Celts. The first of the ‘threefunctions’ that he believed was apparent in their mythical world was that of theruler, showing itself in the control of magico-religious power on the one handand of law-giving on the other, sometimes represented by a pair of powerful gods.The second function was that of physical force, expressed by the warrior classin society. The third was concerned with the fertility of the earth and that ofanimals and mankind, represented by a number of deities, male and female; thiswas associated with the farming class and the country people in general, asopposed to aristocrats and rulers. In Ancient India, the first function wasembodied in the brahmin caste and the second in the warrior caste. The gods ofthe first function he took to be Varuna and Mitra, while the second function wasrepresented by Indra. The third class of farmers and workers on the land wasrepresented by the Ashvins and other deities, a group of supernatural beingsrather than single outstanding ones, and including the goddesses.When he examined Scandinavian tradition, Dumézil saw the first function asrepresented by Odin and Tyr (Germanic Wodan and Tîwaz). The first stood for"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE154power by magical and religious ceremonies, since Odin was a leader of the godsskilled in magic, while Tyr stood for rule by law. He saw Thor as resembling Indrain many ways, particularly in his use of force, represented by the thunder-weaponwith which he attacked the enemies of the gods. The third function would berepresented by the fertility powers, under the leadership of Freyr and Njord.Dumézil also used historical legends, such as those concerning the early kings ofRome or those of Denmark as recorded by Saxo Grammaticus, to extend the areaof his search. Rather surprisingly, he and his followers have made little use ofpossible evidence from iconography or archaeology, which might have helpedto establish his tripartite model (Mallory 1989:132).A major difficulty in accepting Dumézil’s theories as applied to the systemsof belief among Germans and Celts is that of complications in the case of themajor gods. Among the Scandinavians, Odin was undoubtedly the god of kingsand warriors, even though Thor was admittedly the champion of the divineworld. Thor, on the other hand, was the acknowledged patron of law andjustice; one might argue that he took over this function from Tyr, but there islittle firm evidence for this. On the Celtic side, the work of Sjoestedt has clearlydemonstrated that the Celts regarded their deities as many-skilled, so that it ishardly possible to divide them satisfactorily according to their separatefunctions, as can be done with the gods of Ancient Rome. Her interpretationis based on the evidence of the sources themselves and not on any dominanttheory, and she has given us one of the most illuminating studies of early Celticreligion. She felt that it was not possible to assume that there had once been aclearly defined Common Celtic religion, with easily recognizable gods andgoddesses, declaring that ‘What we know of the decentralized character ofsociety among the Celts, and of the local and anarchical character of theirmythology and ritual excludes that hypothesis’ (Sjoestedt 1982:4). The sameimpression of confusion and variety, making it difficult to fit the Germanic godsinto the required slots, is gained from the detailed survey of Germanic religionfrom the historical viewpoint which has been presented by de Vries (1957–8).A further problem that Dumézil at first left unsolved was that of thegoddesses, since to include them all vaguely with the deities of the third functionwas clearly unsatisfactory. However, he gradually became aware of theimportance of the goddess who was related to the gods of all three functions,and he defined her position in 1970 as ‘a goddess who synthesizes thesefunctions, who assumes and reconciles all three’ (Dumézil 1970:300). In arecent study, Archaic Cosmos (1990), Lyle suggests a further development ofthe work of Dumézil on the possible framework of early European religion.Dumézil deliberately omitted space and time from his system of triads,concentrating on the application of this to social groups, but other scholarshave extended his scheme and this she finds rewarding. The division into fouras well as into three was evidently of significance in the early European world-picture, as has been pointed out by the Rees brothers (1961:112 ff.). Lylesuggests that the fourth division was taken as standing for the whole, and this"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"THE INTERPRETERS155was presided over by the goddess, who would thus function as the deity of theentire people and not just of one particular social group (Lyle 1990:2).The division of horizontal space into four, each with its appropriate colour,had already been suggested by the Rees brothers and others. In Ancient India thecolour of the brahmin class was white, and that of the warrior class red. Lylesuggests that yellow was the colour of the food-producers, not black as had beenpreviously suggested, and that the dark colour blue/black was that of the goddess.If she indeed stood for the country or kingdom as a whole, this would accountfor the importance of the symbol of the sacred marriage, since on becoming kingthe ruler had to detach himself from the interests of any one class of society, andsee that all three were justly represented (Lyle 1990:16). Again, it might bepossible to equate three seasons of the year, spring, summer and winter, with thethree gods, while the fourth, autumn, would belong to the goddess who waslinked with all of them. At the main feast at the beginning of the new year atSamain or the Winter Nights (p. 88), the gods were honoured as a whole, and itwas at this time also that the feast to the goddesses was celebrated (p. 113). WhileDumézil insisted on the importance of his system for Indo-European peoples, Lylesuggests that it may not have been limited to them but was possibly an archaicfeature retained by the Indo-Europeans more fully than the rest.The importance of the goddess in early religion is emphasized from anotherangle by Gimbutas. She sees the Indo-Europeans as dominated by male warriorgods, but also as influenced in their beliefs by the earlier religion which she callsthat of Old Europe, where the goddess was the most powerful deity, dealing outlife and death. She claims that this earlier system, the existence of which sheattempts to prove by archaeological evidence and symbolism, prevailed over a largepart of Europe for a very long period of time (Gimbutas 1982:9 ff.; 1989:316 ff.).The weaknesses of her case and of other recent attempts to establish the goddessas the dominating figure in early religion have been pointed out by Hutton(1991:39 ff.). Clearly, it may help in the search for a lost religion if we take intoaccount some of the hypothetical theories for the structure and development ofearly religions in north-western Europe that have been put forward; but it isessential also for any real understanding of a lost religion not to neglect the historicapproach, arising out of the patient study of sources and of the social backgroundof the peoples whose religion we seek to recover from the past.OUTSIDE INFLUENCESIt was usual for those interested in the literature and religion of the past in thenineteenth century to have been trained in the classics, and to have firstencountered gods and goddesses and religious cult practices in the literature andart of Mediterranean countries. Consequently it has proved difficult to escapefrom the assumption that the same pattern of mythology must have prevailedamong Germans and Celts. Frazer began as a classicist, and so too did HectorMunro Chadwick, whose careful work was to have considerable influence on"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE156the study of early religions in northern Europe. His book The Heroic Age,published in 1912, broke new ground in showing the striking resemblancesbetween the subject-matter of the heroic poetry of the Germanic peoples and thatof Homer, in spite of the wide gap in time and the geographical distance betweenAncient Greece and northern Europe. The reason for this was that the way oflife and the ideals of men grouped in small warrior-bands under aristocraticleaders, and trained in the use of weapons for close fighting, was similar in bothcases, and thus produced the same kind of literature. This was in general oralliterature, recited at the courts of kings or noblemen; this, however, might latercome to be written down and to inspire more written literature of a similar kindwhen the time of upheaval and constant warfare was being replaced by settledkingdoms, and writing had been introduced by the Christian church.With his wife Nora, Hector Chadwick went on to study the maincharacteristics of oral poetry in different parts of the world, the result being thethree large volumes making up The Growth of Literature. Much of the literaturethey studied belonged to non-Christian cultures, and was bound to includetreatment of the supernatural world relevant for the study of early religion.Indeed, two early studies by Chadwick of Germanic and Scandinavian gods, ‘TheCult of Odin’ in 1899 and The Oak and the Thundergod’ in 1900, showed howmuch could be achieved by a fresh survey of written sources, including what wasreported by Greek and Latin writers of the religious practices of the northernbarbarians. He made no attempt to begin from any theory of myth, or to fit theevidence into the Roman pattern, nor did he assume that reports by Greek andLatin writers were necessarily reliable. This critical approach with an open mindis a great contrast to that of Frazer, whose findings Chadwick mistrusted becausehe had paid no attention to the varying nature of the sources which he used.Chadwick was ahead of many of his contemporaries in his readiness to uselocal history and archaeological evidence along with early written sources. HisOrigin of the English Nation, published in 1907, was the first serious study ofthe Anglo-Saxons in Britain before the coming of Christianity to include a surveyof their religious beliefs. He recognized that the powers of the main deities innorthern Europe were not clearly defined, and that the position was very differentfrom that in the Roman Empire, where a sophisticated state religion had beenestablished for the highly literate ruling class with a simple framework for theworking populace. To look for a similar framework among Germans and Celtsmight well lead us astray. As Sjoestedt pointed out some years ago: When we are tackling a strange mythology, we seek instinctively anOlympus where the gods abide, an Erebus, kingdom of the dead, ahierarchy of gods, specialized as patrons of war, of the arts, or of love.And, seeking them, we do not fail to find them.(1982:2) In her work on the Celts, she decided to proceed as though no Greek or Roman"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"THE INTERPRETERS157had ever visited Celtic territory, but to examine what they themselves had to sayof their past. Since Ireland never came under Roman rule, this was easier than itmight be in England or Gaul. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the influenceof Rome meets us at every point. Deities have been presented on carved stonesmainly in Roman fashion in the pre-Christian world of north-western Europe,while in Scandinavia the little bracteates with their protective magic based on thelore of the gods were imitated from Roman designs (p. 39). The sacred boar was afavourite Roman emblem, since it was the symbol of the Twentieth Legion. Thegreat silver dishes in the Sutton Hoo treasure with figures from classical mythologywere found alongside what seem to be sacred symbols of Germanic kingship,reminding us how motifs from southern Europe must have inevitably influencednorthern artists when they ornamented gifts or booty, and suggested new treatmentof their own native themes. On the literary side, the work of that ardent scholarSaxo Grammaticus, well-grounded in the latest teaching of European universitiesof the twelfth century, is a warning of how minor Latin works may have influencedthe presentation of native legends. His story of the golden statue of Odin in his firstbook, for instance, could well have been suggested by his familiarity with the workof Valerius Maximus, who refers to men stealing gold from statues of the gods(Davidson 1980:32). At the same time it is important to remember that suchborrowings may have been prompted in the first place by a resemblance alreadyexisting between the native and the classical tradition.It can be seen from the subjects of the pictures selected for the Franks Casket,the little box of whalebone ivory thought to have been made in the seventhcentury in Northumbria, that in the early Christian period the Anglo-Saxonsdeliberately compared native legends with tales from classical or Christiansources. On the box we are shown Romulus and Remus suckled by a she-wolf,the despoiling of the temple at Jerusalem by the Romans, and the nativity ofChrist, with the arrival of the Wise Men bearing gifts. These are joined withother scenes from native tradition: there is Egil the archer, a scene in a smithywhich appears to portray the legend of Weland, and a strange group includinga horse and a burial mound and what seem to be supernatural figures(Davidson 1969). Heroic scenes from foreign sources would naturally have astrong appeal, and in the case of the panel illustrating the Weland tale ofruthless vengeance, which resulted in the birth of a semi-divine child, the pictureof the Christ Child with his mother receiving the gifts of the Magi may havebeen deliberately placed beside it for contrast. New Christian traditions musthave influenced the telling of the old myths, and indeed some scholars likeSophus Bugge and Karl Krohn attempted to derive all the main Scandinavianmyths from Christian origins. Evidence available from archaeology andiconography is sufficient now to convince us that this was not the case, butsubtle Christian influences may often have affected the presentation of oldtales, just as appears to have happened in the early literature of ChristianIreland (McCone 1990:56). In recent years the emphasis in Beowulf studies hasincreasingly fallen on possible influences from learned Christian sources"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE158recognizable in the poem, so that less attention has been paid to it as a richsource of pre-Christian myth. On the other hand, the evidence for knowledgeof cremation funerals, the bear-like characteristics of the hero, the ship as asymbol of departure to another world, and the supernatural figures frombeneath the lake of Grendel and his mother, all of which are found in the poem,need not be rejected as without value for our knowledge of native tradition.Once learned material from foreign sources is recognized, however, itbecomes increasingly difficult to sort out early religious traditions. The earlyhistory of Ireland and traditions about invasions and the coming of the godshave been deliberately blended with Old Testament events and the history ofGreece and Rome, until it has become well-nigh impossible to unscramble it.In a less ambitious scheme writers of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle trace backtheir line of kings to Noah’s Ark or to Adam, much of this work being carriedout by antiquarians of the ninth century (Sisam 1953), who also bring in thepre-Christian gods for good measure. At the end of Voluspá the mighty rulerwho is to come may or may not be the Christian Christ, while ideas of theChristian heaven and hell seem to have left their mark on the picture of thecosmos that it gives. Resemblances between native and Christian tradition werecertainly obvious to the people responsible for raising memorial crosses in someearly Viking settlements in Britain, where scenes from Ragnarok and thecrucifixion of Christ were shown side by side (p. 50). The obvious similaritybetween Christ on the cross and Odin hanging on the tree does not mean,however, that the Odin tradition cannot be an independent one. The only wayto test this is to trace the motif in the north, and see how the idea of a sacrificehanging on a tree is likely to have formed part of the Odin cult. We have torecognize the power and long life of certain mythological symbols and motifs,which may be found in very different settings, since, as Jung claimed, they areinstinctively welcomed by the imaginative’ mind.Once we reach the Viking Age, we have also to be prepared for tales andmotifs from abroad being imported by Scandinavians returning from theirtravels to their homelands. The strong links that existed in the tenth andeleventh centuries between Scandinavia and south-eastern Europe, inparticular, meant that many tales and art motifs might be brought back bythose who had spent years in the Greek army or navy, travelling in the Caucasusarea, or meeting other travellers in the eastern markets includingConstantinople. Certain motifs like the bound Loki, writhing beneath greatrocks and causing earthquakes, or the great interest shown in the last greatbattle when the gods met the giants and the monsters and all were destroyed,may have been partially influenced by traditions from that region of Europe(Davidson 1976:313 ff.). Germans or Celts who came to Rome in the earliercenturies and to Constantinople in the Viking Age found themselves confrontedby conflicting religious teachings and practices, while they would encounter arich series of pictures and statues associated with the supernatural world. TheScandinavians were such gifted story-tellers that they could introduce foreign"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"THE INTERPRETERS159plots and motifs into their sagas very skilfully, placing them in a convincingnative setting, so that they seem like genuine Scandinavian traditions(Strömbäck 1971).Yet another possible direction from which influences might reach thereligion of Scandinavia is from the north, since they were in close contact withthe Saami and other Finno-Ugrian peoples further east. The central tree is onepossible motif that may have been influenced by the beliefs of such neighbours(p. 69). Certain elements in Scandinavian tradition suggest the influence ofshamanic beliefs and practices in the idea of travel between different worldsand of taking on animal form. Again, some of the tales of women practisingdivination in the sagas have marked resemblances to accounts of shamanicceremonies recorded in later times in northern Europe and Asia (p. 137). Suchideas may have come into Halogaland at the time when it was under the ruleof Jarl Hakon, the last pagan ruler of Norway, in the late tenth century. Theprogress made in the study of shamanism in recent years has made this apossibility worth considering.When we survey the possible complications and varied influences whichcould have affected pre-Christian religion in northern Europe, it is evident thatsuch ‘scientific proof as Strenski desired in his criticism of the theories of Eliade(p. 152) is hardly possible to provide. Nor is it yet possible to reach firmconclusions as to the religious beliefs and myths of the Indo-European peoplesfrom whom the Celts and Germans are descended. If the difficulties appearfrustrating, we can at least comfort ourselves with the thought that new andvaluable insights will undoubtedly be gained as the search goes on. Many newways of approach have been explored and fought over in the past, and there isevery hope of fresh understanding of the divine world of our ancestorsemerging from continued investigation of the written sources together withcareful study of pictures, symbols and archaeological finds. There is much leftto discover."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"160ConclusionIt is clear that there can never have been one simple period in early religion towhich we can confidently look back, a golden age of well-established ritualshared by all communities in the early days, as scholars once believed(Davidson 1963). There cannot be one simple key to the understanding ofsystems of belief; all religions must be subject to change and development overa vast period of time, influenced by both enemies and neighbours, and by thediffering needs of the people as their way of life changed, and roving warrior-tribes gradually settled into established kingdoms. A detailed historic surveyis necessary to check the tendency to depend on one prevailing theory, for theworld of beliefs is a complex one, however far we go back in time, and we arelimited to the confused and often contradictory evidence of fragments ofliterature, art and language, vague memory of former customs, and the richconfusion of local legends. Because this is to a large extent uncharted territory,there is a temptation to oversimplify wildly, to assume direct links betweenhorned figures or sacrificial rituals kept apart by centuries of time and changingmethods of living. One method of approach, favoured by both Frazer andEliade, is to see how the same patterns constantly recur, and to assume thattherefore definite outlines can be traced. Another is to proceed by detailed andhonest investigation of the sources, like Chadwick and de Vries, with therealization that nothing is ever simple and that tentative conclusions must bringfresh questions and uncertainties in their wake.Still, even if we have a long way to go before beginning to understand thethought-processes of those who told the myths and left us a handful of imagesof their supernatural world, the purpose of this survey has been to show howmuch material has in fact been left us to study, and the various ways in whichwe may go about it. The world of thought with which we have been dealing isthat belonging to the religion of the peoples of north-western Europe in thecourse of the Migration Period and the Viking Age, following the collapse ofthe Roman Empire and the formation of new kingdoms in western Europe,with occasional glimpses of religious practices in earlier periods. The peoplesunder scrutiny were subject to constant movement and turmoil, and this wasbound to affect their religious thought and imagery. The predominating patternis of a religion that has developed in a warrior society, with the king holding"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION161the dominant position both in the human world and also in relations with thegods. We know less concerning the other side of religious tradition, thatrepresented by the wise men, poets and diviners, sometimes supporting theroyal power and sometimes opposed to it. Nevertheless, there is weightyevidence for their influence on religion, and here the work of N.K.Chadwickon the early literature of Scandinavian and Celtic peoples is of great value inrestoring the balance.There is no doubt that certain patterns predominated, and were expressedin ritual and legend, varying according to local conditions and the chosenmethods of religious expression. The replacement of the familiar patterns bythe framework of the centralized Christian church must have been disruptingand painful to many. We know comparatively little of this revolution in thoughtand organization, with its appeal to central authority and refusal to tolerateother forms of belief, since it is Christians for the most part who have left usthe records. Obviously, there was always some possibility of continuity in thenew faith, as wise teachers like Pope Gregory realized and encouraged. Friendlysaints might replace the land-spirits, and guardian angels the protective beingsof the families; a calendar of Christian feasts, some on the same dates as theformer ones, continued to relieve the hard monotony of everyday life; lesscomfortably, the threat of Judgement Day succeeded that of Ragnarok. Christmight be seen in a familiar guise as the young child coming from another worldto save his people, or as a young warrior demanding allegiance, and his deathas lamented by the natural world, as with the old fertility gods. While the oralwisdom of the wise men and law-givers passed away in a few generations, thosewho desired to have contact with ancient wisdom were now offered entry intothe past world of written learning and the thoughts of holy men and womenstored in manuscripts, as well as the recorded learning of past civilizations.Meanwhile on a more popular level, the story-tellers and poets took over,using the old themes and half-recollected tales and legends of their forebears.Much of the former body of traditions and beliefs had been at that level in anycase, and could therefore survive, disorganized but stimulating, withcomparatively little alteration under the new establishment. The churchperiodically condemned various superstitious practices, indicating theircontinued life. Yet even the serious-minded John Milton in the seventeenthcentury was able to enjoy, along with imaginative pictures of the classical worldof legend, more homely tales of hobgoblins and spirits of the countrysidewithout feeling guilty or disloyal to his demanding creed. While folk traditionconstantly develops and changes, and must no longer be assumed to lead backin a direct line to a preChristian past, it shows us how certain customs andtraditions could quietly continue, along with the new store of approvedteaching about religion to which men now turned for enlightenment.So the search for a lost religion goes on, using of necessity a variety ofapproaches and many different roads.

It isuseless to attempt to recreate it as a living way of faith, as some have attemptedto do, relentlessly shutting their eyes to the problems and striving to see the oldreligion in clear lines and bright colours. The attempts of Nazi Germany torecreate a non-existent Aryan religion belonging to the heroic past and itshideous consequences should be sufficient warning against such attempts tocatch a fallen star and restore it to the heavens again. But such wisdom andsense of the numinous as can be found in any religion that has satisfied theaspirations and imaginative needs of men and women for thousands of years,and held communities together in a way that our divided faiths often fail to do,is surely worth seeking after, however long and arduous the quest."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"163BibliographyAckerman, R.
