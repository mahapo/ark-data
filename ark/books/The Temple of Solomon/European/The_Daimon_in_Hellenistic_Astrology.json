I feel very fortunate to have met so many who have been so generous with their time, knowledge and support. My first thanks must go to my Ph.D. supervisor at the Warburg Institute, Charles Burnett, whose impeccable scholarship, kindness, generosity and intellectual curiosity have been a model for me. Next I thank Francesca Rochberg, who promoted my work for the Magic and Divination Series at Brill, and who is not only a friend but an exemplar of scholarly ingenuity, resourcefulness and creativity. Third, I express great gratitude to Stephan Heilen, a leading scholar in the history of astrology today, for his friendship, stimulating discussions on arcane topics of astrology and assistance with Greek translation, which saved me from many an embarrassing error. He has also been a ready resource for manuscript pages when I needed them. Of those who have gone above and beyond in support, I must also thank Micah Ross, who has been my resource for Demotic material, is always willing to read drafts with a critical eye, and has provided advice on several of the chapters in this book.In addition to these fine scholars, I owe thanks and gratitude to those who have helped to supplement my knowledge and stimulate my thinking in fields both within and outside my areas of specific expertise. The interdisciplinary nature of this study required a steep learning curve. The expertise of those in related fields was essential, and the conversations with those in my field inval-uable. These include Joette Abry, Peter Adamson, Crystal Addey, Giuseppe Bezza, Bernadette Brady, Marcia Butchart, Nicholas Campion, Claire Chandler, Geoffrey Cornelius, Darby Costello, Joseph Crane, Patrick Curry, Susanne Denningmann, Leo Depuydt, Meira Epstein, Guido Giglioni, Joseph Greene, Liz Greene, Darrelyn Gunzburg, Bink Hallum, Robert Hand, Nadine Harris, Maggie Hyde, Joanna Komorowska, Marilynn Lawrence, Daryn Lehoux, Attilio Mastrocinque, Garry Phillipson, Robert Sharples, Harold Tarrant and James Wilberding. Naturally, any errors that remain in spite of their assistance and good advice are my own.I must also thank the anonymous readers at Brill for helpful advice and con-structive criticism. In addition I am grateful to Katelyn Chin, my editor at Brill, for all her help.Alexander Jones, Joachim F. Quack, James Wilberding and Andreas Winkler generously provided me with their unpublished texts. I thank them all.Thanks also goes to Nicholas Campion and the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, my employers, for providing access to electronic databases that make my life as a scholar much easier."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xiiacknowledgementsThe intellectual atmosphere at the Warburg Institute provides an amazing environment for research, and I thank my fellow students, colleagues and staff for their advice and support, especially Cornelia Linde and Ulrike Kern.

The deceptively simple phrase above is no exception. A mere three words in Greek, it has been variously translated as ‘Character is destiny’;2 ‘A man’s character is his fate’;3 ‘Man’s character is his daimon’;4 ‘A man’s individu-ality is his daimon’ and ‘A man’s character is the immortal and potentially divine part of him’;5 ‘Seine Eigenart ist dem Menschen sein Dämon (d.h. sein Geschick)’;6 ‘Character for man is destiny’;7 ‘A man’s character is his guard-ian divinity’;8 ‘Habit for man, god’.9 I do not claim to have come up with the definitive rendering here,10 but the variations are striking.1 Fr. B119, D-K, I, 177.2 The earliest usage of this phrase that I have been able to find, possibly translating Heraclitus via the German poet and novelist Novalis (1772–1801), is in G.

This is a rich, though intricate and tricky, amalgamation of ideas. These associations seem unique, but another subject takes up the same topics and incorporates them into its theory and practice.

I know of no research focused on looking at the actual practice of astrology in relation to the daimon. Furthermore, most scholars of astrology have never practised it and, even if well-intentioned,14 often do not see, or are unable to appreciate, points of technique which have great bearing on the way astrology uses the daimon and on how this use cre-ates and then affects its influence in other areas.Analysing ancient astrologers’ techniques, therefore, becomes an impor-tant investigative tool. Such analysis has uncovered scholarly gaps on the transmission of certain astrological practices, as well as important links from Mediterranean cultures (primarily Egyptian and Mesopotamian, but others as well) which illuminate the intention behind certain astrological practices and theory. I have discovered nuances in astrologers’ views of astrology and fate which contradict the monolithic assumption that astrology and its practition-ers are entirely fatalistic (such an assumption is usually taken by those opposed to astrology).15 Egyptian and Mesopotamian ideas of fate may influence astro-logical theory and practice. In examining the Neo-Platonist search for the per-sonal daimon through the eyes of its Neo-Platonist astrologer, Porphyry, I make a case for astrology as theurgical practice by Porphyry (in addition to clarifying the murky classifications of ‘house-masters’ in astrology). Many of the astro-logical texts I use are under-researched, and it has been my joy to discover how (Démons et merveilles d’Orient) (2001): 157–74; F. E. Brenk, In Mist Apparelled: Religious Themes in Plutarch’s Moralia and Lives (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1977); and S. I. Johnston and P. Struck, eds., Mantikê.

Rather than give only a partial list of this schol-arship, I note the Warburg Institute’s online database of the history of astrology at http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/?id=470, and the bibliography devoted to the topic of Greco-Roman astrology at http://webdeptos.uma.es/dep_griego/ASTROLOGIA.htm.14 Many are not, especially those of the early 20th century, though current attitudes have changed, particularly in the last 15 years.15 Here both ancient and modern critics are included."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Introduction4much they augment not only our understanding of the techniques of astrology, but also its highly complex and sophisticated theoretical underpinnings.Examining the intersections of the daimon with astrology enhances our knowledge from two directions: how the daimon is used within astrology, and how astrology is used in practices involving the daimon. It further broadens the ways in which fate was understood and incorporated into the cultural prac-tices of the Graeco-Roman era and Late Antiquity.2 The Multivalent δαίμων2.1 Usage and SpellingIt is important at the outset to explain the usage of the word ‘daimon’ in this book. Although the concept of the daimon itself includes a number of mean-ings, and translation can be varied, I generally prefer the spelling ‘daimon’ (not italicised).16 Its various connotations will not require a different spelling: meaning will be elucidated by qualifiers and explanation. There are two excep-tions to this policy. Because of its widely understood connotation in English, for a bad or evil daimon I may use ‘demon’ without a qualifier. To avoid ambi-guity and when otherwise appropriate, I retain the word δαίμων in Greek script, or daemon in a Latin context.2.2 Understanding ‘Daimon’The concept of the daimon is multivalent and mutable in all Mediterranean cultures. Mesopotamian and Egyptian cultures do not necessarily differentiate between ‘god’ and ‘daimon’ as understood in the West. Both contain the equiv-alent of what is often described by scholars as a genie or a demon, depending on its positive or negative functions and relative strength in comparison to ‘gods’. But there is often no distinction between a ‘god’ and a ‘daimon’: both can be called by the name ‘god’. Thus, equivalence with the parameters of a Greek δαίμων must not be assumed; even though there may be similarities in func-tions, each culture has its own idiosyncrasies for these beings.Even in Greece, the daimon cannot be contained within strict functional constructs. From Homer onward, the daimon’s multivalence has led to a myr-iad of translations to explain it in context: demon, spirit, genius, personal-ity, destiny, power, even fate. Defining the daimon has always been difficult, 16 Often ‘daimon’ and ‘daimones’ are italicised as transliterated Greek words in the scholar-ship of Classics, Philosophy and Religion. I prefer ‘daimon’ and ‘daimons’, partly to nor-malise this spelling in English and partly because of aesthetics in the book."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Introduction 5though today’s connotation of a ‘demon’ only as an evil spirit has replaced ear-lier, less rigid, ones. In Homer, Elisabeth Brunius-Nilsson has shown that, far from having an automatic negative connotation, δαίμων can be considered to be both a divine force17 and to have an ambivalent, neutral sense which can only be understood as good or evil in context.18 Hesiod’s daimons, the souls of departed Golden and Silver Age mortals, were purely good.19 Other daimons were malevolent.20 Popular culture always took account of local spirits, either good or bad, and made sure to propitiate them; and spirits (called daimons or other names) have long been connected with illness, madness and death. From Plato two enduring ideas—first, that daimons are mediators between gods and humans; and second, that everyone has a personal daimon guiding them through life—took root and spread through the culture of the Mediterranean from the Hellenistic period to Late Antiquity.This brief preliminary description of ‘daimon’ serves to introduce the vari-ous modes of daimon in Mediterranean cultures which will be explored in their relationship to astrology in this work. More elaborate treatment will arise organically within each chapter.3 Astrology and the DaimonThe area and time in which western astrology arose was the Mediterranean basin in, roughly, the second half of the first millennium BCE. This milieu contained the cultures which contributed to astrological practices: primarily Babylonian, Egyptian and Greek, with some Persian influences. By the close of the millennium Greek had become an important vector language for astro-logical texts, although the concepts and practices used in astrology often drew from other cultures.21 Thus, though I use the term ‘Hellenistic astrology’ in this 17 E.

Hellenistic astrol-ogy was not immune to multiple conceptions of the daimonic, not only from Greek, but also from Babylonian, Egyptian and other cultures, and from reli-gious and magical practices. One might assume that, as a practice, astrology would be primarily concerned with explaining or predicting the effects of bad daimons. This is partially true, but good daimons were equally important, and so was the idea of a personal daimon both discernible in the chart and even, for some, responsible for the particular arrangement of heavenly bodies and relevant points within the chart.22 Furthermore, the daimon is entwined not only with the practice, but with the theory and philosophy behind Hellenistic astrology. Astrology, in fact, is highly dependent on religious and philosophical conceptions of the daimon. This can be seen in a number of different areas which we will now briefly introduce.3.1 Daimon in the Astrological PlacesThe astrological chart is drawn up, and its data discovered, for a particular moment in time, but its fundamental layout is fixed. The chart is divided into twelve sections (called τόποι, ‘places’), each correlated with an area of life. Two of the sections are named ‘Good Daimon’ and ‘Bad Daimon’; thus one-sixth of the chart represents the daimon and what is attributed to it. Furthermore, and importantly, the places opposite to these are called ‘Good Fortune’ and ‘Bad Fortune’. This is not accidental. As we shall repeatedly see in this book, Daimon and Fortune (Tyche) are often culturally, religiously and philosophically paired.23 Indeed, they often cannot be separated.D. G. Greenbaum and M. T. Ross, ‘The Role of Egypt in the Development of the Horoscope’, in Egypt in Transition: Social and Religious Development of Egypt in the First Millennium BCE, ed.

Lots are specific points in the chart, found by taking the arc between two planets (or a planet and another point) and projecting it from a third point.24 (For further explanation, and a primer on Hellenistic astrological technique, see Appendix I.A, Basic Astrological Techniques.) The two most important lots are the Lot of Fortune (τύχη) and the Lot of Daimon (δαίμων).25 These two lots are linked to each other by the way they are formed—projecting the arc between the Sun and Moon from the Ascendant (the degree rising on the eastern horizon at the time of birth), but in reverse order; thus they are mirror images of each other. The Lots of Fortune and Daimon are not seen as producing, or signifying, either solely 24 Lots are known by a misnomer in modern astrology as ‘Arabic’ parts—translating the Latin pars—though they have a prominent role in Hellenistic astrology.25 Fortune is ‘the archetypal lot’: Vettius Valens, Anthology, II, 13.1 (Pingree, 65.5): . . . τὸν ἀρχέτυπον κλῆρον. . . .

Fortune signifies the body, physical well-being and literal fortune, the acqui-sition of goods; Daimon the soul, character and reputation;27 but sometimes the two lots could even have the same meanings.28 The Lot of Fortune is the Moon’s lot, and the Lot of Daimon the Sun’s.2926 Whether they predict good or bad outcomes is dependent on where they are placed, their rulers and their aspects. (The issue of cause versus sign will not be discussed here.)27 See Paulus Alexandrinus, Introduction, ch. 23; Olympiodorus, Commentary on Paulus, ch. 22; Antiochus of Athens/Rhetorius (copying Paulus), Thesaurus 47; Valens, II, 21.28 Antiochus/Rhetorius (Paulus), Thesaurus 47, CCAG I, 160.12–16: Σελήνης ὁ κλῆρος τῆς τύχης σημαίνει πάντα τὰ ἐπὶ τοῦ σώματος τῶν ἀνθρώπων καὶ τὰς κατὰ τὸν βίον πράξεις καὶ δόξας καὶ τὰ τῆς ψυχῆς πάθη καὶ τὰς συμβιώσεις.

The Sun’s Lot—the Lot of Daimon—signifies things concerning the soul, character, power, worth, reputation and religious rites.’) It is fairly typical in astrology that opposing pairs can have similar meanings.29 Ibid.FIGURE I.2 The Lots of Fortune and Daimon in a chart."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Introduction 9Many Hellenistic astrologers who write in detail about lots mention both the Lot of Fortune and the Lot of Daimon.30 The lots are used in calculating length of life, in predicting happiness (eudaimonia, literally having a good daimon) and in predicting the good and bad periods of a life.31 As the second-century astrologer Vettius Valens explains, ‘One must cast out from [i.e., use as a predic-tion point] the Lots of Fortune, Daimon, Eros and Necessity,32 for the experi-ences aligned to the times—both the good activities and the dangers—will be taken over from these.’333.3 Astrology and the Personal DaimonAstrology is also utilised in the search for identifying a personal daimon. In sources as disparate as the Magical Papyri and Neo-Platonic writings, the per-sonal daimon is an important topic of discussion. Spells in the Magical Papyri give instructions for finding a personal daimon, linked to the petitioner’s own astrological configuration (PGM XIII.708–14); invocations are made to a ‘Good Daimon’ who is represented by the Sun (PGM VII.505–528); and entreaties are composed to the Good Daimon where a pre-ordained fate can seemingly be changed by changing the astrological data (PGM XIII.608–614, 633–637, 708–714). For Neo-Platonists such as Plotinus,34 Iamblichus35 and Porphyry,36 the personal daimon plays a part in the struggle to help the soul ascend to the divine. Astrology becomes controversial in this attempt, embroiled as it is in concerns with fate, freedom and the ability to transcend the material world.3.4 Astrology, the Daimon and FateThe well-known relationship between daimons and fate is at times closely connected with astrology and the courses of the stars. In his essay What is Up to Us, Porphyry explains how the daimon synchronises with particular astral configurations at the moment of birth. In the Hermetica, daimons also link 30 Including Dorotheus, Valens, Antiochus, Paulus, Hephaestio, Firmicus Maternus, Olym-piodorus and Rhetorius.31 Most astrologers deal with length of life, including Ptolemy, Valens, Dorotheus, Paulus and Hephaestio; Valens deals with happiness in II, 17–18, 20–22; and good and bad periods in IV, 4–10; 11, 25.32 Two other lots related to Fortune and Daimon; see Chapter 10.33 Valens IV, 11.32 (Pingree, 165.25–7): καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ κλήρου τῆς τύχης δεῖ ἐκβάλλειν καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ δαίμονος καὶ ἔρωτος καὶ ἀνάγκης· ἐκ τούτων γὰρ καὶ τὰ καιρικὰ πάθη καὶ αἱ εὐεργεσίαι καὶ οἱ κίνδυνοι παραλαμβάνονται.34 Enneads II, 3; III, 4.35 De mysteriis IX.1–3, 5–10.36 Letter to Anebo 2, 14–17 (Sodano)."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Introduction10with the stars. The regular movements of the planets and stars in heaven are used as indicators of time, a time that is thus bound to and indicative of the material world of generation and corruption. The stars are seen as gods or dai-monic beings who oversee the fate thereby engendered. As administrators and overseers of time and fate, they hark back to the Egyptian decans, thirty-six star groups that rise at consecutive ten-day intervals and regulate not only the passage of time but the behaviour of humans. Decans also appear in astrology.Astrology has long been associated with human fate as well, often in terms which assume the principles of Greek fate, often a hard determinism (I use the phrase of modern scholarship here) or even fatalism, although some recent scholarship discusses its compatibility with soft determinism based particu-larly on Stoic ideas.37 Though I am leery of applying anachronistic terminology too freely, certainly it is important to differentiate among various kinds of fate. Most scholarship considering fate and astrology has heretofore concentrated primarily on the relationship of Greek concepts of fate to astrology,38 but I shall also explore the important connections of Egyptian and Mesopotamian fate to Hellenistic astrology in this book. In many cases these versions of fate conform better to what is actually happening in the practice of astrology in the Mediterranean oikoumenē.Astrology is linked to the bad daimon in the tenets of early Judaism and Christianity, held to be the creation of evil daimons who desire to deceive and corrupt mankind.39 Such entanglement plays a role in the demonisation of the daimon which rose to become the dominant paradigm by the Middle Ages. Still, the daimon has undergone periods of rehabilitation, e.g. in the Renaissance by Marsilio Ficino40 and in the twentieth century by Carl Jung41 and James Hillman.4237 A. A. Long uses the terms ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ astrology: see A. A. Long, ‘Astrology: arguments pro and contra’, in Science and Speculation: Studies in Hellenistic theory and practice, ed. Jonathan Barnes, et al. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982); R. J. Hankinson speaks of ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ astrology: R. J.

Thus I approach it first from a general, introductory viewpoint which supplies broad definitions and historical con-text. These outer layers set the stage and provide a foundation of knowledge, while inner layers provide more detailed and specialised work as the book pro-gresses. I shall, therefore, revisit various topics to explore them in more depth. Concepts only outlined in one part of the book will be fleshed out in greater detail and complexity in another.The work covers several broad areas: daimon and its relationship to fortune, its relationship to gods, and its relationship to lots. Accordingly, the book will be divided into three parts: 1) Daimon and Fortune, 2) Gods and Daimons, and 3) Lots and the Daimon. Each of the ten chapters will fall into one of these areas. Under these broad areas, different topics will be addressed within the main theme of each chapter, which allows me to examine how the daimon is incorporated within astrology’s theory and practice correlated with the wider cultural milieu.4.1 The Contents of the ChaptersIn Part 1, Daimon and Fortune, Chapter One will introduce the topics of dai-mon, fortune and astrology through two representative authors from the sec-ond century CE: Plutarch (for the daimon) and Vettius Valens (for astrology). Not coincidentally, the second century is a crucial time both for concepts of daimon and for the theory and practice of astrology. Each of these writers has much to convey about the ways in which daimon and astrology permeate the culture, and the ways in which they interact with each other. This study of Plutarch and Valens highlights the major theme of fate and free will linked to astrology and daimons which continues throughout the book. We shall also get a first taste of what it means to have a personal daimon.Chapters Two and Three take up the astrological places of Good Daimon and Good Fortune, along with discussing these concepts culturally. In Chapter Four, the same treatment is given to the places of Bad Fortune and Bad Daimon.Chapter Two introduces the cultural pair of Tyche and Daimon, and con-siders the good daimon in astrological and cultural manifestations.

Mesopotamian conceptions of fate and equivalents of good daimons are discussed in relationship to Egyptian and Greek ideas. These topics lead to a consideration of fate and its perception within and outside of astrology.In Chapter Four the bad daimon and its places are investigated. An overview of bad daimons in the Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Greek, Jewish and Christian traditions gives a backdrop for the context in which I discuss astrologers’ views of the bad daimon, and what impact the cultural conceptions of bad daimons may have had on this part of astrological theory and practice. This chapter includes a study of the sixth and twelfth astrological places, Bad Fortune and Bad Daimon.Part 2, Gods and Daimons, looks at astrology and the daimon through the lens of the similarities, differences and fluidity between gods and daimons. Chapter Five approaches this from the religious perspectives mainly of Gnosticism and Mithraism; and Chapter Six from examining Hermetic and magical texts, and lore on the decans. Ambivalence is a theme in these chapters. The daimons considered here can either help or hinder humans, especially in magical and religious practices, and can be perceived as both good and evil. Ambivalence also covers the role of daimons who are on the margins of the line between god and daimon, who may cross that line or whose status is fluid.Chapter Seven, the final chapter in Part 2, is devoted to the personal daimon and astrology, again dealing with the god/daimon divide. Here the focus is on Porphyry,43 but around him hover the figures of Plotinus, Iamblichus and all the astrologers who discuss the topic of the oikodespotēs, the ‘house-master’ associated by Porphyry with the personal daimon. Porphyry’s interest both in daimons and astrology makes him a perfect candidate for an extensive case study. Within this chapter I also investigate how other astrologers defined and used the oikodespotēs compared to the way Porphyry uses it.Part 3, Lots and the Daimon, covers the critical relationship among lots, the daimon and astrology. Chapter Eight introduces the daimon and the lot, begin-ning from the vantage point of Plato’s Myth of Er. It also introduces the general concept of lots in astrology, and investigates the way they are utilised in astro-logical theory and practice. Here will be found the influence of other divina-tory practices on astrology, reflecting its own origins in divination. Chapters Nine and Ten are extended studies of four important astrological lots: Fortune 43 As this book was about to go to press, I came across A. P.

The categories described here cannot always be strictly differentiated, and there will sometimes be overlap between topics and themes from chapter to chapter. Though I often distinguish between ‘cultural’ practices and ‘astrological’ ones, this is a purely convenient way to examine a large amount of material. In no way is it my position that ‘culture’ and ‘astrology’ are or should be separated. In fact, I consider astrology to be an integral component of culture in the period under investigation. To that end, I hope this book will shine a light on the importance of both astrology and the daimon in the ancient Mediterranean world."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Part 1Daimon and Fortune∵"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���6 | doi ��.��63/9789004306��9_003CHAPTER 1Kindled Spirits: The Daimon, Plutarch and Vettius Valens. . . those possessed by some special, daimonic . . . luminosity.Plutarch, De genio Socratis, 589c3–41The daimon played an important cultural role in the Greco-Roman world. In the second century, particularly, there was a widening interest in daimons and their place in the cosmic hierarchy as well as on earth. As intermediaries between gods and humans, as well as in their capacity as personal guides, dai-mons interacted with humans on several different levels.Astrology, too, was in a stage of fruitful development in the second century (this is the century of Ptolemy, Vettius Valens and [probably] Antiochus of Athens). It was accepted and acceptable (not by everyone, of course) not only at the popular level, but also at a more sophisticated intellectual and philo-sophical level, incorporating ideas of Plato and the Academy, the Pythagoreans, the Stoics, the Aristotelians and the Hermetists.Because the second century is so rich in material on both the daimon and astrology, it is a fitting place to launch our investigation. The way in will be through the work of two important figures of this period, Plutarch of Chaeronea (ca. 46–ca. 120) and Vettius Valens of Antioch (b. 120, fl. 145–170).2 I have chosen 1 . . . οἷς ἔπεστιν ἴδιόν τι καὶ δαιμόνιον . . . φέγγος.

Brenk, In Mist Apparelled; idem, ‘In the Light of the Moon: Demonology’, 2068–2145 for a partial list (pertaining to his daimonology). For Valens, obviously, there is not as much; but he is men-tioned in most histories of astrology. Boll calls him ‘streitbare . . . ein plebejischer Mann von mäßigem Verstande’: F. Boll, C. Bezold, and W. Gundel, Sternglaube und Sterndeutung: Die Geschichte und das Wesen der Astrologie, 3rd ed. (Leipzig/Berlin: B. G. Teubner, 1926), 28.

His writ-ings transmitted and amplified the cultural and philosophical zeitgeist. Most importantly, a number of his essays dealt with various concepts and permuta-tions of the daimon. The astrologer Vettius Valens was born at about the time that Plutarch died. His work as a practising astrologer with some knowledge of his day’s philosophical trends makes him a fitting candidate for this intro-duction. In addition, though Plutarch and Valens cannot be linked directly, cir-cumstantial evidence shows that topics represented in the Chaeronean’s work were relevant to Valens’ interests, and will be explored below.Valens’ nine books of astrology, the Anthologiae, give both a comprehensive view of second century astrology and the philosophical and religious inclina-tions of their author. We are similarly enlightened on Plutarch’s religious and philosophical views (he was a priest at Delphi as well as a Platonist philoso-pher) by his Moralia which, fortunately for our purposes, provide a fascinating portrait of his daimonology. Plutarch’s work on this topic presents multiple concepts of the daimon as understood in the Greco-Roman period.3 Though our introduction can necessarily be no more than a brief encounter with Plutarch’s daimons, it will help in seeing how his views may reflect the use of the daimon in astrology; and how the philosophy of astrology may parallel, or coincide with, or anticipate these views.

In addition, connections with the concept of fate and the daimon’s intersection with it, on the parts of both Plutarch and Valens, will surface during this examination. Fate and the daimon in connec-tion to Hellenistic astrology will become a recurring theme in this book.1 Plutarch and the Daimon1.1 Fear of the DaimonPlutarch’s daimonology is transmitted in several of his Moralia, and daimons also appear in some of his Parallel Lives.4 In an early work, On Superstition (Περὶ δεισιδαιμονίας),5 Plutarch explains the superstitious man as one who over-reacts to bad events in his life, blaming his impiety and being hated by both gods and daimons (168c10–11).6 That Plutarch himself believed in a personal guiding daimon such as Plato describes,7 there is no doubt; like many others, though, he also acknowledged the presence of evil daimons who could sway people into less than virtuous behaviour. Δεισιδαιμονία is, literally, fear of the daimon.8 The superstitious man, with too much fear, or misplaced fear, of the divine (or divine retribution?) may translate his fear into what are seen as evil promptings by daimons or gods. Perhaps his fear interferes with his ability to make correct choices, to the point of acting badly or supersti-tiously from fear. In contrast to the negativity of δεισιδαιμονία the Greek word 4 Some essays in the Moralia which mention daimons are On Superstition, On Isis and Osiris, On the Delays of Divine Vengeance, On the Sign of Socrates, On the Face in the Orb of the Moon and On the Obsolescence of Oracles. Lives which mention daimons include Pelopidas, Dion, Brutus, Cato the younger, Alexander, Sulla, Pompey, Crassus, Timoleon, Antony and Philopoimen. For daimōn (as well as tuchē) in the Lives and the Moralia, see Brenk, In Mist Apparelled, ch. 8.5 See Plutarch, De superstitione, trans. Frank Cole Babbitt, in Moralia, II (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1928, repr. 2002). It is generally agreed that On Superstition is an early work. See K. Ziegler, ‘Plutarchos, II 3, Chronologie’, in RE, Zweite Reihe, Band XXI.1 (Stuttgart: Metzler, 1951), cols 708–719; C. P.

Daimons are mediators between gods and humans11 and as such they, not gods, inhabit the oracles. The daimon of the oracle is like the Platonic conception of the daimon, i.e. between divine and mortal. Oracles are part of nature, mani-fested in matter (ὕλη) and therefore not immortal, and so can decline and pass away. The gods themselves do not go into the bodies of the prophets and use them as instruments (414d–e)—for this was created the ‘race of daimons’ (τὸ τῶν δαιμόνων γένος) (415a), who are ‘ministers of the gods’ and ‘overseers of the sacred rites of the gods and prompters in the Mysteries’ (417a).12 As intermedi-aries, daimons can mediate between the divine and immortal and the human and mortal, can interpret between gods and humans (and it is a two-way street, both from gods to humans and from humans to gods). With their ‘interpretive and ministering nature’,13 and as divinatory messengers, daimons provide ways 9 Dodds, Greeks and the Irrational, 42, claims that eudaimōn first appears in Hesiod; kako­daimōn and dusdaimōn do not appear until the 5th century BCE. Deisidaimon­, according to the TLG, first appears in Aeschylus. See also W. C. Greene, Moira: Fate, Good and Evil in Greek Thought (New York/Evanston: Harper and Row, 1944, repr. 1963), 324–25: the impor-tance of eudaimonia, Greene reminds us, is taken up by Aristotle, in both his Nicomachean Ethics (1097a–b) and, with a possible source in daimonic favour, in his Eudemian Ethics (1214a).10 This is not the place for further analysis, but note that the word Plutarch uses for the ‘abandonment’ or ‘decline’ of the oracles derives from the same verb, ἐκλείπω, whose astronomical meaning is ‘eclipse’.11 On this topic see Timotin, Démonologie, Ch. 3, esp. 37–46, 74–84, who weaves a coherent structure of intermediation, applied especially to the daimon, among Plato’s dialogues.12 Plutarch, De defectu oraculorum, trans. Frank Cole Babbitt, in Moralia, V (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1936, repr. 2003), 417a8–11: . . . λειτουργοῖς θεῶν . . . δαίμονας νομίζωμεν ἐπισκόπους θεῶν ἱερῶν καὶ μυστηρίων ὀργιαστάς. . . . Daimons are called leitourgoi in Hermetic and Gnostic texts, and associated with decans. See Chapter 6.13 416f: τὴν ἑρμηνευτικὴν . . . καὶ διακονικὴν . . . φύσιν. Plato’s words (Symposium 202e [Burnet, vol. 2]) are slightly different: the daimon possesses the power of ἑρμηνεῦον καὶ διαπορθμεῦον, ‘interpreting and transporting’ human things to gods and divine things to humans.

Furthermore, without daimons the order of the cosmos would be disrupted (416f ).14Daimons are particularly linked with the moon in Plutarch’s schemes (see De defectu 416e, De facie 944c and De genio Socratis 591b–c). The gods are like the sun and stars, but the daimon is like the moon, halfway between the earth and the heavens. If the sun corresponds to a god, then the moon, as an inter-mediary, transmits this solar divine light to the earth/mortals. We cannot look at the sun directly for more than an instant for fear of going blind, but we can easily look at the light of the moon. Parallels in astrological literature reflect these views. The astrological Moon also ministers, ‘being nearer to the earth, receiving the effluences of the stars above her and ministering (διακονοῦσα)15 to the places surrounding the earth, she rules over the entire human body.’16 In Vettius Valens, the astrological Sun signifies ‘kingship, leadership . . . judge-ment . . . popular authority . . . master . . .’,17 The ninth place is that of the Sun God, the third that of the Moon Goddess.1.3 Socrates’ DaimonAnother important essay for Plutarch’s daimonology is De genio Socratis (Περὶ τοῦ Σωκράτους δαιμονίου), often translated as On the Sign of Socrates.18 (The 14 Ibid., 388–89: . . . οἱ δαιμόνων γένος μὴ ἀπολείποντες . . . πᾶντα φύρειν ἅμα καὶ ταράττειν ἀναγκάζουσιν ἡμᾶς . . .’. ‘. . . those who refuse to leave us the race of daimons . . . force us to a disorderly confusion of all things. . . .’ (Trans. Babbitt, slightly modified.) This may show a connection between daimons, time and the creation of order (see below, 3.5, 44), or just that daimons are essential to cosmic order. Timaeus 37d describes the chronos that came into being when cosmos arose from chaos, but Cleombrotus’s statement seems to imply that without the mediating presence of daimons disorder would arise again. In Platonic Questions 1007c–e and The Generation of the Soul in the Timaeus 1014b, Plutarch refers to disorderly time or movement before the cosmos was created; F. E. Brenk, ‘Time as Structure in Plutarch’s The Daimonion of Sokrates’, in Relighting the Souls: Studies in Plutarch, in Greek Literature, Religion and Philosophy, and in the New Testament Background, ed. Frederick E. Brenk (Stuttgart: F. Steiner, 1998), 59–81, here 74, cites these passages (but with a different goal in mind).15 Note that this is the same word (in verbal form) as the ‘ministering’ mentioned by Cleombrotus at 416f: . . . τὴν ἑρμηνευτικὴν . . . καὶ διακονικὴν . . . φύσιν. . . .16 Antiochus, Thesaurus, CCAG VII, 127.24–26: Ἡ δὲ Σελήνη προσγειοτέρα οὖσα τὰς ἀπορροίας τῶν ἄνωθεν αὐτῆς δεχομένη ἀστέρων καὶ διακονοῦσα πρὸς τὰ περίγεια, ἄρχει τοῦ ἀνθρωπίνου σώματος παντός.17 Valens, I, 1.1 (Pingree, 1.5–7): [sc. ὁ Ἥλιος] σημαίνει . . . βασιλείαν, ἡγεμονίαν . . . κρίσιν . . . προστασίαν ὀχλικήν . . . δεσπότην. . . . 18 Translating daimonion as ‘divine sign’ may stem from Plato’s Apology 40b, where the manifestation of the daimonion is called ‘the sign of the god’ (τὸ τοῦ θεοῦ σημεῖον)."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"22CHAPTER 1Latin equivalent of δαίμων is given as genius, with which the Greek δαίμων had commonalities, although was not identical.)19 Plutarch compares Socrates’ daimonion to Athena in the Iliad, as something that ‘alone “showed him the way, illumining his path”, in matters obscure and non-logical to human under-standing (φρόνησις)’ (580d).20 Thus the daimonic illumines—like the astrolog-ical Sun and Moon, the luminaries, who rule sight (physical and mental [in]sight), eyes and foreknowing (pronoia).21 The Sun and the Lot of Daimon are instruments of this particular illumination, both signifying φρόνησις (which may be described not only as ‘understanding’ but as ‘intentional mind’).22 Plato’s Epistle VII says that when one acquires phronēsis, along with nous, it ‘bursts out in a light’ (344b7).23The daimon brings us what we already know, which only needs to be brought to consciousness and light, which the daimon can provide.

Russell suggests Plutarch’s choice of the name ‘Timarchus’ comes from a character in Theages 129a; De Lacy-Einarson suggest the name mimics Plutarch’s own. De Lacy-Einarson and Vernière, Symboles et Mythes, 94, 105, note that both Timarchus and Plutarch are Chaeronean/Boeotian. One could also speculate that ‘Timarchus of Chaeronea’ amalgamates ‘Timaeus’ and ‘Plutarchus of Chaeronea’.28 There are disagreements about whether the voice is that of a daimon. For example, Finamore, ‘Plutarch and Apuleius’, 47 and n. 53, thinks its origin is uncertain; in Nesselrath, ed., Plutarch On the daimonion, Russell, 95, n. 215, and Deuse, 191, declare it a lunar dai-mon. I wonder if the ‘voice’ is meant to recall the voice of Socrates’ daimonion.29 Greek παλλομένους, which in this middle form means precisely ‘draw’ or ‘cast’ lots, refer-ring to the shaking of the lots before they are cast (LSJ, s.v. πάλλω). In the Myth of Er (Republic 617d-e), the souls choose their daimon in an order determined by lot. Using πάλλω here in connection to the stars/daimons may thus be intentional. Modern etymol-ogy (Chantraine, Tome I, 246–47; Frisk, Band I, 340–41) gives possible derivation of δαίμων from δαίομαι, allot, divide. We could compare the shaking of the dice to humans shaking, both outwardly and inwardly (the flutter in the stomach) when they are about to make a decision.30 A.

This nous/daimon resides in the highest part of the soul (591e).32Timarchus sees that some stars bob about evenly, but some twist and turn and cannot hold a steady course. The souls ruled by their passions are the ones that are twisting, while those which consent to be ruled by their nous/daimon keep an even course. These are the souls that follow their per-sonal daimon (οἰκεῖος δαίμων) from birth (592c) and are rewarded by its aid (594a). The straightness of the obedient soul’s path, and the twisting of the passionate one’s, is analogous, in astronomy, to the steady course of the sun in diurnal motion, and the moon’s more wandering course, which changes in speed, latitude and proximity to earth as it makes its revolution.The Moirai make an appearance here (591b), as Plutarch puts them in charge of certain regions of the cosmos: Atropos at the border of the fixed stars (where the Monad links life and motion), Clotho on the Sun (where nous links motion and birth), Lachesis on the Moon (where Nature [phusis] links birth and decay).1.4 Where Daimons Dwell: The Face in the MoonVettius Valens calls the Sun the light of the mind and the instrument of the soul’s sense-perception.33 He says that the Moon, ‘born from the reflection of 32 An idea commonly agreed to derive from Timaeus 90a: see W.

Plutarch ascribes that observation to Empedocles35 in De facie quae in orbe lunae apparet. This essay, an elaborate eschatology of the cosmos and the moon’s place within it, again places daimons as inhabitants of the moon (944c–e). The moon is said to be a part of the aither, that highest part of air (943d, e).36 (In the Epinomis, some, but not all, daimons also inhabit the aither.37 As Valens notes, quoting Orpheus: ‘A human soul is rooted in aither.’38) Purified souls, especially those who have moved the straightest in life, stay here and become daimons. The moon is a repository for souls and is ruled by Persephone. (There are simi-larities with De genio Socratis here.)39 Humans are composed of three parts: body, furnished by the earth; soul, furnished by the moon; and mind (nous) furnished by the sun, just as it furnishes light to the moon (943a).4034 Valens, I, 1.4 (Pingree, 1.14–16): <Ἡ> δὲ Σελήνη γενομένη μὲν ἐκ τῆς ἀντανακλάσεως τοῦ ἡλιακοῦ φωτὸς . . . σημαίνει μὲν κατὰ γένεσιν ἀνθρώποις ζωήν, σῶμα. . . .35 At 929e Plutarch says (Cherniss’s translation): ‘There remains the theory of Empedocles that the moonlight which we see comes from the moon’s reflection of the sun’; then quoting Empedocles: ‘ “Thus, having struck the moon’s broad disk, the ray” comes to us in a refluence weak and faint . . .’ (see Empedocles, Frag.

A variation on this theme also appears in astrology, where the Sun represents nous and daimon, and the Moon body and fortune.42 As (respectively) the lots of the Moon and Sun, the Lots of Fortune and Daimon expand these designations.43 The Fortune lot combines De facie’s functions of the earth and the Moon, since its concerns are with the body and what happens to it in the physical world; the Daimon lot combines the functions of De facie’s Sun and Moon, ruling over matters concerning both mind and soul.44In the astrological praxis of these lots, which may be performed for purely mundane reasons, is a tangible demonstration of philosophical and even reli-gious principles behind their formation. Both in astrology and in Plutarch, the pairs of sun and moon, and the triads of mind, soul and body amalgamate into systems reflecting similar sensibilities.

Both of De genio’s assignments involve birth, but one (Clotho) highlights the connections between (heavenly) movement and birth, while the other (Lachesis) emphasises the result of earthly incarnation (decay following birth).

(See Chapter Six for more on Hermetism and daimons.) Fate manifests, or becomes ‘actual’ in the world by ‘enclos[ing] all events in a cycle, and it is ‘not infinite but finite, for neither a law (νόμος) nor a formula (λόγος) nor anything divine can be infinite’ (569a, my italics).52 Time, shown in the movement of the ‘eight revolutions’ (the planets and fixed stars), is also ‘definite and knowable’ (ὡρισμένος . . . καὶ Neoplatonic Studies.

The ‘distinctive’ (to use Dillon’s word in Middle Platonists, 320) ideas expressed in this essay about the three forms of fate and providence may come out of Athenian scholasticism of the early 2nd century, or the (as yet uncertain) teacher(s) of Apuleius: see Dillon, Middle Platonists, 320, 338. Calcidius (Commentary on Timaeus 143a–144a), Nemesius (On the Nature of Man 43) and Apuleius (De Platone I, 12) also write of this schema in the 4th and 2nd centuries; again see Dillon, Middle Platonists, 294–96, 320–26.

Though all is contained in fate (in that fate itself is a container), not everything ‘conforms to fate’ (καθ’ εἱμαρμένην) (570b–d).55 Pronoia, in fact, can supersede heimarmenē—and like heimarmenē, there are three kinds of providence.56 The essayist says:53 This is a reference to Plato’s Great Year (Timaeus 39d).

The first is at II, 13.1, where Valens says that if a benefic ( Jupiter or Venus) in the fourth place is the lord of the Lot of Fortune or the Hour-marker, the native will be given ‘rev-elations by daimonia’ (ὑπὸ δαιμονίων . . . χρηματισθήσονται). Obviously the refer-ence is not to Valens’ personal daimon, though it does imply such visitations are beneficial.

Within the next few lines, Valens asks his readers to swear an oath not to reveal this knowledge to the unworthy, and they are asked to swear not only by the stars but by pronoia itself:I entreat you, my most honoured brother, and those being initiated into the mysteries with this composition, by the starry vault of heaven and twelvefold-zodiacal circle, by both the Sun and Moon, and the 5 wander-ing stars through which all life is driven, by both Providence itself and holy Necessity, to keep these things in secret. . . .73Can there be any doubt of Valens’ belief in pronoia here? He includes pronoia along with his beloved zodiac, stars and planets, the tools of his livelihood and his passion. In Book IX, he also makes clear his debt to providence (and God) for his astrological knowledge: ‘And so while sailing on the open sea and travel-ling through many a land, becoming an explorer of regions and races, plunged 72 Valens, IV, 11.7 (Pingree, 163.13–17): καὶ δὴ πολὺν μὲν χρόνον ἀνιαρῶς διήγομεν, καὶ ἐπιλύπως τὰς μεταβολὰς τῶν τόπων ποιούμενοι, τοῖς περὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα ἐσπουδακόσι συμμίσγοντες, διάπειραν ἐλαμβάνομεν, μέχρις οὗ τὸ δαιμόνιον βουληθὲν διά τινος προνοίας τὴν παράδοσιν ἔν τινι τόπῳ πεποίηται διά τινος φιλομαθοῦς ἀνδρός.73 Valens IV, 11.11 (Pingree, 163.25–29): Ὁρκίζω σε, ἀδελφέ μου τιμιώτατε, καὶ τοὺς μυσταγωγουμένους ταύτῃ τῇ συντάξει οὐρανοῦ μὲν ἀστέριον κύτος καὶ κύκλον δυοκαιδεκάζῳδον, Ἥλιόν τε καὶ Σελήνην καὶ τοὺς ε̄ πλανήτας ἀστέρας δι’ ὧν ὁ πᾶς βίος ἡνιοχεῖται, αὐτὴν τε τὴν πρόνοιαν καὶ τὴν ἱερὰν ἀνάγκην, ἐν ἀποκρύφοις ταῦτα συντηρῆσαι. . . . The inclusion of ‘holy Necessity’ here, and its implications in fate and astrology, cannot be addressed here (but see Chapter 10). But recall that the Moirai are daughters of Necessity; in astrology there is a Lot of Necessity, and Saturn is said to rule ‘ignorance and necessity’ (Valens I, 1.47). Macrobius, Saturnalia I, 19.17 alludes to Fortune, Daimon, Necessity and Eros; and Commentary on the Dream of Scipio I, 6.37–40 mentions Necessity and elements."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 37Kindled Spiritsinto labours in a long-standing experiment, I was thought fit by God and prov-idence (pronoia) to light upon a secure and safe harbour.’74When the daimonion is at work, according to De fato, it operates through tertiary pronoia, the kind of pronoia available to humans. When Valens says that he was given the gift of astrology through god and providence (via the daimonion), is this a combination of primary (godly) and tertiary (daimonic) pronoia? Could this be the kind of pronoia he means? Could he have known the ideas of primary, secondary and tertiary pronoia?75 He assigns pronoia to the Moon, which fits with Plutarchian ideas about daimons, pronoia and the moon—possibly evidence for Valens being acquainted with such treatises.76 Other passages of Valens77 suggest he believes the power of heimarmenē is absolute, but these statements about pronoia, applied to his own life, tell a different story.How does Valens conceive of providence? In the ‘oath’ passages (IV, 11.11; VII, 6.231), Valens exhorts his readers to swear by Providence; the context meaning here leans more toward providence as an overarching order in the cosmos. But in the other passages previously quoted (IV, 11.7: ‘. . . the wished-for daimonion, through a certain providence, made the transmission . . .’; and IX, 1.10: ‘I was thought fit by God and providence to light upon a secure and safe 74 Valens, IX, 1.10 (Pingree, 317.10–13): πελαγοδρομήσας οὖν καὶ πολλὴν γῆν διοδεύσας, κλιμάτων τε καὶ ἐθνῶν κατόπτης γενόμενος, πολυχρονίᾳ πείρᾳ καὶ πόνοις συνεμφυρείς, ἠξιώθην ὑπὸ θεοῦ καὶ τῆς προνοίας βεβαίου καὶ ἀσφαλοῦς λιμένος τυχεῖν. The sentence is based on Critodemus (Valens has added the words ‘and providence’).75 Komorowska, Valens, 309–10, 351 also suggests this, though of course there can be no cer-tain proof. However, we should not pass over the striking similarity of thought between what Valens says in V, 6.4 (‘For fate has ordained by law for each an unchangeable actu-ality of outcomes . . .’ [Pingree, 209.10–11: Νενομοθέτηκε γὰρ ἡ εἱμαρμένη ἑκάστῳ ἀμετάθετον ἀποτελεσμάτων ἐνέργειαν . . . ]) and what is expressed in On Fate 568b–d (fate as a law). See below, 39–40, 42, nn. 85, 86 and 91, where Valens again mentions fate as a law and talks about what is ‘possible’ (τὸ δυνατὸν), using the technical term mentioned in On Fate 571b, as well as ‘chosen plan’ (προαίρεσις), the term used in On Fate 571d, to describe things that are, in the view of the essayist, ‘up to us’ (ἐφ’ ἡμῖν) and ‘by choice’ (κατὰ προαίρεσιν).76 We might otherwise expect that in astrology pronoia, which clearly must have an associ-ation with nous, would be assigned to the Sun. On the other hand, the Moon represents the material world, and the body, which will be finally affected by any kind of pronoia. We may, in fact, acquire a measure of pronoia by being in tune with the material world, represented by the Moon.77 E.g., V, 6.4 (n. 75); IX, 12.19 (see below, 39–40)."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"38CHAPTER 1harbour’),78 Valens is treating pronoia not so much as an ordering principle with heimarmenē as its enforcer, but as a divine intervention.79In this context, the very fact that Valens believes in this kind of Providence militates against a hard determinism: as Philippe Merlan says, ‘strict deter-minism seems to leave no place for providence in any genuine sense of the word.’80 If this is so, then Valens’ belief in providence means that he cannot be a strict determinist. Merlan was speaking in reference to Stoicism; but Middle Platonists, as well, ‘defended divine providence against fatalism’.81Furthermore, Valens’ comments about seeking virtue through studying astrology (e.g. V, 6.9, 8.112; VI, 1.15–16)82 and following his own daimon (see below) also demonstrate an anti-hard determinism stance from the Stoic point of view, in that he is making a choice which appears to have elements of freedom. His decision also would be analogous to the antecedent provided by tertiary providence in De fato, but the consequents of his decision are sub-ject to fate (see n. 58). While one ought not to categorise Valens’ philosophical positions as either Stoic or Platonic (they are, to put it gently, eclectic, if not 78 See also Valens, Appendix I, 101 (Pingree, 377.23–27), which refers to the recovery of sight ‘by divine providence’, though we cannot be certain that this is not an interpolation by a later commentator.79 Sharples, ‘Threefold Providence’, 109, n. 4, notes that the definition of providence can move in two ways: ‘in terms of the preservation of order or in terms of divine intervention changing the course of events that would otherwise follow.’ In the contexts of the texts Sharples discusses, he implies the former is more likely and that the latter is subordi-nate; but he does not mention Valens. J. M. Rist, Stoic Philosophy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1969, repr. 1980), 126, says that for the Stoics, providence means ‘fore-seeing and foreseeing correctly’. We cannot know if Valens would have this meaning in his mind.80 P. Merlan, ‘The Stoa’, in The Cambridge History of Later Greek and Early Medieval Philosophy, ed. A. H. Armstrong (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1967), 124 (quoted in Dragona-Monachou, ‘Divine Providence’, 4453–54).81 Dragona-Monachou, ‘Divine Providence’, 4455. See also Komorowska, Valens, 298: ‘Among the traditional arguments against the assumption of radical determinism, three are directly related to the concept of divine Providence . . .’.82 VI, 1.15–16 (Pingree, 232.6–10) is especially illustrative of this: . . . ἀλλὰ θεῖᾳ καὶ σεβασμίᾳ θεωρείᾳ τῶν οὐρανίων ἐντυχὼν ἠβουλήθην καὶ τὸν τρόπον μου ἐκκαθᾶραι πάσης κακίας καὶ παντὸς μολυσμοῦ καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν ἀθάνατον προλῆψαι. ἔνθεν καὶ τὰ θεῖά μοι προσομιλεῖν ἐδόκει καὶ τὸ διανοητικόν μου πρὸς τὴν ἀναζήτησιν νηπτικὸν ἐκεκτήμην. ‘. . . but when I lit upon the divine and revered theory of the heavens, I wished to purify my way of life of every vice and pollution, and anticipate the immortal soul. From that point divine things seemed to converse with me, and I acquired the intellectual capacity for sober investigation.’"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 39Kindled Spiritsinconsistent),83 his intention here counts for something, at least where free-dom to choose virtue and follow the daimon is concerned: that he is aware of a choice to be made also militates against strict determinism. By choosing to follow the daimon and to be virtuous (with astrology as his means for this) he obtains gnosis and prognosis, and allows for the reception of pronoia from the daimon.3.4 Heimarmenē and Pronoia: Third AppearanceValens clearly believes in the power of providence; he just as clearly believes in heimarmenē. As far as his own life is concerned, providence as divine inter-vention provides a loophole that could allow him to wriggle out of some of the bonds of fate (the daimon being one instrument in this wriggling).We can see the impact of pronoia and heimarmenē on Valens’ practise of astrology. For pronoia, the following passage provides some insight:The 3rd or 9th place from the Hour-marker handing or taking over when benefics are in them brings about living abroad for good. . . . Thus some in these places are given revelations by god and will have fore-knowledge of the future, and they set up expiatory sacrifices, or prayers, or votive offerings to god; but others, escaping weakness, imprisonment, blame, suffering or danger give thanks to god because of his providence.84Astrological configurations, then, bestow divine aid in the form of prognosis and pronoia.But the natal chart, for Valens, is also heimarmenē, providing in astrological language the outline of a human’s lot in life which cannot be changed and is dependent on provision by his daimon. In the third appearance of daimonion, he says, in Book IX, 12.19:. . . I myself, having learned about myself from foreknowledge ( prognōsis), claimed such a foundational chart as my lot, and that within this parameter 83 See Komorowska, Valens, 281–334, Part 4, 8, which discusses not only Valens’ philosophi-cal eclecticism but also how deterministic he really is.84 IV, 15.1–2 (Pingree, 174.7–8, 10–14): Ὁ γʹ ἢ ὁ θʹ τόπος ἀπὸ ὡροσκόπου παραδιδοὺς ἢ παρα-λαμβάνων, ἀγαθοποιῶν ἐπόντων, ξενιτείας ἐπ’ ἀγαθῷ ἀποτελεῖ. . . . τινὲς μὲν οὖν ἐν τούτοις τοῖς τόποις χρηματίζονται ἀπὸ θεοῦ καὶ τὰ μέλλοντα προγινώσκουσι καὶ θεῷ ἐκθυσίας ἢ εὐχὰς ἢ ἀναθήματα κατασκευάζουσιν, τινὲς δὲ καὶ διὰ θεοῦ πρόνοιαν ἀσθένειαν ἢ συνοχὴν ἢ αἰτίαν ἢ πάθος ἢ κίνδυνον [οἱ] ἐκφυγόντες θεῷ εὐχαριστοῦσιν. This sort of apotropaic ritual/prayer as a result of astral omina/astrology echoes Egyptian or Babylonian practice: see Chapter 3."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"40CHAPTER 1it is not possible to become something different, and I became a lover neither of authority, rule, nor another kind of showy reputation or abun-dance of wealth and a mass of possessions or slaves, or a slave of desire and an impious flatterer of both gods and men, able to obtain what the daimonion did not wish to provide. . . .85He continues by comparing himself to a slave who, knowing by his intelligence the habits of a bad master, can make his service ‘without pain and tireless’ by not going against what has been ordered for him, and can ‘carefully keep the law of heimarmenē.’86 The foreknowledge he possesses from astrology leads him to obtain all knowledge of his life that is possible for humans to obtain, which we could call a foreknowledge capable of leading to a pronoia given by the daimon. In this way astrology works with heimarmenē (and acknowl-edges the power of the daimon).3.5 Choosing the Right Moment: Fourth AppearanceOther passages in Valens show relationships between the daimon, fate, astrol-ogy, knowledge and ‘right moments’. These ‘right moments’ concern katarchic astrology; Valens clearly believes that if it is not the right moment (for which we might use the word kairos) for things to happen, they will not—and nothing can be done about it, including prayer to the gods. In V, 2 he recounts the perils of beginning something when the arrangement of the heavens is not propitious—the result of such a katarchē87 is punishment and delay—and because of this he realises that it is only at the opportune moments (kairoi) that events can come about easily.85 Valens, IX, 12.19 (Pingree, 340.22–27): . . . καὶ αὐτὸς καταμαθὼν ἐμαυτὸν ἐκ τῆς προγνώσεως καὶ ὁποίαν καταβολὴν ἔλαχον τοῦ κλήρου καὶ ὅτι παρὰ τοῦτο ἀδύνατον γενέσθαι ἕτερον οὔτε ἡγεμονίας οὔτε ἀρχῆς οὔτε ἑτέρας φαντασιώδους δόξης ἢ πλούτου δαψιλείας καὶ κτημάτων ἢ σωμάτων πλήθους ἐραστὴς ἐγενόμην ἢ δοῦλος ἐπιθυμίας καὶ κόλαξ ἀσεβὴς θεῶν τε καὶ ἀνθρώπων, δυνάμενος τυχεῖν ὧν μὴ ἐβούλετο τὸ δαιμόνιον παρέχειν. . . . The word Valens uses for the birthchart, καταβολή, is also used in V, 6.2, (209.1); V, 6.10 (210.6–7); and V, 6.20 (211.22) as a synonym for the nativity as one’s foundation. The same connotation is meant here. The idea of allotment is again stressed in ἔλαχον τοῦ κλήρου.86 Valens, IX, 12.19 (Pingree, 340.27–33): . . . ἀλλὰ καθάπερ δεσπότου φαύλου <ὁ> ἐν συνέσει δοῦλος ἐπίσταται ἤθη καὶ τὰς περὶ τὸν βίον ἀναστροφὰς κοσμίως τὰς ἐξυπηρετήσεις ποιούμενος καὶ τῇ τοῦ κελεύοντος διαταγῇ μὴ ἀντιτασσόμενος ἀλύπητον καὶ ἀκοπίατον ἡγεῖται τὴν ὑπόστασιν, τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον καὶ αὐτὸς οὔτε μοχθηρὰν οὔτε ἐπώδυνον τὴν ὑπηρεσίαν ἐποιησάμην, πάσης δὲ ματαίας ἐλπίδος καὶ φροντίδος ἀπαλλαγεὶς τὸν τῆς εἱμαρμένης νόμον διεφύλαξα. (This is the entire sentence from which the quotations are excerpted.)87 That is, the astrological time of beginning something."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 41Kindled SpiritsAnd I myself, since I keep a watch out for such days according to what is possible, and make my katarchai for actions or friends according to the time-description of the opportune moments (kairoi), used to think of the katarchē as unchangeable and easily brought to completion; but when I was wandering and, through the untimely (akairos) presence or alliance of a friend, or by necessity, I made a beginning of something, I received a result that was liable to punishment and painful or causing delay. Whence for every katarchē one must observe carefully, in putting out a fleet and military command. . . . Truly, it is useless to sacrifice to god or to consecrate offerings; for prayers will not be answered and god will not let himself be worshipped, but he will be called upon idly and ineffectively.88Thus kairos and katarchē must be synchronised, and gods called on at the proper time. We can pick the katarchē, but kairos is out of our control. This is our heimarmenē, including even the little mundane things in our lives, and it is useless to think otherwise, Valens seems to say. The last appearance of the daimonion comes at IX, 12.31, and it is entwined with fate and choosing the favourable moment (here called καλὴ ὥρα):But conversely I myself say against these claims [of what is in our power] that these vain things do not rest with them. For it turns out in the oppo-site way from the chosen plan through certain implacable causes. For many times when I, wishing to do something or to meet a friend, having selected a favourable time (καλὴ ὥρα), did not obtain what was proposed, and indeed I did not go where I intended to; but when I was not wishing for it, such a thing came to pass. For assuredly it was necessary for the time to happen to be (τυχεῖν) in harmony with that which is about to be. For that very reason those who possess intelligence (νοῦν ἔχοντας)89 must follow the daimonion as it wishes (for it provides the idea for what 88 Valens, V, 2.22, 23 (Pingree, 202.17–23, 25–27): καὶ αὐτὸς μὲν οὖν τὰς τοιαύτας ἡμέρας φυλαττόμενος κατὰ τὸ δυνατὸν καὶ ποιούμενος τὰς καταρχὰς τῶν πράξεων ἢ τῶν φιλιῶν κατὰ τὴν τῶν καιρῶν χρονογραφίαν ἀμετανόητον ἡγούμην τὴν καταρχὴν καὶ εὐσυντέλεστον, ἔσθ’ ὅτε δ’ ἐπλανήθην καὶ διὰ φίλου ἄκαιρον παρουσίαν ἢ σύστασιν ἢ μετὰ ἀνάγκης καταρξάμενός τινος ἐπιζήμιον καὶ ἐπίλυπον ἢ ὑπερθετικὴν ἔκβασιν κατελαβόμην. ὅθεν ἐπὶ πάσης καταρχῆς παρατηρητέον, ἐπὶ τε τῆς τῶν στόλων ἀναγωγῆς καὶ στρατοπεδαρχίας. . . . οὐδὲ μὴν τῷ θεῷ θύειν καὶ ἱερὰ καθιδρύειν χρήσιμον· οὔτε γὰρ εὐχαὶ συντελεσθήσονται οὔτε θεὸς θρησκευθήσεται, ἀλλ’ ὡς ἀργὸν καὶ ἄπρακτον διαφημισθήσεται.89 One wonders if this common idiom was chosen by Valens deliberately to be understood in a sense akin to Plutarch’s idea of the nous/daimon in De genio 591f (see above, 1.3, 25)."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"42CHAPTER 1it wills)90 or select favourable times, and since the katarchē comes to determine an action in conformity with the cosmic movement, it is nec-essary to see the outcome [of the action] concurrently from the position of the stars and Hour-marker at that [beginning] time.91I think Valens is saying here that, even though we think we are in control of the most mundane and petty things (like leaving the house and going to meet a friend), this is not really the case, for everything we actually do must align with the cosmic movement of the stars. If we do have the idea to meet a friend, and that comes to pass, it is because our idea was 1) suggested by the daimonion and 2) the time we pick is in alignment with the cosmos.92 Thinking that we have control is an illusion. There are ‘implacable causes’ at work: this is the law of heimarmenē. Even Valens cannot control whether his favourable time will synchronise with the desired event, nor can he summon the daimon or pronoia at will. Yet by choosing to follow the daimon in concert with choos-ing a moment aligned with the right cosmic movement, Valens privileges the 90 Note the similarity here with Galen’s daimon, as a spirit which commands what it wants the human to do.91 Valens, IX, 12.28–31 (Pingree, 341.25–342.3): τοὐναντίον δ’ ἐγώ φημι πρὸς τούτους ὅτι οὐδὲ ταῦτα τὰ μάταια ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐστιν· εἰς τὸ ἐναντίον γὰρ χωρεῖ τὸ τῆς προαιρέσεως διά τινας ἀπροφασίστους αἰτίας. καὶ γὰρ αὐτὸς πολλάκις πρᾶξαι τι βουλόμενος ἢ συντυχεῖν φίλῳ ὥραν καλὴν ἐκλεξάμενος οὐκ ἔτυχον τοῦ προκειμένου, οὐδὲ μὴν ὅπου ἐβάδιζον ἐγένετο· ὁπότε δ’ οὐκ ἐβουλήθην, τὸ τοιοῦτον συνετελέσθη. πάντως γὰρ ἔδει τὴν ὥραν ἐναρμόνιον τῷ μέλλοντι ἔσεσθαι τυχεῖν. τοιγαροῦν χρὴ τοὺς γε νοῦν ἔχοντας ἕπεσθαι τῷ δαιμονίῳ καθὼς βούλεται (κατασκευάζει γὰρ τὴν <ἔννοιαν> πρὸς ὃ θέλει) ἢ καλὰς ὥρας ἐκλέγεσθαι, ἀρχικῆς δὲ πράξεως τῆς καταρχῆς γενομένης κατὰ τὴν κοσμικὴν κίνησιν [καὶ] ἀνάγκη συνορᾶν τὸ ἀποτέλεσμα ἐκ τῆς τότε ἀστροθεσίας καὶ τῆς τοῦ ὡροσκόπου. Many thanks to Stephan Heilen for helpful sugges-tions in translating the last part of this passage (‘ἀρχικῆς . . . ὡροσκόπου’). In addition to other advice, he pointed out that the first καὶ in this part is probably spurious, a (typi-cal) solution for the Byzantine scribe of ms. S (cod. Oxon. Selden 22) to fix a corruption of the original ἀνάγκη to ἀνάγκην (for more on this condition and additional examples, see S. Heilen, Hadriani genitura. Die astrologischen Fragmente des Antigonos von Nikaia. Edition, Übersetzung und Kommentar (Berlin: De Gruyter, in press)).92 It seems that Valens is in general agreement with the On Fate essayist, but differs with him in the possibility of humans as their own agents operating as part of heimarmenē. For Valens, it seems, only the heavens in their ‘cosmic movement’ and the daimonion can be agents. A similar sentiment is expressed in Manilius, 4.107–117: see W.

Humans can come to know a part of providence, especially through the study of the stars, and also through the daimon. It is the combination of knowing this part of providence and finding the peace that comes from knowing that makes life bearable, ‘without pain and tireless’. It is through the workings of providence (via the daimon) that Valens has some of the most transcendent and ecstatic moments in his life.For I have not made the words for the uninitiated,93 but for the ones clever at such things as they follow with acuity the manifold and intricate [part] of the theory through many ways, both ins and outs, in learning to know [these things], they will seem to associate with gods.94And like the gods, may acquire a measure of pronoia.Valens tells us his astrological wisdom was the result of pronoia, that he was ‘thought fit by God and providence’ to be given such understanding (IX, 1.10). He then says:For all that men have obtained as their lot is not [only] perishable and wretched, but also some divine piece of work in us that is God-inspired; indeed such imperishable air being poured round us, actually being and extending into us, imparts a timely effluence (aporroia kairikē) of immor-tality in ordered and measured time (chronos), an effluence which each of us, every day, is accustomed when exercising to take in and then give out as the vital breath.95This ‘divine piece of work’ is the soul, and with such a divine soul ‘we move, converse, achieve, construct and make godlike works’.96 The practice and 93 Again, Valens conceives of astrology as a mystery into which one is initiated.94 Valens, IX, 12.2 (Pingree, 338.25–28): οὐ γὰρ πρὸς ἀμυήτους ἐποιησάμην τοὺς λόγους, ἀλλὰ πρὸς τοὺς τὰ τοιαῦτα δεινοὺς ὅπως καὶ αὐτοὶ τὸ πολυμερὲς καὶ ποικίλον καὶ ἀκμῇ ἐλλῆγον τῆς θεωρίας διὰ πολλῶν ὁδῶν, εἰσόδων τε καὶ ἐξόδων, ἐπιγνόντες θεοῖς προσομιλεῖν δόξωσιν.95 Valens, IX, 1.11 (Pingree, 317.14–19): Οὐ γὰρ φθαρτὰ πάντα καὶ μοχθηρὰ ἔλαχον οἱ ἄνθρωποι, ἔστι δέ τι καὶ θεῖον ἐν ἡμῖν θεόπνευστον δημιούργημα· ὅ γε περικεχυμένος ἀὴρ ἄφθαρτος ὑπάρχων καὶ διήκων εἰς ἡμᾶς ἀπόρροιαν καιρικὴν ἀθανασίας ἀπονέμει τακτῷ καὶ μεμετρημένῳ χρόνῳ, ἣν ἕκαστος ἡμῶν καθ’ ἡμέραν μελετᾷ γυμναζόμενος λαμβάνειν ἢ καὶ ἀποδιδόναι τὸ ζωτικὸν πνεῦμα.96 IX, 1.16 (Pingree, 317.27–28): ἔνθεν ἐφ’ ὅσον ἔχομεν τὴν ψυχὴν κινούμεθα καὶ ὁμιλοῦμεν καὶ πράσσομεν καὶ μηχανώμεθα καὶ ποιοῦμεν ἔργα ἰσόθεα."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"44CHAPTER 1teaching of astrology would be a ‘godlike work’ for Valens: we know that he considers astrology to be ‘holy’ and ‘handed over to humans by god, so that they may possess a portion of immortality through prognosis . . .’.97This soul, in Valens’ view, is linked to an immortal air which has both ‘kairical’ and chronical components. Let us give some thought to kairos and chronos is this context. First, kairos is connected with the divine and the immortal. Second, kairos seems to be above chronos, or at any rate to regu-late it. In the same way, primary providence is above secondary and tertiary providence in De fato. Can time (chronos or kairos) and providence be related? In Plutarch’s Platonic Questions, he posits, reading Timaeus, a pronoia which creates chronos.98 If, based on this, we can posit that primary pronoia is kair-ical (a not completely far-fetched leap, in my view), then secondary pronoia, representing astrology via the gods in heaven and their movements; and ter-tiary pronoia, the province of the daimon, would represent a chronical pro­noia. Tertiary, chronical pronoia is provided to humans by the daimon. This would be the pronoia Valens is talking about. The tertiary pronoia that humans are able to know is a chronical pronoia, but theoretically it can be superseded by this kairical pronoia.99 And this is why interpretation in astrology some-times fails: the astrologer can access only tertiary, chronical pronoia, and not kairical pronoia which lies above it; as Valens makes clear, we cannot control kairos (or a kairical pronoia). Yet this access to tertiary, chronical pronoia is also what allows an insightful and meaningful interpretation by the astrologer (insight, not foresight, may be a better translation of pronoia in this context).100 97 V, 6.16 (Pingree, 210.30–32): ὅθεν ἡ μὲν ὑπόστασις τοῦ μαθήματος ἱερὰ καὶ σεβάσμιος ὡς ὑπὸ θεοῦ παραδεδομένη τοῖς ἀνθρώποις, ὅπως καὶ αὐτοὶ μέρος ἀθανασίας διὰ τῆς προγνώσεως ἔχωσιν. . . .98 Plutarch, Platonic Questions 1007c: . . . ἐφελκύσασα δὲ πρόνοια καὶ καταλαβοῦσα τὴν μὲν ὕλην σχήμασι τὴν δὲ κίνησιν περιόδοις τὴν μὲν κόσμον ἅμα τὴν δὲ χρόνον ἐποίησεν. ‘. . . but provi-dence, when she took in tow and curbed matter with shapes and motion with revolu-tions, simultaneously made of the former a universe and of the latter time.’ (trans.

This is not astrology as frivolous and idle prediction, but as a discipline for obtaining gnosis, and therefore align-ing with the divine. If we try to see the alignments and patterns between the stars and the events in our lives, we can see more of the divine plan that has been written for us, a plan that can be divulged by the daimon at the level at which we are able to comprehend it. Our daimon is our link to the divine and to divination—Plutarch says the daimons are in charge of the oracles, and they are also in charge of human souls. In the story of Zeus and Semele, the sight of the god is too much for mortal eyes—but the daimon’s is a gentler light that can be borne by humans. Through the daimon, we can process the light of both the sun and the moon—the sun representing nous and its place in the soul, and the moon representing the body which holds the soul in our human incarnation. The daimon partakes of both, and in astrology we can see this combination in the Lots of Fortune and Daimon and the points which form them: Sun, Moon and Hour-marker (Ascendant),101 our point of personal incarnation, the point of our appearance on earth.101 Do these mirror Valens’ fate, daimon and propitious time?

Astrology follows this propensity, literally connecting fortune and dai-mon in its mechanics, and often in its practices, as we saw in the Introduction. Chapter One initiated the discussion of how astrology connects fortune to daimon in the use of lots, and implicated daimon and fortune (as chance) in the workings of Greek fate. This chapter introduces essential cultural links and significations between Good Fortune (Agathe Tyche) and Good Daimon (Agathos Daimon). It will then examine the use of good fortune and daimon in the astrological places.We begin with a short introduction to the importance of Tyche and Daimon in Hellenistic Egyptian and Greco-Roman cultures. This précis will serve to establish the significance and relationship of these two concepts both religiously and philosophically. They will then be explored, primarily in an astrological context, through the rest of the chapter, and in greater detail in Chapter Three.Ultimately, this chapter has two purposes in examining Daimon and Tyche as a pair. The first is to establish the parameters and signification of the link between Daimon and Fortune. The second is to explore the uses of the Agathos Daimōn and Agathē Tuchē in the astrological places. Both the eleventh place (called Good Daimon) and the fifth (Good Fortune), which are connected in many respects, will be considered. In addition, by exploring the cultural Agathos Daimon in a (mostly) Greek milieu, we set the stage for its transfer into Egypt after Alexander, and the crucial connections between the Greek and Egyptian guises of the Agathos Daimon. Throughout the chapter, the enduring 1 In R.

Some Cultural and Historical BackgroundOne of the answers to this question lies in the culture of Alexandria, where the cults of Fortune and Daimon were well developed by the second century CE. There were not only cults to the general deities Agathe Tyche and Agathos Daimon, but the concept of one’s personal tuchē and daimōn also had some currency.2 In the Hellenistic period in Alexandria, the Agathos Daimon and Agathe Tyche become linked to Sarapis and Isis, as well as to the strictly Egyptian deities Shai (god of ‘fate’) and Renenet (goddess of nourishment). However, other cultural roots for the Agathos Daimon and Agathe Tyche lie in Greece.3In books like Plutarch’s Parallel Lives the underlying theme shows the good or bad fortune given to each of the biographical subjects, as well as the con-nection with either a good or bad, a strong or weak, daimon.4 There is evi-dence of a personal Agathos Daimon for ‘ordinary’ people beginning around the fourth or third century BCE. For example, one Posidonius of Halicarnassus, who consulted an oracle of Apollo at Telmessus, was told that he should pay homage to ‘the Agathos Daimon of Posidonius and Gorgis’ (his own and his wife’s daimon).5Both Fortune (Tyche) and Daimon are, from the Hellenistic period into Late Antiquity, given great power in the determination of human fate. Cults of Agathe Tyche and Agathos Daimon arose to propitiate these deities as early as the fourth century BCE, and they were still flourishing when the Hellenistic form of astrology came to prominence. (In Roman Egypt, children were even 2 See P. M. Fraser, Ptolemaic Alexandria, 3 vols (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972), here I, 241–43.3 For an account of the Agathos Daimon in Greece and Alexandria, see D.

While the astrological Lots of Fortune and Daimon are one way to look at the personal effects of Fortune and Daimon on an individual, the pair are also manifestly incorporated in the names of the astrological places: the fifth and sixth are Good Fortune and Bad Fortune, and the eleventh and twelfth Good Daimon and Bad Daimon.1.1 Pairing Tyche and DaimonThe way we see Good Fortune and Good Daimon paired in astrology is a man-ifest example of their pairing in the general culture of the time. Thus, when we cover the place of the Good Daimon in astrology in this chapter, we cannot divorce it from its counterpart place of Good Fortune. Other cultural and liter-ary examples of Agathe Tyche and Agathos Daimon as a binary unit will serve as a demonstration of the significance of this pairing.9The same Posidonius and Gorgis described above who had their own Agathos Daimon also were bidden to perform rituals honouring his par-ents’ Agathe Tyche.10 Both epigraphical inscriptions and reliefs of the paired Agathos Daimon and Agathe Tyche exist throughout the Mediterranean area, including one on the Acropolis dated ca. 360 BCE.116 Fraser, Ptolemaic Alexandria, I, 209 (but see also 209–11 for Daimon and Tyche in this period).

Yet out of respect for the not wholly bad fortune which came to him, and the Daimon who, in pity for him and the wounded man, kept the wound of the one from being fatal and the fortune and offence of the other from being accursed, in gratitude to the Daimon for this and not opposing it, to cancel the death penalty of the wounder, and remove him to a neighbouring city for the rest of his life, enjoying the fruits of all his own possessions.’ (Burnet, vol. 5): ἡ δὴ γραφὴ περὶ τραύματος ὧδε ἡμῖν κείσθω· Ἐάν τις διανοηθεὶς τῇ βουλήσει κτεῖναί τινα φίλιον, πλὴν ὧν ὁ νόμος ἐφίησιν, τρώσῃ μέν, ἀποκτεῖναι δὲ ἀδυνατήσῃ, τὸν διανοηθέντα τε καὶ τρώσαντα οὕτως οὐκ ἄξιον (877a) ἐλεεῖν, οὐδὲ αἰδούμενον ἄλλως ἢ καθάπερ ἀποκτείναντα ὑπέχειν τὴν δίκην φόνου ἀναγκάζειν· τὴν δὲ οὐ παντάπασι κακὴν τύχην αὐτοῦ σεβόμενον καὶ τὸν δαίμονα, ὃς αὐτὸν καὶ τὸν τρωθέντα ἐλεήσας ἀπότροπος αὐτοῖς ἐγένετο μὴ τῷ μὲν ἀνίατον ἕλκος γενέσθαι, τῷ δὲ ἐπάρατον τύχην καὶ συμφοράν, τούτῳ δὴ χάριν τῷ δαίμονι διδόντα καὶ μὴ ἐναντιούμενον, τὸν μὲν θάνατον ἀφελεῖν τοῦ τρώσαντος, μετάστασιν (877b) δὲ εἰς τὴν γείτονα πόλιν αὐτῷ γίγνεσθαι διὰ βίου, καρπούμενον ἅπασαν τὴν αὑτοῦ κτῆσιν.13 See, e.g., CCAG VIII/4, 121.3–11, in Rhetorius’s fifth consideration on the lots (see Appendix 8.C).14 As we have seen with Pseudo-Plutarch, De fato; also Maximus of Tyre, Orations, esp. 5, 8, 9, 13; Apuleius, De deo Socratis, De Platone; Alexander of Aphrodisias, On Fate.15 See The Tabula of Cebes, trans.

It is to these that we now turn.2 The Astrological Places of Good Daimon and Good FortuneWhat do astrologers say about the Agathos Daimon, via its incorporation into the system of astrological places? It names the eleventh place, opposite the fifth place of Good Fortune. Bouché-Leclercq remarked that, given the impor-tance of Fortune, both universal and individual, in the Greco-Roman world, it was not surprising that astrologers allotted places in the chart to delineate personal fortune.16 Given the association of daimon with fortune, and the increasing significance of both a personal and polis Daimon, it is, then, not surprising that the place in the chart opposite that of Good Fortune should be allotted to the Good Daimon. Clearly the power of a benevolent daimon to improve the life of its corresponding human being was not taken lightly. Indeed, one could argue that the location of the Good Daimon in the upper hemisphere of the chart, climbing towards the Midheaven, shows its superi-ority to Good Fortune (which is in the lower hemisphere and moving down to the IC). The associations between Moon/Fortune and Sun/Daimon are also accounted for in this scheme. The Fortune/Tuchē places (both good and bad) are located below the horizon, the province of the night and the Moon. The Daimon places (again, good and bad) are located above the horizon, the prov-ince of the day and the Sun.The two benefic planets, Venus and Jupiter, were respectively assigned to the places where Good Fortune and Good Daimon resided. This too indicates Daimon’s superiority over Fortune, as Jupiter is the greater benefic and Venus the lesser benefic. Venus (Aphrodite) has associations with Tyche and Fortuna,17 and Jupiter (Zeus) with Agathos Daimon (the Agathos 16 Bouché-Leclercq, AG, 288–89: ‘Chaque individu avait donc sa Fortune, et une place d’honneur devait être réservée dans le cercle de la géniture à ce Génie féminin.’17 E.g. in Plutarch, De fortuna Romanorum, 317f–318d, where Sulla’s embrace of Fortuna is linked to Aphrodite; Pausanias, Description of Greece, I, 43.6, where statues of Aphrodite and Tyche are placed near each other at Megara.

In addition, Zeus Ktesios has strong ties to Zeus Meilichios and Zeus Philios,23 aspects of Zeus with specific links to Agathe Tyche.24 Daimon is Zeus Meilichios in Orphic Hymn 73.2 (see Appendix 10.A). But most valuable for our purposes are Zeus Ktesios’s associations with property and acquisition, important attributes of the eleventh place. As a god of the house and its protection, Zeus Ktesios was propitiated to increase the contents of the storeroom25 as well as the health and good prosperity of the family.26 (In the first century CE, the Agathos Daimon is seen as preserving household goods and the fruits of the harvest.27) Valens calls the eleventh place from the Lot of Fortune a ‘place of acquisition’ (II, 21.1). Thus elements of Zeus Ktesios and his cohorts match the attributes of the eleventh place, the place where Jupiter has its joy, and even subsequently derived ‘eleventh’ places (see below, 2.5).19 ‘κτήσιος’ as adjective from κτῆσις, ‘acquisition’ (see LSJ, s.v. κτήσιος and κτῆσις).

The divinities Shai28 (god of ‘fate’) and Shepset (goddess of nobility and wealth) give their names to the Egyptian eleventh and fifth places. This is significant because of their cultural links to Good Daimon and Good Fortune, as will be made clear in Chapter Three. For now, it is enough to know that Shai has to do with destiny and is often portrayed in snake form, and Shepset is associated with both procreation and material riches. Both divini-ties have protective qualities.Certain allusions in O. Ḥor 3 (second cent. BCE) seem particularly perti-nent for the use of šꜢy and špšy.t in the astrological places. In this text, Isis is the major player in what seems to be a birthday celebration for Ptolemy VI Philometor. Isis is the one who ‘caused you to be born (on) <Thoth, day 12>‘ (ll. 12–13 recto),29 and gives Ptolemy ‘every good event’ (sḫny-nfr nb, l. 12 recto).30 She opens the year (l. 5 recto) which is ‘favourable’ (rnpt nfrt, l. 3 recto), ‘favour-able for your Shai and favourable for your Shepset’ (nfr.s pꜢy.k šꜢy nꜢ-nfr.s tꜢy.k špšy.t, line 4 recto).31 The combination of a birth day and its anniversary (the king’s own ‘new year’), the prediction of good yearly events as well as good fate and fortune, and that Isis herself chose his birth day for its favourable condi-tions (mdt-nfrw, ‘benefits’, l. 14 recto)32 suggest, if not a strictly astrological,33 at least a hemerological, component in predicting good outcomes for the king.Demotic astrological texts call the fifth place (tꜢ) špšy(.t) and the elev-enth pꜢ šy, the first corresponding to ἀγαθὴ τύχη in Greek, and the second to ἀγαθὸς δαίμων (see above, Fig. 2.1).

The article pꜢ is missing, but šy correlates to the eleventh place if we reasonably assume, as Neugebauer does, that Aries in line 7 refers to the position of the previous line; Scorpio, then, would follow logically as belonging to the next line and would be the position of Shai.42 That fits with the posi-tions of the other given places: if the Ascendant is in Capricorn, then Scorpio would be the eleventh sign from it. The zodiacal sign and the article is missing for špšy. It seems likely, however, that this notation refers to the fifth place, as the one opposite to the eleventh; both places are considered to be areas of beneficent influence. Thus we have a list of important places of the chart: the positions of the Sun and Moon, the four angles, and the places of Good Daimon and Good Fortune.43 As a further indication that Shai is representing the ‘fate’ deity, his name is written with the snake followed by the seated god determinative.44Furthermore, the Demotic astrological handbook (P. Berlin 8345) contains the names for the fifth (Ꜥ.wy špšy(.t)) and the eleventh (Ꜥ.wy šy).45 This text gives 41 Micah Ross kindly inspected the photograph of the ostracon in Thompson, ‘Demotic Horoscopes’, pl. 28, and thinks that instead of Neugebauer’s pr, this and line 9 may read Ꜥ.wy.42 Neugebauer, ‘Demotic Horoscopes’, 121, does not understand how this correlates with the previous lines of the ostracon: ‘. . . the two following “houses,” mentioned in the last two lines (8 and 9), do not fit into the regular scheme as given by Os. 3.’ Thompson, ‘Demotic Horoscopes’, 233, n. i, also is puzzled by what he sees as an inconsistency: ‘These last three lines evidently belong to some other scheme than the previous ones.’43 Note that the places on this list feature in Dorotheus’s list of important places in I, 5.2–3 (see below, 62 and n. 77). A recently published birthchart, O. Glasgow D. 1925.96, refers to šy in Cancer and špšy.t in Capricorn (Quack, ‘Ein astrologisches Ostrakon’, 105–06 [text and German trans.]). Based on the given Ascendant in Virgo, these must mean the 11th and 5th astrological places, just as in Neugebauer’s Os. 5 (Quack concludes the same, 110).44 By the New Kingdom Shai is commonly a divinity (see Chapter 3, 2.1 and 2.4).

(Other Egyptian connections will also be apparent.)2.3 ManiliusThe earliest extant astrological writings on the places of Good Fortune and Good Daimon are those of the Roman poet Manilius (fl. c. 10 CE), who spends almost 200 lines of the Astronomica’s Book 2 on the way the circle of the chart is divided. He begins (2.788) with the divisions of the circle based on rising, setting, culmination and anti-culmination (the cardinal points), and the astro-logical associations of these. He moves on (at 2.856) to the twelve-fold divi-sion of the circle and what each portion represents. The words Manilius uses for these divisions of the circle are worth some attention. There are six: pars, regio, sedes, sors, locus and templum. He uses pars, ‘portion’, to describe them first, followed in the next sentence by locus.47 The apportionment becomes the place, which in turn delivers the stars’ powers. Pars and sors have connota-tions of allotment (which remind us of fate);48 regio, sedes and locus are spatial transformations of that allotment.Then there is templum, an unusual word in an astrological context (the usual Greek word for these sections of the chart is τόπος; Latin, locus). A templum is not just a temple; it is ‘the area of the sky or land defined (in words) by the augur, within which he took the auspices.’49 Manilius first uses templum for the first place, the Horoscope, as if to tell us that here, at the intersection 46 P. Berlin 8345, III, 2; IV, 11: see ibid., 55, 57. Not all the aphorisms for all houses and the two planets have survived. Again, thanks to Micah Ross, who went over the photograph of the papyrus with me.47 2.856–857 (Goold): ‘Omne quidem signum sub qualicumque figura / partibus inficitur mundi; locus imperat astris . . .’. ‘In fact every sign, in any figure [i.e. chart], is affected by these apportionments of the world; the place commands the stars . . .’.48 And Manilius would agree that fate and the stars are joined: see his very first sentence, ‘Carmine divinas artes et conscia fati /sidera diversos hominum variantia casus’ (1.1–2) among many other similar references. For more on the use of pars and sors, see Chapter 8, 2.1, 291–93.49 P. G. W. Glare, ed., Oxford Latin Dictionary, Fascicle VIII (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982), s.v. ‘templum’."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 57Keeping in Good Spiritsof eastern horizon and ecliptic, is where it all begins, the place to observe the omens of a life.50 Without the sacred space determined and marked out for divination by the first place, the rest would not follow. Naturally templum also reminds us of the usual associations of a place to worship and propitiate a deity. One assumes that Manilius has chosen his words carefully here, and not just for poetic purposes. His choice seems to deliberately connect augury with astrology.51 The templum created at the first portion of the chart gives the astrologer the means to divine and interpret a life and to propitiate the gods regarding that life.There are other ways in which Manilius is at odds with astrological tradition in these place-descriptions.52 He is the only astrologer, for example, to call the fourth place Daemonium53 and the fifth place Daemonie. He names the tenth ‘Fortune’ and assigns Venus to it (her usual place is the fifth). In this he may be in accordance with Egyptian doctrine: in a Demotic chart and an astrological text of this period, the tenth place is called ‘the house of the goddess’ (pr nṯr.t or ı ̓n-nṯrt).54 Wolfgang Hübner suggests an Egyptian influence in Manilius 50 One would think, reading Goold’s translation of this section, that Manilius uses ‘templum’ in every other sentence. This is not the case. It only appears twice: at the mention of the first place (2.943) and at the end, where he speaks of the ‘powers of the temples’ (2.958–959: ‘tali sub sorte notandae / templorum tibi sunt vires’).51 There are also similarities between Manilius’s astrology and Etruscan liver divination; see Chapter 8, 294–96. A possible connection may exist between Manilius’s use of ‘templum’ and the Egyptian Ꜥ.wy, which has many of the same semantic fields.52 For more on Manilius’s scheme versus conventional astrological doctrine, see W. Hübner, ‘Les divinités planétaires de la Dodécatropos’, in Les astres: actes du colloque international de Montpellier, 23–25 mars 1995, 2 vols., vol. 1: Les astres et les mythes, la description du ciel, ed. Béatrice Bakhouche, Alain Maurice Moreau, and Jean-Claude Turpin (Montpellier: Université Paul Valéry, 1996), 307–317; also idem, Die Dodekatropos des Manilius: (Manil. 2, 856–970) (Stuttgart: F. Steiner 1995).53 See the discussion of Hübner, Dodekatropos, 70–71. This transliteration of the neuter form, δαιμόνιον, only attested for the 4th place here, reflects the pejorative connotation common at this time (e.g. δαιμόνιον in the Septuagint is purely bad: for more on this, see Chapter 4). The fourth here is linked to Saturn and his gloomy associations.54 See Neugebauer, ‘Demotic Horoscopes’, 116–17 (Os. 3, l. 21): ‘pr ntr.t(?) pꜢ gnhḏ’ ‘The house of the goddess: Cancer’; also A. von Lieven, ‘Divination in Ägypten’, AoF 26, no. 1 (1999): 77–126, here 124: ‘pr nčr.t “Haus der Göttin” ’.

Reymond, From Ancient Egyptian Hermetic Writings (Vienna: In Kommission bei Verlag Brüder Hollinek, 1977), 144–45, a4, 8, 12, Plate VI) (see"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"58CHAPTER 2assigning Typhon to the second and eighth places,55 but he makes no mention of Venus and the tenth possibly having Egyptian roots.Of the 101 lines devoted to describing the twelve places, Manilius spends twenty-two on the eleventh and fifth places (nine for the eleventh and thir-teen for the fifth). (See Appendix 2.A.) The eleventh seems almost better than the tenth in its power for good. Its hope makes it ‘better’, it ‘soars up higher’, it ‘may not yield’ to the tenth.56 This is because the eleventh is still climbing toward the top of the chart, while the Midheaven is already there and has no place to go but down. Hope makes the eleventh better; the fifth, its opposite, only ‘hopes for honour’57 (the honour of having the power of a cardine). The eleventh’s hope seems more pure and more assured—any disappointment is still unrealised.The eleventh, because it does not know the downward trend the Midheaven has seen, is metaphorically higher and better, even though lower in position. ‘It is, therefore, small wonder, if the [region] nearest the summit, though lower than it, is described by the portion (sorte) of Fortune which is entitled “Happy”.’58 I think Manilius intends to distinguish between ‘Fortuna’ and ‘Felix Fortuna’ here: his ‘Felix Fortuna’ is not unrelated to the Greek ‘Agathos Daimon’ as well as to the whole idea of eudaimonia. Hübner remarks that also J. F. Quack, ‘Die Spur des Magiers Petese’, Cd’É 77 (2002): 76–92, here 90–91). We do not know whether ‘goddess’ means the Moon or Venus here (these would be divinities, not planets but, naturally in an astrological context, the divinity as associated with the planet which bears her name). As Micah Ross points out in ‘A Survey of Demotic Astrological Texts’, Culture and Cosmos 11 (2007): 1–25, here 24, for the Egyptians the ‘house of god’ and ‘house of goddess’ are sequential, whereas for the Greeks the God and Goddess places are opposed. Hübner, ‘Divinités planétaires’, 315, also brings up the concept of similar plan-ets being neighbours in Manilius’s arrangement, which places Venus (10th) and Jupiter (11th) next to each other in the upper hemisphere, and Saturn (4th) and Hübner’s posited Mars (5th) in the lower (I say posited because Manilius does not actually mention Mars in the 5th).55 Hübner, ‘Divinités planétaires’, 315.56 2.881–884 (Goold): ‘at, quae fulgentis sequitur fastigia caeli / proxima, neve ipsi cedat, cui iungitur, astro / spe melior, palmamque petens victrixque priorum / altius insurgit’.57 2.896 (Goold): ‘sperat honorem’.58 2.886–888: ‘quocirca minime mirum, si proxima summo / atque eadem inferior [Goold: integrior] Fortunae sorte dicatur / cui titulus Felix.’ See Hübner’s discussion of the textual criticism on this passage in Dodekatropos, 51–53. I follow his argument (53) that dicatur is a subjunctive of dicere rather than a present passive of dicare; see also his discussion of the emendations concerning integrior by various editors (52–53), where he prefers the ‘inferior’ of Bonincontrius, which I also follow."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 59Keeping in Good SpiritsManilius avoids using the word ‘daemon’ for the 11th place.59 This is true, but I suggest that ‘felix’ is his locution for the Greek εὐδαίμων, thus implicitly calling the place ‘good daimon’.60 Here there is a convergence of tuchē and daimōn in the Hellenistic mind, a convergence which we know also from Plutarch. Frederick Brenk has said that ‘There are innumerable examples in Plutarch’s work where the two words daimon and tyche seem to be interchangeable . . .’.61 But when Plutarch, for example, mentions tuchē and daimōn in the same breath (Life of Marius 46.1),62 in my view he shows not their interchangeabil-ity but their interdependence (we also see this in the passage from the Laws, 876c–877b, cited above, 1.1, 49 and n. 12). It is not that daimōn and tuchē are interchangeable synonyms, but rather that each is dependent on the other; they exist in a symbiotic relationship. Daimōn encourages a certain tuchē and tuchē brings about what has been destined by the daimōn (or perhaps vice versa). Furthermore, both tuchē and daimōn are required for achieving happiness, eudaimonia. The Fortuna of Manilius’s eleventh place is not tuchē as random and arbitrary chance, but as serendipitous good luck. Because the eleventh place is still rising, it is able to provide blessings and aids to happiness. Manilius 59 Hübner, Dodekatropos, 53.60 Manilius is conversant with Greek terms, and uses them in the Astronomica when there is no alternative. Daimon is difficult (see Hübner, ibid., 51 and n. 125, where he cites Housman’s collection of citations showing the difficulties Romans had with translat-ing the word δαίμων), but here, though, he can use the Latin felix. Hübner, 35, compares the felix of the 11th with the infelix used of the 12th, the Latin symmetry matching the Greek symmetry of agathos and kakos daimōn. Manilius’s familiarity with ‘happiness’ and its philosophical ramifications might well arise, in this instance, from his following of Posidonius, who wrote about eudaimonia and its daimonic connections (see Chapter 4, 1.3, 124 and n. 43). (For a discussion of Manilius’s philosophical influences, see, e.g., K. Volk, Manilius and his Intellectual Background (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), 226–51, esp. for Posidonius, 231–32.)61 Brenk, In Mist Apparelled, 147, though he adds, ‘one cannot help suspecting that the use of one word or the other is for stylistic reasons.’ However, he develops this argument of inter-changeability in the rest of Chapter 8 (esp. 147–54). ‘Interchangeable’, though, implies that the two words are more or less synonymous. To the modern reader, Plutarch may seem sloppy in his use of these words, but we cannot assume that an ancient reader would not have understood the nuances behind the words in their contemporary contexts. Brenk, I think, goes too far in his argument of interchangeability. See also S. Swain, ‘Plutarch: Chance, Providence and History’, AJPh 110, no. 2 (1989): 272–302, here 273–274, who has accepted Brenk’s ‘interchangeability’ argument.62 (Lindeskog/Ziegler, vol. 3.1): Πλάτων μὲν οὖν, ἤδη πρὸς τῷ τελευτᾶν γενόμενος, ὕμνει τὸν αὑτοῦ δαίμονα καὶ τὴν τύχην. . . . ‘Plato, however, now coming near to death, sang the praises of his Daimon and Fortune . . .’."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"60CHAPTER 2associates Jupiter, the king of the gods, with this place: ‘Iuppiter hac habitat’ (2.890). Jupiter in the eleventh place almost always portends something good.The fifth place, for Manilius, is more problematic. Unlike the eleventh, it is below the horizon—the poet juxtaposes words like ‘deep’ (imus), ‘sunken’ (summersus) and ‘cast down’ (deiectus); even the future reward of being an angle will only be a ‘yoke’ and a ‘burden’ (iugum, onus).63 It further has power over the courses of health and disease. Perhaps this is because of a parallel construction with the ninth place: the fifth is the western side of the IC, the ninth the western side of the MC (to which Manilius assigns the ‘defects and fortune’ of our bodies).64 This association with sickness and health is unlike traditional descriptions of the fifth, which stress fertility and children. A few references to illness and the fifth can be found, however: Firmicus associates illness with Mercury in the fifth with a waxing or waning Moon;65 Rhetorius makes the same association of Mercury and Moon to illness when in the fifth or eleventh.66 By contrast, Paulus67 and Olympiodorus68 say Jupiter in the elev-enth (the fifth is not mentioned) has the power to prevent injury and illness.Though health is often important for happiness, its inclusion here hardly makes the fifth a place of automatic good fortune. In Manilius’s scheme, health is a battleground for god in a war with the power of chance or accident (casus, not fortuna): ‘with the twin forces of chance and god’.69 The adversarial rela-tionship of god and accident is interesting: is god not all-prevailing over the power of chance? Or is chance associated with the daimon as opposed to god?For the name of this place, says Manilius, is ‘Daemonie’.70 Manilius reverses what other astrologers do: he calls the eleventh ‘Fortune’ and the fifth ‘Daemonie’. When ‘Daemonie’ is used for the name of an astrological place (its 63 2.891–892, 895–896.64 2.907–908: ‘. . . corpora nostra / concipiunt vitia et fortunam . . .’. Further supporting a parallel construction, the description of the ninth immediately follows that of the fifth. Housman (Manilius, Astronomicon, Liber Secundus, ed. A. E. Housman (London: Grant Richards, 1912), xxx, gives the places located in terms of east and west of the MC/IC axis.65 Mathesis, III, 7.10.66 Compendium, in CCAG VIII/4, 154.10–12; 174.8–11.67 Paulus, ch. 24 ( Boer, 69.14–15).68 Olympiodorus, ch. 23 (Boer, 73.26–27).69 2.903: ‘viribus ambiguam geminis casusque deique’.70 2.897: ‘Daemonien memorant Grai . . .’. Hübner, Dodekatropos, 54–58, suggests Mars should be assigned to this house, where it has migrated from the 6th to replace a Venus gone to the 10th. It is an intriguing suggestion, but his evidence seems tortuous and some-what unconvincing. If Manilius meant for Mars to be the god of the 5th, why didn’t he say so? He is perfectly clear about Venus in the 10th."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 61Keeping in Good Spiritsuse in general is very rare),71 it is for the sixth,72 where the association is with a ‘bad daimon’, not a good one. But Manilius says, ‘Keep in your wise heart the place and its divine authority (numen), and its powerful name . . .’.73 This does not seem to be apotropaic against a bad daimon.I see two possible explanations for this use of daimonie. First, this melding of divine authority with the name of Daimon may be a throwback to an ear-lier concept of daimon. Daimonie is used as a form of address in Homer and Hesiod, a tacit acknowledgement of the divinity which prompts, warns or gives insight to the human.74 Is the power of the fifth, then, the daimonic power of the ministering and administrating daimon to carry out the numen of god? Calling the place ‘Daimonie’ (and not associating a god with it) may be akin to something like the Middle Platonic hierarchical levels of divinity, with an all-powerful ‘primary’ God at the top and daimons, with limited power, at the lowest divine level.75My second explanation considers the Egyptian/Demotic characterisation of this place as tꜢ špšy(t), the Egyptian divinity Shepset, a goddess of wealth and nobility who was personally assigned to each human at birth.76 Manilius says ‘Daimonien memorant Grai’ (2.897); he uses the verb memoro, ‘recall, speak of ’, not nomino or appello, but in fact this attribution does not appear in Greek writings. We have already seen that Manilius may follow Egyptian doctrine in associating the tenth with Venus. Could it be that here Manilius is drawing not from Greek doctrine, but Egyptian doctrine—from the Egyptian Shepset who, as a lesser divinity and female, would thus be considered ‘daimonie’? In this case, Shepset may represent a (good) fortune that is by chance (casus). We shall explore this idea further in Chapter Three, 2.3.71 The TLL (V.1, s.v. ‘daemonius’) gives only three references: this one (2.897), the one referring to the fourth place (2.938) and one from Verecundus, which appears to mean ‘demonic’ and seems unrelated to this connotation of ‘daimonie’. The Library of Latin Texts gives only this (2.897) for ‘daimonie’.72 Goold reports (Loeb trans., 153, note d) that ‘Housman can only find two occurrences of the term [Daimonie], each obscure and signifying temple 6 . . .’. The references are to P.

Thus these are the seven places which are preferred. . . .77Hephaestio follows Dorotheus also.78 Here is the usual association of the fifth with children (Demotic charts also called the fifth the house of the child).79 Dorotheus tells us that a malefic in the eleventh ‘indicates destruction and weakness’ [of property],80 but most authors (especially Valens) say otherwise, that a malefic’s power to do bad is blunted because of the inherent goodness of the eleventh.Children are discerned mainly from the fifth, but their sex from the Midheaven and the eleventh, according to Dorotheus;81 he also looks at Jupiter for children (II, 8), perhaps a reason why the eleventh is involved in the ques-tion of children. (Perhaps the Midheaven is used because of the connection of Venus—by the Egyptians and Manilius—to the tenth.) The number and vital-ity of children are determined from these places. In event charts and interro-gations, a significating planet in the tenth or eleventh is given great power.82Elsewhere Dorotheus (at least in the Arabic version of his text), like Manilius, also uses the word ‘fortune’ for the eleventh: ‘. . . the eleventh sign, which is the sign of fortune . . .’.83 Dorotheus illustrates the power of the 77 Dorotheus, I, 5.2–3 (Pingree, 164).

Dorotheus’s interpretation of a ‘wealthy’ native is interesting, because one would expect more of an emphasis on Saturn, as a diurnal planet in a diurnal chart; and Saturn, in the eighth, ought not to be very good for fortune. But Dorotheus, instead, emphasises Mercury in the eleventh. Two reasons are possible for this: the eleventh as a ‘place of fortune’85 trumps the primary triplicity ruler; and the Lot of Fortune also falls in the eleventh (though Dorotheus does not mention it), thus amplifying the possibility of wealth, power, eminence and fortune. The power of the eleventh and Fortune preempt the proper sect ruler and the badness of the eighth. In other examples in this chapter, Dorotheus predicts a good outcome if both triplicity lords are in good places, a bad outcome if both are in bad places. (This is the only example he gives with one triplicity lord in a good place and one in a bad place.)2.5 Thrasyllus, Antiochus of Athens, P. Mich.inv. 1, 149These three authors are representative of the mainstream tradition of the eleventh and fifth places. Thrasyllus (d. ca. 36 CE, astrologer to Tiberius) purportedly gives the doctrine of ‘Hermes Trismegistus’ in the following descriptions. He says that the Hour-marker is ‘a rudder and indicative of for-tune, soul and manner of life’ (this must be a general sort of fortune), the fifth is ‘Good Fortune’ and the ‘11th zodiac sign in the chart he [i.e. Hermes] called Good Daimon’.86 Thrasyllus may be the earliest author to refer to the eleventh as the place of the Good Daimon.The author of P. Mich.inv. 1, 149, which was transcribed and translated by Frank E. Robbins,87 tells us that his descriptions of the places come from 85 The Arabic uses the word makaan, ‘place’ in a non-technical sense; the normal astrolog-ical word for place is bayt (house). (I thank Charles Burnett for examining the Arabic for me.) We cannot tell whether Dorotheus merely means the 11th as a place of fortune, or the specific place of the Lot of Fortune.

In the Thesaurus, he tells us that the ‘post-ascension of the Midheaven’ is an ‘operative’ place, along with the four angles, the fifth and the ninth.90 His Introduction has more detail: ‘The fifth place is called Good Fortune, signify-ing both the acquisition of living beings91 and the increase of things pertaining to living.’92 This is slightly unusual, not only because of the reference to what might be called ‘chattel’ (that seems more a concern of the sixth place), but because acquisitions are usually assigned to the eleventh place (the eleventh place from the Lot of Fortune is, in Vettius Valens, a ‘place of acquisition’).93 For Antiochus, the eleventh is ‘the post-ascension of the Midheaven and Good Daimon, and signifies increase of future revenue.’942.6 Ptolemy and HephaestioPtolemy uses the eleventh place only in connection with determining life expectancy.95 It is clear that he values the eleventh not for its significance as a place of the ‘Good Daimon’, but for its geometrical relationship to the degrees of the Hour-marker (Ascendant).

Note that all these aspects/figures are right-hand ones (the left-hand ones fall under the horizon).98 This association of the right with being above the hori-zon may influence the power given, in general, to the places above the horizon like the eleventh, the midheaven, the ninth and the seventh. In Arabic astrol-ogy, when the hemispheres created by the horizon become more important in the determination of the sectal dignity of a planet, a nocturnal planet in ‘ḥayyiz’ is always in the upper hemisphere of the chart.Hephaestio follows the scheme of Ptolemy precisely, and reminds us that the ‘5 degrees in pre-ascension behind the Hour-marking degree up to the remaining 25 degrees post-ascending’99 encompass the degrees which can be taken as aphetic for the other places in a right-hand geometrical relationship to these Hour-marking degrees.For children, Ptolemy prefers the Midheaven and eleventh, because they are ‘consequent to the place concerning marriage’ (i.e., the seventh), although he says that one can also look at the ‘diameter’ of these, i.e., the fourth and fifth places.100One place where Ptolemy and Hephaestio differ is in their coverage of katarchic charts. In Book III, Hephaestio incorporates the fifth and the elev-enth places into his schemes for interpreting these charts. In a katarchē for a banquet, the fifth shows those who are invited, and the eleventh the prepa-ration for the feast.101 He also delineates the ninth, tenth and eleventh in a 96 For definition, see Appendix I.A, 3.1., 412.97 Tetrabiblos, III, 11.563–575 (Hübner).98 For more on the strength of right vs. left, see Chapter 4, 2.5, 154–55.99 Hephaestio, Apotelesmatika, II, 11.3 (Pingree, I, 116.18–20): . . . ε̅ μοιρῶν εἰς τοὐπίσω προανηνεγμένον τῆς ὡροσκοπούσης μοίρας μέχρι τῶν λοιπῶν καὶ ἐπαναφερομένων μοιρῶν κ̅ε̅. . . .100 Tetrabiblos IV, 6.383–387 (Hübner).101 Hephaestio, III, 36.3 (Pingree, I, 294.16, 19); also Ep.

The order is secondary (zodiacal) motion, so the passage of time is correlated to the movement the planets make through the zodiac. The angles, which mark changes in direction and time, represent the present, the actuality of events and where change becomes real. Declines are the past, which cannot be changed. The succedent places, then, represent the uncertain (to humans) future, where change is unrealised. Two succedents are the Good Fortune and Daimon places, where benefics rejoice; are these places, then, where change can be negotiated?2.7 Vettius ValensValens comprehensively covers both the power and the meaning of the places. Like Ptolemy, he suggests the eleventh to determine children; the fifth is inspected for marriage (II, 16). The eleventh always bestows good things, espe-cially with benefics, but even malefics there ‘do not have the capacity to do any evil’.104 Hephaestio also mentions this as a dictum of some of the ‘ancients’ (including Porphyry): ‘when malefics happen to be present in this place, the 11th, . . . they do not do evil; all the same, one must admit that they harm to a certain degree as the age [of life] progresses.’105The fifth place, as well, is a place of good things. Planets in the fifth, espe-cially if they rule the Ascendant or the Lot of Fortune, bring about great good fortune, based on each planet’s particular powers. Aphrodite will make them wealthy and honoured, Ares generals or tyrants, Kronos property-holders and founders of villages, the Sun those who are close to kings, Hermes advancing through words, and the Moon those who are long-lived.106102 Hephaestio, III, 4.3 (Pingree, I, 231.24–27).

For example, if one were asking about siblings, one would make the third place, which represents sib-lings, the first place. The natal first place would become the ‘Good Daimon and place of [children and]107 friends.’108 In other words, the first place is in an eleventh-place position to the third, and thus becomes the sibling’s children and friends. The same is done for the other places in relation to the third.Valens also does some rather unusual things in regard to the Good Daimon and Good Fortune places. First, he highlights the power of the eleventh place in his techniques utilising the Lot of Fortune: the eleventh place from Fortune is seen as ‘acquisitive, a giver of goods and possessions, especially when benefics are in it or witnessing.’109 This idea seemingly arises from the ability of the eleventh to provide benefits, particularly acquisition of goods. When describ-ing the signs in Book I, Valens calls Taurus the ‘acquisitive zodiac sign of the cosmos’, a reference to the thema mundi which has Cancer as its Ascendant; the eleventh place/sign would thus be Taurus).110Second, Valens explains that the power of the Good Daimon or Fortune places can give a sextile the power of a trine:Sextiles with one another [sc. planets] become more moderate in power.

It is a distinct tribute, in any case, to the power of the fifth and eleventh places to do such a thing. This capacity is augmented when the sextile crosses the solsticial axis, or especially the equinoctial axis, particularly the Aries point. This juxtaposition of the fifth/eleventh axis with the equinoctial signs is also intriguing. Is there an implicit suggestion that the power of daimōn and tuchē aligns with, even enhances, the power of the equinox? There is a similar passage in Firmicus, II, 22.8: ‘But those sextiles are more powerful which have tropical or bicorporeal signs in the middle, but those which are separated by solid signs are unproductive.’112 Here the reference to the fifth and eleventh places has been lost, and only the tropical remains, to which the mutable signs have been added.1132.8 Julius Firmicus MaternusThe Mathesis also deals with the places in great detail. Firmicus not only describes the places and their general assignations, but has exhaustive lists of how each planet behaves in the places, both singly and in tandem with other planets. I have selected examples to illustrate how Firmicus thinks about each of the places and their influences. Many of Firmicus’s descriptions correlate with those in the Liber Hermetis.114Book II contains Firmicus’s exposition of the places, beginning with the eight-place system (de octo locis). Children belong to the fifth. Then Firmicus discusses the important places in order; here, the fifth and eleventh (along with the third and ninth) are singled out for virtue: ‘After these four cardines . . . there are four other places in nativities which have ensuing and favourable power, 111 II, 17.32–33 (Pingree, 69.23–26): ἑξάγωνοι δὲ πρὸς ἀλλήλους μετριώτεροι τῇ δυνάμει γίνονται. ἐπὶ μέντοι τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ δαίμονος καὶ τῆς ἀγαθῆς τύχης οὐδὲν ἀπέχουσι τοῦ τριγώνου, μάλιστα εἰ μέσον τροπικὸν ζῴδιον ἢ ἰσημερινὸν τύχῃ, πολὺ δὲ μᾶλλον ἐὰν Ἰχθύσι καὶ Ταύρῳ τὸ σχῆμα θεωρηθῇ.112 Mathesis, II, 22.8 (KSZ, I, 70.19–22 = Monat, I, 124): ‘Sed exagona illa sunt potiora, quae habent in medio tropica vel duplicia signa, inefficacia vero, quae signis solidis dividuntur.’113 We cannot say that Firmicus knew this doctrine from Valens.

For the fifth, he says: ‘From this place the num-ber of children and the quality of their descent is found. It is called, moreover, Good Fortune, because it is the place of Venus.’116 Firmicus makes much of the fact that the fifth trines the Ascendant, even though the Midheaven (if set in the eleventh) sometimes opposes it.117 The eleventh, he says, ‘is called Good Daemon or Good Genius by us, agathos daemon by the Greeks. In this place the Midheaven is frequently found by degree. Moreover, it is the place of Jupiter and is joined in no paltry association with the Horoscope; for it sees the Horoscope from a sextile . . .’.118Many sections of the Mathesis deal with the effects of planets in the places, in various configurations and permutations. Chapters 2–13 of Book III describe all the planets in the places. Sect is always an important factor in how well or badly the planet behaves. Thus Saturn by day and Mars by night are always better than the reverse. The fifth and the eleventh, in general, are concerned with acquiring power, status and/or fortunes, and keeping them. In addition, the fifth gives indications for children based on planets in it and aspects to it. In VI, 30, Firmicus gives mythical charts of famous Greeks; all these charts have the same configurations (but in different signs) which emphasise the trine relationship of the Ascendant to the fifth and the ninth. Each chart is cleverly arranged to fit with the attributes of its holder. For example, ‘Homer’s’ chart has the fifth place Moon in Aries in the degrees that cause blindness, trining Mars and Mercury in the first, a fitting placement for a blind poet who wrote about war.115 II, 16.1 (KSZ, I, 59.14–19 = Monat, I, 111–112): ‘Post hos quattuor cardines . . . alia sunt in gen-ituris quattuor loca, quae sequentem et secundam habent potestatem, id est Dea Deus Bona fortuna ac Bonus daemon, quae a Graecis hactenus nominantur: thea, theos, agathe tyche, agathos daemon.’116 II, 19.6 (KSZ, I, 62.18–20 = Monat, I, 115): ‘Ex hoc loco filiorum numerus et generis qualitas invenitur.

But Venus and Jupiter together in the fifth or eleventh producing ‘difficult marriages’ (difficiles nuptias) is non-sensical. Pariter here must mean, not ‘together’ as in ‘in the same place’, but ‘at the same time’, meaning that Venus and Jupiter must be opposed to each other in either the fifth or the eleventh: this opposition of the benefics could indeed produce marital difficulties and fights. The translation should read:If Venus and Jupiter are <set> at the same time in the 5th place from the Horoscope or in the 11th, and no star aspects them from another portion, they decree difficult marriages or severe hostilities arising from the mar-riages, so that always entangled in furious disagreements, they keep on having quarrels of malicious hostility.This description shows that even benefics in the fifth or the eleventh, if they are opposed, can bring about unpleasant situations.Another passage in Book VI copies the astrological poet Anubio. Firmicus says:If Mercury, the Moon and Venus together are located in the 11th from the Horoscopic place, and the sign [in the eleventh] is feminine, and Mars regards them with a trinal ray, they produce musicians, who always with sweet melody pluck the strings of the lyre or cithara.123121 It made no sense for it to be inserted in the first place. The two benefics are Venus and Jupiter; there is no ‘third’ benefic. It may be that what Firmicus meant by an aspect from another star was a ‘good’ aspect.122 J.

Only when malefics are in the fifth or eleventh, in dif-ficult aspect to other planets, do they bring about violent deaths.126 The oppo-sition of malefics in the eleventh and fifth is always unfortunate.127Finally, there is an interesting remark from Book VI:But both the fifth and the eleventh places from the Horoscope, that is, Good Fortune <and Good Daemon>, differ from the inactive baseness of the idle places, nor are they joined in any association of ray [aspect] to idle and dejected places, but are united with the Horoscope in a happy association of ray.128This passage suggests some rationale for the goodness of the fifth and elev-enth places beyond being in trine and sextile to the Ascendant. Neither is in a geometric relationship with the sixth and twelfth, the worst places in the chart. They are, of course, in square to the eighth, which is the ‘idle’ place par excellence. But perhaps it is enough for them to have no relationship with the sixth or twelfth (they are the only non-angular places to have no relationship with the sixth or twelfth).129 Might this suggest that one of the things that makes a place ‘good’ is that it is not ‘contaminated’ by aspect to an unfortunate place? Could this even be one reason to make the fifth and eleventh places those of Good Fortune and Good Daimon? We normally think of the sixth 124 Anubio, 6 ii.41–44 (Obbink, 37): Στίλβων καὶ Μήν̣η̣ κα̣[ὶ εὐει]δ̣η�̣ς̣ Κ̣υ̣[θέρ]ε̣ι̣α̣ / Δαίμονος ειν̣α[. . .].[. ζῳ]δίῳ ι�̣στ̣άμ̣[εν]ο̣ι̣ / θήλε[ϊ] ἐν ζῳ�̣ῳ α[. . . . . . . τ]ρ̣ι�̣γωνος υ�̣π̣[άρ]χῃ / μο̣υ̣σ[ο]υ̣ρ̣γοὶ χ̣υ̣[.125 Ibid., 26–37.126 See, e.g., Firmicus, VII, 23.7 (= Liber Hermetis 36.6, XXXVI.29–33 [Feraboli, 235]); Firmicus, VII, 23.14 (= Liber Hermetis 36.17, XXXVI.68–69 [Feraboli, 237]); Firmicus, VII, 23.16 (= Liber Hermetis 36.20, XXXVI.78–79 [Feraboli, 238]).127 See Firmicus, VII, 23.17 (= Liber Hermetis 36.23, XXXVI.86–89 [Feraboli, p. 239]).128 VI, 1.3 (KSZ, II, 67.14–19 = Monat, III, 2–3); ‘Sed et quintus et undecimus ab horoscopo locus, id est bonae fortunae <et boni daemonis>, [signa] a pigrorum locorum inerti humilitate dissentiunt, nec cum pigris ac deiectis locis aliqua ra<dia>tionis societate <iunguntur, sed horoscopo felici societate radiationis> adsociantur.’129 The first and seventh also have no relationship with the sixth and twelfth.

The fifth, Good Fortune, delineates children and is a place where Aphrodite ‘rejoices more than all the [other] stars’.130 Both authors agree that benefics give many children, but malefics are ‘destructive’ for them.131In the Good Daimon place Zeus rejoices, and it is a place of ‘alliance and patronage’ and ‘good hopes’.132 The listings for the fifth place are quite short compared to the eleventh (and some other places). The fortune it gives seems to be just in children. (This may show the importance of having children in those times.) However, the fifth also mitigates the effect of malefics. The elev-enth is one of the longest descriptions.133 In terms of outcomes, it is almost as good as the tenth. In these place descriptions, the sect of some planets (Moon, Mars, Saturn) in relation to the sect of the chart is critical; if the sects align, all is well, but if not, the outcomes are bad. The exception seems to be Jupiter, which is good both by day and night. Mercury and Venus do not seem to be affected by sect, but only by aspects from malefics.2.10 RhetoriusAt the end of the era of Hellenistic astrology is the early seventh century compiler Rhetorius. Again, like Valens and Firmicus, his work aims to be a complete manual for the practice of astrology. He is a main source for other, lost authors as well. His long section on the places takes up almost fifty pages 130 Paulus, ch. 24 (Boer, 57.7–9): . . . ὁ τῆς Ἀφροδίτης ἀστὴρ παρὰ πάντας τοὺς ἀστέρας ἐν τούτῳ τῷ τόπῳ χαίρει.

Unlike other authors, Rhetorius includes in his descriptions how to delineate the rulers of other places falling in a particular place. This is done in both directions: when the ruler of the place in question is in another place, and when the ruler of another place is in the place in question. For example (using the fifth place), Rhetorius says:If the house-master of the 12th is in the 5th or 8th, or the lord of the 5th in the 12th, he will be a stepfather nurturing another’s children. If the lord of the 5th or the lord of the Lot of Children is in the 8th, it makes those who are childless or those who bury their children.135Here reciprocal placements can delineate the same outcome (ruler of the twelfth in the fifth or ruler of the fifth in the twelfth both produce stepfathers). In addition, the lord of the fifth in a bad place like the eighth (death) causes childlessness or child mortality.Rhetorius, like authors such as Valens, Firmicus, Paulus and Olympiodorus, also describes the effects of a particular planet in the place (he also includes the Nodes of the Moon). His delineations are similar to those of the others, in that benefics in good places bring good things, malefics in good places can be good or bad, and sect is always a factor. For example,When the Moon happens to be in the zodiac signs of the Good Daimon by night, he [sc. the native] will come to be most gracious; for it makes leaders, the glorious, those placed in the front seats and inheriting good things from women, if she does not happen to be witnessed by Kronos and Ares. By day it brings about living abroad, shows plainly estrange-ments from women, separations or orphanhood, but as time goes by it will produce those who are happy.136134 A critical edition of Rhetorius, begun by David Pingree, is in preparation by Stephan Heilen: Rhetorius, Compendium astrologicum secundum epitomen in cod.

By contrast, placements out of sect bring ‘growth opportunities’ that only provide eventual happiness after delays.Rhetorius includes the eleventh’s connection with the ages of life, specif-ically the ‘third age of life, and it signifies reckoning about action, patronage and authority at the culmination of youth.’137 In the standard doctrine the quadrant between the Ascendant and Midheaven represents the first quarter of life, youth (see, e.g., Manilius, Dorotheus, Paulus). Here the eleventh is the last (third) stage of youth before adulthood, assuming the first is birth and the twelfth is childhood. For Serapion, the eleventh is the last part of middle age, the ninth the first part and the Midheaven the middle of the life.1382.11 ConclusionThis overview has shown the general goodness of both the Good Daimon and Good Fortune places, along with evidence that the two were often con-sidered as a pair (this is standard Hellenistic astrological procedure for each place and its diametrical opposite, and is also the case in Demotic astrology). Because of the cultural link already established between daimōn and tuchē, the astrological connection between them is both natural and reinforced. By knowing the cultural history of Daimon and Fortune, we gain insight into how past astrologers viewed these issues and, within astrological theory and practice, incorporated the way that Agathos Daimon and Agathe Tyche were employed in the religious and philosophical life of the Greco-Roman world.This examination now provides a backdrop for the next chapter, which explores the Agathos Daimon, Agathe Tyche and their Egyptian equivalents in more depth. There are some interesting correlations between what astrologers do with Good Daimon and Fortune and with the way they are incorporated into the cultural and religious milieu of the Hellenistic and Roman periods. The concept of fate, in both Greek and Egyptian guise, will figure in this discus-sion. This will lead to some conclusions about why the Agathos Daimon and Agathe Tyche are used in astrological theory, technique and practice, and why studying the astrological practices of this time can aid in understanding some rather crucial philosophical and religious concepts which came to prominence in the period when astrology flourished.137 CCAG VIII/4, 170.19–21: δηλοῖ δ’ ὁ ιαʹ τόπος καὶ τὴν τρίτην ἡλικίαν· σημαίνει δὲ καὶ περὶ πράξεως καὶ πατρωνίας καὶ προστασίας λόγον κατὰ τὴν ἀκμὴν τῆς νεότητος.138 CCAG VIII/4, 231.26–28; see also Hübner, Raum, 125 and Diagram No. 13e; 305.

But connections of Daimon and Fortune to other cultures in the Mediterranean world, particularly Egypt, Mesopotamia and other areas in the Near East are equally essential to the study of the daimon in astrology. This chapter will thus establish the religious and philosophical significance, and the relationship, between fortune and daimon in non-Greek cultures. In this context, concepts of fate other than the Greek will be investigated in terms of their effect on astrological theory and practice.Our first task is to examine the cultural divinity Agathos Daimon as it exists in the late Hellenistic and Greco-Roman periods, especially in transition from Greece to Egypt. This will bring us to Alexandria and the presence of Agathos Daimon and Agathe Tyche in Egypt. This Egyptian entrée leads to the Agathos Daimon’s connection to the Egyptian god Shai (who is associated with destiny), and thereby the role of fate as it relates to astrological theory and practice.1 The Agathos Daimon and Agathe Tyche in Egypt (and Beyond)In this section, we examine first the transition of Agathos Daimon and Agathe Tyche from Greece to Egypt, the connection of Agathos Daimon to the com-posite god Sarapis and the Egyptian deity Shai, and Agathe Tyche to Isis.

The section ends with an excursus on Tyche at the Nabataean site of Khirbet et-Tannur.1.1 Sarapis and Isis: Agathos Daimon and Agathe TycheWhen Alexander conquered Egypt in 331 BCE, and founded the city of Alexandria, he paved the way for the Ptolemaic dynasties in Egypt. With the entry of the Greeks into Egypt, cultural assimilations and accommodations began. One practice gave equivalent Greek names to Egyptian gods: e.g., Ptah became Hephaestos, Hathor Aphrodite, Amun Zeus, Isis Demeter, Horus Apollo, Osiris Dionysus, Set Typhon.2 Another popularised Greco-Egyptian gods such as Sarapis.3 Sarapis is a composite of Osiris and the Apis bull and became popular as a cult figure among Greeks living in Alexandria. Because of his associations with Osiris, Sarapis’s consort became Isis, and the two have much cult iconography in Greco-Roman Egypt. He is a god of the dead (like Osiris), but also a god of fertility, especially of the land; he often holds a cornu-copia.4 His human-form iconography pictures him as a bearded, curly-haired man, wearing a kalathos (grain measure) on his head, accompanied by veg-etal symbols of fertility.5 Macrobius associates him with the sun (Saturnalia, I, 20.13–15), and Sarapis and Isis are called Helios and Selene in an Isis aretalogy.6 Like Asclepius, Sarapis becomes connected with healing, and has sanctuaries for incubation cures.72 F.

In the Roman period, Sarapis became the special patron god of Alexandria; in The Potter’s Oracle, Agathos Daimon is associated with this city even earlier (see 1.2 below). Sarapis may even link to the Agathos Daimon because of that deity’s association with Alexandria.8The Ptolemies made much of the new deity; Ptolemy III built a Sarapeum at Alexandria, and Sarapis and Isis were featured on coins.9 With Isis and Sarapis the Greek Ptolemies could acquire a little Egyptian patina. But except for Memphis, where the cult of Sarapis was more attuned to the original Egyptian ‘Osor-Hapi’ (Wsı ̓r-Ḥp),10 the native Egyptians do not appear to have embraced the new cult of Sarapis.11In addition, Sarapis and Isis are linked to the names Agathos Daimon and Agathe Tyche. They often appear in snake form, and sometimes their iconography merges; there are instances of snakes with Sarapis (or Agathos Daimon?) heads as well as snakes with Isis heads.12 The snake motif in these Greco-Egyptian representations arises from ties to the Egyptian deities Shai (god of ‘fate’; see below, 1.2, 2.1 and 2.5) and Renenet (goddess of nourishment; see 2.2), who can be represented in this guise. In iconography, as Françoise Dunand’s studies show, Agathos Daimon is often pictured with Thermouthis (Agathe Tyche).13 Often the two deities are pictured together, as a couple, and worshipped at the same shrine. This is true both in Greece and in Egypt. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish which syncretic deity—Shai/Agathos 8 M. Pietrzykowski, ‘Sarapis—Agathos Daimon’, in Hommages à Maarten J.

In the case of the Agathos Daimon, some Alexandrian coins from the times of Hadrian to Antoninus Pius depict an altar,15 which Susan Handler, accepting the pro-posal of J. Vogt, believes is the altar of Agathos Daimon supposedly erected by Alexander when he founded the city16 (Figure 3.1).The coin, Handler says, ‘depicts an agathos daimon serpent wearing a skhent on one side of the altar, with a uraeus serpent wearing a two-horned sun disk on the other.’17 It is hard to see the headdresses in the photograph, but surely this is a representation not just of Agathos Daimon/(Shai), but also his companion Isis/Thermouthis/(Agathe Tyche).1814 E.g., image 123 (Sarapis), LIMC VII/2, 511 = image 3 (Agathodaimon), LIMC I/2, 203; often the images and descriptions in Dunand, ‘Agathodémon’ are labelled ‘Isis-Thermouthis’, ‘Sarapis-Agathodémon’; see also the various syncretisms given in LIMC, I/2, 277.

From the late Hellenistic (ca. 166 BCE), a cult to Agathe Tyche, as well as Sarapeia and dedications to the Agathos Daimon, existed on Delos.23 Similar cults arose in Alexandria.24 Just as Sarapis becomes the polis god of Alexandria, Agathe Tyche too is an important polis goddess (famously, e.g., in Antioch).25 On the political and religious front, Ptolemaic queens have associations with both Agathe Tyche and Isis.26 Oaths are sworn by the Daimon (= Demotic Pshai) of the Ptolemies.27 The relationship between the Agathos Daimon and Shai forms a significant part of this complex.1.2 The Agathos Daimon and ShaiIn the Ptolemaic period, the name of the Agathos Daimon arrived in Egypt.

Most important, perhaps, are their links with ideas of destiny; but Greek conceptions of fate are not the same as Egyptian ones, as we will see below.The Agathos Daimon makes a famous appearance in The Potter’s Oracle.30 This late tale falls in the genre of apocalyptic literature, to which parts of the Hermetic Asclepius bear a strong resemblance.31 Only a Greek version, in second and third century CE papyri, exists, but internal allusions date it to ca. 130 BCE.32 It tells of the prophecy of a potter concerning the destruction of Alexandria, and the return of its Agathos Daimon to Memphis (its outlook is strongly anti-Greek). The relevant passages read:And the belt-wearers [the Greeks] will destroy themselves, for they are followers of Typhon. Then Agathos Daimon will abandon the city that is being built [i.e. Alexandria] and will emigrate to god-bearing Memphis. . . . . . . the city by the sea will be transformed into a drying-place 28 We explore his attributes more fully below, in 4.1.29 Quaegebeur, Shaï, 171.

The pas-sage harks back to a better time, when the gods of Egypt had not gone to pro-tect a foreign-founded city. It contrasts the ‘upstart’ Alexandria with Memphis, one of the oldest Egyptian cities. It shows the importance of the god to the city’s prosperity: it was not unusual for a city to have a guardian daimon in this period. Even putting aside which possible meanings and associations to apply to the Egyptian Agathos Daimon here,35 we still see acknowledged the magni-tude of its power, as the guardian god of the city. The departure of the city’s god seals the fate of the city to wither into obscurity. The abandonment of the city’s personal daimon is the kiss of death.The Potter’s Oracle seemingly implies that the (Greek) Agathos Daimon came to Egypt with the founding of Alexandria, and some scholars assert that 33 P2 (P.

The indigenous, harmless snakes there were revered as incarnations of the great snake represented by the Agathos Daimon.37 Yet there is evidence of genuine Egyptian (Demotic) roots in the Alexander Romance, at least in the Nectanebo material.38 And outside of the Alexander Romance, Quaegebeur has demonstrated that, in fact, the way that Agathos Daimon was employed in the Greco-Roman texts and iconogra-phy reveals its faithfulness to Egyptian roots, particularly to Shai.39 Quaegebeur has made a good case for proposing that the equation of Shai to the Agathos Daimon was founded not on applying Greek characteristics to the Egyptian God, but the other way around: Shai gave his features to the Agathos Daimon.If, then, ‘Agathos Daimon’ just translated ‘Shai’ for the inhabitants of Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt, and was not meant to signify a wholesale transference of the Greek concept of the Agathos Daimon into Alexandrian Egypt,40 this provides some help in teasing out the development of the fate concepts associated with the later Agathos Daimon in Roman Egypt. In other words, Egyptian concepts of fate may have influenced the way the (agathos) daimōn was perceived in the later period, in areas outside Greece proper. This in turn aids in understanding the astrological daimon and its relationship to fate and providence. The ideas associated with Shai in Egyptian culture and 36 E.g., A.

However, I disagree with Quack’s (339, commentary 362) changing of šꜢy to sḫny.w (following P. Insinger) in line 56 (‘translating’ εἱμαρμένον), since the same word is used in line 55; see my n. 118 below.61 Bergman, ‘I Overcome Fate’, 44 and n. 1 mentions P. Oxy. 1380 (another Isis aretalogy) which actually calls Isis ‘pronoia’ (see Totti, Ausgewählte Texte, 65, lines 43–44, 85); in this hymn, though, it is only (strongly) implied. See also Apuleius, Metamorphoses, XI, 12 (Helm, 275.20–21), referring to Isis: ‘. . . by the providence of the greatest goddess . . .’ ‘. . . deae maximae providentia . . .’.62 There is also a correlation between heimarmenē and law outlined in De fato 568d. See below, 2.4, 103 and Chapter 1, 2.1, 29; 3.3, 37, n. 75; 3.4, 40, n. 86.63 The Egyptian outlook is discussed by Fowden, The Egyptian Hermes, 46–47, whether or not the poem is a translation from Egyptian.

The functions and powers of these two kinds of fortune are so different that it is almost as if the two, blind and seeing, are connected in name only. The first is connected to chance, the second to providence.

In the center of this zodiac is a bust of Tyche; the entire zodiac ring and Tyche is supported by a winged Nike. Other astrological iconography includes seven planetary busts on the Inner Temenos Enclosure Frieze67 and twelve zodiac busts on two pilasters of Altar Platform 3.68 Though this is not the place to make a thorough analysis of the astrological material,69 the intersection of Tyche and astrology at this site is worth examining.The zodiac is unusual. Although it appears in a typical ring, the signs are divided: at the top of the circle, Aries on the top left runs counter-clockwise down the left side to Virgo, while Libra on the top right runs clockwise down the right side to Pisces (Virgo and Pisces missing in the photograph). Icono-graphically, zodiacs may run either clockwise or counter-clockwise, but very few zodiacs run in two directions.70 No other extant zodiac puts Aries and Libra at the top of the circle with their consecutive signs running in opposite directions.A compelling feature is the Tyche in the centre of the zodiac. She is identi-fied as such by her mural crown and veil; behind her on the left is a crescent moon and on the right two sticks joined together, one ending in a crescent-like shape and the other topped with an ear of wheat or possibly a pine cone.71 65 N.

According to McKenzie et al.’s reconstruction, these were placed in a niche on the Altar Platform, possibly with the Tyche Zodiac suspended between them on the back wall.75 Since the temple faced almost due east (it is within 1°30’), at the equinoxes the rays of the sun would have struck ‘the niche exactly between the cult statues.’7672 Ibid., I, 83 (fig. 91).

This evidence suggests that the cult god and goddess at Khirbet et-Tannur took on aspects of foreign gods, especially Sarapis, Isis and Tyche, coupled with local gods. Given Sarapis’s associations with the Agathos Daimon in Egypt, it is possible that the cult god at Khirbet et-Tannur implicitly incorporated the Agathos Daimon aspect as well, given the cult goddess’s associations to Tyche.Other Near Eastern sites provide further evidence of Tyche and Genius cults. Three adjacent altars on the Palmyrene Gate at Dura-Europos (in north-ern Syria) contain inscriptions in Palmyrene Aramaic to Gad (gd), equivalent to Tyche,81 in Greek to the Tyche of Dura (Τύχη Δούρας) and in Latin to the Genius of Dura (‘genio Dura’).82 Lucinda Dirven has concluded: ‘From this it may be inferred that Tyche, Gad and Genius were identical notions to the Roman troops stationed at Dura.’83 However, as far as Tyche and Genius are concerned, on religious grounds there is no reason why a Tyche and a Genius of a place cannot both be propitiated.

We do not know under what names the god and goddess were worshipped here,85 but their links to Sarapis and Isis (who in Egypt have explicit links to Agathos Daimon and Agathe Tyche) seem clear, and the link to Tyche is undeniable. The astrological components of the site combine with the powers of god and goddess to address the par-ticular concerns of human fortune, fate and worship on both an earthly and heavenly level.We now return to Egypt to consider the importance of the Egyptian deity Shai to the Agathos Daimon and conceptions of fate.2 Shai, the Agathos Daimon and FateWe have already seen correlations between the Egyptian god Shai and the Greek Agathos Daimon. Now we explore Shai’s attributes in more detail, as well as those of goddesses linked to him, namely Renenet, Meskhenet and Shepset. Since Shai is associated with fate or destiny, by investigating his attributes, including the origins and meaning of his name, we may then com-pare Egyptian ideas with notions of fate in two other cultures, Greek and Mesopotamian. These may have implications for notions of astrological fate.2.1 Shai as an Egyptian DeityShai is a shape-shifting deity with no consistent guise. He personifies what we, conveniently, call ‘fate’ (but meaning, in a most elementary sense in Egyptian, ‘what is decreed’). Sometimes he carries out the will of other gods concerning that fate, but other times dispenses it on his own. He is a protective local deity 84 On cultic practices by the Roman Military at their places of deployment, see O. Stoll, ‘The Religions of the Armies’, in A Companion to the Roman Army, ed. Paul Erdkamp (Oxford/Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd., 2007), 467: ‘Even the sacred areas . . . are part of this cultic activity at the place of deployment . . . dedicating an altar . . . most importantly and frequently to the Genius huius loci, the tutelary spirit of the previous place, was cus-tomary and possibly obligatory when leaving one place . . .’. This is exactly the situation for the Dura-Europos inscription to the genius Dura, which was dedicated by veterans (‘emeriti’).85 McKenzie et al., The Nabataean Temple at Khirbet et-Tannur, I, 226."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 396but also a personal protector. In other words, he is difficult to pin down.86 The main elements of his attributes follow.Shai as a god personifying fate is first attested in Egyptian writings in the New Kingdom. In some inscriptions (e.g., the funerary chapel of Ramses I at Abydos), he appears as a god (along with the goddess Renenet) who carries out a divine commandment, but does not necessarily decree himself: ‘Shai is before them as well as Renenet: they act in accordance with what has been commanded’.87In other instances, however, Shai is clearly responsible for a fate given at the moment of birth, which is revisited at the moment of death. A well-known portrayal of Shai is in the Papyrus of Ani, a famous rendition of the Book of the Dead (better translated as the Book of Going Forth by Day). In this text, one of the most important scenes is the weighing of the heart, and here Shai, along with Meskhenet (goddess of childbirth) and Renenet (goddess of nurturing), stands by as the heart of Ani is judged against the maat-feather of truth and rightness (Figure 3.4).Shai is represented in human form with a bull’s tail.88 As proof of his divine status, his name is written with the god-determinative. Meskhenet’s name sports the bed determinative, symbolising her function as a divine midwife; and Renenet has both the determinative of a woman nursing, and the snake determinative that becomes synonymous in later periods with both Shai and Renenet. Ani’s Ba, his soul (pictured in the form of a bird with Ani’s head), also watches the proceedings.Here the moment of birth and the destinies decreed thereby are connected with the moment of death and the ultimate fate of the deceased. The presence of these ‘fate’ divinities, along with Ani’s Ba, suggests further that ‘what has been decreed’ at the beginning of life can change to some extent through the actual living of that life, and how the person deals with what they have been given.89 If all has been ordained and settled in advance, why would the deities 86 In this he is not unlike the Greek conception of the daimon, with its various conceptions.87 šꜢy m-bꜢḥ-sn mı ̓tt rnn.t ı ̓r-sn ḫft wḏḏ.t.

Indeed, why have a weighing of the heart at all?There is some question as to whether divinities like Shai and Renenet were of the same stature as gods, or whether they should be considered as something less. In Egyptian culture, all divinities are called ‘gods’ (nṯrw),91 but 90 See also R. O. Faulkner and O. Goelet, Jr., The Egyptian Book of the Dead: The Book of Going Forth by Day (San Francisco: Chronicle Books, 1994), 155 (commentary on Plate 3).91 D. Meeks, ‘Demons’, in The Ancient Gods Speak, ed. Donald B. Redford (Oxford/New York: Oxford University Press, 2002), 102. The concept of nṯr has been historically difficult to categorise. It contains the sense of divine, and is often translated as ‘god’, but its seman-tic field is different from that of other cultures (such as the Greek theos). See Dunand and Zivie-Coche, Gods and Men, 7–13. O. E. Kaper, The Egyptian God Tutu: A Study of the Sphinx-God and Master of Demons with a Corpus of Monuments (Leuven: Peeters, 2003), 122, remarks: ‘Egyptian gods are notoriously hard to classify, as there is a fluidity to their nature which allows them to manifest themselves on different levels at the same time.’ See also E.

In this role they are not unlike Hesiod’s guardian daimons, or even Plato’s daimon chosen by the souls in the Myth of Er97 (I do not imply that they had all the Hesiodic or Platonic functions). But the distinction between god and daimon is not an Egyptian one.The connection of Shai and his companions with birth is critical, because the appearance of deities who give one’s fate at the moment of birth show the importance that having a destiny played in Egyptian thought,98 especially in the New Kingdom and after.99 Meskhenet oversees the labour, and supplies ‘the personal stock of capabilities given to each person at his birth’, which was not to be tampered with by the person during his lifetime.100430–46, theorises that an entity becomes a nṯr through ritual as a means of divinisation. See also the summary of M.-A. Bohême, ‘Divinity’, in The Ancient Gods Speak, ed. Donald B. Redford (Oxford/New York: Oxford University Press, 2002), 106–12.92 Meeks, ‘Demons’, 103–04. Meeks admits this is a contrivance of modern scholarship, not indigenously Egyptian (102). In his ‘Notion de dieu’, 429, he says that nṯrw are not only what we would call ‘gods’, but also spirits, abstract concepts, kings, animals and even the ordinary dead.93 Kaper, The Egyptian God Tutu, 122, n. 58, citing K. A. Kitchen, Ramesside Inscriptions, VI, 22.6, points out that Egyptians did acknowledge a hierarchy of divine beings—both great (wrw) and small (nḏsw) gods (this inscription is from Ramesses IV’s Stela to the Gods from Abydos).94 Quaegebeur, Shaï, e.g., 149, 151–53.95 Ibid., 150.96 A parallel to this text refers to the ‘serpent Neshaï’ (ibid., 150–51) and not to Shai.97 Hesiod, Works and Days, 121–23, 252–55; Plato, Republic, 617d–e, 620d–e.98 I do not mean to imply that Shai and the others discussed here are the only divinities associated with fate: Hathor (e.g., the ‘Seven Hathors’) and other gods also play a role. But especially in later texts, and in the Greco-Roman period, Shai and his companions do seem to be particularly important ‘fate’ deities. (And Shai specifically links with the Agathos Daimon, which connects to Hellenistic astrology.)99 The Amarna period seems to be a critical turning point.100 Meeks, ‘Demons’, 104.

He will also give you the other ones!’104 Like the weighing of the heart, the implication is that these are not set immutably at birth, but may change during the course of a life depending on a person’s actions. Thausing links the Seven Hathors with the Pleiades.105 She also posits a starry connection between fate and the seven stars of the Great Bear which carry the scale which balances the world.106M. T.

It occurred not at actual sunrise, but in the twilight before dawn ‘when Sirius rose in the 11th hour of the night’ (61, quoting H.

They appear together many times both pictorially and literarily, and are perceived as complements of each other. Rnn means ‘to nurse’, and Renenet’s function in the beginning was as a goddess who nurtured children. Her name can be used interchangeably with that of the goddess Renenwetet, as Quaegebeur has shown.107 As Renenwetet she is in the Pyramid Texts, as a snake protecting the king. Renenwetet is a harvest goddess, associated with abundance and with the nourishment that is also Renenet’s function.Shai’s assimilation with snakes comes about through Renenet.108 Especially in the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods (before in some instances as well), Renenet is pictured in iconography either entirely or partially as a snake.109 The writing of her name can contain the snake, as well as the determinative of the nursing woman.110 In the Greco-Roman period, her name is Thermouthis, the companion of Agathos Daimon, with many of the same functions: as a Bestimmung’ which begins every year gives a template and a correlation to the ‘menschli-che Bestimmung’ which begins at birth (and is first applied to the king) (62; see also 55). This may, in fact, supply some understanding for the importance of the first place in astrol-ogy, which in modern depiction is shown as below the horizon, but in fact falls in that twilight period so important for ‘determination’. In the Demotic story ‘Setne Khaemwas II’, the eastern horizon, where the sun first rises, is even called ‘the beautiful horizon of Shai’ (3, 27–28, tꜢ Ꜣḫy.t nfr.t n pꜢ-šy [cited in Quaegebeur, Shaï, 168]), another indication of its importance in determining human fate. Thus at the moment of birth, the sign on the horizon determines the rest of the chart which symbolises human destiny astrologically.107 Quaegebeur, Shaï, 153: ‘Renenet et Renenoutet sont donc identiques quant à leur nom.’108 Ibid.109 E.g., see J.

The root of this word also means ‘rich’ or ‘wealthy’, which accounts for Shepset controlling good fortune. It can also mean ‘well-esteemed’, suggesting a good reputation. Shepset, like Shai and Renenet, is also a personal divine protector.113 Multiple Shepset-deities, and even related god-desses like Reret, are connected with a particular month,114 and therefore a ‘particular Shepset’ is assigned to a person at birth as her guardian.115 In the later version of her name, Tsepsis, she is often mentioned with the later version of Shai, Psais.116We have seen Isis linked to both Renenet and Shepset. Renenet becomes Agathe Tyche in her Greek guise, and is accordingly pictured with Shai as Agathos Daimon. In this function she is not the goddess of a good ‘chance’ or are left to think that the uraeus form in which many goddesses were incarnate was an essential vehicle for apprehending the divine in its feminine aspect.’111 Quaegebeur, Shaï, 153. For further discussion of Agathe Tyche and Renenet, see Barrett, Egyptianizing Figurines, 235–39.112 Broekhuis, De godin Renenwetet, ch. 5.6, 105–09, describes this assimilation and shows its antecedents in earlier texts (though the two goddesses do not actually merge before the Greco-Roman era).113 Quaegebeur, Shaï, 155: ‘génie personnel’; 157, ‘le génie personnel protecteur Shepset, com-parable à la fée-marraine ou à l’ange gardien . . .’.114 For more on multiple Shepsets and their attributes, see Quaegebeur, Shaï, 155–60 and K.

This Egyptian phrase, sḫn nfr, is precisely equivalent to ἀγαθῇ τύχῃ on the Rosetta Stone (see Urkunden II, 188, 1 [Dem. 21, Gr. 36]; idem in Text 37.9, 205, 11 [Dem. 8]); cited in Miosi, ‘God, Fate and Free Will’, 110, n. 68; see also Quaegebeur, Shaï, 141–42. This is literally a ‘good event’ or happening; it thus seizes the sense of tuchē as what ‘happens to be’, i.e. a chance occurrence. An interesting juxtaposition of sḫn nfr with špšy (and šꜢy) occurs in O. Hor 3, where the text (lines 3–4 recto) predicts a good fate and fortune (‘favourable for your fate, favourable for your fortune’: nfr=s pꜢy=k šꜢy nꜢ-nfr=s tꜢy=k špšy.t) for Ptolemy VI Philometor (ca. 180–145 BCE) in the coming year; eight lines later (12 recto), the text proclaims ‘every good event’ (sḫny-nfr nb) which Isis has caused for him: Ray, Archive of Ḥor, 21 (transcription), 25 (translation), Pls IV, IVa. (I thank M. Ross for trans-literation; Dousa, ‘Imagining Isis’, 178 n. 118 has a typo, ‘pꜢy=f ’.) Sḫn is paired with šy in P. Insinger (as a recurring refrain): ‘The fate (pꜢ-šy) and fortune [event?] (pꜢ-sḫny) that come, it is the god who sends them.’ (2, 20; 5, 11 et al.: see M. Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, vol. III, 187, 189, etc.) Thus a good fortune as represented by Shepset connects to chance (good) events. The good fortune that the fifth represents can supply the possi-bility or capacity, but not certainty, of children, wealth and other concerns of the fifth. In P. Berlin 8345, I, 1; III, 11, nꜢ sḫny.w has the sense of ‘the things that happen to be’ (Hughes translates as ‘the chances, the fortunes’, which he compares to τὰ ἀποτελέσματα, ‘the out-comes’—Hughes translates this wrongly as ‘influences’): G.

Sḫny’s semantic field in common with τυγχάνω (see Wb III, 469–70) also supports the interpretation here of ‘outcome’.)

Note that this place is always associated to a feminine deity, whether in Greek, Roman or Egyptian iteration.2.4 Shai and Egyptian ‘Fate’As we saw in Chapter Two, 2.2, the name of Shai in Demotic astrological texts is written with the snake and/or the god determinative, whether representing the eleventh place as a divine protector or ensuring a ‘happy fate’ for the holder of the chart.119 The meanings and development of the word that forms his name illuminate how fate was understood in Egypt. Shai derives from Uäá šꜢ[ı̓] ‘order’ ‘decree’ ‘determine’.120 The first meaning in the Wörterbuch is ‘bestimmen’, but ‘anordnen’ also appears, and the word has the sense of a decree that brings something into being, often through a god or king.121 Raymond Faulkner says ‘ordain, order; predestine; assign; settle, decide’.122 Fundamentally, then, šꜢı ̓ is ordaining or decreeing, with a sense of order, a de facto (or de fato?) regulation. These connotations are not that distant from the Latin fatum (derived from for, ‘speak’ or ‘say’, especially as a prophecy)123 with the sense of fate as decrees or utterances which have the force of law. ŠꜢı ̓ has this force of law as well: Quaegebeur tells us that ‘šꜢı ̓ est également un terme technique désignant l’établissement des lois . . .’.124Greek heimarmenē, literally ‘that which has been apportioned’, is not as obviously relatable (in that the idea of a spoken decree is not present in its etymology). But the idea of šꜢı ̓ having the force of law recalls the beginning of the Pseudo-Plutarch essay ‘On Fate’, where fate as actuality or activity (ἡ κατ’ ἐνέργειαν εἱμαρμένη) is described as a ‘law’ (nomos) and a ‘logos’, even, interpret-ing Plato’s Republic, as a ‘ “divine law determining the linking of future events to events past and present” ’ (568d).125ŠꜢı ̓ appears first in the Old Kingdom (it is attested in the Sixth Dynasty Maxims of Ptahhotep), and becomes established in the Middle Kingdom.126 ŠꜢı ̓ 119 Respectively O. Neugebauer, ‘Demotic Horoscopes’, 120–21, Os. 5; Hughes, ‘Astrologer’s Handbook’, 55, 57.120 A. Gardiner, Egyptian Grammar, 3rd ed.

The idea of a deity commanding by divine will (and the transfer of this power to a king) is also encompassed in šꜢı ̓; these commands can be actu-alised through speaking.127 The idea of creation through speech is not foreign to Egyptian culture. In the Memphite Theology, a well-known creation myth of the Late Period, the world is created through names being spoken.128 So a divine law with the sense of a decree made by the gods can be seen both in the (earlier) Egyptian and (later) Greek culture. Elke Blumenthal’s correlation of šꜢı ̓ with ḏd (speak or say) implies the decree as spoken, words which have the force of law, comparable to heimarmenē as a logos. Note that the tongue (rep-resenting logos) of Isis’s son, Harpokrates, often pictured with his finger to his mouth, is described by Plutarch as tuchē and daimōn.129In the New Kingdom, nominal forms, the substantives šꜢw and šꜢy, come into use. These are no longer just ‘commands’ or ‘decrees’, but contain more explicit ideas of fate or destiny, a life divinely decreed. This concept develops especially in the Eighteenth Dynasty during the Amarna period. Shai becomes allied to the solar disk, in the expression ‘the living Aten, lord of Shai’ (pꜢ ı ̓tn Ꜥnḫ nb šꜢy),130 and ‘determining life’ (šꜢı ̓ Ꜥnḫ) which is almost equivalent in mean-ing to the common dı ̓ Ꜥnḫ (giving life).131 With divine power transferred from god (i.e. the Aten) to him, Akhenaten is deemed a ‘Shai, giving life’ (šꜢy dı ̓dı ̓ Ꜥnḫ), i.e., capable of decreeing life.132 Other gods are also lords of fate.133 Life is decreed and ordered through shai; thus destiny is an antidote to uncertainty 127 Quaegebeur, Shaï, 44: ‘Elke Blumenthal fait remarque à juste titre que d’après les tex-tes du ME le verbe šꜢ(ı̓) est synonyme de wḏ et ḏd et indique la destinée commandée par la divinité, et l’expression de la volonté du roi, d’autre part.’ (citing E. Blumenthal, Untersuchungen zum ägyptischen Königtum des Mittleren Reiches, I. Die Phraseologie (Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1970), 91–94: B 5). As with Greek ἀκούω, the word for ‘hear’ in Egyptian also carries the meaning of ‘obey’ (sḏm [n]) (e.g., ‘I hear and obey’). Speech is implicit in command.128 Morenz, Egyptian Religion, 164: ‘It is “the mouth which pronounced the name of every-thing (r mꜢṯ rn n ı ̓ḫt nbt)” from which Shu and Tefnut came forth, followed by the world of nature and ordered human history, embodied in the Ennead.’129 Plutarch, De Iside et Osiride, 378c6 (Sieveking, 2.3): ‘γλῶσσα τύχη, γλῶσσα δαίμων.’ It is interesting that both τύχη and δαίμων are implicated with logos here. Griffiths, Plutarch’s de Iside et Osiride, 536, relates this to the ‘Opening of the Mouth’ funerary ritual.130 Quaegebeur, Shaï, 40.131 Ibid., 45–46.132 Ibid., 40.133 Miosi, ‘God, Fate and Free Will’, 71."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Twists of Fate 105and chaos. The decrees of the gods bring human life under control and make it secure, ordered and contained.134With the ability to decree life, šꜢı ̓ also becomes associated with the length of life. Both Morenz and Miosi, writing on the Egyptian concept of fate, empha-sise repeatedly Shai’s connection (or one of its forms) with length of life.135 ŠꜢy can determine life-span, but this could be negotiated with the gods. In other words, one’s fate is not immutably fixed. In the ‘Report of Wenamun’ (2, 55–60) the prince of Byblos asks the god Amun for fifty more years of life than was fated for him.136 The Hymn to Amun in P. Leiden I 350 (III 17–18) says that the god ‘makes a lifetime long or shortens it’; ‘he gives more than what is fated (šꜢyt) to him whom he loves.’137 In the Akhenaten texts, we find šꜢy written with the sun determinative (, N5) further emphasising its signification as lifespan;138 the sun is always associated with life because of its daily cycle of death and rebirth. The Demotic word, šw, has the same sun determinative and has been translated by Spiegelberg as ‘Vorschrift, Bestimmung’.139If the power of life belongs to šꜢı ̓, so too the power of death. The Egyptian concept of šꜢı ̓ also encompasses the idea of death as something ordained by the gods, and which is inescapable. Just as we say ‘he met his fate’, i.e. death, a šꜢw nfr, ‘good fate’, is a euphemism for death.140 Analogous to the English 134 Thausing, ‘Der ägyptische Schicksalsbegriff ’, 51–53, emphasises the importance of Ma’at, the Egyptian ordering principle (and goddess) of justice and rightness, to Old Kingdom Egyptian fate doctrine.135 Morenz, Egyptian Religion, 71–72, 185; S. Morenz and D. Müller, Untersuchungen zur Rolle des Schicksals in der ägyptischen Religion (Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1960), 19, 23, 29; Miosi, ‘God, Fate and Free Will’, 71–72, 93, 95. Miosi, as well, 83, 87–88, makes the distinction between a fate which determines merely the length of life, and a fate which determines the ‘manner’ of life. Certain circumstances may be given by the gods, but how one behaves in one’s life is not determined by them.136 See Simpson, Faulkner and Wente, Literature of Ancient Egypt, 153; also Lichtheim, Literature, Vol. II, 228 (passage quoted by Hoffmeier in Redford, ed., Ancient Gods, Ancient Gods, 122).137 Morenz, Egyptian Religion, 71 (following his translation); see also Quaegebeur, Shaï, 78.

Apuleius shows us Isis’s powers in Metamorphoses, XI, where she tells Lucius, ‘But if by assiduous obedience, worshipful service, and steadfast celibacy you win the favour of my divine acquiescence [numen], you will know that I—and I alone—can even prolong [prorogare] your life beyond the limits established by your fate.’143 Jewish astrology and tradition also connects length of life with fate.144Let us recap the connotations of šꜢı ̓ thus far. Its original meaning is that of commanding and decreeing, of ordaining, especially by gods and kings. These decrees have the force of law. By the New Kingdom, the idea of fate or destiny decreed at birth is established, and šꜢı ̓ is found in nominal forms with this meaning. ‘Fate’ decrees life, and is associated also with length of life, but this can be negotiated and changed, if the god is willing. In addition, ‘fate’ n. 4; Simpson, Faulkner and Wente, Literature of Ancient Egypt, 306, translate ‘destiny is good’).141 ‘The Instructions of Ptahhotep’, 33, in Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, Vol. I, 72, quoted by Hoffmeier in Redford, ed., Ancient Gods, 121. The Egyptian word for ‘taxes’, coin-cidentally, also derives from šꜢ: šꜢyt, dues, or fees which are imposed. See Wb, IV, 403, ‘Abgabe, Steuer’; Gardiner, Egyptian Grammar, 594; Faulkner, Dictionary, 261.142 ‘I change the garb of the moirai!’ See Morenz, Egyptian Religion, 74 and n. 93. See Chapter 6, 1.3, 202, n. 36 (continues on 203).143 Apuleius, Metamorphoses, XI, 6 (Helm, 271.5–8): ‘Quodsi sedulis obsequiis et religiosis min-isteriis et tenacibus castimoniis numen nostrum promerueris, scies ultra statuta fato tuo spatia vitam quoque tibi prorogare mihi tantum licere.’ Trans. (modified) of J. A. Hanson, in Apuleius, Metamorphoses, ed. and trans. J. Arthur Hanson, 2 vols. (Cambridge, MA/London: Harvard University Press, 1989), II, 303, 305. Morenz, Egyptian Religion, 74 and n. 96, mentions this passage. Interestingly, the Latin used here for ‘prolong life’, vitam prorogare, becomes the Renaissance astrological term (prorogator) for the Greek aphetēs. See the interesting analysis of Griffiths, The Isis-Book, 241–42, where he argues that when Isis syncretises with Tyche, a Fortune is created which is no longer blind and nefarious, but benevolent and prescient (he bases his argument partly on the Egyptian syncretism of Isis-Thermuthis). The same British Museum statue, ca. 590 BCE, (see above, 1.3, n. 58) where Sheshonq proclaims Isis the ruler of Shai and Renenet, also asks the goddess to prolong his existence: Perdu, ‘Un appel à Isis’, 233, line 6; 234, translation.144 See F.

These aspects of šꜢı ̓ are also linked to astrology, both in theory and practice.1452.5 Astrological Length of LifeThis relationship between lifespan and fate is significant for astrology, because determining length of life is an important astrological concern, and its prac-tice nearly always employs, among other criteria, both the Lot of Fortune and the eleventh place, and in some cases the Lot of Daimon. (See Chapter Nine, Section 7.) One wonders if the reason these particular elements are involved in the doctrine comes from the Agathos Daimon and his connection to Shai, to this ancient Egyptian association of šꜢı ̓ with lifespan. In addition, the sun-determinative as a life-signifier correlates to the astrological Sun’s importance in determining length of life. (Note that astrological sect, determined from whether the Sun is above or below the horizon, is an important criterion in all systems which determine lifespan.)For Paulus Alexandrinus (ch. 36), the planet chosen to be a ‘house-master’ (oikodespotēs), and thus gain power over the length of life, is discovered from planets ruling the Sun by day and the Moon by night. (In addition, the eleventh and fifth places are among those considered ‘operative’ (χρηματίζοντες) in find-ing this planet.)146Vettius Valens’ system (III, 1) determines an epikratētōr, from both the Sun and the Moon in operative places; this becomes a ‘releaser’ (aphetēs, in Firmicus dator vitae, later prorogator)147 from which the length of life can be determined. The usual candidates are the Sun, the Moon, the Lot of Fortune, the prenatal syzygy or the Ascendant (all these positions involve the luminar-ies and/or the horizon in some way, and all are important as a means of meas-uring time). The aphetēs is chosen based on its strength, which is measured by its sect alignment and its position in an operative place. If the first candidate is not in a suitable place, one considers the next best candidate, etc. Once the aphetēs is determined, its bound [a.k.a. term]-ruler becomes the ‘giver of years’. A strong bound-ruler, well-placed, gives a larger amount of years, while a weak one gives a lesser amount. Valens (III, 11) ascribes another technique for deter-mining length of life from the Lot of Fortune and its rulers (or, in some cases, the Lot of Daimon) to Nechepso (see discussion of this doctrine in Chapter Nine, 145 C. J. Bleeker, ‘Die Idee des Schicksals in der alt-ägyptischen Religion’, in The Sacred Bridge (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1963), 115, comes to a similar conclusion regarding Egyptian fate and astrology.146 See Chapter 7 for more on the oikodespotēs.147 See definition in Appendix 1.A, 3.1."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3108Section 7, ‘The Lots and Length of Life’). The attribution to Nechepso may underscore an Egyptian origin, at least for this practice.In an example in Dorotheus III, 2 the ruler of the Ascendant is the aphetēs, and falls in the eleventh place, the place of the Good Daimon. Dorotheus says this is a ‘good place’148 even though, because Mars is there, the outcome is bad (it would be even worse if the eleventh place were not involved).Ptolemy’s system for determining length of life (see Chapter Two, 2.6), is also based on places suitable for finding an authority for deciding lifespan. He differs from other authors in utilising specific amounts of degrees in the places, not just their signs, because of his quest to find physical causation. The most ‘lordly’ or authoritative positions for releasing are those of the Sun, the Moon, the Hour-marker and the Lot of Fortune.These examples illustrate the importance of the Sun and the use of both the eleventh and fifth places in these schemes, as well as the Lots of Fortune and Daimon. (Ptolemy employs only the daytime formula for the Lot of Fortune149 in length of life calculation, but this will be the de facto Lot of Daimon in any nocturnal nativity.) Thus the Good Daimon appears in two guises in this tech-nique: both by place and by lot.3 Mesopotamian and Egyptian ‘Fate’At this point it will be helpful to compare the Egyptian šꜢı ̓ with the Mesopotamian (Akkadian) šāmu, from which their ‘fate’ word, šımtu, derives.150 This verb’s semantic field has some similarities with šꜢı ̓, in that both have the sense of ‘decree’ or ‘determine’ (i.e., ‘fix’) as a primary meaning.151 Šımtu (the nominal form) also contains the idea of pre-ordaining or ordering, and is associated with the gods’ ability to ordain things both in the divine and human realms. This ordering, once established, becomes a cultural norm.152 (Note that 148 Dorotheus, III, 2.27 (Pingree, 243).149 Ptolemy, Tetr., III, 11.5. See Chapter 9, Section 6, 329–30 and n. 77. Other authors use both nocturnal and diurnal formulae for Fortune. For more on this issue, see Chapter 9, Section 7.150 F. Rochberg-Halton, ‘Fate and Divination in Mesopotamia’, AOF Beiheft 19, no. 28 (1982): 363–71, here 363.151 Ibid., 363 and n. 5.152 Ibid., 364."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Twists of Fate 109the Greek nomos, in addition to meaning ‘law’, has as its first meaning a ‘habit-ual practice’ or ‘custom’.)153 Also like šꜢı ̓, the decrees of šımtu have a legal force.154A kind of rank is associated with šımtu, i.e. those who give it always dispense something within their power to those who do not have it. These may be gods giving to humans, kings to their subjects, or private individuals to their heirs.155 Rank is also implicit in šꜢy, but it is rare for an ordinary human to bestow what is normally a divine prerogative.156 It is the gods and the king who are able to ‘determine’ events, the king being able to appropriate the divine attribution.157 The god or king orders, in order that something (an event) comes to be.Šımtu can also mean death, just as šꜢw in Egyptian. The Mesopotamian ‘he went to his fate’ and ‘fate took him away’158 are very similar to the Egyptian ‘His fate brought on his death’.159 Interestingly, šımtu is also the word for a last will and testament, which decrees the disposition of one’s estate at the end of life.160In addition šımtu, like šꜢy, can shift semantically, from an order or a com-mand, to the meaning of a ‘destiny’ which the gods decree to humans. Šımtu thereby becomes one’s personal ‘destiny’, a portion given by the gods (presum-ably at birth), a share which, as Leo Oppenheim says, ‘determines the entire direction and temper of [one’s] life. . . . Šımtu thus unites in one term the two dimensions of human existence: personality as an endowment and death as a 153 LSJ, s.v. nomos.154 For exposition of šımtu’s legal contexts, see D.

In fact, Oppenheim compares šımtu with both moira and phusis (šımtu as a natural endowment).163 As for Plato’s version, choice comes before life, at least, if not during it.In the Mesopotamian version, however, as in the Egyptian, one’s per-sonal ‘fate’ or ‘destiny’ is not fixed, but can be negotiated; the verdict may be appealed.164 Mesopotamian fate is not utterly determined.165 This appears to be the case also in later connotations of šꜢy (i.e., New Kingdom and after). We mentioned the appeal for more years of life in the ‘Report of Wenamun’. A famous example of altering one’s fate is in the Tale of the Doomed Prince, where the prince avoids his fate by the snake and, it appears, is well on his way to avoiding that of the crocodile when the story breaks off (scholarly consen-sus suggests a happy outcome).1663.1 Mesopotamian Good Daimons, Fortune and FateMesopotamia also has the equivalent of good daimons. Šımtu, unlike Shai, is never a god; it is only given by gods. But there are four Mesopotamian deities very like good daimons: they are protective spirits, described by Oppenheim as ‘external souls’.167 They have psychological components related to identity or 161 Oppenheim, Ancient Mesopotamia, 202.162 D-K I, 177, Fr.

To experience a lucky stroke, to escape a danger, to have an easy and complete success, is expressed in Akkadian by saying that such a person has a ‘spirit’, i.e., an ilu, ištaru, šēdu or lamassu.170 . . . . . . we may see in the ilu some kind of spiritual endowment which is difficult to define but may well allude to the divine element in man; in ištaru, his fate; in lamassu, his individual characteristics; and in šēdu, his élan vital.171‘Luck’ here is not the indeterminate ‘chance’ of the Greeks, but a kind of ser-endipitous good fortune given by the guardian spirit who has one’s welfare at heart. Lamassu has a protective function similar to that of a guardian daimon: ‘On the 16th of Simanu let him take the rope of a boat travelling upstream; his Lama, the one who keeps him safe, will keep guiding him.’172 Oppenheim theo-rises that ištaru carries the šımtu of the individual.173The goddess Ishtar has a role in holding the power of the king and acting as his divine protector174 which is called, respectively, tuchē and fortuna by the Greeks and Romans.175 Ishtar correlates both to Aphrodite and Venus (and the planet Venus); and Venus rejoices in the fifth place in astrology, called agathē tuchē.

Hellenistic astrology draws on these two cultures, Egyptian and Mesopotamian, in its development as a coherent system of divination and prediction. In addition to Manilius, the astrologers Thrasyllus, Dorotheus, Valens, Firmicus, Paulus, Hephaestio and Antigonus of Nicaea (cited on the decans by Hephaestio)178 all mention Egyptian sources in their treatises, not to mention the Egyptian astrologers Teucer of Babylon, Anubio, Chaeremon, Manetho and Rhetorius. The Greek names for the fifth and eleventh places of the chart can be correlated to Egyptian counterparts which connect with Egyptian ideas of destiny. The elev-enth place, and sometimes the fifth (as aphetic places), are capable of assign-ing the planet which controls length of life, and their names, Agathos Daimon and Agathe Tuche, have connections with moira.Morenz/Müller, Thausing, Miosi, Bergman, Quaegebeur and von Lieven have discussed non-deterministic aspects of Egyptian fate.179 Miosi has stated this well:An Egyptian’s future was not fixed and predestined. It was, instead, the result of a dynamic interaction between the individual—with his desires, 176 Oppenheim, Ancient Mesopotamia, 204. They may also compare to the Egyptian Shepset and Weryt.177 Ibid.178 At Hephaestio II, 18.74–75.

The divine was imminent and was always reacting to man, prin-cipally through the process of reward and punishment. When the future was revealed to a person through an oracle, he may simply have been finding out what god wanted him to do or what particular response or reaction god had in store for him . . . Divine revelation of some event in a totally static and predestined future is quite different from god’s reveal-ing to someone what his future responses will be within a dynamically interactive relationship.180Miosi has used oracles as his divinatory mode here, but we could equally well substitute astrology. Given the Mesopotamian and Egyptian roots of astrol-ogy (and we have more and more evidence of this every day, especially in the burgeoning Demotic material), and the established influence of Egyptian and Mesopotamian ideas in other disciplines,181 I suggest that non-deterministic ideas of destiny evident in Egyptian and Mesopotamian culture carried over into Hellenistic astrological ideas about fate.Although some Greek astrologers talk about astrological prognostication as discovering one’s already ordained fate, there are cracks in this armour of ‘hard’ determinism that suggest a negotiation with that fate is possible (we saw some cracks in Chapter 1).182 Katarchic astrology is the obvious form of this kind of negotiation,183 but it can also take place within natal astrology, both in awareness of the various outcomes possible in one astrological configuration184 180 Miosi, ‘God, Fate and Free Will’, 93–94.181 E.g., Fowden, The Egyptian Hermes; W. Burkert, The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1992, repr. 1995); M. L. West, Early Greek Philosophy and the Orient (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1971); E. Iversen, Egyptian and Hermetic Doctrine (Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 1984), among others.182 For the idea of a negotiable destiny in astrology, as in divination, see Cornelius, The Moment of Astrology, 131, 173. Cornelius also recognises the importance of the daimon, 177–81.183 Katarchic astrology, in fact, is purposely designed to negotiate fate; see Chapter 6, 1.1–1.4, 1.6 on katarchai in the PGM, and especially 1.3. N. Campion, The Dawn of Astrology: A Cultural History of Western Astrology, vol. 1. The Ancient and Classical Worlds (London: Continuum Books, 2008), 175, remarks that there are ‘two ways of relating to the cosmos; one in which fate is negotiated and the other in which it is accepted’ (see also 212).184 See D. G. Greenbaum, ‘Arrows, Aiming and Divination: Astrology as a Stochastic Art’, in Divination: Perspectives for a New Millennium, ed.

Their people’s fates could be negotiated; and I propose that, despite an appar-ent ‘hard’ determinism, Hellenistic astrologers could and did operate under assumptions that a fate could be changed, and that astrology could be an instrument in deciding how to go about changing it. This is not to deny that Greek concepts of fate still frequently hold sway in astrological texts, but to point out that the original reasons for reading the future from the heavens in astral omina, from which Hellenistic astrology was born, did not necessarily have to follow such philosophical precepts. What may be taking place within astrology is an uneasy truce or an accommodation, perhaps both simultane-ously, between two fundamentally different concepts of fate. This is why we see positions of what seem like hard determinism cheek by jowl with positions that allow choice and change within astrological practice (e.g. Valens’ different viewpoints discussed in Chapter One).That Egyptian gods and their treatment of human fate would appeal to Greeks and Romans is not new.188 The ubiquity of Isis-worship (who, among other things, can conquer fate) in the Greco-Roman world scarcely needs pointing out. A conception of fate as something given by gods who can be pro-pitiated, as a life which can be lengthened by divine dispensation and altered based on virtuous acts (or the opposite) and intentions, might hold an attrac-tion for those whose culture tells them that allotment is final and fate is fixed.Hellenistic astrology is, it appears, a de facto battleground over the issue of determinism. It becomes a whipping boy for fatalism; but with its emphasis on 185 See Chapter 9, 5.5, the example of the dancer, 324–27; and, e.g., the desires of Valens and Firmicus to improve themselves.186 Miosi, ‘God, Fate and Free Will,’ 97.187 Ibid.188 E.g., Morenz, Egyptian Religion, 74: ‘We shall hardly go wrong in assuming that this consol-ing power over fate was not the least reason for the Egyptian deities’ appeal to the Greeks and Romans.’"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Twists of Fate 115finding the best and strongest planets to represent the giving of years, it tries to find ways to extend life by divine planetary sanction (not completely unlike the pleading of the prince of Byblos for more years from Amun).

The vicious female demon Lamaštu attacked pregnant or labouring women and newborn babies.5 Pregnant women wore amulets featuring Pazuzu, another demon, who was able to ward off the attacks of Lamaštu; but Pazuzu was able to wreak his own havoc if he desired, since he ruled over the evil wind-demons.6A plaque of Lamaštu and Pazuzu, now in the Louvre,7 shows Pazuzu over-looking Lamaštu from the top of the plaque, while other demons (possibly ‘the Seven’, who may link to planets) appear on the second row to help him expel Lamaštu.8Other demons guarded the seven portals of the underworld; still others were ghosts unable to rest.

Henry Saggs says that demons were not necessarily inferior in power to the gods, and could even surpass their power at times.11 What seems to dif-ferentiate them from gods is their lack of a complete personality, along with an inability to create; but they do have the ability, unlike gods, to enter into bodies.12 Marcel Leibovici points out their connection with the world of the dead, and with breath and wind.13 More than one writer has mentioned the pervasiveness and quantity of demons and their activities in Mesopotamian culture, with a subsequent cottage industry in amulets and other apotropaic measures.14 Comparisons have been made between the relative stability of Egyptian religion and culture, and the insecurity and fear prevalent in Mesopotamian culture, as reasons for the proliferation and behaviour of evil spirits in the latter.15 In Egyptian culture, all divinities are designated nṯrw; in Mesopotamian culture, there is no special word for daimon, good or bad—what scholars call demons have a number of different names, such as rābiṣu, utukku and gallû.

Named from their functions, some of these were called fighters (ḫꜢty.w), emis-saries (hby.w), messengers (wpwty.w) and wanderers (šmꜢy.w).29 They worked in groups and had no individual names, thus distinguishing them from benev-olent daimonic deities like Shai and Renenet. They went armed with knives or arrows, carrying out the commands of their gods.30 Some of these link to decan stars (see Chapter Six, 3.1–3.2), which in turn become associated with the ten-day periods called decades. There is one decan for each decade, adding up to an ideal 360-day year, but decans for the five epagomenal days are added to make the roughly 365-day solar year.31 These last five days, outside of the ideal year, are particularly dangerous.32 Endings paradoxically bring change, and this instability applies as well to the end of the day, the end of a decade and the end of the month.33 This association of demons with danger and instability at the end of periods of time has particular relevance for Hellenistic astrology. The twelfth place, the last place in the chart, is the place of the bad daimon, and the last bounds (terms) are ruled by malefics (see 2.5 below).28 A.-S. von Bomhard, The Naos of the Decades: From the Observation of the Sky to Mythology and Astrology, trans.

The early spirits are not always called daimons, but go under names such as kēr, alastor or Erinys.34 Such spir-its appear in the plays of Aeschylus. Those denied a proper burial or killed vio-lently could wander the earth and prey on the living. Local daimons had their own shrines and sacrifices, as Porphyry explains in On Abstinence:Others [sc. daimons] have no name at all in most places, but acquire a name and cult inconspicuously from a few people in villages or in some cities. The remaining multitude is given the general name of daimones, and there is a conviction about all of them that they can do harm if they are angered by being neglected and not receiving the accustomed wor-ship, and on the other hand that they can do good to those who make them well-disposed by prayer and supplication and sacrifices and all that goes with them.35These popular daimons seem like a different species than those generally dis-cussed by philosophers. Plato, of course, emphasised the idea that daimons were between gods and humans, and popularised a personal daimon. His suc-cessor Xenocrates, who first articulated the concept of the three different kinds of triangles representing gods, daimons and humans,36 promoted the idea that 34 See Dodds, Greeks and the Irrational, 39–40; idem, The Ancient Concept of Progress and other Essays on Greek Literature and Belief (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1973), 55, where he says that δαίμων, ἀλάστωρ and ἐρινύς can be used interchangeably; and 56, where he explains that the evil spirit is drawn by a ‘flaw in our nature’.

[This is a love that] misleads and is misled. And so the daimons govern this whole earthly government through the instruments of our bodies; this govern-ment Hermes has called ‘fate’.38Plutarch reports Xenocrates’ claim that ill-omened days and festivals with cruel and violent components were not for gods, but for ‘certain great and powerful natures, obdurate, however, and morose, which take pleasure in such things’ and therefore are kept from doing worse.39 Well before Xenocrates, though, Empedocles claimed that daimons were punished by returning to inhabit bod-ies on earth, whether animals or humans.40A negative perception of daimons is attributed to Pythagoras: ‘Pythagoras [said], in regard to the first principles, that the monad was god and the good . . . but the unlimited dyad was daimon and the bad.’41 Also in the Placita we find: ‘Subsidiary to the discussion of gods, we must report and partly unequal, to the daimons (416d).

Thales, Pythagoras, Plato and the Stoics [all said that] daimons are actually beings of soul; heroes are souls separated from bod-ies, and they are good when the souls are good, but bad when the souls are inferior.’42 Sentiments like this developed from the idea that excessive emo-tion, from being too much influenced by a bad daimon, led to unhappiness (kakodaimonia). So Posidonius says:The cause of emotions, that is, of inconsistency and the unhappy [lit. ‘cacodaimonic’] life, is that humans do not follow their inborn daimon in all things, the daimon who is akin and of like nature to that which governs the whole cosmos; but at times they turn away and are carried off to the worse and bestial. In disregarding this they see in these things nei-ther the cause of emotions, nor do they think correctly about happiness [lit., ‘good daimon-ness’] and consistency. For they do not see that the pri-mary thing for achieving this is not to be led in any way by the unreason-able, ‘cacodaimonic’ and godless part of the soul.43Too much passion was bad both for humans and for daimons. Posidonius asserts a great power for the daimon; this can be a force for happiness and good, but it can also be used unwisely. Always with the daimon is that ele-ment of danger, the sense of being on the edge of something overpowering and terrifying. To step off that edge, whether into irrationality and madness, or enlightenment and ecstasy, is a dangerous move.The rise of Gnosticism, along with exposure to the bad daimons of other Mediterranean and Near Eastern cultures, increased the profile of bad dai-mons in Hellenistic circles (see Chapter Five). Earthly (‘hylic’) daimons were purely bad, and were seen as opponents to good angels.

Neo-Platonists also take up the idea of demonic possession, which until this time had been more or less unheard of in the Hellenistic environment.47 Evil is no longer a privation of good, but an actual malevolent force personified by evil daimons.48 The idea of demonic possession in general, though, owes much to Jewish and Christian conceptions. The early-fifth century Bishop of Ptolemais, Synesius, writes of demonic assaults on the soul:But when matter moves her own offspring into the battle for the soul, the counter-attack then becomes diminished because the gods are far away; for each is strong in its own domains.

Unlike the hylic daimons, the good ones become medi-ators between gods and men.51 The bad daimons, the ‘daemon-dogs’,52 who are put in the service of magicians, are associated with souls who, because of the circumstances of their human’s death (untimely, or violent), are unable to go to Hades and are trapped on the earth above.53 These souls have no rest, can-not get into the underworld, and therefore are ripe for mischief.Astrology provides some evidence of a connection between those who die an untimely or, especially, a violent death, and the bad, earthly daimons who wander the earth causing pain and hardship.54 Violent death is a frequent topic, often linked with the twelfth ‘Bad Daimon’ place. Among numerous examples is: ‘. . . if you find both the Sun and the Moon in the sixth or the eighth or the twelfth and the malefics aspect [them], then they indicate death when their degrees conjoin with the malefics’.55 The Liber Hermetis devotes a whole 49 Synesius, Aegyptius, sive De Providentia, I, 10, 99d–100a (Terzaghi, vol.

It is unclear whether this refers to lots or to the places, because sect seems to be a consideration. The opposite, ‘if Saturn is in the place of the Daemon, but Mars in the place of Fortune, they make a more human figure’ (Feraboli, 239.91–93): ‘Si vero Saturnus <fuerit> in loco daemonis, Mars vero in loco [partis] fortunae, humaniorem figuram faciunt’) suggests that Saturn is above the horizon (i.e., diurnally placed) and Mars below the horizon; both agreeing with their sect and making a better outcome. It is also unclear whether, if the reference is to places, the 5th/11th or 6th/12th is meant.57 Rhetorius, CCAG VIII/4, 127.17–19: ἐὰν δὲ οἱ κύριοι τῶν συνόδων ἢ πανσελήνων εὑρεθῶσιν ἐν τούτῳ τῷ τόπῳ, κακὸν τὸ σχῆμα πρόλεγε· ἐκπτώτους γὰρ ποιεῖ ἢ βιοθανάτους.58 Dodds, Greeks and the Irrational, 65–68 and notes, 83–84.59 Again, the use of the word ‘demon’ in this section is a convenience for a concept not necessarily equivalent to our connotation of demon.

Blenkinsopp, Isaiah 56–66: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary, vol. 19B (New York/London: Doubleday, 2003), 274 (modified). The Book of Isaiah was apparently written in three parts: chapters 1–39 are agreed to be by one author, i.e. ‘Isaiah’. Chapters 40–55 and 56–66 were composed by ‘Deutero-’ and ‘Trito-’ Isaiah (see Blenkinsopp, Is 56–66, Introduction, esp. 38–40, 55–60). The Book of Isaiah spans a large historical frame-work. The later chapters, i.e. 40–66, are generally presumed to be post-Exilic; and the work as a whole may have been assembled in the post-Exilic period, probably the fifth century BCE (P. D. Miscall, Isaiah (Sheffield: JSOT Press [Sheffield Academic Press], 1993), 10–11) or even later, in the Hellenistic period (Blenkinsopp, Is 56–66, 35). Such dating is compatible with a reference to the cults of Tyche and Daimon, which were coming to prominence at that time. See commentaries on this verse in DDD, 340, col. 2 (s.v. ‘Gad’); 567, col. 1 (s.v. ‘Meni’); and Blenkinsopp, Is 56–66, 278–79.75 Since the original publication of my Ph.D. thesis in 2009, Joachim Schaper independently came to the same conclusion: J.

[Meni] is to be interpreted as a god (or spirit) of fate . . .’ but apparently is not aware of the cult of Agathos Daimon prevalent at the time."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4130gives the outcome of this blasphemous behaviour, using a pun: they will be ‘destined to the sword’.)79 Plainly the Hebrew writer knew of the connection of Daimon to destiny and toasting with wine, and even that Fortune and Daimon’s cults were often linked. But the Septuagint reverses Fortune and Daimon, call-ing Gad ‘Daimon’ and Meni ‘Tyche’: . . . καὶ ἑτοιμάζοντες τῷ δαίμονι τράπεζαν καὶ πληροῦντες τῇ τύχῃ κέρασμα.80 There is bilingual evidence (Palmyrene Aramaic-Greek) equating Gad with Tyche,81 as well as iconographic evidence (see e.g., the Gad Tadmor [Gad of Palmyra] relief from Dura-Europos).82 The Septuagint translation appears to be the impetus for connecting Gad with daimon, and subsequent attributions along those lines. This is another example of the con-fusion of Tyche and Daimon.Psalm 91:6 (LXX 90:6) mentions the ‘קטב qeteb (destruction) that ravages at noonday’; Qeteb is a ‘noonday demon’,83 but like šēdîm, etc., translated in Greek and Latin as δαιμόνιον/daemonium. (In Rabbinical literature Qeteb is ‘poisonous . . . covered with scales and with hair’ who operates during the mid-dle part of the day in midsummer.)84 These kinds of Jewish demons become mainly identified with sickness, plague, destruction and death. They can also 79 The pun is in the repetition of the letters ‘mn’ as in mni, destiny and the verb mnh, ‘assign’, ‘apportion’; see Blenkinsopp, Is 56–66, 279; DDD, 567, col. 1.80 I disagree with Sperling’s translation of the Hebrew in the DDD, 567, col. 1 (s.v. Meni), rendering Gad as ‘luck’ and Meni as ‘Fortune’ (in fact, luck is an attribute of Fortune, not Daimon), thus seeming to legitimise the equation of Gad with Daimon, not Tyche, based on the Septuagint translation. But E. Ben Yehuda, Thesaurus totius hebraitatis et vet-eris et recentioris ( Jerusalem/Berlin-Schöneberg: Langenscheidt, 1959), vol. 6, 3096, calls Meni ‘the divinity of fortune (מַ זּ ָ ל) and fate (גּ ֽ ז ֵ רָ ה)’, seemingly conflating the two terms. A. Even-Shoshan, Ha-milon ha-ḥadaš, 8 vols. ( Jerusalem: Kiryat-sefer, 1974), vol. 4, 1395, gives the origin of Meni as ‘perhaps from מָ נ ָ ה (fraction), i.e., חֵ לֶ ק (fraction, lot, destiny)’—not unlike the Greek etymology of δαίμων from δαίομαι.

Demonic possession is rare in other Mediterranean cultures: demons attack, and can be removed, but they do not necessarily possess in the sense meant in the Jewish and Christian traditions.85Different origins are supposed for demons. They can be the unjustly-treated vengeful dead, or ghosts of the wicked dead.86 But another idea also takes root: that demons are the offspring of evil angels who mated with human women.87 This idea engenders a link between Jewish demons and astrology in the Book(s) of Enoch, a collection of treatises whose earliest books are the Astronomical Book and the Book of the Watchers.88 The Book of the Watchers contains the story that angels of the highest order came to earth and produced offspring with the ‘daughters of earth’ (1 En. 6.2). From these Nephilim (giants) came a race of demons to plague humanity.89 In addition, the angels gave humans knowledge of divination, including ‘the auguries of the stars . . . sun . . . moon’ 85 For more on possession in the ancient Near East, see E. Sorensen, Possession and Exorcism in the New Testament and Early Christianity (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2002). He discusses the difference between ‘indwelling’ and ‘exterior’ possession (31–32, 77). Only one exam-ple in the Udug-hul rituals refers to a demon as being within a person’s body (32, citing Geller, Udug-hul VII.669–674). Even the namburbû rituals, which are called exorcistic ( J. Bottéro, Mesopotamia: Writing, Reasoning and the Gods, trans. Zainab Bahrani and Marc Van De Mieroop (Chicago/London: University of Chicago Press, 1992), 142) and which use substitution to transfer the demon’s attack to another object, do not have the force or moralistic slant of Jewish (and Christian) exorcism. Sorensen also examines the influence of Zoroastrianism and its concepts of good and evil on early Judaism (45 and n. 111, 118). He makes the point that ‘exorcism appears to presuppose a belief in evil as a self-willed entity’ (223). In Egypt, the first case of apparent demonic possession (the Bentresh Stela) is probably either of the Persian or Ptolemaic period (and thus may be influenced by Persian elements) (see Lichtheim, Literature, Vol. III, 90–94; G. Pinch, Magic in Ancient Egypt (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1995), 45).

A number of Christian authors (of whom Justin is prominent) take up these texts to emphasise several points: the role of fallen angels in creating demons; their transmission of illicit knowledge, espe-cially astrology, magic and other forms of divination; and that the pagan gods are demons.93 These will be important arguments in the demonisation of the daimon by the Christians.Some pseudepigraphic texts of Solomon deal with astrology and daimons: the Testament of Solomon and the Hygromanteia of Solomon. In the Testament (written in Greek, probably in the early centuries CE)94 the daimons are all evil, though they are forced to do good work building the Temple.

Although he requests a ‘demon’, these seven are not called daimones but rather ‘spir-its’ (πνεύματα), reflecting the Hebrew רוח, ruaḥ.96 That there are seven implies they are planets, and they call themselves ‘stars in heaven’ and ‘named like gods’97 (though McCown suggests not planets but the Pleiades).98 The spir-its are called stoicheia (‘we are elements, world-lords of darkness’),99 a word first used for ‘element’ (i.e. fire, earth, air and water) in Plato (Timaeus 48b), and further developed by Aristotle (De generatione et corruptione, II, 2–8). This connection with the material elements would mitigate any divine sta-tus. ‘World-lords’ (κοσμοκράτορες) is also an astrological term, referring both to the luminaries as overall planetary rulers and to the planets themselves.100 Thus the ‘spirits’ are material (like daimons), tied to the material world, and 95 See Chapter 6, 3.3, 222.

Perhaps, as von Stuckrad, we should not try to pin down exactly what kind of astral entities they are.105The Hygromanteia of Solomon deals with both demons and astrology.

In the Testament, they are only evil forces and, furthermore, subject to Solomon’s control. In the Hygromanteia, planets are invoked for both good and ill as masters of the days and the hours, and the diviner must use their astrological powers. Each planetary hour has been assigned both an angel and a demon, and good deeds or bad are sought accordingly. The list of angels and demons precedes prayers to God and to the planet (treated almost as a god), using characteristics associated with that planet. As Torijano indicates, these prayers seem adaptations of pagan ones with a monotheistic gloss at the beginning.110 He also mentions the obvious similarities in style with Hermetic texts.111 The prayers are not unlike those to the planets in the Picatrix.112 Finally, the metals, stones and plants of each planet are given, again mostly standard astrological designations.113 The Hygromanteia of Solomon is pagan at heart in its presentation, and shows its dependence on pagan astrological sources. It must have been a way for Jewish magicians and astrologers to adapt the time-honoured tradition of astrological magic to an acceptable Jewish framework.1.5 Christian DemonsChristian demonology in general continued the tenets of later Jewish demon-ology: that demons were purely evil, caused men to become evil and to sin, 110 Torijano, Solomon the Esoteric King, 168.

Demons were not just physically or mentally bad, they were morally evil and could not be rehabilitated or propitiated, only destroyed or banished. There was no compromise with any view, such as that of Hellenised pagans, that daimons could be benefic. Although the Jews began the concept of angels as messengers of God who were mostly good (bad angels were the ‘fallen’ ones of, e.g., the Book of the Watchers), and set up hierarchies of angels, the Christians developed these to a high degree, and emphasised their opposi-tion to what seemed to be leagues of demons.As in the Septuagint, daimonion is the preferred word for evil daimon in the New Testament.115 The word δαίμων appears only three times, in Matthew 8:31, Mark 5:12 and Luke 8:29.116 Of the fifty-five times that daimonion appears in the NT, forty-six are references to demonic possession or exorcism,117 show-ing the importance of this concept to the Christians. Jesus is seen as the master of exorcisms; one could even say that a valuable facet of his appeal is his ability to cast out demons. Thus both Jesus and the demons acquire an importance as adversaries of each other.118Equally important was the heightening of the battle between good and evil. Demonic possession developed into a moral evil (in contrast to the Mesopotamian version of an attack by a demon of neutral moral force), and exorcism from a ritual of substitution and appeasement of the divine (in Mesopotamia) to an absolute renunciation of morally evil demonic power. Jesus is not just expelling demons, he is claiming souls for God against Satan. Samson Eitrem expresses it well: ‘Jesus’ bifurcation of the whole world-order—and its eschatalogic counterpart—into Heaven and Hell, into angels and demons, his radical “Ye s” and “No” . . . came out spontaneously in a 114 For studies of demons and demonology in the New Testament, see the bibliography in Sorensen, Possession and Exorcism, 120, n. 5.115 DDD, 239, col. 1. The one use where this is not so, Acts 17:18, is an indirect quotation of Greek philosophers who call Paul’s religion ‘of foreign daimonia’; as a Greek characterisa-tion it does not represent the Christian position of daimons as evil.116 Ibid., 239, col. 1, claims it appears only once, in Matthew, but I found the other two references.117 The references to possession occur in the gospels, not the other books of the NT. I am not including the numerous references to evil ‘spirits’ (pneumata) or verbs like ‘be demon-ised’, i.e., possessed, but these would equally apply to demons. See a full list of references to possession by and exorcism of demons/spirits/the devil, etc. in Sorensen, Possession and Exorcism, 121–22 and nn. 7–19.118 For more on the prominence of both exorcist and demon, see ibid., 125 and n. 52."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4138monotheistic victory over the demons and their would-be autocratic prince.’119 This extreme and increasingly strident dualism sets the course for later Christian writings on demons, and has an impact on the way astrology was viewed in them.120The association of demons with illness is honed to a high gloss in the New Testament. The possessed are afflicted with both physical and mental ailments, including emotional outbursts, neurotic behaviour and the outright madness we would call psychosis today.121 But the violent death associated with earlier Jewish demons (also seen in Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Greek cultures) is absent in the New Testament. People are possessed by demons, but they do not die, just suffer miserably. And, of course, no exorcism by Jesus ever fails or ends with the death of the victim.Jesus’s exorcistic practices did not go unremarked by pagan magic prac-titioners. His name shows up in several Greek Magical Papyri as effective in banishing or summoning daimons.122 He thus gained fame as a magician in the pagan world. The practitioners using the Greek Magical Papyri were not so much interested in exorcism as a tool for healing the sick as they were in finding a technique that worked for controlling daimons, and Jesus’s success in this made invoking his name a valuable tool.123 Eitrem makes a case study of PGM IV.3007–3086 as an example of the use of Jesus’s name in a major spell.124 Interestingly, the word used for demons in this spell is ‘daimonion’, not ‘daimon’.125The Egyptian alchemist Zosimus of Panopolis (fl. ca. 300 CE) was also influ-enced by the Jewish and Christian view of daimons as evil. It is not clear whether 119 S. Eitrem, ‘Some Notes on the Demonology in the New Testament’, Symbolae Osloenses Fasc. Supplet.

Eitrem, ‘Notes on Demonology’, 28–29, points out, in addition to the casting out of demons from the sick, Jesus’s power to cure disease without demonic presence; sometimes there is a mixture of the two.

He warns his fellow alchemical practitioner, Theosebeia, against them, saying that ‘the local demons flatter you, hungering not only for burnt-offerings, but also for your soul’.129 In the Final Receipt, Zosimus uses the preferred Biblical word for demon, δαιμόνιον,130 showing that he had absorbed this locution either from Biblical texts or from the common connotation of his culture. In any case, he mentions no good dai-mons.131 On the other hand, he is very willing to use astrological techniques, such as katarchē, in order to achieve his alchemical objectives, as long as he can separate them from the actions of demons.132 His repulsion of demons, based on his acceptance of texts like the Book of Enoch, forces him to find ways to accomodate his astrological alchemy to his beliefs about demons.126 See B.

Fraser, ‘Alchemy as Forbidden Knowledge’, 137–44, points out the inherent conflicts Zosimus must try to rec-oncile, between the historical and strong links of astrology to alchemy, and the demonic perversions of the art, but he does not consider an astrological katarchē occuring in alchemy without the aid of demons."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 41402 The Places of Bad Daimon and Bad Fortune in AstrologyThe above overview of bad daimons in different Mediterranean cultures has shown the various ways demons acted and were dealt with. In addition, we have seen the connotative change of the word daimonion from neutral to almost entirely pejorative. By detailing the association of demons with illness, violence and possession, we now have some context for the way that astrology treats demons via the sixth and twelfth places.Naturally there is no hint in astrological writings that the practice of astrol-ogy is demonic. There are references to fate, even to daimons’ involvement in fate, but the daimons so involved are not evil or malicious. The bad daimon’s place in astrology revolves around what bad daimons are presumed to cause, e.g. illness, injury, violence and demonic possession.133 Its literal place is the twelfth, the Bad Daimon place, and its counterpart, the place of Bad Fortune (the sixth).2.1 The Twelfth and Sixth PlacesWithin the layout of the chart itself, the twelfth and sixth places are two of the four places called apoklimata (‘declines’), i.e. falling from the angles. They are generally associated with the more unpleasant aspects of life, though there are ‘good declines’, the third and ninth, the places of the Sun God and Moon Goddess.The sixth, Bad Fortune, and the twelfth, Bad Daimon, have no such posi-tive associations, and mostly represent unpleasant things like slavery, enemies, sickness and injury. The tradition of pairing Fortune and Daimon continues here, again via their opposition. Their meanings are sometimes identical: as Valens says, ‘Each place, then, will bring about its own particular outcomes according to what it means, but the nature of the opposite place will also cooperate.’134For Manilius, the twelfth is ‘too much abounding in vice’.135 Thrasyllus, quoting Hermes, calls the sixth ‘daimonic [fortune] . . . indicative of penalty 133 Causes of demonic possession would be a concern of clients in this time period: see, e.g. Ptolemy, Tetr. III, 15.3, 5, 6; Hephaestio, II, 16.3, 5–6; Valens, I, 1.14; Dorotheus, V, 37.1–8. See other astrological references to bad daimons in F. Cumont, L’Égypte des astrologues (Brussels: La Fondation Égyptologique Reine Élisabeth, 1937), 167–70.134 IV, 12.2 (Pingree, 170.18–19): Ἕκαστος μὲν οὖν τόπος καθ’ ὃ σημαίνει ἰδίως ἀποτελέσει, συνεργήσει δὲ καὶ ἡ τοῦ διαμετροῦντος τόπου φύσις.135 Astronomica 2.866: ‘. . . vitio fecunda nimis . . .’."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Hie Thee to Hell: The Place of the Bad Daimon 141and injury . . . ’.136 The feminine adjective is also found in P. Mich.inv. 1, 149, col. ix.16 (δαιμονιη) (These are the only such references to the sixth.) Both texts have Egyptian connections (that they both appear to use an adjective here may indicate a common source). The Demotic name for the sixth is tny.t ḫne, ‘lot of abomination’137 and Ꜥ.wy wry, ‘house of bad fortune’.138 Wry.t and Špšy.t (used of the fifth place: see Chapter Two, 2.2) are paired deities of bad and good fortune.139 Perhaps the Egyptian feminine ‘daimonic’ deity of bad fortune has influenced the Greek descriptions.136 CCAG VIII/3, 101.23–25: τὸ μέντοι ϛʹ δαίμ<ονι>αν καὶ ποινῆς καὶ σίνους δηλωτικόν· . . . . I follow Hübner’s suggestion (Dodekatropos, 54, citing Housman), re-emending δαίμ<ονι>αν (cod.) for Cumont’s <κακο>δαιμονίας. The parallel construction with the fifth place (τὸ δὲ εʹ ἀγαθὴν ἐκάλει τύχην·, CCAG VIII/3, 101.22–23) suggests δαίμ<ονι>αν is a femi-nine adjective modifying an implied τύχην.137 CDD, vol.

Hughes, ‘Astrologer’s Handbook’, 56–57, 62, translates the house name as ‘Evil Genius’, but he does not consider the distinction between fortune and ‘genius’. See his ‘Demotic Plea’, 179, where he even discusses the feminine pair of good and bad fortune deities, Špst and Wryt, but still calls them ‘Genius’.139 See above note.FIGURE 4.2 Cadent places."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4142Malefics ‘rejoice’ in these places, Saturn in the twelfth and Mars in the sixth.140 The sixth, says Firmicus, is called Bad Fortune precisely because it is Mars’s place (II, 19.7). The day planet, Saturn, rejoices above the horizon in the twelfth, while the night planet, Mars, rejoices below the horizon in the sixth.There are correlations here with philosophical bad daimons as described by Porphyry:But the souls which do not control the pneuma adjacent to them, but are mostly controlled by it, are for that very reason too much carried away, when the angers and appetites of the pneuma lead to impulse. These souls are also daimons, but may reasonably be called evil-working. . . . Their character is wholly violent and deceptive and lacking the supervision of the better daimonic power. . . .141Like bad daimons, malefics are considered so because of their urge toward excess (Porphyry’s ‘too much carried away’). Being excessively affected by the passions leads to things like violence and debauchery signified by planets, especially malefics, falling in the twelfth or associated with the twelfth.The twelfth and the sixth also, conveniently, provide geometrical reasons for being bad: they are apostrophos and asundetos, averse and unconnected, mak-ing no aspect to the Ascendant, a condition worse than being square or opposed, because no aspect means no possibility of relationship to the Ascendant, the representative of life itself. This may be one reason why the twelfth, in particular, represents childbirth, with all its attendant dangers and lack of controllability.142 When some sort of relationship exists, for which Ptolemy even uses the Stoic word oikeiosis,143 there is an ability to work together based on kinship, familiarity or association. Without an aspectual relationship to the Ascendant, planets in the twelfth or sixth can act unrestrainedly, causing vio-lent death, injury, perversions and mental illness.140 See Paulus, ch. 24; Olympiodorus, ch. 23; Firmicus, II, 19.7, 13; Valens, II, 11.

They are in the liminal space beloved by the Greeks as a place where prophetic dreams and divine contact can occur.145 But these states can be not only enrapturing but terrifying. The third and ninth places represent the (mostly) positive side of this numinosity, while the sixth and twelfth are its dark underbelly, in which the fears and terrors of psychi-cal life are given physical reality in slavery, enemies, hunger, exile, sickness, injuries and childbirth. This is why Dorotheus calls these places ‘the worst of the worst’.146144 CCAG VIII/4, 126.16–17: Ὁ δωδέκατος τόπος καλεῖται κακοδαιμόνημα καὶ προαναφορὰ τοῦ ὡροσκόπου καὶ μετακόσμιος. ‘The Twelfth Place is called “Evil Daimon”, and pre-ascension of the Hour-marker and between worlds.’ (Sim. for other cadent places at CCAG VIII/4, 144.17, 154.19, 163.20.) Cumont’s note 1, p. 163 says ‘The places of the Moon and Sun are called μετακόσμιοι because these stars receive the souls exiting from this world.’145 See D. G. Greenbaum, ‘Rising to the Occasion: Appearance, Emergence, Light and Divi-nation in Hellenistic Astrology’, in The Imaginal Cosmos: Astrology, Divination and the Sacred, ed. Angela Voss and Jean Hinson Lall (Canterbury, Kent: University of Kent, School of European Culture and Languages, 2007), 9–24, esp. 21.146 I, 5.5 (Pingree, 164): ‘There remain equal to this two places which are the worst of the worst, and they are the sixth and the twelfth.’ Cf. Hephaestio, I, 12.1 (Pingree, 39.13–14): οἵ τε λοιποὶ δύο ὅ τε ἕκτος καὶ <ὁ> δωδέκατος κάκιστοι.

The negative events they represent often lead to despair and the inabil-ity, because of that hopelessness, to see any way out from those unfortunate states.1472.2 Planets in the Sixth and TwelfthThe effects of the twelfth and sixth places are judged by planets (or other points) in them or ruling them, and the sign rulers of the places. Most delinea-tions involving the sixth or twelfth are unrelievedly negative.148 But sometimes sect can mitigate the circumstances (as in the case of the Good Daimon and Fortune places). Rhetorius says: ‘When Ares happens to be in the Bad Daimon zodiac signs <in the twelfth>,149 he becomes responsible for illness and inju-ries, but also in dangers and not a few plots of slaves or the condemned and imprisoned, especially by day; by night the evil will be moderated.’150 (Other delineations from Rhetorius give unfortunate outcomes no matter what the planet or its sect is.) Olympiodorus, though, makes clear that planets in sect can provide good outcomes:If Ares is found in this place [the sixth] according to sect, trined by benefic stars or even with Aphrodite in a feminine sign, it leads to mili-tary glory and advancement. But [even] if it is not figured by a benefic star, it will not thus bring on great evils, if it is not contrary to sect. In the same way nor will Kronos when according to sect, since the bad rejoice in bad places.151147 This is another contrast between adjacent places in the ‘hope’ assigned to the eleventh place and conditions leading to hopelessness in the twelfth.148 See e.g. Dorotheus IV, 1; Valens, II, 5 and 11; Paulus, 24, Manetho, VI, Rhetorius 57.149 Added in Pingree’s critical edition, in preparation by Stephan Heilen: Rhetorius, Compendium.150 CCAG VIII/4, 130.5–8: Ἐν δὲ τοῖς κακοδαιμονοῦσι ζῳδίοις ὁ Ἄρης <ἐν τῷ δωδεκάτῳ> παθῶν καὶ σινῶν παραίτιος γίνεται. γίνονται δὲ καὶ ἐν κινδύνοις καὶ ἐπιβουλαῖς οὐκ ὀλίγαις ἕνεκα δουλικῶν ἢ κατακρίτων καὶ συνεχομένων προσώπων, μάλιστα δὲ ἡμέρας. νυκτὸς δὲ μετριώτερα τὰ κακὰ γίνονται.151 Ch. 23 (Boer, 67.14–21): Εἰ δὲ ὁ Ἄρης εὑρεθῇ ἐν τούτῳ τῷ τόπῳ κατὰ αἵρεσιν τριγωνιζόμενος ὑπὸ ἀγαθοποιῶν ἀστέρων ἢ καὶ σὺν τῇ Ἀφροδίτῃ ὢν ἐνταῦθα ἐν θηλυκῷ ζῳδίῳ, ἐπὶ στρατιωτικὴν δόξαν καὶ προκοπὴν ἄγει. εἰ δὲ μὴ σχηματίζεται ὑπὸ ἀγαθοποιοῦ ἀστέρος, οὐδὲ οὕτως μεγάλα κακὰ ἐπάξει, ἐὰν μὴ ᾖ παρ’ αἵρεσιν· ὡσαύτως δὲ οὐδὲ ὁ Κρόνος κατὰ αἵρεσιν ἐκεῖσε ὑπάρχων, ἐπειδὴ χαίρουσιν οἱ κακοὶ ἐν τοῖς κακοῖς τόποις."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Hie Thee to Hell: The Place of the Bad Daimon 147Firmicus takes sect especially seriously; it qualifies a number of his delinea-tions in Book III. For instance:Mercury and Saturn set by degree in the 6th and the 12th place from the Hour-marker decree the same things by similar reasoning. For if they are found in these places by day, they will produce people who know about many areas of knowledge, who are competent in the knowledge of occult arts, and who wish to know all things which have to do with human affairs; who are very malicious and envious, and who are intimately con-nected with vices or infirmities. By night, Saturn and Mercury set in the 6th and 12th place of the nativity produce forgers, malicious scoundrels, malevolent poisoners, but who are always intimately connected with the greatest evils and the greatest compulsions.152Since Saturn is a day planet and the twelfth is above the horizon, it confers bet-ter things in a day chart. But Saturn below the horizon at night is truly malevo-lent and produces no good at all.153For Ptolemy, the Bad Daimon place ‘afflicts the effluence flowing onto the earth from the stars in it, while also declining, and it also muddies just as the thick and misty vapour from the moisture of the earth obscures, by which the stars do not appear naturally in either their right colours or magnitudes.’154Generally, then, anything to do with the sixth or twelfth places is tainted by their malignity. So when luminaries are there, they produce low-born, slave or 152 III, 9.6 (KSZ, I, 169.6–17 = Monat, II, 99): In sexto [loco] et in XII ab horoscopo loco par-tiliter constituti Mercurius et Saturnus eadem simili ratione decernunt. Si enim per diem in his locis fuerint inventi, multarum doctrinarum scios facient, absconsarum artium doc-trina pollentes, et qui omnia, quae in rebus humanis sunt, velint scire, malitiosos sane et invidos et qui vitiis aut valitudinibus inplicentur. Per noctem vero in VI et in XII geniturae loco Saturnus et Mercurius constituti falsarum litterarum auctores, sceleratos malitiosos malivolos veneficos facient, sed qui semper maximis malis et maximis necessitatibus implicentur.153 Firmicus is careful with his word order here: the day chart has ‘Mercury and Saturn . . . in the 6th and 12th’, implying Mercury in the 6th and Saturn in the 12th. Saturn is above the horizon in a day chart, and is a diurnal planet. At night, Saturn is in the 6th and Mercury in the 12th, so the diurnal planet is below the horizon in a night chart, making it doubly bad.154 Tetr. III, 11.4 (Hübner, 205.580–584): . . . κακοῖ τὴν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἀπόρροιαν τῶν ἐν αὐτῷ ἀστέρων μετὰ τοῦ καὶ ἀποκεκλικέναι, θολοῖ καὶ ὥσπερ ἀφανίζει τὸ ἀναθυμιώμενον ἐκ τῶν τῆς γῆς ὑγρῶν παχὺ καὶ ἀχλυῶδες, παρ’ ὃ καὶ τοῖς χρώμασι καὶ τοῖς μεγέθεσιν οὐ κατὰ φύσιν ἔχοντες φαίνονται."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4148outcast fathers or mothers (the Sun and Moon represent, respectively, father and mother). Thus the Sun in the twelfth ‘produces those unable to bear chil-dren, slaves or captives; some also are tried by injuries or illnesses.’155 Benefics there cannot mitigate the sixth’s and twelfth’s unfortunate effects either, as Rhetorius writes:When Aphrodite happens to be in the Bad Daimon zodiac sign by night, <she makes> those distressed through the allegations of women. If she is balefully aspected by Kronos and Hermes or <Ares>, <she makes> also those involved in soul-sicknesses—that is, amorous ones. But some are joined to female slaves or courtesans, and because of that they become childless.156 By day when she is in this place, she signifies those who die badly and violently on account of women [and how they die is] accord-ing to the particular nature of the zodiac signs. . . .157The bad effects are tailored to Aphrodite’s particular significations. Like the eleventh place, which can blunt the negativity of malefics by its goodness, the power of the twelfth is such that its badness can blunt the goodness of benefics.As might be expected, the twelfth and sixth can also show mental illness, epilepsy and even possession. However, they are not the prime candidates for these maladies; more often the Sun or Moon, or the Lots of Fortune or Daimon (which are formed using the positions of the Sun and Moon), in combination with malefics, produce these conditions. Perhaps this is because Sun and Moon are representatives of body, soul and spirit. Thus Antiochus says:. . . and likewise for the nocturnal hours, if the lord of the hours of the one managing should be in the [place] of the Bad Daimon, it makes those devoured by wild beasts. But if Kronos should manage when the Moon is opposing, it makes epileptics and those possessed by gods.158155 Rhetorius, CCAG VIII/4, 130.11–13: . . . ἀγενεστέρους τοὺς γονεῖς ἢ δούλους ἢ αἰχμαλώτους ποιεῖ. τινὲς δὲ καὶ σινῶν ἢ παθῶν πειρῶνται.156 These first three sentences are almost verbatim from Paulus.

There is some marvellous wordplay in this passage. The first line emphasises the height—‘super’ and ‘summo’—from which the fall will come. The second gives us the unfortunate outcomes of the twelfth: ‘infelix’ and ‘inimica’ (both lines show clever allitera-tion). The ‘infelix regio’ clearly contrasts the twelfth with the ‘felix’ eleventh: there are no friends here, nor hopes for the future—only enemies and misery 159 CCAG VIII/4, 127.21–23: ἐὰν δὲ ὁ Ἥλιος καὶ ἡ Σελήνη ἐν τούτῳ τῷ τόπῳ τύχωσιν τῶν κακοποιῶν ἐπικέντρων ὄντων ἀγαθοποιοῦ μὴ ἐπιθεωροῦντος, κυνανθρώπους ποιοῦσιν τοὺς γεννηθέντας . . . .

In a neat twist, Manilius reveals the similarity of opposites and the dis-similarity of neighbours: the eleventh, though adjacent, is really the twelfth’s opposite, while the sixth, though opposite, is its soulmate. Finally, falling is stressed in the last three lines by putting it in tandem with rising-type words: ‘sub occasu . . . praestet’, ‘praetenta . . . deiecta’, ‘scandendum . . . cadendum’. In this way Manilius emphasises the rhythm and symbiosis of rising and falling, for one would not happen without the other.1642.4 Birth and the Twelfth PlaceA number of astrologers connect the twelfth place with childbirth,165 espe-cially with the dangers of labour and delivery. In determining the vitality of an infant, for instance, Manetho watches for malefics afflicting the Moon. When he sees the Moon in the Ascendant besieged by Saturn in the twelfth and Mars in the second (and benefics are not making aspects), ‘then they [Saturn and Mars], cutting the vital fetuses during the birth pangs, / draw them limb-by-limb from the belly.’166This is akin to what Hephaestio says about labour and delivery and the dan-gers of the twelfth:Both Apollinarius and the Egyptians think it worthwhile to examine the zodiac sign rising before the Hour-marker, which they call Bad Daimon, and the post-ascension [of the Hour-marker] which they call life. For when the [sc. malefic] is in the [place] of the Bad Daimon at the hour [of birth], it happens that every danger occurs both for the one in child-birth and the one being born, with the foetus immediately falling into the opening of the uterus, and the joints of the pregnant woman being loosened, incurring danger of death equally for both of them. For the foetus, [this happens] through drowning, but for the woman in childbirth 163 Hübner, Dodekatropos, 35, thinks ‘infelix regio’ may even be a name, not a description, for the 12th (corresponding to kakos daimon), in tandem with the (agathos daimon) ‘felix regio’ of the 11th.164 See ibid., 41, Hübner’s discussion of the complementarity of rising and falling, with examples.165 Manetho, VI.35–42; Paulus, ch. 24; Hephaestio, II, 10; Rhetorius, CCAG VIII/4, 126.15–127.5.166 Manetho VI.41–42 (Lopilato, 114): . . . τότ’ ἐπ’ ὠδίνεσσι βρέφη θρεφθέντ’ ὀλοῇσιν / νηδύος ἐξέλκουσι διαμελεϊστὶ ταμόντες.

And again, after the birth, if malefics are found in the [place] of ‘Life’ and will subsequently take the place of the Moon or the Sun, they will destroy the life and make it of short duration.167This graphic description brings home the dangers of giving birth in antiquity, and reminds us why Rhetorius calls the twelfth metakosmios. It is the place ‘of Kronos, because through the outpouring of waters the fetus is expelled168 and because the mother comes into a state between life and death when the Moon is regarded by Kronos and Ares by opposition.’169 Rhetorius also explains why the first place is called ‘life’: ‘It is so-called because of this: since after the emergence of the Bad Daimon, this zodiac sign emerges and, after the passage of the crisis of life, the one giving birth, and the foetus, appear, and because both have come from danger and darkness into light and life.’170 Cumont sug-gests that even the first place has an ambivalent quality because it is below the horizon, and thus still in the territory of death: ‘. . . the first place is of the hemisphere of death’.171167 II, 10.14–16 (Pingree, 110.28–111.9): Καὶ Ἀπολλινάριός τε καὶ οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι ἀξιοῦσι σκοπεῖν καὶ τὸ προανηνεγμένον ζῴδιον τοῦ ὡροσκόπου, ὃ καὶ κακοδαιμόνημα προσαγορεύουσιν, καὶ τὸ ἐπανα-φερόμενον, ὃ καὶ βίον καλοῦσιν. τοῦ γὰρ [sc. κακοποιοῦ] κακοδαιμονήσαντος ὄντος ἐπὶ τῆς ὥρας πάντα τὸν κίνδυνον συμβαίνει γίνεσθαι τῇ τε τικτούσῃ καὶ τῷ γεννωμένῳ, τοῦ βρέφους εἰς τὸ στόμιον ἤδη τῆς ὑστέρας ἐμπίπτοντος καὶ τῶν ἁρμῶν τῆς κυοφορούσης λυομένων ἀμφοτέροις κίνδυνον ἰσοθάνατον ὑπάρχειν, τῷ μὲν βρέφει διὰ τὸ συμπνίγεσθαι, τῇ δὲ τικτούσῃ διὰ τὸ τοὺς πόρους τῆς γυναικείας φύσεως ὑπὲρ τὸ δέον χαλᾶσθαι. καὶ πάλιν δὲ μετὰ τὸ γεννηθῆναι ἐὰν κακοποιοὶ εὑρεθῶσιν ἐν τῷ βίῳ καὶ διαδέξωνται τὴν Σελήνην ἢ τὸν Ἥλιον, ἀφανίζουσι τὴν ζωὴν καὶ ὀλιγοχρόνιον ποιοῦσιν.168 Ι.e., the release of amniotic fluid.

This system is unique in astrological writing, as far as I am aware.175The papyrus is dated palaeographically to the second century CE,176 and contains, along with its astronomical information, a section on the ‘octotopos’ and a melothesia which weaves together a system of terms, ‘front’ and ‘back parts’ and ‘strong’ and ‘daimonic’ degrees. The melothesia and terms are based on planetary epicycles and motions, and are meant to present an ‘image of man’ (ἀνδρίας) correlated to the heavens.The zodiac signs are divided into ‘additive’ (προσθετικόν) and ‘subtractive’ (ἀ φαιρετικόν) quadrants, with three signs per quadrant; and each of the four quadrants are divided into ‘front parts’ (ἐμπρόσθια) and ‘back parts’ (ὀπίσθια) which are ‘strong’ or ‘daimonic’. ‘Additive’ and ‘subtractive’ quadrants corre-spond to Paulus’s masculine and feminine quadrants.177 Each quadrant con-tains forty-eight degrees of frontparts and forty-two degrees of backparts, with forty-eight strong degrees and forty-two daimonic ones (these are synchro-nised in the additive quadrants, but not in the subtractive ones). There are complete planetary terms, including the Sun and Moon, for each set of front-parts and backparts; these correspond with the melothesia.Let us look specifically at the strong and daimonic degrees. They follow zodiacal order (this is explained in col. vii.12–14). Each quadrant begins with strong degrees and ends with daimonic. The writer apparently begins with Leo (col. vii.7, 20), and I have rotated Robbins’s drawing accordingly, putting the signs of the two luminaries at the top. Both consist only of ‘front parts’. Leo, as the house of the Sun, fittingly consists of ‘strong’ degrees, while Cancer, the Moon’s sign, is entirely daimonic. All the fixed signs (Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius, Taurus) are strong; all the cardinal signs (Cancer, Libra, Capricorn, Aries) dai-monic. The mutable signs are mixed in both categories: strong/daimonic and front-/backparts. (The symmetry beloved of the Hellenistic mind is well in evi-dence here.)What is the meaning of the strong and daimonic degrees? Serapion calls Saturn, Jupiter and Mars ‘strong stars’.178 There are ‘strong leaders’ in Porphyry’s Letter to Anebo;179 could they have something to do with the strong degrees? 174 E.g. HAMA, II, 831.175 Unfortunately, space does not permit a complete analysis of the entire system.176 Robbins, in Winter, ed., Michigan Papyri, 62; Robbins, ‘Michigan Papyrus No. 1’, 1.177 Paulus, ch. 7 (Boer, 20.1–21.3).178 CCAG VIII/4, 227.19: Κραταιοὶ ἀστέρες λέγονται Κρόνος, Ζεύς, Ἄρης.179 Letter to Anebo, 2.12b (Sodano, 24.4): . . . τοὺς λεγομένους κραταιοὺς ἡγεμόνας . . . ."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4154In fact, there may be a decanic connection, as Porphyry mentions decans in the same sentence, and this may be a reason for the daimoniōdeis degrees being last; as we saw earlier (1.2, 121), the decans at the end of the year were considered particularly dangerous. The last degrees of signs are tradition-ally considered to be unfortunate by astrologers: for example, the last terms in the Egyptian and Ptolemaic systems are always allotted to either Mars or Saturn.180 Even the last place, the twelfth, is the place of the Bad Daimon. In Hephaestio (quoting Critodemus), luminaries in the last degrees of a sign mean the child has no lifespan; this outcome also occurs if the last part of a sign marks the hour while malefics hold the first degrees.181There is something a little dangerous about the daimonic degrees; the con-trast with ‘strong’ degrees (a word implying authority at least) suggests some-thing anti-authoritarian, even out of control, about them. All the degrees of the fixed signs, representing permanence, are strong; but those in the tropical and equinoctial signs, where seasonal change occurs, are daimonic. This accords with the Egyptian preference for stability (if indeed this system is originally Egyptian, adapted to a Hellenistic milieu).Strong degrees are always on the right side, and daimonic degrees always on the left, of each quadrant. This preference for the right over the left is found in other instances in astrology. When Ptolemy outlines his reasons for choos-ing aphetic places in Tetr. III, 11.3, he chooses, besides the Ascendant, only places which make right-hand aspects to the Ascendant: the eleventh, tenth, ninth and seventh;182 and he also uses the words ‘power’ and ‘predomination’ (δύναμις and ἐπικράτησις) about them.183 For Serapion, being in superior posi-tion always means being on the right; a planet in a tenth-place position to another planet (putting it to the right of that planet) is superior. In Paulus and Olympiodorus, crises are averted when contact occurs in a right-hand aspect.184 A planet in a ninth-place position to another is also strong because it is to the right of the other planet. Even a planet in fewer degrees is superior to one having more degrees in the same sign because the former is to the right of the latter.185 The same applies to aspects on the right. ‘In each nativity the tenth 180 See Table I.4 in Appendix I.A.181 II, 10.42, 45 (Pingree, 114.22–23; 115.6–8).182 He even refers to the ‘right sextile’, δεξιὰς ἑξαγώνους, of the Good Daimon.183 III, 11.3 (Hübner, 203.562–205.575).184 Paulus, ch. 24 (Boer, 90.2–17); Olympiodorus, ch. 38 (Boer, 133.11–23).185 Serapion’s example uses Mercury at Aries 10º and Saturn at 25º, so Mercury is to Saturn’s right. CCAG VIII/4, 227.1–5: . . . ὅταν δύο ἀστέρες ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ ζῳδίῳ τύχωσιν καὶ ὁ μὲν ἐλάσσονας μοίρας ἐπέχων τὸν τὰς πλείονας μοίρας ἔχοντα καθυπερτερεῖ. οἷον ἔστω τὸν τοῦ Ἑρμοῦ ἀστέρα"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Hie Thee to Hell: The Place of the Bad Daimon 155and ninth from the Moon, that is, the right square and triangle, is called a strong zodiac sign.’186 And ‘Tenth-place position is said to be the right-hand square.’187By contrast, our clues for the daimonic side’s significance are oblique and implied: thus ‘weak’ opposed to strong; ‘left’ opposed to right;188 ‘last’ opposed to first. Serapion does not provide examples of ‘weak’ stars and weak aspects, nor does Ptolemy say that he is choosing the right-hand aspected places over left-hand ones because one is strong and the other weak; it may be understood, but he does not say it.Ultimately, we can only speculate on the motivations for the strange arrangement in this papyrus (and admire its symmetry). It does not appear that any other astrologer ever followed this system, and it does not come into the Arabic tradition.2.6 Final ThoughtsIn practice, Hellenistic astrologers are not necessarily concerned with the motivations of bad daimons, only with the outcomes they produce and where these might be found in the chart. Certainly they were aware of connections between misery and bad daimons and, when the system of astrological places was created, places needed to be found to represent the unfortunate and unpleasant things in life. Culturally, it made sense for the Bad Fortune and Bad Daimon places to be paired, and to contrast them with the other cadent places of the (Sun) god and (Moon) goddess: both gods and daimons must be provided for.When planets are delineated, they mostly cannot overcome the badness of the sixth and twelfth. The odd system of degrees in P. Mich.inv. 1, 149 incor-porates the daimonic and links it to the body. As the place just preceding the Ascendant, the twelfth becomes bound with the perilous process of birth; as places in that grey, liminal space between light and dark (a space which can fill one with the presence of the divine, whether awesome or awful), the sixth and twelfth are places of uncertainty and danger, of things over which one has no control. For astrology, this is the dark side of the daimon.εἶναι Κριῷ περὶ μοῖραν ιʹ, τὸν δὲ τοῦ Κρόνου ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ ζῳδίῳ περὶ μοῖραν κεʹ· δῆλον ὅτι ὁ τοῦ Ἑρμοῦ τὸν τοῦ Κρόνου μοιρικῶς καθυπερτερεῖ.186 CCAG VIII/4, 227.19–21: ζῴδιον κραταιὸν καλεῖται ἑκάστης γενέσεως τὸ δέκατον καὶ ἔννατον ἀπὸ Σελήνης, τουτέστι τὸ δεξιὸν τετράγωνον καὶ τρίγωνον.187 CCAG VIII/4, 227.24: Ἐπιδέκατον λέγεται τὸ δεξιὸν τετράγωνον.188 See Plutarch’s comment, De Iside 361a, that gods are τὰ δεξιὰ but daimons τὰ ἀντίφωνα."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Part 2Gods and Daimons∵"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���6 | doi ��.��63/9789004306��9_007CHAPTER 5Divergent Paths: Daimons and Astrology in Gnosticism and Mithraism. . . as the rising places are proper to the gods, but the setting ones to daimons.Porphyry, On the Cave of the Nymphs in the Odyssey, 291The three previous chapters explored manifestations of good and bad dai-mons in both an astrological and cultural context. This chapter will continue to look at the dichotomy of daimons perceived as good or evil, and astrology as part of the apparatus, within two Greco-Roman and late antique religions, Gnosticism2 and Mithraism. This examination will also involve the topic of gods and daimons in both a religious and astrological milieu. How do these religions characterise gods and daimons in their theology, combined with the way they use astrology? What is considered part of the material world, and how is that world perceived? How is the zodiac characterised? Are planets gods, or daimons, or something else? Is the perception of a god different from that of a daimon, and how is this reflected in religious practice? This investigation will be limited specifically to the intersection of daimon/god and astrology within the religions under consideration.I have chosen to focus on Gnosticism and Mithraism because they exem-plify two different approaches to these concerns, especially in the ways they treat astrological cosmology. What is treated as evil and daimonic in one reli-gion is seen as beneficent and godly in the other. Astrology’s cosmology is a material trap in one, an integral part of religious attainment in the other. Planetary orders are prominent in both religions, with different orders repre-senting different theological doctrines and different theological outcomes. In some cases the two religions treat the very same astrological schemas in dia-metrically opposite ways. Investigating the reasons for this will shed light on 1 ὡς θεοῖς μὲν τὰ ἀνατολικά [sc. οἰκεῖα], δαίμοσι δὲ τὰ δυτικά.

The general category ‘Gnosticism’ can include beliefs and practices of many different sects, not all of whom agree with each other.

F. M. Fontaine, ‘What is Dualism, and what is it not?’ in Light Against Darkness: Dualism in Ancient Mediterranean Religion and the Contemporary World, ed. Armin Lange, et al., Journal of Ancient Judaism Supple­ments (Göttingen: Vandenhoek and Ruprecht, 2011).4 Roger Beck refers to its ‘fundamental dualism’ in R.

Kuhn (San Francisco: HarperCollins, 1987), 65: ‘Dualism dominates the whole of gnostic cosmology, and particularly in relation to creation and its authors.’ (For a mitigation of this view, however, see Z. Pleše, ‘Gnostic Dualism’, in Light Against Darkness: Dualism in Ancient Mediterranean Religion and the Contemporary World, ed. Armin Lange, et al., Journal of Ancient Judaism Supplements (Göttingen: Vandenhoek and Ruprecht, 2011).)6 John Dillon says Persian dualism influenced notions of evil daimons in late antiquity (Dillon, The Middle Platonists, 47), which is true as far as it goes. Yet I think a convergence of dual-istic doctrines present at this time (including Jewish, Christian and Gnostic) influenced the notion of evil daimons. See D. R.

Moreover, astrology’s incorporation into several religions of late antiquity, including Mithraism,10 Zoroastrianism and Gnosticism, merges an astral world view with dualistic principles.In Zoroastrianism, light and darkness, good and evil, are exemplified in Ahura Mazda and Ahriman. The religion and culture of ancient Iran features both good and bad daimons. Diodorus Siculus claims that the Agathos Daimon11 gave laws to Zarathustra, a claim also mentioned in a scholion to the Greater Alcibiades.12 This scholion connects ‘prosperous thought’ (ἐπιτυχὲς νόημα) with 9 See van der Toorn, Becking and van der Horst, eds, DDD, 235–36, for dualism in this era. A. H. Armstrong, ‘Dualism: Platonic, Gnostic, and Christian’, in Neoplatonism and Gnosticism, ed. Richard T. Wallis and Jay Bregman (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1992), 33–54, gives definitions of dualism and applies them to the different traditions flourishing at this time. B. A. Pearson, Ancient Gnosticism: Traditions and Lit­erature (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2007), 334, distinguishes between the ‘monistic type’ of dualism (where evil devolves from a divine transcendent good God), and the dualism of ‘eternally opposing principles of light and darkness.’ For recent research on dualism, see A. Lange et al., eds., Light Against Darkness: Dualism in Ancient Mesopo­tamian Religion and the Contemporary World, Journal of Ancient Judaism Supplements (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2011), containing essays on dualism in Greek phi-losophy, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, Gnosticism and Manichaeism.10 B. Bakhouche, L’Astrologie à Rome (Louvain/Paris/Sterling, VA: Peeters, 2002), 148–56. Roger Beck is a leading proponent of astrology in Mithraism; see, e.g., R. Beck, Planetary Gods and Planetary Orders in the Mysteries of Mithras (Leiden/New York/Copenhagen: E. J.

Diodorus writes (Bibliotheca historica, 1.94.2): ‘Thus it is recorded that among the Arians Zathraustes claimed that the Good Spirit [ἀγαθὸς δαίμων] gave him his laws, among the people known as the Getae who represent themselves to be immortal Zamolxis asserted the same of their common goddess Hestia, and among the Jews Moyses referred his laws to the god who is invoked as Iao.’ (Trans. Oldfather, in Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca historica, vol. 1, trans. C. H. Oldfather (London/New York: Harvard University Press, 1933).) The scholion says: ‘It is said that Zoroaster was six thousand years older than Plato. Some say he was a Greek, but others that he was the offspring of those who originated from the land beyond the great sea, and that he learned all wisdom from the Agathos Daimon, that is, “prosperous thought”.’ Ζωροάστρης ἀρχαιότερος ἑξακισχιλίοις ἔτεσιν ᾗ λέγεται Πλάτωνος· ὃν οἱ μὲν Ἕλληνα, οἱ δὲ τῶν ἐκ τῆς ὑπὲρ"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"162CHAPTER 5the good daimon; we have already seen the daimon commonly associated with nous in Hellenistic philosophy and astrology.13 Plutarch lays out the tenets of Zoroastrianism, as he sees them, in De Iside et Osiride (369e–379c), stressing the stark dualism of Ahura Mazda (Ὡρομάζης) and Ahriman (Ἀρειμάνιος). Iran’s flourishing demonology (daimons were said to control the weather, among other things) incorporated magical practices aimed at apotropaic measures against bad demons.14 Daimons were also associated with both fixed and shooting stars.15Gnosticism is renowned for its severe delineations of good and evil deities, and its casting of the material world as evil. This dualism, which character-ises the spiritual (in the form of a transcendent God) as good and the material (the physical world) as evil, is a special feature of Gnosticism.16 Gnostic cos-mology is complex, with variations among sects, but generally holds that the entire world of planets and earth is ruled by evil daimons,17 sometimes called archons. The chief archon is also the creator of the world, a demiurge who rules either the seventh sphere or the eighth; below him are the spheres of the plan-ets, each ruled by a different demon archon representing different passions or desires. In one sect’s cosmology (the Ophites), the physical world is sur-rounded by the serpent Leviathan, pictured as an ouroboros.18 Humans, born τὴν μεγάλην θάλασσαν ἠπείρου ὁρμωμένων φασίν, πᾶσάν τε σοφίαν παρὰ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ δαίμονος ἐκμαθεῖν, τουτέστιν ἐπιτυχοῦς νοήματος· (W.

But unlike ordinary Gnostic extremism, where the world is irretrievably corrupt, in Mani’s cosmology the world contains bits of light and therefore is not completely demonised. The sun and moon are purely light; the five planets and stars of the zodiac are a mixture of light and darkness.23Neo-Platonism, too, maintained a dualistic strand, exemplified by its treat-ment of daimons, within its monism.24 The Chaldean Oracles’ good iunges and bad sublunar, elemental daimons, formed of evil matter,25 may have influ-enced some Neo-Platonic dogma about good and bad daimons.2619 Rudolph, Gnosis, 70.20 See, e.g., PS IV, 136–137, where there are good archons who follow the light, and Zeus is also a good planet called ‘Little Sabaoth’.21 S.

The Gnostics assert that the planets are ruled by archons, considered to be evil daimons. More astrological influence is revealed in Gnostic fondness for hierarchies of seven and twelve: in addition to the seven planetary archons, there are twelve angels who correlate to the signs of the zodiac. The combination of these groups’ astrological associations with their daimonic indications will now be explored.2.1 Planetary ArchonsThe seven planetary archons are considered to be demons ruling over the world of corruptible matter. The creator of the planetary realms is a demiourgos often called Yaldabaoth. Thus in Gnosticism, the planetary gods of the Greeks are transformed into archontic demons, each ruling a material world which the soul must pass through and transcend in its ascent to heaven. (Compare 27 It will not cover general indications of astrology in a religion or a text, since the remit of this study is the daimon and astrology. One caveat should be kept in mind regarding religious texts: just because they employ astrological terminology or cosmology is not necessarily an indication of any deep knowledge of either theoretical or practical astrol-ogy; they merely draw upon (perhaps incorrectly or incompletely), and reflect, a common astrological worldview. In fact, it is almost fruitless to correlate what seem like astrolog-ical doctrines with actual astrological doctrines, as some have tried to do. Often the for-mer are truncated for the religion’s or text’s own purposes, misunderstood or otherwise bowdlerised.28 Some examples of work on these texts include: A. J.

An obvious Jewish influence seen in the names of the archons29 may have con-tributed to the transformation from god to demon, in that the planets could not be gods.2.1.1 Orders, Lists and Names of ArchonsThe archons are listed in varying orders, and varying names, in Gnostic texts. When seven archons are listed together, connections to planets are often assumed,30 especially since some names have undisputed planetary connections.31 While some can easily be matched with the planet they are said to rule, others are more problematic. Each archon ought to be consistently associated with a particular planet (here including the Sun and Moon), but unfortunately this does not occur in practice. Therefore, scholarly debate is ongoing as to which planets go with which archons. In an attempt to organise and clarify this issue, I shall look closely at the following six texts employing archon names among those used to coordinate names and planets.3229 D. E. Aune, in van der Toorn, Becking and van der Horst, eds, DDD, s.v. ‘Archon’, 85. For Jewish names and terminology in Greek magical texts, see G. Bohak, ‘Hebrew, Hebrew Everywhere?

Scott Noegel, Joel Walker, and Brandon Wheeler (University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 2003), esp., for our purposes, 71. Welburn, ‘Identity’, also discusses Jewish affinities, 245–46. See also the excellent study of A. Mastrocinque, From Jewish Magic to Gnosticism.30 In the case of Irenaeus, at I, 30.9 he specifically says ‘. . . moreover, the holy Hebdomad is the seven stars which they call planets’ (Rousseau-Doutreleau, Tome 1/2, 376, ll.173–174: ‘Sanctam autem Ebdomadem septem stellas quas dicunt planetas . . .’).31 Origen specifically associates Yaldabaoth with Saturn (‘Phainon’); and Iao has close asso-ciations with the Sun (see below).32 Other correspondences in additional texts have been proposed (e.g., see M. Tardieu, Écrits Gnostiques. Codex de Berlin, trans. Michel Tardieu (Paris: Les Éditions du Cerf, 1984), 288; T. Rasimus, Paradise Reconsidered in Gnostic Mythmaking: Rethinking Sethianism in Light of the Ophite Evidence (Leiden/Boston: Brill, 2009), 104; and A. H. B.

Though the editors’ reconstruction in the critical edition is painstaking, the fragmented text is so lacunose that different interpretations could be made of it. See G. Schenke Robinson, H.-M. Schenke, and U.-K. Plisch, eds., Das Berliner “Koptische Buch” (P 20915), 2 vols, Corpus scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium. Scriptores Coptici (Leuven: Peeters, 2004), vol. 1, Fragment 128, 256 (photograph) and 257 (transcription). The lacunae in question occur right in the middle of the list of names. The editors’ reconstruction posits the order Ialdabaoth-Sabaoth-Adonaios-Iaoth-Eloaios-Oraios-Astaphaios, but the empty space after what is probably Ialdabaoth could accommodate ‘Iao’, with Sabaoth follow-ing, then Adonaios, omitting the reconstructed ‘Iaoth’ which follows. The list would then exactly match those of Irenaeus, the Brummer amulet and the Origin of the World (as in Table 5.1). I am grateful to Leo Depuydt and Micah Ross for palaeographical support and advice; the conclusions are my own.34 Adonaios does not appear in VI.31, where the prayers for the ritual are given, but appears in VI.32 as an archontic name derived from Hebrew.35 For Origen, I follow the actual order in which he discusses each archon, not the number he assigns it (e.g. ‘seventh’ for Yaldabaoth)."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":" 167Divergent PathsAmulet and Irenaeus) have an identical order of names, and the ‘Coptic Book’ may very well align with them (see n. 33). Two texts, Irenaeus and Origen, refer to ‘Ophite’ diagrams.36 Thus four of the six lists are likely identical. Origen uses the same names, and his first three names align with the other four lists, but he omits Adonaios (see n. 34) and moves Astaphaios above Ailoaios and Oraios.37 The Apocryphon of John is even more of an outlier. Its list does not begin with Yaldabaoth, some of its names are different and its name order, even if merely reversed, does not match very well with the other five (and especially with the lists containing names in identical order).In the assignment of archons to planets, scholars agree that Ialdabaoth must be Saturn: Origen makes a specific correlation between Ialdabaoth and ‘Phainon’ (the old name for the planet Saturn).38 Some have assumed that a soul ascent or descent is taking place through the planetary spheres, which would suggest planets assigned to the archons in Chaldean order starting with Saturn for Ialdabaoth.39 Welburn took this position as he sought to align Origen’s text 36 Scholarship on the Ophite diagrams includes H.

The Irenaeus text (written in the late second century CE) is probably closest to the original creation of the list.Origen’s text (VI.31) presents the last three names in a different order, and omits Adonaios. Some scholars have assumed Adonaios was left out by mis-take,53 but April DeConick has recently proposed an ingenious solution to Origen’s discrepancies.54 Drawing on the example of Mithraic practices and Numenius’s account of the descent and ascent of souls through the Gates of Cancer and Capricorn (see Porphyry, De antro 21–24, Seminar Classics 609, 20–25), she has determined a sensible reason for Origen’s name order and omission. DeConick does not discuss similar texts, but concentrates only on Origen and Celsus, especially the prayers said in the ritual described by Origen in which Adonaios does not appear. She takes this ritual as one performed by an ‘Ophian-Christian’55 practitioner as a form of spiritual initiation56 rather than an ascent of the soul after death. The initiate begins the spiritual ascent 52 Bouché-Leclercq, AG, 482–83, emphasises the importance of the Sabbath, which is linked to Saturn, in Judaism.

This scheme accounts for the order of the last three archon names (Astaphaios-Taurus, Ailoaios-Gemini, Horaios-Cancer) and the omission of Adonaios (whom DeConick aligns with the Sun), because Leo is absent in this part of the zodiac.57 Thus the initiate depends on the zodiac as a conduit to the planets and their associated archons. While I have reservations about some of DeConick’s observations,58 the scheme in general appears sound in this context. It differs from other texts’ lists because it serves a different purpose.A different purpose applies as well for the list in the Apocryphon of John. This has been obscured by previous scholarly analysis, which has generally tried to tie the lists of these five texts to the differently ordered list in ApJohn, based on similarity of the archon names, and to assign the same order of planets regard-less of archon order. But ApJohn’s version has peculiarities with no parallel in the texts just described.59 First, it contains the names Athoth and Sabbede/Sabbadaios instead of Horaios and Ialdabaoth. Second, it begins with Athoth, not Ialdabaoth.60 Third, it links the archons to animal faces.61 Fourth, and most important for assigning archons to planets, its archon order is different: it ends, instead of begins, with Sabbede (assumed to be Ialdabaoth), and it places Iao in the centre.Das Ophiten­diagramm, 101–02.

R. M.

Although Denzey, ‘Stalking Those Elusive Ophites’, 100, acknowledges the differences between ApJohn as a ‘so-called Sethian’ text (p. 91) and the ‘Ophite’ ones, she too ties ApJohn to a week order (emphasising the word ‘hebdomad’ as symptomatic of the week) rather than a Chaldean order.60 Though it is possible the variants ‘Iaoth’ or ‘Aoth’ could be abbreviations of Ialdabaoth, this does not resolve the name order deviations, and Sabbadaios (and variant spellings) is commonly thought to be Ialdabaoth.61 The association of animals with Hebrew angel names in Celsus/Origen (VI.30) does not match very well with the assignments in ApJohn."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"172CHAPTER 5TABLE 5.3 Archon names and their faces in the Apocryphon of John, with corresponding planet, and zodiac sign from the DodekaorosNHC II 11,26–34/BG 41,16–42,7/ III 17,21–18,862PlanetProsōponZodiac sign (Dodekaoros)Athoth/Iaoth/AothMoonSheep/Lion(Virgo)Eloiaos/Eloaiu/EloaiosMercuryAss/Ass(Leo)Astaphaios/Astaphaios/AstophaiosVenusHyena/HyenaIao/Iao/IazoSunSeven-headed Dragon/Seven-headed Serpent(Gemini)Sabaoth/Adonaios/AdonaiosMarsSerpent/DragonAdonin/Adoni/AdoninJupiterApe/Ape(Capricorn)Sabbede/Sabbataios/SabbadaiosSaturnFire/FireThe placement of Iao in the centre is telling. Iao is often associated with the Sun and, coupled with the uncontroversial assignment of Sabbede to Saturn, gives a strong indication here of (reverse) Chaldean order (see Table 5.2). This proposal has the virtue of aligning the archons here to more of the same plan-ets they receive in the other lists in weekday order, something other proposals (such as Welburn’s and Denzey’s) have not been able to do.63 Athoth’s assign-ment to the Moon also has historically strong connections (see below, 2.2, on the zodiac signs in Gnostic texts). The descriptions of this list as ‘the hebdomad of the week’ need not force us to a weekday order in this instance. Since the Chaldean order is an essential component of the system assigning the names of weekdays via planetary hours, what we see here is emphasis placed on the ‘seven’ who systematise the week and give the days their names.The archons in the Apocryphon of John also have faces (prosōpa),64 a word used in astrological texts when assigning planets to the decans. These can be seen in Table 5.3 above.62 As in Welburn, ‘Identity’, 243. I follow Welburn’s planetary assignments, but add correla-tions to zodiac signs.63 Thus Iao is the Sun, Adonaios is Mars (at least in one version of ApJohn), Astaphaios is Venus and Eloaios is Mercury. Athoth is linked to the Moon in both planetary and zodiac lists.64 Pistis Sophia, III, 126 (Schmidt/MacDermot, 317–19) also lists twelve archons with animal faces."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":" 173Divergent PathsThese mostly animal assignments are not unlike some Egyptian depic-tions of decans.65 They also suggest the Egyptian dodekaoros, which assigns hours to animals: the lion, ass, dragon, serpent and ape are animals in the dodekaoros, derived from constellations which co-rise with the zodiac signs (paranatellonta).66 The lion links to Virgo, the ass to Leo, the dragon/serpent to Gemini, the ape to Capricorn. While the archontic faces may or may not directly derive from astrological faces, decans or dodekaoros, the systems here are similar. In astrology, each planetary god has a certain face, connected with a certain zodiac sign or constellation, and with a certain animal; the Gnostic tradition is the same, except that instead of gods, daimonic beings either carry out conditions mandated by the gods in these particular locations, or are part of the circumstances under which the conditions appear. Since the astrological assignations, both for decans and dodekaoros, appear earlier than Gnostic ones, they provide a rationale or template for the Gnostic system in use here. Similarly, daimonic associations with the archons/planets/prosōpa in Gnosticism may reinforce daimonic connections with the dodekaoros and decans as prosōpa in astrology.What conclusions can we draw about the different orders depicted in these texts? Given DeConick’s proposal for Origen’s list, and my own interpretation of the ApJohn list, I propose that these six texts represent three different sys-tems of archon orders addressing three different concerns of their practition-ers. The weekday order of four of the texts represents a cosmic creation, in time, of archons and corresponding planets, and therefore relates a chrono-logical archontic cosmogony. Origen’s order, as DeConick asserts, supports a ritual of spiritual initiation connected with zodiacal/archontic ascent, with the zodiacal houses of the planets as conduits. ApJohn’s lists are also cosmolog-ical, related to the four weekday-order texts,67 but take a different cosmological perspective in which the order of planets in space are emphasised. Here the planets and their archons who ‘command’ the seven heavens (ApJohn, III 17,20–21; BG 41,16–17) appear in their order as perceived from the earth, begin-ning with the Moon and moving upwards to Saturn. (That this Chaldean order is commonly associated with astrology, considered an exemplar of the mate-rial world, emphasises the archons’ complicity in materiality.) Yet no matter what order is depicted, the fact is that all these facets of Gnostic cosmology tie both zodiac signs and planets to demonic archons.

If so, Hermas must be either Virgo or Gemini.75 He chooses Virgo, and then goes in zodiacal order, assigning the archon above to Leo, and ending with Cancer and the Moon.

Welburn considers this implausible;86 but the sign of Cancer begins at the longest day of the year (the heliacal ris-ing of Sirius, so important in Egyptian cosmology, also takes place in Cancer); Cancer is also the Ascendant of the Thema mundi, the astrological birthday of the world. The Moon’s archon, Athoth/Iaoth, aligns properly with Cancer. Then, instead of zodiacal order through the signs, my suggested scheme fol-lows their diurnal order:87 the next sign would be Gemini, again ruled by Mercury and corresponding to the archon Hermas. Moving through the zodiac in reverse, all of the planetary assignments match with the zodiacal ones ( just as in Welburn’s system). (See Table 5.4.) Diurnal order, the apparent path of the Sun’s daily cycle, emphasises the importance of the Sun, while beginning with Cancer emphasises the importance of the Moon. Apparently it did not occur to Welburn to place the signs in diurnal order, so he was left with the difficulty of explaining why Iaoth/Athoth was linked to the Sun/Leo, and Belias then had to be given to the Moon/Cancer. My adjustment eliminates this problem. In addition, the list in the Gospel of Judas, which says that the first five angels rule over the underworld, would correspond with my scheme, where the first five angels correspond to Cancer, Gemini, Taurus, Aries and Pisces; Aquarius, 85 Pleše, Poetics, 188–89.86 Welburn, ‘Identity’, 249: ‘. . . to begin the sequence at Cancer is so unusual a procedure that it would have to be explained as a “blind” for the uninitiated . . .’.87 There is contemporary evidence of zodiacs being depicted both in zodiacal and diur-nal order; see my discussion in Chapter 3, 1.4, on the Nabataean monument to Tyche at Khirbet et-Tannur (early 2nd century CE); also N. Glueck, ‘The Nabataean Temple of Khirbet et-Tannûr’, 13–14; J. Lindsay, Origins of Astrology (London: Frederick Muller, 1971), 378; R.

On this monument Aries to Virgo go coun-ter-clockwise (zodiacal order) from the top left half of the zodiacal circle, while Libra to Pisces run clockwise (diurnal order) down the top right half.

Possibly this diurnal order, given the evidence outlined here, has antecedents in Egypt. Other Egyptian antecedents for ApJohn have been outlined, e.g., in Quack, ‘Dekane und Gliedervergottung’.

This system could not have been created without the astrological dignities of house rulership already in place. Again, astrology’s system engenders a framework for Gnostic doctrine and inter-twines with it. From the Gnostic side, it may be that Gnostic insistence on the planetary spheres as material, subject to heimarmenē, reinforces the incessant criticism of astrology as a fatalistic practice.2.3 Hierarchies in the Pistis SophiaThe Pistis Sophia is undeniably influenced, even suffused, by the astrological89 and daimonic world view. However, unlike the archons of other Gnostic texts, in this one archons who embrace the light are permitted to escape the dark and material world in which other rebelling archons still remain.90 The lat-ter produce multitudes of aeons, archons, archangels, angels, ministers and decans, all occupying the sphere of Heimarmenē (material fate).91 But Jeu sets 88 Ptolemy, Tetrabiblos, I, 18.3 (Hübner, 58.887–888). Though at this point (253–54) he does not cite Giversen, who originated this idea, Welburn refers to ‘the seven signs from Aries to Libra’ lying above ‘the intersection of the ecliptic and the equator’, and ‘the remaining ones, from Scorpio to Pisces, below.’ He means Giversen’s suggestion that the signs Aries and Libra were the equinoctial signs at the time of Hipparchus, and therefore were ‘above’ with the other five signs between them also ‘above’. I know of no attribution like this in extant astrological texts. Ptolemy’s division of solar and lunar zodiacal semicircles comes the closest to this, I suppose; but there are naturally six signs in each semicircle. Denzey Lewis, Cosmology and Fate, 174, repeats Welburn’s (surely erroneous) attribution as ‘a tra-ditional division in astrology.’ Z. Pleše, ‘Fate, Providence and Astrology in Gnosticism (I): The Apocryphon of John’, MHNH 7 (2007): 237–68, here 245–48, has attempted to make sense of this ‘seven-five’ division by various methods, none of which are entirely successful.89 For aspects of astrology in the Pistis Sophia, see Lancellotti, ‘Gli gnostici e il cielo’, 86–90; van der Vliet, ‘Fate, Magic and Astrology in Pistis Sophia’; and von Lieven, ‘Gnosis and Astrology’.90 As von Lieven, ‘Gnosis and Astrology’ 225 and fig. 1 makes clear, the light and dark sides are based on the day and night houses of the planets: from Leo to Capricorn are day (solar) houses, while Cancer to Aquarius are night (lunar) houses. Thus the zodiac, as well as the planet Jupiter, is not entirely condemned as evil in PS.91 PS IV, 136 (Schmidt/MacDermont, 355.13–16). Von Lieven (‘Gnosis and Astrology’, 224) has proposed that the antecedents of the various archangels and angels are messenger demons associated with Egyptian decan practice."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"180CHAPTER 5‘five other great archons to rule over the 360 and over all the archons which are bound, which are called in the whole world of mankind by these names.

The 360 rulers may correspond to the doctrine of monomoiria in astrology, which assigns one planet to each degree of the zodiacal circle.94 Each aeon is a zodiac sign, as we saw in the Apocry­phon of John and Great Invisible Spirit.A daimonic hierarchy exists as well, linked to the decans and showing clear parallels to the way decans are described in the Hermetic texts.95 Jesus says:I will fulfil you in all the mysteries of the light, and every gnosis . . . from all the gods [ⲛ̄ⲛⲟⲩⲧⲉ] to the demons [ⲛ̄ⲇⲁⲓⲙⲟⲛⲓⲟⲛ]; from all the lords [ⲛ̄ϫⲟⲉⲓⲥ] to the decans [ⲛ̄ⲇⲉⲕⲁⲛⲟⲥ]; from all the authorities [ⲛ̄ⲉⲝⲟⲩⲥⲓⲁ] to the ministers [ⲛ̄ⲗⲓⲧⲟⲩⲣⲅⲟⲥ]; from the creation of men to (that of ) beasts. . . .96The parallel constructions used imply contrasts between gods and daimons, lords and decans, authorities and ministers, men and beasts.

This is consistent with doctrine from other venues like the Hermetica and decan texts. Other contrasts and parallels continue in Book II, where we see: ‘And that mystery [of the Ineffable] knows why the daimons [ⲛ̄ⲇⲁⲓⲙⲟⲛⲓⲟⲛ] came into existence, and why mankind.97 . . . And that mystery knows why the ministers [ⲛ̄ⲗⲉⲓⲧⲟⲩⲣⲅⲟⲥ] came into existence, and why the decans [ⲛ̄ⲇⲉⲕⲁⲛⲟⲥ] .’98The presentation of daimons and decans as subservient in this hierarchy suggests a daimonic component for decans (we shall see evidence of this in Chapter 6). The decans, like daimons (as daimons?), have some power over souls as well: ‘And I will say to you the name of all the decans which act upon the soul in the bodies of the soul in the world, and I will say to you in what manner the souls are acted upon.’99 The concept of decans acting upon souls seems very consistent with ideas of their influence on humans in late Egyptian and Greco-Roman culture; it also coincides, interestingly, with Plato’s descrip-tion of daimons who guide souls in the Myth of Er.100 In any case, the Pistis Sophia shows a prevailing interest in and use of both astrology and daimons in Late Antiquity. The clearly astral decans within its myriad hierarchies may reinforce, or at least parallel, the use of decans within astrological practice. In Gnosticism, daimons and decans operate within the heimarmenē sphere, and are a part of the unfortunate fate of the material world; Mithraism, as we shall see, views the world and heavens in a different way.3 Daimons and Astrology in MithraismIn the last thirty-five years, a number of books and articles on Mithraism have emphasised its reliance on astrological schemas.101 We have seen theories 97 II, 93 (Schmidt/MacDermot, 213.12–14): ‘ϫⲉ ⲡⲙⲩⲥⲧⲏⲣⲓⲟⲛ ⲉⲧⲙ̄ⲙⲁⲩ ⲛ̄ⲧⲟϥ ⲡⲉⲧⲥⲟⲟⲩⲛ ϫⲉ ⲉⲧⲃⲉ ⲟⲩ ⲁⲩϣⲱⲡⲉ ⲛ̄ϭⲓ ⲛ̄ⲇⲁⲓⲙⲟⲛⲓⲟⲛ· ⲁⲩⲱ ⲉⲧⲃⲉ ⲟⲩ ⲁⲥϣⲱⲡⲉ ⲛ̄ϭⲓ ⲧⲙ̅ⲛ̅ⲧ̅ⲣⲱⲙⲉ·’.

The astrologically significant amount of seven, and reliance on the zodiac, also appear, with the Mithraists’ seven grades of initiation, seven spheres and seven gates;103 and the incorporation of the zodiac signs into their planetary orders and on their monuments.In contrast with most forms of Gnosticism, the Mithraic system posits not evil, but good being accomplished from its astrological planetary gods and zodiac. Mithraism posits no evil in matter. The soul ascends is through grades not designed to shake off evil materiality, but to allow the initiate to benefit from the divine planets as he progresses through each grade. Given previous scholarship,104 I shall not provide exhaustive explanations of the Mithraic sys-tem and its reliance on astrological concepts. My interest is in the contrast between Gnostic and Mithraic interpretations of the sky, gods and daimons, and how these affected astrological theory and practice. In particular, I shall explore an alternative thema mundi (birthchart of the world) which may have some dependence on zodiac signs important in Mithraic doctrine.3.1 Astrologers and the Development of MithraismAstrologers provide some testimony on the Mithraic cult. In On the Cave of the Nymphs, Porphyry connects the cave and its entrances in Cancer and Capricorn with Mithras,105 and he calls Mithras ‘the demiurge and master of birth’.106 The gates are also associated with the Sun and the Moon (since the Sun reaches its northernmost point in Cancer, the sign of the Moon), and with Saturn (ruler of Capricorn). Mithras, says Porphyry, is situated near the equinoxes in order xiii–xiv; and Beck himself in the same publication, ‘Mithraism after “Mithraism Since Franz Cumont”’, 3–23. Also D.

The sword he carries is the sword of Ares (ruling Aries), and he rides a bull (Taurus), the symbol of generation and fertility in its ruler, Venus.107 So he is actually lord of both (fertile) life and (violent) death (Venus vs. Mars, Cancer vs. Capricorn).108Another connection between Mithraism and astrologers comes from a the-ory proposed by Roger Beck about the origins of the Mithraic cult in the west.109 He suggests that the astrologer T. Claudius Balbillus was an important force in the development of the Mithraic cult and its introduction into Rome. This theory, plausibly supported by Beck’s evidence,110 would account for the astro-logical emphasis in Mithraism, as well as help to explain its planets as gods and helpers—in contrast to the Gnostic planets as demons and hinderers, even though the two systems have some similiarities of structure.111 Since astrology historically, either as a valid form of divination or as a causal explanation of events on earth, does not see the planets as intrinsically evil,112 its incorpora-tion within Mithraic cosmology, especially if influenced by an astrologer, must stress the fundamental goodness of planets and signs.In addition, Beck suggests that the astrologer Antiochus of Athens is the grandson (on his mother’s side) of Balbillus,113 thereby continuing the astro-logical dynasty started by Thrasyllus, Balbillus’s father.107 De antro, 24 (Seminar Classics 609, 24.10–11): διὸ κριοῦ μὲν φέρει Ἀρηίου ζῳδίου τὴν μάχαιραν, ἐποχεῖται δὲ ταύρῳ, Ἀφροδίτης δὲ καὶ ὁ ταῦρος.108 Roger Beck discusses the Mithraic dimensions in De antro in Beck, Planetary Gods and Planetary Orders, 93–96; he proposes an emendation to this text in R. Beck, ‘The Seat of Mithras at the Equinoxes: Porphyry, De Antro Nympharum 24’, Journal of Mithraic Studies 2 (1977): 95–98 (the emendation, in my view, does not change the significance of Porphyry’s mentioning Ares and Aphrodite, though Beck maintains [97–98] they are now just ‘logical links’ for Porphyry to connect Mithras to the equinoctial signs. But Porphyry has emphasised the Sun, Moon and Saturn for the solstices, so why not a similar emphasis on Ares and Aphrodite for the equinoxes?).109 R.

Bianchi, ‘Mithraism and Gnosticism’, 463–64, discusses this.112 Since they are gods; obviously, this is a philosophical/religious viewpoint, separate from the theoretical and practical idea of the planets categorised according to their effects on the world, i.e. benefic and malefic planets associated with good and bad effects (but even ‘malefic’ planets can do good, as ‘benefic’ planets can do evil, depending on their condition and placement in the chart).113 Beck, Religion of the Mithras Cult, 253–55."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"184CHAPTER 5FIGURE 5.1 Beck’s proposed genealogy of Antiochus of Athens.114If Balbillus is a principal in the formation of Mithraic doctrine, and Antiochus the astrologer is the heir of Balbillus and Thrasyllus, then this, in turn, increases the influence of Mithraism on the astrology of the Roman Empire, to say nothing of the influence of astrology on Mithraism, or at least the Empire’s Mithraic cult. For our purposes, the concepts of god versus daimon, astrological good and bad daimons, the ascent of the soul through plane-tary spheres and the importance of the personal daimon in guiding souls on the path of virtue may all become coloured, knowingly or unknowingly, by Mithraism’s tenets making the planetary gods stations on the way to salvation. (The systems of astrology, in turn, colour the way Mithraic doctrine is laid out.)Some of Beck’s evidence for Antiochus’s Mithraic perspective is supplied by Antiochus’s calendar and his descriptions of astrological apokatastasis.115 Antiochus’s writing on the thema mundi may also give evidence of a Mithraic slant. The thema mundi is commonly described as a chart for the beginning of the world, and may justify the house-dignities of the planets; but clues in Thrasyllus, Antiochus and Firmicus point to another rationale for this chart. 114 Beck, ‘The Mysteries of Mithras’, 126–27 and n. 60.

III, Intro.4), the earliest astrologer in the extant Greek and Latin astro-logical corpus to mention the thema mundi116 is Thrasyllus (cited in a summary of his astrological works): ‘. . . he [Thrasyllus] goes through the nativity of the cosmos and, having described the chart, he recommends also that the nativ-ity of each person be inspected in relationship to the standard of the nativity of the cosmos.’117 The implication, then, is that house rulership (and perhaps exaltation; see below) is an important measure not only of the chart of the world, but also of the charts of individuals.Probably the best-known description of the thema mundi is found in Firmicus, Mathesis III, 1.118116 For general discussions of the thema mundi, including its classical, Indian, Arab and Zoroastrian versions, see E.

Quack, ‘Dekane’, Exkurs: Das rechteckige Himmelsbild von Dendera, das Thema Mundi und der erste Teukros-Text, also discusses the thema mundi related to the zodiacs in Egyptian iconography and a text of Teucer. Quack first concentrates on the angles of the thema mundi, rather than the planets in it. He also discusses the dif-ferences between the Firmicus and Paulus themata, and mentions Thrasyllus, Antiochus and Vettius Valens; in the 2014 version of this work, he does mention Antiochus’s sec-ond thema, but regards it as unrelated to what he considers to be the Egyptian-derived thema mundi.117 CCAG VIII/3, 100.27–30: . . . διαλαμβάνει περὶ τῆς κόσμου γενέσεως καὶ τὸ θεμάτιον διαγράψας τῷ λόγῳ παραινεῖ πρὸς τὸν κανόνα τῆς τοῦ κόσμου γενέσεως καὶ τὴν καθ’ ἕκαστον τῶν ἀνθρώπων γένεσιν ἐπισκοπεῖσθαι.118 Mathesis (KSZ I, 91 = Monat, II, 15).

Thus the planets except for the Moon fall in their ‘solar’ houses (Ptolemy, Tetr. I, 17), from Leo to Capricorn. Since the Sun is in Leo and falls in the second place, the chart is nocturnal.119Firmicus says the chart comes from Nechepso and Petosiris;120 they received it from Aesculapius and Hanubius (Asclepius and Anubis),121 who received it 119 Though most themata mundi show the Sun in Leo, a variant in Paulus’s Introduction, ch. 37 (Boer, 99.3–4), has the Sun in Aries 19º, the sign and degree of its exaltation.120 III, Intro.4 (KSZ, I, 91.3–7 = Monat, II, 15): Quare illi divini viri atque omni admiratione digni Petosiris, Nechepso, quorum prudentia ad ipsa secreta divinitatis accessit, etiam mundi genituram divino nobis scientiae magisterio tradiderunt. . . .121 Though Obbink accepts this as a testimonium of the 1st century CE astrologer Anubio (Anubio, Carmen Astrologicum Elegiacum, ed.

Not only is this the chart of the world, it aims to show that humans are ‘formed in accordance with the nature of the world and in likeness with those same principles by which the world itself is ruled and comprised’ (III, Intro.4).122 For Firmicus, the chart is mythic and symbolic.123 He may have been familiar with Thrasyllus’s work on the thema mundi, for he also says ‘. . . so that the astrologers could follow an example in the birthcharts of humans, the divine men, with skilled reasoning, therefore conceived this [chart] as if it were the birthchart of the world.’124 From this and the comment at III, Intro.4, one might intimate that this chart, with the planets in the signs of their rulerships, could also represent the chart of someone ‘divine’. In Antiochus, transformation from thema mundi to thema dei is explicitly made: we find that the ‘nativity of the cosmos’ has become the nativity of a god:. . . he [Antiochus] says, according to the opinion of the ancients, that a nativity of a god comes to be when the 7 stars happen to be in their own houses, as a mortal nativity would not be so fortunate. Example: when Cancer marks the hour, holding the Moon; the Sun follows, occupying Leo, then Hermes in Virgo, after which Aphrodite in Libra and Ares in Scorpio; Zeus in Sagittarius and Kronos in Capricorn; or otherwise, when Aquarius marking the hour holds Kronos, Pisces follows with Zeus, then Aries holding Ares and Taurus Aphrodite; Gemini Hermes, Cancer the Moon and Leo the Sun; but he says such nativities are worthy of more divine portions,125 and those which come close to these [divine nativities] 2006), see T3, p. 3), see the persuasive case against this, and arguing for a reference to the god Anubis, in S.

And in their own exaltations the stars are productive and sig-nify an illustrious nativity, even if not [exactly] alike.126It is an astonishing development to see the thema mundi metamorphose into the chart of an immortal. (There can be no doubt that this is what Antiochus intends, since the positions in his first chart are identical to those of the usual thema mundi.) Not only that, but the alternative chart he offers is also astound-ing in its implications.Instead of Cancer rising, this chart has Aquarius rising. In Porphyry’s On the Cave of the Nymphs, we find: ‘For the Egyptians, the beginning of the year is not Aquarius, as it is for the Romans, but Cancer.’127 I have found no other text which says the Roman new year begins in Aquarius;128 is this connected with Mithraism in some way, and could this be one reason why Antiochus chose an Aquarius Ascendant for his alternative chart?129 Antiochus may merely be pro-posing an additional chart based on the planetary rulers of the other signs, but (1933): 135–56, here 146, n. 3, where he discusses this paragraph and cites this expression in Philo, Legatio ad Gaium, 76 (the context is similar in that it discusses someone consid-ered superior to mere mortals being given a ‘more divine portion’).126 Introduction, Book II, 1, CCAG VIII/3, 118.29–119.12: . . . θεοῦ γένεσιν καὶ κατὰ τὴν τῶν παλαιῶν δόξαν γίνεσθαι λέγει, ἐν ᾗ οἱ ζʹ ἀστέρες ἐν ἰδίοις οἴκοις ἔτυχον ὄντες, ὡς οὐκ ἂν τοσοῦτον θνητῆς γενέσεως εὐτυχησάσης. ὑπόδειγμα· οἷον ὡροσκοπεῖ μὲν Καρκίνος ἔχων τὴν Σελήνην, ἀκολουθεῖ δὲ Ἥλιος Λέοντι ἐπέχων, εἶτα Ἑρμῆς ἐν Παρθένῳ, μεθ’ ὧν ἐν Ζυγῷ Ἀφροδίτη καὶ Ἄρης ἐν Σκορπίῳ, ἐν Τοξότῃ δὲ Ζεὺς καὶ Κρόνος ἐν Αἰγόκερῳ, ἢ πάλιν ὡροσκοποῦντος Ὑδροχόου ἔχοντος Κρόνον, ἑπομένων δὲ Ἰχθύων μετὰ Διός, εἶτα Κριοῦ τὸν Ἄρην ἔχοντος καὶ Ταύρου μὲν τὴν Ἀφροδίτην, Διδύμων δὲ τὸν Ἑρμῆν καὶ Καρκίνου τὴν Σελήνην καὶ Λέοντος τὸν Ἥλιον· ἀλλὰ τὰς μὲν τοιαύτας γενέσεις θειοτέρας ἀξιοῦσθαι μοίρας φησίν, ἐγγίζειν δὲ ταύταις ὅσαι κατὰ πλείονα κοινωνοῦσιν, τὰς δὲ κατ’ ὀλίγα διίστασθαι, τὰς δὲ κατὰ μηδὲν εἰς ἔσχατον δυστυχίας ἥκειν· καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἰδίοις δὲ ὑψώμασιν τοὺς ἀστέρας χρηματίζοντας λαμπρὰν τὴν γένεσιν, εἰ καὶ μὴ ὁμοίαν, σημαίνειν.127 De antro 24 (Seminar Classics 609, 23.33–24.1): Αἰγυπτίοις δὲ ἀρχὴ ἔτους οὐχ ὁ ὑδροχόος, ὡς Ῥωμαίοις, ἀλλὰ καρκίνος·. . . .128 Julius Caesar introduced the solar calendar beginning on 1 January, 45 BCE. The Roman civil year began on 1 January, but zodiacally speaking this date is in the sign of Capricorn, not Aquarius. The Egyptian new year began with the heliacal rising of Sirius in Cancer. I thank Attilio Mastrocinque for spurring me to clarify this dating question.129 There is no available evidence to answer this question. Porphyry may have mistakenly written Aquarius for Capricorn, or he may have considered January the ‘Aquarius month’ because the sign begins in January.

This chart, with an Aquarius Ascendant and Saturn in the first place, could show a Mithraic connection between Saturn, representing the highest grade in Mithraism, and the Ascendant sig-nifying the life (i.e., the coming into existence) of the person.130 Thus some ‘divine’ people are born having descended directly from the highest sphere, Saturn’s (rather than the usual thema mundi with its Cancer Ascendant, ruled by the lowest sphere of the Moon).The Aquarius Ascendant compels other striking changes: first, because the Sun remains in its own house, Leo, the chart becomes diurnal. Astrologically, this emphasises the importance of the Sun, even though it falls in the seventh 130 For a discussion of the importance of Saturn in relation to the birth of Mithras, see M. J.

Second, though still in the lower hemisphere, the planets now are in the signs of their lunar houses (Aquarius through Cancer; Ptolemy, Tetr. I, 17). Third, Taurus now falls in the fourth place, the foundation of the chart, and Taurus is the symbol par excellence of Mithras. Fourth, instead of tropical angles, we have fixed ones, and these correlate much better with Mithraic doctrine which emphasises fixed signs.131 Fifth, Mars and Venus now fall in Aries and Taurus respectively, and we have seen above (3.1) that Mithras bears the sword of Ares (ruler of Aries) and rides on a bull (Taurus); these planetary placements thus conform more to Mithraic mythology.A further, albeit speculative, conclusion may be drawn from this alternate thema dei: because Antiochus has designated these charts as those of ‘gods’, this alternative chart could be his creation of a symbolic chart for the divine Mithras132 (though Antiochus never identifies it as such). As an ‘example’ of a god’s chart, it provides a template to which an initiate moving towards the completion of the soul’s ascent could aspire.133 Some support for this hypoth-131 The connection of Taurus the bull to Mithraism is obvious, as is Leo the lion; but Scorpio and Aquarius also have some prominence.

The Yavanajātaka, ch. 8, 5 states that a chart with all planets in signs of their exaltations produces a ‘lord of the earth bounded by the seas’ (Pingree, Yavanajātaka, vol. 2, 27); ch. 8, 12 says when all planets are in their own houses, it produces ‘an emperor (rājādhirāja)’ (Pingree, Yavanajātaka, vol. 2, 28), not a god, as Antiochus says. But note that Antiochus says that planets in their exalta-tions signify an illustrious nativity; could this be the origin of the Indian practice leading to the Iranian exaltation thema applied to Gayomart? Raffaelli, L’oroscopo del mundo, 147, also suggests this idea: ‘Questa dottrina [in Antiochus] era probabilmente presente nel testo greco da cui fu tradotto il Yavanajātaka, e fu sviluppata et arricchita nel testo san-scrito con elementi propri della tradizione indiana.’FIGURE 5.4 The Birth of Mithras from a Cosmic Egg (Housesteads Monument, Hadrian’s Wall [CIMRM 860]) (photograph courtesy and with the kind permission of the Great North Museum, Hancock, Northumberland and the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle)."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"192CHAPTER 5a womblike shape around him. One wonders if this shape was deliberately meant to suggest the delivery of the fetus at the time Aquarius was literally beginning its ascent (recall Porphyry’s comment, at the beginning of this chap-ter, that ‘rising places are proper to the gods’134). The zodiac’s order is clockwise (i.e. primary or diurnal motion), beginning with Aquarius in the bottom lower left, culminating with Cancer and Leo at the top, and finishing with Capricorn in the lower right. Certainly on one level, as Beck points out, this represents the lunar and solar houses of the planets135 (we should note that only by beginning the zodiac with Aquarius in the lower left and moving clockwise could Cancer and Leo end up at the top). But Mithraic symbolism can be multi-layered, and this arrangement could equally show the ascent and descent of the soul, as Beck also proposes.136 Beck has also noticed, via the arrangement of the plan-etary houses, a connection to the thema mundi, suggesting that the depiction of the world’s birth is a fitting image for the birth of its ruler, Mithras.137 Beck has not, however, made the next logical step: that this particular, non-tradi-tional thema mundi could also contain within itself, and represent, the sym-bolic birthchart of Mithras, using not Cancer as its Ascendant but Aquarius. Antiochus, the heir of his Mithras-loving ancestors, has taken the familiar birthchart of the world and given it a new perspective, still keeping the planets in their own houses, but using the lunar, not the solar, ones; and by so doing has created the birthchart of a god, Mithras.3.3 Other Implications of the thema deiThere may also be a daimonic component in the thema dei’s rôle of exemplify-ing a way to ascend to a godlike state. CH X states that one of the stages humans pass through in their ascent towards divinity is that of a daimon: ‘human beings take hold of the beginning of immortality as they change into daimons, then in this manner [coming] into the chorus of gods; there are two choruses 134 (Seminar Classics 609, 28.15): . . . θεοῖς μὲν τὰ ἀνατολικά [sc. οἰκεῖα]. . . . ‘ἀνατολικά’ can also mean eastern, and the astrological Ascendant, of course, is the zodiac sign and degree on the eastern horizon at the time of birth.135 Beck, Planetary Gods and Planetary Orders, 35–38; idem, Religion of the Mithras Cult, 219–20; idem, Beck on Mithraism, 157.136 Beck, Planetary Gods and Planetary Orders, 41–42. He was speaking primarily of the Trier monument (which contains a half-zodiac, Aries to Virgo), but also mentions the Housesteads one. We have seen DeConick’s proposal of the appropriation of its ascent by the Ophites, but the egg birth of Mithras, in my view, is the key to its primary intent.137 Ibid., 39."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":" 193Divergent Pathsof gods, one wandering and the other fixed.’138 The ‘wandering’ and ‘fixed’ gods, plainly planets and stars, demonstrate the astral component in this ascent.In addition to a thema dei, some ways of determining eminence in an astro-logical chart are based on the planets in signs of dignity. Along with other criteria, those of noble or elevated status are said to have charts containing dignified planets (especially by house and exaltation, or if the triplicity lords of the sect luminary are dignified). Vettius Valens uses the Lot of Exaltation (using the arc between the Sun and Aries by day, and the Moon and Taurus by night) for distinguished births in II, 19, with examples in II, 22 (especially the first).139 Someone trying to become more god-like, in a Hermetic or Mithraic ritual, moves from the earth to the stars, from human to daimon and thence to god. In astrology, the example of the thema mundi/thema dei provides a view of the pinnacle for the same kind of ascent. Chapter Six will explore additional themes of daimons and stars in the context of the Magical Papyri, the Hermetica and the decans. These daimons, too, will vary in their functions depending on the uses to which they are put.138 CH X, 7.10–13, (Nock and Festugière, CH I, 116.14–17): αἱ δὲ ἀνθρώπιναι ἀρχὴν ἀθανασίας ἴσχουσιν εἰς δαίμονας μεταβάλλουσαι, εἶθ’ οὕτως εἰς τὸν τῶν θεῶν χορόν· χοροὶ δὲ δύο θεῶν, ὁ μὲν τῶν πλανωμένων, ὁ δὲ τῶν ἀπλανῶν.

Specifically, these are the daimons of the Magical Papyri, the Hermetic texts, and the decans of Hellenistic astrology. They are helpers or hinderers of human actions and what befalls humans: those who aid human endeavours, but also those who thwart them; those who cause illnesses (physical and men-tal) and injury, and those who cure them. In these texts the powers of good daimons often help humans ward off the effects of bad daimons. Ambivalence also applies when a daimon acts either benefically or malefically depending on circumstances. In the Magical Papyri and Hermetic texts we come the closest to the realm of magic and where astrology and the daimon intersect with it. The decans provide another venue for ‘daimonic’ and astral concerns. Thus the chapter includes an overview of the decans from their origin in the Egyptian Middle Kingdom to their use in the astrology of late antiquity.I also use ‘ambivalent daimons’ in another sense: considering the ‘divinity’ of the daimon. What is the relationship between gods and daimons, and the line between them in regard to how they function and what they are able to do, within the astrological milieu? Can a god also be a daimon? What distin-guishes gods from daimons?The objectives of this chapter focus on the interplay between good and bad daimons: how the actions of one lead to the responses of the other, as well as on the further segregation of the good daimons who become classed as ‘angels’ and the bad daimons, classed as ‘demons’, which takes place in the world of late antiquity. Important also is the case of the daimon whose response is either beneficial or malicious, the quintessential ‘ambivalent daimon’. A fur-ther objective considers the interplay between gods and daimons. The final goal of this chapter is to see how astrological practice integrates with these concerns, and the areas of astrological technique which contain manifesta-tions of them.1 γίγνονται γὰρ, ὡς ἐν ἀνθρώποις, κἀν δαίμοσιν ἀρετῆς διαφοραὶ καὶ κακίας.

Just investigating daimons in the papyri would be a major study in itself,4 so we shall only explore the intersections between the daimon (in whatever form) and astrology in these texts. There are numerous references to daimons of all kinds in the Magical Papyri,5 including good, bad and personal daimons, as well as the deity called Agathos Daimon.6Of the texts which mention daimons or astrology, some give spells for warding off bad daimons or exorcising them, appeal to good daimons (espe-cially Agathos Daimon, whose functions are godlike) or angels, and exhort that rituals be performed at the proper astrological time (katarchai). For texts combining daimons with astrological practice, the following are of interest: PGM IV.1637–95, PGM IV.2967–3006, PGM VII.505–28, PGM XIII.1–343, PGM XIII.343–646, PGM XIII.646–734, PGM XIII.734–1077 and PDM XIV.1–114.7 They give instructions for finding a personal daimon, performing a rite and invoking gods and good daimons at the proper astrological time, and being able to change the fated parts of one’s astrological birthchart by appealing to a good daimon.2 My primary resource for the Magical Papyri is Betz, ed., GMP, because it includes Demotic as well as Greek material. For the Greek I use the standard critical edition, K. Preisendanz, Papyri Graecae Magicae. Die griechischen Zauberpapyri, 2nd ed., ed. and trans. Karl Preisendanz, (Stuttgart: B. G. Teubner, 1973–1974).3 See R. K. Ritner, ‘Egyptian Magical Practice under the Roman Empire: the Demotic Spells and their Religious Context’, in ANRW, vol. II, 18.5, ed.

Gundel, Weltbild und Astrologie in den griechischen Zauberpapryi (Munich: C. H. Beck, 1968) for work in this regard.5 A search of these texts in the TLG retrieves more than 30 substantial passages mentioning daimons. Forms of the word ‘daimon’ are mentioned 160 times in the papyri (Preisendanz edition).6 Sfameni Gasparro, ‘Magie et démonologie’, 163–69, details five categories of daimons: inva-sive or possessing, spirits of the dead, prophetic, companion (paredros) and personal.7 See brief coverage of the Agathos Daimon in magical papyri in D.

The local Fortune and Daimon are verbally propitiated; again, the phrasing ‘Tyche and Daimon of this place’ could be a double entendre, referring not only to the local deities, but to the katarchic chart and the literal astrological places of Good Fortune and Good Daimon, as in the previous spell. That spell also uses an astrologically propitious beginning for the ritual.I see parallel constructions in this text between Tyche and the specific place, present hour and day (local space and time) and the larger, visible material world (the ‘surrounding environment’); and between Daimon and ‘every day’, the general concept of day created by the solar cycle, and the Sun itself as lord of the firmament who has an ‘unseen light’ (its light prevails even though unseen when it is under the earth). Parallels between Tyche and the material world (often the body) and Daimon and the Sun are, as demonstrated already in this book, not unusual.14Jan Bergman pointed out the strong Egyptian influence on this spell, espe-cially regarding lines 516–21.15 He makes a convincing case which connects the Sun’s (the Egyptian god Re) descriptions here with the gods Khepri and Atum. Khepri is the god of becoming, of coming into being, represented by the scar-ab,16 while Atum is the primordial creator god of Helipolis, often combined with Re as Re-Atum.17 The links with Agathos Daimon and the Sun are also clear; we find such links elsewhere in the Greek Magical Papyri18 and in astro-logical texts where Sun and daimon are connected.1913 VII.506–9 (Preisendanz, II, 23). H. Martin Jr., in Betz, ed., GMP, 132, translates τὸ περιέχον as ‘Universe’, which seems not quite right. Bergman, ‘Ancient Egyptian Theogony in PGM VII’, 29, suggests ‘All-Embracing’, much closer to the Greek meaning; Preisendanz offers the similar ‘Umfassendes’.14 The reference to the Sun as having an unseen light suggests links with the non-material and noetic. It may also be a tiny indication of why the Lot of Daimon is later characterised by Arabic astrology as the Lot of the Absent or Hidden (i.e. unseen).15 Bergman, ‘Ancient Egyptian Theogony in PGM VII’, 30–37.16 Ibid., 32.17 Morenz, Egyptian Religion, 260.18 Such as PGM IV.1596–1715, an invocation to Helios as Agathos Daimon, ‘. . . who rises from the four winds, the propitious Agathos Daimon, for whom heaven has become the place of procession’ (ll. 1605–1610 [Preisendanz, I, 124]): δεῦρό μοι, ὁ ἀνατέλλων ἐκ τῶν τεσσάρων ἀνέμων, ὁ ἱλαρὸς Ἀγαθὸς Δαίμων, ᾧ οὐρανὸς ἐγένετο κωμαστήριον); and PGM XXXVI.211–230, a prayer to Helios, you who are ‘the Good Daimon of the world’ (ll. 216–17 [Preisendanz, II, 170]): ὁ Ἀγαθὸς Δαίμων τοῦ κόσμου).19 See Chapter 9, section 1 (‘The Lots and their Luminaries’), 305–07 and Table 9.1."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":" 199Ambivalent Daimons and AstrologyBut why the allusions to the Sun as Agathos Daimon, and how does this con-nect with astrology and communicating with one’s personal daimon?20 First, the Sun’s ties to Khepri and Atum in Egyptian doctrine are not unusual; as early as the Pyramid Texts, three phases of the sun in the morning, at noon and in the evening were each associated with the gods Khepri, Re and Atum (Khepri in the morning, Re at noon and Atum in the evening).21 The Sun is thus connected with all facets of creation but, with Atum as the setting sun, repre-sents not only the beginning of life but also the end. The procedure after the invocation involves two male eggs22 (symbols of life), which Bergman also con-nects with Khepri and Atum.23 Thus we have a symbolic cycle of coming-to-be and passing-away, of birth and death controlled by the sun and, in its daily journey through the heavens and under the earth, linked to gods representing birth and death. The greetings at the beginning of the spell show a move from lesser to greater, from the local fortune and daimon, from the specific hour and day of the astrological chart to the surrounding environment of the whole earth and heaven, culminating with the Sun. The Sun as the overarching Good Daimon, in a kind of reverse synecdoche (the whole for a part, or the greater for the lesser), then stands for the personal daimon of the invoker, and repre-sents the cause of his birth and death as well. The invoker prays to the Agathos Daimon to meet his own agathos daimon.Another invocation to the Sun, PGM XXXVI.211–30, also suggests a katarchic chart for the time of the rite (and links the Sun with Khepri and Atum as youth and old man, rising and setting).24Rejoice with me, you who have been set over the east and over the cos-mos, whom all the gods accompany, at your good hour, your good day, the Agathos Daimon of the world, the crown of the inhabited world, the one rising from the abyss, every day being born as a youth and setting as an old man. . . . . . . but [let me] take and seize from you life, health, reputa-tion, wealth, power, strength, good luck, loveliness, favour for all men and 20 H.

We see as well the astro-logical term used for the attendants of the Sun, doryphoroi, planets within a certain distance of the Sun in an astrological chart, who serve as his body-guards.27 The chart is created at the best astrological time to propitiate the Sun, with the Sun in a good place and accompanied by planets which can help him. In addition, the boons sought from the Agathos Daimon/Sun are similar to those which describe the astrological places, or points such as the Lot of Fortune or Daimon.281.3 Changing your Fate: The Eighth Book of MosesPGM XIII (P.

Saur, 2005).28 Life = 1st place, health = 6th, reputation = 10th, wealth = 2nd, good luck (epituchia) = 5th; loveliness (epaphrodisia) is used by Vettius Valens (IV, 4.3; Pingree, 152.2–3, 153.4) to describe effects of the Lot of Fortune. Certainly these are common life desiderata, but it is worth pointing out that astrological parallels exist.29 Text and German translation in Preisendanz II, 86–131; an edition, with photographs and transcription, is R.

The ritual should begin only when the new moon is in Aries (lines 5–6, 347–49). The ruling god tells the initiate about the fate determined for him at his birth, his own daimon and his astrological birth-chart. The relevant passages for our discussion are:1. An angel will come in, and you say to the angel: ‘hail, lord. Initiate me by these acts of mine, and recommend me [to the god], and let the [components] of my nativity be revealed to me; and if he says something bad, say: ‘expunge the evil parts of my fate. . . .’32James R. Davila, and Alexander Panayotov (Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 2013), 189–235.30 I use the word ‘Christianising’ based on the analysis of T. Klutz, ‘Jesus, Morton Smith and the Eighth Book of Moses (PGM 13.1–734)’, Journal for the Study of the Pseudepigrapha 21, no. 2 (2011): 133–59, here 152–54.

Klutz, 136, lays out the history of the scholarship. I thank Claire Chandler for a copy of Klutz’s article. (Klutz summarises similarly: Klutz, trans., ‘Eighth Book of Moses’, 189–90.)31 ‘πολεύοντος’ (lines 213, 718), the technical astrological term for a planet presiding over a day and specific hour of a day: see Paulus, ch. 21. Previous translators have missed the technical significance of πολεύω, but it is clear that what Paulus describes, using the exact verb the papyrus uses, is what is meant here and in other references to gods of the days and the hours (at lines 118–22, 674–79, and especially 53–60 and Version B’s 424–32, where B correctly says that the method for determining the hourly, daily and weekly gods’ names is at the end of the text, 718–30). Having said that, the papyrus’s actual method for finding the presiding god differs from that in Paulus, and seems to be unique.32 PGM XIII.608–14 (Preisendanz, II, 115–16): . . . εἰσελεύσεται ἄγγελος, καὶ λέγε τῷ ἀγ<γ>έλῳ· ‘χαῖρε, κύριε, καὶ τέλεσόν με τοῖς πράγμασί μου τούτοις καὶ σύστησόν με καὶ μηνυέσθω μοι τὰ τῆς γενέσεώς μου.’ καὶ ἐὰν εἴπῃ τι φαῦλον, λέγε· ‘ἀπάλειψόν μου τὰ τῆς εἱμαρμένης κακά . . . . Genesis here is not ‘birth’ as Smith, in Betz, ed., GMP, 187 and Klutz, trans., ‘Eighth Book of Moses’, 223 have rendered, but ‘nativity’, i.e. the astrological birth-chart (also used in the same context in line 620). Preisendanz, II, 115, translated this correctly: ‘der Inhalt meines Horoskops’ (assuming he means the entire birthchart, not just the Ascendant)."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"202CHAPTER 62.

But if you hear something bad, do not shriek, do not howl, but beg that he expunge or treat it. For this god can do all things.34These passages on the initiate’s birthchart and changing its material fate appear in Version B but are omitted in the ‘Christianised’ Version A.35 The three passages develop the same subject matter. The first and second passages are contained within the same section dealing with the initiate’s presentation to the god and the god’s power over heimarmenē in the birthchart. The third passage expands on this theme by connecting the specific details of the birth-chart with the personal daimon, the life of the initiate and the god’s ability to affect the events of the life.3633 PGM XIII.633–37 (Preisendanz, II, 116): διαφύλαξόν με ἀπὸ πάσης τῆς ἰδίας μου ἀστρικῆς, ἀνάλυσόν μου τὴν σαπρὰν εἱμαρμένην, μέρισόν μοι ἀγαθὰ ἐν τῇ γενέσει μου, αὔξησόν μου τὸν βίον καὶ ἐν πολλοῖς ἀγαθοῖς . . . . ‘Safeguard’ is Klutz’s apt translation (Klutz, trans., ‘Eighth Book of Moses’, 223). Again, genesis is the astrological birthchart. I disagree with Klutz, trans., ‘Eighth Book of Moses’, 223, that ‘τὸν βίον καὶ ἐν πολλοῖς ἀγαθοῖς’ should be taken as separate phrases; it is material goods which improve the manner of living. I do not think bios refers to longevity.34 PGM XIII.708–14 (Preisendanz, II, 119): σὺ δὲ πυνθάνου· ‘δέσποτα, τί μοι εἵμαρται;’ καὶ ἐρεῖ σοι καὶ περὶ ἄστρου καὶ ποῖός ἐστιν ὁ σὸς δαίμων καὶ ὁ ὡροσκόπος, καὶ ποῦ ζήσῃ καὶ ποῦ ἀποθανεῖσαι. ἐὰν δέ τι φαῦλον ἀκούσῃς, μὴ κράξῃς, μὴ κλαύσῃς, ἀλλὰ ἐρώτα, ἵνα αὐτὸς ἀπαλείψῃ ἢ μεθοδεύσῃ. δύναται γὰρ πάντα ὁ θεὸς οὗτος. Preisendanz, who originally (1931) translated ‘ὡροσκόπος’ as ‘Horoskop’ in the PGM (the same in subesequent edi-tions), changed his opinion in K. Preisendanz, ‘Review of “Wilhelm Gundel, Dekane und Dekansternbilder”’, GGA 201 (1939): 129–49, here 135, n. 1: ‘meine Übersetzung “dein Horoskop” ist in “Stundenschauer”, “Dekan” zu ändern.’ Gundel, Weltbild und Astrologie, 20 and 68, n. 14, believes the ‘ὡροσκόπος’ is a decan; Klutz, trans., ‘Eighth Book of Moses’, 227 and note a, chose ‘ascendant decan’, conflating two possible meanings for ὡροσκόπος: but see below, 2.1, 210–11.35 Noticed also by Klutz, ‘Jesus, Morton Smith and Moses VIII’, 138, yet he apparently consid-ers this difference ‘negligible’ (139).36 A text containing material relating to the changing of fate, but with different parame-ters, is P.

Totti, Ausgewählte Texte der Isis- und"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":" 203Ambivalent Daimons and AstrologyLet us look at some of the terminology in these passages. ‘διαφύλαξόν με ἀπὸ πάσης τῆς ἰδίας μου ἀστρικῆς’ in the second passage was translated by Morton Smith as ‘Protect me from my own astrological destiny’.37 This is an odd phrase, with odd wording. If, in fact, heimarmenē is implied with astrikē,38 then the ini-tiate is assuming the power of the god to change the astrological chart (with its material constraints) that has been allotted for him. Thus the god can change the initiate’s material fate by changing his chart, as we see in the phrase ‘appor-tion goods for me in my nativity’, etc. This is tantamount to treating the natal chart as katarchic, having the god give the initiate a personal chart which takes advantage of the best moment for birth. In this ritual, the god symbolically and literally apportions by means of the astrological birthchart.Both the first and third passages refer to the ‘expunging’ of bad fate. Ἀπαλείφω is the word used when expunging a record, thus erasing evidence of its existence. The invoked god39 thus has the power to change the record of a life given in the chart. The third passage uses both ἀπαλείφω and μεθοδεύω; the latter means to treat by method or rule, and is often used in medical contexts. So the god can expunge the record or treat it, even ‘cure’ it, using the rules (of astrology?). If the god can make changes in the outcomes of the natal chart, then this can affect subsequent astrological techniques such as profections or Sarapis-Religion, 29–31 (no. 12); Greek text and English translation in D. L. Page, Select Papyri III: Literary Papyri, Poetry (London/Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1950), 424–29. In this text Sarapis is able to change the untimely death date of a pau-per by exchanging it with that of a Libyan, suffering and in pain, whose time of death according to the fates has not arrived. The exchange is possible because the two share the same birthchart (συναστρία; note that this word is used by Ptolemy, Tetr. IV, 7.435, 476, 502 (Hübner), in the sense of temporary ‘friendships’ of stars), but here it appears to mean the two have similar charts (see F. Boll, Kleine Schriften zur Sternkunde des Altertums (Leipzig: Koehler & Amelang, 1950), ‘Sternenfreundschaft’ and ‘Synastria’, 115–25). The text is note-worthy for our purposes because Sarapis, of course, has links to the Agathos Daimon (see above, Chapter 3). R. Merkelbach, Isis regina—Zeus Sarapis, 217–19, sees the exchange as positive for both participants, unlike Page, Select Papyri, 426–27, who thinks the Libyan gets the short end of the stick (he may, though, be cured in the end). But in this text only times of death are in Sarapis’s control, not changing the birthchart itself. The text does contain an interesting remark: Sarapis says he can ‘change the garments of the Moirai’ ([τὰς] μοίρας γὰρ ἐγὼ μεταμφιάζω, line 13), and specifically against their will (παρὰ δὲ μοῖρα[ν,], line 12). This, as Morenz, Egyptian Religion, 74 already noticed, has similarities with Isis conquering fate (τὸ εἱμαρμένον) (see Chapter 3, 1.3).37 In Betz, ed., GMP, 187.38 The gloss in LSJ, s.v. ἀστρικός, has this very example.39 Sarapis has been interpolated here; as we saw in Chapter 3, he is linked to the Agathos Daimon."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"204CHAPTER 6time lords. (This may be the reason for using the more inclusive word ἀστρική rather than genesis or thema in the first clause of the second passage.)Here we see active astrology at work. These passages are not about accept-ing one’s static, unchangeable fate, but about entreating the god to change the outcomes of one’s chart to make things better. This is not so much astro-logical magic as it is magical (or better, religious) astrology, relying not on human abilities to make changes, but propitiating the god for divine interven-tion and assistance. It is, actually, the antithesis of a ‘fatalistic’ astrology; the chart, and the events of the life, are not immutably cast, but are able to be ameliorated by divine action. Its outlook, which relies on the ability to petition the gods to change fate through prayer and ritual is very Egyptian (not to men-tion Babylonian), as we saw in Chapter Three.1.4 The ‘Tenth’ Book of MosesPGM XIII.734–1077, follows the just-discussed ‘Eighth Book of Moses’, and may be a ‘Tenth Book of Moses’.40 It mentions both the Agathos Daimon and astrology, and has commonalities of language with several other texts, i.e. PGM XII.201–69, PGM XXI.1–16 and PGM IV.1596–1715.41[761] Come to me, you from the four winds, ruler / of all, who blew spirit into humans for / life, whose name is hidden and not to be spoken /. . ./ [765] at whose name even the daimons, when they hear it, are terrified, whose is the sun . . .

[780] Yours are the good effluences of the stars, daimons, and Fortunes, and / Moirai, from whom wealth is given, good old age, / good children, [good] fortune, a good burial.4240 The text implies a ‘tenth’ book (line 1078) but does not supply a noun.41 Their similarities are striking; note that PGM XII and XIII (Leiden J 384 and J 395) were both found at Dios Polis (Thebes East); PGM XXI (Berlin 9566) has only Egypt as prov-enance, and PGM IV (Paris 574 is probably from Thebes (provenances at http://www .trismegistos.org/magic/search.php [searching on place and inventory no., accessed 30 April 2015]). PGM XII.238–44, 252–57 and PGM XXI.1–16 are more or less equivalent to PGM XIII.761–83. PGM IV.1596–1715, in language very similar to the others, has an invo-cation to Helios as Agathos Daimon, ‘. . . who rises from the four winds, the propitious Agathos Daimon, for whom heaven has become the place of procession’ (PGM IV.1605–09 [Preisendanz, I, 124]): ὁ ἀνατέλλων ἐκ τῶν τεσσάρων ἀνέμων, ὁ ἱλαρὸς Ἀγαθὸς Δαίμων, ᾧ οὐρανὸς ἐγένετο κωμαστήριον.).42 PGM XIII.761–6̔3, 765–66, 768–72, 780–83: (761) ‘δεῦρό μοι, ὁ ἐκ τῶν δʹ ἀνέμων, ὁ παντο/κράτωρ, ὁ ἐνφυσήσας πνεῦμα ἀνθρώποις εἰς / ζωήν, οὗ ἐστιν τὸ κρυπτὸν ὄνομα καὶ ἄρρητον/ . . . /"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":" 205Ambivalent Daimons and AstrologyIn this spell the Agathos Daimon is the lord of all43 and the Sun and Moon are his eyes.44 ‘Ordinary’ daimons are terrified at the sound of his name. Not only that, but his ‘are the good effluences of the stars: daimons, and Fortunes, and Moirai, from whom wealth is given, a good old age, good children, [good] fortune, a good burial.’45 A passage at the end of this text gives the chart con-ditions for engraving a lamella (beginning at line 1003), where an important criterion is the condition of the moon (it should be in a good phase and in aspect to benefics in their own houses).46 In this text the Agathos Daimon is represented as a god, whose powers eclipse those of ordinary daimons. Thus the line between god and daimon is blurred.1.5 The DodekaorosPGM IV.1637–95 gives a list of the Dodekaoros,47 along with the magical names for each animal. The Dodekaoros is of Egyptian origin, and assigns twelve ani-mals to each double hour as the Sun moves daily through the zodiac.48 In this (765) οὗ καὶ οἱ δαίμονες ἀκούοντες τὸ ὄνομα / πτοωῦνται, οὗ ὁ ἥλιος . . . /(768) καὶ <ἡ> σελήνη . . . /(769) ὀφθαλμοί εἰσιν ἀκάματοι, / λάμποντες ἐν ταῖς κόραις τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ᾧ /(770) οὐρανὸς κεφαλή, αἰθὴρ δὲ σῶμα, γῆ δὲ πόδες, / τὸ δὲ περὶ σ<ε> ὕδωρ* ὁ Ἀγαθὸς Δαίμων. . . .

Note that the photograph in Daniel, ed., Two Greek Magical Papyri, 65, does not show a ς.43 ‘παντοκράτωρ’. The same epithet for him appears in PGM XIV, 9. Cf. the Agathos Daimon as ruler of the cosmos in PGM XXXVI.214–19 (above, 1.2 and n. 25).44 In astrological doctrine, the Sun rules the right eye of a human, and the Moon the left eye: Valens I, 1.2, 5 (Pingree, 1.10, 20). (The right and left eyes of Horus are also the Sun and Moon.)45 PGM XIII.780–83 (Preisendanz, II, 122–23). Wealth, long life, children and a good bur-ial are exactly the favours granted to humans by the four kas, associated with various Egyptian deities, including Shai/Agathos Daimon: see S. Sauneron, ‘La conception égyp-tienne du bonheur. À propos des “Quatre Ka” (Esna 319)’, BIFAO 57 (1958): 163–64; Smith, On the Primaeval Ocean, 23–24; O. E. Kaper, The Egyptian God Tutu, 64. These commen-tators did not notice the similarity to PGM XIII.780–83 and its astrological connection (R. K. Ritner, in Betz, ed., GMP, 190, n. 117, mentions an Egyptian connection here, but not the four kas).46 PGM XIII.1027–39. These conditions are standard in astrological technique; for a katarche, the state of the moon is always important because it moves so quickly.47 Similar at PGM XXXVIII.1–26 (Betz, ed., GMP, 278–79) but missing text after the 8th hour.48 See the discussion in Chapter 5, 173. These double hours were correlated to zoidac signs, as on the Daressy Zodiac, an astrologer’s board (see below, 1.6 and 4.9). It takes on average two hours for a sign to move across the Midheaven degree; the time it takes for a sign to cross over the Ascendant is variable, based on the sign in question.

The god who deals with the inquiry, called ‘the Shai of today’,52 is summoned by a youth through Anubis. This god is ‘the one to whom these moments belong’, implying that he is lord of the day or the hour in which the entreaty is made. Katarchic charts often rely on the astrological lord of the day or hour.53 It is interesting that Shai/Agathos Daimon is invoked as the lord of the day of the ritual, since he is a god of fate, and astrology is a means for deter-mining a fate; yet the fate can be manipulated by casting a chart for the right time to achieve ‘everything which you wish’.After performing other rituals (lines 63–92; col. III, 5–35), preparations for casting such a chart are made (lines 93–114; col. IV, 1–19). The chart is prepared by the god Imhotep (Asclepius in Greek), famously associated with astrology (col. IV, 1).54 Then the god ‘speaks with you with his mouth opposite your mouth in truth concerning everything that you wish’ (col. IV, 20).55 The repetition of repr. 1974), same pagination); see 20–43.

IV, 21) and ‘pynꜤks’ 56 See the gloss of this phrase in the CDD, vol. Ꜥ, 134, s.v. Ꜥš, ‘in compounds pngs n Ꜥš wnw.t ‘.

I suggest that Ꜥš-sḥn, ‘matter’, may be the equivalent of Greek πρᾶγμα, the word used for a katarchic chart in Olympiodorus (see n. 26). I am even inclined (cautiously) to suggest that Ꜥš-sḥn in this kind of context specifically means a katarchic chart or equivalent (note that we see Greek πρᾶγμα in this context in PGM XXXVI.230 [see above, 200 and n. 25]). The initiate is requesting a chart favourable for his concerns at the time. This usage has certain similarities with the saying in the (probably late Ptolemaic, though the dating is not certain) Instruction of Ankhsheshonq, 14.17, trans-lated by Lichtheim as ‘Good fortune [Ꜥš-sḥn nfr] turns away destruction by a great god.’ (Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, vol. III, 170.) Her n. 52, p. 182, explains why she translated Ꜥš-sḥn nfr as ‘good fortune’ rather than good ‘deed’ (the usual meaning of sḥn). A good condition is able to forestall destruction. The context of our later text applies this to the katarchic chart. Both Demotic Ꜥš-sḥn and Greek πρᾶγμα have similar connotations: Ꜥš-sḥn ‘order, affair, business, matter, intent’ (CDD, vol. Ꜥ, 135, s.v. Ꜥš-sḥn) and πρᾶγμα ‘deed, act, occurrence, matter, affair’ (LSJ s.v.). The katarchic chart is seen as a positive action correlating favourable conditions in the heavens with favourable circumstances on earth.59 Packman, ‘Instructions for the Use of Planet Markers’, 85–95.

Thus Shai, as lord of the day, plays a part in the creation of a chart to fulfil the wishes of the requester.2 Daimons and Astrology in the HermeticaThe importance of both daimons and astrology to Hermetic ideas of how the world functions is starkly expressed by Garth Fowden: ‘. . . the Hermetists’ understanding of cosmic sympathy was intimately linked with their dae-monology and their astrology . . .’.61 Through the astral hierarchy of stars, Sun and planets, daimons again provide a medium of action and interaction with humans. The Hermetic texts make clear that there are both good and bad dai-mons in the world: ‘They (sc. daimons) are both good and bad in their natures, that is, their activities (energeia); for the essence of a daemon is activity. But some of them are mixtures of good and bad.’62 A sampling of the way dai-mons are incorporated with astrological theory and practice in the Hermetica will show their importance for Hermetic models, especially in the realms of incarnation and birth. We shall return to one of these texts in our discussion of the decans (as well as the use of the word energeia, seen here describing the activity of the daimon).2.1 Birth Daimons From the StarsCH XVI lays out clear links between the stars and planets, the incarnation of the soul, and the daimons who govern humans.

From moment to moment they change places, not staying in position but moving by rotation.’64Although this may refer to the decan rising at the time of birth (if a preced-ing passage of the text does refer to decans),65 it also recalls the Myth of Er and puts into an astrological framework a personal daimon connected with the Ascendant degree: this degree, as the one on the eastern horizon at the moment of birth, is the astrological analogue and marker of the moment of appearance in the material world. Such texts connect the concept of Egyptian decans to the development of the astrological ascendant.66 Evidence demonstrates that in this and other passages which refer to ‘horoscopes’ (e.g. Asclepius 19 and PGM XIII.708–14), a conflation has been made between the rising decan stars and the rising degree of the zodiac, i.e. the Ascendant.67 The rising decan is 64 XVI, 15.1–5 (Nock and Festugière, CH II, 236.18–22): γενόμενον γὰρ ἡμῶν ἕκαστον καὶ ψυχωθέντα παραλαμβάνουσι δαίμονες οἱ κατ’ ἐκείνην τὴν στιγμὴν τῆς γενέσεως ὑπηρέται, οἳ ἐτάγησαν ἑκάστῳ τῶν ἀστέρων· οὗτοι γὰρ κατὰ στιγμὴν ἐναλλάσσονται, οὐχ οἱ αὐτοὶ ἐπιμένοντες ἀλλ’ ἀνακυκλούμενοι· . . . . Trans. Copenhaver, Hermetica, 60.65 See Nock and Festugière, CH II, 240, n. 35 (cited in Copenhaver’s note, 206). The prior text which seems to refer to decans is XVI.13: ‘The sun sets in array the troop or, rather, troops of demons, which are many and changing, arrayed under the regiments of stars, an equal number of them for each star. Thus deployed, they follow the orders of a particular star . . .’. (Copenhaver’s translation, 60 [Nock and Festugière, CH II, 236]: ὑπὸ τούτῳ δὲ ἐτάγη ὁ τῶν δαιμόνων χορός, μᾶλλον δὲ χοροί· πολλοὶ γὰρ οὗτοι καὶ ποικίλοι, ὑπὸ τὰς τῶν ἀστέρων πλινθίδας τεταγμένοι, ἑκάστῳ τούτων ἰσάριθμοι. διατεταγμένοι οὖν ὑπηρετοῦσιν ἑκάστῳ τῶν ἀστέρων . . . .) But in XVI.15.1–5 the phrase ‘moment to moment’ (κατὰ στιγμὴν) suggests the quicker movement of single degrees versus the 10-degree span of a decan.66 Greenbaum and Ross, ‘The Role of Egypt in the Development of the Horoscope’.67 Ibid., 162, 165–66. Passages in Porphyry’s essay On What is Up to Us seem to use the word ‘horoscope’ in two senses (Section 42, Wachsmuth, 170–71; see also Porphyry, Porphyry: To Gaurus on How Embryos are Ensouled and On What is in Our Power, trans. and comm. James Wilberding (London: Bristol Classical Press/Gerald Duckworth and Company, 2011), 145). His first use of the word, describing ‘horoscopes’ from the Egyptians (Wachsmuth, 170.1) may in fact mean the Egyptian decans called ‘Horoscopes’. But his subsequent references to ‘horoscopes’ mean ‘the degree of the Ascendant’ (we are given a clue about this in 170.5–6, where he says ‘the horoscopic degree’). In a second passage (170.13–15) he even uses the same phrase, κατὰ στιγμὴν, used in XVI, 15.1–5, suggesting he means ‘Ascendant’ and not ‘decan’). By his time, ‘Ascendant’ would have been the com-mon meaning of ὡροσκόπος."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":" 211Ambivalent Daimons and Astrologyreplaced by the rising zodiac sign, the degree of which ‘marks the hour’.)68 Where the Ascendant falls determines where planets and luminaries are posi-tioned within the chart. If equating the Ascendant degree with a particular daimon correctly interprets this passage, then we also have a connection to the daimon and fate (heimarmenē), since the astrological term for ‘degree’ is moira (see Appendix I.A, 3.3).The passage then explains that the daimons enter only the two non-rational parts of the soul; the highest part, rational and noetic, ‘stands unmastered by the daimons, suitable as a receptacle for God.’69 The sun, though, does connect with the noetic and rational (as well as the sensible), and a hierarchy is given:The noetic cosmos, then, depends from god and the sensible cosmos from the noetic, but the sun, through the noetic cosmos and the sensible as well, is supplied by god with an influx of good. . . . Around the sun are the eight spheres that depend from it: the sphere of the fixed stars, the six of the planets, and the one that surrounds the earth. From these spheres depend the daimons, and then, from the daimons, humans. . . . The noetic essence governs heaven; heaven governs the gods [i.e. planets as gods], and daimons subjoined to the gods govern humans. This is the army of gods and daimons.70Let us explore this further for its relationship to astrology and daimons. The Sun is connected with both nous and aisthesis; we have already seen these connections in astrology (see Chapter One). There is some confusion, because the text is talking about two different manifestations of the Sun: a noetic and 68 Bouché-Leclercq, AG, 222, remarks on the term ὡροσκόποι being applied to the decan stars rising in the east, referring to what is now chart No. 95 in GH (P.

Then come the fixed stars, which contain the zodiacal constellations in which the planets dwell. These plane-tary gods are mediated by daimons, who are in charge of humans. This is, then, the cosmic order (if I may be redundant) in which astrology and daimons play a part.These daimons connect only to the two lower parts of the soul, where they can affect human desires and behaviour. When these are immoderate, they are ascribed to bad daimons who have not allied themselves with the highest divine and virtuous principles.72 Thus a lower class of daimons gets to be in charge of humans:All others [i.e., those whose noetic part is not illuminated by the divine ray of god] are led and carried off, both souls and bodies, by the daimons, because they adore the daimons’ energies and acquiesce in them. [This is a love that] misleads and is misled. And so the daimons govern this whole earthly government through the instruments of our bodies; this govern-ment Hermes has called ‘fate’.73Bodies and souls which are untouched by the noetic yearn for the activity or energy of the daimons, which is how the daimons are able to rule over the material world, a rule which is called heimarmenē.

The Emperor Julian, in his ‘Oration to the Sun’ (132c–133d) also refers to these three kosmoi and the noetic Sun which lies above the fixed stars.72 This is reminiscent of Porphyry’s description of bad daimons in De abstinentia, II, 38.4 (Nauck, 167.26–168.5); trans.

This love of bodies and souls for energeia is like the wandering planets (the verb πλανάω is telling here; is the planets’ wandering a sign of their urge for energeia?), which as part of the material world are also subject to heimarmenē.Another passage, from the Asclepius, describes the relationship of form and matter with gods, daimons and humans: ‘It is impossible for bodies to be shaped without divine assent, for forms to be figured without the assistance of daimons, and without humans, soulless things cannot be started and kept going.’74 This hierarchy mimics the heavenly one, in that the primary god gives assent to the sensible world, and the daimons provide the figuration of the forms thought by the primary god. The Latin species is the Greek εἶδος;75 the use of the verb figuro recalls figura, the astrological term for a planetary con-figuration (the Greek σχῆμα), and may obliquely suggest that the daimons, as ministers of the planetary gods and governors of the corporeal human being, have something to do with the arrangement of the planets at the time of birth. Thus we come back to the statement in XVI, 15, that daimons connected to the stars come to us at the exact moment of our birth.3 Decans and DaimonsLike the Magical Papyri and the Hermetic material, the literature on the decans is vast, and covers Egyptian astronomical and astrological delinea-tions as well as decans in Hermetic and Gnostic sources.76 (The thirty-six stars 74 Asclepius I, 5.6–9 (Nock and Festugière, CH II, 300.24–301.2): ‘Corpora enim inpossibile est conformari sine nutu divino, species figurari sine adiutorio daemonum; inanimalia insti-tui et coli sine hominibus non possunt.’ Translation Copenhaver, Hermetica, 69, slightly modified.75 As Scott, ed. and trans., Hermetica, here vol.

The two most prevalent systems of decans in Hellenistic astrology are connected both with planetary power and the daimonic power of the decan deities. As Gundel points out, they have both good and evil char-acteristics.78 In astrological circles, the Egyptian decans were often used to chart the occurrence of disease and, as shown on the Tablettes de Grand, may have played a role in the treatment of disease at a major second century CE healing site in France.79 In spite of Bouché-Leclercq’s disdain for them as an ‘excroissance parasite’, and his disparagement of them as religious supersti-tion masquerading as scientific doctrine,80 it is useful to know the religious background from which the decans spring (in addition to their astronomical and chronological functions), and that they are associated with both gods and daimons. Far from a ‘parasitic excrescence’, they are a very old, even integral part of Egyptian astral divination which gets incorporated into the doctrines and techniques of Hellenistic astrology.3.1 Origins and FeaturesThe oldest texts on the decans come from Ninth and Tenth Dynasty coffins in Asyut.81 Originally used to mark nocturnal hours, they became known as decans because different star groups rose at ten-day intervals.82 Decans in Egypt are associated with both gods and ‘daimons’, although the Egyptians themselves 77 B. L. van der Waerden, ‘Babylonian Astronomy. II. The Thirty-Six Stars’, Journal of Near Eastern Studies 8, no. 1 (1949): 6–26. But his argument of a relationship between these and Egypt’s decans is unconvincing, according to H. Hunger and D. Pingree, Astral Sciences in Mesopotamia (Leiden/Boston/Cologne: Brill, 1999), 52.78 Gundel, Dekane, 240–43.79 See J.-H.

As representatives of decan stars, sub-beings very much like daimons represent and report to superior gods.84 There are various kinds, each having similar attributes to the kinds of daimonic entities present in other Mediterranean cultures of the time. These include protective deities like Shai and Renenet (discussed in Chapter Three) as well as the fighters/slaughterers (ḫꜢty.w), emissaries (hby.w), messengers (wpwty.w) and wanderers (šmꜢy.w) (mentioned in Chapter Four, 1.2).The ‘arrows’, sheseru (šsr.w) include the group of seven decan stars closest to the sun.85 In another context, on a bracelet of Prince Hornakht from the tomb of Osorkon II, decans are associated with arrows of protection sent by gods of heaven, earth and underworld: ‘Their arrows are defending your body in life and (safe) rule’.86 Dimitri Meeks says that ‘emissary demons, arrows and Decans were identified’.87 Thus beings associated with the decans and their gods could both attack and protect, punish and guard, those with whom they came in contact. They could both cause illness and be propitiated to prevent it.88 Because the decans rise and culminate at 10-day intervals, their influence is activated at these particular periods.89 Thus the Egyptian tradition perceives these decanal beings, like daimons, as both destructive and protective.83 See Chapter 3, 2.1 and the discussion of nṯr, 97–98; Chapter 4, 1.2, 119, n. 19. Meeks, ‘Génies, Anges, Démons en Égypte’, 44, further notes that in the evolution of Egyptian gods, they become more remote and use intermediaries (both good and bad) for direct action and human contact.84 For Egyptian ideas of greater and lesser gods, see Chapter 3, 2.1, 98 and n. 93.85 Meeks, ‘Demons’, 105. Could these sheseru which guard the sun relate to the astrological concept of doryphoria, planets which guard the luminaries? Seven arrows also appear at Dendera and elsewhere: see R. Lucarelli, ‘Demonology during the Late Pharaonic and Greco-Roman Periods in Egypt’, 121–23; also, for Dendera, von Bomhard, The Naos of the Decades, 185.86 Kákosy, ‘Decans’, 164 and 165, fig. 1. Kákosy stresses the idea of the decans as protectors (165), and that the šsr.w are also guardian divinities (164 and n. 9, citing Wb IV, 547). Both these attributes align with the usual concept of daimons as protective and guardian spirits. For more on arrows and decans, see A. von Lieven, Der Himmel über Esna: eine Fallstudie zur religiösen Astronomie in Ägypten am Beispiel der kosmologischen Decken- und Architravinschriften im Tempel von Esna (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2000), 24, 52, 156.87 Meeks, ‘Demons’, 105; but Quack, ‘Dekane’, disagrees, §1.1. However, Quack does acknowl-edge that the ḫꜢty.w have a good chance of being connected to the decans (ibid., §1.1).88 Meeks, ‘Demons’, 105.89 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"216CHAPTER 63.2 Decans and Astrology in EgyptThe long tradition of Egyptian decans was applied to astrology during its development beginning in the Ptolemaic period.90 Important roles for the decans arose from this earlier tradition: decan stars were protectors and aveng-ers; and decans were associated with injury, illness and specific body parts (melothesia) in an astrological setting. Now, too, decans were tied to the zodiac and their powers activated within that milieu. These transitions were preceded by other significant developments.In the ninth century BCE, as the iconographic development of decans from godlike (human-formed) to animal and, especially, snake forms occurs,91 the decans link to gods who now oversee their functions and determine their actions at specific times. Evidence for this can be seen in the Twenty-second Dynasty tomb of the Pharaoh Osorkon II (ca. 850 BCE) where the decans change from the godlike representations in earlier periods to snake- or lion-headed deities.92 Kákosy notes the snake which appears in the midst of these gods, depicted as stretched out above the symbol for the earth, and labelled ‘Ꜥnḫw š’ (‘living ones of fate’, i.e. decans);93 the š, he suggests, stands for ‘fate’ (šꜢw).94 90 For antecedents and development of the decans in an astrological context, see Neugebauer and Parker, EAT III; Kákosy, ‘Decans’; Quack, ‘Dekane’; von Lieven, Himmel über Esna, 188–90, provides a helpful summary of the development of decans in relation to gods and stars, their functions and their place in a ‘religious astronomy’.91 Kákosy, ‘Decans’, 163–64; von Lieven, ‘Die dritte Reihe’, 22–23.92 Kákosy, ‘Decans’, 163–64; for discussion of the change, see also von Lieven, ‘Die dritte Reihe’, 22–23, who designates the snake-formed and human-formed decanal images respectively as a ‘first’ and ‘second’ series of decan iconography, and a ‘third series’, depicted with animal heads and snakes, connected closely with the zodiac and appearing on ‘magical’ gems and in iatromathematical texts.93 ‘Living one of [a god] is a common divine epithet (Wb I, 201), but ‘living ones’ of fate may also apply to the decans: see J.-C. Goyon, ‘L’origine égyptienne des tablettes décanales de Grand (Vosges), I.’ in Les tablettes astrologiques de Grand (Vosges) et l’astrologie en Gaule Romaine: actes de la Table-Ronde du 18 mars 1992 organisée au Centre d’Études Romaines et Gallo-Romaines de l’Université Lyon III, ed.

In the Ptolemaic and Greco-Roman periods decan cults expand to include connections with Isis-Sothis, Osiris, Hathor, Ptah, Amun and other prominent Egyptian gods.97 In many of these monuments stars are pictured, showing that the original connection of the decans to the constellations rising at different hours of the night over ten-day periods is never forgotten.The earliest evidence of decan stars associated with the decades (ten-day periods) is a Saite papyrus (ca. seventh-sixth c. BCE).98 Later, similar and abun-dant evidence occurs on the Naos of the Decades,99 where khatyu (fighters) and shemayu (wanderers) in particular are associated with decan stars.100 On this monument, the decan stars as servitors carry out the will of the ‘great god’ (Shu-Sopdu), causing death and carnage for Egypt’s enemies.101 A temple at ἸꜢt-nbs, where the Naos was originally sited, may have been dedicated to the khatyu.102 But even though they are involved in destruction, these decan stars do so at the behest of their god, for Egypt’s protection.103 The specific actions and effects of these decan-warriors at specific times (the decades) presage the later use of decans in astrology proper, employing the zodiac.95 See the remark of J.-H.

(This serpent motif will reappear in Chapter Ten of this book, in connection with astrological lots.) In ancient Egyptian culture, snakes repre-sent protection and fertility as well as death and destruction; like the daimons of later antiquity, their functions are ambiguous, not purely good nor evil.) So several attributes of daimons (in both Egyptian and Greek guise)—i.e. their protective, ministering functions and their links to snakes, can be found in both earlier and later representations of decan gods in Egypt.Also worth mentioning is the connection between decans, daimons and Ꜣḫw-spirits (ı ̓ḫ y in Demotic), which transformed from ‘spirits’ to ‘demons’ in Coptic, as Erik Iversen indicates.104 Some decan names incorporate the word Ꜣḫw.105 In the afterlife, the deceased becomes an akh in order to be effective, and akhu are part of a tri-partite system of soul-personality-spirit106 which includes the ba and the ka. The akh is traditionally associated with light,107 unlike the ba and ka; Iversen connects psyche and life to the ba, but the akh to light and the intellect.108 The bas are also connected to decans, so soul as well as spirit takes part in decan doctrine.109 (We can hardly avoid a comparison here with the astrological Sun/daimon and Moon/fortune: the Moon is often linked to life and the soul, while the Sun is linked to light and nous; again the astrological ties in with the religious and philosophical, both Egyptian and Greek.)104 Iversen, Egyptian and Hermetic Doctrine, 45.

The decans also link to the illness and injury of specific body parts. It may even be that zodiacal melothesia stems from this association of the decans to parts of the body, based on which sign they are in.111 Decans are used in iatromathematical texts like the ‘Sacred Book of Hermes to Asclepius’.112 Fragment 28 of Nechepso-Petosiris, as mentioned in Firmicus Maternus,113 also refers to the use of decans in astrological medicine.In the depiction of decan divinities over time, we see a progression from a more godlike characterisation to a more daimonic one; in the Late Period (shown in Kákosy’s documentation of the menits and amulets appearing at that time)114 the earlier decanic gods have metamorphosed into something akin to the way daimons are considered, as they add to their protective functions the attributes of snakes associated with daimons (as in the Ptolemaic period and later, when Shai is equated with the Agathos Daimon). We should not forget that the Egyptian term for decans from the Ptolemaic Period is bꜢk.tı ̓.w, from the word bꜢk, ‘servant’.115 The decans as daimonic entities become responsible for carrying out the wishes of the gods they represent, whether those wishes are to protect or avenge (like the šsr.w).

(See also idem, ‘Dekane’, §2.1.12 [§2.2.12 2014], which makes a few changes from the earlier article.)

These characteristics will feature in later non-Egyptian texts which portray a symbiosis of god and dai-mon associated with decan lore.3.3 God or Daimon?In Hermetic texts and in Christian writers like Origen, as well as in Jewish-Christian texts like the Testament of Solomon, gods and daimons are both featured. For example, in Contra Celsum the decans (whose origin, Celsus says, are Egyptian) are explicitly called daimons:. . . the Egyptians say that the body of man has been put under the charge of thirty-six daimons, or ethereal gods of some sort, who divide it between them, that being the number of parts into which it is divided (although some say far more). Each daimon is in charge of a different part.116Recall that daimons are described partially as ‘from aether’ (ἐξ αἰθέρος) in the Epinomis (984e3) (see Chapter One, 1.4). In CH XVI, 10 and 13, what seems clearly to be a reference to decans117 speaks of ‘many choirs of daimons like diverse military companies, living with [mortals] though not far from the immortals . . .’.118 The interesting juxtaposition of χορός, a word used meta-phorically to describe astral movement as a dance (e.g. Plotinus, Enneads, IV, 4.33), with στρατεία (= στρατία), a military cohort or company,119 emphasises the combination of daimons as astral beings with daimons as dekanoi, also a military term.120 Note also their intermediate position between gods and men, typical of daimons.In another Hermetic text the power of the astral decans is displayed. SH VI, which is devoted to ‘the thirty-six decans’ (VI, 1), says they reside between the 116 Origen, Contra Celsum, 8.58.3–6 (Borret, IV, 306.3–6): . . .

The text also says that these decans create ‘emanations’ which can either save or destroy.123 Here may be a conflation of the functions of god and daimon, where the gods hold the customary daimonic function of guarding and protecting, while the dai-mons carry out the will of the decan gods.These daimons are not exactly material, nor are they ‘moved by soul’, but are called ‘energies of these thirty-six gods’.124 The heimarmenē described in Ps.-Plutarch’s De fato is both energeia and ousia (see Chapter One, 2.1). As energeia, ‘actuality’, it is what fate does, the actions it brings about. The daimons created from the decans, then, are ‘energeiai’, actualities brought about by the decan gods; (Plotinus also talks about daimons in terms of energeia: Enneads III, 4.3). This energeia unleashed by the decans in daimonic form is responsible for col-lective ‘workings’ which include both natural and political disasters (VI, 7–9). Not for the first time, daimons and fate are connected, here by the medium of energeia. In this same text we also see the stars associated with decans which are called ‘leitourgoi’, ministers, again evoking the daimonic function of minis-tering to human beings.125Asclepius 19 provides a cosmology of both intelligible and sensible gods. The intelligible gods rule over the sensible gods, which include the ‘36 called Hour-markers, that is, the stars fixed in the same place’;126 their intelligible god, i.e. ‘lord of existence’ (ousiarchēs) is called ‘Παντόμορφον or Omniform’.127 The ‘36’ are clearly the decans described in SH VI. Pantomorphos is said to make 121 ‘Under the circle of this body [i.e. the cosmos] are placed the thirty-six decans, midway between the circle of all [and] the zodiacal circle . . .’.

These come from the Egyptian tradition, and are not the same as the gods of the decanic faces, which are planets assigned in Chaldean order to each 10-degree segment of a zodiac sign. There seem to be two traditions here, both of which become established in astrological lore.The Jewish-Christian Testament of Solomon (introduced in Chapter 4, 1.4, 132–34) shows angels and demons working together: demons controlled by archangels are compelled to help build the temple (do we thus see bad daimons making good?). The Testament also makes an overt connection between decans and daimons. In Chapter 18, Solomon calls up the demons of the decans, who explicitly cause illness. As each demon is summoned, it tells Solomon which diseases it rules over, correlated with zodiac signs,129 and how it can be banished by an archangel; so along with the assignment of each demon to an illness, we are given the name of the archangel who can dispel it. It seems clear that the association of decans/demons with illness comes from the Egyptian tradition.Numerous similarities are apparent here with the Egyptian concepts deline-ated in 3.2 above. Egyptian fingerprints mark the kind of genealogy that we see both in the SH VI, where the decan gods create daimons, and in Asclepius 19, where the god of many forms creates daimons of many forms. Conflations of Egyptian, Hermetic and astrological material affect the way the decans are represented.In the transfer of Egyptian decan lore to the practice of Hellenistic astrol-ogy, all these components are retained. The decans are associated both with divinities who are daimon-like, and with gods. An amalgamation takes place between the concept of a god who protects or avenges, and a messenger who carries out the wishes of the god. Possibly this interplay between god and daimon also accounts for the two traditions that we see in astrological decan doctrine—that of, on the one hand, decans representing Egyptian daimonic deities and, on the other hand, decans representing planets-as-gods.130128 Ibid.

There are three different systems of decans within Hellenistic astrology, two of which explicitly use gods and daimonic entities. One system employs patently Egyptian names for each decan; these appear, at this stage of historical devel-opment, to be less godly and more daimonic in their functions. This version of decans is often associated with disease and its cures. Another system assigns a planet to rule over each third of a zodiacal sign; these are called ‘faces’ (πρόσωπα in Greek, facies in Latin), and get incorporated into the dignity system as the fifth dignity in Medieval astrology. A third system, seemingly based on triplici-ties, may have been transferred to India and thence to the Arabic astrologers.132I shall discuss these systems by exploring representative texts and artefacts. I note at the outset, however, that neither Ptolemy nor Vettius Valens mentions decans, though both refer to ‘faces’ of the stars. Ptolemy’s face doctrine is differ-ent than the decanic faces described by other authors.133 Valens uses the same term, ‘in its own face’, as Ptolemy, though it is difficult to determine sometimes whether he means decanic face or Ptolemy’s definition.134 We shall begin with presumably the oldest astrological text mentioning decans, the Salmeschiniaka.Université de Louvain.

Pingree, ed., Yavanajātaka, II, 209–10, describes this system as used by the Indians.133 For Ptolemy (Tetrabiblos I, 23), a planet is ‘in its own face’ if it is in the same relation-ship to the sun or moon that its own planetary house has to the Sun’s or Moon’s house.

The Letter to Anebo names the decans in company with the ‘horoscopes’ and the ‘mighty rulers’:For Chaeremon and the others do not hold that there is anything prior to the visible worlds, placing first in order the gods of the Egyptians, and that there are no other gods except the so-called planets, and the stars that fill up the zodiac and those which co-rise with these; and both the divisions into decans and the Hour-markers, and so-called mighty leaders, whose names are also contained in the Salmeschiniaka along with their curing of diseases and their risings and settings and indica-tions of future events. 138to Mercury and the malefics being ‘in its [their] own face[s] (II, 10.2, 3; ἰδιοπροσωπέω), is followed by a reference to malefics being in ‘another’s face’ (II, 10.4; ἀλλοιοπροσωπέω), which does suggest decanic face; see also the ambiguous VII, 2.23.135 Cramer, Astrology in Roman Law and Politics, 19, n. 150; see also Gundel’s stemma in Gundel, Dekane, 92–93.

Bouché-Leclercq says that Manilius is the first to use the word decanus in relation to astrology (221).141 4.301–302: et tribuunt denas in se coeuntibus astris / inque vicem ternis habitantur sidera signis."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"226CHAPTER 6first decan of each water sign is Capricorn, while the first decan of each earth sign is Cancer).142 There is a de facto, if not intentional, employment of triplic-ities and elements here. By using this system of decans Manilius seems to be trying to account for differences in form and character (mores) which arise among people born with the same ascending sign.143 In fact, Manilius uses the word mores several times as he describes the effects of each decan (4.371, 4.375 and 4.408). He follows his description of decans by referring to the laws of fate and destiny which can be seen in decan interpretation and in the inter-pretation of single degrees (e.g. 4.378–379, 436–438). Though this is the only explicit mention of decans, Book 5 deals with paranatellonta (associated with decans by Teucer), and may thus have an unarticulated decanic component.4.3 Teucer and AntiochusTwo texts on decans are ascribed to Teucer of Babylon.144 Both mention con-stellations that co-rise with the decans (paranatellonta). One also includes co-risings of the dodekaoros with the decans (CCAG VII, 194–213). Such links, of course, betray Egyptian roots.145Teucer may be the first astrologer to use both Egyptian-style decans and decanic faces.146 The doctrine of decanic faces also appears in the Thesaurus of 142 This system has similarities with the Indian system (see n. 132) which we see in Arabic astrology (see Al-Qabīṣī, Al-Qabīṣī Introduction, 130–31, ch. 4.18): the decans in each tri-plicity take as their associates the rulers of the fifth and ninth signs from them (which is what effectively happens in Manilius). But the Arabic and Indian versions use planets, not signs, as rulers.143 This is akin in flavour to Porphyry’s astrological version of incarnation in What is Up to Us, attempting to account for variations in character by varying the astrological possibilities.144 Text I: Boll, Sphaera, 16–21; W.

Like Manilius, it seems Teucer, via Antiochus/Rhetorius, is trying to account astrologically, via the decans, for differences in character and life experiences.These early (relatively speaking) texts linking character to the decans, espe-cially the rising decans with the Ascendant degree, again suggest a foundation for the Ascendant, a.k.a. hōroskopos, in the rising decan which represents a particular style of character. The Ascendant and first place are traditionally important in astrology for determining character and temperament (e.g., see Ptolemy, Tetrabiblos, III, 11).4.4 Anubio and Julius Firmicus MaternusDecans are called ‘hour-regulators’ (ὡρονόμοι) as well as λειτουργοί in Anubio, the (probably) late first century CE elegiac poet and astrologer.149 These terms match those in Hermetic texts. I present Anubio with Firmicus because he quotes Anubio on decans in II, 4.1 (the division of each sign into three decans which control it) and II, 4.4–5 (the further division of each decan into three 147 CCAG I, 149–50 refers to the same text as chapter 47 of Porphyry’s Introduction to the Tetrabiblos. (Part of this is also quoted in Scholion 9 to Paulus [Boer, 104–05]; see below 4.5, 229 and n. 157.)148 CCAG I, 150–51. An example, CCAG I, 151.3–6: ‘One who is born in the 1st decan of Sagittarius will not take care in [choosing] a wife and will be distressed about his children; in the 2nd [decan] he will live a painless life, except he will end it among foreigners; in the 3rd it makes those who are rich and esteemed, and he will receive an inheritance from a woman.’ Δεκανῷ αʹ Τοξότου ὁ γεννηθεὶς οὐκ ἐπιτηδεύσει ἐν γυναιξὶ καὶ ἐπὶ τέκνοις λυπηθήσεται· ἐν δὲ τῷ βʹ ἄλυπον βίον ζήσεται, πλὴν ἐπὶ ξένοις τελευτήσει· ἐν δὲ τῷ γʹ πλουσίους καὶ ἐνδόξους ποιεῖ καὶ κληρονομίαν λήψεται ἐκ γυναικός.149 Frs 1 and 2 (Obbink, 23–25). I use Obbink’s English term, ‘hour-regulator’. The same in Anubio, Anoubion, Elegiacs, ed. and trans. Dirk Obbink (London: Egypt Exploration Society, 1999), here 75 [Front fr. 2]); see also R. Beck, ‘Review: Dirk Obbink (ed.), Anubio, Carmen astrologicum elegiacum’, Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2007.9.28 (2007), http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2007/2007-09-28. html. In fact, in direct quotation Anubio does not even use forms of ὡροσκόπος, only forms of ὡρονόμος. We find this same term used consistently for the Ascendant in Manetho the astrologer, e.g. I, 30, 58, 262, 339, 347; the Greek fragments of Dorotheus as well favour this term. Since all these authors are 1st or early 2nd century CE, perhaps this usage reflects the transition of decans which ‘regulate’ hours to Ascendants which ‘mark’ them.

There is no interpretation in Book II, but in IV, 22 he tackles the thorny subject of full and empty degrees as applied to the decans within signs.151 These are important for astrological medicine, a significant piece of decanic doctrine, as we have seen. Here he deals with the Egyptian decans which have the ability to cause and cure disease (a power not given to the decanic faces, or at least not mentioned by Firmicus). Firmicus tells us that ‘the decans themselves are possessed of great divine assent (numen) and power, and through them all prosperity and all misfortune are decreed’ (IV, 22.2).152 This is a strong statement, and Firmicus goes on to explain that, according to Nechepso, the decans predict illness and, in knowing how the decans work, cures can be found.153 But the numen of the decans does not extend to every degree, requiring a list of each sign with its full and empty degrees. Better outcomes occur for those with more planets and the Ascendant in full degrees. As Firmicus interprets them, the full degrees provide vitality and prosperity, while the empty degrees do not. Specific illnesses are not men-tioned. Unlike Manilius, Firmicus’s focus is on the decans’ ability to give health or illness, as well as happiness and depression, not as predictors of character.The use of the word numen here is interesting, because this word links with both gods and daimons. Herbert Rose associates numen with activity (i.e. ener-geia),154 even though he is speaking of the earliest connotations of numen and daimons; as we have seen earlier, this is an attribute also of daimons in the Hermetic and magical texts. Rose also discusses potestas, an analogue of δύναμις, as something possessed by daimons. I am not suggesting that Classical Greek and Roman conceptions of daimonic power as described by Rose are strictly applicable in late antiquity to what Firmicus says, but I do want to stress that the power described here can be both godly and daimonic. In the 150 For an analysis of Firmicus’s use of the decans, and comparisons with other texts, see Abry, ‘Les décans chez Firmicus Maternus’, 197–228.151 For full and empty degrees associated with Egyptian decans, see Leitz, Altägyptische Sternuhren, 47–49; Quack, ‘Dekane’, §2.2.8 (§2.3.8 2014).152 (KSZ I, 264.24–26 = Monat, II, 202): . . . sunt autem decani ipsi magni numinis et potestatis et per ipsos omnia prospera et omnia infortunia decernuntur.153 IV, 22.2 (KSZ I, 265.1–8 = Monat, II, 202).154 H.

They are properties of both gods and daimons.4.5 Paulus AlexandrinusPaulus makes no mention of the Egyptian-style decans, but only decanic faces. However, he does make an interesting comment on how the faces come about: ‘As for the faces of the seven stars from the decanic shaping by zodiac sign, in which they rejoice as if in their own dwelling places, it will be neces-sary to arrange them in order according to the seven-zone system . . .’.156 This seems to imply that the faces have arisen out of the decans, and are a later addition to decan doctrine.1574.6 Hephaestio of ThebesBook I of the Apotelesmatika contains long descriptions and delineations of the Egyptian decans. Faces are not mentioned. Hephaestio describes the three decans for each sign, giving clearly Egyptian-derived names. He explicitly states that their delineations apply to the decan rising at birth (e.g. ‘the first decan marking the hour’158), thus linking the importance of the Ascendant with its associated decan. The delineations cover physical appearance, happiness and grief during life, character descriptions and whether the circumstances at death are good or bad. Critical years are also given for the decan rising in the sign. Hephaestio occasionally refers to a decan as a god. We find in Hephaestio the longest and most detailed descriptions of the actions of decans by any Hellenistic astrologer.155 Ibid., 247: ‘. . . we must remember two things. One is that a god, who is certainly a personal being, is often called a δαίμων, and the gods in general δαίμονες, suggesting that to Homer the word did not mean an impersonal power but rather one either undefined by him or impossible to be defined by anyone; which is very different from saying that it is by nature indefinite.’156 My italics.

The last sentence of the scholion refers to the decans themselves and their paranatellonta.158 Hephaestio I, 1.13 (Pingree, 1, 5.14–15): . . . τοὺς μὲν ἔχοντας ὡροσκοποῦντα τὸν πρῶτον δεκανὸν . . . , et sim."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"230CHAPTER 6In Book II, 18, where Hephaestio describes the writings of Antigonus of Nicaea, complete with example charts, he refers to the Salmeschoiniaka and its contents on decans:And collecting material from books of the Salmeschoiniaka, he [Antigonus] speaks, as it is there, in this way: one must also observe the decans, since the first, that of the Hour-marker,159 is operative for childbirth, but the 28th decan from it, which culminates in the forenoon, is operative for manner of living; but the 25th, which culminates at midday, is operative for bad health; but the 9th, which rises late in the east wind, is operative for inju-ries; but the 17th, which rises in the west wind, is operative for marriage and wives; but the 8th, door of Hades, is operative for children, and the one in the Underground is operative for death. These are the places which the ancient Egyptians use for every nativity. Therefore let so many be set out for soul, and manner of living, and prosperity. . . .160Again, the decans correlate with life events rather than specifically with illness. But even though they are somewhat correlated to the astrological places, the decans here are described mostly in terms of their rising, culminating and set-ting; in other words, temporally and in terms of the daily cycle, rather than zodi-acal placement.161 This evidence again supports Egyptian influence on their use in astrology. The Egyptian connection is further cemented by the reference to winds in which the decans rise: for example, the decans are moved by Shu, god of air and winds, on the Naos of the Decades.162 The events connected to the decanal places are somewhat unorthodox. Some do correspond generally to their later astrological place, e.g. the ‘west’ for marriage and wives = the sev-enth place, and the Underground = death. But perhaps the decans as described 159 Epitome IV, 26.65 (Pingree, 2, 233.5), has ὁ μὲν αʹ ὡροσκοπῶν instead of ὁ μὲν πρῶτος τοῦ ὡροσκόπου, so the sense intended may be ‘the first decan marking the hour’, emphasising the decan rather than the rising degree (the Ascendant).160 II, 18.74–77 (Pingree, 1, 167.1–13): Καὶ ἐκ τῶν Σαλμεσχοινιακῶν δὲ βιβλίων ἀναλεξάμενος ὡς ἔστιν ἐκεῖ οὕτως λέγει. σκοπητέον δὲ καὶ τοὺς δεκανοὺς ἐπειδήπερ ὁ μὲν πρῶτος τοῦ ὡροσκόπου χρηματίζει περὶ τοκετοῦ, ὁ δὲ ἀπὸ τούτου δεκανὸς κηʹ, ὃς μεσουρανεῖ πρωΐ, χρηματίζει περὶ βίου, ὁ δὲ κεʹ, ὃς μεσουρανεῖ μεσημβρίαν, χρηματίζει περὶ ἀρρωστίας, ὁ δὲ <ι>θʹ, ὃς ἀνατέλλει ἐν τῷ ἀπηλιώτῃ ὀψέ, χρηματίζει περὶ σίνους, ὁ δὲ ιζʹ, ὃς ἀνατέλλει ἐν τοῖς λιβυκοῖς, χρηματίζει περὶ γάμου καὶ γυναικῶν, ὁ δὲ ηʹ, Ἅιδου θύρα, χρηματίζει περὶ τέκνων, ὁ δὲ ἐν τῷ ὑπὸ γῆν χρηματίζει περὶ θανάτου. οὗτοί εἰσιν οἱ τόποι οἷς χρῶνται ἐπὶ πάσης γενέσεως οἱ παλαιοὶ Αἰγύπτιοι. τοσαῦτα μὲν οὖν ἐκκείσθω περὶ ψυχῆς καὶ βίου καὶ προκοπῆς . . . .161 Pingree, Yavanajātaka, II, 219, suggests a connection of the decans with ages of life, but I do not see a strong connection with them in this passage.162 Bomhard, Naos of the Decades, 39–42, 95."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":" 231Ambivalent Daimons and Astrologyhere were not meant to be correlated to standard astrological places; they are remnants of an earlier Egyptian system which assigned these particular life events to the decans as they rose, culminated, set and anti-culminated. This would account for the insertion of winds. Wilhelm Gundel links this passage to another text of the Arabic era where each decan is linked, not to a third of a zodiac sign, but to a third (ten degrees) of a place.163 But this text is differ-ent from Hephaestio’s description of the Salmeschiniaka’s contents, in that it appears to be a conflation of traditional place characteristics with the decans, ascribing to each of the three decans in the place one of the place’s attributes. For example: ‘The first decan of the 11th place signifies friends, the 2nd good fortune, the third hope and children.’164 To my knowledge this technique does not appear in Hellenistic astrological authors.4.7 The Liber HermetisIn the Liber Hermetis we find Egyptian decans combined with faces, not sep-arated in different books as in Firmicus. Since much of the Liber Hermetis is a compilation of various authors and techniques, this is not surprising. But the Liber Hermetis is exceptional among Hellenistic texts in the way it describes the decans and faces.165 To take just one example:On the second face of Aries. The second decan has the face of the Sun. His name is Sabaoth, and he has a two-headed face and a lotus of the kings open on his head. Circling around the lotus are stars with the splen-dor of gold. He also holds a water jug which is called life in his right hand, in his left a scepter, the end of which is split in two. The decan himself is clothed in linen and under both feet he treads on a tortoise totally cov-ered with a net. He rules over the region of the Bactrians.166163 Gundel, Dekane, 410, did not identify its Arabic origin. He gives a German translation (but no Greek). The text, in the 14th century manuscript Vat. gr. 1056, fols 194–221, here 219v–220, is a Greek version of the Mudhākarāt of Shādhān, a student of Abū Ma‘shar (see D. Pingree, ‘Classical and Byzantine Astrology in Sassanian Persia’, DOP 43 (1989): 227–39, here 227, n. 2). Pingree prepared an edition of this text, but it is unpublished.

In Hephaestio, the second decan of Aries is called Chontachre, and in Firmicus Senacher, relating to the original Egyptian. But the Liber Hermetis falls back on a Gnostic name, Sabaoth (which is usually linked to Mars, not the Sun), though references to the lotus and linen show its Egyptian roots. It is interesting that the Liber Hermetis descriptions do not give any delineation relevant to a person who has that decan rising at birth, but merely describe the decan deity. Though Chapter 1 is devoted to the decans, they are otherwise mentioned only in Chapter 16, which lists them as part of the considerations before judgement (these also occur in Rhetorius).167 Here a distinction is made between the decans in relation to planets and co-rising fixed stars (according to Teucer) and the decanic faces and bright degrees of the signs.168 By this time the two decanic doctrines were well-separated, and both were used in interpretation.4.8 Decans in Cosmas of JerusalemCosmas, an eighth-century bishop and hymn-writer, ascribes the hierarchy of gods and daimons in astrology to the Zoroastrians (‘Zarathustra’).169 He writes of the ‘36 airs’ into which the zodiacal circle is divided, clearly a reference to decans.In circuitu quidem loti sunt stellae splendoris auri; tenet etiam in dextra hydriam, quae vocatur vita, in sinistra vero sceptrum, in cuius extremitate stat ancipiter. Decanus vero ipse est linteis indutus et sub utrisque pedibus calcat testudinem totam indutam rete.

This is put slightly differently in Rhetorius (CCAG VIII/4, 124.14–17): καθ’ ἑκάστην γένεσιν δέον ζητεῖν καὶ τὰ ἀποτελέσματα τῶν δεκανῶν πρὸς τοὺς ἀστέρας καὶ τοὺς παρανατέλλοντας καὶ τὰ πρόσωπα τῶν δεκανῶν καὶ τὴν λαμπρομοιρίαν τῶν ζῳδίων. ‘For each nativity one must also seek the outcomes of the decans in relation to the stars and those [constellations] co-rising [with them], and the faces of the decans and the degree-brightness of the zodiac signs.’ Is this a remnant of decans as ‘bright horoscopes’?169 CCAG VIII/3, 120.

In any case, it is another link between daimons and planets.This passage, late in the annals of Hellenistic astrology, may express a later conflation of Egyptian, Greek and Zoroastrian components, or may just show Cosmas’s confusion about astrological practices. In any case, this gar-bled conflation can show us the seeds both of gods and daimons in decans, as well as the different streams from Egypt, Greece and Persia which flow into Hellenistic astrology.4.9 Practical ApplicationsVery few extant charts contain calculations of decans. Six charts from Oxyrhynchus list the decans of some planetary positions, in the format ‘1st decan’, ‘2nd decan’, etc. The decans in all cases are listed last, and not identi-fied by either decanic face or Egyptian name.173 In Greek Horoscopes, only two charts mention decans. The first, No. 81,174 gives decans, with their Egyptian names,175 only for the Sun, Moon and Ascendant, perhaps emphasising the importance of these three positions. No. 95176 has strong Egyptian connec-tions (it includes some Demotic signs177 and a section in Old Coptic). It is, as Joachim Quack has explained, problematic in its use of the decans.178 It gives two kinds of decan names (both Egyptian; decanic faces are not mentioned) for the planets and Ascendant: one is called one of the 36 ‘bright horoscopes’, and the other a ‘decan’.179 These appear to come from two different systems of 173 A.

Four of the seven existing astrological boards depict decans: the Tabula Bianchini, a glass disc from the Kharga Oasis and the Tablettes de Grand (two).182 In addition, a literary reference to an astrological board also mentions decans.183 Thus the decans (and their daimons) persist in an iconography that we can see today as an enduring reminder of their power in antiquity.180 Quack, ‘Dekane’, §2.1.14 (§2.2.14 2014), thinks Seti I B was used for the bright horo-scopes, and Tanis for the decans. Neugebauer and Parker, EAT III, 174, think the bright horoscopes are probably Seti I C.181 A thorough study of this chart would be a useful exercise, but cannot be attempted in this chapter.182 Evans, ‘Astrologer’s Apparatus’, discusses the Tabula Bianchini, Tablettes de Grand, Daressy Table and Tanis Zodiac. The Tablettes de Grand (two mostly identical ivory pinakes) have been well-covered in Abry, ed., Les tablettes astrologiques de Grand.

Nenna, ‘De Douch (oasis de Kharga) à Grand (Vosges): un disque en verre peint à représentations astrologiques’, BIFAO 103 (2003): 355–75. The Daressy Table (now lost) did not depict decans. The Tanis and Nakovana Zodiacs are too fragmentary to know if decans were pictured: see, respectively, EAT III, 102–03 and Pl. 47C; and S. Forenbaher and A.

Building upon ideas drawn from Plato (especially the Myth of Er), Porphyry relates this personal daimon to the astrological technique of finding an oikodespotēs, or house-master, of the birthchart. The planet designated as the oikodespotēs of the nativity imparts the spirit of the personal daimon (usually called οἰκεῖος δαίμων or ἴδιος δαίμων)3 which goes with the soul when it becomes attached to a body at birth. In his Letter to Anebo (14a–d, 15a–b),4 Porphyry takes up the idea of finding the oikodespotēs of the nativity in order to ascertain a personal daimon. He gives instructions for finding it astrologically in his Introduction to the Tetrabiblos (Chapter 30).This chapter will examine these topics in detail, as well as looking at the ways selected Neo-Platonists dealt with the daimon, and at astrological writings 1 Liber de vita coelitus comparanda, 23.27–29 (Kaske and Clark, 370.27–28, 372.29). ‘Proinde operae pretium fuerit indagare, ad quam potissimum regionem habitandam et excolendam te tuum sidus daemonque tuus ab initio designaverit, ibi enim magis aspirant.’2 Εἰσαγωγὴ εἰς τὴν Ἀποτελεσματικὴν τοῦ Πτολεμαίου, edited by Emilie Boer and Stefan Weinstock in CCAG V/4, 185–228.

It begins by exploring the views of two representative Neo-Platonists, Plotinus and Iamblichus, on the personal daimon and astrology.5 The focus will then turn to Porphyry’s views on the oikodespotēs and the per-sonal daimon.1 Neo-Platonism and the Personal DaimonDaimons are an important consideration in Neo-Platonism. In addition to interest in a personal daimon, the Neo-Platonists also acknowledge and try to deal with both good and bad daimons. Iamblichus insists that only a good daimon can be one’s personal daimon,6 but Neo-Platonists also recognize that bad daimons exist in the world and cause misery.7 Astrology is also discussed by several Neo-Platonists (including Plotinus, Porphyry and Iamblichus), including its role in fate, free will and choice.8 In Porphyry especially, these discussions also involve the personal daimon.Modern scholars generally mark the beginning of Neo-Platonism with Plotinus.9 However, the ideas of Platonism develop along a continuum, so this designation is more chronological than philosophical (and, of course, unknown in antiquity). Conceptions of the daimon in Neo-Platonism come out of those in Middle Platonism, perhaps best exemplified by Plutarch, as we saw in Chapter One, and in Apuleius and other Middle Platonists like Numenius.5 Timotin, Démonologie, 309–14, discusses the personal daimon and astrology in a Neo-Platonic context, from a more philosophical and less astrological viewpoint than I shall use. His discussion thus complements mine.6 DM IX.7 (Clarke/Dillon/Hershbell, 282.2–4). The idea that a personal daimon is only good appears in Menander, fr. 714 (cited in Luck, Arcana Mundi, 172).7 See Porphyry, De abstinentia 2, 38.4, 39.3, 40.1–4, etc.8 Other Neo-Platonists who discuss astrology include Proclus, Olympiodorus, Simplicius and Hierocles: see M.

For Plotinus, the emphasis on solely physical cau-sation is problematic (Ennead II, 3),12 while for Iamblichus the faulty inter-pretations of astrologers give him pause (DM IX.4).13 In addition, discussions of free will often use astrology as a whipping boy for fatalism (confused with determinism, even today), including popular notions that astrology mandates an unalterable fate and that the stars are not only causes, but allies and ena-blers, of heimarmenē and anankē.14 With regard to the daimon and astrology, Porphyry seems most interested in reconciling concepts of daimon with astro-logical practice, including techniques for finding a representative personal daimon in the birthchart (see section 3 of this chapter). But let us begin with Plotinus and his thoughts about daimons and astrology. Porphyry was the student of Plotinus, and Iamblichus may have been taught by Porphyry (but differed from him in many respects, not the least being the importance of the-urgy). This lineage has a bearing on the integration of the daimon into the astrological practice of Neo-Platonists.1.1 PlotinusIn his Life of Plotinus, Porphyry recounts how the personal daimon of Plotinus was discovered to be not a mere daimon, but a god. An Egyptian who had come to Rome offered to invoke Plotinus’s ‘personal daimon’ (οἰκεῖος δαίμων), but a 10 For a substantial discussion of the daimon in Neo-Platonism, see Timotin, Démonologie, 141–61.11 See the discussion of J.

Wolfgang Haase (Berlin/New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1987), 862–909, here 900–02.12 Though not all astrologers would subscribe to this view. Ptolemy is the main proponent of physical causation.13 Blaming the technique and interpretive skills of astrologers has a long history, even (or perhaps especially) among astrologers themselves. See the discussion of Clarke, Iamblichus’ De mysteriis: A manifesto of the miraculous, 30, concerning the contamination of prediction by human fallibility.14 Seen in Hermetic texts, but also used by opponents of astrology such as Sextus Empiricus, though less in the works of actual astrologers, who tend to be more nuanced in their assessments of fate and necessity (see, e.g. Ptolemy and Vettius Valens, though both have very different views of astrology and its connection to fate)."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Porphyry, The Oikodespotēs And The Personal Daimon 239god appeared instead (Vita Plotini 10.14–33).15 This event was supposedly the impetus for Plotinus’s discussion of the personal daimon in Ennead III, 4.16Plotinus views astrology as something that can be semiotic but not neces-sarily causal.17 If some astral connection and responsibility in human lives is admitted, as in the Myth of Er, this provides a reason for astrology, and astrol-ogy must be (partly) bound up in fate and providence. Plotinus follows the basic idea of the Myth of Er (II, 3.9.1–14; 3.15.1–5).18 Souls come to birth choos-ing their lives, but affected by the planetary circumstances in which they are born. Plotinus says that the universe is a mixture of God and daimon, and the passions (τὰ πάθη) are the daimonic part: ‘And so [the All] is a God when that [highest divine soul] is counted in with it, but the rest, he [i.e. Plato] says, is a great Daimon,19 and the passions in it are daimonic.’2015 Plotinus, Opera, eds Paul Henry and Hans-Rudolf Schwyzer, 3 vols (Leiden: Brill, 1951–1973), here vol. 1 (Vita Plotini), 16–17.

For more on how Plotinus viewed astrology, see four analyses that approach it from different perspec-tives: J. Dillon, ‘Plotinus on Whether the Stars are Causes’, Res Orientales 12 (La Science des Cieux. Sages, mages, astrologues) (1999): 87–92; M. Lawrence, ‘Who Thought the Stars are Causes?

Plotinus focuses on σημαίνειν versus ποιεῖν and the philosophical differences between them. But Lawrence is right to point out (29) that astrological treatises often interchangeably (and apparently without considering philo-sophical implications) use ‘σημαίνει’ and ‘ποίει’ when they talk about effects arising from astrological configurations. The practice is widespread (cf. Valens, Paulus, Olympiodorus, Hephaestio). Even today, modern astrologers speak as if the planets ‘do’ things to people, though many do not actually think there is a mechanism or physical influence by which astrological configurations correlate with human events.18 For more on the Myth of Er, daimon and astrology, see Chapter 8, 1.1 (‘The Daimon and the Lot’), 282–85.19 Meaning Eros, the ‘great daimon’ of Symposium 202d.20 II, 3.9.46–47 (Henry/Schwyzer): Θεὸς μὲν οὖν ἐκείνης συναριθμουμένης, τὸ δὲ λοιπὸν δαίμων, φησί, μέγας καὶ τὰ πάθη τὰ ἐν αὐτῷ δαιμόνια.

When he says, about the soul approaching its coming into birth, that ‘some-thing comes to it’ (ἥκειν τι) (II, 3.10.4),22 something that is subject to passions23 (τι παθητικὸν ἔχουσα) (3.10.5–6), what could he mean? Peter Adamson sug-gests that ‘the soul acquires its passive part as it descends’,24 and Plotinus has already said that the heavenly gods provide the soul with ‘the terrible and nec-essary passions’.25 In the essay On What is Up to Us, Porphyry speaks of the seven spheres the souls pass through, each inciting it with different desires.26 says, is a “great daemon” and what happens in it is daemonic.’ McKenna translates ‘and its ways are subdivine’. Neither, in my opinion, conveys the message that passions are linked to daimons, which is what I think Plotinus is saying.21 II, 3.9.10–11 (Henry/Schwyzer): Οὗτοι γὰρ οἱ λόγοι συνδέουσιν ἡμᾶς τοῖς ἄστροις παρ’ αὐτῶν ψυχὴν κομιζομένους. . . .

These passions, says Plotinus, come from the gods-as-planets (II, 3.9.6–10, Henry/Schwyzer). (The astrological Sun and Moon are both associated with the soul.)22 Trans. Adamson, ‘Plotinus on Astrology’, 288.23 I use the translation ‘passions’, but no one English word adequately expresses the Greek sense of pathē; neither passions, affections, emotions, passivity, suffering nor even experience.24 Adamson, ‘Plotinus on Astrology’, 287–88, n. 44 (in the note he mentions the entire pas-sage from which this comes, and the difficulty in interpreting it).25 II, 3.9.7–8: τὰ δεινὰ καὶ ἀναγκαῖα πάθη (Henry-Schwyzer).26 Porphyry, ‘Περὶ τοῦ ἐφ’ ἡμῖν’ (Smith, 305.68–71 [P.37, 271F] ≈ Wachsmuth, II, 171.1–5): . . . τοῦ <δὲ> πρώτου βίου ἡ διέξοδος διὰ τῶν ἑπτὰ σφαιρῶν γιγνομένη, ἄλλως ἄλλης κατ’ αὐτὰς κινουμένης κατὰ τὰς προθυμίας πρός τινας τῶν δευτέρων βίων. . . . ‘When the [soul’s] pas-sage through the seven spheres of the first type of life happens, another passage down them incites [the soul] differently, according to the desires it has for certain of the sec-ond lives . . .’.

The connection between daimons and passions is well known;28 being subject to passions is a condition of being human. The daimon, nevertheless, is both the bearer of passions and the guide toward the attainment of virtue. When the soul incarnates, it brings its daimonic guide with it (as the Myth of Er says). Iamblichus, furthermore, says as much when he tells us:chaque sphère imprime en l’âme des désirs différents qui influeront sur son choix de telle ou telle deuxième vie. . . .’ He thus suggests that both passages are downward.

He has also, I think, misunderstood Festugière’s position on the stages of ‘first’ and ‘second’ lives the soul passes through on its way to incarnation. I do not believe, as Smith suggests, that Festugière understood the first and second lives (bioi) as distinct from one another, but as stages of choice for the soul in becoming incarnated into one eventual life which has two components. See Festugière, 349, nn. 1 and 2, and Festugière’s translation, 354, of 169.15–20, ‘types d’existence de premier ordre et des types de second ordre.’ (Perhaps we could apply the ‘first’ and ‘second’ lives to the moment of conception and the moment of birth.).27 Macrobius, Commentary on the Dream of Scipio, I, 12.14 (Willis, II, 50): ‘in Saturni rati-ocinationem et intellegentiam, quod λογιστικόν et θεωρητικόν vocant: in Iovis vim agendi, quod πρακτικόν dicitur: in Martis animositatis ardorem, quod θυμικόν nuncupatur: in solis sentiendi opinandique naturam, quod αἰσθητικόν et φανταστικόν appellant; desiderii vero motum, quod ἐπιθυμητικόν vocatur, in Veneris: pronuntiandi et interpretandi quae sen-tiat quod ἑρμηνευτικόν dicitur in orbe Mercurii: φυτικόν vero, id est naturam plantandi et augendi corpora, in ingressu globi lunaris exercet.’ ‘In the sphere of Saturn it obtains reason and understanding, called logistikon and theoretikon; in Jupiter’s sphere, the power to act, called praktikon; in Mars’ sphere, a bold spirit or thymikon; in the sun’s sphere, sense-perception and imagination, aisthetikon and phantastikon; in Venus’ sphere, the impulse of passion, epithymetikon, in Mercury’s sphere, the ability to speak and interpret, hermeneutikon; and in the lunar sphere, the function of molding and increasing bod-ies, phytikon.’ (Trans.

This daimon, then, stands as a model for us even before the souls descend into generation.29We see the lineage of the idea of a personal daimon accompanying the soul into generation deriving from Plato and moving from Plotinus through Porphyry to Iamblichus. Natal astrology becomes a part of this system, since it is already predicated on the moment of birth (and tries to find the moment of concep-tion: the moment of incarnation). Astrology is logically associated with a sys-tem like Plato’s that ties fate and the daimon into incarnation.30Plotinus’s early treatise on the personal daimon (Ennead III, 4, number 15 in the chronological order of the Ennead treatises) was, as Armstrong’s introduction says, ‘written . . . before Porphyry came to Rome’.31 Plotinus’s goal is to reconcile the various treatments of the daimon in Plato (Republic, Timaeus, Phaedrus, Phaedo, Theaetetus). He sees the personal daimon as a guiding spirit who is hierarchically above the level at which a human life is being lived (III, 4.3.6–20, esp. 18–20), serving both as guide and as aspiration.32 Furthermore, he connects this guiding daimon with the stars and planets, following the idea of the Timaeus that each soul has its own star.33 29 DM IX.6, 280.1–8 (Des Places, trans. Clarke/Dillon/Hershbell): Εἰ δὲ δεῖ σοι τὸν ἀληθῆ περὶ τοῦ οἰκείου δαίμονος λόγον ἀποκαλύψαι, οὐκ ἀφ’ ἑνὸς μέρους τῶν ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ οὐδ’ ἀπό τινος στοιχείου τῶν ὁρωμένων ἀπονέμεται ἡμῖν οὗτος, ἀφ’ ὅλου δὲ τοῦ κόσμου καὶ τῆς παντοδαπῆς ἐν αὐτῷ ζωῆς καὶ τοῦ παντοδαποῦ σώματος, δι’ ὧν ἡ ψυχὴ κάτεισιν ἐπὶ τὴν γένεσιν, ἀπομερίζεταί τις ἡμῖν μοῖρα ἰδία πρὸς ἕκαστον τῶν ἐν ἡμῖν ἀπομεριζομένη κατ’ ἰδίαν ἐπιστασίαν. Οὗτος δὴ οὖν ὁ δαίμων ἕστηκεν ἐν παραδείγματι πρὸ τοῦ καὶ τὰς ψυχὰς κατιέναι εἰς γένεσιν·.30 And it is logical for Porphyry, as a student of Plotinus and following the Platonist line, to seek the personal daimon in the astrological chart. The two, daimon and soul, are inter-twined before birth, so why not at the moment of birth, which the birthchart shows in its arrangement of planets and zodiacal signs?31 Armstrong, Plotinus Ennead III, 140. Armstrong also cites Dodds, Greeks and the Irrational, 289–91.32 See Armstrong, Plotinus Ennead III, 140–41. For additional views, see Timotin, Démonologie, 299–300 and n. 212.33 Timaeus 41d–e.

Nature, called ‘a spindle’ (Republic X.616c), puts the soul with its daimon ‘in some seat of fortune’, likened to a particular ship the soul inhabits during the human’s life.36 The events of the life are moved by the circuit of heaven and its winds, and the human responds both to the tossing of the ship and his own impulses or desires. Plotinus makes allowances for individual and particular reactions to life events by saying. . . he is on the ship precisely in his own way. For everyone is not moved and does not will or act alike in the same circumstances. So different things happen to different people as a result of the same or different occurrences, or the same things to others even if the circumstances they encounter are different; for that is what heimarmenē is like.37(By asking if these are less than daimons, Plotinus implies that bad daimons fall into a dif-ferent category than good ones.) I think Plotinus uses the adjective ‘θήρεια’ to apply only to animals, and not to a human of ‘bestial’ character, thus giving bad daimons only to the souls of animals and leaving good daimons to humans. This seems to interpret Timaeus 42c, where those who have lived wicked lives reincarnate as animals. Plotinus also men-tions a wicked man entering into a ‘bestial life’, βίον θήρειον (i.e. the life of an animal), in III, 4.3.16–17 (Henry/Schwyzer).34 III, 4.6.27–29 (Henry/Schwyzer, trans.

But perhaps the soul can choose the same ‘principle’ again and have the same daimon, as in this later example.36 III, 4.6.47–50 (Henry/Schwyzer): Ἐπιβαίνει οὖν μετὰ τούτου τοῦ δαίμονος ὥσπερ σκάφους τοῦδε τοῦ παντὸς πρῶτον, εἶτα παραλαβοῦσα ἡ τοῦ ἀτράκτου λεγομένη φύσις κατέταξεν ὥσπερ ἐν νηὶ εἴς τινα ἕδραν τύχης.

The soul, having been placed in a particular configuration and ‘circuit of heaven’ (περιφορά, the paths of the planets revolving around the spindle in the Myth of Er), is buffeted by the winds of that heavenly circuit. It is not much of a stretch to envision this begin-ning with the configuration of planets in the heavens at the time of birth. The rôle we are given is analogous to the astrological configuration at birth, but how we play it depends on us. Moreover, Plotinus says twice in this treatise38 that we are each ‘an intelligible cosmos’ connecting upper and lower worlds by means of the soul;39 since the planets are seen as representatives of divine intelligence, again it is not a stretch to consider that the astrological chart shows the placement of these divine intelligences in our personal universe. Plotinus has specifically mentioned the spindle, the fates and the ‘circuit of heaven’ (II, 3.9). He accepts the idea of souls wedded to the gods of the heav-ens: God gives humans soul, but the ‘gods borne through the heavens’ (i.e. the planets) give them passions. But we also have our chosen daimon, and the abil-ity to control our passions, our reactions to events.The reaction to the events created by the movement of the metaphorical ship of III, 4.6 is partly based on human choice, which is why the same cir-cumstances affect different people differently, or why different circumstances may produce the same reactions in people. There are parallels to this kind of thinking in Vettius Valens (VII, 6.127–160). Coincidentally employing the theme of ships and their passengers,40 this section concerns six survivors of a near-shipwreck, one of whom was probably Valens himself. The six, naturally with different birthcharts, were all experiencing astrological crisis periods. The planets involved were different in each case, but in every case were those connected with ships and accidents—namely either Saturn (‘disposed toward 38 III, 4.3.22–24 (Henry/Schwyzer): . . . καὶ ἐσμὲν ἕκαστος κόσμος νοητός, τοῖς μὲν κάτω συνάπτοντες τῷδε, τοῖς δὲ ἄνω καὶ τοῖς κόσμου τῷ νοητῷ. . . . ‘. . . and we are each an intel-ligible cosmos, conjoining the lower cosmos with the parts of the soul below and to the intelligible cosmos with the parts above . . .’.

For Valens, possibly, the skilful pilot rep-resents the benefics each survivor had working in his chart at the time.46 For Plotinus, perhaps the pilot’s good decisions and skill would show the human will and ability to make right choices, aided by the encouragement of the per-sonal daimon. For Valens, the same circumstances supply different astrologi-cal reasons for different people, while for Plotinus, different things happen to different people in the same circumstances as a result of both nature and human choice. Certainly Valens, a working astrologer, is mainly interested here in showing how astrology illumines the workings of fate, and not necessarily 41 Anthology, I, 1.7 (Pingree, 2.4): . . . πλευστικούς, πάρυγρα πράσσοντας.42 Ibid., I, 1.15 (Pingree, 2.17): τοὺς δὲ θανάτους ἀποτελεῖ βιαίους ἐν ὕδατι. . . .43 Ibid., I, 1.4 (Pingree, 1.15–16, 19): . . . σημαίνει μὲν κατὰ γένεσιν ἀνθρώποις ζωήν, σῶμα . . . πλοῖα. . . .44 Ibid., I, 1.21 (Pingree, 2.31–3.2): <Ὁ> δὲ τοῦ Ἄρεως σημαίνει βίας . . . ἐκπτώσεις . . . λῃστείας. . . .

In modern times, on the other hand, see the unfortunate example of the Titanic. A more recent shipwreck, dogged seemingly by heimarmenē, occurred off the coast of Gloucester, Massachusetts in October 1991, where every decision made by captain and crew led more inexorably to their destruction: see S.

(The daimons, as usual, lie in the middle: they are paradoxically subject to passions, but they are also, according to Plotinus, on a higher and more virtu-ous plane so that they can guide us.)These kinds of ideas may have led Porphyry to develop his idea of the guid-ing daimon represented by a ruling planet called the oikodespotēs, or one called the lord of the geniture (as laid out in the Letter to Anebo, 2.14c, 15c). The methods for finding such a ruling star—from which length of life can be deter-mined, but character as well—are given in his Introduction to the Tetrabiblos (see below).The daimon’s importance to Neo-Platonists is summed up by Proclus (who was influenced by Porphyry and Plotinus) in this paean:The daimon alone moves all, governs all, orders all our affairs. For it per-fects the reason, moderates passions, inspires nature, maintains the body, provides the accidentals, fulfils the decrees of fate and bestows gifts from providence; and this one being is king of all that is in us and all that has to do with us, steering our whole life.48Statements like this demonstrate why finding one’s personal daimon was so important (and not only to Neo-Platonists: as we have seen in Chapter Six, the Magical Papyri contain examples of how to find the personal daimon). We turn 47 Komorowska, Valens, 352–60, esp. 355–58 also discusses the shipwreck passage, acknowl-edging Valens’ primary interest not in philosophy or ontology, but in astrological practice.48 Proclus, On Alcibiades I, 78.1–6 (Westerink): μόνος δὲ ὁ δαίμων πάντα κινεῖ, πάντα κυβερνᾷ, πάντα διακοσμεῖ τὰ ἡμέτερα. καὶ γὰρ τὸν λόγον τελειοῖ καὶ τὰ πάθη μετρεῖ καὶ τὴν φύσιν ἐμπνεῖ καὶ τὸ σῶμα συνέχει καὶ τὰ τυχαῖα χορηγεῖ καὶ τὰ εἱμαρμένα πληροῖ καὶ τὰ ἐκ τῆς προνοίας δωρεῖται· καὶ εἷς ἐστὶν οὗτος ἁπάντων τῶν ἐν ἡμῖν καὶ περὶ ἡμᾶς βασιλεύς, οἰακίζων ἡμῶν τὴν σύμπασαν ζωήν.

His development of theurgy as a way to be one with the divine is a counterpoint to Porphyry, both in his under-standing of the daimonic and the divine, and in his use of astrology as a prac-ticing Neo-Platonist.1.2 IamblichusI approach Iamblichus’s work through the dialogue with Porphyry which shapes large sections of De mysteriis. The treatise is set up as answers to ques-tions posed by Porphyry in his Letter to Anebo,49 who wants to know, among other things, about the place of daimons in the cosmos, and about astrology.Porphyry asks ‘Anebo’ about predicting the future (2.1a = DM III.1, 99). Divination can be attained through dreams, divine inspiration, possession, visions and magical incantations (2.2a–f ). There is also a ‘technical’ side to divination (τέχνη ἀνθρωπίνη) (2.2g), and this is where astrology comes in, as a ‘technique for pursuing the future through . . . stars’ (2.2g).50 Porphyry wants to know who provides information about the future: is it gods, angels, daimons or something else (2.3b)? Iamblichus does not deny that divine beings come in various guises and exist at different levels, but they are not to be used to see the future willy-nilly, but to help the human soul advance on the path of becom-ing more divine. The preferred method for this is through theurgy. In fact, he claims that gods can deliberately not tell the future when it is in the interest of the human soul’s virtue: ‘Whenever it is necessary for the soul to exercise virtue, and uncertainty of the future contributes to this, the Gods conceal the things that will happen in order to make the soul better’ (DM X.4, 289.13–15).51 The goal is not to see the future, but to become more god-like. (One wonders if the influence of the personal daimon also comes into play, urging the incar-nated soul towards the path of virtue, as Plotinus might say.)This does not mean that technical means of divination as a component of theurgy are ignored. Iamblichus allows that astrology could be a tool of the-urgy. Taking his cue from the Egyptian astrologers, he is aware of the oppor-tune moment (kairos) at which theurgic rituals, leading the soul to realms beyond fate and toward the highest god, should be begun:49 What remains of the Letter to Anebo are portions quoted in DM and Eusebius, PE (plus a couple of others). The fragments were collected and arranged by A. R. Sodano. I follow his numbering here.50 2.2g (Sodano, 11.4): . . . δι’ ἀστέρων τέχνην . . . τῆς θήρας τοῦ μέλλοντος.51 Shaw, Theurgy and the Soul, 234, discusses this matter (this is Shaw’s translation, slightly modified)."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7248but they recommend that we ascend through the practice of sacred the-urgy to the regions that are higher, more universal and superior to fate, towards the god who is the creator, without calling in the aid of matter or bringing to bear anything other than the observation of the opportune moment.52 (my italics)This clearly means katarchic astrology, which includes choosing the right astrological moment (kairos) to begin something.53 Iamblichus privileges this form of divination as an aid to the theurgic practice of becoming more divine.Regarding other astrological practices, especially as they relate to the per-sonal daimon, Iamblichus is more wary. Porphyry wants to know what Anebo thinks of the notion that the planet which is the astrological ‘house-master of the nativity’, the οἰκοδεσπότης τῆς γενέσεως,54 imparts the personal daimon (the daimon is the spirit of that planetary god).55 Iamblichus replies by explaining that there are two ways to approach the discovery of the personal daimon: one is theurgic and one technical (astrological):To put the matter simply, one may take two approaches to the personal daimon, the one theurgic, the other technical; following the former pro-cedure, one summons the daimon down from the higher causal princi-ples, while according to the latter, from the visible cycles in the nativity; the former makes no use of natal astrology, while the latter makes use also of such procedures; the former operates on a more universal basis, transcending the realm of nature, while the latter conducts its worship on a particular level, following the dictates of nature. All this being the case, you seem to me to be proceeding inappropriately in dragging down 52 DM VIII.4, 267.6–10 (Des Places): . . . ἀλλὰ καὶ διὰ τῆς ἱερατικῆς θεουργίας ἀναβαίνειν ἐπὶ τὰ ὑψηλότερα καὶ καθολικώτερα καὶ τῆς εἱμαρμένης ὑπερκείμενα παραγγέλλουσι πρὸς τὸν θεὸν καὶ δημιουργόν, μήτε ὕλην προσποιουμένους μήτε ἄλλο τι προσπαραλαμβάνοντας ἢ μόνον καιροῦ παρατήρησιν.

See the discussion of this passage in Addey, Divination and Theurgy, 105–06.53 For katarchic astrology in ritual, see Hephaestio, III, 6.11 (this passage will be discussed in Chapter 10).

(Porphyry’s slant, stemming from his interest in astrology, is dif-ferent.) Iamblichus does not dismiss astrology entirely, although he obviously considers it inferior to pure theurgy. But for him, theurgy transcends nature (while also operating through nature), while astrology must operate within nature. When Porphyry emphasises the oikodespotēs as the personal daimon, Iamblichus is quick to point out that it is not quite that simple:. . . you seem to me to be cutting off just a small portion of the whole question concerning the daimon.

(Letter to Anebo, 14b = DM IX.2, 273.10–274.3)57Iamblichus’s point is that one cannot find the personal daimon by using just one astrological technique, or even the astrological chart as a whole, but must take every part of the entire cosmos into account, presumably by methods 56 DM IX.1, 273.2–9 (Des Places): ὡς μὲν οὖν ἁπλῶς εἰπεῖν, διττῆς οὔσης περὶ τὸν ἴδιον δαίμονα πραγματείας, τῆς μὲν θεουργικῆς, τῆς δὲ τεχνικῆς, καὶ τῆς μὲν ἀπὸ τῶν ἄνωθεν αἰτιῶν αὐτὸν ἐπικαλουμένης, τῆς δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν ἐν τῇ γενέσει φανερῶν περιόδων, καὶ τῆς μὲν οὐδὲν προσχρωμένης γενεθλιαλογίᾳ, τῆς δὲ ἐφαπτομένης καὶ τῶν τοιούτων μεθόδων, καὶ τῆς μὲν ὑπὲρ τὴν φύσιν καθολικώτερον, τῆς δὲ μεριστῶς κατὰ τὴν φύσιν αὐτὸν θεραπευούσης, ἀτόπως μοι σὺ δοκεῖς τὴν τελειοτέραν ἱερουργίαν ἐπὶ τὴν ἀνθρωπίνην ὑπενεχθῆναι καὶ ἐπὶ ταύτης γυμνάσαι τὰς σαυτοῦ ἐρωτήσεις.

(Letter to Anebo, 16a = DM IX.7, 281.6–13)59Here Iamblichus seems to say that an oikodespotēs is a daimon; he also warns Porphyry against seeing the personal daimon as anything less than an overall ruler (and implies that astrology ignores a single overseer in favour of lesser 58 (Des Places): Εἰ δὲ δεῖ σοι τὸν ἀληθῆ περὶ τοῦ οἰκείου δαίμονος λόγον ἀποκαλύψαι, οὐκ ἀφ’ ἑνὸς μέρους τῶν ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ οὐδ’ ἀπό τινος στοιχείου τῶν ὁρωμένων ἀπονέμεται ἡμῖν οὗτος, ἀφ’ ὅλου δὲ τοῦ κόσμου καὶ τῆς παντοδαπῆς ἐν αὐτῷ ζωῆς καὶ τοῦ παντοδαποῦ σώματος. . . .

He knows about the decans. The ‘servitors’ (leitourgoi) are the daimons associated with the decans (decan stars are called leitour-goi in SH VI.12).63 There are references to decans and ministers in the Pistis Sophia,64 Firmicus Maternus (II, 4.4–5) and Anubio.65 The ‘Greater and Lesser 60 The oikodespotēs ruling over a particular area of life is not the same as the oikodespotēs of the nativity which imparts the personal daimon astrologically.61 See Introduction to the Tetrabiblos, ch. 30, discussed below. Broze and Van Liefferinge, ‘Le démon personnel’, 68, 77 conclude that Porphyry doubts that astrologers can discover the personal daimon from the master of the house, but they seem unaware of Porphyrian material on astrology and his interest in finding the personal daimon in the birthchart (as in ch. 30, and in On What is Up to Us). It is also evident that they do not understand the astrological uses of the oikodespotēs. Regarding my assertion that Porphyry was an astrol-oger as well as a philosopher (the two are not mutually incompatible), I strongly disagree with the assumption of A. P. Johnson, Religion and Identity in Porphyry, 113, 170–72, that Porphyry the philosopher could only write about astrology out of intellectual interest and with a ‘critical attitude’.62 He refers to similar astrological techniques also at VIII.4, 266.63 SH VI.12 (Nock and Festugière, CH III, 36): ἔτι καὶ ἐν οὐρανῷ φερόμενοι ἀστέρας γεννῶσιν αὑτοῖς ὑπολειτουργούς, <οὓς> καὶ ὑπηρέτας καὶ στρατιώτας ἔχουσιν. ‘Moreover, as they [the Decan gods] move in heaven, they engender stars for themselves called servitors, whom they have as servants and soldiers’.

The theurgic art, therefore, . . . often twines together stones, herbs, animals, aromatics, and other sacred, perfect, and deiform objects of a similar kind. Then, from all these it produces a perfect and pure receptacle.72Porphyry’s treatise On Statues (Περὶ ἀγαλμάτων), surviving in fragments,73 gives a context for this kind of practice. Astrology was often used to determine the right moment for consecrating statues and other holy images, and the proper astrological moment was based on characteristics, both astrological and religious/mythological, of the deity in question; see particularly Hephaestio 69 DM, IX.5, 279.2–5 (Des Places), trans.

Plotinus was his teacher, and Porphyry organised and disseminated what is known as the Enneads. Iamblichus may have studied with Porphyry (or been a fellow colleague), but the two had intellectual, philosophical and religious differences, as evident from Iamblichus’s responses to Porphyry’s Letter to Anebo. Porphyry was an intellectual eclectic—highly curious, not fixed in his intellectual opinions (compared to Plotinus and Iamblichus), not afraid to ask questions and per-fectly willing to admit his own ignorance in certain areas. There is something refreshing about his unpretentious attitude. He has been accused of being an intellectual lightweight;75 Bidez, who wrote an early study of him and his work, thinks he was spoiled by his flexibility.76 But ultimately these perceptions are unfair, and recent scholarship has rehabilitated his intellectual powers.77Several of Porphyry’s treatises deal with both daimons and astrology (Letter to Anebo, On What is Up to Us, Philosophy from Oracles,78 The Cave of the Nymphs in the Odyssey). On Abstinence deals in part with daimons of all kinds; and he is the presumed author (of most chapters) of the astrological treatise Introduction to the Tetrabiblos (see below, Section 3, ‘Porphyry’s Astrological Treatise’, esp. nn. 122–125). We may thus consider him knowledgeable, even expert, in these two fields.74 See Hephaestio, III, 7.13–18 (Pingree, 258–59); and for Julian, CCAG VIII/4, 252.6–22.

We have seen Iamblichus’s response to Porphyry’s questions about the personal daimon. We have not, however, looked at this issue from Porphyry’s standpoint. From his statements in the essay On What is Up to Us, Porphyry’s interest in applying Plato’s concept of the personal daimon from the Myth of Er to the astrological chart is plain. He believes each incarnated soul enters into the chosen life, with her daimon rati-fying the chosen life, at the appropriate astrological moment.79Porphyry is convinced of a connection between the personal daimon and the analogue of that daimon which can be found in the birthchart. For him, this analogue is found by determining the predominator and the οἰκοδεσπότης γενέσεως, the ‘housemaster of the nativity’, and from that the lord of the nativity.802.1 Master of the House: Definitions and ContextIn Hellenistic culture, connotations of the word oikodespotēs encompass not only the literal ‘master of the house’, i.e. the ruler of the household in the pri-vate sphere of the home, but by extension a general ruler or lord. In the New Testament, it is used not just for the master of a household but allegorically for God: for example, the vineyard-owning oikodespotēs of the parable in Matthew 21:33–41 is an allegory for the Lord.81 Broader connotations of oikodespotēs 79 ‘Περὶ τοῦ ἐφ’ ἡμῖν’, Wachsmuth, II, 164.8–13; 171.20–24 = Smith, 296.16–297.1 (268F); 306.89–92 (271F) = Wilberding, To Gaurus, 143, 146. This last passage emphasises the connection of the astrological Ascendant, the sign and degree on the eastern horizon at the moment of birth, with the chosen life and the accompanying daimon. (See also Chapter 6, 2.1, for similarities in Hermetica).80 Porphyry, Introduction to the Tetrabiblos, CCAG V/4, 206.3, ch. 30.1 (= ὁ οἰκοδεσπότης τῆς γενέσεως at DM IX.5, 278.12–13 [Letter to Anebo 15c]).81 This is made clear in 21:40 when the ‘oikodespotēs’ of the vineyard becomes a ‘kurios’. Matt. 21:33 (King James Version): ‘Hear another parable: There was a certain householder (oikodespotēs), which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a wine-press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country . . .’. 21:40: ‘When the lord (kurios) therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?’ (The Biblical definitions cited and discussed by G.

These are a few of many examples in astrological writings.86 Porphyry, Introduction, CCAG V/4, 197.11–22 (≈ Antiochus, Introduction, ch. 5, CCAG VIII/3, 113.14–22; cf. also Antiochus, Thesaurus, ch. 32; a similar passage also in Hephaestio, I 13.1 [Pingree, 39.16–18]): Συνοικοδεσπόται δ’ ἀλλήλων λέγονται, ὅταν τοῦ μὲν οἶκος ᾖ, τοῦ δὲ ὕψωμα. τινὲς δὲ τοὺς τῶν οἴκων καὶ τοὺς τῶν τριγώνων κυρίους συνοικοδεσπότας λέγουσιν, οἷον Κριοῦ Ἥλιος καὶ Ἄρης, Ταύρου Σελήνη καὶ Ἀφροδίτη, Διδύμων Ἑρμῆς καὶ Κρόνος, Καρκίνου Ζεὺς καὶ Σελήνη, Ζυγοῦ Κρόνος καὶ Ἀφροδίτη, Σκορπίου Ἄρης μόνος, Τοξότου Ζεὺς καὶ Ἥλιος, Αἰγοκέρωτος Ἄρης καὶ Κρόνος, Ὑδροχόου Κρόνος καὶ Ἑρμῆς, Ἰχθύων Ἀφροδίτη καὶ Ζεύς· ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν λοιπῶν. φωστῆρας καὶ φῶτα καὶ βασιλεῖς λέγουσιν Ἥλιον καὶ Σελήνην καὶ τὸν μὲν ἡμέρας, τὴν δὲ νυκτὸς κυρίους· ἐν ταῖς συνοικοδεσποτίαις τοὺς τῆς αἱρέσεως λέγουσι φωστῆρας, ἐν οἷς ὕψωμά τινος λαβεῖν οὐκ ἔστι. ‘They are said to be co-housemasters of each other when the house of one is the exaltation of the other.

It is mentioned in the fragments (quoted by later astrologers) of Nechepso and Petosiris,88 some of the earliest astrologers whose writings we possess. One of these fragments is found in the summaries of Antiochus of Athens:89But as Nechepso says, and to which Petosiris also agrees with the king, the things being sought turn out to be understood from the examination of both the housemaster and the lord. For the housemaster on the one hand [deals with] the length of human lifetimes, but the lord, on the other hand, the type of life of those about to come into existence.9087 A TLG search on ‘oikodespot’ yielded the names of Ptolemy, Vettius Valens, Antiochus, Dorotheus, Porphyry, Hephaestio, Rhetorius, Olympiodorus (called ‘Heliodorus’), Paulus, Julian of Laodicea, Serapion, Antigonus, Protagoras and Deucalion as well as Arabic-era astrologers Theophilus, Māshā’allāh, Abū Ma‘shar and the pseudonymous ‘Palchus’. The TLG does not have Riess’s fragments of Nechepso-Petosiris (see n. 88).88 First collected in Nechepso and Petosiris, Fragmenta magica, ed. Riess. (Note: these frag-ments have been revised and augmented by S. Heilen, ‘Some metrical fragments from Nechepsos and Petosiris’, in La poésie astrologique dans l’Antiquité, ed. Isabelle Boehm and Wolfgang Hübner (Paris: De Boccard, 2011).89 CCAG VIII/3, 104–19 contains summaries of Antiochus’s Thesaurus and Introduction. A summary of four chapters of a ‘second book’, says D. Pingree, ‘Antiochus and Rhetorius’, CPh 72, no. 3 (1977): 203–23, here 206, ‘probably belongs to a work other than Antiochus’ Εἰσαγωγικά’, but it follows the summary of the first book of the Introduction.90 CCAG VIII/3, 119.25–29 (not in Riess; = fr. +18 in Heilen, ‘Metrical Fragments’, 33): φησὶν δὲ ὡς Νεχεψῶ τε τῷ βασιλεῖ, ᾧ καὶ Πετόσιρις συμφωνεῖ, ἐκ τῆς διασκέψεως τοῦ τε οἰκοδεσπότου καὶ τοῦ κυρίου εἰς κατάληψιν τὰ ζητούμενα πίπτει. καὶ γὰρ τὸν μὲν οἰκοδεσπότην τὸν ζωτικὸν ἀνθρώπων χρόνον, τὸν δὲ κύριον τῶν συγκηρεῖν μελλόντων τὸν βίον. Here my translation uses συγκυρεῖν as Cumont doubtfully suggests (119, app. crit. to ll. 28–29: ‘συγκηρεῖν cod. Leg. συγκυρεῖν?’). He ultimately decides on συγκηρεῖν as a variant of συγκηραίνω, a form of κηραίνω, destroy. LSJ s.v. συγκηρέω gives the ‘destroy’ meaning and cites this very text. (The translation would then read ‘the lord destroys the life of those about to be’.) The ‘destroy’ meaning could connect with the idea of an anairetēs, a planet which cuts off a life. Unfortunately the confusion between verbs is symptomatic of the confusions and variations which arise with delineating the doctrine of the oikodespotēs. But my inter-pretation, using συγκύρω, ‘happen’, ‘occur’, makes more sense here, especially if we think of the lord of the nativity ruling over the kind of life the native lives, which fits with Porphyry’s idea that one of these overall chart rulers connects to a personal daimon guid-ing a human through life.

Often it is associated with determining life expectancy. Porphyry is not particularly eccentric in his methods for the oikodespotēs (although his motives may be different). We shall look at some other astrologers’ methods before examining Porphyry’s in more depth.2.2 Dorotheus’ OikodespotēsThe techniques Dorotheus uses for finding rulers of the chart appear in the Arabic translation of his work (III, 1 and 2), and in a Greek fragment pre-served in Hephaestio (II, 26). Unfortunately, they are somewhat opaque (pos-sibly Dorotheus was one of the astrologers whom Porphyry meant when he said, ‘For the ancients entangle the names up and do not distinguish their characteristics’).94 The Greek fragment refers only to a ‘releaser’ (aphetēs), not calling it by any other name, though he seems to mean something like Porphyry’s ‘predominator’. The Arabic version calls the releaser the haylāj χρόνον (the same phrase used by Vettius Valens of the epikratētor in III, 1.1) in regard to the oikodespotēs, but βίον in regard to the kurios. (Porphyry’s treatise On What is Up to Us makes the same distinctions between ζωή and βίος [Wachsmuth II, 163.16–167.7 = Smith, 295.1–300.104 (268F); Wilberding, To Gaurus, 141–43].)

The haylāj is the ‘indicator’ and the kadhkhudāh the ‘governor of the matter of life’.95To find the haylāj, one looks first at the Sun by day and the Moon by night, but if they are not suitably placed, one looks in turn at the Lot of Fortune, the prenatal lunation (whether new or full), or the lord of the Ascendant.96 The Greek fragment and the Arabic text both insist that the haylāj be aspected by one of its lords (either its house, exaltation, triplicity or bound lord). Once the haylāj is determined, its bound-lord becomes the kadhkhudāh. The technique is clarified by an example in Dorotheus (III, 2.19–25),97 where the Ascendant is the haylāj and its bound lord, Mars, is the kadhkhudāh.2.3 Ptolemy’s OikodespotēsPtolemy uses the concept of a ‘housemaster’ to apply in a number of differ-ent areas, including length of life, quality of soul, eclipses, action/profession etc. The general principle is outlined in Book II, 8.2–4, in reference to eclipses. Ptolemy explains that one finds a planet with the most relationships in a cer-tain position (here, the place of an eclipse). These relationships, relations or claims (the slippery Greek word logos) consist of the rulerships by house (sign), triplicity, exaltation and bound that the planet holds in that position, as well as the phase or configuration (aspect) it makes. For the phase or con-figuration, Ptolemy is interested in the ‘visible applications or separations’. If two (or more) planets have the same number of claims to rulership, he looks for the one which is closest to an angle, in a more productive place, or in the sect of the chart.95 Dorotheus III, 2.2 (Pingree, 242). The Arabic description of III, 1 (Pingree, 235) also uses the terms ‘indicator’ and ‘governor’ for haylāj and kadhkhudāh.96 In fact, this procedure has certain similarities with Porphyry’s instructions for finding the lord of the nativity, where a list of candidates includes the lord of the Lot of Fortune, the bound-lord of the preceding lunation and the lord of the Ascendant. But Dorotheus uses this list sequentially to find the haylāj/apheta, not the lord of the nativity.97 Pingree dates this chart to ca. 7 a.m., 20 October 281. But J. H. Holden, A History of Horoscopic Astrology from the Babylonian Period to the Modern Age (Tempe, AZ: American Federation of Astrologers, 1996), 34, n. 83 suggests ‘a better fit to the positions given in the text is 2 October 44, which is also consistent with the dates of Dorotheus’s other example charts.’ A check of this chart (2 October 44, ca. 8:00 a.m.) in a modern calculation pro-gram (Solar Fire v. 5.1) shows agreement with Dorotheus’s positions by sign, though not by degree (Pingree’s suggested date gives a different sign for Venus and Mercury).

They accord with meaning #2a.III, 11 gives doctrine on the length of life, ‘taken in complex ways from the predomination of the most authoritative places’.99 This involves finding a rul-ing planet from certain positions (Sun, Moon, Ascendant, Prenatal Syzygy, Lot of Fortune)100 when placed in ‘aphetic’ places (roughly corresponding to the first, eleventh, tenth, ninth and seventh places). For a day chart, one would favour the Sun, if in aphetic places; for a night chart, the Moon (also in aphetic places); but if not, the preceding syzygy and the Ascendant; the planet with the most ‘relations’ is the oikodespotēs. Note the use of the word ‘predomination’ (epikratēsis). This technique is similar to Dorotheus’s for finding (in the Arabic version) the haylāj (releaser, or aphetēs, in Dorotheus ap. Heph. II, 26).

Valens also distinguishes between the planet which gives life and the planet which sustains life: ‘So one [planet] was the life-giver, and another <the> lord of the existence and the death.’104 These are akin to the functions of Dorotheus’s haylāj and kadhkhudāh.Finding these astrologically is taken up in the next book. First, a method for determining a ‘predominator’ (ἐπικρατήτωρ) is delineated in III, 1, and from that the oikodespotēs is found.105 The predominator is generally the Sun by day and the Moon by night, but this depends on its placement in the chart—con-sidering its aspects (to the Ascendant or Midheaven), its sect vis-à-vis that of the chart, whether it is in its own triplicity, and the productiveness or effec-tiveness of the place in which it lies (i.e. an angle, eleventh or fifth, etc.). If the Sun or Moon is not found in a productive place, one can look at the Hour-marker and its lords, or even the Midheaven and its lords. Once the predomi-nator is found, the bound-lord of the predominator becomes the oikodespotēs (meaning #3). Valens gives numerous examples of Sun and Moon positions to illustrate the hierarchy of the concept. He also illustrates the technique in actual charts (III, 5); these turn out not to have an oikodespotēs, since what would be the oikodespotai, the bound rulers of the predominator (in these cases the sect luminary), are not well-placed (L75 and L110,III in GH). For Valens, the bound-lord must also be in good condition to be an oikodespotēs. (Valens is the only writer aside from Porphyry to give detailed instructions for finding an epikratētōr.)106102 II, 41.3–4 (Pingree, 118.3–8): ‘ἀρχή, τέλος, κράτησις τῶν ὅλων διοπτευτηρίων—ὁ καθ’ ἑκάστην γένεσιν ἀστὴρ οἰκοδεσποτῶν ὅστις πρόδηλα ποιεῖ τοῖς γεννωμένοις οἵτινες ἔσονται τοῦ βίου τε ὑπόστασιν ὁποίαν τινὰ ἕξουσιν, τοῖς τρόποις τε ὁποῖοι, σώματος μορφῆς τύπον, ἃ πάντα τού-τῳ κατακόλουθα γίνεται. τούτου δ’ ἄνευθεν οὐδέν, οὔτε πρᾶξις οὔτε δόξα, προσπάρεστιν οὐδενί.’103 See II, 41.5–20 (Pingree, 118.8–119.26).104 II, 41.9 (Pingree, 118.26–27): ἕτερος οὖν ὁ ζωοδότης ἐγένετο καὶ ἕτερος <ὁ> τῆς ὑπάρξεως καὶ τοῦ θανάτου κύριος.105 We discussed this procedure in a different context in Chapter 3, 2.5, 107.106 If the predominator or oikodespotēs is not ‘oikeiōs’, Valens propounds a technique said to be from Nechepso (III, 7.1–15 = fr. 18 Riess, 360–362; = fr. 18 in Heilen, ‘Metrical Fragments’, 32); this is a technique for life expectancy involving a lot found using the positions of"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7262In Book VII, 2 Valens lays out a system of determining ‘effective and inef-fective’ (empraktos and apraktos) times of life, using an oikodespotēs. It is not entirely clear whether he means an oikodespotēs which is the overall lord of the nativity (meaning #4), or whether he is looking at several planets who are house-masters. His first statement seems to mean the former:For every nativity, when the stars have been set out accurately, it will be necessary to examine how the House-master is configured, or by what [stars] it is witnessed, and if it is in a state of emergence or setting [i.e. vis-ibility or invisibility with respect to the Sun], and if it possesses a configura-tion which is ‘domestic’ or ‘foreign’ to the sect [of the chart]. . . .107Yet he continues by saying that ‘in common with this’108 one must also look especially at the condition of the Lot of Fortune and its lord, then the Ascendant and its lord, planets in the Ascendant, the Midheaven and its lord, and the lords of the other two angles, as well as aspects with the Moon (VII, 2.2–15, Pingree, 252.4–34). It is hard to tell whether he means all of these con-tribute in some way to the effectiveness of the times, or whether the strongest planet in these positions becomes the oikodespotēs. The latter is more in line with Porphyry’s position about the ‘lord’, as we shall see.2.5 Firmicus’s OikodespotēsFirmicus gives several different methods for finding the oikodespotēs in Mathesis IV, 19.2. The Latin phrase dominus geniturae translates his translitera-tion of the Greek, oecodespotes, described as controlling ‘the sum of the whole nativity, and from it the individual stars are allotted the license to decree’109 new and full moons; it is called the Lot of Hyleg by Bonatti.

The first method says the ‘lord of the geniture’ is any planet dignified both accidentally (by place) and essentially (by house or terms). A second method looks at the term (bound) lord of the Sun by day and the Moon by night. Firmicus acknowledges the logic of this. A third method uses the exaltation ruler of the Moon. A fourth method finds the ruler from the lord of the sign following that in which the Moon is found—a method seen in no one but Firmicus, but which he favours, claiming it is ‘most true and approved by all’.110 For Firmicus, neither the Sun nor the Moon can be the dominus genitu-rae (IV, 19.4).2.6 Paulus’s OikodespotēsPaulus lays out the necessary conditions for the oikodespotēs in Chapter 36 (Boer, 95–98). It is found from either the Sun or the Moon, if the Sun and Moon are ‘in the operative places’. These are, in a diurnal chart, the Hour-marker, Midheaven, Good Daimon, Setting and Post-Setting (i.e. eighth) places. By night the operative places are all four angles and the places of Good Fortune, Good Daimon, the post-ascension of the Hour-marker (the second), and the Post-Setting (the eighth) (these are the succedent places). If the Sun or Moon do not fall in any of these, one looks at the bound lord, triplicity lord or house lord of the prenatal syzygy (new or full). If those are not in operative places, one looks at the house, triplicity or bound ruler of the Lots of Fortune and Daimon, as well as the lord of the Hour-marker. These techniques have com-monalities with Dorotheus and with Ptolemy, though the latter does not inten-tionally use the Lot of Daimon. Finally, a planet ruling in these places in aspect with the planet it rules will become the overall ‘authority’ (kuria) of the nativ-ity. At one point Paulus calls this ὁ τῆς γενέσεως οἰκοδεσπότης (meaning #4).111 (The astrologer Serapion also talks about an ‘authority’ being found from the bound-lord of the Moon, based on whether the Moon is present in the same bounds with its ruler, either applying or separating.)112110 Ibid., IV, 19.3 (KSZ, I, 243.28–29 = Monat, II, 179): ‘. . . haec enim est verissima et ab omni-bus comprobata.’ The Renaissance thinker Marsilio Ficino, who had a great interest in the personal daimon, had read both Porphyry’s and Firmicus’s methods for finding the oikodespotēs (which Ficino, following Firmicus, calls the ‘dominus geniturae’). See De vita coelitus comparanda, 23 (Kaske and Clark, 370–77).111 Ch. 36 (Boer, 97.19–20).112 CCAG VIII/4, 229.1–3: ἐὰν δὲ ὁ κύριος ἐπιτρέχῃ μοίραις τῶν ὁρίων <καὶ> Σελήνη συμπαρῇ αὐτῷ κατὰ τὰ αὐτὰ ὅρια, εἰ δὲ Σελήνη αὐτῷ συνάπτει, κυρία ἔσται ἡ συναφή· ὡσαύτως ἐὰν ἀπορρῇ, κυρία ἔσται ἡ ἀπόρροια."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7264Olympiodorus’s Commentary, ch. 40, gives more details on how to do this. When the planet has been found, one looks at how it is positioned in the chart, and what aspects it makes. The oikodespotēs is used by Paulus and Olympiodorus in length of life calculations.2.7 Hephaestio’s OikodespotēsIn Book I, 13, Hephaestio summarises the definitions of an oikodespotēs. It is the house ruler of a zodiac sign (meaning #1a), but any planet ruling by exalta-tion, triplicity and/or bound also is a co-oikodespotēs (meaning #1b; Antiochus and Porphyry also mention this meaning). Following the rules of Ptolemy, he defines a ‘house-master of the nativity’,113 from the ‘five’ rulerships by house, exaltation, triplicity, bound and ‘phase in relation to the Sun’.114 But he does not say how to find the planet for which these should be calculated. However, the passages from Dorotheus on the aphetēs, found in Hephaestio’s Book II, 26, go into the procedure in much greater detail. The earlier reference may assume a planet in an aphetic place which is free of affliction from malefics: ‘In addi-tion to these [rules], it is necessary to examine the aphetic places and discern the one that is delivered from and free of the disturbance of a malefic.’115Interestingly, and relevant to our discussion of the personal daimon, Hephaestio actually mentions a personal daimon in I, 1. He says that for someone whose Ascendant is in the first decan of Virgo, ‘. . . his personal dai-mon and fortune will take care of him. He will be unhealthy, but will be pro-vided with medical remedies; and after [his] youth he will be kindly treated by a woman and will be provided with a good end of life.’116 If the Ascendant falling in a particular decan has something to do with the personal daimon, would this association, then, give more weight to the Ascendant and/or its lord in the selection of a ruler of the nativity? Hephaestio does not address this issue, though, nor does he mention a personal daimon in any other delineations of decans.113 Hephaestio I, 13.2 (Pingree, 39.18–19): . . . ὁ δὲ τῆς γενέσεως οἰκοδεσπότης. . . .114 Ibid., 39.21: . . . φάσεως πρὸς τὸν Ἥλιον.115 II, 26.32 (Pingree, 198.1–3): Πρὸς τούτοις δὲ χρὴ σκοπεῖν τοὺς ἀφετικοὺς τόπους καὶ προκρίνειν τὸν ἀπηλλαγμένον καὶ ἐλεύθερον κακοποιοῦ συστάσεως.116 I, 1.109 (Pingree, 15.24–16.3): . . . καὶ κηδεμονίαν αὐτοῦ ποιήσεται ὁ οἰκεῖος αὐτοῦ δαίμων καὶ τύχη, ἔσται δὲ ἐπίνοσος, τεύξεται δὲ καὶ ἰατρικῶν βοηθημάτων καὶ μετὰ τὴν νεότητα εὐνοηθήσεται ἀπὸ γυναικὸς καὶ ἐσχάτης καλῆς τεύξεται."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Porphyry, The Oikodespotēs And The Personal Daimon 2652.8 Rhetorius’s OikodespotēsRhetorius provides several chapters on the predominator and the housemaster.117 He claims to be using the techniques of Valens.118 His method also shows the influence of Dorotheus, as he stresses that the oikodespotēs must aspect the Sun or Moon (he quotes Dorotheus on the importance of looking at what aspects the aphetēs).119 For the oikodespotēs, Rhetorius uses either the house- or bound-lord of one of the luminaries.120 Finding the oikodespotēs is essential for determining lifespan. The length of life is based on the condition of the oikodespotēs, which gives a certain number of years (if it is in very bad condi-tion, it gives not years, but ‘months, days or hours’).121TABLE 7.1 Summary of meanings of OikodespotēsAstrological Authors on the OikodespotēsDorotheus: The haylāj of the Arabic version equates to the Greek version’s aphetēs, and Porphyry’s ‘predominator’. This haylāj must be aspected by one of its lords (house, exaltation, triplicity or bound). The bound lord of the haylāj is the kadhkhudāh, equiv-alent to the oikodespotēs.Ptolemy: There can be more than one oikodespotēs (i.e. an oikodespotēs of length of life, of quality of soul, etc.). To find it, look at the planet’s house, triplicity, exaltation and bound lords, plus the planet’s phase or configuration (this would especially privilege a visible planet making an aspect, either applying or separating, or a planet in a phase of visibility). He does not mention anything here about looking first at the Sun or Moon. However, his methods for finding a predominator and oikodespotēs for life expectancy do use the Sun and Moon, as well as the preceding syzygy and the Ascendant.117 CCAG VIII/1, 239–41, chapters 17, 19 and 20 (from Par. gr. 2506); see Appendix 7.A, #10 (L482), for an excerpt from these chapters and a chart delineated using Rhetorius’s rules.118 One of Rhetorius’s chapters (19) is entitled ‘On Nativities without a housemaster accord-ing to Valens’ (CCAG VIII/1, 240).

Boll, Studien über Claudius Ptolemäus: ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der griechischen Philosophie und Astrologie (Leipzig: B. G. Teubner, 1894), 112–18, esp. 117–18). One of Boll’s arguments (117) is that if the treatise were truly Porphyry’s he could not have refrained from commenting on heimarmenē and free will as he did in What is Up to Us. But the Introduction is an astrological text, not a philosophical text. Surely the reverse argument does not hold water, namely that the authorship of On What is Up to Us is in question because Porphyry does not give exact astrological techniques like those in his astrological treatise—so why would it be true when applied to the astrologi-TABLE 7.1 Summary of meanings of Oikodespotēs (cont.)"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Porphyry, The Oikodespotēs And The Personal Daimon 267(except for the last chapters, 46–55, which have been shown as late addi-tions to the text).123 Certainly Porphyry lifted large portions of his text from the earlier astrologer Antiochus of Athens,124 but this should not invalidate his authorship in general.125 Possibly the Introduction was written as a teach-ing text which could have been revised and/or supplemented over a period of cal treatise? Another argument is that someone who claims in the Letter to Anebo that the tenets of astrology are ‘akatalēptos’ would not even dare to write an introduction to a book which claims in the beginning that knowledge through astronomy is graspable: ‘Und wie kann derselbe, dem diese ganze Theorie ἀκατάληπτος erscheint, eine Einleitung zu einem astrologischen Werk schreiben, dessen erstes Kapitel betitelt ist: ὅτι καταληπτικὴ ἡ δι’ ἀστρονομίας γνῶσις?’ (117) (this is the title of ch. 2, Book I of the Tetrabiblos). But 1) Porphyry could be playing devil’s advocate in asking if astrological techniques are truly ‘ungraspable’; 2) his words are paraphrased by Iamblichus for the latter’s own purposes (i.e., to make Porphyry look inconsistent) in this section (15a–c = DM IX.3, 276.5–10; DM IX.4, 277.1–4; DM IX.5, 278.12–15); 3) it makes little sense that Porphyry would claim an astrological oikodespotēs if he thought it could not be found; and 4) he does claim in the Proemium of the Introduction (CCAG V/4, 190.9–10) that astrological technique can be grasped, as long as it is properly laid out. Boll’s third argument (118) uses quotations from the anonymous Commentary on the Tetrabiblos, the Tetrabiblos itself, and the Introduction to claim essentially that Porphyry would have quoted himself more if the Intro duction were genuinely his. How can Boll know this? I do not find these argu-ments compelling (and I wonder if Boll was influenced by the astrological prejudice of his day). Among current scholars, Giuseppe Bezza also does not accept Porphyry’s author-ship. See Bezza, ‘Length of Life’, 5: ‘. . . falsely attributed to Porphyry.’ (He gives no reason.)123 D. Pingree, ‘From Alexandria to Baghdād to Byzantium’, 7–8. Chapters 47–52 were inserted by Demophilus, and 46 and 53–55 should also not be attributed to Porphyry, but Pingree accepts the rest of the chapters as authentic. In fact, he uses Porphyry as the author of the Introduction to the Tetrabiblos to help date Antiochus (as a terminus ante quem).124 Pingree, ‘Antiochus and Rhetorius’, 205–08, has done the work of comparing the texts. Pingree drew on and expanded the work of Cumont, ‘Antiochus d’Athènes et Porphyre’, whom he cites, but he disagrees with Cumont’s dates for Antiochus.125 In addition to Pingree as above, n. 123, most scholars accept the work as genuine Porphyry, including Stefan Weinstock and Emilie Boer, who edited the original CCAG version (‘. . . vix est quod dubitemus, quin Porphyrius philosophus ipse Introductionem in astrologiam composuerit’, CCAG V/4, 187). Bidez, Vie de Porphyre, 72*, No. 70, also accepts it as genuine, and Andrew Smith in his Fragmenta, liii, includes it as a genuine work of the ‘Scientifica et Miscellanea’ and at 490 numbers it P. 64, though he does not provide the text. An early printed edition was Basle 1559. It may be the same as what the Suda IV, 178.30–31 (Adler) calls ‘Εἰσαγωγὴν ἀστρονομουμένων ἐν βιβλίοις τρισί’ (see the note for 418T in Smith, ed., Porphyry, Fragmenta, 490; also the introduction of Boer and Weinstock, CCAG V/4, 187).

He did not just lift Antiochus without commentary. Chapter 30 contains illuminating comments. Given Porphyry’s interest in finding the astrological personal daimon by the technique of the oikodespotēs, these comments stress its significance and provide another indication that the work is his, sand-wiched as they are between the words of Antiochus. Here are the parallel pas-sages from Antiochus and Porphyry (similarities are underlined; additions in Porphyry are italicised).Antiochus:Λέγει δὲ ὡς οἰκοδεσπότης γενέσεως καὶ κύριος καὶ ἐπικρατήτωρ διαφέρουσιν ἀλλήλων. ἐπικρατήτορα μὲν γὰρ λέγει τῶν δύο φωστήρων ὃς μᾶλλον τῷ γενετῆρι διαθέματος ἐπικρατεῖ, καί τινας μὲν λέγειν ὡς ἡμέρας ὁ Ἥλιος ἐπικρατεῖ, νυκτὸς δὲ ἡ Σελήνη. (Introduction, CCAG VIII/3, 118.9–12)He (Antiochus) says that the House-master of the nativity, lord and pre-dominator are different from one another. For he says that the predomi-nator is the one of the two luminaries which predominates more over the theme’s birth-hour,129 and some say that by day the Sun predominates, but by night the Moon.commentaries. The closest parallels were to portions of Contra Christianorum, the Commentary on Ptolemy’s Harmonics, and De antro Nympharum.126 Harold Tarrant suggested this to me in a personal conversation (17 Feb 2015). See also Johnson, Religion and Identity in Porphyry, 156, 163–64, 167–68.127 Lawrence, ‘Who Thought the Stars are Causes?’, 30–31.128 Porphyry died ca. 305 CE (Iamblichus, On The Mysteries, trans. Clarke/Dillon/Hershbell, Introduction, xxi). DM was composed between 280 and 305 (ibid., xxvii), but the odds are it appeared before Porphyry’s death, especially if we accept Dillon’s argument that DM was a youthful work (Iamblichus, In Platonis dialogos commentariorum fragmenta, ed. John Dillon, (Leiden: Brill, 1973), 13).129 LSJ, s.v., says that γενετήρ = γενέτης, ‘begetter, ancestor’. Though I suppose one could trans-late ‘dominates more over the theme’s begetter’, i.e. taking the native as the literal cause of the creation of the chart, I think γενετή, ‘hour of birth’ may fit the context better here.

For each has its own power, just like a skipper and a pilot; so we will teach how they are different from each other’ (my italics). What was a matter-of-fact statement in Antiochus has taken on a certain urgency in Porphyry. Porphyry stresses the difference between the three concepts, and the importance of distinguishing between them (which he is prepared to do). He even provides a poetic simile to emphasise how important the differences are, a simile with philosophical implications. The ‘kubernētēs metaphor’ is well-known in philosophical circles, especially Platonic.130 We have seen Plotinus using the metaphor of the soul as if onboard a ship and the daimon as encouraging its virtuous behaviour. Plato calls nous the ‘pilot of the soul’ (Phaedrus 247c7), and we have previously seen connections between the daimon and nous in the Timaeus. Other middle and 130 See the informative paper of E. Afonasin, ‘The Kybernētikē Technē Metaphor in the Platonic Tradition’ (paper presented at the 12th Annual Conference of the International Society for Neoplatonic Studies, Lisbon, Portugal, 16–21 June 2014), 2–3. Afonasin cites numerous examples of this metaphor from Plato (e.g. Rep. 488a, Statesman 272e, 296e, Phaedrus 247c) and later Platonic traditions (e.g. Numenius, Fr. 18; Iamblichus, Comm. in Tim., Fr. 87 (Dillon, 200–01); Iamblichus, DM 3.26.163.10; Alexander of Aphrodisias, De anima 20.29; Plotinus, Ennead 4.3; Porphyry, Ad Gaurum 10.4–6)."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7270Neo-Platonic examples show the daimon as governor of the soul;131 earlier we also saw Proclus using similar language to describe the powers of the daimon (246 and n. 48). Porphyry even uses the metaphor elsewhere, in To Gaurus on how embryos are ensouled, where at birth a ‘pilot’ (the [self-moving] soul) of the fetus comes into the body (the ship, built by Nature).132 Later (16.5.1–5) this ‘pilot’ is connected to the soul which enters the body at the right astro-logical moment,133 a concept fleshed out in On What is Up to Us. This pilot, I would argue, is the personal daimon guiding the soul of the newly incarnated life. Thus I suggest that the reasons for Porphyry’s insistence in Chapter 30 on enhancing these definitions, and the specific language he uses, are pre-cisely because of this Platonic background inciting his interest in seeing what imparts the personal daimon in the birthchart.The rest of this chapter shows us Porphyry’s treatment of the predomina-tor, house-master and lord, what he means by oikodespotēs (and if he distin-guishes more than one meaning) and how these may relate to the discovery of an astrological personal daimon. The first section is clearly borrowed from the summary of Antiochus’ Introduction, chapter 28 (29 Cumont) (see Appendix 7.B for a full comparison between ch. 30 of Porphyry and ch. 28 of Antiochus). Here is the entire paragraph as written by Porphyry:Furthermore, precise definitions are required to differentiate house-master of the nativity, lord and predominator from one another.

Now some hold that the Sun by day and the Moon by night predominate, but it is set out precisely like this: for a diurnal nativity the Sun, if it is being carried up in the east, will itself take the predomination; but when the Sun is declining on the west 131 See Timotin, Démonologie, 248–49, 315–16.132 Ad Gaurum, 10.4–11.2 (see Wilberding, To Gaurus, 44–45 and commentary), e.g. 10.4.1–4 (Kalbfleisch, 47.5–8): ὁ δὴ πᾶς χρόνος ἐν τῇ γαστρὶ εἴς τε τὴν πλάσιν καὶ τὴν πῆξιν ἀναλίσκεται, ἐοικὼς νεὼς κατασκευῇ εἰς ἣν αὐτίκα δὴ μάλα ὅταν ἐκτελέσας αὐτὴν ὁ ναυπηγὸς εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν καθελκύσῃ, ὁ κυβερνήτης εἰσοικίζεται·. ‘Indeed, the entire time in the belly is spent on forming and solidifying, like in the building of a ship, where at the very moment when the ship-builder has completed the ship and launches it into the sea, the ship’s pilot is settled in it (Trans.

I have translated κυβερνήτης as ‘pilot’ and εἰσοικίζεται as ‘is settled in’.).133 See Wilberding, To Gaurus, 53 and n. 220 (he follows Festugière’s reading of κ<ατὰ καιρὸ>ν ψυχὴ τῷ τεχθέντι γενομένη: Festugière, La révélation d’Hermès Trismégiste, vol. 3, Les doc-trines de l’âme, 297, n. 1)."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Porphyry, The Oikodespotēs And The Personal Daimon 271[side of the chart], if the Moon is in the east, that one [the Moon] will take it, even if she is post-ascending the Hour-marker [i.e. in the second place], because she is going up on the east [side of the chart]. But if both [the luminaries] are declining on the west [side], the Hour-marker will hold the predomination. For a nocturnal nativity, if the Moon is being carried up on the east [side], she herself will take the predomination. But if she is declining on the west [side of the chart], but the Sun, though still under the earth, is post-ascending the Hour-marker, that one will predominate.134The Antiochus portion breaks off at this point, but it is not unreasonable to assume Porphyry would have continued to follow Antiochus while adding his own commentaries. (See Appendix 7.C for Porphyry’s whole chapter.) This first part explains how to determine the ‘predominator’, the epikratētōr of the chart: either the Sun or the Moon are preferred, but the Ascendant can also become the predominator if the luminaries are not well-positioned. ‘For generally the luminary that is more on a centrepin, and more in the east and of the sect determines the predominator. If both [the luminaries] are declining, then the Hour-marker will obtain the predomination.’135 The reason that Porphyry (fol-lowing Antiochus) is interested in finding the predominator is because the oikodespotēs is determined from it: it is the lord (i.e. house-ruler) of the sign in which the predominator is found, and a co-house-master is the planet that rules the bounds of that place (this is approximately meaning #3).Porphyry continues, at length, on ways to find the overall ‘lord’ (kurios) of the chart, and gives the opinions of others on to how to find it. He says the process is intricate and difficult, ‘For the search for this is long and perhaps more difficult than all others.’136 He looks at a number of ‘rulers’—he calls them oikodespotai—who can be considered for the job of overall chart ruler. They are lords of particular places in the chart: the Midheaven, the Ascendant, a planet in the first place, etc. (207.7–23). After giving the candidates, he finally says that to choose the overall lord of the chart (to be known as the ‘lord of the geniture’ in medieval and Renaissance astrology), find ‘the one placed most sympathetically in the nativity, that is, the one situated better [in a good place], 134 The portions about determining the ability of the Sun or Moon, based on their position in the chart (eastern or western, rising or setting), to be the leading chart authority have a certain similarity to a passage in Serapion (CCAG VIII/4, 228.12–15).135 Porphyry, Introduction to the Tetrabiblos, CCAG V/4, 206.21–24: τὸ γὰρ ὅλον ὁ ἐπικεντρότερος τῶν φώτων καὶ ὁ μᾶλλον ἐν τῷ ἀπηλιώτῃ καὶ τῆς αἱρέσεως κρίνεται ἐπικρατήτωρ. ἐὰν δὲ ἀμφότεροι ἀποκλίνωσιν, ἀποίσεται τὴν ἐπικράτησιν ὁ ὡροσκόπος τότε·. . . .136 CCAG V/4, 208.1–2: πολλὴ γὰρ ἡ περὶ τούτου ζήτησις καὶ σχεδὸν ἁπάντων δυσκολωτέρα."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7272more in a phase of visibility, or more on its own places and having the most power in relation to the configuration of the nativity and those co-witness-ing it’.137 (This is approximately meaning #4). This process makes clear that Porphyry, contrary to what Iamblichus has said about him flitting between one daimon (i.e. oikodespotēs)138 for this and another daimon for that (DM IX.7, 281.5–13), is ultimately interested in a single lord of the nativity (thus repre-senting the astrological personal daimon).At each step Porphyry looks for the planet in the best condition in the chart, one most able to give benefits. Each succeeding ruler builds on the strength of the one before it. Each time a planet is seen to have difficulty (cadent, set-ting in the west, in a phase of invisibility, out of sect with the chart), it is dis-carded in favour of a stronger planet. The finding of these three rulers helps coordinate the selection of an overall ruler of the chart. One planet may be both house-master and lord. In that case, Porphyry says, it ‘will [then] rule over a great outcome.’139 (One planet could also be both predominator and house-master, if one takes the sign ruler of the predominator as the house-master.140 This seems to be Porphyry’s preference, with the bound-lord being a co-housemaster.)141Porphyry’s methods are similar to those of the other astrologers previously cited, except for Firmicus.142 All except Firmicus use the positions of the Sun, Moon or Ascendant in some way (Firmicus indirectly uses the Moon posi-tion). The concept of an oikodespotēs determined from a predominator is covered by Dorotheus and Valens. Some of the procedures he describes are similar to those attributed to Dorotheus in Hephaestio II, 26 (though they are each finding different kinds of rulers). Porphyry relies on ‘good’ or ‘operative’ places for his determinations (not unlike Ptolemy’s aphetic places). Paulus and Olympiodorus ultimately want to find a planet with the ‘most authority’, simi-lar to Porphyry’s kurios, lord (which is clearly the forerunner of the Medieval almuten thematis). While the interests of the other astrologers are mostly in determining length of life, Porphyry does not mention length of life in this 137 Ibid., 207.23–27: ἐκ δὲ τούτων πάντων τὸν συμπαθέστατα πρὸς τὴν γένεσιν κείμενον ἀποφαίνονται κύριον, τουτέστι τὸν ἐπικείμενον πρότερον, τὸν ἀνατολικώτερον ἢ τὸν μᾶλλον ἐπ’ οἰκείων τόπων καὶ τὴν πλείστην δύναμιν πρὸς τὸ σχῆμα τῆς γενέσεως ἔχοντα τούς τε συμμαρτυροῦντας αὐτῷ.138 See 250 and n. 59.139 Ibid., 208.4–5: . . . ἄρξει μεγάλου ἀποτελέσματος.140 E.g., the Sun in Leo as predominator in a diurnal chart would also be the house-master, if the house-master is the sign ruler.141 Ibid., 207.1–3: ὁ μὲν γὰρ κύριος τοῦ ζῳδίου, ἐν ᾧ ἐστιν ὁ ἐπικρατήτωρ, οἰκοδεσπότης ἔσται, ὁ δὲ τῶν ὁρίων συνοικοδεσπότης.142 His method clearly is anomalous."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Porphyry, The Oikodespotēs And The Personal Daimon 273chapter. In fact, his interest seems to be, ultimately, in finding an ‘authentic’ or ‘authoritative’ (αὐθεντικόν) planet which rules over the whole life (‘rule over those who have been born’ (τῶν γεννωμένων κυριεύειν),143 whatever its length.What, for Porphyry, is the ultimate relationship among the predomi-nator, house-master and lord? All three are involved in finding an overall ruler for the chart, a planet that connects all the important parts of the chart together: the luminaries, the Ascendant, the aspects between these places and planets, the important places of the chart like the Ascendant, Midheaven, eleventh place, the Lot of Fortune; the planets in phases of vis-ibility. The planet with strong position, good phase, connection with lumi-naries and relationships with important places in the chart becomes able to coordinate the whole work and purpose of the chart. Here, in astrologi-cal language, is the work of the personal daimon made manifest. The planet which represents the personal daimon becomes a way for the astrologer to do a kind of astrological theurgy, either for himself or for his client: a ritual involving stars, mathematics, harmony (sympatheia) and light. He is not just finding a strong and well-endowed planet, but a planet which becomes the astrological analogue of the personal daimon. Again, that planet cannot be one in a weak position—this is not a technique which comes up with a fee-ble daimon, but one which can spur the holder of such a chart on to his/her highest potential.How might Porphyry see this procedure in relation to theurgy? In discuss-ing the ‘higher’ and ‘lower’ theurgy of Iamblichus,144 Andrew Smith suggests that ‘lower’ theurgy has to do with sympatheia and the material world, which includes daimons.145 However some scholars, e.g. Addey and Shaw, prefer not to divide theurgy into ‘lower’ (suggesting ‘inferior’) and ‘higher’ levels, but con-sider theurgical practice as more integrative and cumulative in attaining unity with the divine.146 Though Iamblichus also distinguishes, as we saw, between the ‘theurgic’ and ‘technical’ way to find the personal daimon (DM IX.1, 273.2–9), both methods would be useful in theurgic practice; one would not neces-sarily be inferior to the other. In the Cave of the Nymphs, Porphyry mentions propitiating one’s personal daimon as a good thing to do (using the example 143 Ibid., 207.16–18 (giving context): τοῦτον γὰρ τῆς κοσμικῆς ἐπισημασίας τότε γινόμενον αὐθεντικὸν ὁμολογουμένως καὶ τῶν γεννωμένων κυριεύειν. . . .144 A.

Knowing about one’s personal daimon in whatever ways are available, including astrological, could only improve one’s ability to understand the plan of the life the soul has chosen, and aid in the achievement of virtue. There may even be, in finding the astrological daimon, a way to free oneself from part of fate by propitiat-ing the right gods in the right way. In the Letter to Anebo, Porphyry connects heimarmenē with the stars, but these stars represent gods who can deliver one from it:And most of them [the Egyptians] even made what is up to us depend-ent on the motion of the stars, binding them fast, I do not know how, by the indissoluble bonds of Necessity, which they call Fate, and making all things dependent on these gods whom, as the only deliverers from Fate, they worship with temples, and statues, and the like.’149 (my italics)More importantly, the personal daimon has a role to play in the release from heimarmenē: ‘he is surely happy (eudaimōn) who, learning the celestial con-figuration of his own birth, and hence recognising his personal daimon, is ena-bled to neutralise by sacrifices the power of fate.’150 For Porphyry, neutralising 147 Porphyry, De antro nympharum, Nauck, 35.8–11; Seminar Classics 609, 32.26–27: ἔνθεν αὐτῷ καὶ ἡ ὑπὸ τὴν ἐλαίαν καθέδρα οἰκεία ὡς ἱκέτῃ τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ὑπὸ τὴν ἱκετηρίαν ἀπομειλισσομένῳ τὸν γενέθλιον δαίμονα.

In this way Porphyry, by taking on the long and difficult task of finding the true strongest and best planet in the chart, is actually beginning his own theurgy with astrology; for him, this task becomes a religious endeavour every bit as sacred and elevating as the theurgi-cal rites Iamblichus finds so inspiring. discovers his daimon in the chart, he ‘can influence him and be master of his fate’ (‘. . . peut influer sur lui et être maître de son destin.’).

This chapter will first explore the use of lots in Hellenistic culture, along with their relationship to the daimon, and continue by investigating lots in astrological technique. This chapter intro-duces the general concept of lots; the following two chapters will concentrate on the specific lots of Fortune, Daimon, Eros and Necessity. What does the cul-tural understanding of lots tell us about the way they are used in astrology? Can the theory of the astrological lots give us insight into the cultural significance of lots? Let us keep these questions in mind as we continue our exploration.The earliest clearly datable writing on lots in Hellenistic astrology is Manilius, Astronomica (3.75–202) (the poem can be dated to the time of Augustus and his successor Tiberius).2 The earliest evidence of employing lots in practice appears to be 1) a chart of 43 BCE discussed by Balbillus (L-42 in GH)3 and, possibly, 2) a chart in the Arabic translation of Dorotheus that mentions ‘Fortune’,4 dated by David Pingree to 13 CE. There is lot doctrine in Nechepso and Petosiris, of uncertain date, but probably second to first century BCE. This suggests that the astrological lot had, in part at least, a Hellenistic-Egyptian origin. Dorotheus (first century CE), mentions not only the Lot of Fortune but the Lots of Daimon, marriage, father, mother, brothers and others. In the Liber Hermetis and Rhetorius, lot interpretation is given some prominence;5 though these texts are late, they are thought to have drawn on Hermetic material * With many thanks to †Josèphe-Henriette Abry for her helpful comments on this chapter.1 C.

Lots are a continuing theme in much Hellenistic astrological writing.1 Lots in Hellenistic CultureIn using lots, astrology is drawing on a well-developed tradition in Greek cul-ture. The Greek word for a lot, κλῆρος, probably derives from the shard of stone or wood used to cast lots.6 It seems to be related to the verb κλάω, ‘break’.7 Its original meaning describes the lot which is cast to give an allotment; in the beginning this was property. Later a κλῆρος itself was a piece of property, or a received inheritance. But it was also part of a divinatory practice in that the casting of lots, and the decisions gained thereby, were seen as a way to know the will of the gods. The decision of the lot was seen as binding. In fact (though paradoxically), even the gods cast lots to make decisions: the allot-ments of the portions of the world to Zeus, Poseidon and Hades were made by lot.8 In Babylonian mythology, Anu, Ea (Enki) and Enlil also were given their kingdoms of heaven, water and earth by lot.9As well as being a divinatory tool on its own, sortition was used in tradi-tional oracles. Delphi had a lot oracle,10 and Cicero mentions a lot oracle at Dodona, which the Spartans consulted before the battle of Leuctra.116 See ‘κλῆρος’ in R. S. P. Beekes, ‘Etymological Dictionary of Greek’ (BrillOnline Dictionaries), online at http://dictionaries.brillonline.com/greek (accessed 29 April 2015). I thank Katelyn Chin for accessing this entry for me. Chantraine, Tome II, 542–43 and Frisk, Bd. 1, 872–73, say the same. Interestingly, κλῆρος is also said to be related to the Celtic word clār, which means a board or a piece of wood (Chantraine, II, 543; Frisk, I, 873).7 Bezza, AM, vol. 2, 963 also gives an etymology of κλῆρος. His entire chapter on lots is informative, and has served as a source for my investigation.8 See Iliad, 15.187–93. (Bezza, AM, vol. 2, 963, gives this allusion.) In Iliad, 7.171–199, lots are cast to decide who fights Hector.9 ‘They [the Annunaki] took the box . . ., / Cast the lots; the gods made the division. / Anu went up to the sky, / [And Ellil (?)] took the earth for his people (?). / The bolt which bars the sea / Was assigned to far-sighted Enki.’ Trans. Dalley, Myths from Mesopotamia, 9, ‘Atrahasis’ (The Flood), Tablet I, 11–16. The similarity between the passage in the Iliad and this myth is also mentioned by W. Burkert, ‘Signs, Commands, and Knowledge: Ancient Divination between Enigma and Epiphany’, in Mantikê. Studies in Ancient Divination, ed. Sarah Iles Johnston and Peter Struck (Leiden: Brill, 2005), 29–49, here 37. Burkert stresses the random nature of lot-casting as a sign of its complete objectivity, and therefore ration-ality; but see below, 281 and n. 16, for Plato’s take on this.10 Burkert, Greek Religion, 116.11 Cicero, De divinatione, I.34.75–76."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Allotment, The Daimon And Astrology 281The political use of lots in Athenian civil society was widespread.12 Aristotle tells us, in The Athenian Constitution, that many judicial practices were made by lot,13 as well as the selection of Greek archons and many officials.14 Even in modern Greece land has sometimes been apportioned by lot.15 However the casting of lots, while often seen as the fairest way to choose something, was not universally employed. Lots were not used for occupations requiring specific skills; e.g. generals were not chosen by lot. Plato (Laws 757b–758a) points out this drawback: choosing by lot, though allowing all an equal chance, does not always obtain the best person. Therefore, he says, it is important to pray to Zeus and to Good Fortune to have the lot fall out so that the best is chosen (Plato calls this ‘proportional’ justice).16 Here then, chance is linked with divinity in finding the outcome by lot. This linkage may have something to do with the antiquity of the Lot of Fortune and why it is the most prevalent lot in astrology.12 For a survey of Athenian practices, see R. G. Mulgan, ‘Lot as a Democratic Device of Selection’, The Review of Politics 46, no. 4 (1984): 539–60.13 Aristotle, The Athenian Constitution, 58–59.14 Ibid., 8.1–2, 22.5, 26.2, 55.15 See H. L. Levy, ‘Property Distribution by Lot in Present-Day Greece’, TAPhA 87 (1956): 42–46. Lotteries can assign students to charter schools in the United States today.16 Plato states (Laws): [757b] ‘. . . there are two kinds of equality [arithmetical and propor-tional] which, though identical in name, are often almost opposites in their practical results. The one . . . employing the lot to give even results in the distributions; but the truest and best form of equality is . . . the judgement of Zeus, and . . . [757c] it produces all things good; for it dispenses more to the greater and less to the smaller, giving due measure to each according to nature; . . . it assigns in proportion [κατὰ λόγον] what is fit-ting to each. . . . [757d] But there are times at which every state is compelled to use the words, “just”, “equal”, in a secondary sense, in the hope of escaping . . . from factions. [757e] . . . this is the reason why it is necessary to use the equality of the lot, in order to avoid the discontent of the people; and so we invoke God and good fortune (θεὸν καὶ ἀγαθὴν τύχην) in our prayers, and beg that they themselves will direct the lot with a view to supreme justice. . . . although we are compelled to use [758a] both equalities, we should use that into which the element of chance enters as seldom as possible.’ Trans. R. G. Bury (757b-757c), Plato, Laws, (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1926, repr. 1967); and B. Jowett (757d-758a), Plato, Dialogues of Plato, trans. Benjamin Jowett, vol. 5: Laws, Index (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1892). Thus in casting a lot, which is only equitable but not necessarily just, one must pray that Zeus and Good Fortune will give ‘proportional’ justice. Bezza, AM, vol. 2, 963, com-menting on this passage, says ‘La sorte è un dio, “è il giudizio di Zeus.” ’. I am not sure Plato goes that far. Rather, I think he means not that the lot itself is a god, but that proportional judgement is given by God (Zeus). Plato realises the indiscriminate equality of the lot can sometimes bring the wrong choice, so he invokes ‘God and good fortune’ to amend this lack of discrimination."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8282The Greeks were not the only society to use lots. Casting of lots was employed in Jewish culture of this same time-frame,17 and there are many other examples of the use of sortition in Roman and other cultures of the Republic, Empire and late Empire.181.1 The Daimon and the LotOne of the best-known relationships between the daimon and lots in Hellenistic culture is exemplified in Plato’s Myth of Er (Republic X). It provides an important backdrop for astrological lots, so is worth quoting extensively:[617d–e] When Er and the souls arrived, their duty was to go at once to Lachesis; but first of all there came a prophet (prophētēs) who arranged them in order; then he took from the knees of Lachesis lots (klēroi) and examples (paradeigmata) of lives, and having mounted a high pulpit, spoke as follows: ‘Hear the word of Lachesis, the maiden daughter of Necessity. Mortal souls, behold a new cycle of life and mortality. Your daimon will not be allotted (lanchanō) to you, but you will choose your daimon; and let him who draws the first lot have the first choice, and the life which he chooses shall be his of necessity. Virtue has no master, and as a man honours or dishonours her he will have more or less of her; the responsi-bility is with the chooser—God is not responsible.’ So saying, the prophet scattered lots indifferently among them all, and each of them took up the lot which fell near him. . . .

In addition, the element of chance (tuchē) plays an important role in this story. Let us go over the main points of the quotation.1) A ‘prophet’ is in charge of the whole process of allotment and choice. At an oracle, prophets interpret the words of the mantis (diviner). As such, they are associated both with the act of divination and, implicitly, with prediction. The prophet here is the representative of the divine.2) The prophet takes the lots and examples of lives from the knees of Lachesis. Here Plato uses two words to express allotment: the κλῆροι, the literal, physical lots, and Lachesis, one of the Moirai, whose name comes from the verb λαγχάνω, which means ‘allot as one’s portion’, thus con-necting with μοῖρα, a portion and a destiny. Plato brings our attention to the idea of allotment linked to human life, which is controlled by the divine and administered by those who interpret for the divine (‘prophet’ meaning to ‘speak for’ the god).3) The prophet tells the souls to ‘hear the word of Lachesis’. As the ‘daughter of Necessity’, of that which is compelled, and over which there is no choice, she is the apportioner to whom they must listen.4) But Lachesis paradoxically allows the souls some choice. The souls pick the life they want, and there are more lives available than there are souls, so that all have the opportunity to pick a good one, even if they are among the last to choose. They choose their own daimon, who is the guide for the life chosen. However, within the choice there is also compulsion, or necessity: the souls must choose in the order the lots fall, and there are only enough lots for each soul. Necessity, which controls the spindle and whorls representing the physical world, also comes when the souls must enter the material world of generation after they have chosen their lives.5) ‘Virtue has no master.’ Whether each soul values virtue or not is up to her. The souls decide whether they want to choose a virtuous life or not, and their choice is the first demonstration of virtue (or lack thereof ). The daimon does not interfere with that decision; it merely fulfils their choice. Here is perhaps an inkling of a ‘good’ or a ‘bad’ daimon, who fulfils either a ‘good’ or ‘bad’ life. But the daimon is only following the soul’s choice: it is not inherently good or bad. Choosing to be virtuous, then, is the way in which we can exercise free will. Choosing virtue follows directly on choosing a daimon; by doing this Plato may be linking the two choices together, virtue being the corollary to our choice of a daimon. Both are examples of our free will.6) ‘God is not responsible’: here the split between theos and daimōn is dis-played, perhaps even the idea of an impersonal god who is above the fray"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"Allotment, The Daimon And Astrology 285of human existence (this is where the daimon comes in). Fundamentally the soul is responsible for the choice she makes, though once that choice has been made, it is not God who fulfils it, but the daimon. (The daimons are both ‘ministers’ and those who ‘administer’.) Nevertheless, the daimon only enforces the soul’s choice of life and, like God, is not responsible for it.7) We cannot ignore the workings of chance in all this. It is the chance of where the lot falls that brings about what soul picks it up. The prophet ‘scatters the lots indifferently’; this random scattering,20 however, leads to a certain order. (In astrology, we can compare this with the moment when the human happens to be born. The astrological lots pertinent to this discussion all project from the Ascendant, which correlates time of birth to the zodiac; thus this moment creates means for the apportion-ment which the lot gives. In a way, the astrological lots which use the Ascendant in astrology show the fulfilment of the order arising out of this chance event.)8) The daimon, the soul’s personal companion, leads the souls to fate, to the Moirai who weave, measure and cut the cloth of the life selected. The chosen daimon thus cooperates in the process of allotment.Porphyry’s exegesis of this passage in On What is Up to Us tries to reconcile ‘what is up to us’ with this allotment of lives in the Myth of Er.21 Furthermore, he correlates the souls’ choosing of their lives, and the moment of incarnation, with the hour-marker (Ascendant) and arrangement of planets in the astrolog-ical chart. Porphyry’s description shows that he knows the Egyptian doctrine of decans as life predictors; he guesses that Plato too might have known of such doctrine.22 While there is no proof that Plato knew of this, Porphyry’s essay 20 This same kind of scattering occurs in geomancy; see T. Charmasson, Recherches sur une technique divinatoire: la géomancie dans l’Occident médiéval (Geneva/Paris: Librairie Droz/Librairie H. Champion, 1980), 21.21 Porphyry, Περὶ τοῦ ἐφ’ ἡμῖν (Wachsmuth, II, 163–73, 8.39–42 = Smith, 295–308, 268F–271F). For the astrological part, see esp. (Wachsmuth) 169–72.

CH XVI.15 also has certain similarities with Plato’s myth, although it is more astrologically inclined (see Chapter Six, 2.1). Asclepius 35, as well, seems to describe something akin to what Porphyry says about each changing moment on the horizon being equated with a different form within a common class of forms. Proclus, in his commentary on Plato’s Republic, even considers the allotments of daimon and fortune in the Myth of Er to be correlated to the astrological lots of Fortune and Daimon: ‘One particular cause determines [the daimon and fortune]: the Sun and Moon, respectively, because the Lots of Daimon and Fortune are found from these gods in our nativities, which is clear to those trained in astrology.’23While it would be difficult to argue that Plato makes a specific correlation between the lots in the Myth of Er and the astrological lots, this section of Republic certainly shows astrological knowledge and a linkage between the planets and destiny.24 Porphyry and the Hermetic material build the astrologi-cal connection, and Proclus does specifically link astrological lots to it. The cultural connotation of a ‘lot’, created in part from stories like the Myth of Er, will play in the background of the employment of lots in astrology, and even be reinforced by astrology’s use of the same word, κλῆρος, for a lot. This concep-tion of destiny does not obviate the influence of Egyptian/Mesopotamian con-ceptions of fate on astrology, but acts as a counterpoise to them. The strength of both conceptions within astrology shows in the diversity of the ways fate plays out in the practice of Hellenistic astrology.2 Lot Doctrine in AstrologyMy focus in this section will be particularly on the astrological lots’ relation-ship to divinatory aspects of astrology, and the technique of lots as a way of enhancing those aspects. There is evidence of this relationship especially in Manilius and his places from the Lot of Fortune. Since the lot is created in a way that is personal and unique to each chart, it becomes a special indicator of personal outcomes in a life. The lot as interpreted by Vettius Valens has a role to play in the determination of happiness, while Paulus and Olympiodorus 23 Proclus, Commentary on Plato’s Republic (Kroll, II, 299.25–28): ἀφορίζει δὲ ὡς ἓν αἴτιον τὸν μὲν ὁ Ἥλιος, τὴν δὲ ἡ Σελήνη· διὸ καὶ οἱ κλῆροι τούτων ἀπὸ τούτων εὑρίσκονται τῶν θεῶν ἐν ταῖς γενέσεσιν ἡμῶν, ὥς ἐστιν δῆλον τοῖς περὶ ἀστρολογίαν γεγυμνασμένοις.24 See R. Waterfield, ‘The Evidence for Astrology in Classical Greece’, Culture and Cosmos 3.2 (1999): 3–15, here 6, 11, who is of the same opinion."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"Allotment, The Daimon And Astrology 287assign character traits to ‘planetary’ lots. All these connect lots with a person’s ‘fate’, fortunate or unfortunate, as dispensed by a divine heaven.Since it is formed by projecting the arc between two points from a third point, the lot, obviously, is invisible and non-corporeal (in that it is not an actual body in space). Nevertheless (or maybe we should suggest the opposite sentiment, ‘so therefore’, given the philosophical superiority of invisible and non-corporeal beings) its impact in the chart is given some weight—just as the Ascendant and Midheaven, though not actual bodies, have importance. However, unlike the Ascendant and Midheaven (and the Moon’s Nodes as well), the lot is a purely mathematical construct which has no physical basis (other than deriving secondarily from the positions of physical bodies). The lots, though based on observable points, carry the ratio of those points a step further than the non-corporeal points of the Ascendant, Midheaven and Nodes. Since they form a ratio (the distance between the two points used in the lot is proportional to the distance from the Ascendant), we may compare this to the way that Plato describes the casting of lots (κατὰ λόγον, by proportion or ratio) in the Laws as including a prayer to receive the proportional justice of Zeus (see above, 281). In this way the astrological lots, with their built-in proportion, may come nearer to the gods, or nearer to what the gods intend.The earliest information on the Lot of Fortune appears in the writings ascribed to Nechepso and Petosiris. It has particular importance in helping to determine length of life25 and whether particular times of life are effective or not; the Lot of Daimon also plays a part in these doctrines26 (see Chapter Nine, section 7). This material shows the earliest Greek astrology using the lot to discover information about the length and productivity of human life. Ptolemy and Hephaestio especially use the Lot of Fortune in length of life prediction; in Dorotheus, the Lots of Fortune and Daimon are involved in infant vitality:Look concerning the matters of bringing up at the lot of fortune and the lot of the demon. If you find the Moon with one of them or aspecting them in trine, this is a good indication in the matter of bringing up, and this is an indicator of the beauty of his face and the perfection of his 25 See, e.g. Valens, III, 11.3 (Pingree, 146.26–147.1), in connection with length of life determinations.26 Ibid., III, 11, esp.

If the Moon is free from these two, say the contrary to what I said.27In this doctrine the Moon, as a nutritive body, works with the Lots of Fortune and Daimon. The importance of both physical nurturing and bodily nor-mality is not insignificant in Greek astrology.28 In the Greek fragments of Dorotheus, this paragraph is paraphrased in the Nativity of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus: ‘Thus according to Dorotheus: when the Moon happens to be with the Lot of Daimon, it signifies the offspring will be well-nourished and produce teeth without trouble.’29Other astrologers are interested in the quality of life the lots provide (e.g. Vettius Valens, ‘Antiochus’30 and Rhetorius). Appendices 8.A, 8.B and 8.C con-tain descriptions, formulae and interpretations of these three authors. We shall discuss the lot technique of Julius Firmicus Maternus in the next chapter; I mention here only that he uses several lots associated with daimon and/or fortune: Cupido, Necessitas, Basis and Nemesis.31 The Nemesis lot uses Fortune and the Moon in its calculation: (positions of ) Asc + Moon – Fortune (N) and Asc + Fortune – Moon (D). This is an interesting combination, because Nemesis is associated with the goddess Tyche in religious cults,32 and Tyche (Fortune) is the Moon’s lot. The word ‘nemesis’, which derives from the verb νέμω, has to do with receiving one’s due.33 Again we connect to allotment and the daimon, who also fulfils the chosen destiny. As with the Lot of Nemesis, Firmicus also uses the Greek word for the Lot of Basis, with the following formula: Asc + Daimon – Fortune (N) and Asc + Fortune – Daimon (D). This lot will also be 27 Dorotheus, I, 9 (Pingree, 167).28 See, e.g., Ptolemy, Tetrabiblos, III, chs 9 (‘On Monsters’) and 10 (‘On Children who are Unnourished’). Similar passages are in Hephaestio, II, 9 and 10 (these are largely based on Ptolemy, however).29 In Dorotheus, Pingree, 327.10–12 (= fr. 22 Stegemann; III, 2 in horoscope of Constantine): Κατὰ δὲ Δωρόθεον οὕτως· ἡ Σελήνη μετὰ τοῦ κλήρου τοῦ δαί<μονος> τυχοῦσα εὔτροφον σημαίνει τὸ τεχθὲν καὶ ἀπόνως ἐκφυῆναι <τοὺς> ὀδόντας.30 In quotation marks because part of Rhetorius’s excerpt here is actually a close copy of Paulus.31 Firmicus, VI.32.45–46 for Cupido and Necessitas; VI, 32.56 for Nemesis and Basis (KSZ, II, 189.21–22, 23; Monat, III, 128): ‘Nemesis nocte a Fortuna ad Lunam, . . . basis nocte a for-tuna ad genium.32 See, e.g., Edwards, ‘Tyche at Corinth’, 532–33, 535–37.33 LSJ, s.v.

Cupido and necessitas (Greek Eros and Ananke) will be discussed in Chapter Ten.The following case studies, on Manilius, and Paulus and Olympiodorus, will demonstrate clear links between the lot doctrine of astrologers and the lot doctrine of Hellenistic culture, including connections to divination and the daimon.2.1 Manilius and the Circle of AthlaManilius connects the lots to fate from a Stoic34 (rather than Platonic) point of view. His position takes up a substantial chunk of Book 3 of the Astronomica (more than 125 lines out of almost 700), and he is almost unique among astro-logical authors in describing in great detail a place system based on where the Lot of Fortune falls.35 This system is in marked contrast to his descriptions of the places based on where the Hour-marker, or Ascendant, falls (the degree and sign on the eastern horizon at the moment of birth). The lot places have their own special meanings, all of which have to do with specific areas of life, unlike the meanings of the places starting from the Ascendant sign, which are described in more general terms as being favourable or unfavourable and are associated with various planets/gods.36 These places from the Ascendant often take their meanings from where the place lies in the diagram of the sky that the chart represents, with particular attention to where they lie in relation to the horizon and meridian.34 Scholarship has fairly unanimously identified Manilius’s Stoic tendencies. See, e.g., Goold in Manilius, Astronomica, Introduction, xxxvii (Loeb); W. Hübner, ‘Manilius als Astrologe und Dichter’, in ANRW, vol. II.32.1, ed. Wolfgang Haase (Berlin/New York: Walter de Gruyter & Co., 1984), 126–320, here 234–36; and F. Cumont, Astrology and Religion among the Greeks and Romans (New York/London: G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1912), 85; recently K. Volk, Manilius and his Intellectual Background (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), esp. 226–34 (she also discusses other influences); T. Habinek, ‘Manilius’ Conflicted Stoicism’, in Forgotten Stars: Rediscovering Manilius’ Astronomica, ed. Steven J. Green and Katharina Volk (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011). Among other indications, Manilius’s treat-ment of the elements and his belief in the power of fate show his Stoic inclinations.35 Valens describes such a system as well, but not nearly in the detail that Manilius does; and Valens’ descriptions are very different from those of Manilius. However, Valens does give examples using this technique. See Chapter 9.36 The only specific areas of life mentioned in the place system from the Ascendant are health (6th place), brothers (3rd), marriage (10th), fathers (4th) and children (1st). The lot places, by contrast, mention many more areas of life (see below, Figure 8.1, Circle of Athla)."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8290For Manilius, the ‘lot places’ combine with the other ways of arranging the sky and help to personalise the chart, to make it a unique expression of a person’s fate. The Lot of Fortune individualises that fate. Because it not only derives from the Ascendant (arguably the most personal degree because it is based on the time and place of birth), but also is combined with the positions of the Sun and Moon projected from the Ascendant, this qualifies it to be the arbiter and allotter of the events of a life. By creating a system of places based on and starting from the Lot of Fortune, Manilius astrologically mimics the casting out of the lot; where it falls is where the fate begins.With a choice of words that emphasises the connection to fate and proper allotment, Manilius tells us that everything in the sky is allotted its own rec-ompense, and all is part of the fulfilment of destiny. ‘. . . to each [zodiac sign] she consecrated its own reciprocal service and fulfilled the sum total in every respect, so that the rendering of fate should be drawn from everywhere into a single whole’ (3.64–66).37 Here are words like ‘vices’, reciprocal service, or rec-ompense, what the sign ‘in turn’ gives back.38 The recompense is ‘consecrated’ (sacrare), and the whole ‘fulfilled’ (sancire), a word which has the sense of ful-filling a prophecy or ratifying a law.These are the fixed laws of the universe: in his lead-up to the description of lot places, Manilius emphasises nature’s fixity of the heavens, the fixed order by which the world operates, the fixing in the sky of the zodiac and the plan-ets tied to human fate. He says ‘. . . by fixed rules she joined separate limbs into a single body . . .’ (3.50–51); ‘. . . she assigned . . . fixed functions, and con-ducted the whole inventory of a human’s condition under a fixed system . . .’ (3.71–73).39 When he begins to talk about the lot apportionments and their relationship to the zodiac, by contrast, he uses words of fluidity and imperma-nence, as if to acknowledge the individual, particular contribution the lots give to each person.The lots of these activities she allocated each to a sign, not in such a way that they should remain in a permanent quarter of the sky . . . but so that 37 Manilius, Astronomica, 3.64–66 (Goold): ‘. . . propriasque sacravit / unicuique vices sanx-itque per omnia summam, / undique uti fati ratio traheretur in unum.’38 Vices (there is no nominative singular) has the sense of alternation and reciprocity; it can also mean ‘hap’ or ‘fortune’, probably deriving from its fundamental meaning of ‘change’ (Lewis and Short, s.v.).39 Manilius, Astronomica, 3.50–51 (Goold): ‘. . . diversaque membra / ordinibus certis sociaret corpus in unum . . .’; 3.71–73: ‘. . . certasque vices . . . /attribuit, totumque hominis per sid-era censum ordine sub certo duxit . . .’."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Allotment, The Daimon And Astrology 291they should receive their proper position according to the moment of birth and change from sign to sign, each lot at a different time moving to a different constellation, so that the nativity then meets with a new pattern in the zodiac. . . .40 (Italics mine.)The activities of the lot places are fixed, since the lots go in zodiacal order, but the beginning sign, i.e. the allotment, is fluid, based on the position of the Lot of Fortune, which in turn is based on the time of birth, the moment when the allotment begins. ‘For they [the activities] do not keep permanent homes or preserve the same stars for every person born, but they change with time, moving now hither, now thither, through the circle of signs . . .’.41 In a way, this is a doubly fluid system, since it is already building on the shifting of the Ascendant for each birth.Manilius calls the lot places athla from the Greek word for contest, and they are described as aerumnosus, ‘toilsome’ (3.172) in Goold’s translation, sug-gesting that life, at least the life that the lot apportions, is an uphill battle. We are probably also to be reminded of the twelve athla, or labours, of Heracles for which, as M. L. West plausibly argues, there seem to be some cosmologi-cal-astrological connections.42 It is important to note here that Manilius uses a number of other words to describe the lots and their places: sors, pars, locus, sedes. Sors has the same range of meanings as κλῆρος, and could fairly be said to be its Latin equivalent. Manilius is careful to use it when referring specifically to the Lot of Fortune, e.g. ‘the first lot has been given to Fortune.’43 In apposition to sors is pars, which means ‘a portion’, but specifically here the por-tion assigned to the lot, sors.44 For Manilius, the sors allots the pars. Contrasted 40 Ibid., 3.75–81: ‘horum operum sortes ad singula signa locavit, / non ut in aeterna caeli statione manerent / et cunctos hominum pariter traherentur in ortus / ex isdem repetita locis, sed tempore sedes / nascentum acciperent proprias signisque migrarent / atque alias alii sors quaeque accederet astro, ut caperet genitura novam per sidera formam . . . ’.

He connects Heracles’ Twelve Labours with the Platonic Great Year, and also with a Stoic allegory of the myth, citing Cleanthes as the probable source. Since Manilius’s outlook is primarily Stoic, for him to make the same connection would not be improbable. (For more on Orphic connections to astrology, see Chapter 10.).43 Manilius, Astronomica, 3.96 (Goold): ‘Fortunae sors prima data est.’44 Ibid.; see 3.67–85, which shows the contrast between these words."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8292to these two words are ‘place’ words like locus, sedes, statio and gradus: these are used by the poet to tell us where the lot ‘place’ falls in the order it takes from the Lot of Fortune.45 It is as if these words bring into actuality the apportionment of the lot; they place it in the business of the material world.In his descriptions of the second through the tenth lot ‘places’ Manilius uses all these ‘place’ words. But in the description of the eleventh lot place, 45 Actually, Manilius calls the places from the Lot of Fortune ‘lots’, sortes, as if they are sec-ondary lots in themselves. Where this lot falls is a ‘locus’, place (the second, fourth, ninth and tenth); a ‘statio’, station (the third); a ‘gradus’, step (the fifth); a ‘sedes’, seat (the sixth, seventh and eighth).

In the eleventh and twelfth lot places Manilius describes not only apportionments which arrive at birth, but also refers to what are called elections and inter-rogations, both of which are included in katarchic astrology.47 This seems to imply that the lot places from Fortune are used not only in natal astrology, but in the astrology of choosing or interpreting ‘moments’ in later time (this is different from predictive techniques like profections). The eleventh place is where one can find the ‘choice of remedy and the moment for administering it, or in whose hour therapy and the mixing of life-saving potions have greater efficacy’.48 The twelfth, Manilius says, gives us information on whether we should take a job or initiate a lawsuit, whether our crops will succeed or fail—‘this is the portion in which day and hour for a decision shall be given, if the planets as they move through the zodiac are favourably situated’ (3.149–155).49Notably, the two places so qualified to provide this information are the elev-enth and twelfth from the Lot of Fortune. The eleventh from Fortune is a place of acquisition in Vettius Valens. The association of this place with Jupiter and with the Agathos Daimon makes this a logical assignment. But this powerful assignment of decision-making to the twelfth place from Fortune is curious. In the normal scheme of the twelve places, the twelfth place has negative implications for the native. However, it is also called metakosmios, ‘between worlds’.50 Is this, then a place where the daimonic can move between and thereby connect the divine and human realms?

Note that in the normal assig-nation of the twelve places from the Ascendant, the eleventh and twelfth are places of the daimōn, in both good and bad manifestation. We have seen the daimōn’s association with divinatory practices such as oracles and the casting of lots. There is also evidence of connections between Fortune and Daimon (as divinities) in religious areas. Might some of these same connections apply here in Manilius’s delineation of the eleventh and twelfth places from Fortune, and his linking them to katarchic astrology? Are the clear katarchic refer-ences limited to the eleventh and twelfth places because of connections to the daimon and divination? Bouché-Leclercq points out a highly interesting correlation between some of these ‘lot places’ and the sixteen regions of the liver in Etruscan divination.52 (A bronze model of a liver found at Piacenza, Italy in 1877 has provided much information about this kind of divination.)53 The regions of the liver were assigned to divinities, and also were correlated to the heavens (thus relating to divination by lightning, another Etruscan divi-natory specialty). Both Pliny (HN II, 55.143–144) and Cicero (De div. II, 18.42) speak about the sixteen regions of the heavens, and their attributions in divi-nation by lightning. The division of the sky into sixteen portions is also pecu-liarly Etruscan. Martianus Capella’s list of sixteen regions linked to divinities has been shown to have Etruscan and astrological connotations by both Carl Thulin and Stefan Weinstock.54 (It is interesting for our purposes to note that a number of these are minor divinities who could certainly be classed as the equivalent of daimons, including lares and di manes.) In addition, some of these regions correlate with Manilius’s descriptions of lot places.52 Bouché-Leclercq, AG, 298 n. 2. See also his Histoire de la divination dans l’antiquité, 4 vols. (Paris: E.

Still other portions of both the Piacenza liver (especially when one consid-ers the orientation of the liver) and Martianus Capella’s list may correspond to Manilius’s twelve-part place scheme from the Ascendant, and to his ‘octo-tropos’. Manilius seems to make a synthesis of several different systems here, creating his own personal system by combining Hellenistic astrological doc-trines with Etruscan divinatory ones. As far as the connection between liver divination and astrology in general goes, let us just remark that the Babylonian ‘horoscopes’ also have some commonalities with Babylonian extispicy texts.58Manilius finishes with careful instructions on how to calculate the Lot based on the sect of the chart (3.176–200).59 Whether the chart is diurnal or noctur-nal (thus changing the lot formula) is an important criterion.2.2 Paulus, Olympiodorus and the ‘Hermetic’ LotsPossibly because his descriptions of the lots are so clear, Paulus (along with his commentator Olympiodorus) is the Hellenistic astrologer most often quoted by secondary sources on lot doctrine.60 We learn from Paulus that the ‘plan-etary’ lots described in Rhetorius’s excerpt of Antiochus’s Thesaurus (whose words appear in Paulus as well; see Appendix 8.B) come from a book called the Panaretus (‘All-Virtue’), ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus. (The names used for the planetary lots also, strangely, figure in a list of decans in Cosmas of Jerusalem: see Chapter Six, 4.8.) Paulus gives their formulae.61 Each of the seven lots so described is formed by the arcs between their respective planets taken either from the Lot of Fortune or the Lot of Daimon.58 See F. Rochberg, Babylonian Horoscopes, TAPS, vol. 88, part 1 (Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1998), 16.59 Bouché-Leclercq, AG, 289 and n. 4, seems to think that Manilius had one formula for both the day and night positions of the Lot of Fortune, or that both of his formulae pro-duced the same place for the lot. I disagree; I think Manilius 1) would not have men-tioned two methods if two positions were not going to result and 2) is clear in his wording that two places for the lot, differentiated by night and day, are meant. Goold, in his expla-nation of the Lots (Manilius, Astronomica, pp. lxv–lxviii), interprets Manilius correctly. Dora Liuzzi has followed the (incorrect) reasoning of Bouché-Leclercq in her commen-tary on Manilius Book III; see M. Manilius, M. Manilio Astronomica libro terzo, ed. and trans.

In another passage, Olympiodorus emphasises the importance of the Lots of Fortune and Daimon by pointing out that unless we know where they fall, we cannot compute any of the other ‘planetary’ lots.65Note, in the table above, that the lots of the malefics, Mars and Saturn, use the Lot of Fortune in their calculation, but the benefics, Venus and Jupiter, use the Lot of Daimon. Mercury’s lot, the Lot of Necessity, also uses the Lot of Fortune. Why might this be the case? Fortune connects to the physical plane and the material world of generation and corruption. Those lots which use it may be seen as connected to the chance happenings over which humans have no control. The malefic planets with Fortune reinforce the difficulty of chang-ing physical circumstances. The lots using Daimon, on the other hand, link with the conscious and the intentional, and the ability of humans to reason. The benefic planets with Daimon reinforce the possibility of choosing inten-tion and free will. The daimon, in its role as a guardian spirit and personal guide, connected to the rational soul and with some access to providence 64 Olympiodorus, ch. 22 (Boer, 46.13–47.5): Εἶτα μετὰ ταύτην τὸν τοῦ Ἀγαθοῦ Δαίμονος, ἐπειδὴ ἤθη ψυχῆς καὶ φρόνησιν καὶ προαίρεσιν ἐκ τούτου δυνάμεθα γινώσκειν, ὥσπερ ἐκ τῆς Τύχης περὶ τοῦ σώματος καὶ τῶν περὶ τὸ σῶμα. περὶ ταῦτα δὲ μάλιστα ἡ μεγίστη μαντεία καταγίνεται τοῦ γνῶναι ἤθη ψυχῆς καὶ διαγωγὴν σώματος, ταὐτὸν δὲ εἰπεῖν, πῶς μὲν ψυχὴ πολιτεύεται κατὰ τὸν τῇδε κόσμον, ἄνωθεν ἐλθοῦσα, πῶς δὲ τὸ σῶμα καὶ τὰ περὶ τὸ σῶμα, καὶ ἁπλῶς εἰπεῖν, πάντα τὰ οὐκ ἐφ’ ἡμῖν ὑπαντήσει. (See also Olympiodorus in Greenbaum, trans., Late Classical Astrology, 103–04.) This passage is filled with Stoic allusions. Note the phrase ‘οὐκ ἐφ’ ἡμῖν’. What is ‘up to us’ is a question long considered in philosophical writings on fate and determinism (we have seen Porphyry’s version). In the Manual of Epictetus, 1, we find: ‘Of all existing things some are in our power [i.e., up to us], and others are not in our power. In our power are thought, impulse, will to get and will to avoid, and, in a word, everything which is our own doing. Things not in our power include the body, property, reputation, office, and in a word, everything which is not our own doing’ (trans. P. E. Matheson in W. J. Oates, ed., The Stoic and Epicurean Philosophers: The Complete Extant Writings of Epicurus, Epictetus, Lucretius, Marcus Aurelius (New York: Random House, 1940), 468). We have seen Porphyry take up this question in light of astrology. See also discussion of this passage in M. Lawrence, ‘The Meaning of Astrology for Late Neoplatonists’.65 Olympiodorus, ch. 22 (Boer, 47.5–10): τούτου χάριν πρὸ πάντων τῶν κλήρων τὸν τοῦ Δαίμονος καὶ τῆς Τύχης κλῆρον ζητητέον. ἀλλὰ μὴν καὶ ἑτέραν αἰτίαν εἶπε, ὅτι διὰ τοῦτο τὸν τοῦ Δαίμονος καὶ τῆς Τύχης κλῆρον δεῖ προεκβάλλειν, ἐπειδὴ ἀπὸ τούτων καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους πάντας ἐκβάλλομεν· οὐκ ἠδυνάμεθα οὖν τούτων μὴ ἐκβληθέντων τοὺς λοιποὺς ἐκβάλλειν.

(For descriptions of these lots in Paulus and Olympiodorus, see Appendix 8.D.) Regarding the Moon’s and Sun’s lots—Fortune and Daimon—let us just say that, since these lots are formed from both the Sun and Moon, they bring in both of those qualities in varying degrees and under different circumstances. For Saturn, the Lot of Nemesis, retribution, has to do with getting what one is due, and with the final allotment, which is death. (Note that Paulus’s formula for this lot is different from the one given by Firmicus.) For Jupiter, the Lot of Victory shows the quality of success, of attainment. For Mars, the Lot of Courage shows boldness but also rashness. For Venus, the Lot of Eros has to do with voluntary associations. Only for Mercury does the Lot of Necessity not seem to correlate well with its planetary attributes. It signifies enemies and constraining circumstances, which do not seem related to anything Mercurial. Olympiodorus strains a little, I think, when he says that ‘since Hermes is lord of reason, and reason is actually necessary, for this reason he [Hermes Trismegistus] called his lot Necessity.’66Giuseppe Bezza has pointed out that in these planetary lots we find the pur-est, most unadulterated expression of that planet, uncontaminated by either the sign, the place in which it falls or its aspects to other planets.67 I would add that unlike the other lots, these lots represent abstract concepts which, though expressed in material outcomes by the astrologers, also take into account states of mind and emotion for the holder of the chart.3 Some ReflectionsThere is a strange consistency in these ‘abstract’ lots: the names given to them are abstract qualities which have been personalised in Greek religion, often as daimons. Walter Burkert tells us that ‘Daimon is the veiled countenance of divine activity.’68 Are these lots ways for the daimonic to show itself in the 66 Olympiodorus, (Boer, 42.22–43.2): . . . ἀλλὰ μὴν ἐπειδὴ καὶ ὁ Ἑρμῆς κύριός ἐστι λόγου, ὁ δὲ λόγος ἀναγκαστικὸς ὑπάρχει, τούτου χάριν Ἀνάγκην ἐκάλεσε τὸν κλῆρον αὐτοῦ. . . . (See also Greenbaum, trans., Late Classical Astrology, 102.) We shall see, in Chapter 10, reasons for the meaning of this lot which have nothing to do with Hermes/Mercury.67 Bezza, AM, vol. 2, 970.68 Burkert, Greek Religion, 180."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8300chart? Tolma, Eros, Ananke, Nike, Nemesis—all have daimonic connections.69 We have seen the odd correlations of the lot places in Manilius with the regions of the sky ascribed to what could be considered daimonic divinities in Martianus Capella. The cults of Agathe Tyche and Agathos Daimon (whose functions as guardians and protectors of humans seem more daimonic than godly) arise in Alexandria and the Greek islands at the same time that Greek astrology is being developed. The lots, in fact, mediate between the gods (plan-ets) and humans (represented by the Ascendant) just as the daimons do.These lots are named for abstractions—emotions, spiritual concepts, philo-sophical ideas, mental states. Daimons named for abstractions might suggest that the states of mind and body so indicated are part of a divine heritage which, like the daimons themselves, links us to the gods. As Burkert says, ‘Daimon does not designate a specific class of divine beings, but a peculiar mode of activity.’70Then there is the idea of the lots as points of personal destiny,71 originating from the first lot, the Lot of Fortune, and the second lot, the Lot of Daimon. Just the names ‘Tyche’ and ‘Daimon’ beg for this correlation to destiny, as do the words κλῆρος and sors. In astrology, the Ascendant provides the personal aspect as a zodiacal translation of the time and place of birth, which math-ematically is far more personal a point in the chart than, say, the Midheaven.72The astrological lots evoke, and translate into an astrological context, the cultural use of lots to allot people jobs in civil government. When Bezza remarks that the lots show the planets in their purest form, what may underlie his think-69 See H. Nowak, Zur Entwicklungsgeschichte des Begriffes Daimon: eine Untersuchung epig-raphischer Zeugnisse vom 5. Jh. v. Chr. bis zum 5. Jh. n. Chr. (Bonn: Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität, 1960), 16–17, for epigraphy which associates some of these names with daimons. Empedocles, Parmenides and Plato also refer to some of these as daimons (see Chapter 10); and see Cosmas of Jerusalem in Chapter 6, 4.8. This would fit with the idea of daimonic power—for instance, the power of courage, love, necessity, etc., repre-senting some kind of divine force.70 Burkert, Greek Religion, 180 (one suspects his view comes from the Hermetic material which associates daimons with energeia). But in Classical and post-Classical Greece, one sees daimons also as specific divine beings, usually expressing abstract concepts or emo-tions. So the concept of daimon becomes more multi-valent.71 Giuseppe Bezza has also put forth this idea, at least for the idea of the lot in general (but with an implication for the astrological lots, it seems to me): see AM, vol. 2, 964: ‘Ma il kleros, per lo più sotto forma di un dischetto o di un ossicino, è anche la sorte che porta con sé la personalità dell’individuo e che una divinità trae, fissandone il destino.’ (‘But the kleros, whether in the form of a sherd or a small bone, is also the lot that carries with itself the personality of the individual and that a divinity casts, securing the destiny.’).72 The Midheaven degree is the same at all latitudes, but the Ascendant degree is based on both longitude and latitude, and both must be considered in calculation."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"Allotment, The Daimon And Astrology 301ing is the idea of the impartiality which casting lots provides. Yet as Plato reminds us, the equality of the lot does not provide proportional justice, a justice based on merit. Is this true in astrology? One could make the case both ways. Even if the Ascendant changes in the chart, as it will depending on the time of day, the distance of the lot from the Ascendant will always be fairly consistent on that day. Yet when we bring in the idea of reversing the day formula at night, we do more to personalise, and therefore take in more particular, merits of the chart. It is also true that the lots are an arithmetical construct, but they are founded on the idea of ratios which are proportional. One could also say that the particular arc between the points in the chart, and the particular Ascendant based on the time and place of birth, do mitigate the idea of complete impartiality: where the lot falls, whether fortunate or unfortunate, is based on the particular cir-cumstances of the chart at birth.Finally, what are we to make of the idea of lots in general, and of all these lots? It may seem as if the imposition of lots upon the chart in addition to planets results in needless clutter and confusion for the chart.73 Certainly much schol-arship seems mystified or disdainful about the multitude of techniques used by the Hellenistic astrologers. But those who belittle the myriad techniques employed by the astrologers and attribute to them an innate confusion and lack of rigour on the part of the astrologer may have missed the point. The astrolo-gers, just as diviners, priests and philosophers, are searching for ways to show the connections between the heavenly and the human, and within the chart to show the power of the gods to influence human lives. The chart as a means of divination depends on having the most options available for interpretation. Lots, in fact, may represent a kind of divinatory ritual translated to the chart.Gods and daimons form a divine network. If the planets themselves do not show a particular outcome in a life, the lots can provide another layer of interpretation for that life, one that may pick up an outcome not seen in the planetary picture alone. Certainly this kind of thinking, this piling of layers of technique on the chart to find answers, can be overblown and overused; multi-ple techniques overwhelm and become meaningless ways to make everything in a life correspond with the stars. It becomes not a reductio but a multiplicatio ad absurdum. The literal and material intrudes on the metaphorical and spiritual. Astrologers are as prone as anyone else to be seduced by the lure of technology.But the use of the chart as a divinatory tool begs for multiple ways of inter-pretation; not everything has meaning, but that one particular thing that is meaningful must be available for the astrologer to see, often in a flash of insight and sense of rightness about the meaningfulness of a particular configuration 73 Other techniques such as dodekatēmoria and monomoiria could also be included."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8302in the chart.74 In the world of daimonic reality, the metaphor is always present. It is as if, in the chart, the meaningful configuration sits quietly waiting to be noticed, and it is the task of the astrologer, with the client’s aid, to find the meaningful interpretation from the (metaphorical) cacophony of sounds or multitude of images that present themselves to ear and eye.The same configuration does not always mean the same thing. (The ancient astrologers acknowledge this.)75 The skill of the astrologer is shown in his abil-ity to find the unique metaphorical symbolism in the multivalency of mean-ings offered by astrological technique.76Here the lots affirm the divinatory origins of astrology. They come from the world of divination, of oracles, of the random toss of the bones that portrays, to those able to see the symbolism, the will of the gods. Yes, they are indeed things ‘for which no cause can be reckoned’.77 That is their fundamental divi-natory function. They are points which cannot be seen, but only created in the mind. Because they are imaginal, not physical, they fall easily into a noumenal and symbolic space where the astrologer, in his interpretation, is able, like the daimon, to mediate between the worlds of gods and humans.74 This kind of insight and sense of rightness is familiar to anyone involved in creative endeavours. As Patrick Harpur remarks in his book Daimonic Reality: Understanding Otherworld Encounters (London: Arkana Penguin, 1995), 250, ‘. . . every scholar, for instance, knows how the very book he requires can fall off a library shelf at his feet!’ Also see M. Gladwell, Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking (New York: Little, Brown & Company, 2005), esp. 107, 179–84. Gladwell calls the ability to synthesise and make judge-ments in an instant ‘thin-slicing’.75 For example, see Valens IV, 11.54 (Pingree, 168.1–2): ἐπεὶ γὰρ δὴ δωδεκαετίας αἱ αὐταὶ παραδόσεις σημαίνονται, οὐ τὴν αὐτὴν ἐνέργειαν τῶν ἀποτελεσμάτων ἐφέξουσιν ἀλλὰ διάφορον. ‘In fact, when the same handings over in a twelve-year period are interpreted, they will not possess the same actuality of outcomes, but different.’76 T. Barton, ‘Augustus and Capricorn: Astrological Polyvalency and Imperial Rhetoric’, JRS 85 (1995): 33–51, here 39, acknowledges this multivalency. She makes insightful state-ments like ‘a competent astrologer would improvise creatively’ and ‘[Astrology] com-bined familiar, very rich symbols in new ways, so that a complex network of signs could be created’ with ‘enough density for astrological symbols to be read at different levels by different audiences’. Yet she still refers to the abundance of astrological techniques as an ‘accretion of doctrines’, and remarks that astrologers did not worry about ‘contradictions’. In fact, the astrologer sorts through possibilities and applies the symbolism that is right at that particular place of interpretation. See G.

Additional connections are presented in this chapter, which explores the technique and tradition of the Lots of Fortune and Daimon in Hellenistic astrology. This chapter will look not only at the various uses of these lots by Hellenistic astrologers, but also keep in mind the philosophical and religious underpinnings behind fortune and daimon. Are these underpinnings reflected in their astrological use, and are the links between fortune and daimon sus-tained in their use as astrological lots? Can the astrological lots enhance our understanding of the way that Fortune and Daimon were perceived in the Empire and Late Antiquity? This chapter will investigate these issues. In this investigation, we should not forget that the Lots of Fortune and Daimon are closely linked through the way in which they are calculated, so that they become mirror images of each other in the chart. This entwine-ment may have implications for what they mean, how they are used, and why there has been confusion in finding the ‘correct’ calculation for them. They are the first pair of lots to be linked in this way;2 that their names correlate to 1 ‘Daimōn kai Tuchē (Endowment and Chance) determine a man’s fate—rarely or never one of these powers alone.’ English translation in S. Freud, ‘The Dynamics of Transference’, in The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, vol. XII, ed. James Strachey, et al.

While properly speaking ‘Endowment’ does not exactly translate ‘daimon’ (the daimon ‘endows’; it is not the endowment itself ), by the use of the word ‘endowment’ a distinction is being made here between several concepts: nature vs. nurture, talent vs. luck, the innate vs. the external.

Of the seven ‘Hermetic lots’3 (the so-called planetary lots),4 the Lot of Fortune, followed by the Lot of Daimon, are used the most frequently in astro-logical technique. The philosophical link between the daimon and lots is amply demonstrated in Plato, as we saw in Chapter Eight. Fortune has a similar connection to lots. The cultural and historical uses of Tyche and Daimon sup-ply some reasons why the Lots of Fortune and Daimon become important in Hellenistic astrology. That importance will be established by examining some of the history of their use in extant charts, investigating the formulae with which they are calculated and the techniques employing them. This examina-tion may also shed some astrological light on the concept of lots and daimons in other contexts. The Lot of Fortune is by far the lot most used in interpretation. It is men-tioned by almost every Hellenistic astrologer. Of the 326 extant Greek charts,5 88 (plus two)6 calculate the Lot of Fortune. The Lot of Daimon is second, with 33.7 (See my article for the extant charts containing these lots.)83 See the previous chapter.4 Paulus associates one lot with each of the seven classical planets (including the luminaries). I use the phrase ‘so-called’ because in other authors the formulae for some of these lots do not use planets.5 This sum includes the 23 charts in Vettius Valens, Anthology VIII, 7 and 8, which do not appear in the literary section of Greek Horoscopes (but are mentioned on 180–81). I have drawn from the collections in GH; Jones, APO; D. Baccani, Oroscopi greci: documentazione papirologica (Messina: Sicania, 1992); T. de Jong and K. A. Worp, ‘A Greek Horoscope from 373 AD.’ ZPE 106 (1995): 235–40; and T. de Jong and K. A. Worp, ‘More Greek Horoscopes from Kellis (Dakhleh Oasis)’, ZPE 137 (2001): 203–14. Some of these charts are quite fragmen-tary. I also include a newly-discovered chart (in February 2009, by Alexander Jones) which contains the calculations of all seven ‘Hermetic’ lots.6 I have also included one Demotic (Egyptian) chart and one chart of Dorotheus which, though extant only in the Arabic translation, can be supposed to have originally been in Greek. Both are included because they may include the Lot of Fortune.7 Two charts, both in GH, nos 95 and 137, also calculate lots. No. 95 mentions three klēroi, one of which is called ‘Agathos Daimon’ and another ‘concerning death’, yet I am not convinced that these refer to lots as we know them per se, but may refer to places from the Ascendant as ‘allotments’ of different facets of life (perhaps there is a connection with Demotic tny.t, ‘part’, used of places in Ostracon 3, ll. 14–18, 20 [in Neugebauer, ‘Demotic Horoscopes’, 116–17]). No. 137 claims to calculate two different lots of Fortune, yet neither conforms to a recognised formula. Again, these may refer to places, the 2nd and the 8th, rather than lots (the ‘lots’ fall in Capricorn and Cancer, the 2nd and 8th places respectively). Also in Ostracon 3, ll. 13 and 19 (116–17), we find the 2nd and 8th places called ‘the provision of life’ and ‘the provision of"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":" 305Endowment and Chance1 The Lots and their Luminaries8The lots are calculated using the positions of the luminaries, the Sun and the Moon. The Moon is associated with the body, and the Sun with the mind, the soul and spirit. By a certain amount of assimilation, the two lots also gain these associations. The Moon is traditionally the boundary between heaven and earth—the ‘sublunary sphere’ as opposed to the celestial home of the gods. Daimons are also associated with the Moon, e.g. in Plutarch, where they are said to live on the Moon,9 the better to keep an eye on the affairs of humans. The Moon is also the traditional planet associated with Fortune, as it is a literal representation of the changeability of life with its cycles of waxing and waning. Firmicus says of the Moon: ‘. . . enduring in the manifold variety of her course . . . she procreates all the bodies and conceptions of living things and dissolves them when they have been generated’.10 Valens writes: ‘For cos-mically the Moon is fortune and body and breath, and since she is close to the earth and sends her effluence into us, she brings about something similar as she has authority over our body.’11 The Sun, on the other hand, is connected to the Daimon, in that it is meta-phorically associated with mind and spirit. As Valens says, ‘the all-seeing Sun, being fiery and a light of the mind, instrument of the soul’s sense-perception, signifies . . . intelligence, practical and intentional mind . . .’.12 And, he adds, ‘The Sun, which is cosmically mind and daimon on account of his own activity and lovely nature, stirring up human souls for undertakings, is established as a cause of action and movement.’13 death’; something similar may be occurring here.

Even though they are treated as ‘planets’ in astrology,15 they are also set apart from the other five visible planets—at least partially—because of the light they give.

In Valens, the lots are used both in elab-orate time-lord systems and in the predictive technique known as profections. (We shall survey these systems later in this chapter.) In Manilius and in Valens, the Lot of Fortune and places from it have much interpretive significance. In Paulus Alexandrinus and Olympiodorus, his commentator, Fortune and Daimon are listed first in the chapters on lots; indeed, Olympiodorus points out that they are crucial to the creation of the other planetary lots. 2 Calculating the Lots of Fortune and DaimonIn the formulae for the Lots of Fortune and Daimon, we know that, except for Ptolemy, virtually all Hellenistic astrologers take the sect of the chart into account. For the Lot of Fortune, they take the arc from Sun to Moon in a diur-nal chart, and the arc from Moon to Sun in a nocturnal one, and project this arc from the Ascendant to find the position of the lot.19 We can state this math-ematically as:Asc + Moon − Sun (D) or Asc + Sun − Moon (N)16 GH, 164.17 Ross, ‘Horoscopic Ostraca from Medînet Mâdi’, 24–25.18 The Babylonian Moon god was considered to be of primary importance, which is prob-ably why the Moon is listed first. The extant chart listings can be found in Rochberg, Babylonian Horoscopes. While there is no reason to believe that the order will change in charts discovered in the future, it is likely that more Babylonian horoscopes will be discovered, considering the large amount of unpublished and only partially catalogued cuneiform tablets. For example, Francesca Rochberg has told me (personal communica-tion, 7 May 2007) of a newly-found duplicate of Text 9, the horoscope of Anu-bēlšunu, in Babylonian Horoscopes, 79–81. 19 For a discussion of one extant chart which seems not to do this, see D.

In addition, they are linked mathematically via their equal pro-portion from the Ascendant. The Lot of Fortune is called the ‘archetypal’ lot in Valens and Serapion,20 while the Lot of Daimon is the ‘second’ lot.21 In Olympiodorus’s Commentary on Paulus, recall (Chapter Eight, 2.2, 297–98) that he says, referring to the Lots of Fortune and Daimon, ‘Especially concern-ing these things, the greatest power of divination abides with knowing the 20 Valens: II, 13.1 (Pingree, 65.5): . . . τὸν ἀρχέτυπον κλῆρον. . . .

This is the Lot of Basis, or Foundation, used in the ‘Investigation of Chart Factors’ (Ἐπίσκεψις πινακική) of Rhetorius,23 in Antiochus/Rhetorius (Paulus)24 and by Firmicus Maternus.25 Vettius Valens gives the most thorough treatment. Its kinship can be seen immediately by its formula, which uses the lots of both Fortune and Daimon in its calculation. The formula is given in Valens, II, 23, in a rather difficult passage, unfortunately: . . . and likewise from the Lot of Basis (which is found from Fortune to Daimon and from Daimon to Fortune, and the equal amount from the Hour-marker; yet it will not carry over the seventh number for both night and day [nativities], but one must cast out from the nearer lot to the other lot). . . .26 22 Olympiodorus, ch. 22 (Boer, 46.16–47.2; 47.5–6): . . . περὶ ταῦτα δὲ μάλιστα ἡ μεγίστη μαντεία καταγίνεται τοῦ γνῶναι ἤθη ψυχῆς καὶ διαγωγὴν σώματος. . . . . . . πρὸ πάντων τῶν κλήρων τὸν τοῦ Δαίμονος καὶ τῆς Τύχης κλῆρον ζητητέον.23 Rhetorius 54 (Pingree, 39.5–6 = CCAG VIII/4, 120.27–28): . . . δέον ζητεῖν τὸν κλῆρον τῆς τύχης καὶ τοῦ δαίμονος καὶ τῆς βάσεως. . . .

See full quotation in n. 30.25 Firmicus, Mathesis, VI, 32.56.26 II, 23.7 (Pingree, 84.2–6): . . . ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ τὸν κλῆρον τῆς βάσεως (ὃς εὑρίσκεται ἀπὸ τύχης ἐπὶ δαίμονα καὶ ἀπὸ δαίμονος ἐπὶ τύχην, καὶ τὰ ἴσα ἀπὸ ὡροσκόπου· τὸν μέντοι ἑβδομαδικὸν ἀριθμὸν οὐχ ὑπερθήσει ἐπί τε τῶν νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας, ἀλλὰ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐγγίονος κλήρου ἐπὶ τὸν ἕτερον κλῆρον δεῖ λαμβάνειν). . .. Neugebauer and Van Hoesen, GH, 9, think the formula is a straightforward reversal of Fortune and Daimon by night and day. Some other Hellenistic authors use this formula (e.g., Olympiodorus, ch. 22, Boer, 58.21 and 60.3–5; Firmicus, VI, 32.56), but Valens clearly qualifies the first statement he makes about it, and those qualifi-ers cannot be dismissed. (The passage is the same, save for some parentheses, in both the Kroll and Pingree editions of Valens.)"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"310chapter 9The meaning seems to be that one uses the shorter arc between Fortune and Daimon,27 but projects always in zodiacal order from the Ascendant.28 Using the shorter arc will ensure that the Lot of Basis will always fall below the hori-zon, which makes symbolic sense as it is the lot of foundations (the fourth place, at the bottom of the chart, is also known as a foundation).29 As for what the lot shows, Antiochus (Paulus)/Rhetorius says ‘The Hour-marker’s Lot—the Lot of Basis—is established as responsible for life and breath; for Basis itself is the giver of breath for the Hōroskopos, and signifies bodily things and living abroad.’30 It is perhaps significant that this Lot is tied to the Hour-marker and underlies its expression. The Lot of Basis, bound, so to speak, with the Lots of Fortune and Daimon, is delineated with them as indicative of fame and fortune in Valens (see exam-ples below). The Lot of Basis is also related by its formula to two other lots as Valens calculates them, those of Eros and Necessity. The position of Basis will be identical to one or the other of them. 4 The Lots in Interpretation: DescriptionsIn the Carmen Astrologicum, Dorotheus devotes I, 26 to the Lot of Fortune and its interpretation. The previous few chapters dealt with the effect of the Sun and Moon, and their triplicity lords, on fortune; this chapter is the capstone 27 ‘Carry over the seventh number’ must refer to an arc larger than 180 degrees. I follow the analysis of Robert Hand, Vettius Valens, Anthology Book II, Part 1, trans. Robert Schmidt, Robert Hand ed. (Berkeley Springs, WV: Golden Hind Press, 1994), 43, n. 1.28 With other lots that reverse the positions in the formula, the arc always goes in zodia-cal order, but the reversal creates a shorter arc in one instance and a longer arc in the other. Different positions are obtained by projecting each arc in zodiacal order from the Ascendant. (Geometrically, one can take the shorter arc in all cases, but project from the Ascendant in different directions; but this is not the way Hellenistic astrologers explain it, though there may be an instance of the implicit application of this procedure in Valens IX, 2.5, 7: see below, Section 7.)29 See Paulus (Boer, 56.5), Olympiodorus (Boer, 65.15), Dorotheus (Pingree, 382.4–5), Rhetorius, CCAG VIII/4, 148.26–149.1 (the word used is θεμέλιον, which LSJ, s.v., translates as ‘foundation’). Yet in Paulus (Boer, 49.15–16) and Olympiodorus (Boer, 56.22–23), the Hour-marker is also called ‘basis’, the base or foundation of the chart. Perhaps there is a connection here between the beginning of life (the Hour-marker) and its end (the fourth); both places are thus ‘foundational’.30 Antiochus (Paulus)/Rhetorius, CCAG I, 160.16–18: ὡροσκόπου ὁ κλῆρος τῆς βάσεως ζωῆς καὶ πνεύματος παραίτιος καθέστηκεν· αὐτὴ γὰρ ἡ βασις πνεύματός ἐστι δοτικὴ τοῦ ὡροσκόπου καὶ τὰ σωματικὰ καὶ τὰς ξενιτείας σημαίνει."},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":" 311Endowment and Chanceon how to find fortune in a nativity. Dorotheus tells us to look at the Lot if the lords of the luminaries are in bad condition. His method of interpretation is the usual one: look at where the lot falls, its aspects from benefic or malefic planets, and the lord of the lot and its condition. The best indication of fortune and property, he says, is if the lord of the Lot of Fortune is dignified, either by house, triplicity, exaltation or bound. He does not give any charts as examples in this chapter. In I, 24 (on fortune and property in the nativity), Dorotheus presents one chart which mentions the ‘fortune’ (Pingree, 185). This probably means the eleventh place, although it could refer to the Lot of Fortune because the chart is diurnal, and using a diurnal formula the Lot would fall where he says ‘fortune’ is located (see discussion in Chapter Two, 2.4 and Fig. 2.2).31 Antiochus of Athens gives only descriptions, not examples, of the effects of the Lots of Fortune and Daimon (See Appendix 8.B). These appear in Chapter 48 of his Thesaurus. The effects often have to do with banishment, injury or violent death. Only one condition is fortunate: ‘When Zeus is beholding the Lot of Daimon, it makes such a one receive divine revelation from gods and dreams and will have all divine favours, even if [Zeus beholds it] by square or opposition.’32 In the circumstances when malefics aspect the lots, madness results; and when they are with the new or full moon and oppose the lords of the lots, ‘braggarts and insolent people.’33 Firmicus considers sect in his formulae for the Lots of Fortune and Daimon, and is careful to give instructions on calculating the lots either by sign (platice) or by degree (partiliter). (For a complete translation of Firmicus on this sub-ject, see Appendix 9.A). In each of his lot descriptions, we can see how they are linked together in his mind:[The Lot of Fortune] <5.> From this place [where the Lot of Fortune is] is said to be shown the quality of life, the father’s estate, and the course of both happiness and unhappiness. The quality of love, also, and the affec-tions of husbands toward wives is learnt from this place.

(But a Greek parallel uses ἐν τῷ ιαʹ instead of ‘good fortune’ [Dorotheus V, 17 ap.

Interestingly, he uses the word substantia in connec-tion with both lots.Finally, there is a rather strange melothesia in Valens II, 37, in which he describes the assignment of body parts to the Lots of Fortune and Daimon.38 (See Appendix 9.B.) The assignments from the Lot of Fortune start from the breast, and seem to connect to Cancer; while those from the Lot of Daimon start from the heart, associated with Leo. This is because, Valens says, the ‘Moon is the Fortune of the cosmos, and the Sun is mind and Daimon.’39 Wolfgang Hübner has noticed that the outer parts of the body are assigned to the Lot of Fortune, and the inner parts to the Lot of Daimon.40 The Moon and Fortune represent what can be seen from the outside, but the Sun and Daimon that which is hidden, on the inside.41 Valens attributes this system to the ‘ancients’ but adds that his experience has allowed him also to show what 36 Ibid., IV.18.2 (KSZ, I, 242.21–28 = Monat, II, 178): ‘Hic locus vocatur et animae substantia; ex hoc loco actus omnisque augmenta substantiae quaerimus [invenimus], et ostendit, qua-lis circa virum mulieris sit adfectus.

Fortune, he says, brings about injuries (determined from its sign), while Daimon (and its sign) brings about diseases. Eleven charts illustrate these principles. Antiochus may have drawn on a similar doctrine when he gave his descriptions of injury and illness from the Lots of Fortune and Daimon.42 Why are injuries ascribed to the Lot of Fortune, while illnesses are the prov-ince of the Lot of Daimon? It may be because an injury usually has an iden-tifiable cause outside oneself. It is an obvious assault on the body. An illness, however, is not so easily assigned a physical cause, although the role of exter-nal factors in affecting a person’s health was recognised in antiquity (e.g. the six non-naturals);43 the prevailing Hippocratic and Galenic tradition would say it was an imbalance of humours. In addition, diseases, both mental and phys-ical, were sometimes seen as being caused by evil daimons (as we have seen). Both physical and mental illness are assigned to the Lot of Daimon. These lots, joining Sun, Moon and Ascendant, become a potent force for affecting body and mind.5 The Lots in Interpretation: Case StudiesSome case studies will illustrate the use of the lots in practice.

Chapters in Book II focus on the lots in relation to happiness (eudaimonia, literally ‘having a good daimon’), and introduce the idea of using the Lot of Fortune as an Ascendant (ὡροσκόπος: ‘Hour-marker’). We have seen (Chapter Eight) the Lot of Fortune used as an Hour-marker in Manilius’s ‘Circle of Athla’ (3.96–168), and the ‘lot’ places’ possible connec-tions to liver divination and katarchic astrology. Valens, too, creates a system of places from lots, describing those from the Lot of Fortune in some detail (II, 18, 20, 21). In both Manilius and Valens, the eleventh place from Fortune is seen as particularly beneficial (is this because it is analogous to the place of the Good Daimon?). Valens emphasises that the Lot of Fortune is equal in power to the Hour-marker (Ascendant).52 He also quotes an interesting passage which he does not specifically ascribe to anyone:53 . . . from which they prognosticate in their works, saying: ‘in varying fig-ures when the Lot is allotted the authority of the centrepins, neither the tropical, nor solid, nor bi-corporeal [signs] will possess the same power throughout. And so one must also look at the stars which are witnessing or co-present in relation to the lot, so that if a benefic is in this [place where the lot is], or witnessing it, it becomes predictive of good things and a giver of possessions. But if a causer of destruction [i.e. a malefic], it the synastry between marriage partners in Book III, chapters 9 and 10, he makes several references to just ‘the lot’ (Pingree, 262–63, 265), and obviously means the Lot of Fortune.51 Micah Ross and I have discussed these possibilities, personal communications, 24–30 April and 20–22 May 2007.52 See especially II, 18.5 (Pingree, 76.13–18), where he equates the Lot with the Hour-marker, and its squares and oppositions with the Midheaven, Underground and Setting places.53 Kroll, the previous editor of Valens, suggests ‘they’ are Nechepso and Petosiris (Vettius Valens, Anthologiarum libri, ed. Wilhelm Kroll, (Berlin: Weidmann, 1908), 79, app. crit., line 27 (Book II, 17): ‘Nechepso et Petosiris, ut opinor’). Riess does not include it in his fragments of Nechepso and Petosiris published in 1892. The use of the word μυστικῶς in the previous sentence, though, might well obliquely refer to Nechepso and Petosiris."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"318chapter 9will become a cause of a loss of possessions and of the body wasting aw ay.’54So the Lot of Fortune is specifically given the same authority and effective power as the centrepins formed from the Ascendant (the Lots of Fortune, Daimon, Eros and Necessity are given like power in Book IV, 11). Valens gives six examples of this technique.55 This is L82 in Greek Horoscopes, dated 9 July 82 CE, about noon.54 Valens, II, 18.7–8 (Pingree, 76.20–27): ὅθεν καὶ ἐν τοῖς συντάγμασι προδηλοῦσι λέγοντες· ‘ἐν δὲ ἑτεροτρόποις σχήμασι τῶν κέντρων τοῦ κλήρου τὴν δυναστείαν λαχόντος, καὶ οὔτε μὴν διὰ παντὸς τὰ τροπικὰ οὔτε τὰ στερεὰ οὔτε τὰ δίσωμα τὴν αὐτὴν δύναμιν ἐφέξει. δεῖ οὖν καὶ τὰς μαρτυρίας τῶν ἀστέρων ἢ συμπαρουσίας θεωρεῖν τὰς πρὸς τὸν κλῆρον ἵν’ εἰ μὲν ἀγαθοποιὸς ἐπὶ τούτῳ ἐπείη ἢ καὶ τῷδε μαρτυρήσῃ, προδηλωτικὸς ἀγαθῶν καὶ δοτὴρ ὑπαρχόντων γένηται· εἰ δὲ φθοροποιός, ἀποβολῆς ὑπαρχόντων καὶ φθίσεως σώματος αἴτιος γενήσεται.55 Other examples delineating the 11th place from Fortune as a place of acquisition (all in II, 22) are sentences 2–9 (= L50 in GH); 17–20 (= L83); 36–37 (= L65,X); 38–39 (= L105); and 40–42 (= L61,V).Figure 9.3 Chart using places from the Lot of Fortune."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":" 319Endowment and ChanceAnother.

This nativity became brilliant and remarkable; for he was entrusted with royal offices and deemed worthy of a high priesthood. For the lord of the triplicity was found with the lord of the [Lot of ] Daimon, in the place of the Good Daimon and with the Lot of Fortune, and the Sun, culminating, was allot-ted the Lot, and the lady of the exaltation, the Moon, was culminating with respect to the Lot. But the acquisition was irregular and unstable, sometimes quite abundant, sometimes insufficient; for Kronos and Aphrodite witnessed the place.56The positions of Fortune and Daimon are not given, but Fortune is in Leo, and Daimon is in Sagittarius. These accord with the daytime formulae. The lord of Fortune is the Sun; the lord of Daimon, Jupiter. Jupiter and Mars are found together in the place of the Good Daimon (Valens deems Mars the triplicity lord), and the Lot of Fortune is also there. Fortune’s ruler, the Sun, is in the Midheaven with the Lot of Exaltation. Exaltation’s lady, the Moon, is in a tenth place position from the Lot of Fortune. All this denotes the brilliance of the nativity. As far as acquisition goes, however, things are not so rosy, because the eleventh place from Fortune, Gemini, is squared by Saturn in Pisces and Venus in Virgo. What the Lots giveth, the Lots taketh away. Valens weaves his interpretation of the lots together to give the picture of the native.5.3 Case Study Number Three: Places from the Lot of DaimonIn an example in V, 6, Valens uses the Lot of Daimon as an Ascendant in his chart interpretation (this is number L123 in GH). . . . for the Lot of Fortune was in Aries, but the lord of the exaltation for the nativity, the Sun, was found culminating with respect to the Lot [of Fortune], and Ares [culminating] with respect to the [Lot of ] Daimon. . . . 56 Valens, II, 22.26–29 (Pingree, 81.16–24): Ἄλλη.

Mercury in Sagittarius rules the Lot of Daimon in Gemini, and indeed opposes the Lot. The ‘intellectual place’ could be interpreted in two ways: where the Lot of Daimon falls is an ‘intellectual place’, or the Good Daimon place is ‘intellectual’ (both places are ruled by Mercury, so we cannot tell which is meant).But why create, so to speak, a second Hour-marker and set of delineations about its places? The reason for this may be in the particularity and individu-alisation that the lots represent in the chart, versus the universal and general 57 Valens, V, 6.119–125 (Pingree, 219.22–220.11), esp. 6.124–125, (Pingree, 220.3–5, 10–11): ἦν γὰρ ὁ κλῆρος τῆς τύχης Κριῷ, τοῦ δὲ ὑψώματος κατὰ τὴν γένεσιν κύριος ὁ Ἥλιος εὑρέθη μεσουρανῶν κατὰ τὸν κλῆρον καὶ Ἄρης κατὰ τὸν δαίμονα. . . . καὶ γὰρ ὁ κύριος τοῦ δαίμονος καὶ τοῦ διανοητικοῦ τόπου Ἑρμῆς ἑαυτῷ ἠναντιώθη (τουτέστι τοῖς Διδύμοις).Figure 9.4 Chart using places from the Lot of Daimon."},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":" 321Endowment and Chanceposition of the planets in the zodiac. When Valens talks about lot places from Fortune, he says that ‘some have mystically laid down the universal Hour-marker and its squares as the cosmic centrepins (kentra), but the Lot and its squares as the genethlialogical centrepins.’58 The Lot of Fortune, representing the body and material existence, becomes a useful point from which to deter-mine things which happen in the ‘real’ world. Also, as an astrological represent-ative of Tyche, it can show specifically the way in which the native is affected by the ‘slings and arrows of outrageous fortune’, what happens by chance.The Lot of Daimon, on the other hand, though it is used as an Ascendant only in that one example in Valens, shows the particular way that the native makes use of the cards she has been dealt in the real world: the ‘things to do with the soul, actions, reputations and character’,59 in other words, the con-scious, even intentional, reactions one makes as a result of the things that happen to one. This could be a decision, perhaps, to make the best of a bad situation or, more negatively, to react in a way that will bring something more unpleasant down the road. More of this will be seen in predictive techniques using the Lots of Fortune and Daimon, as in the next case.5.4 Case Study Number Four: Aphesis from the Lots of Fortune and DaimonSeveral chapters in Book IV lay out the use of the Lots of Fortune and Daimon in prediction. (II, 30.5–6 anticipates the technique later discussed comprehen-sively in Book IV.) Chapters 4–10 outline an elaborate time-lord system (the assignment of a particular planet to rule a certain period in the native’s life) using the Lots of Fortune and Daimon as ‘releasers’ (aphetēs)60 for assigning different zodiac signs and their rulers to different periods of life, in order to make predictions about those periods. The periods ruled by different planets can show the astrologer which times in the native’s life are going to be difficult, either in matters concerning the body (for Fortune) or those concerning the actions one takes and one’s subsequent reputation as a result (for Daimon). Each planet is assigned to a specific period of life. How do we know which planet rules the first period (and how long is that period)? We look at the zodiac sign of the Lot of Fortune (or Daimon), and the lord, or ruler, of that 58 Valens, II, 18.6 (Pingree, 76.18–20): ὑφίστανται γὰρ τινες μυστικῶς τὸν μὲν καθολικὸν ὡροσκόπον καὶ τὰ τούτου τετράγωνα κοσμικὰ κέντρα, τὸν δὲ κλῆρον καὶ τὰ τούτου τετράγωνα γενεθλιαλογικὰ κέντρα.59 Rhetorius, ‘Investigation of Chart Factors’, CCAG VIII/4, 122.22–23: . . . τὰ ψυχικὰ καὶ τὰς πράξεις καὶ τὰς δόξας καὶ τὸν τρόπον.

The length of the period is based on the amount of years assigned to that planet.61 Each major period is divided into sub-periods, each with a sub-ruler, who is actually in charge of the day-to-day outcomes of the period in question, while the major ruler gives the general flavour of the period. So, for example, if the major period zodiac sign is Sagittarius, the ruler, Jupiter, would rule overall for twelve years. But those twelve years would be divided up amongst each of the other planets (beginning with the major ruler), giving each the number of its years, but in months. So Sagittarius-Jupiter would be the sub-ruler of the first twelve months, Capricorn-Saturn twenty-seven months, Aquarius-Saturn thirty months, Pisces-Jupiter twelve months, Aries-Mars fifteen months, and so on until the twelve years is filled up. Any planets falling in those signs, or aspecting them, would be considered important to the outcome. (For a table of the planetary years of the major period lords, and the months of the sub-period lords, see Appendix 9.C.)After explaining this in more detail than I have done here, Valens gives a long example (L75 in GH),62 in which he delineates outcomes from both Fortune and Daimon. The chart is depicted in Figure 9.5.63Valens tells us that, because of the position of the Lot of Fortune, his client died of a cough at the age of sixty-nine, when Sagittarius was the major ruler of the period, but Saturn there made this a difficult time (and the ruler of the Lot was in Cancer, which he says rules the throat). Via the Lot of Daimon, he was in an Aquarius period, with Mars squaring and Mercury opposing, and the benefics were in aversion, so he lost the trusts and acquisitions he had gained in the previous period; when he died he was in a Sagittarius-Jupiter sub-period, Jupiter being retrograde and in fall in Capricorn.Valens’ long delineation shows that he is combining effects from both the Lots of Fortune and Daimon to explain all the circumstances, both physical and mental, which led to the client’s death. Effectively, the linkages between the lots are difficult to separate, as both outcomes influence each other.61 Valens uses the minor periods (least years) of each planet: 30 years for Saturn (though for Capricorn he uses 27 years), 12 years for Jupiter, 15 years for Mars, 19 years for the Sun, 8 years for Venus, 20 years for Mercury and 25 years for the Moon. Most are based on recurrence cycles with the Sun. For more on planetary years see Bouché-Leclercq, AG, 409–10; Holden, History of Horoscopic Astrology, 89, 93; J. Tester, A History of Western Astrology (Woodbridge, Suffolk: The Boydell Press, 1987, repr. 1996), 86–87; GH, 10–11.

He devotes an entire chapter (25) to outcomes determined using four lots, Fortune, Daimon, Eros and Necessity as profected points. Here are those for the Lots of Fortune and Daimon:64 Valens, IV, 11.6, (Pingree, 163.13).65 This is a common predictive technique. As well as by Valens, it is given a para-graph by Ptolemy, Tetrabiblos IV, 10.20 (Hübner, 355.837–39): τοὺς . . . χρονοκράτορας ληψόμεθα . . . τοὺς δ’ ἐνιαυσίους ἐκβάλλοντες τὸ πλῆθος τῶν ἀπὸ τῆς γενέσεως ἐτῶν. . . . ‘We will find . . . the yearly lords by casting out the multitude of years from the birth . . .’.

When he was nineteen, the native managed to avoid permanent trouble because Venus in the powerful first place, and Jupiter and the Sun (ruler of the Lot of Exaltation), in the tenth place from Fortune, were able to prevail over Mars, ruler of the Lot of Fortune. In addition, Mars was in the tenth place from the Lot of Daimon. However, when this same set of profections came around again, when he was thirty-one (‘in his 32nd year’), he was not so fortunate. Now, Valens emphasises that the Lot of Daimon has profected to a ‘decline’ (the third, Capricorn), ruled by Saturn. Saturn, though in a good position in the Midheaven, is opposed to the ‘acquisitive place’ (the 72 Valens V, 6.121–125 (Pingree, 219.25–220.11): <121> ὀρχηστὴς ὤν, διὰ στάσιν ὄχλων τῷ κʹ ἔτει ἐν συνοχῇ γενόμενος καὶ ἀπολογηθεὶς ἡγεμόνι, διὰ φίλων βοήθειαν καὶ ὄχλων δέησιν ἀπολυθείς, ἐνδοξότερος ἐγένετο. <122> ἦν μὲν γὰρ ἡ παράδοσις τοῦ ἔτους ἀπὸ Κρόνου καὶ Σελήνης ἐπὶ Ἄρεα καὶ τὸν αἰτιατικὸν τόπον, καὶ ἀπὸ Διὸς καὶ [ἀπὸ] Ἡλίου ὄντων ἐν τῷ περὶ ἐξουσίας τόπῳ ἐπὶ Κρόνον καὶ Σελήνην ὄντας <ἐν> τῷ μεσουρανήματι καὶ πρακτικῷ τόπῳ· ἄλλως τε καὶ κατὰ τὴν [διὰ η] διὰ δ αἵρεσιν σημαίνει ἀπὸ Κρόνου καὶ Σελήνης ἐπὶ Ἀφροδίτην καὶ ὡροσκόπον, ἵνα γένηται ἡ στάσις καὶ φιλονεικία καὶ ἀντιζηλία διὰ τὴν πρᾶξιν, καὶ ἀπὸ Ἑρμοῦ δ’ ἐπὶ Ἄρεα καὶ τὸν αἰτιατικὸν τόπον. <123> πάντες οὖν οἱ ἀστέρες τῷ κʹ ἔτει ἐχρημάτισαν· εὐλαβήθη ἡ γένεσις περὶ καθαιρέσεως δόξης καὶ περὶ καταδίκης καὶ πνευματικοῦ κινδύνου. <124> Ἀφροδίτης δὲ εὑρεθείσης ἐν τῷ ὡροσκόπῳ καὶ <Ἄρεως> ἐν τῷ αἰτιατικῷ καὶ Διὸς σὺν Ἡλίῳ, εὐφαντασίωτον τὴν ἀπόλυσιν ἔσχε καὶ περὶ τὴν πρᾶξιν εὐημέρησεν· ἦν γὰρ καὶ ὁ κλῆρος τῆς τύχης Κριῷ, τοῦ δὲ ὑψώματος κατὰ τὴν γένεσιν κύριος ὁ Ἥλιος εὑρέθη μεσουρανῶν κατὰ τὸν κλῆρον καὶ Ἄρης κατὰ τὸν δαίμονα. <125> ἐξ ὑστέρου τῷ λβʹ ἔτει τιμῆς καὶ δόξης καὶ βίου καθαιρεθεὶς ἀτίμως διῆξε διὰ τὸ ἐν ἀποκλίσει τετευχέναι τὸν κλῆρον καὶ Κρόνον παρ’ αἵρεσιν μεσουρανοῦντα ἐναντιωθῆναι τῷ περιποιητικῷ τόπῳ, Ὑδροχόῳ, ἰδίῳ οἴκῳ, ὅθεν καὶ ἑαυτῷ παραίτιος τῆς καθαιρέσεως ἐγένετο, ὑβριστὴς καὶ ἀλαζὼν γενόμενος· καὶ γὰρ ὁ κύριος τοῦ δαίμονος καὶ τοῦ διανοητικοῦ τόπου Ἑρμῆς ἑαυτῷ ἠναντιώθη (τουτέστι τοῖς Διδύμοις)."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":" 327Endowment and Chanceeleventh from the Lot of Fortune), which happens to be Aquarius, Saturn’s own house. He loses his livelihood and with it his reputation. Furthermore, the mind is ruled by that same Lot of Daimon, natally in Gemini and so ruled by Mercury. But Mercury, unfortunately for our dancer, opposes the Lot of Daimon and so acts against the best interests of the Lot of Daimon, the danc-er’s mental actions. His overweening pride and boasting get the better of him. He managed to avoid this when he was nineteen, but by the time he is thirty- one, it catches up with him—a perfect example of pride going before a fall.We can compare Valens’ interpretation here to the general conditions he lists for the profected Lots of Fortune and Daimon. The Lot of Fortune has profected to the Hour-marker, and Venus is there. ‘The Lot of Fortune handing or taking over in operative places, with benefics in them or witnessing, indicates good fortune and promotion, both <in> actions and reputations, and setting things right, the achievement of expectations . . .’ (IV, 25.1). However, the profected lot is also squared by Saturn, a malefic: ‘But when it is . . . witnessed by malefics, it makes the actions and reputations less and temporary, or it makes whatever they may gain for themselves subject to oppositions, dangers or trials, and insults’ (IV, 25.2).The Lot of Daimon profects to a decline, but that decline does contain Jupiter, so he will have ‘discriminating and easily effected arguments and advantageous advice from friends,’ (IV, 25.3) but the ‘actions and reputations’ will be ‘less and temporary’ (IV, 25.2). Furthermore, he becomes ‘puffed up in his intellect, having a great amount of conceit’ (IV, 25.3). The fact that the ruler of the profected Lot of Daimon is Saturn means that he works against his inter-ests, ‘devising something dangerous against himself ’ (IV, 25.4). The natal ruler of his lot cannot help him, because it opposes the place of the lot. Valens has shown in this example how he intertwines the workings of the lots, so that the actions of one feed on the other, and future circumstances can be foreseen in earlier events. When the dancer was nineteen, Fortune got him out of a jam, but he didn’t learn from it, so in the next round of profections Daimon’s unfortunate position and his own mental actions, a hyper-arrogance about the good things which have come to him by fortune, brought about his downfall. That Valens uses the word paraitios, ‘responsible’, here shows he con-siders the Lot of Daimon as ‘intentional’ and with some qualities of what we could call free will, at least in the mental sphere. You can lead the soul to water, but you can’t make her drink.5.6 Case Study Number Six: The Lot of BasisThe final case study is a chart employing the Lot of Basis (previously described in Section 3 above). This is the lot formed by the arc between the Lots of Fortune and Daimon, but, we think, projected always below the Ascendant."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"328chapter 9From Valens’ descriptions of the Lot of Basis, it seems to be connected with both fortune and fame, particularly when in a relationship with the Lots of Fortune or Daimon or their lords, and especially if the lot or its lords are together with the Lots of Fortune or Daimon or their lords. Of course, the Lots of Fortune and Daimon, and therefore Basis, will only be in the same sign when the birth is at a new or full moon. Valens gives two examples of this in practice. In both, the Sun and Moon are conjunct, making the Lots of Basis, Fortune and Daimon also conjunct in the Ascendant/first place. This is probably because Valens was showcasing notable nativities. But since these charts do not list degrees, we cannot be sure where the Lot of Basis is going to fall, above or below the horizon, and there-fore we cannot be entirely sure that our interpretation of how to calculate the lot is correct. In this same section of examples, there are two charts which do not have the Sun and Moon conjunct (L86 and L101, III in GH); but these do not mention the Lot of Basis in the interpretation. We cannot be sure whether Valens intended for it to be considered, or not. However, here is an example where he does mention the lot.7373 This is No. L188 in GH; the chart was wrongly dated. Pingree corrected the date in his critcal edition, 89, app. crit.: ‘§§1–2: thema 14 (26 Iul. 70)’.

Such a person will be fortunate, capable of leading, kingly, possessing a royal destiny and established in great abundance. For the Lots of Fortune, Daimon and Basis all fell out in the same [zodiac sign], and the lady of these was Aphrodite on the Midheaven in Cancer, and the triplicity lord and that of the Exaltation were found in the Good Daimon in the place of acquisition.74Since the nativity occurred at a new moon, all the lots fall in the Ascendant, Libra, whose ruler is Venus. Since she is in the tenth, always a place of author-ity, and the triplicity lord of fire (in this case, the Sun), as well as the lord of the Lot of Exaltation, are in the eleventh, the Good Daimon, the nativity can only be superlative!6 Lot Calculation and the Doctrine of Sect75We have now seen how a Hellenistic astrologer used the Lots of Fortune, Daimon and Basis in interpretation. These interpretations show how Valens weaves the symbolism of the lots together to form a tapestry of the native’s life. In particular, Valens takes care to show the way that the Lots of Fortune and Daimon, and their rulers, work together both in a physical and mental sense. The two seem to be dependent on each other, and the outcomes for the natives reflect this. An important criterion for proper interpretation of lots is making sure the correct formula is used, based on the sect of the chart. Ptolemy alone uses only the diurnal formula for the Lot of Fortune. In general, he has no use for ‘lots and numbers for which no cause can be reckoned’.76 Since his goal was to find phys-ical causation behind astrology, this is not surprising. Yet even Ptolemy could not ignore the Lot of Fortune; he just needed to find some kind of physical 74 Valens, II, 27.1–2 (Pingree, 89.8–14): Ἔστω δὲ ἐπὶ ὑποδείγματος Ἥλιος, Σελήνη, Ζεύς, Ἑρμῆς Λέοντι, Κρόνος, ὡροσκόπος Ζυγῷ, Ἄρης Διδύμοις, Ἀφροδίτη Καρκίνῳ. ὁ τοιοῦτος εὐτυχής, ἡγεμονικός, τυραννικός, βασιλικὴν τύχην κεκτημένος καὶ ἐν περιουσίᾳ μεγάλῃ κατασταθείς· ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ γὰρ ἐξέπεσεν ὅ τε κλῆρος τῆς τύχης καὶ ὁ δαίμων καὶ ἡ βάσις, ἡ δὲ τούτων κυρία Ἀφροδίτη μεσουρανοῦσα Καρκίνῳ, ὁ δὲ τοῦ τριγώνου κύριος καὶ <ὁ> τοῦ ὑψώματος εὑρέθησαν ἀγαθοδαιμονοῦντες ἐν τῇ περιποιήσει. 75 For more on the importance of sect in calculating the Lots of Fortune and Daimon, see Greenbaum, ‘Calculating the Lots’.76 Tetr.

He realised that if one employed only the daytime formula to construct the lot, it became a ‘lunar horoscope’—i.e., there was the same proportion between the Sun and the Ascendant as there was between the Moon and the Lot of Fortune.77 Furthermore, if one uses only the diurnal formula, taking the arc from the Sun to the Moon, one also brings in the soli- lunar phase, a physical phenomenon.78 For this reason, he could then use it as one of his aphetic points in determining length of life—the earliest material on the Lot of Fortune (in Nechepso-Petosiris as quoted by Valens) gives it this capacity of determining lifespan. Even in antiquity, astrologers were aware that Ptolemy was iconoclastic in using only one formula: in his ‘Investigation of Chart Factors’ (see Appendix 8.C) Rhetorius remarks that . . . if the Lot of Fortune and its lord happen to be well [placed], but the Lot of Daimon and its lord happen to be badly [placed] and beheld by malefics, they result in banishment for the nativity, especially for a noc-turnal nativity, on account of the Ptolemaic Lot of Fortune actually being the Lot of Daimon (my italics).79 What are the larger implications of this zeal to use the ‘correct’ formula? We may find some answers by returning to the prediction of length of life in ancient astrology (first discussed in Chapter Two, 2.4 and Chapter Three, 2.5).7 The Lots and Length of Life The luminaries and the Lots of Fortune and Daimon appear in astrological techniques on finding the length of life from the chart. It is possible that the rationale behind the use of the luminaries and Ascendant in the formulae for the Lots of Fortune and Daimon, especially in their use in calculating lifespan, 77 Ptolemy, ibid., III, 11.5 (Hübner, 206.591–93): . . . ἵνα ὃν ἔχει λόγον καὶ σχηματισμὸν ὁ ἥλιος πρὸς τὸν ὡροσκόπον, τοῦτον ἔχῃ καὶ ἡ σελήνη πρὸς τὸν κλῆρον τῆς τύχης, καὶ ᾖ ὥσπερ σεληνιακὸς ὡροσκόπος. ‘. . . so that the ratio and configuration which the Sun has in rela-tion to the Hour-marker, the Moon may also have in relation to the Lot of Fortune, and be like a lunar Hour-marker.’78 Thanks to Joseph Crane for pointing this out.79 CCAG, VIII/4, 121.7–11: εἰ δὲ ὁ κλῆρος τῆς τύχης καὶ ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ καλῶς τύχωσιν, ὁ δὲ κλῆρος τοῦ δαίμονος καὶ ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ κακῶς τύχωσι καὶ ὑπὸ κακοποιῶν θεωρηθῶσι, ἔκπτωσιν τελοῦσι τῇ γενέσει μάλιστα ἐπὶ νυκτερινῆς γενέσεως διὰ τὸ κατὰ Πτολεμαῖον κλῆρον τύχης ὑπάρχειν τὸν κλῆρον τοῦ δαίμονος."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":" 331Endowment and Chanceis because the Sun, Moon and Ascendant are indicators of time: the Sun the month, the Moon the day, and the Ascendant (‘Hour-marker’) the hour.80 This literal association with time makes them perfect representatives for discov-ering how long someone will live; and, in the positions of the Sun, Moon and Ascendant at birth, the ability of the beginning of life to predict the end of it. Both Ptolemy and Valens employ the luminaries and Lot of Fortune in their (different) techniques for finding length of life. Both consider the Lot of Fortune as a possible aphetic point, from which length of life can be deter-mined (Valens also uses the Lot of Daimon). Valens uses both diurnal and nocturnal formulae for Fortune, but we have seen that Ptolemy used only the diurnal formula for the Lot. Hephaestio also takes up this question in his section on length of life (Apotelesmatika, II, 11). He follows Ptolemy and even mentions his ration-ale behind using only the diurnal formula, but also refers to Nechepso and Petosiris in a difficult passage, which has had to be extensively restored, on which formula to use at night.81 Though Manetho the astrologer, in his poem Apotelesmatika, does not men-tion the Lot of Fortune in his considerations on length of life, he does take the strength of the Sun and Moon into account. His general rule is to use the Sun by day and the Moon by night as the aphetēs (releaser), but makes an excep-tion if the luminaries are cadent or below the horizon.82 This is a circumstance also addressed by Valens and by Serapion.83In fact, Valens is very concerned with using the proper formula, especially for length of life issues.

Valens also says, quot-ing and then interpreting Nechepso (III, 11.3–5), that the diurnal formula is used at night when the Moon is below the horizon; but he also tells us that if the Lot or its lord ‘falls astray’, then ‘Daimon and the horoscopic place’ can be used (III, 11.12).84 He makes a similar statement in Book IV, 4.5–6.85 This chap-ter, as we saw in 5.4 above, also details Valens’ use of both the Lots of Fortune and Daimon as aphetic points, determining events of the native’s life and cir-cumstances of his death. In Book IX, Chapter 2, Valens devotes an entire chapter to the Lots of Fortune and Daimon and their use in both quality and length of life. He tells us that the two lots are combined to give information about lifespan:Regarding lengths of life the two lots are combined; both in relation to the Sun and the Moon and the degree-separation between them, and in relation to the Hour-marker, the planetary-marker86 and its degree, they show plainly the years likely to be lived from the distance between them. They measure the half [of the entire distance] in one direction and then the other, either adding to the longitude of the hour-marker [i.e. in zodia-cal order], or falling short of [i.e. subtracting from] this [longitude] [i.e. in diurnal order], so two degrees of the zodiac are necessarily operative, and the nativity, though subject to death, takes up the life-giving breath in relation to the sympathy of the cosmos.8784 Pingree, 147.30–32: Τὸ δ’ αὐτὸ καὶ ὁ δαίμων καὶ ὁ ὡροσκοπικὸς τόπος ἐφέξει τῷ κλήρῳ κατὰ τὸν μερισμὸν ὁπόταν οἱ κληρικοὶ τόποι ἢ οἱ κύριοι παραπέσωσιν, μάλιστα ὁπόταν ὁ κλῆρος τῷ δαίμονι τὸν μερισμὸν ἐκχωρήσῃ. ‘[The Lot of ] Daimon and the Hour-marking place will have the same function as the Lot [of Fortune] in the apportionment whenever the lot places or their lords should fall astray, especially when the Lot cedes the apportionment to the Daimon.’ 85 Valens’ positions are explored in detail in Greenbaum, ‘Calculating the Lots’, 181–82.86 This must mean the position of each luminary involved.87 IX, 2.5 (Pingree, 319.7–14): πρὸς δὲ τοὺς τῆς ζωῆς χρόνους συγκρινόμενοι οἱ δύο κλῆροι, πρός τε τὸν Ἥλιον καὶ τὴν Σελήνην καὶ τὴν μοιρικὴν αὐτῶν ἀπόρροιαν, πρός τε τὸν ὡροσκόπον καὶ τὸν πλανητικὸν σκοπὸν καὶ τὴν μοῖραν προδηλώσουσι καὶ τοὺς βιωσίμους χρόνους ἐκ τοῦ διαστήματος, τὴν ἡμίσειαν ἔμπαλιν καὶ ἀνάπαλιν ἐκμετρηθέντες, ἢ προλαβόμενοι τοῦ μεγέθους τῆς ὥρας ἢ ἀπολειφθέντες τούτου, ὡς δύο μοίρας χρηματίζειν τοῦ ζῳδι<ακ>οῦ ἐξ ἀνάγκης, τὴν δὲ γένεσιν καίπερ ἐπίκηρον οὖσαν πρὸς τὴν τοῦ κόσμου συμπάθειαν τὸ ζωτικὸν ἀναλαβεῖν πνεῦμα.

Stephan Heilen, in a persuasive proposal, has argued88 that the Lot of Daimon as well as the Lot of Fortune was treated by them. We have already seen supporting testimony that this was the case, especially in Valens III, 11, where a main point of the chapter is that the Lot of Daimon can also be used in determining length of life, where the King and also ‘the ancient one’89 (Petosiris?) are quoted extensively in techniques for calculations of the Lot of Fortune; and where a technique endorsed by Nechepso results in the use of the de facto Lot of Daimon (III, 11.3–5). Heilen’s proposal focuses on the context around IX, 2.7 (attributed to Petosiris), namely IX, 2.1–8, where uses of the two lots concern length and quality of life.90 He has made a compelling case, based on context, precedents and supporting texts, for interpreting IX, 2.7 as referring, not solely to the Lot of Fortune, but also to the Lot of Daimon: Petosiris actually refers to both lots by their respective daytime formulae.91 The pertinent part of the passage reads: Petosiris does not speak aimlessly [i.e., without a goal in mind] in the Definitions about the sympathy of the Sun and Moon: whether the [sepa-ration] from the Sun to the Moon and the equal amount from the Hour-marker, or from the Moon to the Sun and the equal amount from the Hour-marker, you will find [that amount] falling by the same [interval] into [the respective zodiac sign/place]. . . .9288 See Heilen, Hadriani genitura, comm. on Antig.

IX, 2 thus enhances the power of the two lots and the importance of the day and night formulae for Hellenistic astrology. Two comments may be made in this regard.

For my translation of II, 3.1 (176) and IX, 2.8 (177), I now agree with Heilen that ἔμπαλιν is iterative (‘again’) not spatial. My conclusion (177–78, Fig. 3b, Interpretation no. 2), that the lots effectively are found by projecting the Sun-Moon arc in opposite direc-tions from the Ascendant, remains correct.Figure 9.8 Equal distance of the lots from the Ascendant."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":" 335Endowment and Chancearise mainly in questions of life expectancy (both for Valens and for Ptolemy, who are the main delineators of the technique). For Ptolemy, any nocturnal chart would show what other astrologers called the Lot of Daimon, not the Lot of Fortune (Rhetorius even points this out). The Lot of Daimon, therefore, whether de facto or de jure, is fully involved in this determination. Life expec-tancy requires finding the most powerful place in the chart, and the first things the astrologer looks at are the Sun and the Moon. The power of the luminary is dependent on its sect, dignity and placement in the chart. Each luminary is stronger when in its own sect: the Sun in the day, the Moon at night. The formulae for the Lot of Fortune clearly try to take this into account, in that the planet from which the arc is calculated is the planet in sect. When there are variations in this method, they are because the sect luminary is weakened (and, of course, only the noctural formula is affected). Secondly, practice as well as theory may have dictated that two lots, in their day/night formulae, were better than one: astrologers may have found it diffi-cult to get consistent results on life expectancy only from one lot formula, and so used both as needed. This could be the reason why Valens makes so much of which formula to use, and perhaps even why he places so much emphasis on the Lot of Daimon in other contexts.8 ConclusionsWhile the overt use of the Lot of Daimon is limited (but not absent) in dis-cussions of life expectancy, it is often used in natal interpretation, time-lord systems (Aphesis from Daimon) and in profections, to show the mental state of the native and to show how this mental state interacts with the events seen to be brought about by the Lot of Fortune. In addition, it is considered a factor in physical and mental illness. It is sometimes difficult to disentangle the effects of both of the lots, since at times they are seen as responsible for the same out-come. Remember that in the chart of attributions of the Lots (Table 9.1), both Fortune and Daimon were assigned reputation and actions. The two lots, sep-arated in the chart, nevertheless remain joined by the bond of the Ascendant, from which they equally project. Chance and Endowment, Fortune and Daimon, as Freud says, are both responsible for a man’s life; neither is alone responsible. We take what we have been endowed with—let’s call it talent—and apply it to what life brings us. Our circumstances—our luck, if you will—are informed by this gift and how we choose to use it. The chance events that befall us are what test us in phys-ical, mental and spiritual ways. Here happenstance meets intentionality. The"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"336chapter 9influence is mutual, not sequential. Circumstances evoke action and reaction, based not only on physical impulses but also on mental ones. We choose how to react; the reaction may be based on past habit, or it may be more liberated from it, but there is always the possibility of conscious intention. Underlying all the interpretive moves Valens makes is a foundation based on the interaction between chance and intention. The Lots of Fortune and Daimon and their midpoint, the Ascendant, demonstrate this foundation. (The Lot of Basis is both a literal and a metaphorical symbol of this combination.) In his work, as in the work of Paulus, Olympiodorus, Firmicus and Rhetorius, Valens seems to acknowledge, in the dependency of Fortune and Daimon on each other, this relationship between chance and intention, the body’s desires and the soul’s decisions. It is strange that, throughout all his delineations, Valens keeps allowing for ‘escape clauses’ from an afflicted lot or planet ruling the lot. Fortune can sub-stitute for Daimon, or the other way around. The Moon can take over from the Sun and vice versa. Why might this be? It is perhaps because Valens cannot let go of the idea that we are in some ways responsible for our lives, and the astrological scheme can show this: there are escape clauses both in astrology and in life (we can learn from our mistakes). Valens may be deterministic in his outlook (as may most astrologers), but he is not a fatalist. Peter Struck, talking about the Stoic position on fate, has articulated the difference between deter-minism and fatalism: Determinism tells us that, given the totality of causal conditions at one time, what happens next is entirely determined. However, fatalism, in the sense in which the term is commonly used, claims something slightly dif-ferent. It states that everything is determined to happen, independent of human choices, efforts or deliberations. But Chrysippus never claimed that. Our choices, effort, and deliberations do matter in his picture.93 We could ask ‘How much does happenstance influence intentionality?’94 Or perhaps it would be better to say, ‘What is the relationship between happen-93 P.

And the representatives of this reciprocation are the Lots of Fortune and Daimon (we see reciprocation and mutuality even in the very formulae for the lots).There is another intentionality to be considered here, and that is divine intentionality.96 If we think that events in the world are determined, but that we can discover things in advance by the grace of the gods and our own wisdom, does this say anything about the intentionality of the gods/ensouled cosmos to provide such guidance through divination in general and astrology in particular? Who makes the patterns—we or the gods?97 Or are we imprinted or endowed with the ability to see the patterns, to receive the signs and put together the symbols?98 For the ancients, is this the endowment that the dai-mon provides? Is it, then, the daimon who is the bearer of intention from god to human? Both we and the gods have an interest in communication. As Struck points out, ‘the divine sign’ is ‘an act of communication.’99 If this is the case, then again the daimon works as the mediator, communicator and administrator between the divine and human. In astrology the Lot of Daimon, the lot of nous and phronēsis, is a symbol of this mediation. As an analogue to the Lot of Fortune, it is the third point of the triangle created by Fortune, Daimon and the Ascendant.100 This, then, points to an intentionality on both sides, both human and divine—for the gods who intend us to read the patterns, and for ourselves who, with our own ability for intention, can make up our own minds. 95 Struck, ‘World full of Signs’, 12–13, also takes up this issue. His thoughts have helped prompt my own.96 A ‘purposive cosmos’, as Struck, ibid., 16, points out, was accepted by most ancient philosophers.97 I thank Darby Costello for conversations on this subject which have helped with these questions and conjectures.98 Struck suggests following the lead of Walter Burkert in this regard, positing an ‘early [human] evolutionary state and a divinatory mentality’. See Struck, ‘World full of Signs’, 18 and n. 35, referring to W. Burkert, Creation of the Sacred: Tracks of Biology in Early Religions (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1996). See esp. 156–63. Burkert tells us (163) that ‘humans construe their kosmos of sense. It hints at the divine.’ 99 Struck, ‘World full of Signs’, 17.100 Strangely, the form they make is an isosceles triangle, that called daimonic by Xenocrates (cited in Plutarch, De defectu oraculorum, 416d)."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"338chapter 9Throughout the history of Greek astrology, from Dorotheus through Valens to Rhetorius,101 both the Fortune and Daimon lots were closely linked, and could even substitute for each other in chart interpretation. In description and interpretation, the two are spoken of as if they were variations on a theme, or as the mirror images which they actually are in the chart. Theirs is a ‘secret mutual connivance’ hiding in plain sight, and it is the astrologer who must take note of it.102 Just as in the culture of the Greco-Roman world Tyche and Daimon form a pair linked to divination, lots, and even toasts to health, the Lots of Fortune and Daimon cannot be astrologically interpreted in isolation from each other. The Sun and Moon that form them, the happenstance of the time and space tie (the Ascendant) that binds them—these create links that forge in astrological language the reflection of reality shown in the chart. The Hellenistic astrologers, literally, cannot separate body from mind, soul from spirit.101 I.e., the ‘5th consideration’ on Fortune and Daimon: see Appendix 8.C.102 The phrase ‘secret mutual connivance’ comes from C.

In both of these he shows his familiarity with current religious and philosophical traditions, including Pythagoreanism, Orphism, Platonism and what we now call Neo-Platonism. It is also obvious that he had at least a working knowl-edge of astrology and astrological principles, for both the Commentary and the Saturnalia contain discussions on the planets, the zodiac and the use of astrology.3 Several chapters of the Saturnalia are devoted to syncretizing other gods with the Sun,4 and within those chapters is the following:[16] Another clear proof that it is the sun that we worship under the name of Mercury is the caduceus, which the Egyptians5 have designed as the sacred staff of Mercury. It shows a pair of serpents, male and female, intertwined; the middle parts of the serpents’ coils are joined together as in a knot, called the knot of Hercules; their upper parts are bent into a circle and complete the circle as they meet in a kiss; below the knot their tails rejoin the staff at the point at which it is held, and at that point appear the wings with which they are provided. [17] The Egyptians also maintain that the attributes of the caduceus illustrate the nativity, or ‘genesis’ as it is called, of mankind; for they say that four deities are pres-ent to preside over a man’s birth: his Daimōn, Tuchē, Erōs and Anankē [Daimon, Fortune, Love and Necessity]. By the first two they understand the sun and the moon; for the sun, as the source of the breath of life and of heat and of light, is the creator and the guardian of a man’s life and is therefore believed to be the daimon, or god, of a newborn child; the moon is Tuchē [Fortune], since she has charge of the body, and the body is at the mercy of the fickleness of change; the kiss of the serpents is the symbol of Love; and the knot is the symbol of Necessity. [18] Why wings are added has already been explained, and of the above-mentioned attributes the coiled bodies of the serpents have been specially chosen, as 3 Commentary, I, 12, 19, 20.1–8, 21; II,11; Saturnalia, I, 19.16–18, 21.4 Perhaps in an effort, during a period where Christianity was becoming ever more powerful, to ‘monotheize’ paganism.5 Recall Chapter 3, Figure 3.2, right (no. 3180), 82, and Figure 3.3, 86, with the caduceus pic-tured with the Agathos Daimon; Dunand mentions a few more such images in LIMC I/1, 281 (nos 31–35)."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":" 341‘Parents of Human Civilisation’illustrating the serpentine course of each of the two stars [i.e., Sun and Moon].6The four birth deities Macrobius describes in this passage correspond to four astrological lots mentioned by Vettius Valens, Paulus Alexandrinus and others. We examined Fortune and Daimon in the previous chapter, but the others men- tioned in this quotation, Eros (Love) and Necessity, are equally worth consid-ering. As we shall see, in one calculation format, the lots of Eros and Necessity are formed from the lots of Fortune and Daimon, which is why this chapter is devoted to them. They are significant not only in the astrological world but in the world of Hellenistic philosophy and religion.7 It is scarcely an overstate-ment to say that the concepts of Love and Necessity are fundamental to Greek culture, mythology, religion and philosophy, and perhaps even to the study of what is called ‘natural science’. This chapter starts with the religious, philosophical and cultural understand-ing of Eros and Ananke. Then we revisit Macrobius’s caduceus in light of these findings. Next, we explain how the lots of Eros and Necessity8 were used in astrological technique; and finally, we discuss the interpretations of Eros and Ananke within astrological technique in combination with their wider interpre-tations within the Hellenistic astrological timeframe.

Some astrological practice associates the lots of Eros and Necessity very specifically with the Lots of Fortune and Daimon. This astrological link of Eros and Ananke to Tyche and Daimon may also provide us with insights on how they were perceived in other areas. 1 Eros and Ananke in Greek Religion and Philosophy: An Overview1.1 The Early TraditionHesiod counts Eros among the three initiating gods in the Theogony, along with Chaos and Gaia (Earth). Eros is ‘most beautiful among the deathless gods’;9 after Aphrodite’s birth, Eros and Himeros (Longing/Desire) follow her.10 Ananke is not mentioned as a divinity in the Theogony, but the word is used with the sense of a force or constraint, and even at this early stage is joined with the idea of binding.11 In the first Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite we find the liaison of Aphrodite and Anchises, she being ‘compelled’ by Zeus to have a relation-ship with a mortal man. This ‘erotic anankē’, as Hugh Parry describes it, is Eros not by persuasion but by compulsion, and intimates a force linked to subjuga-tion, taming and enslavement.12 Zeus delivers this anankē, though; it is not yet a divinity on its own.13 For both Parmenides and Empedocles, Ananke has become a goddess (actually, she is called a daimon). Parmenides’ cosmogony contains bands (stephanai) which ‘cross one another’ (Testimonia A37),14 described thus:9 Theogony, 120 (West): ἠδ’ Ἔρος, ὃς κάλλιστος ἐν ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσι. . . . 10 Theogony, 201.11 Ἀνάγκη appears twice in the Theogony, at 517 and 615. Context shows this connotation of force or constraint. The first reference is to Atlas holding up the sky ‘κρατερῆς ὑπ’ ἀνάγκης’, ‘under masterful constraint’. The second, associating ἀνάγκη with binding, is to Prometheus, who was bound by force, ‘. . . ὑπ’ ἀνάγκης . . . μέγας κατὰ δεσμὸς ἐρύκει.’ Note that Atlas and Prometheus, both associated with force or constraint here, are brothers, the sons of Iapetus and Clymene (Theog. 507–11). See Hesiod, Theogony, trans. Hugh G. Evelyn-White, in Hesiod; Homeric Hymns; Epic Cycle; Homerica (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1914, repr. 1995); The Homeric Hymns, trans. and annot.

Anankē in the Iliad (6.458) is tied to the enslavement of Andromache (Parry, 258).13 Zeus may be the provider of anankē in this poem, but later, when anankē acquires its connections with fate, ‘even Zeus cannot escape fate’.14 D-K, I, 224."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":" 343‘Parents of Human Civilisation’Fragment B12: For the narrower [bands] are filled with unmixed fire . . . and in the middle of them a daimon which governs all; for she rules over hateful childbirth and union,15 sending female to mingle with male and the opposite again, male with female . . .16Fragment B13: First of all the gods she crafted Eros . . .17 Testimonia A37 (Aëtius, II 7, 1): . . .

My translation following Gallop.17 D-K, I, 243.16: πρώτιστον μὲν Ἔρωτα θεῶν μητίσατο πάντων . . . 18 D-K, I, 224.7–9: τῶν δὲ συμμιγῶν τὴν μεσαιτάτην ἁπάσαις <ἀρχήν> τε καὶ <αἰτίαν> κινήσεως καὶ γενέσεως ὑπάρχειν, ἥντινα καὶ δαίμονα κυβερνῆτιν [vgl. B 12, 3] καὶ κληιδοῦχον [Β 1, 14] [I am reading κληροῦχον] ἐπονομάζει Δίκην τε καὶ Ἀνάγκην [Β 8, 30; 10, 6]. At 224, in the app. crit. to line 9, Diels says ‘κληιδοῦχον Fülleborn: κληροῦχον Aët.’ Quotation in Stobaeus, Anthologium, I, 195.9–12 (1a); Fülleborn has emended κληροῦχον in Mss F and P to κλῃδοῦχον. I translate κληροῦχον, ‘allotter’, rather than κληιδοῦχον, ‘key-holding’. Most translations prefer ‘key-holding’ and/or treat the four descriptives for δαίμονα as an unsep-arated series (e.g. Gallop, Parmenides Fragments, 116; Barnes, Early Greek Philosophy, 138; Guthrie, HGP, II, 61–62; Burnet, Early Greek Philosophy, 187, 190 and n. 3). In contrast with these translations, I think the first two descriptions of δαίμονα, ‘governor’ and ‘allotter’ are linked by their proximity and by their status as nouns, and the second two form another set, separated by the verb; in the first set the noun ‘governor’ connects to Dike in the second set, while ‘allotter’ in the first set connects to Ananke in the second. This inter-pretation gives more grammatical weight to κληρουχός as correct (LSJ, s.v., has it only as a noun), since κυβερνήτης is also a noun. If this is the case, then Justice governs or steers and Necessity allots. Re ‘keyholder’ versus ‘allotter’, Burnet (190, n. 3) also favours the ‘lots’ version, as does Tarán, Parmenides, 248. Guthrie, HGP, II, 62, n. 2 says ‘this may be right’ (though finally he rejects it for ‘keyholder’). Most prefer ‘keyholder’ because Justice holds the keys in Fragment 1 (D-K, I, 229.9, Parmenides B1: . . . Δίκη πολύποινος ἔχει κληῖδας ἀμοιβούς.) However, I am persuaded (as is Burnet) that κληροῦχον fits better with Necessity because of Necessity’s association with allotment. For other examinations of this Aëtius quotation, see J. S. Morrison, ‘Parmenides and Er’, JHS 75 (1955): 59–68, esp. 60–65; and A. Finkelberg, ‘The Cosmology of Parmenides’, AJPh 107, no. 3 (1986): 303–17"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"344CHAPTER 10Who is this daimon? Plutarch names her as Aphrodite,19 which makes sense because of the association with Eros and (sexual) union. Guthrie agrees with this position.20 Here, the mingling that Aphrodite (the principle of Love) does is with Justice and Necessity. Two (Platonic) thoughts come immediately to mind: Diotima’s characterisation of Eros as a great daimon (see below); and, unmistakably, the Myth of Er, where Necessity is the central spindle about which the planets revolve, and Lachesis, the daughter of Necessity, allots each soul the daimon that they choose.21 Parmenides’ fragments thus align with Plato’s characterisation of Ananke in the Myth of Er.22 They also evoke the Orphic deities Eros and Ananke (Adrasteia), as we shall see.Other fragments mention the goddess/daimon Necessity: ‘. . . you will know too the sky which encloses it [the Moon]—whence it grew, and how Necessity led and fettered it to hold the limits of the stars’;23 and ‘. . . strong Necessity holds [it] fast in the chains of a limit, which fences it about.’24 Again Necessity is associated with binding and, significantly, with the stars.1.2 EmpedoclesLove (philotēs = philia) and Strife (neikos) figure prominently in Empedocles’ cosmology as the joining and separating forces of the four ‘roots’ (rhizomata), corresponding to the four elements. Empedocles’ usual word for ‘Love’ is philia, also associated with Aphrodite (but Empedocles does not use the word Eros).25 (both Morrison and Finkelberg are primarily interested in the components of the bands, not in the goddess/daimon).19 Amatorius 756e–f: Plutarch, Amatorius, trans. W. C. Helmbold, in Moralia, IX (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1961, repr. 1999). For the argument that here Parmenides refers to the planet Aphrodite, see G. Cerri, ‘The Astronomical Section in Parmenides’ Poem’, in Parmenides, Venerable and Awesome (Plato, Theaetetus 183e).

Néstor-Luis Cordero (Las Vegas/Zurich/Athens: Parmenides Publishing, 2011), esp. 86–89.20 Guthrie, HGP, II, 61. Tarán, Parmenides, 248 and n. 50, however, disagrees.21 This is why I prefer κληροῦχον, ‘allotter’, in the description of the daimon. Necessity is naturally associated with allotment.22 Guthrie, HGP, II, 63, states that ‘The descriptions of Plato and Parmenides are in a com-mon tradition, and the only possible tradition is the Pythagorean.’ But perhaps there is also an Orphic thread; see below, 1.7, ‘The Orphic Tradition’, 350–53.23 D-K, I, 241.16–18, Parmenides B10.5–7; Clement, Stromateis V, 14.138.1; as quoted and trans-lated in Barnes, Early Greek Philosophy, 139.24 D-K, I, 237.10–11, Parmenides B8.30–31, trans. Gallop, Parmenides Fragments, 69.25 Guthrie, HGP, II, 182, n.1 also points this out. Later authors such as Plutarch also assumed that philia was love: he calls Empedocles’ love principle Aphrodite or Eros, and says desire came into nature ‘from Providence’ (De facie 926f–927a: . . . ἄχρι οὗ τὸ ἱμερτὸν ἧκεν ἐπὶ τὴν"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":" 345‘Parents of Human Civilisation’Love unites and Strife divides, and these two opposing forces join and separate the roots. Necessity is a goddess in the Purifications (Καθαρμοί); she is associated with oracles and oaths, and seems to be very ancient: ‘There is an oracle of Necessity, a decree of the gods long ago, eternal and sealed by broad oaths. . . .’ (fr. B115).26 Because Necessity forces Charis and Neikos to take turns ruling, it is hated by Charis27 who, as Sandbach28 says, is philia by yet another name (Guthrie assumes it is Love).29 Though certainly Empedocles did not intend it, there is a connection, though paradoxically by hate, between love (or Charis) and Necessity. We think we are separate from the object of our hatred, but the act of hatred brings us together with it. Hate, it seems, can bind as much as love. 1.3 AeschylusBy the time of Aeschylus, Zeus is no longer, as in Hesiod, the dispenser of Ananke, but rather subject to it. In Prometheus Bound (Προμηθεὺς δεσμώτης), not even Zeus can escape Fate/Necessity: ‘Chorus: Who then is the helmsman of Necessity? Prometheus: The three-formed Fates and mindful Furies. Chorus: Can it be that Zeus is weaker than they? Prometheus: Yes, in that even he can-not escape what is fated. Chorus: But what is fated for Zeus except always to have power?’30 Words like power (kratos) and force (bia) used in this way emphasise these connotations for anankē. φύσιν ἐκ προνοίας, φιλότητος ἐγγενομένης καὶ Ἀφροδίτης καὶ Ἔρωτος ὡς Ἐμπεδοκλῆς λέγει καὶ Παρμενίδης καὶ Ἡσίοδος. . . .).26 D-K, I, 357: ἔστιν Ἀνάγκης χρῆμα, θεῶν ψήφισμα παλαιόν, / ἀίδιον, πλατέεσσι κατεσφρηγισμένον ὅρκοις·. My translation after Wright in Empedocles, Empedocles: The Extant Fragments, ed. and trans. M. R. Wright (New Haven/London: Yale University Press, 1981), 270. Ananke is also connected with oracles in the Orphic theogony (see below, 1.7, ‘The Orphic Tradition’, 351).27 Fragment B116, Καθαρμοί (Purifications), D-K, I, 358.15: [Χάρις] στυγέει δύστλητον Ἀνάγκην (‘[Charis] hates hard-to-bear Necessity’). 28 In Plutarch, Quaestiones convivales, ed and trans.

Note the use of ‘peprōmenē’, ‘fated, destined’ (LSJ, s.v. πόρω II.2), an adjective often applied to Moira; it comes from the verb πόρω, perhaps whence comes Latin pars, portio, with the same idea of one’s fate as an apportioned lot. In the Chorus’s last question Ananke is juxtaposed with power (κράτος): Zeus thinks he has it, but it is Ananke which embodies that power."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"346CHAPTER 10Note the use of the word oiakostrophos, helmsman, here, to describe the task of the Moirai (and Furies). In astrology, the hour-marker (Ascendant) is called the oiax, rudder, of the chart,31 by which the native’s fate is turned; it zodiacally represents the time and place where the child comes into being, manifest in the physical world and thus subject to some kind of fate. Most of the lots, whose very name prompts connection with one’s allotment or fate, project from this same Ascendant. 1.4 PlatoPlato, as always, provides more grist for the mill. Certainly the two crucial dia-logues for understanding Eros and Necessity are Symposium and Republic (the Myth of Er). In Symposium, Eros and what it might be create the structure of the dialogue.32 Diotima’s exposition of Eros is the central focus, but it is preceded by Pausanias’s speech about the two kinds of Eros, one earthly (Pandemos) and one heavenly (Ouranios) (180d–182a); the earthly Eros is sexual desire, corporeal and hedonistic, while the heavenly Eros is a ‘rational’ desire, which is pure and focused not on the body but on the soul.33There is an interesting juxtaposition of Eros and Necessity in Agathon’s speech, when he criticises Hesiod and Parmenides for saying that Eros is the oldest god (195b–c). To make the point that Eros is the youngest, not the oldest, of the gods, Agathon points to the forceful binding and violence of the early gods as proof that this was not Eros, but Necessity. If Eros had been present, he says, there would have been not violence but harmony and peace. This view-point clearly echoes the ancient views of Eros as union and Ananke as force or compulsion.Diotima’s slant is different. Her Eros is the daimōn megas (202d13) who is, naturally, between gods and mortals. This Eros, offspring of Poros (Provision) There may be a subtle play on words here, as kratos is often paired with anankē, and anankē itself represents fate.31 See, e.g. Paulus, ch. 24 (Boer, 54.2); also Chart No. 81 (P. Lond. 130) in Neugebauer and Van Hoesen, GH, 22, 24, col. VII.165; and P. Oxy. No. 4277, in Jones, APO, vol. 2, 420.17.32 Symposium 178b is a source for the Parmenides fragment cited above: ‘First of all the gods she crafted Eros.’ For Eros in the Symposium, see among others Timotin, Démonologie, 37–42 (and his bibliography); idem, ‘Éros, le démon philosophe et la polémique anti-gnos-tique.

Jean-Patrice Boudet, Philippe Faure, and Christian Renoux (Rennes: Presses universitaires de Rennes, 2011), 51–54. Here I only lay out those themes in Symposium relevant for our discussion of Eros.33 This dichotomy may, of course, reflect Plato’s prejudice against women; still, these two conceptions of love were not unique to Plato."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":" 347‘Parents of Human Civilisation’and Penia (Poverty), seeks wisdom, the good and the beautiful; he moves between the want of Penia and the resourcefulness of Poros. Through pur-suing wisdom, the good and the beautiful, this Eros will find both happiness (εὐδαιμονία) and a kind of immortality through creation. For Ananke, the Myth of Er (Republic X.616c–617d), discussed elsewhere,34 is important for understanding the nature of the daimon. Plato’s Ananke controls the spindle about which the cosmos revolves, and is thus intimately connected with time, space and the material world of generation. The whorls, which are the paths of the planets, move around this central spindle made of adamant (i.e. unbreakable). On the rim of each whorl a Siren stands, singing a note for her particular whorl, which harmonises with all the others. The three Moirai, daughters of Ananke, help turn the whorls around the spindle. After the souls’ required choice of a daimon and a life based on the lot they have drawn (617d–621a), they pass ‘beneath the throne of Necessity’.35 Though the souls choose their own lives, they are paradoxically required to do so (Lachesis is, after all, Necessity’s daughter). Though we are responsible for our lives (617e),36 we have been forced to choose them, in the order the lots give us. In Hermetic literature (see 1.6 below) Necessity is also connected with the order of the Cosmos (the primary meaning for kosmos, of course, is ‘order’). Here the lots enforce Necessity. In the singing of the Sirens, as well, is a link between Necessity and harmony (perhaps because it symptomises a pleasing order?). This joining of Fate and Necessity disseminates from Plato to the Stoics to the Hermetists, and is found especially in those Hellenistic astrologers who have some connection with Egypt, including Valens37 and Manetho. Manetho begins two of the books of his Apotelesmatika with references to the fate and necessity which rule the world.38 34 See Chapter 8, 1.1.35 Republic 620e-621a: . . . ὑπὸ τὸν τῆς Ἀνάγκης ἰέναι θρόνον. . ..36 αἰτία ἑλομένου· θεὸς ἀναίτιος. ‘Responsibility is with the chooser; God is not responsible.’ 37 I think it likely Valens visited Egypt in search of astrological knowledge (see Anthology IV, 11.4–9), despite the reservations of Komorowska, Valens, 248–59; eadem, ‘The Lure of Egypt or How to Sound Like a Reliable Source’, in Astrology and the Academy: Papers from the Inaugural Conference of the Sophia Centre, Bath Spa University College, 13–14 June 2003, ed.

And because the Sun gives us the sensible world, it ‘bewitch(es) us by the charm and brilliance of vision, and convincing us that truth and everything else is to be found in the sun, or in the realm of the sun . . .’.40 Plutarch goes on to say that truth is rather to be found in darkness and dreams, in what cannot be seen with the eyes but with the mind; and this truth, which is beauty and worth, is recognised through Love (Eros), a ‘divine, chaste Love to be its physician, its saviour, its guide’.41 This description recalls the ‘Heavenly Eros’ of the Symposium, an Eros not sullied by the messiness of the body. Yet this Love does not come to the soul directly, but enters through the medium of the body. Humans first learn the physical forms of love (the passion and intoxication of the earliest meetings with the beloved), but through that come to know a different form of love, a divine love which fills the soul, so that both corporeal and spiritual love are experienced in the relationship (765a–d). Eros is therefore ‘like a mystic guide beside us at our initiation.’42 Eros thus represents both body and soul, in that it feeds the soul through the body.43 From an astrological perspective, Plutarch’s comparing Eros to the Sun is interesting, because the Lot of the Sun (i.e. the Lot of Daimon), with Aphrodite in one formula and the Lot of Fortune in another, creates the Lot of Eros prized for its power in interpretation and prediction by Vettius Valens, Firmicus Maternus, Paulus and others. of necessity / by which the race of ephemeral mortals is measured out, / and the human tracks of the Moirai and the wandering lights / and the fire-bright beams of the fixed stars I have discussed . . .’.

In Asclepius, ‘Divinus Cupido’ (Latin Eros) relates the Hermetic cosmogony,44 where Eros embodies the principle of union:For I say that the Cosmos is, in its nature, both sensation and growth, and contains growth in itself and preserves all things that have come into being. For each sex is filled with procreation, and the joining of each, or more truly, their uniting, is incomprehensible. Whether you call it Cupid or Venus, or both, you would be correct.45Necessity, on the other hand, is literally bound up with Heimarmenē, and described with many word-plays referring to chains, bonds, glue and force. This bonding creates order, which fits the Cosmos itself together. Heimarmenē, Necessity and Order are part of God’s divine plan, and they are inexorable, swayed neither by anger nor kindness (Empedocles’ strife and love?). In SH XIII, Necessity and Heimarmenē are subservient to Providence (pronoia); in fact, Necessity is described as a ‘firm decision and unalterable power of Providence’.46 In the Korē Kosmou (Pupil of the Eye of the Cosmos), Kronos (the planet Saturn, as one of the gods who are responsible for various parts of the human condition) calls himself the ‘father of Dike and Ananke’.47 (Is there an echo of Parmenides here?) Since Necessity is part of the structure of plan-etary cycles and time, perhaps the Hermetic writer is playing on the common Greek pun of chronos/kronos. Eros and Necessity are described as masters over the souls who are bound to bodies: ‘It is Eros, O souls, and Ananke, who will be 44 Asclepius, Prologue, 1 (Nock and Festugière, CH II, 297.16).

Eros, in turn, is a great creative force which joins together the beings of the Cosmos. The Orphic theogony aligns with all of these conceptions and introduces some new elements. 1.7 The Orphic TraditionThe way the Orphics involve Eros and Ananke in their theogony may have implications for its use and philosophical underpinning in astrology (since Orphic cults and writings were prevalent at the time when astrology was flour-ishing in the late Antique world).51 The earliest parts of this tradition (the Orphic poems) date to the late sixth/early fifth centuries BCE,52 but the Orphic Hymns are from the Imperial period53 and the Rhapsodic Theogony, revered by Neo-Platonists, may date to ca. 100 BCE54 (though the Orphic theogony itself survives in far older versions). 48 SH XXIII.38 (Nock and Festugière, CH IV, 12.11–12, 15–17): Ἔρως ὑμῶν, ψυχαί, δεσπόσει καὶ Ἀνάγκη, οἵδε γὰρ μετ’ ἐμὲ πάντων δεσπόται τε καὶ ταξίαρχοι. . . . . . . θνητοῖς καὶ αὐταὶ προσμεμοιρασμένον χῶρον σπλάγχνοις καταδικασθεῖσαι ἐνοικήσετε.

From them are born Chronos/Herakles, a serpent with the heads of a bull and a lion, with a god’s face in the middle; and Necessity who is called Adrasteia (the ‘inescapable’), whose form is both male and female ‘as a sign that she was the cause of bringing all things to birth.’56 Thus both Time and Necessity are involved with generation (see my discussion of the caduceus below). Chronos has three offspring: Aither, Chaos and Erebos; and in Aither, Chronos creates an Egg. This Egg splits (the halves may form heaven and earth) to reveal Phanes, whose name literally means ‘shining one’ and ‘appear-ance’.57 Phanes is the creator of all: he is beautiful, he shines with light, has golden wings and heads of various animals. He contains both sexes (since he will create everything from himself ). He is known by several different names: Protogonos (first born), Erikepaios, Metis, Dionysus and Eros. Among his crea-tions is his daughter Night, who becomes his partner in creation and to whom he gives the gift of prophecy (she gives oracles from a cave, and Adrasteia [= Ananke] stands at the entrance to the cave). Night bears Gaia and Ouranos, leading to the Titans and Olympians as in the standard mythological tradition. Yet rather than cede to a new order, in Orphism Night remains a powerful and important counsellor: when Zeus swallows Phanes and becomes in his turn the creator of all, Night advises him.58 55 For this recitation I follow the descriptions of W. K. C. Guthrie, Orpheus and Greek Religion: A Study of the Orphic Movement (London: Princeton University Press, 1952; reprint, 1993), 79–83; this is the Hieronyman Theogony.56 Damascius, De principiis, i.318.5–6 (Ruelle, vol. 1, 318.5–6): . . . ἀρσενόθηλυν αὐτὴν ὑπεστήσατο πρὸς ἔνδειξιν τῆς πάντων γεννητικῆς αἰτίας.

Damascius describes the Hieronyman Theogony (see West, Orphic Poems, 178–79, for his translation of Damascius’s entire passage). 57 Myths of the cosmos arising from an egg which splits open are not uncommon in other Mediterranean cultures; for instance, in Phoenician cosmogony heaven and earth are formed from an egg, and in Zoroastrian, Ahura Mazda creates a material heaven in the form of an egg (see West, Orphic Poems, 103–06). In the Khonsu cosmogony, Amun-Ptah creates and fertilises an egg from which the Ogdoad comes: see E. Cruz-Uribe, ‘The Khonsu Cosmogony’, JARCE 31 (1994): 169–89. In another Egyptian cosmology, e.g., the Cenotaph of Seti I at Abydos (M. Clagett, Ancient Egyptian Science: A Source Book, 3 vols., vol. 2 (Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1995), 399) and the Book of Nut (Fundamentals of the Course of the Stars) (von Lieven, Grundriss des Laufes der Sterne, 158–59), Geb (Earth) and Nut (Sky) are separated by Shu (air) so that their separa-tion may produce life.

Ananke is the axis of the cosmos65 and a winged serpent twining around the universe with Chronos, Time.66 Eros (a.k.a. Phanes) comes winged, gleaming and golden from an egg, and creates the immortals: ‘. . . the longed-for Eros, back gleaming with golden wings . . .’67 (this image is especially beloved by the Neo-Platonists).68 The word 59 See West, Orphic Poems, 29; The Orphic Hymns: Text, translation and notes, ed. and trans.

The shining gold colour suggests a possible link to the sun (see Plutarch’s comments on the Sun and Eros above, 1.5, 348); Charles Burnett (personal communication) pointed out the literal golden yellow of the egg yolk.

Are there connections between the caduceus and the Orphic the-ogony’s Eros and Ananke? And why does Vettius Valens specifically privilege these lots?74 Some answers may lie in Orphic material. West points out that both Athenagoras, a Christian apologist of the second century CE, and Damascius, the last Neo-Platonist, associated Herakles with ‘the winged serpent Chronos’75 in addition to associating Ananke with Chronos-Herakles.76 Damascius, of course, is later than both Valens and Macrobius, but 69 For more about ‘light’ names ascribed to the planets, see Greenbaum, ‘Rising to the Occasion: Appearance, Emergence, Light and Divination in Hellenistic Astrology’, 13.

Whether the relief is actually an Orphic artefact, or a Mithraic representation, the birth of Phanes from an egg is an Orphic concept.71 In addition to Aristophanes, στίλβων and similar words describe Phanes (a.k.a. Eros) in Kern, OF, Fr. 86.4, 158 (quoted in Proclus and Damascius). The common uses of στίλβων are to describe gold, the stars and other heavenly bodies and, particularly, the planet Mercury. 72 See Saturnalia I, 17.42, 18.12–22, 23.22; Commentary on the Dream of Scipio, I, 12.12.73 See n. 3.74 Valens does not mention a caduceus or a Heraclean knot in his lot descriptions, but one wonders where he got the formulae that link Eros and Ananke with Fortune and Daimon, and considers them important enough that they are classed with the best, most operative places in the chart and included in profections.75 West, Orphic Poems, 192; see also 193–94, 231, 252.76 Ibid., 194.

Contemporary with Valens, Athenagoras wrote an account of the Orphic theogony in his Plea for the Christians, ca. 177 CE.77 It contains a passage very similar to Macrobius’s description of the knot of Hercules in the caduceus. Athenagoras tells us that Zeus desired to mate with his mother/sister Rhea-Demeter. She resisted and ‘. . . became a serpent (drakōn)78 and he, changing into a serpent himself, [and] binding her in the so-called Heraclean knot, had intercourse with her (the wand of Hermes is a token79 of the figure of the intercourse).’80 Athenagoras’s statement aligns well with Macrobius’ description of the caduceus; could it have been a source for him? Athenagoras and Damascius have their own common source81 in an Orphic Theogony (described above) ascribed by Damascius to ‘Hieronymus’; it incor-porates elements of an earlier Protogonos Theogony with ‘Stoic embellish-ment’, so West dates it after the second half of the third century BCE.82 For the connection between Chronos and Herakles, West cites Cleanthes as the the version of L. G. Westerink in Damascius, Traité des premiers principes, ed. L. G. Westerink, trans. Joseph Combès (Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1991), 161.7–11.

Both knots evoke the shared task of Chronos and Ananke.Vettius Valens, as well, was not ignorant of Orpheus: [12] And as the most divine Orpheus says:A human soul is rooted in aither.[13] And in another way:When drawing in air we pluck a divine soul.[14] In another way:A deathless and ageless soul is from Zeus.[15] In another way:The soul of all is deathless, but the bodies mortal.88 83 Ibid., 194 and n. 56.84 Ibid., 198, where he adds: ‘It is logical enough that Time should be at the centre of the heavens. . . .

We turn now to the Lots of Eros and Necessity in the astrological tradition.2 The Astrological Lots of Eros and NecessityThe Lot of Fortune, as we have seen, was almost universally employed by Hellenistic astrologers (even the cause-minded Ptolemy). The Lot of Daimon, as well, is also regularly found in extant examples of Hellenistic-style charts. Eros and Necessity are among the planetary lots in Antiochus/Rhetorius (Paulus), Paulus and Olympiodorus: the former called Venus’s lot and the lat-ter Mercury’s. But the Lots of Eros and Necessity are given a special role to play by authors such as Vettius Valens and Firmicus Maternus. What distinguishes these two lots from their planetary siblings? The following examination will provide possible reasons for their exceptionality.2.1 The Lots of Eros and Necessity in Astrological LiteratureValens’ techniques employ these lots more than any other astrologer’s surviv-ing works. In II, 16, our four Macrobian lots are singled out among the names for various places of the chart: The God gives signs about the father, Goddess about the mother, Good Daimon about children, Good Fortune about marriage, Evil Daimon about illnesses, Bad Fortune about injuries, the Lot of Fortune and the Hour-marker about life and manner of living, [the Lot of ] Daimon about intentional mind (φρόνησις), Midheaven about action, [the Lot of ] Eros about desire, [the Lot of ] Necessity about enemies.9089 Komorowska, Valens, 319–24, suggests Valens obtained his Orphic knowledge from the Hermetica, but she does not discuss it in reference to his lot usage.90 Valens, II, 16.1 (Pingree, 67.5–9): Ὁ μὲν θεὸς σημαίνει περὶ πατρός, ἡ δὲ θεὰ περὶ μητρός, ἀγαθὸς δαίμων περὶ τέκνων, ἀγαθὴ τύχη περὶ γάμου, κακὸς δαίμων περὶ παθῶν, κακὴ τύχη περὶ σινῶν, κλῆρος τύχης καὶ ὡροσκόπος περὶ ζωῆς καὶ βίου, ὁ δαίμων περὶ φρονήσεως, μεσουράνημα περὶ πράξεως, ἔρως περὶ ἐπιθυμίας, ἀνάγκη περὶ ἐχθρῶν. Including lots with places seems to equate them in importance."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":" 357‘Parents of Human Civilisation’We saw in Chapter Nine that Valens uses the Lots of Fortune and Daimon as releasers in finding time-lords for particular periods of life. In Book IV, the places where the four lots fall are called ‘operative and active’.91 In his subse-quent coverage of profections, he includes the four lots as profecting places, describing in detail the resulting outcomes for each (we have already seen those for Fortune and Daimon). For Eros and Necessity, he says: [5] Eros handing or taking over in profitable places, and with benefics in them or witnessing, furnishes desires with a good moral purpose and lov-ers of beautiful things. For some are turned toward education and bodily or musical training and, being softened up with pleasure in future hope, they believe in foresight (pronoia) as untiring; but some, being beguiled by sexual pleasures and intimacies both with women and men, believe it good. [6] And so Ares and Hermes bearing witness [i.e. aspecting] or being in the place, and especially in their own zodiac signs, make lovers of boys, or they are censured for both,92 or they are those who love arms, hunting and wrestling; but [if ] Aphrodite [is in such a condition], [she makes] sexual intimacies with women. And so sometimes also, since they have been shown affection, they show affection back. [7] And likewise, each of the stars when it has been allotted the place, either bearing wit-ness or taking over the time, will furnish the form (eidos) of the desire according to its own nature. [8] And so generally when malefics are in them or witnessing, the things associated with the desire will come to be by extortion, penalty and danger. [9] And if in any way the [star] of Kronos is co-present with or bears witness to Aphrodite and the Moon, they are blamed for the love of licentious deeds both with men and women, and they endure scandals or, having repented (metanoeō),93 are indifferent when conquered by suffering. [10] If in any way the [star] of Zeus is co-testifying, the result will happen in a trustworthy or powerful way, or mystically. [11] When Ares and Hermes are in them or bearing 91 Valens, IV, 11.49 (Pingree, 167.20–23): χρηματιστικὰ μὲν οὖν καὶ ἐνεργητικὰ ζῴδιά ἐστιν ὡροσκόπος, μεσουράνημα, ἀγαθὸς δαίμων, ἀγαθὴ τύχη, κλῆρος τύχης, δαίμων, ἔρως, ἀνάγκη· μέσα δὲ θεός, θεὰ καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ δύο κέντρα· μέτρια δὲ καὶ κακωτικὰ τὰ λοιπά. ‘The operative and active zodiac signs are the Hour-marker, Midheaven, Good Daimon, Good Fortune, the Lots of Fortune, Daimon, Eros and Necessity; middling are God, Goddess and the remaining two centrepins; but the rest are barely sufficient and malefic.’ Note that the lots’ power is seen as equal to that of the Ascendant, Midheaven, Good Daimon (the 11th) and Good Fortune (the 5th). 92 I think this means censured for both kinds of sexual preference.93 More literally, ‘change one’s mind’."},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"358CHAPTER 10witness, or taking over the time, [they make] the love of wicked and shameful affairs; for they come to be forgers, robbers, burglars, gamblers, with the thinking faculty of a wild beast. [12] And if the [star] of Aphrodite also bears witness, [it makes] poisoners, adulterers, murderers, from which, being involved in evil works with securities and loans, in accord-ance with the times which are occurring, having the experience of impris-onment or judgement, they live dangerously. <For> the place is actually powerful (ischuros) in many [areas], which is why one must take it into consideration.94 . . .[14] Necessity handing or taking over in operative places, when benefics are in them or witnessing, brings on affiliations and alliances with superiors, and the subjugations or deaths of enemies. [15] When malefics are in them, it brings on litigations and trials, and payments [for them], from which, in accomplishing their purpose, they live wretch-edly. And if the figure is afflicted in any way, some are condemned or subjugated.9594 Valens, IV, 25.5–12 (Pingree, 191.27–192.22): [5] Ὁ ἔρως παραδιδοὺς ἢ παραλαμβάνων ἐν χρηματιστικοῖς τόποις, καὶ ἀγαθοποιῶν ἐπόντων ἢ μαρτυρούντων, εὐπροαιρέτους ἐπιθυμίας κατασκευάζει καὶ καλῶν ἐραστάς· οἱ μὲν γὰρ περὶ παιδείαν καὶ ἄσκησιν σωματικὴν ἢ μουσικὴν τρέπονται καὶ μεθ’ ἡδονῆς κολακευόμενοι τῇ μελλούσῃ ἐλπίδι ἀκοπίαστον ἡγοῦνται τὴν πρόνοιαν, οἱ δὲ ἀφροδισίοις καὶ συνηθείαις θελχθέντες θηλυκῶν τε καὶ ἀρρενικῶν ἀγαθὸν ἡγοῦνται.

I discuss his formulae below.For Paulus and Olympiodorus, the Lot of Eros is Aphrodite’s lot, and the Lot of Necessity is Hermes’s. They say of them: ‘Eros signifies appetites and desires occurring by choice, and it becomes responsible for friendship and favour. Necessity signifies imprisonments, subordinations, battles and wars, and it makes enmities, hatreds, condemnations and all the other constraining circumstances which happen to men as their lot at birth.’96In Hephaestio, the Lot of Eros is used in synastry97 between friends, and in the Liber Hermetis for synastry between parents: Hephaestio, On Friends and Enemies:Let us also set out again the things which have been said very well by Dorotheus. Others, he says, look upon the Lot of Eros, namely how it lies [in the chart], by what stars it is beheld (θεωρεῖται), and they examine with [this lot] the things concerning friendship. . . . And the equally-as-cending zodiac signs are sympathetic to one another, especially if the Lots of Eros of the two nativities should fall in them.98Liber Hermetis, On Parents:It is also proper to take note of the Part of Cupid,99 if it is configured to the Sun <and> Moon, especially by trine and sextile, and if they are κρίσεις ἐπάγει καὶ ἐξοδιασμούς, ὅθεν καὶ περὶ προαίρεσιν διαπράξαντες ἀνιαρῶς διάγουσιν· ἐὰν δέ πως τὸ σχῆμα κακωθῇ, τινὲς καταδικάζονται ἢ καθαιροῦνται.96 Paulus, ch. 23 (Boer, 50.1–7) (Olympiodorus has virtually the same wording, ch. 22 [Boer, 57.5–10]): Ὁ δὲ Ἔρως σημαίνει τὰς ὀρέξεις καὶ τὰς ἐπιθυμίας τὰς κατὰ προαίρεσιν γινομένας, φιλίας τε καὶ χάριτος παραίτιος καθέστηκεν.

Additionally, in Hephaestio’s book on katarchic astrology, the four lots are used to interpret a katarchē:The composed katarchē points out each [part of the ritual] before the opening of the animal: the Hour-marker reveals the one making the sac-rifice; the Setting [place] that which is sacrificed or the sacrificial victim; the Midheaven the god or gods; the Underground [place] the reason for the altar,102 the completion of the matter and how it is sacrificed. One must carefully consider the stars—in what places they are, their position and phase, and the four lots—Fortune, Daimon, Necessity, Eros.103The question we must ask now is: why these four lots? What do they have in common, that they are grouped together and considered worthy of being used in so many types of astrology—natal, predictive and katarchic? The answer may appear obvious, but the development of the tradition has been surpris-ingly difficult to illuminate. 2.2 A Double Tradition?The formulae given by Paulus and reiterated by Olympiodorus were not the only formulae available for these lots in the ancient world.104 We will now look 100 Obedient signs are Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces; they obey, respec-tively, the commanding signs of Virgo, Leo, Cancer, Gemini and Taurus.

For Paulus’s Lot of Eros (associated with Venus), one takes the arc, in a diurnal chart, from the Lot of Daimon to Venus, and projects the same amount from the Ascendant, reversing this formula for a nocturnal chart (Figure 10.2). Thus the following formula (stated slightly dif-ferently, but with the same result):Asc + Venus − Daimon (D) or Asc + Daimon − Venus (N)For Paulus’s Lot of Necessity, one uses the arc from Mercury to Fortune by day and from Fortune to Mercury by night (Figure 10.3), or:Asc + Fortune − Mercury (D) or Asc + Mercury − Fortune (N)These are the lot formulae cited as the ones in common practice in the Hellenistic astrological world by most of the scholars in this under-studied cor-ner of the field.105 Yet was this truly common practice? In examining the liter-ature, especially the extant examples of birthcharts, it is clear there is another set of formulations for these lots, using the arcs between the Lots of Fortune and Daimon and projecting from the Ascendant. In the literature, these formu-lae are given by Firmicus, and by Vettius Valens, but each author gives formulae which reverse the other’s. 105 Bouché-Leclercq, AG, puts the ‘Hermetic’ lots in a table within the text (307–08) and cites Paulus for them, while mentioning Firmicus’s formulae for the locus cupidinis and necessitatis only in a footnote (306, n. 6) as part of the multitude of diverse lots that, in Figure 10.2 Paulus’s Lot of Eros in a diurnal chart."},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"362CHAPTER 10In Mathesis VI Firmicus gives the formulae for a number of lots, including those of ‘Desire’ (Cupido) and ‘Necessity’ (Necessitas), equated respectively with the Greek Eros and Ananke.

F. Gettings, The Arkana Dictionary of Astrology (London: Arkana/Penguin Books, 1985, repr. 1990), 180, 233–34, 288–89, 338, 455, 479, mentions only the Paulus/Hermetic formulae for the Lots of Eros and Necessity. Tester, A History of Western Astrology, 28–29, mentions a few lots, but gives no lot formulae except the Lot of Fortune. He claims the calculation of the lot was ‘. . . variously described by different authorities, some of whom seem to be not at all clear about what they are doing’ (28).

Two more may use the Hermetic formulae, but one is in very bad condition and one appears in a text which is not strictly Hellenistic.118 A new chart was recently discovered by Alexander Jones (P. Berlin 9825) which at this time is the only chart of Late Antiquity to calculate the seven ‘planetary’ lots according to the Paulus for-mulae.119 The four extant ‘Egyptian’ charts use both variants of the Egyptian formulae (two use Valens and two use Firmicus). These will now be explored in detail.2.3 The Lots in Action: ExamplesOur first chart, from Greek Horoscopes, is No. 138/161 (P. Princeton 75),120 prob-ably dating to 138 CE. (See Appendix 10.C for complete details of this chart and subsequent ones mentioned in this section.) Unfortunately, all the plan-etary positions and most of the angles are lost. The first preserved line says ‘21 [degrees], house of Kronos, bounds of Aphrodite’;121 the text then lists our four lots and their positions, along with a brief description of each lot’s significance:2. [The] Lot of Fortune was found in Cancer, 13 degrees, house of [the] 3. Mo[on, bound]s of Hermes. This signifies a measure of fortune.4.

[The Lot] of Necessity was found in Aries, 6 degrees, house of Ares,117 Dorotheus, Scholium ad Heph.

This proves the lots were calculated using the Egyptian formula. Since it is a night chart, we can tell from the positions of the Lots of Eros and Necessity that it is using the Firmicus variant of the Egyptian formula (Eros = Asc + Daimon − Fortune; Necessity = Asc + Fortune − Daimon).

As in the first chart, the house lord and bound lord are included with the positions; it additionally adds the decan. It too is a nocturnal chart. Unfortunately, there are transcription errors (in antiquity). The degrees of the Sun and Moon as discerned in the text are impossible as degrees (50 and 35 respectively). The position of the Lot of Eros, given as Sagittarius 15º, is impossible based on the other lot positions. Some of the house and bound lords also do not match with the lot positions.Here is the pertinent portion of the chart:12613.

House of Hermes[!], bounds of Ares, decan 3.Neugebauer and Van Hoesen made a valiant effort to make sense of all this. They suggested positions for the Sun and Moon which fit with the text. Since they knew the Ascendant position (♌ 13º), they could see that the arc from the Ascendant to the Lot of Fortune was 46 degrees, and they modified, correctly, the position of the Lot of Daimon from ♊ 20º to ♊ 27º, so that both lots are equidistant in both directions from the Ascendant. If Fortune and Daimon are 46 degrees from the Ascendant, then Eros and Necessity must be double that, or 92 degrees from the Ascendant. The position of Necessity at ♉ 10º09’ is close to that, at 92º51’ from the Ascendant. Adding 92º to the Ascendant position at ♌ 13º in the other direction (zodiacal motion, or coun-ter-clockwise) obtains ♏ 15º, the position at which Neugebauer and Van Hoesen also arrive. These positions are all consistent with each other, and with those 125 Neugebauer and Van Hoesen, GH, 65–67.126 Ibid., 65.

However, I suggest a different scheme (perhaps as tortuous, but it does seem to work). Line 27 goes with line 13 as given. For line 14 (Lot of Daimon at ♊ 20º), place line 30: House of Hermes, bounds of Ares, decan 3. The bounds of Ares go up to 24º. If the Lot were slightly over 20 degrees (we know that actually it must be 27 degrees), then it would be in the 3rd decan. For line 15, place line 28: House of Zeus, bounds of Aphrodite, decan 2.

However, since the interpretation accompanying it is entirely Hellenistic in flavour (there are frequent references to Ptolemy and Dorotheus), and it uses the Lot of Eros, it may be considered a ‘neo-Hellenis-tic’ chart. It is the birthchart of the Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, and one of its values (apart, of course, from its obvious worth as an exam-ple of thorough interpretation using Hellenistic methods) is its quotations of Dorotheus which do not appear in the Pahlavi/Arabic versions of the Carmen Astrologicum.

The Lot of Daimon diurnally is the arc from Moon to Sun and thence from the Ascendant in the same direction. Since the Lot of Fortune is in Libra, and the Lot of Daimon in Virgo, the Sun must be earlier in zodiacal longitude than the Moon. By examining how the Byzantine astrologer calculated the Lot of Eros, we can see that he was using the Firmicus formula for a diurnal chart, by day from Daimon to Fortune, thus Asc + Fortune − Daimon.132 We can further ascertain the probable degrees of the Sun and Moon. As stated in the text, the Ascendant is ♎ 5º23’ and the Lot of Eros is ♏ 6º35’. Using the Daimon/Fortune formulae for the Lot of Eros, we know that Eros is twice the distance from the Ascendant as the Sun is from the Moon. The distance between the Ascendant and Eros is 31º12’. Half of that is 15º36’. (This is the arc between the Sun and the Moon, the Ascendant and Fortune, and the Ascendant and Daimon.) We know that the Sun and Moon are both in Virgo, the Lot of Fortune is in Libra133 and the Lot of Daimon is in Virgo. If we add 15º36’ to the ♎ 5º23’ Ascendant, we get ♎ 20º59’; this is the Lot of Fortune. If we subtract 15º36’ from the ♎ 5º23’ Ascendant, we get ♍ 19º47’; this is the Lot of Daimon. If we plug in the Firmicus diurnal formula for the Lot of Eros (Asc + Fortune − Daimon), using these figures, we add ♎ 5º23’ and ♎ 20º59’ (185;23 + 200;59 = 385;83). Then we subtract ♍ 19º47’ (385;83—169;47 = 216;35) and get the exact figure given in the text: ♏ 6º35’! The Sun and Moon must, then, be 15º36’ apart. Let us assume that the Moon is as close to the end of Virgo as it can be, ♍ 29º59’. If we subtract 15º36’ from that, we get ♍ 14º23’, or the 15th degree of Virgo for the Sun (as Pingree states).134 132 Pingree found the degree of the Lot of Daimon retroactively from the position of the Lot of Eros, yet the way he has calculated it agrees neither with the precise position of the Lot of Eros, nor his own reckoning about the arc between the Sun and the Moon. One problem is that Pingree was using an incorrect formula for the Lot of Eros: he states it ‘is computed from the lot of the demon (which is in Virgo; see III.2), Mercury and the ascendent’ (ibid., 221). I have found no ancient text giving such a formula. The usual for-mulae are the ones I have called Hermetic and Egyptian and none ever involves Mercury. I think that Pingree, mistakenly, was able to get a position close to the Lot of Eros by using the formula of Asc + Mercury − Daimon. Using Pingree’s position for the Lot of Daimon, which he takes as 26º Virgo, and the chart position of Mercury at 25º Leo, he arrives at ♏ 6º23’, which is certainly close to ♏ 6º35’. Yet I believe I have ascertained exactly how the Lot of Eros was computed by the Byzantine astrologer. See above, this paragraph.133 It is with Venus, ‘its own House-master’ (VIII.2.6; p. 225), and Venus is in Libra in the Ascendant.134 Pingree, ‘Constantine’, 220.

Here is a short summary of each of these charts.P. Berlin 9825 is now one of the most complete extant charts we possess. Although the first part of the papyrus roll is missing (which would probably have included the name, date and time of the chart, and the Sun’s position), Jones has reconstructed the date from the other planetary and lot positions. All seven Paulus lots, with their longitude (sign, degree, minute) are given, along with the lords of the sign and bounds of each lot. Much other astrological and astronomical data is also provided.139The chart in Olympiodorus appears in the midst of a list of lot formulae. The text is extremely corrupt.140 What we can ascertain is that the Lot of Fortune is at 17º Capricorn, the Lot of Daimon is at 22º Gemini and the Lot of Eros is at 12º Gemini. The shorter arc between Fortune and Daimon is 155º; the longer arc 205º. Since the Ascendant must be equidistant from these positions, the Ascendant must either be ♈ 4º30’ or ♎ 4º30’. That being the case, if we are calculating them with Egyptian formulae, the Lots of Necessity and Eros must be (in the case of a ♈ 4º30’ Ascendant) ♎ 29º30’ or ♍ 9º30’; or (in the case of a ♎ 4º30’ Ascendant) ♈ 29º30’ or ♓ 9º30’. None of these corresponds to the Lot of Eros stated in the text as 12º Gemini. Therefore we can conclude that the Egyptian formula, in either variant, is not being used. We cannot conclude for certain that the Paulus formula for Eros is being used (because we do not know the position of Venus), but it is possible.141The chart in Abū Ma‘shar’s De revolutionibus nativitatum gives complete and accurate chart positions.142 To determine the Lots mentioned in the text, including the Hermetic Lot of Necessity, the following positions are given: Sun at ♌ 15º57’, Moon at ♉ 12º43’, Ascendant at ♉ 2º54’, Mercury at ♌ 22º07’, Mars at ♌ 10º29’ and Jupiter at ♑ 20º26’.143 (Mercury and Jupiter are both retro-grade, but this will not affect the lot calculation.)

First, it clearly uses the Hermetic formulae for the planetary lots. Second, it does not call the Hermetic Mercury lot ‘Necessity’, but rather the ‘Lot of Intellect and Native Wit’ (κλῆρος τῆς φρονήσεως καὶ τῆς συνέσεως), and it seems not to be a malefic lot in any way, contrary to the usual descriptions of this lot. This may be a clue to later thinking about what this lot represents in interpretation. It is to interpretation, both of the lots and the concepts behind them, that we now turn.3 Interpreting the Lots in ContextIn the astrological system used by Valens, Firmicus and others, Eros and Necessity are further extensions of Fortune and Daimon. They are counterparts equidistant from the point of incarnation (the Ascendant), and they are linked by this equidistance. They are not true opposites, as Eros and Eris are, but in provided in this example gives ♒ 13º37’, which does not match the text description of this lot being in Taurus.

Yet friends and enemies are both linked—one by attraction, one by repulsion. They are more like opposite sides of the same coin. (This is psychologically difficult to acknowledge—who wants to think they are in any way like their enemies?) Eros and Necessity are really (spatially in the chart, if not metaphorically in other ways) mirror images of each other (as are Fortune and Daimon). Mirrors, of course, reflect, but what we see in the mirror is not the actuality of the image, but one reversed. Still, both actuality and image are linked, for without an actual body in front of the mirror, there is no image to be had. In an astro-logical chart, the mirror images of Eros and Necessity visually show this link. The question we may ask now is, why? What reasons could there be for linking Eros and Necessity?3.1 Binding SystemsCould Eros be a counterpart to Necessity in astrology because they are both systems of binding? In the Myth of Er, the Hermetic writings and the Orphic theogony, Necessity is essential in the representation of the world that includes the heavenly system of stars and planets. The spindle of Necessity is the centre pole about which the cosmos is bound together. Eros, too, is fundamentally a binding, uniting, joining principle. Heinz Schreckenberg’s philological analy-sis of anankē aims to connect anankē semantically with binding words such as desmos.147 It may also derive from a fundamental meaning of ἀναγκάζω, ‘take in one’s arms’.148 (And ἀναγκάζω in turn is related to words like ἀγκάλη, ‘a bent arm’; ἀγκάς, ‘in the arms’; and ἄγκος, ‘a bend’.)149 The etymology of Eros is unknown,150 but certainly Eros has long been associated with unions brought about by love. Eros is also a creative, joining and binding force in the cosmol-ogies of Hesiod, Parmenides, Empedocles, the Hermetica, Chaldean Oracles 147 H. Schreckenberg, Ananke: Untersuchungen zur Geschichte des Wortgebrauchs (Munich: Beck, 1964), e.g. 8, 175–176. Onians, Origins of European Thought, also has extensive studies of binding words and their applications, including to necessity and love; see esp. 332–33, 368–73, 403.148 Chantraine, Tome I, 83. We are reminded of the Orphic Ananke-Adrasteia stretching out her arms and encompassing the entire cosmos, as well as the Platonic cosmos, with Ananke as its axis, encircled by a bond of light, ‘the bond of heaven . . . which holds together the circle of the universe’ (Rep. 616c), . . . εἶναι γὰρ τοῦτο τὸ φῶς σύνδεσμον τοῦ οὐρανοῦ . . . οὕτω πᾶσαν συνέχον τὴν περιφοράν. . . .

In astrology, blatantly via the lots, there are deliberate con-nections between Eros and Ananke, two binding principles whose expression comes about in different ways. One may be a more pleasurable binding than the other, but both are characterised by their ability to make bonds. 3.2 Choice and Persuasion vs. Force and CompulsionIn astrology the Lot of Eros signifies voluntary associations and desires by choice, while Ananke is, by its very meaning, compulsory: the earliest, most fundamental meanings of the Lot of Necessity were associations that were not by choice, i.e. enemies one must contend with, as opposed to friends. These sig-nifications for the lots, and even the fact that astrology joins Eros and Ananke in this way, oblige us to look at the cultural implications of Eros and Ananke in terms of choice and force. In the caduceus of Macrobius, Necessity is a knot, something that binds, while Eros is a kiss, a voluntary joining. Yet this may not be as black and white as it seems. The knot of Hercules can be used not only to bind by force, but to secure, to make safe. It is even said to cure wounds.151 With Eros, too, there is a paradox, for Greek mythology is full of people shot by the arrows of Eros and compelled toward love. There is also the idea of wanting (Eros) versus needing (Ananke);152 what we desire is not necessarily what we need. Paradoxically, having our needs met will allow us to survive. The associations between Eros and persuasion, and Ananke and force or compulsion are significant; these two are related, in that they both produce a certain result, but one allows the possibility of choice (or at least the illusion of it) and the other denies it. Both, however, may be necessary for society to function well.In Herodotus (8.111.2), Themistocles arrives at the Island of Andros with two goddesses, Peitho and Ananke.153 In Republic (519e), Plato tells us the rulers of the ideal state will govern the citizens by ‘both persuasion and necessity’154 151 Pliny, HN XXVIII, 17.63: ‘Vulnera nodo Herculis praeligare mirum quantum ocior medicina est . . .’. ‘To tie up wounds with the Hercules knot makes the healing wonderfully more rapid . . .’ (trans.

Reason may, however, supersede Necessity.158 In SH VIII,159 Hermes talks of three kinds of ‘incorporeals’ which affect human lives, the 155 Among numerous examples, a kylix by the Meidias Painter shows Peitho and Eros persuad-ing Demonassa (Getty Museum); Pausanias reports (Description of Greece I, 22.3) a cult of Peitho and Aphrodite Pandemos on the Acropolis; for more see the section on Peitho in A.

Hand, ‘Fate and Astrology: Some Ancient Insights’, The Mountain Astrologer Mercury Direct section (February/March 2006): 2–11, esp. 5–6. 158 That Necessity and logos were considered as separate is not unique to the Hermetists. Nor were they the first to think about necessity and heimarmenē. Leucippus states that ‘all things are according to necessity, and this is actually heimarmenē. For he says in “On Mind” that nothing useful comes to be in vain, but all things are both from reason and by necessity.’ D-K, II, 81.3–6, Leucippus B2: Λεύκιππος πάντα κατ’ ἀνάγκην, τὴν δ’ αὐτὴν ὑπάρχειν εἱμαρμένην. λέγει γὰρ ἐν τῶι Περὶ νοῦ· οὐδὲν χρῆμα μάτην γίνεται, ἀλλὰ πάντα ἐκ λόγου τε καὶ ὑπ’ ἀνάγκης.

This excerpt connects, as Festugière has said (III, lxi), to Excerpt VII (which clearly references the Parmenides fragment from Aëtius discussed earlier); in Excerpt VII, Pronoia and Necessity are set over divine order, and Dike is set over men, who are placed under Heimarmenē"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"382CHAPTER 10first according to Providence, the second according to Necessity and the third according to Fate (Heimarmenē).160 The first is noetic and has logos; the second is non-rational (alogos), but can be swayed by the first; and the third incorpo-real is the form and attributes of the body.161 The first incorporeal, if it ‘draws near to God’, is said not to be subject to Necessity but to be in accord with Providence.162 In Plutarch’s Myth of Timarchus (De genio Socratis, 591d-592c), the high-est part of the soul, the noetic, the ‘rational’, follows the daimon; and we have already seen the daimon associated with the third level of pronoia (Providence).163 So, at least in the Hermetic tradition, there is an ability to escape Necessity by attaining logos. This, then, is a way for a human being to escape some kinds of fate (those caused by alogos, which are a result of agnoia [ignorance], not pronoia). 3.3 Fortune and Necessity; Spirit and Love; Daimons and RealityNecessity also joins with fortune or chance in Greek literature; for exam-ple Tecmessa, in Sophocles’ Ajax (Lloyd-Jones and Wilson, line 485), speaks of ἀναγκαία τύχη, necessary chance. There are several ways to interpret this: 1) It is necessary that chance exist; 2) chance is necessary in or for the through their actions.

(If only he had known. . . .) What are we to make of this in regard to the lots in astrology? In the Paulus-Hermetic formula, Necessity is connected with Mercury and Fortune; it is of the material world, and therefore of the things that happen to the body. We think of chance as random, but this association with a Necessity that is fated would be anything but random. We go back, again, to the Myth of Er and the souls’ compulsion to choose a life in the order the lots assign them. The lots are scattered; the souls pick them up, apparently randomly; but it is this chance randomness, this ordered disorder, that will ultimately ordain the life they choose. In all of this the daimon is literally hanging over our heads (as in the Timarchian myth).165 Both Necessity and Eros are called daimons; and it is the daimon who is chosen to guard and guide our lives. Here there appears to be a collusion between ourselves and our daimon, for we choose our daimon—it does not choose us. The individual daimon does not force us to pick it specifically; we are given the final choice, but once we have made it, the daimon becomes our guiding force. The daimon, as a mediator between gods and humans, comes from the noetic world, but it guides us both in the physical world and the noetic world. This kind of ‘both/and’ duality (i.e., a ‘daimonic’ duality which is both phys-ical and noetic) is clear in the Fortune/Daimon formulae for the Lots of Eros and Necessity: the Lot of Necessity may seem to emphasise more the con-straints of the physical world, and the Lot of Eros the psychic joys, but both are formed from the Lots of Fortune and Daimon, and signify the experiences of both body and soul/spirit. They too are expressions of the daimonic ethos, the bridging of worlds.166164 Regarding Greek physics, the relationship between necessity and chance/fortune is prob-lematic; it is discussed, e.g., in Aristotle’s Physics 2.4. For more on physics, necessity and chance, see Edmunds, ‘Necessity’ and R. Sorabji, Necessity, Cause and Blame: Perspectives on Aristotle’s Theory (London: Duckworth, 1980).165 Plutarch, De genio Socratis, 591e. See below, n. 166. 166 Timaeus 81d–e talks about the soul at death released from its bonds, and flying out with pleasure from the body; this is similar to the Myth of Timarchus in De genio Socratis 590b–c, where the soul is released from Timarchus’s body after he has been struck on the head. Here the strike on the head causing the release may be because the highest part of the soul is at the top of the head, where the daimon is said to reside in Timaeus 90a; in the Myth of Timarchus, the daimon floats above the soul, connected by a thread—again, something which binds it—and pulls the part of the soul which is amenable to it upright."},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"384CHAPTER 10Eros is both body and soul, as Plutarch knows. It is an expression in the material world of an impulse that we cannot see physically, but only imagine. (Thus it is, in another way, daimonic. It comes from a world outside of the one we think we are living in.) Eros is not either/or but both/and. Eros is also both earthly and heavenly (the Symposium’s Eros Ouraniou and Eros Pandemou). It is hard for the Greeks, perhaps, to reconcile the ‘sexual desire’ part of Eros, with the ‘creative force’ and ‘heavenly reason’ part of Eros. In other cultures (such as the Egyptian) from which Greek astrology took a number of doctrines, this dichotomy did not really play a part. But the Lot of Eros, in interpretation and in divergent formulae, seems to have some of this same dichotomy. Eros in its Fortune/Daimon formula may have more to do with the general possibilities of alliances and associations in a human’s life, but the lot’s association with Aphrodite brings it into the mundane and mate-rial world of friends and sexual love. Hellenistic astrology often seems to tread this fine line between the ideal and the real. Or perhaps astrology seeks to rec-oncile these two positions, to show humans the possibilities in a general and universal sense, as well as those in a singular and particular sense as applied to one’s own particular chart.Lastly, what is the meaning behind the creation of the Lots of Eros and Necessity from the Lots of Fortune and Daimon? Put another way, Love and Necessity in astrology arise out of Chance/Fortune and Daimon/Spirit. Here, literally showing in the birthchart, is a manifest statement about human culture and religion which links these fundamental principles and applies them to an individual within that culture. Certainly most people who went to astrologers in the Hellenistic astrological timeframe would not be asking for such lofty philosophical expositions; they were interested in the usual ques-tions about love, work and quality of life that are constants in human living. But by combining the earthly and the heavenly, astrology allows for expres-sions of both the material and the spiritual (divine and daimonic) world, and implicitly and explicitly incorporates them into its technique. Epilogue: Caduceus ReduxFew studies on the caduceus even consider astrological connections with it. (In fact, there are not very many studies of the caduceus at all, and those that do (See Onians, Origins of European Thought, 334–37 for connections between binding and threads.)"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":" 385‘Parents of Human Civilisation’exist tend to focus on medicine or on the serpents and their roles.)167 Only two contain anything relevant to our examination. Rein Ferwerda deals specifically with the Athenagoras quotation we cited earlier. He observes that serpents are able to predict and are associated with diviners and have healing powers.168 He speaks of the knot of Hercules as both binding and healing.169 Ferwerda makes no mention of astrological significance for the caduceus, though he does see a cosmogonic and metaphorical spirit/body significance.170 The second study, by Jean Boulnois, is mostly concerned with the Dravidian origins of the caduceus, but two sections of his book are of interest. First, he describes a statue from the Mithraeum at Ostia which contains many of the Orphic features we saw in the statue of Phanes-Protogonos, as well as a cadu-ceus. Cumont provides a drawing:171167 We have already mentioned Howey, The Encircled Serpent; and Ferwerda, ‘Le noeud’ (Ferwerda’s study is useful both for the sources he cites and for showing how to tie a knot of Hercules, 110); in addition J.

In it he mentions the work of Antoine Court de Gébelin172 who, following Macrobius, supposed that the serpents were the Sun and the Moon, ‘qui, dans le cours d’une année parcourent l’Écliptique sur lequel ils sont tantôt séparés, tantôt unis.’173 Court de Gébelin suggests that the wand symbolises the equator and the wings Time; the knot of Hercules is the moment where Sun and Moon meet on the equator—he describes the Head and Tail of the Dragon (the Moon’s Nodes) as the place on the ecliptic where Sun, Moon and planets meet.174 For Court de Gébelin, the caduceus is an astronomical symbol par excellence. But none of these caduceus studies mention an astrological significance, and only Court de Gébelin comments on the Sun and Moon connection. Let us consider the astrological symbolism in the caduceus. The snakes in the caduceus are joined in two places: at the knot of Necessity and the kiss of Eros, a literal representation of the joining properties both of Eros and Ananke. The snakes also represent Fortune and Daimon, and the two places of joining may even give a visual rendering of the Lots of Fortune and Daimon combining to produce Eros and Necessity. In addition, Macrobius says the snakes are male and female, Sun and Moon—and the fact that they meet both by their tails and their mouths metaphorically suggests procreation. As metaphors for the Sun and Moon, they bring the heavens into the picture;175 and since we know that statue here reproduced was found in the mithræum of Ostia before mentioned, where C. Valerius Heracles and his sons dedicated it in the year 190 AD. This leontocephalous figure is entirely nude, the body being entwined six times by a serpent, the head of which rests on the skull of the god. Four wings decorated with the symbols of the seasons issue from the back. Each hand holds a key, and the right in addition a long scepter, the sym-bol of authority. A thunderbolt is engraved on the breast. On the base of the statue may be seen the hammer and tongs of Vulcan, the cock and the pine-cone consecrated to Æsculapius (or possibly to the Sun and to Attis), and the wand of Mercury—all charac-teristic adjuncts of the Mithraic Saturn, and symbolizing the embodiment in him of the powers of all the gods.’ This drawing also in F.

Court de Gébelin had already (109–10) discussed Mercury as the inventor of astronomy; in his opin-ion of the caduceus, Mercury’s symbol, he carries that idea further.174 Court de Gébelin, ‘Allégories Orientales’, 113–14.175 Aside from Court de Gébelin’s image, the snakes twining around the shaft of the caduceus correlate with the Sun, Moon and planets whirling around the spindle from the myth of Er, or with the Orphic Chronos/Ananke as the axis of the cosmos."},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":" 387‘Parents of Human Civilisation’the Sun and Moon create the Lots of Fortune and Daimon, and those lots then create the Lots of Eros and Necessity, I think we can safely conclude that this rendition of the caduceus has astrological implications. Giuseppe Bezza also recognised the caduceus of Macrobius as astrologi-cally significant.176 He terms the lots of the caduceus as those of ‘the Sun, the Moon, Venus and Mercury’,177 following the tradition of Paulus Alexandrinus; yet I believe that the Lots of Eros and Necessity have been singled out in the caduceus not because they are associated with Venus and Mercury,178 but because their very existence is bound up with the lots that precede them, those of Fortune and Daimon. It is because they are formed from Fortune and Daimon that they become so important. These ‘Egyptian’ formulae may have preceded those of Paulus (the newly-discovered birthchart of 319 is within the timeframe of Paulus’s Introduction of 378 CE), or the Hermetic formulae lost until Paulus. Furthermore, after the introduction of the Paulus-Hermetic for-mulae, there seems to have been a conflation of the two traditions. The lots of Eros and Necessity are called the ‘planetary’ lots of Venus and Mercury, but the Arabic tradition seldom promotes or uses the planetary formula for them, even though it calls them ‘planetary lots’.179 In any event, the singling out of these four lots in the caduceus, and by astrologers like Vettius Valens, shows the magnitude of the ideas identified with them. For the Greeks, as well as any ‘Hellenized’ person living in these 176 Bezza, AM, II, 972–73. Bouché-Leclercq, AG, 293 n. 1, as well, mentions the Macrobius pas-sage in his section on lots.177 Bezza, AM, II, 972.178 As if those gods/planets were somehow more important than Saturn, Jupiter or Mars.179 The standard formulae given in Abū Ma‘shar, al-Bīrūnī, Ibn Ezra and Bonatti do not use the planets for the lots of Love and Necessity (the Latin name for Necessity is dif-ferent, but the formula the same). In Abū Ma‘shar’s chart the Hermetic Lot of Necessity, using Mercury in its formula, metamorphosed into the Lot of Intellect and Native Wit, clearly a name more apt for Mercury. In Abū Ma‘shar, the Lot of Necessity (using the Valens version of the Fortune/Daimon formula) is called either the Lot of Poverty and Lack of Means (Abbreviation 1, 71, Abbreviation 2, 42) or the Lot of (Slight) Intellect (inge-nium or modicum ingenium) (Greater Introduction, 332, Tractate VIII, 3.444–49); here is the conflation in action, since the meaning of the lot is ‘poverty, war and fear, also hatred and a multitude of dispute, and enemies, anger, disputes in time of anger, negotiations, buying and selling, also reasoning powers and talents, and writings and number and seeking different sciences and astronomy.’ ‘Et hec significat paupertatem et bellum ac timorem, odium quoque et multitudinem contentionis, et inimicos et iram et conten-tiones in hora ire, et negotiationes, emptionem et venditionem, cogitaciones quoque et ingenia, et scripturas ac numerum et petitionem diversarum scientiarum et astronomie.’ This passage appears almost verbatim in Bonatti (see n. 114)."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"388CHAPTER 10times, Tyche, Daimon, Eros and Ananke would be seen as manifestations of cosmological principles, but more importantly, as some kind of divinity (whether godly or daimonic). As such, they would be intimately bound up in the fate and choice of a human, and therefore they become divinatory tools.180 Through these lots, the astrologer may discover not only how the affairs sig-nified by each lot relate particularly to the native, and the propitiousness of their placement in the chart,181 but also find, through using the lots in timing systems such as zodiacal aphesis and profections, what is in store for the native in the future. However, the lots may also be viewed through the other end of the tele-scope, so to speak. The way these lots are used in astrology has something to say about how these concepts are viewed in the wider culture. While Eros and Necessity are connected in Hermetic and Orphic literature, and in Macrobius’s description of the caduceus, it is in astrology that Eros and Necessity (not to mention Fortune and Daimon) are seen as linked mirror-images of each other. It is in astrology that we have direct apprehension of both the material and physical implications of Eros and Necessity (friends and enemies, favours and imprisonments) as well as the psychological implications (sympathy, affection and enmity, desire and compulsion). It is in astrology that the cos-mological functions of Eros and Necessity are brought to a personal level, in a way that brings home the connectedness of the cosmos to the individual and reinforces the link between the heavenly and the earthly, the spiritual and the material, the macrocosm and the microcosm.180 This may be a clue to why these lots are singled out, as important in predictive tech-niques, from the others commonly used (e.g. Lots of Father, Mother, Siblings, Marriage, etc., as well as the other ‘planetary’ lots). Hephaestio tells of their importance in katarchic astrology, which perhaps more than any other branch of astrology reveals its divinatory foundation. Cf. the quotation of Dorotheus in Hephaestio, III, 6.11 (see above for the dis-cussion of this passage, 2.1, 360, 366–67).

Each perspective has illustrated and illuminated various facets of the daimon and astrology. These microcosmic portraits will now be placed within their macrocosmic framework, as parts of a larger tapestry. They are revealed not as isolated worlds but as portions of a whole, woven and connected by many threads. These interweaving threads are the themes which carry across many of the book’s chapters. Seven continuing themes appear: 1) the indissoluble link between daimon and fortune; 2) the daimon’s relationship with fate; 3) astrology as a paradigm of determinism and/or fatalism; 4) personal destiny and the personal daimon; 5) the influence of astrology and the daimon;6) the influence of the Myth of Er; 7) Porphyry as a link between Plato, the daimon, astrology and fate. The themes reappear in different guises, seen from different angles. In addition to the observations already made at the ends of each of the previous chap-ters, looking at how these themes weave in with the overall study will provide further enlightenment as outlined below. 1 Catullus, Carmina (Mynors).

This is seen repeatedly throughout the book. Plutarch discusses both the fortune and the daimon of his subjects in the Parallel Lives; though some have considered his use of tuchē and daimōn interchangeable, it is rather an interdependence which is highlighted. The same interdependence occurs in astrology, through the paired fifth/eleventh, sixth/twelfth places, and through the Lots of Fortune and Daimon formed by reversing the calculation of the arc between Sun and Moon. The importance of the sun and moon in Plutarch’s daimonology is par-alleled by the importance of the Sun and Moon in astrology; astrology, further-more, connects the Sun and Moon to Fortune and Daimon. Astrology literally shows the place of the Good Daimon in the solar hemisphere and the place of Good Fortune in the lunar one. In Egypt, the cults of Shai and Renenet, Sarapis and Isis, merge in Ptolemaic and Roman times with those of Agathos Daimon and Agathe Tyche. Their cults in Roman Egypt are well-attested. Tyche and daimon were so familiar a pair that Isaiah 65:11 used the Hebrew Gad and Meni to represent them. Their pair-ing is so entwined that the two can even be conflated and confused (as they are in the Septuagint). In astrology, Manilius associates the Good Daimon place with (Felix) Fortuna, and the Good Fortune place with Daimonie, another example of this convergence and interdependence. Both daimon and fortune (chance) are implicit in the idea of a lot: in the Myth of Er, both daimon and chance (tuchē) are critical components of the soul’s choice of a life. In astrology, the Lots of Fortune and Daimon are the two crucial lots from which the other planetary lots are constructed. The eleventh place from the Lot of Fortune is a place of acquisition, the implicit acknowledgement of the ‘daimon’ place as a means of acquiring fortune. Vettius Valens is careful in his astrological interpretations to show Fortune and Daimon working together in the creation of and reaction to events, both physically and mentally.There is no Tyche without Daimon; there is no daimon without fortune. The fifth place must have the eleventh as its opposite, and so must the sixth and the twelfth be a pair. Tuchē and daimōn stand for body and soul and their mutual need for each other. In the same way Moon needs Sun and Sun needs Moon. In astrology we see what is implied in culture (fortune=body=moon, daimon=soul=sun) made explicit: the Lot of Fortune is the lot of the body and the Moon; the Lot of Daimon is the lot of soul and Sun. From there we can make any number of philosophical leaps: to the Sun and the mind, to nous, to"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":" 391Conclusiondaimon inhabiting nous, the highest part of the soul, to the Moon and body and growth and decay, to the length of human life and its productivity. 2.2 The Daimon and FatePlutarch’s Myth of Timarchus lays out the connection of souls with daimon and fate. The daimon in the Myth of Er is the guardian of moira. Iamblichus equates the personal daimon with an individual moira, and Proclus tells us that the daimon ‘fulfils the decrees of fate and bestows gifts from providence.’ This could not be a more apt statement of how Vettius Valens views his per-sonal daimon and its providential gifts. The Pseudo-Plutarch essay De fato explains that the tertiary providence allotted to the daimons gives humans some choice, an ‘antecedent’ not controlled by fate; only the consequences of that choice are in accordance with heimarmenē. If one chooses to succumb to too much passion, an unfortunate fate is the result. Greek ideas about fate and providence are placed in counterpoint to Egyptian and Mesopotamian ideas in this book. Shai underlies the Agathos Daimon in Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt, and contains the idea of fate as decreed by the gods, but which can be changed by propitiation or good deeds; the same concept appears in the Mesopotamian šimtu. This fate is negotiable. Porphyry thinks that knowing one’s personal daimon can, by ritual, free one from his fate. The Agathos Daimon takes on Shai’s attributes as a deity of fate, but a fate that is not fixed, which can be changed by petition to the gods. 2.3 Astrology as a Paradigm of Determinism and/or FatalismNot necessarily by design, the book has raised the issue of astrology’s deter-minism leading to fatalism. The evidence brings a different scenario to light. The tertiary providence of De fato provides some space for escaping heimar-menē through a providence administered by daimons. Gnosis and pronoia can allow this escape. Valens may provide an example of this in second-century astrology. Even Ptolemy allows escape clauses, though his are physical and causal, whereas Valens’ are metaphysical and revelatory. For Porphyry, finding his personal daimon in astrological practice enhances his own attainment of wisdom and virtue, and thereby allows an escape from heimarmenē. Astrology’s view of fate does not depend entirely on Greek conceptions, but is influenced by Egyptian and Mesopotamian ideas. These underlie astrolog-ical fate, in spite of protestations to the contrary by anti-astrology apologists (who followed Greek ideas of an inexorable fate). In this view, fortune is not blind or random, but a goddess who controls destiny. Fate is not utterly pre- determined; its judgements can be appealed."},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"392ConclusionThe possibility of choice is illustrated by the metaphor of a shipwreck in Plotinus and Vettius Valens; even though we are allotted certain circumstances in life, we have choice as to how to react to those circumstances. Astrology allots a certain configuration of stars and planets, but we can choose how to react within those parameters. Valens might say that it is the benefic planets in play in our chart which allow for the escape from threatening circumstances, but he might also rely on providence, via daimonic intervention, to provide the wished-for outcome.Katarchic astrology is another example of negotiating fate. In katarchic tech-nique, the succedent places (which include Good Daimon and Good Fortune), represent the future—an indication that change can be negotiated here. By contrast, the cadent places, including the Bad Fortune and Bad Daimon places, represent the past which cannot be changed; and also, perhaps metaphori-cally, the fixed fate given by yielding to the vice of passions or the bad daimon. Iamblichus allows katarchic astrology to set the time of theurgic rituals for best effect, as Zosimus does with alchemy; Manilius refers to katarchic astrol-ogy in his delineation of the places from the Lot of Fortune. The four lots of Fortune, Daimon, Eros and Necessity are explicitly used by Hephaestio in the katarchē for a ritual. Astrological lots using Fortune and Daimon demonstrate both the material world, and mental intention and choice. Fortune represents the physical world of generation and corruption, but Daimon, in its association with nous and phronēsis, links with the conscious and intentional. As mirror images of each other, these lots are explications of a relationship between happenstance and intentionality: a de facto illustration of a non-fatalistic astrology (see defini-tions of fatalism in Chapter 9, Section 8). 2.4 Personal Destiny and the Personal DaimonThe idea of a personal daimon appears in various contexts. For Valens, his per-sonal daimon helps him fulfil his destiny through providence. The Egyptian Shai is the personal guardian of destiny, while the personal daimon of a city is essential to its well-being. Some attributes of the Mesopotamian lamassu, e.g. that it guides and keeps its human safe and that it endows individual charac-teristics, are similar to those of a Hellenistic personal daimon.The lineage of the personal daimon who guides a soul through its incar-nated life passes from Plato to the Middle Platonists to Plotinus, Porphyry and Iamblichus, as well as other Neo-Platonists. Plotinus describes his version of a personal daimon who guides the soul from a higher level. Iamblichus finds it from the whole arrangement of the cosmos and from theurgical practice."},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":" 393ConclusionPorphyry uses astrology as a tool for finding an analogue of the personal dai-mon, who may then assist him in his own theurgical ascent to the divine. The association of lots with the personal daimon in the Myth of Er may colour the meaning of astrological lots as an expression of the daimonic, as well as their use as particular and personal indicators in a chart (as in Valens II, 18.6). In Manilius (3.75–81), the lot places are even more particular to an indi-vidual than the places reckoned from the Ascendant. Valens’ use of lots in pre-dictive technique (e.g. aphesis from Fortune and Daimon, profections of lots, length of life) provides more ways of finding the correct personal outcomes for his clients. Where the Lots of Fortune and Daimon fall in the chart provide particular planetary rulers for times of life. 2.5 The Influence of Astrology and the DaimonAs a prominent component of cultures in the Mediterranean oikumenē, astrology has a presence in and influence on several facets of those cultures. In Mesopotamia and Egypt, it becomes an important part of religious prac-tice, with priestly administrators. We find it expressed negatively in a religious context in Gnosticism, but positively in Mithraism. The daimon plays an important role in Hellenistic philosophies, especially Platonic, as well as in religion. Combined with astrology, it is also viewed negatively in Gnosticism. As daimon and astrology become ever more vilified by early Christians, we find them combined into a matrix of evil practices, a convenient adversary to rail against. Astrology and the daimon are also com-bined in the Hermetica and magical papyri, in both positive and negative capacities. In Neo-Platonism, astrology and the daimon play a nuanced role, interpreted differently by different Neo-Platonists. In the wider culture in general, astrological cosmology is accepted in how the cosmos in constructed. The ascent and descent of the soul through the planetary spheres, and each sphere’s characteristics, is a common concept detected in several contexts within late antique culture. The different elements of what constitutes divinity in a culture, and its rela-tionship to astrology and the daimonic, have also been addressed in this study. Examinations of astrological practices have pointed up the fluidity of role between god and daimon, and even the distinctions between them. This can be seen in the way, for example, that decans are used in astrology. The devel-opment of the astrological doctrine of the thema mundi, the world’s birthday, yields not only the birth of the world but the birth of a deity. By focusing on astrological practice, our understanding of the meaning and influence of the divine on humans is expanded and clarified."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"394Conclusion2.6 The Influence of the Myth of ErThe Myth of Er comes up again and again in the book as a paradigm for the personal, guiding daimon leading a soul through life. The Myth of Er provides a philosophical justification for the lots as used in astrology: daimon and for-tune are integral to the system of lots, and the Ascendant as the projection point represents the zodiacal moment of birth. Ananke’s presence is large in the Myth of Er as well: she is the mother of the Moirai, the compulsion of the souls to choose a life based on where their lot falls, the turner of the spindle of time and space, and thus connected to the world of generation. Plotinus accepts Plato’s version of the spindle, planets and Moirai (Ennead II, 3.9), and that souls choose their lives but are affected by planetary configura-tions at birth. In Porphyry’s interpretation, the moment of birth described in the Myth becomes linked with natal astrology and the choosing of a daimon to guide a life. In his essay On What is Up to Us, the daimon accompanies the soul into life, and the soul picks the life and incarnates at the proper astrolog-ical moment. 2.7 Porphyry as a Link between Plato, the Daimon, Astrology and FateIt is rather astonishing how well Porphyry’s specialised knowledge dovetails with an examination of the daimon in astrology. His treatise On Abstinence gives summaries of all the different kinds of daimons. On the Cave of the Nymphs deals not only with astrological cosmology but also mentions the pro-pitiation of a natal daimon. His Letter to Anebo brings up the issue of find-ing an analogue of the personal daimon in the birthchart. His Introduction to the Tetrabiblos gives instructions for finding a house-master and lord of the geniture in the chart, which may be considered to represent the personal dai-mon. His On What is Up to Us applies astrological criteria to the entrance of souls into life, accompanied by their personal daimon; he interprets the Myth of Er in light of natal astrology. One might even suggest that he is trying to do for natal astrology in theurgy what Iamblichus does for katarchic astrology in theurgy. Porphyry is the literal link between Plotinus and Iamblichus. He is also a link between Neo-Platonism and astrology, and surely was an influence on Proclus. His knowledge of Plato allows him to integrate the daimon, astrology and fate. And certainly his zeal for finding a personal daimon in the birthchart links the personal daimon to astrological practice."},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":" 395Conclusion3 Tying Off the ThreadsIn summation, this book has demonstrated the significance of the daimon within Hellenistic astrological theory and practice. It has shown the influence of religious and philosophical notions of the daimon on astrology, as well as astrology’s manifest incorporations of these views. It has shown the possible use of astrology in theurgical practice and the practice of astrology reflecting current ideas about fate and providence. It has established traditions in astrol-ogy hitherto unrecognised by scholarship. It has shown the influence of the daimon within astrology on other aspects and facets of culture in the ancient Mediterranean world. It has revealed, in the case of the concepts of Fortune, Daimon, Love and Necessity, that astrology, more than religion or philosophy, has been able to connect these concepts in a concrete way.The tapestry can always be expanded. Even the most compact area of study turns up additional and enticing subjects to explore. Keeping within the limi-tations of the time-frame I set for this study (ca. second century BCE—seventh century CE) meant that forays into the daimon’s reception within Arabic astrol-ogy were few. This would be rewarding future research. Another area crying out for more attention is evidence of Egyptian components within Hellenistic astrology, especially as sources of later techniques. Such topics have begun to be covered by Egyptologists, but work by experts in astrology would enhance the richness of this research: it is an area ripe for scholarly collaboration. As an example, the relationship of the decans to the Hellenistic ὡροσκόπος has recently been explored.2 Another area of particular interest for me is the Egyptian influence on Manilius. A thorough study of Porphyry’s Introduction to the Tetrabiblos is another worthwhile project; as is a study of the astrology in his essay On What is Up to Us.3 The topics explored in this book will, I hope, change the automatic percep-tion of astrology as a fate-bound and fatalistic practice, as tied to the tenets of a fixed and unalterable destiny as any of its adherents were supposed to have been. Astrology in antiquity is far more nuanced in its understanding of what is non-negotiable and what is up to us, just as many philosophies of this time are (Stoicism comes particularly to mind). Because of Hellenistic astrology’s increasing marginalism in the face of those who would deny it on religious, 2 In 2009, after my dissertation was completed, I collaborated with Micah Ross on this topic, first at the conference ‘Social and Religious Development of Egypt in the First Millennium BCE’, Prague, 1–4 September 2009 and then in an article resulting from that conference.3 This last will be the topic of my forthcoming article in Neoplatonic Demons and Angels, eds Luc Brisson and Andrei Timotin, to be published by Brill."},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"396Conclusionphilosophical or ‘scientific’ grounds, its philosophical and doctrinal views, with some important exceptions, have been unknown, ignored or misrepre-sented in scholarship.

The latter are called the ‘luminaries’. Often the term ‘planets’ refers to all seven visible bodies.1.2 Zodiac SignsThe twelve zodiac signs, from Aries to Pisces,2 are the backdrop on which the plan-ets are placed and through which they move more or less in order.3 In the astrologi-cal chart which shows both planets and signs arranged in relation both to zodiacal order and to diurnal motion,4 the planets (including the Sun and the Moon) are each 1 But ‘houses’ in modern astrology.2 The beginning of the (tropical) zodiac at Aries had been long established among the Greeks. The tropical zodiac is tied to the seasons; i.e., every year on the vernal equinox the sun is at 0° Aries. In the 2nd century BCE, Hipparchus placed the vernal point at the begin-ning of Aries. Antiochus of Athens (2nd century CE) explains the beginning of the zodiac with Aries because 1) Aries rules the head, the dominant human part, 2) Aries begins the spring and 3) spring (Aries) is associated with the first of the ages of man. See Antiochus, Thesaurus, Prooemium, in CCAG I, 142.4–143.10. For Ptolemy the zodiac starts with Aries because the wet excess of spring is its initial cause (Tetrabiblos I, 10, Hübner, 41–43).3 Though this order was not always linear and in one direction, as the planets from Mercury to Saturn could be seen to stop, move backwards, and then move forward again; the Moon could also be seen to move north and south in declination (latitude from the celestial equator). The planets also appear to move west to east as they move through the zodiac (called ‘zodiacal’ or ‘secondary’ motion). These planetary motions were contrasted with the Sun, which regularly rose in the east and set in the west every day, a motion termed ‘diurnal’ or ‘primary’.4 See n. 3."},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"APPENDIX i.A400placed, depending on where in the zodiac they fall, in one of twelve compartments called places.51.3 The PlacesEach place consists of one zodiac sign6 and each is concerned with a particular area of life. The starting point for the chart is at the degree (μοῖρα)7 rising on the eastern hori-zon at the time of birth (called the Hōroskopos, ‘Hour-marker’, later called Ascendant), and the entire 30-degree segment of both circle and zodiac sign in which this degree falls becomes the first place, called ‘Life’ (ζωή).8 The second place is ‘Livelihood’ (βίος), the third ‘Moon Goddess’ (θεὰ Σελήνης), fourth ‘The Underground’9 (ὑπόγειον), fifth ‘Good Fortune’ (ἀγαθὴ τύχη), sixth ‘Bad Fortune’ (κακὴ τύχη), seventh ‘Setting Place’ 5 Several authors mention an eight-compartment system (the ‘Octatropos’ or ‘eight-turning’) including Julius Firmicus Maternus (Mathesis, II, 14), Antiochus (Introduction, 25, CCAG VIII/3, 117), and the anonymous author of P. Mich.inv. 1, 149 (col. ix.20–27). See Goold’s intro-duction, following Housman, in Manilius, Astronomica, lxi–lxii). Valens mentions an ‘okta­tropos’ once, without elaboration, in IX, 3.5 (Pingree, 321.9).6 By far the most prevalent among Hellenistic astrologers is this ‘one place/one sign’ system (called ‘Whole Sign’ by modern traditional astrologers). This is not to say that astrologers were unaware of the earth’s inclination which put the ecliptic at about a 23.5º tilt and, conse-quently, often made for a less than 90º angle between the rising and culminating degrees in an astrological chart (depending on the rising time of the sign on the eastern horizon); what is now known as the Porphyry place-system is described in Valens, III, 2 (Pingree, 127.17–128.26). But the whole sign/place system showed areas of life, while the rising or culminating angles (and those that set and anti-culminated) described the relative strength or power of signs or planets within that system. Yet all of Valens’ chart delineations use a one place/one sign system (thanks to Robert Hand for bringing this to my attention). Paulus Alexandrinus (378 CE) showed he was aware of this in his Introduction, ch. 30, ‘On the Midheaven’: ‘But it is necessary to know that the Midheaven degree does not always fall in the tenth from the Hour-marker, on account of the inequality of the zodiac sign’s temporal ascension, but sometimes on the ninth, sometimes on the eleventh.’ (Boer, 82.7–10): εἰδέναι δὲ χρή, ὅτι ἡ μεσουρανοῦσα μοῖρα οὐ πάντοτε ἐν τῷ δεκάτῳ πίπτει ἀπὸ τοῦ ὡροσκόπου διὰ τὸ ἄνισον τῆς τῶν ζῳδίων χρονικῆς ἀναφορᾶς, ἀλλ’ ὁτὲ μὲν ἐπὶ τοῦ ἐνάτου, ὁτὲ δὲ ἐπὶ τοῦ ἑνδεκάτου. Olympiodorus, Paulus’s 6th-century commentator, appears to be the first of the Hellenistic astrologers to suggest that the quadrant system (in this case, the one later ascribed to Porphyry) be used for the places as significators of areas of life: cf. Commentary on Paulus, Boer 75–76; also Greenbaum, Late Classical Astrology, 118–20. For more on this topic, see R. Hand, Whole Sign Houses: The Oldest House System (Reston, VA: ARHAT, 2000), esp. 9–17; idem, ‘Signs as Houses (Places) in Ancient Astrology’, Culture and Cosmos 11.1 and 2 (2007): 135–62.7 The same word as that used for the goddess of fate (see below, 3.3., ‘Moira’).8 See, e.g., Valens II, 16.1 (Pingree, 67.7); IV, 12.1, (Pingree, 170.2); Paulus, ch. 24 (Boer, 54.1).

Each place is responsible for a certain area of life: for example, the fourth place represents parents, among other things, and the seventh place marriage (again, among other things).10The places vary in effectiveness; the first, fourth, seventh and tenth are called ‘cen-trepins’ (κέντρα in Greek, cardines in Latin, modern ‘angles’) and are considered to be ‘operative’ or ‘productive’ (χρηματιστικός). The second, fifth, eighth and eleventh are ‘post-ascensions’ (ἐπαναφοραί) of the centrepins (called ‘succedent’) and are moder-ately effective. The fifth and eleventh, because they are in aspect to the Hour-marker (Ascendant) (see below, 1.6, Aspects), are considered to be better than the second and eighth (which make no aspect to the Ascendant).

Geometry and proportion were very important in the systematization of astrology by the Greeks. So the places are even, 30-degree segments of the circle,11 and the signs of the zodiac are 30-degree, even segments of the ecliptic. The signs of the zodiac are arranged in symmetrical ways: as groups of tropical, solid and bicorporeal signs;12 as groups of fiery, earthy, airy or watery signs (Valens is the first to assign elements to these groups of signs).13 These last are called ‘triplicities’ and are involved in one of the dignity systems we shall discuss below.TABLE i.� Signs of the quadruplicitiesTropical signs: Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn(Solsticial and Equinoctial)Solid Signs: Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius(Also called Fixed)Bicorporeal Signs: Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces(Also called Mutable)11 Such a division derives from the Babylonian practice in which the unequal size of the zodiacal constellations developed into a zodiac of equal 30-degree segments; evidence of this dates to the fifth-century BCE (see F. Rochberg, The Heavenly Writing: Divination, Horoscopy, and Astronomy in Mesopotamian Culture (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), 130). We have evidence that the earliest extant charts (1st century CE), charts were round in shape, as were the astrological boards used to lay out charts for clients.

They can also be sorted based on their allegiance to the day or night—and to the rulers of the day and night, the Sun and the Moon: this is called sect. These add to the ways in which the Greeks created a beautiful, symmetrical, organised whole out of their system of astrology. Sect is an important doctrine in Hellenistic astrology and is often crucial in chart interpretation.Sect (hairesis in Greek, which means choice, but also faction), divides the planets into two factions. The nocturnal faction is led by the Moon; the diurnal faction by the Sun. Diurnal planets are happier, more consistent and better and more balanced in their effects when they are placed in a diurnal chart (where the Sun is above the hori-zon); nocturnal planets, conversely, behave better when in a nocturnal chart. In this way, they align with the natural order of sect.1414 See the comprehensive article of G. Bezza, ‘The Development of an Astrological Term—from Greek hairesis to Arabic ḥayyiz’, Culture and Cosmos 11, no. 1 and 2 (2007): 229–60.FIGURE i.� Sect.The Sect of the PlanetsDay SectSun (leader)JupiterSaturnNight SectMoon (leader)VenusMarsMercury"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"APPENDIX i.A404Thus Jupiter and Saturn prefer day charts, with the Sun above the horizon; and the Moon, Venus and Mars prefer night charts, with the Sun below the horizon. Mercury is ambivalent; in some schemes, if it is ahead of the Sun (in earlier zodiacal longitude), it is considered to be diurnal; when behind the Sun it is nocturnal.Benefic planets are Venus (the lesser benefic) and Jupiter (the greater benefic). Malefic planets are Mars (the lesser malefic) and Saturn (the greater malefic).The Chaldean order of the planets (based on their distance from earth and/or on their orbital cycles) is (from farthest/longest to nearest/shortest) Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon. This was the standard order for astrologers. Egyptian (Platonic) order (which Plato uses in Republic, X.616e; Timaeus 38d) is Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Moon.15 The Chaldean order is used in naming the days of the week in which, e.g., starting with Saturday, Saturn’s day, the first hour of the day belongs to Saturn, the second to Jupiter, the third to Mars, the fourth to the Sun, the fifth to Venus, the sixth to Mercury and the seventh to the Moon. The assign-ments repeat with the eighth hour belonging to Saturn, etc. The scheme is ordered so that the last hour of the day belongs to the planet before the ruler of the next day, so Saturday’s hours end with Mars, and then the first hour of the next day, Sunday, belongs to the Sun.1.5 FamiliarityCongruence, equal-ascension and equipollence provide conditions of familiarity between planets. Congruent signs are those ruled (by domicile) by the same planets: e.g. Aries and Scorpio are congruent, because both are ruled by Mars. Equally-ascending signs are those that ascend in the same amount of time (called ‘contra-antiscia’ in modern astrology). Equipollent signs are those that have the same amount of (sea-sonal) daylight (called ‘antiscia’ in modern astrology). Certain signs ‘see’ each other; and others ‘hear’ (some ‘command’ and some ‘obey’). See the diagrams overleaf.1.6 AspectsGeometrical relationships between planets provide ways for them to be in contact with one another. Accepted aspects were the conjunction (0º angular separation), the sex-tile (60º), the square (90º), the trine (120º) and the opposition (180º); these are called ‘Ptolemaic’ aspects. They can be either beneficial or difficult: trines and sextiles are considered to be good, but squares and oppositions bad. In observing the places which are called ‘daimon’ and ‘fortune’, the ‘good’ places, the fifth (Good Fortune) and the eleventh (Good Daimon) form, respectively, a trine and a sextile to the Hour-marker, thus reinforcing their goodness and ability to give benefits to the native, whose life as 15 For Chaldean order, see R.

Only planets/signs/places ‘in aspect’ could see each other and thus have a relationship, whether harmonious or inharmonious.

Venus and Jupiter are in their ‘joy’ in the fifth and eleventh places respectively. The concept of planets having ‘joy’ in a certain place of the astro-logical chart is delineated in the fourth-century Introduction of Paulus Alexandrinus (Chapter 24), but the doctrine is older.18Whether the reason the benefics were said to ‘rejoice’ in the fifth or eleventh place relates to the previous concept that these places were in harmonious aspect to the Hour-marker,19 joys still embrace the symmetry of Hellenistic astrology: the benefics each take a ‘good’ place, Venus being associated with Fortune and Jupiter being associ-ated with Daimon. And of course, in contrast but still symmetrical, the malefics, Mars and Saturn, are then said to rejoice respectively in the sixth and the twelfth. In comple-mentarity to the doctrine of planetary joys, diurnal planets (Sun, Jupiter and Saturn) rejoice in places above the horizon, and nocturnal planets (Moon, Venus and Mars) in places below it.201.7 DignitiesUsing the word ‘dignity’ to describe the various rulerships of planets in zodiac signs is an anachronism in Hellenistic astrology;21 I use it for convenience here to refer to houses, exaltations, triplicities, bounds (terms) and faces. The most well-known ruler-ship is that which the ancients called ‘house’, e.g., Aries and Scorpio are the houses of Mars, Taurus and Libra are the houses of Venus, etc.18 See W. Hübner, ‘Les divinités planétaires de la Dodécatropos’, in Les astres: actes du col­loque international de Montpellier, 23–25 mars 1995, 2 vols., vol. 1: Les astres et les mythes, la description du ciel, ed. Béatrice Bakhouche, Alain Maurice Moreau, and Jean-Claude Turpin (Montpellier: Université Paul Valéry, 1996), 307–17. Manilius has his own variant system of planetary joys which is different from the standard one discussed here. See also D. Houlding, The Houses: Temples of the Sky (Mansfield, Notts: Ascella, 1998), esp. 35–38. Valens makes a few references to a planet being in a place where it ‘rejoices’ (II, 32) but does not describe the system. In III, 5 he speaks of planets rejoicing when placed in the chart according to their sect, and that Venus rejoices in the Hour-marker and Midheaven (this may refer back to Manilius’s system of planetary joys). Other planets rejoice in the Hour-marker or Setting Place (Descendant). Antiochus of Athens also mentions a system of planetary joys that is more generalised than the standard one outlined by Paulus; see Antiochus, Thesaurus, ch. 44, CCAG I, 159.20–29.19 Houlding, Houses, notes this possibility, 42.20 This is part of the doctrine of sect (hairesis); see above, 1.4 and Fig. i.2, 403.21 Bezza, ‘Hairesis to ḥayyiz’, 239–40."},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"APPENDIX i.A408The luminaries rule one sign apiece, and the other five planets each rule two signs, in order from Leo and Cancer as in Figure I.6. Again, the symmetry so prized by the Greeks is evident. Exaltation is another system of rulership: the Sun is exalted in Aries, Moon in Taurus, Jupiter in Cancer, Mercury in Virgo (where it is also house ruler), Saturn in Libra, Mars in Capricorn and Venus in Pisces.22The doctrine of triplicity rulers assigns certain planets the rule of certain signs based on their elements (fire, earth, air and water) and on their sect. Triplicity lords become important in estimating the conditions at different times in the life of the native. The first triplicity lord is the lord of the sect, e.g. in a day chart, if the Sun is in a fire sign, then he is the first triplicity lord; in a night chart, if the Moon is in an air sign, then Mercury is the first triplicity lord. The position and sign of the triplicity lords predict the condition of that time.TABLE I.3 Triplicity lordsFireEarthAirWater(Day) Sun(Day) Venus(Day) Saturn(Day) Venus(Night) Jupiter(Night) Moon(Night) Mercury(Night) Mars22 See the descriptions in Antiochus, Thesaurus, 7, CCAG I, 147–48.FIGURE i.6 Planetary house rulers."},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"APPENDIX i.A 409Bounds (ὅρια, termini or fines in Latin, also called ‘terms’ in English) are specific degrees of signs assigned to particular planets. A number of different bound systems were used in Hellenistic astrology, but the most common is the system of Egyptian bounds. Bounds are utilised in some length of life determinations. Faces divide each sign into three segments of ten degrees, each ruled by a planet beginning with Mars ruling the first face of Aries, and continuing the rulerships in the Chaldean order of the planets (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon). Overleaf is a table of dignities, including the Egyptian bounds and the faces.2 Astrological Techniques2.1 LotsLot calculation was briefly described in the Introduction. The calculation of a lot is usually dependent on whether the chart is diurnal or nocturnal; in other words, on its sect.

Using the shorter arc between the two planets (in this case, 32º), one projects it from the Ascendant in the same direction it was obtained, i.e. from Sun to Moon, clockwise. The 32º segment thus goes clockwise (in diurnal order) from the Ascendant to create the Lot of Fortune. The Lot of Daimon, which by day takes the arc from Moon to Sun, then goes in the opposite direction, in zodiacal, anti-clockwise motion. In the calculation of these ‘mirrored’ lots, they will always be projected from opposite sides of the Ascendant.Most lots use the Ascendant as a projection point, but there are a few exceptions. The lots discussed in this book, though, are not in the latter category.2.2 Planetary PeriodsPlanets are associated with different periods of years in prediction techniques. Commonly used periods are least (minor), middle and maximum. The minor periods are mostly based on recurrence cycles with the Sun.24 These are discussed in Vettius Valens, IV, 6 (see Chapter Nine, 322 and n. 61). In the Egyptian bounds system, the amount of bounds for each planet adds up to the maximum (final) years for that planet (see Paulus, ch. 3). Mean years are mentioned in Valens, III, 13.2.3 Katarchic AstrologyMuch of Hellenistic astrological writing centres on natal astrology (genethlialogy). But there is also a branch of astrology called ‘katarchic’, in which charts are chosen at astro-logically propitious times for events or rituals (these are also called ‘elections’); charts 24 See Neugebauer and Van Hoesen, GH, 10–11.TABLE i.5 Years of the planetsPlanetMinor (Least)Middle (Mean)Maximum (Final)☉1969.5120☽2566.5108☿204876♀84582♂1540.566♃1245.579♄3043.557"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"APPENDIX i.A4��of events after they have occurred are analyzed for outcomes; and charts are created for the moment of a question about an event, then analysed for outcomes based on the moment of the question (also called ‘interrogations’). The propitious time, or oppor-tune moment, is kairikos (see Chapter One, 3.5, 40–41; Chapter Seven, 1.2, 247–48).3 Terminology3.1 AphetēsThe aphetēs has been traditionally understood as a kind of starting point.25 LSJ, s.v., defines it as ‘prorogator’—a term which, though technically correct, hardly conveys a meaning to the modern ear. None of these capture the real sense of ἀφέτης. It is, in truth, a ‘releaser’ (coming as it does from the verb ἀφίημι, literally, ‘send away from’).26 In the chart, planets and points which are aphetic are, in a way, like bows releasing an arrow aimed at a certain spot; which kind of bow depends on the questions asked of the chart. There are numerous systems in which aphetic points are employed.3.2 MelothesiaAstrological melothesia assigns body parts to planets, signs or even lots.27 It is a fairly common practice in Hellenistic astrology, and continued in popularity in the Middle Ages. In this book, melothesia is discussed in Chapter Four (P. Michigan inv.1, 149) and Chapter Nine (Valens, II, 37)3.3 MoiraThe Greek word translated as ‘fate’ in this book is εἱμαρμένη, literally meaning ‘that which has been allotted’ (from the verb μείρομαι).28 Μοῖρα, another noun often trans-lated as ‘fate’, also comes from meiromai. Moira’s first definition in LSJ is a ‘portion’, as of land;29 in other words, a physical and material expression of allotment. In Greek astrology, of course, moira is simply the word for a degree of the zodiac—but, per-haps not so simply, it may point out a relationship between fate and the degrees 25 E.g. Bouché-Leclercq, AG, 415: ‘points de départ’; Neugebauer and Van Hoesen, GH, 12: ‘starter’.26 For more on the concept of ἀφέτης as releaser, see R. Schmidt in Vettius Valens. The Anthology Book IV, trans. R. Schmidt (Berkeley Springs, WV: Golden Hind Press, 1996), Translator’s Preface, xiii–xvi.27 For more on the different kinds of melothesia, see Bezza, AM, vol. 2, 677, 680, 722–32, 741–44.28 LSJ, s.v.29 Ibid., s.v. μοῖρα, I.2."},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"APPENDIX i.A 4�3of the zodiac—the individual ‘portions’ of fate where planets, the Hour-marker and the Midheaven just happen to fall. It may be just a coincidence that this is the word the Greek astrologers decided to use for ‘degree of the zodiac’ but, if it has nothing to do with any kind of fate, why not use a word like μερίς (a part, portion, division)30 or βαθμός (step, threshold, degree)31 which have no connection to fate in their definitions?32 Jane Harrison has remarked that the Moirai and the Horai (the Hours), all of whom are the daughters of Zeus and Themis, represent both spatial and temporal allotments or apportionments.33 Moira appears to have been first used as a technical term, dividing portions of the sky into even segments, by Aratus, who calls a twelfth part of the zodia-cal circle a moira.34 Hipparchus is the first to use moira as one ‘portion’ (i.e. degree) of a zodiac sign,35 and Geminus defines it as a thirtieth part of a sign.36 But there is even earlier evidence of moira as a portion of the night sky which shows the passage of time, in Homer: ‘As the stars have gone forward, and more than two portions of the night have passed, only a third portion is left’.37 To Homer, of course, moira is also fate.This connection between a degree of the zodiac and fate is explicitly seen in at least one example in Late Antiquity. Censorinus, writing in 238 CE, in De die natali, makes 30 Ibid., s.v.31 Used by Valens, I, 16.4 (Pingree, 30.7–9), as meaning 15 degrees of the zodiac, but the ques-tion is still relevant: why was moira chosen in the first place?32 See also the argument of R.

Of course, by the time of Geminus, the Hellenised system of astrology was well underway.37 Iliad, X.252–3 (Allen): ἄστρα δὲ δὴ προβέβηκε, παρόιχωκεν δὲ πλέων νὺξ / τῶν δύο μοιράων, τριτᾶτη δ’ ἔτι μοῖρα λέλειπται."},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"APPENDIX i.A4�4a specific correlation between the Moirai who are the Fates and the moirai/degrees of the zodiac: ‘There are thirty of these “little parts” in one zodiac sign, so a total of 360 in the whole zodiac.

Note the description of the oikodespotēs as ‘natural’. Many of the planetary longitudes are lost; Neugebauer and Van Hoesen have inferred the positions of Sun and Moon by the positions of their dodekatēmoria. If these positions are correct, then the predominator for this diurnal chart ought to be the Sun in the Midheaven. But we have no way of knowing what degree the ancient astrologer thought the Sun was, so we cannot determine what bounds he thought the Sun was in (between 6 and 12 degrees of Aries would be the bounds of Venus; Neugebauer and Van Hoesen posit 11 degrees). Since Mercury is with the Sun in the Midheaven, perhaps it functions as a co-oikodespotēs.oikodespotēs. In fact, the superior conjunction took place on the 31st of March. I believe this phrase refers to the phase of visibility that Mercury has recently had with rela-tion to the Sun. Neugebauer and Van Hoesen, 28, commentary to col. VII, think that it is the superior conjunction that made Mercury ‘dominate the theme’. In fact, it is because both of the possible predominators (Moon and Ascendant) have Mercury as their bound-lord, and it was recently in a phase of visibility. These criteria fit both with Valens/Dorotheus and with Porphyry’s later instructions.3. No. 95 in GHP. Lond. 98Dated to 13 April 95 CEText and TranslationCol.

But we do not know the position of Mercury in this chart (only that it would have to be close to the Sun, and therefore probably in Sagittarius or Capricorn). The juxtaposition of ‘support’ (hupostasis) and oikodespotēs here brings to mind a passage from Rhetorius (in CCAG VIII/4, 207.20–21, probably citing Valens, IX, 2.14 [Pingree, 320.15–19]) which claims that when a support is well-placed, it makes the natives able to lead, royal, and fit for command.

[Then a brief biography is given, 158.7–13.]— In this disposition, the house-master of the Moon, Kronos, since he happened to be in his own house, gives his complete years of life, 56; since Aphrodite also witnesses him, she also gives another 8 years, so the total years are 64. — Why these things happened to him is worked out in this manner: He became emperor because the two luminaries were on the hour-marking [place], and especially because the Moon was in sect and conjoining both the Hour-marker and Zeus by degree, [Zeus] which is also about to make its phase of visibility ahead of the Sun after seven days; and also their spear-bearers [i.e. the Moon’s and Sun’s] were themselves found in their own affiliations, namely Aphrodite being in her own exaltation, Ares in his own triplicity and having his position in his own degrees [i.e. bounds], both of them on their own places3 and post-ascending to the Moon.Rationale for choice of oikodespotēs:Antigonus treats this chart as nocturnal.4 The importance of the Moon (the nocturnal sect ruler) in the consideration of lifespan is evident; she seems to be the predomina-tor, and her house-lord, Kronos, the oikodespotēs. The Moon is also said to be ‘in sect’,5 which reinforces the treatment of the chart as nocturnal; and her spear-bearers are discussed first. Note again that Antigonus is using the house-lord of the luminary/pre-dominator as the oikodespotēs, not the bound-lord. It is Saturn which gives its complete years (though actually the usual amount of years for Saturn in Capricorn is 57, not 56) for length of life. Again, as Mars does in L40, Saturn has relationships with a number of planets in the chart; it receives Sun, Moon, Mercury, Jupiter and the Ascendant as the house-lord of Capricorn and Aquarius.3 Here meaning dignities: Aphrodite by exaltation and Ares by triplicity.4 In the study I did of extant charts containing the Lots of Fortune and Daimon—see my arti-cle, ‘The Lots of Fortune and Daemon in Extant Charts from Antiquity (First Century BCE to Seventh Century CE)’, MHNH, 8 (2008): 173–90—with very few exceptions, charts which have the Sun in the first place are treated as diurnal. Obviously the degree of the sun is being considered here, whereas most other examples do not give degrees.5 Neugebauer and Van Hoesen, GH, 90 and n. 10, have mistranslated ‘τῆς αἱρέσεως’ as ‘of the (same) sect’ and said in the note that ‘meaning not clear’.

The sun is in a good place, and rising (and in its sign of exaltation). So it will be the predom-inator, and Antigonus again takes its house-lord, Mars, as the oikodespotēs. Mars is in a good place (the eleventh), and in a phase of visibility (both, incidentally, considered important by Porphyry for a planet to be the lord of the nativity). Mars in Aquarius is used to show his death by the hand of a man (because Aquarius is a human sign) and at age 25, because the rising time of Aquarius is 25º.

P (2506) shows clearly 29;43 (in the scan I saw, this was cut off by the binding).8 Again, ms. P (Par. gr. 2506) shows a glyph for ♈, not ♉, and Neugebauer and Van Hoesen, 146, n. 4 say that ‘computation and “terms” require Aries’.9 Using my (and Neugebauer and Van Hoesen’s, 146, nn. 5 and 6) reading of the ms., which clearly shows ‘12’ for the degrees and the symbol for ‘Venus’ for the terms [].10 Saturn rules the air triplicity by day.11 My emendation, based on autopsy of the ms. Neugebauer and Van Hoesen have seen that there are things wrong with the passage, and suggested that Venus must be involved in receiving planets as well as Saturn (they also suggest how she receives them), but they have not made an emendation to the text, and have merely translated the text in its con-fused state (see p. 146 and n. 7). In fact, they have mistranslated part of the passage: ‘We find Saturn receiving, in its terms only, sun and moon’. Saturn does receive only the Sun by term (it is the bound-lord of the 30th degree of Pisces); but it receives the Moon not only by bound, but also by triplicity (it rules air in a diurnal chart) and exaltation (it is exalted in Libra). I thank Stephan Heilen for sending me a facsimile of the ms. page, and his advice in wording the emendation. I have based the emendation’s length on the length of the average line in Par. gr. 2506, fol. 21v; the content of the emendation is based on the pre-sumed ‘jump’ of the scribe’s eye to the line below, which begins with ὑψώματι, and Venus’s receptions of Saturn by bounds (Saturn at 25° Libra is in Venus’s bounds [Egyptian]); and the Sun, Mars and Mercury by triplicity and exaltation (all three are in Pisces, whose exaltation is Venus and whose triplicity by day is also Venus).12 Venus rules the water triplicity by day, and the earth triplicity by day.13 See Ptolemy, Tetr.

The paragraph prior to this chart gives instructions for finding an oikodespotēs, which says one should use the bound- and house-lords of the luminar-ies and the Ascendant; but also the planet found to have more ‘claims’ or ‘relation-ships’ (logos) in the nativity, by which he seems to mean relationships by dignity with the planets in the nativity. (This seems to incorporate both Ptolemy’s ideas about an oikodespotēs and what Porphyry writes about the kurios.) The explanation at the end combines these two criteria, giving more weight for the primary oikodespotēs to the bound-lord of the luminaries (Saturn) than to Venus, which actually has more rela-tionships to the planets in the nativity. The greater amount of Venus’s relationships, though, provides her status as co-oikodespotēs. Thus Saturn becomes the housemas-ter, and Venus the co-housemistress. (This explanatory section only makes sense with the emendation I have proposed.) These later literary charts (see also #12 in this list) show the incorporation of Ptolemy’s ideas (which will become what is known as the ‘almuten’) coupled with Porphyry’s, as a means for determining the oikodespotēs of the nativity. 11a, b and c.

In this case, it is Venus, who is the house-lord of the Ascendant, the Moon, Zeus and the Lot of Fortune; even though she is not the almuten of the Ascendant (it is Saturn), she is positioned far better than Saturn, since she is in the eleventh, a good place and, as the text tells us, she is in a phase of visibility ahead of the sun, direct in motion and will be in a tenth-place position to the Moon in three days (when the Moon goes into Scorpio, where Venus’s dodekatēmorion also is). However, the interpretation of this chart was faulty; the astrologer did not take into account certain deficiencies of Venus, and the fact that Saturn has the stronger claim in the Ascendant (other things not relevant to the oikodespotēs also come into play here).17 Using the genitives for Moon, Zeus and the Lot of Fortune, as in CCAG I, 106.9–11: καὶ τὴν Ἀφροδίτην [κατὰ = κυρίαν] τοῦ ὡροσκόπου καὶ τῆς Σελήνης καὶ τοῦ Διὸς καὶ τοῦ κλήρου τῆς τύχης ἀγαθοδαιμονοῦσαν καὶ ἑῴαν ἀνατολικὴν. . . .18 Again, not exactly true, because Venus is the house-lord of Libra.

For he says the predominator is the one of the two luminaries which predominates over the theme’s birth hour, and some say that by day the Sun predominates, but by night the Moon. To be precise, when the Sun happens to be in the east in a diurnal geniture, he himself has the predomination because he rules over the day, but if he is declining by day in the west, if the Moon is in the east, she will pre-dominate; likewise even if she happens to be in the post­ascension of the Hour­marker [i.e. the second place], while the Sun is declining from the east, she will have the pre-domination; but when both of them are declining in the west, the Hour­marker will take the predomination. For a nocturnal nativity, if the Moon is being carried up in the east, she herself will take the power; but if she is declining in the west, the Sun post­ascending to the Hour­marker, even if still under the earth will himself predominate; but if both are under the earth . . . . . . ."},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"appendix 7.b 44�Porphyry:30.

For each has its own power, just like a skipper and a pilot; so we will teach how they are different from each other. Now some hold that the Sun by day and the Moon by night predominate, but it is set out precisely like this: for a diurnal nativity the Sun, if it is being carried up in the east, will itself take the predomination; but when the Sun is declining on the west [side of the chart], if the Moon is in the east, that one [the Moon] will take it, even if she is post­ascending the Hour­marker, because she is going up toward the east.

But if she is declining on the west [side of the chart], but the Sun, though still under the earth is post­ascending the Hour­marker, that one will predominate. If both [luminaries] happen to be under the earth, on centrepins or post-ascending, the Moon will hold the predomination because of sect.

On housemaster, lord and predominator.Furthermore, precise definitions are required to differentiate house-master of the nativity, lord and predominator from one another. For the ancients [5] entangle the names up and do not distinguish their characteristics. For each has its own power, just like a skipper and a pilot; so we will teach how they are different from each other. Now some hold that the Sun by day and the Moon by night predominate, but it is set out precisely like this: for a diurnal nativity the Sun, if [10] it is being carried up in the"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"appendix 7.C 443east, will itself take the predomination; but when the Sun is declining on the west [side of the chart], if the Moon happens to be in the east, that one [the Moon] will take it, even if she is post-ascending the Hour-marker, because she is going up on the east [side of the chart]. But if both [the luminaries] are declining on the west [side], the Hour-marker will hold the predomination. For a nocturnal [15] nativity, if the Moon is being carried up on the east [side], she herself will take the predomination. But if she is declining on the west [side of the chart], but the Sun, though still under the earth is post-ascending the Hour-marker, that one will predominate. If both [luminaries] hap-pen to be under the earth, on centrepins or post-ascending, the Moon will hold the predomination because of sect. [20] But if she is found to have declined [from a cen-trepin], but he [the Sun] is on a centrepin, he [will predominate]. For generally the luminary that is more on a centrepin, and more in the east and of the sect is judged to be the predominator. If both [the luminaries] are declining [from centrepins], then the Hour-marker will obtain the predomination. But when you have determined the pre-dominator, the housemaster [p. 207] will be taken from this, and the co-housemaster.(207.) ὁ μὲν γὰρ κύριοςτοῦ ζῳδίου, ἐν ᾧ ἐστιν ὁ ἐπικρατήτωρ, οἰκοδεσπότης ἔσται, ὁ δὲτῶν ὁρίων συνοικοδεσπότης. τούτους δεῖ οὖν ἐπισκέπτεσθαι, πῶςκεῖνται καὶ ἐν ποίῳ σχήματί εἰσι καὶ εἰ μαρτυροῦσι τῷ ὡροσκόπῳ[5] ἢ τῇ Σελήνῃ· ἐκ γὰρ τούτων ἡ ὅλη διάκρισις ἔσται. τινὲς δὲ ἁπλῶςτὸν τῶν ὡροσκοπούντων ὁρίων κύριον οἰκοδεσπότην τίθενταιτῆς γενέσεως καὶ συνοικοδεσπότην τὸν τοῦ ζῳδίου. κύριον δὲτῆς γενέσεως οἱ μὲν τὸν τοῦ μεσουρανήματος δεσπότην ὁρίζονται,ἐάνπερ ἐπίκεντρος χρηματίζοι, εἰ δὲ μή, τὸν τῷ μεσουρανήματι[10] ἐπιπαρόντα, ὥσπερ ἐπ’ ἀκροπόλει τῆς γενέσεως ἐπιτυραννοῦντατῆς πράξεως, εἰ δὲ μή, τὸν ἐπαναφερόμενον τῷ μεσουρανήματι·οἱ δὲ πρῶτον μὲν τὸν τοῦ ὡροσκόπου κύριον ἢ τὸν ἐπιβεβηκότααὐτοῦ τῷ οἴκῳ καὶ τοῖς ὁρίοις, εἶτα τὸν τῆς Σελήνης, εἶτα τὸντοῦ μεσουρανήματος, εἶτα τὸν τῆς τύχης, εἶτα τὸν πρὸ ζʹ ἡμερῶν[15] τῆς ἀποκυήσεως ἢ ἐντὸς ζʹ ἡμερῶν φάσιν ἀνατολῆς ἢ δύσεως ἢστηριγμοῦ ποιούμενον. τοῦτον γὰρ τῆς κοσμικῆς ἐπισημασίαςτότε γινόμενον αὐθεντικὸν ὁμολογουμένως καὶ τῶν γεννωμένωνκυριεύειν, ἐὰν δὲ δύο ὦσι, τὸν ἐπανατέλλοντα δυναμικώτερον τί-θενται. τούτοις προσσυλλαμβάνουσι τὸν τῆς συνόδου τῆς προηγου-[20] μένης σεληνιακῆς δεσπότην· λέγω δὴ τὸν τῶν ὁρίων κύριον, ἐνοἷς ἡ σύνοδος τῆς Σελήνης πρὸς Ἥλιον ἐγένετο, ἐάνπερ ἀπὸ συν-όδου φέρηται ἡ Σελήνη· ἐὰν δὲ φθίνουσα ᾖ, τὸν τῆς πανσελήνουτῶν ὁρίων γενόμενον δεσπότην. ἐκ δὲ τούτων πάντων τὸν συμ-παθέστατα πρὸς τὴν γένεσιν κείμενον ἀποφαίνονται κύριον, τουτ-"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":" appendix 7.C444[25] έστι τὸν ἐπικεντρότερον,* τὸν ἀνατολικώτερον ἢ τὸν μᾶλλονἐπ’ οἰκείων τόπων καὶ τὴν πλείστην δύναμιν πρὸς τὸ σχῆματῆς γενέσεως ἔχοντα τούς τε συμμαρτυροῦντας αὐτῷ.* emending ἐπικείμενον πρότερον, which is nonsensical, to ἐπικεντρότερον. (Thanks to Stephan Heilen for suggesting the need for an emendation here.)(207.) For the lordof the sign in which the predominator is will be the housemaster, but the co-housemas-ter [will be the lord] of the bounds. And so it is necessary to investigate these [planets], how they lie and in what figure they are, and if they witness the Hour-marker [5] or the Moon. For the whole determination will be from these. Some simply hold that the housemaster of the nativity is lord of the Hour-marking bounds, and the co-housemas-ter [is] [lord] of the sign. Some define the master of the Midheaven as lord of the nativ-ity, if it is on a centrepin and therefore operative; but if not, the one which is present on the Midheaven, [10] on the summit of the nativity, as it were, ruling over the action; but if not, the one post-culminating to the Midheaven. But some [take] as the foremost one the lord of the Hour-marker or the one which has landed on its house and in its bounds, then that of the Moon, then that of the Midheaven, then that of Fortune, then the one making [15] a phase of emergence, setting or station 7 days before the birth or within 7 days [of the birth]. For [they think that] this one, since it becomes, by com-mon consent, authoritative for the cosmic symptoms at that time, also rules as lord over those who are born then. But if there are two, they make the one in a phase of vis-ibility more potent. To these they add the master of the Concurrence of the preceding [20] lunation; I mean the lord of the bounds in which the Concurrence of the Moon with the Sun came to be, if the Moon is being carried from Concurrence. But if it is waning, the lord of the bounds of the whole Moon. From all these they declare the lord to be the one placed most sympathetically in the nativity, that [25] is the one more on a centrepin, more in a phase of visibility, or more on its own places and having the most power in relation to the figure of the nativity and those co-witnessing it.     περὶ δὲ (207.27)τοῦ εὑρεθέντος κυρίου πῶς δεῖ σκέπτεσθαι, ἐν τοῖς ἑξῆς ῥηθήσεται(208.) καὶ ὅση ἡ ἐκ τούτου δύναμις. πολλὴ γὰρ ἡ περὶ τούτου ζήτησιςκαὶ σχεδὸν ἁπάντων δυσκολωτέρα. ἐνίοτε μέντοι γίνεται τὸν αὐτὸνεὑρεθῆναι κύριον καὶ οἰκοδεσπότην, ὅταν ὁ εὑρεθεὶς κύριος ὁ αὐ-τὸς ᾖ τοῦ ἐπικρατήτορος φωστῆρος οἰκοδεσπότης, ὅσπερ ἄρξει[5] μεγάλου ἀποτελέσματος."},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"appendix 7.C 445But how one must investigate the lord which has been so found will be said next, (208.) and how much power [it has] from this.

On the meaning of the LotsThe Moon’s Lot—the Lot of Fortune—signifies all things in human bodies and the actions in life, reputations, sufferings of the soul and companionship. The Sun’s Lot—the Lot of Daimon—signifies things concerning the soul, character, power, worth, rep-utation and religious rites. The Hour-marker’s Lot—the Lot of Basis—is established as responsible for life and breath; for Basis itself is the giver of breath for the Hour-marker, and signifies bodily things and living abroad. Kronos’s Lot—the Lot of Nemesis—is established [as responsible for] earthly daimons, all hidden things, [their] exposure, insolence, exile, destruction, grief and the quality of death. Zeus’s Lot—the Lot of Victory, for faith, good hope, assembly and community and, moreover, for penalty and reward. Ares’ Lot—the Lot of Courage—is indicative of boldness, plotting, strength and every evil work. Aphrodite’s Lot—the Lot of Eros—signifies appetites, desires and things that come to be by choice, and it is indicative of friendship and favour.

<their lords>, their phases and place positions.2 For if they happen to be averse from the Hour-marker, but are on centrepins with respect to the Lot of Fortune [and are] with benefics, they signify good things for the [person’s] fortune (τύχη), if they happen to be out of the beams. [10] But in these cir-cumstances, if a malefic alone beholds (θεωρέω) the eleventh place from the Lot or the Hour-marker (the so-called ‘acquisitive’ place), <especially when it [the malefic] is not of the same sect and without the beholding of a benefic, it signifies a fall of the fortune. But if in these circumstances another of the malefics beholds> the eighth place from the Hour-marker or the Lot of [15] Fortune or the lord of the eighth place, it shows the figure with banishment and violent death.And if the Lot of Fortune and its lord happen to be well [placed], but the Lot of Daimon and its lord badly [placed] and beheld by malefics, they result in banishment for the nativity, especially for a nocturnal nativity, on account of the Ptolemaic Lot of Fortune actually being the Lot of Daimon.3 If [20] the lord of the Exaltation of the 1 The Lot of Exaltation is found in Valens, II, 19. Its formula is, by day (in a day chart only): Asc + 19º♈ - ☉. The nocturnal formula (used only in a night chart) is Asc + 3º ♉ - ☽. The Lot of Exaltation is used in determining eminence for the native. Sometimes in the examples Valens gives, it is clear that he is using only signs, i.e. Aries or Taurus, not the actual degree of exaltation.2 τοποθεσία, i.e. house position in modern astrological terminology. LSJ, s.v., glosses this word as ‘situation, arrangement of heavenly bodies in regions’ (meaning 2, citing Valens 42.12 [Kroll; = Pingree, 41.21]), but this seems unnecessarily vague to me, since the Valens example, and those in this passage from Rhetorius, clearly mean the position in a place, a.k.a. house, of the chart.3 Ptolemy is one of the few (if not the only) authors to use the Lot of Fortune only in its day formula: Asc + ☽ - ☉ (see Tetrabiblos, IV, 2). So in a nocturnal chart (where the Sun is below"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"appendix 8.c 453Nativity also happens to be badly [placed] or beheld by malefics, it will make demoli-tion <of> honours or actions, idleness and sloth. But if, while the Lot of Fortune is well-placed and (p. 40.1) beheld by benefics, its lord is found in the ninth place from the horoscope, or the lord of Daimon [is also found in the ninth], such a person will make further acquisitions from holy matters or holy places; but if the lord of the lot happens to be in the Underground centrepin, such a one will become a treasurer; and if the Lot of Fortune [5] and its lord happen to be in a wet zodiac sign, such a person will make further acquisitions from watery businesses or naval affairs.And simply, one must proclaim happiness or disappointments according to the nature of the zodiac sign and the place-position <in which> the Lot of Fortune and its lord happened to be.If Ares or Kronos happen to be in the twelfth from Fortune, and either are found in sect, in his own house, triplicity or exaltation, it will make acquisitions from violence [10] and rape, and injustice.4 But know that some configurations in the sixth from the Lot of Fortune also [make] those wronged and betrayed by slave people, as charac-teristic of the sixth place. For the twelfth place from the Lot of Fortune beheld only by malefics, especially those contrary to sect, signifies disappointments in this way: by Ares, from burnings, [15] military affairs, rulers, attacks by robbers or the like; by Kronos, from shipwrecks, lawsuits, old people and clerics, eunuchs or certain reversals because of past matters or dead people.The Lot of Fortune and its lord averse from the Sun make those who are ban-ished, excluding congruence and zodiac signs that are equally-ascending [20] and equipollent.5 But even the lord of the New or Whole Moon in the twelfth <or> eighth from the horoscope make those who are banished, and likewise the New and Whole Moon in the twelfth or eighth. And if more figures and the lords of these are found on <a good> place, properly ordered (p. 41.1) by nature and configuration, both livelihood and honour will persevere.The timing <of> good fortune, misfortune or their inconsistency [is found] from circumambulations (περιπατοί), and contacts (κολλήσεις)6 of all the stars, the Lot of Fortune and that of Daimon. But also from the ascensions (ἀναφοραὶ) of the zodiac signs, as [5] the Egyptians generally do, and from the circular period of each star (that the horizon), what Ptolemy would describe as the Lot of Fortune would actually be the Lot of Daimon.4 Presumably the violence and rape would be from Ares, and injustice from Kronos.5 See definitions and diagrams in Appendix i.A.6 Circumambulations’ are advancing planets in the chart by primary direction; ‘contacts’ are connections of planets by aspect, beginning within a certain orb and continuing up to the time of the exact aspect (see Paulus, ch. 34, Olympiodorus, ch. 38)."},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":" appendix 8.c454is, of the final, middle and least years)7 according to the third klima and two-thirds of the times (that is, the ascensions) of the zodiac signs, and <from> the handings over (παραδόσεις) and takings up (παραλήψεις) of the stars.8 And if the stars are badly con-figured in relation to the rising horizon, but well [configured] in relation to the Lot of Fortune and [10] its lord, the first [years] will be unproductive, but successful later on. If the opposite figure of the horoscope and the Lot of Fortune occurs, say the reverse for success or disappointment.Likewise, the lots signify the first age of life, but their lords the last. For Fortune signi-fies bodily passions9 and acquisitions, especially the 11th [15] place from it and its lord; but Daimon things to do with the soul, actions, reputations and character (τρόπος); and the lord of Basis is the foundation-stone of Fortune. And so in apportioning the years (ἔτος) of the birth, one must cast out the years (ἐνιαυτός), not only from the horoscope, but also from the Sun, the Moon and the Lot of Fortune. And if it involves father and mother, cast out the years from the Lot of the [20] Father and Mother, and examine the year for the parents in that way. Make sure that <the one> having more counts does not fall badly in any way in relation to the nativity, or be beheld by malefics—and this figure is actually base; (p. 42.1) for it will make a bad death for the nativity.With all these figures, also examine the outcomes from the bounds, the place dis-tinctions, the configurations of the stars, the faces of the decans along with their co-risings and the form of the dōdekaoros.10 Make sure also that [5] the lord of the twelfth place and the sixth from the horoscope do not happen to be on centrepins; for when they are administering the hour they harm youth, but when setting [they harm] old age. And also make sure that the Moon does not see the Lot of the Destroyer; this is a sign of violent death. The Lot of the Destroyer is taken from the House-master (οἰκοδεσπότης)11 of the Hour-marker to the Moon, and [10] an equal amount from the Hour-marker, but the reverse at night.7 Each planet has associated with it three amounts of years, small, medium and large, which are allotted based on conditions in the birthchart. See Appendix i.A, 2.2, ‘Planetary Periods’.8 Vettius Valens deals extensively with these techniques in Book IV of the Anthology.9 In the original sense of passions, i.e. what is experienced by the body.10 The dodekaoros is a system, originating in Egypt, of assigning animals to each day and night hour; cf.

The Horoskopos judges midway between these, being set as a foundation of the whole cosmos.And Fortune signifies all things about the body and actions throughout life. It becomes indicative of acquisition, reputation and privilege.[20] Daimon happens to be lord of soul, temper, sense and every power, and there are times when it cooperates in the reckoning about what one does.(p. 50) Eros signifies appetites and desires occurring by choice, and it becomes responsible for friendship and favor.Necessity signifies imprisonments, subordinations, battles and [5] wars, and it makes enmities, hatreds, condemnations and all the other constraining cir-cumstances which happen to men as their lot at birth.Courage becomes responsible for boldness, plotting, strength and every evil work.[10] Victory becomes responsible for faith, good expectation, contest and every kind of association, but it becomes as well responsible for penalty and reward [or, “and it becomes as well responsible for enterprise and success”].Nemesis becomes responsible for earthly daimons and all hidden things, of [their] exposure, impotence, exile, [15] loss, mourning and quality of death.The foundation, which is the Horoskopos, becomes responsible for life and breath, since along with the process of being born, everything which is born tears the life-giving [20] breath from the living air, in the turning-point of the water-clock’s hour which has been set at birth, which is the indicator of the whole.Olympiodorus, Commentary on Paulus, Chapter 21 (Boer, 42.6–43.4):Καὶ ἰστέον, ὅτι περὶ τούτων τῶν κλήρων γέγραπταιἙρμῇ τῷ Τρισμεγίστῳ ἐν βίβλῳ λεγομένῃ Παναρέτῳ, ἔνθακαὶ τὰ ἀποτελέσματα τούτων παραδίδωσι, δι’ ὧν καὶ μόνωνἂν δύναιτό τις ἀποτελεῖν ἐπὶ ἑκάστου πράγματος χωρὶς[10] ἑτέρου τινός.Οὗτος δὲ ὁ θεῖος ἀνὴρ ζ ἔλεγεν εἶναι κλήρους πρὸς τὸν ἀριθ-μὸν τῶν ζ ἀστέρων. ἔλεγε γὰρ τὸν κλῆρον τοῦ Ἡλίου Ἀγα-θὸν Δαίμονα, τὸν δὲ κλῆρον τῆς Σελήνης Ἀγαθὴν Τύχην, τὸνδὲ κλῆρον τοῦ Διὸς Νίκην, τὸν δὲ τοῦ Ἑρμοῦ Ἀνάγκην, τὸν δὲ[15] τῆς Ἀφροδίτης Ἔρωτα, τὸν δὲ τοῦ Ἄρεως Τόλμαν, τὸν δὲτοῦ Κρόνου Νέμεσιν. οὐ μάτην δὲ οὕτως ταῦτα ἐθέσπισεν·ἀλλ’ ἐπειδὴ οἵα τις τύχη τοῦ παντός ἐστιν ἡ Σελήνη,τούτου χάριν τὸν κλῆρον αὐτῆς Ἀγαθὴν Τύχην ἐκάλεσε·"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"appendix 8.d 457καὶ ἐπειδὴ ὁ Ἥλιος ἔφορός ἐστι τοῦ παντός, τούτου[20] χάριν τὸν κλῆρον αὐτοῦ Ἀγαθὸν Δαίμονα ἐκάλεσεν·ἐπειδὴ πάλιν ὁ Ζεὺς νίκης καὶ δόξης ἐστὶ κύριος, Νίκηνἐκάλεσε ὁ Τρισμέγιστος τὸν κλῆρον αὐτοῦ· ἀλλὰ μὴνἐπειδὴ καὶ ὁ Ἑρμῆς κύριός ἐστι λόγου, ὁ δὲ λόγος ἀναγ-(p. 43.) καστικὸς ὑπάρχει, τούτου χάριν Ἀνάγκην ἐκάλεσε τὸνκλῆρον αὐτοῦ· ὡσαύτως καὶ τῶν λοιπῶν τοὺς κλήρουςκατὰ τὴν ἰδιοτροπίαν τῶν ἀστέρων ἐκάλεσεν· καὶ ταῦταμὲν περὶ τούτου.And one must know that Hermes Trismegistus has written about these lots in the book called Panaretus, in which he hands down the outcomes of these, that through them alone it may be possible for someone to forecast for each matter separately from [10] some other one.This divine man said there were 7 lots in relation to the number of the 7 stars. For he said the lot of the Sun was the Good Daimon, the lot of the Moon Good Fortune, the lot of Zeus Victory, that of Hermes Necessity, that [15] of Aphrodite Eros, that of Ares Courage, that of Kronos Nemesis. He has not decreed these, in such a way, randomly. But since the Moon is some kind of fortune for everyone, for this [20] reason he called its lot Good Fortune. And since the Sun is overseer of all, for this reason he called its lot Good Daimon. Since, again Zeus is lord of victory and glory, Trismegistus called his lot Victory. Yet truly also since Hermes is lord of logos, and logos is (p. 43) actually necessary, for this reason he called his lot Necessity. In the same way also he called the lots of the rest of the stars according to their own distinctive quality, and so on.Commentary on Paulus, Chapter 22 (Boer, 46.8–47.10):καὶ πρῶτόν γε ἀρξόμεθα ἀπὸ τοῦκλήρου τῆς Τύχης, ἐπειδὴ μᾶλλον αὕτη ἡ θεὸς συγγενεσ-[10] τέρα τοῖς τῇδε πέφυκεν αὔξουσα καὶ μειοῦσα τὰ πράγματα,ὅθεν καὶ τῇ Σελήνῃ αὐτὴν ᾠκείωσεν ὁ θειότατος ἐκεῖνος,Ἑρμῆν φημι τὸν Τρισμέγιστον.Εἶτα μετὰ ταύτην τὸν τοῦ Ἀγαθοῦ Δαίμονος, ἐπειδὴἤθη ψυχῆς καὶ φρόνησιν καὶ προαίρεσιν ἐκ τούτου δυνάμεθα[15] γινώσκειν, ὥσπερ ἐκ τῆς Τύχης περὶ τοῦ σώματος καὶτῶν περὶ τὸ σῶμα. περὶ ταῦτα δὲ μάλιστα ἡ μεγίστη(p. 47.) μαντεία καταγίνεται τοῦ γνῶναι ἤθη ψυχῆς καὶ διαγωγὴνσώματος, ταὐτὸν δὲ εἰπεῖν, πῶς μὲν ψυχὴ πολιτεύεται κατὰτὸν τῇδε κόσμον, ἄνωθεν ἐλθοῦσα, πῶς δὲ τὸ σῶμα καὶ τὰ"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"appendix 8.d 458περὶ τὸ σῶμα, καὶ ἁπλῶς εἰπεῖν, πάντα τὰ οὐκ ἐφ’ ἡμῖν[5] ὑπαντήσει. τούτου χάριν πρὸ πάντων τῶν κλήρων τὸν τοῦΔαίμονος καὶ τῆς Τύχης κλῆρον ζητητέον. ἀλλὰ μὴν καὶἑτέραν αἰτίαν εἶπε, ὅτι διὰ τοῦτο τὸν τοῦ Δαίμονος καὶ τῆςΤύχης κλῆρον δεῖ προεκβάλλειν, ἐπειδὴ ἀπὸ τούτων καὶ τοὺςἄλλους πάντας ἐκβάλλομεν· οὐκ ἠδυνάμεθα οὖν τούτων μὴ[10] ἐκβληθέντων τοὺς λοιποὺς ἐκβάλλειν.And first indeed we will begin from the Lot of Fortune, since this goddess, much more kindred [10] to things here, has begotten increasing and lessening circum-stances, for which reason also that most divine one, I mean Hermes Trismegistus, affiliates her with the Moon.Then after this the [Lot] of the Good Daimon, since we can [15] get to know the character of the soul, intentional mind and purpose from this [lot], just as [we learn] the body and things concerning the body from Fortune. Especially concerning these things, the greatest power of (p. 47) divination abides with knowing the character of the soul and instruction about the body; that is to say, how a soul, having come from above, is here a citizen in the cosmos, and she will encounter the body and things concerning the body and, speaking generally, all the things which are not up to us.[5] For the sake of this, one must seek the Lot of Daimon and Fortune before all the [other] lots. Yet there is also another reason, that because of this one must first cast out the Lot of Daimon and Fortune, since from these we cast out all the others. And so we could not cast out the rest [10] without these being looked at.(Boer, 53.3–16):Ἐκ τούτων δὲ πάντων δηλοῦται ἡμῖν, ὅτι καθόλουὁ ἀριθμὸς ἢ ἀπὸ ἀστέρων ἐπὶ ἀστέρας γίνεται, ὥσπερ[5] ἐπὶ τοῦ Δαίμονος καὶ τῆς Τύχης εἴρηται—ἐκεῖ γὰρ ἀπὸἩλίου ἐπὶ Σελήνην καὶ ἀπὸ Σελήνης ἐπὶ Ἥλιον γίνεταιὁ ἀριθμός, ἀλλὰ μὴν καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ κλήρου τοῦ πατρὸςκαὶ τῆς μητρὸς καὶ τῶν λοιπῶν—ἢ ἀπὸ ἀστέρων ἐπὶκλήρους ἢ ἀπὸ κλήρων ἐπὶ ἀστέρας ὡς εἴρηται καὶ ἐπὶ[10] τοῦ κλήρου τοῦ Ἔρωτος καὶ τῆς Ἀνάγκης καὶ τῶνλοιπῶν ἐπὶ ἡμερινῆς γενέσεως καὶ νυκτερινῆς, ἐπὶ μὲνἜρωτος καὶ Νίκης ἐπὶ τῶν ἡμερινῶν γενέσεων ἀπὸκλήρου ἐπὶ ἀστέρας, ἐπὶ δὲ νυκτερινῶν τὸ ἀνάπαλιν·ἐπὶ δὲ Τόλμης, Ἀνάγκης, Νεμέσεως ἐπὶ μὲν τῶν ἡμερι-[15] νῶν γενέσεων ἀπὸ ἀστέρων ἐπὶ κλήρους, ἐπὶ δὲ νυκτερι-νῶν ἀπὸ κλήρων ἐπ’ ἀστέρας."},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"appendix 8.d 459From all these it is shown to us that on the whole, the number comes to be either from stars to stars, just as [5] it was said for Daimon and Fortune—for there the number comes to be from the Sun to the Moon and from the Moon to the Sun, yet also as well from the Lot of the Father and Mother and the rest—or from stars to lots or from lots to stars as it was said also for [10] the Lot of Eros and Necessity and the rest for a diurnal and nocturnal nativity.

If in preparing a diurnal geniture you have begun to seek the place of Fortune, investigate it by this reckoning: beginning from the degree of the Sun, the degrees of all the signs up to that sign in which the Moon is, with the degrees of the Moon themselves, apportion whatever sum all the degrees make, with the degrees of the horoscope added, to the rest of the signs, giving thirty degrees to each, towards the right of the horoscope; and in whatever sign the <last> degree of the whole num-ber has fallen, that place itself denotes for you the sign and substance of Fortune.17.4 (KSZ, I, 239.4–13; Monat, II, 174):4.

From this place [where the lot of Fortune is] is said to be shown the quality of life, the father’s estate, and the courses of both happiness and unhappiness. The quality of love, also, and the affections of husbands toward wives is learnt from this place. Sought from the substance of this particular place, as well, is the effect of nourishment and all desires. This place or the lateral squares of this place denotes, with easy reckoning, the fatherland. Moreover it is called, as Abraham defines it, the place of the Moon.6. See, therefore, who is the lord of the entire sign, and the lord of the particular degree, that is, in the bounds of what star that degree is and in what place are both the lord of the sign as well as of the degree, namely the degree in which the place of Fortune is found, and in what places of the geniture they have been set—whether in the foremost places, that is, the cardines; or in secondary places, or in cadent ones; or whether they are in their own heights [i.e. exaltations] or domiciles or falls. And also whether the lord of the sign itself, from the place it is in, regards its sign, that is, the place of Fortune, with suitable rays; and if both have been joined to each other in a cardine.IV, 17.7–8 (KSZ, I, 240.6–29; Monat, II, 175–76):7.

And when you have obtained all these by a careful reckoning, and the geniture is nocturnal, turn your attention back to the degrees of the Moon, but if a diurnal one [the degrees] of the Sun, and see who is the lord of the degrees, looking of course at the Sun by day and the Moon by night, and whether that one itself also regards the place of Fortune by a cardinal ray [i.e. from an angle]. But if one lord is found for all these degrees, and is well <placed> in the geniture and in those signs in which it rejoices, or those in which it is exalted or is lord, it decrees a happy geniture. But if this [planet] is placed <with> the Sun <or> Moon and regards the place of Fortune, more happiness is decreed from this multiple ray. But if these [degrees] which the Moon is ascribed, and the place of Fortune by sign (platice) is set, [are] in cardines, even more happiness/fortune is decreed by the multiple ray.8. But if there is not just one lord for the sign itself in which the place of Fortune is and for the degrees, neither those of the Sun nor the Moon, [then] the one which has the greatest power obtains first place in decreeing; and if it is a benefic and is found in benefic signs or is placed in its own height [i.e. exaltation] or house and, located in the principal cardines of the geniture [the first and tenth?], sees the place of Fortune cardinally, it decrees a great and noble geniture.IV 17.9–10 (KSZ, I, 240.29–241.22; Monat, II, 176–77):9. Sed haec tum facit, si partiliter in cardinibus fuerit constitutus.

But it then does these things only if it is set in the cardines by degree. For if it is just found generally [i.e. platically] in these places about which we have spoken, it decrees a middling geniture, that he will not be happy beyond measure nor weighed down by extreme poverty. But if both fall well—the lord of the sign itself in which the place of Fortune is, and the lord of that degree in which the final portion is found, and set in good signs, that is, in which they rejoice or are exalted, or in their own houses, and placed by degree in cardines, it decrees such happiness that one who has been thus born is joined to emperors in every way. But if not in cardinal signs by degree, but are found [only] by sign, they decree increases of a moderate happiness.10. But if the lord of the sign itself in which the place of Fortune is found, and the lord of the degree itself (that is, the lord of the bounds), and the lord of the degrees in which the Moon is found in the same geniture are well placed, either in [signs] where they are exalted or in their own houses, and they hold the principal places of the geniture or are set in those places in which they rejoice, they will produce emperors whose empire spreads throughout the whole world and whose power is such that they approach the divine sway of the gods.IV 17.11–12 (KSZ, I, 241.22–242.5; Monat, II, 177);11.

But for those three which we spoke of before, if they are badly placed, and the MC and post-ascension of the Hour-marker are left free from the protection of all the benefic stars, this geniture will be unfortunate, unhappy and weighed down by an ever-continuing succession of evils. So inquire carefully about the twelfth-part of Fortune, so that the aim of the effects [of the chart] does not escape your notice. Book IV 18.1 (KSZ, I, 242.6–21; Monat, II, 178):XVIII. De loco daemonisLocum daemonis ista ratione colligimus; quam ideo huic libro indidimus, quia Solis eum locum esse Abraham simili ratione monstravit et inicum erat, ut a loco Lunae Solis separaretur locus. Qui locus hac ratione colligitur: [ut] in diurna genitura a parte Solis usque ad partem Lunae omnium signorum colligis partes et totam hanc summam ab horoscopo incipiens per sequentia signa distribuis, et in quocumque signo ultima pars ceciderit, ipsa tibi pars daemonem monstrat.

On the place of the DaemonWe obtain the place of the daemon by this reckoning; we have introduced it [the place]6 in this book, because Abraham showed it to be the place of the Sun by a similar reckoning and it was unsuitable that the place of the Sun be separated from the place of the Moon. The place is obtained by this reckoning: in a diurnal geniture you col-lect the degrees of all the signs from the degree of the Sun to the degree of the Moon, and beginning from the Horoscope you distribute this entire sum through the fol-lowing signs, and in whatever sign the final degree falls, that degree itself shows you the Daemon. In a nocturnal [geniture] you collect the degrees of all the signs from the Moon to the Sun and beginning from the Horoscope, by like reckoning you apportion that entire sum to all the signs, and in whatever sign <the last degree falls, that> degree itself shows you the Daemon of the geniture.6 Reading ‘quem’, in all the manuscripts, for ‘quam’ in the Aldine edition.

He proceeds to describe these, stat-ing both the injuries and illnesses for each sign. After this, he explains how to use this system with the lots:]Book II, 37.20–25 (Pingree, 105.35–106.15):[35] Τούτων οὕτως ἐχόντων σκοπεῖν δεήσει ἀκριβῶς ἐπὶ πάσης γενέσεως(p. 106) τὸν κλῆρον τῆς τύχης, εἰς ποῖον ζῴδιον ἐξέπεσεν (καὶ ἡ τοῦ ζῳδίου φύσιςσημαίνει τὸ σίνος), μάλιστα δὲ ὁ τοῦ κλήρου τῆς τύχης κύριος ἐν ὁποίῳἂν ᾖ ζῳδίῳ. ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ τὸν δαίμονα καὶ τὸν τούτου κύριον σκοπεῖν,εἰς ποῖα ζῴδια ἐξέπεσεν (καὶ οὗτοι τὰ πάθη δηλώσουσιν) · καὶ <οἱ> εἰς[5] τὸν περὶ πράξεως τόπον ὡσαύτως σοι νοηθήσονται. ἐνεργέστερα μὲν οὖντὰ σίνη καὶ τὰ πάθη γενήσεται, ἐπὰν κακοποιοὶ ἐπῶσιν ἢ μαρτυρῶσιτοῖς τόποις ἢ τοῖς οἰκοδεσπόταις· γίνονται δὲ ἀσινεῖς ἢ ἀπαθεῖς ὅταν κα-λῶς οἱ τόποι καὶ οἱ κύριοι ἀκάκωτοι τύχωσιν. ἕκαστος μὲν οὖν ἀστὴρ τὸἴδιον ἀποτέλεσμα ποιεῖ ἐξ ἧς ἔλαχε φύσεως. ἐὰν γὰρ ὑποθέσεως χάριν[10] ὁ κλῆρος εἰς Κριὸν ἐμπέσῃ καὶ ὁ τούτου κύριος Ἄρης ἐπῇ, <ἐπεὶ> καὶ τοῦΚριοῦ καὶ τοῦ Σκορπίου ἐκυρίευσεν, προλέγειν σίνος περὶ κεφαλὴν ἢμόριον ἢ ἕδραν. οἷον εἴωθε κατὰ τὴν ἰδίαν φύσιν ὁ ἀστὴρ ἀποτελεῖν ἀπο-τελέσει· ἔσθ’ ὅτε γάρ, ἀμφοτέρων τῶν τόπων κακωθέντων, τὰ σίνη καὶτὰ πάθη γίνονται, καὶ μάλιστα ὅταν κακοποιοὶ κυριεύσωσιν ἢ ἐπιμαρτυ-[15] ρήσωσιν.Such being the case, it will be necessary to examine the Lot of Fortune accurately for every nativity, in what zodiac sign it fell out (and the nature of the sign signifies the injury), and especially the lord of the Lot of Fortune in whatever zodiac sign it is. And likewise examine the [Lot of ] Daimon and its lord, in what zodiac sign it fell out (and these show the illnesses). And you will discern them likewise from the place concerning action [i.e. the tenth]. So the injuries and illnesses will come to be more activated when-ever malefics are on or witnessing the places or their house-masters; but the [natives] come to be uninjured or free of illness when the places and their lords happen to be well-[placed] and free of malefics. And so each star produces its own particular outcome from the nature it had as its portion. For instance, if the lot falls in Aries and its lord, Ares, is there, <since> it has authority over Aries and Scorpio, it foretells injury to the head or [private] parts or fundament. The star will bring about whatever it is accustomed to bring about according to its own nature; but sometimes, when both places have been afflicted, [both] injuries and illnesses occur, especially when malefics are the lords or testify."},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���6 | doi ��.��63/9789004306��9_0�8Appendix 9.C: Planetary Years for Time Lords in Vettius Valens (Minor Years of the Planets)Sign of LotPlanetYearsMonthsAriesMars1515 (1y3m)TaurusVenus88GeminiMercury2020 (1y8m)CancerMoon2525 (2y1m)LeoSun1919 (1y7m)VirgoMercury2020 (1y8m)LibraVenus88ScorpioMars1515 (1y3m)SagittariusJupiter1212 (1y)CapricornSaturn2727 (2y3m)AquariusSaturn3030 (2y6m)PiscesJupiter1212 (1y)The domicile lord of the lot begins the aphesis.

And so Aphrodite distributes 3 years 12 days, according to her bounds; next [5] the degree of the Hour-marker contacts the Lot of Bravery and Courage, yet 46 minutes remain to Aphrodite from her bounds, which due to ascensions come to be 32 minutes and 12 seconds. And due to this we say that Aphrodite manages the Lot of [10] Bravery and Courage in her own distribution for 6 months 13 days. Altogether there are about 3 years, six months [and] twenty-five days.Next the circumambulation comes to the bounds of Hermes, and we take this one as the distributor; and he manages the Lot of Bravery and Courage for about 1 year and 8 days. [15] <But> the circumambulation takes hold of the hexagonal ray of Kronos after about 4 years, 7 months and 3 days, and due to his hexagonal ray, Kronos gov-erns the Lot of Bravery and Courage for about one year 10 months [and] 17 days in the distribution of Hermes. And then [20] the Lot of Advancement and Victory meets up with [it] after about 6 years, 6 months and 22 days, and due to his hexagonal ray Kronos governs the two lots, both the Lot of Bravery and Courage, and the Lot of Advancement and Victory, and with the distribution of [25] Hermes, for about 5 months [and] 29 days, altogether coming to about 7 years [and] 21 days. Next the Moon bodily takes over the governance from the hexagonal ray of Kronos, and administers the 2 lots with her own body and with the distribution (p. 131) of Hermes for 11 months, 16 days; and the distribution of Hermes is completed after about 7 years, 11 months, 27 days.Next the distribution changes over to Zeus, and [5] together with the Moon he administers the Lots of Bravery and Courage, and Advancement and Victory for 4 months [and] 24 days; and the circumambulation comes to the Lot of Intellect and Native Wit after about 8 years, 4 months [and] 21 days. Next, [10] through the distribu-tion of Zeus, the Moon governs bodily the Lot of Intellect and Native Wit, and the first two lots which we mentioned—I mean the Lot of Bravery and Courage and the Lot of Advancement and Victory—for one year, 6 months [and] 8 days."},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"BibliographyNote: Works of unclear or legendary authorship (e.g. ‘Hermetica’ and ‘Picatrix’) are usually listed alphabetically by title, except in cases where the editor’s name is widely known in association with the work (e.g. Diels and Kranz for Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker).
