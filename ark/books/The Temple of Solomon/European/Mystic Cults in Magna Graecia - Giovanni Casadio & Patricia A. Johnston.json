Historical andCritical PerspectivesIn introducing the papers collected inthis volume, one must inevitablyconsider the degree to which thesecults, particularly the so-calledmystery cults, often referred to as“mysteries,” can properly be viewed asreligiohistorical phenomena. We mustalso recognize the existence of acertain tension between the evidencepertaining to these cults as practiced atthe “local” level, and their practice inthe more “central” metropolises (suchas mainland Greece, especially Attica,"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Anatolia, and Egypt), for example, bytaking into consideration the linksbetween the cults and the geographicaland ecological realities.Mysteries and the Orient areinherently intriguing. They havealways held a remarkable appeal evenfor the most traditional students of theancient world. Before World War II,two interpretive approaches dominatedthe arena. One was historical,propagated by Richard Reitzenstein(1861-1931),3 who envisaged anIranian origin of all the saving gods,including the Judaeo-Christianmessiah, and Franz Cumont (1868-1947),4 who interpreted Mithraism asthe mystical offspring of Persian"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"religion. The alternative model wasphenomenological, based on the patternof the “dying-and-rising gods” (godsprevalently of oriental origins),formulated by James G. Frazer (1854-1941) and developed by British andScandinavian adepts of the Myth-and-Ritual School. “‘Mystery’ was taken tobe the essence of oriental religiosity.”5In spite of its painstaking erudition,broad comparative perspective(including Christians and Australianaborigines), and characteristicawareness of historical dynamisms,even the groundbreaking work ofRaffaele Pettazzoni (1883-1959) paidhomage to these clichés. Now,however, Pettazzoni’s historical"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"reconstructions are seriously impairedby progress in philological research.6As in other domains of the history ofancient religions, Arthur Darby Nock(1902-63) was perhaps the mostbrilliant and constructive actor inreassessing the evidence and theoriesabout the mysteries. A useful synthesisof the work done in the period afterCumont is provided by Vermaseren(1981) in a collection of monographson the individual cults by eminentspecialists, completed by CarstenColpe’s invaluable introduction.More recently, Ugo Bianchi (1922-95) gave a tremendous impetus to theresearch on mystery cults (and relatedphenomena) in ancient Mediterranean"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"cultures and the Roman Empire. Hisprimary merit was that of gatheringspecialists of various disciplines(philologists, archaeologists,epigraphists, orientalists, historians ofreligions) who were not previouslyaccustomed to converse together, andof convincing them—despite a certainreluctance—to share their data andinterpretations on a common terrain.Four scholars who participated inBianchi’s historic conference onMithraism in Rome in 1978, and alsoin his conference on the soteriology oforiental cults in the Roman Empire in1979 — Beck, Gordon, SfameniGasparro, and Casadio—alsoparticipated in the Cumae 2002"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"symposium, and thus were in a positionto reflect on changes and/or persistencein the focus of the research. One ofthese witnesses aptly recalls:The most useful recent typology of Greco-Roman mysteries as forms of personal religiouschoice is that of Bianchi and others. Threemodes are distinguished: “mystery” proper, anentire initiatory structure of some duration andcomplexity, of which the type (and in manycases the actual model ...) is Eleusis; “mystic”cult, involving not initiation but rather a relationof intense communion, typically ecstatic orenthusiastic, with the divinity (e.g., Bacchicfrenzy, or the kybeboi of Cybele); and“mysteriosophic” cult, offering ananthropology, an eschatology, and a practicalmeans of individual reunion with divinity—theprimitive and original form is Orphism, ...Hermeticism and Gnosis, though these are lateEgyptian and Judaeo-Christian forms of"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"religiosity. Bianchi himself has sought toprovide an element of thematic unity byadapting Frazer’s “dying-rising god” typology:these cults are all focused upon a “god subjectto some vicissitude.” This tack has rightly beencriticized, but the scheme has heuristic valuewithout it.7It is perhaps helpful to report Bianchi’sdefinitions in his own terms, becausethere every single word is the result ofa long-lasting, careful analysis ofhistorical data. For the term mystic heunderstandsthe concept and the experience of a livelyparticipated interference between the divine, thecosmic and the human realms, and this both inthe sense of a participation of some divinities tovicissitudes and fates, “human” in character(disappearance and return, death and life, etc.),and in the sense of a participation of human"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"beings in a destiny and a vicissitude relating tothe “divine” (attainment or restoration of divineor celestial conditions of immortality, happinessand totality).

The ancienthuman problems of suffering, death,and guilt undoubtedly played animportant part in the efficacy of themysteries.

Heraclituscriticizes the initiates and bacchi andthe μάγοι and νυκτιπόλοι who performrites.33 In Orphic environments, themagoi are mentioned in the DerveniPapyrus34 in connection with anἐπῳδή.

Therefore, itis advisable to keep in mind this mythwhen we try to discover the use of thethyrsus among the Orphics. Clement ofAlexandria mentions the thyrsi withwhich the bacchi—in this case, theworshipers who celebrate the mysteriesof Sabazios—are crowned, and apassage from the Platonic Phaedo43passes on a well-known Orphic line:ναρθηκοφόροι μὲν πολλοὶ, βάκχοι δέ"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"τε παῦροι.Many bear the thyrsus, few are thebacchi.According to the context in whichwe find the sentence, it is very likelythat the expression was uttered (φασιν)by those who took part in the ritual (οἱπερὶ τὰς τελετάς). This would probablyhappen during the execution of a rite inwhich thyrsi were borne44 and thetragic fate of Dionysus might beplayed. This hypothesis seems to beendorsed in a few lines by Proclusaccording to which those who celebrateDionysus bear the thyrsus.45 As wesaid above, the Orphic myth of the"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"dismemberment could give a context tothe origin of the expression passed onby Plato.

Onthe other hand, the bacchi could be theones who have been able to freethemselves from that guilt.

In the same way, theTitanic heritage is carried by the wholeof humanity, which includes not onlythe profane, but also the initiates whotry to free themselves from it in thislife.

But the situation canbe exactly the opposite.The third benefit that the soul of themystēs achieves in the underworld ishappiness (ὄλβος),57 a complexconcept, which we do not know how todefine, whether as a “materialwellness” or as a deeper feeling arisingfrom the company of the gods.

A decade after Vermaseren’smonograph, however, the classicalarchaeologist P.

Minto, who had discussedthe frescoes with Cumont in somedetail (Cumont 1924), thought that thereading order proceeded up the right-hand podium starting nearest to theeastern wall (here RI → RVI) andcontinued back down the left(southern) podium (LVII → LI).11What sense such an order might have"},{"pageNumber":1195,"pageContent":"made, Minto does not say; but heevidently believed that the sequencerepresented the initiations for all seveninitiatory grades, acting as a sort ofanticipatory program: “I fedeli,contemplando queste scene liturgiche,dovevano provare la suggestione ditutta la loro vita religiosa, attraverso idiversi gradi di iniziazione” (Minto1924: 373).

L4.The Body, Suffering, and IdentityGiven that they are so clearly focusedon the suffering body of the initiand, itseems plausible to look in the firstplace to Michel Foucault to help uscontextualize the Capuan images. TheFoucauldian body is a sociallyappropriate body, the product ofhistorically specific discourses and"},{"pageNumber":1223,"pageContent":"practices, an “anatomical body overlaidby culture.”31 Initially, in his work onsocial discipline (1975), Foucault’sperspective emphasized solely therelation between the materiality of thebody and its discursive regulation intheory and practice. On his account,concentrated on the nineteenth centurybut with ample reference back toearlier monastic, military, and penalpractice, the body is molded, trained,and pressed by a variety of techniquesinto becoming a socially usefulinstrument (1975: 30-31). “Thephenomenon of the social body is theeffect not of a consensus but of themateriality of power operating on thevery bodies of individuals.”32 By way"},{"pageNumber":1224,"pageContent":"of the notion of “bio-power,” thesubject was not only redescribed inmaterialist terms but also shown to behistorically contingent. With thepublication of the three volumes ofL’histoire de la sexualité (1976-84),however, Foucault’s social bodybecame primarily a gendered body, asexually differentiated body.33 Leavingthis to one side for the moment, I wantfirst to explore aspects of the Mithraicbody with reference to Foucault’searlier distinction between a type ofsocial order based upon “le modèlereprésentatif, scénique, signifiant,public, collectif” and one based on “lemodèle coercitif, corporel, solitaire,secret, du pouvoir de punir” (Foucault"},{"pageNumber":1225,"pageContent":"1975: 134).Foucault’s aim in Surveiller et punirwas to write a genealogy of the modern“scientific-judicial complex,” whichturns individuals into objects of aparticular form of discursiveknowledge. For heuristic purposes, hecontrasted this complex with an early-modern world in which high rates ofmortality and the absence of anindustrial regime produced a“worthless” body, which was at thesame time of the greatest symbolicinterest. The socio-political value ofthis pre-industrial body lay in itsability concretely to manifest the dis-symmetry between the power of thestate and that of the individual (1975:"},{"pageNumber":1226,"pageContent":"59). So far from concealing itsrepressive work, Power gloried in itsright to inscribe itself in the mostgruesome fashion upon the body.Conversely, an audience wasindispensable. For— in a sense — it isthe spectator, not the culprit, who is theprimary actor in exemplarypunishment. Without spectators, thespectacle lacks all moral sense. In thespecific cases of corporal and capitalpunishment, there are three criteria ofsuccessful ritualization: the quantum ofsuffering must be appropriate to thecrime; the suffering must be signalledto the audience in such a fashion that itbe never forgotten; and the “excess” ofviolence must be intelligible as the"},{"pageNumber":1227,"pageContent":"writing of power (1975: 37-39). Theeffect of such punishment was toexpose the crime, itself unspoken orhidden, by means of rituals ofhumiliation and suffering. Among therituals are the nicely regulatedprocedures of torture, which, likeKafka’s “eigentümlicher Apparat” in Inder Strafkolonie (1914),simultaneously punished as theyrevealed the truth (1975: 46). The“corps montré, promené, exposé,supplicié” is not intended to re-establish a moral equilibrium butdestined symbolically to affirm thesuperiority of constituted authority.“Le supplice ne rétablissait pas lajustice; il réactivait le pouvoir” (1975:"},{"pageNumber":1228,"pageContent":"53).Distantly in the wake of Foucault(and Norbert Elias), ancient historianshave explored the symbolic functionsof violent spectacle in antiquity, bothin the “théâtre de terreur”34 and in thehistory of gladiatorial combat.35Among these, Kathleen Colemanespecially has shown how strikinglythe Roman principate confirmsFoucault’s account of the symbolicvalue of the body in pre-industrial staterepression.36 Indeed, the explicitness,inventiveness, memorability, andexpense of Roman ceremonies ofdegradation, the apparently unlimitedability of the judicial system toproduce “worthless bodies” (in Latin:"},{"pageNumber":1229,"pageContent":"vilis sanguis), the centrality of thespectators’ consent and desire (Occide!Verbera! Ure!: “Kill him, thrash him,burn him!” Seneca Ep. mor. 7.5), andthe enthusiastic occlusion of justice forthe sake of reinvigorating Power—allthese serve to make the Principate theexample Foucault must have wished hehad thought of.Placed in this context, the Mithraicinitiation rituals depicted in the CapuaMithraeum are extremely suggestive.Although they of course have noconnection with the apparatus of statepower, their images of subjection,degradation, and suffering imply animaginaire based on the same premisesas the théâtre de terreur, namely, the"},{"pageNumber":1230,"pageContent":"exemplary production of vilis sanguis,the ingenious multiplication of formsof humiliation, the use of physicalsuffering to underwrite the triumph ofPower, and a heightened interest in thereactions of the implied spectator.

Statues of Isis have beenfound in association with Mithraicicons.8 Her consort Sarapis was oftenequated with Mithras, Jupiter, orSaturn/Kronos on Mithraicmonuments.9 Some Mithraic statuesalso hold the Egyptian ankh.

As willbe seen, the Seth-Osiris conflict resultsin a bull’s foreleg being placed at thenorth pole of the cosmic sphere.
