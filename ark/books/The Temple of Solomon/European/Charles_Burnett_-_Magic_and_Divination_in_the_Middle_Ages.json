More theoretical discussions, such as the nature of medieval magic, the role of magic and divination in society, and the arguments for and against magical and divinatory practices, are not broached. Astrology is not properly divina-tion, and is such a wide field in itself that it has not been included in this volume, except incidentally. The first nine articles are on magic. I describes the terminology of talis~ manic magic (or necromancy) in the Middle Ages. II introduces a Latin division of science of unknown date and authorship which gives pro-minence to the magical sciences, including the two divisions of the science of talismans. III and IV trace the history of talismanic texts from the Classical period through the Arabic world to the Latin Middle Ages. IV shows how an interest in acquiring the 'secret knowledge• of magic and divination was a catalyst for the translating activity from Arabic into Latin in twelfth-century Spain. V deals with the legend of the trans~ mission of this secret science through a succession of three Hermes, and VI-VIII treat different aspects of one of the earliest and most important Arabic Hermetic texts: the kitab al-lsfamafis. Finally IX shows how magical texts translated fn the twelfth and thirteenth centuries were still being copied and used in the early sixteenth century. The next section deals with different forms of divination current in the Middle Ages-X with chiromancy, XI with onomancy, XII-XVI with scapulimancy, XVII-XVIII with geomancy and fortune-telling. Two articles on more miscellaneous topics conclude the volume: XIX tells one when to consult an alchemist, or (if you are the alchemist yourself) when to commence the Work, and, finally, XX deals with an apocryphal letter foretelling the advance of the Mongols. Articles III, VII, VIII, X, XI, XV, XVII, XVIII, XIX and XX include editions, and XI, XIII and XVII include catalogues of texts on the subjects concerned, and the manuscripts in which these texts are found."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"x Previously unpublished editions (with English translations) have been added to X, and a revised English translation of an Arabic text is given in XII. Two articles have not been published before (I and IX), and one (VII) is republished in English in a considerably revised form. These articles could not have been written without the resources of the Warburg Institute, and the inspiration of A. A. Barb, D. P. Walker and Frances Yates, and of many scholars who have passed through its portals. The importance of looking at the Arabic background to Medieval Euro-pean culture was first brought home to me by Peter Dronke and the late Marie-Therese d' Alverny, who set me on the tracks of Hermann of Carinthia and Adelard of Bath. Several of these articles were written as by-products of my investigation into the Latin works attributed to Ya 'qub b. Isftaq al-Kindi, which I started when I was a guest of the CNRS equipe 'Histoire des sciences et de la philosophie arabes' directed by Jean Jolivet in Paris in 1975. David Pingree has helped me in many ways, and is a living proof that prolonged exposure to magic does not corrupt one's mind and personality. Alfons Barb once wrote that 'a humanist must never close his eyes to the all-too-human. There are few human activities in the history of which an unbroken chain of tradition from the remotest antiquity to our days can be traced more clearly and conclusively than in the Magic Arts' ( 'The Survival of Magic Arts' in Paganism and Christianity in the Fourth Century, ed. A. D. Momigliano, Oxford, 1963, p. 125). One may add that there are few genres of literature in which one obtains such intimate glimpses into the everyday life and concerns of human beings as in magic and divination.

Necromancy among the Seven Liberal Artsi In the Middle Ages, as everyone knows, Philosophy was divided into the Seven Liberal Arts-Grammar, Rhetoric, Dialectic, Arithmetic, Music, Geometry and Astronomy. They are sculpted on the Portail Royal of Chartres Cathedral and provide the framework of Thierry of Chartres' magnificent collection of all that was needed for becoming a philosopher in the mid-twelfth century: the Heptateuchon. 2 Surely, at least until the Aristotelian scheme was established in the thirteenth century, there could be no argument about the contents of philosophy? And yet there was. Petrus Alfonsi, a Jewish convert to Christianity, who was active translating Arabic scientific texts and promoting the study of astronomy in the first decades of the twelfth century, considered rather that the first six arts are dialectic, arithmetic, geometry, medicine, music, and astronomy, but, as for the seventh: those who admit the possibility of prophecies say that it is necromancy; those who do not, say it is philosophy ... and those who do not study philosophy say that it is grammar .3 This quotation is from the highly respectable and popular work 'on the education of clerks' (Disciplina clericalis) which is a collection of edifying stories and recommendations for polite conduct. We come across necromancy again later in the century, in a work devoted specifically to the description of the parts of knowledge: Dominicus 1 This paper was originally presented as a talk and the viva voce tone has been preserved here. Hence annotation has been kept to a minimum and no attempt has been made to be exhaustive in the treatment of the subject of necromancy. For further, and largely complementary information, I recommend the fine overview of 'necromancy' provided in chapter 7 of Richard Kieckhefer's Magic in rhe Middle Ages, Cambridge, 1989, pp. 151-75. 2 For the context of Thierry's Hepcareuchon, see E. Jeauneau, \"Lecrio philoso-phorum \", Amsterdam, 1973. 3 Disciplina clericalis I: Laceinischer Text, eds Alfons Hilka and Werner Soderhjelm, Acta societatis scientiarum Fennicae, 38.4, Helsinki, 1911, p. 10: 'Hae sunt artes: dialectica, arithmetica, geometria, phisica, musica, astronomia. De septima vero diversae plurimorum sunt sententiae quaenam sit: philosophi qui prophetias sectantur, aiunt nigromantiam esse septimam. Aliqui ex illis videlicet qui prophe-tiis non credunt, philosophiam volunt esse septimam ... Quidam qui philosophiae non student, grammaticam esse affirmant'. Petrus refers further to the art of prophecy, in citing from 'Plato in libro de prophetiis' a story concerning a wise-man who can prophecy into the future, called Marianus, who is inspired by a 'pro-phetico spiritu' (ibid., pp. 34-5)."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"2 TALISMANS: MAGIC AS SCIENCE Gundissalinus 's De divisione philosophiae. This work was a harbinger of the new Aristotelian arrangement of science, and was often attached to the Aristotelian corpus in the university manuscripts of the thirteenth century. Under the general category ('scientia universalis') of 'natural science' Gundissalinus includes eight divisions: medicine, (astrological) judgements, nigromancy according to physics ('nigromancia secundum physicam'), talismans, agriculture, navigation, optics and alchemy.4 This division, Gundissalinus took from an earlier account of the natural development of human knowledge, an anonymous translation of an anonymous Arabic text called 'On the rise of the sciences' (De ortu scientiarum ). 5 Going back a hundred years, one finds that the pioneering translator of Arabic medical texts into Latin, Constantine the African, is said to have been educated in 'grammar, dialectic, rhetoric, geometry, arithmetic, mathematics ( !), astronomy, necroman·cy, music, and physics. '6 It seems strange that in such respectable sources 'the conjuring up of the dead in order to prophecy'(which is the literal meaning of 'necromancy') should be so well-integrated into the parts of philosophy. But what is really meant by 'necromancy' and how did it relate to other sciences? The term was already used in Late Antiquity, by Augustine in De Civitate Dei and Jerome in his commentary on Ezechiel, and received its correct etymology from Isidore of Seville who, in his Etymologiae defined 'necromancers' as 'those by whose incantations the dead, having been resuscitated, seem to divine the future and reply to questions put to them. 4 Dominicus Gundissalinus, De divisione philosophiae, ed. L. Baur, Beitriige zur Geschichte der Philosophie des Mittelalters, Mtinster-in-W., IV.2-3, Mtinster 1903, p. 20: 'scientianaturalis universalis est quia octo sciencie sub ea continentur: scilicet sciencia de medicina, sciencia de iudiciis (corrected from Baur's 'indiciis'), sciencia de nigromantia secundum physicam, sciencia de ymaginibus, sciencia de agricultura, sciencia de navigacione, sciencia de speculis, sciencia de alquimia, que est sciencia de conversione rerum in alias species, et hec octo sunt species naturalis sciencie'. 5 De ortu scientiarum, ed. C. Baeumker, Beitriige zur Geschichte der Philosophie des Mittelalters, 19, Mtinster, 1918, p. 20: 'Partes autem huius scientiae [sc. naturalis] secundum quod dixerunt sapientes primi octo sunt, scilicet scientia de iudiciis, scientia de medicina, scientia de nigromantia secundum physicam, scientia de imaginibus, scientia de agricultura, scientia de navigando, scientia de alkimia quae est scientia de conversione rerum in alias species, scientia de speculis'. 6 H. Bloch, Monte Cassino in the Middle Ages, Rome and Cambridge, Ma., 1986, 3 vols, I, p. 127: 'Babiloniam petiit, in qua grammatica, dialectica, rethorica, geometrica, arithmetica, mathematica, astronomia, necromantia, musica, phisicaque Chaldeorum, Arabum, Persarum, Saracenorum plenissime eruditus est' (from Petrus Diaconus, De viris illustribus). In the version of this text which appears in the Chronica Monasterii Casinensis (quoted ibid.) the word 'necro-mancy' appears to have been corrupted, or deliberately changed, into 'nee non'."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"TALISMANS: MAGIC AS SCIENCE 3 For 'nekros' in Greek is 'dead', 'manteia' is 'divination\".7 In the Middle Ages, however, this strict sense of 'necromantia' was often lost sight of; the word became corrupted into 'nigromantia', and was used to translate the common Arabic word for 'magic'-'sil)r'.s For the understanding of the term in the Middle Ages we can do no better than to tum to the most authoritative book on the divisions of magic and astrology in the Middle Ages-Albertus Magnus's Speculum astronomiae of the mid-13th century-the aim of which was to sort out which books in this area were licit and which illicit.9 Albertus understands 'necromancy' to apply to certain kinds of magic using imagines or 'talismans'. He adds that other forms of divination or magic are 'coterminous' with necromancy, such as geomancy, hydromancy, aerimancy, pyromancy and chiromancy, but it is on the talismanic art that he concentrates. He distinguishes three varieties of magic, of which the first two are 'necromantic'. The first is abominable. This employs suffumigations and invocations. The demons, however, are not compelled by these ritual bindings, but God permits them to deceive the magicians. The second is less reprehensible, but still detestable. It employs characters, names and exorcisms and is to be avoided because beneath the cover of names in foreign languages may lurk what is contrary to the Catholic faith. The third type, which does not allow suffumigations, nor admit exorcisms and characters, relies on power 1 Isidore, Etymologiae, ed. W. M. Lindsay, Oxford, 1911, VII, 9, 11: 'Necromantii sunt, quorum precantationibus videntur resuscitati mortui divinare, et ad interro-gata respondere. NeKpoc; enim Graece mortuus, μaVTeia.divinatio nuncu-patur'. Augustine and Jerome are the only other ancient authorities for the term given in the CD-ROM Cetedoc Library of Christian Latin Texts, q.v. For the context of this form of divination, which is based on the belief that the spirits of the dead hovered in the atmosphere, see especially Theodor Hopfner, Griechisch-Agyptischer Offenbarunszauber: seine Methoden, 2nd edition, Amsterdam, 1983. 8 For a confused etymology see Thaddeus of Parma, Super theorica planetarum Gerardi, cited in G. Federici Vescovini, 'La Classification des mathematiques d' apres le prologue de l' Expositio super Theorica Planetarum de l' Averro1ste Thaddee de Parme (Bologne, 1318)', in Manuels, programmes de cours et techniques d'enseignement dans les universites medievales, ed. J. Hamesse, Louvain-la-Neuve, 1994, pp. 138-82 (177): 'Nigromantia dicitur a nigron, quod sit mors et fit de favillis mortuorum, vel quia mors et perditio anime est studere in ipsa, vel quia homines in ipsa studentes et per ipsam volentes operari debent habere passiones mortificatas'. For 'nigromantia' being equivalent to 'sitJr' see Hugo of Santalla's translation of the Liber Aristotilis (ed. Burnett and D. Pingree, in press) IV, 23, 3 and Picatrix, ed. Pingree, London, 1986, passim. Kieckhefer, Magic in the Middle Ages (n. l above), p. 152, suggests that the conjuring of demons came to be known as necromancy because, since in the Middle Ages it was assumed that the dead could not be brought to life, 'demons took on the appearance of deceased persons and pretended to be those persons'. 9 I use the edition and translation of Paola Zambelli, The Speculum Astronomiae and its Enigma, Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, 135, Dordrecht, 1992, together with the earlier edition by S. Caroli, M. Pereira, S. Zamponi and P. Zambelli, Pisa, 1977, which includes a full apparatus."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"4 TALISMANS: MAGIC AS SCIENCE drawn from the celestial spheres. The element which distinguishes the necromantic types from the non-necromantic, would seem, therefore, to be the presense of exorcisms, or the summoning of spirits, in the former. A parallel division of necromantic and non-necromantic magic is found in the twelfth-century division of the sciences known from its incipit as 'Ut testatur Ergaphalau'. Having divided the science of the macrocosm into 'astronomy' and 'astrology' (though, typically, using the terms in the opposite sense to how we use them now), the unknown writer describes 'astronomia' (i.e., astrology) as follows: Astrology is the science which, by running through the movements of the signs of the zodiac, of the planets and the celestial circles with the help of instruments, indicates the changes of lower substances in an absolute way. One kind is called primary and has to do with signification, the other, 'changing' ... The changing kind is called that of images, 10 which by using a form (or imageJorma), following the movement of the superior bodies, either preserves lower things in good fortune! 1 or, by producing a misfortune, brings harm to them. It has twelve species. One is called 'of the questioner', which, conceiving the form (image) of what is to be changed in a talisman (imago), brings about a change in the questioner according to his wish. Another is called 'of possessing', which teaches how to make a talisman for increasing or harming someone's possessions. And so on, according to the twelve astrological places.12 The science of talismans, the anonymous author continues, is also divided into 'pure' and 'exorcising'. Here we find Albertus's division. The pure is what teaches talismans to be struck without incantations and exorcisms, but only by inspecting the state of the higher bodies. 'Exorcising' is what teaches how to include spirits as collaborators in making the talismans, by using exorcisms and incantations. Petrus Alfonsi, in another popular work of his-the Dialogue between his old Jewish self, Moyses, and his new Christian self, Petrus-also divides necromancy into species: First you should know that the art which is called 'nigromancia' has nine parts. Of these the first four deal with the four elements <showing> how we can operate with them physically, 13 but the five remaining ones 10 The author uses adjectives formed from, respectively, the Latin and Greek words for 'image'-'imaginaria sive idealis'; the term 'imago', as we have seen, is the standard Latin word for 'talisman', and will be translated as such in the rest of this passage. 11 Reading 'inferiora aut in fortuna conservat'. 12 See the edition of 'Ut testatur Ergaphalau' in Burnett, 'Adelard, Ergaphalau and the Science of the Stars', in Ade lard of Bath: An English Scientist and Arabist of the Early Twe(fth Century, ed. C. Burnett, London, 1987, [article II below], pp. 143-4. 13 This is clearly the 'nigromancia secundum phisicum' of Gundissalinus."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"TALISMANS: MAGIC AS SCIENCE 5 <show> how one cannot operate with them except through the invocation of bad spirits ('maligni spiritus'). These bad spirits are called 'devils' by men.14 These bad spirits ('eorum qui in nichromantica arte operantur') dwell below the firmament, 1 s whereas the blessed souls of the dead reside in 'heaven'. Thus, according to Petrus, the story of the woman bringing back Samuel from the dead by necromancy can only be true in the sense that Samuel was not in heaven but under the jurisdiction of the devil in Hell; for the souls in heaven are out of reach of the spirits.16 Miraculous cures are performed not by magic but by the power of God. 11 Then, Petrus cites from necromantic authorities themselves, which describe necromancy's limitations: Moreover in the necromantic art it is read that a leper is never truly curied by it. In respect to the blind-at least, those who are blind from birth-physics is contrary to [necromancy], because medicine can bring light to them. Assitha the Magus bears witness that light is never truly restored to them through the necromantic art. Moyses: That may be. But what do you say about the dead, when the same Assitha claims that a man can revive them and speak with them, and shows the way to do it in his book, and on the other hand <what do you say about> what is read in the book of Kings, as we have said, of how Samuel was revived through a woman with a spirit? Petrus: It is certainly true that Assitha bears witness as you say, but there is a great distance between the work of God and that which is done through the art of magic ('magicam artem'), in respect to the resurrection of the dead. For the dead, when raised to life by a magician ('magus'), cannot walk further than the length of their shadow, but, when they reach that point, they fall to earth dead again. ts It is possible that the differentiaton in the De ortu scientiarum and Gundissalinus' s De divisione philosophiae between 'necromancy according to physics' and 'talismans', shows the same distinction bet-ween what is carried on with the help of spirits, and what uses talismans without spirits. 'Physics' here presumably refers to the 'physical' arguments whereby the upper world •moves' creatures of the lower world. 14 Der Dialog des Petrus A(tonsi: Seine Oberlieferung im Druck und in den Handschriften.

But even Christ's miracles can be ex.plained physically; e.g., that he rose to heaven beause his body was made out of the most subtle materials."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"6 TALISMANS: MAGIC AS SCIENCE The works that Albertus describes as belonging to his third, licit species of talismans are Thabit b. Qurra's De imaginibus and 'Ptolemy\"s work of the same name. 'Ptolemy\"s De imaginibus,19does, indeed, turn out to be a text without demons or fumigations, though it does include incantations, but these are addressed to the objects of the lower world, not to celestial powers. It tells one how to make talismans belonging to each of the decans of the twelve signs of the zodiac. To take an example: When you want to bind robbers so that they do not enter the house, you will design ('figurabis') an image of a man in bronze, when the first decan of Aries is rising. After this you will say: 'I bind every robber from this house through this image'. Put it in the middle of the house and a robber will·not enter it.20 The De imaginibus of Thabit, however, exists in two Latin versions, which overlap in their subject-matter but are significantly different from each other. The first version is by Adelard of Bath, who translated Arabic mathematical and astrological works at the beginning of the twelfth century. The 'second is by 'Magister John of Seville and Limia', a mysterious figure working in Spain and Portugal in the second quarter of the same century.21 The most conspicuous difference between the two versions is that Adelard's includes the prayers to spirits, whereas in John's text all mention of spirits is absent. This difference is reflected in Albertus's classification in which, as we can see from the incipits Albertus includes, the licit text of Thabit on talismans (De imaginibus)-i.e., the one in the third category-is John's, whereas Adelard's text is included in a long list of illicit 'necromantic' texts which Albertus sets out to warn people away from them. Unfortunately we cannot yet compare either version with an original Arabic text of Thabit' s work. However, from what we know of Thabit in other sources, it is most likely that he would have included prayers to the spirits of the planets and other spirits. For he is the best-known representative of the intellectual branch 19 See D. Pingree, 'The Diffusion of Arabic Magical Texts in Western Europe', in La diffusione delle scienze islamiche nel media evo europeo, Convegno internazionale promosso dall' Accademia nazionale dei Lmcei, Rome, 1987, pp. 57-102 (75-6). The ascription to Ptolemy is false; there is no evidence even of a Greek text of this sort. 20 Paris, Bibliotheque nationale, lat. 16204, p. 539: 'Cum volueris ligare latrones ut non intrent domum, figurabis .o. ( = imaginem) viri ex ere cum ascendit prima facies Alhamel. Post hec dices: \"alligo omnem latronem ab hac domo per hanc .o.\" Pone earn in medio domus et non introibit in earn latro.' 21 An edition of Adelard's text-Liber prestigiorum Thebidis-is in preparation by the present author. Two redactions of John of Seville and Limia's text have been edited by F. J. Carmody in The Astronomical Works ofThabit b. Qurra, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1960."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"TALISMANS: MAGIC AS SCIENCE 7 of the Sabaeans in Baghdad in the ninth century.22 The Sabaeans came from the Syriac speaking area of f:larran, and developed a religious philosophy which involved a curious blend of Aristotle's natural science and Hermetic magic. They had built temples for each of the seven planets, and believed that there were powerful spirits residing in each of the planets, whose names they passed on in their esoteric literature along with the prayers to be addressed to these spirits. Thabit, as well as translating Greek scientific texts into Arabic, also wrote several texts on the Sabaean philosophy-religion, and was regarded by the Arabs as an expert especially on talismans. We know that an Arabic text on talismans by Thabit was in Muslim Spain (al-Andalus) in the eleventh century, since phrases from its opening sentence are quoted in Picatrix: Toa.bit b. Qurra, in the book that he composed about talismans, says that 'The noblest part of astronomy is the science of talismans', and adds: 'it is said that no body has life which hasn't a soul' .23 This is presumably the text translated by Adelard and John. For the opening in John of Seville and Limia's translation runs as follows: Toa.bit said that Aristotle said that he who has read philosophy and geometry and every science, but is ignorant of the science of the stars, is unable to do anything, because the science of talismans is more worthy than geometry and higher than philosophy. The Philosopher (Aristotle) said in the second treatise of his book [i.e., the De anima] that, just as there is no movement for a body that lacks a soul, nor life to an animate body except through food which is digested and suited to the body's nature, 24 so there is no light of wisdom when the science of the stars has been left out. And just as the spirit cannot live except by the food which is suited to the body's nature, so there is no root of wisdom for him who lacks philosophy ( or the science of the stars), nor is there the light of geometry when he lacks the science of the stars; and the height and summit of the science of the stars is the science of talismans. 25 22 The exact nature of the beliefs of the Sabaeans, the Greek texts they had available, and the works they composed, are not yet clear, and it is possible that certain Hermetic and astrological beliefs were foisted upon them. [For the account given here see the bibliography in article III below). 23 Picatrix, I.v.36, p. 23: ' ... Thebit ben Corat in libro quern composuit De ymaginibus, qui sic ait: sciencia ymaginum est nobilior pars astronomie. Et subdit: corpus caret vita deficiente spiritu'. 24 This statement has only a general equivalent in the first chapter of the second book of Aristotle's De anima. 25 De imaginibus, 1-2, ed. Carmody, p. 180: 'Dixit Thebit Bencorah: Dixit Aristo-teles: Qui philosophiam et geometriam omnemque scientiam legerit et ab astro-nomia vacuus fuerit, erit occupatus et vacuus, quia dignior geometria et altior philosophia est imaginum scientia.

This preface places the science of talismans in its rightful position in the hierarchy of the arts and justifies its study through the telling of an experience which is allegedly that of the translator himself:26 Having read through the other books of astronomy, e.g., of the courses of the planets and others which seemed to be relevant to this art, and when I had obtained none of the things for the sake of which I had sought Hispanae part es, for several days I lay wasting away and affected by such aversion that, sedating my desperation on being now thought to be halting among the experts of this science, I threw from me the worry of such labour undertaken in vain. For I saw that I had laboured in this for too long a time, and, moreover, that I had expended not a little of my own resources in this-since I was making no profit from elsewhere-especially when, placed amongst wild races, I was living without help far from the domestic <comforts of people having> complete faith towards God. It is not necessary for me to tell you, wise as you are, what state of mind I was in. The Master, seeing me in a bad way because of such worry and solicitously enquiring what was wrong, when he had heard about the weariness of my soul, seemed to smile. Finally, looking through the volumes of his books, he produced a small book written in Arabic from his bookcase, in which several books of his were enclosed. When I was demanding from him incessantly with an eager mind what it contained, he started to say this about the book: 'Do not believe, dearest friend, that all those who study this science can arrive at the heart [i.e., esoteric knowledge] of it. For there are some who know the courses and conjunctions of planets and also of the signs, and contemplate in their minds the machine of almost the whole sky, to such an extent that they think nothing is lacking to them of this art. But, to confess the truth, their distance from it is as great as that of him who has never tasted anything of it. For our wise men, considering the nature and significations of the planets more subtly, seeing them now to be for the good, now for evil, from the hugeness of the capacity of their intelligence have excerpted certain proofs and examples, as it were, and have made animato corpori nisi per cibum quo diriguntur ( v.l. digeruntur) et aptantur eius nature, ita non est lumen sapientie cum astronomia evacuata fuerit. Et quemadmodum spiritus non poterit subsistere nisi per cibum quo aptantur nature corporis, ita non est radix scientie apud eum qui philosophia caruerit ( v.l. apud eum qui caruerit astronomia) nee est lumen geometrie cum vacua fuerit astronomia; sublimitas autem et al titudo astronomie est imaginum scientia.'

In this is contained how the talismans can help or hinder the wise man or another person (as will be shown in what follows). Hence also certain people under the pretence of religion, judge this science to be, as it were, shameful, not noticing that God has bestowed this utility of His world rather on His servants; and, for the punishment of ill-doers and the praise of the just, He has made the art to be acknowledged amongst His works as wonderful beyond all others. But perhaps someone may object, saying among other things that it is not the will of God that anyone should operate evil. To which I reply: \"Do you not know that an axe is made for splitting wood? Surely, if anyone kills a man with the axe, with a wicked mind, the use of an axe should not for this reason be blamed or rejected as if coi:idemned? This is not the case, I say\". But because I have replied sufficiently to these petty objections of our adversaries, let us turn to other things.' This book, then, I obtained from him, with the help of God's Spirit-a book which no Latin other than a certain Auriocenus, who once obtained a part of it, ever had. If anyone, therefore, paying attention to this, wishes to know it, he should only make every effort to have (of all things) this book, i.e., a book on talismans. For through it, if he pays careful attention, he will without doubt obtain the sum of all this teaching. Pay attention then, whoever you are, and with a careful mind, think about what should be read in it, and consider diligently the significations of the planets both for good and for evil. I am tempted to see the previous, partial translation mentioned here, as that of Adelard. The description ofit as being 'partial' is appropriate, and Auriocenus could possibly be a corruption of Angligena or Anglicanus.27 What John does not say is that he has omitted all mention of spirits. Maybe this is implied in his contrast of Christianity to the religion of the 'wild races' he finds himself amongst. In this respect, as I have said, Adelard's translation is probably more faithful to the original Arabic. Adelard might have followed the advice of Petrus Alfonsi and studied necromancy, for, in his Quaestiones naturales he mentions taking lessons, along with his nephew, with an old woman magician ('anus praestigiosa') with the intention of learning how to perform magical incantations, since he was 'most studious of incantations' ('incantatio-nibus studiosus').28 The 'Liber praestigiorum of Thabit following Pto-lemy and Hermes' is the title he adopts for his own version of Thabit, probably taking up Isidore of Seville's description of 'praestigia' as that which Mercury (i.e Hermes) invented, so called because it dazzled 27 R. Lemay, 'The True Place of Astrology in Medieval Science and Philosophy: Towards a Definition', in Astrology, Science and Society, ed. P. Curry, Woodbridge, 1987, pp. 57-73 (70), interprets 'Auriocenus' as 'Antiochenus', but still believes that the reference is to Adelard, who visited Antioch. 28 Adelard of Bath, Quaestiones naturales, ed.

'29 As a respresentative of the necromantic art I would like to look at its contents more closely. In Ade lard's translation the necessity of knowing the science of the stars (both astronomy and astrology) before going on to the higher science of talismans is spelt out. First Adelard refers to astronomy. He criticizes those who believe in the advance of the vernal point in respect to the constellations of 8 degrees in one direction and then a retreat of the same number of degrees in the other, and favours what seems to us to be the impossible view-but one found in the Indian system known to the Arabs-that there is no movement of the vernal point (precession of the equinoxes). This is so that the 'astrological' constellation will be the same as the visible constellation. Thus creatures in the lower world will obey those in the higher: the individual lion will obey the zodiacal lion, the individual scorpion will obey the zodiacal scorpion etc.'without any sign of advance and retreat'. Adelard then goes through the astrological knowledge that is necessary: the planets' houses, exaltations, depressions, and nodal points; the fortunate and unfortunate aspects, the bright and shadowy degrees, etc.JO Ade lard also refers to two other texts on talismans, including 'Ptolemy'' s De imaginibus, which he evidently knew at first hand. The practitioner should not be preoccupied by any worries and should be free from other occupations. Moreover he should act with confidence. For 'lack of hope is the mother of hesitation, and hesitation is the mother of ineffectiveness' .31 The importance of this astrological training becomes apparent in the next section of Adelard' s treatise which gives rules for the casting of any talisman: 1) The bodily parts of the talisman are to be sculpted at the astrologically appropriate time: the eyes when the Moon is applying to the Sun in a fortunate aspect and the Moon is in one of its dignities and free from a malefic; the right ear when the Sun or Venus is applying to Saturn in one of its dignities, etc. 2) The lord of the ascendant should be a benefic, in a fortunate place, and free from a malefic, etc. 29 Isidore of Seville, Etymologiae, VIII, 9, 33: 'Praestigium vero Mercurius primus dicitur invenisse. Dictum autem praestigium, quod praestringat aciem oculorum'. 30 These are the subject of Abu Ma<shar's Abbreviation of the Introduction to Astrology, which Adelard translated under the title 'Ysagoga minor' and to which he refers at the end of the libe r prestigiorum. 31 Uber prestigiorum, 12: 'Desperatio autem mutatio, mutatio inefficatie mater est'.

This preliminary procedure will enable one to determine whether it is worth going on with the operation or not. (One determines, in particular, whether the horoscope is suitable to the topic concerned). 4) It is also helpful if the birth-horoscope of the client is known, because this adds weight to the testimony of the horoscope of the hour of the question. Following these general rules Adelard gives instructions for making talismans, divided into two groups (arranged as two short books), the first is for gaining love: l) gaining the love of your equal. 2) gaining the love of your son. 3) gaining the love of the king. 4) regaining the love of your husband or wife. The second is for causing harm, and for other purposes: 1) causing hatred between people. 2) causing all-out war between people. 3) regaining stolen money. 4) increasing one's wealth. 5) winning a law suit. 6) protecting a place against misfortune. 7) destroying a city. 8) driving scorpions out of a city. If you want to make a talisman for gaining love you use lead, iron, bronze, gold or silver. If you want to cause hatred, you use pitch and tar, bitumen and aloes. One may take as an example the procedure for making an image to entice the love of another person: First the ascendant should be fixed and (as we have said) the appropriateness or otherwise of the question should be considered. If it is appropriate to carry on, first the ascendant and then the eleventh place (since this is the place that is relevant to association and friendship) and the lord of the ascendant are to be made fortunate .... [other astrological considerations are mentioned] ... Having done this, with fixed intent one should entice an image of companionship out of the aforementioned seal.32 Then the name of the person whose love is sought is inscribed. Then a second talisman should be cast with the name of the person seeking love, and should be drawn out of the eleventh place. When this has been done, their names and cognomina should be written on each talisman. The two talismans should be placed together in such a way that the name on one of them is pressed against the heart o__f the other.

Do this three nights in a row, after bathing and wearing clean clothes, and, whilst you are doing this, pray as follows:33 \"O shining spirits of the planets, you who descend from al-'alam (i.e. the macrocosm), 34 effectors of good and evil! Bind the spirit of Socrates, son of Sophroniscus, to the heart of Plato. Let their will and desire be one; let loathing and rejection be absent; but let the imagination and memory <of the other> be always present. Be present, too, spirits of the hours of the planets, not only by day, but also in the night and in their dreams. Bring the picture of Socrates' image before Plato's eyes to such an extent that, all other feelings excluded, he gives himself totally to him, by the power of God.\" This done, the same images should be bound in a girdle of the same nature as the lords of the signs. Then they should be placed in the house of Socrates and Plato, such that the wind blows over them in the ent~anceway, but that they are out of the rays of the sun. A benefic must be m the ascendant at the time of the burying. 35 If a wife wants to regain the love of her husband, 36 an image of a most beautiful woman must be made, and bound to the talisman of the man-all this at astrologically appropriate times. Rings of Venus and the Sun are painted, while one says the fol'lowing prayer: \"O fount of honour, joy and light of the world! Mix together the loves of these two people, .o spirits, using your knowledge of mixing, and being helped towards this end by the greatest power and the might of al-malik (~.e., :the king'), qt-1uddus (i.e., 'the most holy') and al-1:wyah al-dil ima (1.e., the eternal hfe ),37 and by the power of him who moves the heaven-ly circles, giving to them nur (i.e. 'light') and 'iyan (i.e. 'illumination')38 over this lower world.\" Then bind the talismans in girdles as before.39 ~hen the intention. is that the race of scorpions should be put to flight from any place, agam, at an astrologically appropriate time, 33 Note that Adelard retains several Arabic words in his prayers which he then translates into Latin; I too will keep the Arabic words, providing English translations only for Adelard's Latin interpretations. 34 'Al-'alam' literally means 'the world'; the word appears as 'elaalem' in the Latin manuscripts. 35 Uber prestigiorum, 43-57. 36 This is ample proof that women were clients too. 37 The Arabic words appear as 'elmelic', 'elkeudduc', and 'elhaiedemi'. 38 The Arabic words appear as 'noram' and 'eian'. 39 Liber prestigiorum, 83-4."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"TALISMANS: MAGIC AS SCIENCE 13 the form of a scorpion should be made from bronze or tin or lead or gold or silver, in such a way that the right foot occupies the place of the left and the left that of the right.

Let the same instruction be for every kind of animal or reptile, provided that the ascendant is put into relation with that kind.40 Thus we see that 'the noblest part of astronomy' is, in fact, the practical part, as has already been said. This is emphasised in the first sentences of the text which in Adelard's version may be translated: Whoever is skilled in geometry and philosophy but without experience of the science of the stars, is useless ( otiosus ); for the science of the stars is, of all the arts, both the most excellent in its subject-matter and the most useful because of the effect of talismans. Talismans are useful. The same idea occurs in the translations of works on astrological judgements of the period, and indeed, according to Albertus Magnus, the talismanic art is simply a branch of astrological judgements: it is one way by which the astrologer gives his client information about hidden things, about future events, and, in particular, about how to secure what he wants by carrying out a specific ceremony at a specific time. For the Sabaeans, Toa.bit and his Latin translators, the science of talismans is the culmination of the science of the stars, which in turn is the final and most exalted of the seven liberal arts.41 In the Speculum astronomiae of Albertus Magnus the science of talismans, which is mainly necromantic, also comes at the end of the list of the genres of astrology. But, whereas Albertus is in favour of the other branches of astrology, since they involve reading the signs put by God in His providence in the heavens, and not the manipulation of future events by magical means, he rejects the entire science of talismans, except the kind found in 'Ptolemy\"s De imaginibus, and John of Seville and 40 Ibid., 70-6. 41 For the science of the stars being the culmination of the seven liberal arts, see Hugo of Santalla, Preface to Liber trium iudicum, ed.

Secondly, a translation of the shorter introduction to astrology of Abu Ma<shar, known as the lsagoge minor. Thirdly, a translation of a work on casting talismans, of which the title in Latin is Uber prestigiorum Thebidis secundum Pto/omeum et Hermetem. i.e., 'the book of talismans of Toa.bit b. Qurra, which follows [the teaching of] Ptolemy and Hermes'.1 The Centiloquium was one of the most popular astrological texts in the Middle Ages. It consists of one hundred aphorisms giving succinct advice to the astrologer, or the doctor who was expected to make certain astrological observations. For example, the astrologer is told not to make an 'election' (i.e., not to tell his client what decision to make in regard to a given situation) unless he is sure of the strength of his client's desire. 'Otherwise', we read, 'the astrologer will be like someone reading a treatise in a language he does not understand. One cannot put confidence in him when he follows this course'. 2 The doctor should not bleed a limb when the Moon is in the sign of that limb; one should not put on new clothes when the Moon is in Leo, etc. These aphorisms were translated from Arabic into Latin at least four times before the middle of the twelfth century. Adelard's version is incomplete and may never have been finished. 3 Abu Ma< shar's lsagoge minor is a much abbreviated version of his lntro-ductorium maius. All philosophical and aetiological material has been rigorously excised, and we are left with bare astrological information of the type which could just as easily be set out in a series of tables. First comes the nature of the· signs. For each sign most of the following information is given: the planet whose house the sign is; the planets whose exaltations and dejections occur in it; the lords of its three decans; its nature, described in terms of qualities, elements and humours; its sex; its taste; whether it rejoices by day or by night; whether it I For the manuscripts of, and the secondary material on, Adelard's astrological works see the Catalogue, pp. 163--96 below.

There are twenty-five states in which the planets can stand in respect to one another, and various kinds of 'misfortune' can befall the planets; the 'misfortunes' of the Moon are particularly numerous. The individual natures of the planets are rehearsed in a way similar to that of the signs of the zodiac. The method of working out the 'lots', which are points on the ecliptic calculated by special means, is given. Lists of the periods of a man's life ascribed to each of the planets, of the planets' 'boundaries' within the signs, and the planets assigned to each 'ninth part' of a sign, are given. The degrees themselves are divided according to whether they are dark, shadowy, light, indifferent or empty, and according to whether they are masculine or feminine. Finally, the points on the ecliptic called 'wells' and 'excesses', where the planets respectively lose their efficiency and gain more power, are enumerated. The assignation of different terrains to different planets and the sections on boundaries, ninth-parts, shadowy degrees, masculine and feminine degrees, and * wells and excesses, are not found in the Arabic manuscripts of the Isagoge minor known to me,5 but correspond to the relevant sections of the Introductorium maius.6 The Liber prestigiorum gives instructions on how to make talismans. The practitioner should be skilled in astrology and should be confident in himself. For 'desperation causes change, and change is the mother of inefficiency'.7 A melothesia (i.e., the assignation of each of the parts of the body to a planet) follows. Then we learn how to construct talismans for inducing love, for winning back a wayward spouse, for causing hatred, for finding lost possessions, for winning a law-suit, for promotion, and for driving out scorpions. The talisman can be made of tin or lead, bronze, gold or silver, depending on the planet whose power is invoked. An appropriate image is inscribed on it; it is fumigated with a mixture of spices, and a prayer is recited over it; it is then buried in the position where it might have the most influence over its victim. A similar procedure is applied to rings. The treatise ends with some miscellaneous astrological information, some of which duplicates that of the Isagoge minor.

The lsagoge minor and the Centi-loquium are both in the twelfth~century MS, London, British Library, Sloane, 2030; and the Isagoge minor once was followed by the Liber prestigiorum Thebidis in MS, Avranches, Bibliotheque municipale, 235, another twelfth-century manuscript. In no manuscript does the Centiloquium occur on its own.9 Only in one manuscript does the /sagoge minor occur without either of the other two works, and the Liber prestigiorum is found only in two further manuscripts, where it accompanies other works on talismans. Thus the manuscript tradition shows that these three works travelled together. Their similarity in content and style of translation corroborates this. None of the works is accompanied by a preface by the translator. Personal asides intrude in only one work, the Liber prestigiorum, in which Bath is used as the example of the city from which scorpions are to be driven out.10 All three translations are crudely literal and suggest that the author was not yet confident in Arabic. Several words are left in Arabic - including such common terms as shemeli (northern) and genubi (southem)11 -and in the lsagoge minor the Arabic equivalents of many of the Latin terms used are included in the margin, as if the translator is not certain whether his audience or his fellow astrologers would know what he meant to convey by the Latin term that he was trying out. If a deliberate stylistic feature in these otherwise painfully literal translations can be observed, it is in the opening words of the Isagoge minor and Liber prestigiorum, which resemble each other. The /sagoge minor begins: 'Quicumque philosophie scientiam altiorem studio constanti inquirens ... ' The Liber prestigiorum begins: 'Quicumque geometria atque philosophia peritus astronomie expers fuerit ociosus est. Est enim astronomia omnium artium et rerum excellentissima'. Both these openings are based on phrases in the original Arabic, 12 but the particular phraseology and some of the terms must surely have been influenced by the work De utilitatibus astrolabii attributed to Adelard's well-known predecessor Gerbert of Aurillac: by Adelard occurs in the Ghayat al-J!akim or Picatrix; see H. Ritter and M. Plessner, 'Picatrix', das Ziel des Weisen von Pseudo-Magri~i(London, 1962), p. 35. 9 R. Lemay, however, has pointed out that there are manuscripts of the Latin Centiloquium in which more than one translation is given for each verbum, and Adelard's is one of the translations used in these composite versions (n. 3 above, p. IOI). 10 MS Lyon, Bibliotheque municipale, 328, fol. 73v: ' .. .inter humandum hec oratio dicatur: hec species <et> omnis sui generis species a loco presenti, verbi gratia a Batonia, fuget, ut nulla earn vel intrare vel inhabitare queat'. 11 Jsagoge minor, MS Sloane 2030, fol. 83. Adelard's transliterations possibly represent an English rendering of shamali and janubi. 12 A literal translation of the Arabic text of the Jsagoge minor in MS Paris, Bibliotheque nationale, ar. 2696 gives the following: 'Ja'far b. Mu~mad al-Balkhi, known as Abu Ma'shar, said: No true knowledge of the sciences would be reached except by permanent consideration of the wonders of the movements of the planets moving in the universal atmosphere and the knowledge of the existent causes in the world .. .'. The beginning of the Arabic text of the Liber prestigiorum as it is cited in Picatrix (n. 8 above) runs: 'The noblest pan of the science of the stars is the science of talismans'. This is closer to the version of Thabit's Uber prestigiorum translated by John of Seville and edited by F. J. Carmody in The Astronomical Works of Thabit b. Qurra (Berkeley, 1960), pp. 180-97.

One might regret that Adelard himself did not write a preface explaining his methods, his choice of texts, the context of his translations, and the purpose which he thought they might serve, and if one turns to the only manuscript in which all three astrological works occur together, one might at first think that one has found the translator's introduction. For in Lyon, Bibliotheque municipale, 328, between the Uber prestigiorum and the Jsagoge minor is a work composed in Latin of which the avowed purpose is to locate the study of the science of the stars in its appropriate position in a scheme of knowledge.17 This short work has no title, but may be called from its incipit Ut testatur Ergaphalau. The catalogue of Thorndike and Kibre gives only one further manuscript of this work. This is a twelfth-century manuscript originally from the Cathedral Priory of Durham, and might have been part of the rich collection of medical and scientific manuscripts donated to the Cathedral by a physician named Her(i)bertus in the third quarter of the twelfth century.18 In this manuscript, now in Jesus College, Cambridge, Ut testatur Ergaphalau serves as the preface to a copy of Adelard's De opere astrolapsus.19 Ut testatur Ergaphalau is a curious work. It starts with a citation of Ergaphalau to the effect that 'no one can understand any subject unless he has thoroughly mastered the sciences which precede that subject'. Since the science of the stars is the goal of all knowledge, then a rational division of the whole of knowledge must be given. What follows, however, in no way resembles the t.l De urilirarihus asrro/ahii, ed. N. Bubnov, in Gerheni Opera marhemarica (Berlin, 1899). pp. 109-47; for the opening words see p.

There are two kinds of science. The first is that of the soul or the will. The second that of the body or nature. Natural science (scientia naturalis) is shared by animals and men, and includes the knowledge of eating, drinking, running, fighting, and bringing up young. Voluntary science (scientia voluntatis) emerges from the impulse initiated by a man's desire and is divided into philosophy, wisdom (sapientia) and science tout court. The author does not explain the latter and describes philosophy only briefly, stating that it is either concerned with fables and 'envelopes' (involucra) under which the truth is hidden (he gives Martianus Capella's 'Philosophy' as an example of this),21 or it works through similes - revealing the nature of higher beings through the consideration of lower ones. One would have liked the author to have explained what he meant by this, but, instead, the author dedicates the rest of his introduction to wisdom (sapientia). His conception of sapientia appears to be that of Boethius, and one of his definitions is an echo of that used by Boethius in his De arithmetica. Compare Sapientia est comprehensio rerum que immutabilitatem essentie sue volente natura sortiuntur (Ut testatur Ergaphalau) with Haec igitur, quoniam ... natura inmutabilem substantiam vimque sortita sunt, vere proprieque esse dicuntur. Horum igitur. .. scientiam sapientia profitetur (Boethius).22 II But he also defines sapientia as that which holds the middle position between art and science. It is divided into a ministering and a ministered part. Here at last we begin to feel that we may be entering familiar territory, because three subjects of the quadrivium, music, arithmetic and geometry, are mentioned. However, we soon lose our way again,· because these three mathematical arts tum out not to be ministering to astronomy, as a fourth, but rather to be propaedeutic to physica. The author describes physica as the science by which the movements of natural things are studied. Under it is subsumed the study, fi'rst, of the movements of those things which come into being and pass away, which is the study of the microcosm, or medicine; and secondly, the movements of those things which do not suffer generation and corruption, i.e., the study of the macrocosm, or the science of the stars. The latter is given the unprecedented title astronodia. Once * again the author presses into service a definition of Boethius, by describing astronodia as the study of magnitude in motion.23 But he attaches a statement that firmly brings astrology under the wing of astronomy. His full definition is: 20 For the divisions of science current in the Middle Ages, see J. Weisheipl, 'Classification of the Sciences in Medieval Thought', Mediaeval Studies, 27 ( 1965), pp. 54-90.

Dronke, Fabula (Leiden, 1974), pp. 56--7. By 'Philosophy' our author must mean Manianus's De nuptiis Phi/ologiae et Mercurii, ed. J. Willis (Leipzig, 1983). 22 Boethius, De arithmetica, 1, i, ed. G.

Eastwood for showing me a microfilm of this manuscript."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"II 138 Astronodia is the science of magnitude in motion, which investigates the two movements of the matter which is not subject to generation and decay, and which, by judging the threefold passing of time, reveals present things, predicts future things, and recalls to mind past things. Astronodia is divided into astrologia and astronomia. This division does not correspond to our present-day conceptions of astrology and astronomy. The division is made, rather, according to whether an instrument is used or not. In all the subdivisions of astrologia an instrument is not needed, and the science is studied with the intellect alone. This is possible in the case of 'fabulous astrology' in which myths reveal the rationale of the stars (as in Martianus), historical astrology, in which historical events are seen to correspond to the yearly revolutions (and possibly conjunctions) of the heavenly bodies, and natural or rational astrology, which alone is the exact mathematical science of astronomy as we-know it. The term astronomia is reserved for the science which needs instruments - i.e., the experimental science. It is here that the author expatiates most fully. This experimental science is divided into a part in which events of the past, present and future are discovered but not changed by the observation of the stars; and a part in which events are manipulated or engineered. Raymond of Marseilles, a contemporary of Adelard, described the same division in terms of contemplativa astronomia and activa astronomia-. 24 Various methods for the first part, i.e., for predicting events, are described, and for each an authority is given. Each is also given a curious name, in which Greek or Arabic words are dressed in Latin form. Thus we have onomica scientia, in which the numerical values of the client's name are used; chronica scientia iri which the judgment is made from the hour in which the client approaches the astrologer; augealis scientia, perhaps from the Arabic auj ('apogee'), in which the positions of the planets in their houses are significant, etc. The 'perfect kind' of astronomia combines all these different methods. As for the manipulative. science, this includes the science in which talismans are used alone, and the science in which talismans are used in conjunction with spells and incantations. The author ends his introduction by saying that some of this science does not seem to be in agreement with the Catholic faith, but he could, if need be, go on to show that it is all true. Ut testatur Ergaphalau is not a translation from another language. The author is certainly aware of two definitions by Boethius and refers to Martianus by name. However, the subject-matter does not seem to belong to a Western European tradition, and most of the authorities appear to have come via an oriental route. One can recognize straight away the name Ptolemy, whose astronomia perfecta is presumably his Tetrabiblos, though it may be his C entiloquium. The textbook on 'rational astrology' is by 'Alfagrani' who must be the ninth-century author al-Farghani, and would be either his Elements, which summarizes Ptolemy's Almagest and which was translated into Latin twice in the 24 MS Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum, McClean 165, fol. 48: 'Contemplativa est que ha.bet se in solo cursu planetarum ... Activa est que habet se in opere sigillorum et imaginum' (from the preface of Raymond of Marseilles's liber cursuum p/anetarum VII)."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"ADELARD, ERGAPHALAU AND THE SCIENCE OF THE STARS 139 twelfth century, or his commentary on al-Khwarizmr's tables.25 Hermes is given as the authority on historical astrology, and several astrological works are attributed to Hermes in Arabic.26 These authorities show that the author was aware of Arabic astrological and astronomical writings of the kind that would have been available in al-Andalus any time from the late ninth century onwards. There are two indications, how-ever, that suggest that the author may have had closer contacts with Jews rather than with Arabs in al-Andalus. First of all, the author mentions the Astronomia quorundam Arabum, as if he is not an Arab himself. Secondly, as an example of astronomia planetica, a work by a Jew is cited: Astronomia Abinded ludei. We know of at least one Abraham b. Daud who wrote on astrology, for a passage in Latin is attributed to a man of that name in a Toledan manuscript; this concerns the relationship of the place of the ascendent at the time of conception to that of the Moon at the time of birth.27 Mlle d' Alvemy has conjectured that this may be the same Abraham b. Daud who fled from Cordova to Toledo in the middle of the twelfth century and was the author of the Emunah Ramah, and may in tum be identified with the Avendauth who collaborated with Dominicus Gundissalinus in translating Ibn Sina's De anima.28 However, Ibn Daud must have been a common Jewish name, and we may be dealing with several different people. In considering the possibility that Ut testatur Ergaphalau might be written by an author familiar with Jewish material, and seeing that his work occurs with that of Adelard of Bath and no one else, one might assess the possibility that Petrus Alfonsi had something to do with the work. For Petrus was a converted Jew and was in England at the same time as Adelard of Bath, probably as a doctor of King Henry I; his opinions on the lunar nodes and eclipses were written down by Watcher, Prior of Malvem;29 and it seems that his version of the tables of al-Khwarizmi was combined with that of Adelard at an early date.30 We know that Petrus himself wrote an· introduction to the science of the stars, known as the Letter to the Peripatetics of France, which, in an abbreviated version, accompanies the composite text of the Tables of al-Khwarizmi.31 This letter, like Ut testatur Ergaphalau, emphasizes the importance of-the science of the stars and attempts to locate it within a system of learning. Petrus refers to certain sciences as common to animals and man. He regards arithmetic as necessary for the other sciences, and he elevates physica as a discipline. Finally, both the author of Ut testatur Ergaphalau and Petrus claim that their science is not in 25 A. I. Sabra, 'Al-Farghiini', in Dictionary of Scientific Biography, ed. C. C.

However, there are some striking differences between the two writings. In describing science, Petrus takes as his starting point the traditional Latin trivium and quadrivium, finding reason to disparage grammar but to advance astronomy, whereas the author of Ut testatur Ergaphalau hardly brings the traditional seven arts into his framework at all. Petrus, in common with the Ikhwan al-Safi> , the author of the Secretum secretorum, and several translators in the twelfth century ,32 divides the science of the stars into three parts, which we may characterize as celestial physics, mathematical astronomy, and astrology. The author of Ut testatur Ergaphalau makes a more detailed and idiosyncratic division of the science of the stars, as we have seen. The style of writing of the two authors is also very different, and Petrus shows no toleration for recherche Greek forms such as those used by the author of U t testatur Ergaphalau. The common 'feel' of the two works may be due to a common aim and a shared Jewish background. If Petrus is to be discounted as author, there are two references, not discussed so far, which point in another direction. The first is the name Ergaphalau itself, which occurs not only in the opening sentence but also in the name of the book on chronica scientia: 'Astronomia Ergafalau ad Alexandrum'. The second is the authority on onomica scientia: 'Astronomia Alexandri '. A letter of Ergaphalau to Alexander is extant, and is, up to now, the only context in which the name Ergaphalau has been noted. It is a brief work which tells the astrologer how to predict what is in the mind of the client who is approaching him and what he holds in his hand, from the planet that rules the hour of his approach. It forms part of a compilation of works on judicial astrology (i.e., astronomia in the terms of our author) and is the only surviving compilation which we know to have been written in Latin between the late classical period and the time of Adelard. The compilation as a whole is variously known as 'Uber Alchandrei, Mathematica Alhandrei summi astrologi, and Mathematica Alexandri summi astrologi.33 The identification of Alchandreus with Alexander the Great is confirmed by several internal references to Alexander Macedo as the authority on which the information is based. Since a large part of the compilation concerns predicting from the numerical equivalents of the letters of the client's name (i.e., onomancy), it is clear that the Astronomia Alexandri mentioned in Ut testatur Ergaphalau is a version of the same compilation. Some of the material of the Liber Alchandrei comes from Jewish sources. In the case of the onomancy, the letters of the client's name have to be converted into Hebrew characters before their numerical value is found. The Hebrew names of the planets and the signs of the zodiac are given, and the years between the creation of the world and the present day are given according to Jewish 32 Secretum secretorum, ed. R.

The Jewish astrologer Sahl b. Bishr (early ninth ~entury) is cited,34 though it might have been in Arabic that his widely-diffused introduction to astrology was known to the compiler of the Uber Alchandrei. Millas-Vallicrosa points out correspondences between the liber Alchandrei and the Calendar of Cordova, a calendar written in Arabic for the Christian community there.3s Millas concludes that the Uber Alchandrei was written in Spain, but is based on texts of oriental provenance and incorporates both Jewish and classical material. Might we see it as a witness to an uninterrupted transmission in Spain of a simple form of astrology from the late classical times to the era of the translators? Other evidence for this transmission is provided by the lost Latin work known as the Book of the Crosses, a popular astrological work which had been translated from Latin into Arabic in Spain by the end of the eighth century.36 The date of the Uber .4.lchandrei is as yet unknown, but the earliest manuscript is of the late tenth century, and a revision of the work, which appears in at least two manuscripts, gives the 'present date' as A.D. 1040. 37 What is of interest to us is that, some time before the end of the tenth century, a more pretentious version of the material of the Uber Alchandrei was compiled. The reviser appears to have given the material the title Proportiones competentes in astrorum industria ('Corresponding ratios in the business of the stars'?), though at least two manuscripts retain the title Mathematica Alexandri summi philosophi, and the work may have continued to be known as the book of Alchandreus. The text begins: 'In primordio (or exordio) omnis creature herus uranicus ... ' ('In the beginning of all creation the heavenly master .. .'), and the use of recherche terms, especially of Greek etymology, such as uranicus, is typical of the work; e.g., we find Cillenius for Mercury, Phebus for the sun, Cela for the zodiac-sign Scorpio, ebdomada for week, hippocrates for the profession of doctor, peripateticus for the profession of philosopher, and even serapion for a kind of illness.

It is significant that the only Latin author that is mentioned by name in Vt testatur Ergaphalau is Martianus; that the author of Vt testatur Ergaphalau should express his allegiance to Ergaphalau and refer to Alexander, the main authorities on which the Proportiones competentes is based; and that the authors of both Ut testatur and Proportiones competentes should revel in using Greek and Arabic terms dressed in Latin garb. One may note that the title Proportiones competentes recalls the phrase in the description of astronomy in Ut testatur Ergaphalau, that this science determines the changes of things subject to generation and decay through the proportio of the bodies which are not subject to generation and decay. The successive versions of the Uber Alchandrei and the tradition of the manuscripts of these works are still to be studied in detail. However, it does not seem impossible for Ut testatur Ergaphalau to have been written some time before the end of the tenth century and by the same author as the Proportiones competentes, perhaps even as a preface to that work. The occurrence of both works with the astrological works of Adelard and the absence of an introduction to astrology by Adelard himself suggest that Adelard or an early follower may have supplemented pre·existing works on judicial astrology with Adelard's new translations and used Vt testatur Ergaphalau as a preface to that collection. We know that 'Alchandreus' was known to Adelard's contemporary who lived not too far from Bath, William of Malmesbury, for he compares Gerbert of Aurillac to 'Alandraeus '. 39 We find the De utilitatibus astrolabii attributed to Gerbert and Liber Alchandrei together in one eleventh-century manuscript,40 and one of the three manuscripts of Adelard's Regule abaci (a work which itself follows the tradition of Gerbert) once contained a work with the title Libri Alchandrei phiiosophi de astrologia.41 The collection including Vt testatur Ergaphalau, Proportiones competentes, and Adelard's astrological works, did not survive long. The Proportiones competentes was soon replaced by more sophisticated works on judicial astrology, and Adelard's clumsy and halting translations of the Centiloquium and Abii Ma'shar's lsagoge minor were replaced by much more accurate translations of the former work,42 and two translations of the more useful Introductorium maius in astrologiam of Abii Ma'shar, whilst his translation of a work on magic-working talismans became lost in a mass of material on magic and the casting of spells. Nevertheless, the study of the contents of the Liber Alchandrei, Ut testatur Ergaphalau, and the early translations of Adelard of Bath could reveal in an interesting way the first stages in the emergence of astrology as a mathematical science in Europe in the Middle Ages, and Ut testatur Ergaphalau shows one way in which the traditional division of the quadrivium was set aside and replaced by a division of sciences more accommodating to astrology . . w Gesra regum, 11, clxvii, ed.

The work begins: 'Aristotle, full of good sense, said: When the moon enters its first mansion, which is called Sartan, make a talisman for love ... When it alights in its second mansion, Albotaim, make a talisman for the favour of princes, animate statues, call angels unto you'. In this manner it continues to the end.1 It is difficult to believe that such a work would have been allowed in a monastery, belonging as it does to the same genre of writings as the book of lamne and Mambre and the phylacteries proscribed by Pope Gelasius.2 In any case a Tegernsee monk would not have found much practical use for the work. It omits to mention the material or the shape of the talismans, or the words used to summon the angels. But it has another defect. One is required to observe the position of the moon in its mansions-that is, in the twenty-eight constellations through which it passes on its sidereal orbit-to which Arabic names are given here, as elsewhere in Latin astrological works.: 1Now, our work gives only the first fourteen of these twenty-eight mansions. The Latin text of the second half of the work, covering lunar mansions fifteen to twenty-eight, is missing. What is curious is that we have an Arabic text in a compilation by 'Abd al-1:Iasan al-l~fahani, written for a certain f:lusain lrbili, probably at Baghdad at the beginning of the fifteenth century, which is incomplete in the same way.4 The page containing the work has the heading: 'The Account of the Description of the Twenty-Eight Mansions of the Moon', under which there are two columns each containing seven compartments. Thus there is one for each of the first fourteen mansions, and there is no evidence that the descriptions of the other mansions once existed in this manuscript. On the left-hand side of each compartment there is a graphic representation of the meaning of the word approximating most closely to the proper names of the lunar mansions.5 On the right-hand side, separated by the name of the mansion itself, is the prescription for each mansion. The text is very similar to that of the Tegernsee fragment. The prescription for al-Shaqain begins: 'When the moon is in it, make talismans (nara,yryyat) for the love of women', and for al-Butain we read: 'When the moon is in al-Butain make talismans for the love of kings, and fabricate amulets', etc. It is possible that both the Tegernsee and the Baghdadi texts derive from the same summary co~cerning making talismans according to the mansions of the moon. We are fortunate in having a fuller version of the text in Arabic from which such a summary may have been made, within a work called the Kitab al-Ustuwwa!as.6 Here all twenty-eight mansions of the moon are included, and the larger work into which the text is incorporated gives detailed instructions on how to make up the talismans and what secret names to use to summon the angels, or the spiritual forces, of the planets. The cryptic designs to be inscribed on the talismans and the natures of the rings into which they are to be set are also examined. The section on which talismans are to be made under which lunar mansions is firmly attributed to Aristotle. We read: 'Aristotle said: I found in the Kitab al-makhzii.n (\"The Hidden Book\") on the course of the First published in Warburg Institute Surveys and Texts 11. Pseudo-Aristotle in the Middle Ages, eds. J. Kraye, W.F. Ryan and C.B. Schmitt (London, 1987), pp. 84-96."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"III ASTROLOGICAL MAGIC ATTRIBUTED TO ARISTOTLE 85 moon in its mansions in the zodiac, matters concerning the government of man himself in his conduct and affairs together with the technique of talismans (nairanjat) and their effects'. 7 And a little fortheron we find: 'If the moon enters al-Shartain ... then make in it talismans for the love and affection of women ... When the moon is in al-Butain ... make in it talismans for the affection and love between kings and their subjects ... and make amulets in it'. In addition, for each lunar mansion it is suggested that certain activities should be undertaken or avoided, and the characteristics of the male and female children born under the mansion are described. 8 The origin of the Kitab al-Ustuwwa{tis is described as follows:9 '~Iunain ibn Is}:iaq said: This is one of the books of Aristotle which we found and translated from Greek into Arabic. It is the book of the causes of the spiritual forces by Hermes ... And this is the book in which Aristotle explained the causes of spiritual forces and talismans ... And this is what Alexander demanded from Aristotle the Wise when he had completed the Kitab al-ls{amakhis, which he had composed for Alexander to take on his journey to Persia.' Thus we have the history of a short text attributed to Aristotle. It purports to have been written for his royal pupil, and to have been translated by the greatest of the Baghdadi translators, l:funain ibn ls}:iaq (c. 8og-73 A.D.). It was taken from its context and abbreviated in Arabic. At some stage in its transmission it lost its second half. The abbreviated and truncated version was translated into Latin-possibly via Greek, since the Greek word for moon, ael1jvr,, is used-it was copied into a few manuscripts and eventually printed, in Venice in 1509. This story raises the questions which are the concern of this paper: how is it that Hermetic works on astrology and magic were couched in the form of a correspondence between Aristotle and Alexander? Can we hazard a guess at the origin of these works? How widely were they diffused? There is no doubt that Philip of Macedon summoned Aristotle back to his native land to be a tutor for the young Alexander. Whether any of the Greek correspondence that we have between the master and his pupil is genuine is a matter of dispute. An antique exchange of letters in which Aristotle explains to Alexander the value of his acroatic or esoteric writings has been claimed to be a forgery, possibly perpetrated by Andronicus of Rhodes.10TheGreek and Latin vitaewhichincludelistsof works of Aristotle are based on a lost life by a certain Ptolemy.11 It is also from Ptolemy's life of Aristotle that much of the Arabic biographical tradition ultimately derives. But here we find some differences begin to appear. In the tenth-century bibliographical dictionary of lbn al-Nadim we read of several letters on political and other subjects which passed between Aristotle and Alexander. lbn al-Nadim quotes some political maxims, allegedly from these letters.t2 However, his list of Aristotle's works indudes only a few items, such as the Theologia, which would not have been found in Ptolemy's list.13 By the time we come to lbn Abi U~aibi'ah, who wrote another bibliographical dictionary in the thirteenth century, the picture has changed considerably. At the end of his list of the canonical writings of Aristotle, U~aibi0ah writes: 'Ptolemy said that \"these are the sum total of the books I have claimed for Aristotle. But other men have claimed other books for him\" ', and U~aibi.ah goes on to boast that' I say that there are ntany books of Aristotle which I have found other than those mentioned by Ptolemy' .14 He proceeds to give some forty titles. Amongst these are several books addressed to Alexander: 'The Book on the Spiritual Forces and their Effects and their Regions', the Kitab al-lsma{ii/ts, 'The Letter on the Natures of the World',15 the Kitab al-ls{amalch'is (which, according to U~aibi'ah, Aristotle composed when"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"III 86 Alexander departed for.al-Rum), the Kitah al-Mala!is, and 'The Unmatched Book' (al-kitah al:yali\"m). Of these, the Kitah al-ls{amakh'is and the Kitah al-Mala{is (or al-Madi{is), which is described as a commentary on the Kitah al-ls{amti{is, still survive, alongside other works with similar-sounding and untranslatable titles, such as the Kitah al-Hadi{us, and the K itah al-Ustuwwa{as ( or al-Ustu{as) which has already been mentioned .16 Moreover, the subject-matter of all these books is the same: that is, they concern the manipulation of the spiritual forces of the planets through the manufacture of talismans, sometimes accompanying this practical aim with a description of the stages of creation-leading up to the creation of man as a microcosm of the whole universe-in their relation to the spiritual aspects of the cosmos.17 Most of this material is said to have been revealed by Hermes, and to have been passed on by Aristotle to Alexander. Aristotle is sometimes portrayed asking Hermes a question,18 but usually he is merely a reporter.19 Sometimes an account of the translation of these works into Arabic is given. There is a book of Hermes concerning judgements from the rising of Sirius, said to have been translated by a certain Naftouya and 'explained and corrected by Aristotle' .20 We have already seen that the Kitah al-Ustuwwa{ii.s purports to be translated by f:Iunain ibn Is}:iaq. One is not surprised to find that, stylistically, the work does not match the genuine translations of}:lunain, and the whole account of its transmission must be a fabrication.21 A work on talismans attributed to Aristotle is said to have been translated by ls}:iaq ibn J:lunain, the son of the translator f:Iunain, according to the Ghiiyat al-~akim.22 Here we read: 'lsl~aq ibn f:Iunain also had translated a tract of Aristotle, who truly is the foremost of the Greeks and merits above all men privilege and the first position. I will explain this tract here so that you might obtain the knowledge of all the teaching of the Master,. The thirteenth-century historianjirjis ibn al-'Amid Abii'l-Yasir (known as al-Makin) was aware of the tradition that Aristotle translated books of Hermes. He claimed that the translations were made from Egyptian into Greek, and mentions the titles and contents of some of them. The names al-Isiama!is and al-Ustuias are recognizable among the titles of the books al-Makin mentions.23 If we turn to the corpus of Hermetic works in Greek we do not find them associated with Aristotle or Alexander. Hermes might be speaking through his pupil Asclepius, or in dialogue with Thoth, but, amongst all his astrological and magical works in the Catalogus codicum astrologorum graecorum and discussed by Festugihe in La Revelation d'Hermes Trismegiste, not one gives Aristotle the credit for passing on the wisdom of the Thrice-Great.24 However, the relation of the Arabic Hermetica to the Greek is not straight-forward. Only one short fragment of the Corpus Hermeticum has so far been discovered in Arabic. 2~ The Kitah al-Ustuwwatas includes Arabic transliterations of Greek terms such as * istaqsat (awtzei:a) and maghnitis (μayvijn;),26 but this in itself does not suggest that it is translated from Greek. 27 Reitzenstein has shown similarities between the creation-story in the Kitah al-Ustuwwa{ii.s and that in the Pahlavi Bundahisn.28 Moreover, the word that has been translated as 'a talisman' in this paper is not the word {ilasm derived from the Greek -rfleaμa, but nairanj, which comes from the Pahlavi word nirank 'magic'. The word nairanj is used in more than one sense, but generally refers to an object mixed from organic and/or inorganic substances which is employed as an amulet or talisman.29 In the tenth-century commentary on the ninety-fifth dictum of pseudo-Ptolemy's Centiloquium by A}:imad ibn Y iisuf, reference is made to the 'Persian books of nairanjat'. 30 Moreover, in respect to the nairanjat described in Hermes's 'Hidden Book' we see an influence from further afield. For"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"III ASTROLOGICAL MAGIC ATTRIBUTED TO ARISTOTLE 87 the twenty-eight mansions of the moon are the nalc.!atra7!i of Classical Indian astrology, which became known to the Arabs through the mediation of Pahlavi texts. 31 David Pingree has described a Greek text, translated from a lost Arabic original, which concerns activities to be undertaken or avoided when the moon is in each naksatra. This text is based on three authorities, the Indians, Dorotheus, and the Persians. Sin.ce Dorotheus's Carmen astrologicum was known to the Arabs only in its Pahlavi version, this Greek treatise fairly represents Persian doctrine.32 Moreover, the sections of the text which describe the characteristics of the male and female children born under each lunar mansion corre-spond exactly to the sections on the same subject in Hermes 's 'Hidden Book'. 33 So we have reasonable evidence that at least part of the Arabic Hermetica derived from Persian and ultimately Indian sources. Further Indian connections for these works may be fictitious. The Kitii.b al-Madi{is, for example, purports to describe the naira,yat which the 'Indian spiritualist' Kinas had invented, and we find the same Kinas mentioned as the author of a book on nairanjat in ~lajji Khalifa's bibliographical dictionary.34 The real or supposed Persian and Indian origin of some of the matter of these Hermetica might have encouraged their assimilation into the correspondence between Aristotle and Alexander which included accounts of the marvels of the East and the wisdom of the Brahmans. For the twelfth-century Arabic-Latin translator, Hermann ofCarinthia, Hermes, together with Asclepius, was a pupil of the Indian king Agathodaimon, who, in Hermann's words, 'lived long before Porus, who was a contemporary of Alexander the Great'.35 In that this complex of Hermetic works transmitted under the name of Aristotle contains Indian and Persian elements, it fits in with the cosmopolitan culture of the scholars serving the early 0Abbasid caliphs in Baghdad. It may, however, be possible to define its place in this culture more precisely. In 1883 De Goeje noticed that the names of the spirits of Jupiter in the Oxford manuscript of the Kitab al-ls{amakhis corresponded with a list of nine names by which Jupiter was invoked by the Sabaeans, according to al-Tabari's description of the practice of the Sabaeans, as related in the Ghayat al-l:Jakim.36 The Sabaeans, as is well known, were a religious community living in the Syriac-speaking area of l~arran. They believed that God as prime cause was so far removed above humankind that man could only reach him through intermediaries, which were, for them, the planets. They therefore developed elaborate rituals for sacrificing to each of the planets. The two principal prophets of the Sabaeans were precisely the Hermes and Agathodaimon mentioned by Hermann of Carinthia.37 Moreover, according to Ibnal-Nadim, their scientific speculation was based on the works of Aristotle. It would be quite natural to expect the welding together of the authorities of Hermes and Aristotle to have taken place within such a climate of belief. In a Leiden manuscript, fragments of the Kitab al-Ustuwwa{as are accompanied by a text called 'The Secrets of the Sabaeans', 38 and the connection of the Kitab al-lstamakhis with the Sabaeans is corroborated by Maimonides who, in his Moreh-ha,-Nebuki,,;, lists among the books of the Sabaeans and alongside a book on talismans attributed to Aristotle, a certain 'Stomachos', which, he says, is falsely attributed to Aristotle. 39 An intellectual branch of the Sabaeans established themselves in Baghdad under the leadershipofThabit ibn Qurra (c. 826--go1 A.o.). Not only did Thabit write several works in Syriac concerning the religion of the Sabaeans, but also he was one of the leading scientific writers of his age.40 It is significant that certain Hermetic writings are attributed to him, and that he is regarded, in particular, as an authority on talismans. A work of his"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"III 88 on talismans is quoted in the Ghayat al-*akim, and exists in a Latin translation. 41 This work in itself shows a curious blend of Aristotelianism and Hermeticism in its opening words: Thabit ibn Qurra said: Aristotle said that whoever reads philosophy and geometry and every science and is without experience of astrology, will be hindered and obstructed, because the science of talismans is more precious than geometry and more profound than philosophy. Aristotle the 1philosopher said in the second treatise of his work that just as a body does not move which lacks a soul, nor is there life to the soul unless through the food by which its elements are restored, so those lack the light of science and wisdom who have no experience of astronomy ... and the most exalted and worthiest part of astronomy is the science of talismans. 42 The second citation of Aristotle refers more or less accurately to the second book of Aristotle's De anima, a work which was known to the Sabaeans, 43 but the first derives from the same reservoir of Hermetic material attributed to Aristotle, as that which supplied the Kitab al-ls[amalchis and its kindred works. Already in the twelfth century Maimonides was convinced that the Kitiih al·ls[amiikhis was not by Aristotle himself, and lbn Kammuna in the thirteenth century, was of the same opinion.44 Nevertheless, this work and its kin were extensively used, and had a considerable progeny. We find traces of these texts in the Sirr al-asriir ( the Secret ofSecrets)45 and the Sirr al-khaliqa (De secretisnaturae), 46 both of which were translated into Latin. The Epistles of the Brethren of Purity refer to the al-ls[amiikhis47 and the Ghay at al-~akim quotes from the Kitiib al-Hadi[iis, al-Maai{is, al-ls[amiikhis and al-ls[amii[is, always referring to them as 'Aristotle's' books. A work called Data neiringet (possibly, dhiit al-nairanjiit, 'the essence of the talismans') was known to Hermann of Carinthia,48 and a substantial portion of the second book of the Kitiib al-Ustuwwa[iis appears in an abbreviated Latin translation in a fifteenth-century manuscript in the Sloane collection of the British Library.49 Beside the book on making talismans according to the position of the moon in its mansions (or the 'Hidden Book') whose tradition was traced above, there is another book on talismans quoted as Liber Aristotelis de imaginibus in the margin of pseudo-Ptolemy's De imaginibus in a Harley manuscript.'° Finally, Albertus Magnus in the chapter concerning talismans in the Speculum astronomiae51 connects two books on the topic with the name of Aristotle. His words deserve to be quoted in full: Another work on Hermes is his book concerning the four confections for capturing wild animals and wolves and birds. And it is the book of Hermes addressed to Aristotle, which begins: Aristotle said: 'Did you see, 0 Hermes, etc .... ' But the very worst book on talismans is the book which Aristotle wrote to Alexander, which begins: If you wish to perceive ... This is the book which certain people call 'The Death of the Soul'. The first of these works, which is regarded by Albertus as relatively innocuous, still exists in a manuscript in Montpellier.52 But the book known as 'The Death of the Soul', fortunately for our spiritual health, has not been identified.53 NOTES I See Appendix I for an edition of this work.

K gives an extensive preface which is not shared by TML, and which affirms the authorship or Hermes. The second hair or the entry for each lunar mansion in K corresponds with the second hair or the entries in TML, while the introductory paragraph in TML ('Aristotiles plenior scnsibus (artibus K) gratia dei ubicumque') is added after entries for all twenty-eight lunar mansions in K on fol. 95v. K therefore appears to be a composite work whose relationship with other works de-scribed as 'Hermes, liber Lunt' needs further investigation (see L.

X I I I Examples of the Lunar Mansions in the Hidden Book quoted in the Ki tab al-U stuwwaias (Paris, Bibliotheque nationale, ar. 2577,fol. 24r) III 95 Aristotle said: I found in the Hidden Book.on the course of the moon in its mansions in the zodiac, matters concerning the government of man himself in his conduct and his affairs together with the technique of nairanjiit and their effects. And we describe them in their proper places and context, so that there might be one perfect system and nothing should be found wanting. Hermes said that the mansions of the moon are twenty-eight, and the stay of the moon in each mansion is twenty-four hours, and that is the completion of a day and a night. If the moon lodges in Shariain (this is fiery, a malefic, hit by a benefic), then make in it nairanjiit for love and affection towards women in particular, and do not put on new clothes on this day. For whoever puts them on when the moon is in this mansion, runs the risk of injury from which he will die, or whoever does this will be close to death. And do not enter the presence of kings on this day, and do not try to seek their patronage, and do not make contact with them. For whoever makes contact with them on this day, will be punished and killed as soon as he makes contact, and whoever calls on them will arouse against himself the spirit of anger in their hearts, and whoever seeks their patronage, will not be lucky with them, and they will quickly bring the harm of punishment to him. He said: If anyone marries on this day, the wife will be loved by the husband, and the husband by the wife, and they will fulfil each other. And buy slaves and riding animals and women and cows and plant trees on this day and build houses, for the outcome of all this will be entirely praiseworthy. But do not seek to make friends on this day with anyone from whom you seek a lasting intimacy, for those who love will not be lucky. Do not establish anything on a day like this, and do not buy any stored goods for trade, for that will be unfortunate in its outcome. And do not use anyspiritualcures or medicine, and do not travel on this day. Do not sow and do not make amulets or invocations on it. Do not practise the Art nor any of its effects on it. He said: Whoever is born on this day, if he is male, he is wicked, immoral and a spendthrift, and he will not be praised for anything. lf the child is female, she is immoral, concealing her dissolute life, a favourite among men, and desirous of them. (2) Al-Buiain (fortunate, hot and dry). When the moon lodges in it, then make in it nairanjiit for affection and love towards kings and the common people and any man you wish, but certainly not towards women. Make amulets in it and the four liberating nairanjat found in the large book al-ls{amiilch'is, and practise the Art and invoke the spiritual force in it. Approach kings in it and do not hesitate to ask for their patronage and make contact in it with the brethren, and begin a friendship between them and yourself. He said: Do not marry in it, and do not buy slaves or any live animal which you wish to keep, and do not buy in it anything for trade, for you will not be able to get rid ofit. Do not put on new clothing, for whoever does this will risk being killed on that day. Sow in it, but do not measure your crops.

Adventurers and scholars were attracted to al-Andalus because of the splendour of Islamic culture and the superiority of Arabic learning. The spoil of the Christian reconquest was not only silks and damask, but also valuable manuscripts. Refugees from Muslim-dominated areas and the intelligentsia who remained in cities reconquered by the Christians were able to impart to those who had been educated in Latin schools the scientific knowledge of a superior culture and to act as interpreters of Arabic texts. Important, too, were the Jewish communities in al-Andalus which absorbed much of Arabic scientific culture and remained largely undisturbed after the Christian reconquest. I Translation, of course, had been taking place at all levels of society with-in Islamic Spain. The community was multilingual. The official language of the government and of higher education was the literary Arabic of the Quran. Occasionally the colloquial Arabic would be written down-for example, in the poetic form known as the zajal. However, the majority of the populace spoke a Romance language. This is apparent in another poetic form which originated in Spain-the muw~-in which the refrain (!marja) is sometimes in a Romance dialect.2 This refrain is usually sung by a girl: it is significant that the vernacular should be regarded as appropriate to wives and daughters. Another vernacular was the dialect (or rather, dialects) of the Berbers who had come across the Straits of Gibraltar in large numbers with their Arabic leaders. Berber words occur in surprising places, such as in the names of one set of the sixteen figures used in the form of divination called \"geomancy\", and in the earliest European names for the \"Arabic\" numerals.3 Beside Arabic, Latin continued in use as the language of the Church. 4 Many educated Christians, however, adopted the literary language of the Muslims, and incurred disfavour for doing so from the more fanatical of their brethren. Finally the Jewish population still used Hebrew alongside Arabic. Having no special regard for the Arabic of the Quran, they wrote Arabic as they spoke it (while using the Hebrew script), so giving further evidence of the dialect of Arabic used in al-Andalus. The Christian, Jewish and Islamic societies were largely self-governing and had their own laws and judges. However, on many occasions there must have been a need for interpreters. At least one judge for the Christian community in Cordoba also served as their interpreter.5"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"THE TRANSLATING ACTIVITY IN MEDIEVAL SPAIN 1037 This multilingual society was inherited by the Christian rulers of Spain. One can see this by the number of legal documents in which both Arabic and Latin occur, the Arabic often being a translation or summary of the Latin text for the benefit of an Arabic-speaking plaintiff or defendant.6 Interpreters would have been present at the proceedings. Sometimes they translated the Latin into the Romance vernacular which would have been understood by both parties. For example, at the end of a Latin act issued by the archbishop of Toledo in 1178, there is a note in Arabic indicating that \"Jalid ben Solaiman ben Gasan ben Servando\" and \"Domingo Salwat\" had heard the archdeacon repeat in \"Roman\" the text of the act.7 The Muslim community (Mudejars) would continue to use Arabic script even when the Romance lan-guage became their mother tongue, so producing the literature known as aljam(a. Under Islamic domination several Latin texts were translated into Arabic, including a book on agriculture by Columella, a history by Orosius, a \"Roman book\" on astrology, and (apparently) Isidore's Etymologies.B Christians were responsible for making some of these translations, and a large number of works were translated into Arabic specifically for the 'Arabicised' element of the Christian community (though not exclusively, for Muslim scholars also refer to these texts). At least three versions of the Psalms were made, including a verse translation completed by l:laf~ al-Quti in 276/889, which was specifically meant to replace the inelegant prose ver-sion in circulation at the time. A church calendar was translated and com-bined with a distinctly Arabic division of the year based on the rising of twenty-eight constellations known as the \"lunar mansions'', resulting in the Calendar of Cordoba (357/967).9 Arabicised Christians (called Mozarabs by other Christians) continued to use Arabic under Christian domination and even into the 14th century. This is evident from the number of Latin manu-scripts, mainly of Christian content, with Arabic translations or glosses in them. The well-known Arabic-Latin/Latin-Arabic Leiden glossary was most likely written to enable a community whose first literary language was Arabic to understand the Latin rite of the Roman church.JO Occasionally Arabic glosses appear in scientific and philosophical works; fer example, in a copy of the medical encyclopaedia of Oribasius which was in the cathedral library of Chartres in the Middle Ages,11 and an 11 th-centu,-ry manuscript of Boethius's On Arithmetic in the monastery of Ripoll in Catalonia.12 This is significant, for Boethius's work was the most advanced text on arithmetic before the advent of Arabic learning, and Ripoll was the earliest centre outside al-Andalus to show the influence of this learning.13 The Mozarab (as he must have been) who wrote Arabic equivalents to Boethius's definitions of the five species of inequality in that Ripoll manu-script was familiar with the technical terms of Arabic mathematics.

The transmission of this culture and the in-formation that it imparted concerning Islamic Spain will be the focus of our attention in this article. II Before the days of mass education and universal literacy the ability to read and the possession of magical powers often merged in the popular imagina-tion. If the books were not directly concerned with the truths of religion, then the gift of understanding them was thought to be due to the inspiration of demons. Scholars who dealt with Islamic science were regarded with par-ticular suspicion. Gerbert d' Aurillac, one of the first Latin scholars to en-quire about Arabic science, according to a story current in the early 13th century, \"was the best necromancer in France, whom the demons of the air readily obeyed in all that he required of them by day and night, because of the great sacrifices he offered them.\"14 These demons taught him how to use an astrolabe. But to a certain extent the scholars themselves fitted this popular image. In our first encounters with the transmission of Arabic science we find the exact sciences inextricably mixed up with astrology and magic and their transmission hedged with language redolent of a mystery religion. The same scholar would see nothing incongruous in solving a quadratic equation one moment and predicting from the stars whether a man might be killed by fall-ing masonry the next: he might even make a talisman to prevent such a con-tingency. Thus Adelard of Bath, the early 12th-century English Arabist, translated the raw materials of mathematics-Euclid's Elements and al-Khwarlzmi's astronomical tables-and also provided versions of an intro-duction to astrology, a set of astrological aphorisms and a work on making talismans which includes prayers to mice, bidding them to leave a property, and a method for driving scorpions out of his city of Bath.15 When we turn to the situation in al-Andalus we find scholars associated with both the exact sciences and magic. One of these was Adelard's main authority for the astrolabe, Maslama al-Majriti (ca. 400/1000). It was his revision of the tables of al-Khwarizmi for the meridian of C6rdoba that Adelard had translated, and his text on the astrolabe on whose Latin transla-tion Adelard based his own work On how to use the Astrolabe. Yet, from an early date, a comprehensive text on magic (Ghayat al-]Jak1m) and another on alchemy (Rutbat al-}Jakim) were ascribed to Maslama. Moreover Maslama introduced to al-Andalus the Letters of the Brethren of Purity which are heavily imbued with neo-Platonic and Hermetic religio-philosophical ideas, and imply a kind of intellectual brotherhood.16 The earliest translations from Arabic are in the fields of divination and astrology and those parts of mathematics which prepare the student for these"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"THE TRANSLATING ACTIVITY IN MEDIEVAL SPAIN 1039 subjects, such as geometry and astronomy. Western visitors to Muslim towns may have come across crude versions of these techniques. Michael Scot refers to skilled women in the streets and alleys of Tunis who invite newly arrived merchants to ask about their situation, their families and the outcome of their business dealings.17 Adelard of Bath and his \"nephew\" had spent a few days with an old sorceress (anus praestigiosa) learning how to perform incantations.ts Others may have been shown or offered an astrolabe. If the \"Carolingian\" astrolabe described by Destombes is genuine, the artefact may have paved the way for the Latin texts describing its construction and use.19 Divinatory techniques could have been picked up from Arabs by example rather than through texts. For instance, one could learn how to cast lines of dots randomly on the ground and join them together in pairs in order to form the figures used in \"the science of the sand\", which became known by the literary Latin term \"geomancy\".20 Or one could learn how to turn.the letters of the names of each of two protagonists in a battle or a contest into num-bers, to determine which of them would win.21 Or one could learn how to find out hidden things or predict the future by observing various marks on the shoulder-blade of a sheep which had been slaughtered and boiled until the flesh had fallen from the bone.22 Most of these techniques could be learnt with the aid of a good memory or, at most, a sheet of parchment giving the names and meanings of the sixteen geomantic figures, a list of the number-letter equivalents, or a plan of the shoulder-blade with the significations of each of its areas written in. At some stage, however, more detailed explanations were written down. Our earliest Latin text containing information from Arabic sources happens to be of this kind. It was written in the late 10th century, and is known variously as Liber A/chandrei, Mathematica Alhandrei summi astrologi, and Mathematica Alexandri summi astrologi--all these names implying some connection with Alexander the Great of Macedon. 23 A large part of this text consists of \"interrogations\" posed by the client and \"judgements\" given by the astrologer on matters of every-day concern, such as marriage, business dealings, the sex of one's unborn child and the outcome of an illness. The judgement is found by applying to the celestial \"places\" a number derived from the names of the client and of his mother. This form of judgement is distinctly Arabic, and survives to this day in North Africa.24 The Arabic ori-gin of the text is made explicit by references to \"Saraceni\" and \"the Arabic language\". The text includes the earliest Latin form of twenty-eight lunar mansions whose appearance in the Calendar of C6rdoba has already been mentioned. In fact, the two texts may be contemporary. The Liber Alchan-drei recalls the polyglot atmosphere of the capital of al-Andalus, for it in-cludes, alongside Arabic names for the zodiac signs and the planets, Hebrew names for the same terms and for the letters in which the names of the client and his mother must be written, and a letter of Petosiris to Nechepso which IV"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"IV 1040 was probably translated from Greek in the late Classical period and part of the surviving Latin culture in Spain. The earliest manuscript of the Liber Alchandrei closes with several circu-lar diagrams which show the names of the twenty-eight lunar mansions, their constellations and the number-letter equivalents used in making astrological judgements.25 The numbers here are written in Roman numerals, but in an Italian manuscript of medical works similar circular diagrams are filled with the forms of Arabic numerals which are found on the counters of the abacus associated with Gerbert d' Aurillac.26 Richard Lemay has pointed out that Arabic numerals (which technically should be called \"Indian\" numerals, and were so called by the Arabs) were used in very restricted contexts in the Islamic world in the Middle Ages. One of these contexts was precisely the form of divination in which numbers were substituted for letters.27 The Western equivalents of the \"Indian\" numerals are the ghubar (\"dust\") numerals which appear to have originated in Spain since the forms of 5, 6, and 8 are derivable from Visigothic script. Ibn Khaldfm in the 8th/14th cen-tury states that the \"ghubar letters\" are used for the za'iraja, or magical circle made up of all kinds of letters and numbers.28 There is, on the other hand, no evidence that Arabic merchants or administrators in Spain made use of ghubar numerals.29 It is possible that Gerbert, or one of his followers, got the idea of marking the abacus counters with Arabic numerals from a magical or divina-tory context in which numbers were used as ciphers, as they are in the Latin medical manuscript. The earliest Latin texts on the abacus do not depend on Arabic texts, but the names of the nine different counters which represented the nine digits appear to be Arabic and Berber words for the numerals in distorted forms which suggest an oral transmission.30 This Gerbertian abacus was popular throughout Western Europe during the Uth and early 12th century. It was a teaching tool, enabling students to see how numbers functioned. It was impractical as a calculating instrument for real-life transactions, and was probably never used as such. It was the means, however, by which many European scholars first became aware of Arabic ghubiir numerals and some of their Arabic names, and, at least for the Abbot of Malmesbury, the instru-ment itself had been \"snatched from the Saracens\".31 Towards the middle of the 6th/12th century the abacus began to be replaced by a method of calculation with Arabic numerals not marked on counters but written directly on a board thinly covered with sand, or on parch-ment. This was the algorism, in which the same Arabic ghubar numerals were used, and which had been taken, along with the method of calculation, from a single text by al-Khwarizmi-his On Indian Calculation.32 Arabic numerals did not cease to have a magical aura; in fact they continued for some centuries to be regarded as a secret code and edicts proscribing their use were promulgated in several cities.33"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"THE TRANSLATING ACTIVITY IN MEDIEVAL SPAIN 1041 The introduction of the algorism is symptomatic of the change in the pro-cess of transmission of Arabic science in the 6th/12th century. The transmis-sion acquires a firm literary basis. This is hinted at in the injunction of Ibn <Abdun, the jurist writing in Seville in the early years of the century, who forbids the selling of books to Jews and Christians, because they translate them and pass them off as their own compositions.34 III One of the earliest of these translators was Hugo of Santana working in the 12th century in Aragon. He dedicated all the works that have dedications to Michael, bishop of Tarazona from the time of its reconquest (513/1119) until 1151. A near Arabic neighbour of bishop Michael was the last of the Banu Hud dynasty of Saragossa, Sayf al-Dawla. After the fall of Saragossa to the Christians in 512/1118 the Banu Hud took up residence in Rueda de Jal6n, some 55 kilometres from Tarazona. Sayf al-Dawla himself established quite friendly relations with the king of Aragon, Alfonso VII, whose coronation as Emperor he attended. In 534/1140 or 535/1141 he was obliged to relinquish Rueda de Jal6n in exchange for some lands near 'lioledo.35 What is interest-ing is that he had a library from which bishop Michael was able to choose some works for Hugo to translate.36 The Banu Hud had a reputation for their patronage of learning. Both the botanist Ibn Biklarish and the philosopher lbn Ba.ija (Avempace) were in Saragossa. Two members of the dynasty themselves achieved reputations for their remarkable mathematical talents: AJ:)mad al-Muqtadir bi-llah (who ruled from 438/1046 to 474/1081) and his son Yusuf al-Mu,taman b. Hud (474/1081-478/1085).37 The latter composed a truly comprehensive book on geometry known as \"The Perfection\" (Al-lstikmii/), which drew on a large number of sources, including Euclid's Elements and Data, the Spherics of Theodosius and Menelaus, the Conics of Apollonius, Archimedes' On the Sphere and Cylinder, Eutocius's commentary on this work, Ihahil b. Qwn's treatise on amicable numbers and lbn al-Haytbam's Optics. Prob-ably during the reign of A~mad al-Muqtadir bi-llah, whose renown extended to astronomy and philosophy, a pupil of Maslama al-Majriti called al-Kirmani (died 457/1065) introduced the Letters of the Brethren of Purity into Saragossa.JS Perhaps he too brought Maslama's revision of the tables of al-Khwarizmi from C6rdoba to Saragossa, for the lunar visibility tables that survive in Latin only have been recomputed for a latitude which is that of Saragossa. 39 Some idea of which texts remained in the library of the Banu Hud when they moved to Rueda de Jal6n can be gauged from the evidence of Hugo's translations. In only one preface does he mention this library (armarium Rotense), but that is precisely his preface to a commentary on the tables of IV"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"IV 1042 al-Khwarizmi which must have been known in Saragossa (it was also trans-lated by Abraham b. Ezra, a Jewish scholar from neighbouring Tudela).40 Hugo goes on to write that the manuscript was found \"among the more secret depths of the library\" (inter secretiora bibliotece penetralia). This sug-gests a part of the library specially designated for the non-Muslim sciences and magic. One hundred years later the French bibliophile, Richard of Fournival, \"kept his 'secret texts' (tractatus secreti) on astrology, alchemy, and magic in a separate room to which, he claims, only he had access\".41 Hugo certainly wishes to foster the impression that he is passing on secret knowledge which must not be divulged to other than worthy individuals. Like his predecessor in Southern Italy, the translator Constantine of Africa, Hugo subsumes his Arabic author's preface into his own preface, so that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the words of his source from his own words, where the Arabic origin is unavailable for comparison.42 But it is apparent that he is in agreement with the tone of his Arabic authors. In the preface to a large book on horoscopic astrology Hugo, following his source, lists some 125 astrological books, whose gist is preserved in two com-prehensive volumes. These, we read, \"were placed in the hands of a certain wise and most dependable man (for no access to them was allowed to any unworthy or foolish person); thus neither the translation of these books nor their teaching is further granted either to us or to anyone of this generation except to one who is endowed with complete honesty and philosophical understanding\".43 These are the books whose secret the Arabic author un-locks and Hugo, in turn, reveals to the Latin world. In his preface to Pseudo-Ptolemy's Centiloquium (astrological aphorisms), Hugo exhorts Michael \"not to commit the secrets of such wisdom (tante sapiencie archana) into the hands of any unworthy individual, or to allow anyone to share in the secrets who rejoices in the number of his books rather than delights in their teaching\".44 Again, in another preface, he says he has tried to find amongst the Arabs the four species of divination mentioned (and, incidentally, condemned) by Isidore of Seville: divination respectively by earth, water, air and fire. In encountering the Arabic \"science of the sand\" he thought he had discovered Isidore's geomancy (\"earth-divination\"), and he promises to find and to translate texts on the the other \"mancies\".45 But secrets could also be found in the shoulder-blades of sheep for (as we read in Hugo's preface to one of his two translations of an Arabic text on scapu-limancy-a preface which incorporates Arabic material) \"the rain brings down the secret (archanum) of God's teaching and an interior power into the very plants and herbs of the earth, like the manna of God's own grace and wisdom, and this secret is transferred to the shoulder...,blades of the sheep eating this grass\".46 Hugo's interest in secrets and \"mancies\" suggests more than idle curiosi-ty; he seems to believe (or at least acquiesce to beliefs stated in his sources)"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"THE TRANSLATING ACTIVITY IN MEDIEVAL SPAIN 1043 in the secret society of an intellectual elite . This belief is most fully stated in the preface to the text on geomancy where we read: God the Creator of things, who founded everything as a new creation without an exemplar, deciding in his mind about the future state of things before their actual coming-into-being, disbibutes to each man as He wishes what he thinks it right to bestow upon the rational creature from the treasury of His whole being. Hence all created beings, whether rational or irrational or inanimate, show the same obe-dieoce to Him, and, although in their lives they have descended to the rank of mortal beings, they venerate Him as a result of unity alone. Holding all things in the form of images before they come into being, He pours a kind of intuitive and intellectual notion of them into the secret place [arcanum] of men's hearts. Eventually such a state of creation comes into being that God is able to associate by a kind of bond the foremost and most venerable teachers ... so that all discord having been put aside, the rational or \"positive justice\" can join them together through an equable bond. 47 The high-flown language is difficult to follow, but we have here a picture of a special bond between men who have been privileged to receive God's gift of intuitive knowledge. This bond which produces a state of peace in human society is parallel to the bonds which govern and preserve the universe. It is to this latter topic that Hugo's most interesting translation is devoted. This is the Secret of Creation of Pseudo-Apollonius, which purports to be Hermes Trismegistus's account of God's creation of the world, and of the origins of minerals, plants, animals and men. Throughout the work there is an emphasis on the idea of an underlying unity in nature and of bonds connecting every level of creation. For all things derive from one substance and one seed. This philosophy is epitomised in the document known as the Emerald Tablet which became the credo of the alchemists and of which the earliest known Latin version is within Hugo's translation of the Secret of Creation.48 Hugo's text is closest to an Arabic manuscript copied in 485/1092, an-other Arabic copy of which is still in Spain.49 We have no independent Arabic testimony that the Secret of Creation was in the library of the Banii Hiid, but it is worth noting that the text comes from the same milieu and shares some of the same Hermetic and neo-Platonic sources as the Letters of the Brethren of Purity which were in Saragossa.so In tum, we have no translation of the Letters attributed to Hugo. However, there are anonymous Latin translations of at least two of these letters,s1 and further evidence may eventually be found of their influence on Latin scholars in the North of Spain. IV Not far from Tarazona was Tudela on the river Ebro. This town had im-portant Jewish and Muslim communities and was the home of the Jewish scholars Abraham b.

Hermann knew several of the same sources as Hugo, and perhaps also had access to the library of the Banii Hiid. For he knows the works of Theodosius and Archimedes, and made versions of Euclid's Elements and al-Khwarizmi's astronomical tables, all of which were apparently in the Banii Hiid's possession. In his major ori-ginal work, the cosmogony called On the Essences (De essentiis), Hermann cites the Emerald Tablet from the Secret of Creation (he is the only Latin scholar besides Hugo who appears to know the latter work), and refers to several other Hermetic works.54 However, in the preface to On the Essences, which is addressed to Robert, he makes a significant contrast between the \"secrets\" (secreta) and the \"public schools\". Robert and he have been labour-ing together night and day on the \"intimate treasures of the Arabs\" (intimi Arabum thesauri) in the \"inner sanctuaries of Minerva\" (adyta Minerve), and Hermann is now considering whether it is appropriate to make the fruits of their research public. He is afraid of committing the crime of Numenius, who divulged the Eleusinian mysteries and consequently saw the Eleusinian god-desses in a dream dressed as prostitutes available for use to all and sundry. In Hermann's case the Goddess Minerva reassures him-also in a dream-that her attributes are not diminished by being made freely available and should be given out liberally.55 Whether Hermann's decision to make public the secrets of Arabic science represents a change of policy from that of Hugo depends on how much trust we place in the literary style adopted in these translators' prefaces. It is a fact that Hugo's translations had a very limited diffusion. Hermann and Robert, on the other hand, advertised their work to the highest European authorities of the time. Robert promises to Peter the Venerable, abbot of Cluny, who was responsible for promoting the Cluniac reform of the Christian church in Spain, \"a celestial gift which embraces within itself the whole of science\" -i.e., a work on astronomy, whereas Hermann sent one of his translations (that of Ptolemy's Planisphere) to Thierry of Chartres, the foremost educator in France of the second quarter of the 12th century. In the preface to this translation Hermann sketches a history of astronomy, refers to the basic text-books on the subject, and advertises three of his own works, and one of Robert's.56 Thierry was engaged in compiling an annotated \"library'' of texts on the seven liberal arts, and included two translations from Arabic, which may be in Robert and Hermann's versions. 57 A decade or two after Robert and Hermann's project to translate and send to France texts on geometry and astronomy, an even more comprehensive programme of translations was planned and undertaken, this time in Toledo. The motive force for this programme seems to have been an archdeacon resi-dent in Toledo called Dominicus Gundissalinus. Perhaps in reaction to the idea of a secret intellectual elite, Dominicus considers that it is no longer"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"THE TRANSLATING ACTIVITY IN MEDIEVAL SPAIN 1045 possible to be a sage (sapiens); one can only aspire to be proficient in certain sciences, or at least to know something about a few of them.SB To facilitate this he describes each of the sciences in turn in his On the Sciences, drawing largely on the translation of al-Farabi's Classification of the Sciences made by Gerard of Cremona. It is reasonably certain now that Gerard of Cremona worked closely with Dominicus. He is probably to be identified with a \"Girardus\" described as a deacon in a document of the Cathedral of Toledo of l 1 March 1162, and as \"Girardus called master\" (Girardus dictus magister) in two later documents of the Cathedral (March 1174 and March 1176). All three documents are also signed by Dominicus.59 Al-Farabi's Classification of the Sciences pro-vided a template for Gerard on which to pattern the programme of his own translations, several of which were used in turn by Dominicus when he ad-apted al-Farabi's text into a comprehensive account of philosophy and its parts-On the Division of Philosophy-patterned on schemata developed by Thierry of Chartres and his pupils;60 With Dominicus and Gerard of Cremo-na we see not only a high public profile given to translations from Arabic, but also an expansion of the range of texts into medicine and philosophy. Gerard translated several of Aristotle's works and some commentaries on Aristotle by Arabic authors or Greek commentators whose work had been translated into Arabic.61 On the other hand, Dominicus and his associates Avendauth and Johannes Hispanus translated the works of Arab and Jewish scholars who had summarised and reinterpreted Aristotle's philosophy in the light of neo-Platonic trends-Le., Ibn Sina, Ibn Gabirol and al-G.bazali.62 The advertisements of Robert of Ketton and Hermann of Carinthia were clearly effective. John of Salisbury regarded the Arabs as being more ad-vanced than the Latins in geometry and astronomy.63 Toledo was the natural place where this Arabi« learning could be found. Gerard of Cremona had been attracted to Toledo because of his desire for Ptolemy's Almagest, the 2nd-century A.O. textbook on astronomy. Another scholar, Daniel of Morley, tells a more detailed story about how he came to Toledo. He had at first left England to seek learning in Paris, but, disappointed by what he found there and hearing that \"the learning of the Arabs\" (doctrina Arabum), which con-sisted almost entirely of the scientific works he was interested in, was in vogue in Toledo, he hurried there, and was not disappointed. He recounts a lecture given by Gerard, on astrology.64 v Gerard of Cremona died in 1187. At his death his pupils (socii) drew up a list of his many translations from Arabic, since he had been too humble to put his name to many of them. 65 These soc ii could have included Dominicus and Johannes Hispanus, for the former was still alive in 1181 (and there is no evidence that he died soon after this), and the latter lived until 1215. IV"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"IV 1046 The 7th/13th century witnessed a continuation of the translating activity. Two conspicuous elements about this activity should be noted: first, the trans-mission of the results of the last flowering of philosophy in Islamic Spain; and second, the rise of \"official translation'\\ i.e., translation as part of public policy, either to aggrandise the newly emerging Spanish nation, or to convert the Muslim. To turn to the first of these: Under the Almohads there occurred an Indian summer for philosophy in Islamic Spain. This took the form of a burst of ''fundamentalist\" Aristotelianism unparalleled elsewhere in the Arabic word. 66 The central figure is Ibn Tufayl (d. 581/1185), the court physician of the Al-mohad leader in C6rdoba and the composer of the philosophical novel Jjayy b. Yaq1an-the story of an orphan on a desert island who discovers the truths of philosophy and religion entirely by a process of deduction. Ibn Tufayl had introduced to the Almohad ruler the philosopher Ibn Ru5hd (Averroes, d. 594/1198), and inspired al-Bitrfiji (Alpetragius) to write his book on astronomy. This book, On the Movements of the Heavens (written ca. 600/1200), was a revolutionary attempt to replace Ptolemy's astrono-mical system with a model which was compatible with Aristotelian physics. Averroes in his turn undertook the most ambitious project ever conceived for interpreting Aristotle: three levels of commentaries for the whole of Aris-totle's works, to which a commentary on Plato's Republic was added. These consisted of: a) summaries of the texts; b) paraphrases; and c) line by line exegeses. 67 Andalusi Aristotelianism appears to have had little influence on subse-quent Arabic scholarship. Its influence on Latin and Hebrew philosophy and science was, on the other hand, immense. It was in this intellectual climate at C6rdoba that the philosophy of Maimonides (d. 600/1204) was formed. And within a few years of their composition the works of both al-Bitrfiji and Ibn Rushd were being translated into Latin and Hebrew. The first translations were made in Spain. Michael Scot translated On the Movements of the Heavens in Toledo in 1217, five years after the defeat of the Almohads in the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. To Michael Scot are also attributed the earliest translations of Averroes, which he probably began in Spain, and con-tinued when he moved to Italy in the 1220s.68 The radical nature of this new Aristotelianism and its origin in Spain is indicated by the extreme reaction that it provoked in Paris-in particular, the prohibition promulgated in the University of Paris in 1215 against Aristotle's works on metaphysics and natural science, the summae of these works (i.e., presumably, the works of Avicenna and Averroes) and the writings of \"Mauritius Hispanus\", amongst others.69 The most plausible explanation of the identity of the latter is that he is Mauritius, archdeacon of Toledo, who sponsored translations of other texts of the Almohads, as we shall see.70"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"THE TRANSLATING ACTIVITY IN MEDIEVAL SPAIN 1047 The continuation of interest in Aristotelianism in Christian Spain in the 13th century has not yet been explored by scholars, but is evident from the following facts: Alvaro of Toledo (floruit 1267 until after 1286) copied out Michael Scot's translation of al-Bitfiiji's On the Movements of the Heavens and wrote a commentary on Averroes' On the Substance of the Globe. He dedicated the latter to the Archbishop of Toledo, Gonzalo Garcia Gudiel, * who himself had collected several manuscripts of the works of Aristotle, Avicenna and Averroes by 1273.71 The archbishop commissioned a transla-tion of those books on natural science in Avicenna's Shifil' which had not been translated by Dominicus Gundissalinus. n With Garcia Gudiel we come to the very end of the 13th century. If we retrace our steps we can follow the course of \"official translations\" through the century. The battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (609/1212) and the subse-quent capture of Seville and C6rdoba, leaving as the only Islamic kingdom in Spain the vassal state of Granada, gave the Christian bishops and kings a great feeling of confidence. We see at least one archbishop and two kings who produce texts in their own names to further the Hispanicisation and Christianisation of the Iberian Peninsula. 73 Rodrigo Jimenez de Rada, Archbishop of Toledo from 1210 to 1247, wrote the Historia Gothica and the Historia Arabwn, both of which rely heavily on Arabic sources.74 A canon in his cathedral called Mark was asked by his archdeacon, Mauritius (mentioned above), to translate the Quran and the Profession of Faith of the founder of the Almohad movement.75 James the Conqueror, king of Catalonia (d. 1276) was more a warrior than a cultur-al hero, and added Valencia, Murcia and the Balearic Islands to the kingdom of Catalonia. But he also wrote a unique biography, in Catalan-the Llibre dels f eyts-and set up a school for training missionaries. 76 The-most remarkable instance, however, is of course that of Alfonso X, \"el Sabio\", king of Le6n and Castile from 1252 until 1284.77 His nationalism is evident in his great law-codes and histories (of Spain and of the world), which build on the earlier histories of Rodrigo Jimenez and even on the Islamic literature translated by Hermann of Carinthia and Robert of Ketton. Above all, it is evidenced by the fact that he chose to use Castilian as the literary language of his court. He was not so interested in Aristotle, but spon-sored the translation of texts on magic, the science of the stars, entertaining stories, and games (including chess, draughts and backgammon). Not only was the language of these translations Spanish, but also he made it seem that the authors themselves were Spanish, calling for example the author of the G_hayat al-/:lakim, \"Picatrix Hispanus\".78 Of course, in a way, they were. The author of Ghayat al-/:lakim, though not Maslama al-Majriti himself, lived in al-Andalus in the 5th/11th century. One or two of the texts on the science of the stars appear to have been written by the translators themselves. The IV"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"IV 1048 absence of any Muslim involvement in the translations is notable. Most of Alfonso's translators were Jews, and those who were not Jews were Christians who sometimes translated the Castilian text into Latin. VI What could Europeans learn of Islamic Spain from these translations? It must be said, first of all, that works on philosophy and the exact sciences are not likely to give much information about the society in which they were written. However, an informative introduction to the Islamic religion itself could be gained from reading the texts that Peter the Venerable commis-sioned in the 1140s from Hermann of Carinthia, Robert of Kelton and Peter of Toledo. These were all translations of Arabic texts on Islam, and included the Quran, a life of Muf:iammad, a history of the world from the Islamic point of view from the Creation to the time of the Prophet, an account of the early caliphs, and a debate between a Muslim and a Christian.79 For all the extremely negative attitude towards Islam shown by Robert of Kelton in his prefaces, the translations themselves are quite faithful to their originals. Peter the Venerable had attached to his team of translators a Mus-lim called Muf:iammad, presumably to help in matters of doctrine. The trans-lator of the debate between the Muslim and the Christian (the Apology of al-Kindi), even left in a sentence in which the caliph al-Ma,mun, the judge of the debate, comes down in favour of the Muslim.so He considered Chris-tianity to be a religion for enjoying life in the world to come, whereas Islam enabled one to enjoy both this world and the next. Unfortunately an early editor of the Latin text erased this approbation of Islam which, consequently. is not found in later manuscripts. Nevertheless the \"Toledan collection\", as the works commissioned by Peter the Venerable are called, remained a valu-able dossier for Westerners wishing to understand Islam. In the 17th century Robert of Kellon• s translation of the Quran was still being used by Christian missionaries, and the Apology of al-Kindi has become popular in modern times at the interface of Islam and Christianity in North Africa.s1 Other sources for gaining knowledge of Spanish Islamic society are the works of astrology and divination. Richard Lemay has pointed out that in some manuscripts of John of Seville's translation (529/1135) of Abu Ma csbar's * Greater Introduction to Astrology (235/849) there are annotations explaining some of the terms used, including: \"Note that Abu Macs.bar calls 'aldea' the habitations (villulae) in which the more noble of the Arabs dwell, i.e., the places of tents, since noble Arabs always dwell in tents and not in cities\"; the same annotator interprets \"cities and halls\" (civitates et aulas) as alcasares (the Spanish word from al-qa1r. \"castle\").82 Associated with astronomical tables in two manuscripts of the 6th/12th century is a bilingual Arabic-Latin fortune-telling table which indicates the"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"THE TRANSLATING ACTIVITY IN MEDIEVAL SPAIN 1049 activity someone should be engaging in depending on the sign of the zodiac in which each of the planets is situated.83 The activities are all pleasant and presumably recall the recreations of a leisured inhabitant of al-Andalus: e.g., hearing or playing musical instruments (including the rabilb, the shawm, the horn, various kinds of drum, and singing), riding through beautiful places, resting in the shade, buying or building a house or guest-quarters, decorating a reception room, buying slippers, smelling roses or irises, entering a bath, wearing multi-coloured clothing or silks or brocade or a long-sleeved gown, hunting ducks or hares and hunting with a falcon, playing with a girl, drink-ing by a river (either grape-wine-khamr, or date-wine---nabidb), and final-ly eating all kinds of delicious food. These include lamb, chicken, a young dove, partridges, thrushes, dates, a pie made of borage, a cake (~lwii), auber-gines, artichokes, dill, tafiiyii (interpreted in Latin as \"meat with coriander\") and mushrooms.84 Other astrological works refer to the best time to learn to play the \"lyre\" (presumably the 'ud), the drum (fanbur) and trumpets,85 and give advice on digging irrigation ditches, which includes descriptions of the maduf (trans-lated as \"stork\" in Latin}, the saniya or \"water scoop\", and the niYura or water-wheel: In digging beds for irrigation channels, let the Moon be in a good position ... [If all this is done] hindrance from digging the channel is avoided and the abundance and the salubrity of the water is assured ... In making certain machines which are accustomed to be used by certain peoples for drawing up water, and which, because of their appearance, they call in the vernacular [ vulgari nomine] \"storks\", let the Ascendent and the Cardines be firm . . . For the manufacture of wheels which the Arabs call azeniae or annorae the aforesaid method for wells should be followed. Both machines are useful for drawing forth water for irrigating fields. 86 More immediately relevant to Islamic Spain are the texts on divination by sheeps' shoulder-blades.87 These seem to have been elaborated on Spanish soil. For in both Arabic and Latin texts there are references to Cordoba, Saragossa and other capitals of the fii'ifa kingdoms of al-Andalus. In one Arabic text the two main divisions of the Arabs in Spain-the family of Fihr and the family of Marwan-are mentioned. In both an Arabic and a Latin text the tribal divisions of the Berbers-the Butr and Baranis-are also named. The texts give intimate details of family life, indicating whether the husband will dominate his wife or vice versa, how many servants there are in the house and whether they are black, Arabs or Christians, and have straight or curly hair. Latin-reading Europeans, however, did not read these texts in order to find out more about Islamic Spain. They were interested in the texts for prac-tical purposes or for making progress in mathematics or philosophy. The Arabs were not mere conduits of Ancient Greek learning. Admittedly, trans-lators were searching out Ancient Greek works and occasionally complained IV"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"IV 1050 when they could only find an Arabic translation of a Greek work.SS Gerard of Cremona, Robert of Ketton and Hermann of Carinthia were all aiming for the Almagest of Ptolemy, Constantine of Africa wanted to introduce to the Latins Galen and Hippocrates. But it was acknowledged that scholars writ-ing in Arabic had developed, added to, or made more accessible, the texts of Antiquity. Understanding the Almagest may have been the aim of every aspiring astronomer, but most scholars in the Middle Ages, including Dante, found it easier to use the shorter Elements of Astronomy of al-Fargba.ru.89 Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos was regarded as the fountainhead of teaching on astrology; yet the works of Abfi Ma'shar and al-Qabi~i were much more fre-* quently copied and cited.90 Avicenna's Sufficiency (S!Jija>), as its title im-plied, provided a full curriculum in philosophy and, partly because it gave clear-cut answers rather than left questions hanging in the air, it was easier to manage than the several books of Aristotle's philosophy and was con-sequently popular. Averroes, on the oth,er hand, with his three tiers of com-mentary to each of Aristotle's works, provided a thorough-going method for a detailed study of Aristotle and a model for Latin commentaries from the mid-7th/13th century onwards.91 A mark of his success is the fact that a far greater number of his commentaries survive in Latin than in the original Arabic.92 The Arabs of the Middle Ages seem to have had a special flair for mathe-matics, and the Latin translations in this field provide only a dim reflection of the true splendour of the achievements of men like al-Mu>taman b. Hud or Omar Khayyam.93 The translations did, however, introduce into the West calculation with Arabic numerals, algebra, trigonometry and advanced geo-metry. In medicine, above all, Arabic works held sway in the Middle Ages. One need only mention the names which became familiar in the Latin forms of Avicenna (this time as author of the Canon of Medicine), Rhazes, Mesue, Isaac, and Abulcasim.94 Most of these texts had originally been translated in Spain.95 Many of them had been written by Muslims (or, to a lesser extent, Christians or Jews) resident in Spain. We have already mentioned Maslama al-Majrip, al-Biμ-uji, Averroes, and lbn Bajja, the last of whose views were known through the commentaries of Averroes. But there were others, such as 'Arib b. Sa(d, who contributed to the composition of the Calendar of Cordoba, Abraham bar J:Iiyya (d. c. 531/1136), the author of a book on trigonometry translated by Plato of Tivoli under the title Liber embadorum (\"Book of areas\"),96 the 5th/11th-century mathematician and astronomer lbn Mu'adb of Jaen whose works on atmospheric refraction (De crepusculis) and Tables of Jaen were translated by Gerard of Cremona,97 and lbn al-Zarqalluh whose astronomical tables composed for Toledo in ca. 462/1070 became the standard tables in use in Latin translation in the West between the late 12th and early 14th cen-turies.98 But Arabic texts also arrived in al-Andalus from the furthest parts of"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"THE TRANSLATING ACTIVITY IN MEDIEVAL SPAIN 1051 the Islamic world, and this, in itself, testifies to the brilliance of the academic society in Islamic Spain. Adelard of Bath had regarded Arabic learning as synonymous with rational thought.99 What Hugo of Santalla said of his own subject would have been echoed by many of his fellow Latins concerning other subjects: It befits us to imitate the Arabs especially. for they are as it were our teachers and precursors in this art.100 J For general accounts of the translation process see M.·T. d' Alvemy, \"Translations and Translators\", in Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century, ed.

He taught alchemy and passed on his wisdom to Asclepius. This third Hermes corresponds to the Hermes of the Corpus Hermeticum. z Three centuries after the death of Abu Ma'shar the legend appears in three related prologues to Latin works purporting to be retailing the antediluvian wisdom of the Hermetic tradition. 3 The Hermes have been accommodated to Old Testament history, and the second Hermes has become Noah, but the story bears an obvious relation to Abu Ma 'shar's version and is associated with alchemical works of Arabic origin. The story appears in its least adulterated form in the • I am grateful to Mr. Peter Dronke of Clare Hall, Cambridge; and to Professor D.

T. Silverstein, Archives d'hirtoir, doctrinale et littJraire d1l Mo.Jen .Age, xiii, 1955, pp. 217-302). Plessner ('Hirmis', p. 464) relates Ruska's texts to Abu Ma'shar's legend. The legend seems to have passed from ii to i (as Ruska shows) to iii (in which the work of Moricnus is mentioned). The dates and authorship of these prol~ues are still in doubt, but it is tempting to maintain, m some way, the traditional association of i with the Robert of Kctton (sometimes known as 'Castrcnsis') who was a dose friend of Hermann of Carinthia (see below), and to whom Her-mann dedicated the De Essentiis and his translation of Abu Ma'shar's 'Greater Introduction'. translator's prologue to the Septem tractatus Hermetis sapientia triplicis: In historiis divinarum rerum, tres prae-claros viros philosophos, quemlibet vocatum Hermetem, legimus. Horum primus Enoch ante diluvium fuit, qui angelis comi tantihus, igneo curru in coelum abiit. Secundus autem Noe, qui in archa, Dei iussu, a diluvio multarum aquarum salvus evasit. Eorum enim al-teruter alio nomine Hermes, alio nomine vocatus est Mercurius, ad differentiam Hermetis, qui post diluvium regnavit in Aegypto. Hie enim tertius clarissimus vir, qui regali diademate decoratus, diu rex Aegypto imperavit, a trina virtute Ter magnus dictus est. Ipsum namque ferunt Regem, Philosophum, atque Prophetam fuisse, qui et totius liberalis mechanicaeque disciplinae inventor fertur extitisse. In the thirteenth century Abu Ma'shar himself is still referred to as an authority on the 'second Hermes' by the author of the Summa Philosophiae of ps.-Grosseteste. In this Summa we read that the second Hermes was the nephew of the first, Egyptian, Hermes, and 'as Abu Ma'shar witnesses' inter alia an astrologer and alchemist.' Since Abu Ma'shar's legend was fre-quently excerpted from the Kitab al-Vliif in later Arabic works, it is probable that, even before it reached the Latin world, it had gained a currency independent of its source. There are, however, two references to the Kitab al-Uliif itself in a Latin work of the twelfth century, which have not, so far as I know, received any comment, but which could suggest a direct knowledge of the work by at least one Latin writer, and might pro-vide a clue to the diffusion of its doctrine in the West. This Latin source is the De Essentiis, written 'Summa PhilosophifJe, ed. L.

Nam iuxta eos qui centenis annis [gradibus MSS), vel multo amplius-qui videlicet annum ver-tentem annis solaribus 36,000 metiuntur, tertium scilicet inter 4 mundi circuitus quos Abumaixar fi Kiteb ululuf in iudicia seculi metitur. (And by this method the measurement of the [distances of the planets] lying in between can also be readily calculated by comparing the ratios of their orbits, until finally from Saturn to the eighth sphere the distance will stand at 366 times as much as the distance of Saturn from the centre of the earth-that is, according to those who bring the eighth sphere through one degree every 66 years; but the distance will be much greater if one follows those who [bring the eighth sphere through one degree] every 100 years-i.e. those people who measure the Great Year at 36,000 solar years, which is the third of the four orbits of the universe which Abu Ma'shar measures for the purpose of predicting mundane events in the Kitiib al-Ul~f )6 s The most succinct and reliable account of Hermann of Carinthia and his writings is still that of Haskins (C. H. Haskins, Studies in the History of Mediaeval Science, 2nd edn., New York 1927, pp. 43-66). I am preparing a new edition of the De Essentiis (first edited from one manuscript alone, by M. Alonso, Miscelanea Comillas, v, 1946, pp. 7-107) which will include a revised biblio-sraphy of his works, and an account of his sources and ideas. Haskins makes no mention of the Kittib al-UJ14f, but Alonso refers the reader to J. Lippert, 'Abu Ma'far's Kitab al-Uluf', Vienna Oriental .Journal (conti-nued as Wiener<,eitschriftjuTdie Kunde des Morgenlandes), ix, 1895, pp. 351--8. • See Alonso ed., p. 56, for the context; for greater clarity I have substituted Arabic numerals for the Roman numerals of the manuscripts; all the manu-scripts have in libro millenario written above the Arabic words. Hermann appears to have arrived at '366 times' through a series of mathematical blunders, starting with a basic misapprehension that 'the ratio The meaning of the 'third of the four orbits' is explained a little further on, when Hermann is discussing the 'differences of time' which are astrologically operative. The celebris dif-ferences are those of the year, the month, and the day, determined by the sun, the moon, and the outermost (ninth) sphere, respec-tively. The probabilis differences are those determined by the circuits of the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. The 'necessary' difference is determined, above all, by the movement of all the planets and the fixed stars, and hence is related to precession (i.e. the very slow movement of the vernal point with respect to the fixed stars--explained, in the Ptolemaic system, as an eastward movement of the fixed stars, or eighth sphere), to which Hermann was also referring in the first passage: Necessariam Abumaixar in Libra Mil-lenario quadripartito subdividit, circulum totum imitatione quadrantium per 4 primos numerorum gradus multiplicans, computo ex prima celebris specie inducto-primam quidem numeral annis 360, secundam 3,600, tertiam 36,000, quartam 360,000. Nos tamen tertiam excipientes proprie et velut privilegio quodam 'neces-sitatis' vocabulo significari volumus-licet ceteris nequaquam immunibus. Si enim vel singuli quarumdam stellarum reditus certas temporis differentias metiuntur, quanta magis integrum et generalem omnium siderum et stellarum circuitum necessaria totius mundi novitas conse-quitur !

(Abu Ma'shar, in the Liber Millenarius, divides the 'necessary' difference into four, multiplying the whole circle by the first four degrees of numbers [i.e. powers of ten]-in imitation of the four quadrants-and beginning his calculation from the first kind of celebris difference [i.e. the number 365(360)): the first division he calculates at 360 years, the second, 3,600, the third 36,000, the fourth 3601000. We, however, take the third division, and wish that it should be to this that the term 'necessity' should be properly, and as if by a cer-tain privilege, applied-although [Abu Ma'shar's] other divisions are by no means without effect. For if the revolutions of the planets, even when taken individually, of diameters is half that of circumferences' (Alonso ed., P• 56)."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"v THREE HERMES AND ABU MA'SHAR 233 measure out certain differences of time, how much more will a necessary radical change to the whole universe follow one complete general revolution of all the planets and stars! From this scientists derive the floods and conflagrations of the universe.) 7 That Hermann refers to the Kitiib al-Uliif here is confirmed by al-Biruni's quotation of the same passage. 8 Neither do the three dif-ferences of time (celebris, probabilis, and neces-saria) derive from Abu Ma'shar, nor does the Arabic astrologer connect any of the divisions with the movement of the stars. Hermann seems to be aware of breaking new ground in his definition of the 'necessary' difference of time; and his innovation lies precisely in his blending of diverse traditions9-which is a notable characteristic of the De Essentiis as a whole. But what is especially interesting is that Hermann should use information from the Kitiib al-Ulitfat all. The work is no longer extant in full in Arabic, and our only testi-monies to it are the fragments and summaries in later Arabic works. Was a complete copy of the Kitiib available to Hermann? Do we know that the original existed in Spain in the twelfth century?10 Might the Latin title 7 See Alonso ed., p. 68. I Al-Biriini, Qanrin al-Mas'udi, iii, Hyderabad 1954-1956, pp. 1474-9, summarized in Pingree, Thousands, p. 59. Al-Biriini refers to the Kitab al-Uliif by name, and quotes the text in greater detail than Hermann, who mentions only the divisions whose Arabic name is the Tasyirat. For a clear account of the principle of Abu Ma'shar's divisions see E. S. Kennedy, 'Rami-fications of the World-Year Omcept in Islamic Astrology', Ithaca, Actes du rome. Congres international d'histcire de science, Paris 19611, pp. 23-45. • For the Great Year (magnus annus or annus vertens) Hermann's principal sources are Plato, Timaeus 39D; Cicero, Somnium Scipioni.r, 7; Macro bi us, Commentarii in Somnium Scipi,mis, ii.11.8-17 (see P. R. Coleman· Norton, 'Cicero's doctrine of the Great Year', Laval tMologique el phi{osophique, iii, 1947, pp. 293-302, and B. L. van der Waerden, 'Das Grosse Jahr und die ewige Wiederkehr', Hermes, bcxx, 1952, pp. 129-55). When it was related to any astronomical periodicity at all, the Great Year was equal to the lowest common mul-tiple of the periods of all the planets; with the discovery of precession, the revolution of the eighth sphere was included, and this, in itself, provided the r:riod of the Great Year. The inspiration of Hermanns ce{ebris and p,obabi{is differences is clearly Timaeus 39G-D; in using the word necessaria he may have been influenced by the connotation of 'destiny' in the Arabic word for 'division' (qisma) used by Abii Ma'shar in this context. •0 We know that in the eleventh century in Spain ~a'id al-Andalusi (1029-70) used the Kitab al-Ulrif as a source in his Kitab ,tabaqat al-umana (cf. Pingree, Thousands, p. 14). Pingree lists our testimonies to the Kitiib al-Ulqfon pp. 14, 21-27; none of the works men-tioned here lppears to have been known to Hermann. which Hermann gives the work in the second reference, imply that a Latin translation was made? The occurrence of the Arabic word Ji (meaning 'in') in Hermann's first reference to the Kitiib, suggests that he found the phrase 'Abu Ma'shar fI Kitab al-Uluf' intact in an Arabic secondary source. However, Hermann was, himself, very familiar with several works of Abu Ma'shar. He had translated the 'Greater Introduction to Astrology' (Kitiib al-madkhal al-kabir ilii 'ilm a}.ikiim an-nujiim) 11 and, in the De Essentiis, he refers to the Kitiib al-Qjriiniit, u and to his own translation of Abu Ma'shar's annales.13 He also says that he has used a set of astronomical tables by Abu Ma'shar, which seem to be the Zi.i al-Ha;:.iiriit; these give another part of the Persian doctrine found in the Kitiib al-Uluf.14 There appears to be no evidence that Abu Ma'shar himself quotes the Kitiib al-Uliif in any of these works, but it is quite likely that an Arabic manuscript would include this treatise alongside one or more of his other works. In general, Hermann follows Abu Ma 'shar's authority without question. He believes that astrology originated with the Indians, and migrated westwards via the Persians and the Arabs. The fathers of astrology in the De Essentiis-'Hermes et Astalius [i.e. Asclepius] Persarum astrologi>, pupils of 'Abidemon [i.e. Agathodaimon) lndorumrex'15--clearly belong to that 'strange mingling of the traditions of 11 lntroductorium in astronomiam Albumasaris abalachi ••• , Venice 15o6 (an edition of the Arabic text, and both the Latin translations, of John of Seville and Her· mann respectively, has been pr~pared by Richard Lemay, City University, New York, and should, it is hoPied, be published in the near future).

Hermann of Carinthia is primarily known for his translations of astronomical and astrologi-cal works from Arabic into Latin.4 His original work, the De Essentiis, gives evidence of the range of his reading of Arabic works, whether in the original language or in translations which had already been made. Amongst these are two Hennetica: the De Secretis Naturae of ps.-Apollonius5 and Hermes's Aurea Virga. 6 The above quotation from 'Data Neiringet' corre-sponds very closely to the story told in the Arabic Hermetic work in Bodleian MS Marsh 556, fols 4-110, called 'kitii.h ai-Madifis ... a commentary on the kilii.h ai-lsfamii.tis'. 7 Here we read on fol. 55r: [ 1] The fourth, the clime of Venus. The wise Aris-totle said: there was a wise man of the fourth clime to whom her (Venus's) spirit used to be intimate in the desert, and he was called Shau th .... The wise Aris-totle said, the spirit of Venus was intimate with him and spoke in his language and ordered him and said: [2] 'When the Sun is in Pisces, and the Moon is in Cancer, then choose a Frida~ [3] and wash yourself and clean yourself and perfume yourself; L 4 J and hasten and enter a walled garden and aim for a round date-palm or another tree, and ~o under it.

[6] And I will I have argued in my edition of Hermann's De Essentiis (forthcoming) that the diAerences between N and LC sug-gest a revision to the text which appears to have been made by Hermann himself. 4 For a catalogue of these works see Burnett, 'Arabic into Latin', art. cit. n;, above. 5 De Essentiis 72vD--E and 65\"C. Hermann may have known the text directly (ed. U. Weisser, Buch ilber das Geheimnis der Schl,pfong, Aleppo 1979) in the same MS used by the translator Hugo ofSantalla. Hugo's Latin transla-tion of De Secretis Naturae is being prepared for publication by Mlle M.-T.d'Alverny and Mme Hudry. 15 De Essentiis 72vD: Sic Hennes in Aurea Virga ... Hermes quidem ipsa prfoati sui oerba colloquentis ad st facto retractat. This reference does not seem to be related to any extant Latin text called Aurea Virga. However, Hermes's Aurea Virga is also cited in the preface to liber Hermetis de Su: Principiis (a composite work, perhaps of the late twelfth century) ed. T. Silverstein, Archfoes d'Aistoire doctrinale et littiraire du mownige, xxn, 1955, p. 247, and may corresfloi:id to ·an Arab{c work with the same title -Hermes, k. Qat/ib al·dhahab (Hermes, 'the book on the Golden Bough'; lbn al-Nadim, Fihrist, ed. Fm~el, I'· 267.15). Other references to Her,nes in De Essen-tiis (58vE, 59v A, 63'G) are taken from his translation of Abu Ma'shar's Maius lntroductorium, where Hermes is cited as an authority (Book v1, Ch. 1, pr.

This version is close enough to Hermann's cita-tion to be its source. Hermann adds a reference to a date and a place ('in the days of the king of the Medes, at Thebes'), but since the names he uses are Latin, this could be an interpolation. He slightly abbreviates the Arabic, omitting the name of Venus's spirit. His substitution of Gemini for Pisces is probably a straightforward error caused by the similarity of the symbols II and +f, and his version of part [ 7] is probably due to misinterpretation of the Arabic. Given the notorious unreliability of transliterated proper names, Shauth is remarkably close to * laoth. But what is most significant is that the Arabic word which Hermann leaves untrans-lated -chaiten -occurs in this very MS (M'itan, 'walled garden' [4]). Hermann had evidently failed to understand the Arabic, per-haps thinking that M' i/an referred to a ceremo-nial garment of some sort. But by merely trans-literating the word he has given us a valuable clue to the origin of his citation. For, of the MSS of the k. al-ls/amti{zs, Marsh 556 ('the commen-tary') is the only one that gives the reading /Jii'ilan.8 Is it possible then, that Hermann knew the k. al-ls/ama(is in the same version as that found in Marsh 556; or might there have been an intermediary source, through which Her-mann knew the work? The most likely of these sources would be the Ghayat al-/Jakim known in Latin as the Picatrix. This is an Arabic compendium of Hermetic science attributed falsely to Maslama al-Majr'it'i, but apparently composed in Spain in the eleventh century.9 The work was trans-lated into Spanish and thence into Latin under the auspices of Alfonso X, King of Castile, in the second halfof the thirteenth century, There is no evidence of an earlier Latin translation; however, Hermann could have known the work in the original Arabic. A large portion of the k. al-lslamtilis, including the passage with which we are concerned, is contained in the Ghiiyat,10 and the title is given: 'Aristotle's work, 8 For the readings of the other MSS see the apparatus to Ghiiyat al-~akim (ed.

However, Hermann's quotation does not correspond to the version in the Ghaya, which is considerably abbreviated: [1] And as for the summoning of the spirit ofVenus, [2] then aim for the time when the Sun is in the beginning of Pisces and the Moon is in Cancer, and that very Friday, [3] clean and perfume yourself[4] and enter a bath, and aim for a date-palm or any kind of tree, and go under it.

This occurs in a fourteenth-century MS in the Sloane collec-tion of the British Library. The text is incom-plete, the folios are in the wrong order, and two folios can be shown to be missing. 12 It turns out 11 Chaya, p. 239 (German tr., p_. 251). 12 S[loane MS 3854]. Lynn Thorndike was the first to mention this Latin work (History of Magic and Experimtntal Science, 11, New York 1923, p. 260). With great insight he suggested that it might be related to the work in MS l'[aris B.N. ar. 2577] which he knew only through Blochet's summary orits contents (E. Blochet, Etudes .rurle Gnosticirmt Musulman, Rome, 1913, pp. 81-100). Sloane 3854 consists or three MSSorvarying dates but all concerning magical images and incantations, bound together in one codex.

Moreover, the gatherings are in the wrong order, the folios within two or the gatherings have been bound incorrectly, and one bifolium is missing. The folios would be in correct sequence if the gatherings were recon-structed in the following way (I give the folio-numbers as they stand at present): ~i~ l[ff :§: ~ ~ ~ ~ Si II l I l ________ .J"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"VI TRANSMISSION OF HERMETIC MAGIC 169 that the Liber Anlimaquis is based on the first part of the Arabic work occurring in MS Paris ar. 2577, fols 38r-105\\ whose opening words are: 'l:Iunain ibn Isl)aq says: Among the books of Aristotle which we have found and which we have translated from Greek into Arabic there exists the book of the causes of spiritualities composed by Hermes.'

However, a large part of the contents of this 'book of the causes of spiritualities', including sections also in the Liber Antimaquis, correspond to the contents of the commentary on the k. al-Iseamatis in Marsh 5 6.14 The passage we have been discussing is found on fol. 96r of the Liber Anlimaquis: [2] Quando Sol intrat principium Piscium et fuerit Luna in Cancro, in die Veneris in eius hora [5] die ista nomina: Dabras alusayluz heemeyluz dahayryz raymech cemuluz ayhuz yachtares.

The work breaks olfincompleteat the end of fol. 103v. The last part of the Liber Anlimaquis includes spells employing Scandinavian runes (fols Io 1 ,.,., 97'-v) and Christian spells (fols 102'-103v) and would not therefore apfear to beof Arabic origin. S fols io4-101' corresponds, sometimes closely, some· times only approximately, and abbreviating considerably, to P fols 38'-6ov. The work translated by 'I:Iunain' begins six pages after the beginning of a work described as 'the book ofHermes on spiritualities' (kittib Hirmisfi.''l-riil,aniyyiil; P fols 35'-104'), which in turn is called 'the second part'. The 'first part' (P fols 1'-34') is called Hermes's kitab al-Ustuwwa(iis ( .;.u.j...i:.i1 \"':\"l::S\") on fol. 1', but kilah al-Uslli/tis ( t.l\"U.._;...:.;.°'J1 \"':\"l::S\" ) on fol. 34'. 14 P fols 49'-52v corresponds to [Oxford, Bodleian] M[arsh. 556] fols 29v-41', P fols 82'-v corresponds to M fol. 55' (the story of the descent orVenus's spirit).

The relation of the Liber Antimaquis to its Arabic source, and the inter-relationship of sev-eral Arabic works with similar names and a large overlap in subject-matter (such as k. al-Iseamakhis, k. al-lsfama{is, and k. Ustuwwatas) need further investigation.16 Even Hermann may have known two different texts, as the variation between the MSS of the De Essenliis attest.17 The title Hermann gives to the book is Arislotiles data neiringel, which could well be the title of one of the texts he knew (perhaps kiltib dhat al-niranjal li-Aris{iiltili's, 'Aristotle's book on the essence of the talismans'). One may com-pare this title with the statement at the begin-ning of the 'book of the causes of spiritualities, translated by l::lunain', that 'in this work Aris-totle treats of the causes of the spiritualities and the talismans' (cilal al-rii~iinfyal wa 'l-nirarytil) .1.s In the course of this short survey of the source of a quotation from a magical work in Hermann of Carinthia's De Essenliis it has become clear that there was more than one route by which the Hermetic tradition of magic may have passed from Arabic into Latin. The Ghayal al-~akim, or Picalrix is the best known, but it by no means holds the field. The date of the composition of the Liber Anlimaquis is unknown, but Hermann of Carinthia's citation of a work by 'Aristotle' on talismans gives evidence that Hermetic magical texts were known to Latin scholars at least a century before the Alphonsine transla-tions. 16 For these works see Ullmann, op. cit. n. 7 above, pp. 374-75; and F. Sezgin, Gmhichle des Arabischen Schrif-lums, vn, Leiden 1979, p. 57. 17 Prolcssor David Pingree has pointed out to me that the form of the quotation in De Essenliis MS;.\\; (n. 3 above) may include under the words /eid Persarum regis a reference to /a4d (agird), the Persian King from whose accession the Persian era was computed. 18 P fol. 38'.

Consequently, I discovered a version of part of the same work in a manuscript which has been in Barcelona since at least the mid-fifteenth century, and was probably written in the early years of that century.

The text is written in one column, and copious diagrams and tables are included. The use of the manuscript by Catalan speakers is clear from the notes on the penultimate flyleaf (fol. 91 v).

It is noticeable that several of the works included in the manuscript are by, or associated with, Jewish astrologers. Thus no. 2 is by a 'Rabi Abraam' and no. 12 by Profatius ludaeus (i.e., Jacob ben Machir ben Tibbon). No. 13 is the work of the Jew Jacob Peol and refers to Maimonides in very deferential terms. No. 16 is a translation by Plato of Tivoli, whose close association with Abraham bar J:liyya is well-known,7 and the last author in the manuscript, who quotes from Plato's version of the Centiloquium, is a 'David ludaeus'. The most common onomantic texts have a Hebrew association, as do the earliest texts in the West concerning the lunar mansions. Most striking is that the letters of the Hebrew alphabet appear to have been used to number the tables, though most of these letters have now been partially or totally cut off in the trimming of the folios. A phrase consisting of at least ten Hebrew letters has been cut off in the top margin of fol. 71 v, within the tables. However, to off-set this Jewishness, several pious formulae have been added which express the Christian faith: Fol. 13v. 'Explicit spera lohannis de Sacrobosco qui in pace requiescat. Amen.' Fol. 40v. 'Explicit liber practice astrolabii. Benedictus sit dominus deus lhesus Christus Amen.' Fol. 54r (the end of the canons): 'Et facit relucere faciem eius cum illo lumine quod dedit ei Deus benedictus, qui est lux perfecta, fortis et continua, ex cuius habundancia relucent tenebre, ut dixit Ptopheta: Terra illuminata est gloria eius' (Apoc. 18, 1 ).

'Totum tamen est in potestate Dei qui est medicus omnis carnis, et est magus et faciens mirabilia magna solus, et nullus alius ab ipso, qui vivit et regnat in secula seculorum. Amen.' Those works whose place of composition is known, come from Catalonia and the neighbouring Provence. Plato of Tivoli and Abraham bar J:liyya worked in Barcelona. Ermengaud de Blaise made his translation in Montpellier, but is also associated with Barcelona where his uncle, Arnald of Villanova resided. The Tibbonid family were active in several towns in Provence, and Jacob Poel (Bonjorn) wrote tables for both Perpignan and Barcelona. A more narrow association of some of these works with Petrus Ceremoniosus (Peter IV, king of Aragon, d. 1387) who commissioned the Barcelona tables, might be possible.s 7 See J.-M.

His annotations are mainly of an astrological nature, but he also shows a considerable interest in Classical mythology (e.g., in an excursus on Saturn on fol. 23v) and quotes from Isidore and Prester John. The Catalan notes in a later hand have already been referred to. There are further notes in Latin on fols 65r-v which mention the year 1506. What might be the original scribe has written against the table of fol. 65v '<in an>no .mccccxiiii. servit hec tabula' (cut off by the margin). That is, 'this table is valid in 1414'. An early fifteenth-century date would fit the script of the manuscript. We have, therefore, a manuscript of astrological works, many written by Jews, compiled towards the beginning of the fifteenth century, and perhaps sold to a Jewish merchant by a certain Pedro Alvaro and Simo Puig in 1446, and bought by a Joan Benares who may have made notes in the manuscript in Catalan for the year 1479. He or his successors were still using the manuscript in the early sixteenth century, and it has remained in Barcelona until the present day. * * * * The text in this manuscript on which I wish to concentrate is the second work, occurring on fols 15r-26v. This appears to be a single work. The contents, however, fall into three disparate categories, as we shall see, and one is inclined to think that a single author has brought together chapters from three different sources in a misguided attempt to compose an introduction to astronomy and astrology. I. The first source is indicated in the title of the first chapter: secundum rabi abraam de prima forma cursus planetarum. One immediately thinks of Abraham bar J:Iiyya, and indeed, the first five chapters of the work are a translation or summary of a substantial portion of the Jewish exegete's On the Form of the Earth (Surat ha-' are~). This was very popular in Jewish circles, but, so far, no Medieval Latin translation of the work has been identified.9 The first chapter begins: 'Declaratum est in libris anti-quorum philosophorum quod figura universalis omnium celorum est figura sperica'. The problem is posed that, in that astronomy is based on · d'Arag6', Revue hispanique, 12, 1905, pp. 413-590. Dr Jaume Riera kindly drew my attention to this article. 9 J.M. Millas Vallicrosa, La obra \"forma de la tierra\" de R. Abraham bar J:liyya ha-Bargeloni, Madrid and Barcelona, 1956, pp. 19-21 discusses the earliest Latin translations : of Oswald Schereckenfuchs in 1546, and another sixteenth-century translation in MS Vat.

Geometry provides the answer by means of eccentric and epicyclic circles, which give the two paradigms (formae) for the planets' move-ments. The first chapter is devoted to describing the first forma ( = Surat ha-' are$, II, § 10), the second to the second forma ( = Surat ha-' are$, II, §11). In the third chapter the movement of the Sun is explained in terms of the eccentric paradigm ( = Surat ha-' are$, II, § 12-13), while in the fourth and fifth chapters the more complex movements of the Moon are described (=Surat ha-' are$, III). The consistent use of the word super in place of de for 'about' would suggest that the author was thinking in the vernacular (compare Castilian and Catalan sobre), but whether that is the implication of odd sentences like the following is not clear to me: Fol. 17r: 'Tu non potes stare super proportione cursus Solis equalis, nisi prius investiges numerum dierum anni eius'. A more correct Latin version of this would be: 'Non poteris rationem uniformis Solis cursus invenire, nisi prius numerum dierum anni eius investigaveris'. But in Catalan the sentence would run: 'Tu no pots entendre sobre la porporci6 del curs igual del sol, si primer no investigues el numero dels dies del seu any'. Vernacular influence on the Latin text is also evident in the common use of single consonants in place of double (mitit, af ert, afligunt, mitet etc.), and the use of non-Classical words such as bladus ('cereal'), baro ('man/husband') and cavilla ('cardinal house'). II. On fol. 22v the subject turns from planetary theory to the computus. A chapter on the divisions of time (de multiplicatione et diminutione numeri temporum et dierum), based not on the sexagesimal system known since the introduction of Arabic works in the twelfth century, but on the old system of atoms, moments, parts, minutes, points and hours described by Bede and Isidore, is followed by a paragraph on the course of the Moon in which these time units are employed, which may be the De Luna of Wale her of Malvern. 1 o III. The third section of this compilation begins on fol. 23r with a chapter headed De naturis et proprietatibus planetarum. This chapter is followed by another De amicicia vel inimicicia planetarum, which ends abruptly on fol 26v without an explicit, and corresponds to a section in the work which I have previously described as the kitiib al-I stamiitis .11 IO C. H. Haskins, Studies in the History of Mediaeval Science, Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1924, second ed., 1927, p. 114. 11 Millas Vallicrosa (La obra \"Forma da la tierra\"), claims that (1) Surat ha-'aref was intended to be the first part of a larger work in which the second and third parts were extant works on astronomy and astronomical tables, and that (2) VII"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"VII 8 THE KITA.B Al-ISTAMA.T/S AND A BARCELONA MANUSCRIPT * * * * In Arabic there are several works with similar-sounding names which transmit the same subject-matter, often arranged in different sequences and put down in different wording, but consistently ascribed to Hermes. Whether behind the Arabic texts there lies an original Greek or Syriac document which first set forth this Hermetic material has yet to be discovered. That this Hermetic tradition passed over into the Latin-reading world is demonstrated by the fragments of Latin works containing the same material in the manuscripts of the Sloane Collection and the Biblioteca de Catalunya. To put the Latin fragments into context I shall first describe the Arabic material as it is found in MS Paris, Bibliotheque nationale, ar. 2577. This text belongs to the class of works with names ending in -afis, -ifis, -ilfas and -akhis. The mare's-nest that these texts form is illustrated by the difficulty in finding the correct title of the text in the Paris manuscript. On the first page it is called kitab al-Usfuwwafas of Hermes the Wise. Then on fol. 11 r of the work we read 'Aristotle the translator of this book, said that Hermes said ... '; and Qala Hirmis ('Hermes said') alternates with Qiila Arisfiifiilis qala Hirmis (' Aristotle said that Hermes said'). On fol. 34r there is the ambiguous reference to 'the end of the ldtab al-Usruras (sic) and this is the first part of the book'. The second book begins with the words 'The second part of the book of Hermes on the spiritual forces' ('riif:ianiyyat' ), and again begins with the now familiar formula Qala Arisfaralis qiila Hirmis. The same words occur several folios later, but this time the text begins: I:Iunain ibn lsQaq said: this is one of the books of Aristotle which we found and translated from Greek into Arabic. It is the book of the causes (\"ilal') of the spiritual forces by Hermes, and their division over the 7 regions ('aqlim'). And this is the book in which Aristotle explained the causes of spiritual forces and nairanjiit and their quality ('kaifiyyatiha') and their actions ('a'maliha') and their essences ('jawahiriha') and their differences divided according to the 7 regions. And this is what Alexander demanded from Aristotle the Wise when he had completed the ldtii.b al-ls!amakhis, which he had composed for him on his journey to Persia. Abraham bar l~iyya announced that he would complement this astronomical work with an astrological one, but that (3) this astrological text was never completed, or at least did not survive (see pp. 18-19). It is worth considering whether the third section of our text is related to the lost or uncompleted work of Abraham. The second section of our text is, however, totally foreign to the astronomy of Abraham in which the sexagesimal system is used throughout."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"THE KITAB AL-ISTAMA.TfS AND A BARCELONA MANUSCRIPT 9 Finally the colophon of the manuscript gives the name of the whole work as 'the book of Hermes on the spiritual forces', and this is the name we adopt. But within the text in the Paris manuscript further sources are given, with the names 'Hermes' book of the hidden and concealed Secrets', 'Hermes' book of the deposit', and 'Hermes' book of the secrets of the world'. The work begins with a detailed account of the precise relationship between the megacosm and the microcosm, which is valid at both a spiritual and a corporeal level. The megacosm-or universe-has as its outermost component the firmament under which is the corporeal sphere of the twelve signs of the zodiac. The seven planes, which are 'spiritual' entities, act as 'doors' through which the spiritual power of the firmament passes to the signs of the zodiac and to the earth. 12 Man's head corresponds to the firmament, his chest to the sphere of the twelve signs, and his feet to the earth. Through the-seven 'doors' of his head-two eyes, two ears, two nostrils and mouth-which are assigned to each of the seven planets-the spiritual influx passes into the chest, where it rules the seven interior organs, the heart, the stomach, the lungs, the liver, the spleen and the two kidneys. In each of these organs resides one psychological faculty, such as intelligence, anger, love, etc ... There is a second division whereby the whole of man from head to toe is divided amongst the signs of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces. This is the familiar astrological 'melothesia', but then, just as the planets have their exaltations in certain signs of the zodiac, so the spirits of those planets rule in the parts of the body assigned to the signs in which the planet has its exaltation. Then in man, too, there are correspondences with the whole of the created world: the heart is in sympathy with two-footed animals, the liver with four-footed animals; to the lungs belong birds, to the spleen, fish; while insects are assigned to the kidneys. More obvious parallels are drawn for the blood (=water), the veins (=rivers), the sinews and nails, which are like rocks, and the bones which are like the mountains. The hair is like plants and trees, while the parts of the body without hair are like deserts. The spiritual forces multiply like bacteria within man. Venus's spiritual forces are divided through 360 veins; another 900 veins contain Mars' spirits; Jupiter's spirits occupy each of the 560 measures of blood, whereas 12 measure of saliva are occupied by Mercury's spirits. The 12 For the implication that the signs of the zodiac lie below the planets, compare the similar view that the fixed stars lie between the orbits of the Moon and Mercury, found in several Indian astronomical works and 'Jafar Indus' (a Latin translation from Arabic made by Hugo of Santalla in the mid-twelfth century); see D. Pingree, 'The Indian and Pseudo-Indian Passages in Greek and Latin Astronomical and Astrological Texts', Viator, 7, 1976,pp.141-95(174).

Finally, 360 measures of fat belong to the spirits of the Sun. But this is to describe the end-product. In the beginning the earth was without any spiritual content at all. For its first 33,000 years of existence it was barren and without life. Then the spiritual force of the planets became apparent in the waters, and fishes, followed by insects, appeared. After another 11,000 years there appeared four-footed animals. Finally, 55,000 years after the beginning, man appeared on the face of the earth. Now an interesting variant of the story of Adam and Eve (called here Admaniis and Haywaniis) is given. All the planets except Saturn were in their exaltations: this meant that they were literally nearer to the spiritual reservoir of the firmament, and, therefore, the spiritual powers that they relayed to the earth were more intense than at any other time. These spiritual forces coalesced into a spiritual being which is called in the manuscript Hadiis. Then, by gathering together spiritual forces from the firmament, the zodiac, the planets and the earth, and by sheer willing and concentration of thought, Hadiis was able to bring into being Admaniis, at first as a kind of zombie without intelligence; then, with a further injec-tion of spirits, as a fully-developed man. Admaniis gazes in wonder at his creator. He is lost in contemplation of him, and is fully contented because of his total trust in him. But Hadiis induces a deep sleep on Admaniis, and extracts part of his flesh and spirits, from which he creates Haywam1s-at first as a kind of two--dimensional picture without intelligence. Admaniis becomes so engrossed by this picture that it takes on full humanity, and entices him away from the contemplation of his creator Hadiis, and into loving and trusting Haywaniis instead, until their mutual feeling is eventually consummated in union. There follows a eulogy of the greatness of Man. He has power over all creatures; he knows all knowledge; he can do all things, see all things, hear all things, eat all things, drink all things. This is because he is the form of forms, embodying in himself the whole of creation, to which he is also connected by the matrix of spiritual forces. From this natural relationship with all things as the microcosm, and as a result of the wisdom infused in him from on high, man has the power to manipulate nature. And it is the instructions for doing this-i.e., for working magic-that occupy the rest of this long work. The 'first part' of the work ends with an account of the purpose of the magical images or talismans, to be made in each of the 28 mansions of the Moon. The second part of the work-~Iunain ibn Isl).aq' s translation of Hermes' book of the causes of spiritual forces-specifies that different procedures for"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"THE KITAB AL-IS'[AMATIS AND A BARCELONA MANUSCRIPT 11 working magic must be followed in each of the seven regions of the world. For each of these regions is under the dominion of a different planet, which dictates the character, the religion and the laws of the people under its jurisdiction. To each of the planets and to each of the spiritual forces of their different 'directions' a magical name is given. Three of the planets' spiritual forces-the upper, the infront and the behind-are not composed with earthly beings; but the four others are so composed. For all these composed spiritual forces there are particular animals, trees, herbs, gems and minerals. For example, to the Sun are ascribed rapacious animals, including the Filam in China, which is like an elepant, but has a long neck instead of a trunk, wild cows, lions and poisonous snakes, all fragrant trees with fruit that has a good taste, such as figs, quinces, apples and pears, and every red spice, good to smell, like nard, sweet cyperus and sandalwood, rice and white beans, and gold, ruby, carnelian and every red gem. A story is told concerning the revelation of the knowledge of the spiritual forces of the planets for each region. We will summarize, as an example, the story concerning Saturn's region, which is India ('Hind'). At a time when the inhabitants of India had no law and were like wild animals in their way of life, their King, called Safnadiila, was visited in a dream by the spirit of Saturn in the form of a black man. Acting according to Saturn's instructions, Safnadiila summoned 72 leaders of the people of his region, on an appointed day and at a specified place, where, after fumigation of specific organic and inorganic matters and a sacrifice in front of a statue of Saturn, the same black man came out of the statue, dressed in clothes coloured black, yellow and green, and endowed each of the 72 elders with one of the 72 spirits of Saturn. From these spirits they were given knowledge, and were able to exercise control over their affairs. Moreover, after appropriate purifications, wearing of ceremonial clothing, sacrifice, preparation of food and incantations (the magical words to be addressed to each planet are given) each could summon up his spirit in visible form, and that spirit would do his bidding. The knowledge with which the 72 elders are endowed is primarily that of making talismans or nairanjat (the Arabic form of a Persian word for the same object) and the rest of the section on each planet is devoted to the recipes for making poisons and potions (with their antidotes) with such ingredients as monkey brain, buffalo milk, elephant urine, and other noxious things; but also herbs and spices such as cloves and camphor. Finally, there are instructions for making the signet ring of each planet. The kind of gem to be set in the ring is described first. On this, on the planet's day and at the planet's hour, the image of the planet is inscribed on the outside, and on the inside magic letters or cryptographs are VII"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"VII 12 THE KITAB AL-ISTAMATIS AND A BARCELONA MANUSCRIPT written. Then the stone is set in a ring of a particular metal, and the ring gives its wearer particular powers. * * * * Whether all this material was ever translated into Latin we do not yet know. The section on talismans to be made in each of the twenty-eight mansions of the Moon formed a separate tract in Arabic, which was either incorporated into the book of Hermes on the spiritual forces, or excerpted from it; it appears in a Latin translation.13 The fragment of the translation in the Sloane manuscript headed 'Antimaquis' ( ;::: ls(amakhis ?), in addition to the material shared with the Barcelona fragment, includes the description of the microcosm, the spiritual forces of each of the planets, and the various animals, plants, spices, minerals and gems associated with them.

Her-mann of Carinthia in 1143 cited a passage from al-Iseamatis in Latin, and William of Auvergne appears to have known the work in the early thirteenth century.2 Sloane 3854 provides evidence that a large portion at least of al-Istamdeis was translated into Latin. The heading of the work in the manu-script is: Iste liber est spiritualium operum Aristotilis et est liber Antimaquis qui est liber secretorum Hermetis. Opera mira possunt operari per hunc librum et est liber antiquus septem planetarum. Liber Antimaquis.3 (This book belongs to the spiritual works of Aristotle, and it is the book Antimaquis, which is the book of the secrets of Hermes. Wonderful works can be effected through this book and it is the ancient book of the seven planets. The book Antimaquis.) * Sloane 3854 is of fourteenth-century Italian provenance. The four gather-ings which contain the work (together with a fragment of salacious novelle with topical Italian references) have evidently been taken from another manuscript. They have been subjected to some confusion, perhaps deliber-ately engineered by the \"magician\": folios have been sewn into the gather-ings in the wrong order, and two gatherings have been interchanged.

This includes an edition of the Summa chiromantiae ascribed to 'John the Philosopher'. 6 R. A. Pack, 'A Pseudo-Aristotelian Chiromancy', Archi11es d'histoire doctrinale et littiraire du moytn age turned up no Latin manuscript on the subject earlier than the thirteenth century. Moreover, even references to the practice of chiromancy in Latin works appear to be absent between classical times and the mid-twelfth century.8 John of Salisbury, in his Policraticus, refers to (hereafter AHDLMA), xxxv1, 1969, pp. 18g-241: this chiromancy is the text beginning: Cum diversi diversa de arte ... (my chiro.D below), and is closely related to the 15th cent. English chiromancy edited and translated by Derek Price as An Old Palmistry, Cambridge 1953; idem. 'Pseudo-Aristoteles: Chiromantia', AHDLMA xxx1x, 19721 pp. 289-320 (the text: Cyromancia est ars demonstrans mores ... ; my chiro.E). 7 C. B. Schmitt and Dilwyn Knox, Pseudo-Aris\"toteles Latinus: a Guide to Latin Works Falsely Attributed to Aristotle before 1500, Warburg Institute Surveys and Texts xu, London 1985, pp. 21-24. This lists 41 MSS of chiromancies attributed from time to time to Aristotle. 8 Juvenal (Satire v1.583) refers toa client presenting his forehead and hand to soothsayers; Pliny, Nat. hist. x1, 114 cites Aristotle's statement (n. 2 above). Neither the current medieval Latin dictionaries nor Pack in his survey of medieval lists of condemned divinatory practices ('Pseudo-Aristoteles: Chiromantia', as inn. 6 above, pp. 28g--91) attests to another reference to chiromancy before the De dirJisione philosophiae of DominicusGundissalinus (written c. 116o): ed. L. Baur, pp. 119-20: 'cum enim multe sint sciencie iudicandi de proposita questione ut ... ciromancia in manu, et multe alie ... hec [sc. astronomia] ceteris dignior est ... ') and John of Salisbury's Policraticus (see below). These two works are the earliest texts in which the termschiromantia and chiromanticus appear in Latin. Neither the practice nor the terms are mentioned in Hugo of St Victor's Didascalicon. The appearance of the term cheiromantia in the mid-twelfth century might be compared with the adoption, at about the same time, of the word geomantia for a kind of divination which was being introduced from Arabs -the \"ilm al-raml' or 'sand-divination' (see T. Charmasson, Recherches sur une technique dirJina-toire: la geomancie dans /'occident midiival, Geneva-Paris 1980). The use of the word chiros (from Greek kheir) for hand or palm is universal in the early Latin texts, but has not been noted in the published dictionaries. Unless it can be shown that Latin chiromancy derives from Greek -for which at present there is no evidence -I would attribute the use of this word to the same scholastic trend which substituted Greek terms for Arabic in scientific translations from Arabic of the twelfth century (e.g. the above-mentioned geomantia, terms such as telesmatici, gmethlia in astrological works, and parallelogramma and isosceles in geometry).

R. James, The Canterbu~y Psalter, London 1935. Current scholarship places the completion of this elaborate Psalter in c. 1 160. The chiromaney together with an onomancy have been added at the end of the manuscript by one of the scribes who has copied the Psalms. This chiromancv is edited and translated in the Appendix. 11 See L. C. '.\\kKinnev and H. Bober, 'A Thirteenth-Century Medical Case History in Miniatures,' Speculum xxxv, 1960, pp. 251-59. 12 See Ashmole 399, fol. 1 t (Pl. 50} for a particularly fine example of the hands. 13 Chiro.A, 29 corresponds to a rubric on the thumb of the right hand, reading: 'Hee sunt signa fidelitatis et inlidt>litatis, que si coeunt, infidelitatem et suspen-sionem signant' (S, fol. 126'); chiro.A, 51 corresponds to a rubric refrrring to lines at the base of the little finger of the right hand: 'Hee sunt signa vulnerum corporis infra genua -magna futurorum, parva preteritorum;' for chiro.A, 52 see the rubric to similar signs at the base of the middle finger: \"Hee sunt signa vulnerum corporum - lata futurorum, subtilia preteritorum.' It is possible that the space at the bottom of the second The addition of the word etc at the end of the text in Ead might suggest that this copy is incomplete. However, all the other manuscripts of chiro.A end in the same place, with the exception of S which continues with a com-pletely new (though related) text (chiro.A2) which will be mentioned again below. Ead is obviously a neat copy of another exemplar -the error palicie for palme attests to this - but we appear to be close to the source of the tradition of chiro.A. Is it possible that chiro.A is the earliest form of a chiromancy in the West, and is there a possibility that its occurrence in a Canterbury Psalter of c. 1160 is not accidental? In comparing chiro.A with other medieval texts on chiromancy14 one is struck by its column on fol. 282 of Ead was intended lor the hands. Hands with the same rubrics accompany tracts on palmistry other than chiro.A (e.g. the text in Paris BN 1215; Thorndike, as inn. 5, p. 678}, which suggests that the tradition of the illustrations should be considered separately from that of the texts. 14 The texts used lor purpose of comparison are the following: I Chiro.A2, incipit: 'Tres sunt fideles linee in planicie cyros .. .'; Sloane 323 (Z}, fols 191r-\".

If a connection can be made with Adelard of Bath (c. 1080-1 1 52} this would place this chiromancy earlier than chiro.A and the references in Gundissalinus and john of Salisbury. However, the attributions sound manufac-tured, Adelard never translated from Greek, and in discussing why the fingers are of unequal length and the palm is concave in his Quaestiones naturales (ed. Muller, pp. 40-41} Adelard shows no evidence of being interested in palmistry. :\\ievertheless the attributions must have been made whilst the name of the translator Adelard was still fresh in people's minds; i.e. in the twelfth centurv rather than the fourteenth.

The data are written down stenographically, without elaboration, and with little attempt at explaining terms or ordering the material. Some terms are unpro-ductive in other chiromantic works: e.g. the middle fingers are numbered from the smallest (Secundus a minimo, tertius a minimo), the hollow of the palm is called the fovea (elsewhere concavi-tas), the blade is the conus percussionis (elsewhere conus ictus), and the flat part is the mensa (elsewhere tabula). No sentences seem to be lifted from other known chiromancies. The note form and haphazard arrangement of the material suggest that the author was jotting down common lore, which included some discrepancies (alternative opinions are intro-duced by secundum quosdam), and is close to oral sources. The appearance of chiro.A in a psalter is surprising. All the other texts on chiromancy mentioned in this article are found in manu-scripts of popular science and divination, and are often adjacent to physiognomies.15 However, a notable feature of chiro.A is its references to matters of interest to the clergy: 39 A cross ... in another part of the flat part (denotes) confession. 10 If around the foot of the first natural line (a mark) like a 'c' should occur -this is of this sort: -e-he will be a bishop. 45 If a kind of triangle lies next to it in the flat part <J it denotes a pre bend. The only other chiromancy which refers to the Church so directly is the brief additional text appended to chiro.A in Sloane 323 (chiro.A2): 59 When it extends as far as the first finger, he will be a monk. 71 This mark is the sign of a parish income (preshyterium). 80 This is a sign of someone being elected or freely blessing. chiro.D (see below).

All these texts belong to classes I and IV in Craig's classification scheme (seen. 4 above). In the case of all the texts except those edited by Pack the references are to the sentences ofmy own transcripts. 15 E.g. Ashmole 399 includes a physiognomy on fols 1-13•, and the onomancy known as 'The Victorious and the Vanquished' on fol. 59•; in Cambridge, Trinity 0.2.5 and Sloane 323, the chiromancy follows a physiognomy. 81 This is a sign of someone despising the clergy. 86 This sign is ofa blessing: this of a curse.16 Among the rubrics on the illustrated hands (some of which, as we have seen, correspond to sentences in chiro.A), there are: a This cross signifies the sign of the staff (haculi: possibly corresponding to chiro.A, 10). 21 This line beside the triangle, if it is quite long, is a sign of a good confession. 17 In other works on palmistry the ecclesiastical relevance appears to be deliberately toned down. Instead of 'a sign of a good confession' we find 'a sign of a good conversion' .18 At the end of chiro.B3 we read: If, in the hand of a peasant the sign of a bishopric is found, one should not say that he will become a bishop or a prelate, but that he will have honour according to his estate.19 Are we justified in seeing an ecclesiastical context for the writing-down of chiro.A? It is one of those nice coincidences that the only instance of the practice of chiromancy that is known in the twelfth century could be related precisely to Canterbury, and to the year 115 7. The context, once again, is John of Salisbury's Policraticus.

There are four mutually independent sources that can be identified as standing at the beginning of this Latin tradition: I The Eadwine Chiromancy (Chiro.A; edited above). This is a list of signs occurring in different parts of the hand, without a general description of the hand or an account of the significance of each of the natural lines. II The Sloane Chiromancy (Chiro.A2; edited below), occurring only in MS British Library, Sloane 323. This gives a very brief description of the indications of each of the three lines, followed by a list of signs whose in-dications are not governed by their position on the hand. It is conspicuous for its strange vocabulary ('prodice, 'co(r)ponosius' and 'scyros' for the three natural lines; 'alius' apparently for 'second'). III The Adelard Chiromancy or Chiromantia parva (Chiro B 1; edited below). This is the first chiromancy that clearly arranges the material according to the natural lines and the triangle formed by the first three natural lines. In two out of the four known manuscript copies it is attri-buted to Adelard of Bath. IV The Hands. Diagrams of the right and left hands, with signs and their indications written on them (edited below; see Plate). Although the indi-cations occasionally correspond to those described in the Eadwine Chiro-mancy, the wording is not the same, and different information is given on the Hands than in any of the three chiromancies listed above. The Sloane Chiromancy does not seem to have had any influence. Both the Eadwine and the Adelard Chiromancies were added to the Hands, and all three of these sources were used in later chiromancies. These are as follows: I I am very grateful to the help of Dag Nikolaus Hasse, Danielle Jacquart, Annelies Kuyt, Clare Woods and Irene Zwiep. x"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"x 2 CHIROMANCY: SUPPLEMENT V The Ars chiromantiae attributed to Aristotle, edited by Pack in 1972,2 and described in Schmitt and Knox's Pseudo-Aristoteles Latinus as Chi-romantia IJ,3 is a compilation from the Eadwine Chiromancy, the Adelard Chiromancy and another text or texts. Its compilatory nature is already stated in the title given to the text in MS Bern, Burgerb. 353, fol. Ir: 'Incipit ars ciromancie ex multis compilata'. After a preface defending the practice (which may be original) the compiler simply copies passages from other works, which can be distinguished as follows: i) The Adelard Chiromancy is the principal work copied. Almost the whole work is included (only passages about women's hands 13, 39, 42-45 are omitted). ii) The Eadwine Chiromancy provides the author with many of the indi-cations of the signs in the hand. E.g., end of c.6 = 18; second half of c.7 = 10-14; beginning of c.8 == 36; end of c.10 = 2-3, 5-7; middle of c.11 = 26-9. iii) A yet unidentified source (unless this is original) provided the com-piler with his theory of the 'linea prosperitatis' which 'some books do not mention' .4 This is the source for chapters 4 and 9 and possibly chapter 5 in Pack's edition, and appears to have provided the compiler with his favoured terms for the lines: 'linea vitae', 'linea mensalis', 'linea tabu-laris' (as well as the aforementioned 'linea prosperitatis'). This source may in turn have used the Adelard Chiromancy, since two of the indi-cations from that chiromancy are repeated, once with 'Adelard's' terms (chapter 10), and once with the anonymous source's terms (chapter 5). The copying of different sources results in some repetition (e.g., the indi-cations for the loss of one or two eyes is taken from the Eadwine Chiro-mancy in chapter 8, but from the Adelard Chiromancy in chapter 10). It also results in a multiplicity of names for the lines and the parts of the hand. Pack argues that the Ars chiromantiae was written after the death of Albertus Magnus (1280); the earliest manuscript dates from the fourteenth century. VI The John of Seville Chiromancy. This is the chiromancy attributed to Aristotle, edited by Pack in 1969,5 and described in Schmitt and Knox's 2 R.

It is an elaborate scholastic text on chiromancy which includes the information found in the Adelard Chiromancy and the Hands but incorporates it into a well-composed treatise. Two manuscripts, Klagenfurt, Bischotliche Bibliothek, XXX.d.4 and Bern, Burgerb. 353, name 'Johannes Hispalensis' as the 'causa efficiens' of the text, andapostface in theKlagenfurt manuscript, entitled 'Translatoris verba', states that the work was translated .from Arabic by him .. But this postface merely reproduces the preface to John of Seville's translation of part of Pseudo-Aristotle's Secret qf Secrets. The latter work was extremely popular and included a physiognomy. Since chiromancy is the physiognomy of the hand, it may be for this reason that this Chiromancy is attributed to Aristotle in three of the six manuscripts known. At the end of the text in the Bern manuscript, and after the postface in the Klagenfurt manuscript, is a passage on the preparation of the hand for inspection and some general points, which is closer to the text of the Adelard Chiromancy. than the equivalent passage in the A rs chiromantiae. The earliest manuscript·of the John of Seville Chirom,mcy is of the fifteenth century. Richard Pack states6 that the John of Seville Chiromancy is, in turn, the source of VII, an epitome by Rodericus de Maioricis (Tractatus cyro-man.cie ), which was copied and attributed to 'John the Philosopher' in a manuscript which Lynn Thorndike used for his edition of the work in Speculum, 40, 1965, pp. 684-706. There is a great similarity too, between the contents of (1) the John of Seville Chiromancy, (2) VIII, the 'earliest known book of palmistry in English' edited by Derek Price,? and (3) IX, the Summa chiromantiae, attributed variously to 'John (Regiomontanus)', 'Richard', and 'Aurelian', which was much-copied, and translated into English by John Metham. 8 Hardin Craig claims that another text on chiro-mancy, X, beginning Secantur ( or Distinguunt) scientiae inter se quemad-modum res de quibus, res aut ex quibus scientiae ... , is an 'amplified trea-tise of the same general plan and content as the Sumrna chiromantiae .9 In the Summa chiromantiae the 'mounts' of the fingers are assigned to the planets; this astrological aspect is developed in the treatise beginning Secantur scientiae ...

The attribution of the Adelard Chiromancy is more cogent, considering that the treatise stands at the beginning of the Latin chiromantic tradition. However, the style does not match that of Adelard's known translations from Arabic, and there is no evidence that he translated from Greek. All that the attribution might suggest is thatthis chiromancy originated in England where the earliest manuscripts of the Eadwine Chiromancy and the Hands are also to be found. Unlike in other literary traditions, these Latin chiromantic texts do not seem to have developed from sections on the hand in physiognomic texts.11 The discovery that the earliest forms of Latin chiromantic texts were simple sets of instructions, sometimes merely written on the hands, suggests an oral origin of the literary form, and it might b~ futile to look for literary precedents in another language.12 Since there is so much variation between manuscripts, and little sense of a 'canonical' text, it is difficult to establish a critical text.

There is another next to this which is called the 'table line', because it extends across the length of the table of the hand. 2 Some lines are natural only, some are natural and accidental, some are accidental only. 3 Likewise, of the natural lines, some are straight, others oblique, some thick, others thin. some sharp, others blunt, some red, others pale, some divided,. others continuous. The same applies to the natural-and-accidental Jines and the accidental-only. 4 You will call 'natural only' those lines which are naturally in· the hand of each man, such as the triangular and the table line. 5 You will call 'natural and accidental only' those lines which individually are in some subject by nature, and acciden-tally reveal his fate, whether in respect to past things, or present or future. 6 We call 'accidental only' those which arise from too much heat or too much cold or from a malfunction of the blood; we will teach how they can be distinguished in what follows. For these are always misleading in all (hands), but since true judgement concerning happenings (?) comes about from the natural-only and the natural-and-accidental-only lines, about these one must speak first, postponing the others. 7 Therefore, let us start from the triangle, which, as has been said, three natural lines constitute, showing what it has to indicate according to its disposition. 8 And since some triangles are equilateral, others have lines of unequal length, some thin (lines), others thick, some (having) obtuse angles, others acute, one must speak about each kind separately. 9 An equilateral triangle predicts a trustworthy man (or believer), a long life, and a man capable of being loved, and famous. 10 If the upper line in the triangle appears to be longer than the rest, it predicts a thief; if shorter, the opposite; if thicker, a murderer; if thinner, wantonness; if red, loss of blood; if pale, hanging. If there is a step in it, it indicates adultery in a man, but chastity in a woman. 11 The right line is contrary in every respect, the lower line is divided between both. 12 If the higher angle is acute and flat, it indicates an acute intelligent and a deceitful, lying man; if it is obtuse, an insecure x"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"x 12 CIIlROMANCY: SUPPLEMENT 13 Inferior in dextra ex toto contrarium si in viris, per contrarium in mulieribus invenies. 14 Tercius angulus si fuerit acutus, vitam metitur et salutem; si obtusus et pallidus, mortem sive infirmitatem. 15 Triangulus si in aliqua parte sui non cohereat,26 stulticiam affirmat aut maxime luxuri-osum. 16 Si in triangulo superius talis figura apparuerit ff. in viro demenciam et mulieris lascivium [sic] significat. 17 Si in dextra linea trianguli .o. apparuerit, unum oculum amittet; si duo, duos. 18 Si multe rimule eandem fiderint, regiones multas visurum vel vidisse denunciant. 19 Hee eadem in radice sua si plures lineas ad modum cruds expanserit [sic] et unum .o., signum est boni finis et confessionis bone. 20 Superior li~ea in triangulo si in radice plures lineas ad modum ~emi-serit, infirmitates multas ante mortem significat.

To save him Hilaricus (?), that man, devoted to God, having bent his knees to the ground and extended his hands to heaven, prayed that the Lord might reveal to him a clear sign of the recovery or death of his brother. 52 The Lord therefore fulfilled his prayer. For rising from his prayer, he saw infront of him a marble statue of this kind on which he noticed that a right hand of a man and a left hand of a woman were sculpted in which the aforementioned signs were indicated. 53 One should know, however, that a certain natural art was discovered by a certain philosopher, Eadmund, who was previously a Saracen and was called Manean, but Master Adelard translated this art from Greek into Latin. S adds: 50 And he adds that this art was revealed in Britain to a certain very religious ancorite, and this, in respect to those accidental lines by which he made predictions is a true revelation(?), 53 but in respect to the natural lines it is a natural science.

The second prognostic text (fol. 282v) consists of the tables for a kind of prognostication based on the letters of the client's name. There are four tables: A. The planetary weekdays and their numerical equivalents. B. The victorious and vanquished numbers. C. The determination of the divisor according to the topic ('For the sick and for combat divide by 9; for husbands and wives, by 7') D. The letters _of the alphabet and their numerical equivalents. 5 From related versions it is possible to work out the instructions which are tacitly understood in these tables: To determine which of two combatants will win you take the name of each of them separately. You find the numerical equivalents of the letters from table D and add them up. You divide the totals by nine and note the remainder, which will be a number from I to 9 (a remainder of O counts as 9). Then you consult table 8 and find out which number conquers which, and this will indicate the victor.

The essential element of this form of divination is a set of nine tables listing all the possible combinations in pairs of the first nine digits, and indicating for each pair which number 'conquers' which (i.e. table B in the Eadwine Psalter). This is found in Greek, and especially in Oriental sources, but has not up to now been recognized in Latin or the European vernaculars before the mid:..thirteenth century: Let. us unravel the evidence that the Eadwine Psalterprovides for the Western tradition of this form of onomancy.

An earlier manuscript which gives the tables of number-letter (0) and planet-number (A) equivalents, but not the victorious and vanquished numbers, is a ·codex bound into Bodleian, Digby 67.

This title might. lead us to suppose that the tables come from the Liber Alchandrei which has the title Ma-lhemalica Alhandrei Summi Aslrologi in an eleventh-century French manuscript now in the British Library.16 Onomancy plays an important part in the jejune astrological fortune-telling which forms much of the subject.-matter of the Liber Alchandrei. In addition to the above-mentioned Latin text of the Letter of Petosiris to Nechepso the Liber Alchandrei includes several tables of letter-number equivalents. The Eadwine Psalter letter-number and planet-number equivalents and the table of victorious and vanquished numbers are not found in any of the manuscripts of the Liber Alchandrei or its siblings, as far as I know.

European vernacular versions of the Secret of Secrets derive from one or other of two Latin translations of the Arabic text: the partial version made by Johannes Hispalensis probably a little before the middle of the twelfth century, and a fuller version made by Philip of Tripoli about a century· later. zo Curiously enough, neither of these translations in the numerous manuscripts that have survived, includes the onomancy.

Sloane 213, written ca. 1400, which preserves what appears to be a translation of the physiognomy and onomancy from the Secret of Secrels.22 Now, when one compares the onomancy in Sloane 213 with that in the Arabic Secret of Secrets and the texts we have surveyed in the Eadwine · Psalter, Arundel 339, Ashmole 304 and Sloane 3554, one finds that it is closer to the Latin texts. The arrangement of the table of victorious and vanquished numbers is the same, and differs from the Arabic arrangement; the table is said to be relevant not only in the case of two combatants (the only application mentioned in the Arabic text), but also in the case of illness, and in determining which of a married couple will survive the other; and division by seven is prescribed for the latter. There is little doubt that the onomancy in Sloane 2la and those in the Eadwine Psalter, Ashmole 304 and Sloane 3554 belong to the same tradition. Moreover there are other English vernacular texts which belong to this tradition, of which examples are edited below. Sloane 213 corroborates the connection of Digby 67 with this tradition, for it gives the same table of letter-number equivalents as that found in the Senlenlia Alhandrei. Thus we have a tradition of onomancy preserved in English manuscripts and attributed in certain of these manuscripts to Aristotle and Alexander. The witness of the Eadwine Psalter would suggest that this tradition was already established by ca. 1160, since the scribe thought it. unnecessary to add instructions on how to use the tables. Could it be that a section of the Secret of Secrets had already reached England by subterranean channels by this date and that this is the source of this tradition? The earliest manuscript of the translation by Johannes Hispalensis forms part of the collection of medical manuscripts donated by the doctor Heribertus to Durham Cathedral towards the end of the twelfth century. 23 Moreover, this manuscript, in common with the other surviving manuscripts of this version, does not include the onomancy. It is possible, but unlikely, that another translation made from the Secret of Secrets reached England in the twelfth century. However, it should be remembered that the Secret of Secrets is itself a compilation, and the onomancy, while being an element which contributed to this compilation, also appears on its own in Arabic manuscripts. 24 It appears in the twelfth-century manuscript. of the Syriac Book of Medicines, amongst a collection of popular ways of predicting the outcome of a disease based on computations using combinations of the nurnerical equivalents of the (22) Ed.

As we have seen, the Liber Alchandrei'-'-like the Secret of Secrets-is a compilation of material associated with Alexander the Great. It is the earliest Latin work to give the Arabic names of the planets and signs of the zodiac, and the 28 'stations of the moon'. Yet it also gives the Greek alphabet, the numerical value olGreek letters, and (in some versions) the Greek names of the planets as well as the Latin translation of the Greek letter of Petosiris to Nechepso, in which Greek words are kept in Greek letters. A text of Alhandreus was known in England in the time of William of Malmesbury26 and a manuscript. of Adelard of Bath's rarely copied Regulae Abaci once included the Mathematica Alhandrei. 27 As has been noted, the onomancy 'The Victorious and the Vanquished' has the same 'feel' as sections of the Liber Alchandrei. Digby 67, when mentioning the planet-number equivalents, gives the names of the planets in Greek. Arundel 3..19 includes both the onomancy and a version of the Liber Alhandrei on fols. '36v-.:41. We may suggest some tentative conclusions. There does not seem to be any need to propose that all instances of the text 'The Victorious and Vanquished' in the West must ultimately derive from an Arabic Secret of Secrets. If this method of divination had an Oriental source at all, one might be able to see it as coming through the same channels as the oriental material in the Liber Alchandrei, but it is possible that-again like portions of the Liber A_[chandrei-it derived from Greek. One important transformation would have had to take place. In Arabic as in Greek, the letters of the alphabet had numerical values, and these were the values used or implied in the table of letter-number equivalents in all Arabic and Greek versions of 'The Victorious and Vanquished'. In Latin only a few letters (I, V, X, L, C, D, M) had numerical equivalents, and a set of letter-number equivalents had to be substituted. This set bears no relation to the values in the Greek and Arabic texts. 28 However, these (25) E. A.

In the Latin manuscripts 'The Victorious and Vanquished' is anonymous, with the exception of Arundel 339. In this fourteenth-cent.ury manuscript the work is ascribed to Pythagoras and Ptolemy, but the author adds that Alexander the Great had the table with him wherever he travelled. Alexander's connection with the Table is referred to in the English versions in British Library, Sloane 121, Sloane 213 and Sloane 1609. It is plausible that, like the Alchandrian material, an earlier Western version of 'The Victorious and Vanquished' was associated with Aristotle and Alexander. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that Arundel 339 and these English versions presuppose the knowledge of the onomancy in its context within the Secret of Secrets. Since that onomancy is lacking in the two Latin translations of the work, it is tempting to consider the Spanish version (which includes the onomancy) as the vehicle of transmission. 30 The presence of Spanish (if 'Anfos' = Alfonsus) and .Jewish ('Benaster\\ 'Daveide') names in the examples given in Sloane 213 adds support to this hypothesis. But even the Spanish version is not independent of an earlier European tradition in onomancy since it includes the same letter-number equivalents as is found in the 'Sphere of Life and Death' and the anonymous Latin versions of 'The Victorious and Vanquished'. The common features of the Latin and vernacular versions of 'The Victorious and Vanquished' which separate them from the Arabic version in the Secret of Secrets would suggest that even if the figure of Alexander was taken from the Secret of Secrets, it was grafted onto a tradition which already existed in the West. Since the onomancy in the Eadwine Psalter shows no sign of being extracted from the Secret of Secrets, it may be an important witness to such an earlier tradition of 'The Victorious and Vanquished'.

On the V iclorious and the Defeated An indispensable thing for thee, 0 Alexander, is this, that thou shouldst find out the name of the person thou art going to fight with, and do not engage in battle unless victory can be computed. This is one of my secrets which I used to practise when I was in thy royal company, concealing it from thee, and which I am now disclosing to thee, according to our covenant. It is one of those mysterious sciences which God has inspired me with and directed me to, through His mercy and wisdom. (The number-letter equivalents follow.) O Alexander, count the numbers of the letters of the names of the commanders of both the armies, according to the above table. Then divide the total of each name by nine, and keep in thy mind the remainder of each. Then predict according to the following table, which is correct and unfailing, and do thou note it well.

XI"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"XVIII A NOTE ON TWO ASTROLOGICAL FORTUNE-TELLING TABLES In Revue d'histoire des textes, 6 (1976), pp. 267-304, Paul Kunitzsch published a curious fortune-telling table which he hacl found in two manu-scripts of the twelfth century-Paris, Bibliotheque nationqle, lat.14154 (P) and Hanover, Niedersiichsische Landesbibliothek IV.394 (H). The table (henceforth : 'Kuriitzsch's table') is in the form of a grid with two axes. Along the vertical axis are written the names of the planets and three other astro-nomical terms - the full moon, the ascending node, and· what is probably the Dog Star. Along the horizontal axis are ten of the twelve signs of the Zodiac, written from right to left. In each of the hundred squares of the grid there is a prediction written twice : the upper· version gives the prediction in Latin, the lower, in Arabic transliterated into Roman script. In theory the reader may follow the coordinates corresponding to the prevailing astro-nomical situation and discover what activity he should be engaging in. For example. if the Moon is in Scorpio he should be listening to the sound of a lute. However, the astrological terms, in all probability, serve merely as a means of organizing the data and one should not look for any sophistica-ted astrological practice here. Kunitzsch was not able to find any table in Arabic or Latin which was similar to this table. Indeed, he could bring forward only one other example of a bilingual Latin-Arabic text, this being a chapter on the climes from De horologi,o secundum alcoram. The form of the table, however, is not unique. Kunitzsch has observed that in both H and P the table immediately pre-cedes the tables of the Preceptum Ptolomei, a partial translation of the Handy Tables of Theon, made from Greek in the sixth century. When we turn to two early Latin manu .. oripts of astronomical tables, Leiden, Bibliotheek der Rijksuniversiteit, &rriliB·er 38 (S), of the eleventh century I and Paris, Biblio-theque nationale, lat. 16208 (N), of the early thirteenth century 2, we find a table which looks very similar to Kunitzsch's table. On folio 135 r0 of N the table foUows a copy of the Toledan Tables. It is headed Tabula * l. The table is found on fol. 37 v0• For a description of th<' early astronomical works in this MS see W.

The horizontal axis gives the names of the twelve signs of the Zodiac. this time, in contrast to Kunitzsch's table, from left to right. The vertical axis gives twenty-four 'unexpected events'.

Not surprisingly, many predictions concern money (inventio pecunie, minoratio pecunie, pecunia et magnitudo, etc.), status (ditabit vel regnabit, augmentum honor-is, auferetur a potestate, etc.), enemies (inimicus egrot.abit, inimicus morietur, etc.), and marital or sexual affairs (uxorem habebit, uxor rrwrietur,fomicatio, etc.). There is a good chance that he who consults the table willfind what he likes (inve-niet quod amat}, and eventually receive refreshment of the· soul (refrigerium). The language of this table has vernacular traits (Curtis for 'courtyard', inse-curita and potesta without the finals). There is no evidence that an Arabic original lies behind the table, and it is more· likely that it might be based on a Greek version (cf. the term patriarcha} Kunitzsch's table must have been adapted from an Arabic table. Its predictions do not correspond to those of the Tabul.a prenostica Salomonis. Nevertheless; both tables have the same 'feel', and both add a lighter tone to the folios of technical astro-nomical tables they accompany. The Tabula prenostica Salomonis was not without influence in later cen-turies. It is debatable whether Chaucer is referring to this table in particular when he mentions, among other signs used for divination, 'trakkinge of hou-ses' and 'gnawynge of rattes' s. In the sixteenth century, however, we know of one manuscript 6 and one printed· edition 7 of a work which is entitled : (Liber) Zebelis regis et sapientis Arabum vetustissimi, de interpraetatione quorundam accidentium, tam externorum quam internorum, sive eventuum innopinatorum, rarorum et insolitorum, secundum Lunae motum, per duodecim zodiaci celestis signa, observationes accuratissimae Zebelis. The printed edition is bilingual, in Latin and German, and begins with an elabo-rate preface by the German alchemist Heinrich Khunrath of Leipzig8• In this he states that he took his text from a manuscript belonging to the Elec-tors of Brandenburg (possibly the manuscript still in Berlin), and justifies the work in the following way : God speaks to men by using all his creatures like letters of the alphabet. Thus the kinds of unexpected happenings men-tioned by Zebel indicate the voices and sentences of God. Even the Pytha-5. Geoffrey CHAliCER, The Persones Tale, c. 38, sentence 604 (ed. W. W.

'I have examined', Khunrath says, 'and put to the proof the observations of Zebel on many occasions, and found them not at all frivolous or false. For God speaks to the humblest of men through these * unexpected occurrences'. Khunrath's preface is followed by that of Zebel, which outlines the virtues and benefits of astrology. Turning to the work at hand, Zebel states that no event is truly fortuitous since ultimately each thing has God as its legitimate cause. Zebel's grandfather handed down the secrets of the art to Zebel, including a volume with 1,300 chapters, entitled 'the book of the judgements of unexpected events' (liber iudiciornm inopinato-rum eventuum). From this book, at the urging of Zebel's son Selam, Zebel extracted the mosLremarkable parts and summarized them, adding some things, but omitting a large part of the work. Zebel's grandfather, inciden-tally, also wrote ten books 'about the administration of the state' (de administra.tione Reipublicae) and was a good king. The preface ends by emphasizing that nobody should attempt to use the book who does not take it seriously and wishes to deride or scorn its contents. These contents are precisely those 'unexpected events' of the Tabula prenostica Salomonis with others added : sonit.us parietum, tinnitus aurium, corvina crocitatio, galli-nus cantus, mot\\Jioculi, sonitus ignis, canis ululatus, de voce soricis, exustio vestimenti, motus terrae, clamor cattae, ingravatio femoris, avis cadens in terram, obviatio ferae silvarum, extinctio candelae, etc. 9• For each event, a very short prognostication is given for the Moon in each of the signs of the zodiac. APPENDIX With the help of Simon Hopkins. now of the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, I had been working independently from Paul Kunitzsch on the copy of the fortune-telling table in Paris, Bibliotheque nationale, lat. 14 754. The Service photogra-phique of the Bibliotheque nationale kindly provided us with a very clear 24,30 cm. photograph of the table (fol. 244 v0), and, on the basis of this copy, in certain cases we arrived at different interpretations from those adopted by Kunitzsch. While acknowledging Kunitzsch's masterly achievement in deciphering and interpreting the table, I would like to suggest, by way of an appendix, some variant interpretations which might be worth considering 10• 1. Convenientia desideria/bilos emel. Possibly bulugh amal, 'attaining desires'. 9. The 'unexpected events' are numbered, in an erratic way, up to 126. l 0. The item numbers are those of Kunitzsch.

Instead of the ingenious suggestion that a Romance word appears in the Arabic phrase, it might still be possible to consider poton (which is clearly written in both MSS) as the Arabic word baH ('duck'). This would he closer to the La-tin translation anser ('goose')·· than is Kunitzsch 's suggestion of bujun ('young dove'). 16. Orare in absconso/dartafahali. The Arabic phrase would seem to mean 'breaking wind in secret' (</,a1a fl l-khafiy; this is Kunitzsch's explanation). If so perh~ps the Latin orare has derived by stages of corrup-tion through petere ('to seek') from pedere Cto break wind'). 17. Cantilenas bonas/gineantagib. The Arabic phrase is ghinii(an) {ayyib ('good singing'). The termination an would be the Spanish Arabic marker of an indefinite noun followed by an attribute 11• 23. Comparare mulum/scire gabal. It is tempting here to accept Richard Lemay's more natural reading ofthe Latin -mulum (muluiH. mulu P) 12, and interpret the Arabic as a misspelling or metathesis of bagel (from H) or bagal (from P), i. e. bighal ('mules'), or baghl ('mule'). 25. Pellicinam madurinam/faro fenek. The Latin phrase presents no pro-blems : madurinam is a corruption, or a variant influenced by vernacular pronunciation, of marturinam, from marturinus ('of marten-fur') 13. XVIII 33. Sonitum tubarum/darbarkela. There may be no need to look for a musi-* cal instrument in the Arabic phrase. Rather, one could read <!,arb arkila ('smoking a hubble-bubble').

The term al-kzmiya) can be found in a text belonging to the earliest period of scientific prose writing in Arabic, and, as alkimia, was in turn introduced to Latin readers in a translation of this text made before I r 51. The text in question is < lJ mar ibn al-Farrukhan al-Tabari's k. al-masahl (\"book of questions\") in 138 chapters. <Umar ibn al-Farrnkhan al-Tabari was one of the astrologers who participated in casting .the horoscope for the foundation of Baghdad in 762.2 He was responsible for translating important astrological texts from Persian into Arabic, including Ptolemy's Tetrahiblos, .Dorotheus of Sidon's Astrological Poem and a work on questions of law and ritual purity (the k. al-maMsin).3 His k. al-masiPil belongs to the astrological genre of \"interrogations\", in which the astrologer, on being questioned by his client concerning a particular topic, indicates what will happen or reveals what is hidden by looking at the state of the heavens (the horoscope) at the time of the question. After the first few introductory chapters, each of the chapters of the k. al-masii)il is devoted to a different question. Following chapters related to marriage and before others referring to the weather, there is a chapter on whether to trust the alchemist or not. It may be translated as follows:4 Chapter 79. On the knowledge of alchemy (ft ma<arifat amr al-kimiyii.>). When you wish to know concerning a man whether he knows the science (<ifm) of alchemy or not, assign the ascendent and its lord to the querent, and the seventh and its lord to the man enquired about by the querent. And the house of the knowledge of the man is the ninth from the seventh sign. And see whether this is fortunate or unfortunate, East or West, cadent or in a cardine or withdrawing from a cardine, and whether it is in aspect to the lord of the seventh. And if it is aspecting it and it is fortunate, it indicates that in his hands is a true knowledge ('ilman ra!Ji4an), especially if the aspect is trine or sex tile and there is application and reception between them. But if the aspect is quartile or from opposition, it indicates that there is in his hands something powerful (shay) an qawfiryan) and that he attains it with much seeking, labour and exertion, and this is • the case when benefics are aspecting it.' And if malefics are aspecting it, it indicates that there is labour (ta<b) in it, and he does not obtain anything from it. Since the k. al-masiihl is commonly referred to by the number of its chapters and chapter 79 is a complete chapter in itself, it is unlikely that it is a later addition. Given that cumar's family is Persian, and that all the translations we know by him are from Persian, it is possible that the material in the k. al-masiihl comes from Persian sources.5 However, at the time he"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"XIX 104 was writing, other astrologers were using Greek and Syriac materials; in fact the writings of one of them, the Syrian Christian Theophilus of Edessa (d. 785), survive both in Greek and in citations by his Arabic coUeagues.6Since the term al-kim[JJa) is apparently derived from a Syriac rendering of the Greek ';(UμE(<X or xriμe((X, then <Umar's source may have been Greek.7 In any case, the reference to al-kimiyiP gives no indication that the term was not familiar to his readers. This is understandable if alchemy was practised in the Arabic world even before theoretical texts on the art were written, which is plausible. Whether this chapter can be regarded as the earliest written record of alchemy in the Islamic world depends on what historical value can be placed on the writings attributed to the Umayyad prince Khalid ibn Yazid (late seventh century) and theShi(a imamJa(far aH;adiq (ca. 699-765). In any case <U mar's dates would be almost the same as those traditionally assigned to Jabir ibn l:layyan ( 721-815), and the chapter from his al-ktmtya> would be an independent testimony to the lively interest in alchemy at that time. (Umar's k. al-masi?il was translated into Latin by Hugo of Santalla probably between 1141 and 1151, and possibly even before 1141. Hugo's translation is incorporated in a collection of three works on judicial astrology-the Liber trium iudicum-addressed in two out of the three manuscripts in which it occurs to Michael, Bishop ofTarazona from I 119 until , 151 .8 AU the translations of Hugo which have dedications are dedicated to this bishop, and one of them, we are told, was made from an Arabic manuscript found in the library of the Arabic kings of Zaragoza at Rueda dejal6n.9 Since this stronghold fell to the Christians in 1141, it is possible that this and other Arabic manuscripts were part of the booty. On the other hand the manuscript could have been acquired earlier through a friendly exchange. Hugo's translation in the Liber trium iudicum is headed: Here begins the book of <Umar ibn al-Farrukhan al-Tabari, the translation of Hugo of Santalla, excerpted from the volumes of the Ancients, solving many kinds of questions as if being their principal starting-point (as due thought teaches us). This book is divided into 138 chapters.10 The wordiness of the title is typical of Hugo's style, but the translation of chapter 79 is literal enough and makes good sense: <Umar, On alchemy. When the question has been asked whether the discipline of alchemy has been fixed firmly and surely in a man, assign the ascendent and its lord to the querent, and the seventh with its lord to the man about whom the question is asked. For the ninth sign from the seventh one shows his knowledge. (See) whether it is fortunate or corrupt, East or VVest, or cadent, in a cardine or withdrawing from a cardine, whetr ~r too they aspect the lord of the seventh. For if they aspect the lord of the sevent and they themselves are fortunate, they indicate that he is skilled (peritum), especially in trine or sex tile (aspect), while their application does not lack reception. But ( an aspect) from quartile or from opposition bears witness to the fact that he has acquired this (art) with difficulty and after many inconveniences oflabour-that is, if the aspect of benefics is not absent. For if the malefics aspect, even ifhe has studied with difficulty, his efforts have been without effect.11 Hugo's translation could be roughly contemporary with the date associated with the earliest Latin alchemical text--the Liber Morieni translated by Robert of Chester in 1144.12 What is interesting is that the writer of the Liber Morieni presents 'alckymia' as a term"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"XIX THE ASTROLOGER\\, ASSAY OF THE ALCHEMIST unfamiliar to its Latin audience, and gives it a definition which would be more appropriate to the Philosopher's Stone: Since you Latins have not yet understood what alch:_ymia is, I shall enlighten you in the present work ...

We may presume that alchemical techniques were practised in Western Europe before Arabic texts on alchemy were translated into Latin. Robert Halleux and Paul Meyvaert have recently shown that an artisan's textbook which included alchemical recipes from Greek sources circulated in the early Middle Ages; this is the Mappae clavitula.14 However,. the Mappae clavicula does not use the term x.uμE(<:¥ or its cognates and there is no datable evidence of its use in Latin before the liber Aforieni and, now, Hugo's translation of< Umar's k. al-masahl. Hugo was otherwise familiar with Arabic alchemy, for he was also responsible for making the earliest translation of the Tabula smaragdina of Hermes Trismegistus. This mysterious text was regarded as the key to alchemical esoterism and is the culmination of the Hermetic revelation in Pseudo-Apollonius's Secrets ~f Nature which Hugo translated from Arabic.15 These references to alchemy are not the only ones found in Arabic ~nd Latin astrological texts. For Sahl ibn Bishr, who was active in Marw and Baghdad in the first half of the ninth century, 16 gives alchemy as a topic in two of his works. In his own book on interrogations we read the following: 17 And if you are asked about a work (bab18) of alchemy (k'im!yiP), whether it is true (ltaqq19) or false (ba{il), then look at the lord of the ascendent and the Moon, and if; they are free from the malefics, then it is a true being (kiihnun ~aqqun). And if they are malefics, then it is false. And if it is gold, then use the testimony of the Sun, and ifit is silver, then the Moon. The question is the same as that in (lJmar's text, but the observations are simpler. In addition, Sahl specifically mentions the making of gold and silver, leaving one in no doubt that traditional alchemy is the sul~ject. In Sahl's work on catarchic astrology (i.e., about choosing the time that the stars indicate to be most appropriate for commencing an activity)20 it is the alchemist himself who is asking the astrologer about the right time to initiate the \\Vork:21 And if you want to deal with alchemy r ilii.j al-kim~ya>22) and to practise something you want to do repeatedly, then let this be done when the Moon is in two-bodied signs, free from malefics, and let the ascendent be in such a position, and fix it. If the dealing Ciliij) is in gold, then the Sun should be strong, and fix it at the beginning of this. This appears in a slightly different form in a maghribi manuscript of the text, which gives:23 And ifyou want to practise alchemy (carnal al-kim!ya)2'1) and deal with it (<ilajaha25), and what returns into the hands of the man practicing (alchemy) many times, then"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"XIX 106 let this be done when the Moon is in a ( two )-bodied sign, pure from malefics, and let the ascendent be in such a position, and fix it. And if the dealing (<ilii:i} is in gold, then from the Sun, and fix it at the beginning of your (task). Both these texts of Sahl were translated into Latin in Spain in the twelfth century. The first appears in the same Liber trium iudicum as <Umar's book on interrogations, and is in the tersestyle distinctive of Hugo's associate Hermann of Carinthia, though no translator's name appears at the beginning of the text, which is headed \"Liber Zahel d.e iudiciis .lvi. capitulis distinctus\" (\"The book of Sahl concerning judgements, divided into 56 chapters\"): Sahl, On alchemy. When investigating the truth concerning alchemy we consult the lord of the ascendent and .the Moon, which, if they are pure and free from the malefics, are an indication of the truth ( of the alchemy). If they are corrupted, the opposite. Therefore if it concerns gold, we accept the Sun as testimony; ifsilver, the Moon.26 ln the larger collection of works of judicial astrology called the liber novem iudicum the phraseology sounds more like that of Hugo: Sahl, On alchemy. If anyone should presume to profess the knowledge of alchemy, and if you wish to discern whether a true discipline of this kind is obtainable at his hands, you will have a dependable indication of such an important matter from the lord of the ascendent and the Moon. For if both are pure and free from the malefics, it testifies that it is true and not without benefit. The corruption of these insinuates that he is false and lying. And if it is concerning gold, the testimonies of the Sun should be sought; for silver we consult the Moon. 27 The reverential language of the latter passage would seem to indicate that the translator or reviser holds the practise of alchemy in high respect, were it not typical of Hugo's high-flown style. The Latin translation of Sahl's book on catarchic astrology is called De electionibus and is by an anonymous translator, different from Hermann and Hugo: And if you wish to practise alchemy or any work that you wish to keep repeating, let this be done when the Moon is in bicorporeal signs, free from malefics, and let the ascendent be similarly (placed). Then fix it. And if your work is in gold, strengthen the Sun and fix it at the beginning of the work.28 From these translations of Arabic texts derive later Latin astrological works which mention alchemy. For example Leopold of Austria's Compilacio de scientia astrorum (late thirteenth century) clearly derives from the Liber novem iudicum version of Sahl's book on interrogations,29 whilst Roger of Hereford's Liber de quatuor partibus astronomic (late twelfth century) quotes Sahl's De electionibus verbatim. 30 But we may end with a verbose late thirteenth-century text on judicial astrology which is probably the Consilia of Bartholomew of Parma.:il This pads out Sahl's skimpy passage on assaying the alchemist, and applies the method to arry practical experiment:"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"XIX THE ASTROLOGER'S ASSAY OF' THE ALCHEMIS'f The question ofwhether any experiment is true or false: If one is asked of any experiment in the art of necromancy, medicine or alchemy, whether it is true or not, look at the ascendent and its lord. and the Moon for the querent, ( and) the eighth and tenth for the expedment, wdting or instruction lo be made (?).

And one should know that the Sun gives a testimony concerning gold and everything· of great value, hut the Moon concerning silver and everything of small and medium value. 32 NOTES AND REFERENCES I.

The interest of this letter lies in its application of these traditional literary ele-ments to a specific historical situation. As is well known, the Mongols, with extraor-dinary rapidity during the first three decades of the rhirceent.h century, had forced into submission or laid waste the whole of Central Asia from th~ Yellow Sea to the Black Sea, and by 1240 were posing a threat to Muslims and Christians equally. 12 Some Christians were encouraged by the reporrs that ,\\mong rhe Mongols there were Nestorian Christians, including the Prester John whq had promised co rescue Chris-tendom from Islam. But they were soon disillusioned by the merciless treatment meted out by the invaders co Hungary and Southern Poland in 1241. The Arabs fared no better, and the cAbbasid caliphate in Baghdad finally came to an end with the Mongol capture of Baghdad in 1258. Only in 1260, when the Mamh1q army of Egypt defeated a battalion of the Mongols at c Ain Jaluc, was the tide of advance stemmed, and Europe and the Arabic world could breathe freely again. Many of the literary sources used in the Epistola Pn,denti viro are echoed in chron-icles of the time. Popular etymology derived the name Mongoli fromMagogoli (\"de-scendants of Magog\"), 13 and Roger Bacon does not hesitate to identify the Mongol invasion as the fulfilment of the prophecy concerning the escape of Gog and Magog from behind the Caspian Gates: Aethicus the philosopher in his Cosmography expressly says rhat the race shut up within the Caspian Gares will rush out into the world, meet the Antichrist and call him \"God of gods.\" Without doubt, the Tartars were within these gates, and issued forth. We know for cem1.in that the Gares are already broken, for Franciscans whom Louis, the present king of France, sent forrh, passed through the midst of these Gates and went far on into the mountains along with the Tartars who had been shut up there. 14 There were rumors, too, that the Mongols actually had \"dog-faces,\" and were thus identifiable with at least one of the fabulous races listed in the Epistola. 15 Finally, Matthew Paris corroborates that the Mongols were regarded as the scourge of the Lord for the sins of Christian people.

Here the superscript might give a clue. The attribution to al-KindI is patently false, in thatJacqub ibn Isl~aq al-Kindt died soon after A.D. 870.17 To Europeans, however, al-KindI would have been one of the most familiar Arabic names, if not the best known, for there are some thirty works in Latin, mostly trans-lated or composed in the twelfth century, attributed to al-Kindf. 18 In char he is de-scribed by one twelfth-century Latin writer as \"the most reliable and true judge amongst ~trologers,\"19 he must have had a reputation for being an accurate judge and predicter of political events. Indeed, we do have a genuine work of al-KindI fore-casting the end of the rule of the Arabs.

The recipient of the letter, on the contrary, is a person who might well have been alive when the letter was written. He may be identified with Theodore of Antioch, * who appears to have succeeded Michael Scot as court astrologer to Frederick II Ho-henstaufen, at Palermo in 1238, who cast a horoscope for the emperor at the siege of Padua in 1239, and who died in (or just before) 1250. 24 Perhaps a Jacobite Christian himself, he is said to have studied at Mosul and Baghdad, and was enough of an Ara-bist to have been dispatched by the emperor on diplomatic missions to Arabic rulers. He translated a work on falconry which was revised by his imperial patron, and he wrote a short work on diet, which is found with the Epistola Prudenti viro in a four-teenth-century manuscript. 25 There is also a striking similarity between the superscript of our letter and that of another work allegedly sent from an Arabic potentate to Palermo, and involving Theodore. In a fourteenth-century manuscript of Italian provenance in the British Library we find on the first folio a work introduced as \"The book of the Nine Judges., which the Sultan of Babilonia sent to the Emperor Frederick at the same time as the Great Caliph sent Master Theodore to the same Emperor Frederick.\"26 This Liber n()T)ellZ iudicum is, in fact, a Latin compilation of nine astrological works translated from Arabic, at least three of which were.translated separately in Northern Spain to-wards the middle of the twelfth century. 27 It was used by Frederic:k II's astrologer Michael Scot in his compendium Liber introductorius. Moreover, it is occasionally as-cribed to al-KindI, in that the first chapter is tak~n from a genuine work by al-KindI on the Judgments of the Stars. 28 Like the prorocol of the Epistola Prudenti viro, that of the Liber n()Vem iudicum has been contrived to suggest that a work ofastrology was sent from an Arabic court to 23\"Quidam astrologus quern prophetam magnum Sarracenis reputant\"; cited by Bigalli (n. 16 above) 188. For the various prophecies that were current at the siege ofDamietta see Bezzola (n. 2 above) 13-20. 24See Haskins (n. 19 above) 246-248. 25This is the letter beginning Celsitudo vestra, edited by Sudhoff (n. 1 above). 26\"Liber novem iudicum quern missit Soldanus Babilonie lmperacori Federico tempore quo et mag-nus Chalif misit magistrum Theodorum eidem Imperatori Federico\"; London, BL Royal 12 G.

The Sultan of\"Babilonia\" is presumably one of the sultans ofEgypt (al-Kamil, d. 1238, or al-~lil;i Ayyub, d. 1249) with whom Frederick had close relations; see E. Blochet, \"Les relations diplomatiques des Hohenstaufen avec les Sultans d'Egypte,\" Revue historique 80 ( 1902) 51-64, but the \"Chalif\" would be the cAbbasid religious leader in Baghdad, 27See C.

Moreover, if one is to believe rhat the caliph himself had sent Theodore to the Christian emperor, it is alt the more plausible that Theodore should receive a letter from the caliph's philosopher. But the question remains as to the purpose of this fabrication. Had Frederick II anything to do with it? Frederick's interest in Arabic learning and religion was notorious. He sent a ques-tionnaire on geometry and algebra to al-Kamil, sultan of Egypt, and was moved by academic curiosity to visit the Islamic holy places and hear the muezzin in Jerusalem. His friendship with the sultans of Egypt and other Arabic rulers placed him under suspicion, and the fifth crusade was jeopardized by his dubious dealings with his Ar-abic counterparts. To the Mongols, however, Federick was consistently opposed. He took it upon himself to inaugurate a crusade against them which his son Conrad would lead. In a letter sent by the emperor to the monarchs of Europe in 1241 (just after the siege of.Faenza, during which Theodore and the emperor were working on their translation of an Arabic work on falconry), he warns them of the danger of the Mongols and recommends concerted action in the form ofa crusade. 29 It is noticeable that the tone of the letter is similar to that of the Epistola Prudenti viro. The Tartars resemble beasts in their nature, just as they are described as monstrous beings in the Epistola. Moreover, they have been sent as the judgment of God to punish and correct his people. 30 Frederick's enemies in Europe received this letter with great skepticism. It was even thought by some, according co Matthew Paris, that the emperor had deliber-ately engineered the Mongol threat as a move in his plan to overthrow Christendom. His letter was a mere cover-up. 31 Can we see, then, the Epistola Prudenti viro as a pro-paganda exercise written by a partisan of Frederick II and designed to give him cred-ibility in his campaign against the Mongols? The letter would suggest that Freder-ick's warnings were not only supported by the prophecies of the ps. -Mechodius and their derivatives, which were well known at a popular level of society, but were also 29The letter was reproduced in Matthew Paris, Chronifa maiora 4, ed. Luard, Rolls Series (London 1877) 112-119.

One copy came into the hands of one of Frederick's most bitter opponents. This was Alberc of Be ham who was a staunch ally of Pope Innocent IV. 34 As papal legate he repeatedly tried to stir up the nobles and bishops of Bavaria against the emperor, and the antagonism he met from Frederick's supporters resulted in considerable turbulence in his career. Clm. 2 5 7 4b, an unusually early paper manuscript, is the register of the letters he sent between 1241 and 1255, many of them written when he was with the pope in Lyons. 35 In-terspersed among the letters, and in the same hand (presumably that of Albert ofBe-ham or his secretary), is an assortment of miscellaneous information which must re-flect the interests of Albert at the time he was writing the letters. This includes not only his personal expenditure and income and his will, but also accounts of the value of the silver and gold mark, a list of bishoprics, a mnemonic for remembering the dates of church festivals, advice co princes (the ps.-Aristotelian Secretum secretorum), popular medical and astrological lore, and descriptions of marvels.

Albert was probably struck by the apparent connection of the letter with the astrologer al-KindI, which was a further proof of Frederick's involvement in the occult and the magical. The occurrence of the Epistola Prudenti viro among Albert's correspondence also gives some idea of when the letter was circulating, for it directly precedes the letters of 1246, which, in turn, are followed by the poems on the victory at Parma in 1248. In Marburg MS 9, as we have seen, the letter is followed by a treatise on diet writ-ten by Theodore himself and addressed to Frederick II. A document in the same man-uscript describes a medicine made up for Pope Gregory; and another work, giving rules for preserving one's health on crusade in the Holy Land, is addressed once again co Frederick II (this work apparently occurs in no other manuscript). 37 Two trans-lations of ps. -Aristotelian works commissioned by Frederick Il's son Manfred are also in the Marburg manuscript, while Innocent IV, Gregory IX's successor, is the recip-ient of a medical work in Paris BN lat. 6978, which also includes our letter. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the Epistola Prudenti viro was associated with works from either the imperial court or the papal court of Gregory IX and Innocent IV.

They all include the same recension38 of Philip of Tripoli's translation of the Secretum secretorum-the farrago of information on rulership, hygiene, astrology and physiog-nomy allegedly addressed by Aristotle to his imperial pupil Alexander the Great. Al-bert of Beham's manuscript would be a very early witness to the translation, and, if the translator Philip is identified, as Haskins thinks probable, 39 with the Philip mentioned in several documents as, variously, a canon, a prebendary, and a precentor ofTripoli between 1227 and 1259, then his attested presence with the pope in Lyons ~Cf. ibid.: Artes et auguria cessant Friderici Sibi nolunt obsequi daemones amici (p. 126).

C. Burnett, K. Yamamoto and M. Yano, Leiden, 1994. Here it is shown that the translations of Adelard are not quite so literal as implied in this article. II p. 137: astronodia can also be found in Raoul de Longchamp's com-mentary on Alain de Lille's Anticlaudianus, ed. Sulowski, Wroclaw etc., 1972, p. 66. Raoul may be indebted to Vt testatur Ergaphalau since he also refers to the divisions of astrology 'fabulosa, historialis, onomica' and 'imaginaria' (ibid., p. 212).

Steinschneider in 'Zur Geschichte der Uebersetzungen aus dem Indischen ins Arabische', Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlandgesellschaft, 24, 1870, p. 385). VI p. 168: a similar confusion of 'Medi' and 'Egypti' (perhaps arising from the aural similarity of the Arabic for Egypt-Mi~r-and 'Med-') occurs in Adelard of Bath's translation of the Abbreviation of the Intro-duction (see Add.

XI. Further examples of 'The Victorious and Vanquished' can be found in the following manuscripts: A. The Greek tradition of the 'Victorious and Vanquished' is condemned by Hippolytus, bishop of Rome (d. 235), who gives a detailed account of the procedure in Refutatio omnium haeresium, IV. 14, using the examples of Ajax and Hector, Alexander and Menelaus, Amycus and Polydeuces, Ajax and Odysseus, Achilles and Asteropaeus, and Menelaus and Euphorbus, and describes the divisions by 9 and those by 7. There are no tables, but the procedure is summarised as 'When one number is odd, the other one even, the odd number wins, if it is larger. If the two numbers are both odd or both even, the lower number wins.' The table of victorious and defeated numbers also occurs in MS Athens, Historical Society, 211, but in connection with questions concerning the relationship between a man and wife (ne;p1 yciμou ), and is printed by A. Delatte in Anecdota Atheniensia, 2 vols, Liege and Paris, 1927. I, pp.132-5. B. Further manuscripts of the Arabic version of the Victorious and the Vanquished can be found in A.
