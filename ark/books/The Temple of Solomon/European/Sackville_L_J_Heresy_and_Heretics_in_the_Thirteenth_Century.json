In recent years historians have developed increasingly sophisticated methodologies to illuminate the tangled layers from which the texts that describe heresy are built, but in the process have made the reading of heresy fractured and disconnected. Heresy and Heretics seeks to redress this by reading the different types of anti-heretical writing as part of a wider connected tradition, considering all the principal orthodox treatments of heresy. Set down in the mid-thirteenth century, a time when both medieval heresy and the church’s response to it were at their zenith, the material ranges from the theological arguments of some of the greatest thinkers of the age to the homely sermons of wandering preachers. In considering the whole scope of anti-heretical writing from this period, it becomes apparent that far from being an artificial construct isolated from reality, the church’s treatment of heresy had a much more complex relationship with its subject matter.Dr Lucy Sackville is Junior Research Fellow at Exeter College, Oxford.Cover: Codex Vindobonensis 2554, fol. 62v., Judges 15.

In this way, he was successful in converting a certain youngman to his belief. Once he was sure of the youth’s conversion, the heretic toldhim that, in fact, he did not believe the Gospels, nor indeed in any of the Scrip-tures that he expounded. Confused, the young man asked the heretic, why thendid you preach them to me? The heretic responded that, as a bird catchermimics the whistle, or the voice, of his prey in order to capture them because thesound of his own voice would frighten them away, so the heretics use the Biblein order to lure people from the Catholic faith.1The story appears in the vast collection ofexemplawritten by Stephen in themiddle years of the thirteenth century. It is a neat story, but with severaloverlapping layers, not all of which are immediately apparent. Most immedi-ately, it presents a first-hand account: a heretic preaching his error to thepeople in an effort to win converts. His preaching, which is at the forefront ofthe story, would seem to depend at least initially on a use and exposition of theCatholic Scriptures for its support. That use of Scripture, though, is a moreloaded image than it seems: first, it suggests literacy on the part of the heretic,and, secondly, it effectively constructs a pretended appearance for that heretic,and the idea that the public face of heresy is not the same as the one visible tothe initiated.Both the initial picture of heretics and their pastoral activity and theunderlying constructs of literacy and false appearance are aspects of a Catholicpicture that Stephen shares with most of his contemporaries, and ideas thatrecur throughout the corpus of anti-heretical literature. Their use here isdistinctive, though – indeed, the peculiar form of this story is unique toStephen – by virtue of their function within Stephen’s collection. Vivid similesare Stephen’s own stock in trade, so, even while this one seems plausible as theheretic’s own words, some suspicion is provoked by the placing of such asinister simile as the bird catcher’s whistle in the mouth of the heretic. Thatsuspicion is in fact confirmed by a quick glance at the immediate context of thestory, where the same whistle – the same imagery and the same vocabulary –was used by Stephen to build a general theme of pastoral care and negligencethroughout the rest of the chapter. Moreover, the heretic’s rejection of Scrip-ture stands in direct contrast to the accounts that Stephen gives earlier in his11Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus, p. 430; Stephen uses this same motif in book four, though in aless colourful form, p. 309.

It is thatcomplex layering within and among genres, and the construction of heresythat emerges from it, that form the subject of this book.The German historian Arno Borst, looking backwards from the 1950s, saw aclear and overarching pattern in the way that commentators and historianshad written about Cathars. In a long introductory chapter, ‘The Cathars in theMirror of the Sources and Research’, he traced a continuum of writing aboutthe Cathar heresy from medieval and subsequent writers to 1950. For Borst,each successive era and ideology shaped the history of this phenomenon afterits own image. Among Catholic and Protestant historians of the sixteenth toeighteenth centuries the heretics were regarded as the forerunners of theProtestant movement: from the Catholic viewpoint, they were representativesof the continuing presence of evil; for the Protestants, early manifestations oftheir own doctrine and a rival claim to the antiquity and continuity of theCatholic Church. To some later Marxist historians the heretics of the twelfthand thirteenth centuries were less the champions of religious dissent and morea symptom of class struggle as manifested in the context of a religious society.2Regardless of persuasion, in Borst’s view, commentators ultimately fell intoone of two broad groups: one dogmatic and systematic, with little love for theCathars, usually on the side of the inquisitors; one directed towards practicalmorals, which took a more sympathetic view of the heretics – the ‘friends ofthe Cathars’.Borst’s elegant rendering of this tradition, by now itself a canonical motif inreading the historiography of the subject, has been updated, expanded andadjusted in more recent surveys by Biller, which take into account Borst’s ownpreoccupations, but the portrayal remains a useful way of understanding thelongue duréeof writing about heresy.3In this view the history of heresy can beseen, to some extent, as the history of mainstream ideas, or at least a reflection ofthem, its image constructed and reconstructed according to the role it has played.If there can be said to be a common theme in recent scholarship then it hasbeen a focus on the nature and production of the texts themselves and anincreasing unwillingness to take the contents of those texts at face value. Incontrast to the phases described by Borst, historians of heresy in the last fortyor fifty years have been concerned to understand the mechanisms underlyingIntroduction22For the full version of this analysis, see A.

Certainly the difficulty ofanti-heretical texts in particular makes them (perhaps) susceptible to such anapproach, and has made a text-critical reading desirable and in fact necessary,as well as being part of the wider trend toward treating texts as a subject intheir own right.5However, in the case of the study of heresy specifically, thereare also deeper roots to consider.Bruschi and Biller’s introduction to their edited volume, which outlines thelong tradition of heresy scholarship and its relationship with text, makes itclear that one of the principal places we must look for the drivers of the recentemphasis on text as subject has been the increasing availability of the textsthemselves. Beginning in earnest with the work of Charles Schmidt in themiddle of the nineteenth century, and Célestin Douais slightly later, the fullrange of anti-heretical texts was made available to scholarship on heresy, andin particular this meant the recovery and use of inquisition texts. The workwas continued by the pupils of Schmidt and Douais, and by the end of thenineteenth century scholars were using the majority of what we would nowthink of as the core canon of material.6Underlying the focus on text, then, wasthe accumulation of what Nelson calls the ‘formidable dossier of primaryevidence’, built up further by the work of scholars such as Antoine Dondaine,through whose editions the texts themselves were made available, wherepreviously they had often been poorly known, or not known at all.7A wealthof information could now be brought to bear on studies of heresy, and of here-tics, though it was not until later that the nature of that information wasrevisited.If the increasing use and accessibility of source material provided the poten-tial for a text-critical focus to work on heresy and its repression, the work ofHerbert Grundmann provided the impetus and intellectual catalyst. Alhoughits impact was not immediate, Grundmann’s work on heresy was to proveinfluential in several ways. His bookReligiöse Bewegungen im Mittelalter, firstpublished in 1935, transformed the traditional treatment of heresy and main-stream religion as two separate entities into an approach which saw heresy as3Introduction4J. H. Arnold, ‘Inquisition, Texts and Discourse’, inTexts and Repression, ed. Bruschi andBiller, pp. 63–80.5In large part as a result of Michael Clanchy’sFrom Memory to Written Record. England1066–1307, 2nd edn (Oxford, 1993).6For a detailed account of this development, see ‘Introduction’, inTexts and Repression, ed.Bruschi and Biller.7Nelson, ‘Religion in “Histoire totale”’, pp. 61–2.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:17:41 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"one element in a broader continuum of religious groups and ideas, anapproach which has been taken for granted by subsequent scholarship.8Earlier than this, though, in 1927, Grundmann had published a ground-breaking article that outlined the rhetorical topoi that were employed by medi-eval authors of anti-heretical texts to describe their subject.9The article, ‘DerTypus des Ketzers in mittelalterlicher Anschauung’, argued that the spotlightought to be on the texts themselves, and on their representation of heresy, asconstructed entities that ought to be understood in a more complex way thansimply as records of what happened. This approach was further refinedthroughout Grundmann’s career by his article on the use of the term ‘literate’in the Middle Ages and by the appearance, almost forty years after that firstbreakthrough, of his study of the mechanisms of inquisition trial records andthe difficulties of interpretation posed by these deceptively straightforwarddocuments.10Despite the significance of Grundmann’s early work scholarship,in English-speaking circles at least, was slow to absorb its implications, and itsinfluence owes a lot to the initiative of Robert Lerner, who pushed for a trans-lation ofReligiöse Bewegungenand made effective use of Grundmann’s theoriesin his own work.11As in Borst’s later survey, the reflection of mainstream concerns was alsosomething Grundmann highlighted with regard to the texts themselves – thedanger that, in simply reproducing the material that the texts contain with noattention to how that material was arranged or filtered, the preoccupationsand perspective of the authors, the mainstream church, would be reproducedin modern scholarship. It was that concern which informed the new wave ofwork on heresy that began to emerge in the 1970s, when the focus began toshift away from what the texts had to say with regard to heresy and hereticsper se, and towards a desire to deconstruct the language and content of thosetexts to get at how they said it, and why, and how that affected our under-standing of the information they contained.This new trend, which sought to place the examination and critical analysisof text at the forefront, had perhaps been signalled in 1970 by an expanded4Introduction8H.

Cohn dealt again with heresy in his bookEurope’s Inner Demons(London, 1975), which was concerned with the ancient stereotype ofthe midnight orgy as applied to the heresy of the Free Spirit. Cohn showed the topos as astock image wheeled out against any politically dissenting or challenging group, although,unlike Lerner, he still saw the Free Spirit as a coherent group.13Ladurie’s methodology was critiqued effectively by Leonard Boyle, who saw the book aspaying insufficient attention to the context of the information or to the filters through whichit had passed into Fournier’s collection, L. E. Boyle, ‘Montaillou Revisited: Mentalité andMethodology’, inPathways to Medieval Peasants, ed. J. A. Raftis, Papers in Medieval Studies 2(Toronto, 1981), pp. 119–40.

Clifford and G. E. Marcus (Berkeley, CA, 1986), pp.77–97. The more deconstructive methodology was introduced by Lerner, inThe Heresy of theFree Spirit, and by G. G. Merlo,Eretici e inquisitori nella società piemontese del Trecento: conl’edizione dei processi tenuti a Giaveno dall’inquisitore Alberto de Castellario (1335) e nelle Valli diLanzo dall’inquisitore Tommaso di Casasco (1373)(Turin, 1977), pp. 9–15.

In this view there was no one authentic Waldensian tradition, butrather a rich and contrasted articulation, easily obscured by labels.20ClaireTaylor, unusually bridging both early and inquisition-period heresy, engageswith text-criticism and contextual material, weaving them together in a waythat does not require us to discard the whole substance of the texts’ content.21Further along the spectrum, Robert Moore’s work has been highly influen-tial in promoting an idea of heresy as partly or wholly constructed. TheOriginsof European Dissentpresents heterodoxy and orthodoxy as a struggle for powerand posited, broadly, that what we think of as heresy was in fact resistance tocentralizing authority expressed through religious means, either as dissent onthe one hand, or in the established church hanging onto tradition on theother.22In this reading ‘heresy’ was a collection of dissenting elements ratherthan a heretical movement per se and, moreover, a dissent that arose sponta-neously from developments in native spirituality (this argument standing inopposition to the thesis of eastern origin, since it is necessary for this readingto remove the possibility of that doctrinal connection.) The line ofOriginswastaken further still byThe Formation of the Persecuting Society, which, as CarolLansing observes, extends the idea that heresy must exist relatively to a viewof heresy as deliberately created by a Catholic bureaucracy to justify theentrenchment of their power and authority.23A similar approach has beentaken to eleventh- and twelfth-century heresy, always more problematic in its7Introduction18P.

As the title suggests, it explores the idea of heresy asa construct contained more or less entirely in the texts; a good example isBiget’s article on the literary creation by the northern French and Cistercianwriters of both the idea of the Albigeois as a centre for heresy, and the generalapplication of the name to various heretical groups.25Out of this text-criticalapproach, then, a tendency to view these texts in a deconstructive way hasemerged which has done much to improve our understanding of the texts andtheir significance and to undermine easy ventriloquism. It has led in severaldirections and with varying degrees of epistemological scepticism, in someinstances to a view of heresy as entirely constructed from or by its sources.Scepticism and a focus on text-criticism have brought with them a concomi-tant interest in laying out the subtext thus uncovered. The treatment of heresypresented by Brian Stock’s workThe Implications of Literacyis at once indicativeof this trend as well as influential in its own right in its re-reading of theevidence for heresy in the eleventh and twelfth centuries in terms of textualrelations.26Stock’s ideas focus more on the presence and use of texts than onthe nature of their content, but he is nevertheless concerned to unpick therepresentation of heresy to show what lies beneath once the veneer of rhetorichas been removed. In unravelling what the texts said to find what heresy actu-ally was underneath, the answer has often been a political one: Biget’s lengthy8Introduction24Lobrichon argued that the letter of Héribert of Perigord, a text that seems to warn of earlydualists, was in fact drawn from an eleventh-century document – not a letter, not written byHéribert – that was in reality a veiled, coded attack on the opponents of Cluniac reform, andnot at all about heresy – effectively, as Claire Taylor has pointed out, removing the documentfrom discussions of heresy. Subsequent to Lobrichon’s article, however, the discovery of anearlier copy of the text and the demonstration of problems in Lobrichon’s argument haveenabled Taylor to bring the text back in from the cold.

The ways in whichthe church wrote about and represented those they placed on or beyond themargins of orthodoxy need to be processed and untangled in order to readthem without, as Grundmann said, simply importing their perspective unchal-lenged. But that necessary deconstruction can, when taken to an extreme, leadto a complete unravelling of the construct or representation, to the dismissal ofthose elements identified as rhetorical or borrowed, and to an assumed discon-nect between that construction and the thing described. The underlying idea ofheresy, and the mechanisms that shaped and determined it, becomesecondary. Even where that is not the case, and the idea of heresy has beenexamined in many of the studies that we have looked at, the findings havebeen for the most part concentrated on particular fields of anti-hereticalwriting – often, but not always, inquisition materials.The focus here is on the idea of heresy, rather than what is underneath it,and how it is put together across a wide range of texts written within a shorttime of each other and within a broader shared tradition than that provided bygeneric conventions and inheritance. The principal aim here will be to look fornot what the sources can say about heresy so much as what they can tell usabout Catholic ideas of heresy that lie behind them: how and from what partsthe picture of heresy is put together, whether as part of a rhetoricalprogramme or at a more structural level. The ‘heresy’ to which it is addressedwill comprise, essentially, that which the contemporary church labelled asheresy. For the majority of the book heresy will remain undefined in order toexplore the ideas and patterns from which it is constituted and whichsurround its use, and ultimately to try and understand what is meant or signi-fied by the term. Two qualifications to this principle are, first, that, thoughseveral of our texts make reference to it, academic heresy will not be consid-ered here in a serious way, and the focus will be on movements with a broadfollowing; second, the terms ‘Cathars’ and ‘Catharism’ will be used as a delib-erate shorthand for the sake of convenience for those who called themselvesthe Good Men and Good Women, and for their religion.The best way to access the contemporary idea of what heresy was, and thepatterns and rhythms in which authors wrote about it, is to look across the9Introduction27In it he argued that the investigation was defined largely by political motives, in particularthose of Pope Boniface VIII and King Philip IV of France. For Biget, Catharism was connectedmore with political positions and interests of the officers of the king (who were Bernard deCastanet’s enemies in the process) than with a popular heresy. Similarly, inquisition in Albiwas also tied to politics, acting as an instrument of the church against the encroachment ofroyal power. J.-L.

Given that the aim here is to encompass as wide a range of material aspossible it is necessary to narrow the chronological scope from which it isdrawn. The existence of anti-heretical material for the most part remains irreg-ular until the middle of the twelfth century, through either accidents ofsurvival or gaps in either the occurrence of heresy or the commentary upon it.The origins of western heresy in the murky depths of the eleventh century arehard to divine, largely as a result of the slight survival of evidence from thatperiod. Twelfth- and thirteenth-century heresy was, in any case, very differentfrom what had gone before and after the mid twelfth century there is a contin-uous production of material in a greater variety of genres. By the mid thir-teenth century the major movements in high medieval heresy were wellestablished and widely known. A contemporary tradition of anti- hereticalwriting had been established and writers in this tradition were now able todraw more on recent experience of, and had a greater familiarity with, theheretics of their time, where previously writers had tended to look to theFathers for information and guidance.28Anti-heretical action had alsoexpanded to its widest range and, with the establishment and growth of papalinquisition producing records and treatises alongside those more traditionalareas of legislative action and polemical and homiletic writing, this was one ofthe highest and most diverse periods of Catholic activity toward and interac-tion with heresy; it is because of that richness of textual evidence that themiddle of the thirteenth century will form the focus of our study.This book is in two parts: in the first, four chapters will concentrate on onespecific generic group of texts.29The aim in these chapters is to establish abroad pattern for each group, their basic meaning and point of view, and toanalyse those groups in a way that gives common grounds for comparison.The second, smaller, part (chapter five) addresses the broader interpretativeimplications.The principal textual treatments of heresy in this period can be divided,roughly, into four generic categories: polemical texts; texts designed for edifi-cation; canon-legal texts; and inquisition literature. For the sake of reference,the specific texts chosen in each group are described in detail at the beginningof their chapter. Broadly, however, canon-legal texts covers general text-books, as well as specific anti-heretical legislation, while inquisition literatureis made up of texts specific to inquisition, rather than heresy in general, andincludes inquisitors’ manuals and procedural documents such as depositionsand sentences; the group that is called here ‘texts for edification’ is perhaps themost diverse of the four, containing, principally, preachers’ tools,exempla10Introduction28Biller, ‘Cathars and Material Women’, pp. 64–5.29The term ‘text’ is not being used here in the broad sense that Stock employs, of text as a set ofideas, but rather according to the more restricted sense in which it is used by John Arnold,as both a repository of fact and as a rhetorically constructed thing.

Most of the texts that are considered here derive,not surprisingly, from a southern French or northern Italian context, thoughsome of those could be seen to also have a sort of supra-national existence.11IntroductionThis content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:17:41 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:17:41 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"1To Avoid Evil: Anti-heretical PolemicMalum non vitatur nisi cognitum1After the letters and sermons that greeted the first mutterings of dissent in theeleventh century, by the mid twelfth the anti-heretical treatise had re-emergedin the medieval west with the quickening of heresy and the growth of theschools.2Early attempts, with the possible exception of Peter the Venerable’sContra petrobrusianos, tended to remain within the sheltering framework ofpreviously condemned heresy provided by the early church: Eckbert ofSchönau’sSermones tredecim contra haereticosof 1163–7, the first major work ondualist heresy in the Middle Ages, nevertheless drew heavily on Augustine’sContra manicheosfor authority and content.3The new trend in polemic, which moved away from a patristic and towardsa more identifiably ‘high-medieval’ mode, began in earnest around the turn ofthe century. The confession of the convert Bonacursus was reworked as apolemical tract against the Cathars; a text against Cathars and Passagiansproduced in Italy was an early scholastic response to heresy; and medievalanti-heretical polemic found its first known full-scale expression in Alan deLille’sDe fide catholica contra haereticos sui temporisof 1199–1202, a four-booktext that deals with heretics alongside other enemies of the church, here Jewsand Muslims.4Several mostly French works on heresy survive from the early131Brevis summula, p. 114.2D.

An ascription to James Capelli, lector at the Franciscanconvent at Milan, was made by Molinier, who, working from the Milan manu-script that bears James’ name, first described the treatise in 1888. Ilarino daMilano suggests that James may also have been an inquisitor, and certainlythere are indications that the author of this work may have been connected tothe process of inquisition. The ascription to James is not secure, however, andthe treatise was published as an anonymous work in excerpts, and then in itsentirety (by Döllinger and Bazzocchi respectively), from the Cesena manu-script, which has no ascription. The text survives in four manuscripts, while afifth, now lost, is documented in the 1381 catalogue of the Franciscan conventat Assisi.12Molinier and Ilarino da Milano both place this text somewherebetween 1240 and 1260, though Wakefield and Evans suggest, based onseveral passages comparable with thec.1241 Summa of Moneta of Cremona,that it was ‘prepared’ by about 1240: the possibility of a common source for theshared material would, however, reduce the significance of the comparison.13Wakefield also demonstrates the dependence of the author on earlier preach-ers’ manuals for much of the material that comprises the chapters on orthodoxbelief.14Disputatio inter catholicum et paterinum hereticum15This text is an exposition and refutation of Cathar doctrine framed within the15To Avoid Evil: Anti-heretical Polemic11Capelli,Adversus haereticos.

It seems tohave had a very wide circulation; Hoécker puts the number of extant manu-scripts at fifty-three. These fall into two families: a shorter Italian version, theversion that will be used here, and a longer, later French redaction, with addedmaterial on the Eucharist. The author refers to himself, in the eighth chapter, asa layman, but apart from this there is very little else known about him andthere has been some debate over his identity.16Martène and Durand, in theiredition of this text, marked the work as anonymous, but from a pun that hemakes on the etymology of ‘George’, we can at least assume that this was theauthor’s name.17Partly on this basis, Schmidt and Ilarino da Milano attributedit to the Dominican inquisitor Gregory of Florence, later Bishop of Fano, butDondaine, and with him Hoécker, have rejected this attribution.18Severalparts of theDisputatiocan be related to other texts contemporary with it. Onepassage on the transmigration of souls is found in both theDisputatioand theSummaattributed to Peter Martyr, for which Kaeppeli suggests a commonsource. There are also places in which a close resemblance can be demon-strated between George’s work and that of Moneta, and, though Borst rejectsany relationship between the two, the similarities would seem to suggest atleast some level of dependence or relationship.19Ilarino da Milano dates theDisputatioto shortly before 1250; Wessley suggests that an earlier date canperhaps be inferred from references to the death penalty within the text.Hoécker places this text in the first third of the thirteenth century, at somepoint between 1209 and 1234.20Liber suprastella21The author of theLiber suprastella, Salvo Burci, was a native of Piacenza, amember of the notarial family ‘Burcius’ and, according to Bruschi, probably16Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century16Disputatio, p. 46.17‘Falso enim ero GEORGIUS, si terras domini mei non excolam’;Disputatio, p. 47.18C.

Like the author of theDisputatio, Salvo was a layman and, though hewas not a scholar, he was certainly schooled. TheLiber Suprastella, dated veryprecisely to Sunday, 6 May 1235, was commissioned by Monachus de Cario.Bruschi points out that the de Cario family had close links with the Speronifamily, whose name had been compromised by associations with heresy, andsuggests that this commission was the de Carios’ attempt to assert their ortho-doxy. The book is apparently a response to a heretical work by the name ofTheStar, hence the title, and is a rather rambling and incoherent work nominallydealing with all heresies, but really with the Cathars and the Waldensians. Itsprologue is written by a separate author who was apparently trying to imposesome kind of generic identity on a text that the editor characterizes as a vari-able and above all hurried composition, written ‘di getto’. The text is extant inone manuscript only, recovered by Döllinger in 1890.22Summa contra hereticos23AnotherSumma contra hereticos, this survives in two manuscripts, both Italianproducts of the thirteenth or early fourteenth century. It has been studied indepth by Kaeppeli, who places the date of the text in the region of 1235 andsuggests the ascription to Peter Martyr. The author was certainly a Lombardand a Dominican, and clearly very familiar with heretics, and Kaeppeli’s casefor Peter’s authorship, though conjectural, has been convincing to otherspecialists, including Dondaine and Caldwell, and will be assumed here forthe sake of convenience.24It is clear from internal references that theSummaisintended to be in four parts, though in neither manuscript is the fourth partextant, and part of the third is also missing, or perhaps was never finished.Neither manuscript contains the text’s prologue. The Perugia manuscript has atable of contents that shows the text divided into titles, and further subdividedwithin those, though these divisions are not apparent in either manuscript,both being devoid of any rubrication or navigational apparatus. Nevertheless,the text has a clear plan that is sustained throughout, and which Kaeppelilikens to that of Moneta. The first book is against the errors of Cathars, orrather Patarines, with regard to the credo and the sacraments, and ends with ashort defence of the consumption of meat, eggs and cheese; this book takes uptwo-thirds of the text as it survives. Book two refutes the errors of five groups17To Avoid Evil: Anti-heretical Polemic22In Florence, Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana; see Salvo Burci,Suprastella, pp. xxix–xxxii.23Kaeppeli, ‘Une somme’, extracts on pp. 320–35.

Moneta’sSummais clearly the work of anaccomplished and well-read academic: it is a complex theological and scholas-tic treatise. Peter’sSummais similarly learned and similar in approach, thoughit uses dialogue more freely and is more lively than Moneta’s. The work of thePseudo-James is also a learned work, especially in those parts that refute heret-ical doctrine. The two lay texts are not without learning, though Salvo’s workis perhaps a little more lacking than George’s, which is a relatively sophisti-cated theological work; however, both seem to reflect a less formal arena ofdiscussion. For the most part these works address Cathar heresy; thePseudo-James and George exclusively so. Although Moneta and Salvo bothclaim to treat Catharism and Waldensianism they both give far greater spaceto the former. Peter Martyr’s text aims to encompass all heresies, and does sowith more success than the others, but the errors of the Cathars are his mainconcern – even the heretical voice of the shared errors of the third partfrequently sounds dualist in tone. Despite the differences in character, though,the similarities in the structure of these texts and in the ways that they repre-sent their subject are such that several common features in their constructionof heresy stand out, and none more so than that of heresy as an educated andintellectual phenomenon.Each of Moneta’s chapters is devoted to one point of heretical error andlooks like a standard scholastic response to a problem of contradictory inter-pretations. He first systematically addresses all the authorities and argumentsthat are used to support that error and sets up the heretical argument as thethesis. He then presents the Catholic position in terms of counter-argumentand solution, working through and refuting the points made. The exchange istherefore presented as an argument that alternates between two positions,indicated ascontraandsolutio. The Catholic position always, of course, offersthe final resolution of the problem. The same dialectical, systematic structure isadopted by Peter Martyr, the Pseudo-James and George, though presented inthe latter two within a framework of spoken, rather than written, debate, andin the first by a mixture of the two. This method is less apparent in the struc-ture of Salvo’s treatise than in those of the other writers, but his work still has astudied texture of academic method: he tries to respond to each point in turnand refute from authority, and he uses scholarly terminology.18Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century25Ibid., pp. 298–301 and n. 5.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:20:05 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The heresy presented in these exchanges is therefore one of complex theo-logical ideas that proceed from a basis in authority. For the most part the prin-cipal source of those authorities is Scripture, and in almost every case thatauthority is drawn from the New Testament, although Moneta’s hereticalopponent makes substantial use of Old Testament material as well, and PeterMartyr seems to expect that the ‘Patarine’ will make use of both Old and NewTestament authorities.26Occasionally, the texts show the heretics makingreference to patristic writers such as Augustine and even Chrysostom, butsuch occasions are not common and usually appear because the hereticalopponent is citing those writers not in support of his own point but as a proofused by his Catholic opponent.27Moneta does, though, include a Cathar argu-ment based on adictumof Aristotle, and the reliance onauctoritatesis alsobolstered in places by a use of logical arguments and arguments drawn fromnatural philosophy. Moneta, Peter, the Pseudo-James and Salvo all includeheretical positions supported byrationes, and both Peter Martyr and his oppo-nent also make use of Aristotle: he is the most cited of the secular authorities inPeter’s text, and in fact language and arguments of this type are much more atthe forefront of this text as a whole.28One of the few surviving Cathar texts,theLiber de duobus principiis, which uses both Aristotle (or rather a text that itsauthor believed to be by Aristotle) and Roman Law as source material, wouldseem to support these representations.29Presented as a series of doctrinal19To Avoid Evil: Anti-heretical Polemic26‘Quia nusquam reperies in veteri vel novo testamento’; Peter Martyr, Conv. soppr. MS 1738,fol. 4r. Andrew of Florence states that he will use authorities drawn from both Old and NewTestaments in defending Catholicism and confounding heretical depravity. In places heseems to expect his heretical opponent to reject these proofs, once reinforcing his point witha quotation from Peter ‘si prophetam nolles recipere’ and, in his final chapter, on bodilyresurrection, switching from Old to New Testament proofs ‘quia de veteri testamentoquedam induximus, heretice, ad probandam resurrectionem contra insipientiam tuam, quimalitiose negas eandem’, pp. 12, 130. Nevertheless, he uses the Old Testament freely in hiswork, the book of Isaiah and the Psalms especially, and the heretical positions that he setsup also seem in places to rely on Old Testament proofs.

If heresy in these sources is something expressed in academic terms, allthe polemics share the conviction that heresy is also something that can also beanswered in those terms.The learning, or otherwise, of heretics was not at this stage an unprece-dented aspect of anti-heretical writing. The heretic asilliteratuswas indeed oneof the more prevalent elements of the re-emergent anti-heretical polemic of thetwelfth century, the general pattern of which was to emphasize, and perhapsoverstate, the ignorance of the heretics in question, principally through the useof words such asrusticusandilliteratus. Although it is important to remember,as Grundmann made clear, that in this contextilliteratusprincipally indicatedthat a person was not Latin literate, rather than unable to read altogether, incontrast to our texts the use of that term is still significant.30Examinations ofthis topos have revealed two levels to the accusation of illiteracy; the principalelement was a general division between the educated church and ignorantheretics, while a further distinction was sometimes made among the ranks ofthe heretics (when the internal constitution of a sect was under discussionwithout direct reference to the Catholic Church) between the cunning, sophis-tical leaders and their simple and deluded followers.31That duality repre-sented the main line of the earlier Catholic attacks on heresy, the effect, if notnecessarily the aim, of which was to neatly sidestep the need to deal with theerror closely: it invalidated the heresy because the ignorance or superficialityof the heretic precluded its having any real substance, dismissing the error bydismissing the capability of its proponents. The one partial exception to thisearly pattern was theContra Petrobrusianosof Peter the Venerable, in which,according to Iogna-Prat, Peter employed a ‘defensive argument’ that allied amore argumentative approach to the solely imprecatory style of his contempo-raries.32The earlier attacks were thereforead hominem, focused on the heretic’sbehaviour and personal qualities, and included little engagement with, orextensive reporting of, error.The application of this device was not uniform: it had a weak tradition innorthern French polemic but continued to be strong in the south of France20Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth CenturyRaniero Sacconi describes John of Lugio using not only the whole Bible, but also naturalphilosophy and Roman Law: Raniero Sacconi,Summa, 31–60 (pp. 53, 56, 54).30H.

Where it did maintain astrong tradition, well into the thirteenth century, was in German discussions ofheresy, in the several handbooks written for inquisitors, though, perhapssignificantly, the principal concern in this region was with Waldensianism.33The thirteenth-century polemical treatment of Cathar heresy, which emergesfrom an Italian context, abandoned this imagery and no longer centred on thesimple duality of literate churchmen/illiterate heretics. In the first place, themanner in which these texts engage with their subject represents a departurein its own right. Unlike the earlier polemical approach, which rarely discussederror, the later texts engage precisely with that error and little else. Where thethirteenth-century construct also departs from most of the earlier material, andwhere Catharism seems distinguished from descriptions of Waldensianism inparticular, is in its depiction of heretical use and application of Scriptural andoccasionally philosophical knowledge. What is striking, therefore, is not onlythat the heresy, or rather the Cathar heresy that these texts present, is a learnedphenomenon, but also that it consists primarily, and in fact almost entirely, ofdoctrinal and theological error, rather than the more externalized, behaviouralerror of belief presented by earlier texts, or indeed by some of the other genresto be considered later.Vestiges of the language of that topos linger on in the thirteenth-centurypolemics; despite the impression of learning that is carefully and deliberatelycreated through these polemics a certain amount of invective that paints boththe heresy and heretics as stupid, or foolish, finds its way into theDisputatio,the Pseudo-James and theLiber suprastella. It is most common in the latter two– Salvo manages to call the heretics foolish six times in seven lines.34The typeof language exhibited here is much more restricted in the sober prose ofMoneta and Peter Martyr. Wherever it does occur in our polemics, though, it isbelied by the manner in which each of these texts engages with its subject,which always presents a learned doctrine grounded in text and text-production, and even occasionally with learned individuals who either createor transmit that doctrine.

But it is also not coincidental that texts that areresponding to heresy in a northern Italian context, as these polemics are,should present a different sort of texture and tone.Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay’s history presents a picture of Languedocbefore the crusade, where preaching and debate and the exchange of lists ofauctoritatesandrationesbetween the opposing parties were common. In Peter’saccount the participants vary from Catholic preachers to Cathars andWaldensians and also include lay observers of either Catholic or hereticalsympathies.36By the middle years of the century that picture to some extentremains valid, and public debates between heretical and orthodox figuresseem to have been common in northern Italian cities, as they had been insouthern France in preceding years. Paolini points to two famous publicdebates that took place in 1260s Vicenza between the Cathar and Catholicbishops of that city. Salvo himself tells us that the Albanenses andConcorrezenses met often to resolve the schism between them, providing afurther layer of contact and conflict in the debates that appear to have beenfrequent between the different Cathar churches.37But while heretics are oftenseen to debate with each other – whether Cathars with Waldensians, ordifferent factions of either with each other – more pertinent to our discussion22Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century35Doctoresandmagistribegan to appear among the Cathar ranks from the end of twelfthcentury. In a letter preserved in Matthew Paris’sChronica majoraYves of Narbonne, tellingof his induction into Cathars secrets, relates that the Cathars told him that they sent their‘capable students’ to Paris from most Lombard and some Tuscan cities, to study logic ortheology, in order to bolster their own error and overthrow the Catholic faith.

Mendicant hagiography provides one obvious example:St Dominic can be seen with some frequency to enter into debate with heretics,and though in St Dominic’s case the accounts refer to an earlier period, lateranti-heretical saints such as Peter Martyr and Anthony of Padua can likewisebe seen disputing publicly with the heretics.38But debates are visiblethroughout the wider mendicant tradition: one Franciscan inquisitor nearRome publicly questions a heretic on his beliefs about creation and salvation.39The picture presented by these sources is reflected in the inquisitionrecords; the penances of Peter Cellan, in particular, present many occasionswhere deponents report having witnessed adisputatio, or heard that someonedisputavitabout points of faith. One layman ‘debated with the Friars Minorwhether man ought to kill’ on the basis of what he had learned from theWaldensians. Another describes accommodating three heretics for a day and anight, during which time ‘there was a dispute between them and the priest ofthat place for almost the whole day’.40This ‘disputatiousness’ is identified byPaolini as a characteristic of the Cathar groups, and one that had troubledCatholic commentators, such as Joachim of Fiore, for some time.41Even as lateas the 1320s Bernard Gui was warning less experienced scholars not to be tooready to take heretics on in public.TheDisputatiois consciously presented by its author as proceedingaccording to ‘the manner of the heretics’, ‘more hereticorum’, understood inthis context to mean the scholastic method of dialogue in which the text isconstructed.42The fact that a layman can use this phrase as a shorthand for23To Avoid Evil: Anti-heretical Polemic38For examples of St Dominic and Peter Martyr in debate, see below, p. 83; L. de Kerval (ed.)Sancti Antonii de Padua vitae duae quarum altera hucusque inedita(Paris, 1904), pp. 220–21.39P.

It points to a general familiarity with, and recog-nition of the condition of, heretical learning among his readership, which, tojudge from the manuscript tradition, seems to have been wide, as well as anexterior existence to this learning, rather than simply a superimposed rhetoricalframework. It also suggests a familiarity with heretics debating.The two lay texts are both presented as tools for personal encounter withheresy, George’s as a weapon, Salvo’s as a defence against wiles, but bothsuggest contact and open debate. ‘You have heard, Christians, a blasphemy ofthe cross!’ exclaims George, before refuting the heretic’s latest error.43Theseveral connections between the texts both of Moneta and of the Pseudo-Jameswith theSummae auctoritatumthat are discussed in the next chapter mightsuggest that these, too, were closer to the real work of repression than is at firstapparent; a text closely related to this set of polemics, theQuaedam obiectiones,of which more shortly, seems indeed to contain one of thesesummaeas anintegral part. This is not necessarily to argue that the polemicists intendedtheir work for a scholarly heretical readership – Moneta is not talking toheretics but rather to an orthodox reader, despite the fact that he seems toaddress his heretical opponent throughout his long refutations – but it mightsuggest that, while their ‘proximate’ audience was orthodox, heretics nonethe-less formed part of the ‘ultimate’ audience for these texts.44A more physical suggestion of use might be found in a miniature copy ofMoneta’sSumma, to be found in a late thirteenth or early fourteenth centurymanuscript of the Bibliothèque nationale, Lat.3656. The latter is a tiny book,smaller than a modern sheet of A5, filled with notes and glosses and the occa-sional manicule pointing to relevant parts of the text. It is even slightly moreminiature than the portable Bible of the Bibliothèque nationale manuscriptLat.174 that contains the first of Douais’Summae auctoritatum.45Another rela-tively small copy of (most of) Moneta can be found in Vatican manuscript Reg.Lat.428, which also contains Raniero Sacconi’s handbook. The Florence manu-script of Peter Martyr’sSummais minute, only 154mm by 105mm.46Thedimensions of these manuscripts evoke the ready portability of the vade-mecum books used by travelling preachers. The echo of an arena of verbalexchange and debate, much more immanent in theDisputatio, in Salvo and, toa lesser degree, in Peter’ssumma, suggests that the polemicists – certainly theauthors of the lay texts, but also the others – involved as they were in the early24Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth CenturyMartyr argues with his uncle: ‘patruus nisus est ei probare per auctoritates, morehereticorum, quod dyabolus ista creaverat’;Vitae fratrum, p. 236.43‘Audistis, Christiani, blasphemiam crucis!’;Disputatio, pp. 4, 72.

While theenvironment of northern Italy provides a plausible context for the occasionallymore active texture of the polemics, however, with its disputatious hereticsand high levels of lay literacy, it also supplies a more reliable source of contentfor the heretical material that the polemical authors argue against.50Thoughthey rely on each other and borrow and import text from a variety of Catholicsources, the polemics can also be seen to use books produced by heretics in theconstruction of their texts.Stephen of Bourbon, drawing on his experience as a Dominican and inquis-itor in southern France in the middle of the century, relates a story in which asouthern French noble, Robert of Montferrand, who died in 1234, had, overforty years, carefully collected books from all sects, including those of the localheretical groups.51That books containing the Gospels and the New Testamentwere owned and revered by heretical groups of this period is attested by theraggedy survival of a few such texts, and by their presence in reports of ritualsperformed by sect leaders, but, beyond the ritual function of sacred texts,heresy can also be seen to generate and exist within a written tradition all of itsown.52Heretical books, not just of Scripture but also of doctrines and accompa-25To Avoid Evil: Anti-heretical Polemic47M.-H.

Raniero Sacconi uses a book written by the heretic John of Lugiowhich he says is a ‘a large volume of ten quires, a copy of which I have. I haveread it through and from it have extracted the errors cited above’. Anselm ofAlessandria likewise owns and uses heretical books.53For one of the polemicists the idea of heresy as something found in a book isa deliberate part of the way heresy is presented: Moneta makes his access toand use of heretical texts explicit at the very beginning of his work when hetells us that his information comes either from their own mouths ‘or from theirwritings’. He refers several times to different anonymous texts and also usestwo texts by named individuals: Tetricus, an absolute dualist, and Desiderius,a mitigated dualist attested in other sources, whose work was also owned andused by Aquinas.54Moneta is alone in citing a heretical book explicitly, but thepresence of such texts can be felt through and beneath most of these polemicalworks.Like Moneta, Peter Martyr also acquires information from conversationwith heretics and cites converts as a source; in several places he mentions aheretical bishop named Peter Gallus. Though he never mentions a text weknow that Gallus was the author of at least one treatise; he is well attested as aCathar scholar and writer in other sources, including the work of AlbertusMagnus, and Kaeppeli thinks it likely that Peter had some of Gallus’ writingsin front of him as he composed hisSumma.55The title of Salvo’s book wouldappear to define the entire work in terms of a specific heretical text; theprologue to theLiber suprastella, written by a different author, explains the titleof this work by reference to a heretical treatise namedThe Star, to whichSalvo’s book is a reply: the higher star. Salvo himself makes no mention of thistext, but the book’s modern editor nonetheless sees Salvo as being in some partreliant on a heterodox text, importing elements from it which stand out in tone26Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century53‘Quoddam volumen magnum X quaternorum, cuius exemplarium habeo et perlegi et exillos errores supradictos extraxi’; Raniero Sacconi,Summa, p. 57; trans.

The process is clearest in the work of Moneta, who employsheretical works throughout as a template for his response, working systemati-cally from the text being refuted. That use is explicit where Moneta makesdirect reference to proofs found in the writings of Tetricus, for example, butmany of the heretical doctrines and expositions that Moneta refutes arepresented in such detail as to also suggest the presence of a text.This working method in Moneta can be illuminated by comparison to ananalogous text entitledQuaedam obiectiones hereticorum et responsionesChristianorum; it is a much smaller text than Moneta’sSumma, but one whichhas close connections with it.57The first part of this text, which Wakefieldbelieves may be an extract from a longer work, is principally concerned withan extended response to Cathar objections to the God of the Old Testament.The refutation begins with the statement that ‘the objections of the heretics inthis chapter proceed from four roots’, and the author then follows thatfour-fold framework systematically, quoting and answering the heretical arti-cles with the same method and the same level of detail as Moneta.58Wakefielddemonstrates the close relationship of theQuaedam obiectioneswith the sixthchapter of Moneta’s second book. The prologue is almost identical with thebeginning of Moneta’s chapter, although the use of the terms ‘Albigenses’ or‘Bugari’ where Moneta’s version uses Cathars leads Wakefield to suggest thatthe Doat text is more likely to be of French origin. The relationship between thetwo lies neither in the group names used for the heretics nor in the refutations,but rather in the statements of heretical argument, and it is Wakefield’sopinion that both authors had access to the same written source of hereticaldoctrine.59The use by both authors of the same material to create differentresponses again suggests that engagement with pre-existing heretical sourcesdrives the argument and informs the structure of the orthodox polemic.The pattern that we see in theSumma adversus catharos et valdensesand in theQuaedam obiectionesis repeated in the other texts, which all present their oppo-nents’ views in great detail. It would certainly substantiate the importation of a27To Avoid Evil: Anti-heretical Polemic56Salvo Burci,Suprastella, p. 3. The title of theLiber Suprastellawould seem to presuppose theexistence of a heretical text, but Bruschi suggests that perhaps the prologue writer wastrying to make some sense out of the rather strange title; Bruschi has alternative suggestionsfor its source: Salvo Burci,Suprastella, p. xxii. Those elements that seem to derive from aheretical tract are collected by Bruschi into an appendix (pp. 449–72); Ilarino da Milano alsoargues for Salvo’s direct knowledge: reference in Paolini, ‘Italian Catharism’, p. 100, n. 77.57TheQuaedam obiectionesand its relationship to other texts is discussed in more detail in thenext chapter.58‘Obiectiones hereticorum in hoc capitulo ex quatuor radicibus procedunt’; Doat 36, fol. 92r.59Wakefield, ‘Notes’, p. 300, n. 65, and pp. 307–8.

Beside the shared textual inheritance, the statement also presents uswith the notion that heretical groups read and understand those texts and in away that can provide the basis for discussion or argument.63The fact that theheretical doctrines discussed by the polemics can be seen to derive from heret-ical texts, at least in part, must indicate to some extent that the academicframework that the Catholic texts use was not just a structure into which theideas of their opponents were artificially inserted, but a format common toboth. Heresy is presented in these texts, deliberately and without exception, asa set of doctrines expounded according to scholastic principles, generated byand sustained in the contemporary idiom of intellectual debate, and, though itreaches its fullest expression in Moneta’s work, the same pattern runs througheach of the polemics. The interaction and exchange visible in these texts is asignificant factor in the representation of heresy as learned, but also seems toreflect an established tradition of debate and argument from authority rootedin an independent textual tradition among their heretical opponents. Theheretical texts and ideas that can be seen to underlie the polemics seem to be ofa kind that would fulfil the criteria for a reception and use of learning thatPatschovsky outlines in his examination of Waldensian literacy in this period,namely: a productive application of knowledge by an intellectually active28Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century60Paolini, ‘Italian Catharism’, pp. 100–101.61Kaeppeli, ‘Une somme’, p. 325, n. 38;Disputatio, p. 27, n. 64.62Moneta,Adversus catharos, p. 71; Paolini, ‘Italian Catharism’, p. 101.

Clearly, if it is necessary to present an opponent ascapable not only of learned exposition, but of exposition of a common text,then the struggle becomes about two opposed readings, and which is domi-nant. Though there is still invective, the real polemic is elsewhere in ourauthors’ representation of the exchange between heretical and orthodoxdoctrine.The principal reconciliation of the problem of a learned heresy with itsinherent wrongness occurs through the continuing emphasis that all ourauthors place on interpretation. This takes place at the most basic levelthrough the manner in which these texts are structured: in couplets of hereticaland Catholic exposition. Each text consistently reinterprets the authoritiesused to support heretical arguments before going on to outline a statement ofthe orthodox position, offering refutation both by statement of Catholicdoctrine and by Catholic reinterpretation of heretical exposition. The sameexchange between interpretation and re-interpretation remains the generalpattern even in the more loosely structured text of Salvo. The fundamental roleof correct interpretation is further emphasized by the concessions that aremade where an overlap occurs: Moneta and George will both acknowledge thecorrectness of the heretical interpretation where it coincides with the orthodoxone; in theDisputatiothe heretic is allowed to make similar concessions to hisorthodox opponent.65Where previous polemics would, if they dealt withheretical error at all, tend to report it as necessary information, the Catharismpresented by these texts consists almost entirely of doctrine. In the course ofthat construction exegesis is presented and recognized as the medium of theconflict; this heresy is learned, but it is also an error of learning.So Moneta tells his opponent that ‘it is clear that you understand badly’ orthat his ‘understanding is perverse’, usually at the introduction of his alter-nate, Catholic, reading. The interpretation of the shared Scriptural basisoffered by the heretics is shown to be based on a skewed, perverse or simplywrong understanding. The exchanges between Peter Martyr’s two opponentsare nearly always conducted in terms of rival interpretations, and both accuse29To Avoid Evil: Anti-heretical Polemic64Patschovsky, ‘The Literacy of Waldensianism’, pp. 116–17.65Moneta,Adversus catharos, p. 82.

Moneta also makes allowance for heretical disagreement overinterpretation, where the heretic questions Catholic interpretation; Moneta,Adversuscatharos, p. 12.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:20:05 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"the other of getting it wrong. In one exchange, on wisdom, the ‘heretic’remarks: ‘it is natural that the church of God should have little wisdom,especially in letters’, before wryly enumerating all the instances in the Scrip-tures in which simplicity is extolled over wisdom and worldly knowledge,allowing him in the process to call Peter and John ‘unlettered, and ignorantmen’. The ‘Catholic’ responds in kind, explaining that it should be understoodto mean that only wisdom that is contrary to faith is to be avoided, and that itis therefore ‘clear that you, heretics, are all ignorant men, especially in theScriptures’.66Pseudo-James begins his responses to heretical statements in asimilar style: ‘we shall prove your exposition to be false’, as does George: ‘theworst understanding’. Salvo echoes George, ‘in this case they have the worstunderstanding’, though, like Moneta and George, he allows his heretical oppo-nent to make the same claim of ‘it is not to be understood that ...’ against theCatholic proposition, perhaps again imported from heretical text or speech.67They do not understand, and so they are unable to reach the patent truth ofCatholic teaching, against which heretical exposition is always set: ‘youexpound badly ... but it is to be understood thus’.68The emphasis on interpre-tation is in itself is a development from the previous polemical trope, identi-fied by Biller, in which heretical stupidity is demonstrated by their inaccurateunderstanding or misunderstanding of the Latin itself; now their Latinity isaccepted, only their interpretation of it questioned.The idea is extended where the lack of understanding that results in somuch misinterpretation is shown to be the result of overreaching, or connectedin some way to a fault of human reason operating without the guidance offaith: ‘they are separated from the learnedmagistriof the Roman Church’.69Moneta makes an oblique attack on this level: he condemns the use of the Aris-toteliandictum‘the principles of contraries are contraries’ and other termi-nology derived from that philosopher by his heretical opponent, but later, inbook five, he also makes a substantial attack on Aristotle in his own right. Thatattack is more explicit and more extended in the Pseudo-James, who links30Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century66‘Patet quod male intelligis’; ‘perversam intelligentiam’; Moneta,Adversus catharos, p. 86,also pp. 79, 138, 22, etc. ‘Sed naturaliter quod ecclesia dei debet habere parvam sapientiammaxime de litteratura’; ‘sine litteris, et ydiote’; ‘patet quod vos, heretici, estis omnes ydiote,maxime in scripturis’; Peter Martyr, Conv. soppr.

Exchange over the correct interpretation of authority is the usual mode in this text –that which discusses the prohibition on swearing is a case in point, fols. 110v–111v.67‘Falsam esse vestram expositionem probabimus’; Capelli,Adversus haereticos, p. lxii; alsopp. iv, cxlv, clviii, clxv, cxcvi, cci etc. ‘Pessimum intellectum’;Disputatio, p. 13, also pp. 15,28, 41, 56 etc. ‘In istis rebus habent pessimum intellectum’; ‘non est intelligendum quod ...’;Salvo Burci,Suprastella, pp. 8, 13, 70 etc., and from the heretic, p. 13.68‘Male exponitis ... sed ita intelligitur’;Disputatio, p. 13.

The academic nature of the heretical argumentsis answered in kind by the polemicists, and the refutation of heresy is treatedas, and framed within, a dialectical exercise. These polemics do not criticize thefact of books and learning in their presentation of heresy, only the error of theinterpretation contained within them – an approach broadly in line with thegeneral conception of heresy within broader currents of thirteenth-centurytheological thought.Peter Lombard’sSentences, the standard textbook of theological educationfrom the 1220s onwards, asks the question ‘What makes a heretic and what aheretic is’, and answers it with two quotations.74The first, from Hilary, makes31To Avoid Evil: Anti-heretical Polemic70‘Contrarium contraria sunt principia’ (broadly: the starting-points of things that are contraryto each other are themselves contraries); Moneta,Adversus catharos, p. 23.

By the time Aquinas had cometo address heresy in the middle of the thirteenth century, as part of his longtreatise against the enemies of the church, theSumma contra gentiles, the idea ofheresy as an interpretative error had become firmly entrenched. Aquinas’approach in this text is similar to that of the fourth Lateran council in somerespects, in that he first defines the ‘truth’ and then outlines all other opinionsas wrong by definition, as it were, in contrast to the Catholic reading. Thismeans that, where there is an overlap in understanding, the church is able toagree with some heretics while standing against others, although their contin-uing condition as heretics might suggest that there is more to their status thanerror.76Aquinas distinguishes between heretics and Catholics in terms ofattempted understanding on the one hand and diligent reading on the other.The emphasis is placed firmly on interpretation, even more so where authori-ties used by Arius, Sabellius and Plotinus are reinterpreted in scholastic modein order to demonstrate that the authorities are sound, and only the interpreta-tion wrong.The previous approach, which allowed the dismissal of heresy via the igno-rance of its authors/followers, therefore now gives way to a presentation of adeveloped exegetical and textual tradition based on educated method andmeans, which accepts and engages with this tradition. The tension that thiscreates – between the presence of a learned doctrine based on the same foun-dation as Catholicism on the one hand, and on the other the fact that heresymust be condemned as false and foolish – is resolved in the shift of emphasisfrom a result of ignorance to an error of learning. The path to correct – that is,Catholic – understanding is careful attention to the text.77The diligent reader32Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Centuryassured, and once Alexander of Hales had begun lecturing on the text a decade later, thetext, and the principles contained within it, began to be diffused throughout the academiccommunity.

This division extendsbeyond the distinctions made between different groups; the groups them-selves are also internally divided. All the texts, with the exception of theDisputatio, divide the Cathar beliefs into a minimum of two camps, and some-times more, but always on doctrinal grounds, to create a picture of a varie-gated set of ideas and doctrines.79That picture of division is in part achievedthrough the structure of the texts themselves: Moneta devotes book one to thearguments of absolute dualists, book two to those of mitigated dualists andthree and four to the arguments of both. The Pseudo-James is initially organ-ised in a similar way (the division of the later parts is less strict), and theauthor also draws comparisons between different groups – one group thinks(x), though others think (y), and they all agree on (z): ‘opinions are diverseamong them’.80Although the first part of Peter’s treatise is aimed at Patarinesas a group, he too is careful throughout to delineate the different strands oferror within the group as a whole, and this is done consistently, even thoughhe never gives them individual group names. TheLiber suprastellais not reallyorganized around this principle, but it nonetheless describes divisionsbetween the groups and in fact does so in more detail than the other texts here,which are concerned with such distinctions mostly in terms of the organiza-tion of their own texts. Salvo describes a greater complexity of division,dealing with the different churches of the Albanenses, of Concorezzo and ofBagnolo. Like his fellow Piacenzan Raniero, Salvo describes the rivalrybetween the Albanenses and the Concorrezenses – not only a division betweenchurches, but also an irreparable divide.The brief treatments given to Waldensianism also take care to distinguishbetween different groups. Peter gives a brief history to explain the rift betweenthe different Waldensian groups that he describes, before describing theirdifferent errors.81Moneta is likewise careful to provide different proofs against33To Avoid Evil: Anti-heretical Polemic78‘Cuius expositionem diligens lector falsitatis potest arguere’; Capelli,Adversus haereticos,p.cxlv.79TheDisputatioseems to deal specifically with the doctrines of one of the Italian Catharchurches, perhaps the Bagnolenses; da Milano identifies George’s opponent with thisgroup, ‘Fr. Gregorio, O.P.’, 85–140 (p. 114); and so doDisputatio, p. xiv, and Wakefield andEvans,Heresies, p. 289. Raniero places this group at Mantua, Brescia, Bergamo, Romagnaand (a small number) Milan. This is not one of the largest Cathar groups, only about 200 intotal according to Sacconi’s account: Raniero Sacconi,Summa, p. 50.

While the polemicists are little concerned to talk about anything otherthan doctrinal points, there is nonetheless an assumption that there is a wider,identifiable group that contains these distinctions within itself. At a most basiclevel all these texts present their subject material as a group, an identifiablebody that can be given a name. All use the word ‘sect’ to describe the Cathars;the term ‘Cathar’ appears sparingly, but most of the authors rely on othergroup names, except for Moneta and the Pseudo-James, both of whom tend torely more on the generic ‘heretic’.84Salvo tends to use the names of the indi-vidual Cathar churches when naming his subject, while Peter Martyr and theauthor of theDisputatiouse the northern Italian name ‘Patarines’, thoughGeorge will more usually use the rather old-fashioned ‘Manichee’. Discussionof the heretics is rarely any more concrete than the use of these group names,but the odd traces that do appear reinforce the impression of a coherent bodyinternally divided, but which nonetheless has common features and attributes.The Pseudo-James’Summaincludes a brief and incongruous section thatdeals with the customs and lifestyle of the Cathars themselves, a section thatthe author acknowledges as a digression which departs from the otherwisedoctrinal content of the work.85Here, the Pseudo-James presents his readerwith a detailed account of hierarchical structures found in the Catharchurches, which include different orders, sacraments and rituals. The descrip-tion is presented as a general structure that applies to all the different Cathargroups.86Moneta likewise speaks about heretical sacraments and gives adescription of a common Cathar hierarchy as elements common to all; he alsomakes some reference to a common Cathar history.87TheLiber suprastellaassumes a common structure across all groups in the hierarchies of the Catharchurches.88Each of the polemicists is more concerned to talk about theirsubject in terms of a variegated but structured system of belief, and it is not34Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century82Moneta,Adversus catharos, pp. 402–8.83For example, Salvo Burci,Suprastella, pp. 69, 259–62, 288–9, 363, 424–6.84Capelli,Adversus haereticos, p. xcv.Disputatio, p. 3.

The hierarchical and way of life information givenby the Pseudo-James, for example, reflects the account given in RanieroSacconi’s text, which also presents a picture of Catharism as a highlystructured and hierarchical organization, and gives details of their sacramentsand orders, as well as the doctrine that lies behind each of these. But thegeneral impression of division and the descriptions of internecine conflict,such as the schism between the Albanenses and Concorrezenses, also matchwhat we see for the region in other sources.89According to accounts in thehandbook of Anselm of Alessandria, and in the anonymousDe heresicatharorum in Lombardia, that division was long-standing and had come aboutafter the visit of a Bogomil leader, papa Nicetas, in the 1160s. Subsequent to hisvisit to the west, say the authors of both texts, there were two schools of Catharthought: the absolute dualists, who believed in two eternal creative principles,and the mitigated dualists, who held that there was only one eternal principle,but two creators. Most of the Cathars of southern France converted to theformer variety after Nicetas’ mission, but in Italy there remained deep dividesbetween, and indeed within, the two groups.90Whether or not this story isaccepted at face value, the divisions between northern Italian Cathar groupsare fundamental to most descriptions of the region, and the polemics, all prod-ucts of Lombardy, all represent to some degree a similar picture of an inter-nally divided Catharism.However, if the fundamentally divided nature of heresy that these textspresent reflects what can be seen of their regional context, it is also occasion-ally made to serve another purpose. The third part of Peter Martyr’s treatisebegins with a list of reasons by which the Catholic Church can be shown to bethe true one. His sixth reason, that the church should be universal, discountsheresies on the grounds that they are particular and regional.91For Salvo andthe Pseudo-James the internal divisions of the Cathars also serve a polemical35To Avoid Evil: Anti-heretical Polemic89Salvo Burci,Suprastella, pp. 5–7.90De heresi catharorum in Lombardiais edited by Dondaine, ‘La hiérarchie I’, 280–312 (pp.306–12); Anselm of Alessandria,Tractatus, pp. 309–13.

Salvo draws the same conclusion after discussing the northItalian schism: ‘in one body there are great divisions. Whence it is clear thatthey are not the Church of God, and this is read in the Gospel: Every kingdomdivided against itself shall be made desolate. Therefore it is clear that they arethe church of the devil.’92This latter is one of the criteria on which the Anony-mous of Passau defines the true church, from which qualification the hereticsare excluded on the basis of their divided nature.93Standing in contrast to thisis a sense of the Catholic Church as a unity, from which the heretics are alsodivided. If Salvo feels that the heretics are the church of the devil this is‘because they were first, through Baptism, of the Roman Church; they cannotdeny this’.94Peter likewise defines heretics as those who are separate from thefaith, having once been part of the true church.95The Pseudo-James puts ‘here-tics, wandering from the unity of the catholic faith’ together with other groupsexternal to the Catholic faith, Saracens and other ‘people who are damned’.96TheDisputatio’s Patarine does most of the work in this regard, building apicture of a unified Catholic body through references to ‘your’ Augustine orGregory, and ‘your’ Pope, though George himself also talks of Catholic unityand of the division of the heretics from it.97Heresy is therefore defined by division, both within its own ranks and fromthe Catholic Church. If three of the texts occasionally exploit this division forpolemical purposes, or tie it into a wider idea of the difference between churchand outsiders, on the whole it passes without comment, since the polemicistsare more interested in error than in the condition of those groups thatsubscribe to that error, though the division they describe implies and indeednecessitates a larger unity. Rather, the organization of the texts and theirdescriptions of their subject create an impression of heresy as inherentlydivided and composite, a structured system of belief that is defined by divi-sions based on doctrinal difference.The concentration on heresy as a series of intellectual errors of under-standing and the textual basis and milieux of the polemical material, together36Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century92‘Ab invicem cum litigatione dissidentes ut per hoc manifeste heretici comprobentur’;Capelli,Adversus haereticos, p. cxii. ‘In una quaque persona sunt divisiones magne.

There are occasional appearances by some individualhistorical heretics, such as Tetricus, or Andrew the medic, or Peter Gallus, butthey function more as authorities within the texts. The heretics to whom thepolemicists address their responses and refutations are rhetorical creatures.The ‘rhetorical’ heretic is most obvious in theDisputatio, the format ofwhich demands the construction of a heretical opponent to argue against thesimilarly abstracted Catholic, but a similar principle is at work in the othertexts. Each of the polemics constructs exposition and refutation as dialogue,often in the same mode as that used by George: a ‘Catholic’ and a ‘heretic’speak their own position in the first person and address the other in thesecond. Only in theDisputatio, though, is the heretic consistently given afirst-person voice. The other polemicists switch between that first- andsecond-person mode of dialogue and one which observes both positions froma third-person perspective: ‘the heretic says’, ‘the Catholic says’. In bothmodels the speaker is usually identified clearly in the rubric. So, theSummaofMoneta uses a label ofhaereticusto indicate heretical ‘speech’ and present theerror under discussion, and the authors of both theLiber Suprastellaand theSumma contra haereticosboth present heretical doctrine as spoken by someunspecified third person or persons. The heretical positions in Peter Martyr’stext are expounded by a ‘heretic’, or, in the first part, a ‘Patarine’, the responseby a ‘Catholic’. These heretics are hypothetical, abstract mouthpieces createdto give voice to the doctrines and errors gleaned from books or debate, thoughthere may be an echo of a genuine voice heard in discussion or in a text in theforte dicentformula used by Moneta, Salvo and George when positing apossible heretical statement. But the academic tradition of debate in whichthese texts are written necessitates the creation of these figures and the ‘here-tics’ are primarily a rhetorical device that allows presentation of items fordiscussion.Because it serves as a vehicle for ideas and not as the subject in itself, theheretical character is for the most part very thinly drawn. There are few of therhetorical flourishes that we tend to expect in an anti-heretical text, which havebeen placed at the forefront of our memory of the texture of these materials by,on the one hand, Grundmann’s brilliant article, and on the other the pushinessand colour of the images that are used by contemporary writers. The authorsof polemics will occasionally liven up their debate with some of that imagery,including a small but reasonably consistent equation of heretics with serpents,but, while they were immersed in the anti-heretical tradition of their time, as awhole they employ the standard topoi of that tradition rather sparingly,largely because they are pertinent more to behaviour and actions and with theheretics themselves than to error.98Where this sort of imagery is brought to37To Avoid Evil: Anti-heretical Polemic98See below, p. 177.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:20:05 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"bear the polemicists tend to rely most on the theme of false appearance, char-acterizing the heretical figures as inwardly evil, in direct opposition to theirouter piety.The contrast between inner and outer conditions was by this time alreadyan established trope of anti-heretical writing which centred on the associationof heretics with the Biblical figures of the false prophets and the wolf insheep’s clothing.99For the most part in the polemics, though the wolf image isoccasionally used, the depiction of heretics as cloaked, disguised figures is themore general form in which we find false appearance. The text that uses thistopos the most is, unsurprisingly, the always more colourfulSumma contrahereticosof the Pseudo-James, which is unusual enough in its quantity relativeto the others to warrant a brief digression.Traditionally, the Pseudo-James’ work has been seen as remarkable for itsmoderation. The impression of moderation, however, relies on only a fewpassages in the text: a description of the ritualconsolamentum, to which thePseudo-James appends a dismissal of accusations that the Cathars actively killthose who submit to the rite; and a discussion of the Cathar position on matri-mony, where he again defends them again against accusations of physicalimmorality. These two passages are among those shared with Moneta’s text,but Moneta does not attach the same moderating pleas as the Pseudo-James.The tone of the work as a whole is hardly in keeping with this reading and,even taken in isolation, these passages seem less concerned with restoring theCathars’ injured reputation than a first glance might suggest. Though theauthor admits, and even insists on, the austerity of Cathar life, he then usesthis to identify them as the false apostles that Paul describes in Corinthians. Assuch, they are also those that ‘have the zeal of God, but not according to theknowledge of God’, and so lead others astray both by their teachings and by‘exaggerating the malice and bad morals of clerics’. Using their asceticism toprove their error, rather than simply denying it, the author is able to morefirmly and authoritatively reject their claims.100Similarly, though they arechaste, this is only a physical chastity: ‘spiritually they fornicate and adulteratethe word of God, however much their bodies may be chaste’. The authorrejects the rumours of fornication because it is the persecution that they haveendured on that account that allows the Cathars to claim apostolic status,while at the same time he rejects the basis on which the Cathars observe thischastity: ‘they are all bound by their superstitious and false religion ... to thevow of continence’.101If he accepts the external truth of the Cathars’ piety, he38Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century99II Peter 2; Matthew 7. 15.100‘Emulationem dei habent sed non secundum scientiam dei’ (Romans 10. 2); ‘maliciammalosque clericorum mores exaggerantes’; Capelli,Adversus haereticos, p. cxxxix.101‘Spiritualiter fornicentur et verbum dei adulterent, tantum castissimi quidem suntcorpore’; ‘supersticiosa siquidem, et falsa religione ... ad continentiae votum astring-untur’; Capelli,Adversus haereticos, pp. clvii–clviii; trans.

In other words,the Pseudo-James manipulates the topos of false appearance to bring a prob-lematic element of Cathar appeal within the bounds of his theological andexegetical discussion and make it available to dismissal on the grounds ofinterpretation.It is in this mode that false appearance operates where it appears in theother texts as well. It appears usually in connection to the learning of hereticalfigures and is to do with their leading astray of the simple-minded. Monetawarns that what seems like natural or logical reason is really sophistry; it isdeceptive.102George, too, sees the Cathars as duplicitous (though his Patarineseems to hold the same opinion of the Catholic church).103The Pseudo-James,as we might expect, has the most to say on this subject, calling the Catharspseudo-preachers and characterizing them as deceptive.104Only Salvo is ableto offer something more optimistic: even the stupidest people can see howheretical the heretics are.105As with the issue of heretical learning, it is used toreconcile what the heretics appear to be with what they should be, though thetheme of false appearance more broadly has roots in the competition betweenCathars and the Catholic clergy for the appearance of holiness and zeal.The main features of heresy in mid thirteenth century polemic are largelyabstract. Above all, heresy is a learned thing, a series of doctrinal articles and astructured body of thought characterized by division but conceived in andexpressed through an academic mode. The trend that was seeded by Eckbert,whose reliance on Augustine in answering heresy was nonetheless framedwithin an academic style of Scriptural exegesis, now occupies the mainstream,replacing the previously dominant Cistercian model. Both the manner inwhich the authors address the heretics in their texts and the way in which thetexts are arranged attack heresy on the basis of interpretation: that is, theyaddress the content of the heresy, not the condition of the heretic. More thanthis, if we can accept that it is more likely that these authors were allresponding in their own way to a common opponent than that all of them,from trained theologian to over-zealous layman, were simultaneously seizedby a common compulsion to be the next Augustine, then we must also seelearning as a received element in the polemical construction of heresy. That isto say, that heresy is presented as learned because that was the guise in whichit was encountered – that the polemicists were in contact with the wider ‘tex-tual community’ of their local heretics and that this encounter, whether39To Avoid Evil: Anti-heretical Polemic102Moneta,Adversus catharos, p. 23.Disputatio, pp. 13, 58, 70.103Disputatio, pp. 14, 56.104Capelli,Adversus haereticos: pp. xviii, xciii, civ; also pp. cxv, cxxi, cxxxix, clxxxvi.105Salvo Burci,Suprastella, p. 349: ‘bene potest videri et etiam ab ydiotis quod estis pessimierretici’.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:20:05 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"written or oral, is as much a part of the source material as the anti-hereticaltradition.106Given that the heresy the texts address appears to be at least inpart drawn from encounters with heretical discourse either in spoken or, moreprobably, written form, it would seem that the increased influence of scholas-tic modes of argument on the response of the church was also operating in thework of their heretical opponents.40Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth CenturyThis content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:20:05 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"2To Retreat from Sin: Texts for EdificationPer hoc a peccatis recederent et bonum appeterent1It is a standard rhetorical trope, even in the polemical texts, and certainly inmuch of the legal material, to couple the coercive repression of heresy with apositive movement to reinforce Catholic teachings through word and example.Of the texts that talk about heresy in the mid thirteenth century a significantnumber are the product of that impulse: the impulse to correct and instruct, toedify and pre-empt that was part of the preaching revival of the thirteenthcentury. That drive by the papacy to improve the preaching offered by theCatholic church, and to control the right to preach more carefully, can beunderstood as in part motivated by heresy.The landscape at the turn of the century featured heretical and other‘pseudo-preachers’ as well as those sanctioned by the church, and preachingwas a significant part of those group identities, central to the ideal of the apos-tolic life promoted by church and espoused by heretics and others.2Althoughtowards the middle of the century the church had won the centre ground, ithad not secured it, and preaching and the correct enactment of thevitaapostolicaremained a tool in ‘the race between the institutional church and itsrivals’ to control lay piety.3Whether this was to be achieved through therepression of heresy by specifically anti-heretical preaching or through thepromotion of an orthodoxy informed by heterodox challenges, it depended onthe increased manpower and expertise offered by the mendicant orders and onthe production and proliferation of new texts developed to support preaching,a ‘rhetorical system ofars praedicandi’.4411Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus de diversis materiis predicabilibus, Corpus Christianorum,Continuatio Mediaevalis 124/124B, 2 vols.

Thesecond two groups are more general in scope: first, the collections ofexemplathat were coming into use in the mid thirteenth century, designed as a tool forpreachers, to be used alongside the more traditional proofs of Scripture andreason in the construction of sermons;5and, lastly, a number of Dominicantexts, written by members of the order for the benefit of their brethren, thatdeal with heresy and that provide further context for many if not most of thetexts that are dealt with in this and the previous chapter. The three sets form anecessarily broad and more loosely defined category than the polemics; theiraim is more often the edification or improvement of their ultimate audiencesthan attack, and heresy is not necessarily their principal focus.Summae auctoritatumTheSummae auctoritatumbelong to the species of texts that were developed toaid preachers, and are directed against heretics. They are, in essence, lists ofBiblical materials and references that could be used to prove or disprove aseries of different points of doctrine, under which headings the contents areorganized. The main examples from our period that will form the basis of thissection are all mendicant productions and come from northern Spain, southernFrance and northern Italy. Of these, five have been edited by Douais in hisLaSomme des autorités.Summae I, II, III6A‘summa’ in several pieces: Douais’ first text is in the end folios of anAragonese pocket Bible, probably Franciscan, while the second two are in thefirst folios of an even smaller French Bible. Because the last three chapters of Ioverlap with the first three of II, Douais regarded these two as representingtwo fragments of the same text; III he saw as a complementary text.742Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century5J.

We will therefore considerthese three texts in conjunction with each other, as Wakefield does, as twocomplementary texts, theSumma contra haereticos et manichaeos, made up ofDouais I and II, and theSumma auctoritatum de sacramentis ecclesiae, representedby Douais III.8Wakefield dates these texts to the early to mid thirteenthcentury, around 1225–50.Summa IV9An anti-hereticalsummain a Dominican manuscript of the second half of thethirteenth century, to which period Douais also dates the text. He describes themanuscript as southern French and suggests that it was probably made at theDominican convent at Toulouse. The manuscript also contains other Domin-ican theological works.10Brevis summula contra herrores notatos hereticorum11Anothersummafrom the second half of the thirteenth century in an Italianhand, again contained in a pocket Bible, whose calendar indicates a Franciscanorigin. Douais suggests that the other contents of this manuscript, togetherwith thesummula, show the whole to be aimed specifically at preachingagainst heresy.12Thesummula, originally thought to be of great significance tothe study of Catharism, has since been shown to be less important owing to itscomposite nature. Dondaine showed that what Douais labelled as part three ofthesummulain fact reproduces an inferior version of an earlier Lombard text,theDe heresi catharorum. Dondaine instead divided the text into six parts: a43To Retreat from Sin: Texts for Edification47 della Bibliothèque municipale di Albi).

Wakefield andEvans agree with this assessment, but they add that the fourth part does sharecommon characteristics with the catalogue and the refutation, and that the lastthree elements represent the work of one author. Wakefield also points to thesimilarity between the second part and part of Moneta’s text, positing either acommon source or even an adaptation of Moneta himself.14The date of thecomposition of this work is therefore problematic, but it was probably puttogether in the decade after 1250, although perhaps as late as 1270. The lastpart, then, the refutation, still provides a contemporary analogue to our othertexts.Quaedam obiectiones hereticorum et responsiones Christianorum15Copied by the Doat scribes from a small manuscript in the Carcassonnearchive, theQuaedam obiectionesis a French text that is connected both toMoneta of Cremona’sSummaand to Douais IV. Wakefield considers theQuaedam obiectionesto be in fact two texts, though there is no indication fromthe Doat scribes that this text should be considered as something other thanone whole: there is only one set of the usual introductory and concluding notesthat give information about the source, and they bracket the whole of this text.Döllinger makes no distinction between the first and second halves in theextracts that he publishes, though Duvernoy also thinks that the text was origi-nally two separate pieces. Whatever the relationship, the second part of theQuaedam obiectionesis a fuller version of Douais IV and therefore part of thesame family ofSummae auctoritatumto which that latter text belongs, probablydating from the second half of the thirteenth century.1644Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century13Dondaine, ‘La hiérarchie I’, pp. 294–302. Dondaine points out that both Douais and thetext’s other editor, Molinier, had never questioned the unity of thesummula.14Wakefield and Evans,Heresies, pp. 351, 749, n. 9; Wakefield, ‘Notes’, pp. 306–7.

The differences in the section titles and in the references used showthese to be of a different family, but they nonetheless display the same struc-tures and concerns in their composition.The first three of Douais’Summae, which we are treating together, and the twosummaein MS Lat.14927 of the Bibliothèque nationale are lean, skeletal crea-tures. They contain little quotation and no exposition (except in one instance),and are really no more than lists of Scriptural references arranged under head-ings that describe their purpose: for example, ‘in the first chapter it is provedthat the father, and the son, and the holy spirit are one substance and oneGod’.18Their meagreness is quickly explained by their location, in the endleaves of small ‘pocket’ Bibles. The Bible into which Douais I is copiedmeasures only 193mm by 133mm; that which contains Douais II and III is evensmaller, only 170mm by 120mm.19Thesummaeof 14927 occupy the first foliosof a small collection of anti-heretical texts that measures 226mm by 165mm.20Their inclusion in these manuscripts places them squarely among the ‘small,portable “vade-mecum” books ... produced in great numbers to meet theneeds of the itinerant preaching friars’.21As Douais says, their inclusion here issuggestive of their use as portable tools of reference, but their necessary listform also means that it is not clear which part of the reference was supposed tocarry the force of refutation, or indeed what interpretation the preacher wouldhave placed upon it.22Aside from ideas about their function that can be gained from their manu-script context, in fact, these list-likesummaecannot by themselves tell us muchabout how they were used. However, theSumma contra haereticos et manichaeosand theSumma auctoritatum de sacramentis ecclesiae– that is, Douais I and II andDouais III – belong to a family of texts that has some plumper relatives,namely Douais IV and the second half of theQuaedam obiectiones hereticorum etresponsiones Christianorum. Wakefield has demonstrated that three chapters ofDouais IV bear a marked resemblance to chapters in Douais II, one of which isnearly identical, a resemblance that he feels must indicate a direct relationship45To Retreat from Sin: Texts for Edification17BnF MS Lat 14927, fols. 2ra–3rc; fols. 3rc–7rb.

He further observes that the second part of theQuaedamobiectionesis in fact a fuller version of Douais IV, though the chapters, and inplaces the sequence of authorities, are not always the same.23The fourth of Douais’Summaeis similar in style and structure to the firstthree: it too is a collection of Scriptural authorities arranged under headingswhich describe the argument that they can be used to prove. The chapters alsofollow a similar sequence to Douais I, II and III, presenting expositions ofCatholic doctrine as challenged by the implications of Cathar ideas, in a struc-ture built around Catholic principles.24Though still in essence a list of authori-ties these are presented not as a series of citations but as part of an exposition;the references are usually quoted in full and here the interpretation or argu-ment that derives from them, missing from the first three texts, is often givenas well, for example: ‘Mt.VI [26]: “Behold the birds of the air, for they neithersow, nor do they reap, nor gather into barns: and your heavenly Father feedeththem.” Therefore creatures are his work.’25Douais IV appears not in a portable book but in a manuscript containinggeneral theological works, a version of its shorter cousins that was perhapsless intended for use in the field. Whether or not theQuaedam obiectionesoughtto be seen as two separate texts as Wakefield suggests, its second part nonethe-less provides another rendering of the expanded text, and as members of thesame family as the more instrumentalSummae, both it and Douais IV can beseen to represent a version of what these might have ultimately looked likeonce expanded and employed by a preacher.26We can look to the additionalmaterial provided by these two, and, by extension, by theBrevis summula,therefore, for a more precise idea of the function of the group as a whole.Thesummaetake the form of series of chapter titles, more or less elaborated,that describe points of Catholic doctrine. Heresy exists in these texts in nega-tive, reflected in the doctrines defended and the choices made for inclusion. Asummary of the titles of Douais I, II will quickly demonstrate the hereticalideas underlying them. While the first chapter of Douais I, II, the longest of thetext, is concerned to prove the triune nature of God, the next three chaptersaddress God’s creative role in a manner that is unmistakeably a response tothe contemporary dualist doctrines of creation that we know from other texts:God is creator of all that is visible and invisible; He is not only creator, but alsothe maker; God fashioned the [nature] of Adam, Eve and all bodies, an action46Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century23Wakefield observes that other texts of this sort, which cover the same areas, use differentauthorities, and he feels that this overlap in content and order must indicate dependence;Wakefield, ‘Notes’, pp. 300–301 and n. 65, 307–8.24One chapter of the sacramental section is suggestively concerned to prove ‘quod homo nonsit adorandus’; Douais,La Somme, p. 106 [IV].25‘“Respicite volatilia celi quoniam non serunt, neque metunt, neque congregant in orrea, etPater vester celestis pascit illa.” Ergo creature sunt opera eius’; Douais,La Somme, p. 67 [IV].26Douais implies that these short, condensed works acted as complements to longer, moredetailed informative works, though he does not say this explicitly;La Somme, p. 13; see alsoWakefield, ‘Notes’, pp. 300–301.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:22:10 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"described here with the very physical verb ‘plasmare’.27The subsequent chap-ters similarly reflect dualist doctrines, asserting first the legitimacy of thoseOld Testament figures traditionally rejected by the Cathars (along with muchof the Old Testament itself) as agents of the evil principle before moving on tomount a defence of the human soul, of several New Testament figures and ofChrist’s humanity.Chapters nineteen and twenty, ‘that God pours new souls into new bodies’and ‘that the soul – not an angel – is in the body’, together with twenty-three,‘that angelic spirits remained in heaven after the fall of Lucifer’, make a fairlycomprehensive treatment of the Cathar idea of the soul as a fallen angeltrapped in a human body by Lucifer.28Chapters twenty-five and twenty-sixaddress the contention made by some Cathars that Mary was not a physicalbeing, stating not only ‘that the most blessed Mary was a woman’ but also‘that blessed Mary had a father and mother’.29The chapters on the nature ofChrist insist very strongly on his physical existence, also denied by Cathardoctrine, a denial that prompts, in the course of the chapter on Christ’sassumption of flesh from the Virgin, the only substantial piece of prose in thissumma: a vitriolic attack against a ‘insane and raving chief of heretics’ whichroundly dismisses the idea that Christ had only an ‘imaginary body’, andwhich is reproduced in the anti-heretical treatise by the Pseudo-JamesCapelli.30Douais III and Douais IV and theQuaedam obiectionesare constructed alongthe same lines. Even though the focus of Douais III is exclusively on the sacra-ments of the Catholic Church, chapter titles such as ‘that baptism is beneficialwithout the imposition of hands’ and ‘that men are [= can be] saved in carnalmatrimony’ clearly show the Cathar challenge underlying these statements of47To Retreat from Sin: Texts for Edification27’2: Probatur quod Deus qui est trinus personis et unus in essentia est creator omniumvisibilum et invisibilum; 3: probatur quod Deus omnipotens non solum est creator setethiam [sic] factor; 4: probatur quod omnipotens Deus Ade et Eve et aliorum corporumnatura[m] plasmavit’; Douais,La Somme, pp. 36–7 [I].28‘Quod Deus novas animas infundit novis corporibus’; ‘quod anima est in corpore, nonangelus’; ‘quod spiritus angelici remanserunt in celo post lapsum Luciferi’; Douais,LaSomme, pp. 45–7 [II].

In their expression and structurethese articles are presented as positive Catholic statements of faith, but thetitles of these texts nonetheless direct them ‘against heretics’ and, even werethat not the case, it is easy to retrieve the underlying construct of heresy onwhich the Catholic statements rest. Broadly, that construct is one whichconsists of a series of points, here given a Catholic unity by the framework inwhich they are set, which is based around the structure of Creation, Old Testa-ment, New Testament, Resurrection and Catholic sacraments. This is not somuch heresy itself, but heresy as it impacts on Catholic doctrine.The refutation of theBrevis summulais unusual in its arguments in its freeuse of Old Testament authorities where the other texts restrict themselvesmostly or entirely to the New Testament, a fact that is surely attributable to itsItalian origin. Raniero’s account of the Italian Cathar churches says that someof them accepted parts of the Old Testament as valid, and the texts that accom-pany theSummulasimilarly make it clear that the Italian Cathars’ rejection ofthe Old Testament was not total. That John of Lugio, whose teaching acceptedthe Old Testament in its entirety, is mentioned here as a source, is suggestive.32The use of the Old Testament by theSummulaat the same time serves to high-light further the almost complete absence of this material from the Frenchsources. Despite the concern demonstrated by Douais I, II, Douais IV and thetwosummaeof 14927 to prove the legitimacy of the Old Testament as a sourceof authority, their defence rests almost exclusively on New Testament authori-ties.33Where Old Testament authorities are used, and this is rare, they appearalways at the end of the list of authorities.34The predominance of New Testa-48Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century31‘Quod baptismus prodest sine manum impositione’; ‘quod in matrimonio carnali hominessalva[n]tur’; Douais,La Somme, pp. 59, 61 [III].32Raniero Sacconi,Summa, pp. 51–3;Brevis summula, pp. 116, 121. The identification of thisheretic as the John of Lugio that Raniero describes is not entirely secure; see Wakefield andEvans,Heresies, p. 748, n. 3.33It may show, as Iogna-Prat demonstrates for Peter the Venerable in the Cluniac tradition(and Vicaire for Lugio in the Cathar), a desire to expand the base of reference for debate.

At the same time, he described theSummaeas collectionsof witnesses used by preachers against heretics, alongside the Bible, which hadthe same virtue for attack as for defence.35These texts could be seen in eitherlight. The refutation of heresy in theBrevis summulasimultaneously provides adefence of Catholicism.36Certainly, the later author of the prologue saw thetext as being aimed at the reinforcement of the faithful, the protection of thevineyard from the foxes; he emphasizes that those outside the faith are lost,and that people must be prevented from being led away by heretics – aconcern with the defence of the flock, rather than an attack on those outside it.Douais IV presents the truth of Catholic doctrine as automatically excludingany different belief; ‘it is clear by manifest reasons that faith is the foundationof virtues, and the highest good, and the first principle; and that there shouldbe no division in it’.37However much their statements of Catholic doctrine would appear to lendthemselves to preaching to the faithful, theSummae auctoritatumin severalplaces provide material more for debate than for sermonizing and raise ques-tions about the nature of the context in which these texts addressed error. TheBrevis summula’s prologue proposes the defeat of heresy by the example ofgood works, but also speech and authorities. More interesting, the refutationitself urges that Scriptural supports be demanded from heretics if they presenttheir argument without: ‘if the heretic says the contrary, say to him that heshould show you through divine Scripture. If he says that he cannot, say thathe strays foolishly from faith.’38If the polemics of the previous chapter can49To Retreat from Sin: Texts for EdificationDouais,La Somme: i p. 36, iiii p. 37, vi p. 38, xvi p. 44, xix p. 45 [I, II]; xvi (penultimate) p. 62,xxii pp. 64–5; chapter II, xxviii p. 49 [III].35Douais,La Somme, p. 113 [IV].36Brevis summula, pp. 133–42.37‘Patet rationibus manifestis quod fides est fundamentum virtutum, et primum bonum, etprincipium; et quod in ea non debet esse divisio’; Douais,La SommeIV, p. 113. The samepattern appears in a much earlier example of this genre, which likewise responds to a heret-ical point by reinforcing the Catholic position; Manselli, ‘Una “Summa auctoritatum”antiereticale’, text ofSummain Appendix, ed. F. Šanjek, pp. 355–95. This ‘summa’ is really acollection of fragments, inserted between the other texts in the manuscript – two Biblicaltexts, the Song of Songs and the Acts of the Apostles, and several patristic commentaries –which nonetheless seem to constitute something approaching a coherent body of workagainst heresy, specifically that of the Cathars. According to Manselli there are someconnections between this work and that of the convert Bonacursus, pp. 335–6. The text isanonymous, but Šanjek believes thesummato be in a late twelfth, possibly early thirteenthcentury hand, either from Catalonia or Languedoc.38‘Si herethicus [sic] dicit contrarium, dices ei quod ostendat tibi per Scripturam divinam.

And just as thesummaeare able to provide material forthose polemics as well as for preaching, the debate of points of belief is a plau-sible context for the authors and users of theSummae auctoritatum, whether it iswith undecided laity or with the heretics themselves. The one section of prosein the otherwise spare text of Douais I, II contains a suggestion, nothing more,of the text’s use. The author, in a manner also typical of the anti-hereticalpolemics, sets out the heretical proposition before offering a rebuttal. After thisstring of proofs is finished comes the line: ‘but now let them, subverters of thetruth, respond again’, to which end more proofs are supplied.39It is only ahint, but one that can be amplified by the longer texts.The written text of Douais IV is intended for a Catholic audience: ‘youshould note, o Catholic, that heretics say this’. The author of this text neverthe-less frequently employs direct address towards the heretics: ‘if you wish tosay, heretic’; ‘o worthless heretic’; ‘you cannot give ...’.40The refutation sectionof theBrevis summulaalso occasionally uses a vocative/imperative to addresshis heretical ‘opponent’.41However, while these heretics must of course berhetorical, there are indications of a more active function. There is, forexample, a great deal of the type of debate rhetoric similar to that found in thepolemics, such as words and phrases that mean ‘clearly’ placed after exposi-tions.42More suggestions of exchange can be seen at the very end of chaptersixteen of Douais IV, after the last Biblical citation: ‘at this point the hereticshould respond, because if he did not truly suffer, he did not truly rise again’;and again, after a quotation in chapter twenty-three: ‘if however the hereticshould say that ...’.43Significantly, the explicit to Douais IV advocates debatewith heretics as a means of defending the faith.44If Douais IV’s extended version of the lists of authorities suggests that weunderstand these texts as tools for attack, then a stronger suggestion is to be50Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Centurydicat quod non potest, dicas quod stulte deviat a fide’;Brevis summula, pp. 115, 138.

Here we not only find all the same echoes ofdispute as contained in Douais IV, including the explicit urging confrontation,but the even fuller exposition of the authorities presented by this version alsoprovides a further indication that this text was to function in a context not onlyof debate but of active debate. The chapter that argues the point ‘that an oathcan sometimes be taken without sin’, after presenting and expounding itsauthorities, then bids the reader to ‘note, in this article, there are four ways toproceed against a heretic’. There then follows an explanation of the four stagesin which this particular argument can be constructed, including questions thatcan be used to prove the heretic wrong.45The purpose of the lists of authoritiesgiven by this text and its relatives was, at least in part, to be used in the disputewith heretics that the explicit in fact advocates. The last section of theBrevissummula, although it is a fuller text with greater amounts of exposition, is verylike the othersummaein its character. Where it departs from the others,though, is in the presentation of its arguments and refutations: these areoffered as explicit contradictions of the Cathar doctrines that are outlined inthe catalogue of errors, in a framework of chapter headings that begincontraprimum,contra secundum, and so on. The first chapter is headed ‘against thefirst: the heretics say that there are two gods and two principles’, rather thanthe sort of reverse statement ‘there is only one God’ that we might expect fromthe other texts. The underlying presence of error is much more foregroundedhere than in the other texts.46At this point the significance of the several textual connections thatWakefield outlines between theSummae auctoritatumand the major polemicaltreatises of the period becomes apparent. The closeness of these two groups, sosimilar in their style, extends also to more direct relationships. The author ofthe Pseudo-James Capelli usedSummae auctoritatumof the family to which thefirst four Douais texts belong in the construction of several of his chapters onCatholic doctrine. Less dependent relationships can also be seen with Monetaof Cremona’s treatise, where Moneta seems to share some source material withboth theQuaedam obiectionesand theBrevis summula.47If the two parts of theQuaedam obiectionescan be seen as a whole then the implications for theconnection between the polemics and theSummaeare significant, but even ifthis is not the case then the fact that they are presented by the Doat volume asa coherent whole contained in one manuscript would suggest that they were51To Retreat from Sin: Texts for Edification45‘Quod iuramentum possit aliquando fieri sine peccato’; ‘nota in hoc articulo quatuor modisprocedit contra haereticum’; ‘primo ut quaerens ab haeretico si iuramentum est peccatumita quod nullo casu possit bene fieri qui respondebit quod sic, cui Catholicus respondebitfornicatio est tale peccatum sed Deus non potuit benefieri’; Doat 36, fols. 181r–181v.46‘Contra primum: dicunt heretici quod sint duo dii et duo principia’;Brevis summula, p. 133.In Šanjek’sSumma auctoritatumheretical propositions are used in several places as thestarting point against which the authorities argue, for example: ‘auctoritates contramanicheos qui vetus testamentum restituunt [et] respuunt’; Šanjek, ‘Una “Summaauctoritatum” antiereticale’, p. 365.47Wakefield, ‘Notes’, pp. 301–4, 306–8.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:22:10 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"closely associated in the original. A more concrete example of such an associa-tion is the manuscript that contains the two shortsummae, mentioned above asanalogues to the first three of Douais’ texts, in MS Lat.14927 of theBibliothèque nationale. The twoSummae auctoritatumare followed by anextract from theDe heresi, after which there appears a fragmentary Italian trea-tise against the Cathars, here called Patarines. This brief text takes the form of adialogue on Eucharistic doctrine between a Catholic and a heretic whichresembles very much the texture of theDisputatio, a copy of which it in factprecedes. In such juxtaposition with texts framed as disputes, and a text of apolemical purpose, suggestions of debate in the brief lists of ourSummaeauctoritatumare reinforced.48In general, and especially in what we can perhaps regard as the expandedformat of the fuller texts, theSummae auctoritatumin fact have more incommon with polemic than with homily, and the construction of heresy itselfresembles that presented by the polemics very closely. Although the discus-sion of each article is less developed, the language not as rich, nonetheless thebasic principle remains very similar: heresy here is a doctrinal thing and,where it is more visible, it constitutes a developed theological system andindeed little else. In the case of the ItalianBrevis summulathat system includesa complex division of doctrine among different Cathar groups. Again, as in thepolemics, we can see the heresy of theSummae auctoritatumas learned, both interms of its expression through Scripturally based argument and in terms ofthe Catholic reaction to it, which sees it as something to be engaged withthrough exegesis and reinterpretation, addressing the error in an academicmode. Indeed, if we can read theSummae auctoritatumat least in part as toolsfor debate, then this engagement is a very direct one.The use of the term ‘heretic’ in theSummaeis also very similar to that foundin the polemics. While it is clear enough from the nature of errors refutedwithin them that all of these texts are for the most part directed against theCathar heresy (though much of the sacramental argument would serve equallyagainst Waldensian error),hereticiremains the most common term usedthroughout all of these texts. The first three of Douais’Summaename theirsubjects only in their incipits and explicits, and here they are called only ‘here-tics and Manichees’; the explicit of Douais III extends this to cover ‘Manichees,Patarines and heretics’ as well as ‘Passagians and Circumcisors, and againstmany other heretics’. Douais IV addresses itselfcontra hereticos, but throughoutthe text refers to them not only as heretics but also aspaterini. Though theBrevis summulaincludes detailed descriptions of the differences between theCathar groups in Italy which consistently use these specific group names torefer to their subject, and though we know that the author of the refutationknew the names of the different groups through his list of errors, whichdescribes and divides the heretics according to those names, within the refuta-52Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century48BnF MS Lat 14927, fols. 8vb–10ra.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:22:10 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"tion itself only once is anything more specific than ‘heretic’ used.49Hereticsremain, for the most part, rhetorical figures that provide a focus for the error, amouthpiece, who here also have a more practical purpose as providing aframework for active debate. As with the polemical texts, though, the hereticsare carriers of the errors that the texts address and not the subject underdiscussion.50ExemplacollectionsTheexemplumwas one of the building blocks of the new wave of preaching.An illustrative story that could be exploited and adapted to carry home thecentral message of a sermon or exposition, it was one of the several toolsdeveloped for preachers in the course of the systematization of preaching tech-niques and the development of newars praedicandi. Established as a separategenre between about 1170 and 1250,exempla, together with other tools such asflorilegiaanddistinctiones, provided the raw materials from which sermonscould be built. The Cistercian Caesarius of Heisterbach was one leading propo-nent of theexemplaform, and hisDialogus miraculorum, designed for use withinthe monastery (though containing and preserving the imprint of the outsideworld), used these stories to educate and inform. In the century after 1250dedicated collections ofexempla, most of them Dominican productions, beganto appear for the use of preachers in the field.51Stephen of Bourbon’sTractatusde diversis materiis predicabilibusis one of the earliest of these purpose-builtcollections, providing all the components that preachers might need not in theform of model sermons but as the individualrationes,auctoritatesandexempla53To Retreat from Sin: Texts for Edification49Douais,La Somme, p. 66 [I, II, III]; Douais,La Somme, pp. 73, 86, 96, 98, 100, 104, 106, 107, 108[IV];Brevis summula, pp. 115, 130, 121–33; Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus, pp. 286, 289, 299,300, 303.

Further, formost of theexemplaconcerning heresy or heretics that are listed in theIndexexemplorum, the collections of Stephen and Caesarius are the only sourcescited. They are the principal mid thirteenth century authors writing or usingexemplaon heretics and certainly the only two that treat heresy as a topic in itsown right.Dialogus miraculorum53Caesarius, the author of this text, was a monk in the Cistercian monastery atHeisterbach. It was out of his role there as master of novices that theDialogusmiraculorum,orDialogus magnus visionum atque miraculorum, was born,between 1219 and 1223. Essentially a collection of spiritual anecdotes arrangedas a dialogue between a monk and a novice over 746 chapters, and related inCaesarius’s engaging style, it was intended to be used for the edification andinstruction of novices in the order.54For Tubach, theDialogustherefore repre-sents the oldest surviving monasticexemplumtradition in Europe from thisperiod, providing a link between the older monastic tale-tradition and the latermendicant sermonexemplacollections, though in McGuire’s view it is moreproactive than this, combining the older story tradition with the contemporarydevelopments in Cistercian written and oral culture.55TheDialoguswascompiled slightly earlier than our period and it is difficult to know the preciserole played by Caesarius’s work in the development of theexemplatradition,but it was popular – it remains extant in over fifty manuscripts – and Caesariusremained interested in heretics and the question of heresy throughout hislife.5654Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century52Stephen of Bourbon, lib.1, p. xxxviii.53Caesarius,Dialogus; translated asThe Dialogue on Miracles, trans.

So, heretics are included in anaccount of an earthquake in Brescia, for example, but bear no relevance to themoral or the narrative of theexemplum; they are simply present.59McGuire describes theDialogusas a ‘finished work of monastic theology,spiritual experience, and moral instruction’ in which theexemplaare used toilluminate doctrine and ‘straight historical narrative’ is generally absent.60Nevertheless, Caesarius’s stories are embedded in his own milieu, from whichthey take on colour and texture. Describing an exchange between an abbot and‘a certain knight’ that he encounters, ‘sitting on a horse and talking to hisploughman’, Caesarius relates the knight’s statement of his (heretical) viewson the transmigration of souls:If [my soul] has led a good life, and won this reward from God, it will, when itleaves my body, enter into that of some future prince or king, or of some otherillustrious personage, in which it will find happiness; or if it has lived ill, it willenter the body of someone both poor and wretched, in which it will findsuffering.61The scene and the doctrine are both envisaged within a contemporary frame-work of rural life and social hierarchy which Caesarius reproduces with char-acteristic economy and style.

He tells a story of two hereticswho successfully convince the populace of their legitimacy through a series of‘miracles’:They bade [the people] sprinkle flour over the pavement, and walked over itwithout leaving any trace of a footstep; in like manner they walked on waterwithout sinking, and lastly, caused wooden huts to set on fire over their heads,and when these had been reduced to ashes, they came forth uninjured.62At a loss to know how to combat so convincing an enemy, the bishop resorts tonecromancy, ordering one of his clerks to summon the devil and ask him howthey have obtained these powers. The devil obligingly answers that ‘the inden-tures [cyrographa] under which they have become my vassals, are kept safe,sewn under their armpits, between the skin and the flesh, and it is by thischarm that they perform their miracles, and are immune from all bodily harm’.Armed with this knowledge, the bishop has the men searched and ‘thesoldiers, as they had been instructed beforehand by the bishop, lifted up themen’s arms, and discovering certain scars hidden beneath them, tore themopen with their knives, and drew from thence the indentures [chartulas] whichhad been sewn up in them’.63Thus they are undone. Even a standardanti-heretical story is given colour and personalized, not only through famil-iarity with the eyewitness but through an injection of humour that is unusualin this context. Everard, canon of St Géréon, is staying in Verona and, throughthe hospitality of his host, finds himself in a typical underground hereticalmeeting, which includes all the familiar ingredients: people of both sexeslistening to a heretical sermon, before the extinguishing of the lights signalsthe beginning of all manner of depravity. After six months Everard gets coldfeet and stops going, but confesses all to Caesarius’s source, Gotteschalk, reas-suring him that ‘you should know, brother, that I didn’t attend hereticalconventicles for the heresies, but for the girls’.64The inclusion of a joke here,56Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century62‘Farinam in pavimento cribari iusserunt, et sine vestigii impressione super illamambulaverunt.

LikeStephen, Caesarius includes a section in which heresy is not merely contextual,but is the focus both of theexemplaand of the moral that they convey. Thatdiscussion occurs within book five of Caesarius’s collectionDe daemonibus,inchapters eighteen to twenty-five. These chapters describe, in the followingorder: two stories dating from the 1160s about heretics burned at Besançonand at Cologne; a chapter on the Waldensians at Metz; another on theAlbigensians (a long chapter that includes the account of the siege of Béziers in1209 and the meeting of the monk and the heretical knight); a story ofacademic heretics burned at Paris (the Amalricians); a story of heretics burnedat Troyes; some more heretics at Verona (the obligatory chapter on sexualdepravity, quoted above); and finally a heretical teacher who said that thedevil was the ruler of this world.65There is little distinction made in terms of the organization of the chaptersalong the lines of different sects; rather, they are all mixed in together: theCathars, the Waldensians and the intellectual Amalrician heresy, with other,undifferentiated ‘heretics’. Caesarius is not much interested in providingworking descriptions of the heretics in question, but rather in seeking a moralmessage in their existence. The only occasions on which we are provided withmore detail are within the accounts of the Albigensians and the Amalricians.For the most part the heretics included by Caesarius have few distinguishingfeatures and tend to be described less in terms of belief than of actions andcharacteristics. Several common themes can be discerned in those characteriza-tions, which apply in most cases, regardless of the depth of detail given aboutthe heretics themselves.As in the case of the Amalricians, heretics can be educated in Caesarius’sworld, but the level of that education varies by sect and according to thedemands of theexemplum. Caesarius will sometimes emphasize the learning ofthe clergy in this context: the Bishop of Bescançon, for example, is learned,while the people are simple, and the heretics somehow neither, but are outsidethat construct, just as they are outsiders in the town, and their heresy is neithereducated nor rustic, but diabolical. The heretics at Cologne are examined bylearned men, but no mention is made of their errors, which in reality may have57To Retreat from Sin: Texts for Edificationand Swinton Bland rather neatly bowdlerize this as ‘such scenes as were slanderouslyalleged by the heathen against the Christians in the early days of the church’, I, 352.65Caesarius,Dialogus, I, 296–309. ‘Amalricians’ is not a name that Caesarius uses for thisgroup, but it is used here for the sake of convenience.

The novice, remarking that he has heardthat there are many heretics in Lombardy, receives the reply: ‘no wonder, sincethey have their own masters in various cities, publicly reading [= lecturingupon] the scriptures and expounding them perversely’.68Though hereticallearning is admitted by the latter example, at the same time it is made clearthat it is turned to a perverse end. After the monk’s description of theAlbigensians the novice remarks that if they only had ‘learned men’ amongthem none of this would have happened. Caesarius, or the ‘monk’, to intro-duce his next chapter on the sect of the Amalricians, made up almost entirelyof Paris theologians, replies that when learned men begin to fall into error thedevil pushes them further than the illiterate – learning can be a tool of the devilif not applied within Catholic limits.69Another noticeable feature of nearly all Caesarius’s depictions of heretics ishow frequently they are found in public, and how equally public and spokenis their mode of expression. One of the most common arenas in which we findheretics in this text is in the context of public debate or confrontation, usuallywith the local clergy or, in the case of anexemplumfrom Caesarius’s sermoncollections, with a papal legate.70Similarly, heretics are described in severalplaces in Caesarius’s stories as preaching, or impeding the preaching of theCatholics, and the Amalricians go on a three-month missionary journey fromParis to the dioceses of Paris, Lyons, Troyes and Sens.71Elsewhere, in anotherexemplumtaken from his homilies, Caesarius tells us of ‘the Albigensian here-tics openly fighting against the Catholic faith’.72This public arena for hereticsis something that is also common, in fact, to theexemplaof Stephen and Jacquesde Vitry.58Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century66As McGuire points out, that fact is known from theDialogusitself, book 6 chapter 4;McGuire, ‘Written Sources’, p. 275.67Caesarius,Dialogus, I, 299–300.68‘Non solum ex scripturis, sed etiam ex ratione’; ‘Hoc mirum non est, habent enim suosmagistros in diversis civitatibus, aperte legentes, et sacram paginam perverse exponentes’;Caesarius,DialogusI, 309, 308; trans.

Hiddenness can apply to behaviour,as can be seen in the sensationalist account of secret, morally depravedconventicles held by Lombard heretics, but for the most part their hiddennessoccurs rather in the context of their pretended appearance.73In his homiliesCaesarius labels heretics as false prophets: ‘in simple habits they approachsimple men, they profer words of simplicity, and with lupine malice theyfasten their teeth in them’.74In the same way, the two heretics that Caesariusdescribes at Besançon are marked, before anything else, by a false appearance,of piety and of nature: ‘two men, simple in dress, but not in heart, raveningwolves rather than sheep ... pretending the deepest piety’.75It is by this decep-tion and their false miracles, which are powered by the devil, that theypersuade people of their sincerity and of the truth of their teachings.The equation between heretics and the devil, or diabolical forces, is almostomnipresent in Caesarius’s description of heretics – they are the ‘limbs of thedevil’ – and in his explanation for the hidden part of their nature.76Indeed, forCaesarius the devil represents, as McGuire puts it, a manifestation of all theevils of man, and is in fact a central part of Caesarius’s whole text, but Berliozalso sees this diabolical connection as central specifically to Caesarius’sconception of heresy and the heretic, and it is not hard to see why.77In nearlyevery case the heretics are either the agents of the devil or moved by the devil,or their doctrine is derived from him; in one story the devil himself is called upto say that the teaching of the heretics belongs to him: ‘they preach what I haveput in their mouths’.78Within book five,De daemonibus, though some of thechapters that contain heresy are concerned directly to discuss heresy in its ownright, those discussions, like the otherexemplaincluded here, are all still subjectto the overall demonic theme of the book. However, even outside the group ofstories in that book, heretics are characterized above all by this connection.That diabolical involvement can in some ways be seen as a part of a widerconstruct that is visible also in the intervention of God in these stories; if theheretics are inspired or empowered by the devil then they are alwayspunished by God, not by men, unless those men are acting clearly as the59To Retreat from Sin: Texts for Edification73Public defence: Caesarius,Dialogus, I, 308. ‘Error non facit hereticum, sed defensio erroris’;in the letter to the prior of Marienstatt, Hilka,Die Wundergeschichte, I, 3.

A tendency to remove the actual punishment from the respon-sibility of men is something that can also be seen within the Dominican tradi-tion, but, given that theDialogusas a whole is concerned with miracles, thisdependence on supernatural forces is neither surprising nor exclusive to thesections involving heresy.Tractatus de diversis materiis predicabilibus79Stephen of Bourbon, a Dominican scholar and inquisitor, wrote hisTractatus dediversis materiis predicabilibussome time between 1250 and his death in 1261.What we know of Stephen himself can be gleaned mainly from this work andfrom a brief notice by the later Dominican, Bernard Gui, which describes thework and its author. The treatise is constructed around a scheme of the sevengifts of the Holy Spirit, though Stephen only reached the fifth gift, or book,before he died. This lengthy, though unfinished, work was intended as amanual for his brethren and aims to present authorities, arguments andexemplafrom which to construct sermons on any given subject.Examination of Stephen’s use and construction of heresy is at the momentmade more difficult by the lack of a complete edition; Lecoy de la Marcheextracted and edited manyexemplafrom the work, selecting those that seem toderive from Stephen’s more immediate experience. A new edition isunderway, but so far only books one and three have been published, and thecomparison between these and Lecoy’s volume (each of the new volumes isthe same size as Lecoy’s) provides an instant demonstration of how much ismissing from the latter. Nonetheless, Lecoy’s edition is sound, if highly selec-tive, and reading the two together can give a good impression of the overallnature of the text.The stated aim of theTractatusis to promote a Christian life among thesimple by means of arguments reinforced by authority and illuminated bystory, or, rather, to provide the means by which the ‘proximate’ Dominicanaudience of the text can construct sermons. Stephen’s ‘ultimate’ audience is thecongregation of the faithful and his concern is with their welfare and defence,not the attack of outsiders.80Exemplaare at the heart of that purpose; they aregiven prominence beside, and perhaps over, the other elements of the work.Stephen introduces the work as a collection of ‘authorities and reasons andvarious examples pertaining to the edification of souls’, and opens by listingthe good effects ofauctoritatesandrationes, which can prepare and teach men,instruct and stir them, cause them to move away from sin and towards good. Itis in order to make these benefits effective, though, to carry them home, thatStephen providesexempla, which, he says, are especially effective in making60Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century79Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus; Stephen of Bourbon, lib.1/lib.3.

He goes on to cite Gregory, who proved, in hisDialogues, thatdeeds speak louder than words andexemplalouder than preaching, and topoint out that Christ taught first by example.81It is for these reasons that hecollected variousexemplafrom many sources, which he lists in great detail.Stephen drew his material from a variety of sources. Apart from theScriptures and the works of the Fathers, some of his stories are from earlyChristian texts, some from contemporary chronicles, from Lives of saints andrulers, and some from his own experience and that of others with whom hehad spoken, reflecting a network of personal exchanges and interactionssimilar to that which McGuire outlines in Caesarius of Heisterbach’s collec-tion.82The material stemming from this latter source forms the basis of Lecoy’sedition, and in this context we might expect Stephen to know something ofheresy, given his background.We know that Stephen acted as a papal inquisitor in France because he tellsus so himself at various points throughout this text. Several times in theTractatushis anti-heretical work provides the backdrop to anexemplum,orauthenticity for its source – Stephen is always concerned to show from wherehe has acquired his material. He tells us that he has been present at andinvolved in the sentencing of a large group of heretics, and on two occasionshe frames his story as part of his experience as an inquisitor, once in Forez andonce when he was ‘in a certain city, by apostolic mandate working againstheretics and looking for [orquestioning] them’.83We also know that hepreached a crusade against the Albigensians at Vézelay, though the story hedraws from this episode has nothing to do with heresy except that it wasStephen’s reason for being in that place.84Heresy seems to be a sort of contextfor Stephen, at least at certain periods of his life, and it is perhaps surprising,therefore, that relatively few of hisexemplaare concerned with or mention con-temporary heresy.The number of occurrences of heresy in this text as a whole is, after all, rela-tively small. In thoseexemplathat are drawn from his own experience, heresyis well-represented: in Lecoy’s edition a relatively large proportion, 45 out of519, or about 9 per cent, have some firm connection with heresy. However,most of these are clustered together; only 17 are outside the section dedicated61To Retreat from Sin: Texts for Edification81‘Refertus auctoritatibus et rationibus et exemplis diversis ad edificationem pertinentibusanimarum’; ‘ad hec suggerenda et ingerenda et imprimenda in humanis cordibus, maximevalent exempla, que maxime erudiunt simplicium hominum ruditatem, et faciliorem etlongiorem ingerunt et imprimunt in memoria tenacitatem’; Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus,pp. 3–4; Stephen of Bourbon, lib.1, pp. 3–4.82Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus, pp. 5–8; Stephen of Bourbon, lib.1, pp. 5–6.

In both books the stories not included by Lecoy all derive from earlysources, but while this perhaps makes us feel more confident that in readingLecoy’s selection we have access to a fairly complete version of Stephen’sdepiction of the heretics of his own time and experience, it also underlinesthat, overall, Stephen draws as much on patristic sources as his own knowl-edge when a heretic is needed. The heretics of his own time he saves for hisdiscussion of heresy itself.Stephen dedicates a whole section of theTractatusto the treatment ofheresy. Each of theTractatus’ five books is divided systematically into titles,and then chapters, and each chapter has a theme, to the elucidation of whichthe arguments and their supporting authorities andexemplaare all directed.The chapterDe heresiappears in the seventh title, on Pride, of the fourth book,on the gift of Fortitude. Because heresy is here the subject, the organizing prin-ciple, rather than merely illustrative, the treatment that it receives here isdifferent. In light of that difference, and the density of material, it seemshelpful to treat theDe heresisection separately from the incidence of heresyelsewhere throughout the text, using the full edition of books one and three asa control where possible.Beyond the confines of the dedicated section of theTractatusencounterswith heresy are almost always in the form of the heretic: usually, though notalways, an abstracted nameless figure. In book one, of the sixexemplathatinclude heresy in some form, in only one of these is the heretic, Pope Leo,named.86Of the three occurrences that Lecoy reproduces from book two onlytwo actually feature heresy, again in the form of nameless heretics describedno further thanheretici. In the third book, heresy, or rather the preaching of theAlbigensian crusade, is merely the context in which Stephen says he heard the(admittedly very good) story about a man with a ‘great and horrible’ toadimmovably stuck to his face as a miraculous punishment.87Book threeprovides twice as many heresy stories as book one, including two versions ofSt Augustine’s conversion from Manicheism, three stories about Arians(including Arius’s unfortunate demise) and four about late antique saints62Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century85Stephen of Bourbon, lib.1,tabula concordantiae exemplorum, pp. 545–56; Welter gives the totalnumber ofexemplain theTractatusat around 2,900; Welter,L’exemplum, p. 215.86Three antique: Hilary, Stephen of Bourbon, lib.1, p. 24; Theodosius pp. 207–8; Constantinep. 238.

In one, an anonymous heretic isseen to be confused by the arguments of a jester; the other presents us with themore developed character, ‘a certain old woman’, a contemporary of Stephennamed Alberea, whom everyone thought a saint. Stephen tells us that, whileshe did indeed live an austere life, this was a result of her mistaken belief thateverything was made by the devil, and Stephen identifies her as a Manicheanheretic.89Even if we discount theDe heresisection of book four it still includes morecontemporary incidents of heresy than the other books. Here we meet adistraught lady who, wishing to be burned as a heretic, is dissuaded and reas-sured by Stephen. We are also presented with the following: some hereticswho attempt to argue with Catholic priests, but who must resort to attackingthe priests’ bad example when they are refuted via Scriptural argument andreason; a priest who becomes a heretic and leads others astray; a heretic whotries to confound St Francis and fails; and a notice of the burning of 180 Mani-chean heretics at Mont-Aimé, in whose trial and condemnation Stephen waspersonally involved.90Book five, by contrast, offers only oneexemplum,containing ‘a certain heretic’.91Of all the examples mentioned above, in only two are the heretics namedpersonally, though there is sometimes a designation by place of origin; this isthe case with a heretic from the Auvergne, described in book one, who gave offa terrible smell when he was burned, though he is nonetheless distinguishedno further than that he was ‘quidam hereticus’.92More common is an identifi-cation with a group such as the Manicheans, though, with the exception ofAlberea, this tends to be largely restricted to the heretics of antiquity; typically,the heretics in question are identified merely as such and distinguished onlyby opposition to the Catholic truth.63To Retreat from Sin: Texts for Edification88St Martin of Tours, St Germanus of Auxerre and St Pachomius, whose tranquility is inter-rupted by the ‘Origenist’ heretics, whose noxious dogma renders them also physicallyodorous.

Two ofthe heretics that appear in book three, namely the heretic who is confoundedby the arguments of a jester and Alberea, refuse meat on account of their belief.Indeed, within Stephen’s account is a brief report of Alberea’s exposition ofthis belief before the inquisition. The heretic who confronts St Francis appearsto hold a Donatist view of ministers, and the story of Theodosius in book onepresents heretics denying the resurrection of the body. In this last case theheretical belief is an integral part of the narrative, in which Theodosius hastombs opened to prove them wrong, thus also proving the moral of the story,which is to demonstrate future corporal resurrection. Similarly, the hereticwho attempts to denigrate St Francis claims that the priest from whom he isreceiving Mass has a concubine; the heretic’s failure exemplifies Stephen’sargument, which has to do with irreverence. Where heretical doctrine appearsit is as a necessary element in the progress of the narrative, and not the subjectof it. Indeed, heretics are made to speak only when attacking the church, andnever give voice to their own beliefs, which, if they appear at all, are describedby Stephen. Although he mentions that there is a lot of heretical doctrine to befound in Milan he gives no indication of its content.93Heresy, then, in the principal form in which it appears in this text outsidetheDe heresisection, is a concrete, figural thing consisting of the actions andoften even just the presence of an otherwise undifferentiated ‘heretic’, withlittle or nothing of heresy, or doctrinal error, presented. Error appears in thistype of abstracted construct only when it serves the purpose of the story. Inthis context, heresy is only one part of the illustrative mechanism of theexemplumand subordinate to the purpose of thatexemplum– that is, the illus-tration of some part of orthodox behaviour or belief – and also to the widerplan of the text. So, for example, the Auvergnat heretic must smell bad whenhe is burnt because Stephen wishes to show, by this example, in what condi-tion heretics and other evildoers will suffer in Hell. That story functions as anillustration ‘of their foulness and bad smell’, which is one of a series of chap-ters that describes the torments of the damned in this title, which is on hell,and which in turn is part of the book on the gift of Fear.94In the same way asthe appearance of heretical doctrine, mentioned above in the case of Alberea,heresy here is illustrative of something else. While here it is at least necessarythat the figure be a heretic, and in some of theexemplathese heretical figureshave a historical ring to them, especially in the stories concerning the Order’sfounders, Diego and Dominic, there are occasions when the heretic is reducedto a mere device. When Stephen tells us that a heretic cut out a priest’s tongue,here in order to give Mary, whose miracles are the subject of this chapter, thechance to restore it, he could have replaced ‘heretic’ with ‘evil person’, and theeffect would have been the same. The rhetorical nature of the exemplary64Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century93Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus, pp. 213–14, 215.94‘De feditate et fetore eorum’; Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus, p. 25; Stephen of Bourbon, lib.1,p. 114.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:22:10 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"heretic in these stories is perhaps best demonstrated by the fact that the storyof St Francis’ encounter with the Donatist heretic occurs twice in theTractatus,but each time to convey different messages.95Given that Lecoy’s edition concentrates almost exclusively on the exem-plary material from theTractatus, it is difficult to look at the appearance ofheresy in this text outside of itsexempla. We can, though, look at the full text ofbooks one and three for an idea of how heresy functions and is represented inthe other two elements around which Stephen built his work: that is, authorityand reason. In both books one and three, and it is only a very general control, itappears very rarely. There is very little discussion or mention of heresy inthese parts of the text, even in places where it might be expected, such as theexposition on bodily resurrection, something that the Cathars denied, to muchcondemnation. In fact, there appears to be only one mention of heresy in thediscursive parts of each book. Book three includes an almost throwaway refer-ence to heretics as part of a series of similes that includes a fox and Julian theApostate and that illustrates one of the qualities of confession – that it shouldbe ‘simplex’, not made for nefarious purposes.96Book one has something moresubstantial: during a discussion on the proofs for the existence of punishmentin Purgatory, in the course of the second chapter of the fifth title, there is arepudiation of heretics, especially Waldensians, who deny purgatory. Here weare given some detail of error – they say there is no place for souls exceptheaven and hell – which Stephen goes some way to refute, but it remains, aswith theexempla, a subordinate part of the wider discussion of orthodox faith.One of the main things to be noticed here about Stephen’s discussion is that hisfirst response is to attack not the error but the holders of it, by comparing themto Biblical models that held the same tenets; they are hyenas, and devils, andthe children of devils, and so ‘they betray their stupidity’.97While he doesrefute a later point with authorities, this seems to be in order to show that theyare sinners, and the attack, for it is quite polemical, remains focused aroundthe heretics themselves.A useful analogue to Stephen’s non-exemplatreatment here is to be found ina roughly contemporary and related work. Humbert of Romans’Tractatus dehabundantia exemplorumis very similar to theTractatus de diversiis materiisinboth structure and intention, and it draws heavily on Stephen’s work for itsexempla, though its date is hard to pin down with precision. Kaeppeli andPanella give 1240–77 as the widest range for its composition; Boyer narrows65To Retreat from Sin: Texts for Edification95Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus, p. 97; this story is also told by Caesarius,Dialogus, II, 31–3.Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus, pp. 265; 304–5. It is perhaps unusual that Stephen does notuse one of the many Dominican stories here, in which St Dominic argues with heretics andwins. Certainly he makes use of thevitaeof St Dominic elsewhere.96Stephen of Bourbon, lib.3, p. 133.97‘Manifestant eorum stultitiam’; ‘non esse loca animarum descendentium nisi infernum etparadisum’; Stephen of Bourbon, lib.1, pp. 144–5.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:22:10 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"the first date to 1263.98The surviving manuscripts of this work suggest that ithad a reasonably wide distribution.99A collection ofexemplathat are woven,like Stephen’s, into a didactic, moral narrative, and are subordinate to thisframework, the work was compiled by Humbert for the use of preachersworking ‘for the edification and salvation of all’. For, as he tells us in aprologue highly reminiscent of Stephen’s opening gambit, ‘exemplaare morestirring than words, according to Gregory, and are more easily grasped by theintellect’.100The organization of Humbert’s text is presented, like Stephen’s, asbeing structured around the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit, though apparentlyonly the first part of this was written, or survives. The book that we have, onthe gift of Fear, is rather smaller than the first part of Stephen’s text, but itsdivision and chapter titles are almost identical to Stephen’s.Humbert’s book seems to contain little material on heresy; though he liftsan enormous amount from Stephen, Humbert does not borrow any of hishereticalexempla. There is, however, at the very beginning of the sectiondealing with Purgatory, a discussion of the ‘heretics and particularly theWaldensians, who deny purgatory’. The discussion stands out as a contempor-ary element in a book otherwise dominated by material drawn from theFathers and the early church, but, while the position of Humbert’s treatment ofthe Waldensian error in the framework of the text resembles that of theTractatus, the nature of this treatment is quite different. Unlike Stephen’srather polemical line, Humbert approaches the problem as a theologicalquestion, presenting first the Waldensian position, which is based on thewords of Christ to the thief at the crucifixion, and then proceeding to a system-atic refutation, devoid of invective and focused entirely on the error: ‘next,against them is the Gospel, which they accept, where it is said ...’, and then alittle later, ‘not only authority but reason is against them’.101Humbert’sengagement with the subject on a purely doctrinal level throws into reliefStephen’s continued treatment, even in this situation, of heresy through thefigure of the heretic, not heresy as error.102Heresy, then, in the majority of Stephen’s text, appears always in the guiseof the more or less defined heretic, and always in the service of the grand plan,66Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century98Humbert of Romans,Humberti de Romanis De dono timoris, ed.

It is, however, a commonenough fact of life to be either really involved in different events, or to providea plausible character. Heresy, or the figure of the heretic, is an integral part ofthe contemporary fabric of Stephen’s experience.Stephen’s treatment of heresy as a subject in itself,De heresi, is containedwithin his discussion of Pride, the seventh of the titles within the fourth bookof theTractatus, on the gift of Fortitude. There is a further division within thissection which provides five different kinds of information. As he always does,Stephen explains in a brief prologue the plan of what he is about to do, whichit seems easiest to quote in full:1. By which arguments against heresy the Catholic faith is shown to betrue, and heresy confuted, and faith strengthened in believing hearts.2. In what manner error, in its evil effects, is opposed to the good effects offaith.3. In which evil conditions the heretic, deviating from faith, is entangled.4. By which errors the heretics of our times – that is to say, theWaldensians and the Albigenses, called Patarines or Bulgars – areinfected.5. With which sophistries they attempt to conceal themselves, and howthey may be detected.103The first three parts – that is, the lists of things by which the Catholic faith isshown to be the true one, of the good effects of the Catholic faith, and of theevil conditions and qualities of heretics – form the bulk of theDe heresisection,though Lecoy’s edition abridges these sections quite significantly. However,his numbers 342 to 352 inclusive represent the unbroken text of the fourth andfifth parts in the original.104In the fourth section Stephen discusses error, witha description and refutation of heretical doctrine. In the fifth, he gives us fourdifferent ways in which a heretic may be recognized. As in the rest of theTractatus, most of theexemplain these five parts that feature heresy, which isby no means all of them, treat it as a generic thing and are centred on theheretic. The difference in this section is that, though heresy appears in theexempla, it also determines or constitutes the subject of much of thesurrounding material – that is, the discussion made up byauctoritatesandrationes.67To Retreat from Sin: Texts for Edification103‘Prima, per quas persuasiones contra heresim fides catholica vera esse monstratur, etheresis confutatur, et fides in cordibus credencium roboratur; secundo, quomodo error insuis malis effectibus bonis fidei effectibus adversatur; tercio, quibus malis condicionibushereticus a fide devians circumvolvatur; quarto, quibus erroribus heretici nostri temporis,Valdenses scilicet et Albigenses, dicti Patareni vel Bulgari, inficiantur; quinto, quibussophismatibus operire se conantur, et quomodo detegantur’; Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus, p. 275.104Oxford, Oriel College, MS 68; Paris, BnF MS Lat. 14599.De heresioccurs at fols. 208rb–221vband fols. 212r–240rrespectively.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:22:10 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The first two sections concentrate on why the Catholic faith is superior toheresy. Stephen’s defence of Catholicism in these parts is clearly built around aresponse to error, which, in a way similar to the structure and substance of theSummae auctoritatum, produces a discussion of orthodoxy that nonethelessreflects heresy. Section one is essentially a statement of faith. It involves, in thefirst place, a comparison of Catholicism not only with heresy but also withpaganism and with Islam, an association that Stephen will make again in hislist of heretical attributes. Stephen then goes on to demonstrate that, whereheresy is divided, Catholicism is united under one God and one church,proven by the prophets. The second part sets out the good effects of the truefaith, as defined by their difference from the effects of heretical belief and as acomplement to the third section. In both discussions theexemplaemployed,whether they feature heresy or not, are, as with the otherexemplaconsidered sofar, concerned with the elucidation of those main points, the demonstration ofthe truth of Catholic faith.In the third section there is a shift, in as much as theexemplaare now aimedat illustrating a discussion of which heresy is now explicitly the subject,although there remains an emphasis on the abstract and the generic and,rather than echo the previous two sections on the Catholic faith and treatheresy as a matter of belief, Stephen gives us instead a description of the char-acteristics of the heretic. ‘Proud and conceited’, ‘poisonous’, ‘confused’, ‘avari-cious and greedy’: these characteristics revolve for the most part arounddefects in moral condition, and all our favourite anti-heretical staples are to befound here. Heretics are:Falsely adorned with pretended virtues, wolves dressed in the clothes ofsheep; inwardly they are ravening wolves, having an appearance of piety, butdenying the power thereof. The angel of Satan transformed himself into an an-gel of light, therefore it is no wonder if his ministers transform themselves intothe ministers of justice.105Next to the ravening wolves is invoked the image of Samson’s foxes: the here-tics are ‘tied together in their posterior parts by their tails, because they are allintent on one thing, fighting the church, like Samson’s foxes’. There is anemphasis on the harm that heretics do to others: ‘they are defiled and theydefile others’.106The fifth item on the list, that heretics are liars, includes anexemplumtaken from the preaching of a bishop in the ‘the land of the68Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century105‘Falsati ornati, fictis virtutibus, lupi vestiti vellibus ovium mt.vi.c.[7.15] intrinsecus suntlupi rapaces, tym.iii.b[5] habentes speciem pietatis virtutem negantes, cor.xi.d.[2 Corin-thians 11. 14–15] angelus sathane transfigurat se in angelum lucis non ergo mirum sitransfigurant se ministri sathane ut ministri iusticie’; Oriel MS 68, fol. 218va–vb, BnF MSLat. 14599 fol. 233va–34ra.106‘Elati et inflati’, ‘venenati’, ‘confusi’, ‘avari et cupidi’; ‘sunt coadunati sive colligati ex parteposteriori in caudis quia omnis tendunt ad unum quia intendunt impugnare ecclesiam utvulpes sampsonis qui habebant facies diversas colligatas caudas’; Oriel MS 68, fol.218va–vb, BnF MS Lat. 14599 fols. 233va–34ra.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:22:10 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Albigensians’ in which a simple man is persuaded by the words of some here-tics into believing his lamb to be a dog.107These are all personal attacks inwhich concern with error is peripheral.The shift in the emphasis of theexemplais continued into the fourth section,but there is also a change in the general presentation of heresy, because hereStephen gives a description of the ‘heretics of our times’.108What we find hereis very similar to the treatment of heresy that might be found in theanti-heretical treatises, or a handbook for inquisitors, with descriptions of thebackground to the heresies and a detailed list of errors. In fact, the whole atti-tude of this section is incongruous; it stands out in tone and substance from theother parts of the book and sounds as though it is talking to a different audi-ence. At the end of the Waldensian section Stephen justifies the inclusion ofthis information: ‘I have inserted these things here, thinking it good for thebrethren, defenders of the faith, not to be ignorant of them.’109He acknowl-edges the difference in register of a piece surely not designed for sermons tothe faithful, but in which instead we hear the voice of Stephen the inquisitor,and which was indeed used almost without alteration in Gui’s later inquisitionmanual, thePractica inquisitionis.110The more detached, informative tone of theinquisitor breeds a different kind of representation to that found elsewhere intheTractatus.Stephen’s main concern with regard to the ‘heretics of our times’ is todescribe, rather than attack. For both groups, and he deals only with‘Waldensians and Albigensians’, he describes their origin, their names andtheir errors. He includes details of their lands, their schools and their differentregional names, as well as a description of internal differentiations betweenlevels of initiation, but is mostly concerned with belief and their defence ofit.111They are reminiscent of the heretics that appear in the polemical treatisesand theSummae auctoritatum: learned and argumentative. They are shown,especially the Cathars, to argue from Scriptural authority and to includeseveralmagisterfigures among their ranks. There are even a few smallexchanges in the dialogue format, like that used in theDialogusand in some oftheSummae auctoritatum, between a ‘hereticus’ and a ‘Catholicus’.112The repre-sentation of heresy is not completely divorced from this figure at any point,which perhaps even becomes more tangible than elsewhere, as these are oftendrawn from people with whom Stephen has spoken personally, but the hereticdoes notact; rather, he believes, argues, misunderstands.

Notably, in this section alone theheretics are differentiated carefully and in detail on the grounds of belief.Stephen draws exclusively on his own experience for the illustration of thissection and for the heretical arguments, obtained through discussions with ‘acertain learned man who for a long time was of their sect’.113He also frameshis account of the Waldensians within his own experience: ‘as I myself came toknow and found out, in the course of many interrogations and confessions –both of theperfectiand their believers – done according to law and taken downin writing from what they themselves said; and also from many witnessesreceived against them’. This is reinforced throughout the description of theirerror by frequent statements from the author that he has gained this informa-tion directly through confession or in conversation with members of thisgroup: ‘one of their leading teachers and emissaries drew for me the followingdistinction’.114However, he defers immediately to the authority of Augustineand Isidore for the initial doctrinal framework of the Cathar error: ‘theManichees, whose pestilence still infects many places, according to whatblessed Augustine and Isidore say ...’115He continues to refer to the Catharsusing the patristic name of Manicheans, not just here but elsewhere in the text,though we know that he is aware of more contemporary names such asCathari,PatereniandBugari. Stephen perhaps sees, or wishes to present, acontinuous progression from Manichean history to his own time, ‘un aperçuschématique des croyances cathares, à travers le prisme augustinien’.116This isa progression that he attributes to the Cathars themselves: as they appear here,they regard Mani as their founder, owing to Stephen’s use of Augustine’sdescription of the fourth-century group.117It may be that, for Stephen, theCathars represent a more archetypal kind of heretic; he introduces this sectionwith the quotation from the first letter to Timothy concerning the errors of thelast days, verses often associated with heretics, and there may be a resonance70Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century113‘Quodam litterato qui et diu fuerat de secta eorum’; Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus, p. 303.114‘Sicut ego cognovi et inveni per multas inquisiciones et confessiones eorum in jure,perfectorum quam credencium, ab ore eorum conscriptas, et per multos testes contra eosreceptos’; ‘quidam magnus magister et legatus eorum hanc distinctionem mihi faciebat’;Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus, pp. 293–4, 296; trans.

Stephen lays down fourindications of a heretic: usurpation of office, diffusion of venom, hiding ofaffairs and sophistry. The term ‘heretic’ has moved back to a general usageafter being used by Stephen with little distinction to describe the ‘Manicheans’in the previous section. Some points here may be more applicable to one groupthan the other; the usurpation of the office of preaching and the owning ofvernacular gospels must apply more to the Waldensians than the Cathars, andit is indeed to ‘heretici Valdenses’ that Stephen refers here.119The section onsophistry again draws on Stephen’s inquisitorial experience of the difficultiesof interrogation and echoes the similar account given by the Pseudo-David.Stephen closes the section by saying that ‘those who propose the duality ofthings, as the Manichees do, can be refuted only with difficulty’, but thescheme of elusive answers is not presented as specific to one group.120What isclear is that, even though the fourth section demonstrates that Stephen is fullyaware of differences between contemporary heretics, this does not preventhim from creating, or perceiving, markers that can identify all heretics fromtheir behaviour, regardless of their differences. Their doctrinal errors do notrestrict a generic identity as ‘heretics’.TheTractatuspresents us with a figural and, to varying degrees, abstractheretic allied to edifying vignettes. That pattern seems to dominate most of theappearances that heresy makes in this text; certainly, most instances outsidethe dedicated section,De heresi, show this type of construction, and this is inturn largely because these instances are within the context ofexemplaand soneed to serve a higher moralizing purpose. Heresy does not feature much inthe framework of the text, those parts made up of theauctoritatesandrationesthat Stephen describes in his prologue, and this is because heresy has its owndedicated section, in its right place according to the careful structure of thebook, where it does form the framework. It remains contained within thefigure of the heretic, but it is only here, where it forms the basis of discussion,that it is ever really described in terms of doctrine. It is also because the book isaddressed to the edification of an orthodox audience, where tales of heretics’defeat, when safely cleansed of doctrinal content, provide plausible and usefulillustration of the correctness of orthodoxy and the perils of dissent.71To Retreat from Sin: Texts for Edification118I Timothy 4. 1–3; Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus, pp. 303, 304.119Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus, p. 308.120‘Illi autem qui ponunt rerum duplicitatem, ut Manichei, difficulter possunt convinci’;Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus, pp. 313–14.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:22:10 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"A landscape populated by heretics was clearly the source of much of Stephen’smaterial, but it was also, ultimately, the context in which these stories weredeployed. Anti-heretical preaching had gathered momentum in the firstdecades of the thirteenth century as the church began to respond moreproactively to the challenge that heretics posed to their authority. Of theseveral preachers who led this campaign, Jacques de Vitry in particular madenotably effective use ofexemplain his preaching career and brought all this tobear on the problem of heresy.121Jacques had a personal connection with the heresy of his time, having actedas a preacher for the Albigensian Crusade in the south of France in 1213 and1214, and in Belgium and Rheims in 1228, but he was also generally concernedwith the combating of heresy through preaching.122The preface to his life ofthe northern saint Marie d’Oignies directs the work to this end, as an answerto a request from the bishop of Toulouse for accounts of contemporary saintsthat could be used to preach against the heretics of his region. Though the lifeitself contains no heresy as such, Jessalyn Bird demonstrates clearly that theemphases that it places on the power of the Eucharist and sacraments werenonetheless shaped by an anti-heretical design.123Similarly, though relativelyfew of theexemplathat Jacques included in his sermons contain or concernheresy, those that do reveal this common, underlying concern.124Jacques tells of the daughter of the count of Toulouse, born into a hereticalfamily but remaining firm in her Catholic faith until her mother calls an evilspirit to torment her. The girl’s faith is reinforced by the Holy Spirit and thestory ends when the evil spirit ‘fell into the pit that he made’ (a quotation fromthe seventh Psalm that Jacques also uses to describe the defeat of the Patarinesat the hands of theHumiliati). Heresy is venomous and perfidious, and heretics‘wish to harm Catholics’, and Jacques uses his sermons to demonstrate this.125His approach is not generally to address heretical ideas directly, though he72Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century121J.

The story relates how a certain man, ‘from an excess of simplicity’,would not receive the sacraments from an unworthy priest. God, to recall himfrom error, sends him a dream in which he sees a well from which a leperdraws clear water in a beautiful vessel. When the man approaches to drinkwith the many others gathered there the leper refuses him, saying ‘in whatway will you accept water from the hand of a leper, you who scorn to acceptthe sacraments from an unworthy priest?’ ‘Most evil, therefore, is the doctrineof heretics’, Jacques glosses, ‘who say the virtue of the sacraments depends onthe [moral worthiness] of the minister’.126More broadly, anotherexemplum,about a sea-going monkey, is used by Jacques to demonstrate that heretics,though preaching against the church out of envy, in fact are inwardlytormented as they know that ‘their doctrine is perverse’.127On the whole, Jacques’s main tactic is to equate heretics with evil and tocast doubt on their intentions. So, some sheep, here representing those wholend their support to heretics, foolishly allow wolves to enter among thembecause they are protected by the dog; they are tricked by the wolves – that is,the heretics – into giving up their canine protector – that is, the prelates of thechurch; by these methods, Jacques tells us, heretics wish to make the clergyhateful to Christians, in order that they more freely invade the flock.128ThusJacques associates heretics and their preaching with evil, while simultaneouslybolstering the role of the church as protector. He also takes care to underlinethe necessity, and even inevitability, of their punishment by the Church. Twofurtherexemplaserve to illustrate heresy, or rather heretics, in this way: acertain rustic, remembering that his foot ailment was cured with hot onions,tries, unsuccessfully, to heal his neighbour’s eye condition with the sameremedy. So the same medicine does not cure all illnesses, and so the churchdoes not treat all heretics in the same way; those wishing to return are recon-ciled, others put in prison, others handed over to the secular arm, dependingon their obstinacy.129Similarly, two penitents receive unequal penance73To Retreat from Sin: Texts for Edification126‘Ex nimia simplicitate’; ‘quomodo de manu leprosa vis aquam recipere qui a malissacerdotibus dedignaris accipere sacramenta?’; ‘Pessima igitur hereticorum doctrina quiex una ministri dicunt pendere virtutem sacramentorum’; Vitry, Crane, clv, p. 68; ‘una’ isnot clear here – possibly a mistake for ‘manu’.127‘Perversa est eorum doctrina’. While travelling by sea to Santiago, a man, though alreadywealthy, has acquired even more wealth by selling the pilgrims badly measured andfrothy wine. Seeing the purse in which he keeps this money, a monkey steals away with itand climbs the mast of the ship, putting the coins to its nose, and casting some into the seaas though they were filthy. The monkey and the purse are eventually retrieved by a sailor,and the man finds all his ill-gotten gains cast into the deep by the monkey; only hislawfully inherited money remains; Vitry, Greven, 102, pp. 60–61.128He also takes the opportunity to condemn the rejection of sacraments based on the meritsof the minister; ibid., 96, p. 57.129Ibid., 100, p. 59.

Jacques uses this to exemplify the hardness of heart,the obstinacy, that distinguishes heretics according to the Biblical model givenby Titus, which he makes contemporary by the gloss ‘who are calledconsolatiorperfecti’.130Jacques’s stories are aimed not at coercion or debate, but at protection of theflock via preaching. His opposition to heresy is indirect; his message is aboutthe relative value of heretics and the church’s representatives and, whileheresy may be a problem of belief, heretics also present a problem of al-legiance. In a sermon on the theme ‘that we should refresh ourselves in thetreasury of the Scriptures before refreshing others’, oneexemplumshowsJacques in direct contact with heretics. It concerns an occasion on which he isinvolved in a debate in the Albi region with some heretics, here called ‘littlefoxes’ and unspecified by name, but identifiable as Cathars from the briefdescription of their error: ‘they assert that the devil created all things visibleand corporal’. The Catholic party are not succeeding, and the heretics areshouting that the Catholics are unable to convince them clearly by authorities.Jacques’s party challenges one of the heretics to make the sign of a cross, andhis inability to do so means that they are finally recognized as heretics.131Here, where heresy appears within the story its presence is simply illustra-tive; a convenient demonstration of the sermon’s theme, the uses of Scripturalknowledge. As with others of Jacques’s and in fact Stephen’sexempla, particu-larly those drawn from older sources, heresy is simply a part of the story’scontext – Jacques tells two stories about the Arians, who serve to illustrate thecharacter of St Athanasius, while giving very little attention to the heresy thatthey contain.132In those examples that are drawn from Jacques’s own time andexperience, though, their presence in the background takes on a more imme-diate character of competition. The type of conflict with heretics that Jacquesdescribes in southern France is also a part of his life. In hisHistoria occidentalis,first composed around 1221, Jacques gives a description of theHumiliatiofnorthern Italy, who, he tells us, were particularly effective in combating the‘heretics whom they call ‘Patarines’. As well as revealing their lies andconfounding them in public, they caused many to return to the faith and turnagainst their own kind; the heretics are described here again as ‘vulpeculae’.13374Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Centurygiven quicklime by her servant, instead of ointment.

After nearly losing all his belongings and his books, his ‘arma’, in aswollen river, he arrives at Milan, which he calls a pit of heretics, ‘foveahereticorum’. He tries to preach there, but finds ‘in the whole city hardlyanyone who resisted the heretics’, except for theHumiliati.134Anti-hereticalpreaching is not just about ensuring right belief, it is also about countering apowerful set of rivals.Dominican sourcesA significant tradition in mid-century writing about heresy is to be foundwithin texts written by Dominicans for use and circulation within the Order.The lives of their saints and brothers, written for the edification of the brethrenand the reinforcement of the Order, describe the early days of its development:a southern French landscape of trials, and miracles, and a reasonable numberof heretics. The principal sources are hagiographical: early lives of the Order’sfounder Saint, Dominic, and its first martyr, Peter of Verona. Next to thesethere is also a collection of stories about the lives of the earliest Dominicansknown as theVitae fratrum. These stories do more than preserve and record theOrder’s origins. Luigi Canetti’sL’invenzione della memorialooks specifically atthe development of an internal tradition of the Order in these early works andshows the way in which they build a Dominican idea of themselves.135ForCanetti, the development of Dominican identity is closely tied to, and indeedcan be traced through, the development of the image of their founder-Saint, StDominic, as he is redefined into a series of prototypes, or models, for theOrder’s contemporary needs.136And this is a specifically Dominican, ratherthan mendicant, tradition. A search for descriptions or discussions of heresy inthe equivalent, contemporary Franciscan tradition, the lives of St Francis andof St Anthony and the Order’s chronicles, yields a very scanty return incomparison to the Dominican texts. While the character of heresy is similar,there is no parallel with either the relative prominence that heretics have in theDominican texts or in the role that they play in the formation of a regularidentity.137Within Canetti’s framework of a consciously created Dominican75To Retreat from Sin: Texts for Edification134‘Vix autem invenitur in tota civitate qui resistat hereticis’; Jacques de Vitry,Lettres deJacques de Vitry (1160/70–1240), évêque de St.-Jean-d’Acre, ed.

During this time Dominic was preaching as part of theanti-heretical movement which swept the south in these early decades,initially as a companion to his bishop, Diego of Osma, and then at the head ofhis own small group, and several significant encounters between Dominic andheretics are recorded in the various Lives. All of these texts cover similarground with regard to Dominic’s early encounters with heresy, of which asketch follows, based on Jordan’s account.While on a mission to Toulouse Bishop Diego is moved to pity by the levelto which heresy is ingrained in the region; meanwhile, his sub-prior, Dominic,converts their host, who is a heretic, by arguing with him all night: ‘the hereticwas not able to resist’.142Diego and his party then join a Cistercian legationsent to combat heresy, which is meeting with little success. Diego advises themonks to dispense with their excessive clothing and provisions and lead byapostolic example, as he himself then does, sending most of his followershome and retaining only a few who will stay with him and spread the faith.Among this number is, of course, the future St Dominic. Dominic is soon ableto demonstrate his latent sanctity in a famous miracle, which Jordan places atFanjeaux: at a public debate between heretical and Catholic groups, the writtenarguments of both sides are subjected to trial by fire.143Dominic’s text, whichhas been chosen by the Catholic side to represent their views, leaps unharmedfrom the fire. The heretics understand this, according to Jordan, as a sign that77To Retreat from Sin: Texts for Edificationwith notes and intro. B.

Diegofounds the convent of Prouille to provide for the daughters of poor nobleswho, because of their poverty, must be educated by heretics. He remains inToulouse for two years, and dies on his return to Spain.Dominic is now left on his own in an unofficial capacity, with only a fewcompanions, and at this time the Albigensian crusade is launched in theregion. No explicit connection between Dominic and the crusade is made byJordan; he simply tells us that Dominic remains in the region until the death ofSimon de Montfort, ‘constantly preaching the word of God’. Though this is notspecified as anti-heretical preaching, Dominic endures threats and mockeryfrom the heretics with characteristic patience and an apparent desire formartyrdom. He tries to sell himself to save a man who follows the hereticsonly because they support him financially. Dominic apparently continues inthis vein until the time of the Fourth Lateran Council, but no further details ofthis time are provided and heresy does not make another appearance inJordan’s account of the ‘Origins of the Order of Preachers’.What is interesting with regard to the role of heresy is the way in which thesignificance of these same basic events develops in the course of the laterlegendaeand their representation of the Order’s foundation, something thatCanetti’s evaluation of these sources makes clear. Perhaps the most obviouschange is the gradual replacement over time of Diego with Dominic as theprincipal actor in this phase of the Saint’s life, something which the promotionof Dominic’s cult and the re-attribution to him of the role of founder madenecessary.144The next of the lives to appear, Ferrandi’slegenda, is certainlybased on Jordan’s original version, but adds a lot of its own material. Diego isstill present in the same capacity, but now it is Dominic who is presented asthe one who is initially moved by the heresy he sees in the Midi, and themiracle of the fire at Fanjeaux is accentuated when the text is made to leap afurther two times from the fire.145Ferrandi follows the same pattern as Jordanuntil Dominic’s attempt to sell himself, at which point he adds a story in whichDominic converts some Toulousain nobles from heresy by outdoing theheretics who are staying with them in his levels of abstinence and abnegationduring Lent. That new section is striking in the invective that it introduces intothe hitherto rather dry descriptions of the heretics inherited from Jordan,calling on many anti-heretical images, including ravening wolves and a falseappearance of piety, to illustrate its attack. From this point, this story forms anintegral part of the following lives. Ferrandi also adds that the heretics are78Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century144Reltgen-Tallon, ‘L’historiographie des Dominicains du Midi’, pp. 395–414, 398.145Peter Ferrandi, MOPH 16, pp. 216, 220. Ferrandi is perhaps influenced by Peter of lesVaux-de-Cernay’s version, in which the paper leaps unharmed from the fire three times.He also doubles the number of times Dominic tries to sell himself, adding a reflection of theoriginal (itself of rather dubious veracity) in which Dominic tries again to sell himself tohelp a woman whose brother is held by Saracens.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:22:10 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"twisted with envy at Dominic’s perfection.146With Constantine’s account, thesuggestion that the heretics wanted to recruit Diego is omitted from theFanjeaux miracle account, and there is no mention of Prouille or its founda-tion. By the time we reach Humbert’slegenda, again, it is Dominic who isinitially disturbed by the heresy, as Humbert lifts this almost entirely fromFerrandi, but now it is also Dominic who is the founder of Prouille.147The view of the Order’s origins and the centrality of heresy that these textspresent is refracted in a variety of ways through other Dominican texts.Stephen of Bourbon, for example, in an incidental remark, places the foundingof the Order at Diego’s abandonment of his retinue in order to preach in theMidi, but does not connect it with heresy.148At the same time, for Gerard ofFrachet, heresy is the sole reason for the foundation of the Order. The firstparagraph of his section on Brothers who have died for the faith, which beginswith an account of the Martyrs of Avignonet and Peter of Verona, opens: ‘theOrder of Preachers having been founded by St Dominic in Toulouse, speciallyto combat heresy and errors’ and goes on to make an explicit connectionbetween this and the assignment of the office of inquisition to the brothers.149The Dominican chronicler William Pelhisson is equally confident that therepression of heresy represents the vocation and principal reason for thefounding of his order: ‘the blessed Dominic instituted the said order againstheretics and their believers’.150Perhaps more significant for the place of heresy in the Dominican traditionis the reinterpretation of Dominic’s life and image in light of the Order’s subse-quent involvement in the office of inquisition. There has been some dispute,most notably between Thouzellier and Vicaire, over whether or not Dominichimself could ever be called an ‘inquisitor’. Thouzellier believed that he was, ifnot an inquisitor, a ‘precocious example of inquisitorial zeal’, to use the phrasethat so annoyed Vicaire, operating within a well-established papal tradition ofrepression. Vicaire thought the whole thing anachronistic, and that Dominic79To Retreat from Sin: Texts for Edification146Ibid., pp. 225–6, 228.147Humbert, MOPH 16, pp. 377, 382. Humbert leaves Ferrandi’s account to revert to Peter ofles Vaux-de-Cernay’s for the fire miracle, making it not only a private event, but alsoplacing it at Montréal, as Peter does.148Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus, p. 79; this version does not appear to correspond to thosefound in any of the Lives.149‘Cum ordo predicatorum a beato Dominico contra hereses et errores specialiter fueritinstitutus Tolose’;Vitae fratrum, p. 231;Lives of the Brethren, trans. Conway, p. 201, though,curiously, Gerard doesn’t mention any heretical involvement in his description of themurder of William Arnold and Stephen of St Thibéry and their party. The account ofDominic in theVitae fratrumincludes only one occurrence of heresy, and it is not onerecorded in thelegendae, perhaps because, being concurrent with Humbert’s officialaccount, this could not be a ‘life’ of Dominic; Canetti,L’invenzione, p. 479.150‘Beati Dominici ... dictum Ordinem instituit contra hereticos et eorum credentes’; WilliamPelhisson,Chronique (1229–1244) suivie du récit des troubles d’Albi (1229–1244), ed.

For Canetti, the ‘providentialanti-heretical significance’ of Dominic’s sanctity was tied to the Order’sinvolvement in inquisition.152He concurs with Merlo’s theory that the canon-ization of St Dominic to some degree sanctioned the office of inquisition, andextends this further by placing the canonization in the context of Innocent III’spolicy of ‘confusio heretice’, via persuasion and coercion. The canonizationitself then arose partly out of a need, both of the Order and the pope, to legiti-mize this unpopular office.153The change in the lives appears first in themid-centuryLegendaof Constantine. Up until this point in the hagiographicaltradition all contact between Dominic and heresy had taken place very firmlyin the years before Dominic founded his Order. Now Constantine adds twomore examples post-foundation in the process of accumulating miraclesaround the figure of St Dominic that marks this version of the Life.154The firstis a story in which a huge and unpleasant cat assails Dominic and nine ladies80Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century151This debate can be found inAnnales du Midi80 (1968), 121–38.152Canetti,L’invenzione, p. 103. Caldwell similarly makes a case for thevitaeof Peter Martyr aspart of a move to articulate Dominican identity through its saints, at a time when the orderwas undergoing some difficulties; (as Caldwell) ‘Peter Martyr: The Inquisitor as Saint’,Comitatus31 (2000), 137–74, and (as Caldwell Ames)Righteous Persecution: Inquisition,Dominicans, and Christianity in the Middle Ages(Philadelphia, PA, 2009).153Constantine, according to Tugwell, ‘had all the instincts of the worst kind of hagiogra-pher’; S. Tugwell, ‘Notes on the Life of St. Dominic’,AFP65 (1995), 5–169 (p. 31). Canetti,L’invenzione, pp. 244, 96. All of the Lives of St Dominic are post-canonization, so the changein his image must be part of an ongoing process. At the time Jordan was writing hisLibellusthe office of inquisition was still young and had perhaps not yet built up the level ofhostility that it later acquired. Papal policy certainly seems to have been to regard theOrder as closely connected to anti-heretical activity, though Cistercians and Franciscanscontinued to make up an equally important part of the Papal inquisition. Gregory’s orig-inal mandate for the commission for Dominic’s canonization does indeed mention heresy.A letter sent by the Cardinals to the Order after the killing of Peter of Verona, which Gerardof Frachet reproduces, seems to regard the Order as being instituted to deal with heresy, atleast in some capacity. A letter of Innocent IV to Raymond of Peñafort entitledDe haeresiextirpandasimilarly regards the Order in this light: ‘in his autem, nobis fratres vestri ordinisDominus specialiter voluit esse adjutores’; Mansi, XXIII, 568. However, not many of thewitnesses of Dominic’s canonization process seem to have felt heresy to be a significantpart of Dominic’s life; only two of the nine in the Bologna process and five of thetwenty-three in the Toulousain process mention it. These are previous to the rewriting andreinterpretation of St Dominic’s life, but even despite the developments in the tradition ofDominic the majority of his contact with heresy in these sources is presented as occurringin the period of his life before he founded the Order. There was surely more anti-hereticalmaterial to be found in Dominic’s later involvement in preaching missions in Lombardy,which were directed, not entirely, but primarily, against heresy, for those looking toenhance his image as a specifically anti-heretical saint.154Reltgen-Tallon, ‘L’historiographie des Dominicains du Midi’, p. 399.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:22:10 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"who are wavering between heresy and Catholicism, and who have come toDominic for advice; this story is repeated almost verbatim by Stephen ofBourbon.155The second sees Dominic saving one of a group of heretics fromthe pyre after having a premonition that he will convert. What is significantabout this account is that Constantine tells us that it was Dominic himself whoconvicted the heretics.156Both these additions are included by Humbert in hislegenda. Stephen of Salanhac, writing slightly later, makes this connectionexplicit in his gloss interpreting the signs around Dominic’s birth. By the timeof Bernard Gui’s continuation of Stephen’sDe quatuor in quibusin the earlypart of the fourteenth century this image of Dominic as the first inquisitor wasfirmly established in the hagiographical tradition.157The exact nature of Dominic’s inquisitorial role is not always so clear orconsistent in other Dominican texts of this period. No mention is made at allof the papal commission to the Order of the office of inquisition in theChronica ordinis, for example, despite the fact that it demonstrates a generalconcern to record official progression and appointments of the order and toalign itself with papal policy.158There appears to be some ambiguity, too,about the office of inquisition in Humbert of Romans’ views on preaching.Humbert’sLiber de eruditione praedicatorumaims very determinedly to confirmand defend preaching as the vocation of the Order.159Heresy may perhapsform part of the stimulus to this vocation, if the ‘demons’ that ‘have appliedthemselves with great diligence and for a very long time to subjugating thewhole world’ can be understood in this way, but it remains only one reason inthis chapter on the necessity of preaching and does not represent a vocation initself.160Brett shows Humbert to be accepting of inquisition, but not uncrit-ical.161He also points to Humbert’s view that ‘odious occupations’ that causehostility, such as ‘the receiving of delegates, inquisitions, visitations, and othersuch matters of judgement’, should be avoided by the preacher so as not toprevent his preaching having good effects.162Though Tugwell’s observationthat this does not necessarily refer exclusively to inquisitions of heretical81To Retreat from Sin: Texts for Edification155Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus/ Stephen of Bourbon, lib.1, pp. 34–5/165–6.156Constantine, MOPH 16, pp. 320–22.157Canetti,L’invenzione, pp. 253–5, 102–3.158TheChronica ordinisis appended to Reichert’s edition of theVitae fratrumin MOPH 1(1896), 321–38.159S.

The Louvain Dominican Thomas of Cantimpré describes a hereticcalled Gilles Boogris driven into hiding by his fear that he will be discoveredand burned by the Dominicans. Thomas casually remarks, almost as an aside,that this was at the time when ‘they had made many climb upon the fire’.164Aswe saw above, several times in hisTractatusStephen of Bourbon describeshimself as an inquisitor and twice mentions his involvement in the trial andcondemnation of a large group of ‘Manicheen heretics’. William Pelhisson iseven more forward, partly because inquisition is a much more central part ofhis narrative than it is for Stephen. William gives us the details of his involve-ment with no qualms whatsoever: ‘Friar Arnold Catalan with Friar WilliamPelhisson ... making inquisition against heretics in Albi ... condemned Peter ofPodiumperditum and Peter Bomacip, who were burnt alive’.165William canperhaps be placed within the southern tradition of Dominican writers thatReltgen-Tallon describes who were more able than were the northern, univer-sity-based Dominicans to reconcile their involvement in inquisition with thewider Dominican vocation, and indeed saw their work as forming acontinuum with the original purpose of Dominic’s early years.166The fact thatboth William and Stephen were themselves active inquisitors for many yearsmay also have made it easier to reconcile inquisition with their vocation.In general, though, there does seem to be a certain level of ambivalence inthe Dominican representation of their actions in connection with heresy.Action against heretics is rarely emphasized and it is equally rare to find anyspecifically judicial element. What is emphasized instead is the ‘zeal for souls’with which St Dominic is so frequently characterized, conversion and the good82Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century163Tugwell,Early Dominicans, p. 324, n. 76.164This story is from a moralizing treatise on bees composed between 1256 and 1263 byThomas of Cantimpré, an itinerant Dominican from Louvain.

Even in the story of Peter Martyr, which is full to thebrim with heresy, there is no story concerning his action as an inquisitor – hedebates with heretics, he is chosen by the pope to be an inquisitor, we are toldthat he pursues heretics, but see none of this described, and then he ismartyred. Gerard of Frachet, though he describes Peter as an inquisitor, doesnot frame any of his encounters with heretics in the context of an inquisition;similarly his account of the Martyrs of Avignonet. On the whole, in theedifying literature, where there is any action against heretics, inquisitorial orotherwise, there are no consequences for the heretics involved unless it isconversion or confutation. None of the heretical opponents in the variouspublic debates that appear in these accounts are handed over to the seculararm; indeed, often any retribution or defeats that they may suffer are notthrough the agency of the Friars Preacher, but by divine intervention. Theymay leave defeated, or converted, but they are rarely seen to be punished bythe Dominicans.167Instead, the main arena for contact between the Dominicans and the here-tics is nearly always that of debate or verbal confrontation. The variousaccounts of Diego of Osma’s mission all recount the stories of St Dominic inprivate discussion with his heretical host and in public debate with the localheretics. Indeed, Dominic and his opponents, in the debate at Montréal, are soevenly matched that the judges are unable to decide between them; noticeablealso is that both parties’ arguments are in a written, text-based form.168PeterMartyr, too, is involved in debates, both in private with his heretical family,and in public with the heretical élite. We see him confront in debate a ‘hereticof great ability and eloquence’, as well as a Catholic bishop turned bad. Heargues with his own family members, in a dispute based on written authori-ties: ‘his uncle then tried to prove to him by authorities ... that the devilcreated these things, but, what was wonderful, [the child] turned all theseauthorities against him in such a fashion that he could find no way to resisthim’.169Heretics therefore serve as foils to the brethren to emphasize the impor-tance of example, as well as preaching and debate, in the Dominican ethos.Outside the section that covers Peter of Verona, and one incident involving StDominic, heresy appears in theVitae fratrumin the context of stories whichdemonstrate, through visions and divine signs, the merit of individualbrothers or the Order in general.170In separate stories two heretical Lombard83To Retreat from Sin: Texts for Edification167On this, see Caldwell Ames,Righteous Persecution, pp. 182–227.168Jordan, MOPH 16, pp. 33–4, 37–8; Tugwell,Early Dominicans, p. 54; Testimony of John ofSpain, for canonization of St Dominic, in Tugwell,Early Dominicans, p. 75; Jordan, MOPH16, p. 37; Tugwell,Early Dominicans, p. 54.169‘Tunc patruus nisus est ei probare per auctoritates ... quod dyabolus ista creaverit ... sedmirum valde, quod ita omnes illas auctoritates contra eum convertit, quod in nullo potuitei resistere’;Vitae fratrum, pp. 236–9.170TheVitae fratrumaccount of St Dominic is limited by the fact that it does not cover the sameThis content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:22:10 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"women are converted after receiving visions of the Order as divinelyappointed. A Provençal medic, led astray by the apparently greater piety ofthe Waldensians, returns to the faith again by virtue of a vision that shows thispiety to be only superficial. Gerard’s chapter on miracles wrought by thebrethren contains several stories in which heretics are converted by the mira-cles’ power.171Heresy, or rather the activity of the heretics, is presented as astimulus to Dominican activity and for many of the Order’s early recruits, suchas Peter Martyr and a young Tuscan man, Florimund. The most obviousexample of this function is the occasion on which Diego, in Jordan’s account,draws a parallel between the heretics and the pseudo-apostles and persuadesthe Cistercian legates that the false sanctity of the heretics can be defeated onlyby a display of genuine holiness: ‘chase off their feigned holiness with truereligious life’, exhorts Diego. ‘The imposing appearance of the false apostlescan only be shown up for what it is by manifest humility’. So they must losetheir luxuries, and in this Diego leads the way himself.172The one storyinvolving heretics that Gerard includes in his account of St Dominic revolvesaround the quiet and steadfast patience shown by the saint towards a hereticwho has deliberately led him astray, through thorns and brambles, while he ison his way to the famous debate at Montréal. By his shining example, which isof course the point of the story, he is able to win the man over and converthim.173There is further mockery of St Dominic himself, in theLibellusand Johnof Mailly’s account, all of which allows an opportunity for Dominic to demon-strate his forbearance, as well as his divine sanction, when such mockery ispunished by miracles.174Likewise, in a story of a heretic who feigns possessionto escape the attention of the inquisitors in Thomas of Cantimpré’sexemplacollection, the ‘possessed’ heretic pays no respect to St Acharius, and is dulypunished.175The representation of heretics, then, also plays a wider role in the construc-tion of the Dominicans as legitimate successors to the apostolic life, and, intheir turn, heretics are characterized predominantly by the insincerity of theirappearance. The theme of false appearance is of course not peculiar to thismaterial, but within the Dominican tradition, at least as it is presented in thesetexts, false appearance, and indeed the heretics more generally, serves tounderline the Dominican claim to true piety; false appearance is thereforeprominent in the representation and function of heresy in these texts.In theLibellusaccount of Diego of Osma’s journey to France a church84Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Centuryground as thelegendae, and so there is little material on the founder in general, and onlyone occasion in which heresy is involved.171Vitae fratrum, pp. 22, 183–4, 225–8, 193–5.172‘Fictam sanctitatem vera religione fugate, quia fastus pseudoapostolorum evidento vulthumilitate convinci’; Jordan, MOPH 16, p. 36; trans.

A chance remark– as they are talking in the sun, one of his companions exclaims: ‘see howLucifer bestows his warmth upon us’ – startles Florimund to such an extentthat his companion asks: ‘do you still not know that the devil created thesevisible things?’ Florimund rounds up as many of his heretical companions ashe can and asks why no one has told him of this belief, even though he hasbeen with them for twelve years – an omission reminiscent of the differinglevels of initiation that Raniero Sacconi describes. Florimund demands thatthey provide support for their doctrine and, when their arguments prove inad-equate, he decides he cannot accept this belief and looks for another;unsurprisingly he chooses Catholicism and becomes a Dominican, hence thestory’s inclusion here.178The theme finds a characteristically arresting expression in the work of anow familiar Dominican, Stephen of Bourbon, who also employs this motif.He adapts a quotation from Matthew – ‘they tear at their faces, that they mayappear to others to be fasting’ – to reinforce his point that heretics misleadpeople with the sophistry and duplicity of their words. Stephen’s descriptionof the Waldensians, ‘displaying the appearance of holiness and faith’, alsoincludes the equally evocative though more literally intended description of aheretic who, ‘like a Proteus, transformed himself’. The latter description refersrather to physical appearance, but also recalls the language of the Corinthiansverse on the pseudo-apostles, often attached to heretics’ false appearance.179In these accounts the heretics function in much the same way as they do in85To Retreat from Sin: Texts for Edification176‘Simulate sanctitatis exemplis’; Jordan, MOPH 16, p. 36.177Tugwell,Early Dominicans, p. 54.178‘Ecce quomodo nos lucifer calefacit!’; ‘nescis tu adhuc, quod dyabolus hec visibilia fecit?’;Vitae fratrum, pp. 184–6; trans.

Their presence is dependent on their dissent in as much as it istheir conversion that drives the force of the story: it is important that they areheretics, but the error that makes them heretics is not. With a few exceptions,heretics are generic in this hagiographical and biographical body of work, andit is their status as heretics that is significant. Belief makes only rare appear-ances and generally is simply one of the things that mark individuals out as‘heretics’, the non-specific label used almost universally in these texts todescribe those individuals.180In the widely focusedVitae fratrum, at least, here-tics seem often to be present almost incidentally. Those heretics that feature asproof of the miracles of the brethren feature among other very similar storieswhich do not depend on the presence of heretics at all, and their inclusionseems to rely as much on their general presence in the world of the stories’authors as on the purpose of the stories themselves. That Gerard is not writingthese accounts for himself, but editing contributions from brothers living allover Europe, suggests that to some extent heretics are included as a common-place of contemporary life. But they more often tend to fulfil a similarexemplum-style purpose of illustrating the sanctity of Dominican notables.Heretics are, among other things, the competition, and it is a contest beingfought by both sides on the same criteria of piety and apostolic lifestyle. Thefineness of the line between them is brought home by the fate of Franciscanmissions from Italy in the early decades of the Order. One group of mission-aries, who travel to the south of France, are asked by the locals if they are here-tics. The Italian missionaries reply, in all innocence and a failure to understandthe question, that yes, they are. The confusion is resolved in this case, butanother group who travel to Germany and encounter the same situation areless fortunate.181For a Dominican identity that has competition and conflictwith heretics so close to its core, the insistence on the falseness of the piety that86Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Centuryhis death that he had believed that poverty destroyed all sin, as rust is destroyed by fire;Thomas of Cantimpré,Bonum universale, ed. and trans. Platelle, pp. 198–9.180The occasional differentiation of Waldensian heretics might suggest in these instances acorresponding use of ‘heretic’ to mean Cathar, in the southern French mode. Gerard ofFrachet’s text is less uniform in its presentation than the others by virtue of its nature as acollection, but most of the entries nonetheless use the term ‘heretic’ with little distinction.181Jordan of Giano,Chronica fratris Jordani, ed.

Thebrothers spoke little German, and simply replied ‘ja’ to all questions asked of them, thatmethod having initially proved effective. The luckier ones seem only to have lost theirhabits, but Jordan says that, from this point on, ‘Germany was considered ... to be such aferocious country that only those inspired by a longing for martyrdom would dare toreturn thither’. The unfortunate fate of the Franciscan brothers suggests that heretics weresufficiently common in both regions for all indeterminate wandering religious to beassumed to be heretics.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:22:10 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"would otherwise give the heretics a claim on apostolic legitimacy is necessaryto construct the Dominican version as different.Across the whole range of these texts there is a strong impression of heresy asa contemporary phenomenon, which stems not only from the use of materialthat seems to address and describe events from memory or experience, butalso from the fact that heresy often appears in the background as a common-place and sometimes un-remarked feature of contemporary life. Though thepicture of heresy throughout these sources is varied, several constants seem tofunction in its representation, not least the theme of false appearance. Often,also, a connection to supernatural powers is made, either in terms of the poweror origin of the heretics or in terms of their punishment.In the context of edification and improvement more generally, stories ofheresy and the lives of heretics, to a greater or lesser degree, seem to servemost often as plausible and effective cautionary elements, usually in theservice of some wider point. The individual heretic, and not the heretical erroror belief itself, forms the basis for, and usually the focus of, these discussions.Any edifying purpose is not aimed at the heretics themselves; rather, hereticsare used as a tool for the improvement of others, something that rests in largepart on their plausibility and familiarity as a feature of the contemporary land-scape. It is most obvious in the case of theexemplacollections, but heresy alsoserves a similar function in the ‘internal’ Dominican texts, where the Order’shistorical involvement with heresy is not only reported but also used selec-tively in the creation of a Dominican identity.TheSummae auctoritatum, on the other hand, seem to be, and indeed areframed as, expositions of Catholic doctrine to be used for preaching to thefaithful and for teaching basic elements of doctrine to the general populace, apolicy that was certainly beginning to emerge in contemporary canon-legalprovisions against heresy.182But they differ from our other edifying texts in anumber of ways, most immediately in their lack of representation, due ratherto their abbreviated nature, but more fundamentally in their concentration noton the figure and characteristics of the heretic but instead on points of hereticaldoctrine. TheSummae auctoritatumappear to straddle the gap between defen-sive preaching and more proactive attack by being flexible enough to formsermons as easily as they supply material to the polemical tradition. Like thepolemics, they tend to proceed against heresy first by refutation and then bydefence and reinforcement of the Catholic faith, a pattern that theSummaeresemble closely, their design allowing them to function both in an edifyingrole and as a more active form of the polemic approach for use in the debatearena that the Dominican andexemplatraditions describe so often.87To Retreat from Sin: Texts for Edification182See below, p. 97.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:22:10 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"3Who Walks in Shadow:The Canon-legal PerspectiveQuis in tenebris ambulet, quis in luce1The representations of heresy that have been considered so far have all beenlocated in what could loosely be termed a literary context; next to thatmaterial, a substantial corpus of legislation against heresy, which formed adistinctive anti-heretical tradition all of its own, was developing. Ultimately, inthe mid thirteenth century, that tradition increasingly meant the documentaryoutput of inquisition, but the texts produced by that process will be consideredin their own right in the following chapter. This chapter will consider therepresentation of heresy within the wider tradition of canon law, throughconciliar material and through the textbooks of canon law. The former groupincludes both the canons of the ecumenical councils and especially the canonsof the various regional councils, in which many of the more specificallyanti-heretical provisions were put in place. Next to the direct legislation mustbe placed the textbook material that provided the basis for the teaching ofcanon law, those collections of authorities that informed the wider under-standing of the law – namely Gratian’sDecretumand theLiber Extraof GregoryIX.

Rather, the aim is to delineate the main features of thecanon-legal treatment of heresy through an examination of those texts thateitherarethe principal example of their genre or which can be taken as repre-sentative. To that end, we will begin with a brief panoramic view of heresy asit appears in the ecumenical decrees.The ecumenical councils of the twelfth century show heresy and the control ofheresy gradually gaining in prominence in the internal discussions of thechurch. Heresy had been a central concern of ecumenical councils since theearly days of the Catholic Church, when Catholicism was itself crystallizingout of a variety of opinions and entering a phase of self-definition in which the881Narbonne 43, canon 5, Mansi, XXIII, 357.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:25:42 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"demarcation and ownership of true doctrine became the principal criteria forChristian identity.2For that reason, most of the early councils are directedspecifically against one or more heretical groups: the first council of Nicaeaaddresses the Arian heresy, Ephesus deals with Nestorianism. The condemna-tion of heresy was usually accompanied by a statement of orthodox doctrine,the most notable example being the Nicene Creed.3By the twelfth century the general councils were again beginning to devoteincreasing amounts of space to the re-emergent problem of heresy, theirmeasures reflected in regional meetings and in those councils dedicated tospecific individuals – the suppression of Abelard’s writings at Sens in 1140, forexample.4Like the early councils, anti-heretical canons are directed againstnamed individuals, but, over the course of the century, condemnation of lessspecific groups, ‘other schismatics and heretics’, gradually becomes common-place.5The 1139 Lateran council, repeating the sentence of Toulouse twentyyears earlier, not only condemns ‘those who, simulating a kind of religiosity,condemn the sacrament of the Lord’s body and blood, the baptism of children’but also ‘bind[s] up their defenders with the fetter of the same condemnation’.6The generalizing tone continues to grow in the lesser councils, such as Tours in1163, and is developed more fully by the third Lateran council of 1179.7In itsfinal, twenty-seventh canon, alongside a condemnation of mercenary groups,89Who Walks in Shadow: The Canon-legal Perspective2R.

Thoughstill named, this is now an enemy of much greater numbers, spread throughGascony, the regions of Albi and Toulouse ‘and in other places’.8It is also inthe third Lateran council that refinements to the degrees of heretical involve-ment are first made, as it is here that the categories ofdefensoresandreceptatores, already present in a limited form in the second Lateran council,and in some of the regional meetings, begin to appear in earnest in thelanguage of the councils.9Over the course of the twelfth century church coun-cils are increasingly instituting measures against a heresy that is located in awider, less defined group than the named sects of earlier canons. Withoutdoubt, though, the most significant shift in the ecumenical treatment of heresycomes with the fourth Lateran council and the advent of the pontificate ofInnocent III.From the beginning of his reign in 1198 Innocent placed the fight againstheresy at the forefront of his policy. In 1199 he issued the famous decretalVergentis in senium, and the Albigensian crusade was launched under hisauspices in 1209; Innocent was ‘a pope known to be anxious about the growthof heresy’.10His determination to purge Christian society of heresy reached itslegislative apex in the great council of 1215.11According to García, the markedjuridical tone of this council was due in large part to Innocent the canonist, andthough the precise authorship of the canons themselves is uncertain, theimportance of Innocent’s personal influence in their composition is indisput-able.12No longer tucked away in the recesses, heresy and its repression aregranted pride of place at the very beginning of the fourth Lateran canons, andit is these canons that continue to represent the main ecumenical treatment ofheresy throughout the thirteenth century.13The next serious attention paid to90Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century8‘Alii Catharos, alii Patrinos, alii Publicanos, alii aliis nominibus vocant’; ‘et aliis locis’;DEC,I, 224.9Foreville,Latran I, II, III et Latran IV, pp. 146–7.10Nelson, ‘Religion in “Histoire totale”: Some Recent Work in Medieval Heresy and PopularReligion’,Religion10 (1980), pp. 60–85 (p. 73).11C.

The second canon of the council condemns Joachim of Fiore’streatise against Peter Lombard point by point and defends the Lombard’sTrinitarian doctrine in the same fashion. In its aim, this canon resembles thoseheresiarch-specific condemnations of early councils, and the brief denuncia-tion of the ‘most perverse doctrine of the impious Amalric’ is certainly in thismould, but the canon as a whole differs in its content in giving a rich descrip-tion and exposition of the errors and doctrine involved, so much so that it canperhaps also be seen as an extension of the creed that constitutes the firstcanon.16It also stands in contrast to the general and all-encompassing condem-nation of heretics in the third. This canon, which constitutes the council’s mainprovision against heresy, gives its subject no name, and no body of errors isdescribed or addressed. Heresy is defined here not by what it is, but by what itis not: namely, the creed that forms the opening constitution of the council.For the first time since late antiquity the 1215 council sets forth a full andclearly defined statement of faith and, like previous creeds, its formulation canbe seen to be in part motivated and determined by heresy and the need todraw lines of distinction.17The underlying presence of heresy in the fourthLateran statement of faith, ‘regarded as fully authoritative by subsequent91Who Walks in Shadow: The Canon-legal Perspectivecondemnation to the council proper is not entirely secure, and its promulgation seems tohave been limited.

The statement that ‘the devil andother demons were created by God naturally good’ is similarly suggestive, andthere are other parts of the statement of faith which, again, seem to answerheretical tenets directly: ‘all of them will rise with their own bodies’, forexample, or ‘not only virgins and the continent but also married people findfavour with God’.19Other intellectual disputes and errors have also left their mark on theformulation of this constitution. The legacy of the various Eucharistic debatesof the previous two centuries means that Aristotelian language is used in thecreed of the Eucharist, which is ‘changed in substance’, ‘under the forms of thebread and wine’, the first time non-Biblical language had been included in thedecrees of the universal church.20The concerns over Trinitarian doctrine raisedby the teaching of Joachim of Fiore, though treated in the second canon, alsospill over into the creed. In fact, the first canon of the fourth Lateran councilprovides a neat answer for most of the doctrinal errors of its time.21And this is,of course, the point. Heresy is defined specifically by the creed, as the openingline of canon three explicitly states: ‘we excommunicate and anathematizeevery heresy raising itself up against this holy, orthodox and catholic faithwhich we have expounded above’.22In moving away from outlawing specificerrors, and presenting a series of points which define error by exclusion,Lateran four makes heresy generic, doctrinally specific only in the negative,defined by its external status and undifferentiated within itself. The same shift92Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century18Ibid., p. 512.19‘Unum universorum principium, creator omnium invisibilium et visibilium, spiritualiumet corporalium ... de nichilo condidit creaturam spiritualem et corporalem, angelicam vide-licet et mundanam’; ‘Diabolus enim et demones alii a Deo quidam natura creati sunt boni’;‘omnes cum suis propriis resurgent corporibus’; ‘non solum autem virgines et continentes,verum etiam coniugati ... placentes Deo’; García,Lateran 4, pp. 41–3; trans.DEC, I, 230–31.See comparison of Lateran 4 with Nicene and Constantinopolitan creeds in Foreville,LatranI, II, III et Latran IV, pp. 276–9.20‘Sub speciebus panis et vini’; ‘transsubstantiatis’; García,Lateran 4, p. 42; trans.DEC, I, 230.Morris,The Papal Monarchy, p. 512.21Foreville,Latran I, II, III et Latran IV, pp. 283–5.22‘Excommunicamus igitur et anathematizamus omnem heresim extollentem se adversushanc sanctam, orthodoxam et catholicam fidem, quam superius exposuimus’; García,Lateran 4, p. 47; trans.DEC, I, 233.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:25:42 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"that renders heresy general, however, also demands that error be understoodand dealt with in terms of these articles: that is, as a point of doctrine.Unlike previous councils the fourth Lateran dispenses with names entirelyin its general condemnation of heretics and instead denounces ‘all hereticswhatever names they may go under. They have different faces indeed but theirtails are tied together.’23The above phrase is drawn directly fromAd abolendamand from Innocent’s own decretal,Vergentis in senium, parts of which legisla-tion go into the make-up of this canon.24It is a characterization that reflects thefact that all error is now defined by the same rejection of Catholic doctrine,although the connection between these heretics is their pride, not their belief.Like heresy, heretics are generalized and no differentiation is made betweendifferent groups. The fourth Lateran treatment of heresy represents a move-ment from the brief, reactive, problem-specific articles of previous councils to auniversal condemnation of all heresy, defined here by opposition to a nowmore clearly defined orthodoxy.Regional councilsWhile the ecumenical constitutions were church-wide and concerned withdoctrinal definitions, it was in the regional church councils that much of thepractical and legal regulations for action against heresy were set out, and asignificant proportion of the body of laws that gradually came to comprise theprocedure of inquisition were also introduced by their canons. According toDossat’s overview of the development of inquisitorial law, after 1255, duringthe pontificate of Alexander IV, conciliar activity was practically nil and for themost part inquisitors were left to conduct their business under their ownsupervision.25He also observes that on the whole, Alexander’s output withregard to heresy did little more than reproduce earlier material; for Dossat, theperiod of real development was during the reign of Gregory IX, 1227–41.26Arnold identifies two phases to the accumulation of inquisitorial legislation,though he emphasizes that there is continuity between them and that the twoperiods are not entirely exclusive. The first, driven by considerations arisingout of the crusade, he places between 1227 and 1235. His second phase,between 1236 and 1254, is characterized by the emergence of a coherent andcomplete system, with different types of adherence to heresy properly definedand categorized.2793Who Walks in Shadow: The Canon-legal Perspective23‘Universos hereticos quibuscumque nominibus censeantur, facies quidem habentesdiversas, set caudas ad invicem colligatas’; García,Lateran 4, p. 47; trans.DEC, I, 233.24Vergentis in senium, García,Lateran 4, p. 49, lines 38–49; the council of Verona andAdabolendam, García,Lateran 4, p. 50, lines 64–75.25Dossat,Crises, p. 195.26Dossat,Crises, p. 108.27J.

The council ofToulouse, reiterating the provisions of the earlier council of Avignon, requiresthat each priest investigate heresy in his area, along with two or three laymen‘of good opinion’, and that this inquiry be ongoing; it is joined by the provisionthat the secular lord of an area and his bailiffs are also to inquire after heresy intheir jurisdiction.29This first lay inquiry into heresy is reiterated in 1246 atBéziers, and both are repeated by the council of Albi in 1254.30Despite theimportance of the laity in the initial stages of inquiry, and, post-conviction, innot supporting heretics once they have been identified, the church is careful toreserve to itself the right to label heretics: ‘no one is to be punished as abeliever or a heretic unless he has been judged a believer or a heretic by thebishop of that place, or by another ecclesiastical person who has the power todo so’.31The measures taken by all of these councils, with the exception of thecouncil of Tarragona, deal either with the initial seeking of heretics by the localclergy or the lord of the area or with their treatment after conviction.32Theyare aimed squarely at the repression and control of the heretic, and of theseveral categories of individual that are attached to him, through differentia-tion and punishment according to those categories.The different ‘categories’ of supporters, which indicated different grades of94Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century28Mansi, XXIII: Narbonne 1227, 19–26; Toulouse 1229, 191–204; Béziers 1232 (dated 1233 inMansi, see Dossat,Crises, p. 109), 269–78; Tarragona 1242, 553–8; Narbonne 1243 (dated1235), 353–66; Béziers 1246, 689–704; Valence 1248, 769–80; Albi 1254, 829–52.

It was during the course of the thirteenth century, however, that theyacquired their more precise meanings, as they came to be used in the context ofinquisition, though the exact boundaries between them remained problematicfor inquisitors throughout this period.33In all the conciliar material consideredhere, however, these groups remain distinct from the heretic proper.The definition of ‘heretic’ given by the key council of Tarragona is verybrief: ‘heretics are those who persevere in their error’. Heretics are definedalways in terms of belief, characterized as holders of error, and also by obsti-nacy in that error. Indeed, obstinacy appears at least as frequently as error inthe definition of a heretic. The first council of Béziers orders that all who areobstinate in their refusal to undergo their punishment – that is, who will notwear their crosses – are to be considered as heretics.34Further, the first canonof this council, which states that ‘heretics and their believers, supporters, theirreceivers and defenders, are to be excommunicated every Sunday’, then goeson, now omitting heretics deliberately from this list, to say that if one of ‘afore-said believers, supporters, receivers and defenders’, having been warned andexcommunicated by name does not return to their senses, if they impede theinquisition, or remain stubborn in their refusal to make restitution within fortydays of excommunication, then they should be punished as ‘heretics’, since itis just such perseverance in and defence of error that make a heretic, and thatin this instance effect a shift in status from follower to leader. This canon isrepeated by the second of the councils held at Béziers.35‘Heretics’ thus established at the top of the list and slightly apart, the othercategories are then listed relative to the heretics, the holders of belief. As withmany aspects of anti-heretical procedure, it is not until the council ofTarragona in 1242 that the terminology that describes the supporters of here-tics is explicitly defined in the conciliar legislation in a systematic way. Themethodical and comprehensive nature of the Tarragona constitutions can beattributed to the presence at the council of the Dominican and renownedcanon lawyer Raymond of Peñafort, compiler of the decretal collection thatappeared under Gregory IX’s name, and a former Master General of hisorder.36This is the only time in these councils that we see outlined in practical95Who Walks in Shadow: The Canon-legal Perspective33The councils of Narbonne in 1227, canon 15, Mansi, XXIII, 24–5; Toulouse in 1229, canon 1,Mansi, XXIII, 194–6; Béziers in 1232, canon 1, Mansi, XXIII, 270–71.34‘Heretici sunt, qui in suo errore perdurant’; Béziers 32, canon 4, Mansi, XXIII, 271.35‘Haeretici et eorum credentes, fautores, eorum receptatores et defensores, singulis diebusDominicis excommunicantur’; ‘praedictorum credentium, fautorum, receptatorum etdefensorum’; ‘cum perseverantia et defensio erroris in talibus hominem faciat haereticumjudicari’; Béziers 32, canon 1, Mansi, XXIII, 270, Béziers 46, canon 8, Mansi, XXIII, 693–4.Note, a town can also be suspected of heresy: ‘villa suspecta de haeresi habeatur’; Toulouse,canon 10, Mansi, XXIII, 196.36Raymond was elected Master General in 1238, a post he resigned two years later, see M.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:25:42 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"legal terms what is meant by the labels that are elsewhere used without defini-tion, and it is to Tarragona that commentators repeatedly return; as such, theywill be used as a guide to understand the broader ideas at work.What is immediately striking about the definitions of the different types offollower is the extent to which they are almost entirely based on specificactions. Most of the categories are relatively self-explanatory, with the excep-tion of thecredens, which carries a degree of ambiguity. Someone is ‘suspectedof heresy’ who has heard the preaching or reading of the heretics, prayed withor kissed them, or who believes them to be ‘good men’. Next are ‘celatores’and ‘occultatores’, concealers and hiders; a distinction of intention is madebetween the former, those who see heretics and do not reveal them, and thelatter, those who make a conscious choice before the fact not to reveal heretics.‘Receptatores’, or receivers, are those who knowingly receive heretics intotheir house twice or more, and give them hospitality. ‘Defensores’, defenders,knowingly defend heretics by word or deed. A supporter of heretics, or‘fautor’, is really a general term for those guilty of any or all of the above, or ofproviding any other help or advice. None of these lesser grades of hereticalinvolvement are characterized by an error of belief, but are defined primarilyby, and in terms of, physical actions and behaviour.What also emerges from the above definitions is the emphasis, madecontinually in these councils, on the individual supporter’s awareness of theheretic’s status as a heretic. Punishment falls on those who have knowingly,scienter, defended, supported or believed in heretics, or made the consciouschoice to hide them. In a broader way, the same emphasis on awarenessunderlies the prominence of suspicion in the councils, since the rumour andlocal reputation that was the basis for the launch of an inquisition, similarlyimplies a degree of understanding. Such knowledge must come primarilyfrom the public announcement of the names of heretics and supporters at thereading of the ban of excommunication which is to be held every Sunday andfeast day, according to the already quoted provision of the 1246 council atBéziers, as well as canon two of the same council: ‘if anyone has beenconvicted or has confessed this [knowingly allowing heretics to live on land],let him be denounced publicly and by name throughout the duration of hisexcommunication’.37Given that, from the council of Toulouse onwards,everyone is required at the age of discretion formally to abjure heresy, at least96Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth CenturyBrundage,Medieval Canon Law(London, 1995), pp. 222–3;SOPMA, III, 283;Dictionnaire despiritualité, ascetique et mystique: doctrine et histoire, 17 vols. in 21 (Paris, 1937–95), XIII,190–91.37‘Si quis autem de hoc convictus fuerit vel confessus, tamdiu excommunicatus nominatim etpublice nuncietur’; also ‘haeretici et eorum credentes, fautores, eorum receptatores etdefensores, singulis diebus Dominicis excommunicantur’; quoted above p. 95, n. 35, Béziers46, canon 2, Mansi, XXIII, 692.

Education in correct doctrine firstappears as an anti-heretical measure, along with public excommunication, inthe second council at Béziers, where it is stated that priests are to teach the arti-cles of faith on a Sunday and that boys are to be instructed in the faith. Thecouncil of Albi in 1254 repeats this and adds that the faith is also to beexplained when people take their oath to abjure heresy and uphold the Cath-olic faith.39The formal record of such an oath is a part of the shrewd use madeby inquisitors of their written records as a weapon in the control of heresy andundoubtedly there is a deterrent factor at work here, but there is also a concernto educate and an idea perhaps that heresy is fostered by ignorance. There is,in a negative way reminiscent of the fourth Lateran council, a construction ofheresy that is doctrinal in nature, though it is only hinted at here, and of layunderstanding and subsequent recognition of heresy in terms of error and notmerely as a list of names. What this also serves to highlight, however, is againthe fact that the focus of these regulations is almost never on heresy itself.Instead, they address the people involved in it, and the canons of the provin-cial councils rarely, if ever, address heretical belief in anything other than themost generic form. Though ‘error’ and ‘heresy’ are both mentioned they arenever described, nor are their content or nature expounded.40They appearprimarily as a condition of the heretic, whose status is defined by error, obsti-nately held and defended.41Intention is important to the definition of thelesser grades, but belief is not.The partial exception to this rule are the ‘credentes’, who seem at times tooccupy a sort of limbo between proper heretics and the lesser grades, and, likethe obstructive and the obstinate, can be subject to a shift in status. The councilof Tarragona’s definition of the ‘believer’ is even more cursory than that of the‘heretic’: ‘believers, in fact, in the said heresies are similarly to be called here-tics’.42Yetcredentesare not included in the penance assigned to heretics by thecanons of this council. At Narbonne, in the following year, heretics andcredentesare consistently equated in terms and in punishments. The generalpattern though, before Tarragona, and indeed after the Narbonne council, is toplace thecredenteswith thefautores,defensoresandreceptatores, in a bloc separ-ate from the heretics, as we saw in the first canon of the 1232 council of Béziers.97Who Walks in Shadow: The Canon-legal Perspective38Toulouse, canon 12, Mansi, XXIII, 196.

The blurring of the boundary between heretic and follower in the caseof thecredensis also in part the result of evolving ideas of the role of intentionand discernment in broader discussions of criminality, particularly pertinenthere in the realm of occult crime. All of which means that thecredensis themost fluid of all the categories of heretical supporter, which is one reason whyquestions on the exact nature of thecredenscontinue to dominate the legalconsultations sought by inquisitors in this period. Despite this overlap, for afollower to be regardedut hereticusnevertheless implies an understanding ofheretic as a distinct category, and, as a general rule, heretics and supportersstand apart, distinguished by error on the one hand and action on the other.The Narbonne council of 1243 states that heretics orcredenteswho avoidtheir penance ‘openly show their impenitence and false conversion’.44Although the categorization of suspects depends on actions, statements suchas the above would seem to suggest that these actions are seen to betray aninner allegiance or condition. The relationship between action and belief willbe examined further in the next chapter, but one aspect of this idea needs to benoted here: namely, that though the inner condition of these groups is notignored, neither is it prominent, nor connected to religious belief in any wayexcept, again, occasionally in the case ofcredentes. Indeed, the ultimate charac-teristic and definition of each of these lesser grades is that they are categorizednot by their connection to heresy, but to heretics: they are defenders,supporters, receivers of heretics. Most tellingly, evencredentesare usuallybelievers of heretics, and not of heresy, not of the error itself.It is not only by definition that heretics are differentiated from the othergrades of involvement, but also by the punishment and penances that areprescribed. Prison is the most common penance imposed on convicted here-tics, though at times its punitive function appears more conspicuous:according to the council of Toulouse heretics who confess spontaneously are toreceive penance, while only those who confess from fear can expect to beimprisoned. Later councils deny freedom to all converts, penitent or other-wise: a necessary measure, according to one council, because the conversion of98Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century43Toulouse, canons 17 and 10, Mansi, XXIII, 198, 196.

Here,‘heretics, persevering in their error’ are to be given up to the secular arm andprison is retained as a penitential measure.Perfecti haeretici, or fully fledgedheretics – that is, the heretical élite – if they wish to convert, must be preparedfor perpetual imprisonment.46The treatment is very brief in comparison withthe penances handed down for the other levels of involvement. Evencredentesare given much more opportunity to do penance outside prison, despite thefact that, according to the definitions given by this council, their legal status isthe same asheretici.Other punitive measures are imposed by these councils on those convictedas ‘heretics’ beyond a system of penance, and are again different from thetreatment of lesser grades. Like the social exclusion imposed by a prisonsentence, these measures also segregate heretics legally and politically. Thedisinheritance of heretics and their families that was introduced by InnocentIII inVergentis in seniumis reinforced in the regional meetings. Heretics, andthose suspected of being heretics, are barred from public office by the 1227council of Narbonne, although these provisions are revised in later councils,andhereticiare cut off from the more inclusive approach taken to the lessergrades.47Heretics are therefore represented as different from the other groups,distinguished by the presence of belief, the brevity of treatment given to them,and by the physical and legal exclusion from the main body of believers thatthe sentence incurs.48The councils assume an identification and trial processthat is happening elsewhere, taking for granted the labelled individual, a char-acteristic of the conciliar representation of the heretic that we can see also tosome degree in the ecumenical treatment.

Theyremain generic figures, only occasionally referred to by specific group names,though it is important to be aware that although ‘heretic’ is more often thannot a general term, it can at times also be understood to refer specifically to theCathars. Such a use is visible where ‘heretics’ are in direct contrast to anothergroup, usually the Waldensians.49In a regulation designed for general application such a generic type isnecessary: the case-specific treatment lies in the emphasis placed on the discre-tion of the judge and inquisitor by those councils that speak more directly totheir inquisitorial operatives: that is, those of Tarragona and Narbonne.Tarragona appeals to the discrimination of its judges in phrases such as ‘thediscerning judge’ and ‘let the judge beware’. More explicitly, Narbonneoutlines the importance of discretion and prudence to the Dominicans that itaddresses, telling them that they should impose penances ‘according to theirdiscretion ... carefully and prudently’, so that the way of life of the guilty iscorrected or at least ‘that they are able to show, who walks in shadow, who inlight; who is truly penitent, who falsely converted’. Perhaps most telling, thecanons of this council admit that discretion should ‘make up for what cannoteasily be understood by writing’.50The gap left by the councils here will bediscussed later. What matters as far as the regional councils are concerned isthat the representation of heresy that they contain consists of a variety ofactions that are performed in relation to heretics which have only an obliquebasis in error, and that they diffuse a typology of heretical support and avocabulary with which to describe it.TextbooksConcordia discordantium canonum51Gratian’sConcordia discordantium canonum, better known as theDecretum,became the standard canon-law textbook of the high medieval law schools andwas so widely adopted in the decade or so after its compilation that its appear-ance is now generally taken to mark the beginning of the ‘classical’ era ofcanon law.52The exact dating of theDecretumis disputed; although it has in100Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century49For the general use of heretics as synonymous with the Cathars in Languedoc, see J.Duvernoy, ‘L’acception: ‘haereticus’ (iretge) = ‘parfait cathare’ en Languedoc au XIIIesiècle’, inThe Concept of Heresy, ed.

It was the longer, second recensionthat came to represent the standard version used in later centuries.53For thisreason, it matters less for this study what differences there are between theoriginal and later versions in their treatment of heresy, as, by the thirteenthcentury, the longer version would have been the one that contemporarieswould have known and used.54As its title suggests, theConcordia discordantium canonumis constructedaccording to dialectical principles, a feature that made it very useful forteaching and which was one of the main reasons that it was adopted sobroadly. It is arranged over three parts: part one deals with specific topics andis divided intodistinctiones; part two presents samplecausae, or cases, and thenanswers the various questions that they raise; the third part, theTractatus deconsecratione, is concerned with sacramental and liturgical law.55Accompaniedby Gratian’s own remarks, ordicta, theDecretumsets out within this frame-work a collection of various canons, drawn from conciliar and decretal mate-rial and especially from writers of the early church, in order to explore andresolve contradictions in the canon-legal corpus.TheDecretumwas compiled a century before our period of study, but itscontinued primacy in the study of canon law in this and following centuriesmakes it crucial to the law of our period. Its influence can be seen throughoutthe constitutions of the fourth Lateran council, for example, and the specificinfluence of its provisions on heresy in particular is clear in the level to whichlater canon-legal texts on the subject continue to refer to the authority of thesecausaeas their starting point.56TheSumma de poenitentiaof Raymond ofPeñafort relies heavily on theDecretumthroughout its treatment of heresy,despite having been revised by Raymond in the same year that he completedthe compilation of theLiber extra.57TheDecretumalso provided the main101Who Walks in Shadow: The Canon-legal Perspective53Winroth uses ‘Gratian two’ to refer to the compiler of the second recension, while making itclear that this may not necessarily be a different individual from ‘Gratian one’; A.

As with the othercausae, they begin with an outline of a hypo-thetical situation from which all the questions that make up thecausaare thenderived.58Forcausatwenty-three Gratian posits a situation in which severalbishops have fallen into heresy and are beginning to compel the Catholicsaround them to follow suit. When their heresy is discovered military action isordered against them. Gratian’s questions centre on the church’s status in rela-tion to heretics and the majority of them concern the legitimate use of force: thefact that the bishops are heretical is not immediately important to the ques-tions that follow except as a device to allow the discussion of the use of forceagainst others. In thiscausa, question four, ‘whether punishment is to beimposed’, and question seven, ‘whether heretics should be stripped of theirown property and [any] church property [they happen to possess]? Andwhether they who possess heretical goods are said to possess alienatedproperty’, contain the most material on heretics specifically.59Causatwenty-four opens with a complementary scenario: a bishop, havingfallen into heresy, deprives others of their office and marks them with thesentence of excommunication. After his death he is convicted of heresy andcondemned, together with his followers and their households. The consequentsituation affords Gratian an opportunity to examine problems that arise withregard to the status of the accused, rather than of those taking action againsthim, as in twenty-three: that is, whether or not a heretic can deprive others ofoffice; whether a sentence of excommunication can be passed after death; andhow such a sentence should affect the rest of the individual’s household. It isthis third question that has the most to say about heresy as a subject in its ownright.The questions that Gratian seeks to answer in these twocausaeare oftentangential or unconnected to heresy itself: discussion of heresy is not the aimof the argument. Rather, like theexemplacollections, heresy appears in theDecretumwithin the boundaries set up by the hypothetical cases and the signif-102Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century58Winroth,Gratian’sDecretum, p. 34.59‘An vindicta sit inferenda’; ‘an heretici suis et ecclesiae rebus sint expoliandi?

Therefore, some canons, though not referringto heresy in their content, are nonetheless framed as pertinent to it, whileothers that talk specifically about heresy are presented as proving somethingunconnected.60It is only in the last part of twenty-four that heresy is thesubject of the questions as well as the material. In the earlier parts ofcausatwenty-four, and also in most of twenty-three, heresy forms much of thesubstance of the sources, but is more a part of the background to the discussionof other issues.Gratian on the whole used very little new material in the construction of histext, preferring instead to rely on more established sources, and these twocausaeare no exceptions.61A glance at the sources of the canons shows theoverwhelming presence of the works of the Fathers, especially Jerome and, incausatwenty-three particularly, Augustine, as well as the writings of the earlypopes, whose work makes up a good proportion of the material incausatwenty-four. Although the presence of heresy in the structure of the textsuggests that the questions it raised were not without contemporary relevance,the use of early material colours the background picture of heresy that isgained from reading these canons, a picture that was born out of a context verydifferent to that of theDecretum.Underlying much of this early material are heresies held and expounded byheretics who are on more level terms with their Catholic counterparts than theheretics of Gratian’s time, who can correspond with leading Catholic figureson points of doctrine and the validity of the church’s persecution of theirgroup.62Augustine seems to regard heretics as a stimulus to learning andgood teaching, in the mode of Paul’s teaching on the necessity of heresies.63Augustine’s arguments in his letter to Petilianus are perfect material forGratian’s discussion of the legitimate use of force, within which this excerptfalls, but they present at the same time an informed exchange between twoopponents writing within the same tradition as each other. Learning is alsoassociated with the heretics that these texts describe, whether in a straightfor-ward remark, such as Ambrose’s use of the term ‘heretical teacher’ in hiscommentary on Luke, or in a more developed description.64The parts ofPetilianus’ letter that are reproduced within Augustine’s are of the same char-acter and form. But the sense of academic enquiry is twisted: Leo I claims that103Who Walks in Shadow: The Canon-legal Perspective60For example, C.23 q.1 c.4, C.23 q.3 c.3 and 4, Friedberg, I, 892, 897, as opposed to, e.g. C.23q.4 c.25, Friedberg, I, 910–11.61Winroth,Gratian’sDecretum, p. 139.62C.23 q.1 c.4, Friedberg, I, 897; q.4 cc.7, 38, 40, Friedberg, I, 900, 917–18, 920–21; q.5 c.3,Friedberg, I, 930.63‘Cum interrogant nos ea, que nescimus, sic discutiamus pigriciam, et divinas scripturascupiamus ...

The last two sections of question three are the part of theDecretumthatdeals specifically with the position of heresy in law, and would therefore bethe first port of call for anyone looking for a canon-legal treatment of thesubject. As a result, several of the canons became central to subsequent treat-ments of heresy. They are contained in section four ‘what is the differencebetween schism and heresy, and who are heretics, and how many are the sectsof heretics’, and section five, ‘who in fact, should properly be called “here-tics”’.68These are two groups of texts that attempt a definition of heresy. Sectionfour comprises two extracts from Jerome, the first of which outlines the differ-ence between heresy and schism, the former being distinguished from thelatter by the possession of ‘perverse dogma’, which precipitates the separationfrom the church.69The second excerpt from Jerome is a definition of heresy, ‘socalled from the Greek “choice”’, though one that quickly becomes a definitionrather of the heretic: one who chooses a teaching, ‘disciplinam’, that seemsbetter to him, ‘anyone, therefore, who understands Scripture other than in thesense the Holy Spirit requires’. Section five is much longer, made up of twelvecanons, but it continues without pause to discuss the problem of definition:Jerome’s view of heresy is followed immediately by two extracts from Augus-tine on the same subject. The first defines the heretic more straightforwardly asone who ‘begets or follows false or new opinions’.70This is refined by the104Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century65‘Quid autem iniquius est quam inpia sapere, et sapientoribus doctoribusque non credere?’;C.24 q.3 c.30, Friedberg, I, 998.66‘Quod sophismatibus suis et arte dialectica sepe opprimant ecclesiasticos’; C.24 q.3 cc.36,33, Friedberg, I, 1000, 999.67C.24 q.3 c.27, Friedberg, I, 997–8.68‘Quid intersit inter scisma at haeresim, et qui sint heretici, et quot sint hereticorum sectae?’;‘qui vero proprie dicantur heretici’; C.24 q.3 cc.26–39, Friedberg, I, 997–1006.69C.24 q.3 c.26, Friedberg, I, 997.70‘Heresis grece ab electione dicitur’; ‘quicumque igitur aliter scripturam intelligit, quamsensus Spiritus sancti flagitat’; ‘falsas ac novas oppiniones gignit vel sequitur’; C.24 q.3cc.27, 28, Friedberg, I, 997–8.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:25:42 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"second, which emphasizes carefully that it is only the defence of error thatmakes a heretic: one who fails to reject his error even after the secondadmonition.The following five contributions, from Popes Urban and Leo and one moreeach from Augustine and Jerome, are really just variations on the two mainthemes established by the first four canons. It is the possession of dogma, orerror, that is the primary defining attribute of the heretics, who are consis-tently and exclusively identified by the fact, if not often the content, of theirerror. Beside error is the emphasis on obstinate belief in that error. Accordingto Augustine’s definition, those who, once corrected, return to the correctbelief must not be considered heretics.71The same theme of not only wrongbut obstinate belief is developed in the following canons, where defence eitherof one’s own error or of the error of others is added to the requirements forheretical status: ‘those who will not amend their dogmas, but persist indefending them, are heretics’, and ‘he who defends the errors of others is moredamnable than these ... he is to be called not only a heretic, but also aheresiarch’.72The remainder of this section is made up of four canons on relationsbetween the clergy and heretics and the legitimacy of their condemnation, andthe final canon, the longest by far of the extracts presented here, is lifted fromIsidore’sEtymologies. An already widely circulated text, the inclusion here ofthis excerpt from Isidore’s section on heresy extended its influence evenfurther and cemented its place at the heart of the legal idea of heresy. The longcanon that Gratian derives from this source is a list of the names of sixty-eightdifferent heresies. For each one is provided the derivation of the name, fromeither the author or the cause of the error, as well as one or occasionally twolines that describe the principal error of the sect: for example, ‘the Origenistsbegan with their founder, Origen; they say that the Son cannot see the Father,nor the Holy Spirit see the son’. The error given is nearly always doctrinal,occasionally behavioural, but remains, as it does in the formal definitions, theidentifying characteristic of heretics.73The authorities that make up the last part ofcausatwenty-four, and theideas that they embody, remain the principal starting point for canon-legalthought on heresy into and beyond the mid thirteenth century, though they donot necessarily remain static. Canons thirty-one and thirty-two, those thatextend the theme of obstinacy in defence introduced by Augustine, were105Who Walks in Shadow: The Canon-legal Perspective71C.24 q.3 c.29, Friedberg, I, 998.72‘Qui ... dogmata emendare nolunt, sed defensare persistunt, heretici sunt’; ‘qui aliorumerrorem defendit multo est dampnabilior illis ... non tantum hereticus, sed etiamheresiarcha dicenda est’; C.24 q.3 cc.31, 32, Friedberg, I, 998–9.73‘Origeniani Origene auctore exorti sunt, dicentes, quod non possit Filius videre Patrem, necSpiritus sanctus Filium’; C.24 q.3 c.39, Friedberg, I, 1001–6; trans.

The ordinary gloss written through the first half of the thirteenthcentury further emphasizes the theme to the point where the role of obstinacyin the definition of heretic, and in the delineation of the boundary betweenheretic and non-heretic becomes central to the reading and interpretation ofthese canons.75It is worth noting, in this connection, the tone taken by theDecretumtowardrepression. Much ofcausatwenty-three deals with the legitimacy of the use offorce, and it is within this discussion that the repression of heresy falls, ofwhich the overwhelming impression, from the sources chosen but also fromGratian’s framing of them, is of an emphasis on correction and conversionover punishment.76The question which discusses repression is summed up byGratian with the conclusion that ‘punishment should be imposed not throughthe love of punishment itself, but from zeal for justice; not for the expression ofhatred but the correction of wickedness’.77The attitude of theDecretumtowardheresy would be left behind to some extent, but the texts which made up thecollection, and in particular those of the latter sections ofcausatwenty-four,continued to be central to the idea of heresy, carrying with them thatdouble-edged definition of error and obstinacy that is so familiar. Once thefour texts that make up the definition of heresy are brought together in theDecretumthey appear frequently as a bloc in later writings: Raymond ofPeñafort’sSumma de poenitentia, for example, written in 1224–6 and revised in1234, opens its section ‘of heretics and their supporters’ with a summary of theabove definitions by Augustine and Jerome, together with some others thatRaymond has harvested from other parts of theDecretumthat pertain to sacra-mental error.78Similarly, Isidore’s list of heresies, extracted from its context106Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century74C.24 q.3 cc.31, 32, Friedberg, I, 998–9.75Gloss to ‘dixit apostolus’, Gratian,Decretum divi Gratiani, totius propemodum iuris canonicicompendium, summorum que pontificum decreta atque praeiudicia, una cum variis scribentiumGlossis et expositionibus(Lyons, 1560), col. 1403.

However their meaning is under-stood or manipulated, this set of texts continues to inform and underpin allsubsequent legal discussions of heresy.Decretales Gregorii IXPartly as a result of theDecretum, which had the effect of highlighting lacunaeand defects in the corpus, canon law developed at a greater rate after themiddle of the twelfth century and much new material was produced, mainlyin the form of the papal letter. After the pontificate of Alexander III, duringwhich the output of these documents increased exponentially, they werecollected systematically over time into compilations. The fiveCompilationeswere used alongside theDecretumuntil Gregory IX commissioned hisconfessor, Raymond of Peñafort, to gather and reconcile all the relevant mate-rial produced since theDecretuminto one new collection. The decretal collec-tion known as theDecretales Gregorii IX, or theLiber Extra, was published in1234, and soon took up a place next to theDecretumat the centre of legaleducation.79Its organization is more straightforward than that of theDecretum; the newmaterial is collected, in chronological order, under descriptive titles that arearranged within five books. In the fifth book, title seven,de hereticis, containstheLiber Extra’s material on heresy, sandwiched between titles on Jews andSaracens on the one hand, and Schismatics on the other, placing hereticsamong the confirmed enemies of the Catholic church.80Not all the materialcollected here is new: there are also additions from the same writers of theearly church that Gratian draws upon: Augustine, Gregory and other earlypopes. However, the majority of the texts that make up theLiber extra’s treat-ment of heresy were written against heresies which, as Pope Lucius III has it,‘began to break out and spread in modern times’, and reflect a much morerecent tradition of anti-heretical legislation than that represented in theDecretum, including the condemnation of Cathar heretics in canon twenty-seven of the third Lateran council and the whole of the fourth Lateran’s thirdcanon.81Next to the Lateran provisions this title also includes two of the mostimportant decretals to be issued against heresy.Ad abolendamwas first promul-gated in 1184 by Lucius III, in conjunction with Frederick I. Here wereformally instituted both the practice of episcopal inquisitions into heresy andthe obligations of support for the process and penalty from the secular authori-107Who Walks in Shadow: The Canon-legal Perspective79Brundage,Medieval Canon Law, pp. 53–5; P.

Theintroduction of this principle of Roman law into the ideas both of heresy andof papal power thus provided the justification for sentences of confiscationand death.83The other decretals in this title include some short contributionsfrom Gregory himself and two more from Innocent III,Si adversus nos, whichremoved notarial and legal support from heretics, and another that proscribednon-licensed preaching. These two, together withVergentis in senium, and thefourth Lateran constitution, make Innocent the most represented authority inthis title.84In terms of the way in which the decretals represent heresy, thetexts that followedAd abolendamandVergentis in seniumshare and indeedborrow so much of their language from the latter two that an examination ofthese two decretals can be considered representative of much of thismaterial.85With one eye on the past, Lucius’s decretal begins with a trope that wouldprovide a minor theme for several later works on heresy: the heresies of‘modern times’ standing in contrast to those that had gone before was a smallbut hereafter recurring motif of anti-heretical writing that also appears to haveset the tone for Innocent’s slightly apocalyptic opening toVergentis.

Frederick II also threw his weight behind the repression of heresy,which is central to the Constitutions of Melfi, orLiber Augustalis, that he issued in Sicily in1231, parts of which were later incorporated into a letter written to the authorities ofnorthern Italy by Innocent IV. Frederick’s text accepts the equation of heresy and treasonestablished by Innocent III and draws on all the language and imagery employed by thepapal decretals, emphasising in particular the hidden nature of the heretics and thepoisonous truth that lies beneath.

In its first third in particular the language is full of words andimages that convey ideas of pollution and corruption. There are severalstrands to this, and ideas of a ruined harvest – ‘the cornfields bring forth tares,or rather are polluted’, in which ‘the wheat dries, and fades into chaff’ – servenext to the vocabulary of disease and poison to characterize their subject.Heresy is ‘like cancer’, ‘creeping imperceptibly wider in secret’, or is the ‘thepoison of the Babylonian dragon in a golden chalice’, both of which images arealso used to reinforce the idea of false appearance that is inherent in thespeciespietatisquoted above and is continued throughout Innocent’s text. Severalanimal forms are also employed by Innocent to characterize the heretics thatare damaging the vine and the grain, some traditional – the wolves and thelittle foxes – some less so, such as moths.88The themes and images of corrup-tion and false appearance, in particular the appearance of piety, are picked upand reproduced throughout the subsequent decretals.Beyond the imagery and powerful language there is a broader constructionat work, of the general and undifferentiated heresy against which most of thenew material in this title directs its condemnation and prohibitions.Adabolendamdefends the unity of the church against the falsehood of heretics bythe issue of a universal condemnation of ‘all heresy, by whatever name it maybe called’.89Although a selection of names follows this sentence, including theCathars and the Poor of Lyons, the phrase, and the idea, became a standardrefrain in later works. The idea is also reinforced byVergentis, which paintsheretics as united in their falsehood, but it is in the fourth Lateran constitutionthat it finds its fullest expression, in the excommunication of canon three thatdefines its subject in reference to the creed of canon one, in what amounts to auniversal condemnation of a heresy made uniform through exclusion.The heresy of these texts is now about deception and danger. False appear-ance sits at the centre of that, but the impression is also conveyed by the more109Who Walks in Shadow: The Canon-legal Perspective86‘Sub specie pietatis virtutum eius, iuxta quod ait Apostolus, abnegantes’; X 5 7.9, Friedberg,II, 780, from II Timothy 3. 5.

The focus is lesson error and more on control and disobedience. The growth in the role ofobstinacy continues and is entrenched and extended by the prohibitions onunlicensed preaching. It continues that development that we saw begun in thecouncils of the twelfth century toward greater control of heresy and presents amuch more polemical and repressive approach than the more measured anddetached view of theDecretum.One point of comparison that has been frequently made between the twocollections is the difference in tone evident when the texts are placed inconjunction with each other. Gone is the corrective attitude dominant in theDecretum, and in its place there is an emphasis on punishment and eradication.The more coercive stance permeates the whole of title seven, including theolder material that makes up the first six, short chapters. The extracts chosenfrom the early authors for theLiber extraall embody a similar, less forgivingposition to the newer material. It is interesting to note on this point the diffi-culty that the decretists had with this development. While Raymond ofPeñafort seems to have taken the same line as Innocent, that heresy could beconsidered as treason, Maisonneuve demonstrates very clearly the ways inwhich other commentators onVergentistook issue with the harsh nature of thedisinheritance of heretics and points to the comparison that they made with anequivalent but more even-handed article of Roman jurisprudence. Initiallydrawn by Johannes Teutonicus, the comparison was carried to a fuller conclu-sion by both Vincent of Spain and Tancred, who openly came out in favour ofthe latter, more lenient precedent.90Sensitivity to this issue is also visible inoccasional comments in the gloss on theDecretum. Augustine’s quotation fromthe hundred and first Psalm, ‘the man that in private detracted his neighbour,him did I persecute’, is glossed ‘we are able to pursue [heretics] openly, not insecret’. Later, when Augustine repeats Paul’s words from first letter to theCorinthians, that an evil man should be delivered to the devil ‘for the destruc-tion of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved’, the gloss adds ‘just as we deliverheretics to the authorities’.91Whatever scholarly opinions surrounded the changes represented by theselaws, however, the difference in approach to the repression of heresy alsoresulted in a difference in the way that heresy itself was represented. The textsof the earlier compilation always portray the heretic as the outsider, thenon-Catholic element. In canons nine, ten and eleven of the first question of110Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century90Maisonneuve,Études, pp. 277–86.91‘Detrahentem secreto proximo suo, hunc persequebar’; ‘manifeste vos possumus persequi,non latenter’; ‘possem quidem dicere ipsum satanam omnibus malis hominibus essepeiorem, cui tradidit Apostolus hominem in interitum carnis; ut spiritus sit salvus in dieDomini Iesu’, based on I Cor 5. 5; ‘sicut nos tradimus hereticos principibus’; C.23 q.4 c.40,Gratian,Decretum divi Gratiani ... cum variis scribentium Glossis, ‘h’ and ‘k’, col. 1302.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:25:42 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"causatwenty-four Gratian seeks to answer the question of whether or not aheretic (and this extends more broadly to the excommunicate in general) candeprive others of orders, a question more concerned with the status andauthority of the clergy than with the heresy itself. The implication that theprocess of answering this question has for the heresy involved is primarily thatheretics, being excommunicate, are characterized by an outsider status. Theyare something apart from and outside of the Catholic Church, but it is madeclear that this is through their own agency.92The theme of the heretic asoutsider in fact dominates the tone of this question as a whole.93In this much,the two collections are very similar, but where in theDecretumthere is a sensethat these individuals have removed themselves from the church by virtue oftheir error and through their own choice, the twelfth- and thirteenth-centurytexts that make up theLiber extratreatment, and the fourth Lateran constitu-tion especially, are proactive in excluding heresy and its adherents on Catholicterms, an emphasis that is reinforced by the gloss, which throughout definesheretics as those not observing what the church deems to be correct. Hereticsare now outside because the church has put them there.Connected to this is a greater emphasis on the figure of the heretic in theLiber extra, to the exclusion of heresy as error. The doctrinal nature of the here-tic’s status and the choice of erroneous belief that were so strong in the earliertext are now largely absent, and a heretic in the texts of theLiber extraisdefined by the judgement and sentence of the church, not the false doctrineand misapplied learning of Gratian’s collection. Here the heretic is even more‘ready-made’: no space is given to identification or definition, and the primarybusiness is with the treatment of heretics. Part of this increased emphasis onthe figure is a result of the extension of the range of the subject, which nowalso includes the various categories of followers, who are even more divorcedfrom the error than the heretics appear to be, being described and condemnedpurely in terms of their affiliation to the heretics. Individual holders of aheterodox belief are no longer the location of the heresy discussed by thesesources and collections, and the focus of the canon-legal treatment of heresy isnow concentrated on a much wider range of involvement.To try to draw some of these threads together: the twelfth-century conciliarview progressed toward a representation of heresy that was increasinglygeneral, though it remained based on the actions of those involved. At anecumenical level in particular this meant that by our period, in the constitu-tions of the fourth Lateran council where heresy was defined by exclusionfrom Catholic doctrine, all heresies were now included under one, verygeneral understanding of the term, though at the same time that shift also111Who Walks in Shadow: The Canon-legal Perspective92‘Quo a nobis separamini’; C.24 q.1 c.38, Friedberg, I, 982; Lenherr,Gratian, pp. 51–2.

A similardevelopment can be seen in the treatment of the heretic figure, always the realsubject of conciliar action, but now increasingly undifferentiated. Heretics arealso more numerous: a growing emphasis can be seen in the council of Toursand in the third Lateran council on the spread of heretics through differentlands, which becomes wider still at Verona in theAd abolendamdecree thatdescribes heretics in ‘in most parts of the world’.94As the heretic becomes more generic the group surrounding him becomesincreasingly differentiated with the gradual accumulation of other categoriesof involvement.95The subject of anti-heretical legislation becomes morediverse, including a range of other figures defined by their actions toward andrelationship to heretics. In turn, the heretics themselves seem to take on thefunction of a focal point for the status of these categories and, in many places,especially in the regional councils, they are often not the main subject of themeasures being put in place. Like the texts of theLiber extra, the regional coun-cils pay almost no attention to doctrinal error. Arnold has described the veryphysical nature of the search for heresy in this period of legislation, whichconcentrates more on finding heretics than discovering error.96For all that,neither do these councils spend much of their time talking about hereticsproper; they are concerned primarily with the practical process of findingthem and limiting their support. In common with that of the decretals and theecumenical councils, the regional treatment of heretics seems based on asimilar idea of a generalized heretic. Though here it is perhaps the focus onactions, and on dismantling their social and political network of support, thatproduces this effect, the underlying idea must be the same.There is a great deal of similarity between the ecumenical council view andthat of theLiber extra, not least because the latter contains significant parts ofthe former, but also as a result of the inclusion of so much of Innocent III’swork. It is perhaps important to note in this context that the individualdecretals were not, as the ecumenical constitutions were, universally binding,but were directed at particular groups or regions, a fact that some decretists,mentioned above, used to delimit the theoretical application of the confisca-tion laws.97The inclusion of these texts in theLiber extra, however, meant thatthe ideas contained in them were widely diffused. One of the more significantof these ideas was the equation of heresy with public crime – in particular, thatof treason. The punitive and increasingly harsh measures taken against here-112Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century94‘Plerisque mundi partibus’; X 5 7.9, Friedberg, II, 780; trans. E.

It has already been made clear that thistext continued to play a central role in canon-legal thought throughout ourperiod. Much use was made of the constituent parts of its discussion of heresy,in particular the definitions and the list of heresies from Isidore, but perhaps,at least in the majority of the anti-heretical legislation that we have looked at,the texts that make up the collection were not used with the same purpose forwhich Gratian included them.99The predominantly doctrinal view of heresy isabsent, though implicit in the fourth Lateran constitution. Certainly the tone ofcorrection seems to have been left behind, although some commentators andcanonists, as Maisonneuve suggests, tried to strike a more restrained note.100The canon-lawyer Gui Foulques, who will be discussed in the next chapter,seems to have embodied this more nuanced approach in his consultation, verypopular with inquisitors, which addressed the categories of guilt. With this inmind, let us now turn to look at the sharp end of this legislation, as manifestedin the products of inquisition.113Who Walks in Shadow: The Canon-legal Perspective98An example of ‘the close links between academic legal theory and legal practice during thisperiod’ described by Landau, ‘The Development of Law’, p. 132.99The influence of this section of Isidore would also have been reinforced by its independentdiffussion as part of this very popular text; see below, p. 181, n. 101.100Maisonneuve,Études, p. 286.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:25:42 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"4High is the Heart of Man:Inquisition TextsAltum est cor hominis et inscrutabile1Although the organized repression of heresy had its foundations in the legis-lation of the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, the formal practice ofinquisition into heretical depravity was put in place during the pontificate ofGregory IX. The use of the old legal method ofinquisitiofor the investigationof heresy had been introduced and adapted by Innocent III. Unlike the tradi-tional method ofaccusatio, which depended on proactive witness testimony,an inquisition allowed the judge to act on his own authority, on the basis offama. An ideal tool for investigating a hidden crime, it quickly became thenormal form of procedure against heresy.2Several of the regional councils, inparticular those at Narbonne in 1227 and Toulouse in 1229, were central tothis process, but the official beginnings of inquisition can be found in the bullIlle humani generis, first issued in 1231, and the decretalExcommunicamus, alsoof 1231.3In the context of repression, inquisition into heretical depravity, as it wasalways called, came to embody a highly specialized expertise and developedan impressive documentary tradition that was its ultimate source of power.4Each stage of the process of an inquisition produced documentary records,from the initial abjurations and confessions to records of the depositions andthe sentences and penances imposed, which were carefully collected andpreserved. Together, these records produced a profile of the levels of heresy ina region, and, even if a deponent knew nothing, that fact was still recorded1141Foulques,Consilium, q.9, p. 196.2Dossat,Crises, p. 107;Dictionary of the Middle Ages, ed.

These latter two categories of texts, together with the registers of theinquisition process itself, constitute the majority of the written product ofinquisition, and it is with these that this chapter is concerned.As with the previous two chapters, the lines of division between one set oftexts and another are not always rigid or easily discernible, and there is acertain amount of overlap between some of the inquisition texts and the legalmaterial of the previous chapter: the canons of several of the councils, forexample, especially Tarragona and Toulouse, were often included as legalconsultations in document collections. This chapter is, however, concernedwith only one specific and specialized aspect of the legal repression of heresy –the texts designed solely and specifically for the legal inquisition of heresy,rather than the general legal texts of the previous chapter.Legal consultationsThe legal consultation, essentially a response by a lawyer or lawyers to ques-tions asked on a given topic, was not a form exclusive to the practice of inquisi-tion, but as lists of questions, asked of legal experts by those engaged in therepression of heresy, our consultations tell us some part of what it was thatinquisitors wanted to know. Although requested by particular individuals andoccasionally referring to very particular cases, they were nonetheless copiedand used by others where their questions and answers were more widelyapplicable.115High is the Heart of Man: Inquisition Texts5Given,Inquisition and Medieval Society, pp. 26–8.6See below, p. 122.7Douais,Documents: Textes, p. 244, n. 1; p. 273, n. 4.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:27:29 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Consultation of John of Bernin8Sent in 1235, by John, then papal legate for the repression of heresy in theNarbonne area, to the Dominican prior for Provence, Romeo.Consilium peritorum Avinionensium quo declaratur qui dicuntur credentes9A short but significant text, this consultation was written in 1235 by theDominican prior and four lawyers at Avignon as a response to an enquiryfrom the Dominican William of Valence and two other men, who were seekingadvice on the different types of guilt.Consultation of Peter Collemieu10Written probably in 1246 by Peter, who was bishop of Albano and cardinallegate between 1243 and 1246.

Where they do ask questions about heresy they tend to be on tech-nical points and are overwhelmingly concerned with the divisions between thedifferent grades of guilt, the different categories of follower outlined by theregional councils. From the twoConsilia peritorumand the consultation of Johnof Bernin, to the canons of the councils of Tarragona in 1242 and Narbonne in1243, to the consultations of Collemieu and Foulques, the same sorts of ques-tions are asked: what is acredens? How does one distinguish between differentgrades? The predominance of such questions, and the legal construction ofheresy that follows from dealing with it in this context, means first that heresyis presented in a way that is very like that of the regional councils – mainlyphysical and external – and that this in turn has implications for the manner inwhich the heretic himself is constructed.John of Bernin’s consultation of 1235, written early in the life of the papalinquisition, while very short and concerned really with procedural issues,provides a clue to the way in which the information on heresy in these textsshould be understood. Bernin tells Romeo that he should require deponents toconfess publicly, ‘according to the quality of guilt’.16This phrase is echoed adecade later in Peter Collemieu’s longer text, which states that deponentsshould be punished ‘according to the quality of transgression’ and that,‘according to the quantity and quality of transgression, they are to be punishedwith the penalty for relapses’.17The main principle of engagement with heresyis a concern to establish the precise quality of guilt. In practical terms it meansthat what descriptions and treatments of heresy these texts do present tend torevolve around the definition of different categories of involvement and of theboundaries between them.TheConsilium peritorum Avinionensium quo declaratur qui dicuntur credentes,as its title would suggest, answers really only one question: what is acredens?117High is the Heart of Man: Inquisition Texts14In BAV MS Vat.

Apart from their belief, the Avignonlawyers define acredensin terms of their actions towards heretics, in somecases with actions such asvisitareorreciperethat elsewhere tend to warrant adifferent and lesser category: acredenswill have confessed to heretics, eatenwith them, been taught by them, visited them or heard their preaching, orreceived them or done them favours.18At the other end of the scale, both in terms of chronology and of detail, theconsultation of Gui Foulques, the fullest and most detailed of these consulta-tions, nonetheless presents a similar picture. Foulques’s consultation againdevotes much of its space to answering questions on the authority of inquisi-tors, but there are also questions devoted to a variety of categories:fautores,receptatores,defensores. Each of these categories is defined wholly in terms ofactions. The only exception to this pattern in Foulques’s text, as in the Avignontext, is in his definition of acredens, which begins with belief in heretics butthen continues as a series of actions.19The prevalence of actions in the inquisi-tion view of heresy has been noted often in studies of the texts that emergefrom the process, and the legal consultations, like the regional councils towhich they are in many ways similar, share that preoccupation.20The defini-tions they give rest almost exclusively on behavioural criteria, on measurableand perceivable actions, something reflected even in the names given to thedifferent categories.The predominant position given to actions in the identification of the guiltyis not something that has escaped the attention of Gui Foulques either,however, who spends several lines in justifying the use of exterior facts in thedemonstration of interior condition:For a presumption about disposition is to be made from external acts, as is ar-guedXXXII, q.

He shows Gui Foulques once again taking a more measured line thancontemporary legislation, in particular that of the council of Narbonne, whichtook actions as clear evidence of guilt. Foulques counsels instead that motivemust also be taken into account.24The latter point is a key to what is going on here. The analyses by Arnoldand Biller mean that we can feel secure in understanding that the inquisitors’interest in actions was as signs of inner state, but if we look again at the quota-tion from Gui Foulques above we see that it is not belief that is being sought,but intention. The consistent emphasis that we saw in the councils on theseactions being donescienterwould reinforce this, and the impression isstrengthened further by the provisions of the Tarragona council. In answer tothe question of whether suspects should be considered as believers Raymondanswers no, ‘unless he is so learned or discerning that he cannot put forward[the plea of] ignorance’. Similarly, no one is to be judged a heretic or acredens‘unless he is so literate or discerning that he cannot be in any way excused onthe grounds of simplicity or ignorance’. In both cases, the ultimate decision isleft to the discretion of ‘a discerning judge’, but the fact that a person isthought to have the capacity to understand the implications of their action, iseither literate or discriminating, will tell against any denial of guilt.25119High is the Heart of Man: Inquisition Texts666).

Thecredensis, after all, not abeliever of heresy, but of heretics: in the same terminology as the churchcouncils, both Gui Foulques and the anonymous author of theConsiliumperitorum super quibusdam dubitabilibusrefer to them ascredentes hereticorum.26Even where they are believers of errors, those errors are firmly attached to,and mediated by, heretics: they arecredentes hereticorum erroribus. Belief inheretics, belief in their errors or belief in their condition as good men are,according to theConsilium peritorum Avinionensium, one and the same.27Thatequation has the effect of rendering the error of belief as a single article, thebelief in the otherwise unspecified errors of unspecified heretics, and meansthat the nature of those errors is immaterial. Although, as Arnold demon-strates, the question of belief undoubtedly remained a problematic one forinquisitors, it was in this way at least made into a question that was univer-sally applicable. The fault lies in the fact of belief, not the error of it, and cantherefore be answered in the single question, ‘did you believe the heretics, orwhat they said?’ A distinction is being made here between a relationship toerror, which defines the heretic, and a relationship to a person, which definesthecredens, and indeed all the lesser grades of guilt. In fact, Foulques himselfemphasizes the importance of exactly this distinction in the case ofdefensores,distinguishing between those who defend error – that is, heretics – and thosewho defend people.28In this way, then, believing, or believing incorrectly,which is what we would usually understand heresy to be, and what GuiFoulques defines it as, is here transformed into one more verb in the list ofculpable actions.The other effect of the distinction that these texts draw between error andperson is to separate the ‘heretic’ from the larger group, reflecting the similar120Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Centuryadeo litteratus sit et discretus quod nullatenus per simplicitatem vel ignorantiam valeatexcusari’; ‘quod arbitrio discreti judicis duximus reliquendum’; Selge,Texte, pp. 53, 57.

The hereticis the object of all the verbs that designate guilt, or as the paradigm by whichothers will be judged.29Despite Collemieu’s injunction that ‘inquisition is to bemade for the ... investigation ofhereticos perfectos’, almost no provision is madefor this eventuality.30There is some overlap with thecredentes, with whomthey are sometimes associated, in such statements as ‘they are not believers,nor heretics, but supporters’, though it is for this reason that the ever-cautiousGui Foulques emphasizes that the charge ofcredensis a serious one, andshould not be made lightly.31Otherwise the heretic is an outside figure, withlittle real presence except as the focal point for the actions of the followers andas the locus of the error and ritual, distinguished from others by their relation-ship to error. Though occasionally differentiated by name, as the Waldensianssometimes are, and though we can probably assume that ‘heretics’ usuallyindicates Cathars in the southern French tradition, with error reduced to alabel, heretics are doctrinally homogenous.What we see here, then, is heresy not as a series of beliefs, but as a series ofactions, all revolving around an abstracted figure. The virtue of this, from alegal point of view at least, is that, as such, heresy and all its characteristicsbecome generic and, because dependent on actions and devoid of doctrinalcontent, universally applicable. This is not the idea of heresy that derives froma theological standpoint; where ‘heresy’ is used here, it has a general sensewhich encompasses all the actions and levels of involvement relating to theheretics and their errors. Although Gui Foulques employs legal authorities as atheologian might use Scripture, heresy in these texts is a legal error, not adoctrinal one: it is a crime and is talked about in these terms, described hereand elsewhere in terms of the equations made in canon law with secularcrimes of treason and theft.32The product of inquisitionWe now leave behind our consultations, with their advice on the correctprocess of inquisition, and move to those texts generated by the process itself,the depositions of witnesses before the inquisitors and the sentences andpenances imposed upon them.

Gui Foulques isalways careful to draw a line between heretics and others where there is a danger of confu-sion, and emphasises several times that the seriousness of a charge of heresy should meanthat judgements ought always to err on the side of caution.32The description in the anonymousConsilium peritorum super quibusdam dubitabilibusis that‘omnes criminosi et infames in heresi crimine admittuntur etiam principes criminis sicut incrimine lese maiestatis’; BAV MS Vat.

The date of its use is hard to ascertain; the manu-script is fourteenth-century, but the documents that comprise it, where theyare dated, are from the 1240s and 1250s. Several of these documents find theirway into the inquisitors’ manual in MS Vat Lat 3978 (see below). The secondgroup of texts is theLiber inquisitionisof Orvieto, a register of the sentencesimposed by the inquisitors Ruggero Calcagni in 1239 and 1249 and brotherGiordano in 1263.40According to Lansing, the marginalia of the manuscriptsuggest that it was kept as a treasury document.41Before looking at these texts in detail it is important to note the difficulties thatthey present to the historian. These difficulties, which have been brought tolight in a succession of studies, most notably by Herbert Grundmann andGrado Merlo, and more recently by Caterina Bruschi, relate principally to theprocesses by which these documents were produced. The stages of translationthrough which they passed, from vernacular to Latin, from oral to written, andfrom the first person to a third-person narrative, mean that their apparentlysmooth texture is in fact composed of several layers. This multi-layered struc-ture naturally poses a variety of problems when trying to reach the ‘truth’ thatthey contain about heresy, not least the danger of circularity – namely, that theinformation contained by the records is the information that the inquisitorsasked for. It is important to be aware in this context that what appears to be aspontaneous confession is usually in fact rendered as such from a list of closedquestions and their answers.42123High is the Heart of Man: Inquisition Texts38Tocco, edition of documents pp. 34–60 (pp. 61–78 contain further documents too late for thisstudy).39D’Alatri,Orvieto, edition of documents pp. 171–338.40Parts of the formulary are also in BAV MS Vat.

Of course their interest inthis context is still as a record, though of the ideas and constructs used bythose involved in their creation, rather than an individual’s involvement withheresy, but they are also to some degree being treated as ‘texts’ in thesource-critical sense and, as Arnold suggests, examined for their language andthe rhetoric to which that language is harnessed.43One more point must be mentioned in the context of this chapter: though thereare variations in the content of the information between the documents ofdifferent regions, in the names given to heretics, for example, or in the proportionof male to female heretics that appear, the type of information that is sought, thepattern of the questions and the essential framework of the documents remain thesame. Indeed, most of the variations in this genre would seem to result more fromdifferences between inquisitors than any regional peculiarities.Unsurprisingly, there are several similarities between the representation ofheresy that we find in these inquisition documents and that which emergesfrom the reading of the consultations and the regional council material.Perhaps the biggest similarity lies in the role played by the heretic in thescheme of guilt and involvement, although there is also a disparity here in thatthe inquisition documents, built around real, named individuals and thedetails of their networks and itineraries, present a much fuller and moreimmediate picture of the heretics themselves than do the legal and conciliartexts. We will look first at the picture of heretics that the inquisition materialsprovide before moving on to look more closely at the role that they play.As with the other legal texts that we have looked at, there is in the inquisi-tion material a layer of heretics proper, a level of involvement that is not onlyhigher than that of the others, but somehow apart from them, a distinctionachieved most obviously through the terminology used to describe them. TheOrvieto register stands out among these texts for the ornate and almostpolemical language with which it describes heretics, employing a great deal offairly standard imagery, but, for the most part, heretics are distinguishedfirstly by their name. Though all the deponents may be involved in ‘heresy’,only the élite and the obstinate become ‘heretics’. The label is usually furtherrefined by the use of terms such asheretica indutaor, occasionally, the Cathartermboni homines. The Italian records useheretici consolatiwith somefrequency; the Tuscan register sometimes also makes this a noun,consolati,tostand for heretics proper, though, interestingly, in this collection of texts, thereseems occasionally to be a distinction drawn between heretics and consoled124Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth CenturyCasasco (1373)(Turin, 1977); C.

Not least of these is the pastoral activity of the heretics. Theirpreaching and their administration of sacrament and ritual to their followersis an omnipresent element in the depositions, apparent in the background ofall the testimony here. Indeed, the southern French heretics are extremelymobile, moving frequently between houses and also, from time to time, backand forth to nearby Lombardy, where conditions seem to have been morefavourable.47Lombard connections are noticeable in the earlier Carcassonnerecords of Bernard of Caux and of the Carcassonne notary, but are far moreprominent, perhaps unsurprisingly, in the registers of Renous of Plassac andPons of Parnac, which are filled with depositions from a time when many ofthe Cathars had fled the south of France for the relative safety of Lombardy.48As has been made well known by specialists on the theme of women andheresy, a number of the active élite are female: they are not frequent, but theycan be found in all our sources, especially perhaps in the Tuscan records.49Doat 23 contains one long deposition from Arnaude, who had been a ‘con-soled’ heretic for many years; even in Peter Cellan’s brief penances there ismention of female heretics preaching and of a Waldensian sister expoundingScripture.50Exposition itself is rarely mentioned, and equally rarely described, thoughthe depositions against Peter Garcias, which even include the supportingScriptural authorities, are a marked exception to this. There is, however, a faintbut fairly continuous presence of heretical books to be found in these docu-125High is the Heart of Man: Inquisition Texts44‘Quidam heretici, tres vel iiij, ex quibus erant duo consolati’. ‘Vested heretic’, for example:Douais,Documents: Textes, p. 28, Doat 23, fol. 48v; ‘good men’, for example: Doat 23, fol. 119r,d’Alatri,Orvieto, pp. 202, 249, Tocco, pp. 36, 35, 43, 50.

One deposition of Doat 25 records the possession by heretics of booksnot only in the vernacular, but also in Latin, of which they also seem to bemaking copies. The deponent who provided this information was supposedlyguarding the books for the heretics, a situation that, apart from ritual, is themost common context in which we find books. Interestingly, the same depo-nent claimed also to have studied the books and formed his (heretical) beliefon the basis of what he read in them, though this may simply be a moreliterary version of the ‘nobody taught me; I thought it up myself’ dodge thatdeponents sometimes use to avoid implicating others.51What is never, oralmost never, recorded is the content of the books mentioned, or, for thatmatter, of the sermons that the deponents attended.52What does emerge is apicture of a highly mobile and, above all, organized group with its own hier-archy composed of the ‘deacons’ and ‘bishops’ who make appearances fromtime to time, and which was still strong in the south of France evenmid-century: Peter Cellan’s register of penances records an occasion on whichseventy heretics were present in one house, and, by the time of the registersurviving in Doat 25, the Cathars still appears to have an fairly sophisticatedhierarchy in place.53Despite this apparent success heretics are also shown as hidden, and manyof their activities are undertaken in secret. The hiding place is a well-established topos in the Catholic representation of heresy; heretics or theirmeetings are often located underground, in a ‘den’ or ‘lair’, an image associ-ated with ideas of heresy as an infection or pollution and enshrined inanti-heretical legislation, in which edicts of the councils demand that the phys-ical places of heresy be destroyed. In this way it is also present in the sentencesof inquisition. An Orvieto sentence decrees that the house of the condemned isto be razed to the ground as a ‘squalid refuge that was a den of perfidies’.54Ina similar way the Orvieto formulary condemns a house as a ‘perpetual refugeof filth, where at times there was a den of heretics’.55Thelatibulumconstructs a physically hidden heresy, in parallel to thehidden moral condition that we have seen emphasized elsewhere, but there isalso a layer of hiddenness that is more straightforwardly to do with avoidingpersecution. Indeed, for all its traditional resonance, thelatibulumitself couldnonetheless be a real enough place. The deposition of Austorga of Rosenges islargely taken up with descriptions of moving and hiding various heretics from126Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century51Use of books (vernacular) Doat 25, fol. 197v(Latin) fols. 198r, 199r.

One heretic,already in residence, would not eat without hersocia, and so Austorga foundthe heretic’s companion and led her to her house, where ‘she opened a certainlittle door and went in to the other heretic, and she placed both heretics in alarge cask’.56As extraordinary as that sounds, some further explanation canperhaps be found in the later deposition of her neighbour, Arnold of Bonhac,whose wife sees heretics hiding in the cellar of the Rosenges’s house, ‘wherethere is a certain “cell”’, testimony that seems to suggest a specialized here-tic-hiding facility beneath Austorga’s house.57If the hiddenness is real, then, in the French material, a change is visibleover time: Arnaude of Lamothe’s descriptions of her early life as a Catharinclude the presence of several publicly maintained Cathar houses, somethingalso found in Dyas of Deyme’s testimony; in both cases these date from thefirst decade of the thirteenth century. In the later phase of her heresy, however,after a brief return to the Catholic faith, Arnaude spends most of her time as a‘Good Woman’ moving covertly between different hiding places, often locatedin woods.58Despite the covert nature of southern French heresy toward the middle ofthe century it is nonetheless also possible to find disputations in this region.Undoubtedly one of the most entertaining of Douais’Documents pour servir àl’histoire de l’inquisitionare those depositions before Bernard of Caux and Johnof St-Pierre of a group of Franciscan friars who appear to have taken it in turnsto hide in the rafters of their house in order to eavesdrop on a dispute betweenone of their number and a localcredens.59That dispute was conducted inprivate, but there are also many witnesses to public debate in Cellan’s register,not only between heretics and Catholics but between different heretical groupsas well, and one witness before the inquisitors at Toulouse remembers a localcleric, later burnt for heresy, arguing with the mendicant preachers over theconsecration of the host.60As in the polemics, a similar picture emerges from127High is the Heart of Man: Inquisition Texts56‘Aperuit sibi hostiolum quoddam et intravit ad alia hereticam et reposuit ambas hereticasin quodam dolio’; Doat 24, fol. 2v.57‘Ubi est quoddam clusellum’; Bibliothèque municipale, Toulouse, MS 609, fol. 200r.Asimilar small underground hiding-place is described in the deposition of Arnaude ofLamothe, who hides ‘subtus terram in quadam domuncula per unum mensem’; Doat 23,fol. 22v.

The level of detail that the depositions provide about the movementsof heretics and connections between them and their followers is a result of theinterest of the inquisitors in obtaining information about the local networkthat can be used to control and dismantle it. A large part of inquisition isindeed about police work, and it is information of this sort that makes up thevast proportion of the content of these sources.63The main agenda of the inter-rogations visible in these depositions, therefore, seems to be the acquisition ofinformation – names, dates and contacts – that will allow the removal of mate-rial support from the heretical networks. That agenda is visible quite clearly inthe penalties that the registers record: it is noticeable in Peter Cellan’spenances, for example, that those who receive the harshest penalties are thosewho have provided property or land for the heretics’ use. Gaubert Sicard ofCourande, who allowed the Cathars to keep a ‘hereticated house’ on his land,for which the heretics paid him, seems to have had little more to do with themother than to bring them their groceries; nonetheless he is sent to exile inConstantinople, it would seem indefinitely.64Similarly, the Orvieto sentencesare almost entirely material in their nature, dealing out confiscation anddisinheritance, but very little in the way of crosses and pilgrimage.65If welook ahead to one of the inquisitors’ manuals, theOrdo processus narbonensisregards deprivation of goods as the most effective remedy against heresy: ‘wecause the goods of heretics, the condemned and the imprisoned as well, to beconfiscated, and we insist that this be done, as we are duty bound to do. It is inthis way that heretics and believers are particularly confounded.’66128Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century61‘Vidit patarenos in Crimona [sic] loquentes et disputantes’; d’Alatri,Orvieto, p. 231.62‘Disputantem de heresi cum Guilielmo notario’; Tocco, p. 51.

The names of those who were presentat rituals are sought and noted, and details of the ritual itself are included in asmuch as they determine the level of adherence – if you were at the adorationdid you also bend your knee; did you say bless?67Attendance of hereticalsermons and debates are a mark of guilt, but the contents of those sermons arenot. Peter Daide is asked not about the subject of the sermons he heard, onlyabout the fact of his, and others’, attendance.68While a picture of heretics doesemerge from these sources, in some ways in spite of the direction of the ques-tioning, the actual construct of the heretic is similar to that of the consultationmaterial: heretics remain in some ways in the background and, although theyare more common in some registers than in others, they are only occasionallythe deponent before the inquisition. Mostly heretics are a constant but more orless distant presence, as the axis around which activities and guilt revolve,including, for many deponents, belief: there is only one penance among thosein Cellan’s register that includes any reference to error, a condensed andabbreviated version of Cathar doctrine which contains very little else abovethe usual belief in the salvific abilities of sect and heretics.69Heretics are mostoften the object of those verbs that the consultations and councils use to defineguilt and which separate heretics from the raft of their supporters andbelievers.70In light of this we can now turn to look more closely at the representation ofheresy in the inquisition texts, and what relationship this representation haswith that of the consultations in particular. At a broad level, one similarity hasalready been highlighted, that which lies in the role played by the heretic inrelation to the wider group. There is, as noted, a technical distinction betweenthe heretics and the followers who make up the majority of the depositions, adistinction that is made in two main places, the first and most obvious ofwhich has been described: the terminology used to describe them. The positionof these heretics relative to the other deponents and, more importantly, toerror, sets them further apart from the rest. As in the other legal sources,believers are never believers of error, but of heretics and the error of heretics.71Heretics are once again the medium between error and believer, and, onceagain, the only blurring of this line is the overlap ofcredenswith heretic, in linewith the legal injunction to inquisitors that believers of heretics’ errors are tobe considered, in legal terms,ut heretici. They are equated in the abjuration129High is the Heart of Man: Inquisition TextsSelge,Texte, p. 76; trans. W. L.

Whatsentences we have for ‘vested’ or full heretics record a penance or punishmentthat seems remarkably similar to that imposed on the lesser grades. Huguette,and Bernarde of Rou, for example, twohereticae perfectae, are given penancesby Peter Cellan that are hardly different from, and in some cases rather lesssevere than, those received by followers, although their punishment is distin-guished from that of the lesser grades by the imposition of crosses.73Neverthe-less, in the Carcassonne register, we find a ‘vested’ heretic in among a list ofbelievers and followers, given the same sentence without apparent distinc-tion.74Similarly, the Orvieto book gives a sentence for a ‘consoled heretic’,which imposes the same, albeit harsh, punishment on her as on many otherswho are not so labelled.75More interesting, while the sentences are inconsistent in their discrimina-tion between heretic and follower, one of the few depositions that we have ofa ‘vested’ heretic betrays no difference in approach or interest in the inquisi-tors’ interrogation. The long deposition of Arnaude of Lamothe, a heretic forover thirty years in the south of France, contains no detail of error at all.Arnaude is not questioned about belief, and the questions she is asked areprecisely those that are asked of everyone else, the only difference being thatshe is the object, rather than the subject, of the normal actions: not did youadore any heretics, but did anyone adore you?76Although there is a distinctlayer of heretics that are nominally separate from the other deponents, whatthat seems to mean, principally, is someone who has undergone the ritual ofinitiation, who has ‘made herself a heretic’.77The name is also to be applied tothose who have relapsed, or refused to do their penance, in which case theycan be sentenced ‘as a heretic’. The term ‘heretic’ is understood, in other130Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century72‘Quod hereticos et credentes eorum tot posse meo persequar et tam eos quam eorumfautores’; d’Alatri,Orvieto, pp. 177, 275, 296. ‘Fugerunt heretici et credentes qui ibi erant’;Duvernoy,Quercy, p. 94.73Duvernoy,Quercy, pp. 260, 262. Huguette and Bernarde are both sent to Puy, St-Gilles,Santiago de Compostela, St-Denis, and the shrine of St Thomas in Canterbury, and are alsogiven crosses, one for life, the other for five years. This is the same penance – minus thecrosses – that is that is given to several followers, such as Raimunda, wife of Bosolens,Duvernoy,Quercy, p. 180. Some followers are sent to Constantinople for years on end. OnCellan’s sentences see Feuchter,Ketzer, Konsuln und Büßer, chapter 6. In contrast, see Tocco’scollection, which includes a sentence for a heretic, Bona, who is condemned to the stake:Tocco, pp. 38–9.74Douais,Documents: Textes, p. 28.75‘Hereticam consolatam’; d’Alatri,Orvieto, pp. 245, 256.76Doat 23, fols. 2v–49v.77‘Fecit se haereticam’; Doat 23, fol. 129v.

That differentiationbetween heretic andcredensis borne out by Vincent of Spain’s gloss to thefourth Lateran constitutions, which explainscredentesas those ‘who do not yetopenly profess any sect’.78So it is that Peter Garcias, who appears, in hisdispute with the Franciscan brothers, to hold full heretical beliefs, and even tobe living a semi-heretical, ascetic lifestyle, cut off from his wife, can still becalled acredens.79All of which is not to say, however, that inquisitors were not interested inerror; we can see that there are a few occasions on which they do use ques-tion lists that are built around known heretical errors to interrogate a depo-nent, though the deposition of one heretic in Tocco’s collection, for example,seems to be little more than a checklist of standard errors.80Although for themost part heretical errors do not have much more presence beyond that of alabel in these depositions, as something attached to heretics, and any ‘belief’on the part of the follower is either mediated by heretics or is little more thana statement of spiritual belief in salvific qualities of the sect, occasionally weare given depositions that contain nothing but error. The case of the Fran-ciscan depositions against Peter Garcias, which provide the content of hisargument and the ensuing debates in great detail, are the best example ofsuch depositions. Aside from the Garcias case, of the collections that we havelooked at here, some of most error-based interrogations can be seen in depo-sitions contained in the 25th Doat volume. Several of these are unusual inbeing given not by Cathar believers or followers of a known sect, but by indi-viduals who seem to have held, so Wakefield suggests, independently unor-thodox ideas, ‘materialistic or rationalistic explanations of naturalphenomena’, that the corn grows because of the earth and not the power ofGod.81The structure of the questions here, for example – ‘asked if he hadever said that even if the body of Christ was as big as a mountain, the clericswould have devoured it long since’ – make it clear that they have been drawnfrom the testimony of another witness or witnesses, though it is also worthnoting that the usual questions of when, how often, and who else was therestill follow each article.82The consequent depositions record a great deal131High is the Heart of Man: Inquisition Texts78‘Qui nondum profitentur sectam aliquam’; García,Lateran 4, p. 291.79Douais,Documents: Textes, pp. 90, 109, 95.80Tocco, pp. 35–6.81W.

It is these depo-sitions that form the starting point for the inquisitors’ interrogation. Fabrissaclearly has a firm grasp of at least the principal errors of the Cathar sect and,like the deponents above, is asked about several very specific statementsdrawn from other depositions, such as whether she had ever said to a preg-nant woman that she had the devil in her belly. The inquisitors do not,however, ask her to give further details of these errors, but rather to saywhether or not she did actually say or think them.84The pattern of these depositions suggests that where error does have somepresence in these depositions, however exceptional, the inquisitors’ interest init is not investigative: where any detail of error appears it is as part of an inter-rogation based onfamaand not as part of a theological examination. Even theGarcias depositions follow the same pattern of using witness statements tobuild a question list that will establish guilt, and the detailed nature of thesestatements is perhaps attributable to the equally unusual fact that the depo-nents are mendicant friars. The reported error is used as a marker and theusual auxiliary questions are added. Perhaps the non-standard errors of the‘materialists’ are afforded more space than usual, but interrogations based onunusual errors are not seeking an explanation of the errors from the deponentany more than question lists that repeat established articles of error – onlyassent or denial to a series of articles. Error is a present and integral part, but isnot what inquisitors are looking for in these interrogations.A focus on actions and on information which sees even heretical statusdefined in terms of measurable actions makes the picture of heresy that wefind in the depositions overwhelmingly a thing of ritual and of presence.Arnaude’s deposition is filled with details of where she went, what rituals sheperformed, what others did for her, and, in each case, who was there at thetime. For the heretics, as well as for the supporting cast, heresy is a fullerversion of that list of verbs that constitute the culpable actions outlined in theconsultations, and deponents are charged withcrimen hereseos,orcrimenheresis, which the Tuscan formulary glosses as including ‘whether believing inthe errors of heretics, or receiving them, or giving them any sort of help,132High is the Heart of Man: Inquisition Texts83Doat 25, fols. 20v–5v; fols. 226v–8v.84Doat 25, fols. 37v–53r.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:27:29 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"counsel or favour, or transgressing in any way whatsoever with regard to thiscrime’.85All these examples are taken from documents that were not intended forpublic reading. Sentences, on the other hand, were pronounced and carriedout publicly.86Between the documents produced by those two processes therewas a significant gap in the information included. The case of Austorga ofRosenges, mentioned above, is one of those relatively unusual occasions onwhich there are both a confession and a sentence surviving for the same depo-nent. Her sentence, which is a group sentence that includes many other depo-nents, is brief and to the point. She and the others saw, adored and believedthe errors of heretics, and, after having abjured heresy, then did all thosethings again. They all received a penance of perpetual incarceration. Behindthis short condemnation are various depositions, including one of her own –the Rosenges family were, according to Douais, notorious for their involve-ment in the affairs of heretics, and Austorga seems to have been caught out atleast three times – all of which provide a detailed and complex picture ofinvolvement. None of that detail or complexity is transmitted to the publicsentence.87The collections of sentences are really the main public face of theinquisition process to which we have access.Both Italian registers contain a single sentence that lists the specific errorsof the deponent.88The sentence collection of Bernard of Caux and John ofSt-Pierre also contains one sentence that describes, though in no greatdoctrinal or theoretical detail, the errors in question. It is neither the earliestnor in any other way significantly different.89The inclusion of such details inone or two sentences seems odd, especially when they are hardly prominentin the depositions themselves, but they can perhaps be explained as publicsafety announcements. Whether or not an action was undertaken ‘knowingly’is, as we have seen, a recurrent concern in the legal texts that we have lookedat, and it appears to have been equally important for those interrogating133High is the Heart of Man: Inquisition Texts85‘Sive credendo hereticorum erroribus, sive ipsos receptando, sive quodlibet auxilium,consilium et favorem prestando, sive quoviscumque modo circa crimen huiusmodidelinquendo’; d’Alatri,Orvieto, p. 172.86‘Lecta lata et publicata fuit dicta sententia ... in pleno populo marum et mulierum dictecivitatis ad hec convocato’; d’Alatri,Orvieto, p. 213.87Sentence in Douais,Documents: Textes, no.

Theheretics promptly denied this, and ascribed it instead to vicious rumoursstarted by the Catholics. Such a denial perhaps suggests the restriction ofsecret knowledge, but it also points to an uninitiated member being able toput his finger on what it was that made the heretics doctrinally wrong ordifferent. One man can even be seen in the Quercy register to want to comparethe two sects; having visited the Waldensians, he then ‘went to the heretics,wishing to test which were better, Waldensians or heretics’.92Though it isequally probable that the origin of either man’s knowledge would be someonelike Fabrissa, a source of local and neighbourly knowledge, perhaps theseeming use of inquisition vocabulary by deponents is not only a result ofrewriting by the agents of the Catholic church, but also of exposure to inquisi-tion method and language in its public aspects, and in court. There are evenplaces in which a counter-tradition can be discerned: an awareness of how toavoid difficult answers, a tradition that we know from other sources to haveexisted and which can perhaps be seen behind the illustrations of hereticalsophistry under interrogation that are presented by Stephen of Bourbon andthe Pseudo-David of Augsburg.It is clear, then, that the list of actions that define heresy in the councils andin the consultations also define the picture of heresy that the inquisition mate-rial presents; the same ideas determine what questions are asked and whatinformation recorded. Overall there is little concern with heresy as doctrinalerror. Further, the scheme of actions in the registers also includes heretics, whoare also now indicated by actions that function as markers of guilt. Littledistinction is made in these documents between the treatment of heretics andlesser categories, or indeed between members of different heretical groups,with the exception of the élite: depositions usually begin with the question didyou see hereticsorWaldensians, and certainly people appear to have been ableto distinguish. The same vocabulary, though, the same list of actions, isapplied to almost everyone else, and the same actions seem to result in thesame label for followers of both groups. Heresy here is a crime, or at least is inthe process of becoming one. We can see in the consultations especially thatactions are considered at least to some extent as shorthand for an interiorcondition, although in the registers the weight given to details of actions andphysical presence by the inquisitors’ questions can perhaps also be seen to rest134Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century90Duvernoy,Quercy, e.g. p. 54; Douais,Documents: Textes, p. 4; d’Alatri,Orvieto, p. 222.91Tocco, p. 53.92‘Ivit ad hereticos, volens temptare qui essent meliores, Valdenses vel heretici’; Duvernoy,Quercy, p. 146.Melioresis Duvernoy’s correction ofmilieres.

Unlike the conciliarand consultation material, the handbooks represent a private body of knowl-edge passed from inquisitor to inquisitor, and written by them to be ancillaryto the process of inquisition. We owe our appreciation of their importance tothe work of Dondaine, who highlighted the central role of the previouslyunder-used inquisitors’ manual in the development of the inquisition processand in our understanding of it.93Part of a broader trend in the production ofmanual literature which had emerged and gathered speed with the success ofthe mendicant orders, inquisitors’ manuals were procedural, ‘how-to’ booksthat grew alongside the new process being formed in the constitutions ofchurch councils and the tribunals taking place across southern France andnorthern Italy. Dondaine saw the manual as developing in stages out of collec-tions of texts and identified several distinct phases in the evolution of the form,though the range and variety of the material means that the distinctionsbetween his different stages are not always clear. Beginning with the earliestmanuels sans formulaire, manuals then acquire supplementary material tobecomemanuels avec formulaire, all of which is ultimately integrated intocoherenttraités raisonnés. In our period the manual is still at an early stage ofdevelopment according to Dondaine’s scheme. Beside the manuals there areother texts, handbooks aimed at informing the inquisitor about other aspectsof inquisition beside process.The principal concern of all these texts is the communication of information:information about heretics on the one hand, and about the repression of heresy– that is, inquisition – on the other. There are a number of different elementscommon to these texts as a group, providing different types of ancillary infor-mation: as well as procedural material there are formularies, models of docu-ments to be produced; technical information, descriptions of the office ofinquisition and how to best conduct the tribunal, as well as explanations ofinquisitorial powers – this becomes more common as legislation increased involume and the process gathered momentum and expertise; and substantiveinformation, descriptions of heretics, their errors and their customs. Thedifferent types of information were combined in a variety of ways in differenthandbooks and this is in part what makes them such a diverse group of texts.135High is the Heart of Man: Inquisition Texts93Dondaine, ‘Manuel’, pp. 85–6.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:27:29 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Some are concerned with only one element: theOrdo processus Narbonensisdeals only with information about the process of inquisition; Raniero Sacconidoes not discuss it at all, but instead treats the errors and customs of differentheretical groups.

Given that theboundaries between the different types are so fluid, the term ‘handbook’ willbe used here in a general sense to refer to all the texts.Ordo processus Narbonensis94Written in 1248/49, by the inquisitors Bernard of Caux and John of St-Pierre,this is one of the earliest examples of the inquisitors’ manual.95It is extant inonly one manuscript, in Madrid, but is referred to by several later authors.96Summa de Catharis et Pauperibus de Lugduno97TheSumma de Catharis et Pauperibus de Lugduno, which the explicit dates to1250, details the beliefs of the Cathars, their various churches and the writingsof John of Lugio; information on thePauperes de Lugdunois relegated to a shortsection at the end of the work.98Its author, Raniero Sacconi, born in Piacenzanear the beginning of the thirteenth century, reverted to Catholicism afterseventeen years as a Cathar. In 1245, under the influence of Peter of Verona, hebecame a Dominican friar and later, between 1254 and 1259, inquisitor for hisnative Lombardy. He describes himself as a former ‘heresiarch’ and, though itis unclear whether by this he means that he was one of the higher members ofhis sect, the fact that he seems privy to the higher levels of knowledge that hedescribes as restricted, and that he also uses the term heresiarch of John ofLugio, elder son and bishop of the Albanenses, might suggest that this was thecase.99According to Šanjek, theSumma de Catharis et Pauperibus de Lugdunoisstill extant in over fifty manuscripts.100TheSummasurvives in two forms: in its136Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century94Selge,Texte, pp. 70–77; trans.

Instead, the text ranges away from thedescription of beliefs to provide also descriptions of way of life and behaviour,as well as accounts of the history and development of the different groups ofthe sort that we start to see appearing in later inquisitors’ manuals. Ranieroalso shows concern to make clear the different geographical distinctions of theheretical churches and the corresponding doctrinal peculiarities.MS Vat. Lat. 3978101One of Dondaine’smanuels avec formulaire, contained, along with various otheranti-heretical materials, in Vatican Latin manuscript 3978, a manuscript of thesecond half of the fourteenth century which looks like a collection for inquisi-tors; beside the manual it contains official texts, formularies and treatises,including extracts from Moneta, Raniero, the Pseudo-David of Augsburg andtheDisputatio– in fact, a large proportion of the texts that we have looked at. Itis designed as a work of reference: each section is clearly numbered and acorresponding list of contents is provided at the beginning of the text;marginal notes and rubrics allow easy navigation between the differentsections: all the reference tools introduced in the late twelfth and thirteenthcenturies to render a text searchable.102The manual itself is a compilation oftexts and documents, French in origin, though it also exists in a later Italianversion.103Dondaine dates the manual to shortly after 1265, given the propen-sity of collections generally to include the most recent material and the date ofthe newest document in the collection, the reissue of Frederick II’santi-heretical legislation by Clement IV in 1265. Dossat follows Dondaine,dating the manual to 1266 and placing it firmly in the context of the southernFrench inquisitions, but Dondaine also raises the possibility that the 1265document may have been added later – it is missing from another version ofthe manual – and this suggestion is seconded by Riccardo Parmeggiani.Following the same logic as Dondaine, he therefore dates the manual to thenext latest item that it contains, the consultation of Gui Foulques, ofc.1255.104137High is the Heart of Man: Inquisition Texts101BAV, MS Vat.

The Anony-mous of Passau has a complex manuscript tradition and is extant in at leasttwo recensions, if not more – Patschovsky shows that the earlier version infact exists in many different forms. Moreover, Nickson argues that one laterversion, also known as the Pseudo-Reinerius, is in fact a shortened version ofthe anti-heretical sections of the original and itself exists in two versions,having been further abbreviated in a second redaction.108The laterrecensions cannot really be dated more securely than 1270–1300, but ulti-mately reproduce the earlier text. The text has, unsurprisingly, never beenedited in its entirety; a selection was published by Gretser originally in theseventeenth century and reprinted several times since, and some parts havealso been edited by Patschovsky and by Nickson. In the light of the complexand fragmentary nature of what has been edited, and the consequent diffi-culty of identifying which version is represented by each edition, in thefollowing the work is cited without distinguishing between the differentrecensions.138Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Centurydecretal material was a later Italian development from the two-part French style ofmanual, which included consultations and formularies only; R.

It isextant in at least two recensions, identified by Dondaine, of which the order ofprecedence is uncertain, though Dondaine believes the Short recension to bethe earlier text. It is generally thought that the short text is of French origin,and the longer German, but there are also arguments for a German origin forboth. The Short recension is reproduced entirely in the Long, with the excep-tion of its initial and the final three chapters, which seem to have been added,and the Long recension includes additional chapters and reorganizes theshorter text to some degree. According to Dondaine it is only the shorter of thetwo that appears in the collections designed for inquisitors.110A precise datingof this text is very difficult, but there are signs that point some of the way. Twodefinite facts present themselves: first is a reference to the conflict betweenemperor and pope in which Frederick (II) is described as ‘late’; Frederick diedin 1250. Secondly, there is a reference to ‘St. Peter OFP’, who was killed in 1252and canonized in 1253. This, then, gives a solidterminus post quemof 1253.What may also possibly be helpful is that the added chapter at the beginningof the Short recension is a highly condensed version of the account ofWaldensian origins given by Stephen of Bourbon in theDe septem donis de Spir-itus Sancti. The preface is missing from the Dublin manuscript of thisrecension, however, and though Esposito, following Quetif and Echard,suggests that the following twenty-four sections of theDe inquisitioneare inpart adapted from Stephen’s work the only apparent similarities lie in twoparallel pieces of the sample interrogation. Given the difficulty of dating thecomposition of Stephen’s unfinished work, sometime between 1250 and 1261,any dependence on theDe septem donisdoes not narrow the date range for theDe inquisitionevery helpfully.111139High is the Heart of Man: Inquisition Texts109Short recension: Pseudo-David,De inquisitione.

The similarity appears limited.Stephen’s account of Waldensian errors is very limited and brief, and is followed by anaccount of his experience, and then of Cathar errors. The sample interrogation containstwo pieces that are similar; one question: ‘Credis Christum de Virgine natum, passum,resurrexisse et ascendisse in coelum? Respondit alacriter, Credo’ is in Stephen given as:‘cum queritur: “Credis Christum natum, passum, etc.?” Respondent: “Bene credo” vel“firmiter credo”, id est firmam vel bonam habeo credenciam’, here referring to pluralspeakers, and not specifically Waldensians but heretics generally.

It reprises the structure of theOrdo processus narbonensis, though in a fuller and more detailed form. The simi-larity between the two texts led Dondaine to suggest a direct borrowing of theFrench text by the author of theExplicatio, a suggestion reinforced by the factthat the Ordo directly follows theExplicatioin what was then thought to be theonly manuscript. The dependence has been confirmed by Parmeggiani, whoalso identifies a second manuscript.Tractatus de hereticis113Although the surviving copy of this work is anonymous, we know, throughthe work of Dondaine, that it was written by the Lombard inquisitor Anselmof Alessandria. It was begun by Anselm around 1267 and he continued to addto it throughout his career until 1279; it survives in only one manuscript, in theNational museum of Hungary in Budapest. The manuscript also contains acopy of theSumma de Catharis et Pauperibus de Lugdunoof Anselm’s fellowinquisitor, Raniero Sacconi, inserted incongruously into Anselm’s text in a waythat leads Dondaine to believe that it is the result of scribal accident. Dondainesees Anselm’s handbook as complementary to Sacconi’s text, providing as itdoes information on the Concorezzensan schism much as Raniero does for theAlbanensan church.114The opening words of theExplicatio super officio inquisitionisestablish threeconstituent parts to the office of inquisition: ‘the laying out of statutes, theinquisition of heretics and believers, and the defining or imposition of punish-ments’.115Those elements, the citation, examination and sentencing of heretics,together comprise the essential purpose of inquisition, and are what theinquisitors’ handbooks address between them, though the manner in which140Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Centuryverbis meis”’, Stephen’s claims ‘“Ego sum homo simplex, talis et talis, et nescio istasquestiones”’.

TheExplicatioand theOrdo processusboth do so explicitly byoutlining procedure, describing the role of the inquisitor and providing whatalmost amounts to a script for him to follow. The earliest of these texts, theOrdo processus narbonensis, is a ‘manual’ proper, in the sense that it providesinstructions for new inquisitors on how to conduct an inquisition from begin-ning to end by means of a set of examples and instructions of how to proceed,technically, that together create a schematic view of the tribunal. The interrog-atory that it includes is a list of the verbs that appear in the consultationmaterial which build a profile of guilt: did you see heretics; when, and where;how many and who with; did you hear their preaching, or receive them; leadthem; eat or drink with them; give them anything; perform administrativetasks for them; keep anything for them; accept the peace from them; adorethem, or bow your head, bend your knee, say ‘bless’; were you present at theirrituals; did you confess to or accept penance from Waldensians, or have anyother association with them; make any agreement to hide the truth, or know ofanyone who did; and, finally, do you believe in them or their errors?The laterExplicatiouses theOrdo processus’ material and in particular itsstructure to talk about the process of inquisition in a similarly schematic,though much fuller, way, developing in particular the discussion of thepowers and legal status of the inquisitor. It also includes a version of the samequestion list forcredentesas well as a different list designed specifically forheretici consolati, which is directed much more to doctrinal questions. Thediscussions of office and process that make up these two texts also appear inthe others to some extent, though it is not their majority part, and theSumma deCatharis et Pauperibus de Lugduno, indeed, has no such material at all. Thecompiler of the Anonymous of Passau text includes some pieces that tell hisreaders how to recognize sects from outward signs, as well as the way toexamine a heretic and how to punish them.116There are also brief sections thatdiscuss inquisitorial procedure. Anselm’s text also contains some items onprocedure that are similar to those of theOrdo– a brief interrogatory and twoformulae – and has a section, later borrowed by Bernard Gui, on the properexercise of the office of inquisition. Of these other texts, the Pseudo-David’stext is the only one that presents an even balance between procedural informa-tion and the descriptions of heretics that make up most of Raniero, Anselmand the Anonymous.MS Vat. Lat. 3978 is a different sort of text both from the procedural discus-sions of theOrdoand theExplicatioand from the descriptive, substantivematerial of the more treatise-like handbooks. Instead, rather like Stephen ofBourbon’s text, it provides something more like raw material for inquisition.The texts that this manual contains fall into two parts: consultations andformulary. The consultations include all those that we looked at in the first141High is the Heart of Man: Inquisition Texts116Anonymous of Passau, pp. 272–4. See also Nickson, ‘The “Pseudo-Reinerius” Treatise’, pp.285–6.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:27:29 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"part of this chapter, by Gui Foulques, Peter Collemieu, John Bernin and thetwo sets of lawyers. They are joined by the canons of the councils of Narbonneand Béziers, from 1243 and 1246. The formulary itself is made up of sampledocuments drawn from real inquisition registers. Many of these documentswere also used in the Tuscan formulary edited by d’Alatri and in the laterItalian collection know as theLibellus.117The reproduction of material fromdifferent countries obviously has important implications for the history of theoffice, but several points can also be made here about the texts themselves. Thefact that records from different inquisitions, and indeed different regions,could be copied and adapted as formulae by other inquisitors means that,though they were the product of the inquisition of a particular individual in aparticular place, they could as easily be applied to any other deponent whofitted the same criteria, and that the ideas of heresy they contained were notisolated but general and transferable. It also reinforces the impression given byreading the legal material that the lists of actions, and the questions that derivefrom them, were intended to fit deponents into a predetermined structure ofguilt, and that the idea of heresy they were based on was of a series of actionsthat stood at a remove from the interior state that they represented. All ofwhich is a rather long-winded way of saying that these ideas were self-perpetuating and the inquisition texts reflexive.The interaction is not only between inquisition documents. As the sentencesand depositions reflect the ideas of the consultations, here is another level ofreflexivity, in the inquisitors’ manual, which contains both. MS Vat. Lat. 3978is an example of what Petrucci calls a coherent collection of texts: it waswritten, copied and used as a connected and coherent whole, its ‘value andfunction result from its completeness and reciprocity’.118This means that theconsultations and the depositions are part of the same coherent idea; that thedepositions feed off each other, and off the consultations, and the collection asa whole reflects a legal idea of heresy.It is to legal texts, too, that the tone of the more straightforward manuals,theOrdo processusand theExplicatio, bear the closest resemblance, not least intheir concentration on actions, but also in their focus on the follower. It isnoticeable that the question lists position the deponent consistently as afollower of heretics, all the questions try to establish the relationship of thedeponent to heretics and the texts as a whole appear to focus less on theheretics proper, as the other texts do, and more on the lesser categories ofinvolvement. Where belief in error is mentioned, in the condemnation or at theend of the question list, it is, as with our legal consultations, one of list of activemarkers of guilt, and again attached to a somewhat disembodied heretic: the142Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century117Parmeggiani, ‘Un secolo di manualistica inquisitoriale’, p. 243.118A.

The Pseudo-David, for example, focuses muchmore clearly on the practical business of inquisition and the difficulties thatcome with it. Most of the advice of theDe inquisitionepertains to the inquisi-tion of heretics specifically. Little attention is shown to the lesser grades, otherthan how to pick them out of a crowd, and they only appear to be catered forin the Pseudo-David’s awareness that acredens hereticorumis to be judged as aheretic in law.120The Anonymous of Passau and Anselm similarly concentrateon heretics as the subject of interrogation, though the sample interrogationsare less concerned with verbal wrangling than the Pseudo-David and, inAnselm’s case, they are a little more concerned with error.MS Vat. Lat. 3978 perhaps tells us more about the inquisitors’ ideas of inqui-sition than of heresy. As Dondaine points out, the texts that make up theformulary are neatly and helpfully arranged in order of the inquisitionprocess, from the general sermon to the exhumation of dead heretics. Theseare the things that an inquisitor needed to know: the legal process and thelegal definitions of both his office and the subject of his enquiry. It has alreadybeen pointed out that much of the information in the consultations that is notto do with the office is to do with the finer grades of guilt, the complicatedlegal definitions that the inquisitors found difficult. They clearly wanted alltheir legal information in one place, a ‘library without a library’.121Unlike themore treatise-like handbooks, there is little information on heresy and lots oninquisition. The first two groups of inquisition texts, the consultations and thedepositions, are represented by the 3978 manual, but the handbooks and theirinformation are neither included nor apparently relevant. Again the reflexivenature of the depositions and consultations is significant here. If the legal ideasof the consultations shape and are shaped by the questions that govern thedepositions, and therefore by the information that these questions elicit, thenthe material that makes up the handbooks is not drawn from this source, anddoes not reflect that legal idea of heresy.122143High is the Heart of Man: Inquisition Texts119‘Quia hereticorum erroribus credidit’; Selge,Texte, pp. 71–2, 75.120Pseudo-David,De inquisitione, cols. 1787–8.121Dondaine, ‘Manuel’, pp. 106–8; Petrucci,Writers and Readers in Medieval Italy, p. 8.122The authors of the handbooks seem in part to have used other texts as source material,whether that was other Catholic texts or books written by the heretics themselves.

It is noticeable that, in the procedural material, nearly all of theforms given are for those parts of the tribunal that require a publicly givenannouncement. Perhaps it is to supplement and support those parts of inquisi-tion that are hard to describe in writing, as theOrdo processushas it, in the briefbut pregnant phrase: ‘we do various other things, indeed, in the process and inother matters which cannot easily be reduced to writing’.123Or perhaps it ismore to do with information, for the inquisitors to know, as the Pseudo-Davidsuggests, how to identify and treat heretics and their followers – ‘evil cannotbe avoided unless it is known’.124What do inquisitors want to tell each other about heresy to supply and rein-force those parts of inquisition that procedure does not cover? Raniero openshis short text with a simple comparison: ‘although at one time sects of hereticswere numerous, by the grace of Jesus Christ they have been almost completelydestroyed; yet two major ones are now found’.125With these few lines Ranieroplaces his subject in an historical frame; it is very brief, but he later adds moredetail, describing recent events in Cathar history as a background to theschism in the Albanensan church. The first impulse of these texts is to provide,however briefly, a historical background for the sect in question. Like Raniero,the Anonymous of Passau draws a comparison between the relative numbersof heresies old and new. The Passau text in fact opens with three theoreticalchapters on the difference between the Catholic church and heretical sects andon the causes of heresy, but the fourth chapter, the first to begin describing theheretics themselves, echoes Raniero’s opening lines. ‘On the sects of ancientheretics’ deals with older heresies very briefly, and only to say that the many –he gives the number as seventy – have now been reduced to four, of which144Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth CenturyAnselm of Alessandria,Tractatus, pp. 318–19.

An explanation of ritual and ofthe doctrine behind it is shown to be necessary by some practical advice from Anselm:‘bene facerent consolamentum etiam si paries vel murus vel fluvius esset in medio; et ideodiligenter cavendum est quando habemus aliquos suspectos ne cathari infirmantibusappropinquent, vel etiam domibus in quibus detinentur’; Anselm of Alessandria,Tractatus, pp. 313–14.125‘Cum secte hereticorum olim fuerint multe, que omnino fere destructe sunt per gratiamIhesu Christi, tamen due principales modo inueniuntur’; Raniero Sacconi,Summa, p. 42;trans.

Anselm does this morethoroughly than the others and prefaces his account of the Cathar churches ofItaly by tracing their historical and geographical spread from the ancientManicheans and from Bulgaria via the north of France to the south and Italy –as Barber points out, this section makes Anselm one of the few western writersof this period to attempt to investigate the history of the Cathars himself.127The Pseudo-David similarly begins with an account of Waldensian origins,though the first paragraph, which traces the sect to Valdes, was a later addi-tion by a different author; the original account, now the second section, insteaddescribes the origins of the sect in Lyons and the actions of ‘certain simplelaymen’. The Pseudo-David also has echoes of the contrast between old andnew that Raniero and the Anonymous of Passau draw. These heretics, whomhe later calls the heretics of modern times, ‘mix with the errors of ancient here-tics those of their own invention’.128So, all the texts open with a historical perspective in some form. There aretwo aspects to this, the most straightforward of which is the provision of someaccount of the origins of the sect in question at or near the beginning of thetext. Alongside this is the comparison between heresies of the ancient worldand those of modern times and their relative numbers. The heresies of the oldworld are apparently taken from an Isidorean model of heresy, that modelwhich is contained in theDecretumand which names a large number of sects,an abbreviated version of which is tacked onto the end of Anselm’s treatise.The influence of this idea can be seen in the Anonymous of Passau’s laterdescription of other sects, in which he uses Isidore’s practice of deriving theirnames from their author or their cause.129Two elements of the sects’ make-up form the principal concern of all fourtexts and the focus of the majority of their material: the errors of the heretics,and their behaviour and customs. For Raniero, this is the whole of his subject.145High is the Heart of Man: Inquisition Texts126‘De sectis antiquorum hereticorum’; ‘non est pernicior Ecclesie quam Leonistarum’; Anon-ymous of Passau, p. 264; Pseudo-David,De inquisitione, cols. 1777–8.

He then breaks the structuredown into individual churches – and not just roughly divided by types ofdualism, but sixteen distinct groups, each with separate names and separate,though overlapping, doctrines. Raniero’s text presents us with a picture ofCatharism as a highly structured and hierarchical movement, with an organi-zation that is common to all the groups, and though Raniero points out wherecertain groups, usually the Albanenses, differ from the rest, this also serves tohighlight that otherwise these structures are shared.130Raniero’s treatment ofthe Waldensian sect is very brief, but, like his account of the Cathars, is never-theless based on the principal divisions in the sect, with one chapter devotedto the Poor of Lyons and one to the Lombard branch.131In a way very similar to thesummaof his colleague, the doctrinal differencesbetween the Cathar groups, including the schism in the church of Concorezzo,provide the framework for Anselm’s description of Cathar errors, whichcomprises much of his first section. They are also the basis for his treatment ofthe Waldensians, which is more extensive than Raniero’s. Like Raniero,Anselm imparts his information without judgement or comment and makesno attempt to engage with the error, but merely to describe it, and his reservedapproach continues in his treatment of heretical custom, which preserves oneof the most detailed descriptions that we have of the Cathar ritual ofconsolamentum. There is an emphasis on ritual and formalized behaviour inthis text, and, alongside theconsolamentum, Anselm describes in similar detailthe disposition of penance, Cathar behaviour at table and even the secret ques-tion that they use to determine whether they are among friends: ‘“is this acrooked stick?”’132The Anonymous of Passau is similar again. It also devotes a lot of space toerror, not least because of its inclusion of Raniero’s text, though this is also theonly material that it has on heretical custom or hierarchy. The chapter onmodern sects, which is really only about the Waldensians, includes a long146Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century130Raniero Sacconi,Summa, pp. 43–9.131Three segments on the Waldensians were sometimes copied into manuscripts directlyafter Raniero’s text, presumably to remedy the deficiency of his text on this subject. Theycontinue in the same vein, providing information on the errors, with some attention todifferences, and details of Waldensian customs and sacraments. See Dondaine, ‘Manuel’,p. 150, no. 11.

The ‘crooked stick’in question presumably refers to a person present. The Anonymous of Passau alsodescribes the use of the ‘crooked stick’ code, used to determine if they are among friends,here given as ‘“Cavete, ne inter nos sit lignum curvum”’.

The subsequent chapter, on the names of sects,again describes different groups in terms of their error, but again there is nopolemic or invective, merely report.TheDe inquisitionelaunches into a description of errors in the first chapterand directly after the historical account, as the Passau text does, and then goeson to spend most of the descriptive part of the text giving details of the charac-teristics and character flaws of the heretics. The middle parts of thePseudo-David are in fact given over to a description of behaviour that is morepolemically directed than the other handbooks, describing their methods oflearning and preaching and their associations with rich women, apparently inorder to condemn them; the Pseudo-David does make some attempt ateven-handedness in clearing the Waldensians of any sexual misconduct, butonly to then lay the charge at the feet of the Cathars.133There is none of thedescription of ritual and formalized behaviour given in the other three texts. Infact, it is really only the Italian texts that want to talk about lifestyle – theAnonymous of Passau contains information on this aspect only by virtue ofcontaining also Raniero.In describing the structural composition of these texts, the contrast in stylebetween the texts of the Pseudo-David and the Anonymous of Passau on theone hand and the detached work of the two Italian inquisitors on the othermay already have become apparent. Raniero and Anselm are mostlyconcerned to describe and inform, and, while the other two are also designedto provide information, that information is not imparted without comment,and the difference in tone affects the pictures of heresy that the two pairsproject. Common themes run through all four portrayals of heresy, but theyare differently realized, in part through the rhetorical tone employed by thenon-Italian texts, in particular the Pseudo-David.The theme of division in the representation of heresy in the handbooks hasalready been highlighted. It is a characteristic that is fundamental to all of thetexts except the Pseudo-David, who seems not to see much distinction at allbetween heretical groups and even cites the death of Peter Martyr of Verona asevidence against the Waldensians.134Like the polemics, also all Italian produc-tions, the division of heresy provides the structure of Anselm and Raniero’stexts. For the Anonymous of Passau, however, the differentiation of theheretics’ sect is one of the markers of their error: despite the claim shortly after-wards that modern heretics have been reduced to only four groups, the tenthsign of the church’s superiority ‘is the integrity of faith. For it is not divided,but one. But there are more than seventy sects of heretics’ – the same numberthat he later gives for the ancient sects.135And this is the general pattern147High is the Heart of Man: Inquisition Texts133Pseudo-David,De inquisitione, cols. 1782–5.134Pseudo-David,De inquisitione, col. 1785.135‘Est integritas fidei.

It underlies the Pseudo-David’s juxtaposition of the modernheretic, who does not declare his heresy openly, and his ancient counterpart.136The theme is partly developed through the repeated use of terms related todisguise and deception: the image of a cloak is used often.137It is stated severaltimes that the Waldensians claim to be the true successors of the apostles andearly saints and that they presume to take on the role of the church throughpride, an idea that is taken up and expanded on in the long recension, where,‘like a monkey’ the heretics think themselves to be the successors of theapostles.138The holiness of the heretic is affected, however; it is a ‘cloak ofsanctity’. Twice heretics are compared to wolves in sheep’s clothing, thoughmore obliquely on the second occasion, and this is reinforced with oppositions:they ‘praise continence’, but yield to their desires ‘with burning lust’.139Indeed, the sample interrogation is given over in its entirety to the demonstra-tion of the deceptive nature of heretics. It would seem that the main objectionthat the author has to this secrecy is that it results in the deception of thesimple, although he also has something to say about lack of church presenceand the effect of ignorance.140Ultimately, though, it is the fact that the hereticsof modern times hide their errors so effectively that makes them so difficult tofind and to defeat, and which means that, for this author at least, the secrecy ofheretics is the justification for inquisition. It is precisely that secret nature thatjustifies, even necessitates, the existence of the inquisitor, whose role it is to seethrough the affected piety.141148Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century136The juxtaposition occurs as part of the chapter on examining heretics in the Shortrecension, Pseudo-David,De inquisitione, col. 1788, but is elevated to the introduction ofthe Long recension, and expanded upon: Preger, Pseudo-David, p. 204.137Pseudo-David,De inquisitione, cols. 1779, 1782, 1783, 1788, 1790.138‘Sicut enim symea’; Preger, Pseudo-David, p. 211.

In the latter, although glimpses of aformer openness can be seen in Anselm’s account of their historical existence,his portrayal of heretics shows a similarly hidden group, but this hiddennessappears less as a function of their deceptive nature and more as a practicalconsequence of their persecution by the church. Like the Anonymous ofPassau, heretics, in this case Cathars, attend Catholic feasts only to avoidscandal and, as noted, have a coded way of inquiring whether they are amongfriends which points to a covert existence. They also have ways to disguise thetruth of their words, ‘when they wish to conceal their error’, though Anselmgives this none of the polemical value that theDe inquisitioneascribes to suchcharacteristics. The heretics’ vision of themselves in this world, as seenthrough Anselm’s account of their ritual, is, ironically, as sheep among wolves;‘“from now on you will be among us, and deep down [you will be] in thisworld like a sheep among wolves”’.145Raniero also has something to say about the practicality of the Cathars’maintenance of an outward pretence, here not so much of holiness, but ofCatholic ritual, once again ‘to avoid scandal among their neighbours’. Interest-ingly, what Raniero adds to this picture is deception and concealment of errorwithin the sect itself. The errors of John of Lugio, which are recalled here indetail, are kept secret, according to Raniero: ‘this John and his associates donot dare to reveal to their believers the errors described, lest their ownbelievers desert them on account of these novel errors’. More generally, awider distinction is drawn by this former Cathar across the sect between theinitiated and the lower levels of adherents, who are characterized in fact as‘simple’. ‘All the Albanenses ... held the beliefs described above’, Raniero tells149High is the Heart of Man: Inquisition Texts142‘Magnam habet speciem pietatis’; Anonymous of Passau, p. 264.143‘Ficte vadunt, offerunt, confitentur, communicant, sed totum ficte’; Anonymous of Passau,p. 266, repeated later, p. 272.144Anonymous of Passau, pp. 272–4.145Anselm of Alessandria,Tractatus, pp. 313, 316–17. ‘Quando vult cooperire errorem suum’;‘a modo eris inter nos et penitus in hoc mundo sicut ovis in medio luporum’; Anselm ofAlessandria,Tractatus, pp. 312, 314; trans.

In the course ofRaniero’s account of his errors John of Lugio emerges as an educated andliterate man. He makes use not only of Scriptural proofs but also of argumentsthat are redolent of natural philosophy, and he even shows some familiaritywith Roman Law.147Raniero’s source for his discussion is the book written byJohn of Lugio himself, ‘a large volume of ten quires, a copy of which I have. Ihave read it through and from it have extracted the errors cited above’.148Anselm too is in possession of a heretical book, which he calls the ‘Secret’ ofthe Concorezzenses, the text that we know as the Secret Supper, orInterrogatioIohannis, though he seems unimpressed by the heretics’ Latinity, quoting therubric from the text ‘“this is theSecretof the heretics of Concorezzo ... full oferrors”’ and adding drily ‘and also of bad Latin’.149Nonetheless, the descrip-tion by both Raniero and Anselm of a Catharism that produces texts anddistinguishes between its different groups on a doctrinal basis projects theview of a reasonably literate group of people, at least in the higher levels of thehierarchy.150That straightforward and detailed picture of an educated group of hereticsstands in direct contrast to the picture that we find in the Pseudo-David and the150Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century146‘Propter scandalum uicinorum suorum vitandum’; ‘dictus Iohannes et eius complices nonaudent revelare dictos errores credentibus suis, ne ipsi credentes discedant ab eis propterhos novos errores’; ‘Predicta opiniones tenebant omnes Albanenses’; ‘exceptissimplicioribus quibus singula non revelabantur’; ‘quod ipse in ypocrisi mendaciumloquitur, quod est proprium Catharorum ... nisi forte fuerit homo simplex vel noviciusinter eos, talibus enim multis illorum secreta minime reuelantur’; Raniero Sacconi,Summa,pp. 47, 57, 52, 59; trans.

The old topos of the heretic as illiterate and stupid runsthrough these two texts, especially in theDe inquisitione. Heretics are referred toor described in similar terms to the uneducated masses, as ‘laymen’, orsimplices, and their error as ‘unread’ and ‘foolish’. Such descriptions do not fitwith the picture that emerges from the descriptions both give of heretics thatare often in some way either literate or educated: their masters are still referredto in the same terms as those of the orthodox church,doctores,magistri; there issome suggestion that they use rational arguments, and are accused of interpo-lating Augustinian texts with their own rites and heresies; they own or usebooks, and there is reference to debate, and to some conflict via text; and, even ifthey are not literate, they are also said to know parts of the Scripture by heart,though in a vernacular form.151Though described as illiterate, the heretics thatthe Pseudo-David attacks likewise seem educated and well equipped. What isinteresting in this text, though, is that in the Pseudo-David we also see the here-tics constructing themselves in the same terms. In the dialogue between hereticand examiner the heretic says ‘if you wish to interpret all I say other than in asound and simple way, then I do not know how I ought to respond. I am asimple man, and illiterate, do not trap me in my words.’152Here the simplicitybecomes another part of the deceptive and artificial exterior of the heretic andreinforces the idea that the heretic disguises himself as the wolf among thesheep. To this end, the lengthy dialogue that is reproduced as an example ofpitfalls in interrogation is more an elaborate game of verbal logic than anattempt to disprove theological errors, and there is little discussion of points ofbelief, except where they serve to illustrate avoidance.A similar, though less pronounced, tension lies between the use of a toposof illiterate heretics and the underlying picture of heresy in the Anonymous ofPassau. Of the seven causes of heresy that this text lists, the first three areconnected with learning; the last four are causes located within the CatholicChurch. The first seems to indicate that heretics are learned people: heresyresults from seeking after the glory of the church Fathers. The second two,however, portray the heretics as foolish, teaching and learning without properstudy, and, more pointedly, using vernacular texts and expounding the Scrip-ture wrongly because ‘they are illiterate laymen’. At the same time, the authorsays later on that he has counted up the schools of the heretics from variousinquisitions that he has attended, of which schools he then provides a list.153As in theDe inquisitione, the heretic once again seems to purposely constructhis own simplicity: ‘he pretends he is simple ... or he pretends he is foolish’.154151High is the Heart of Man: Inquisition Texts151Pseudo-David,De inquisitione, cols. 1787, 1789,1780,1784, 1788, 1780, 1781.152‘Si omnia quae dico vultis aliter interpretari quam sane & simpliciter, tunc nescio quiddebeam respondere.

In the case ofthe topos of the illiterate heretic at least, this was a stereotype that had a longerlife in the German-speaking regions of Europe than in France and Italy, andwhich tended to be used against the Waldensians where it did survive in thesouth.155The rather matter-of-fact impression of heretical learning that theItalian texts present, on the other hand, which they share with the polemicalmaterial, reflects the greater degree of lay literacy in Italy at this time, as wellas the condition of heretical literacy specifically.156Something that they allshare, though, and which is worth noting briefly, is the way that the informa-tion about the sect is presented as the attributes and characteristics of heretics.Where the polemical texts, which also to some degree present their reader withinformation on the doctrinal nature of the heresy, tend to anchor this in arather abstract, rhetorical ‘heretic’ figure, these handbooks, particularly theItalian ones, ground all their description firmly in much more concrete figures.Though he provides details about the lives and errors of the modern heretic,the Pseudo-David’s vision of a successful interrogation still rests on the infor-mation generated by the standard procedural, action-based questions: thedeponent revealing the extent of their involvement in heresy and, more partic-ularly, the involvement of others.157If heresy is a crime of actions and theprocess of inquisition is aimed at the collection of information about thoseactions and the networks they comprise, then the handbooks generate andperpetuate that process and the documents that sustained it. To do so requiresnot only models and procedural material but also the understanding of theinquisitors’ legal position and the categories of guilt provided by the consulta-tions. But the inquisitors also want to know about error beyond the legalcategories and grades, and they spend time sharing knowledge about beliefand lifestyle, privately, with no immediate application to the documentaryprocess of the tribunal. The different types of information necessarily functiontogether in the different arenas of the inquisition tribunal.

This has been agiven since the introduction and entrenchment of the text-critical methods thatrevealed the different filters at work and the distortions that result from them,particularly in those texts produced in the context of a tribunal. Heresy is ofcourse, by definition, always relative, but what recent work has shown is thatits representation in text is a major part of how that otherness is created andmaintained, even if the precise meaning or significance of that representation –from what is it built and to what end – is debated. Once layers of distortion areidentified in a text, however, there is a tendency to peel them away in aneagerness to see what lies beneath, and there is a danger that, in doing so, thesignificance of the layers themselves is disregarded; and, perhaps, the assump-tion that they are so easily removable is itself questionable. The purpose inlooking at a broad cross section of texts is to understand, rather, what thoselayers are and how they work: how the constructions relate to each other, howthey are combined and whether something can be said about the ideas andpreoccupations of the writers as visible in texts.The themes that we will look at are themselves in many ways intercon-nected, but for the sake of clarity the general construction of heresy has beendivided here into three main areas. At the end of the chapter we will considerthe most basic level of the construct, the meanings of the terms ‘heresy’ and‘heretic’. Before that, there will be an examination of the role played by ideasof number in the representation of heresy. First, though, we will look at thefigurative construction of heresy – that is, the way in which our authors usethe various commonplaces and rhetorical devices of the anti-hereticaltradition.1541Peter Lombard,Sententiae in IV libris distinctaexiii.2, ed.

His analysis of the rhetorical patterns used by authorswriting about heresy in the Middle Ages outlined several elements in an ideathat he saw stretching from the eleventh century to well into the fifteenth.Beginning with pride, he said, heretics were further characterized by theirsecrecy, their wolf-like hiddenness and deceptive appearance. While theseelements applied to all heretics regardless of differences between them, diver-sity was nonetheless introduced through one of the most important parts ofthe topos, that of the little foxes.2That the imagery and representation ofheresy was governed by rhetorical norms is now taken for granted; as an ideait has been influential in a number of studies, notably Lerner’s and Cohn’s, andseveral subsequent historians have addressed the different commonplacesdirectly. Like Grundmann, his pupil Alexander Patschovsky also sees a broadidea of heresy that encompassed all heretics, characterized by metaphors ofidolatry, monstrosity and poison.3Beverly Kienzle, as part of her work on theCistercians, has in a similar way outlined four rhetorical patterns in theanti-heretical tradition of the twelfth century – demonization, pollution, threatto social order and apocalypticism – which all converge to portray heretics ingeneral. Within these patterns she points to a series of polarities and recurrentimages, again: the foxes, serpents, dogs, wolves and tares, all of whichcombine to create a vocabulary of hostile rhetoric.4The patterns and common-places of figurative construction in the mid thirteenth century material sharesome of these themes, but reading the texts together also shows a different setof preoccupations and a different use of the same images, which suggests thatthe topos is neither as static nor as singular as Grundmann describes it.Some texts are more involved with the development of the topos thanothers. The inquisition records and the canons of the regional church councilsdo not compete well here with the rich language of theexemplaor the treatises,or even of the larger councils and decretals, but there are nonetheless severalthemes that are so widely spread that they warrant examination. The focushere will not be so much on the many stock phrases that recur with varyingfrequency in the anti-heretical tradition; the image of the dog returning to eatits own vomit, which so ‘preoccupied medieval commentators’, employedoften in the context of relapse, for example.5Rather than those stand-alone155De heresi2Grundmann, ‘Typus’, esp. pp. 98–100.3A.

After the lion, the fox was the second most popular animal in exem-plar literature – in large part because of Reynard – and was renowned for itscunning, though for some writers it was also a dirty creature.6Grundmannsaw the fox as one of the most prominent images used to describe heretics inmedieval Biblical exegesis, more prominent indeed than the perhaps moreobvious Pauline passage on the necessity of heretics among the faithful.7Certainly, in anti-heretical writing of the twelfth century, the fox in the vine-yard was the leitmotiv of the Cistercian tradition that dominated the church’sresponse to the newly emergent heresy.8The image rests on the verse in theSong of Songs in which the spouse says to her beloved ‘catch us the little foxesthat destroy the vine’, where the little foxes are interpreted as the heretics, thevine the Catholic Church.9The association was given particular emphasis andimpetus by St Bernard’s sixty-fifth and sixty-sixth sermons on the Song ofSongs, written after his anti-heretical mission of 1143.10Such an interpretation was attached to this verse long before Bernard’stime, not least by Augustine, and by Irenaeus of Lyons in his treatise againstheretics.11The twelfth-century gloss on the Bible, begun by Anselm of Laon,however, made it contemporary and direct; although it is not extensive, theOrdinary Gloss for this passage clearly indicates how it is to be understood.The interlinear reads forcapite, ‘the voice of Christ against heresies’, that is the156Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century6Ibid., pp. 53–4, 61.7I Corinthians 11.19: ‘Nam oportet et haereses esse, ut et qui probati sunt manifesti fiant invobis’; H.

The marginal gloss reinforces this, promoting not only preaching andexample but active defence: ‘it is not enough ... unless we correct those whoare erring’.12At various other points in theGlossa ordinaria, where otherBiblical foxes are interpreted to mean heretics, it is almost always in directreference to this passage – foxes elsewhere in the Bible are heretics because ofthe interpretation of the verse in the Song of Songs. Another, slightly later,commentary on the same book, by Alain de Lille, is equally explicit about thisconnection: ‘by foxes, which are deceitful creatures, living in dens in theground, are to be understood heretics; for vines, are to be understood theChurch ...; capture for us, that is for our welfare destroy, foxes, that is heretics;little, on account of their frailty’.13Despite the longevity of the tradition, however, it was undoubtedlyBernard’s use of the passage and the weight that he put on it in his condemna-tion of heretics that led to the general adoption of the fox imagery in the yearsthat followed. ‘What shall we do with those foxes, the most malicious of all,who would rather inflict injury than win a victory in open fight?’ ‘Indeed,when a vine has been spoilt this is a sign that a fox has been there.’14Hissermons on the Song of Songs enjoyed an extremely wide diffusion: there aremore than 100 manuscripts extant from the twelfth and early thirteenthcentury.15After these sermons were written the frequency with which the littlefoxes appear in anti-heretical literature increases dramatically, not leastbecause it was the Cistercians who provided much of the twelfth-centurymaterial on heresy. The tradition of fox imagery, then, Cistercian in theprincipal form in which it is inherited by the thirteenth century, is continued inour period and extended, in one specific way (to which we will return shortly),and also to a more general association between heretics and foxes.157De heresi12‘Vox Christi adversus haereses’; ‘schismaticos et haereticos qui callidi sunt, et se humilesfingunt’;parvulasbecause ‘in ipso initio fraudis, ne maiores effectae amplius noceant’; ‘nonsufficit ... nisi etiam errantes corrigamus’;Biblia sacra, cum glossis ...

The etymology of St Dominic’s name provided by theFerrandilegendaand by the Golden Legend plays on the idea of the saint as‘custos Domini’ of various things, including ‘the vine of the Lord of Hosts’, anassociation made more explicit by Ferrandi’s later description of the heretics inLanguedoc that ‘were demolishing the vine of the Lord of Hosts’.19Here, theallusion is to a tradition now so fully absorbed by anti-heretical rhetoric that areference to the ‘vine’ is alone enough to conjure the necessary associations,even in the canons of a church council: ‘heretics and their believers andsupporters strive to demolish the vine of the Lord of Hosts’.20If the vine has become generalized, so too have the foxes. If ‘heretics’ can be,as in the above cases, used in place of ‘foxes’, the reverse is also true, andseveral of our texts usevulpessynonymously withheretici.

The foxes in the vine represent, in our texts, a general inheritance ofimagery from the twelfth-century work of the Cistercians and the glossators.To this generalized use of the fox imagery a new layer is added at the turnof the century by Innocent III’s 1199 decretalVergentis in senium. Next to acontinued and undiluted use of the Song of Songs imagery, in phrases such as‘the moth in the flower, and the foxes in the fruit labour to destroy the vine ofthe lord’, and ‘to capture the foxes that demolish the vine of the lord’, the richrhetoric of Innocent’s prose introduces this device: ‘against such small foxes,having different appearances, but tied together by the tails’.22The source forthis new element is ultimately the passage in Judges in which Samson ‘wentand caught three hundred foxes, and coupled them tail to tail, and fastenedtorches between the tails’.23Unlike the Song of Songs foxes, the Judges versehas no interpretation in the Ordinary Gloss that connects these verses to here-tics or heresy in any way. The gloss for the eightieth Psalm, however, does justthat: ‘therefore Samson tied the tails of the foxes ... foxes are the deceitful,especially heretics’, an interpretation which is echoed in other commentariesthat draw on the same source as the Gloss – that is, Augustine.24In severalplaces, Augustine interprets Samson’s foxes in Judges as heretics, oftenconnecting this explicitly to the foxes of Solomon.25As St Bernard’s commentary made a previous tradition current for hisperiod, so Innocent’sVergentistakes a precedented association and places itfirmly in the contemporary frame of reference for the discussion of heresy,especially through the direct juxtaposition with the theme of the previouscentury, a construction further reinforced by the decretal’s later inclusion inthe treatment of heresy in the 1234Liber extra. Like the vine, because hereticswere so generally synonymous with foxes, the two types of fox are easily inter-changeable. Thomas Agni, in his life of Peter Martyr, says that he ‘sought afterand scattered Samson’s foxes’ in the context of his inquisitorial office, hereneatly combining shorthand references to both traditions.26The conjoined tailsalso become a discrete element in their own right, in legal language especially.159De heresiheretics: L. de Kerval (ed.),Sancti Antonii de Padua vitae duae quarum altera hucusque inedita(Paris, 1904), pp. 219–21.22‘In flore tinea et vulpes in fructu demoliri vineam Domini moliuntur’; ‘capere vulpesdemolientes vineam Domini’; ‘licet autem contra vulpes huiusmodi parvulas, speciesquidem habentes diversas, sed caudas ad invicem colligatas’; X 5 7.10, Friedberg, II, 782.23‘Perrexitque et cepit trecentas vulpes, caudasque earum iunxit ad caudas, et faces ligavit inmedio’; Judges 15.4–5.24‘Ideo Samson caudas vulpium colligavit ...

TheDe heresisection of the fourth book ofStephen of Bourbon’s collection ofexemplauses the image of Samson’s foxes inthis way; the heretics are ‘tied together in their posterior parts by their tails,because they are all intent on one thing, fighting the church, like Samson’sfoxes’.30An even fuller version of this prefixes Stephen’s account of a hereticalmeeting in which none of the parties can agree on correct doctrine: ‘they arelike Samson’s foxes, in Judges, who had their tails tied together and differentfaces, because they have allied aims in attacking the faith of the church ...among themselves they quarrel, and against us they all combine’.31There is afurther extension of this idea in the Anonymous of Passau, which uses theother side of this implication to characterize the subject as essentially divided.We will return to this theme shortly; what is interesting here, and what furtherunderlines the level to which this has been assimilated into the anti-heretical160Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century27‘Haereticos universos, quibuscumque nominibus censeantur facies quidem diversashabentes, sed caudas ad invicem colligatas’; García,Lateran 4, p. 47; trans.DEC, I, 233. Thesubstitution of ‘facies’, whereVergentishas ‘species’, to describe the variety of the heretics’appearance is perhaps explained as an allusion to, or slippage from the torches,faces, of theBiblical passage.28‘Ad omnes fideles’: ‘Excommunicamus ... universos haereticos ... quibuscunquenominibus censeantur, facies quidem habentes diversas, sed caudas adinvicem colligatas’.Though it is directed against all heretics, like Lucius III’s decretal, Gregory takes the precau-tion of providing a selection of names: ‘universos haereticos, Catharos, Patarenos, Pauperesde Lugduno, Passaginos, Iosephinos, Arnaldistas, Speronistas, et alios, quibuscunque’ etc.X 5 7.13, X 5 7.15, Friedberg II, 787; 789; Mansi, XXIII, 583.29Gregory IX still uses the original vines and foxes inIlle humani generis.30‘Sunt coadunati sive colligati ex parte posteriori in caudis quia omnis tendunt ad unumquia intendunt impugnare ecclesiam ut vulpes sampsonis qui habebant facies diversascolligatas caudas’; Oxford, Oriel MS 68, fol. 218va–vb, BnF MS Lat. 14599 fol. 234ra.31‘Sunt similes vulpibus Samsonis, de quibus Judicum, qui habebant caudas colligatas etfacies divisas, quia intenciones habent conjunctas ad impugnandum fidem Ecclesie, ... interse dissident, et contra nos omnes conveniunt’; Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus, p. 278.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:29:28 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"canon, is the fact that in the latter example, and indeed also in the previousexample from Stephen of Bourbon, though it purports to be the Judgespassage, the text quoted by the Anonymous of Passau is in fact that of Inno-cent’s decretal, and of its later extension in subsequent legislation: ‘Just as it isread in the book of Judges: that Samson’s foxes had different faces, but weretied together by the tails: so heretics are divided into sects among themselves,but are united in their attack on the church.’32To the threat embodied in and expressed through the earlier Song of Songsfoxes is now added another layer, the unified nature of that apparently pluralthreat, represented by the Judges foxes. The older strand remains, and isindeed so ingrained as to be almost incidental in places, and to allow the easyand natural assimilation of the newer layer, though the function of the latter ismore active, and perhaps more pointed, than the vine imagery. Though theOrvieto register and the council of Narbonne, as we have seen, continue toemploy Solomon’s foxes, rather than Samson’s, in the legal material and theinquisitors’ manuals Innocent’s foxes have been adopted as a motif and adevice. What has perhaps already been noticeable here, in comparison withthe trend of the previous century or so, is that, as a motif, foxes are almostcompletely absent from the polemic of the thirteenth century.False appearanceOur polemical sources do not, in fact, as a whole, deal in ‘rhetorical’ attacks onheretics, unsurprising if one thinks of the aloof scholarship of Moneta ofCremona. In general, they prefer to employ a sort of adjectival invective,attached usually to the direct address and accompanying the refutation, ratherthan comprising it. Nonetheless, where there is a level of rhetorical construc-tion in the polemics it is most likely to rest upon the topos of the false appear-ance of the heretic. That idea is, in fact, the most common across the whole ofour corpus of texts in its frequency and certainly in its distribution, afrequency matched only by the running theme of corruption, but far moreconcentrated and sharply drawn than the latter, in places drawing that olderidea into some sort of superstructure. While the foxes are largely absent fromthe polemical material, the more complex set of imagery that surrounds theidea of false appearance makes up most of what little figurative representationthe polemics do employ. In fact, one of the richest expressions of the idea canbe found in the Pseudo-James Capelli, who stands alone among the polemi-161De heresi32‘Sicut in Iudicum libro legitur: quod vulpes Sampsonis facies diversas habebant, sed caudassibi invicem colligatas: sic haeretici in sectis sunt divisi in se, sed in impugnatione Ecclesiae,sunt uniti’; Anonymous of Passau, p. 264. Compare this to the Biblical passage: ‘perrexitqueet cepit trecentas vulpes, caudasque earum iunxit ad caudas, et faces ligavit in medio’, towhich it bears little relation, and toVergentis, and later legislation: ‘licet autem contravulpes huiusmodi parvulas, species quidem habentes diversas, sed caudas ad invicemcolligatas’, and ‘facies quidem diversas habentes’.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:29:28 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"cists in his colourful language, and who provides a useful way in to the explo-ration of this idea.The Pseudo-James’ chapter on heretics’ abstinence from meat and eggsopens with these pointed words:Since no truth supports the pernicious traditions of the heretics, they thereforeseason them with the flavour of simulated virtues, so that the pleasing sweet-ness of honey makes the hidden poison less perceptible. They have indeed theappearance of piety, but, bearing as they do the rapacity of wolves underneatha sheep’s skin, they do not have the virtue of holiness. ... In fact their religion isshown to be false ... For they may use a cloak of good works to recommendfalse doctrine.33Present here are most of the principal images and terms associated with thisidea of a pretended outward form, which we can look at before we move toconsider the wider aspects of this theme. Much of the general vocabulary usedto convey false appearance can be found here: the cloaking of a real agenda,usually with words, here with good deeds; the simulation, whether of piety orof religion. Noticeable as well here is the underlying venom of the heretics’true nature.34The Pseudo-James’ contrast between the outer pretended piety and theinner reality of heretics as wolves in sheep’s clothing combines the two mainScriptural images that form part of the basis of the topos. The first, theravening wolves, is taken from the warning of Matthew’s gospel to bewarefalse prophets: ‘beware of false prophets who come to you in the clothing ofsheep, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. By their fruits may you knowthem.’ False prophets, and the ravening wolves, are all understood to refer‘particularly to heretics’ by the Ordinary Gloss.35The Gloss further explainsthat those wolves and pseudo-prophets are ‘covered with the clothing ofpiety’, an allusion to the other Scriptural image that underlies the Pseudo-James’ construction. Thespecies pietatisthat the sheep’s clothing affords the162Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century33‘Quum nulla veritas hereticorum perniciosas traditiones subsequatur ideo eas quodamsimulatarum virtutum sapore condiunt ut per dulcedinem mellis quem placet, minussentiatur venenum quod latet; habent quidem speciem pietatis sed sub ovina pelle luporumrapacitatem gestantes sanctitatis virtutem non habent ...

Justas often, George places the vocabulary of false appearance in the mouth of hisheretical opponent, who accuses the Catholic speaker of using ‘cloakedlanguage’, and the Catholic church of having both ‘spot and wrinke, becausethere are there [in the Catholic church] adulterers ... and ravening wolves’.38In another example, the polemical treatise attributed by Kaeppeli to PeterMartyr states that the heretics refrain from meat and eggs because they saythat it leads to sin, but ‘this they do not believe, for all that they insist on itwhen in the presence of those they believe to be simple’. Like George, here is apicture of feigned appearance that does not necessarily depend on the receivedimagery, and one that adds another layer of pretence, directed specifically atthe ascetic pretensions of heretics.39Moneta’s text, however, more an academicrefutation than an attack, does not use this or any of the other topoi toconstruct or attack his opponent. Even Salvo Burci, whose prose is the oppo-site of Moneta’s in precision and in colour, uses this motif sparingly,describing ‘all the depravity of heretics, who say [things] under the habit andappearance of religion’.40The polemical approach to heresy adopted by thesetexts has little need of rhetoric that is directed at the quality of their opponentwhen what they want to target is the content of their error.In contrast stands the incidence of this motif in the church legislation, andsubsequently the legal textbook of Gregory IX. Aside from a commentary on163De heresi36‘Quaedam pietatis veste tecti’; ‘habentes speciem quidem pietatis virtutem autem eiusabnegantes’; II Timothy 3.5.37‘Tristes ypocrite, qui exterminatas habetis facies, ut videamini ieiunantes et honesti, etsodomiticum potius scelus eligitis, masculorum concubitores!’;Disputatio, p. 18.38‘Palliato sermone’; ‘maculam et rugam, quia sunt ibi adulteri, ... lupi rapaces’;Disputatio,pp. 56, 77.39‘Istam non credunt, tamen allegant ipsam coram illis quos simplices existimant esse’;Kaeppeli, ‘Une somme’, p. 331.40‘Omnis errecticorum pravitas, qui sub habitu et specie religionis dicunt’; Salvo Burci,Suprastella, pp. 252, 249.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:29:28 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"the princes of Judea by Jerome, which connects heretics to sophistry and thedialectic arts, there is little of this imagery to be found in theDecretum, consti-tuted, as it is, almost entirely from the writings of the Fathers and the earlychurch. Gregory IX’sLiber extra, on the other hand, is replete with the imageryand language that characterize this strand of rhetoric; not, it has to beobserved, in the additions that it makes from the texts of antiquity and thechurch Fathers, but in its inclusion of the work of recent and contemporarypopes. The new material in theLiber extrareflects a shift, in which false appear-ance is now a very prominent part of the canon-legal idea of heretics.Several of the twelfth-century church councils contain references to falseappearance in their treatment of heretics. As early as the 1119 council ofToulouse heretics were condemned as ‘eos qui religionis speciem simulantes’.The canons of the council of Rheims in 1157 similarly describe ‘Manicheans’operating ‘under the appearance of religion’, deceiving the simple, in partic-ular themulierculaeof the second letter to Timothy. The danger to the ‘simple’stands in direct relation to the level of secrecy in the heretic’s behaviour againat Tours: ‘the more it creeps in secret, the more grievously the vine of the lordis destroyed in the simple’.41Noticeable is the prominence of thespeciesimagefrom Timothy discussed above; here it is a ‘species religionis’ and not‘pietatis’, though in fact the gloss for this verse gives ‘religionis’ as an explana-tion of ‘pietatis’. With Lucius III’sAd abolendam, however, the use of that verseto describe the nature of heretics is made explicit in direct quotation: thosewho preach without a mission do so ‘having the appearance of piety, but, asthe apostle has said, denying its power’.42While that image is entrenched by the beginning of the thirteenth century,the broad theme of the false appearance of heretics is really brought to the foreby the output of Innocent III, in particular, again, byVergentis in senium. Thefollowing quotation makes clear how strongly that decretal emphasizes falseappearance, framed in the language of Timothy:They are the innkeepers who mix water with wine, and offer the poison of theBabylonian dragon in a golden chalice to drink, having, according to the Apos-tle, the appearance of piety, but inwardly denying its virtue ... thus far thedeadly plague could not be destroyed, but rather, just like cancer, was creepingimperceptibly wider in secret, and now may openly spread abroad the poisonof its wickedness, while, cloaked in the appearance of religion, he who had notbeen the disciple of truth, now made master of error, both deceives many sim-ple people, and seduces some astute ones.43164Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century41‘Sub specie religionis’; ‘quanto serpit occultis tanto gravius Dominicam vineam insimplicibus demolitur’; Fredericq, I, 29, 35–6, 39.42‘Sub specie pietatis virtutum eius, iuxta quod ait Apostolus, denegantes’; X 5 7.9, Friedberg,II, 780; trans.

Though the seduction of the simple and the infirm had character-ized heretics in the previous Lateran council, the third canon of the 1215meeting quotes directly from Timothy in its portrayal of its subject: ‘some,having the appearance of piety, but (as the apostle has said), denying itspower’. The inserted words may indicate a quotation fromAd abolendam.47Bythe 1230s not only has the language of Innocent’s anti-heretical legislationbecome the standard mode for papal output in Gregory’s decretals, it isreflected also in the secular law of the emperor, in theLiber Augustalis, whichuses much the same vocabulary, as well as many wolves and lots of snakes,making false appearance one of the foremost traits of heretics in anti-hereticallegislation.The canon-legal tradition seems once again to set the tone in terms of thelanguage used to discuss heresy, but the predominance of the theme of false165De heresiabnegantes ... nondum tamen usque adeo pestis potuit mortificari mortifera, quin, sicutcancer, amplius serperet in occulto, et iam in aperto suae virus iniquitatis effundat, dumpalliata specie religionis et multos decipit simplices, et quosdam seducit astutos, factusmagister erroris, qui non fuerat discipulus veritatis’; X 5 7.10, Friedberg, II, 782.

In the legal material it is often used in connection withusurpation and competition. So it is in the other texts, especially those whichrelate to a preaching context, at one remove or another. The function of the textin the context of confrontation with heretics and heretical ideas shapes thepreoccupation of the topos with a theme that undermines the enemy andpromotes the legitimacy of the Catholic speaker. False appearance is the domi-nant construction among theexemplacollections in particular, where thedeceptive nature of the heretic lies at the centre of many of the stories they tellabout heresy. Theexemplabuild their picture of false appearance using some ofthe same passages employed to such great effect in the legislation: Caesarius ofHeisterbach refers to heretics as ‘ravening wolves’ and believes Matthew’swarning about the pseudo-Christs and pseudo-prophets to have been fulfilledin the Amalricians.48References to these Scriptural motifs are sometimes moreallusive than specific, and theexemplawriters also generalize the basic images,so that the wolves, like the foxes, are on their own enough to recall the associa-tions of those motifs. That indirect use is at work in Jacques de Vitry’s auto-matic labelling of heretics aslupiin hisexempla, even where there is not thenany explicit development to false appearance.49Here the association with here-tics interacts with a wider tradition of the Scriptural wolf imagery, which isused generally to signify those who cannot be trusted with the fate of thesimple.50Wolves and all their connotations are, though, only one element of aprevalent idea of false appearance that is often built into the fabric of thesestories, and if false appearance occurs with some frequency in theexemplacited, of Caesarius and Jacques, in theTractatus de diversis materiisit isunavoidable.The basic tenor of Stephen of Bourbon’s treatment of heretics, and this issomething that functions at both a background and a foreground level, is acriticism of their deception of the simple, Stephen’s ultimate audience. Here-tics approach the simple ‘wishing to pervert [them], by disguised appear-ance’.51Consequently, the pretence of the heretics’ outward persona runs as aprominent image through much of what Stephen has to say about them,though it is an image located as much in their false speech as in their appear-ance. A Waldensian heretic, while literally disguised, ‘transfiguratus’, is alsodeceptive in his ‘sophistical words’. Stephen’s concern with the ‘sophisms’ and‘the duplicities of words’ employed by heretics is such that, as we have seen, itoccupies a large part of his ‘how to spot a heretic’ section, and here that166Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century48Caesarius,Dialogus, I, 296, 305, quoting Matthew 7.15 and 24.24.49Vitry, Greven, p. 57.50The wolf that eats the sheep it should be guarding is used by Odo of Cheriton, for example,to signify corrupt priests: Salisbury, ‘Human Animals’, p. 56.51‘Cupientes pervertere eum, dissimulato habitu’; Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus, p. 277.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:29:28 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"concern, elsewhere focused on the simple, is extended to the deception also ofthe learned. Indeed, the sophistry of heretics forms another layer of the falseappearance topos. The same anxiety – that heretics are capable of misleadingnot only the simple but also the learned – also occurs inVergentis in senium: theheretic ‘both deceives many simple people, and seduces some astute ones’.52TheDecretum, likewise, includes a warning from Jerome that heretics ‘oftenoppress churchmen through their sophisms and dialectical arts’.53This aspectof the motif is the form in which it features in the inquisitors’ manuals, particu-larly in the Anonymous of Passau and even more so in the Pseudo-David ofAugsburg. In the latter text, as in Stephen’s text, it is employed primarily in thecontext of the seduction of the simple by heretics, alongside the wolf imageryof Matthew. Once their deception has succeeded in perverting their audience,then, as in Stephen’s story of the bird catcher heretic, their errors can be intro-duced or revealed. An emphasis on this type of false appearance parallels theinquisitors’ concerns with the deception not only of the simple but, moreimmediately, of the tribunal, and the obstruction of truth.If we turn again to the extract that we looked at from the Pseudo-James atthe beginning of this section, we can notice that the context in which thisdiatribe occurs – and it is by far one of the most extended attacks in this text asa whole – is that of the Cathars’ ascetic diet. Peter Martyr also expends a largeamount of energy defending the consumption of meat and eggs. A similarlevel of self-denial is described by the Pseudo-David for the Waldensians, witha similar level of contempt: ‘certain heretics afflict themselves with fasts andvigils and suchlike, because without such things they cannot acquire for them-selves the reputation of holiness among simple people, nor deceive [them]through the fiction of simulation’.54The connection here between false appear-ance and elements of an apostolic lifestyle is something that we have seenbefore, in the Dominican edifying texts, and one that perhaps forms its ownsub-tradition within the wider topos of deception. We have seen that this isoften employed in Dominican texts in connection with preaching or fasting,aspects of apostolicity where mendicant friars, and indeed the preachingchurch generally, would be in direct competition with the heretics in thepublic perception of the two groups. St Dominic competes explicitly on thislevel for the allegiance of a noble household by fasting more convincingly thanthe Cathar ‘Good Men’ who are staying there.55The abstinence of the heretics167De heresi52‘Verba sophistica’; Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus, pp. 279–80. ‘Sophismatibus’; ‘verborumduplicitatibus’; Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus, p. 288. ‘Multos decipit simplices, etquosdam seducit astutos’; X 5 7.10, Friedberg, II, 782.53‘Quod sophismatibus suis et arte dialectica sepe opprimant ecclesiasticos’; C.24 q.3 c.33,Friedberg, I, 999.54‘Quidam tamen haeretici affligunt se jejuniis & vigiliis & hujusmodi, quia sine talibus nonpossunt apud simplices nomen sibi sanctitatis acquirere, nec decipere simulationisfigmento’; Pseudo-David,De inquisitione, col. 1780.55Ferrandi,Legenda, MOPH 16, pp. 225–6, 228.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:29:28 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"in this story is characterized by Dominic’s hagiographer Ferrandi, in the samewords used by the author of theDisputatio, as the false piety of the hypocritesdescribed by Christ during the sermon on the mount: the heretics ‘they ravagetheir faces, in order to appear to people as men who fast’. In contrast to thisexcess, Dominic practises abstinence not to gain the praise of others but to leadthe faithless away from error and back to the love of the Catholic Church.56The theme of false appearance is prominent in Dominican literature, appar-ently as a foil to the Friars Preacher, to emphasize their true example andpreaching, and in part an element of the construction of their identity. We canlook to this perhaps as one of the motives behind the strong presence of thiselement in Stephen’s writing, who also uses a version of the Matthew verse‘they tear at their faces, that they may appear to others to be fasting’ to illus-trate their hiddenness, the third of his four signs by which ‘heretics especiallyare specified’.57The false sanctity of one of his more realistic heretics, Alberea,is indeed connected explicitly to her abstinence from meat and animal prod-ucts.58There are echoes in this last point of Grundmann’s observation, in hisanalysis of the false appearance motif, that saintliness had to some degreebecome in itself a mark of heresy. The author of the Anonymous of Passau isable to suggest asceticism as a method by which heretics could be recognized,using Paul’s words in the second letter to the Corinthians, the same transfigu-ration of evil into an angel of light used by Innocent in the letter quotedabove.59However, it is perhaps also possible to see behind this construction a back-ground and mundane reality to these concerns. In the course of their descrip-tion of the Cistercian legates that Diego met on his mission in the Languedoc,Stephen, as well as the accounts of the story in Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernayand the variouslegendaeof St Dominic, all also relate that the heretics use theopulent life of the churchmen against them in their perversion of the Catholicfaithful. In his introduction to the story Stephen makes this point succinctly:‘they do not have a stronger argument for the defence of their error and thesubversion of simple people than the bad examples of Catholics and especiallyof prelates’.60Stephen spins this into a criticism of the heretics, who resort tothis line of attack when they run out of other, better arguments. As Diegounderstood, however, the ability to exhibit and control the appearance of pietywas the arena in which the church and the heretics were competing – what168Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century56‘Exterminant quippe facies suas, ut videatur hominibus ieiunantes’; ibid., p. 226.

Who would not reckon them most holy?’ Thenobles’ admiring reaction to the superior display of fasting and prayer ofDominic and his companion – ‘truly these are good men’ – prompts the begin-nings of a return to the Catholic faith.62Outside the hagiographical traditions of the Order it is clear that this isindeed a major problem facing the Dominicans. The manual written for hisbrother preachers by the master general Humbert of Romans highlights theproblem, complaining of heretics who will travel widely to visit their followersand who collect alms to support the poor and lure people to their faith.Peraldus similarly claims that the illiterate cannot believe that the dignity ofthe church resides in men of evil life, who make easy targets for heretics’ accu-sations.63That heretical asceticism was indeed making a strong impact on the‘simple’, as these sources seem to fear, might be confirmed by the words of onedeponent before the inquisition, who believed that the heretics were good onaccount of their continued fasting.64The idea of false appearance therefore had a larger existence than its purelyrhetorical expressions. Further, the descriptive elements of the inquisitors’handbooks present a layer of deception in the appearance of heretics that isunconnected to any outward show of piety; rather, it is to do with the practicalreality of heretics’ lives. While Stephen of Bourbon’s story of the sophisticalWaldensian revolves around the deception exercised by the heretic, the mannonetheless also walks ‘transfiguratus’, in disguise, dressed as a crossbow-man. The comparison that Stephen draws between another senior Waldensianand Proteus is based on the fact that, when he is captured, the man is foundwith the trappings, ‘indicia’, of many different trades. These he had used todisguise himself as, variously, a pilgrim, a penitent, a cobbler, a barber, areaper – all occupations that would allow him the freedom of movementnecessary to meet with and administer to his followers. If he was sought under169De heresi61Arnold,Inquisition, p. 65.

That both men felt theneed to conceal their identity in public might remind us of the account givenby both Anselm of Alessandria and the Anonymous of Passau of the ‘crookedstick’ code used by the Cathars to determine whether or not they were amongfriends.65A further degree of hiddenness is visible in the communication ofheretical belief. Raniero tells us that there are some beliefs that are not taughtto the lesser grades, and this seems to be borne out by the author of the PeterMartyr treatise, who is insistent on the ‘secrets’ of the heretics: ‘this is one oftheir secrets and this pestilence they have stolen from the Saracens’, or ‘thiserror they drew from the heresy of the Manichees and is one of their arcanesecrets’. He also reports this speech as the opinion of the heretics on the subjectof transmigration of souls: ‘I shall disclose to you our most secret secret, whichfew even from ourconsolatiknow.’66TheVitae fratrumstory of the Tuscanyouth Florimund, who discovered the dualist nature of the Cathar sect onlyafter several years of membership, will be remembered here.Whatever the reality of their piety, then, there is certainly a level below therhetoric in which heretics, rather than being deceptive, are simply hidden. Ifwe look back to the twenty-seventh canon of the third Lateran council, we canfind a comparison of Cathars to other heretics in terms of their hiddenness:The damnable perversity of [those] heretics whom some call the Cathars,others the Patarenes, others the Publicani, and others by other names, hasgrown so strong, that they now they do not practise their wickedness in secret,as others do, but proclaim their error publicly and draw the simple and weak toagree with them.67Two things are significant here, the first of which is the ongoing concern forthe deception of the simple that runs through the whole of this topos ofappearance. The other point that needs to be noted is that there is an idea ofmultiple heretical groups, of which secrecy is apparently the normal condition.The Cathars, on the other hand, are able to preach openly because they arestrong, presumably as a result of the support of the nobles, given that this170Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century65‘Transfiguratus ad modum alicuijus balistarii’; Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus, p. 280.‘Aliquando quidam maximus inter eos fuit captus, qui secum ferebat multorumartificiorum indicia, in que quasi Proteus se transfigurabat: si quereretur in unasimilitudine et ei innotesceret, in alia se transmutabat’; Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus,p.293.

These had been long-standing elements of theanti-heretical tradition already by the time our texts were written, as a quickglance at the patristic texts that make up the twenty-fourthcausaof theDecretumeasily demonstrates. Heretics are a contaminant ‘who have pollutedcommunion’. One extract from Augustine sets up an opposition betweenhealth and correct belief on the one hand, and ‘pestilential and fatal dogmas’on the other. Another, from Jerome, draws a different medical parallel, whichlikens heresy to a putrid limb that must be removed to restore the health of thebody.68In our sources notions of corruption, medical or otherwise, are for the mostpart used in a far more generic way, in terms of the common vocabulary usedto describe heresy rather than in more complex constructions. A generalizedvocabulary of corruption and infection is employed in the description ofheresy in what at times seems to be an almost inadvertent manner. Heresy –the ‘tares’ which ‘in everything corrupt faith’ – corrupts or infects wherever itsaction is described: the ‘land of the Albigensians’ is ‘infected land’.69TheLiberinquisitionisof Orvieto, which has perhaps the richest language of all the inqui-sition records considered here, makes quite frequent use of that generalconnection in its sentences. Here, again, heresy is depicted as ‘deadly plague’,while the accused refuse the cure of penance.70It is worth taking a closer look at one aspect of the inheritance of the specifi-cally medical aspect of this theme, which appears in the patristic literature171De heresi68‘Qui pollutam habent conmunionem’; ‘pestifera et mortifera dogmata’; C.24 q.3 cc.31, 16,36, Friedberg, I, 998, 995, 1000.69‘In omnibus fidem corrumpunt’;Disputatio, p. 4, also p. 66. ‘Terram albigensium ... terraminfectam’; Stephen of Bourbon,Tractatus, p. 79; a priest is also ‘perversus ab hereticis, itaexemplo suo infecit parrochiam suam’; p. 215. ‘Zizania’; ‘monachus: in tantum enimAlbiensium error invaluit, ut brevi intervallo temporis infecerit usque ad mille civitates’;Caesarius,Dialogus, I, 300, 301.70‘Letiferam pestem’; ‘tanquam proprie vite hostes medicum et medelam’; d’Alatri,Orvieto,e.g. pp. 221, 227.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:29:28 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"included by theDecretum. The treatment of heresy as disease and the corre-sponding role of the Catholic Church as medic together formed a concept thatunderstood the church’s relationship to sin in general in terms of the physi-cian–patient relationship, where sin was disease, the sinner patient, and thechurch stood in imitation of Christ asmedicus.71Originally borrowed by theFathers from the pagan philosophers, in the writing of our period the idearemained current: in the prologue to hisSumma contra gentilesAquinas draws aparallel between himself, or the wise man, promoting truth and refuting error,and the medic, promoting health and defeating illness.72According to several scholars of earlier heresy, in fact, disease was the mostprominent characterization of heresy in the pre-inquisition period. Lobrichonsees two standard commonplaces in eleventh-century representations ofheresy: as a putrid limb, with echoes of Jerome, and as a plague from else-where.73Moore takes this further and suggests a deliberate parallel betweenthe representations of heresy and leprosy in the twelfth-century material,though incidence of direct comparison seems uncommon. Ziegler’s analysis ofthe relationship between ideas of medicine and religion in this period wouldsuggest, rather, that the ‘medicalization’ of religious language really began ingeneral only at a later date, in the latter half of the thirteenth century, andspecializedmedical vocabulary became attached to erroneous belief and heresyeven later.74Certainly, in our material there are general terms of disease, to dowith plague and infection, and it is perhaps this underlying assumption, ofheresy as infection, that to some extent informs the concern shown by theregional legislation on heresy to eradicate all physical locations in which here-tics or heretical rites have been present or carried out. Reference to moreexplicitly medical terms, however, such as Salvo’s warning to his ‘dearestbrothers’ to ‘beware of these lepers’, is rare, and not developed.75Jacques de Vitry manages nicely to combine our various elements in oneexemplumabout a family of women ‘corrupted by heretical disease’, one ofwhom tries to ruin her daughter with ‘the venom of her perfidy’, and whoappears after her death as a ‘cursed old woman, fetid and most foul’.76Jacques172Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century71See, for example, R.

If we turn to look at an extract from Caesarius’sDialogus, we will see this theme at work, here once again in the context of falseappearance:Two men, simple in dress, but not in heart, ravening wolves rather than sheep... pretending the deepest piety. They were pale and wasted, they walked bare-foot, they fasted every day; there was never a night when they were absentfrom solemn matins in the cathedral, nor would they accept from anyone morethan the most meagre food. When by such hypocrisy they had gained the good-will of all the people, then and not till then, they began to pour forth their hid-den poison.77Caesarius’s words here are reminiscent of Stephen of Bourbon’s bird catcher,and of the extract from the Pseudo-James, quoted at the beginning of the lastsection, where the sweetness of honey disguises the taste of the poisonbeneath. If the falseness of the heretics’ apparent piety is the most prominenttopos at work in our texts, then the broad idea of corruption and venom tosome extent functions in this context as the underlying nature that that façadeconceals.As with all our themes, corruption has its own attendant animal image. Theconnection between the deception of heretics and the venom underlying theiroutward form is reiterated and developed further by their portrayal as snakes,and the frequency with which heretics’ words or presence are characterized byeither venom or poison is related to the similarly frequent invocation of theirsnake-like nature. The snake is the only animal imagery that features with anyreal frequency in the polemics, though even then it is only in two of the texts.TheDisputatioand thesummaeof Moneta of Cremona and Peter Martyr main-tain their general avoidance of this type of construction throughout. Theauthor of the Pseudo-James text, though, makes use of this imagery in hisdescriptions of the heretics as ‘pouring forth the deadly poison of depravedheresy’.78They are, the author tells us in language that echoes once again thatofVergentis, ‘crafty serpents; innkeepers mixing water with wine’.79173De heresi76‘Heretica pestis corruptis’; ‘corrumpere’; ‘veneno perfidie sue’; ‘vetula maledicta fetida etturpissima’; Vitry, Greven, p. 57, no. 96, p. 58, no. 98.

Comparing theheretics to the ancient serpent who ‘with clever words seduced the heart ofinnocence’, Salvo tells us that from this ‘[ancient] serpent, these little serpents,that is heretics, have their doctrine’. To dispel any remaining ambiguity heclarifies for those who ‘wish to see clearly if the doctrine of these heretics isfrom Satan’.80The heretic as snake image is one that he reuses from time totime in address – ‘Oh serpentine heretics’ – but the idea of heretics asvenomous generally – ‘Oh heretics, full of poison’ – is also one that hedevelops: ‘they are like a scorpion, because the scorpion flatters with thetongue, and then with the tail applies venom ... venom, that is, falsedoctrine’.81Salvo’s heretical opponent also lays a similar charge at the feet ofthe Catholics, calling the Roman church ‘prostitute and nest of serpents andbeast’ and ‘nest of the serpent’.82Apart from making a straightforward equation between snakes and here-tics, the Pseudo-James also sees a serpentine source and quality for the heresythey maintain, which comes ‘out of the breasts of serpents ... of their viperousopinions’.83The serpent is also cited as a source of error by the normally reti-cent Raniero Sacconi during his discussion of Cathar sacraments, in a phrasemade all the more unsavoury by the aridity of Raniero’s usual style: theirpenance ‘is false and vain, deceptive and poisonous ... the poison of errorwhich they have sucked from the mouth of the old serpent’.84Again, heresy isvenom, and the ultimate source serpentine, the snake in the last two instancesstanding as a figure for the devil.

The common-places of language and imagery that Grundmann identified as the topos, andwhich provided a common stock of vocabulary and images from whichauthors could draw, are all present in the thirteenth-century texts, and aredistributed through texts as diverse as the canons of church councils and theexemplacollections, though not always to the same effect. The main themes ofthat topos crystallized around vivid animal images – of the fox, the wolf andthe serpent – drawn ultimately from Scripture. However, while our authorswere able to rely on a shared and standard set of figurative devices neither theform nor the function of those devices remained static. Although someelements in the figurative tradition were already well-established, particularlyideas of corruption and disease that had been used in the representation ofheretics since the patristic era, a layering and accumulation can be seen to havetaken place over time, particularly in contrast with the period immediatelypreceding ours, most obviously perhaps in the image of the foxes that had sodominated the Cistercian anti-heretical tradition of the previous century.By the time our texts are being written, the little foxes among the vines –derived from the Ordinary Gloss on the Song of Songs and promoted by thework of Bernard of Clairvaux – have become ingrained to the point where theindividual elements of the idea can stand independently and still represent thewhole. The metonymic form in which Solomon’s foxes survived provided afoundation for the introduction and dissemination, throughVergentis in seniumand subsequent legislation, of Samson’s foxes. The use of that Judges verseintroduced a duality of division and unity into the topos of the heretic, whichreinforced and coincided with wider notions of number and cohesion and wasabsorbed rapidly into the anti-heretical tradition alongside the originalvulpeculae.While the imagery of heretics as foxes is modified, there are more signifi-cant changes at work here. Where the foxes had provided the leitmotiv of theCistercian-led polemic of the previous century, in thirteenth-century polemic itis a minor presence where it is present at all. The polemical sources are in factcuriously reticent about their use of this type of construction. Although it isnot absent, and though it appears more strongly in the Pseudo-James and theLiber suprastella, for the most part any invective that these texts direct towardsheretics is restricted to incidental remarks. By contrast, in the case of the foxes,175De heresi85On the association of heretics with the devil, see K. U. Tremp,Von der Häresie zur Hexerei:‘wirkliche’ und imaginäre Sekten im Spätmittelalter, Monumenta Germaniae Historica,Schriften 59 (Hannover, 2008).This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:29:28 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"it is the papal output that leads the way in the development and formation ofthe anti-heretical rhetoric of this period, not least the writings of Innocent III.More significant is the shift away from the foxes and toward false appear-ance as the principal element of the topos. The growth and spread of the lattertheme in our period makes it by far the most widespread and the most devel-oped aspect of this level of construction. The two-sidedness of heretics, thedisparity between their outer persona, characterized by false prophets andwolves, and their inner condition, which has the quality of corruption and thecharacter of snakes, build a picture of a hidden nature and a false holiness. Thetheme was particularly prominent in Dominican literature, such as theexemplacollection of Stephen of Bourbon, and especially in the accounts of the earlyyears of the Order and its founder saint; in that hagiographical tradition falseappearance played a role both in the construction of the heretics of the storyand in constructing the Order itself through juxtaposition with those heretics.The function of false appearance in these texts seems to have been born, atleast in part, out of the interaction of early Dominican preachers with hereticsin the south of France, and their competition for the devotion of the laitythrough the superior holiness of their lifestyle. The prominence of falseappearance in the Dominican material suggests a new dominance in anti-heretical writing, and that while the legal rhetoric may have driven changes inthe language used, the core of the topos now reflected not Cistercian butMendicant concerns.Again, though, there is a layering of the construction here. To the Scripturaland polemical elements of false appearance is added a kind of practicalhiddenness that seems to reflect a heretical lifestyle of disguise and secrecy,and which is apparently drawn from observation and experience. The positionof false appearance as the dominant element in that construction was perhapsmore broadly reflective of the changing nature of heresy and the increasingrole of inquisition in the church’s response to it. A connection to thepost-crusade, post-inquisition reality of heresy suggests itself here in the movefrom fox to wolf. In the first place, it is easy to see an association between theirgenerally hidden nature and an increasing need to be secretive in the face of arenewed campaign of repression by the church. The aspect of hiddenness andsecrecy that runs through the theme is surely the counterpart of the moreactive seeking out of heretics by the church, and the subsequent practical needfor heretics to be hidden, especially after the 1230s – something that we can seebehind all the deposition accounts of night-time journeys and secret meetings.That campaign, which put heresy at the front of the church’s agenda, canperhaps also be seen reflected in the predominance of the wolf and a moreacute sense of the danger of heresy.86Overall, the complex of commonplaces and images that made up the topos176Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century86L.

Though the component elements of the tradition may haveremained relatively stable, the role of those elements, or the emphasis that theyreceived, appears to have changed according to their contemporary applica-tion. Rather than dictating the way in which the texts could represent theirsubject, the elements of the topos were instead drawn on and adapted to suitthe purpose of the text and the function to which it would be put.NumberThe updated papal version of the fox imagery that is drawn from the book ofJudges constructs heretics in two ways: as plural, and as united against thechurch. Throughout our sources the ideas of number that the fox topos reflectsare a consistent feature of the construction of heresy, comprising several inter-connected elements.Contemporary with the appearance of the renewed fox imagery of Inno-cent’sVergentis in senium, Alain de Lille’s introduction to hisDe fide catholicacontra hereticoswas also portraying the ‘heretics of our times’ as unified,drawing together different errors, where those heretics of the past had creatednew dogma from nothing:We read that formerly, in fact, various heretics at various times dreamed upvarious and contradictory dogmas, which we know were condemned by pub-lic edicts of the universal Church. In our times, however, new heretics – orshould we say old and inveterate heretics? – in the process of aging are draw-ing dogmas from various heresies and constructing them into one general her-esy: as it were, using many idols to construct one idol, many monsters toconstruct one monster. It is as though from many poisonous herbs they brewup one general poison.88177De heresi87Grundmann, ‘Typus’, p. 105.88‘Olim vero diversi haeretici diversis temporibus, diversa dogmata et adversa somniasseleguntur, quae generalis Ecclesiae publicis edictis damnata noscuntur: nostris verotemporibus, novi haeretici, imo veteres et inveterati, veterantes dogmata, ex diversishaeresibus, unam generalem haeresim compingunt, et quasi ex diversis idolis unumThis content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:29:28 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"This passage from Alain is directly comparable to Innocent’s imagery: bothportray modern heretics as united against the church, but Alain’s view differsin that it sees the various heretical groups as one doctrinally coherent entity, assingular in their nature, rather than in their position or purpose.Alain’s remarks here have been read as representative of an important stagein the development of the idea of heresy in the thirteenth century. MichelLauwers sees this passage, and Alain’s stance as a whole, as a departure from apreviously dominant patristic view of heresy, which saw it as a plural entitythat needed to be catalogued. Alain, in Lauwers’ view, made heresy singular, ageneral heresy of which individual heresies were part.89That is undoubtedlywhat Alain meant, and certainly there was at this time a shift to a view of con-temporary heresy that included more material drawn from recent experienceand literature, and that was moving away from the reliance on models of earlyheresy for details of doctrine and custom. How much Alain’s idea of a singularheresy is at work in our sources, however, is less certain.A more useful perspective, at least with regard to the mid thirteenthcentury texts, is to be found in Patschovsky’s view of this passage from theDefide. Patschovsky uses the above passage to illustrate what he sees as a stablepattern in the idea of heresy throughout these centuries: that, though theygave them different features, Catholic writers of this period viewed all formsof religious deviance as the same, characterized by the same things (idolatry,monstrosity, poison) – what he calls the ‘internal coherence of non-Catholicworld’.90We can see that principle at work in several of the texts that we haveused, either in description or in classification. Stephen of Bourbon and thePseudo-James Capelli both place heretics together with other groups externalto the Catholic faith, as the latter author has it, with Saracens and other men‘who are damned’ or ‘straying ... from the unity of the Catholic faith’.91Stephen’s stated aim at the beginning of hisDe heresisection is to ‘test andapprove our faith through comparison with other sects’ – a group thatincludes Saracens.92In the legal field, theLiber extraagain treats heresy in thesame context, locating it, as we saw, among sections concerning Jews, Saracensand Schismatics. The principle that Patschovsky sees in Alain’s text, that allenemies of the church can be considered as a whole, seems indeed to informthese examples. However, it is less easy to find references to the specific unity178Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Centuryidolum, ex diversis monstris unum monstrum; et quasi ex diversis venenatis herbis unumtoxicum commune conficiunt’;PL210, 307–8.89M.

For thelatter author, the lack of unity among heretics is a proof of their error. Incontrast to the integrity of the Catholic faith, which ‘is not divided, but one’,the number anddifferentiationof heretical sects is held up as a sign of theCatholic Church’s legitimacy: ‘there are more than seventy sects of heretics’.93The idea of division is here suggestive of unity in so far as the depiction of thatdivision as a flaw would imply a potential for unity, a view of heresy as onebig generic whole. The author later does just that, drawing directly on theimagery of Innocent’s bull to say that ‘thus heretics are divided among them-selves into sects, but in attacking the church, they are united’.94The duality of the idea of division and unity is visible again in a morecondensed expression in Stephen of Bourbon’s text: his statement that ‘amongthemselves they quarrel, and against us they all combine’, like the aboveexample from the Anonymous of Passau, is drawn from Innocent’s use of thatsame passage in Judges. Stephen goes further, to illustrate his point with anexemplumthat depicts a meeting of heretical delegations come together to settlean internal dispute. Portrayed in a deliberately ludicrous manner, each delega-tion tries to prove the veracity of their version of their heretical faith, eachrepeating the same assertions, each failing to reach an accord. The ‘man ofunderstanding’ from whom Stephen has this story assures him that many havecome back to the Catholic faith as a result of this dissension.95Later, he repeatsthis idea, saying that ‘they are joined or tied together in their posterior parts bytheir tails, because they are all intent on one thing, fighting the church, likeSamson’s foxes who had different faces but were tied by the tails’.96Stephenuses the image of the foxes as at once divided and united for polemical effect:the story of the arguing heretics he uses to prove that the Catholic faith is trueand that heresy is to be confounded, the true faith confirmed in the hearts ofthe faithful. The second example is the sixteenth item in Stephen’s list ofheretics’ evil qualities.97179De heresi93‘Non enim est divisa, sed una’; ‘haereticorum plus quam LXX sectae sunt’; Anonymous ofPassau, p. 263.

Andelements of Alain’s view of heresy can in fact be seen at work in our texts aspart of Patschovsky’s wider unity of enemies of the church and also, in places,as a body united against church. The unity that does exist among heretics isnot, however, specifically doctrinal in nature, as it is in Alain’s text, andwhether or not his view was, as Patschovsky suggests, representative of theonly or even the dominant view of heresy, at least in the mid thirteenthcentury, is less certain. In our sources, in fact, it seems not to be the case, fortwo main reasons: firstly, that where uniformity among heretics is a part of theconstruct it is as a result of something other than doctrinal unity; and,secondly, that plurality and division are equally if not more present in thetexts’ depiction and representation of their subject.Unity, or perhaps more correctly uniformity, is something that we haveencountered before in the constructs of heresy that our sources present, mostprominently in the texts designed for edification and in the anti-heretical legisla-tion of the first half of the century. In the edifying literature there is a samenessthat derives from the function of the heretics within that material. All the here-tics that appear in those hagiographical and exemplary texts are, with a fewexceptions, invariably portrayed in the same way: nameless, and doctrinallyindeterminate. They are all described in the same terms and serve the same func-tion, in the same way that the authors of our texts apply the different topoi of theanti-heretical tradition without regard for any differences between groups.In the legal material uniformity derives from a different cause. Previouslegislation by the 1163 council of Tours appears to have prefigured Alain’scomments to some degree, where it states that ‘from various parts they gatherin one den, pressed together, and having no cause to linger in the one dwellingexcept for a consensus of error’.98However, after Tours, a type of uniformityemerges in the representation of heresy by the church councils that is differentto that described by Alain, and in the next century, after the 1215 council, thereis nothing of that sentiment to be found. Instead, in a formulation that beginswith the decretalAd abolendam, heresy is unmistakeably plural, but for all thatis regarded as one in the eyes of the church, as a negative image. Though notimmediately influential in political or legal terms, this decretal was effective inshaping subsequent ideas of heresy.99Ad abolendam’s idea reached its mostcondensed and neat expression inVergentis in senium, as examined at thebeginning of this chapter.100With Innocent III’s fourth Lateran council heresybecame a firmly homogenous entity in as much as the canons of that councildefined heterodox opinion by opposition to a unified and closely delineated180Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century98‘De diversis partibus in unum latibulum crebro conveniunt et praeter consensum errorisnullam cohabitandi causam habentes in uno domicilio commorantur’; Fredericq, I, 39.99Maisonneuve,Études, p. 155.100X 5 7.10, Friedberg, II, 782.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:29:28 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Catholic doctrine, which effectively denied autonomy to the individual error;the unity of the faith excluded them all equally.In the regional councils, and within the higher levels of legislation as well, isanother level of uniformity, which applies to the grades of guilt assigned to theheretics and their different followers, and which therefore translates also intothe documents produced by the inquisition process. Each of the levels belowheretics proper can be applied as equally to a follower of the Cathars as to aWaldensian follower, and the only place in which any differentiation occurs isin the upper reaches, where doctrine and direct contact with belief are at work.Even there, once condemned, all heretics are essentially the same, a legal statusthat creates the otherwise undifferentiated mass that can be seen in the majorityof the legislation. Our previous examination of the regional councils made itclear that the heresy that they address is a previously defined and identifiedentity, that there is no engagement with the error and that they deal almostentirely with the treatment of heretics after conviction. The difference betweenAlain’s text and both general and regional councils is that where Alain’s same-ness derives from the heretics’ own agency, the Lateran canon and the councilsmake heresy uniform only by virtue of doctrinal or legal exclusion, and it is thislatter idea that is the more common in the texts of our period.Though different types of uniformity emerge, ultimately, in all of the exam-ples that we have looked at here, that uniformity would seem to arise from theremoval of error, not the amalgamation of it. What unity there is in oursources, in fact, applies to the common nature of figures and groups, while theunity of doctrine that Alain stresses is not present in any large way. The morecommon appearance of uniformity in the representation of heresy is less a partof an idea of heresy than of the church’s relationship to it; there is not so mucha unity of heresy as a homogeneity of heretics.Let us return then to the foxes, and look at the other side of that construct –namely, the degree to which heresy is represented in terms of plurality and ofdivision. The idea of division could be used in a polemical way, as we saw, injuxtaposition to the unity of the Catholic Church and as a clear mark of theheretics’ error. The examples looked at above have been used recently by PeterBiller to illustrate a widespread idea of sects as many and divided, betweeneach other and within themselves. That idea he sees as reinforced by the Scrip-tural foxes, but emanating ultimately from the use and diffusion of Isidore’sEtymologies. In the section on heresies theEtymologiespresents a proliferationof heretical sects, naming around seventy groups and providing for each one aderivation of the name, from either author or cause, along with a one-linedescription of the major error. Already a widely known text as a result of the‘swift and extensive’ diffusion of theEtymologies, the availability of the heresysection became even wider with its inclusion in theDecretum.101It is worth181De heresi101P.

He recounts information given to him by a heretic concerningthe heretics of Milan, who, according to Stephen’s source, number ‘seventysects, divided among themselves and against each other’. After listing severalof these, Stephen enjoins any reader that may want to learn more about theirdivisions and diversity to read Isidore’sEtymologies, since ‘one may find therethe names of a good sixty-seven or sixty-eight sects, which were before thesetimes’, and gives an exact reference to the extract’s location in theDecretum.105The Anonymous of Passau gives the same number for modern heretics, overseventy, that he later gives for the ancient sects on the basis of Isidore’s list.106The principle enshrined in that list can be seen working also in the Anony-mous of Passau’ later description of other sects, in which he uses this rule forderiving their names from their author or their cause.107None of these authors appear to see any great incongruity in using oradapting Isidore’s list of ancient heretical sects to include or describe those oftheir own time. In fact, some of our contemporary writers were aware of andmade reference to the disparity between what they saw of the heresy of their182Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century(Oxford, 1911), unpaginated.

Thoseauthors position their subjects firmly in the context of the presentation of theheretical past that they found in their source material – there were many, nowthere are few: ‘the sects of heretics were more than seventy, all of which by thegrace of God have been destroyed, apart from the sects of the Manichees, theArians, the Runcarii and the Leonists’.108The concern to contrast past timesstill contains a view of sects as several, and where Alain saw a break with thepast others appear to see a difference only of number. Some authors, asRaniero did above, mark a reduction in numbers, while for others the situationis becoming relatively worse: ‘Alas! that there should be so many heresies inthe church today’ laments the Novice in Caesarius’s collection ofexempla.109There is even an apocalyptic tone to the preface to theDisputatioin which theproliferation of heretics is a mark of the end of days and the Patarines are onlyone of many groups:As the world moves toward decline and dangerous times impend, whereinmany persons depart from the faith and form a sect of perdition, gathering fol-lowers who are itching to hear them, every faithful person – insofar as God al-locates to him a measure of faith – ought to rise up against those heretics whoare called Patarines.110Instead, there is a level of continuity between the inherited ideas of the here-sies of the past and the new heretics, who, according to the Pseudo-David,‘with the errors of ancient heretics they mix those of their own invention’.111As we saw, Stephen and Anselm use the Isidore extract as a list to be added to,a process that has elsewhere been described as ‘the yoking of experience withthe authority of written texts’.112The inherited models of heresy are notdiscarded, but neither are our authors dependent on them for their material.That independence can be seen not only in the models that our texts use butalso in the sources that they draw upon. Moneta draws a history of the Catharswithin a framework that juxtaposes the Catholic and Cathar ‘churches’ directly183De heresi108‘Sectae hereticorum fuerunt plures quam LXX quae omnes, per Dei gratiam deletae sunt,praeter sectas Manicheorum, Arianorum, Runcariorum et Leonistarum’; Anonymous ofPassau, p. 264.109‘Heu quod tot hodie haereses sunt in ecclesia’; Caesarius,Dialogus, p. 300.110‘Vergente ad occiduum mundoetinstantibus periculosis temporis, quibus multi discendentes afide configunt sibisectam perditionis, congregantes sibi discipulosprurientes auribus,unusquisque fidelis, prout divisit sibi dues mensuram fidei, in illos hereticos debetinsurgere, qui Patarini vocantur’;Disputatio, p. 3.111‘Antiquorum haereticorum errores suis adinventionibus miscuerunt’; Pseudo-David,Deinquisitione, col. 1779.

That origin he roots in the traditionsof Pagans, Jews and Christian apostates, putting together an unusual collec-tion of antique names, including Pythagoras and theSaducaei, as well as Mani,and portraying the Cathars as constructing a faith consciously from diverseelements of other error.113Mani remains as a feature of Cathar origins from theborrowed anti-Manichaean texts of Augustine, as had been the trend in theprevious century, but he is no longer alone, and the Isidorean author/heresymodel is rather lost in this collection of names.In fact, the obligation that Isidore’s text brought with it – that a sect shouldbe named for its author, or at least for its cause – had perhaps alwayspresented a problem for the historical view of heresy. Valdes is included in thepotted histories of the Waldensian sect, or his town of origin, Lyons, in thosetexts that call them Leonists, and the academic heresies such as those ofAmalric and Joachim, at the turn of the century, also have their authors andtheir correspondingly derived name. For Catharism, though, the idea of thegrand heresiarch has disappeared to some extent, although Mani is sometimesstill named. Aquinas still uses ‘Manicheans’ in a modern context to meanmodern dualists, in statements such as ‘this theory survives to this day amongheretics, the Manicheans for example’.114The difficulty for contemporaryauthors of finding an author for this particular group may in part account forthe adoption of the Manicheans, or the Patarines, as a model, or even for thecontinued application of the general term ‘heretics’.115In any case, Moneta isalone among the polemicists in trying to present a history of the sect, but thesame concern can be seen to operate in the inquisitors’ handbooks of Anselm,the Anonymous of Passau and the Pseudo-David. In none of these texts,though, do the authors rely any longer on that inherited tradition for informa-tion about the details of the error or the custom of the sect, and the historicallink to the antique past is sometimes included in such a way that it functionsalmost a topos in itself.116Similarly, the expectation that heresy should be plural, that there would beseveral sects, appears not to have been left behind, but to have remained andbeen adapted.Ad abolendam, as we saw, addressed ‘the depravity of variousheresies, which in many parts of the world in modern times has begun tospring up’, and this plurality can be seen at work throughout many of our184De heresi113‘Quod Ecclesia Romana a Christo velut capite sumpsit exordium, nunc unde CatharorumEcclesia originem duxerit ostendamus’; Moneta,Adversus catharos, p. 411.114‘Quidem opinio usque hodie apud haereticos manet, quorum Manichei’; Aquinas,SCGII.lxxxiii, [140]; trans.

The fourth of hisSummaeis moreconservatively aimed at the Patarines alone, but within the text it still regardsthe latter as one among several.118There is a tendency, then, in particular in the manual material, to regardand represent ‘heresy’ as plural and, as part of that plurality, to portray it interms of the mutual division that forms the other half of the fox imagery,sometimes in a semi-polemical fashion. Connected to this, to a greater or lesserdegree, is the representation of the internal divisions of the sects in question.Stephen of Bourbon’s description of the attempts made by the Lombard here-tics to convince each other of the legitimacy of their different opinions is a typi-cally entertaining and acute illustration of his argument, but it also appears torepresent a fairly realistic portrayal of the heresy of that region. Native SalvoBurci similarly describes the efforts of the various Cathar groups of the northof Italy to reconcile their differences and unite under a common faith, devotingmuch energy and expense, to no avail – proof, says Salvo, that ‘they are not thechurch of God’, quoting in support Luke’s gospel, that ‘every kingdomdivided against itself is brought to desolation’. Like Stephen, Salvo tells us thatthe scandal caused by these factions has caused many to turn from the heret-ical sects to the Roman church, and Salvo similarly uses this piece of informa-tion to invite criticism.119That internal division is, however, much more an integral part of Salvo’sconception of heresy in the rest of his text than it is for Stephen. Though notalways in a consistent pattern, Salvo’s text addresses, as well as theWaldensians, the errors of the Italian Cathars, dividing his treatment along thelines of their different factions according to what their individual peculiaritiesof belief might be and how that pertains to the point that he is trying to make.In fact, Biller sees this idea of division as potentially a more important formalidea than unity in the way that these texts construct heresy, and, as he pointsout, it functions as the organizing principle for many of Salvo’s compatriots.The most obvious examples of such organization are of course the twoItalian handbooks by Raniero Sacconi and Anselm of Alessandria. As we sawin an earlier chapter, the structure of Raniero’s text is based specifically uponthe differences between the Italian Cathar churches and includes a first sectionthat covers beliefs and practice held in common, followed by detailed chapterson the separate beliefs of each of the main factions.

The text openswith a description of the principle divisions in the heresy of the Cathars, and infact in its earlier parts it differentiates between absolute and moderateCatharism in the structure of its chapters. That structure falls away, butthroughout there are occasional remarks that indicate an awareness of thosedivisions on the part of the author and, to some extent, demonstrate a frame-work dependent on the division of the sect, so that ‘in this in fact they allagree’, that ‘others, dissenting from the aforesaid, believe’ something different,or that ‘opinions are diverse among them’.121It is possible to see many of theprincipal treatises of our period as being structured to a greater or lesserdegree around the internal divisions or differentiations of their subject.122Those internal differentiations run along purely doctrinal lines, as hasalready been described, a detail reinforced by the fact that, for each faction, thecustoms and rituals that are described are treated together and are for the mostpart common to all the different groups, as indeed are the hierarchical struc-tures. The division that we are dealing with here seems different from thatwhich was at work in the topos of division and unity as used in those textsexamined earlier. Of course, the level of detail is much greater, as would beexpected, but, more than that, it seems to be a matter for information only,drawn from experiential knowledge and observation. Division as a topos,however, is a two-sided thing, which deals with a plurality of sects and thedivision between them on the one hand, and on the other the relative unitybetween them when facing the Roman church. It is also often more explicitlyconcerned with the character of the heretics than with the basis of division.Where that former construct of division occurs it tends to be in texts that186Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century120Raniero Sacconi,Summa, pp. 47, 51, 48–9 (also the Waldenses on this basis, 59–60), 50–51;44, 47, 52, 58.121‘De divisione heresum catharorum qualiter, de principiis rerum inter se dissentientesgarriunt tractaturi’; ‘in hoc vero omnes consentiunt’; ‘alii autem dissentientes a predictiscredunt’; ‘diverse inter eos sunt opiniones’; Capelli,Adversus haereticos, pp. i, xxvii, xxxviii,xxviii.122Biller, ‘Goodbye to Waldensianism?’, p. 32.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:29:28 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"originate in the north of Italy. The prevalence of heresy in that region is almosta commonplace in non-Italian texts, in the writings of Stephen of Bourbon,noted above, of Jacques de Vitry and of the chronicler of the Franciscan Order,Jordan of Giano.123As the Novice comments to Caesarius in theDialogusmiraculorum, he has heard that there are many heretics in Lombardy, to whichthe monk replies, yes, no wonder, when they have teachers in every town, whoopenly read the Scriptures and perversely expound them.124Within the Italiantexts the complexity of that situation is fully revealed. Nearly all theSummaeauctoritatum, for example, derive from south France or north Spain and have,so far as it can be distinguished, a fairly undifferentiated picture. The only onefor which this is not true is theBrevis summula, the one among those texts thatis certainly Italian in origin, and which is, in part, quite consciously structuredin terms of division owing to its inclusion of a list that catalogues the differentarticles by Cathar group.The third part of Douais’ edition of theBrevis summula, which was repro-duced more frequently than the other parts of the work, represents this divi-sion in its list of the different Cathar errors by placing the letters A, B or Cbeside each article to indicate which of the groups adheres to each belief.125Allthis proceeds with no intrusion or comment from the author. Although theBrevis summulais a composite work the texts that the compiler chose to includein his Bible similarly define the Cathars and the divisions between the variousgroups in purely doctrinal terms; the Albigenses (sic), Bagnolenses andConcorrezenses are different from each other because they believe differentthings and because they have inherited their belief from different sources, theAlbigenses from ‘Brugutia’ (Drugunthia), and the latter two from ‘Sclavenia et... Bulgaria’.126While these Italian texts are immersed in an idea of heresy as an internallydivided entity, none, save Salvo, make a polemical point of this fact. It is diffi-cult to make a wide comparison on this point, as most of the texts in which thetopos or descriptions occur come either from one place or the other – there isvery little comparative polemic from France, for example – but the inquisitors’handbooks can be helpful here. Anselm and Raniero employ no invective onthe basis of division or, indeed, on very much at all, despite the fact that theirdescription of the Cathar churches places them on much firmer ground thanthe Anonymous of Passau’s account of the Waldensians, which includes noinformation on a trans-alpine schism in the movement, even the brief account187De heresi123Vitry,Historia occidentalis, ed.

The duality ofthe fox imagery represents quite neatly the different ideas of heresy at work,though they are not always at work in the same places. The unity of hereticsthat we saw in Alain’s work in fact is relatively uncommon in our texts.Though the idea is operating in the background in several places, and hereticsnot only appear to be regarded in a broad sense as a part of a wider evil but arealso represented as united against the church in the topos of the foxes, theunity that we see as part of that topos is not the unity of doctrine that Alaindescribes. Moreover, rather than moving away from their inherited views ofheretics and heretical sects, these authors, though using patristic material lessas a source for information, still use the ideas of heresy that they contain, butin a more independent way.Far more common in our sources, where there is uniformity, is an idea ofheretics as a homogenous mass precisely because connection with hereticaldoctrine has in one way or another been effectively removed from theconstruct of number. So, the heretics of theexemplacollections are largelyundifferentiated because their presence is, on the whole, subordinate to thenarrative structure of theexemplumin which they feature. Their presence inthose instances is dependent on their ability to function as a more or lessspecific evil, on their status as heretics, rather than on the root of that status. Ina similar way, in parts of the legal material, particularly the regional councilcanons and some of the inquisition documents, the fact that the hereticsmentioned were already labelled and convicted as such meant that their legalstatus as heretics made redundant any difference between them. In both casesit was the removal of error that allowed homogeneity, though in fact, in thecase of the legal material, doctrinal difference was ultimately rendered irrele-vant by the fourth Lateran council, whose opening creed made heresy uniformby exclusion. That homogeneity of different sects comes either as a result of thetightening of Catholic legislation or as the by-product of an ulterior didacticpurpose, but it does not exclude the actual plurality of sects, while the impor-tance of division in those texts that deal with error, most obviously thepolemics and the manuals, means that they do not present a singular vieweither. Plurality as a commonplace of the idea of heresy is not superseded, but188Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century127Anselm of Alessandria,Tractatus, pp. 323–4. The Anonymous of Passau nonethelessmentions connections with Lombardy: Anonymous of Passau, p. 266.128‘Hoc autem quidam dicunt tantum per bonos fieri, alii autem per omnes qui verbaconsecrationis sciunt’; Pseudo-David,De inquisitione, col. 1779.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:29:28 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"it is manipulated. Connected to the unity of the church as a mark of truth, divi-sion can function as a mark of error, but can also form part of the structure ofthe texts in question. Overall, it is this plural and divided image that is themore prevalent idea of heresy itself; homogeneity is more to do with the posi-tion of the church toward it. A deliberate part of the fox motif, all heresies wereunited against the church in a reinforcement of the doctrinal distinctness and,more important, the correctness of the Catholic Church through the enmity ofoutsiders.129At no point, though, did our texts take a view of heresy as singular. While itmay at times be homogenous, and in places said to be unified, underlying allthat is always a presupposition of plurality; certainly it was never doctrinallysingular. Even the fox topos, where mutual division functions as a mark oferror, relies on a basic view of heresy as plural. If anything, heresy couldperhaps be more plural in construction than it was in fact, through the use andadaptation of Isidore’s list of heresies. A generally plural view of heresy alsoinformed the role of division in the organization of the polemical texts and theinquisitors’ handbooks, where real, doctrinal divisions between a variety ofsects and among the factions of a sect – both Cathars and Waldensians – struc-tured the texts’ treatment of heresy.It will have become clear that the various parts of this idea of number arenot evenly spread across all our material. Internal division of the sect in ques-tion is central to and informs the structure of some of our texts – namely, theBrevis summula, two of four inquisition handbooks and the polemics, with theexception of theDisputatio, all of which are Italian texts. Our other sources, thelegal material, inquisition documents and most of the exemplary andhagiographical texts, treat any division as invective and heresy in general ashomogenous. Unlike the division of heresy presented by the former group,division as a flaw is to do with the characterization of heretics and not thedescription of the sect or the error. Where there is unity, or uniformity,whether it is rhetorical or legal, it is not connected to or describing hereticaldoctrine. The idea that heresy should be plural, though, appears to operatebehind all of the texts.The most immediate source of homogeneity, however, was what has beencalled by Markus, in the context of the early church, that ‘ancient but invet-erate habit of referring to [different sects and errors] by the blanket term“heresy”’.130In our period that habit is complicated by the fact that heresy andheretic are often used not only in a general way but also in specific reference,especially in the south of France, to the Cathars in particular. So far, though,we have considered ‘heresy’ to include whatever the sources label as such. For189De heresi129R. A.

However, that label ofheresy, and of heretic, has a general use as well and is applied throughout ourmaterial, whether in reference to a specific individual or error or to a morenebulous and incidental evil; it is to that general application that we look now,and to what consistencies or patterns there may be in the use of these mostbasic terms.Heresy and the HereticPaolini observed that an inquisitor’s job was twofold. Because heresypresented him with both a criminal act and the results of sin, his response wasconditioned as much by confessional practice as by legal principles.131Facedwith an individual guilty of heresy, the inquisitor saw different ideas of heresysimultaneously, overlapping in the same place. In fact, inquisitors spent agreat deal of energy in thinking about what heresy really was and whatdefined the boundaries between different classes of guilt, and sought andcollected information of this type wherever they could – they were interestedin thinking about what heresy was. The answer, to judge from the range oftexts and discussions generated in the middle years of the century, seems to bethat the idea of heresy with which they were engaging was made up of morethan one aspect, or at least more than one set of assumptions.There was a central idea of heresy, the dual formulation developed andpromoted by canon-legal theory and summed up by the 1242 council ofTarragona as ‘heretici sint qui in suo errore perdurant’. Though very brief, thisshort definition represents a crystallization of previous legal and theologicalideas of the heretic. The importance of textbooks in the spread of ideas, and inparticular of these central characteristics of heresy, is unmistakable. Thoseproducts of the ‘text-book movement’ of the high Middle Ages that rootedteaching and thought in common, inherited texts function much as the polem-ical texts did in the previous century, circulating and perpetuating a set oflanguage.132Between them, the Ordinary Gloss and theSentences, theDecretumand theLiber extra, provide a common base of reference for all our authors. Theprominence of the legal collections in particular was clearly one reason whyInnocent III’s contribution to the rhetorical construct of heresy looms large,and explains the wide-ranging influence of the language and imagery of thelegislation. In particular, it is the authorities that make up theDecretum’s190Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century131L.

The idea of hereticscontained within that quotation from Augustine must, by our period, havebecome firmly ingrained by virtue of its presence in both the standard legaland theological textbooks of the time.133This core principle remains stable,albeit refined and polished over time; the ways in which it is interpreted,however, vary according to circumstance and application. Overall, there aretwo broad frameworks for using the idea of heresy which understand thenature of the error being defended in different ways: either as a criminal actionor as a set of beliefs.The notion of heresy that permeates the practical legal sources for heresy –that is, the consultations, the depositions and sentences of inquisitions, andmuch of the material emanating from the lesser, regional councils – is one ofactions and of externally measurable qualities. A series of different grades ofguilt, ranging from believer to general supporter, they are all named anddefined in terms of the actions that they involve. ‘Heresy’ in this context refersto any involvement in the activities that constitute the crime of heresy, inessence a graduated scale of association with ‘heretics’. Within that scheme ofculpable actions the heretic takes on a pivotal role as the centre of the activitythat marked out the guilt of their followers; as the location of error. Thecredentesare, both in consultations and indeed in all the legal texts, believers of‘the errors of heretics’. It is this proximity to error that makes thecredensliableto be judged as a heretic, if it can be shown that their belief was accompaniedby a conscious choice and understanding. The precise nature of error itself is inthis context immaterial; its quality as error is what matters, and belief in it isthe culpable action.The continuing emphasis on knowledge, or rather on whether or not a deedis done knowingly, in any case suggests that intention is more significant inthis system than belief, and reflects the principal that heresy must be obstinate,must necessarily also be an erroneous act of will, a principle further defined bythe parallel with secular crime, particularly the crime of treason. Foulques’sdescription ofdefensoresdraws a careful distinction between the practicaldefence of another person – that is, the protection of heretics from the authori-ties – and the theoretical defence of error. It is only by the latter, deliberatedefence of error that heretics or heresiarchs are made, and for this reasonrelapses – that is, individuals who return to their belief or their behaviour afterhaving been warned and made aware of their error – are to be considered andjudged ‘as heretics’.134191De heresi133Lombard,SententiaeIV.xiii.2, Brady, II, 314–15.134Questions 9 and 12, Foulques,Consilium, pp. 196–7, 199–200.

Where the legal texts flatten error, make it homogenous by exclusion inorder to apply almost the same list of actions regardless of sect, the polemicsand manuals andSummae auctoritatumare careful to distinguish even the finestlines of distinction between the doctrines of different groups and the level ofdifferentiation between heresies.The main starting point for the first of those two ideas, the criminal or legalidea of heresy, is naturally the twenty-fourthcausaof theDecretum. The ques-tion begins with Augustine’s heretic, defined firmly in terms of obstinatebelief, but the authorities that Gratian then enumerates give greater weight toobstinacy as the principal identifier of a heretic, along with a more general lackof obedience to the authority of the church’s teaching and commands. The roleof obstinacy then comes to occupy the foreground even more in subsequentcommentaries. The thirteenth-century gloss to theDecretumemphasizes adistinction between heretic and non-heretic made on the grounds of obstinacy,and heretics are firmly those ‘who fall into error, and do not wish to becorrected’.135The concern that runs through the consultation and inquisitiontexts to establish intention on the part of the deponent, whether or not he orshe had any awareness of the heretical status of their actions, is a response tothe increasing importance of will and obedience in the contemporary readingof heresy, itself partly the result of the parallel development in canon law ofthe idea of culpability, in which guilt was seen to lie principally in the attitudeand will of the individual.136But while it reflects canon-legal thought of the period, the legal idea ofheresy is also shaped by the practical business of repression for which it isdesigned. At the most immediate level the purpose of repression was to limitand remove material manifestations of heresy and the influence of heretics.The method by which this was achieved, or attempted – that is, the systematicsublimation of the inner state into a series of categorizable actions – was theproduct of the process, of the texts and ideas surrounding inquisition. Thetendency of the legal material to construct heresy as homogenous can beexplained in part as necessary in the context of the tribunal, in order that thecriteria that define the crime be universally applicable.This criminal version of heresy is a self-perpetuating system generated by areflexive exchange between the legal consultations and textbooks on the one192Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century135‘Qui in errorem cadunt, nec volunt corrigi: sunt inter hereticos deputandi’; C.24 q.3 c.29,Friedberg, I, 998; GratianDecretum divi Gratiani ... cum variis scribentium Glossis(Lyons,1560), description col. 1403.136M.

It was a standard practice of inquisi-tion to produce question lists and formulas from pre-existing models, and thefocus on actions produces interrogation questions that demand information onthe facts and figures of heretical behaviour, though it is also fair to say that theneed for such information in turn reinforces the focus on actions. The pointhere is that the system of proofs is established and reinforced within thecontext of repression built from the interaction of legislation and inquisitiontexts.Augustine’s definition is equally present in the theological idea of heresydeveloped in the dialectical texts and parts of the inquisitors’ handbooks, buthere it is the belief element that is given emphasis and significance. This is atleast in part due to the trends in theological understanding of heresy, definedat the broadest level by the papal policy outlined in particular by Innocent IIIand the fourth Lateran council, which defined heresy in terms of doctrine anddoctrine in terms of articles of faith, but it was further refined by academicdiscussion of the problem. Peter Lombard’s reading of heresy, taken up bytheologians, gives the central role to doctrine and interpretation, an emphasisthat we have seen dominate the polemical response in this period and definethe terms of debate as visible in those texts and in theSummae auctoritatum. So,while the Pseudo-James Capelli still characterizes his opponents in terms oftheir obduracy in the face of proofs both ecclesiastical and divine, his principalresponse to the heretics is in terms of their error, as defined in direct contrast tospecific articles of faith: ‘it is therefore clear that Jesus Christ assumed fleshand all who deny it are heretics and seducers’, and ‘all who prohibit marriageare divided from the faith’.137Heresy is not only doctrinal in the polemics and theSummae; it is also intel-lectually driven and expressed. While the scholastic method with which ourpolemicists engage with their subject in itself constructs that subject as adoctrinal phenomenon, that construct appears to derive equally as much fromthe sources used by the polemics and varioussummae. Beneath the systematicrefutations of the polemics lie the original source materials, as it were, theheretical texts that our authors tell us consistently that they are using andwhich their method would betray even if they did not. Drawn from hereticaltexts, as well as from debate and conversation with heretics, the heresy thatthese texts refer to, the system of thought, is apparently not of the texts’making, but of their sources’. Like the legal idea of heresy, the practical appli-cation of these texts, or the manner of their interaction with heresy or heretics,193De heresi137‘Patet igitur quod ihesus christus carnem assumpsit et omnes qui negant heretici sunt etseductores’; ‘ergo omnes qui prohibent nubere a fide divisi sunt’; Capelli,Adversushaereticos, pp. cxxiii, cxxx, cxxi, clxxvi.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:29:28 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"affects the content and shape of the idea of heresy they express. Where theapplication of a legal idea demands that it be self-generating and closed, thenature of those texts that deal in a more theological view makes room for vari-ation and a more porous relationship with their subject. These texts, which arelargely built within frameworks of exchange and debate, and which seem inplaces to be as much designed for verbal exchange as they are reproductions ofit, are interested in belief and in engaging with it on a theological level, andthis makes the idea of heresy that they contain more open to external sources.It is significant that most of the sources that deal with heresy in a more dialec-tical manner come out of a northern Italian context, a place where thattwo-pronged attack on heresy, through debate and preaching as well asthrough repression, would be necessary owing to difficulties of conductinginquisitions within this region.It is in part the connection with function that drives the changes that can beseen over time. The term ‘heresy’ had carried with it that sense of unorthodoxthought or belief which also informs the legal definition at least since the timeof the early church, but within this use there were nonetheless differences inthe extent to which that error was presented as theological or doctrinal innature, or in the level of emphasis given to that doctrinal nature. That is to say,the degree to which heresy was perceived as a predominantly doctrinalphenomenon varied over time. In our period there are signs of an upswing inthis perception, in line in fact with wider developments which underlie thenotably doctrinal representation in our non-legal texts.At the opening of the thirteenth century growing concerns over the connec-tions between speculative philosophy and heresy had led the University ofParis to prohibit, in 1210, the use of Aristotle’s natural works. It was similarlyPeter the Chanter’s belief that rash questions and the introduction of logicalmethod into the study of theology would result in heresy.138The associationbetween heresy and incautious intellectual inquiry continues in some places inour sources. In the earlier work of Caesarius of Heisterbach the monk warnshis novice of precisely those dangers of intellectual curiosity in recounting thestory of those heretics who provoked the Paris ban on Aristotle, theAmalricians. Less specific, but equally telling, is Caesarius’s description of thelearning of heretics in terms that suggest disputative behaviour and scholasticlearning: of the prevalence of heretics in Lombardy he says ‘they have theirown masters in various cities, publicly reading [= lecturing upon] the scrip-tures and expounding them perversely’. A group of Catholic theologians go tovisit the ‘schools of a certain heresiarch’.139The connection can also be found in194Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century138J. W.

EvenMoneta of Cremona has enough reservations about some points of Aristotelianthought to include a short section on the errors they contain at the end of hisanti-heretical treatise. However, the new wave of scholars at Paris, uncon-nected with the previously dominant circle of Peter the Chanter, began duringthe first decades of the thirteenth century to move towards a view of heresy,and of the response of the church to it, that led William of Auxerre to advocatethe use of dialectic specifically to combat heresy.140The establishment of theUniversity of Toulouse was similarly intended to combat the problem ofheresy on an intellectual level.141The significance of this generally literate and dialectic approach in a morenarrowly defined anti-heretical context becomes clear when our polemicaltexts are considered next to those of the preceding period. The Catholicresponse to heresy moves away from what Iogna-Prat describes as the charac-teristically monastic, imprecatory approach of the twelfth century, in whichthe usual method had been to attack the heretics themselves, particularly onthe basis of moral condition and personality, rather than to address the error inmuch detail at all.142By the mid thirteenth century this approach has beenabandoned, and the idea of heretics asillitteratino longer seems to have anycurrency in the new polemic, where the discussion of interpretative error hastaken the place of invective and more rhetorical constructs as the location ofthe polemical attack. More than this, heresy has come to be constructed as, andindeed received as, a coherent and systematic doctrine.While the thirteenth-century polemics stand in contrast to their predeces-sors, this is in part because the heresy to which they were responding alsostood in contrast to that which had gone before; error, or doctrine, was muchless central to the anti-establishment heresies of the twelfth century.143Hereticsof the mid thirteenth century, though, particularly the Cathars, were increas-ingly literate and were, moreover, entirely capable of using and producingacademic texts. We can see heretics employing academic texts in variousplaces – there is use of theDecretumand of the Ordinary Gloss by the Catharsin theDisputatio, for example, and use of theDecretumagain by theWaldensians in the Pseudo-David of Augsburg.144Aquinas sees no difficulty195De heresi140Baldwin,Masters, Princes, and Merchants, I, 107, Biller, ‘Northern Cathars’, p. 27.141Baldwin,Masters, Princes, and Merchants, I, 116.142On the approach taken by theContra Petrobrusianossee above, p. 20 and n. 32.143J.

Throughout most ofour material this is achieved simply through the use of titles such asmagister,with connotations ranging from teacher to master of the schools. Mostconvincing in this regard, though, is the presence that permeates theexemplacollections, the Dominican literature and the inquisition registers. Here, notonly are the heretics depicted frequently in debate – indeed, the heretics thatappear in theLivesof St Dominic and Peter Martyr do so almost exclusively inthat context – but there is also a consistent proximity to and use of books onthe part of the heretical élite in a way that recalls Stock’s model of a textualcommunity. Though only a few originals survive today, the one-time existenceof other books of heretical doctrine can be understood from the numerousreferences made to them by Catholic authors. The work of Bernard Hamilton,among others, has demonstrated from the books that do survive that theycontain what can be considered to be a coherent belief system.146In terms ofour texts, these books can be seen to contain a discussion of doctrine thatrequires the same in return. In fact, the codification and the progressively moreintellectual nature of heresy, and the development of sharply defined, arti-cle-based Catholic doctrine, can be read as resulting, in part, from the interac-tion between the two systems.147It seems reasonable to assume that theprocesses that lay behind the development of Catholic doctrine in the newcreed – the expansion of the schools and of speculative thought and, withinthat expansion, the increasing role of precisely those disputative tendenciesthat appear so prevalent among the heretics – were also responsible for theincreasingly theological character of heresy. The impulse to treat heresy as anintellectual phenomenon and its repression as an intellectual exercise stemsfrom a wider development of scholastic thought and practice, but that trend atthe same time accounts for the character of the heretical texts themselves.196Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Centuryhowever, according to the arguments of Sarah Hamilton, visible elsewhere in the text; S.Hamilton, ‘The Virgin Mary in Cathar Thought’,JEH56 (2005), 24–49 (pp. 39–41, 48).Pseudo-David,De inquisitione, col. 1780.

A similar mechanism can be seen at work beneath the ways in whichsome of the texts talk about heretics, as distinct from ideas about heresy. Interms of both crime and belief system, the constructs of ‘heresy’ are to somedegree independent of the figure of the heretic, generated and perpetuated asthey are within and between texts. But the heretic is itself another facet to theidea of heresy underlying the texts, and ‘heretic’ has a broader meaning thansimply a carrier for either legal or theological ideas about heresy, though itdoes serve that function. Straightforwardly, the heretic appears as a figure, amatter of fact presence in the texts. There is a range of focus or closeness thatderives from the level of interest the text has in real individuals. In the polem-ical treatises and theSummae auctoritatum, where a ‘heretic’ appears it is as amuch-reduced figure with little function beyond a token holder of the errorunder discussion, able to stand proxy for any opponent, whether written orencountered. At the other end of the scale, the legal texts and the records ofinquisition appear to present a more concrete version of the figure, not least asa result of the greater number of ‘real-life’ heretics they include.The representation used by the edifying literature suggests a similar back-ground hum of heretical presence to that which also comes through in theinquisition depositions about the movements and networks of heretics. It is thefamiliarity that is generated by that presence that makes heretics so useful tothe preacher. The defective moral condition of a figure which would have beenrecognizable to most of the preacher’s audience makes the heretic a perfectvehicle for the moral of anexemplumor of an edifying tale of mendicanttriumphs over evil.However, the presence of heretics as a part of the contemporary fabric ofsocial reality that allows such illustrative use also goes some way to explainthe more constructed manner in which they appear in theexemplaand thehagiography, which place them most often in a context of argument anddebate. The competition that they present to the legitimacy and mandate of themendicant orders, and the Dominicans in particular, predicated as it is on thetrue performance of thevita apostolica, defines the manner in which the textsrespond. The heretic is therefore still defined by association with error – thehereticito whom Peter Martyr is related, his uncle and father, are those whotry, ‘per auctoritates’, to prove heretical doctrine – but the error itself is adum-brated, and almost never related in detail.148Instead, looking at thelegendaeofSt Dominic, most of the time heretics are distinguished primarily by falseappearance. It is their moral condition and personal qualities that are at issuehere. Stephen of Bourbon’s long list of heretical qualities has almost nothing to197De heresi148Vitae fratrum, p. 236.This content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:29:28 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"say about their erroneous beliefs, describing aspects of the heretic that are notdirectly to do with the heresy itself: cunning, secrecy, deception. The elementsof a topos, now for this reason strongly geared towards false appearance as itscore theme, adhere to and construct the heretic. The threat of a rival focus forveneration, based on shared characteristics of holiness and erudition, meansthat in a mendicant-dominated idiom heretics are written as outsiders on thebasis of falseness, generating the rhetorical construction of heresy and espe-cially heretics in this period. This construct, though, remains largely inde-pendent of discussion of error.The heretic is one more way of talking about heresy, but, much as the theo-logical idea is concerned to challenge a heresy based on shared methods andtexts, the construction of the heretic is also about the struggle to control andfully inhabit contemporary markers of legitimacy. If, as Stock suggests, it ispossible to see what was understood by heresy through the means that wereconsidered effective to combat it, then the different approaches taken acrossthe range of mid-century texts suggest that there was more than one aspect tothis view, and that heresy was not seen as a fixed and monolithic creature.149Renato Rosaldo’s criticism ofMontaillouis directed principally at Ladurie’suncritical use of anthropological methods in his reading of Fournier’s regis-ters. But he also saw that, in failing to question the relationship of the depo-nent to his interrogator more closely – ‘how can his data (“the direct testimonyof the peasants themselves”) have remained untainted by the context of domi-nation (“the Inquisitor’s register”)?’ – Ladurie had ‘neatly liberated the docu-ment from the historical context that produced it.’150There is little risk of thisapproach being replicated now, in an historiographical environment in whichtext-critical, deconstructive readings are the norm, except that the concern toisolate and remove what is constructed, and the tendency to read the texts onlyfor the agenda of those writing them, seems in places to be in danger ofextending a similar distortion in the other direction, assuming a text manufac-tured within a closed and self-referential system, sometimes deliberately so.But a reading that sees the heresy represented in the Catholic tradition asentirely and deliberately constructed has to deny the range and variety of thesurviving corpus of material in order to do so. The various texts may beresponding to a central set of ideas, but the shared notions of heresy are madeup of a wide range of different parts and the elements of tradition and theaspects of the idea of heresy that an author deploys depends on the function ofhis text. That is, the construction of heresy is determined more by the purpose198Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century149B.

The patterns of construction them-selves reveal a great deal of interaction and exchange between the texts, notonly within their own generic group, but often across the fluid and shiftingboundaries between those groups. Nowhere is that clearer than in the inquisi-tors’ handbooks. Both doctrinal and legal ideas are present at the vanguard ofrepression of heresy, in the minds of the inquisitors, and are represented inequal measure by the handbooks, even though the formula of inquisitionneither provided for nor required the gathering of the detailed information oferror that they contain. Interrogatories approach the subject from a position ofknowledge, not of enquiry. Nevertheless, we have seen that detailed informa-tion about error was sought by inquisitors from heretical writings or fromconversations beyond the tribunal with imprisoned or post-conversion here-tics. Inquisitors’ manuals, handbooks and the collections of texts that theyused contain samples of nearly all our material; not only formulae and consul-tations that inform the inquisitor about the application of the series of markersof guilt that make up the crime of heresy, but also detailed information on theerrors and customs of the different sects, even the different factions of eachsect. Over time, and especially in the fourteenth century, differentiation anddiscussion of error would come to feature with increasingly frequency in theinterrogations of inquisitors.All of which suggests that we ought to be wary of looking for one view ofheresy that proceeds from one approach or plan. If there is more than one partto the idea of heresy, and the writers who talk about it are able to use andadapt different elements as needed, then to read an overarching agendaignores that variety while at the same time ascribing to Catholicism a unityand homogeneity that it cannot reasonably be said to have had. Even wherethat extreme interpretation is avoided the lack of comparison between types ofwriting leaves many of these accounts incomplete and privileges one agendaor reading. It also gives the impression that texts must belong to the ideas ofone societal or institutional group or another regardless of the fact that oftentheir authors belonged to and identified with several. The authors, many ofwhom fulfilled simultaneous functions, happily accommodate and shiftbetween the different ideas. Stephen of Bourbon moves comfortably betweenhomiletic, inquisitorial and polemical registers depending on what he wantshis text to do, and chooses the elements that fit according to his purpose – hesees no contradiction between a detailed discussion of sectarian doctrinalerrors and an undifferentiated heretic who provides a foil for his story.If the broad view afforded by a comparison of sources allows us to see thatthere was more than one construction at work, though they were connectedthrough fluid generic boundaries, then it also shows us that these were neitherstatic constructs nor static texts, not in the topoi they used and not in their useof inherited material. What is apparent is a layering of the construction, both interms of different types and motifs as well as the mixture of inherited ideas199De heresiThis content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:29:28 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"with new material from other texts, Catholic or heretical, and from materialbased in experience and observation of the contemporary people and move-ments the church labelled as heretical. Awareness of the traditional sourcesand rhetorical characteristics of these texts should not lead one towardsepistemological pessimism. Our texts not only rely on a shared comprehensionof the rhetorical and figurative mechanisms at work, but also on a commonunderstanding of the reality of heresy, of the backgroundness of heretics, ofwhatmos hereticorummeant. The large idea or concept of heresy that theyembodied was a varied one, built from parts drawn from both tradition andexperience. Ultimately, the balance of those parts, and the role that they cameto play within the texts and the idea as a whole, was determined by their inter-action with each other and with their context. If whistling to catch birds was asimile of deception, it was at the same time a real component of one Domini-can’s view of real contemporary preachers.200Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth CenturyThis content downloaded from 128.197.26.12 on Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:29:28 UTCAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"AppendixPerfectias a term to denote hereticsAlthough Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay’s chronicle famously referred to theCathar élite asperfectiat the opening of the Albigensian Crusade, the use of thetermheretici perfectiis in fact extremely rare in the records of inquisitions. TheTuscan formulary very occasionally usesperfectus. Peter Cellan also uses it, butrarely – only for female full Cathars, and then only in a minority of cases. A1256 deposition by William Fournier of Toulouse, quoted by Belhomme, givesanother example: ‘the witness was and remains ahereticus indutus et perfectus’.However, Fournier’s testimony is one of only a few examples that Arno Borstis able to give in his own footnote on this term, despite his extensive knowl-edge of inquisition material.1In fact, two very large collections of depositions,those before Renous of Plassac and Pons of Parnac in 1272–8 in Doat volumes25 and 26, and the register of Toulouse MS 609, which between them cover awide span of the mid thirteenth century and contain references to a hugenumber ofheretici, offer not a single instance in which those heretics aredescribed asperfecti.2For the general reader, then, the widespread habit among modern histo-rians of heresy of using ‘Perfect/Perfects’ as a noun to denote Cathar hereticscreates an impression that is at odds with the infrequency with which it wasused.3More, it conjures the modern sense of the word, of ‘perfect’ as ‘bestpossible’, ‘flawless’ or ‘ideal’. High medieval usage ofperfectus, though, wouldsuggest that it was principally read and understood by readers and writers ofLatin in this period in a different sense, as the past participle ofperficere,tofinish or complete, and was used in phrases likeopus perfectum, a completedwork. In the context of a person who wasperfectus, something like ‘fully2011Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay,Hystoria albigensis, ed. P. Guébin and E. Lyon, I, 13.

In that sense of initiation it corresponds moreclearly with the more commonly used ‘vested’ or ‘consoled’ heretics. Theclearest example of this non-sect specific usage comes later than our period, inthe fourth part of Bernard Gui’sPractica, where with customary clarity hedistinguishesperfectiandimperfectialong these lines – theimperfectihere arethecredentes.4In our period something similar can be seen in the Pseudo-David’s use ofperfectito describe the Waldensian élite: ‘some are calledperfecti,and these are properly calledPoure Valdenses de Lyon’. Stephen of Bourbonagain appears to use the term to describe Waldensian heretics, as doesTarragona glossingperfecti hereticias ‘Insabbatati, or dogmatizers of theirerrors, or believers who have relapsed into [heretical] belief after havingabjured or renounced heresy’. Humbert of Romans also uses the term in anapparently non-specific way.5Overall, what emerges from the mid thirteenthcentury material is a relatively infrequent use ofperfectito describe heretics,and a meaning, where it is used, that is probably nearer to that put forward byGui – that is, not with reference to a particular group, but to heretics withinany group who are fully fledged via the relevant ritual and who are, as it were,the clergy of that particular sect.Appendix2024Bernard Gui,Practica inquisitionis heretice pravitatis, ed.

In recent years historians have developed increasingly sophisticated methodologies to illuminate the tangled layers from which the texts that describe heresy are built, but in the process have made the reading of heresy fractured and disconnected. Heresy and Heretics seeks to redress this by reading the different types of anti-heretical writing as part of a wider connected tradition, considering all the principal orthodox treatments of heresy. Set down in the mid-thirteenth century, a time when both medieval heresy and the church’s response to it were at their zenith, the material ranges from the theological arguments of some of the greatest thinkers of the age to the homely sermons of wandering preachers. In considering the whole scope of anti-heretical writing from this period, it becomes apparent that far from being an artificial construct isolated from reality, the church’s treatment of heresy had a much more complex relationship with its subject matter.Dr Lucy Sackville is Junior Research Fellow at Exeter College, Oxford.Cover: Codex Vindobonensis 2554, fol. 62v., Judges 15.
