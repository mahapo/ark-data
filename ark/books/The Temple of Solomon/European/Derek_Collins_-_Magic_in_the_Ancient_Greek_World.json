Thepresent study seeks to contribute to the discussion in a way that is bothaccessible to non-specialists and challenging to specialists. Thus my aimin writing this book is twofold: first, it seeks to introduce non-specialiststo areas of Greek magic with which they may not be familiar, and to con-vey an appreciation for its conceptual and practical complexity; second,each chapter aims to cover both the high points of scholarly consensusand to offer new interpretive frameworks for understanding select Greekmagical practices. Not every type of Greek magic is treated – notably,amulets, although the study of amulets could be assimilated easily to oneor another of the interpretive frameworks offered here. Nor are literary depictions of magical activity treated here in any great depth. Be that asit may, each chapter is meant to be readable and engaging – hence I haveminimized the use of Greek and Latin and either translated or providedtranslations of all texts – and at the same time each chapter ventilates adefinite argument for interpretation.One of the longest-running debates in anthropology and the history ofmagic concerns the definition of ‘magic’ itself. Despite the lively and attimes brilliant contributions to this debate, it will become evident alreadyin the first chapter of this book that I think that debate is largely irrele-vant, at least to the extent that it focuses on defining the meaning of themodern term ‘magic’, whether it be in opposition to science, technology,religion, or some other term. Ancient Greek terms for ‘magic’, including9781405132381_1_pre.qxd 30/10/2007 12:10 Page xi"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xiiIntroductionGreek μiγοςand the Latin terms magus, magicus, from which our modern term ‘magic’ itself derives, do have an interesting and culturallydiverse history, which we will examine in some depth. But as I hope toestablish early on, a focus on particular historically attested practices is amore productive way to explore ancient behavior, and doing so often drawsinto question what to earlier generations of scholars had seemed clearlyto be, for instance, either magic or religion. From the point of view of thisbook, such a distinction is largely effete.The heart of this book contains five chapters that consider the method-ological approaches to magic in anthropology; the development of Greekmagic in the classical period; binding magic, curse tablets, and erotic spells,including the use of figurines; incantations derived from Homeric poetryin late antiquity; and the long history of Greek and Roman legislation againstmagic reaching into the early Middle Ages. A treatment of Roman laws onmagic may seem out of place in a book on Greek magic, except that theRomans inherited most forms of Greek magic and in their laws continuedto seek Greek precedents to refine Roman magical terms. On more thanone occasion in this book we will extend our study into the medieval period– naturally, because Roman law served as the basis for prosecuting magicin the Middle Ages, and the practices that were prohibited more often thannot were essentially Greek in character. More rarely, we shall make excur-sions into the early modern period, if only to highlight the commandingplace which Greek, and subsequently Roman, magical concepts andpractices held for later Europeans.In chapter 1, I offer a history of anthropological theories of magical beha-vior, from the nineteenth to the twentieth centuries, which derive for themost part from studies of non-Greek cultures. This chapter is required read-ing in order to make sense of my interpretations of the Greek material.Rather than a mere survey of anthropological approaches to magic,instead I outline key concepts of sympathy, analogy, agency, causality, and participation which inform my analyses of particular Greek magicalpractices. At the same time, by tracing the main approaches to magic in anthropology, I show where false steps were made and where under-lying assumptions misled scholars to ask the wrong kinds of questions about magic. Every reader of this book will bring assumptions to the tableabout what magic means – and many of these I hope to explode in chap-ter 1 with the help of anthropology, starting with the nature of belief inmagic itself.In chapter 2, I outline a framework for understanding ancient Greekmagic. Here we explore the development of Greek concepts of magic inthe fifth and fourth centuries bce, and their underlying basis in causal rela-tionships between the mortal and divine worlds. Next I briefly survey the9781405132381_1_pre.qxd 30/10/2007 12:10 Page xii"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Introductionxiiiindividuals most associated with magical practice, from Persian priests toitinerant ritual specialists for hire, and finally review the most commonmagical practices associated with these individuals. New arguments areadvanced that Gorgias, who is the first to use the Greek term mageia, under-stood ‘magic’ to be essentially purificatory in character, in line withEmpedocles and the Hippocratic physicians. Moreover, I argue that theHippocratic author of On the Sacred Disease, who offers the most stridentattack against ‘magicians’, misunderstood the relationship between his ownsubject matter, epilepsy, and magic. Instead, I demonstrate that epilepsycould be caused by magical binding, making the remedies offered by thenotorious itinerant specialists peculiarly apt.In chapter 3, I survey the varieties of binding magic, with a particulareye toward its development in curse tablets or defixiones, and eroticmagic and figurines. Binding the gods in Greek myth is offered as a par-allel to human binding, and the argument is made that binding producesa disability in its victim which inverts Greek notions of physical health.The accumulation of body parts in curse tablets is contrasted with the sin-gling out of body parts in the Greek and Roman practice of manufactur-ing terracotta votives, which were deposited in temples and other sacredsites. Both practices incorporate an extensible notion of the body, whichcan be collapsed or distributed in time and space as needed. Examples ofbinding magic used in erotic spells are then discussed, which leads to atreatment of figurines in Greek magic generally, and in erotic magic in par-ticular. I argue that magical figurines have to be situated within a broaderunderstanding of Greek attitudes toward statuary – since figurines are tinystatues – that view them as social agents which exhibit some, but not all,human attributes. A discussion of Greek and Greco-Egyptian examples ofanimating Eros figurines to attract a beloved, with some attention paid tothe theurgic animation of figurines within Neoplatonism, serves as amodel of social agency and concludes the chapter.In chapter 4, I explore the late antique phenomenon of using Homericverses as incantations. Incantations (epDidai) have a long history in Greekmagic, starting with references to their use within Homeric poetry itself.But between the first and fourth centuries cein Greco-Roman Egypt wefind that individual verses are used, sometimes by themselves, some-times with accompanying rituals, to heal specific ailments or to engenderspecific changes in their users. The principles by which verses wereselected and why are exposed, and attention is given to both prevailingmedical and popularly understood theories of ailment to illustrate why certain verses were chosen over others. The practice of using Homeric verses for incantations is then situated within late antique Neoplatonismand theurgy, which I argue provides the most cogent rationale for why9781405132381_1_pre.qxd 30/10/2007 12:10 Page xiii"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xivIntroductionHomeric poetry, and not the poetry of other prominent Greek (or Roman)poets, became the exemplary source for incantations.In chapter 5, I explore the history of Greek and Roman legislationagainst magic. This chapter is the most extensive chronologically, begin-ning with Greek and especially Athenian laws against poisoning andmagic as we can reconstruct them from real and hypothetical cases, andas they were envisioned in Plato’s ideal republic. From here we move toa consideration of the Roman Twelve Tables and especially to theCornelian law on assassins and poisoners as enacted by Sulla in 81 bce.This law casts a disconcertingly long shadow over later Roman legislationagainst magic well into the sixth century ce. I examine several criminalcases for magic that were tried under the Cornelian law, with an in-depthexamination of the trial of Apuleius of Madaura in 158/9 ce– a case thatcontinued to puzzle commentators well into the sixteenth century, as itdoes to this day. We end with a review of fifth- and sixth-century legal posi-tions taken with regard to magic in the Theodosian Codeand Justinian’sDigest, respectively, with a view toward the impact of the Digeston con-tinental European legislation against magic in the Middle Ages.Long introductions bore me to tears, and continuing further wouldtend to spoil the pleasure of discovery that I hope this book holds. A shortconclusion at the end of each chapter summarizes the main points, andthe book concludes with a brief, overarching summary in chapter 6 thatoffers some methodological considerations for future research.9781405132381_1_pre.qxd 30/10/2007 12:10 Page xiv"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1Magic: What Is It and HowDoes It Work?1212121The two questions in the chapter title above are perhaps the most com-mon ones asked by students of the history of magic. They are alsoarguably the two most difficult questions to answer, although I would venture to suggest that the first is easier to answer than the second. Thisis the case because in any given culture at any given time there is often aloose, notional consensus about what magic is, as well as who practicesit. In the history of magic from Greek and Roman antiquity to the earlyMiddle Ages, there were crucial shifts in the understanding of how magicworked, which ultimately resulted in the bifurcation of magic into a natural and demonic counterpart.1These were the only two available theories of magical operation from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance,according to which magical properties were either inherent in naturalobjects, such as gems and plants, or magic was accomplished through theintercession of demons.2But these theories were formulated by ChurchFathers and theologians, as well as the occasional late antique dabbler, whowere largely outside the mainstream practice of magic. If one were in theposition to query magical practitioners themselves about how theirmagic worked, on the evidence of Greek antiquity alone I doubt there wouldhave been much consensus. In fact, I am certain that all but a few magicalpractitioners would have been dumbfounded by such a question. Suchthings were understood, and the written record with rare exceptions leavesvirtually no trace of any discussion by magical practitioners themselvesof how magic worked. What was discussed openly were the claims madeby certain magical practitioners about what problems they were capableof solving. What was not open to question, and therefore prompted no discussion, was a world view in which magic, even if disproved in the caseof a particular individual, remained possible.9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 1"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"2Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?To understand what magic is and how it worked in Greece thereforerequires us to extend our inquiry beyond the ancient written and mater-ial record and to incorporate other models of behavior, derived prin-cipally from perhaps the most productive academic field in magic,anthropology, because the material record is insufficient in itself. It is impor-tant to recognize that our understanding of ancient magic begins, but doesnot end, with the close examination of texts and objects. Yet magic also incorporated ritual behavior, which is all too often not directlydescribed for us. However, it would severely understate the fullness of a magical event if no attempt were made to situate a magical object in its performative context, or a plausible ritual context derived fromcomparative evidence. I propose to approach these problems in an un-orthodox way. Rather than rehearsing every theory of magic available inantiquity and those offered by anthropologists, instead I want to empha-size those approaches that help us to understand magic in particularinstances. Some general characterizations are inevitable. But simply put,there is no one way to understand all magic across all instances even for one culture at one historical moment. Magic is a busy intersection, toborrow from a classic anthropological statement about ritual, and as suchthere are always different religious, social, cultural, and performativeroutes that have to be pursued in explaining it. We shall have manyopportunities in what follows to observe cross-currents of ancient cultureconverging in the practice of magic.Before we can define ancient Greek magic, let us begin the discussionby assuming that one does not believe it exists or that is has ever existed.Why any person with a nasty fishbone stuck in his throat, possibly gasp-ing for air, would believe that by virtue of saying a verse of poetry the bonewould come out makes no sense. Why anyone would mold a figurine outof clay or wax and stick needles into its eyes, mouth, and breast – as a meansto attract, but not permanently harm, a beloved – should, one would think,be consigned to the trash bin of superstition. Everyone curses and somecurse with art, but why anyone would take the time to write out a curseformula invoking underworld deities on a thin sheet of lead, roll it up andpierce it with a nail, then bury it in the tomb of an unknown dead personreaches the height of absurdity. Illness, disease, and bodily injury from acci-dents are common enough features of life. But why someone would fash-ion an amulet from haematite or bronze, etch it with a rider on horsebackspearing creatures like lions and scorpions or a prostrate demon, then wearthis around his neck seems at best only indirectly to treat the ailment. Itmight be artfully crafted, but how could such an object possibly preventharm? It takes no imagination to suppose that headaches were as frequentin antiquity as they are today, yet why someone would invest their time9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 2"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?3acquiring a charm written on papyrus that quite literally commands theheadache to leave, as if the headache could hear, defies rational explana-tion. All of these examples were easily recognized in antiquity as magic.Different explanations would certainly have been given as to whether anyof these procedures was effective – indeed some would have been dismissedout of hand as superstition – and questions would have been asked aboutthe ultimate purveyor of each magical aid. But there would have been general agreement that each procedure fell outside the realm of officiallysanctioned cult activity, possibly had the taint of being illicit, and was certainly less than dignified, which were several criteria by which ancientcommentators formulated a definition of magic. Yet if this was magic, onereasons, then something must have been gravely wrong, or the ancientslet their imaginations run too freely. There seems to have been no under-standing in the magical operation of how the world ‘really’ worked. Eventhe ancients had to have some rudimentary understanding of causality,we might suggest. After all, they built magnificent temples, ships, andweapons, and the Greeks in particular developed the early rudiments ofscience, mathematics, and medicine. How could magic coexist with theseother domains of cultural achievement which would simply not havebeen possible if everyone thought magically?Frazer and TylorOne theoretical approach that has been advanced is to think that magicis false science, in the sense that a magical practitioner reasons wronglyfrom cause to effect. This view, which is attributed to Sir James GeorgeFrazer (1854 –1938), allows us to introduce human error into the equation.Here magic is a vehicle cultures use to discover fundamental laws of causeand effect; magic ‘works’ only because the real relationship betweencauses and their effects has been distorted or misrecognized. Anotherapproach derived from Sir Edward Tylor (1832–1917) and embraced byFrazer is to regard the connection a magical practitioner makes betweenan object he or she manipulates here, and the person over there who isthe target of that operation, as based on a fallacious association of ideas.The clay image and the person it represents share outward similarities but have no actual relationship to one another in the real world. In thisview, magic is an erroneous association of ideas based on analogy or, as Tylor famously put it, a mistaking of “ideal connexions for real con-nexions.” Moreover, in order for there to be an actual, tangential relation-ship between a magical object or action and its target, there would have to exist some medium through which the effects on the object here9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 3"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"4Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?could be transferred to the person over there. A third approach regardspractitioners of magic as a whole as delusional – assuming they are notoutright charlatans – since they apparently believe that they exercisesome control over the behavior of others when in fact they do not. Magic exists, according to this view, because everyone believes it exists.Powerful support for this approach can already be found in antiquity amongsuch authors as Plato (Laws933a–b), who was on the whole not par-ticularly interested in magic. These are just a few of many approaches, outside of the specifically medieval explanations mentioned earlier, that have been offered since antiquity to explain magic, and each offers avalid perspective. While they allow us to say that magic “exists,” in the sensethat people do magical things, nevertheless they prevent us from conclud-ing that there is any real effect behind it. Accordingly, none of these views allows magic to “exist” in the sense that it has any impact upon the world.One alternative then is to conclude that magic is fundamentally a psy-chological phenomenon, whether collective or individual. There aremany strands to this approach; however, its basic premise is that magicaloperations satisfy the practitioner’s need to accomplish something prac-tical in the face of otherwise insuperable or uncertain events. Illness presents a good example here. A family member has been struck with adebilitating illness for some inexplicable reason, by which I mean the avail-able avenues of explanation have either been found wanting or areunknown. A magical operation performed on behalf of the ailing familymember may not be thought directly to resolve the problem, but it allowsthose involved to feel as if some action has been taken. Magical action ispractical action, and however misguided it may be, it nonetheless givesconcrete expression to the concern of the family members involved in caring for their ailing relative. Note, however, that in viewing magic thisway, we have not asked whose psychology underlies the perceived magical efficacy. It seems that both collective and individual psychologyare at work here: society governs the conventions and expectations of magic,and individuals respond to and operate within those conventions. But the problem grows more difficult when we try to isolate exactly what an “individual” response is in this context. What we may take to be an “individual” emotional response – for example, mere satisfaction or reliefon the part of the sick person that a healing amulet has been made andplaced around his or her neck – at bottom has already been “collectively”defined by the society that takes the efficacy of such healing amulets forgranted. It seems that we cannot escape the way in which individualresponses reflect collective representations.9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 4"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?5MalinowskiOther psychological approaches to magic have more effectively madethat break or, rather, emphasized the “individual” quality of magic in termsof it being a means to an end, in contrast with religion as a collective organ-ization that functions as an end in itself. In Bronislaw Malinowski’s(1884 –1942) famous essay, Magic, Science, Religion and Other Essays(1948), based on his research among the Trobriand islanders, he draws animportant distinction between “sacred” activities like religion and magic,which partake of symbolic forms and behaviors, and “profane” or prag-matic activity like science and technological accomplishments. Thus in onesense Malinowski avoids the Frazerian puzzle of whether magic was actu-ally science in its infancy because these two activities are separate for him.On the other hand, he understood that magic was practical activity thatwas simultaneously interwoven with symbolism, not to mention what hememorably called its “coefficient of weirdness.” There is no simple wayto disconnect the two, even if we recognize a continuum with pure tech-nical activity at one end unencumbered by prohibitions and, at the otherend, technical activity hedged round by a series of metaphysical concernsand given a ritual stage for its enactment. What is often taken to beMalinowski’s most important contribution to the study of magic – that magicbegins where technology is insufficient – has been easily refuted,3but whatendures is his stress on the instrumental quality of magical activity andits anticipatory nature. As a means to an end, magical activity reaffirmsthe expectation of achievement and success in a given endeavor. It is psy-chologically satisfying to the individual participants for that reason. Butthat is not all. Malinowski also asserted that individual memory played arole in the perceived success of magic. Thus for every magical operationthat “succeeded,” this was remembered by the community more readilyand vividly than those that did not.4Together the anticipation of successand its outsize memory cannot be overestimated as factors that help toreinforce magical behavior.Magic as CommunicationThere is another, perhaps more personal, illustration of the problem of whatmagic is that does not directly involve any prevailing theory, which I pre-sent in the form of a thought experiment. Imagine that you are cominghome after work or school, just as you typically would. It has been an ordi-nary day and nothing particularly unusual has happened. When you get9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 5"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"6Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?to your door, you find a small package sitting on the doorstep. Youassume the package was delivered for you, so you open it and inside youfind a bloody chicken heart with a nail stabbed through it. Sickening asthat is, you realize the heart has been cut and inside the incision there isa sliver of paper, folded in half. You carefully pull the paper out, unfoldit, and find it has your name written on it. Tucked in the paper’s fold thereare some fingernails and hair – yourfingernails and hair.Since you are not superstitious, or are but would never admit it, the ratio-nal side of your brain takes over. The whole thing, you say, is ridiculous– some stupid trick. Who would have done this? And then you start think-ing: if it isn’t a gag, does someone really hate me? Why didn’t they just tellme they hated me rather than doing this? Even if it is a gag, what exactlyare they trying to say? Did they think I would believe it or that it wouldhave some effect on me? Did theythink it would work, even if I don’t? Who do I know that would believe in such nonsense, or go through suchelaborate measures even as a joke? And where in the world did they getmy fingernails and hair, let alone a bloody chicken heart?This example, albeit contrived, is not meant to suggest that magic is “real”in the sense that its operation has a physical impact on the world. It ismeant to suggest that magic is fundamentally a form of communication– and that communication, whatever shape it takes, can indeed impactthe behavior of others. Note that this is not the same thing as saying thatmagic exists because everyone believes it exists. Rather, as in the exam-ple above, even if one does not believe in magic, one can nevertheless believethat a magical act was meant to convey a message. The weirdness of theaction itself prompts a series of thoughts about what it might mean, andtherein lies the rub. Even before deciding whether there is anything to magic,one is diverted into thinking about whomight be behind it.5We cantherefore separate the question of whether magic is real from the ques-tion of whether it can have an impact on others’ behavior. Most critiquesof magic in antiquity and even more recently miss this distinctionentirely, focusing as they do on mechanical causal relationships in the magical operation itself that should be explicable in terms of observablenatural laws, not invisible forces. But magic is always effective only withina social context whose network of relationships defines it and gives it meaning. Indeed, magic is quite unthinkable outside a social context. Andit is within such a social context that we can say magic is “causal.” If amagical act changes someone’s behavior, then it has exerted a causal effect.But we can be much more specific here, even without yet worrying aboutparticular cultural milieux or historical forms of magic. Magical actsimply intention, which means that behind the individual act someoneintends to convey a message. The message can be harmful or helpful,9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 6"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?7depending on the circumstances, but the magical act itself registers andpublicizes someone’s desire.6Who is capable of publicizing their desiresin this way and how exactly they do it will depend on the culture beingexamined. But the important point to take away is that such intentional-ity, realized as magic, is fully structured as a social phenomenon. If magicis an act of communication, then the parameters for who can communi-cate and how they do so will be defined by the society in question. To givea clear example, if I am a late Roman Greek and wish to compose a cursetablet calling upon a nekydaimon‘spirit of a dead man’, I write that tabletin Greek, not in Latin or Syriac. I take for granted not only that the under-world spirit will understand Greek, but that it has any understanding atall. Since I am effectively using the spirit of a dead man as a go-betweento harm my enemy – say a prosecutor I wish to strike silent as he testifiesagainst me in an upcoming trial – then I am also assuming this spirit under-stands how to operate in my world. In this sense the dead man’s spirit isindistinguishable from a living person. Thus the entire chain of magicalcommunication, from its interlocutors to the medium of communicationto the anticipated action itself, is constituted in manifold ways by socialconvention.Lévy-BruhlIn order to better grasp the significance of this point, and to accord thelast example with modes of ancient Greek thinking, we need to come toterms with a fundamental anthropological notion set forth by LucienLévy-Bruhl (1857–1959), who was originally trained as a moral philosopher.In contrast to the evolutionary trend of Victorian scholarship on non-Western societies – of the type, for example, typified by Frazer’s model for the development of religion out of science, which in turn developedout of magic – Lévy-Bruhl instead argued that such societies were not “irrational,” in the sense of misunderstanding the laws of cause and effect,but were organized according to their own coherent principles. Foremostamong these was what he called the law of participation. In How NativesThink(Les Fonctions, 1910), Lévy-Bruhl writes that:7Primitive man, therefore, lives and acts in an environment of beings andobjects, all of which, in addition to the properties that we recognize themto possess, are endued with mystic attributes. He perceives their objectivereality mingled with another reality. He feels himself surrounded by aninfinity of imperceptible entities, nearly always invisible to sight, and alwaysredoubtable: ofttimes the souls of the dead are about him, and always he isencompassed by myriads of spirits of more or less defined personality.9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 7"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"8Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?There are two important strands to disentangle here. The first refers to thenotion of living within two orders of reality. This is what Lévy-Bruhlmeans by “mystic,” namely a belief in forces and influences that areinvisible, and often imperceptible, but nevertheless real. Ancient magic oper-ates within such a world, whereby the forces called upon, even when notexplicitly defined by a personality, are invisible and imperceptible and canonly be felt after they have taken effect. The implications of a mingled real-ity can be drawn out further, however, especially with regard to objects.Throughout the whole of Greek antiquity physical objects such as cult stat-ues were treated as though they had human attributes: they were bathedand cleaned, dressed and worshipped, presented with food offerings andprayers, and were thought capable of movement. The counterparts of cultstatues, figurines fashioned out of clay or wax, were treated with similarcare and used in ancient magic. Lévy-Bruhl helps us to understand whystatues and figurines were treated in this way, without resorting to anotion of irrationality defined (in our Western manner) by a failure to drawthe proper dividing line between animate and inanimate objects. InGreece in particular, matter itself could have an ambiguous status. To givea specific example, for some highly educated thinkers such as the late seventh/early sixth-century bcephilosopher Thales of Miletus, stonesthat had magnetic properties were thought to contain souls (11 A 22 D-K=Arist. de An. 1.2.405a19 –21). It is not hard to see how magnetic stonesthat attracted iron filings, in the absence of an available electromagnetictheory, could be thought to be animate – in other words to contain a soul.Reality as we know it in the mechanical, causal Western view, with its sharpdividing line between organic and inorganic matter, is collapsed inThales’ view of the magnet. Nor should it come as a surprise at this pointto know that magnets also figured in various ways in ancient magic. Asoutsiders to cultures that think this way, it simply will not do to superim-pose a rational/irrational distinction on their actions, as if by character-izing them this way we are implying that with further understanding ofmechanical causality their magical behavior would change. Such a viewneglects to observe that magic is “causal” within a social frameworkwhose effects are real. The problem then is that an incomplete grasp ofphysical causes is embedded within a broader social framework for theunderstanding of cause – and the key is that the social framework is themore salient of the two.Along these lines we can turn to the second dimension of Lévy-Bruhl’sconcept of participation, which is the notion that the mingled reality ofthe primitive world is peopled with divine beings, particularly spirits ofthe dead. The Greeks, as so many other cultures, took elaborate pains withburying their dead, largely as a way to ensure that the dead person’s soul9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 8"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?9rested peacefully. The Greeks harbored many different beliefs about deadsouls, and scaled them in different ways, from heroes who rested at theirleisure in the Elysium fields and the Isles of the Blessed, to an altogetherdifferent sort of underworld community whose anger was beyond humanappeasement. It is this community that interests us in particular, and itcomprised three sets of dead: those who died without funeral rites(ataphoi), those who died in an untimely or premature way (aDroi), andthose who died violent deaths, such as, in later times, gladiators andother murdered victims (biaiothanatoi).8A practitioner of magic whowished to curse his adversary had to pay court to these angry denizensand address them with his request for aid, especially the aDroiand biaio-thanatoi. The curse tablet itself was laid in their tombs, and sometimes inthe skeletal hand of the deceased. For the moment, the crucial point tograsp is that the Greeks, as so many of the cultures under study by Lévy-Bruhl, inhabited an extended society in which the dead participated as muchas the living. Lévy-Bruhl emphasizes the social dimension of this kind ofworld this way:9In short, without insisting on well-known facts, the primitive lives with hisdead as he does with the living who surround him. They are members, and very important members, of a society with manifold participations, a social symbiosis in which the collective representations of his group give him his place.It is quite natural for us to think of ourselves as members of a living community, with responsibilities and obligations to variously tiered groupsand subgroups, and to define ourselves in different ways with respect toeach of these groups. It is quite another thing entirely to include the deadamong those with whom we interact as if they were living presences, more-over to regard our obligations to them as equally important as those tothe living. When I speak of a social context for the practice of Greekmagic, it is this more expansive community that must be borne in mind.There are many examples from Greek literature that illustrate that thedead were a vital part of the living community. The plots of whole Greekdramas turn on that relationship, but it is not primarily the literaryexploitation of the dead that interests us. Rather, we are interested in thereceived wisdom that certain of the dead are engaged in an ongoingscrutiny of the activity of the living, and more importantly that the angrydead continue to drive the living to distraction. Hesiod tells us, for exam-ple, in the Works and Days (109 –26) that after the immortals brought theGolden Race of mortals into being and they had lived for a time, at deaththey were dispersed by Zeus throughout the world of mortal men as9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 9"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"10Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?invisible daimones. Thenceforth hidden in air and wandering the earth theybecame guardians of mortal men and, in some versions, were particularlydrawn to the surveillance of cases at law and unjust deeds. Much later inthe fourth century Plato tells us that souls of the angry dead are draggedback into the visible world and hover about tombs and graveyards(Phaedo81c– d). Elsewhere he notes that those done to death by violenceharbor a particular animus against their assailants (Laws865d– e), andXenophon adds that these souls track the wicked with avenging powers(Cyropaideia8.7.18 –19).This invisible half of the social community is not comprised solely ofthe dead. It goes without saying that a fundamental feature of Greek religion is that the pantheon of Olympian divinities, not to mention thevarious shades of Olympian divinities that are localized and specific to certain city-states, as well as the “lesser” divinities that occupy certain demesor districts, cult and boundary sites, can make themselves felt to mortals,sometimes in particular and personalized ways. Greek literature fromepic to tragedy and comedy, often an indispensable source for our under-standing of Greek religion, is preoccupied with dramatizing such interac-tions, especially those involving the Olympian divinities. In day-to-daypractice, however, the connection is rarely personalized to that degree, sothat for instance a response from the Delphic oracle is literally, throughthe medium of the Pythia or priestess, the voice of Apollo. But Apollo’spersonality and individual proclivities, such as those discussed in theHomeric Hymn to Apollo, are hardly that manifest in his actual responses.In magic there are several underworld divinities – Persephone, Hekate,Hermes, Selene in her magical aspect, as well as a plethora of anonymousdaimones– to whom practitioners of magic can address themselves.There are certain prescribed conventions of address here, for instance avictim in a curse is said to be bound in the presence of these underworldfigures who are in turn invoked by epithets that refer to their binding capac-ity. But beyond this there is nothing particularly distinctive about the personality of the divinity being addressed. Nonetheless it would be a mistake to regard these conventions of address as rhetorical only. Nor are these invisible entities any less significant for the fact that their personalities are less well defined. This is because personification, oranthropomorphism more generally, of invisible forces cannot be used byitself as a measure of how feltthese invisible forces are to members of agiven community. That can only be measured by the degree to which thatcommunity’s behavior is governed or modified by them. Thus Lévy-Bruhl’s concept of participation helps us to see how, in the particular Greekcontext, the souls of the dead, divinities, and mortals all partake of the 9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 10"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?11same reality, the same physical space and, in the case of magic, shareresponsibility as agents for the realization of someone’s desired aim.Evans-PritchardA landmark contribution to our understanding of how magic operates withina society was made by the justly famed British social anthropologistEdward E. Evans-Pritchard (1902–73) in his study, Witchcraft, Oracles, andMagic Among the Azande(1937). The impact of Evans-Pritchard’sresearch has reached well beyond his field of social anthropology to thehistorical study of magic and witchcraft, both in antiquity and premod-ern Europe and beyond, however sometimes in ways that distorted therather specific cultural findings he advanced. In brief, Evans-Pritcharddemonstrated in thorough detail how among the Azande,10a people wholive in central Africa along the Nile–Congo divide, magic, witchcraft, andoracles were “like three sides to a triangle.”11By this he meant that the threepractices were tightly interlocked, and depended on one another formutual reinforcement. Witchcraft (mangu) for the Azande was in essencea psychic emanation from someone that could harm another person, andthe Azande believed that witchcraft was localized as a material substancein the body that could be discovered by autopsy. Witchcraft couldemanate from such a person without their knowledge or conscious effort.Magic (ngua), on the other hand, for the Azande involved techniques toachieve some purpose that incorporated medicines, spells, and rituals. Magicis always consciously undertaken. The Azande use oracles – of which thethree most prominent in Zande society, with each progressing in prestige,were the termite,12rubbing-board,13and poison (benge)14oracles – todiagnose witchcraft in particular instances, which in turn sometimesdemand magic as a remedy.In a typical case of misfortune, let us say that a co-wife is suspected ofcheating on her husband with another man, one or more oracles are con-sulted and a diagnosis of witchcraft is found. The witchcraft may beattributed to a different co-wife or a neighbor who is thought to harbor illintentions toward the accused cheater, and the witchcraft is used toexplain why the co-wife cheated. Sometimes the oracles are used mutu-ally to confirm each other, with “lesser” oracles such as the termite oracle being confirmed by the rubbing-board, the rubbing-board is thenconfirmed by the poison oracle, and so forth. The diagnosis itself isalways socially relevant because it points toward another member of thecommunity as the agent responsible for the witchcraft. By diagnosing a9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 11"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"12Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?social origin for misfortune, this allows intervention and action to betaken that can determine future behavior. So for instance at this point inour example the accused co-wife may undertake magical remedies, suchas drinking and spitting water to cool off the witchcraft inside her, to removethe witchcraft. What has really happened, however, is that a stage has beenset to enact a change in social relations. If the suspect agrees to under-take a magical remedy for her witchcraft, she is in effect acknowledgingpublicly the harm she has done and at least ostensibly promising to dowhat she can to avoid it in the future. More dramatic shifts in social rela-tions can happen as well, such as when a suspect steadfastly denies anyresponsibility and as a result relations with that suspect are severed. Butby virtue of the fact that witchcraft was not consciously undertaken, andthat rules under British law at the time prevented direct retribution frombeing taken against confessed witches, an individual’s responsibility forinjury was diffused in such a way so as to encourage admissions of guilt.In other words, if witchcraft was performed unconsciously, the sense ofpersonal guilt was correspondingly lessened.It is impossible to do justice to the care with which Evans-Pritchard examines the wealth of Zande witchcraft and magical practices in such ashort order. However, it is not a detailed examination of Zande witchcraftor magic in particular that I want to pursue. Rather, in our effort still to come to terms with some key features of what anthropologists used tocall a magical world view,15especially to think about the ways in whichindividuals who exhibit such a world view explained their beliefs both to themselves and to outsiders, Evans-Pritchard offers some insightful evidence about the Azande. Having inherited the concern since Frazer and Lévy-Bruhl about whether non-Western magical practices could be reconciled with a “rational,” which is to say causally based, view of the world, Evans-Pritchard took great pains to examine exactly how theAzande justified witchcraft, oracles, and magic to themselves and to him.He showed for instance that if the Azande partially accounted for mis-fortune in terms of mystical (in the Lévy-Bruhl sense) relations, they werealso quite aware of their own role in such misfortune, as well as of the usualhaphazards of everyday life. Witchcraft was invoked not as a generalexplanation of misfortune, but rather to explain how on a particular occa-sion, all other things being equal, misfortune happened. The attributionof misfortune to witchcraft imposes a moral framework on events,because the social dimension of witchcraft enables such events to begiven an actionable meaning. It is my contention that Greek magic wasalso located within such a framework by its practitioners, although onemust grant due consideration for the substantial differences betweenZande and ancient Greek society.9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 12"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?13One of the most significant examples of a Zande explanation in this regardreported by Evans-Pritchard is the following:16I found it strange at first to live among Azande and listen to naïve explana-tions of misfortunes which, to our minds, have apparent causes, but after awhile I learnt the idiom of their thought and applied notions of witchcraftas spontaneously as themselves in situations where the concept was rele-vant. A boy knocked his foot against a small stump of wood in the centre ofa bush path, a frequent happening in Africa, and suffered pain and incon-venience in consequence. Owing to its position on his toe it was impossibleto keep the cut free from dirt and it began to fester. He declared thatwitchcraft had made him knock his foot against the stump. I always arguedwith Azande and criticized their statements, and I did so on this occasion. Itold the boy that he had knocked his foot against the stump of woodbecause he had been careless, and that witchcraft had not placed it in thepath, for it had grown there naturally. He agreed that witchcraft had noth-ing to do with the stump of wood because he had been careless, and thatwitchcraft had not placed it in his path but added that he had kept his eyesopen for stumps, as indeed every Zande does most carefully, and that if he had not been bewitched he would have seen the stump. As a conclusiveargument for his view he remarked that all cuts do not take days to heal but,on the contrary, close quickly, for that is the nature of cuts. Why, then, hadhis sore festered and remained open if there were no witchcraft behind it?In this account witchcraft is not invoked as a general explanation of misfortune. Instead, witchcraft explains how particular conditions came together, not contrary to but in conjunction with natural causes, to bring someone into relation with events such that they sustainedinjury. Hence it would be incorrect to suggest that because the Azandebelieve in witchcraft they do not have an understanding of natural causation. Witchcraft is one among several causes that explain an event,and its relevance derives both from the moral framework for respon-sibility to which it has reference and from its ability to account for deviations from an otherwise normal state of affairs that results in injury.To the extent that magic involves mystical or invisible powers, Zande explanations for magic are essentially the same as for witchcraft.17That there was a person who consciously undertook the magical rite, asdistinct from the unconscious activity of witchcraft, goes without saying.But the feeling among the Azande that in both witchcraft and magicevents are determined by invisible and visible action, and that explana-tions for situations of failure must thereby entail both natural and mystical causes, is about as close as an outside observer can come to acoherent account of their beliefs.9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 13"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"14Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?Finally, it is worth noting a rather important implication of Evans-Pritchard’s attempts to engage the Azande about their witchcraft andmagic beliefs. Part of the difficulty he encountered is that the typicalZande informant “actualizes these beliefs rather than intellectualizesthem,” and “their ideas are imprisoned in action and cannot be cited toexplain and justify action.”18These remarks tell a cautionary tale thatreaches well beyond the anxiety that the classicist, as a student of ancientculture, has no direct access to living subjects like the anthropologist. Evengranted that access, magic and witchcraft in both ancient and contemporarycultures are responses to misfortune and failure realized as action. Yet thisaction may only admit of reflection by the members of those cultures toa limited and, perhaps to our minds, unsatisfactory degree. Thus while weas observers attempt to understand how magical practices are con-structed within a given society, and further to draw out the implicationsof those practices as far as they imply a set of premises for how the worldworks, we must be prepared to accept that our explanations might haveseemed incomprehensible or even bizarre to the subjects under investi-gation. Were we actual members of that society, on the other hand, wemay well not be interested in explaining magic at all.Sympathetic MagicAlthough we have already mentioned Frazer’s position that magical activ-ity rests on a mistaken relationship between real causes and their perceivedeffects – a view that indispensably relies on Edward Tylor – we have notyet confronted his most significant contribution to the study of magic. Itis easy to exaggerate the importance of Frazer’s insight into the nature ofmagical operation. But for more than a century anthropologists, classicists,and scholars in related disciplines have been unable to displace his fun-damental notion of sympathetic magic, even if they have legitimately crit-icized and largely rendered effete the assumptions upon which it rests. InThe Golden Bough(1890), a Herculean effort that eventually filled twelvevolumes, Frazer sketched an overarching view of magical behavior that hecalled sympatheticand which branched in two directions: “first, that likeproduces like, or that an effect resembles its cause; and, second, that thingswhich have once been in contact with each other continue to act on eachother at a distance after the physical contact has been severed.”19The former idea Frazer called homeopathicor imitative magic, since it was based on the association of ideas through similarity; the latter he calledcontagiousmagic, since it was based on the association of ideas through9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 14"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?15contiguity. These two forms of magical thinking are ideal types, andFrazer correctly recognized that in practice they are often combined. Sofor example to fashion a figurine out of clay and pierce it with needles ishomeopathic magic, if I expect my victim to suffer injury on his person atthe points where I stick the needles. If I incorporate some of my victim’shair, nail parings, or a piece of his clothing into the figurine, I am usingcontagious magic. Because it is very common in many cultures to do bothoperations at the same time in fashioning a figurine, care must be taken inanalyzing it in such a way that does justice to both sympathetic principles.Both homeopathic and contagious magic imply a notion of sympathythat can be more closely analyzed. As an example, the magical operationthat is performed often mimics the results desired. If I pierce a lead cursetablet and construe my act of piercing it as a binding action – in other words,piercing the tablet here means to transfix it – and I anticipate the trans-fer of such a binding action to the target of my curse – binding my victimin the sense of preventing him from speaking or acting – then I am act-ing sympathetically. This is essentially the idea behind homeopathicmagic. However, the sympathetic relationship between my magicalaction and its intended effect implies that the effects must be transferredor communicated to my victim at a different point in space and a laterpoint in time.20How this process is understood by magical practitionersvaries from culture to culture. The Azande, for instance, attribute thetransfer to what they call the mbisimoor ‘soul’ of magic and witchcraft.21This is a psychic property of persons and things that can invisibly trans-fer itself through space and time, and it is this property which in their viewaccounts for how magic or witchcraft can realize its effects at a distancein space and time. Contagious magic relies upon a related but differentnotion of sympathy. Effects are similarly transferred through space andtime; however, in this case the magical operation itself is directed towarda victim’s possessions or body parts. A Greek witch burns her victim’s hair or clothing, for instance, as a way of transferring the fire of erotic emotion to him. Lévy-Bruhl understood contagious magic to imply his concept of participation, in the sense that there was a special connectionbetween a person and his things:22The things that a man has used, the clothes he has worn, his weapons, orna-ments, are part of him, arehis very self, (construing the verb “to be” as “toparticipate”), just like his saliva, nail-parings, hair, excreta, although to a lesserextent. Something has been communicated to them by him which is, as itwere, a continuance of his individuality, and in a mystic sense these objectsare henceforward inseparable from him.9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 15"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"16Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?Magic and the Extended PersonMore fundamentally the very existence of contagious magic implies anextended notion of ‘personhood’. This is what anthropologists in other con-texts have called the distributedor fractal person, which we can apply tomagical practice in a narrower sense than that which they employ.23I usethe term also to mean that a person’s possessions or body parts can bedistributed throughout his environment, and that in some sense theseaccoutrements and parts can be thought of as replicating him. Magic cap-italizes upon the belief that acting on the distributed parts will still affectthe whole (pars pro toto). The sympathetic relation guarantees that the partof the person being acted upon magically stands for the whole person andthat this connection holds true at a distance in time and space. In somecultural contexts, the notion of personhood can be expanded much further. For instance, within medieval Catholic tradition, not merely reliquaries, containing the body parts, bones, teeth, and blood of saints,were thought to convey power, but also holy oil poured onto their tombsand kept afterwards in vials or even grave dirt extracted from around theirtombs and kept in tiny parcels. In these latter instances, the saint’s person is distributed throughout the material that comes into contact with his tomb or sanctuary, and conventions have been reached by thecommunity in question as to how far the saint’s personhood extends. Inone instance, the painted eyes of Saint Peter on a fresco in a thirteenth-century Bulgarian church have been scratched out and saved, implyingthat the paint scrapings themselves can be thought of as extensions of Peter’sperson.24Moreover, we have numerous examples from other cultures of‘sacred geography’ – another example of participation – which refers tothe way in which a saint is identified with a village or his cult site. Theextensions of his person in these instances may reach not only to the phys-ical geography of his site, but also to the rituals performed in his honor,the dreams he conveys to those who incubate at his tomb, as well as tothe whole array of communicative acts that take place between him andhis devotees on their pilgrimages.25It is also interesting to consider how a culture conceives of personhoodas illustrated specifically in their magical behavior, which may or may notconform to other social or institutional forms of personhood. A differentkind of distributed personhood can be found in fourth-centurybceAttic curse tablets. Many of these tablets single out in a stereotyped way the hands, feet, tongue, and soul of their intended victim for bind-ing. This binding action is more broadly understood to cause a halt to the victim’s activity, whether it be their day-to-day commercial activity 9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 16"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?17or whether it be to secure and hold their erotic interest after turning it away from another. In some fundamental way, then, the magic capturesthe essential person parts for its action to be complete. Sometimes the body parts that are targeted are relevant to the aim of the magic – as anexample, the tongue and minds of prosecutors are bound by a worrieddefendant since these are the faculties most relevant to their profession –but at other times the same faculties are bound in a more general formulato restrain a business competitor.26In any case, to bind these parts is to bind the whole person. And while there is variation in the formula, which sometimes expands to include a person’s breast, heart, and, rarely,genitalia, some person parts such as the ears and nose are left outentirely. It may be that all of these sensory functions are subsumed underthe mention of the soul (psychB) in the tablets, but this is not clear. And yet every Greek had a more ample notion of personhood from daily experience, social, political, religious, and familial relations, child-birth, and so forth. Moreover, no Greek in daily life ever addressed his family or fellow demesmen by reference to these isolated body parts.Thus the question we have to answer is why in Greek magical practice the person is in some sense dislocated and reduced to a handful of frac-tured yet apparently essential parts.Magic and AnalogyThe preceding discussion has carried us somewhat further afield fromFrazer, but it illustrates in various ways how some of the key assumptionsthat underlie his sympathetic principles have been productively, if rather differently, amplified. There is, however, one assumption impliedin Frazer’s sympathetic principles that we have not addressed, and thisconcerns the problem of analogy. In homeopathic or imitative magic, ananalogy is created between the magical behavior and the effects desired.Frazer had described this as an incorrect association of ideas that like pro-duces like and that an effect resembles its cause. As a cardinal examplehe had unearthed a flurry of cross-cultural examples of image magic orthe creation of figurines, on which for the infliction of harm culturesnever seemed to tire of exercising their imagination. Stabbing, burning,pricking, piercing, shooting, ripping, tearing, burying, and stomping wereall acceptable activities exercised on figurines that manifested a variety of emotional attitudes toward the intended victim, although one must becareful to contextualize each of these actions with emotions that are relevant for the culture under consideration. Hence stabbing or piercingdo not necessarily imply anger, as we might be inclined to think from 9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 17"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"18Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?our own cultural experience, and in the case of Greek magical figurinesin particular piercing may not even imply pain.The first order of problem with analogy that we have to consider is thenotion of the copy in homeopathic or imitative magic. According toMichael Taussig, Frazer (in the vein of Edward Tylor before him) impliesin his extensive treatment of image magic that the images are copies thatrepresent their intended victim. So much, one might say, seems straight-forward. But Taussig draws attention to the idea that for this kind ofmagic to be effective, the copy must affect the original to such a degreethat the representation shares in or acquires the properties of what is rep-resented.27To him this is a disturbing notion because a copy implies anoriginal and at least ostensibly suggests that in fact it needs to resemblethat original to some degree. So he asks, “How much of a copy does thecopy have to be to have an effect on what it is a copy of ?”28The problemis that, as many scholars since Frazer have noted, image magic can oftenemploy “copies” that in no way resemble the human beings who serve astheir targets. In Greek examples that we shall consider later, clay orwaxen images at times are lumpy and unshapely, at best rude examplesof persons they are supposed to represent. Moreover, many culturesincluding Mediterranean ones also employ stones, wood, bones, dough,barley-meal, earth, plants, clothing, precious metal – virtually any imag-inable material – to make magical effigies, leaving open the question ofhow a “copy” is meant to resemble its “original,” let alone how that copycomes to be invested with the properties of the original. There is no sim-ple answer to these questions, because image magic depends to a largeextent on cultural conventions of representation that have to be examinedin a broader context. We can also put the problem another way by askingwhat are the strategies of representation employed by a given culture suchthat a piece of wood or stone can be used in image magic.This brings us to the second order of problem with the notion of ana-logy, namely the very idea of representation itself. It seems difficult whenstudying magic to avoid grappling with some notion of representation, insofar as a given magical act – for instance in weather magic, as whenone stirs a bowl of water with a finger to create inclement weather – seemsto encapsulate in miniature its intended consequences. Many scholarsassume, therefore, that magic uses symbolism as its strategy of represen-tation. Image magic is again the classic example. But what does the term symbolismin the context of image magic mean? For instance, do we mean that an image is ‘symbolic’ to the participants themselves or only to outsider observers? The distinction is important because if it is notkept carefully in view, it is all too easy to attribute symbolic meaning to9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 18"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?19behaviors that from the participants’ perspective are not indirect, but direct,immediate, and efficacious acts of communication. For example, Greeksand Egyptians left food offerings for the images of their gods, but if we asoutsiders call this behavior ‘symbolic’ we will overlook the fact that theseare “real physical interactions” with divinity, in the words of Alfred Gell.29Images in the form of temple statues offered the Greeks channels ofaccess to their divinities, and there is ample evidence that from their perspective there was nothing at all ‘symbolic’ about their behaviortoward them. In other words, it is not by offering food to a statue that theGreeks were representing how a statue might eat, as ifit ate in some otherway which the food offering was meant to symbolize. Instead, one offeredfood because that was how a statue ate – in other words, we have to acceptthat to Greeks statues were physically capable of eating. This is not to saythat idols and images are not at times used symbolically as aids to reli-gious piety. But where such idols function as vehicles of divinity andwhere, as in the Greek and Egyptian worlds, statues and figurines explic-itly embodied divinity, it is inappropriate to analyze the behavior towardthem as ‘symbolic’. The sense of agency exhibited in magical behavior, inthe formulation of John Skorupski, is ‘literal’ not symbolic,30and failingto take adequate account of this point risks mischaracterizing magical behav-ior as something akin to acting or impersonation. Moreover, to describean action as symbolic implies some underlying will to representation – asif there were some moment at which the culture in question collectivelyagreed that thenceforth a stone carving was going to stand for or repre-sent a divinity – whereas in actual practice ritual action of this typealways involves inherited behavior and understanding. And as Evans-Pritchard showed, despite his best efforts to engage the Azande on precisely these points, such an inherited understanding may not be sus-ceptible to discursive reflection. If contemporary parallels to ancientbehavior are any indication, I daresay few ancient Greeks would have under-stood the question of whether a divinity’s statue was a symbolic rather thana real agent, capable of actually interacting with humans, because the inher-ited understanding of divine statuary already guaranteed that the latter waspossible. We as outsiders begin from the assumption that statues cannothave genuine agency and mobility, making symbolism a rational altern-ative to explaining how other cultures interact with them. However, thesecultures live the realitythat statues are animate, not only rendering oursymbolic interpretation irrelevant but also calling into question ourcausal understanding of human action, according to which the motiva-tion for human behavior that we do not share is reducible to a set of intel-lectually defensible propositions.9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 19"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"20Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?None of what has been said up to this point removes the problem ofanalogy in magic. Indeed, analogical thinking in one form or another inmy view lies immovably at the heart of ritual behavior in so many differ-ent cultures that it is arguably its most characteristic feature. Magical beha-vior in this respect is no exception. However, we must take extra care thatwhen we use a term like analogy in the context of magic, we do not at thesame time allow our own discursive notions of representation or symbolismto come into play when they are unwarranted.Beyond FrazerIf Frazer’s legacy has led to a productive consideration of sympathetic magic by generations of scholars, in other ways some of the underlyingassumptions of those sympathetic principles have now been superseded.For example, to the extent that homeopathic and contagious magic were premised on a misunderstanding of natural law, Frazer’s theory haslargely been proven wrong. Many investigators, among whom the philo-sopher Ludwig Wittgenstein ranks in the forefront,31have argued thatmagical practice is not fundamentally concerned with the discovery of natural law. Magic may incorporate ways of thinking that depend upon asociety’s view of how the natural order works, as it does technology, asMalinowski showed, but magicians are not scientists in utero. ThusFrazer erred insofar as he took the causal understanding of natural law tobe the main aim of magical practice. In the view of some critics, Frazererred more profoundly by suggesting that a misunderstanding of(mechanical) cause lay at the heart of magic in the first place. However,as we have seen for instance in the case of the Azande, magical practicedoes not exclude an understanding of mechanical causation, nor ismechanical cause the only causal system with which magic operates. Ifread too narrowly, Frazer’s model for magic implies an irremediablehuman error, as Wittgenstein argued, and wrongly suggests that at bot-tom magic is a response to a scientific hypothesis about how the worldworks. But not only does this approach fail to account for a certain cere-monialism in human nature – which we might call ritual for ritual’s sake– it also does nothing to help us understand why particular forms ofmagic hold good for a given culture at a given time. Frazer used the par-ticulars of magical practice from hundreds of ethnographic accounts – anextraordinary and largely unparalleled feat to this day – to justify hismodel of magical principles. Yet every culture’s magic has a history thatcannot be fully explained by reference to those principles alone.9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 20"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?21Tambiah and Persuasive MagicIn rounding out our survey of anthropological approaches to magic we havefinally to mention the work on performance by Stanley Tambiah.32Tambiah’s research brings attention to the performative dimension of magic– the rituals and spells and their enactment – that help to create a magi-cal event. Tambiah’s work largely amplifies several lines of thought pro-posed by Malinowski, especially as found in his Coral Gardens and TheirMagic(London, 1935), and Evans-Pritchard in his Witchcraft, Oracles,and Magic Among the Azande (Oxford, 1937). At the risk of oversimplify-ing Tambiah’s careful rereading and elucidation of Malinowski andEvans-Pritchard, we can roughly summarize his findings as they apply tothe formand functionof magical acts. First, relying on examples taken fromEvans-Pritchard, Tambiah shows how the form of magical acts andobjects often is conceived within detailed metaphorical and analogicalschemes whereby desirable properties of one object or action are trans-ferred to another. The power of analogy, as we have already discussed, isbrought out fully within magical action, but before the action can be ana-lyzed, it is crucial for the observer to understand what properties a givenobject or action are thought to possess within a culture. Only then can thepoint of a given analogy deployed within magic be grasped. Here is oneexample taken from the Azande, which deals with their magical treatmentof epileptic fits, that Tambiah elucidates:33Epileptic fits are associated with the red bush monkey, which is thought todisplay certain movements resembling epileptic symptoms. Before sunrisethis monkey seems to be in a torpor, but as he comes out of it under thewarm rays of the sun, so does the epileptic slowly recover when placed inthe warmth of a fire. One of the remedies for epilepsy is to eat ashes of the burnt skull of the red monkey. Superficially considered, it seems incon-sistent and absurd that the ashes of the skull of the “epileptic” monkey cancure an epileptic man. But in fact the analogy moves in two steps, exploit-ing the fact that although the monkey’s movements resemble epilepsy, yetit is a normal occurrence for the monkey to revive daily from its torpor underthe warm rays of the sun, and the same recovery is desired in the patient. Itis this capacity of the monkey to revive daily that is persuasively exploitedby the rite of eating the ashes of the monkey’s skull.Several analogies are at work here. The Azande associate epileptic fits with the movements of the red bush monkey. This association allows further analogies to be drawn, so that the monkey’s daily “recovery”seems applicable to an epileptic patient, who is also known to be 9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 21"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"22Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?capable of recovering in a similar way after being placed near a fire. Whatremains is to effect a transfer of the monkey’s ability to recover to the patient,and this transfer is enacted quite directly by having the patient eat the ashesof the monkey’s skull. What Tambiah’s research shows is that it is aboveall critical to understand the network of analogical and metaphorical tax-onomies a given culture like the Azande has created for the objects, ani-mals, plants, colors, geography, and so forth, in their environment. Everyculture imposes on its physical environment some kind of classificationscheme, whether it be deployed practically to distinguish helpful orharmful plants34and animals or whether, as in magical or ritual action,the positive values in that scheme are exploited to solve some practicalproblem, such as a physical ailment.In the words of Tambiah, the rite “persuasively” exploits the monkey’sdesirable qualities, and to understand what he means by this we turn tohis work on Malinowski. The essence of Tambiah’s interpretation ofTrobriand magic, as first presented by Malinowski, is that a magical act isinextricably bound up with speech and ritual actions. But this is not astransparent a proposition as it at first seems. For the Trobriands, magicinvolves sacred speech, originally handed down to men from their firstancestors and culture heroes, which has the defining characteristic of beingable to influence events in the world. Ritual action not only taps sacredmyth – in other words ritual action incorporates mythical imagery and nar-rative – it has its own “grammar,” according to which its nonverbal actscan be organized. This approach to ritual is characteristic of anthropo-logists who have made what is sometimes called the “linguistic turn,” meaning that they have found analogies from historical linguistics and tex-tual language to be helpful in explaining ritual action. For our purposeswhat is significant is that for Tambiah ritual action, just as language, is asign system that can be used to exploit metaphors and analogies inher-ent in a culture’s system of meaning. Conversely, relying on philosophyof language theory proposed mainly by J. L. Austin’s How to Do Things withWords(Cambridge, Mass., 1962), Tambiah shows that under certainsocially determined contexts and conditions words are equivalent toaction. To take just one non-magical example, when an American jury pro-nounces a verdict of “Guilty” or “Not Guilty” before the judge and court,it not only makes an evaluative judgment about a defendant, it simulta-neously changes the status of the defendant’s relationship to the court andsociety. These words, uttered at the socially appropriate moment, actu-ally bring a new reality into being. Although Tambiah perhaps lays morestress on ritual language than on magical action in his overall analysis of magic,35he recognizes that it is fundamentally the two together that create a magical event. The conglomerated action is “persuasive” partly9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 22"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?23because it anticipates future events, as Malinowski first suggested, andattempts to bring into existence a state which is not yet achieved. Moreimportantly it is persuasive because the analogical nature of magicalaction implies a desired transfer of positive or negative qualities or prop-erties. As we have already noted, in broad terms magic publicizes some-one’s desire to influence events, often in a ritually emphatic way, but bothmagical objects and magical actions are structured through analogy, imi-tation, simile, and metaphor (themselves forms of analogy) – all of whichFrazer generally subsumed under the term sympathy– that depend for theirefficacy on invisible, but nonetheless real, relationships between themagic and its intended target.It is within the wider scope of ritual action generally, and with attentionto the effect of ritual on its participants, that Tambiah offers this succinctcharacterization:36Thus, it is possible to argue that all ritual, whatever the idiom, is addressedto the human participants and uses a technique which attempts to restruc-ture and integrate the minds and emotions of the actors. The technique com-bines verbal and nonverbal behavior and exploits their special properties.Language is an artificial construct and its strength is that its form owes noth-ing to external reality; it thus enjoys the power to invoke images and com-parisons, refer to time past and future, and relate events which cannot berepresented in action. Nonverbal action, on the other hand, excels in whatwords cannot easily do – it can codify analogically by imitating real events,reproduce technical acts, and express multiple implications simultane-ously. Words excel in expressive enlargement, physical actions in realistic presentation.Because magical action is ritual action we can readily apply Tambiah’s viewto all of the magic we will encounter in this book. Note first his emphasison the human participants as the audience for ritual or magical action.This refers to the indispensable social framework within which ritual andmagic take place. We can actually extend this notion further and suggestthat even when an individual performs magic alone or in private, it is nevertheless within an imagined social framework that it becomes effec-tive. In other words, because magic is aimed at influencing behavior,whether of human beings or even of demonic agents such as illnesses that threaten to attack, magic always becomes efficacious within the com-munity of agents that are understood to have influence in the world. Inmy view, Tambiah’s most important contribution to our understandingof magic is in recognizing how verbal and nonverbal action interpen-etrate one another. If ritual imitates a realistic presentation – stabbing adoll to cause pain in a victim – at the same time that it can exaggerate or9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 23"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"24Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?telescope that presentation, then spells complement and enlarge upon theritual action by invoking further comparisons and contrasts. The series ofanalogies created by the combination of words and action is not then fundamentally reducible to one interpretation. This is a key point, becauseit means that magic is expansive – new metaphors realized throughaction or language can be created and old ones can continually be rein-voked – and this helps to explain the adaptability of magic to new circum-stances, new contexts, and even to new cultures over time. The very factthat image magic is attested for over two thousand years in cultures in theMediterranean basin and European cultures farther north, which contin-ued to be influenced by Greco-Roman practices, cries out for such an explana-tion. This could only have happened if the practice of image magic continued to retain a certain authority derived from its antiquity on theone hand, while on the other being open to newer interpretations con-sistent with the changing institutional and religious realities of latertimes. Indeed, Greco-Roman magical practices actually form the basis oflater medieval and early modern perceptions of witchcraft.ConclusionThere are several specific questions worth emphasizing in light of our reviewof the major, mainly anthropological, theorists of magic. Our survey hasnot been exhaustive, but it has touched upon the most significant direc-tions researchers have taken in their investigations of magic. For anygiven magical object or instance of magical action, we have to bear in mindthe fundamental question of agency– which means we have to ask howthe magic works, or what or who makes it effective. Since magic relies oninvisible forces, we have to ask what those forces are and how are theyperceived. Since we know that magic operates within analogical frame-works, we must pay particular attention to the metaphors, similes, and imi-tative acts that are involved, while being careful to separate truly imitativeacts from those that are instead real or lived physical interactions. Finally,to understand why magic looks the way it does for a given culture, we haveto ask rather straightforwardly why it looks that way and not some otherway. In other words, we have to investigate its history as magic – for instancewere certain ritual actions always considered magical by the culture in ques-tion, or did a given object that was not formerly magical become so at somepoint in time? If we ask these kinds of questions, without getting too boggeddown in our own preconceived definitions of magic, we have a better chanceof grasping something of what Greek magic was in action. As we shall seein a moment, the Greeks used many often interchangeable terms for9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 24"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?25magic and had their own ideas about what it was and how it originated.However, what the Greeks called magic is often indistinguishable from theirofficially sanctioned cult practices – what we, but not even they, wouldcall their “religion.”37It therefore does an outsider no good to regard, forexample, one form of purification as “magical” and another “religious,” ifboth fall under some commonly understood framework for what makespurification effective, or what makes it interesting or necessary to do. Thoseare the things that our questions ought to seek to answer because they bringus closer to what magic was for the Greeks.At the same time, it is important to recognize that both the terms magicand religionhave limited value insofar as they artificially divide practicesthat for all intents and purposes can be the same. The distinctionbetween magic and religion, still employed by many Western scholars eventoday, emerged as early as the fourteenth century ce, and took firm holdin the sixteenth, when Reformation Protestant theologians began prop-agandistically to label Catholic sacramentalism and church ritual asmagic as a way to distinguish their own practices from those of themedieval church.38These writers well understood that, for instance, theinherited terms magia, magicus, maleficium, maleficus/a, veneficium, andveneficus/ahad original, pagan Roman meanings, which were in turn further defined in the works of Saint Augustine (354 – 430 ce) and especiallyin the law codes of the late antique emperors Theodosius II (401–50 ce)and Justinian (ca. 482–565 ce). Moreover, all of these Roman termsharked even further back into Greek pagan antiquity, leaving open the ques-tion of how relevant they were already in the fourteenth, let alone in latercenturies. But their immediate concerns were to reformulate a newdefinition of (Protestant) Christianity that was emphatically not based onthe seven Catholic sacraments (baptism, confirmation, marriage, theMass, ordination, penance, extreme unction). Because these sacramentslooked like magic they called into question the Catholic church’s cardinaldistinction between magic, which was relegated to the Devil and his ser-vants, and miracles, which were alone reserved for God and his agents.Hence Protestant writers tendentiously employed the ancient Romanterms, along with a host of newer medieval creations, to attack theirCatholic adversaries. This complex and fascinating history, which need notdirectly concern us and which has been explored in massive detail by thehistorian Keith Thomas39and more recently by Stuart Clark,40was cruciallyimportant to the distinction between magic and religion embraced by bothTylor and Frazer. Although this history is not of immediate concern in thepresent work, it should encourage us to keep separate the terminologicaldistinctions of magic and religion and their unique history from theinvestigation of ritual practices. In antiquity, ritual practices often go9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 25"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"26Magic: What Is It and How Does It Work?without explicit labels or bear labels that shift at the convenience of anancient critic.41This does not mean that we will always find completely satisfactoryanswers to our questions about magical practices, and here is wherecomparative approaches can be of help. The particulars of a given culturalcontext will always be definitive in any interpretation of magic, and com-parative approaches often tell us what to look for to help frame that inter-pretation. As we look more closely at examples of Greek magic, we will havemany opportunities – especially in cases where we lack evidence for howa given magical act was performed – to draw out some plausible implica-tions for how it was understood to work by its practitioners. There is a gooddeal here that for readers familiar with the scholarship on ancient magic,I hope, will be new. Some of the best current research on ancient magictends too cautiously to be descriptive and authors hesitate to advance inter-pretations that cannot be supported by textual evidence. Unfortunately,Greek magic involved non-textual objects and ritual action that were notalways directly described. But this does not mean that we cannot offer, inline with comparative approaches, a plausible if at times provisionalinterpretation. Indeed, beginning in the fifth centurybcethe outlines ofwhat we might call a theory of magic become fairly well defined, givingus an important basis from which to start. Nevertheless, we must alwaysbear in mind the caveat that the average Greek users of magic, as againsttheir elite and literate social counterparts who had a vested interest in con-trolling it, probably gave little thought to how magic worked. They just knewthat it did.9781405132381_4_001.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 26"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2A Framework for Greek Magic1212121Our task in this chapter is to present an intellectual framework for Greekmagic in the fifth and fourth centuries bcethat will provide a theologicaland causal basis for understanding how it was perceived to work. Only afterwe have come to terms with such a framework can we then proceed toexamine particular kinds of magic. The central dilemma for any studentof Greek magic is that the Greek term mageia(Latin magia) from whichwe derive ‘magic’ only emerges in the latter half of the fifth centurybce,while the evidence for practices and substances that were understood tobe magical, as well as for individuals who were thought to be magicians,existed prior to the birth of the term. From the point of view of practices,this state of affairs should not present a dilemma. Moreover, even as wemay attempt to use native Greek terms to define magic with precision,Greeks in the fifth century and later were not themselves completely consistent in their use of this or other related terms. By keeping our focuson practices, we avoid the overly textual approach of some scholars who claim at bottom that unless there is an available term for magic, thenpractices that are, from a later point of view, indistinguishable frommagic are not magic.1Magic and the GodsA couple of examples from Homer will illustrate the problem. In book 11of the Odyssey, a work whose composition can possibly be dated to theeighth centurybcebut in any case non-controversially to before the sixth,we find the hero Odysseus venturing into the underworld to summon the spirits of dead noble heroes and their wives and mothers. He does this9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 27"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"28A Framework for Greek Magicby digging a pit and filling it with honey and milk, sweet wine, water, andsprinkled barley meal. Then he sacrifices sheep and lets their blood run into the pit. After his sacrifices and prayers, the dead begin to comeforward to drink the blood so as to be able to communicate with him. By the fourth centurybce, if not the fifth, individuals who claimed the ability to summon the dead and communicate with them were widelyregarded as magicians engaging in necromancy. But in the description ofOdysseus, no such words for magic or necromancy are used – in fact, the Greek term for summoning the dead, psychagDgia, is post-Homeric andfirst occurs in the first quarter of the fifth century.2Nevertheless, noGreek living in the fifth century would have thought twice about consid-ering Odysseus’ ritual actions to be necromancy and to have had magicalconnotations.A different sort of example involves the adventures of Odysseus and thegoddess Circe. On the way to Circe’s palace in book 10 of the Odysseytoretrieve his companions, the god Hermes descends to warn Odysseusabout the dangers of this powerful goddess, who is explicitly called by theepithet, polypharmakos‘skilled in many drugs/medicines’. Hermes thenoffers Odysseus a ‘good medicine’ pharmakon esthlon, which he says is called mDlyby the gods but which men have difficulty digging up. MDlyis a plant with a black root and milky flower that later botanical authors occasionally identified as garlic, though it is unclear from theHomeric text what the plant originally was.3Hermes explains to Odysseusthat when he arrives at Circe’s palace, she will make him a drink and put pharmaka(plural, singular pharmakon), this time meaning ‘drugs’, into it, which without the mDlywould turn him into a pig, as she has already done to Odysseus’ companions. The mDlyHermes says is a good medicine that will protect Odysseus from the transformative effectsof her pharmaka, which in fact it does. (The moment at which Circeoffers Odysseus her drugged drink is represented on the cover of this book,in the 1891 oil painting by John William Waterhouse.) Again we have the problem that both Hermes’ mDlyand Circe’s unnamed pharmaka, from the point of view of the fifth century and later, were considered magic. Indeed, pharmaka‘drugs/medicines’ are one of the hallmarks ofAthenian magical practice in the fifth century and, by the fourth century,Circe along with other literary figures like Medea became synonymous withmagical practice. There is nothing to distinguish what Hermes and Circedo with their pharmakafrom what later practitioners do, except for its effectsof turning those who ingest them into swine, and yet the term pharmakonexisted well before the term mageia. We would be remiss to dismiss the evidence in earlier texts from consideration, not least because we could not then account for why later Greeks were so willing to recognizemagic in them.9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 28"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"A Framework for Greek Magic29Moreover, one may legitimately ask whether we should distinguish inany substantive way between magic as practiced by Greek gods and god-desses, and magic as practiced by mortals or heroes like Odysseus. Fromthe point of view of our main focus on practices, the answer is clearly no.However, Theodor Hopfner,4a distinguished nineteenth-century scholarof ancient magic, was once criticized for taking this approach to theextreme. Hopfner adduced many examples from Greek mythological lit-erature of deeds accomplished by the gods and objects in their posses-sion which he considered magical, such as Hermes’ famous golden staffthat mazed the eyes of men, but which other scholars believed fell clearlyoutside the realm of magic.5Somehow, the argument seemed to run, thedivine world needed more clearly to be marked off from the mortal one,since in respect of other religious activity the Greeks themselves sharplydifferentiated between divine and mortal behavior. In the case of Hermesgiving the drug mDlyto Odysseus, our text makes clear that this herb iscalled mDlyby the gods and it is hard for mortals to dig up. Hermes mustpoint it out to Odysseus, explain to him how to take it properly, and evenfurther how he should approach Circe once he has taken it. From a Greekmythological point of view, this kind of divine insight into the mortal worldis standard fare. We are told in numerous places that the gods even havea separate language to describe things in the natural world that are notfully understood by mortals. But every Greek in the fifth century under-stood that pharmaka‘drugs’ could be used by physicians practicingmedicine as well as by magicians hawking them as specialized products.It would not have occurred to them to discount Hermes’ mDlysomehowas a categorically different kind of drug. Accordingly, we should also beable to examine the effects of mDlyon Odysseus and his companions togain insight into how this kind of pharmaceutical magic was perceived to work.6The case of the goddess Demeter’s magical treatment of the mortal infantDemophoön presents an even clearer example of why a differentiationbetween divine and mortal magic is problematic. In the Homeric Hymnto Demeter, which is datable to the mid-seventh to mid-sixth centuriesbce,the goddess has come to earth in disguise as an old woman and been takeninto the household of the king of Eleusis, ostensibly to serve as the nurse-maid for the king’s newborn son, Demophoön. When Demeter boasts ofher abilities to do the job, she singles out her knowledge of magic in par-ticular (227–30):I will raise him, nor do I expect a spell or the Undercutterto harm him through the negligence of his nurse.For I know a charm more cutting than the Woodcutter;I know a strong safeguard against baneful bewitching.79781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 29"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"30A Framework for Greek MagicThere are several peculiar terms used in the original Greek in this boastthat relate to witchcraft and magic. First, the term she uses for ‘bewitch-ing’ epBlusiB, which literally means ‘to come upon/over one’, occurs onlyin this poem and in the Homeric Hymn to Hermes (37) in a parallelexpression, but is not among the common words for witchcraft in fifth-century usage. Whatever the exact frame of reference encompassed byepBlusiB, it would be a mistake not to see it as fitting within a broadunderstanding of witchcraft or magic that comes to be described by otherterms at a later period.The terms for “Undercutter” and “Woodcutter” in the same passage havealso puzzled scholars for at least a century.8One influential interpretationhas it that these are names for human agents who might try to harm thebaby through drugs or noxious herbals. This view was based on the factthat herbalists who cut roots for magical purposes were well known in theclassical period and went generally under the name rhizotomoi‘rootcut-ters’. A more recent and very plausible interpretation has shown thatbecause the Greek terms for Undercutter and Woodcutter have parallelsin later magical texts, they instead refer to supernatural or demonicforces that attack the gums of teething babies through cutting.9If this inter-pretation is correct, it shows us that we cannot in any intellectuallydefensible way distinguish Demeter’s magic from that of mortal practi-tioners. On the contrary, the Hymn to Demetermight well preserve for usone of the earliest references to this kind of teething or cutting demon.Moreover, Demeter’s boast itself is reminiscent of the actual form ofsome of these charms to protect against cutting demons, making it plaus-ible that the anonymous author(s) of the Hymnknew of such charms andput them into the mouth of the goddess. It is often the case in Greek mytho-logy that gods and goddesses are represented as the first practitioners of an otherwise human tradition, especially ritual traditions that addressthemselves to the gods. This is a classic example of myth operating as acharterfor a culture, which refers to a general theory of myth outlined originally by Malinowski. Such may be the case with Demeter and her know-ledge of teething magic: her actions and words were preserved as anexample to later Greeks, and the ritual performance of her Hymnby gen-erations of Greeks – especially those concerned with initiation into her mys-teries at Eleusis, which is the main focus of her Hymn– further preservedand disseminated such magical knowledge. But however that may be, onno account are we justified in claiming that, either on the grounds thatDemeter is a goddess or on the grounds that more common terms for magicemerge only after the composition of her Hymn, her knowledge ofwitchcraft and magic is not fully worthy of the same consideration we extendto magic of later periods.9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 30"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"A Framework for Greek Magic31Divinity and NatureThat the gods and goddesses of the Greeks should practice magic touchesupon another, more abstract, way in which divinity figures crucially in theframework for Greek magic that we are developing. I am referring to therelationship between divinity and nature, especially as conceived byphilosophers and physicians of the sixth and fifth centuriesbce. Our mostimportant critics of Greek magic emerge in the late fifth and early fourthcenturies in the writings of the Hippocratic physicians and Plato (ca.429 –347bce). These authors give us much direct insight into the range ofmagical practices known in their day and the claims made by theirassorted practitioners. The most striking thing about their critiques, how-ever, is that the possibility of magic is never plainly refuted. A modern readermight expect that to be their first point of attack but, instead, their cri-tiques turn on moral or logical contradictions in the claims and practicesof the magical practitioners. For them the question of whether magic ispossible at all seems not to be directly at issue, and is clearly of less rele-vance than whether a claim to be able to practice magic implies someunwarranted control over the gods. The reason for this is that, as I haveshown elsewhere,10the attacks on magic and magical practitionersassume a basic, largely Presocratic, view of the world in which nature anddivinity were inseparable. By implication, if nature is divine, then exploit-ing nature’s properties in magic in some sense implies a mastery of thedivine. Some eight hundred years after the Presocratics the naturalistwriter Aelian tells us that nature (phusis) is a witch (pharmakis),11but thiskind of statement entails a shift of thinking that now regards the wondersof nature as something largely separable from divine influence. In Athensof the fifth century such a statement probably would have constituted a charge of impiety (asebeia), under which rubric individuals could be exiled or sentenced to death.12On the other hand the dividing linebetween the effects of divine and the effects of magical causes in the fifthcentury was not altogether clear. How was anyone to know, for instance,in a given case of illness or misfortune, whether the causes were divine or mortal? Answering this question was critical because it determined the correct ritual or medical responses which could then be undertakento heal the illness. It became all important, in other words, to know what magic could and could not do, and how its effects were different fromdivine causes. Until that dividing line between magic and divinity was moreclearly drawn, the critics of magic were not in a position, it seems to me, to attack magical practices in a way that could actually invite criticism of divine agency itself. And as we shall see in a moment, the 9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 31"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"32A Framework for Greek Magicability to manipulate divine agency appears to have been a central claimof fifth-century magicians.The key position about nature among philosophers who lived beforeSocrates with which we have to come to terms is that divinity was inher-ent in nature. It is not a question here of particular, anthropomorphic divinities like Demeter and Hermes, but rather that the natural elementsthemselves were divine. Because the Hippocratic physicians and Plato were direct heirs to this tradition, we must first briefly examine at least its broad outlines to understand why they framed their critiques of magic in such a particular way. Thales of Miletus (late seventh/early sixthbce), for example, whom we have already met in connection with magnets and the souls they contain, actually took a much broader viewof ensoulment. For Thales was reputed to have said that everything was full of divinities, which he called daimones.13In this context we canconsider a daimDnto be a divine force capable of producing motion, but which is otherwise not clearly defined. Thus Thales’ first principle, water, out of which everything in the universe was generated, would alsobe divine. Anaximander of Miletus (d. after 547bce), according to latersources, developed the principle that the universe was unlimited – whathe called the “Infinite” – and that the “Infinite” itself was divinity.14In his footsteps Anaximenes of Miletus (fl. 546 –525 bce) made air (aBr) hisfirst principle, and the idea was also attributed to him that all things present, past, and future, as well as gods and divinity, generally emergedfrom air.15Heraclitus of Ephesus (fl. ca. 500bce) grounded the emergenceof the universe in fire, in direct reaction to the Milesian system ofAnaximander and Anaximenes that had placed air at the center, but similarly felt that the elemental powers constitutive of everything were fullof daimones.16The long-standing tradition among the Presocratics that the whole universe was divine can be complemented by the equally pervasive viewthat astronomical phenomena were also divine. Aristotle tells us thatAlcmaeon of Croton (fifth centurybce), like Thales, Heraclitus, andDiogenes of Apollonia (fl. fifth centurybce), wrote that “all divine thingsalso always move continuously: the moon, sun, stars, and the wholeheaven.”17Reflecting a similar viewpoint the comic poet Epicharmusclaimed that the winds, water, earth, sun, fire, and stars were gods.18AndEmpedocles (ca. 492– 432bce), a Presocratic philosopher whom we shallencounter later owing to the strong claims he made about his own mag-ical abilities, maintained that his four elements or roots – fire, earth, air,and water – were also gods.19These, then, are some examples of the com-plex attributions of divinity to nature made by the Presocratics. Their viewsabout nature and astronomical bodies lead directly to the form of critique9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 32"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"A Framework for Greek Magic33found in the most significant attack on magic that we have from the latefifth to early fourth centuries.The Hippocratics: Magic, Divination, and EpilepsyArguably the most influential attack on magic ever made in antiquityappears in this period in the Hippocratic treatise, On the Sacred Disease.The treatise is addressed to the rival healers of the Hippocratic school ofmedicine, who have not been identified with certainty but whose viewsseem to include both popular ideas about medicine and elements of themore sophisticated Presocratic philosophers like those briefly examinedabove. Nevertheless, the attacks made in this treatise were considerablyless influential in their own day compared to the use to which they wereput almost two millennia later.The fundamental arguments made in On the Sacred Diseaseagainst thefalse claims of magical practitioners, as far as we can tell, had no discernibleimpact on the behavior of its Greek contemporaries. This is a significantpoint to bear in mind as we proceed through the author’s arguments,because they speak strongly against his influence in his own day and againstthe sometimes exaggerated importance ascribed to his views by scholars.Nevertheless it is quite remarkable that in 1563 the German court physi-cian to Duke William of Cleves, Johannes Weyer, writing toward the middle of the major phase of continental European witch trials, publishedwhat is now regarded as a landmark in the emergence of skepticismtoward witchcraft with the publication of his De praestigiis daemonum(On the trickeries of demons).20Sigmund Freud regarded Weyer’s book asamong the most important in the history of psychiatry, and situatedprominently in Weyer’s chapter on “Magicians of Ill Repute” are none otherthan the excerpts on magic from On the Sacred Diseaseto which we areabout to turn.21The author or authors of On the Sacred Diseasedefend an approach tothe treatment of epilepsy – for the Greeks epilepsy was a divinely sent orsacred disease – that does not involve recognizing the immediate mani-festation of divinity, especially in anthropomorphic form, but ratherlooks to a set of more naturalistic or physical causes as the basis for thedisease. I hesitate to call such causes natural, because as we shall see eventhis Hippocratic author operates within the basic Presocratic frameworkthat attributes divinity to nature and its phenomena. In the author’seffort to distinguish the approach he will set forth, he needs, it seems ratherdesperately, to refute the claims made by a host of penumbral religiousspecialists who are apparently able to cure epilepsy through variegated 9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 33"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"34A Framework for Greek Magicinteractions with divinity. In the opinion of our author, those who first calledthe disease of epilepsy ‘sacred’ did so in order to conceal their own in-adequacy. Should their proposed remedies fail, the author suggests, thesepurveyors could easily blame the gods and avoid taking responsibility for failure themselves. He adds:22that those who first consecrated this disease are the same people who eventoday are called magicians (magoi), purifiers (kathartai), beggar-priests(agurtai) and charlatans (alazones); the very same who pretend that they are particularly pious and know much. Accordingly these individuals, by hiding behind divinity and setting it forth as a pretext for their helplessness,make use of it so that, not knowing anything, they are not exposed; thus they called this illness ‘sacred’. By choosing suitable words and prescribingpurifications and spells (epDidai), by advising abstinence from baths and frommany foods unsuitable for the sick, they made their healing method safe forthemselves.In our author’s view the whole array of services offered to heal epilepsy isone endless subterfuge, behind which the so-called specialists can hidethrough their appeal to divinity. Their practical advice is hollow and eventheir proposed dietary regimen is designed falsely to produce results: theimplication is that the foods from which the patients are advised toabstain are already harmful to them; it does not take much imaginationto speculate that such foods might in fact have been given to sick patientsjust to “prove” the effectiveness of refraining from them. But the claimsmade about divinity in this passage also emerge as problematic, in a waythat has drawn little attention from scholars, as the author proceeds withhis critique.The main problem with calling epilepsy ‘sacred’, which thereby entailscertain indefensible claims on divinity, is that in the author’s view doingso falsely distinguishes epilepsy from other diseases. However, epilepsy is no different than other diseases insofar as they allhave divine and human components. The author proceeds to describe this state of affairsin accord with the Presocratic view outlined earlier that the elements ofnature are divine:23This so-called ‘sacred’ disease comes from the same causes as others, fromwhat comes to and goes from us, from the cold, the sun, and the changingand never-ceasing winds. For these things are divine, so that it is not nec-essary for one distinguishing to consider the disease more divine than theothers, but all are divine and all are human. Each has a nature and force ofits own, and none is unmanageable and without remedy.9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 34"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"A Framework for Greek Magic35Thus the causal agents of disease in this account are the natural elementsthat have their own properties and unique effects. Diseases are bothdivine and human inasmuch as the divine elements are ultimatelyresponsible for their occurrence, and they are human inasmuch as eachdisease has its own nature and course which can be manipulated by thephysician.24We might have expected our author to deny any divine originto epilepsy except that, on the contrary, in many Hippocratic treatises and in popular tradition the acceptance of a twin origin for many diseasesfrom both divine and human causes was conventional wisdom. Thedivine origin of epilepsy stood out in particular because there werefamous myths such as the madness of Herakles, depicted for example inEuripides’ play of that name, which actually described the onset ofepilepsy. So well known was this story that, in addition to the term the‘sacred’ disease, epilepsy could also be called the ‘Heraklean disease’. Inany case, what our author mainly decries is the false claim that becauseepilepsy is more divine than other diseases, it thereby requires magical orreligious specialists who are wont to exaggerate their credentials in piety.His aim is as much to discredit this group as it is to provide a differentbasis on which to treat epilepsy.The magical and religious specialists singled out for the author’s ire offeredservices and claimed knowledge that extended well beyond healingepilepsy. In the most famous passage from On the Sacred Disease, we aretold that their abilities fundamentally involved changing the course of naturewhich, in light of our author’s Presocratic assumptions with regard to thedivine elements of nature, was tantamount to impiety (asebeia):25If they claim to know how to draw down the moon and eclipse the sun, tomake storms and fair weather, rain and drought, the sea impassable and the earth barren, and all other things of such kind – whether they claim toknow these things from rites or from some other knowledge or practice – bymaking this their business they seem to me to be impious, neither believ-ing that the gods exist nor that they have any power, and in so doing fail torefrain from extremes, since the gods are as nothing to them.The implications of these claims bring us face to face with what ourauthor finds so objectionable. As a good Presocratic, he regards themoon, sun, weather, and sea as features of the natural world that all par-take of divinity, if they are not divinities themselves. When our magicalspecialists claim control over these elements they imply that mortals cansomehow control divinity. But rather than insist on the transcendence ofdivinity at this point – in the sense that mortals can never control divinity9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 35"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"36A Framework for Greek Magic– instead our author concludes that these naturally divine powers cannotreally be divine if the specialists’ claims are true but mortal, since mor-tals control only what is mortal (1.31). In effect, he reasons, our special-ists are then denying the existence and power of divinity and thesedenials constitute impiety.There is no question that our author has advanced an attack against hisadversaries on mainly logical and rhetorical grounds. Recent researchconfirms this impression and has shown the Hippocratic authors to be wellversed in the sophistical arguments and rhetorical strategies of theirday.26But a rather glaring contradiction in his argument remains. On theone hand, our author says that the magical and religious specialists usethe supposed divine origin of epilepsy as an excuse to absolve themselvesfrom criticism when their remedies fail. This suggests that they areappealing to their ultimate inability to control divinity, even if they offerthe hope of influencing it. On the other hand, the specialists’ claims of draw-ing down the moon and eclipsing the sun suggest to our author that, if itwere possible to do such things, the gods could not exist nor have any power.Now our author cannot have it both ways: at one moment his adversaries’actions are based on the assumption that they cannot control divinity, atanother on the assumption that divinity does not exist at all. We have noway of knowing whether the weakness of arguments of this kind wasexploited, since no evidence remains of how, for example, the opponentsof our author responded to it. As Geoffrey Lloyd has shown,27the Hip-pocratic writers are competing not only against one another, but also likely against ritual practitioners of temple medicine at cult sites like thefamous one at Epidaurus for Asclepius, for medical business, in additionto the obvious competition coming from the magic and religious special-ists named in On the Sacred Disease. At least some of the remedies on offerat local healing cult sites seem to have been meant specifically to counterthe remedies suggested by physicians. On that point, there was a sayingfrequently quoted in antiquity to the effect that when the remedies of the physicians failed, everyone resorted to sacrificers, seers, spells, andamulets to solve their problems.28How the magical specialists actually diagnosed epilepsy provides someinsight into their techniques and treatment. It ought first to be said thatthe naturalistic explanation of epilepsy offered by the author of On the SacredDisease, utilizing as it does a typology of illness due to imbalances in thehumours phlegm and bile, turns out to be as fanciful as those offered by the magical specialists.29The author’s arguments are purely specula-tive and show no evidence of real anatomical understanding, but this is probably to be expected at a time when human autopsy was still morethan a century from being readily practiced.30His treatment regimen for9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 36"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"A Framework for Greek Magic37epilepsy is allopathic, meaning that because the imbalances in phlegm andbile in turn suggest too much dryness or moisture, and cold or heat in thebody, remedies that reversed those dispositions at the right momentshould cure the disease. As has been noted by Lloyd, in effect all our authordoes is substitute one set of invisible causes for another. Nevertheless, in his own mind he is clear that the magic (magia) and purifications(katharmoi) offered by the ritual specialists to cure the disease are in-effective, as he says at the very end of his treatise.31The shocking and bizarre nature of an epileptic seizure, as every Greekwho knew of Herakles’ own sufferings could attest, was so extraordinarythat it almost begged for divine explanation. But to the Greeks, the factthat a divinity could invade a human body was a familiar experience, mostfamously illustrated in the case of the Pythia at Delphi being invaded byApollo who thereby provided her with an oracular voice. In this caseApollo’s divine visitation was invited and controlled and unlike a suddenepileptic seizure, where it was not even clear which divinity might in factbe present. Our author describes the epileptic’s symptoms this way:32[The patient] becomes speechless and chokes, foam runs from the mouth,his teeth lock together, his hands contract, his eyes twist about, and they loseconsciousness; in some excrement also passes.In the description of Herakles’ epileptic seizure, a goddess of madness, Lussa,invades Herakles’ body, and Euripides actually describes the onset of themadness in terms remarkably similar to these.33The Greeks construed anepileptic seizure in terms of divine invasion, and in anthropologicalterms this kind of cultural phenomenon is called possession.34The issuenow for the patient, however, according to the author of On the SacredDisease, was to determine which divinity was responsible for the posses-sion. As we might expect, the terms in which these actions are describedare pejorative, but we need to be careful to distinguish the logic of the ritual specialists’ actions from the logic attributed to their actions by ourauthor. We are told that if the patient imitates a goat, roars, or suffers con-vulsions on his right side, the ritual specialists claim the Mother of the Godsis responsible. If he utters a loud and sharp cry, he is likened to a horseand Poseidon is made responsible. If he passes excrement, as our authorhas already explained is a common occurrence, the goddess Enodia isnamed. If the patient’s cries are more frequent and higher-pitched, likebirds, Apollo Nomius (pastoral) is responsible. If he foams at the mouthand kicks, Ares is the cause, and if he has fears and terrors that strike atnight, driving him out of bed, Hekate or the heroes are responsible. To ourauthor all of these attributions are absurd, and bespeak the lack of proper9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 37"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"38A Framework for Greek Magicnaturalistic reasoning to which he anticipates his audience will appeal.However, in his effort to discredit the ritual specialists he mischaracterizestheir responses as illogical when, in fact, there is a coherent logic behind them.The first point our author seems to miss is that the diagnoses of divineorigin for epilepsy are in effect a form of Greek divination. There are manydifferent types of Greek divination, and of course it would take us too farafield to explore them all here. However, the homology that is created in the diagnosis between the various ‘signs’ a patient exhibits and the divinity who is best characterized as the originator of those signs is in accord with standard Greek views of divination. Indeed, the functionallyimitative relationship between the sign and the divinity responsible for it is sympathetic, in the reconsidered terminology of Frazer that weexplored in chapter 1. In ornithomancy or bird divination, for example,the flight patterns and cries of birds are interpreted to determine whichdivinity is responsible for the sign and what the message might be.35Certain birds are associated with particular divinities, such as the crow andApollo, making it reasonable to associate higher-pitched birdlike cries withhim, as in the example of Apollo Nomius above. Although it is true thatthe cries and convulsions here are exhibited by the patient, we have noevidence outside the report of our author to suppose that this form of divination was viewed as illegitimate. Given the sheer variety of what theGreeks considered to be legitimate, humanly manifested divine signs –including chance utterances, involuntary bodily motions such as sneez-ing, tingling in the hand, and ringing in the ear – we cannot as confidentlyas our author judge the actions of the ritual specialists to be perverse.Instead, I would suggest that we actually have here another form of Greekdivination which, because of its context in On the Sacred Disease, has notbeen for the most part seriously examined by scholars.36This interactionbetween divination and magic should also remind us of the Azande, forwhom divination was the means used to determine the source of a givenbewitchment or magical affliction.The second and more important point that our author overlooks will bear directly on how we understand certain aspects of Greek magic to operate. It concerns the conceptual relationship between the epileptic, who is described in Greek as being held by the disease, and the dominantmetaphor of binding or being held down that animates the magic ofGreek curse tablets. The connection between epilepsy and binding magichas not been fully explored by scholars, although almost a century ago atleast one scholar suggested a connection.37Part of what has been missedlies in how the author of On the Sacred Diseasemocks the ritual actionsundertaken by the specialists to cure epilepsy, which he describes in thefollowing way:389781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 38"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"A Framework for Greek Magic39For they purify those held (tous ekhomenous) by the disease with blood andother such things as though they have some pollution, an avenging spirit,or were bewitched (verb pharmassD) by men.In the author’s view purification is an illogical response to epilepsy becauseby definition, the author argues, purification implies a prior defilement(miasma), blood guilt (alastoria), bewitchment (pepharmakeusthai), or someother unholy deed (ergon anosion), none of which is relevant to epilepsy.Moreover, the author derides the fact that epileptic victims are not takento the temples of the gods thought responsible for the attack, nor are theoffscourings from purification dedicated to those gods. Instead, the offs-courings from purification are hidden in the earth, dumped into the sea,or carried into the mountains so as to prevent anyone from touching orstepping on them. To our author each of these actions illustrates thewrong ritual response because each fails to acknowledge in a rituallyappropriate manner the supposed responsible divinity. My concern is withthe author’s comparison that these purificatory actions are undertaken ‘asthough they have some pollution, an avenging spirit, or were bewitchedby men’. Our author clearly does not accept these explanations becausethey do not accord with his own understanding of epilepsy’s causes. Buthis remarks suggest that the specialists did, in fact, treat epilepsy as theoutcome of pollution, avenging spirits, and bewitchment. And it is the magical dimension here that most interests us. It is hard to understandwhy the specialists would treat epilepsy as if it derived from bewitch-ment unless it was believed that epilepsy itself could be motivated by magic.A common type of magic in the fifth century and later involves themetaphor of binding or holding down someone, as a way to thwart theirambitions, activities, or even their powers of perception. In curse tablets,for example, the written curses frequently depict a speaker who says inthe first person ‘I bind down’ (katadD) or ‘I hold down’ (katekhD) such and such a person, and his or her attributes, works, companions, and soforth. We shall have an opportunity later to examine some of these tabletsin detail. For the moment, suffice it to note that this same metaphor ofholding down, and the same verb katekhDand its cognate forms, are usedto describe in the broadest terms the Greek phenomenon of possession.And we have just seen epileptics described in terms similar to these,especially in the phrase ‘those held (tous ekhomenous) by the disease’.Despite the use of the simplex form ekhomenousin the description of an epileptic seizure in On the Sacred Disease, speechlessness, choking,clenching of the teeth and hands, must have visibly illustrated to themagical specialists as well as to an ordinary bystander the very definitionof the compound forms katokhosor katekhomenos, which mean ‘possessed’9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 39"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"40A Framework for Greek Magicor literally ‘held down’. The additional features of losing consciousness andhaving one’s eyes twist about – which the Greeks described as having one’snormal mode of awareness replaced by a different one – are also import-ant to the general Greek understanding of possession. In later medical literature (Galen, second century ce), the term katokhB, another cognatefrom the same verb katekhD, still refers specifically to a disorder likecatalepsy, in which there is a loss of consciousness and complete rigidityof the body, although by this time the divine origin of this family ofafflictions had been largely discarded.39Possession in the fifth and fourthcenturiesbcewas literally a matter of being overtaken by a divinity or divinepower, and epilepsy seems to have been thought of as a particularlystrong form of divine possession. But the disposition of possessed persons,who appeared visibly bound or held down, also dovetailed exceedingly wellwith the prevailing conception of binding magic. Thus contrary to the viewsof the author of On the Sacred Disease, our ritual specialists were altogetherlogical in ritually treating epilepsy as if they were counteracting magic,because magic was regarded as one possible cause.There is still further confirmation of this view to be found if we look againat the particular divinities named as examples of those thought respons-ible for epileptic attacks.Several of the divinities mentioned by the author of On the SacredDisease, including the Mother of the Gods,40Ares,41Hekate, the heroes,42who are commonly figured in Greek thought as daimones, are invoked byname in known curse tablets. Some of these tablets are dated as early asthe fourth centurybce, but our earliest tablets reach to the beginning ofthe fifth century. According to the typical curse formula, these divinitiesare the ones in the presence of whom a victim is magically bound and theyalso function as the agents who will realize the aims of the curse. It wasGanschinietz43who long ago suggested a connection between the state ofbeing katokhos‘possessed’ and the frequent use of the verb katekhD‘I bind’ in the Attic curse tablets. But not even he, I believe, fully realizedthe implications of his suggestion. Moreover, in the curse tablets thechthonic or underworld divinities Hekate and Hermes are frequentlycalled by the epithets katokhosand katokhB, terms which reinforce theirrole as the divinities most responsible for overseeing the binding actionenvisaged in the tablets. Recall that the author of On the Sacred Diseasealso mentions that the specialists’ ritual actions suggest to him that theyare purifying someone from an ‘avenging spirit’ (alastoria). In Greekthought this term was reserved for actions that were explained by divinevengeance, and we have other confirmation outside On the SacredDiseasefrom Plato44and later Aesop45that refer to magic used specificallyto avert divine anger. Clearly one form which that divine anger could take9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 40"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"A Framework for Greek Magic41was an epileptic attack, and such an attack in turn could be brought onby a binding curse. We have then, in contrast to the view of our physicianauthor, every reason to believe that the magical specialists whom he crit-icizes were offering remedies aimed at appeasing the divinities invokedas agents in a binding curse. This is not to say that all instances ofepilepsy were diagnosed by these specialists as the result of magic. It israther to say that because the author of On the Sacred Diseaseis so deter-mined to discredit his adversaries’ logic, he misconstrues in fact howconsistent their ritual solutions were when cases of divine anger as aresult of binding magic were actually diagnosed. Moreover, the whole divinetaxonomy of symptoms developed by these specialists provided a frame-work in which to judge the crucial question of which divinity was respon-sible for the attack. The degree of specificity required by that frameworkfurther testifies to how important it was to identify the correct divinity.We are no longer in the world of myth when characters can appeal to thegods generally for aid. In the realm of magic, with the possibility ofspecific divinities being invoked as magical agents, a specialist whose jobit was to counteract that magic had every interest in getting his diagnosisexactly right.To our author the main sticking point is that, in his view, it is illogicalto suggest that a divinity could be a source of pollution. Rather, it is moreplausible to expect the divinity to be a source of purification andsanctification.46This view is quite wildly at odds with what we might con-sider the popular Greek view, in which it was taken as a tenet of Greekreligious behavior that angered divinities could cause pollution in humanbeings. Such a difference in understanding again gives us evidence thatour author does not appreciate the religious rationale of his contempo-raries. Note clearly that our author does not call divinity into question, onlythe claim that it could be a source of impurity. Furthermore, according tohim, the specialists’ remediation involves purification with blood, whichwas normally regarded in Greek religion as impure. As Robert Parker47hassuggested, the specialists need blood not because it defiles but because itis a token of the defilement or pollution that was to be removed. EarlierGreek thinkers, such as Heraclitus of Ephesus, famously took issue withthe logic of ritually purifying with blood, and claimed that it was contra-dictory, ‘as if one who stepped in dirt washed himself off with dirt’.48Ourauthor seems to have inherited the same Presocratic viewpoint. But bothof these criticisms fail to acknowledge that the purification was aimed atreversing magical attacks that harnessed divine anger, which as we haveseen was accepted by the Greeks as a common enough cause of illnessand disease, or even madness. It was therefore quite consistent that theoffscourings from purification had to be disposed of completely, with no9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 41"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"42A Framework for Greek Magicpossibility of further human contact. By criticizing where the specialistsdeposited the remnants of their purifications, the author of On the SacredDiseaseagain misunderstands the common practice, for instance, of disposing offscourings in springs, marshes, and fountains to dissolve the“pollution through contact with the purest forms of matter.”49In otherwords, the specialists seem to have known what they were doing; our author,by failing to acknowledge this, comes close to running afoul of his ownconventional, religious norms.50This leads him to make a very curiousadmission at this point in his attack against the specialists’ purificatoryactions:51Indeed divinity purifies and sanctifies and is the thing that cleanses the great-est and most unholy of our sins. We ourselves mark the boundaries of thesanctuaries and sacred precincts of the gods so that no one will traverse themunless he is pure; when we enter we besprinkle ourselves, not as defiling our-selves, but to wash away any defilement that we have previously acquired.Thus it is not the principle of purification that disturbs our author nor isit, given the common practice of using bloodshed in certain types of puri-fication ritual, the medium through which purification takes place. Instead,as this passage suggests, it is the specialists’ practice of purification out-side the boundaries of civic cult, signified here by the mention of templeprecincts and sanctuaries, which is most offensive to him.52Plato and Greek PsychologyThis concern is amplified in a similar way in the fourth century by Plato,who shares with the author of On the Sacred Diseasea deep distrust of the cast of characters – magicians (magoi), purifiers (kathartai), beggar-priests (agurtai), and outright charlatans (alazones) – who unscrupu-lously foist their magical services on their clients. What neither authordirectly addresses, unfortunately, is why these clients have apparently foundthe services offered by civic cult to be inadequate. Like the Hippocraticauthor, Plato’s writings offer much insight into the types of magical ser-vices offered by specialists, although Plato’s own views about the efficacyof magic, as distinct from his contempt for its itinerant purveyors, are harderto pin down. For instance, Plato can cite approvingly the example of midwives who excite or relieve the pains of childbirth through drugs(pharmaka) and spells (epDidai),53and the arsenal of physicians thatincludes simples, cauteries, incisions, and spells (epDidai),54but at the sametime he can condemn ‘those that evoke (psukhagDgein) the souls of the9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 42"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"A Framework for Greek Magic43dead, claiming to persuade the gods as if by bewitching them withsacrifices, prayers, and spells (epDidai)’.55Paradoxically, it is not theefficacy of spells that is in question here, nor evocation of the dead – muchas the author of On the Sacred Diseasestopped short of denying the efficacy of purification – but rather the individuals whose religious services, in his view, do not serve the public interest. He reserves his most stinging criticism for the begging-priests (agurtai) and seers (manteis), the latter of which were not explicitly identified by the authorof On the Sacred Disease:56[and how] begging-priests and seers go to rich men’s doors and persuadethem that, having acquired a power from the gods through sacrifices and spells,with pleasures and festivals they can cure any misdeed by a man or his ances-tors, and if a man wants to harm his enemy, for a small cost he will be ableto harm just and unjust alike, persuading, as they say, the gods to aid themthrough spells (epagDgai) and binding magic (katadesmoi).The begging-priests and seers in this passage, as well as the magicians,purifiers, and charlatans mentioned in On the Sacred Disease, haverecently been extensively examined by Matthew Dickie. In his research,Dickie shows that although the names differ, there is substantial agree-ment in the ancient sources that members of these groups are, on the whole, self-proclaimed religious specialists, self-employed, itinerant, andsocially inferior, although each group does have its peculiar characteris-tics that ought not to be left out of account.57That these individuals aremotivated by self-interest alone is an assumption which Plato and theHippocratic author make – since their pecuniary needs are singled out by both authors – but which we perhaps should not take so readily forgranted. On the whole, Plato seems more interested in restricting the private nature of this group’s activities and in sentencing the ones whohave specialized knowledge of magic to severer penalties than those whodo not have such specialized knowledge.It is in the context of sentencing the religious specialists who practicemagic (pharmakeia) in his ideal state that Plato offers what amounts to a theory of magic. He first divides magic into two categories. The firstinvolves harm caused by drinks, foods, or unguents, and owes its efficacyto ‘harm by means of matter against matter according to nature’.58His mainpoint here is that these substances have known effects on the body andPlato seems to allow that, call them what you will, these effects are basic-ally biological. Poisoning someone, for example, for the purposes oferotic magic owes its effects to the toxins harmful to the body, Platowould argue, not to any “magical” attributes the substances were believed9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 43"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"44A Framework for Greek Magicto contain. The second type of magic (goBteia) is based on the anxietiesand fears produced in its victims and it operates primarily on psycholog-ical grounds:59The other type is that which, by means of enchantments and spells and so-called bindings, persuades those attempting to harm their victims that theycan do so, and persuades the victims that they really are being harmed bythose capable of bewitching (goBteuein). With respect to this and all such matters, it is neither easy to recognize what has happened, nor, if oneknows, is it easy to persuade others. With regard to men’s souls, it is not worthtrying to persuade those who are suspicious of one another about such things,if some of them see molded wax images either at their doorways or at theplaces where three roads meet or on the tombs of their ancestors themselves,nor to admonish those who do not have a clear belief about all such thingsto make light of them.Plato’s catalogue of magical practices is not random but includes themost common forms of magic in the classical period, and we shall engagewith each of them in later parts of this work. His characterization ofmagic, basing its efficacy as it does on a mistaken belief about causes and implying that it would disappear if only its practitioners understoodphysical causality, might almost be said to make Plato modern in his outlook. Insofar as people perform spells and binding charms, place waximages at doorways or on tombs, Plato concedes that his fellow Greekspractice magic, although he stops short of claiming that their activities exert anything other than psychological effects.60He further adds that such activities also reinforce the practitioner’s belief in his own powers –a statement that might have come right out of the writings of Frazer,Malinowski, or Tambiah.Magic and CausalityThe impression from Plato that, apart from its psychological effects, thissecond type of magic exerts no real effect in the world brings us to theconsideration of Greek causality. Our notions of causality are not thesame as for the Greeks. The causal systems at work in classical Greek cul-ture, to the extent we can reconstruct them, along with the types of infer-ences which they believed were derivable from them, are not intuitive andmust be examined carefully. If the cross-cultural research we reviewed inchapter 1 suggests anything, it is that cultures operate within their own,unique frames of reference when it comes to causes and effects, especiallywhen the causes are invisible. As we saw with the author of On the Sacred9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 44"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"A Framework for Greek Magic45Disease, the question before the physician was not whether there was aninvisible network of causes, but which were the proper ones to diagnosein a given case of illness. So it is with magic in general.The general problem of causality in situations of illness or injury was atopic of considerable interest to fifth- and fourth-century Greek intellec-tuals, including tragedians, historians, orators, and physicians.61Theirexplanations are revealing because they demonstrate that the determina-tion of the cause of an event could imply competing and, at times incom-patible views of agency. Nevertheless, multiple causes could determine thesame event, but which to us would appear as inconsistent. It is notewor-thy that in Plato’s view, he locates the causes of his second type of magicentirely with the individual practitioner, and identifies the efficient causeof magic as his or her ability to persuade themselves and others that theiractions produce real effects. At the same time, in other writings of Platohe seems to take the efficacy of spells, when issued by midwives and physi-cians, for granted, just as he takes pharmaceutical “magic” for granted, mak-ing it unclear exactly where he stands on magical activity as a whole. Heis not alone, however, in this ambiguity. We have already seen the authorof On the Sacred Disease wrestle with the similar dilemma of denying the efficacy of his adversaries’ remedies, without denying their efficacy inprinciple. There are several reasons for this: first, magical causation wasdifficult to distinguish from divine agency, and before Aristotle intellec-tuals’ attempts to rationalize the cause for an event typically included divinity as one possible factor. Second, like divinity magic operatedaccording to the principle of actio in distans ‘action at a distance’, whichis a medieval scholastic term that, I think, metaphorically captures theancient reality. As an example, a binding curse tablet could be buried ina grave or well and cause an orator in court – at a distance in time andspace – to lose his memory and voice. This means that even when other,more immediate causes for an event, such as loss of memory, can be found,it is nearly impossible to exclude magic as one possible cause, especiallywhen there is already a cultural expectation that some types of events can be caused by magic. Third, Greek magic like most magic was basedin volition, which means that a person used magic to achieve a desiredoutcome, and by doing so prompted a sequence of events towardfulfilling that desire. Volitional cause, as we shall see below, is often overlooked and can subsume within it what we might take to be more proximate, visible, and physical causes.For many contemporary readers, what we take for granted in ourcausal thinking is largely the product of hundreds of years of social and legal deliberation. It is not inevitable, for example, that events per-ceived to be out of human control enjoy the legal status of ‘acts of God’,9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 45"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"46A Framework for Greek Magicdifferently defined under contract and tort law, but rather the result of centuries of institutional disagreement that has worked out when breachof contract or liability should ensue. It is no easy task to come to termswith how differently ancient Greeks interpreted such phenomena. Inantiquity an ‘act of God’, such as a natural disaster or a lightning storm,might not only have had divine causes, but the humans who suffered during the event might well have been regarded as morally responsiblefor it themselves. When we inquire into the causes of an event, assumingwe have first stipulated what the ‘event’ itself is, we are confronted withmany possibilities which grow as a situation is analyzed into its constituentparts. As one example, in contemporary Anglo-American jurisprudence,the proximate cause – meaning a necessary cause near enough to the target event (e.g., damage, injury, loss, etc.) in space and time to be con-sidered a sufficient one – is often singled out to help guide the court inthe determination of moral responsibility. However, proximate causerelies on a spatial metaphor that has long been recognized as inadequateto serve as a main criterion of responsibility.62In antiquity the argumentof proximate cause was even less relevant than it is today because humanagency and divine agency could overlap in the explanation of a given event.We can see how this works by relating the famous late fifth-century caseof the javelin-thrower.63An athlete practicing one day threw a javelin andkilled another youth who ran into its path. Plutarch (ca. 50 – ca. 120 ce)reports that Pericles (ca. 495 – 429bce) and the philosopher Protagoras (ca. 490 – 420bce) spent an entire day discussing whether the javelin, theathlete who hurled it, or the judges of the contests ought to be consideredthe cause of death ‘in the most correct sense’.64It might at first strike readers as odd that the javelin itself could be considered a cause of injury,but in Athens there was actually a separate court for the trial of inanimateobjects.65Inanimate objects could, on the contrary, be held legally and ritually responsible for murder in Athens. We shall look further at this phenomenon later when we discuss the use of figurines in magic in chapter 3. For now, suffice it to note that the discussion between Periclesand Protagoras gives some indication of how complicated the determinationof cause could become. A similar case is at issue in Antiphon’s SecondTetralogy, a prepared but not a real speech, where the further possibilityis considered that the deceased himself was responsible because he raninto the path of the javelin.66An additional factor that is raised, but notconsidered in any depth, is that the youth’s trainer might be responsible,because he had called the youth onto the field at the fatal moment. A further possibility beyond human action is then considered, and it is thispossibility that we need to highlight. In the deliberation, the father of thedead youth remarks that it would not be just to acquit the javelin-thrower9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 46"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"A Framework for Greek Magic47merely because of the misfortune of his error, because it is not clearwhether the misfortune has occurred with or without divine influence. Hesays that if the misfortune occurred without divine influence, then thejavelin-thrower should be punished for his error. But if divine punishmentis at work in these events and has fallen on the youth because of some(unknown) impious action, then it is just not to hinder divine retribution– in other words, the javelin-thrower should not be punished.67Thus theconsideration of empirical causality does not exclude divine influence. Thepossibility of divine influence in human action creates a situation inwhich mere human error may be implicated in an invisible network of divineretribution, and the effects of human error and divine retribution (the youthbeing run through by the javelin) may appear the same.Although this example has not been exhaustive, it should give ample indication of the flexible system of causality available in Greece, wherebyan event can be determined by factors human and divine, visible and invisible, present and past, as well as proximate and remote, both in a spatial and temporal sense. These considerations can be paralleled in Greek dramatic literature, which can sometimes exaggerate the realitiesof what was believed for effect. But in the remarks of a Phrygian slave inEuripides’ Oresteswe find the same array of alternatives when he is askedwhither his mistress, Helen, had disappeared. He replies that it was eitherthrough magic (pharmaka), the arts of magicians (magoi), or that she wasstolen away by the gods (1497–98), and it is important to see that thesealternatives are not mutually exclusive. Like the religious specialists criticized in On the Sacred Disease, if I am confronted with an epilepticpatient I now have to ask whether the seizure is due to human or divinecauses, none of which may be visible, and if divine whether it is due todivine retribution for some impious act, or to divine retribution thatresults from magic, both of which could have happened in the past, or tosome bewildering combination of all of the above. And because these causalconditions are not mutually exclusive they might all hold true for a givenevent at the same time.Magic adds another dimension, namely volitional cause, becausemagic can be understood as an expression of intention and, in somecases, as a visible register or marker of intention. Although Plato does notdiscuss this directly, he does seem at least partially aware of how it works.Recall that in his mention of spells, binding curses, and wax figurines onone side of the equation these reinforce to the practitioners that they arein fact capable of harming their victims, while on the other side they rein-force to the victims that they really are the victims of harm.68We have agood deal of direct evidence from later sources of magic, such as the Greco-Egyptian magical papyri, which amply testify to the volitional nature of9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 47"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"48A Framework for Greek Magicmagic. Many spells begin with the assertion “If you desire (ethelD) to dosuch and such,” then follow such and such a procedure. But apart fromlater evidence, it is a quite straightforward observation to say that spellsand curses are the expression of someone’s intention to harm or otherwiseinfluence their victim. What Plato acutely observes is the reinforcementmechanism of magic as it pertains to intention. If I see a wax figurine onthe tomb of my ancestor, whether I believe the figurine to be efficacious,I nonetheless now know that some enemy of mine intends to harm me,perhaps through evoking the soul of my dead ancestor. What I do not knowis exactly how, beyond the physical evidence of the magic, my enemy’sintentions will manifest in my affairs, and that is where the crux lies.One of the most perceptive recent analyses of volitional cause as it appliesto magic has been made by the anthropologist Alfred Gell. In the follow-ing quirky example, Gell explains how volitional cause can subsume, forinstance, multiple physical causes, and still emerge as the socially salientexplanation for a given event:69Magic is possible because intentions cause events to happen in the vicinityof agents, but this is a different species of causation from the kind of causa-tion involved in the rising and setting of the sun, or the falling of Newton’sapple, etc. For instance: here before me is this boiled egg. What has causedthe egg to be boiled? Clearly, there are two quite different answers to this –(i) because it was heated in a saucepan of water over a gas-flame, or (ii) becauseI, off my own bat, chose to bestir myself, take the egg from its box, fill thesaucepan, light the gas, and boil the egg, because I wanted breakfast. Fromany practical point of view, type-(ii) ‘causes’ of eggs being boiled are infin-itely more salient than type-(i) causes. If there were no breakfast-desiringagents like me about, there would be no hens’ eggs...no saucepans, no gas appliances, and the whole egg-boiling phenomenon would never transpire and never need to be physically explained. So, whatever the verdict of physics, the real causal explanationfor why there are any boiledeggs is that I, and other breakfasters, intendthat boiled eggs should exist.Greek magic, whether in the form of Plato’s figurines and spells or the reli-gious specialists’ acts of purification, is performed with the intention ofrealizing the practitioner’s aims. But it is not sufficient in analyzingmagic, as Plato implies, to recognize ‘what has happened’ in terms of phys-ical causes and leave it at that, because physical causes can ultimately follow from intentional causes. In Plato’s example the molded waxfigurines are visible reminders to ‘those who are suspicious of oneanother about such things’ that harmful intentions have been expressed.Multiple causes, which can be visible and invisible as well as separated inspace and time, have the potential to overlap to produce the same event.9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 48"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"A Framework for Greek Magic49This means that when some misfortune does occur for the person whobelieves himself to be the target of the figurine, other visible, immediate,and physical causes of the misfortune may be compatible with and expli-cable in terms of the harmful intentions of the adversary who made thefigurine or had it made.This point is worth stressing: magic in the Greek world is possiblebecause physical causes are not excluded by intentional causes. Becauseintentional explanations are socially salient and therefore more relevantin the determination of responsibility, they can, on the contrary, subsumephysical causes. A good example of how this works can be found towardthe end of the Roman Republic in Cicero’s Brutus, in which the effects of a basically Greek binding spell are described.70The event happened during a trial in the 70sbceafter Cicero had finished his defense of a woman named Titinia. He recalls that the opposing counsel, a mannamed Gnaeus Sicinius, suddenly forgot his entire case and blamed hislapse of memory on the spells (veneficia) and incantations (cantiones) ofthat same Titinia.71The point to stress here in this example is that the sociallyrelevant explanation of Titinia’s magic takes precedence, even when a moreobvious physical explanation, such as fatigue or some other immediate andvisible cause, might have been found.Greek MagiciansIt is within this kind of complex aetiological framework that we have tosituate the activities of our veritable cast of Greek magical characters, themagicians (magoi), purifiers (kathartai), beggar-priests (agurtai), seers(manteis), and outright charlatans (alazones) named by the author of Onthe Sacred Diseaseand Plato. Much light has recently been shed on thisgroup and the research shows that, with the possible exception of the magoi,apart from what has already been said, there is no clearcut way to dis-tinguish their magical activities. Indeed, it is not even clear from theHippocratic and Platonic descriptions that the terms for these individu-als were used exclusively, since seers could perform purifications like the purifiers and magicians, and all of these individuals were apparentlyitinerant and scrappy in generating their own business interests like the beggar-priests. Frankly, they might all be characterized as religiousentrepreneurs, offering their services to rich and poor alike who were look-ing to solve problems they otherwise could not through traditional temple cults and physicians.The term ‘charlatans’ (alazones) described any number of quacks andbraggarts, boasters and false pretenders in the ancient world, but apart9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 49"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"50A Framework for Greek Magicfrom the general characteristic of deception it offers nothing distinctiveto magic. In the context of On the Sacred Disease, the term is pejorativeand general. The beggar-priests (agurtai) form an interesting category ofmendicant vagabond, often from Asia Minor, who sometimes claimedprophetic ability. In Aeschylus’ Agamemnon, for example, the Trojanprincess Cassandra, who has been granted the gift of prophecy by Apollobut who is forever condemned to have her advice ignored, in some waystypifies the stereotype of the agurtBs. Although adorned with the pro-fessional garb of the seer (mantis), she frets that she may be a false seer(pseudomantis), that she is called a wandering agurtBs, a beggar going fromdoor to door trying to hawk false visions.72Other groups of agurtai(knowntechnically as mBtragurtaiand mBnagurtai) who may be relevant are thedevotees of Rhea or Cybele, the Mother of the Gods, whom we havealready seen could be invoked in Attic curse tablets. These groups ori-ginated in Phrygia, moved in bands, and were known for their ecstatic ravings and the tintinabular sounds emanating from their raucous worship of the goddess.73In the few accounts that survive of these worshippers, however, there is little that we can discern having directly to do with magic, although as cult devotees they no doubt proclaimed some privileged relationship with the Mother of the Gods herself.Seers or manteisform another heterogeneous group, but in the classi-cal period manteiswho were attached to temples and to armies formed aprofessional class of seer.74The Pythia or priestess at Delphi, for example,was a mantiswho inherited her position at the temple and occupied it forlife. Military seers such as the famous Tisamenos and Hegesistratos fromElis, over whom Spartans struggled to obtain their services,75are alsostandard examples of the professional seer. These military seers wereknown for their ability to interpret the entrails of sacrificed animals, espe-cially those of oxen, sheep, and goats, with the aim of announcingwhether the gods favored a course of military action or not. As might beexpected, the manner in which this was done was complex and involvedinterpreting signs on animal livers, such as any deformation of the lobesor discoloration, interpreting the health of the entrails generally, diviningfrom the flow of the animal’s blood after sacrifice, and placing the ani-mal’s bladder in a fire to divine the god’s intentions from the manner inwhich it inflated and burst.76There were other forms of divination inwhich these professional manteisengaged, such as interpreting the flightpatterns and cries of birds, but their sacrificial expertise is what prin-cipally defined them. It is important to recall here that purification throughbloodshed was one of the manteis’ activities which aggravated the authorof On the Sacred Disease. Whatever the rationale behind their use ofbloodshed in purifying epileptic patients, it is consistently to their facility9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 50"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"A Framework for Greek Magic51in sacrifice and divination from the sacrificial animal’s innards and bloodtoward which the evidence for manteispoints.The professional class of seer is sometimes difficult to distinguish fromthe itinerant mantiswho wandered from city to city offering their servicesfor hire, but it is generally the latter group in whom we are most inter-ested. About these itinerant manteiswe hear occasionally that they mis-appropriated their lineage in an attempt to distinguish themselves, as inthe example of Deiphonus from Ionian Apollonia, the seer who sacrificedon behalf of the Greek forces at Mycale before a battle in 480bce.77Deiphonus was said to be the son of a renowned seer, Euenius, fromApollonia, but Herodotus reports that, according to what he has heard,Deiphonus’ parentage is suspect and that he has gained work all over Greeceowing to this false claim to be the son of Euenius. It is hard to infer fromthe evidence whether this sort of career was typical, but the balance of historical and literary evidence suggests that itinerant manteiswereresourceful and unscrupulous, and that they preyed upon the gullible.However, despite the fact that some of our sources (such as Aristophanes)stereotype and ridicule the traveling manteis, they seem nevertheless tohave carried on an active trade and to have made themselves indispens-able even to the wealthier strata of society. Contrary to the impression thatour sources sometimes give of their illegitimacy, it is almost certain thatthese manteishad a modicum of education and could read, since sourceslike Plato attest that they used texts containing oracular poetry of the kindascribed to Musaeus and the mythical poet Orpheus.78It is probably to beinferred therefore that, in the face of limited Athenian literacy, the itiner-ant manteiswere able through their privileged access to arcane materialto exert some hold over the imagination of their clients.79The purifiers or kathartai, like the manteis, also formed a group that canbe divided into those who enjoyed professional status and those who, lesslegitimately, emerged in the midst of crisis to offer their services. Severalof the more dignified kathartaiwere quite famous, and stories both his-torical and mythological abound of their purifying individuals of illnessand madness, and of purifying whole cities in the aftermath of sacrilegiousactivities. Melampus, a famous archaic age seer, was known for having curedthe mythical Proetus and his daughters using a squill, sulphur, pitch, andseawater.80In the latter half of the seventh centurybce, the Athenian noble-man Cylon along with some of his friends seized the Acropolis in Athenswith a view toward tyranny. The Athenians attacked and, although Cylonhimself escaped, some of his friends were killed at an altar, which violatedthe sacred immunity granted to suppliants seeking refuge at altars. Hencearose the famous curse (agos) and pollution on the Athenians, which theprestigious Epimenides of Crete was brought in to remove.81Epimenides9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 51"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"52A Framework for Greek Magicwas known to have purified several city-states, and it was said that he couldpurify people through rites from any damage whatsoever, physical ormental, and that he could even determine the cause of the damage. Thereis also evidence that Epimenides was a seer,82a point that once again rein-forces the care that must be taken with the sometimes hazy boundariessuch terms as ‘seer’ and ‘purifier’ denote. The activities of one easilybleed into those of another. In any event, unlike the kathartaimentionedin On the Sacred Disease, our evidence for Epimenides is on the whole without taint of illegitimacy or amateurism.The purifier Empedocles of Acragas (ca. 492– 432bce) deserves a special mention. He too was above the moral reproach reserved for theitinerant purifiers in On the Sacred Diseaseand in the historical record.Born of a distinguished family, accomplished in rhetoric, and ardently demo-cratic, Empedocles composed the poems On Natureand Purifications(Katharmoi), presumably the remains of one poem,83and a prose workon Medicine. His magical feats (goBteia) were said to have been witnessedby perhaps his most famous student, Gorgias of Leontini, whose ownthoughts on magic we will encounter later.84Empedocles’ poetry in par-ticular attests to a dignified reputation as a healer. To give some idea ofhow publicly well known his poetry was, we hear from more than one sourcethat his Purificationswere performed by a rhapsode at the Olympicgames,85and that during this visit no one was more talked about than himin social circles.86Strikingly, though, within his poems he claims to be cap-able of transforming the natural order in virtually the same terms as theitinerant purifiers in On the Sacred Diseaseare said to have done. We recallthat the Hippocratic author described the claims of the religious expertsin the following way:87If they claim to know how to draw down the moon and eclipse the sun, tomake storms and fair weather, rain and drought, the sea impassable and theearth barren, and all other things of such kind – whether they claim to knowthese things from rites or from some other knowledge or practice . . .In one of the most famous fragments of Empedocles, he writes:88You shall learn all the remedies (pharmaka) that there are for ills anddefense against old age, since for you alone I will accomplish all this. Andyou shall stay the force of the unwearied winds which sweep over the earthand lay waste the fields with their blasts; and then, if you wish, you shall bringback breezes in requital. After black rain you shall cause drought for men indue season, and then after summer drought causing air-inhabiting andtree-nourishing streams. And you shall bring from Hades the life force of a dead man.899781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 52"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"A Framework for Greek Magic53Both of these descriptions of abilities involve reversing or changing the orderof nature, to the extent at least that making storms and fair weather,drawing down the moon, or drawing back the life force of a dead man90involve altering nature’s course. It turns out that astronomical magic ofthis sort was also the stock-in-trade of magical stereotypes on theAthenian stage. In Aristophanes’ Clouds, for example, it is said that any-one can readily purchase the services of a witch (pharmakis) fromThessaly, a region in northern Greece that was famous in antiquity for beingthe birthplace of, and commercial center for, witches. Their servicesinclude drawing down the moon and creating an eclipse, andAristophanes regards this upset state of affairs as an opportunity for theunscrupulous to avoid paying their burdensome debts.91Empedocles’magical claims in the passage above, especially his knowledge of pharmakathat defend against old age and the returning of a man’s life force fromHades, are somewhat out of line with the claims made by the itinerant specialists. But on the other hand, it is important to bear in mind that our evidence for their claims depends almost exclusively on the author ofOn the Sacred Disease, Plato, and literary sources. If it is argued thatEmpedocles’ claim that he knows how to lead back the ‘life force of a deadman’ is another way of saying that he can ‘evoke the souls of the dead’(psukhagDgein), as Plato reports about the itinerant specialists,92thentogether with his weather and astronomical magic, and above all hisexpertise in purification, Empedocles may reasonably be regarded as anexemplary religious specialist, perhaps on the order of a shaman.93Nor did Plato and the Hippocratic authors regard Empedocles asmerely one among the rabble of itinerant religious specialists. To the con-trary, both drew from his writings on nature and Empedocles’ four ‘roots’(earth, air, fire, and water – themselves embedded in the excerpt of his poetryabove in the references to the earth, winds, summer drought, and rain andstreams94) formed the basis of humoural theory in Hippocratic medicine.This is quite a striking state of affairs, actually, because we have at leastone report that Empedocles treated a patient named Pantheia whom thephysicians were unable to treat successfully.95There are thus clear hintsof rivalry between professional physicians and the religious specialists who,if we are to believe our sources, as a rule garnered a lesser repute. But apartfrom his social and intellectual status, there is no clearcut way to distin-guish Empedocles’ self-proclaimed magical abilities from those of theanonymous, wandering specialists.96Nor is it quite right to see in the ear-lier, archaic age purifier/seer, of the type exemplified by Melampus andEpimenides, a more ample repertoire of which only the ‘manipulative’aspects of purification were inherited by the specialists decried in the writings of the Hippocratic author and Plato.97As we have seen, the 9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 53"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"54A Framework for Greek Magicspecialists’ procedures for divining the god or goddess responsible for an epileptic seizure are fully worthy to be called mantic. Moreover,Empedocles himself was considered a mantisand he is said to haveearned this reputation when he sent away a dead woman alive. In a lateraccount attributed to Heraclides of Pontus, we are told that for thirty daysEmpedocles kept a woman breathless and in a trance, her body withoutpulsation – and therefore to all intents and purposes ‘dead’ – and then herevived her.98For that reason he earned the name of mantis, in additionto that of physician. We might add that such a feat also clearly resemblesshamanic activity as found, for example, in Central Asia.99It is not quiteclear on the basis of which activity he earned the title of seer, except tothe extent that manteiswere known to communicate with the dead andevoke their souls (psukhagDgein). We have then in the accounts ofEmpedocles evidence for a set of technical skills which, while extraordi-nary, are not radically different than those of the anonymous and less sociallydistinguished religious specialists also called seers and purifiers.MagoiThe one name to which Empedocles did not lay claim, despite the reportsof his nearly divine status and his own suicidal efforts to confirm that reputation by diving into the fiery craters of Mt. Etna, was that of magos(μiγος) or magician.100The term and its family derive from the Old Per-sian name for priest magu- (nom. maguF) and is etymologically related to Avestan moγu-, which seems to have meant ‘(member of a) tribe’.101Magosand its sphere of application have received much attention fromscholars because it is the basis, by way of Latin magus, of our term‘magic’.102Properly the term mageiarefers to the activity of a magos,magikosis the related adjective, while the terms manganeuein‘to use ofcharms/trickery’, manganon‘charm/philter’, mageuein‘to be a magos/use magic arts’, mageumata‘charms, spells’ and related terms are allderivative. Given the range of Empedocles’ activities and the fluidity of allthe terms considered so far, there is of course no very good reason whyhe should not have been called a magos, since his knowledge of weathermagic and reported ability to evoke the dead make him remarkably similar to the skills attributed to Persian magi, who comprised from theviewpoint of the Greeks a significant and respected group of religious specialists.The central problem with the philological history of the term magosandits derivatives is that they tell us little to nothing directly about the activ-ities performed by this kind of individual. Moreover, when the Greeks were9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 54"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"A Framework for Greek Magic55not speaking explicitly about Persian magoi, who were the servants of thePersian king and his empire and from whom the Greeks borrowed the termmagos, their use of the term in the fifth centurybceregularly connotes charlatanry and deception, usually for personal gain. To give some ideaof this unhelpful state of affairs, let us turn to the often-quoted firstinstance of magosin Greek. The attestation in question is found inHeraclitus of Ephesus (late sixth centurybce) but because it is reportedby a later author, Clement of Alexandria (early third century ce), it is unclearhow much of the passage is original. According to Clement, then, Heraclitusis reported to have prophesied that a punishment by fire awaited ‘thosewho wander in the night: magoi, bacchants, maenads, initiates’103becausethese individuals improperly initiated others into the mysteries. There areanachronisms in the wording here of the terms for Dionysiac worshippers,bacchants and maenads, that have caused some scholars to doubt theauthenticity of the fragment, but Heraclitus’ characterization of magoiisclearly negative. It is not as clear whether the magosin this passage refersto Persian magoi, although that may be a reasonable inference given thatEphesus was under Persian control in the time of Heraclitus and Persiaalready had, by the middle of the sixth centurybce, begun to expand westinto Asia Minor.104But the main problem from our point of view is that,even if we accept that magoiwere associated with private cults and performed initiations that were out of line with mainstream civic cult, asHeraclitus suggests, we still learn next to nothing of what they actually did.It is above all in fifth-century Greek tragedy where we find referencesto the dubious, non-Persian magosknown stereotypically for his skull-duggery and avarice. Some of this evidence accords remarkably well withwhat we find in On the Sacred Disease and Plato. The most commonexample comes from Sophocles’ Oedipus Tyrannos, datable toward the lastquarter of the fifth century. When Oedipus begins to suspect that Creonand his court seer, the famously blind Teiresias, are collaborating to over-throw him, he denounces Teiresias as a magos, a weaver of plots, and acrafty beggar-priest (agurtBs) who only has sight when it comes toprofit.105The association between magosand agurtBsis exactly that madeby the author of On the Sacred Disease,106which attests in my view to thewide nature of this stereotype. It is also in this context that Oedipus men-tions the ‘envy’ or ‘malice’ (phthonos) of Teiresias107as the driving forcebehind his presumed political ambition. This term, phthonos, is often asso-ciated in Greek literature with magic and has led at least one scholar toargue that envy is therefore its principal motivation.108I am very sympa-thetic to this view, inasmuch as rivalry and personal ambition are frequentlyassociated with certain types of magical accusations, such as thoseinvolving curse tablets, although it reveals next to nothing about why magic9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 55"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"56A Framework for Greek Magictakes the shape that it does for the Greeks. However, recognizing that envy,malice, or ill-will (all covered by the term phthonos) play an important rolein magical accusations gives us another way to demonstrate how magicis situated within an intentional context, defined by social relations.There are other examples of magosand related terms deployed within Greektragedy with the same range of associations as those in the OedipusTyrannos. None of these references adds anything substantial, however,to the view that these so-named individuals were suspected of abusing theirprivileged relationship with divinity for private rather than public gain.The deceptive uses to which magic was put by magoiin tragedy havelittle in common with the activities of Persian priests, or the magi proper,who worshipped fire, sacrificed, chanted, sang theogonies, interpreteddreams and solar eclipses, and performed numerous other religious rites.Our source for most of these references to the early Persian magoiisHerodotus, but there are important if scattered references in other histo-rians and philosophers of the fifth and fourth centuriesbce.109With theexception of three ritual events mentioned by Herodotus, the balance ofevidence suggests that the Greeks regarded the activities of this Persianpriestly class as more or less legitimate in contrast to how they viewed theactivities of a Teiresias or an anonymous beggar-priest. But the meaningof three ritual events appears less transparent to Herodotus, and may giveus insight into where Greek notions of religious piety diverged fromPersian. First, in a passage that describes the march of the Persian kingXerxes and his forces westward to the river Strymon in Thrace, Herodotustells us that the Persians paused there and the magoimade a bloodsacrifice of white horses to obtain good omens.110This sacrifice is on a parwith the typical activities of the Greek military seer, although the contextand the language used by Herodotus do not permit us to say with accu-racy whether divination from horse entrails or some other type of divina-tion was involved. The Greeks, for instance, did not divine from horseentrails. What is interesting is that Herodotus refers to this sacrifice by theverb pharmakeuD(from pharmakon‘drug, spell’), which is used else-where regularly in Greek to connote ‘magic’ in the sense in which, for exam-ple, the author of On the Sacred Diseaseand Plato criticize magic.111It isnot clear whether Herodotus is unconvinced of the religious legitimacy ofthis rite, or whether he employs the verb because he is influenced by hisown preconceptions about Greek magic. But his next example appears toraise further questions.After the sacrifice at the river Strymon, the Persians passed over to anEdonian town named the Nine Ways. Learning that this was the name ofthe town owing to the number of bridges thrown across it, the magoithenfor some inexplicable reason buried alive there nine boys and maidens taken9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 56"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"A Framework for Greek Magic57from among the people of the country.112It must have struck Herodotusthat this rite would appear unusual to his Greek audience, because at thispoint he says that burying people alive is a Persian custom. However, thereis no confirmation from elsewhere that the Persians buried peoplealive.113Herodotus then proceeds to tell a story he has heard that whenXerxes’ wife Amestris reached old age, she buried fourteen sons ofnotable Persians as a thank offering on her behalf to the god of the under-world.114The Greeks themselves had their own, largely fantastic, ideas abouthuman sacrifice, but it remains an open question whether Herodotusregards the sacrificial rites of the magi in this instance as suspect. Nor canthe veracity of Herodotus’ account be taken for granted, since it appearsthat these sacrificial acts called for some qualification.Finally, there is the account of the violent storm produced by the northwind, which the Greeks called Boreas, that lasted three days and shipwreckedthe Persians near the promontory of Sepias, on the coast of Magnesia inThessaly.115Herodotus reports that this storm destroyed upward of 400 ships,and the wreckage caused so much merchandise – including corn, gold andsilver drinking cups, and many other Persian treasures – to be cast ashorethat the Persians built a high fence around their spoils to protect them.After three days of the storm with no relief, the magoisacrificed to the dead(entoma) and sang incantations (kataeidontes) to appease the wind withthe help of magicians (goBsi), then they sacrificed to the sea nymphsThetis and the Nereids. As far as incantations to control the wind andsacrifices to divinities who control the sea, the Persian magic seems similar to what we have seen with the religious specialists in On the SacredDiseaseand Empedocles. But the entomaor sacrifice to the dead deservesfurther exploration. Herodotus uses the term entomain one other placein his work, in a context similar to this one, when he tells the story ofMenelaus’ visit to Egypt and the storm there that prevented him from leaving. To overcome the bad weather, Menelaus committed an unholyact: we are told that he surreptitiously took two Egyptian children andsacrificed them as an entoma, or offering to the dead, to control theweather.116Although we cannot be sure that the Persian magoiperformedhuman sacrifice at Sepias, their apparent proclivity for it as we have seenin other accounts at least supports the possibility.117Whether any of thisPersian magic was effective is then called into question by Herodotus. Hesays that on the fourth day the storm ceased, or ‘perhaps it abated of itsown accord’. In these three instances, then, which all involve sacrifices notconsidered typical by the Greeks, Herodotus hints that he may not beentirely convinced of the legitimacy of Persian magic. Such a view is, of course, quite different than openly assuming that magoiof the likes of a Teiresias or an itinerant specialist are charlatans, and clearly for9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 57"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"58A Framework for Greek MagicHerodotus most of what the Persian magoido is above reproach. On thewhole, throughout antiquity the Persian magoiwere positively valued bythe Greeks as religious experts who practiced magic. But they do notreally emerge as a group in whom the Greeks are particularly interestedfor their magical affiliations until after the Persian War of 480bce, and theydo not become firmly branded as magicians by the Greeks until the finaldecades of the fifth century.118Gorgias, Mageiaand GobteiaThe term mageia, meaning on the one hand the ‘activity of a magos’ and,on the other, ‘magic’ in the looser sense defined by the author of On theSacred Diseaseand Plato, first emerges in the fifth century. But when notused directly of Persian magoi, such as the famed Zoroaster, the term mageiais surprisingly devoid of any distinctive meaning in itself. In turn, what weare able to say about mageiadepends on the magical activities, such assacrifice, purification, and incantation, which are apparently covered bythat term. The earliest known instance of mageiacan be found in the lat-ter half of the fifth century in Gorgias of Leontini’s (ca. 485 –380bce)Encomium of Helen, a work that attempts to rehabilitate Helen’s reputa-tion for treachery in the Trojan War. Gorgias was a very influential rhetorand sophist, whose oratorical style commonly lent itself to parody by hiscontemporaries, but he interests us mainly because of his pedigree in magic.Gorgias was said to be the pupil of Empedocles, and he is said to have wit-nessed the magical feats (goBteia) of his teacher.119These experiencesmust be held to account as we look more closely at Gorgias’ own con-ceptualization of magic.In the Encomium of Helen, Gorgias offers several reasons for Helen’sdeception and betrayal of the Greeks when she absconded with theTrojan prince, Paris. It could have been caused, he argues, by fate, the will of the gods, the decrees of necessity, or that she was carried off by barbaric force. But if it was speech that persuaded her, then this callsfor an altogether different explanation. Speech in Gorgias’ view – and weshall not miss his rhetorical interest here – persuades the soul, and wordsare incantations (epDidai) that can produce pleasure and avert grief.Filled with divinity, words can deceive and compel the soul to do thingsit otherwise would not through magic (goBteia). He then says that two typesof magic have been invented, mageiaand goBteia, both of which areerrors and deceptions of the soul. The term goBteia, which we havealready seen used several times earlier in the passages on magic from Plato and in reference to Empedocles’ practices, technically refers to the activity of another common Greek term for ‘magician’, goBs. The9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 58"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"A Framework for Greek Magic59philological history of goBssuggests that originally the term referred to aspecialist in one type of lamentation for the dead, called goös.120It has been plausibly suggested that the goBswas skilled precisely in invoking thespirits of the dead, and although this characteristic cannot always be felt,in some authors such as Plato a good case can be made that such a dis-tinction is still relevant.121Later sources seem to take for granted that goBteiarefers exclusively to invocation of the dead.122But in Gorgias there isnothing to suggest that he understood invocation of the dead to underliegoBteia, rendering it altogether possible that already in the latter half ofthe fifth century, at least in some contexts, no such distinction in mean-ing was relevant. Both magosand goBs, moreover, are roughly inter-changeable terms of abuse in Greek rhetoric, approximating somethingon the order of ‘scoundrel’.123As he develops his case for how the soul is influenced by speech,Gorgias appeals to another magical analogy that is revealing for its con-nection to Empedocles in a way that has not been noticed by scholars. Hedescribes this in the following way:124The power of speech over the disposition of the soul is like the dispositionof drugs (pharmaka) over the nature of the body. Just as different drugs driveout different humours from the body, and put an end either to disease or tolife, so with speech: some words produce harm, others pleasure, others fear,while still others can embolden their listeners. Or again, by means of someharmful persuasion, words can bewitch (pharmakeuein) and thoroughlycast a spell (ekgoBteuein) over the soul.The term pharmakon(plural pharmaka) to which Gorgias refers was notor-iously ambiguous in Greek, because its range of meaning covered helpful‘medicine’, harmful ‘poison’, as well as magical ‘drug’ or ‘philter’, all ofwhich were plant-based concoctions with sometimes active psychotropicingredients.125In the context of magic, it is the pharmakonand its effectson the body to which Plato referred, as we saw earlier, when he mentionedthe drinks, foods, or unguents that cause ‘harm by means of matteragainst matter according to nature’.126The noun pharmakongave rise toseveral other terms in Greek related to magic, including the noun phar-makeia‘magic’ and the verb pharmakeuein‘bewitch’ above, that we willencounter in due course. For the moment suffice it to note that, in the con-text of Gorgias’ remarks, he clearly intends the basic, medical meaning ofpharmakonas well as the magical one.What has been overlooked in this passage, however, is that Gorgias’ pharmaceutical analogy for how the persuasion of speech works comesdirectly from the realm of purification, complete with a reference to the humours that are driven out from the body in the process. In the9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 59"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"60A Framework for Greek MagicHippocratic treatises more than one theory of the humours was in circu-lation. However, the four basic humours (Gr. χυμοK, Lat. humores) – blood,phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile – which in turn corresponded toEmpedocles’ four ‘roots’ or elements – earth, water, fire, and air – are prob-ably what Gorgias has in mind here.127For this perspective Gorgias has eitherhis education under Empedocles to thank, or perhaps his teacher’s writings such as the Purifications. The purification analogy is fleshed out by Gorgias in other remarks in the Encomium, when he compares howthe soul is impressed by sight, just as it can be impressed by speech.Whatever is in the soul prior to a frightful sighting, for example courage,at the sight of an enemy in war is displaced or driven out by fear as if thedanger were already present.128We are to infer that words and their abilityto generate powerful emotions operate on the soul in an analogousway.129Although we cannot be absolutely certain on this point, I am sug-gesting that the basic procedure of purification was intrinsic to Gorgias’notions of magic. Along these lines, it may be of some interest thatalthough Gorgias uses three different terms for magic, pharmakeia,goBteia, and mageia, the term pharmakeiaand its related terms phar-makonand the verb pharmakeueinare regularly used in Hippocraticmedical vocabulary specifically to refer to purgatives and purgation.130Purificatory remedies that involve purgation are central to the overalltheme in Hippocratic medicine that recognizes purification as an essen-tial restorative process for the body.131The Hippocratic term for‘purification’ is katharsis, and its verb kathairein‘to purify’ is from the sameroot that gives us the term for the itinerant purifier, kathartBs, who wasso ardently attacked by the author of On the Sacred Disease. Thus there isan inherent ambiguity in both the pharmakonand katharsisfamily of termsbetween medical and magical purgation and purification, and this ambi-guity could well be at the crux of the Hippocratic author’s professional disagreement with the religious specialists.132In other words the conflictarises over the correct aetiology of epilepsy, not over the conventional prac-tice of purification.133In any case, Gorgias’ analogy between the effects ofspeech on the soul and magic works only if it is purificatory magic that isat issue. And he is as likely to share his understanding of purification withthe author of On the Sacred Diseaseas he is to share it with the experi-ence and writings of his teacher, Empedocles.Other Magical TermsIn terms of our understanding of magic, Gorgias’ Encomium of Helendemonstrates that by the late fifth centurybce, no fundamental distinc-9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 60"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"A Framework for Greek Magic61tion was made between the terms pharmakeia(as instanced by his use of pharmakon, pharmakeuein), mageia, and goBteia.134This is why it hasbeen so important in developing a framework for Greek magic to empha-size the practices and implements associated with it rather than to relyon terminology alone. If anything, it is the fluidity of the whole range ofGreek magical vocabulary that draws attention, although some termsretained a certain classical flavor more than others. The balance of ter-minology that we have yet to consider can be dealt with in fairly short order.From the ambiguous term pharmakon, in its magical not medical aspect,we derive in Greek the nouns pharmakis‘witch’, pharmakeus‘sorcerer’(both of which terms simply refer to practitioners of magic who arefemale and male, respectively), the abstract noun pharmakeia, and the verbpharmakeuein. In many of the passages that we have seen, beginning withOn the Sacred Disease, magical practitioners are said to cast spells orincantations (epDidai, singular epDidB). The term epDidB‘charm/incan-tation’ literally means a ‘song sung over or against’, and in turn this very common word for incantation gives rise to the verbs epaeidein, kataei-dein, both of which mean basically ‘to charm’, and the noun epDidos‘enchanter’. Although used mainly of magical practitioners, we have seenfor instance in Plato that even physicians can occasionally have incan-tations at their disposal.135But in some contexts, as we might expect, epDidoscan be used interchangeably with goBsin the abusive sense of ‘charlatan’.136And goBsin turn, as we have seen, can be used interchangeablywith magosto denote a fraud or deceiver. The term goBs, whatever its original association with invocations of the dead, is the one term that wellinto the Roman imperial period continued to connote charlatanry, evenas it connoted magic. As has been pointed out by others, there is somelate evidence that goBsand goBteiawere considered more Attic – in otherwords more classically Greek – than magos.137This perception in conjunctionwith the generally positive reputation enjoyed by Persian magoimay explainwhy the complex of magos-related terms never achieved the same cur-rency among Greeks in later centuries as its borrowed forms did amongRomans.138The Romans did not share this same prejudice and, as a result,used the terms magus/a‘magician’, magia‘magic’, magicus‘magical’with much greater frequency.139As examples, Catullus (ca. 84 –54bce)140and Cicero (106 – 43bce)141first use magusto refer to the Persian magi. Vergil(70 –19bce) first uses the adjective magicusin his Eclogues142and uses, in his great epic the Aeneid, the more imaginative term magicae artes‘magical arts’.143This term magicae artes‘magical arts’ is adopted bymany authors in late antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the early modern period as a term of art. Although its underlying conception changed ratherdramatically over that time, our modern term ‘magic’ owes its origin to 9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 61"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"62A Framework for Greek Magicthe Latin forms used in this stretch of Roman history between the late republican and early imperial periods.ConclusionIn rounding out our framework for understanding Greek magic primarilyin the classical period, it is important to emphasize the balance that mustbe struck between the philological history of the most common terms for magic, and the few descriptions we have of actual practices. Thesedescriptions include purification, blood sacrifices, invocation of the dead,the writing of curse tablets and binding spells (katadesmoi), the use ofcharms (epDidai) and drugs (pharmaka), and the fabrication of waxfigurines. Claims attributed to magicians, on the other hand, are muchbroader and include drawing down the moon, eclipsing the sun, control-ling the weather, and, in the unique case of Empedocles, resisting the onsetof old age and drawing back the life force of the dead. The most trans-parent descriptions of magical practices from this period are in On the SacredDiseaseand Plato; however, in both cases the descriptions are partiallyclouded by the authors’ own biases against the legitimacy, largely on the-ological grounds, of magic. More specifically, it is the implied theology ofthe magicians, as Fritz Graf144originally showed, that is under attack bythe Hippocratic author and Plato, according to which the magician’sactions apparently entail control over divinity. But as I hope to haveshown, in the case of On the Sacred Disease the author actually miscon-strues the degree to which the specialists’ ritual diagnoses and responsesto an epileptic invasion by a divinity are appropriate – and appropriatelydeferential. Such an implied errant theology was further skewed away fromconventional religious thinking in the works of Empedocles, who, unlikethe itinerant specialists with whom he can readily be compared, actuallyclaimed he was a god.145For whatever reason, what would probably havebeen considered borderline heterodoxy from a traditional Greek religiouspoint of view did not prevent either the Hippocratic authors or Plato fromadopting Empedocles’ theory of the basic four cosmological elements.Nevertheless, we owe to this clash of perspectives in the late fifth and earlyfourth centuries between the physicians and philosophers and theirmagico-religious adversaries whom they chose to attack the first attemptsto define Greek magic as an intellectual construct. The attempts are ten-dentious, to be sure, and it is still not altogether clear whether it is mag-ical practices per sethat are under scrutiny, or the specialists operatingoutside the mainstream services offered by official civic cult and academicmedicine who should properly bear the brunt of their criticism.9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 62"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"A Framework for Greek Magic63In contrast to the intellectual defense of religious piety, Plato also pro-poses a psychological theory to explain the perceived efficacy of magic.While his views offer some insight into the mindset of his contemporaries,they seem to do little justice to the complex causal view which the Greeksheld, according to which divine and human causes could produce iden-tical effects in the world. Because sudden, unpredictable events could have multiple and invisible causes, and certain types of magic such aspurification or curse tablets actually relied on divine intervention fortheir efficacy, it was difficult to know in any given circumstance the exactcombination of divine and human causes that were responsible. In thisrespect, the invisible world was more important to the Greeks than the visible one, and misfortune for which an immediate and tangible causecould be found did not necessarily take precedence over an invisible andmagical one. Moreover, the causes of magical action that were perceivedas salient were primarily social, as Plato already realized. Magic expressessocial tension by other means, and although it incorporates physicalcauses within it, magic is fundamentally given meaning by a network ofsocial relations. ‘Social’ here needs to be broadly understood to includenot only the living, but, as Lévy-Bruhl showed, also the extended, invisiblecommunity of divinities, daimones, and the dead with whom the living interact and participate. As we shall see next in the case of curse tablets,as long as the intentions of the living can be made to converge with thoseof the divine, daemonic, and dead, magic remains a vital avenue for theachievement of practical aims.9781405132381_4_002.qxd 30/10/2007 12:11 Page 63"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3Binding Magic and EroticFigurines1212121Among the most widely employed kinds of magic in Greek and, later, Romanantiquity is binding magic. The majority of the evidence we will survey inthis chapter is culturally Greek, but because binding magic extendschronologically from the classical period to later Roman antiquity, it willbe important also to consider material dated throughout the Romanimperial period. A brief consideration of Roman curses will help us to dis-tinguish the implied forms of torture in Greek and Roman spells. Finally,we will consider the role of figurines in binding and erotic magic, and Iwill attempt to contextualize the use of erotic figurines within wider Greekand Roman attitudes toward statuary.Binding magic takes two forms: (1) a binding spell or curse, written ona variety of media, including wax, potsherds, and commonly thin sheetsor tablets of lead, which are then rolled or folded and sometimes piercedwith a nail; and (2) a figurine, often made of wax, clay, wool, occasionallylead and bronze, and very rarely marble, roughly approximating the formof a man or woman whose limbs can be bound or twisted. The figurinessometimes have nails or needles pressed into them, or are sometimes buriedin “coffins” made from thin sheets of lead. The term bindingrefers to theGreek term κατIδεσμος‘binding curse’ (katadesmos, plural katadesmoi)used by authors such as Plato to label this kind of magic.1Scholars oftenuse the Latin equivalent, defixio(plural defixiones), to refer to binding spellswritten on tablets.2The notion of binding can also be found in the lan-guage written on the tablets themselves, which often expressly state thedesired action through the use of verbs such as katadein‘to bind’ andkatekhein‘to restrain’. Furthermore, the metaphor of binding can be visibly illustrated by the folding, rolling up, and piercing of the com-monly found lead tablet. In the case of the figurines, the metaphor of binding is achieved through the literal twisting, binding, and piercing 9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 64"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Binding Magic and Erotic Figurines65of the figurines with nails. Although a basic binding formula is standard,the binding spells have been divided by scholars into thematic groups thatdeal with competition in the realm of athletics, drama, forensic affairs, orbusiness;3with erotic matters including sex and marriage; and with pleasfor revenge or justice.4The earliest binding spells found in the form of lead tablets date to thebeginning of the fifth centurybce. They are found throughout Greek andRoman antiquity for the next thousand years, from areas such as RomanBritain to Sicily, Greece, North Africa, Egypt, the Levant, and Antioch. Inaddition to the most common medium of lead, binding spells have beenfound inscribed on potsherds, limestone, gemstones, papyri, wax, andceramic bowls, but by far the preferred medium was lead or lead alloys.5To date upwards of 1,700 curse tablets have been found, most of whichare written in Greek with a smaller number written in Latin. The usual pro-cess for fashioning a lead curse tablet involves pouring molten lead intoa mold, then hammering or scraping it into a thin sheet with a smoothsurface. The sheets are then cut into smaller tablets onto which the cursesare inscribed with a stylus made of bronze or some other hard metal.Because the range of handwriting on the tablets varies considerably, from the more controlled and elegant to the semi-literate, it has been plausibly suggested that both professional and amateur scribes wereresponsible for writing tablets – with a tilt toward professionalism espe-cially during the Roman period (first through sixth centuries, ce).6As a rule many of the earliest tablets in the fifth and fourth centuriesbce, found for example in Attica and Sicily, list only the names of theintended victim, with no additional verb for binding and no mention ofany of the divinities or daimonesthat figure more prominently in latertablets. Often the names are written in the Greek nominative (or subject)case, whereas on other tablets the names appear in the accusative (or object)case, which implies that a verb – one presumably to reference the actionof binding – was understood. Some scholars have speculated that the verbof binding was recited in an oral rite early on, which may have accom-panied the deposition of the tablet, and then only later written down, butthe evidence is silent on this hypothesis.Recent research has suggested a connection between the earliest, single-named tablets and the Athenian practice of ostracism in the classicalperiod.7Athenians could decide to hold an ostracism once a year, inwhich case the names of the persons who would be exiled were writtenon potsherds or ostraca that were then cast into a designated spot in theagora or central marketplace. If at least six thousand votes were cast, thenthe individual who obtained the most votes was exiled from Athens for aperiod of ten years. The fact that many Attic curse tablets contain the names9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 65"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"66Binding Magic and Erotic Figurinesof well-known politicians, including Demosthenes, Lycurgus, Xanthippus,Phrynichus, and many others, strongly suggests that, in addition to beingthe targets of ostracism, they were also the targets of curse tablets.8Morever, we know of several binding curses from the classical period that were written on ostraca.9Much later in antiquity, spells written onostraca are somewhat more common and there are examples in theGreek magical papyri (PGM)10which advise writing certain types of spellson ostraca.11Further research is needed to identify the exact relationshipbetween curse tablets and ostracism, but their possible connection mayindicate a magical dimension to ostracism as well as a political anddemocratic dimension to curse tablets, at least in Athens. Caution is in orderhere, however, since most ostraca do not present the name of the poten-tial exile in a backward script, as is common in curse tablets, nor can weeasily generalize the practice of ostracism in Athens to other city-statesand regions.As an example of an early and relatively simple tablet, consider the following Attic tablet, 4 by 1 cm in dimension:12ΣH ∆E ΛK I ΣΩΣs bd i e l k i s dSThe lettering spells the name of “Sdsikleidbs” backwards from right to left,and although the name is spelled backwards, the Greek letters themselvesare not reversed as in a tablet from Patissia,13in which both the name andeach letter are backwards. When both the name and letters are backwards,we get a mirror image of the name. At first glance it is not clear what theintended effect is of mirroring a victim’s name. Literate Greeks oftenwrote in a manner called boustrophedon, which referred to writing alternately from left to right and then continuing from right to left, as inthe furrows dredged by oxen in plowing. The phenomenon of backwardwriting, moreover, is also observable in Greek vase painting, where thenames and speech of individuals represented on the vase can be spelledbackwards, in accordance with whatever design is aesthetically pleasingto the painter. Thus there are several non-magical precedents for back-ward writing. Be that as it may, this does not mean that magical conno-tations could not have developed around the metaphor of backwardnessor reversal.14It has been suggested, for instance, that writing backwardsreflects the reversal of fortune the practitioner wishes his victim would experience. This is certainly plausible, except that there are variations inthe reversals that do not seem to have any rhyme or reason, at least nonethat has been detected so far. Another Attic tablet, for instance, reads, in English translation that imitates the Greek spelling:159781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 66"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Binding Magic and Erotic Figurines67esehTallI bindsbppihkrAsbteniapE, etc.‘These all I bind: Arkhippbs, Epainetbs, etc.’ Here, however, the Greek for‘these’ is spelled backwards, ‘all’ and ‘I bind’ are spelled normally, whilethe names of the victims, not all of which are represented above, are allspelled backwards. The metaphor of reversal here may have visual con-notations as well. The act of binding could be conceived as a twisting aroundor a reversal, as if one were binding another person with rope and movedover and under their body, forward and backward. For example, we havetwo late Roman curse tablets datable to the fourth century ce with draw-ings of a human entwined by ropes.16It is virtually certain that the indi-viduals portrayed on these tablets represent the victim of the curse,which suggests that the act of binding was, at least by these tabletauthors, conceived as binding with rope or bands. However, these are latetablets and we must be cautious not to assume that in our earliest exem-plars the same type of binding action was envisaged.Another visualization of reversal is illustrated in the famous example ofthe clay Louvre figurine17whose arms and legs are bound behind its back(discussed further below), and there are many figurines with their handsor feet pressed together, although not necessarily twisted backwards.Many orthographic variations from the Attic tablet cited above exist in othertablets, and this does not make it altogether easy to determine the ratio-nale for reversing some words and not others, or some letters and not others. In later, imperial Roman tablets, palindromes become popular, someof which are quite elaborate and contain only partially intelligible names,but which suggest a collapsing into one of writing forwards and backwardsat the same time. What we have, then, in the backward and mirror writ-ing is a loose affiliation of ideas of reversal, which as always in magic admitof creative variation and elaboration over time.Binding the GodsThe more immediate question concerns the meaning of the metaphor ofbindingin general. The tablets spell out fairly clearly the intentions of theuser, and what they intend to change in their adversary through the bind-ing of their person, perceptual abilities, and works, as we shall see in moredetail below. But why is the metaphor of binding used and not some other9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 67"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"68Binding Magic and Erotic Figurinesmetaphor such as being cut, hanged, trodden upon, or drowned? Allwould seem in principle to work. There are no definitive answers here, butin Greek mythology a very common feature associated with divinities isthat since they cannot kill one another, they seek alternative means suchas imprisonment and binding to restrict their adversaries’ movements.18However, some divinities are recognized as divinities precisely whenhumans attempt to bind them and cannot. So for instance, after the godApollo is born, nectar and ambrosia are poured for him and we are told:19But when, Phoebus, after eating the immortal foodthen golden bands did not hold you as you strugglednor did bonds (δεσμi) restrain you, but all their ends came loose.Apollo’s inability to be bound is a mark of his divinity. The plural nounδεσμi(sg. δεσμlς20) comes from the verb δεrν‘to bind’, which in turn givesus the most common verb for binding in the curse tablets, καταδεrν‘tobind down’.The most striking instance of a divinity who cannot be permanently boundis Dionysus. After suddenly appearing on shore as a beautiful young man,Dionysus was captured by pirates, who thought he would bring a good ransom and so we are told that the sailors:21wanted to bind (δεnν) him with painful bonds (δεσμοk),but the bonds (δεσμi) could not hold him, and the withies fellfar away from his hands and feetAt this point the helmsman of the ship recognizes that this young man isin fact a divinity and exhorts the other sailors, in vain as it happens, toreturn him to shore. This passage is also interesting because it shows thatthe binding of Dionysus’ hands and feet was attempted, which correspondsto the very common request in the curse tablets that the hands and feet(or arms and legs, χεrρας, πlδας) of a victim be bound. Again it is the inability of a divinity to be bound that both marks him as divine and signals the limitation of human ability to exercise control over a god.Several Greek myths make clear, on the other hand, that divinities canbind other creatures as well as one another. In the Homeric Hymn to Hermes,for example, after Hermes returns from having stolen the cattle of Apollo,his mother says that surely Apollo will come and bind his hands (or arms,χερσk) around his ribs as recompense.22Later, after Hermes takes Apolloto the cave where he had hidden the cattle, Hermes retrieves them and to prevent them from leaving he fashions bonds (δεσμi) for their feet, which miraculously take root and graft the cattle to the spot.23Given9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 68"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Binding Magic and Erotic Figurines69these stories, it may not come as a surprise that by the fifth centurybceHermes, along with Hekate and Persephone, are the underworld divini-ties most closely associated with binding magic and are among those mostoften mentioned in the Attic tablets. The most powerful divinity that wasbound by other divinities was Zeus, whom we are told in the Iliadwas oncefreed by Thetis after Hera, Poseidon, and Pallas Athena had bound himin shackles (δεσμοk).24Nearly as famous is the story of Zeus’ wife, Hera,whom Zeus once bound with a golden bond or chain (δεσμlς) and hungfrom the heavens presumably for some treachery, and threw the other godswho attempted to help her from Olympus.25But it is the Titan Prometheuswhose binding in the Caucasus mountains at the command of Zeus mostvisibly depicts the limits of even Zeus’ power to overcome a divine adver-sary. In Aeschylus’ Prometheusour namesake refers in his opening linesto the ‘shameful bond (δεσμlς) put upon him’26by Zeus, and the shack-ling of Prometheus generally can be taken to epitomize the limits of divinepower. The reasoning here seems clear: since divinities cannot kill oneanother to achieve their aims, restraining them through binding is the nextbest measure to control their will or restrict their movements.Stories that depict the early accomplishments of young divinities, as in the Homeric Hymns, furthermore employ the image of the inability ofthese gods to be bound as a trope and a distinguishing marker of their otherworldly status. It is more than likely then, even in the face of little orno directevidence, that the figurative and literal use of binding in cursetablets reflects the widespread notion that this action in particular was asso-ciated with the realization of divine power. Of course the curse tablets arewritten by humans to control other humans, but they rely already in thefifth and fourth centuriesbceon the intervention of named and sometimesunnamed divinities to achieve their purpose. In later curses, the speakerof the curse sometimes claims that he actually is a divinity. While theseexamples from Greek myth do not prove that the notion of binding in magic comes from the association of binding with divinities, binding is ametaphorical precedent in Greek religious thinking with regard to con-straining or otherwise controlling a divinity. The practitioners of bindingmagic can then be seen to adapt that archaic notion to serve their ownmortal purposes.Divine AgentsBecause curse tablets as a rule require the cooperation of underworld divi-nities and powers for their execution, they were placed in wells, springs, hippodromes in the case of athletic curses, theaters in the case of curses9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 69"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"70Binding Magic and Erotic Figurinesbetween dramatic performers, and in the sanctuaries of underworlddivinities, but most commonly in the graves of young people who had diedearly (aDroi) or violently (biaiothanatoi). More rarely those who died‘uninitiated’ (atelestoi, literally ‘incomplete’) are invoked.27All told, these‘restless dead’ are characterized by anger and implacability, and it isthese qualities which the magical practitioner hopes to channel to bringhis curse to fruition. The myriad ways in which archaic and classicalperiod Greeks interacted with their dead have been recently surveyed by Sarah Iles Johnston.28I want here only to point to a few key features of the dead, especially as they bear on the shift in Greek attitudes towardthem between the archaic and classical periods.That the dead can be restless, for example, we see from as early asHomeric narrative when Odysseus visits the underworld. There he firstencounters his companion, Elpenor, who had died apparently withoutOdysseus’ knowledge after he and others departed from Circe’s island.Elpenor is restless in the underworld not because he had gotten drunk,fallen asleep on the rooftop of Circe’s palace, and then fallen and brokenhis neck, but because no one was there to bury and mourn his death properly. When Elpenor’s soul (psukhB) speaks to Odysseus he tells him explicitly:29Do not go and leave me behind unwept and unburiedwhen you leave, for fear that I might become a gods’ curse upon youElpenor asks for a burial appropriate to a hero, namely to be cremated alongwith all of his armor and then to have his ashes buried in a tomb on theseashore. Exactly how Elpenor’s restless soul will become a curse by wayof the gods is not stated. But this and other examples in Homer attest firmlyto the belief that heroes who are not properly interred are already a seri-ous cause for concern among the living. This concern continues throughthe classical period and later, and was in varied ways made the basis ofmore than one plot in Greek tragic drama.30By the classical period, a number of named and unnamed divinities areinvoked in the curse tablets in different but conventional ways. It isunderstood that they will intervene in the desired action, although theirexact role as agents is still not fully understood. The most commondivinities mentioned in the early Attic texts, for example, are Hermes,Persephone, and Hekate, but even in Attica other divinities like Gb,Erinyes, and Dikbare sporadically mentioned. More precisely to char-acterize the role of the divinities in accomplishing magic, attention hasbeen paid to the formula ‘in the presence of (named divinity)’, as foundfor example in the following Attic text:319781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 70"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Binding Magic and Erotic Figurines71Biaios, slave of Philonikos,I bind and Agathonin the presence of Hermes (pros ton HermBn),the one who binds (katokhos)Here Hermes, like Persephone and Hekate in other tablets, is invoked inhis role as ‘binder’. The speaker of the curse binds his victim ‘in the pre-sence of (pros) Hermes’, but there is some difference of opinion as to theexact meaning here. In commercial and legal transactions in the classicalperiod, a transaction can take place ‘in the presence of ’ someone chargedwith the authority to oversee it, such as a magistrate, witness, or jury.32Hence one proposal argues that the divinity presides over the curse, in thesense that they authorize it to proceed. Another proposal views the pre-position prosas geographic in reference to its deposition in the precinctor cemetery in which the divinity lives.33But neither proposal is as straight-forward as it seems. One problem is that the construction of proswith anoun in the accusative lends itself to several potentially relevant mean-ings, including ‘with’, in situations involving reciprocal action; ‘towards’,‘for’, ‘at the hands of ’ when one indicates toward whom one has a posi-tive or negative emotion; and even ‘in the mind of ’ in cases of slander whenone wishes to indicate the persons who are aware of it.34Any or all of thesemeanings might be implied by an expression such as pros ton HermBninthe context of a binding curse, in which Hermes’ role may range from for-mally authorizing the curse to being the one simply to whose attentionthe curse is being called. If research could demonstrate that a formal, con-tractual basis underlay the prosexpression already in the fifth and fourthcenturies, this could be used as further evidence for the professionaliza-tion of curse tablet writing earlier than the Hellenistic and Roman periods.Moreover, it would lend support to the view that, along with the eleganthandwriting on some tablets, many of the curse tablet writers are moon-lighting from their day jobs as scribes or some other type of professionalsecretary or record-keeper.The community of underworld divinities and the dead needs further inves-tigation, if only to explain how their services came to be drawn upon withsuch regularity. The roles of Hermes, Persephone, and Hekate as leadersof and viators with the dead become more prominent in the fifth centurybce. This change is especially striking in the case of Hekate, who as earlyas the eighth century enjoyed an altogether different role as a goddess whoserealms of influence included the earth, sea, and upper air.35The changein status for these divinities partly results from the fact that Hermes, andto some extent Hekate,36had traditionally been associated with movementbetween the underworld and upperworld, while Persephone, who was9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 71"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"72Binding Magic and Erotic Figurinesexpressly associated with passage between the living and the dead, reignedamong the dead as queen to Hades. Other divinities with a chthonic dimen-sion, such as Demeter, are also addressed in the curse tablets.37Regionaldifferences are evident here as well: in the tablets found in Roman Britainat the sanctuary of Sulis Minerva at Bath, this divinity as we might expectis the most frequently mentioned addressee.38Frequently unnamed daimonesare addressed, although not necessarily the daimDnof thedeceased in whose grave the tablet is placed, since we have many tabletsthat clearly indicate the speaker is unaware of and unconcerned with whichdaimDnis being addressed.39Along with the aDroiand biaiothanatoi,what is important is that curse tablets, unlike purifications that may beaddressed to divinities as well as to the dead, primarily have currency amongthe dead. Thus they are addressed either to the deceased directly or to thoseunderworld leaders who are in the best position to galvanize the dead intoaction.40There is some evidence that the divinities addressed were meant to read the curses. One less common but significant feature of certain Attictablets is that they are epistolary, meaning that the tablet itself is appar-ently construed as a letter to the dead. Some scholars have suggested anEgyptian precedent for this practice, since so-called “letters to the dead”survive from the period of about 2300 –1200bce. But others have rightlycautioned that more attention will need to be paid to the differencesbetween these Egyptian letters and Greek curse tablets before such aninfluence can be established with certainty.41We have, for example, oneAttic tablet that announces itself as a letter (epistolB) being sent to daimonesand to Persephone,42while in another the speaker claims that he is send-ing ‘this letter’ (tBnde epistolBn) to Hermes and Persephone.43In a third,from Rome and written in Greek, the speaker addresses himself to ‘youdaimonesand the other gods written on this lead tablet . . .’, implying thatthe divinities would recognize themselves as the appropriate recipients.44One also thinks here of the “illiterate” texts, or pseudo-inscriptions at Bath,with Tomlin’s conjecture that Sulis Minerva required her petitioners despitetheir illiteracy to write their own letters because “after all, the goddess wouldbe able to read it.”45These few examples are not enough to establish a clearlink with Egyptian practice, nor are they enough to establish that cursetablets were originally conceived as letters,46but they all suggest that theinvisible divinities to whom the tablets are addressed were imagined ascapable of reading.47Other tablets are equally interesting, if somewhat contradictory, in thisrespect. For example, in a third- or second-centurybceAttic text that bindsKerkis,48his words and deeds, in the presence of ‘those who died beforemarriage’ (psθεοι), the speaker adds, ‘and whenever they read this’.49This9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 72"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Binding Magic and Erotic Figurines73clause appears to suggest that the untimely dead will read the curse. Incontrast, the parallel, so-called “Pasianax” tablets,50found in a tomb,written in Doric Greek, and possibly from Megara, read:Whenever you, Pasianax, read this letter, but neither will you, Pasianax, readthis letter (ta grammata tauta), nor will Neophanes ever make a lawsuit againstAristandros. But just as you, Pasianax, lie here without sensation, so willNeophanes become insensate and nothing.If, as is now commonly accepted, Pasianax is the dead person to whomthe tablet is addressed,51then the speaker seems to suggest that Pasianaxwill not be able to read it.52Whether the dead Pasianax is altogether incapable of reading, however, is unclear.53It is, however, implied in theexchange that Pasianax understands the nature of a lawsuit. As unre-markable as that may be, it reminds us that the extended social com-munity of the dead understands how to operate in the world of the living.And at least for this tablet, the effect of the curse depends on a parallelismbetween Pasianax not reading the letter and Neophanes failing to make alawsuit against Aristandros. But it is difficult to determine whether it is aquestion of Pasianax’s choice not to read the letter, or his inability to doso, that is at issue.Imagining the divine addressees as reading is a more significant pointthan it may seem, since literacy rates in classical period Athens at leastare notoriously difficult to specify. If it is true that only a small portion ofthe citizen population was able to read, we may have here a hint that literate tablet writers were professional scribes, or at least conversant in a world in which such formal communications were involved.54On theother hand, the noun epistolBin classical period Greek can also mean the ‘order’ or ‘command’ that is being sent, exclusive of whether that command is sent in the form of a letter. We have then to ask whether thefeatures of formal communication and letter-writing are owed more to the authors of these tablets, or whether they derive more generally froma cultural understanding of the tablets as letters or commands. So few ofthese examples survive in Greece that I am doubtful much headway canbe made without further discoveries.‘Characters’One feature of some curse tablets that has puzzled scholars and relates to the parameters of communication between the practitioner and his invisible agents is the appearance of ‘characters’ (χαρακτoρες, kharaktBres)9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 73"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"74Binding Magic and Erotic Figurinesor engraved images. The noun derives from the verb χαρiσσω‘to cut, carve,stamp, engrave’, and can refer to cutting stone or carving wood, engrav-ing metal, and so forth. These images, which sometimes recall letters inthe Greek alphabet, but which are often tipped with circles or nodes, appearon curse tablets, amulets, public inscriptions, and in Gnostic treatises begin-ning in the second century ce. They continue to appear in manuscriptsthroughout the Middle Ages and into the early modern period. Theirexact origins are unknown, but the best current theory as to their originis astrological,55and we have examples of kharaktBresthat correspond tosigns of the Zodiac.56To give some indication of their perennial interestto magical practitioners, they are found, for example, in the famousmedieval Arabic manuscript on magic and astral power, the Ghayat al-Hakimor The Aim of the Sage, known in the West as the Picatrix.57Thiswork was translated in the thirteenth century from Arabic into Spanish atthe bidding of Alfonso the Wise (Alfonso X, King of Castile and Leon,1252– 84), and was then later translated into Latin. The anonymous author’soutlook is dualist – in medieval cosmological terms, dualism privileges spiritover matter – and his exposition is dedicated to showing how spirit canbe brought down from its pure realm among the stars and descend intomatter. Among the many detailed and sometimes bewildering instructionsgiven in the text, the power of spirit dwelling in the stars can be attractedthrough drawing the correct kharaktBres, on gems and sometimes on leadtablets, to which the astral spirits will descend.58KharaktBres, not unlike the writing on ancient curse tablets themselves,arguably function as vehicles of communication between the visible andinvisible world, between men and gods, but what they indicated exactlyis not known. It is important to recognize, however, that the basic viewthat kharaktBresfunction as communication developed over time, espe-cially between the second and fifth centuries ce. Different authors helddifferent views about how they worked. For example, the view that magicin general is a form of communication between men and gods can be foundin the work of that expert on ancient magic – himself a defendant in a trialfor magic – Apuleius (ca. 125 – d. after 170 ce). In his defense, Apuleius writesthat a magusis properly one who accomplishes whatever he wants througha certain force of incantation and a shared dialogue with the immortal gods,which he refers to somewhat obscurely as a communio loquendi‘associ-ation of speaking’.59It seems that for Apuleius incantations (cantamina)are the primary mode of communication with the gods. The view that mencommunicated with the gods in a special language and through specialsigns, such as kharaktBresand foreign names (technically called voces magicae‘magical utterances’), was articulated by both Christian60andNeoplatonist authors. But Neoplatonist authors such as Iamblichus (fl. ca.9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 74"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Binding Magic and Erotic Figurines75165 –180 ce) interpreted kharaktBreswithin the framework of theurgy (literally ‘divine work’), which was a practical magical and religious program dedicated to bringing a practitioner into communion not withlesser divinities but with the ultimate divinity – the One. According to thisframework, about which we shall see more in chapter 4, kharaktBresfunc-tioned as vehicles (technically known to theurgists as sumbola‘symbols’)to convey divine power directly to the practitioner.61St. Augustine of Hippo (354 – 430 ce) authoritatively established theview, which was to remain influential among medieval Christian authorson magic, that kharaktBreswere a form of secret communication betweenhumans and demons.62It is entirely plausible that Augustine has the passage of Apuleius referenced earlier mainly in mind here, only that he has replaced Apuleius’ ‘immortal gods’ with what to a Christian, becausethey were not the ultimate god, could only be daemones. For Augustineand many medieval theologians after him (notably Thomas Aquinas,1224/5 –1274), demons were the only “real” agents capable of actualizingmagic. For magic to succeed, it was the view of Augustine that certain consultations or contracts (pacta) were arranged between the magical practitioner and demons, and it is this fundamental view that became thebasis for the development of medieval demonology and witchcraft.63ForAugustine the ‘magical arts’ (magicae artes) represent a dangerous super-stition, under which the books of diviners (haruspices) and augurs oughtto be included:64To this category belong all the amulets (ligaturae) and remedies which themedical profession also condemns, whether these consist of incantations (praecantationes), or certain marks which their exponents call ‘characters’(characteres), or the business of hanging certain things up and tying thingsto other things, or even somehow making things dance. The purpose of thesepractices is not to heal the body, but to establish certain secret (occultas) oreven overt meanings (significationes).The term Augustine uses for ‘amulet’, ligatura, literally means a ‘binding’,but refers to the Greek magical practice of tying an amulet (περkαμμονorπερkαπτον, both from the verb περιiπτειν‘to tie on’) or cords onto the body.65The point should not be missed that, although he is here concerned withmagic used in healing the body, Augustine is broadly familiar with Greekand Roman magical practices. Ligatures, incantations, and kharaktBresare all equivalent from a functional point of view insofar as they createmeanings (significationes), of which some may be occult, for demons. Itis not entirely clear along which lines Augustine draws the distinctionbetween occult and overt meanings, but a fair guess would have it that9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 75"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"76Binding Magic and Erotic Figurinesarticulate spells are overtly meaningful, while rituals such as ligatures andimages such as kharaktBresare occult. The meanings associated withmagic are dispositive for Augustine. Indeed, he writes elsewhere that it isnot merely by virtue of the magical operation (such as hanging an amuletaround a sick person’s neck) that the magic is efficacious, but explicitlyby virtue of additional features such as kharaktBres:66But in the absence of incantations or invocations or ‘characters’ it is oftendoubtful whether the thing tied on or attached in some way for healing thebody works by nature – in which case it may be used freely – or succeeds byvirtue of some meaningful association; in this case, the more effectively itappears to heal, the more a Christian should be on guard.Together these passages reveal that while Augustine is at pains to cautionhis readers to avoid magic, since its powers do not derive from nature, never-theless he regards magic as potentially efficacious. It is noteworthy thatAugustine places less faith in the distinction Plato advanced in the Lawsbetween one type of magic that harms by means of nature, to which hewould assign for instance drinks and food, and a second type which, bymeans of wax figurines and other ‘signs’, reinforces in both practitionerand victim the belief that magic is real.67For Augustine, the sign systemssuch as incantations or kharaktBresthat instruct demons as to what effectin the visible world they have been charged to create, in conjunction withan operation like an amulet or ligature, are the sources of magical power.Accordingly, all magic can have potentially real effects in the world, providedit is accompanied by the secret communication with demonic agents.68This theory that kharaktBresare a form of communication betweenmen and demons must be treated cautiously, because we have very littleevidence apart from Iamblichus’ Neoplatonist formulation of what pur-pose kharaktBresserved from the mouths of magical practitioners them-selves. When we look to examples of magical tablets and papyri withkharaktBres, it is often difficult to know precisely the purpose they served.Many curse tablets and spells written on papyri, for example, havekharaktBrespictured on them. In some cases, at the end of a written spellthere are instructions for the practitioner to compose kharaktBres, oftendetailing exactly where to place them.69In others, the kharaktBresappearalong with a spell with no explicit reference to them.70In contrast tothese, other tablets make more animated use of kharaktBres. Consider thefollowing late fifth- or early sixth-century ce ‘athletic curse’ tablet fromApamea, a Greek city in Syria, in which the speaker addresses thekharaktBresdirectly for the purpose of hobbling the Blue chariot team infavor of the Green. The Blues and Greens, known in later antiquity for their9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 76"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Binding Magic and Erotic Figurines77fierce rivalry, raced in the hippodrome in Apamea and the client who com-missioned this curse did so presumably on the eve of a major race. Abovethe first line of text, 36 kharaktBresare inscribed and the text itself beginswith an invocation to them:71Most holy Lords, KharaktBres, tie up, bind the feet, the hands, the sinews,the eyes, the knees, the courage, the leaps, the whip, the victory and the crown-ing of Porphyras and Hapsicratbs,72who are in the middle left, as well as hisco-drivers of the Blue colors in the stable of Eugenius. . . .The author of this text conceives of the kharaktBresas divine agents capable of accomplishing the binding magic stated in the text. There hasbeen speculation as to whether the kharaktBreshere named and the 36kharaktBr images on this tablet have some association with the 36 divi-sions of the heavens in Egyptian astrology.73Whatever the exact referencemay be, the point I wish to make is that the kharaktBresaddressed in thiscurse are not merely pictographic signs, which to Augustine would haveserved the purpose of conveying secretive meanings. Rather, here they areconceived as animate beings called upon to realize the curse. As othershave noted, the magical papyri suggest that all spiritual beings havekharaktBresas their signatures, as it were, which are in some way empow-ered.74But empowered by what or whom?A third- or fourth-century cerecipe for a short binding spell found in the magical papyri raises the possibility that the kharaktBreshavenames:75Binding spell (Katokhos). Write on a tin tablet with a bronze stylus beforesunrise the names: Khrbmillon Moulokh Kampu KhrbhphthdMaskelli (formula) ErbkisiphthbIabezebuth. Then throw it into a river, or [the] seabefore sunrise. Also write on it these kharaktBres: ‘(6 pictographs) Powerfulgods, restrain’. Add the usual, whatever you wish.Again we see the kharaktBresdirectly addressed at the end of this spell as the divine entities charged with accomplishing the restraining action.We also have examples in this excerpt of voces magicae, which combineCoptic, Hebrew, and Greek elements. A few of these names are at least semi-intelligible.76Whether the first six names mentioned, for instance, cor-respond to the six kharaktBresdrawn is unclear. But as yet there has beenno systematic attempt to elucidate the meaning, let alone the function, ofkharaktBres.Even so, it is one thing to say with Augustine that kharaktBresfunctionas signs to convey meaning (significatio) to invisible powers. In some sense9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 77"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"78Binding Magic and Erotic Figurinesthe kharaktBresin this view are passive vehicles of meaning. But in ourtwo spells above, the magical practitioner addresses the kharaktBresdirectly as independent divine agents who will carry out the desired oper-ation. In the anthropological terms of Alfred Gell, the social agency of thekharaktBresis more fully realized – they can hear spells, for instance, knowthe technical language of binding spells, in addition to understanding theintricate dynamics of chariot-racing – and the magical practitioner inter-acts with them as with other divine beings whom he may call upon to effecthis aims. Therefore we must be careful not to retroject Augustine’s viewsof kharaktBres– informed as they are by the Neoplatonist underpinningsto his general views of magic – into earlier periods, when kharaktBresfirst appear. Equally important to note is that in Augustine’s formulationkharaktBresare essentially representational – in the basic sense of the term‘sign’ – but the kharaktBresthat are addressed as animate beings in ourspells above cannot merely be representations. Instead they are living beings,in the sense presented in chapter 1, and as such have to be treated differently than if they were symbolic forms. The situation is still more complicated than I have indicated up to this point. If the kharaktBresmentioned in the two spells above are asked to bind or restrain a desig-nated victim, some of the same kharaktBresappear elsewhere in the mag-ical papyri to thwart such binding spells. Several of the same kharaktBres,for example, in the two spells above also appear in a PGMrecipe for a ‘Spellbreaker’ (Lusipharmakon).77This kind of irregularity in the appearance ofkharaktBresis partly to blame for why scholars have largely avoided a sus-tained treatment of them.Body Parts and HealthOne of the most interesting shifts in the curse tablets from the classicalperiod forward involves the progressive ‘fragmentation’ of the victim tobe bound. In many of the earliest Attic tablets, we find only a name (inthe nominative or accusative), then a verb such as katadeinor katekheinappears in the first person with the name, and then key intellectual andphysical parts of the body appear along with the name or names of thevictims as features to be bound. This progression does not hold across allgeographic regions in which tablets have been found – the earliest tabletsfrom Selinus being an important exception78– but the pattern is wide-spread enough to deserve further scrutiny. We have already seen someexamples of the simpler tablets. Let us now look at those that showincreasing complexity. A typical example of a late fifth- or early fourth-century Attic tablet that binds more than a name is the following:799781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 78"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Binding Magic and Erotic Figurines79Of Dbmbtrios I bindhis spirit (psukhB) and mind (nous), feeling (thumos)Of Telesarkhos: I bindhis spirit and mind, feeling. . . .Another simple Attic text adds the equally common features of the tongue,hands, and feet (abbreviated):80. . . TheodotbI bindboth herand her tongueand handsand feet . . .The common explanation that has been offered for why these features ofthe individual start to be singled out for mention in the tablets is that theycapture the intellectual and physical faculties of the victim. We havealready referred to the example of Gnaeus Sicinius, who in the 70sbcesuddenly forgot his entire case and blamed his lapse of memory on thespells and incantations of the defendant, Titinia.81This sudden loss of mental faculty seems to accord with the frequent mention in the tabletsof binding the soul, tongue, and feeling, and with the occasional mentionof the head, words, speech, and even memory, of the victims. In a moregeneral sense the binding of the psukhe, here roughly translated as ‘spirit’,has been taken to refer to the victim’s will, which is bound so as to moti-vate the victim either to do or not to do something. What has not beenadequately explained, however, is the binding of hands and feet (or armsand legs), as well as in later tablets the veritable proliferation of other bodyparts that can be bound.82It is not clear whether, for instance, the com-mand to bind hands and feet ought to be taken literally. In cases wherethe mental faculties of the victim are at issue, one wonders what restrain-ing the victim’s hands and feet – and essentially rooting the individual inplace – accomplishes.The misplacement is especially clear in curses having to do withstaunching a victim’s ability to speak, whether in a judicial or a more gen-eral social context. One of two Attic tablets about a fellow named Mikion,which was found in the nineteenth century in a grave in Peiraieus, can betaken as illustration:83MikionI tookand I bound9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 79"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"80Binding Magic and Erotic Figurineshis tongue,and soul,and handsand feet,and if he is aboutto say something wicked about Philon,may his tongue become lead.Pierce his tongue, and may his possessionswhich he has or manages, become displaced and portionless.For all intents and purposes this may be a judicial curse and Mikion maywell be a prosecutor in an upcoming case against Philon, perhaps like thatof Sicinius against Titinia. But even if we cannot establish the context ofthis curse with certainty, it is the intellectual faculties that are at issue, notMikion’s hands and feet. Therefore we can say with some certainty thatthe hands and feet, no less than the tongue and soul, comprise a basicanatomical formula. Hands and feet are part and parcel of a binding formula that requires the mention of intellectual and physical faculties.There may be more than meets the eye, however, in the mention of handsand feet. I have already noted that in Greek mythology we have severalaccounts of mortal and divine attempts to bind divinities, often by theirhands and feet, only to discover among immortals that such binding is atbest temporary, and among mortals that such binding may jeopardize theirlives (e.g., Dionysus, in the Homeric Hymn to Dionysus12–14). Thesemythological parallels provide us with a quasi-historical context – quasibecause Greek myth typically contains some distorted history – in whichto view binding magic. But there may still be a broader cultural frameworkin which binding the faculties and limbs figures as such. One direction thathas not been explored is that binding a victim’s mental and physical fac-ulties is a realization, through magic, of Greek notions of disability and impair-ment. The most famous disabled dramatic character on the Athenian stagewas Oedipus, whose own ankles were pinned or pierced by his father whenhe was exposed, presumably to hobble his ghost after death and preventit from seeking revenge.84As noted earlier, piercing a folded tablet with anail gives visible expression to the metaphor of binding, and some tabletsexpressly call for piercing (kentein) the victim’s body parts.85We mayregard Oedipus, then, as having effectively undergone a binding of his limbs,even if magic per seis not mentioned in the context of his story.86The culturally relevant understanding of disability as the inverse ofbinding extends further. We have a late passage from the physicianSoranus of Ephesus (98 –138 ce), whose Gynaecologyis unique among Greek medical texts for its description of the main features of health in a newborn child.87Soranus writes that the child:889781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 80"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Binding Magic and Erotic Figurines81should be perfect in all its parts, limbs and senses, and should haveunblocked passages, namely of the ears, nose, throat, urethra, and anus. Thenatural movements of each limb should neither be heavy nor weak, the limbsshould bend and stretch, its shape should be appropriate, and it should bevery alert.If we interpret binding magic in terms of a Greek definition of health, wecan see that magic inverts the very markers of health identified bySoranus. A newborn’s limbs and senses should be perfect and flexible inmovement, and none of its passages should be blocked. Binding magic aimsto accomplish just the reverse: limbs and senses are restrained andthereby impaired, with the intent of rendering the victim incapable ofachieving his aims. In some cases, as in the judicial curses we have seen,the aim is actually to render the victim unalert or insensate, insofar as hismemory, his speech, and his ability to present a lawsuit will fail. There hasbeen some effort to situate binding magic into a broader cultural under-standing of disability or deformity,89but this is still an area that needs further research. In any case, to the extent that Soranus’ views can be takenas generally representative of earlier generations, we may have cause toargue that binding magic depends for its appeal on the inversion of cultural notions of health – not in general, but in the specific definitionof health with regard to the freedom of the senses and limbs.Later stories, on the other hand, for example those of Theophilus andTheoddros of Cyprus, make the relationship between binding magic andlameness explicit. In the case of Theophilus, whose hands and feet hadbeen magically bound, thus rendering him painfully lame and paralyzed,a carved bronze image in human form was removed from the sea. Whenthe four nails in the image driven into each hand and foot were extracted,Theophilus recovered and regained movement.90Theddoros of Cyprus wassimilarly lamed by magic, and when the unspecified ‘instrument of the sor-cerer’ was discovered buried near the doorway to his bedroom he too, weare to infer, recovered from his disability.91Although late (sixth centuryce), these stories both illustrate that in late antiquity binding magic wasunderstood to have the literal effect of pinning the hands and feet of itsvictims. However, we must be cautious not to retroject that view to ear-lier eras in which binding spells served apparently to block their victims’will rather than literally to transfix them.In various parts of Greece and Rome, the practice of abandoning con-genitally deformed or disabled infants in the wilderness until death wassanctioned by law.92This may run counter to our modern sensibilities but,in Greece for instance, the birth of a deformed child (known as a teras‘monstrous birth’93) had religious implications, insofar as it was interpreted9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 81"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"82Binding Magic and Erotic Figurinesto mean that the parents or community members were being punishedby the gods. Some but not all Greek city-states, like Sparta, had legisla-tion that specifically enjoined the tribal elders of deformed children toexpose them.94Rearing a child in Sparta was a state decision, and we aretold that newborns were examined by the elders of the tribes to determinetheir fitness and health. Should the infants be found mentally or physically defective, the Spartan elders ordered the father to deposit the child at a predetermined location actually called Apothetai, or“Exposure Place,” at the foot of a local mountain. In this way it was thestate that determined whether its members were of advantage to it or tothemselves.On the same principle, Plutarch informs us, Spartan women bathed theirnewborns not in water but in wine to test their constitutions. He then reportsthe general view that bathing children in wine specifically throws epi-leptics and sickly infants into convulsions, whereas healthy children aretempered and strengthened in body by it.95Without knowing for certain,I suspect the Spartan mothers engaged in this practice because theyunderstood the antiseptic properties of alcohol, and knew that the strongfumes would provoke some kind of physical reaction in the infants. Butthe rationale as reported by Plutarch has other implications for magic. Wehave already seen in the Hippocratic treatise On the Sacred Diseasethe con-nection between epilepsy and magic, and the narrower correspondencebetween the binding language of magic and the description of epilepticsas ‘held down’ or ‘restrained’. Although magic is not mentioned explicitlyin the context of this Spartan practice, nevertheless it is suggestive thatepilepsy is one kind of congenital ailment for which the mothers arespecifically looking. The symptoms of epilepsy invert the free movementof the limbs and the alertness of the mind that mark a healthy infant. Ifthese Spartan examples have wider currency, we may go so far as to saythat binding magic aims, in effect, to engender the symptoms indicativeof epilepsy. The larger point that needs to be made, however, is that conceptions of magic operate within cultural categories, such as Greeknotions of health. Accordingly, the effects of binding magic – whether itrestrains the limbs or dumbfounds the awareness – are not random, butare intelligible within prevailing cultural conceptions of health. Takentogether, Soranus and Plutarch both suggest that mental and physicalnotions of Greek health are in some fundamental sense defined in opposition to epilepsy.Situating binding magic within broader Greek or Roman notions ofhealth does not preclude other explanations for how to interpret its pecu-liar features. As we move forward in time, later curse tablets proliferatethe number of body parts that can be bound. There is no clear reason why9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 82"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Binding Magic and Erotic Figurines83this should be the case, although analogies have been proposed with theprogressively more detailed language found in Greek and Roman legal documents and contracts. It turns out that this may be more than an incidental point of convergence. A cache of curse tablets found at the Stoa of Attalos in the Athenian Agora dated to the mid-third century ceare all written by the same hand.96The aims of these tablets differ – withsome written to attack athletes and prostitutes, while the purpose of others is less clear – and at least one tablet employs a common formulabut leaves blank spaces for the insertion of the victim’s name.97The cursetablets in this find point clearly toward the professionalization of tablet-writing, as we have already noted, and it is not hard to imagine that a localscribe or cleric was moonlighting for extra pay. As another example, ananalysis of the language on curse tablets found at the temple of Sulis Minervaat Bath, England, shows clear affinities with Roman legal and financial terminology.98Words commonly found in catalogues and summaries arealso present, giving the impression that the authors of these texts were clerks. The petitionary formulae and language of the Bath tablets suggestthat the appeal to otherworldly powers was not altogether different thanwhat one might expect in an appeal to a local magistrate or military com-mander. Here again we see how magic unfolds one sphere of cultural inter-action into another. But whether such a turn toward professionalism andlegalism is adequate to explain the fragmentation, or dismemberment, ofthe body that we find in later tablets is an open question.There are numerous examples of curses and curse tablets with extendedlists of body parts. They begin to appear in the late classical period, butthen increase during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. To take a Greekexample first, consider a second-century ce Athenian tablet that targetsits victim apparently for a theft.99After addressing ‘underworld messen-gers’, and underworld Hermes, Hekate, Pluto, Korb, Persephone, theFates, all the gods, and Cerberus, the canine guardian of Hades, the speakerof this tablet ‘enrolls...the hair, brains, mouth, teeth, lips, shoulders, arms,breast, stomach, back, lower belly, pubes, thighs,. . . toes, nails’ of the victim.100We may compare this Athenian tablet above to a Roman tabletfound in a tomb near the amphitheater at Minturnae, undated but almostcertainly late.101This tablet was placed on the skull of the deceased in the tomb, and was found along with an unusually well-sculpted marblefigurine of a woman with braided hair, 11 centimeters tall. The figurinewas presumably identified as the woman, Tyche, who is the target of thecurse. The curse itself aims at the general demise of Tyche and her pro-perty. After dedicating her to the infernal gods, the speaker enumeratesfor binding, from head to toe, Tyche’s head, hair, shadow, skull, brow, eye-brows, mouth, nose, chin, jaws, lips, speech, face, neck, liver, shoulders,9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 83"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"84Binding Magic and Erotic Figurinesheart, lungs, intestines, stomach, arms, fingers, hands, navel, bladder,knees, legs, ankles, and the soles of her feet.The usual explanation that individual features are singled out to cap-ture the intellectual and physical faculties of the victim seems to fall shortin these examples. Nor are professionalization and creeping legalism inthemselves adequate explanations. The motif of cursing someone from headto toe may have a non-Greek origin,102and further research may help usto understand this pattern better. It has been suggested that these tabletsought to be viewed as part of a process of gradual accumulation, whichperhaps culminates in a tablet that curses ‘all the 365 muscles of the body’.103Two recent approaches have more appeal. The first draws upon theanthropological work of Annette Weiner104and focuses on the rhetoricalvalue of listing as a weapon that strips its victim of protection.105The pro-tection at issue in Weiner’s model is a form of social shame that is main-tained in normal social interaction and discourse through euphemism,discretion, and avoidance. Magical language employs what she calls ‘hardwords’ that serve to destroy a victim’s social autonomy and anatomy andthat ‘recreate perceived realities’.106This approach has the advantage ofhighlighting the rhetorical strategies that may be at work behind thedetailed mention of body parts. Such strategies are harder to discern, however, than may be realized. The main proponent of the rhetoricalapproach, Richard Gordon, argues that:107the remorseless enumeration of parts of the body enables the practitionerimaginatively to dismember the victim so that the curse moment, theperiod of the practitioner’s projective fixation upon the victim, can beextended as long as possible.I am sympathetic to Gordon’s approach, but fear that he has projected his own psychological understanding of magic onto the imagined practi-tioners and/or composers of these tablets. The evidence does not allowus to “get inside” the head of an ancient practitioner, despite our best efforts,nor are matters made easier when we confront the reality that cursetablets were often composed by others and commercially sold. We sim-ply cannot trust that the first-person (“I”) speaker of a curse tablet tells us anything personal, which in turn prevents us from making any claimsabout a practitioner’s “imaginative fixation.” There are certainly rhetoricaldimensions to the tablets, but they are better understood within the broadercontext of a collective magical tradition, whose boundaries by definitionare permeable with those of other cultural and social institutions.A second approach focuses on how these later tablets reflect methodsof torture derived from judicial punishment. The proponent of this9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 84"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Binding Magic and Erotic Figurines85approach, Henk Versnel, has shown that some Roman tablets makeunequivocal mention of the rack as an instrument of torture.108He citesseveral parallel references to torture that single out particular body parts,especially in Hebrew texts, and suggests that curse tablets that betray Jewishand more generally Near Eastern influence tend to make more explicit ref-erences to torture. However, despite the fact that the Romans institutedincreasingly crueler corporal punishments to slaves and, in later times, tohumiliores(‘persons of lower class’), there is little evidence that lists of bodyparts of the kind that we find in our tablets have any parallel in Greek orRoman penal codes or practices.109Moreover, the same phenomenon ofenumerating body parts also appears in spells that serve purposes otherthan punishment, such as a fifth-century ce Coptic Christian spell, writ-ten on papyrus, to protect a woman in childbirth.110After invoking 12archangels with 12 bowls filled with water, the speaker says, ‘When I castit into the fire, you must fill the 12 bowls with fire (and) cast them intoher heart – her lung(s), her heart, her liver, her spleen, (into all) the hun-dred twenty-five body parts’.111Thus in the listing of body parts, we haveagain to do with a phenomenon that is independent of the aims to whichit is put within particular magical formulae.Note that in our sample of Athenian and Roman tablets, we observe aheightened interest in naming external physical features and limbs, andin the Roman tablet, in addition to external features, a mixture of inter-nal and external organs was named. It might be argued that some of theseinternal organs have a role to play in other institutional practices, such asin the widespread practice of divination. For instance, organs that com-prise the viscera, especially the liver, have an established history in Greekand Roman divination. The liver has a long history in Greek and Romanthought as the source of emotion and as the principal organ, both in animalsand humans, through which the gods communicated their desires to men.112But body parts such as the stomach or navel, let alone the chin and knees,have no such traditional place. To the extent that internal organs becomemore prominent in curse tablets, it might on the other hand be arguedthat an increased understanding of human anatomy is responsible. Greeknatural philosophers and medical writers, including the Presocratics,Hippocratics, and Aristotle, advocated the dissection of animals as a meansto study the human body, since there were strong religious taboos untilthe Hellenistic period against dissecting or vivisecting human bodies.Both dissection and vivisection of human subjects, typically criminals, beginin the Hellenistic period in Alexandria by major figures in the history ofmedicine such as Herophilus and Erasistratus.113The connection betweenmedical knowledge of anatomy and the more frequent mention of anato-mical features on curse tablets may deserve further research. Even if one9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 85"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"86Binding Magic and Erotic Figurinescould demonstrate, however, that new anatomical knowledge was dis-seminated through academic learning to the populace, it would still notexplain why naming individual body parts became more salient in magic.There is one area of research in this regard that has not been given adequate consideration. Naming body parts in curse tablets shares similarities with the Greek and Roman religious practice of dedicating ex-votos modeled on human body parts. The term ex-voto refers to an offer-ing made after the fulfillment of a vow, as when an individual prays to adivinity to heal an ailment. Should that ailment be healed, in Greece andRome it was appropriate to offer a figurine, a sacrificial animal, and so forth,at the temple of the relevant deity as a thank-offering. There is, however,in both Greece and Rome a class of votive figurines that directly concernsthe healing of diseases and these are terracotta models of human parts –including human heads, eyes, ears, noses, mouths, jaws, arms, breasts,hearts, lungs, bladders, hands, genitals, uteri, legs, and feet. These bodypart votives have been found at sanctuaries in classical period Greece –most prominently at the Asclepium in Epidaurus – and at Republican Romansanctuaries as early as the fourth centurybcethroughout central Italy andSicily.114Most of the votives found to date are made of terracotta, but bodypart votives have also been found made of gold, silver, amber, and wood.In the opinion of one expert who has studied these votives, the Greeks had a preference for external human organs, whereas Romans modeledinternal organs more often and generally made more ex-votos thanGreeks.115There is as yet no explanation for the difference between the Greekand Roman sensibility toward what has been called ‘sacred anatomy’, but one avenue of research should seek to document whether, on the whole,Roman curse tablets actually refer more often than Greek ones to inter-nal organs, and then explore what that might mean.The entire phenomenon of body part votives offers a suggestive contextin which to understand curse tablets. At the temple of Sulis Minerva at Bath,for example, both curse tablets that enumerate body parts and medicalex-votos have been found. This may not be surprising insofar as the god-dess Sulis, like many Greek and Roman divinities generally, exercisedmultiple functions for her devotees. The votives are the body parts thathave been healed by a divinity, whereas the anatomical curse tablets seekto disable individual body parts. The correspondence is not exactbetween the Bath tablets and ex-votos but may have generally to do withthe health of a victim, as we suggested earlier. Nonetheless, considertablet no. 97, which deals with the theft of a silver ring:116. . . so long as (someone), whether slave or free, keeps silent or knows any-thing about it, he may be accursed in (his) blood and eyes and every limb,9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 86"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Binding Magic and Erotic Figurines87or even have all (his) intestines quite eaten away, if he has stolen the ring orbeen privy to (the theft).In many respects this list resembles the examples we have already seen,which came from regions largely outside of Britain. The mention of‘blood’ (sanguis) is common in the Bath tablets and may be peculiar toBritain,117but this formula seems generally to mean that the health of theaccursed is at issue. Among the votive objects found at the Bath site is atin mask of a man, with Celtic features, and with eye sockets cut out andeach backed by a roundel of metal, which suggests that the sockets hadat one time been filled with glass. After comparing this mask to numer-ous others, mostly of bronze, the editors write that the mask “is probablyto be classed with medical ex-votos and represents a visitor to the shrinewho came to be healed in body or mind rather than a deity.”118A pair ofivory breasts cut from a tusk, as well as a bronze breast made from a sheet,was also found. They are compared by the editors, among other things,to the medical votives found for instance at Ponte di Nona, a sanctuary15 kilometers east of Rome, in which a cache of votives the majority ofwhich were feet and eyes was discovered.119Whether the breasts at Bathwere originally worn by a lactating woman or were made specifically fordedication is unknown, but they demonstrate “that Sulis was invoked inher capacity as a healer (equivalent to Minerva Medica).”120This comparison at Bath is not detailed enough for us to draw the con-clusion that the body parts being healed were the same as those targetedin the curse tablets. Nor do I wish to imply a prediction that a given tem-ple site that contains anatomical curse tablets will also contain medicalvotives. More research along these lines would certainly have to be donefirst. Rather, contrary to current scholarship, which at present does notbring these phenomena into relation with one another, I am suggestingthat both project the body, although through different media, as fragmentedor dismembered and invite a divinity to act upon its parts. Along with thepossibility of increased anatomical knowledge coming from the centers ofacademic medicine (e.g., Alexandria, Ephesus, Rome), it is hard not to thinkthat the users of medical ex-votos bolstered the recognition among magical practitioners – since as in the case of Bath they surely frequentedthe same sacred sites, if they were not occasionally the same persons –that individual body parts needed singling out to attract the attention ofthe relevant invisible agent. Surely curse tablets accumulate body parts whileex-votos single them out, but underlying both practices is a conceptionof the body as extensible and anatomically distributable in space and time.The psychology behind medical votives and curse tablets is extra-ordinarily difficult to pinpoint. Certainly the ex-votos were dedicated to9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 87"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"88Binding Magic and Erotic Figurinesdivinities in the aftermath of healing, and to that extent they advertise thepower of the healing divinity, much as aretalogies do. But we do notknow, for example, whether the votive dedication was meant to entrustthat healed body part to the care of the divinity in the future as well, whichwould suggest that it was invested with contagious magical properties. Aswe shall explore below in more depth in the case of figurines, the balanceof evidence for Greeks and Romans suggests that a given manufacturedbody part entrusted to a divinity’s care was taken to be a real, not a symbolic, extension of a person. Accordingly, it would understate thesignificance of manufacturing and depositing ex-votos to say that theymerely ‘represent’ a real body part – in some sense they are identified withthat body part.121Similarly, we know that binding spells have occasionallybeen found folded around or containing human hair.122This is contagiousmagic and the hair is understood to be a physical extension of the victim’sbody – in fact, the hair may stand for the victim’s entire body and mind,or self, pars pro toto. Along with the anatomical curses, these ritual practices all operate according to a distributed notion of the self which,in Lévy-Bruhl’s terminology, participates through dedication in templesor gravesites in the sacred space of the relevant divinity.Erotic MagicBinding curses that involve erotic magic reflect an important developmentin the genre. These curses typically ‘bind’ a victim so as to incite uncon-trollable passion, or erDs, in them. They are commonly called agDgBoragDgimonspells, which technically means ‘a spell that leads’, because theaim is to lead a victim to the spell’s practitioner.123Erotic curses also men-tion body parts, often with a violent overtone, by which the speaker of thecurse enjoins his invisible agents to retrieve his victim. But erotic cursesalso offer a transition into the fashioning of figurines, which represent thesecond major type of binding magic. As we are about to see, recipes forerotic curses can also contain instructions for the manufacture of clay orwax figurines to accompany them. Actual figurines made in accordancewith known binding spells have been found.In PGMIV, a magical handbook dated to the fourth century ce, whichcontains sections that date 200 years earlier124and was probably authoredby Egyptian temple priests,125we find a ‘Wondrous Erotic Binding Spell’(Philtrokatadesmos thaumastos, IV.296 – 469). It instructs its user to fash-ion two figurines, male and female, from wax or clay. The male is to bemade in the form of Ares, with a sword in his left hand poised to plungeit into the neck of the second figure, a female with her arms behind her9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 88"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Binding Magic and Erotic Figurines89back and kneeling. Various voces magicae or magical words with Egyptianand Near Eastern referents are to be written on her head, eyes, ears,shoulders, arms, hands, breast, belly, genitals, buttocks, and the soles ofher feet. Allowing for some variation, these are largely the same body partsmentioned in the Athenian and Minturnaean curse tablets cited earlier –key anatomical points of reference. After these body parts are inscribed,the female figurine is to be pierced with 13 copper needles – one in thebrain, two in the ears and two in the eyes, one in the mouth, two in themidriff, one in the hands, two in the pudenda, and one in each sole of thefoot – and while piercing each body part the user is supposed to say, ‘Iam piercing such and such a member of her, so and so, so that she mayremember no one but me, so and so’. Then the user is told to take a leadtablet, write the same spell on it, and recite it. It is important to distin-guish the piercing of this figurine, in the context of erotic binding magic,from any popular associations with Haitian voodoo (properly Vodou)dolls. The piercing of key points of the body, as revealed by the erotic spellthat is supposed to accompany the piercing, serves to stimulate thememory of the victim and keep him or her mindful of the magical prac-titioner. Figurines used in binding magic that aim at permanent injury arecomparable to Vodou dolls (such as the sixth-century ce examples ofTheophilus and Theoddros of Cyprus considered earlier), but eroticmagic demands that the will of the victim be bound to the practitioner’swishes, not that he or she be physically disabled or injured.An earthenware pot was discovered in Middle Egypt containing afolded lead curse tablet that has been pierced, along with a single femaleclay figurine – kneeling, with her feet tied together and her arms boundbehind her back, and pierced with 13 pins placed more or less exactly asPGMIV prescribed.126However, the figurine itself, unlike in PGMIV, is notinscribed. The tablet has been dated to the second or third century ce, andboth the tablet and figurine are now housed in the Louvre museum. Thecurse on the tablet closely follows PGMIV.336 –78, but it is not an exactparallel and does not include the last 88 lines or so of the recipe. This isimportant to note, since it suggests a certain freedom of variation and adapt-ability in composing actual curses from recipe books. Our tablet concernsa man named Sarapammon, who perhaps commissioned the curse andfigurine, while Ptolemais is the woman whom he intends to attract. Iquote the curse in full:127I deposit this binding charm with you, chthonic gods, Pluto and KorbPersephone Ereskhigal and Adonis, also called Barbaritha, and chthonicHermes Thoth PhDkensepseu erktathou misonktaikand mighty AnoubisPsBriphtha, who holds the keys of the gates to Hades, and chthonic daimones,9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 89"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"90Binding Magic and Erotic Figurinesgods, men and women who suffered an untimely death, youths and maid-ens, year after year, month after month, day after day, hour after hour, nightafter night.

If you do this, I will set you free.Note first the addressees of this charm, with whom the charm isdeposited. The speaker is hereby requesting that his charm be formallyacknowledged by the underworld divinities. The typical Greek under-world divinities are named, along with Ereskhigal, the Babylonian goddessof the underworld often identified with Hekate and Korb-Persephone,and Adonis (to be identified with Addnai), who is a Semitic angelic figureimportant in Gnosticism and magic. Anoubis and Thoth are Egyptiandivinities: Anoubis is the jackal god who presides over mummification, and Thoth is the god of wisdom, writing, magic, and underworld guide ofthe souls of the dead, whom the Greeks identified with Hermes. Later, the speaker adjures or ‘exorcises’ (horkizein), which means to bind to anoath, a series of Jewish demons.128This mosaic of identities has suggestedto some scholars that the professional magicians or scribes in late RomanEgypt who composed this text sought to appeal to a wide array of ethnicinterests,129as they almost certainly sought syncretically to coalesce thepower of different ethnic divinities. It also provides us further evidence ofa certain creative freedom in the composition of magical texts.In addition to the major divinities, lesser daimones, gods, and theuntimely dead (aDroi), both male and female, are also addressed.

This is a common phrasing in later curse tablets, as is thecontractual relationship the speaker sets up with the daimDnAntinous. Notethat at the end of the curse, the speaker says he will set Antinous free (apolusein) should he do his bidding. Later curses frequently exhibit a com-plex relationship between the practitioner and the demonic or divinefigures addressed. Here, we can observe that the daimDnAntinous is infact interested in his freedom, which must be interpreted to mean that hewill be relieved of wandering restlessly and, perhaps, of being exploitedfor further magical operations in the future131– but only if he agrees toundertake the practitioner’s wishes.When Ptolemais is found, the daimDnis to bind (katadein) herspecifically to prevent other men except for Sarapammon from having sexual relations with her. This raises an interesting question with respectto the figurine found along with the curse and stuck with 13 pins. We knowfrom the prescription offered in PGMIV that the genitals along with thebodily limbs and other features are to be stuck with needles. But we donot know how the piercing of the figurine in the genital region correspondswith the particular wish in the curse above that Ptolemais not have sexual relations with other men. For instance, is the piercing meant to represent some kind of blockage or restraint? If so, how does that corre-spond with the piercing of the eyes, head, and other limbs of the figurine?According to PGMIV, all of the piercing serves to keep the magical prac-titioner in the mind of the victim. But with a curse aimed at least partlyat preventing a woman from sleeping with other men, it is hard to believethe piercing of the figurine is not also sexually suggestive.Starvation, thirst, and sleep deprivation, which Sarapammon next asksAntinous to induce in Ptolemais, are common requests in erotic tablets,because they serve to distract the victim in such a way that relief can onlybe found in company with the practitioner. Moreover, such methods are meant to incite an uncontrollable passion (erDs) in the victim. The methods of torture that are called for in this spell correspond to a long-standing tradition in Greek culture that viewed erotic seizure as a patho-logical disease.132In many Greek poets, for example, erDsis explicitlycalled a disease (nosos). Whether depicted as a young, winged boy, as hecommonly is in classical period vase paintings, or whether spoken of in abstract terms, Eros often ‘melts’, ‘hammers’, ‘whips’, or ‘burns’ his 9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 91"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"92Binding Magic and Erotic Figurinesvictims. Eros is not only spoken of as burning or melting his victims. Inerotic magic, the burning and melting of wax figurines, sometimes calledkolossoi, are important acts, which can also be found in non-erotic ritu-als. For instance, burning and melting of kolossoican be found in publicrituals that establish oaths. In terms that are explicitly analogical, theoath takers are bound and wax figurines are burned, and the oath takersagree that should any of them transgress the oath, they will melt and dis-solve like the figurines.133The literary representation of erotic magic high-lights the melting of images. The most well-known example is in Idyll2by the Hellenistic poet Theocritus (fl. 270s bce). There a lovelorn woman,Simaetha, burns a wax image of her beloved, Delphis, in the hope that hewill once again passionately burn for her.134Apart from the metaphoricalconnotation of burning and melting in love, which has an established his-tory in the Greek poetic tradition, the act of burning is torture and is meantto induce temporary pain and anguish in the victim to prevent him or herfrom forgetting the beloved. Thus the common accouterments of Eros –the whip, the torch, and the bow and arrow, coupled with the emblem-atic ritual burning in erotic magic – strongly suggest that he “began hiscareer as a frighteningly demonic figure.”135It is in this vein that we areto understand Sarapammon’s further requests of the daimDnAntinous that when he finds Ptolemais, he is to drag her by her hair and innardsuntil she is subject to Sarapammon for the remainder of his life. We maynote, finally, that Theocritus’ representation of burning a wax figurine of a beloved does not actually correspond, at least in this instance, witheither Sarapammon’s spell above or the instructions for the spell given in PGMIV. Had they done so, there would have been no figurine ofPtolemais to unearth.FigurinesMagical figurines used in the context of a binding curse have been dis-covered throughout the Mediterranean basin. Figurines made of wax,clay, wool, lead, bronze, and marble have been found both on the Greekmainland and on the islands (Attica, Arcadia, Cephalonia, Delos, Crete,Euboea), in Sicily and Italy, North Africa, Egypt, Palestine, Asia Minor, andin areas near the Black Sea.136Some of the figurines have been found insidetightly closed “coffins” made of lead, with workable lids.137There aresome typical features of these figurines that have been conveniently sum-marized by others.138The figurines often have their limbs and legs boundor twisted, sometimes grotesquely, behind their backs to enact a binding.Some figurines have been pierced by nails. The head and feet, as well as9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 92"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Binding Magic and Erotic Figurines93occasionally the upper torso, have been twisted around, again as a formof binding. The figurines, and occasionally the coffins, have been inscribedwith the victim’s name and with longer curses. The figurines were discoveredin graves, sanctuaries, or bodies of water – all places associated in the Greekand Roman imagination with entrances to the underworld. There is a gooddeal of variation in the craftsmanship and realism of the figurines, fromrefined examples such as the female Louvre doll to others that are inten-tionally ugly and ill-formed. Finally, although some of the figurines wereused for erotic magic, as we saw earlier in the context of the instructionsin PGMIV, and hence to attract a victim, others were used to bind or restraina practitioner’s enemies.Three lead figurines, for instance, recovered along with their leadcoffins from the graves of two young boys (aDroi) in the Ceramicus in Athensand dated to around 400bceall show enlarged male genitalia.139It is unclearwhether the exaggerated parts serve an apotropaic or magically defensivefunction,140but the curses written on the inside of the coffins are judicialin nature – in other words, they are aimed at restraining an opponent inthe law court. In one case, as is common, the coffin is inscribed with thenames of the intended victims: ‘Theochares son-in-law (?) of Theochares,Sosistratos, Philochares, Diokles, and the other opponents at law.’141Then on the back of the figurine’s right shoulder is the letter theta(θ), andon the left arm, the name Theochares. So much is straightforward insofar as Theochares is the main target of the figurine, while his fellowopponents, so as not to be excluded, are named in the coffin. But an interesting variation on this pattern occurs with another figurine and itscoffin. On the inner surface of this coffin’s lid are the names Theozotides,Diophanes, Diodoros, and Kephisophos, misspelled for Kephisophon.The figurine occupying the coffin, however, is also inscribed with the samenames – Kephisophon (the correct spelling) runs down the back and leftleg, Diophanes on the left leg, Diodoros down the right arm and down fromthe back of the head, and Theozotides down the left arm and the outerside of the right leg.142David Jordan has argued that Theozotides is the target of the figurine, since because of the rarity of the name, he can beidentified with the father of Nikostratos, a member of Socrates’ circle,143and as having proposed controversial legislation concerning state stipendsin 403/2.144From the point of view of the magical operation of thefigurine, it serves to target not only Theozotides, but also all of his fellowopponents. Of course our inscriber might have taken it upon himselfmerely as added insurance, or out of convenience, to copy his victim’s nameson the coffin as well as the figurine. But this also suggests that differentusers understood figurines to work differently, and at least in some casesgeneralized a figurine’s magical power across individuals.9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 93"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"94Binding Magic and Erotic FigurinesThis should not be taken to mean, however – as is commonplace in theavailable scholarship – that magical figurines were viewed by their usersas symbolic. Simply put, a common view is that the figurines were fash-ioned, then twisted, bound, pierced, or whatever, to “represent” theintended victim. One approach along these lines has sought to comparethe binding of figurines to the binding of cult statues, for example that ofAres, as a restraint against the onslaught of hostile armies or pirates.145Whilethere are some important parallels in these kinds of examples, they leadinevitably to the conclusion that the operative magical force is sympathetic,understood in light of Stanley Tambiah’s view that magic is sympatheticin a persuasive, analogical sense.146But within that explanation resides anest of other assumptions that does not square with the broader Greekand Roman treatment of statuary generally, of which figurines can be considered a subset. I can illustrate the complexity of this treatment byrelating the story of the fifth-centurybceathlete Theagenes of Thasos.147Theagenes was renowned in his day for his relationship to bronze statues,which began in his youth when he carried an extraordinarily heavy statuefrom the marketplace to his house and back again.148According to Pau-sanias, after Theagenes died a bronze statue in his image was erected. Oneof Theagenes’ enemies, unable to wreak vengeance on him during life,undertook to do so in death and repeatedly flogged his statue at night asif it were Theagenes himself. ‘But the statue stopped the outrage by fallingon him, and the sons of the man who had died prosecuted the statue formurder.’149Prosecuting a statue for murder may at first glance seem absurd to themodern reader, but as we noted in chapter 2 the Athenians actuallyreserved a special court, the Prytaneum, for the trial of inanimateobjects.150They did this because what we would consider to be inanimateobjects – e.g., statues, wood, rocks, iron – were not as clearly so for theGreeks, hence such objects were held legally and morally responsible fortheir actions, just like humans.151In the context of this story, Theagenes’statue fell on its abuser because it was outraged – no differently than ahuman being – and it sought retribution. But there is more to the story.At trial, the statue was found guilty of murder and was sentenced, as wascustomary in verdicts of homicide, to exile. It was thrown into the sea, whichsatisfied the basic demand of exile that the offending entity be removedfrom the boundaries of the, in this case Thasian, community. But then theThasians were hit with famine and, upon inquiring of the Delphic oraclefor a solution, were told to retrieve their exiles. The famine did not dissip-ate and, by way of a second Delphic oracle, the Thasians realized that not only their former community members had to be retrieved, but alsothe statue of Theagenes, since it too was technically an exile. Fishermen9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 94"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Binding Magic and Erotic Figurines95recovered the statue in their nets, and the Thasians set it up in its ori-ginal place and sacrificed to it as to a god for appeasement, and the faminedisappeared.152Again we can see that abuse of the statue, this time in theform of exile, was met with retribution, in the form of famine, except thatthe statue is elevated in the end to divine status. This is because in thecontext of Greek religion it is divinities who typically cause widespread catas-trophe like famine.In anthropological terms, the statue of Theagenes is a social agent– itis effectively a human being and is therefore, from the functional view-point of the relevant community, treated like one.153As Alfred Gell hasargued, any object, whether animate or inanimate from our perspective,which is treated in significant respects like a person can be considered asocial agent.154This approach to objects has wide applicability in theGreek and Roman worlds, especially with regard to cult statues, becauseboth Greeks and Romans at various times considered them capable of phys-ical movement and expression.155Even where that attitude is not explicit,the range of effigies that were treated in significant respects like humansis almost too numerous to catalogue. For example, in the classical periodmonthly food offerings were set out before statuettes of Hekate becausethe goddess needed to eat.156The Greeks regularly cleaned xoana, orcarved wooden images, and dressed them in new robes – a practice thatwas preserved in the quadrennial public festival of the Panathenaia, in whicha new robe was presented to the statue of Athena in the Parthenon.Prayer was addressed to cult statues since, as some authors expressly stated,communication with the gods took place through them.157In later anti-quity, there are not only many examples of Greek statues that exhibitedhuman behavior like talking, moving, bleeding, and crying,158but also exam-ples of statues that were treated as sexual objects. Herakles’ return of Alcestis’mute, statue-like corpse to her husband Admetus, with its necromanticand necrophiliac overtones, is one example.159The most famous literaryadaptation of treating a statue as a living sexual object is the story of theartisan Pygmalion and his carved ivory statue, which was animated by Venusand became the mother of Pygmalion’s child.160However, there are sev-eral historical accounts of men actually sleeping with marble cult statues,which – whatever else one might think “really” happened – neverthelessindicate the profound effect that statues could exercise over people.161A complete account of the treatment of effigies cannot omit dolls andpuppets, which were described in Greek and Latin by a variety of names(e.g., korB, koros; nymphB; puppa,mania,bulla,effigies,imago). Ancientdolls have been found made of wood, bone, wax, fabric, clay, precious metal,and other materials. Although we have little evidence for how Greek andRoman children played, the care that is often given to the hair, clothing,9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 95"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"96Binding Magic and Erotic Figurineslips, and adornment of these dolls is further evidence for social agency andits acculturation in children. Now the link between children’s dolls andstatuary may not be immediately evident but, from an anthropological pointof view, cult statues are big dolls.162The ancient treatment of dolls in facthas directly to do with the ritual treatment of cult statuary, insofar as boysand girls dedicated their dolls to certain divinities, which were them-selves embodied in statuary form. In Greece girls dedicated koraitoArtemis in preparation for marriage, while in Rome unwed girls dedicatedpuppaeto Venus.163Roman boys, for different reasons, dedicated bullaeto the Lares,164which are numinous entities that probably had their origin as daimonesor ghosts, but were later associated with crossroads.In a rather striking instance of the role of dolls in ritual appeasement, onthe eve of the Compitalia, which was a celebration at the crossroads inRome and in the countryside, male and female puppets – each representinga free member of the household – and balls representing each slavemember, were hung so that the Lares might spare the living and acceptthe effigies as surrogates. The puppets are replacements for humanbeings, and as such they function as agents within a social network thatincludes both the living, who are visible, and divinities and spirits of thedead, who are not.It is within this broad network of ancient social agents, which is definedby interaction with statues and effigies generally as living presences, thatwe should situate the manufacture and deposition of magical figurines.In 1915 in an important, but today rarely cited, study of the Greek treat-ment of statuary in late antiquity, Charly Clerc argued along lines similarto the ones I am proposing here.165Clerc’s survey remains one of the mostcomprehensive to date, and he clearly saw connections between, forinstance, wooden images (xoana) and children’s dolls,166and between xoanaand magical figurines.167His theoretical approach to magical figurines, whichwas common at the time in classical scholarship, relied almost entirely uponJames Frazer’s theory of sympathetic (homeopathic) magic. But his over-arching view that the humanlike treatment by Greeks of images – under-stood to include the range of effigies we have discussed, from oversizedstatues to tiny dolls – ought to be interpreted within the same continuumis in line with my own. This continuum in the Greek and Roman treat-ment of statues and effigies should again caution us from assuming thatmagical figurines merely represented, symbolically or otherwise, anintended victim. As one type of social agent, it is entirely within reason toregard magical figurines, in view of the story of Theagenes’ statue, as cap-able of injury and retribution, if not of movement. If this line of reasoningis correct, magical figurines were abused through twisting and binding,not as symbolic acts, but literally to arouse their anger. In turn, it was9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 96"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Binding Magic and Erotic Figurines97expected that they would somehow discharge their anger on the intendedvictim or victims, hence the need to write their names and the desired curseon the figurine or on its coffin. After all, the figurines needed to know whomto attack.Er,tesWe can extend the model of social agency to include one final group offigurines not yet discussed that are used in erotic magic. In the followingexamples, we will see clearly that figurines could operate as agents of amagical practitioner, complete with a premeditated mission. I refer to thewooden or waxen images of Eros (erDs), from whom they take their tech-nical name ‘Eroses’ (erDtes). In two fourth-century cemagical papyri,PGMIV.1840 –70 and XII.14 –95, we find procedures described for acquir-ing Eros as a magical assistant. The procedures involve fashioning eitherwooden or waxen images of Eros (erDtes), consecrating them with fruit offerings, sacrifices, and spells to animate them, then sending them toaccomplish erotic magic – literally sending them out by flight to attractwhichever man or woman the practitioner desires to retrieve. In additionto the actual Greco-Egyptian spells, we are fortunate to possess a text by the second-century ce author Lucian of Samosata (Philopseudes34.14)that describes how erDteswork and offers some indication that animatingEros figurines was a distinctive and well-known procedure.168In Lucian’s Philopseudeswe find numerous miraculous stories of foreign magicians, notably that of an unnamed Hyperborean who can fly,walk on water, and walk through fire barefoot (34.13). These are his greatfeats. Among his trivial feats, he can, much like a typical itinerant religiousspecialist or witch in the classical period, call forth daimones, the dead,make the goddess Hekate appear, draw down the moon – and send erDtesto people. As Lucian relates it, the Hyperborean once offered his servicesto a young man named Glaucias, who had just inherited his deceasedfather’s estate and fallen in love with a married woman named Chrysis.The young man paid four minasin advance to sleep with Chrysis, andpromised sixteen if he should succeed. The Hyperborean did severalthings in preparation, including waiting for a waxing moon, digging a pit in the courtyard of the house to summon Glaucias’ dead father,Alexicles, for his approval, and then he summoned Hekate. Alexicles at firstdisapproves of the union and becomes angered, but eventually consents.Finally, the Hyperborean fashioned a little Eros (erDtion) from clay, andordered it to go and fetch Chrysis. Next we read that ‘the clay flew awayand soon [Chrysis] stood on the threshold knocking on the door, came in9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 97"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"98Binding Magic and Erotic Figurinesand embraced Glaucias as if she were madly in love with him, and sleptwith him until we heard the cocks crowing’ (34.14).Although Lucian does not describe in any detail how the Hyperboreanfashioned the Eros figurine, two such spells survive in the Greco-Egyptianmagical papyri. First, in PGMIV.1716 –1870, we have an erotic spell thatbegins by consecrating a magnet inscribed with images of Aphrodite sitting astride Psyche and holding her hair, while Eros stands beneath Psyche holding a torch and burning her. We saw earlier how torches and burning are among the standard means that Eros employs to inflamehis victims with desire. But this is also a reference to the famous love story of Amor (Cupid/Eros) and Psyche, as told by Apuleius.169The magnet is to be placed in the mouth, and a longer spell is said, with the aim of turning the soul of the victim toward the practitioner ‘so thatshe may love me and feel passion for me, so that she may give me whatis in her power’ (1807–10). A burnt offering is also required, which is said to ‘ensoul’ (\\μψυχοTν) Eros and the entire rite – in other words, to animate him. Finally, there is the rite for acquiring Eros as an assistant(PGMIV.1842–71):There is also a rite for acquiring an assistant, which is made from mulberrywood. A winged Eros is made, having a cloak, his right foot put forward andhaving a hollow back. Into the hollow put a gold leaf after writing so andso’s name with a cold-forged, copper stylus [and]: “MARSABOUTARTHE –be my assistant and helper and sender of dreams.” Go late at night to thehouse of the woman you want, knock on her door with the Eros and say:“Behold, so and so dwells here; stand beside her and, after assuming the like-ness of the god or daimDnshe worships, say what I propose.” And go to yourhome, set the table, spread a pure linen cloth and seasonal flowers, and setthe figurine upon it. Then make a burnt offering to it and continuously saythe invocation. And send him and he will act without fail. Whenever you turn[her to your will] with the magnet, on that night he sends dreams; for on adifferent night he is busy with other things.The second example comes from PGMXII.14 –95 and offers the mostextensive rite for fashioning an Eros. Among the operations this rite of Eroscan complete, we are told that he can send dreams or cause sleeplessnessand, if used in a proper and holy manner, he can also free one from anangry spirit. The practitioner is to mix wax with every kind of aromatic plant,then fashion a torch-bearing Eros about 5 inches high with a large baseto support it. A bow and arrow is to be placed in his left hand and, as inthe previous spell, a figurine of Psyche much like that of Eros is to be made.At this point, the practitioner is to conduct a three-day consecration: he is to present Eros with fresh fruits of every kind, seven cakes, seven9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 98"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Binding Magic and Erotic Figurines99pinecones, sweetmeats, and seven lamps. In addition there are to be dag-gers, votive tablets, a bow and arrow, dates, and a bowl of honeyed wine.Next the Eros is to be placed on a table with the fruit and he is to hold theseven lamps as they blaze with clear olive oil. Specifically, we are told thatall of this is to be done ‘so as to persuade the wondrous Eros’ (XII.26); how-ever, this is not quite the same thing as the persuasive, analogical magicas formulated by Tambiah.One detail in the description of the first day of consecration of this Eros that we do not find elsewhere is the mention of strangling seven birds.This is necessary in order to animate the figurine, understood in literal not analogical terms. A pure altar is to be built for the Eros, and unbakedbricks are to be fashioned into little trees on which fruit-bearing branchesare laid. Then a cock, partridge, wren, pigeon, turtledove, and any twonestlings are to be captured but not made into a burnt offering (PGMXII.32–35):Do not make a burnt offering of all these, but taking them in hand you willchoke them while holding them up to Eros, until each of the animals suffo-cates and their breath enters him. And then place the strangled creatures onthe altar with aromatic plants of every variety.These actions may seem ghastly to a modern reader, but the practice ofstrangling animals so as to transfer their breath to an image of a divinitydoes occur elsewhere in late antique magic. In another spell in the mag-ical papyri, for instance, we hear that one ought to ‘sacrifice a rooster, sothe god may ungrudgingly take the breath (pneuma)’.170In this respect,the transfer of breath from an image to a divinity is not enacted symbol-ically but literally, and the final exhalation of the victim becomes the firstinhalation of the newly animated divinity. In addition, on the second dayof consecration in PGMXII.14 –95, a male chick is to be strangled and thenburnt for Eros as a whole offering, while on the third day another chick isto be placed on Eros’ altar, then consumed by the practitioner. If theseactions are performed in a holy and pure manner, the practitioner will havecomplete success.As E. R. Dodds recognized in 1951, there is undeniably a theurgic ele-ment to the process of animating statues as it is attested in PGM.171Thetheurgists, including the Neoplatonist Proclus, advocated the ritual ani-mation of statues that culminated with the placing of the sumbolonor token(a piece of stone, metal, a gem, or an herb) into the mouth of a figurine.172This practice should immediately recall the inscribed gold leaf that was to be placed inside the hollow back of the winged Eros in PGMIV.1848 –54, mentioned above. The theurgist would thereby invoke the 9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 99"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"100Binding Magic and Erotic Figurinespresence of a divinity, which responded to the invocation not out of com-pulsion but out of overflowing benevolence. A common goal for animat-ing statues among the theurgists, which is very unlike what we have withthe erDtes, was for the statues to foretell the future.173Moreover, in all ofthese Greco-Egyptian spells, the animation of figurines for whatever pur-pose must be set against the generalized Egyptian belief that the imagesof their gods were ensouled.174The animation of erDtesin the magical papyri is also different from thepractice of the theurgists in other respects. When we compare the Erosrites to other rites in PGMfor animating statues (PGMIII.282– 409, Apollofor prophecy; IV.2359 –72, Hermes for business; IV.3125 –71, three-headedanimal for prosperity; V.370 – 446, Hermes for prophecy) the Eros rites appeardifferent because of how the figurines are treated by the practitioner. First,the offering of flowers and use of aromatic plants in PGMIV and XII, whichis not common to these other rites, suggests the long-standing poetic andvisual association of Eros with flowers and springtime.175The preponder-ance of birds in the Eros consecrations (esp. in PGMXII) does suggest thatan analogy has been drawn between the classical depiction of Eros as awinged divinity and the need to offer the figurine winged sacrifices as thesource from which he takes his breath. The Eros figurines are made withwings (as stated at PGMIV.1845), and we have already seen that inLucian’s Philopseudesthe clay Eros flies away (34.14.9).Recall that in PGMXII we are told that the three-day consecration is per-formed ‘so as to persuade the wondrous Eros’ (XII.26). I take this to meanthat simply animating a figurine of Eros and telling him what to do, as theHyperborean does in Lucian, is not enough. Rather, he must be enticedwith offerings to do the practitioner’s bidding. We might compare, forinstance, PGMV.395 –97, the animation of a Hermes figurine for prophecy,which only requires burning incense, a little earth, rock salt, and an invo-cation for him to accomplish what you ask. The range of offerings of seasonal flowers, fruit, cakes, pinecones, sweetmeats, and burnt victimsto Eros suggest that he needs quite a bit more in return for accomplish-ing the practitioner’s bidding. In fact, compared to the rites for animat-ing other statues, the amount of offerings to Eros is extraordinary. Notealso that in PGMIV.1842–71, after the offerings are made, significantly the practitioner is to take the figurine to the house of the beloved and actually knock on the door with the Eros.To varying degrees all of these examples can be better understood withreference to social agency. In the context of erDtes, we can appropriatelyask how the practitioners of the rites socialize the figurines. My conjec-ture here is that Eros is conceived in the spells, not unlike the visual depic-tions of him in vase paintings and sculpture throughout antiquity, as a young9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 100"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Binding Magic and Erotic Figurines101boy or a child. Indirect evidence for this view comes from the second-century ce physician Galen, who refutes the claim that those who experience erotic frenzy do so as a result of ‘some small and newborn godholding burning torches’.176Although this remark does not mentionfigurines, it confirms that in Galen’s time the conception of Eros as an agentof erotic suffering was as a newborn, or in any case a very young child.From our perspective, such a view helps to explain why the rites for anim-ation in PGMIV and XII relative to the others emphasize appeasement and persuasion, and perhaps why in the case of PGMXII.1842–71 somuch “food” is offered to the figurine – including nestlings and chickens.It also may explain why the user of this Eros figurine has to take it to the door of the erotic victim – the figurine literally has to be shown theway, which suggests that it is not socialized here as an adult that wouldbe expected to know such things. At the same time, the rite of offeringflowers and food to the Eros figurine is exactly what one might expect areal person to offer his beloved. Moreover, by taking the figurine to thedoor of the beloved and knocking on it as part of the spell, not only doesthe practitioner enable the figurine to find its way, the spell also enablesthe practitioner to go some way toward accomplishing what he has set outto do in the first place. The rite ensures that he may at least have an oppor-tunity to establish contact with his beloved.Unlike previous approaches to Eros figurines that are preoccupied withwhether they “actually” move,177the model of social agency used here isultimately concerned with how the users of magical objects deploy theminto available social categories. Late antiquity is rife with stories about animated statues and figurines of many kinds, as authors such asPausanias, Plutarch, Iamblichus, Apuleius, Lucian, and others attest. Butthey are not all treated equally. Showering an Eros figurine with gifts offlowers and sweets is to treat it like a beloved, but it is also to entice a youngand perhaps characteristically independent “child” into cooperating.Abusing a figurine in the context of a binding curse that identifies its victim angers the figurine and leads it, as we might expect from aninjured person, to ventilate its outrage on the intended victim. The termsof each case have to be examined separately, because not all effigiesbehave equally. In turn the rationale for the ritual treatment they receivecan only be understood once the nature of a figurine’s “personality” andbehavior has been determined.There are no simple ways to summarize the evidence for binding magicand, as an outflow of it, erotic magic. We have seen, for example, that theunderlying notion of binding in earlier tablets is often metaphorical,whatever the specific genre of curse, while in later antiquity the metaphortends to become literalized. Some attempts are made to restrain the 9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 101"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"102Binding Magic and Erotic Figurinesrelevant body parts as they relate to specific realms of activity – sotongues and minds are restrained in judicial curses, since these are therelevant features of one’s judicial adversaries, while in competitive chariot race curses (which we have not discussed here in any depth) therunning, power, soul, onrush, speed, and legs of individually namedhorses are bound since these are the most salient features to disable.178There is also the curious, and perhaps non-Greek,179feature that bindingcurses which enumerate body parts typically flow from head to toe. In somesense, then, we can say that the curse formulae envisage or project its target person – standing – as its language unfolds, body part by body part, but the reasons for this pattern as yet are unclear. Nor is it clear whybody parts accumulate in curses over time, as if a developing sense of “completeness” were at issue.Erotic magic extends the metaphor of binding into the realm ofMediterranean passion. Despite recent research in this area,180someimportant unanswered questions remain about Greco-Egyptian eroticspells. For example, the binding of external body parts is consistent withcurse tablets in other genres. However, in the second- to third-century ceSarapammon and Ptolemais spell from Middle Egypt we considered,181thespeaker also makes reference to dragging Ptolemais by her ‘inward parts’(τvσπλiγχνα, l. 23) until she comes to Sarapammon. This formula is alsofound in other Greco-Egyptian curses,182but does not appear to be com-mon in Attic or other curse tablets.183There are other references to the innerbody parts of people in the Greek magical papyri – some of which are quiteshocking, as in the slander spell to Selene that claims as part of its slan-der of the goddess that she has made a headband from a man’s‘intestines’ (τvwντερα).184If it is true, as we have noted, that spells in theGreek magical papyri and those adapted from it were composed byEgyptian temple priests, it may be worth investigating whether their typical practice of mummification of the dead, with its elaborate preser-vation of internal organs, contributed this kind of local color. Interestingly,the Middle Egypt spell for Sarapammon does, after all, address itself tonumerous divinities including Anoubis, the underworld jackal god who presides over mummification.Figurines used in binding curses and especially the erDtesused in eroticspells dramatically illustrate the need to contextualize the use of figurineswithin the broader attitudes toward Greek and Roman statuary generally.I have offered Alfred Gell’s model of social agency as an approach to inanimate objects that avoids the trap of “symbolism.” But this is a com-plicated issue and approaches to it have never fully divorced themselvesfrom Emile Durkheim’s formulation of symbolic forms, or ‘collective representations’, which separate a literal and symbolic meaning in ritual9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 102"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Binding Magic and Erotic Figurines103action.185One effect of viewing magical figurines of any kind within thebroader context of Greek and Roman social agency is that it subsumes magical behavior into ritual behavior generally toward objects, in this casestatuary.186I have not dwelt at any length here on the scholarly use of the term ‘magic’ and its underlying conceptions, apart from the briefconsiderations in chapter 2, partly because good treatments are availableelsewhere, but mainly because I think the discussion is largely mislead-ing to the extent that it focuses on terminology rather than on specific ritual practices.187It is not, ultimately, a question of whether the Greeksor Romans called a given practice ‘magic’, let alone whether we call it that.Rather, the task at hand is to show which social – understanding social to include visible and invisible agents – constructions of communication,emotion, health, disability, the fragmented body, or integrated personhoodunderlie the rituals of binding and erotic magic that we find in theancient world.9781405132381_4_003.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 103"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4Homeric Incantations1212121Homer presents the earliest examples of magic in Greek literature,including the episodes we have seen with Circe, the drugs of Helen (onwhich see below), the healing of Odysseus’ thigh with an incantation,1andAphrodite’s magical strap (kestos himas) used to incite erotic passion.2Curseswere attributed to him3and there is some evidence that late authors, suchas Philostratus, conceived of Homer as a necromancer.4This chapterfocuses neither on Homer’s representations of magic in the IliadorOdyssey per se, nor on later biographical conceptions of him as a magi-cian. Rather, we shall here be concerned with the ways in which Homer’sverses were excised from his poems and used as incantations to solve prac-tical problems. Although the practice of using Homeric verses in magic isoriginally a Greek phenomenon, the practice itself extends from the latearchaic period to the Middle Ages, with earlier Greek examples eventuallyforming the basis for both Byzantine and medieval Latin healing charms.Some of these later examples are quite useful in helping us to understandwhy verses from Homeric poetry remained the authoritative source forincantations.The incantatory use of Homeric verses for healing ailments, disease, general misfortune, and, more rarely, cursing one’s enemies is a type ofmagic that is distinctive to the Greek and Roman worlds. On the face ofit, verse magic is straightforward: extract a verse or verses from an epic towrite or speak, accompany them with some sympathetic ritual, and voilà,one’s ailment is healed. But which verses does one take for a particularproblem? Moreover, why take verses from Homer’s Iliadand Odysseyasopposed to the works of some other poet? The reasons for this are com-plex but they owe much to the cultural and intellectual place held by Homeras the first divinely inspired poet. Although there were many great Greekand Roman epic poets, from the point of view of magical practitioners in9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 104"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Homeric Incantations105later antiquity neither a Hesiod, Vergil, nor the Silver Age Latin epic poetsheld the same authority and pride of place as Homer – the famously blindpoet who called upon the Muses to sing his Iliadand Odyssey.Our sources for the use of Homeric verses as incantations are quitediverse. They include Egyptian papyri, Second Sophistic literary sources,medical, veterinary, and agricultural handbooks, inscriptions on pot-sherds, stone amulets, and a gold tablet or lamella.5These sources are gen-erally concentrated within the first four centuriesce. However, the use ofHomeric verses for magic actually does not stop then but continues wellinto the Middle Ages both in the Byzantine East and in the Roman West.6The Homeric verses were selected from many different books of the Iliadand Odyssey, both from books that were considered genuine and from those,like book 10 of the Iliad, that were considered spurious by critics in anti-quity. Interestingly, preparers of spells involving Homer were well awareof ancient Homeric criticism. For example, in a spell attributed to JuliusAfricanus, a third-centuryceChristian author, we find extended passagesfrom book 11 of the Odyssey(PGMXXIII.1–70), and it is explicitly statedthat verses were incorporated which the Athenian tyrants known as thePeisistratids left out.7Of the verses in Africanus’ spell, some of them (e.g.,Odyssey11.38 – 43) were criticized in antiquity by the great Alexandrian literary critics Zenodotus, Aristophanes of Byzantium, and Aristarchus.There is some evidence outside of literature and the biographical tradition, which attributes the practice to early figures such as Pythagorasand Empedocles, for the efficacy of incantations derived from Homer.According to Alexander of Tralles and Rufus of Ephesus, the second-centuryceRoman physician Galen was said to have experimented withHomeric incantations himself, and to have found them effective in the treat-ment of a scorpion sting and for the dislodging of bones stuck in the throat.8Other second-centuryceRoman physicians, such as Marcellus, corrobo-rate the efficacy of employing written Homeric verses to dislodge bonesfrom the throat.9In this chapter we shall set forth the main principles onwhich the use of Homeric verses as incantations was based. Once thesehave been outlined, we will be in a position to apply them both toHomeric verses whose rationale in magic has not yet been explained, andto occurrences of Homeric verses in contexts not immediately associatedwith magic.Pythagoras and EmpedoclesBy and large the majority of Homeric verses used in magic wereemployed either to protect or to heal, but the exact origin of their usage9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 105"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"106Homeric Incantationsis not known.10However, the authors who first comment on it, such asIamblichus (second half of third centuryce), attribute it to earlier figuressuch as Pythagoras and the seer/purifier Empedocles, who were said tohave used Homeric verses as well as music to heal.11The mechanism bywhich the healing took place, according to the evidence in Iamblichus, waslargely purificatory. Unfortunately, we do not have direct evidence tosupport Iamblichus’ claims, nor do we know why early Pythagoreanismplaced more emphasis on the verses of Homer, and to a lesser extent Hesiod,than on the verses of poets like Orpheus and Musaeus, who were bothcathartic poets par excellence. About Orpheus and Musaeus it was wellknown in the classical period, for example, that their verses or books, inaddition to being employed as oracles, could also be used to heal diseasesor offer release and purification from unjust deeds.12In the biographicaltradition, Pythagoras was said to have had close associations withHomeric poetry. He was, for one, entrusted by his father for a time toCreophylus, the famous Samian rhapsode whose school of Creophyleirivaled that of the Homeridae from Chios.13Hermodamas, a descendantof Creophylus, was said to have been the teacher of Pythagoras.14Pythagoras’ favorite Homeric verses, which served as his epitaph, were said to be Iliad17.51– 60. These lines detail the death of the TrojanEuphorbus, the slayer of Achilles’ closest friend, Patroclus, at the handsof Menelaus. Pythagoras was said to have demonstrated to his disciplesthat in a former life he had actually been Euphorbus.15Perhaps we needlook no further than this evidence to explain Pythagoras’ perceived pre-ference for Homeric verses in his healing. What this evidence does notexplain, on the other hand, is why only Homeric – and not Hesiodic, Orphic,or Musaeic – verses are actually attested in the documented history of thismagical tradition.With regard to Pythagoras’ and Empedocles’ use of Homeric verses forhealing specific ailments, Iamblichus tells two related stories in supportof his claim that the practice originated with them. In the account ofPythagoras, we are told that he believed generally that music contributedgreatly to health.16In the springtime, he used to seat a circle of patientsaround a lyre player, who played while the patients chanted paeans in unison. The paean is of course the form of hymn especially reserved forApollo, the god of healing. Through their chanting, we are told, thepatients expected to become joyful, graceful, and rhythmical. At other timesPythagoras used music in the treatment of specific ailments. Afterdigressing to note that different melodies correspond to different emotionsand states of the soul (despondency, rages and angers, desires, and so forth),Iamblichus says that Pythagoras preferred the music of the lyre and that(25.111):9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 106"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Homeric Incantations107He used selected verses of both Homer and Hesiod for theimprovement of the soul.Of Pythagoras’ famous deeds, one is especially interesting: according to Iamblichus, he is said to have quelled the anger of a drunken youth who after a revel one night assaulted his mistress at the gate of a rival, with the intention of burning the rival’s house down. The youth wasinflamed by an aulos– a flutelike instrument that was especially dislikedby Pythagoreans17– that was being played by someone in the fast and excitedPhrygian mode.18So Pythagoras encouraged the reed player to stop andswitch to a spondaic mode, which is slow and solemn, and this immedi-ately restrained the youth and caused him to return home in an orderlymanner (25.112). This story was repeated numerous times in antiquity inslightly different form, both by Greek and Roman authors, usually in thecontext of discussions of the emotions and the effect of music on the soul.The second story Iamblichus tells is about Empedocles and it involvesboth music and a Homeric verse. Empedocles is, like Pythagoras, also saidto have quelled the anger of a youth, but on this occasion the youth haddrawn a sword against Empedocles’ host, a man named Anchitus.Anchitus was a judge who had sentenced the youth’s father to death, andin a rage the youth rushed forward with a sword to strike him. Accordingto the account, Empedocles was already engaged in playing the lyre forAnchitus when he saw that the youth was about to attack him, so he suddenly changed the musical mode to one that was sedate and soothing,and straightaway recited Odyssey4.221:19soothing sorrow and angerless, causing forgetfulness of all illsOnce he recited this line the youth calmed down and Anchitus was savedfrom death. And we are told that as a result of this deed later on the youthbecame the most famous pupil of Empedocles. Now the verse itself is ofsome interest because it illustrates a pattern that we will work out in somedetail in what follows. The line is taken from the scene in the OdysseywhenTelemachus and his companion Pisistratus are visiting King Menelaus andHelen in Sparta, to obtain information about Odysseus’ whereaboutsafter the Trojan War. After some conversation about Odysseus that leadsto lamentation, Helen decides to slip a pharmakoninto the wine, whichshe serves them to put them at ease before she recounts how she metOdysseus at Troy. Our verse above describes the pharmakonand itseffects. What is important for our purposes is that in the story ofEmpedocles this verse was chosen because it occurs in a narrative con-text in which similar effects of soothing and easing are at issue.9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 107"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"108Homeric IncantationsIamblichus’ story of Empedocles is probably apocryphal and it wouldmerely be amusing if not for the fact that the use of Homeric verses in magicis attested in many other sources and, at least early on, follows this pattern. Even if the story of Empedocles is unreliable, to a reader ofIamblichus in the late third or fourth century familiarity with this prac-tice from contemporary sources or experience would at least have madethe account of Empedocles’, and before him Pythagoras’, actions plaus-ible. As we shall see, the first secure literary depiction of the magical useof a Homeric verse is attested by Lucian of Samosata (b. ca. 120ce) in hisdialogue Charon(7.12–13), and there the aim of using the verse isspecifically to heal. This witness at least supports Iamblichus’ implicitassumption in De Vita Pythagoricathat the magical use of Homeric versesfor healing needed explanation, though of course it does not prove aPythagorean or Empedoclean origin for the practice.The Mechanics of Homeric IncantationsThe basic principle behind the usage of Homeric verses in magical contexts is analogical. Richard Heim, who compiled the first important collection of Greek and Roman literary verses used in magic, expressedthis well when he wrote that “some verses as it were agree with the mag-ical action or the disease to be healed” (nonnulli tamen versus cumactione magica vel cum morbo sanando quasi cohaerent).20This means thatthe choice of a given verse is determined by how well the action within itcoheres with the desired magical action. More recently, scholars haveemphasized the narrative context from which a given verse is taken, as inthe example of Empedocles above, as a determining factor in the magicalanalogy that underlies its use.21Others have related the selection ofHomeric verses to the use of verses from sacred books for healing, in whicha broader, “mythic” underpinning is tapped for its power to transform present circumstances.22It has also been argued, for example by invokingnotions of ‘traditional referentiality’, that the selection of a Homeric verseevokes a larger and more ‘echoic’ narrative context than the verse itself.23But this observation applies most strictly only to the earliest examples thatwe find, as for instance in Lucian. In Lucian’s Charon(7.12–13) the godHermes says that he can heal Charon’s short-sightedness quite easily bytaking a charm from the Iliad, and he recites Iliad5.127–28, where the goddess Athena is aiding the hero Diomedes in his aristeiaor moment ofvalor against the Trojans. The verses that describe how she invests himwith courage and the divine ability to distinguish gods from mortals formthe charm Hermes takes for Charon (Iliad5.127–28):9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 108"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Homeric Incantations109take away the mist (akhlus) from your eyes, which was there before,so that you may well recognize who is a god or a manIn the context of the Iliad, Athena’s aid will help Diomedes eventually tosee and wound Aphrodite as she is helping Aeneas (Iliad5.330 –33). WhenLucian’s Hermes speaks the same lines, they allow Charon to see moreclearly. In this example the narrative context of the verses structures themeaning of the chosen verses themselves, although a further analogymust still be drawn between the ‘mist’ (akhlus) of the verse and Charon’spoor vision.As we move forward in time after Lucian, especially between the second and fourth centuriesce, the importance of narrative contextdiminishes or is forgotten, and the action within a given verse or verse segment becomes predominant. At the same time, the verse or the actionwithin it becomes more broadly evocative, not of narrative context but of attributes or qualities generally thought to be related to the action ofhealing, protection, or, occasionally, harm that is desired. The approachthat we shall follow, which was in some ways anticipated by scholars almost70 years ago,24offers a vantage point from which to understand the ration-ality of this kind of magic. It will also offer important clues as to the typeof Homeric readers with which we are dealing.Obstetrics and GynecologyThree examples of verses selected indifferently to their narrative contextcome from the Greek magical papyri, as in PGMXXIIa.9 –10 (fourth or fifthcenturyce). In the first, we find that for breast and uterine pain in newmothers they are to write Iliad2.548:the daughter of Zeus nourished, and the fruitful land bore.This verse comes from the description of Athens in the Catalogue ofShips. The people of Erectheus, the Athenians, are the direct objects of bothverbs in this verse, which are not in the verse itself. Now it is possible thata verse such as this, taken from a description of the rich Athenian land,informs the background of meaning behind why it was chosen to relievebreast and uterine pain, but this background will hardly have had the sameresonance in late imperial Egypt. Instead, what is salient is that the versementions a daughter of Zeus who nourished (trephein) and mentions thatthe earth gave birth (tiktein). We can surmise that the verse was thoughtto indicate success in birth and nourishment, and that the magical9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 109"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"110Homeric Incantationsaction, unlike in the previous examples, does not depend on narrative context but inheres largely in the verbs themselves.From the same papyrus we find another verse, Iliad3.40, used to prevent pregnancy. A woman is either to wear this verse inscribed on amagnet or to say it aloud (PGMXXIIa.11–12):Would that you were unborn(agonos) and had died unmarried(agamos)Significantly, the context of these verses has nothing to do with pregnancy.They occur in the beginning of book 3, when Paris has just seen Menelauson the battlefield and in fear retreats behind his fellow Trojan soldiers. Paris’brother Hector then scolds him for his cowardice and after calling him astring of epithets, like ill-omened, woman-maddened, and a cheat, he saysthe verse above. To a woman desiring to prevent pregnancy, however, noneof that could be directly relevant. Indeed, the magical interpretation of thisverse actually shifts the meaning of the original Homeric Greek. In itsHomeric context, the adjective agonosis used passively in this verse to mean‘unborn’, whereas the magical practitioner needs to give it an activemeaning, ‘without offspring/sterile’, which is the more common latermeaning,25lest she wish herself out of existence. Although we cannot beexactly sure whether the verse is to be addressed to the fetus, the mostlikely audience is the woman herself at risk of becoming pregnant. Hencewhat is relevant is her desire for childlessness. The adjective agamosinthe verse above is not used in its Homeric sense either. As MatthewDickie has recently argued, the noun gamosin the Greek magical papyrioften does not mean ‘marriage’ but ‘sexual union’.26Similarly, I submit thatagamosin our verse (Iliad3.40) was interpreted to refer, not to a desireto be unmarried, but to avoid sexual union, which is more consistent withthe verse’s overall aim of preventing pregnancy. Thus we have two levelsof meaning at work in this verse, as if the situation of the woman seekinghelp were conceived in two stages: desiring to avoid sexual union(agamos) and desiring, should that first condition not hold, to avoid conception (agonos).This interpretation of the adjectives agonosand agamosfinds furtherconfirmation in the additional ritual procedures recommended in con-junction with the writing or speaking of the verse. If written, the verse should be inscribed on a magnet (PGMXXIIa.10), which is traditionallyassociated with contraception. In the context of ancient medical treatiseson obstetrics and gynecology, there was much lore that surrounded themagnet or “lodestone,” not the least being its ability to forestall uterinehemorrhage and to assimilate blood. Several ancient authors of medicaland pharmacological treatises record the use of magnets in these kinds 9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 110"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Homeric Incantations111of charms, including major authorities like Dioscorides (firstce), Soranusof Ephesus (early secondce), and Galen (secondce), which attests to the widespread understanding of this charm as well as to its fixed placein the repertoire of women’s medicine. Assuming the magnet’s ability to stop bleeding was understood by the Greco-Egyptian magical prac-titioners whose spells are the PGM, it has been suggested that it was not a far step to extend the magnet’s effects to contraception.27Indeed,the basic principle involved appears to be sympathetic, but furtherresearch is needed to clarify the exact relationship between the magnetand bleeding. For instance, if was it desired that a woman stop bleedingby using the magnet to assimilate blood (presumably it is the iron in theblood that causes the attraction), does this accord with how the cessationof menses was understood after contraception? If so, then we may have a typical similia similibus‘like to like’ magical framework, based on the simple analogy that the magnet stops bleeding, and contraception resultsin loss of bleeding, hence the magnet is useful in contraception. The problem is that in real medical terms the loss of menstrual bleed-ing signifies pregnancy, not its prevention. So it is still not altogether clear why the magnet’s ability to stop bleeding was thought useful in contraception.Be that as it may, in PGMXXIIa, after writing the verse on a fresh piece of papyrus, it is further advised that some hairs of a mule – a notoriously sterile animal – are to be wrapped around it. This pro-cedure is more transparently sympathetic because it is desired that the sterility of the mule be transferred through its hairs to the papyrus andthe spell written on it. However, the verse employed (Iliad3.40) is one of the clearest examples we have that the Greco-Egyptian consumers ofthis type of magic, whether temple priests or their non-professionalclients, were not always reading Homer in its original semantic context.28Verses like Iliad3.40 were extracted from their narrative context and“misread” – not as a result of illiteracy but as a way of semantically tailoring them to very specific and practical needs. Such a procedure also suggests that the verses of Homer used in incantations had achieveda measure of autonomy and independent agency by the fourth or fifth centuriesce.A different kind of example comes from the same papyrus, PGMXXIIa,which involves both speaking and writing a Homeric verse, and isemployed to cure bloody flux (haimar<r >roikon), which is possibly a reference to hemorrhoids.29The instruction for the person doing thehealing is to speak Iliad1.75 to the patient’s blood (PGMXXIIa.2–7):the wrath (mBnis) of Apollo, far-shooting lord9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 111"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"112Homeric IncantationsHowever, the instruction continues, if after the patient is healed he is notgrateful, the healer is to throw coals into a fire, place amulets in thesmoke, add a root, and write Iliad1.96:for this reason the far-shooter gave pains and he will still give themBoth of these verses come from the speeches of Calchas, the famousprophet who accompanied the Achaeans to Troy, and the lines refer to theplague Apollo sent among the Achaeans that sets off the events of the Iliad.Because Apollo is a god of both healing and harm, we can see how eachside of him is articulated through these verses.The first, spoken verse (Iliad1.75) seems to derive its efficacy from naming Apollo’s wrath with no further action specified, while the second,written verse (Iliad1.96) less ambiguously highlights Apollo’s power to give pain. In the first verse, one commentator has suggested that it operates by chilling hemorrhoidal blood,30except that it is not at all clearwhether this would be desirable, at least not immediately so. The reasonis that in the medical treatises associated with the Hippocratic physiciansas well as in the works of Galen, whose writings are still central to academic medical practice in the fourth and fifth centuriesce, we find astandard assumption that hemorrhoids are indicative of nature’s owncure. In terms of humour theory, nature is purging the body of excess blood, and periodic purgings were thought to be indicative of health.31We have a story from the Hippocratics that when a man suffering from hemorrhoids was treated for them, he actually went mad.32AnotherHippocratic author relates that when hemorrhoids are treated too soon,patients can suffer from inflammation of the lungs, swellings, sores, boils,and other diseases.33And Galen connects the premature suppression of hemorrhoids with dropsy, or an excess accumulation of water in otherparts of the body.34In each case, by suppressing the flow of blood in hemorrhoids, other fluids build up elsewhere. Although one must be cautious in generalizing from professional physicians to a practitioner of magic,35this evidence raises the strong possibility that Iliad1.75 is not aimed at curing hemorrhoids at all, but some other kind of bloody flux. Further support for this view comes from the fact that PGMXXIIa.5states that by speaking Iliad1.75 to the blood the verse ‘cures’ (iAtai) the ‘blood flow’, which is now termed haima<r >roia.36In the Hippocraticauthors the equivalent term (haimorroia) can refer to other kinds ofblood flow, such as the nosebleeds that young men under thirty who live in cooler climates are said to experience in summertime.37So while it is not necessary for us to settle on one meaning of haimorroia to make sense of Iliad1.75, the aim of the charm is clearly to stop the 9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 112"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Homeric Incantations113blood flow rather than let it take its course, giving us good grounds toexclude hemorrhoids.A context that better fits both the rationale of preventing blood flow and possibly the diction of Iliad1.75 is menstruation. The complexities ofmenstruation in the Hippocratic treatises have been dealt with by othersand a full treatment here is not in order.38However, a few relevant pointscan be made. The humoural basis to Hippocratic menstruation theory holdsthat because women absorb more fluid from their diet than men, the surplus in fluid needs to be regularly purged.39Heavy blood flow wasexpected, lest the excess fluid build up and thereby disturb the other organs, leading to disease or death.40The regularity of menstrual blood flow was based on monthly cycles, which is apparent in the Hippocraticterminology used to refer to it: katamBnia, epimBnia, and emmBnia(all com-pounds from Greek ‘month’ mBn).41In a pattern that we will examine further in due course, in which key nouns and verbs in a given verse relateor are made to relate to the ailment to be healed, the mention of Apollo’swrath (mBnis) in Iliad1.75 could have suggested a connection with the Greek word for ‘month’ mBn, which in turn made this verse appear relevant for stopping menstruation. Although heavy blood loss was con-sidered to be healthy, a passage in the Diseases of Womenexpected theperiod to last two to three days; more or less time than that was indica-tive of disease.42Moreover, checking excess menstrual flow was a concernin the Hippocratic texts, and procedures such as cupping the breasts (soas to withdraw the menses from the lower to the upper regions of the body)were offered as remedies.43In this context, it becomes possible that thehaimorroiaat issue in PGMXXIIa.5 is excessive menstrual blood flow. And for the thankless patient who is healed through Iliad1.75, the regu-lar recurrence of menstruation makes further sense of using Iliad1.96, alongwith the other ritual procedures, for retribution: ‘for this reason the far-shooter gave pains and he will still give them’.Such an interpretation of Iliad1.75 and 1.96 in the context of menstruation44adds to the impression that all of the verses offered in PGMXXIIa may refer to the medical issues of women. The remaining twoverses not considered here are PGMXXIIa.1 (= Iliad17.714), which is alsoused to cure bloody flux, and PGMXXIIa.15 –16, which is used to heal elephantiasis and utilizes Iliad4.141, a verse that specifically mentions a ‘woman’ (gunB) as well as ‘ivory’ (elephas, later used in post-HomericGreek to mean ‘elephant’). But we may be able to take this impression a step further. At the end of these prescribed verses, we find an invoca-tion to Helios ‘Sun’ and a reference to the ‘seventh heaven’ (hebdomos ouranos), from which at least one scholar has detected a reference to thegoddess Isis heptastolos(PGMXXIIa.17–20).45Thus the entire collection of9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 113"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"114Homeric Incantationsverses in PGMXXIIa may refer not only to women’s medicine, but also towomen who participated in cults of Isis. Furthermore, Isis was the mostpopular divinity in the Egyptian Fayem and delta regions, and wasspecifically associated with women and marriage, maternity and newborns,as well as being the guarantor generally of fertility in the fields and har-vest. If this line of interpretation is correct, it would represent the best exam-ple that we have of a collection of Homeric verses with a clearly definedgroup of patients whose specific medical needs – pregnancy, childbirth,menstruation – are being served. Finally, PGMXXII also illustrates how themore clearly a given constituency for the incantations can be defined, themore readily the interpretation and relevance of a specific Homeric verse– stripped of its narrative context – can be elucidated.Verse Combinations and the Power of MetaphorWe have other examples of Homeric verses that were selected indifferentlyto the narrative context from which they were drawn, which show acumulative magical effect when used together. Three of them are from book10 of the Iliad(10.521, 564, and 572) and are found together in three different places in the ‘great Parisian magical papyrus’, PGMIV (fourth centuryce), which suggests they were treated as a coherent set. They appearfirst in PGMIV.468 –74 (a spell for quelling anger and gaining friends) beforethe ‘Mithras Liturgy’, clustered with other verses.46Next they appear at theend of the ‘Mithras Liturgy’ in PGMIV.821–24, together with one other verse(Iliad8.424). It does not appear that the Homeric verses, although theydeliberately frame the ‘Mithras Liturgy’, have anything directly to do withit.47Most strikingly the verses reappear at PGMIV.2146 –50, in the broadercontext of 2145 –240, where they are written in larger letters than the restof the text. This incantation has a wide range of uses and will serve as our point of departure.The incantation is simply designated ‘Assistance from three Homericverses’ (PGMIV.2145) and the verses appear as follows:(a) Thus speaking he drove the single-hooved horses through the trench(taphros) [Iliad10.564](b) and men gasping (aspairein) in the harsh bloodshed [Iliad10.521](c) and they washed off much sweat (hidrDs) in the sea [Iliad10.572]It is possible that the narrative context, book 10 which in antiquity wasknown as the Doloneia, of these verses has some relevance here, especiallyfor verses (a) and (c), coming as they do after the successful night mission9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 114"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Homeric Incantations115of Odysseus and Diomedes to the Trojan camp, while (b) could certainlybe seen as having to do with conquest. But each verse actually has a morebroadly metaphorical meaning, which depends not on narrative contextbut on the action within each verse or within a verse segment.What has not been fully appreciated is that the lines immediately following these verses, PGMIV.2150 – 60, correlate respectively with eachverse and give clues as to the basic action in each verse on which the magical analogy is built. So for example, verse (a) above can be paired withlines 2151–55, where we are told that if a runaway carries these verses onan iron tablet he will never be found. What does driving single-hooved horsesthrough a trench have to do with runaways? In my view the analogyresides in both the notion of the horses and the trench. With regard to thehorses, what is significant is not so much that these are the famousThracian single-hooved horses (mDnukhes hippoi) in Iliad10, comman-deered by Diomedes, but the notion of mDnukhes hippoigenerally. Thephrase already has an independent existence in archaic Greek poetry andcan be found frequently in the Iliad(5.236, etc.), once in the Odyssey(15.46),as well as in elegy (Theognis 997, 1253 [=Solon fr. 23.1 W], and 1255). Itis their speed in particular that is highlighted. Moreover, we have exter-nal confirmation of their usefulness in healing magic because the samenoun phrase already appears in the first-centurybce“Philinna Papyrus.”The pertinent lines are (PGMXX.15 –16 =Supplementum Hellenisticum900.19 –20):Flee headache, flee. . . under a rock;As wolves flee, as single-hooved horses (mDnukhes hippoi) fleeThe comparison between the headache’s swift flight and that of mDnukheshippoiconnotes speed. In turn this comparison suggests that the phrasemDnukhes hippoiitself and not the action in the entire Iliadic verse (a)already indicates speed. When applied to the runaway, according to themagical analogy in (a), he will be too fast to be caught.The notion of taphros‘trench’ in verse (a) is also important. In the Iliadthe trench that is at issue is the one the Achaeans have dug around theencampment of their ships on the shore. In Sophocles this same trenchsignals the boundary between an as yet protected Achaean encampmentand the disaster that Hector creates by leaping it (taphrDn huper) and setting the Achaean ships on fire (Ajax1279). When extracted from itsHomeric context, the idea of ‘trench’, I submit, represents a boundary moregenerally.48We may recall that the verse is meant to help prevent a run-away slave from being caught, and boundaries, in a more abstract sense,are crucial here. Runaway slaves were common in Rome as elsewhere and9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 115"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"116Homeric Incantationsoften headed for harbors, secluded rural areas, or larger cities where theycould disappear into a crowd.49In the Digestof Justinian (533ce) we finddetailed definitions of what constitutes flight on the part of slaves. The mostimportant consideration, of course, is their intention, but we also find someinteresting spatial dimensions to flight that involve boundaries. The juristCaelius writes that a slave should be considered a fugitive if ‘he takes him-self somewhere whence his master cannot recover him and still more onewho takes himself someplace whence he cannot be removed’ (Digest21.1.17.13). And Caelius further records a case in which a freedman wasliving with his patron in an establishment whose premises could belocked with one key. One of the freedman’s slaves concealed himself fora night outside the freedman’s quarters, but still within the patron’sestablishment, except that because the slave had the intention of runningaway and not returning, he was nevertheless deemed a fugitive (Digest21.1.17.15). Thus the boundary between servitude and freedom can be bothliteral and metaphorical, as long as it marks the limit of an owner’s ability to recover a slave. On this view, the taphros‘trench’ in verse (a) represents a metaphorical boundary to a runaway slave, on the other sideof which is freedom, while the single-hooved horses represent the speedthat the slave will need to cross that boundary successfully.In a similar way, as scholars have recognized, verse (b) above correspondswith lines 2155 –56 of PGMIV, where it is said that by hanging an iron tabletwith the verses inscribed on it around a man on the verge of death an answerwill be given for any question asked. The analogy inheres in the percep-tion that the moribund are prophetic, and we have literary examples ofthis from Greek epic and tragedy, as well as from the Roman literary tradition of necromancy, although I have not found an exact parallel forthe actions prescribed in this spell.50The general action of men breathingout their last breath in battle (or maybe the particular verb aspairein‘to pant/gasp’, used only of the dying in Homer) coheres with a dying man; nevertheless, it is not the specific narrative context of the verse thatis determinative.Finally, verse (c) corresponds to what is said at 2159 – 60 of PGMIV. There we read that if anyone believes themselves to be magically bound(katadedesthai), they should speak the verses while sprinkling (themselveswith?) seawater. The action within the verse itself mimics purification ritual, and we know from sources like On the Sacred Diseasethat the off-scourings from such rituals were often deposited in the sea.51Once againit is the metaphor of purificatory action in this verse, and not the par-ticular narrative context – which involves Diomedes and Odysseus wash-ing, but not actually religiously purifying themselves after returning to camp– that is effective in ridding one of binding magic.52And this is altogether9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 116"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Homeric Incantations117more striking because elsewhere in the Iliadthere are verses such as 1.314, ‘and they purified themselves and threw the offscourings into the sea’,which does derive from a narrative context that involves purification, butis not used here or anywhere else so far as I know as a magical verse. Thissuggests even more strongly that metaphor and analogy, rather than narrative context, are governing the choice of verses used.There are many more uses for the three verses in PGMIV.2146 –241 thanI can treat in detail here. The spell has general protective properties, forexample, allowing contestants of several kinds – charioteer, gladiator,defendants in court – to remain undefeated. Further, wearing the tabletwith the verses inscribed will also keep away demons and wild animals;it will make one invulnerable in war and inspire fear in one’s enemies; it will create favor and desire in others to render anything that is asked; itwill make one irresistibly beloved, and so forth. All of these uses can beexplained in terms of analogy, as we have seen, or in terms of what we might call secondary elaborations that depend upon metaphors and similes that are created from the verbs, nouns, and noun phrases withinthe verses.It is important, however, to be careful when using the notion of ana-logy in this context, because some verses may give rise to more than oneanalogy. Let us look more closely at verse (a). In addition to being told howthis verse will prevent a runaway from being found, we are also told thatif this verse along with the other two are written on a tin tablet, and garlic along with snakeskin are burned, the tablet will be useful for over-turning a chariot in the games (2211–12). Since Iliad10.564 of the threeis the only one having to do with horses and chariots, this must be ourkey verse. But note that the action of driving single-hooved horses througha ditch is now highlighted for the damage an opponent’s chariot may suffer as a result rather than for the speed of a victor’s horses. We thushave two asymmetrically sympathetic actions that are metaphoricallygeneralized from this same verse – the first for speed and propagation, andthe second for hindrance. This example, more than any other that we haveseen, strongly suggests that caution is in order when analyzing the under-lying metaphor of a magical verse, because the interpretive process exercised by its users can be expansive rather than narrowly fixed. Sucha view, moreover, accords with Tambiah’s observation, which was drawnfrom an entirely different set of cultural evidence, that in magic “wordsexcel in expressive enlargement.”53The challenge is to disentangle themetaphors and analogies at issue and to understand how they worktogether.Besides verse (a), the other two verses presumably connote conquest (b) and protection or cleansing (c), which simultaneously allows the 9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 117"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"118Homeric Incantationscharioteer to be victorious just as verse (a) will prevent his opponents fromachieving success. The impulse to combine more than one verse to producean effect supplies further evidence that narrative context is no longer controlling by the fourth centuryce. New combinations of magical actionare being sought by using different verses together, as well as by enlargingthe metaphorical range of the action that is derivable from each verse.We can take this same approach to another benefit said to accrue to onewho has written the same three verses on a tablet, and then inserted it intothe fatal wound of a criminal: he will enjoy a generally excellent reputa-tion and will be loved by any man or woman with whom the bearer of thetablet has contact (PGMIV.2165 –79). In other words, these verses can alsoproduce amorous attachments. On the face of it, there does not appearto be any connection between the action within the verses and amoroussentiment, except in verse (c). If we look elsewhere within the magical papyri,we find that hidrDs‘sweat’ does at least have sexually procreative associa-tions. For example, in PGMV.96 –172 (fourth centuryce?), a text attributedto the scribe Ieu, we hear of the headless daimDnwhose sweat falls uponthe earth as rain so that it may be inseminated (152), and in PGMLXI.1–38 (third centuryce), a love charm, olive oil, and some other ingre-dients are to be placed in a jar, and the liquid contents are to be addressedas the sweat (hidrDs) of the Agathos DaimDn, the utterance of Helios, themucus of Isis, the power of Osiris, and the pleasure of the gods (5 – 8).Moreover, the sea was a common place into which charms of various kinds(PGMVII.420 and 437 [third/fourth centuryce], both spells of restraint),including erotic spells (e.g., PGMVII.464), were to be thrown – probablybecause seawater was long understood to have purifying effects. There-fore we can surmise that our Homeric verse (c), with its reference towashing sweat off into the sea, could have generated sexual associationsin another example of a secondary metaphorical elaboration, after the moreapparent ones of cleansing and purification.Intoxication, Choking, and GoutIf the rationale for the use of these Homeric verses as I have outlined it sofar is at least plausible, it does not minimize the fact that the reasoningbehind the usage of other verses remains less clear. Whether such verseswere as opaque to their users as they are to us is a different, although equallyimportant, question, but this is sometimes difficult to judge. Neverthe-less, given the model of interpretation for these verses that I have outlined,I think we can make some headway in understanding them. As one exam-ple, consider a recommendation from the tenth-centuryceagricultural9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 118"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Homeric Incantations119handbook, the Geoponica, which although medieval preserves much lateantique and earlier material. At one point it describes a series of remediesfor alleviating drunkenness. We learn that one can eat a cooked goat lung,for example, or before drinking one can eat almonds or raw cabbage, butif none of this works, one can say Iliad8.170 before taking the first drink(Geoponica7.31.1–2 Beckh):Then thrice from the Idaean mountains thundered Zeus of the counsels.Why was this verse thought to be effective against drunkenness? In the con-text of the Iliad, it describes Zeus thundering at the Trojans as a warningthat the tide of battle is about to turn against them. But according to thechronological model for which I have been arguing, I would expect thatwhen this verse became associated with alleviating drunkenness its narrative context did not matter at all. Although the metaphor of being‘thunderstruck by wine’ is as early as the seventh-centurybcelyric poetArchilochus (fr. 120), we can surmise that Zeus’ thundering in our versewas meant to keep the imbiber alert. Elsewhere in the Geoponicalight-ning and thunderbolts are negatively associated with bad weather, becausethey can herald too much rain that will harm the crops – and of the cropsmentioned the grape harvest is specifically noted.54But this seems too general a field of association. A more decisive explanation may comefrom the role thunder plays in dream interpretation, as reported by thefamous dream-interpreter Artemidorus of Ephesus (second centuryce).Amid the free-ranging dream interpretations he offers, two basic principlesunderlie them: the first is that the thunderbolt is fire and it is the natureof fire to destroy all matter;55and the second is that whatever is struck bya thunderbolt loses its characteristic properties.56Although Artemidorusdoes not mention intoxication specifically, his account suggests thatthunder was perceived, literally and metaphorically, to reverse a currentstate of affairs. I submit, then, that it is along lines of reasoning such asthese that Iliad8.170 was thought to negate the effects of intoxication.Another example comes from the second-centuryceRoman physicianMarcellus’ work On Remedies(De Medicamentis),57where we read aboutseveral spells for removing fish bones or other objects stuck in the throat.Two of these involve pseudo-Greek charms transliterated into Latin, andare accompanied by practical and magical procedures: one charm is to bespoken three times by the patient and then he is to spit; another involvesa second person, who is to massage the patient’s throat while saying a verse,preferably after secretly placing the backbone of the offending fish on topof the patient’s head. It is in this context, however, that Marcellus relatesa third possibility: one can speak Odyssey11.634 –35, from the underworld9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 119"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"120Homeric Incantationsscene or Nekuia, into the ear of the patient, or write them on a piece ofpapyrus and attach it to the patient’s neck with a string (Marcellus, De Med.15.108):Lest dread Persephone send out the Gorgonian headof a terrible monster to me from HadesThere are some syntactical problems that seem to have gone unaddressedwhen these verses were taken from their narrative context. In the Odysseythe verses are spoken by Odysseus, who reports that after seeing a hordeof dead souls approach him, he was seized with green fear, then followour verses, which are thus part of a fear clause. We should properly translate them: ‘Lest dread Persephone send out the Gorgonian head of aterrible monster to me from Hades’. However, in Marcellus the verses areout of context and instead function as a wish clause, technically an opt-ative of wish: ‘If only dread Persephone may not send out the Gorgonianhead of a terrible monster to me from Hades’. It was Roeper who first suggested that these verses ought to be understood similarly to a Christiancharm found in the medical handbook compiled by Aëtius of Amida, thesixth-centurycephysician in Alexandria and Constantinople.58In thispassage Aëtius recommends that for a bone stuck in the throat, the phy-sician should seat his patient opposite him, and then say the following(Aëtius 8.54.18 –20 Olivieri):Come up, bone, whether bone or stalk or whatever else, as Jesus Christ broughtback Lazarus from his tomb and Jonah from the whale.The comparison of this passage with the verses in Marcellus suggests thatin our Odyssean lines we are to identify the Gorgon’s head with the bone tobe dislodged. Gorgons can be conceptualized as the ailment – for example,gout – to be healed in some magical texts.59In other magical contexts, theimage of the Gorgon’s head appears submissively to that of a stronger animal, such as a cat that grasps at it with its paw.60But I do not think thesimile in the Aëtius passage above applies to our Odyssean verses, sincethat would suggest they were aimed at drawing the bone out. Instead, thegrammar of the extracted Odyssean verses clearly implies that the Gorgon’shead is notto be sent out from Hades. And while it may be the case that thegrammar was overlooked, we do have several examples of Homeric versesthat were consciously syntactically modified for their magical contexts.61So we must have to do with a request to prevent the bone/Gorgon fromharming the patient by requesting that it remain in the stomach, or in anycase below the throat – regions that, in the verses, are conceptualized as9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 120"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Homeric Incantations121Hades. In the context of Marcellus’ three recommendations for a bone stuckin the throat we have three possible outcomes: in the first, the patient speaksverses and spits, which may cast out the bone; in the second, the patient’sthroat is massaged, which could cause the bone to move out or furtherback into the throat; and in the third, verse-only procedure, the aboveOdyssey11.634 –35 verses are recited as a request that the offending bonesimply move down into the stomach and stay there.One of the most obscure uses of a Homeric verse is for the treatmentof gout. Alexander of Tralles (vol. 2, p. 581 Puschmann) recommendswearing a gold lamellainscribed with Iliad2.95:The assembly was in confusion (tetrBkhei), and the earth groaned underneath.tetrBkhei d’ agorB, hupode stenakhizeto gaiaWhat is remarkable about this particular recommendation is that a goldtablet or lamelladated to the third centuryceor later was acquired byDumbarton Oaks in Washington, DC, in 1953 with this verse actuallyinscribed on it.62The lamellawas rolled up, possibly for insertion into a tubular case, which probably would have been worn around the ankleof one of the gout-ridden feet. The verse occurs in book 2 of the Iliad, calledin antiquity the Diapeira or ‘Trial’, on the morning after the messenger of Zeus, Ossa, has misleadingly informed Agamemnon of Zeus’ intentionto grant the Achaeans victory. It describes the turmoil caused by Ossa asshe stirs up the Achaeans as they prepare to arm. But in view of what we have seen up to this point, we have good evidence to believe that narrative context is not at all relevant here. One scholar has suggested that one source of confusion, which might have made this verse seem relevant for gout, was that the verb tarassein‘to stir up/trouble’, whichgives us the perfect form tetrBkheiin the verse, was misunderstood byAlexandrian and later poets to derive from the adjective trakhus‘rough’.63The perfect infinitive tetrBkhenaiwould then mean ‘to be rough’, but I donot think this explanation is satisfactory.64In the context of contemporarymedical theory, a different explanation is also possible. Numerous formsof gout from mild to severe are discussed by second- to third-centurycemedical and literary authors. As one example, the Roman physicianMarcellus divides the ailment into two classes: he calls gout that is not severe‘cold’ (frigida), while he describes the more serious form as ‘hot’ (calida).He notes that the latter type would involve inflamed, red protuberanceson the feet.65Lucian, in a play entitled ‘Gout’ Podagra, has the chorus referto the more serious form of ‘hot’ gout when it describes the condition thus(69.123 –24):9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 121"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"122Homeric Incantations[gout] eats, devours, inflames (φλjγειν), overpowers, burns (πυροTν) and softens, until the goddess commands the pain to flee.Thus the Homeric meaning of tetrBkhei‘stirred up/troubled’ could stand,and it would then refer to the agitated nature of the condition.There may also be word-play with the Greek term for gout in the Homericverse itself. In Greek, ‘gout’ is ποδIγρα(Latin podagra, a transliteration of the Greek), and should properly be derived from pous‘foot’ and agra‘trap’, in other words, ‘gout’ is a ‘trap for the feet’.66While the term podagrais post-Homeric, the appearance (see the Greek transliteration of the verse above) in our verse of the particle and noun δ′ [γορu(d’ agorB, which is an Ionic dialect form for d’ agora) followed by the pre-position yπL(hupo) is extremely suggestive. If one were searching for a Homeric verse that contained the letters of podagrarearranged in an anagram, then our verse might have been selected and “misread” as if the words d’ agorB,hupo contained a scrambled reference to po-dagra. As we noted earlier, in magical texts of the Roman period (first–sixth centuriesce), we observe a heightening in the sophistication of wordgames in spells, including palindromes, acrostics, and anagrams. Theverse could then be interpreted to mean in effect that the gout was ‘hot’and the earth, Gaia, was groaning as a result. This accords too with theway in which Lucian describes gout, when he says that it is, after all, ‘thegoddess’ (zθεLς) who is responsible for it.67And among the many phar-macological remedies for gout that Lucian records, it is striking thatamong them are also ‘incantations’ (epaoidais), perhaps of the type we areexamining here.68Although this interpretation is obviously speculative, sucha reading gives the desired sense between the verse and the problem tobe solved, based on the model that I have outlined for how Homeric verseswere chosen.Incantations and DivinationOne important practical consequence of thinking about Homeric versesaccording to such a model, especially after the second centuryce, is thatit prepares us to entertain the possibility of magical intentions behind versesthat appear in contexts not otherwise associated with magic. Certainly wemust exercise caution here, because there is second-centuryceevidencethat knowledge of Homeric poetry outside of magical contexts, for instancein the symposium, could be extensive and detailed.69But the following two examples, since they have nothing to do with symposia and have par-allels with the material described earlier, demand a different explanation.9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 122"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Homeric Incantations123The first is an inscribed graffito first published in 1939, then republishedin 1950 by Jeanne and Louis Robert,70found on a wall in Rome dated to the second or third centuryce. It features five verses, Iliad24.171–75.There are some textual problems and metrical irregularities, especially in verse 172:Take courage, Priam son of Dardanos, she says, and do not fear anything.For I do not come here foreboding evil,but intending good things; I am, I assure you, messenger of Zeus,who although far away from you cares for and pities you.The Olympian commanded you to ransom glorious Hector.These verses are an exhortation by Iris to Priam to undertake the journeyto Achilles to retrieve the body of Hector. The Roberts suggest that sincethese verses are in effect a message from Zeus announcing his support fora difficult mission, they are apotropaic – a term that literally means to ‘turnaway’, for instance, evils, which I think is probably correct.The Roberts further suggest that the inscription was made following areading from a ‘Homer oracle’ (HomBromanteion), in which presumablyone of these verses appeared. This view deserves further considerationbecause it challenges the distinction between the divinatory and magicaluse of Homeric verses, but such a distinction is not always so clear. Theuse of Homeric verses for divination and incantations in principle shouldbe distinguishable: in divination, the verse or verses are thought to con-tain a prediction; in incantations, the speaking or writing of a given verseor verses produces a change of condition, along the lines of the ana-logical and metaphorical processes that we have outlined. In practice, however, we know that at least one Homeric verse used as an incantationalso appeared in the famous ‘Homer oracle’ (third to fourth centuryce),PGMVII.1–148.71Furthermore, consider the story in Lucian about the false prophet, Alexander, who is said to have disseminated the follow-ing pseudo-Homeric oracle to all the Roman nations during the plague of 165ce(Lucian, Alexander36):Unshorn Phoebus (Phoibos akeirekomBs), keep away the cloud of plague.The pseudo-Homeric quality of this verse is detectable in the phrasePhoibos akeirekomBs, as compared with the properly Homeric PhoibosakersekomBs‘unshorn Phoebus’ (Iliad20.39 and Homeric Hymn to Apollo134), while the remainder of the verse is also not Homeric. According toLucian, this ‘oracle, delivered by the god himself ’ (Alexander36.30) wasthen said to have been written over doorways as a ‘charm against the plague’9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 123"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"124Homeric Incantations(36.4 –5). Thus a Homeric verse delivered as an oracle could also serveapotropaic purposes against evils like the plague when written down inpublicly visible places. From the remainder of the story we can surmisethat Lucian is not parodying the practice of writing such verses down forapotropaic ends, so much as the belief in their efficacy: the point of hisparody is that those who wrote this verse actually attractedthe plague totheir homes rather than fended it off (36.5 –12). Of course this outcome isfunny. But the practice of using the same Homeric verses in divination andin magical contexts reminds us that inscribed Homeric verses, whenencountered outside a strictly literary context, can have a specific ritualpurpose.The second example of an unusual citation of Homeric verses occurs in a Florentine papyrus from the Heroninus archive, which is located in the Fayem area of Egypt and dated to the third centuryce(P. Flor. II259).72The cache was found in Theadelphia on the estate of Appianus, a prominent citizen and counselor of Alexandria who owned the estate untilhis death in 260ce. One letter in particular is of interest, and it involvesan exchange between two of the estate administrators, Timaeus andHeroninus:Timaeus to Heroninus hismost beloved, greetings.It is now time for you tosend up either the bags of grainor the price (for them); and letKiot’ know that if he does notgive the other sakkos(=3 art.) orcome up and pay his dues,a soldier is coming downto get him. But all the samesend them up. I pray for your health.So far we have here a fairly mundane situation in which Timaeus isrequesting Heroninus to make good on a purchase of grain and to reminda second fellow in Heroninus’ employ, Kiot’, that he too should payTimaeus or he will be arrested. But Timaeus also appears to have had literary pretensions, or so that is what the editors of this papyrus haveclaimed.73In the left-hand margin of this letter, in the same hand,74Timaeus has written Iliad2.1–2:The other gods and chariot-fighting menslept all night long (heudon pannukhi), but sweet sleep did not hold ZeusThey slept all night long (heudon pannukhi)9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 124"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Homeric Incantations125The literary jibe, as one commentator calls it, seems obvious: Heroninushas neglected his responsibilities and while he and his minions maysleep, others are keeping watch. To emphasize the point Timaeus has evenrepeated the phrase heudon pannukhi‘they slept all night long’. Granted,perhaps Timaeus was a close reader of Homer and knew that Heroninuswould appreciate his wit. But in a day and age when Homeric verses wereused so prominently as incantations and oracles, a strong case can be madethat Timaeus sent a different sort of message to Heroninus. In effect,Timaeus put the Homeric verses there as a little magical insurance to ensurethat in the larger scheme of things, his goods would be protected no matter what Heroninus did. We do not have to believe that Timaeus him-self was actually practicing magic or reporting an oracle on this papyrus.What was significant was that by quoting Homer in this way Timaeus drew upon the Greek and Greco-Egyptian tradition of using Homericverses in magic or divination. Thus both the Roman graffito and Timaeus’epistolary Homeric citation, when viewed in light of the magical and divinatory use of Homeric verses in the second or third centuryce, are bestunderstood not as literary but as ritualized gestures.Neoplatonic Theurgy and HomerWe may be able to appreciate the broader context into which the magicaluse of Homeric verses fits if we look to certain Neoplatonic interpretationsof Homer. The Neoplatonists may be summarized loosely as a philo-sophical tradition that took Plato’s writings as their main source of inspiration, dating from the first centurybcedown to the sixth centuryce. Several of the later Neoplatonists, including Porphyry (234 –ca. 305ce)and Proclus (410/412– 485ce), in addition to the writings of Plato also exten-sively analyzed the Homeric poems for clues to the structure of the universe and the divine nature of the soul. The long and complicated tradition that led to Homer’s divine status among the Neoplatonists hasbeen illuminated in detail by others and need not detain us here.75Whatis important is that the Neoplatonic tradition credited Homer with beinga sage with knowledge of the underworld and the fate of the soul after death.However, the writings of Proclus are particularly relevant for our purposes.In chapter 3, in the context of discussing how statues and erDsfigurineswere animated in the Greek magical papyri, we have already noted thatProclus described the theurgic process as culminating with the placementof the sumbolonor token (a piece of stone, metal, a gem, or an herb) intothe mouth of a figurine.76Proclus is also knowledgeable about the incan-tatory use of Homeric verses, however, and he alludes to the same two verses9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 125"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"126Homeric Incantationsdiscussed earlier that appear in Lucian (Iliad5.127–28 in Lucian, Charon7.12–13). By examining the theurgic ends to which Proclus puts these verses,as well as his understanding of what Homeric poetry was, we can betterclarify how the efficacy of Homeric verses was thought to operate in thefifth centuryce. We may also gain some insight into why Homer, above allother early poets, stood in the forefront of this particular magical tradition.Let us take the issue of what Homeric poetry was for Proclus first. For Proclus the highest kind of poetry possible was divinely inspired, andthus Homer, Hesiod, and the Chaldean oracles, to name only some, fellwithin that purview. Over the course of nearly a thousand years, througha complex series of allegorical readings, commentaries, defenses, and critiques, extending from Theagenes of Rhegium (fl. ca. 525bce), thePythagoreans, Plato, and the Middle Platonists, Homer finally emerged for the later Neoplatonists like Proclus as the most prominent sage whohad articulated in his poetry a profound model of the universe. TheNeoplatonists generally and Proclus in particular attempted to reconciletheir respect for Homer with Plato’s contempt for the mimetic dimensionof poetry which he castigated in book 10 of his Republic.77To circumventthe scandalous depiction of the divinities in Homer, such as the tryst ofAphrodite and Ares in Odysseybook 8, Proclus undertook detailed allegoricalreadings of his myths to show that Homer was presenting symbolicimages that referenced the cosmic order, but which were encoded in language that by definition corrupted the highest truths. Now much of this goes beyond our immediate concerns, but a passage from Proclus’Commentary on the Republicis revealing for its magical implications (I 86.15 –19 Kroll):For in all such fictions found in the makers of myths, one thing is generallyhinted at by another. In all that the poets indicate by these means, it is not arelationship of models to copies, but of symbols (sumbola) to something elsewhich has sympathy (sumpatheia) with it by virtue of analogy (analogia).Because Homer’s poetry was divinely inspired, it reflected the divine worldrather than the mortal one, which is why the model– copy relationship forProclus was not appropriate. Instead, Homeric myths are sumbola(or, inother contexts, sunthBmata) that have to be interpreted, and do not haveto be analogous in a strict sense to the truths that they express. Proclusdraws further on the notion of analogy (analogia), which does not holdthe modern sense that I have used elsewhere in this book. For theNeoplatonists analogiaoriginally expressed a mathematical relationship,but in allegorical contexts it referred to a correspondence between the surface meaning of a text and whatever metaphysical truths the text9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 126"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Homeric Incantations127expressed.78More specifically, sumbolato the Neoplatonists were certainanimals, stones, plants, and names (i.e., linguistic symbols) that werebelieved, when used in theurgic rituals, to attract given deities from theheavenly and invisible spheres into the material and visible world – theultimate purpose of which was to unify the theurgist with the One, the sourceof all godhead.79Theurgy (literally in Greek theourgiameans ‘divine work’or ‘sacramental rite’) was at once an intellectual, philosophical, and religio-magical program that various authors explain as the practice of bringing a practitioner into communion with ultimate divinity, the One.This unification was accomplished through sumpatheia, which for theNeoplatonists and Stoics generally was an ontological connection betweenthe visible, articulated world on the one hand, and the unified, cosmic worldon the other.With this as background, we can now turn to Proclus’ use of Iliad5.127–28. The Homeric verses are:take away the mist (akhlus) from your eyes, which was there before,so that you may well recognize who is a god or a manWe recall that these verses were uttered by Hermes to heal the short-sightedness of Charon in Lucian, Charon(7.12–13), and in the Iliadthey referred to how Athena helped Diomedes to distinguish god and manduring his fight against the Trojans. Proclus alludes to these verses in twoplaces in his Hymnswhich, as Van den Berg has recently argued, must be understood as “theurgy in practice,” and as purificatory instrumentsthemselves for attracting the divine powers.80Purification in this contextis still magical, although it is subordinated to the salvific aims of approach-ing divinity. In Hymn4, Proclus addresses the gods to whom the Hymnis dedicated (4.5 –7):Hear, great saviors, and grant me from holy bookspure light, after scattering the mist (homikhlB),in order that I might well recognize an immortal god from a man.For Proclus and other Neoplatonists before him, the pure light thatreplaces the scattered mist allegorically refers to souls descended into bodies that can no longer directly contemplate true reality. The dis-persion of the mist returns a noeric light to the soul, which in turn allows the contemplation of the (Platonic) Forms and living in accordancewith Mind.81This same idea is reinforced in Proclus’ second allusion to Iliad5.127–28, which occurs in his first Hymnto the god Helios ‘Sun’. Helios9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 127"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"128Homeric Incantationswas an important divinity for the Neoplatonists and Proclus as part of hisdaily ritual actually worshipped the sun at dusk, noon, and dawn.82Herewe read (Hymn1.39 – 41):may you always grant through your evil-averting aidpure, much-blessed light to my soulafter scattering the man-destroying, venomous mist (akhlus)The specific mention here of akhlus, which takes on a life of its own inNeoplatonic thought, links this passage quite clearly to Iliad5.127 and has the same connotation here as the word for mist (homikhlB) in Hymn4. Taken together, however, these allusions to Iliad5.127–28 are notmerely literary but magical – and, specifically, theurgic. The magical connotation of the passage above is also brought out by the reference to‘evil-averting aid’, which is a magical reference to the apotropaic defensethat Helios can grant. In both passages Proclus has allegorized Iliad5.127–28 to refer to the purification of the soul from the body’s dross.Whether Proclus learned of the magical use of these verses from Lucianor from some other source is not clear,83but he was generally aware ofthe Pythagorean use of Homeric verses for healing. In any case, the Iliadicverses and the myth to which they refer function for him as a theurgicalsumbolon.84We must be careful, however, not to confuse the theurgical use ofHomeric verses in Proclus with what we find in the other Homeric versesthat we have examined. As we have just seen, the ultimate aim of the-urgic ritual is to unite the practitioner to the One, to the ultimate sourceof divinity. Hence the need for verses that signify the dispersion of the body’s ‘mist’ or material veil that blocks access to true reality. Our otherexamples of Homeric verses are quite different. No higher or salvific motiveis implied in selecting verses to prevent pregnancy, bleeding, or gout, orto ensure the safety of one’s person or goods, other than to resolve thoseparticular problems. Arguably, the emphasis in these examples on solvingproblems in the material world itself disqualifies them from considerationas theurgic. Nevertheless, a conceptual framework as that provided by the Neoplatonists or Proclus offers the best explanation for why Homericverses in particular developed this kind of magical function.This impression is reinforced when we contrast the magical and divinatoryuse of Homeric verses with the ritualized use of biblical and especiallyVergilian verses. We are fortunate to possess one example of a veterinarytext that recommends a biblical verse in one instance, a Homeric verse in another. And the comparison between them is telling. In the largelyanonymous writings of the Corpus hippiatricorum graecorum(fourth9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 128"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Homeric Incantations129centuryce) we find a remedy for a mare having trouble giving birth(10.3.5): one should place a papyrus on it with Psalm 48.1– 6, up until the mention of the woman in labor. In these lines the mountain of Zion and the city of the great king are mentioned, and are revealed to theastonishment and panic of the Korahite kings. However, when a horse isinfertile, one should write Iliad5.749 (=8.393):moving on their own groaned the gates (pulai) of heaven (ouranos) whichthe Hours heldThis is the only example to my knowledge of a Homeric verse used in thetreatment of animals, but it operates according to the same general prin-ciples that I have outlined. We may only guess at the extent to which the‘gates’ and ‘heaven’ are generalized metaphorically to represent equineanatomy. But if we can regard infertility as a relatively more serious pro-blem than difficulties during birth, then it appears that the Homeric verseis the more powerful one.85Verses taken from the great epic of Vergil, the Aeneid, in contrast toHomeric ones, were rarely employed for expressly magical aims. They were employed, however, in divination by way of the so-called sortesVergilianae‘Vergilian lots’, although our evidence for this tradition islargely fabricated.86This practice was apparently similar to Homer oraclesbut actually had more in common with the sortes Biblicae‘Biblical lots’,which involved opening the Bible and selecting a verse or verses inanswer to a question.87We may also mention in this context the differentbut related practice of accessing selected verses through dice throws, asin the sortes Sanctorum‘Saints’ lots’ and the sortes Sangallenses‘St. Gaullots’ which then provided the answer to a question.88We first hear aboutthe sortitional use of Vergil in the fourth centuryce, but the practice is speciously attributed to emperors of an earlier time, beginning withHadrian (emperor 117–38ce). Outside of these sources, it is difficult to gauge the actual extent of popular usage of the sortes Vergilianae. Butthroughout the fourth centuryce(319 – 409), Christian emperors beginn-ing with Constantine issued twelve edicts banning all forms of divinationby any means.89As in the use of Homeric verses as incantations for healing, the under-lying intellectual framework that reinforced the efficacy of sortitionalverses was also fundamentally Neoplatonic. We have striking testimonyto this view in a conversation between St. Augustine, whose entire lifefamously turned on an oracular verse,90and Vindicianus, the formerastrologer turned court physician to Valentinian II sometime in 379/82ce.The topic is horoscopes and Augustine reports:919781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 129"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"130Homeric IncantationsWhen I asked [Vindicianus] why many true things were foretold by astrology,he replied, ably enough, that the force of the lot, diffused everywhere in nature,brought this about. For if someone by chance consults the pages of somepoet, who sang and intended something very different, a verse often turnsout to be wonderfully in accord with some present business. He used to saythat it was not to be wondered at if from the human soul, by means of somehigher instinct unaware of what was happening in itself, some utterance occursnot by art but by chance (sors), which is in harmony with the affairs and actionsof the inquirer.The Neoplatonic crux of this passage emerges not so much from the attribution to chance (sors) of a correspondence between a verse and agiven circumstance as it does from the recognition that the human soulexists in some sympathetic relationship to the universe.92AlthoughVindicianus is a former astrologer now, as he says, schooled in theHippocratic writings and devoted to scientific medicine, his view suggeststhat sortitional verses – and by extrapolation magical verses – were perceived to operate according to this general principle. This passage also gives us a rare glimpse into the mindset of an acknowledged specialiston the ground, so to speak, whose views offer a nice counterpart to theintellectualized, theurgical interpretation of magical Homeric versesadopted by Proclus.In contrast to the numerous sources for incantatory Homeric verses thatwe have seen, we have only one confirmed use of a Vergilian verse for magic,and its cultural context is unclear. In a tenth-centurycemanuscript containing Pliny the Elder’s Medicina(St. Galler codex 751), a remedy isoffered for quartan fever that involves writing Aeneid4.129 (=11.1):Meanwhile Dawn rising left the sea.This instruction only appears here, in an epitome to the third book of theMedicina, and its authenticity was suspected by the text’s editor.93But itappears to parallel the use of Homeric verses that we have examined aboveand may therefore point to a medieval (southern Gaul?), if not earlier, tradi-tion of employing Vergilian verses to cure certain ailments. Presumablythe fever is to be identified with dawn in this verse, so that as dawn leavesso should the fever. In any case, although the Latin evidence is scant, wecan say with some certainty that Homeric and not Vergilian poetryremained the authoritative source for incantations in later antiquity intothe Middle Ages. And as we might expect, it did so more in the easternthan in the western part of the Roman empire.949781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 130"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Homeric Incantations131ConclusionIn summary, the model presented here for the incantatory use of Homericverses builds on earlier approaches, but also modifies them in several import-ant ways. First, although there are analogies between the action within averse and the intended effect, as we have seen, we cannot depend too rigidlyon a static view of what a given verse means in its Homeric context to pre-dict its use as an incantation. Verses are interpreted metaphorically, andthen can undergo secondary elaborations of meaning to derive sometimescontradictory effects from the same verse. This process expands the inter-pretive possibilities of the verses as it does the range of ailments and issuesthat can be addressed through them. Moreover, we know that Greek andGreco-Egyptian readers of Homer did not always retain the Homeric mean-ing of the verses themselves. Narrative context appears to have structuredthe earliest Pythagorean and Empedoclean use of verses according to thebiographical tradition, and when verses are first independently attestedapart from that tradition in the second centuryce. But narrative contextlargely loses its significance by the fourth centuryce, as individual versesare invested with different meanings relevant to the changing social, cultural, and medical circumstances of their users.The Neoplatonist framework, which I have argued is important for situating especially the later use of Homeric verses in magic, allows us todraw some further conclusions. If, according to Neoplatonists like Proclus,Homeric poetry preeminently embodied the divinity which also inspiredits expression, then select verses taken from Homer, irrespective of nar-rative context, still contained divine power. On that account, the versesalso retained a sympathy between the cosmic and material world order.We are now in a better position to understand why verses were chosenthat appeared to cohere with the ailment or problem to be fixed: the sympathetic nature of each verse, along with the proper ritual proce-dures, was restorative precisely because it renewed the link between thecosmic and material worlds. Homeric verses healed because they originatedprior to the diminished state of the material world – hence they originatedprior to all human debilitation and ailment.9781405132381_4_004.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 131"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5Magic in Greek and Roman Law1212121This chapter moves out of the realm of understanding particular Greek magical practices and into that of its legislation. In order to put the legis-lation of Greek magic into a broader context that reaches into late anti-quity, where as we have seen many practices including the animation offigurines and the use of Homeric incantations were alive and well, we shallalso have to concern ourselves with Roman laws on magic. There will benumerous occasions to revisit particular magical practices – both Greekpractices that we have seen and some Roman practices that we have not– except that our guiding framework will be to understand how suchpractices violated, or were perceived to violate, ancient laws put in placeto protect the integrity of citizens and the state. Our discussion at the endof this chapter looks forward to the early medieval Christian interpreta-tions of Roman laws against magic. As we have alluded to in chapter 1,some understanding of this is important because the legal basis for theprosecution of late medieval and early modern witchcraft has its origin inRoman law. And it was not by coincidence, but rather by the authority ofan earlier tradition, that Roman jurists sought Greek precedents for theirown understanding of magic and its effects.There are several further reasons for extending our study of the legisla-tion against magic into the high imperial Roman period. First, Rome hasvery few truly indigenous magical practices – most of the Greek magic wehave reviewed up to this point, including incantations, drugs, binding curses,and figurines, find such close parallels in Rome and throughout itsempire that they can only be explained by appealing to absorption andadaptation. In some cases, as with curse tablets, the vast majority are writ-ten in Greek including those found in predominantly Latin-speakingprovinces, while the Latin tablets we do have clearly derive from Greekmodels. Second, Greek, in addition to Roman, practitioners of magic9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 132"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Magic in Greek and Roman Law133were prosecuted under Roman law, and in late antiquity we find evidencefor a stereotype among upper-class Romans that Greeks, in particular, wereadept at magic.1Third, from the point of view of later antiquity (especiallythe third–sixth centuries) attitudes among Roman emperors, jurists, and,after the Christianization of Rome, Church Fathers hardened considerablytoward magic, and it did not occur to them to draw sharp distinctionsbetween ‘Greek’ and ‘Roman’ magic. Because many of the activities they sought to legislate were given their fundamental shape in Greece,instead we often find Roman writers seeking the precise Greek termino-logy to explain Latin concepts. On the other hand, Roman authors didadvance their own interpretations to explain and justify legislationagainst magical practices, and it is here where we find several distinctivelyRoman innovations.Magic in Greek Law and Legal ImaginationThere is surprisingly little evidence for a concern in Greek law of the classical period with magic.2For some city-states, like Athens, no legisla-tion survives that directly concerns magic of any kind, while in others likeTeos, on the coast north of Ephesus in Asia Minor, there is at least onenarrow prohibition against the manufacture of harmful drugs, which may or may not have to do with magic. About the broader range of magical activities that we have seen, including purifications, incanta-tions, the multiple families of curse tablets, binding spells, and figurines,Greek law is inexplicably silent. It is important, however, not to assumethat the absence of legislation denotes the absence of concern withmagic, nor do we have a full corpus of Athenian law on which to base ourjudgments. Nevertheless, there is a good deal of indirect evidence that sometypes of magic were considered more harmful than others, and thatharmful magic could lead to damage to person or property. We have several legal cases, both real and hypothetical, that indicate a serious legal concern with the effects of magic, especially where it results ininjury or death.The legislative concerns that we do find in Athens and elsewhere, however, tend to converge primarily around the use of pharmaka(sg. pharmakon), a term that as we have seen basically means plant-based‘drugs’. The term pharmakonis notoriously ambiguous, and is employedregularly by medical writers to mean ‘medicines’, while in other contextsit can mean ‘poisons’.3However, in magical contexts of all kinds pharmakacan refer to drugs and, in some instances, spells more generally, as doesits abstract noun pharmakeia‘magic’ and derivative verb pharmattein9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 133"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"134Magic in Greek and Roman Law‘to bewitch’. The ambiguity of pharmakonpersists well into the Romanperiod. The equivalent Latin term for ‘poison/medicine/magical drug’ is venenumand it exhibits the same indeterminacy. In erotic magicalcontexts, pharmakaspecifically refers to ‘philtres’, or love potions, forinstance those given to men so as to revive their affection for a lover orconcubine. Technically, ‘philtres’ translates Greek philtra, but philtraand pharmakaoverlap in contexts of erotic magic.4In its earliest magicalattestations in the Iliadand Odysseyof Homer, pharmakaare usuallyqualified by adjectives that signal whether they are beneficial or harmful.5This provides further evidence that even in magical contexts Greeks dis-tinguished between the pharmakonas ‘drug’ and the positive or negativeuses to which it could be put. In matters of ancient law, it is thus not thepharmakaas such that dictate what interpretation to give them, butrather the context and intent of those who employed them. In a given legalcase, whether to interpret a pharmakonas a harmful magical drug or asa helpful medical remedy sometimes hinged entirely on the nature of thedamage observed and on the testimony of the parties involved.Cases dealing with pharmakathat resulted in injury or death attractedthe most legal attention in Athens, and they are of interest to us becausethey forced the parties involved to clarify the exact nature of the pharmaka.6Capital cases, in other words those involving intentional homicide orinjury, were tried in Athens’ most ancient and revered court, the Areopagus,as we learn from Demosthenes and Aristotle.7Several types of deliberate(ek pronoias) homicide or injury fell under the Areopagus’ jurisdiction,including murder, bodily harm, arson, and cases ‘of poisons (pharmaka),if anyone kills by giving them’.8But one man’s poison was another man’slove potion, and therein lay the rub. The penalty for intentional homicidewas execution or permanent exile, provided the exile was taken before thecourt issued its final judgment.We can compare this Athenian law against poisoning to a fifth-centurybceinscription from Teos, the so-called ‘Teian Curses’, which were to berecited every year by public officials.9It forbids the manufacture of‘harmful drugs’ (pharmaka dBlBtBria) – which significantly refers to thosepharmakathat harm or kill, not to all pharmaka– on pain of executionfor the perpetrator and his or her entire family. Whether the pharmakahere refer specifically to magical drugs is unclear, but as we have alreadyseen the term lends itself to multiple meanings, including magical ones.Nor are physicians singled out as the manufacturers, which rather suggeststhat anyone was capable of making them. The Teian edict above all is concerned with protecting state interests, and this is further confirmed bythe proscription that follows the one about pharmaka. At this time theTeians were regularly importing grain from Attica, and the next edict also9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 134"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Magic in Greek and Roman Law135punishes through execution of perpetrator and his entire family anyonewho disrupts the importation of grain.10In conjunction with several otherTeian edicts of the same character, it becomes clear that manufacture ofharmful drugs was considered a threat to order in the city. We shall seethis same concern revived in the proscriptions against poisoning in lateRepublican Roman law. Thus in the cases of both Athens and Teos, inter-ests of state and body politic are at stake in the prosecution of indivi-duals who manufacture and administer pharmaka, understood here as ‘poisons’ or ‘harmful magical drugs’. In both examples, the outlook is empirical – first there must be damage to person or property, then adetermination of a defendant’s intent. In the few cases to survive from theclassical period, the ambiguous status of pharmakaallowed both prose-cutors and defendants to advance competing and diametrically opposedclaims about what actually occurred.Trials for Erotic MagicA commonly cited case takes place in the orator Antiphon’s (ca. 480 – 411bce) speech written for the prosecution, called Against the Stepmother. This case involves the death of two male friends, one of whom is the fatherof the prosecutor and husband to the stepmother named in the title,while the other is named Philoneus. Philoneus had a mistress, who wasprobably a slave, whom Philoneus was planning to set up as a prostitute.Upon learning this, the stepmother befriends the mistress, shares in hergrief, and then encourages her to give both Philoneus and her husband a philtron‘love charm’, to which the prosecutor refers by the moreambiguous term pharmakon. This would renew Philoneus’ affection forhis mistress and the husband’s for the stepmother, provided everythingwent according to plan. Sometime later both Philoneus and the husbandtraveled to Peiraieus to celebrate the sacrificial rites of Zeus Ctesius, andafter dinner the mistress slipped the philtroninto their wine. She put moreof it into Philoneus’ drink, however, thinking that more of the love charmwould induce him to love her more. Each man drank his last drink –Philoneus died immediately and the husband became ill and died twentydays later.11The penalty for the mistress, not only because she administered the drugbut also because she was in all likelihood a slave, was swift: she was tortured on the wheel and executed. The stepmother on the other handhas been spared, and it is the nature of her involvement in the death ofboth men that is the cause for her trial. We do not know the outcome ofthis case, but the prosecutor alleges that the stepmother killed his father9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 135"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"136Magic in Greek and Roman Lawwith the pharmakonwillingly and with premeditation, despite the fact that it was the mistress who actually administered it. For our purposes,the important point is that this case turns on the determination of the defendant’s intent, not the nature of the pharmakon. Intent is the key factor in Athenian homicide law, as cited by Demosthenes. But note howintent also shapes the understanding of the pharmakonas the instrumentof death: if the prosecutor succeeds in showing that the stepmotherintended to kill his father, then the pharmakonis effectively a ‘poison’,yet if he fails and she is acquitted, then the pharmakonis merely a magical ‘love charm’ or philtron.Aristotle (384 –322bce) or a member of his school tells of a similar case in the Magna Moralia. In an account that resembles the one we havejust seen, the author refers to a case of a woman who gave her husbanda philtronto drink, from which he died, but she was acquitted on thegrounds that she had not intentionally sought to kill him.12Her defensewas that she gave the philtronto him to increase his affection for her. It turns out that there is a good deal of evidence from the classical periodthrough late antiquity that wives, mistresses, and prostitutes used lovepotions and other aphrodisiacs to retain or strengthen the affection of their male companions and clients.13Such a practice, for instance, is atissue in the widely known case of the mythical Deianeira, wife ofHerakles, who mistakenly and lethally uses the centaur Nessus’ philtronto woo back her husband, after he takes a keen interest in anotherwoman, Iole.14Although Herakles dies from the philtron, which had beenmade from the centaur’s poisonous blood, Deianeira’s attempt toincrease his affection for her in this way appears to have been among thenormal modes of recourse for disaffected women. Moreover, as thesecases illustrate, the argument that a drug was a love charm and not a poison evidently was defensible in court. Similar cases and charges canbe found well into the second centuryce, often involving wives or partners of powerful men at court.15Theoris, the Lemnian WitchApart from cases having to do with erotic magic, the only classical periodcase about which we have any detail that involves a criminal charge of magichas to do with Theoris of Lemnos.16This case has attracted a good deal ofscholarly attention in recent years, with widely divergent opinions aboutthe exact nature of her crime, as well as about the exact statutes underwhich she was charged.17The diversity of opinion is wholly due to the natureof our sources, which themselves conflict. According to our earliest9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 136"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Magic in Greek and Roman Law137account, Theoris was a ‘witch’ or pharmakisfrom the island of Lemnoswho lived in Athens. She was prosecuted sometime before 338bceallegedly for trafficking in incantations (epDidai) and drugs (pharmaka).On the testimony of her servant girl, who obtained the incantations anddrugs from Theoris, she was executed along with her entire family.18The execution of Theoris along with her entire family resembles the punishment prescribed in the Tean edict, mentioned above, for the man-ufacture of harmful drugs, except that Theoris was executed in Athens. Thisdiscrepancy has led to some debate about whether Athenian law wasmore lenient than that of other city-states with regard to the prosecutionof magic. An anecdote from Plato’s Menois often cited to prove Athenianleniency. In this dialogue, Meno has reached a point of bafflement withSocrates’ dialectic, and says that he has been bewitched (goBteuein),drugged or put under a spell (pharmattein), and enchanted (katepaidein)by him – all terms that are here used metaphorically but in other contextscan refer to actual magical practice. Meno then says that if Socrates haddone these things in any other city besides Athens, he would surely havebeen led away as a ‘magician’ (goBs).19The problem with this anecdote isthat Athenian law nowhere addresses magic or magicians in clear and certain terms. As we have seen, the only relevant provision addresses inten-tional poisoning, but this provision could, depending on the context,include magical drugs. Meno’s bafflement and benumbing, moreover,suggests the kind of effects that result from a curse tablet deposited to strikesilent an opponent at law. Yet defixiones, binding spells, figurines, incan-tations, and the like are all excluded from any mention in what survivesof Athenian law codes.The two remaining later accounts of Theoris introduce new details that cannot be independently verified. One claims that she was a ‘seer’(mantis) and was put to death after being convicted of ‘impiety’ (asebeia).20Many scholars assume that impiety was the formal charge againstTheoris. Impiety was a serious and actionable charge in classical periodAthens, as the example of Socrates’ famous trial attests, but the charge itselfwas usually centered on claims of introducing unorthodox views about thegods that were formally recognized by the state or of innovating in divinematters. No such evidence exists for Theoris unless we assume that, likethe Hippocratic author of On the Sacred Disease, the itinerant religious specialists who laid claim to magical expertise also implicitly claimed tomanipulate divinity. Some such reasoning would have to apply to Theorisin order to develop the basis for a formal charge of impiety.The final and latest account surfaces in Plutarch, who confuses the original unnamed prosecutor of Theoris with Demosthenes, in whose text(Against Aristogeiton) her account is first mentioned. Plutarch then calls9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 137"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"138Magic in Greek and Roman LawTheoris a ‘priestess’ (hiereia) and says that she was prosecuted ‘for com-mitting many misdeeds and for teaching the slaves to deceive’.21There isa strong possibility that Plutarch has confused the case of Theoris with thatof another famous priestess, Nino, who is mentioned elsewhere byDemosthenes and was executed in Athens in the 350s or 340sbcefor participating in Bacchic rites.22In what appears to be an independentconfirmation of that explanation, one commentator reports that Ninowas executed because her Bacchic rites mocked the true mysteries, and alater authority, the historian Josephus, adds that she conducted initiationsinto the mysteries of foreign gods.23Nino was also accused of manufac-turing love charms (called both philtraand pharmaka) and giving themto young men, but no further details of her magical activities in thisregard are known. Thus it is entirely possible that Nino’s main transgres-sion was to have conducted initiations for her patrons into the cults ofunknown or foreign gods, onto which the additional charge of dispensinglove charms to young men was later grafted. But if such magical chargeswere not wholly invented, they suggest that the range of activities for apriestess such as Nino or Theoris was understood to include the manu-facture and dispensation of philtres and drugs.This bewildering state of affairs in the evidence for Theoris only servesto remind modern readers how carefully ancient sources have to be scrutinized. It is probably correct to assume that the trials of Theoris andNino were not typical and might well have had political ramifications thatescape us.24On the other hand, the fact that both women were executedon charges that, in one way or another, attracted the mention of magicalactivity gives us some ground to suppose that adding magic to an other-wise actionable offense could only help to sully the reputation of thedefendant. Attention is sometimes called to an account of an anonymous,wealthy ‘woman magician’ (gunBmagos) in the fables of Aesop,25whichwere first collected by Demetrius of Phalerum in the fourth centurybce.According to the fable, the woman magician made her living dispensingspells (epDidai) to quell the anger of the gods. She was sentenced to deathfor ‘innovating in divine matters’, which falls under a charge of impiety(asebeia). Assuming the framework of this case is real and not merely afable, it has been argued that in the fourth centurybceusing spellsspecifically to placate the anger of the gods was liable to a charge of impiety.26But we should be cautious here. We have already seen in chapter 2 that several other texts, including the Hippocratic On the SacredDisease27and Plato in his Republic,28refer to purifications and magical practices specifically aimed at quelling the anger of divine spirits, whichsuggests that this was a common activity for itinerant religious specialists.It is hard to accept that, granted such common and frequent activity, our9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 138"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Magic in Greek and Roman Law139only surviving “case” that turns on this issue serves as the background toa fable, which may or may not actually date to the fourth centurybce. Surely,more references to such charges of impiety should survive given how wellknown itinerant specialists were in Athenian society and how flexibly thecharge of impiety could be invoked. Moreover, the upshot of the fable pointsin an entirely different direction: upon leaving the courtroom, a bystanderasks the woman magician how was it that she could profess control overthe gods and yet have been unable to convince the jury of her innocence.The fable points as much to the absurdity of such claims to divine con-trol, and to their inherent illogicality, as it does to the credibility of hermagical ability. In this it resembles the arguments of the author of On theSacred Disease. But we cannot use it to suggest a criminal charge formagic which, in the period in question, is otherwise wholly unattested.Plato’s Laws Against MagicSome support for the view that magical practice did not automatically entail impiety comes in the context of Plato’s discussion of the ideal punishments for the impious men and women who practice magic. In his discussion in the Lawsabout impiety (asebeia), Plato seems to acceptthat impiety and magic are two different things. Impiety is the more serious charge, and magic – charming the souls of the dead, promising topersuade the gods by bewitching them through sacrifices, prayers, andincantations – because it implies that the gods are negligent or open tobribes is an exacerbating factor. But in Plato’s view magical practice is incidental to impiety, which may thereby be enhanced and spread moreeffectively throughout the city-state and the individuals and families who comprise it, the more the impious magical practitioners are led in their efforts by avarice.29If convicted of impiety, such individuals are tobe imprisoned in the worst of three proposed prisons, namely the onelocated in the middle of the country in the wildest and loneliest spot possible outside the boundaries of the city-state. They are to be pro-hibited from contact with free men and, upon death, cast outside the city’s boundaries without burial – which is rather glaringly odd, becausethis is a recipe for the creation of more ‘restless dead’, the very agents uponwhom a practitioner calls in depositing a curse tablet. To my mind, at least, this leaves an open question as to whether Plato fully understandsthe dynamics of binding magic. Curiously, Plato also regards neitherimpiety nor magical practice as hereditary: the children of the convicted,provided they are fit for citizenship, are to be taken into the care of theguardians of orphans no differently than the typical orphan.30Such a 9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 139"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"140Magic in Greek and Roman Lawprovision is in stark contrast, for example, to the Teian law mentioned earlier that regards the extermination of both the convicted manufacturerof ‘harmful drugs’ (pharmaka dBlBtBria) and his or her entire family as fittingpunishment. In any case, although Plato’s imaginary laws cannot betaken directly to confirm the legal atmosphere in Athens, they do suggestthat at least in his mind magic did not inevitably entail the more seriouscharge of impiety.31As to the punishments ideally meted out to magical practitioners per se,Plato draws a distinction along two different axes: the magic (pharmakeia)either results in death or in injury that falls short of death, and the prac-titioner is either an expert or not. At issue is the harm (blabB) that is doneto a person, his employees, flocks, or beehives, and where death of the defen-dant is not required, the court will assess a penalty commensurate withthe damage. What determines a capital punishment is the professional status of the defendant. In a case of ‘poisoning’ (pharmakeia) that doesnot result in death, a lay person pays damages while a medical expert is sentenced to death. In a case of magic involving binding curses(katadeseis), incantations (epagDgai), or spells (epDidai), again a lay person is assessed according to the cost of the damage, while a prophet (mantis) or diviner (teratoskopos) is sentenced to death.32Athenian law didmake provisions for private suits for damage, whereby an individualbrought suit against his offender. If Plato has this form of legal procedurein mind in the cases where damages are to be paid, it suggests that wher-ever pharmakeiainvolves lay persons and death does not result, heregards these cases as private matters to be settled by the individualsinvolved. But wherever death results or professionals are involved, the resolution of these cases bears on the health of the city-state as a wholeand hence those responsible must be purged.33It is difficult to know exactly why Plato establishes equal punishmentfor the professional who peddles magic, regardless of the outcome, as wellas for anyone whose magic results in death. He does, however, give someindication of his thinking on this point. Earlier in the discussion, he hasoccasion to reflect on atheists, which to his mind fall into two categories.Both harbor pernicious beliefs about the gods, but it is only those who are intemperate in their pursuit of pleasure and pain, and who possesspowerful memories and sharp wits, that one need worry about. Heregards this group in particular as specially gifted by nature, full of guileand craft, and out of whom come many diviners (manteis) and experts in‘deception’ (manganeia, a term that also means ‘magic’). From this classtoo come tyrants, demagogues, generals, and those who plot by their ownmystic rites – which means rites that are not public and open to view –and the devices of sophists.34In other words, Plato regards professionals9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 140"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Magic in Greek and Roman Law141with what we might describe as a charismatic influence over others as especially dangerous, and his laws are justifiably aimed at containingtheir influence. But to execute a professional whose magical activities havenot resulted in death suggests that Plato regards magic in this instance asa pretext for the removal of men whom he assumes to have unworthy polit-ical or social ambitions. Above all in this respect, it appears that Plato holdsthe professional seer who practices magic in the lowest regard.35One is left to wonder whether Plato’s imagined provisions speak to somedeficiency in the Athenian law of his day with regard to magic – exclusiveof pharmakeiaor poisoning, about which as we have seen there was an applicable law in the case of serious injury or death. On one hand, Plato holds lay persons and professionals to sharply different standardswhen death is not involved, which may point to a view that in his day professionals, such as seers, were held to no further account for magic than their lay counterparts. On the other and more important hand, Plato clearly allows that binding curses (katadeseis), incantations (epagDgai),and spells (epDidai) can cause damage, which ought to be provable in court and for which a victorious plaintiff would thereby be entitled to recompense. We observed in chapter 2 that with regard to these types ofnon-pharmacological magic, Plato hesitated to concede that they exertedphysical effects in the world.36But, paradoxically, here he establishes a courtin which charges for such magic can be heard. My speculation is that thegravity for Plato of suspect professionals was such that, where they couldbe reached through charges of magic, a court needed to exist – even if the rest of its time were consumed in the resolution of relatively less important private disputes.Magic in Roman Law and Legal HistoryUnlike the sporadic concern with magic in classical period Greek law, wehave evidence beginning in Republican Rome down to the late imperialperiod of a sustained interest in the regulation of magical activities. Anunderstanding of key statutes in the Roman juridical tradition as they pertain to magic – and especially the Cornelian law on assassins and poisoners of 81bce– is important not only for its own sake, but becausesuch statutes give direct witness to how earlier Roman laws wereexpanded over time as the definition itself of what could be consideredmagical expanded. As earlier statutes were interpreted by later jurists, theirwritings gave the appearance that Rome had always condemned magicalpractice. Recent research, however, has drawn that conclusion strongly intoquestion, because already by the second centurycethe definition of9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 141"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"142Magic in Greek and Roman Lawmagia(Greek mageia) had become merged with that of maleficium,which originally meant ‘an evil deed/crime’, with no connotation ofmagic. Thus by late antiquity an explicitly criminal coloring was given toall activities that could be squeezed into a definition of ‘magic’. Yet earlier legislation was surprisingly narrow in its enumeration of whatqualified as magic – if it even concerned magic at all. This legislation was so narrow, in fact, that one can almost see the manipulation of judicial precedent at work so as to create the appearance of a seamlesslegal tradition.The Twelve TablesThe earliest Roman legislation concerning magic is found in the TwelveTables, which were traditionally composed between 451 and 450bcetogive a legislative basis to customary law. Much controversy surrounds theorder of the Tables and the exact meaning of their provisions, largely becausethe Tables are known to us through writers of the late Republic, startingin the first centurybce. It is worth stressing that although we depend onlater writers for our knowledge of the Tables, they have not transmittedthe statutes in the tablets that pertain to magic in an unambiguous form.As a result, in an important recent assessment of the tradition of the TwelveTables, James Rives has shown that these writers often imputed a later andbroader conception of magic to the earlier statutes.37This has the effectof making it seem as if Roman legal commentators were always talking aboutthe same thing with regard to magic, when in fact the Tables appear tohave been extremely narrow in their outlook.Two examples of how later viewpoints were retrojected onto the TwelveTables will serve as illustration. In the first, we learn from Pliny the Elder(ca. 23 –79ce), who is our most important source for the two relevant magical provisions in the Twelve Tables, that one law restricted ‘whoeverhas incanted an evil charm (malum carmen)’.38This provision has beentaken almost universally by scholars to refer to magic in the form of anincantation or spell, as it was by Pliny. However, it has recently been demon-strated that a malum carmencan also refer to slander or even to cursingin the sense of using abusive language.39While this interpretation does notrule out the magical one, the evidence as we have it does not permit usto say without a doubt that the law in the Twelve Tables refers exclusivelyto a magical charm, even if later authors such as Pliny thought it did.The second and more detailed example comes to us in a remark madeby the late fourth-centurycegrammarian Servius, in his commentary onVergil’s eighth Eclogue. Vergil modeled this poem on Theocritus’ second9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 142"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Magic in Greek and Roman Law143Idyll, and it concerns a lovelorn woman who uses magical means to drawher lover, Daphnis, back from town. The speaker says that she uses herbs(herbae) and drugs (venena), culled from Pontus in Asia Minor, which shehas witnessed turn men into wolves, call spirits from their graves, and ‘drawsown corn to the field of another’ (Eclogue8.99). In his commentary onthis line, Servius remarks that drawing sown corn to the field of anothertakes place through ‘certain magical arts (magicae artes); whence in theTwelve Tables [it says:] nor lure away (pellicere) another’s crops’. Serviuswas not the only author who made this connection: Augustine and Ciceroalso linked this provision of the Twelve Tables to the same line in Vergil’seighth Eclogue, which gives evidence that this view might have been common.40The problem, however, for us as outside observers is that bythe fourth and fifth centuriesce, the term ‘magical arts’ had very specific, negative legal ramifications that were not in place in the mid-fifth centurybce, while the Twelve Tables themselves nowhere mention herbs(herbae) and drugs (venena) as the means used to accomplish the trans-fer of another person’s crops.41According to Pliny, the second law from the Tables that relates toincantations is ‘whoever has enchanted out (excantare) the harvest’.42This law is the closest to Servius’ reference above to luring away sown corn,but it is important to note that the terms used by Servius and the Tablesas Pliny reports them are not identical. The verb used in Pliny’s version,excantare, is not common but does seem to denote drawing or attractingone thing from one place to another by invisible means.43The uncom-pounded verb cantarecertainly denotes recitation of a poem, performanceof a song, if not of a magical incantation. So it appears that a harvest couldbe magically – which is to say invisibly and imperceptibly – transferredfrom one place to another by means of a charm. Beyond the charm, themeans by which such a transfer was accomplished are less than clear.We have only one recorded case that was prosecuted under this pro-vision of the Twelve Tables, and it involved a Greek freedman named C. Furius Chresimus.44Toward the beginning of the second centurybce,Chresimus was summoned to court by his neighbors, who were enviousthat he had reaped from his small fields a harvest more abundant thantheirs, and they accused him of having attracted their harvests through‘magic’ (veneficium). Fearing that the vote might go against him, on theday of trial Chresimus brought his workers and farm equipment to the forumand proclaimed to all of his tribe members present that these were his‘magic’ (veneficium), nor could he show or bring to the forum his late nightlabors, his vigils, and his sweat.45The reaction was immediate and posi-tive, and Chresimus was unanimously acquitted. This trial illustrates thatthe provision in the Twelve Tables concerning the attraction of another’s9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 143"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"144Magic in Greek and Roman Lawharvest is fundamentally about the violation of property and the destabi-lizing effects this could have on an agrarian community.46But the fact that‘magic’ (veneficium) is mentioned both in the charge and the defense raisesthe possibility that it is by this means specifically that a harvest was magically transferred.The term veneficium(pl. veneficia) has two distinct meanings in Latin. The first is concerned with ‘drugs/poisons’ venena(sg. venenum47)and means ‘the act of poisoning/poison’. The second more generallyrefers to ‘magic’ and, in addition to that, can mean a ‘philtre’ or ‘magicalsubstance’. One who uses venenais called a veneficus, and the samebifurcated meanings apply: the veneficusis either a poisoner or a magician. Now it is important to stress that the ambivalence observed in the use of venenum‘poison/magical drug’ in Latin is roughly equiva-lent to that found in the Greek term pharmakon– roughly, because theLatin term does not include the meaning ‘purification’ as pharmakondoesin Greek medical texts.48Roman legal scholars or jurists were acutelyaware of the ambivalence of the term venenumand drew parallels with Greek terminology. As one example, the famous second-century law professor and jurist Gaius, who wrote a treatise on the Twelve Tables,once remarked:49Someone who says ‘drugs’ (venena) must add whether it is bad or good; formedicaments (medicamenta) are also drugs (venena) since under that nameeverything is contained which when applied to something changes thenature of that to which it is applied. Given that that which we call drug(venenum) is called by the Greeks pharmakon, among them also medicaments(medicamenta) as well as harmful drugs are included in this category.To illustrate his point Gaius next quotes a verse from Homer’s Odyssey(4.230), ‘drugs (pharmaka) mixed together, many good and many harmful’,which describes the drugs Helen places into the wine she offers Tele-machus, Odysseus’ son, and her husband Menelaus. Interestingly, this isan appeal, which is rare enough in the law codes, to Homer’s authorityon magic, and it gives clear evidence of the extent to which even later Romanjurists sought Greek precedents to define Latin magical terms.In any case, Gaius’ remarks thus give us some reason to conclude thatthe veneficiummentioned in the case of Chresimus specifically refers tothe use of ‘drugs’ (venena), and some scholars have taken this view.50However, the abstract noun veneficiumhas the same ambiguity as Greekpharmakeia, and can mean both ‘poisoning’ and ‘magic’, and the ‘magic’here does not always imply the use of drugs. Both pharmakeiaandveneficiacan refer to spells or to a generalized notion of magic.51This is9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 144"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Magic in Greek and Roman Law145the crucial point: it appears that when Chresimus points to his farmequipment and workers and refers to them as his ‘magic’ (veneficia), hemeans magic in the general Roman sense of the term, inclusive of but notspecific to having used drugs. Even if we could imagine the use of drugsto destroy a neighbor’s crops, the provision of the Twelve Tables refers onlyto the charming or luring away (excantare) of another’s crops, which is notthe same thing. On the other hand, the application of drugs to crops some-how to attract them to the field of another is unprecedented. A parallelfor such attraction does exist, however, as we have seen more than once,in the realm of charming and spells, as in the famous Greek example ofusing ‘spells’ (epDidai) to draw down the moon. Closer to Rome, theMarsi, a central Italic people, were famous for using charms to attract serpents, even while they slept,52while erotic attraction spells were the veryraisons d’êtreof Theocritus’ second Idylland its Roman counterpart,Vergil’s eighth Eclogue. It would thus be toward the more general senseof veneficium, rather than a narrow reference to drugs, that the case ofChresimus seems to point.The Lex CorneliaAs to why Vergil has the speaker say in his eighth Eclogue(published in 37bce) that she uses herbs (herbae) and drugs (venena) which she haswitnessed ‘draw sown corn to the field of another’ (8.99) – a statement thatin effect marries two different magical ideas – there is one significant expla-nation. Vergil does this because after 81bcethe entire Roman definitionof ‘magic’ (veneficia) had become bound up with ‘drugs’ (venena) with thepassage of the most important piece of legislation against poisoners(veneficus) – and later, magicians – the Lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficiisor the Cornelian law on assassins and poisoners. This law was henceforththe main statute under which all subsequent cases of magic were prose-cuted, partly because the very name ‘poisoner’ (veneficus) was the sameas that for ‘magician’. The law’s original intent could thus be flexiblyinterpreted as later generations of jurists, magistrates, and prosecutorsapplied it in specific cases.In 81bcethe Roman dictator L. Cornelius Sulla passed a legislative programme largely aimed at strengthening the power of the Senate. In addition to minor changes, he reorganized the system of standing courts (quaestiones) and increased their number, commensurate with his enlargement of the Senate to 600, which was more than double its previous count. Cases dealing with ‘poisoners’ (veneficus) and ‘assassins’(sicarius) had existed on an ad hoc basis at least since the fourth century9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 145"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"146Magic in Greek and Roman Lawbce,53and a standing quaestio inter sicarioshad existed prior to Sulla.54But after 81 poisoning and homicide cases were subject to Sulla’s new,expanded quaestioand were tried under the Cornelian law on assassinsand poisoners. The importance of this law for the future of Romanjurisprudence on magic cannot be underestimated, because it was to thislaw that all subsequent legislation against magic, in one way or another,related. Owing both to the ambiguity of its original terms and to the cre-ativity of later Roman jurists, the scope of the Cornelian law was gradu-ally extended by the third centuryceto include a variety of suspiciousbehaviors that were not originally within its purview.The original intent of the Cornelian law, as best we can reconstruct it,was aimed at trying individuals accused of murder by stealth. The term‘assassin’ (sicarius) covered not only ‘murderer’ but especially murdererswho accomplished their killing through concealment and planning.55Theterm ‘poisoner’ (veneficus), as we have mentioned, referred generally toone who used ‘poison’ (venenum) to murder, but the fundamental ambi-guity of the term venenumleft open to question whether such drugs weresimply poisons or magical substances. As in the examples from Greek lawthat we have seen dealing with pharmaka, the definition of venenumwasopen to interpretation depending on the circumstances. But if the mostrecent construction of the Lex Corneliais correct, intent to kill withvenena, as well as the nature of the venenathemselves, were part of thelaw’s original scope.56Already in the fourth centurybce, centuries before the passage of theCornelian law, a spectacular and memorable case for poisoning had beenheld that hinged on the correct interpretation of venenum. According toLivy (59bce–17ce), the first case for poisoning was tried in 331bce, andit involved a conspiracy by noble Roman matrons to murder their husbands.57That year, numerous prominent noblemen found themselvessuffering from an unknown malady. A maidservant, promised immunityby the Senate, revealed the identity of the conspiring matrons, who werediscovered at their homes in the act of manufacturing venena. Twentymatrons were allegedly involved and two of them, Cornelia and Sergia, con-tended that they were making medicamenta‘medicaments’ or beneficialdrugs, not poisons. The maidservant then challenged the matrons todrink their ‘medicaments’ to prove her suspicions wrong. After somedeliberation, all twenty matrons consented to drink the drugs, and all twentydied. Livy reports that in all some 170 matrons were found guilty of poisoning – a number that almost defies belief – and the whole event washailed as a prodigy.58As this case illustrates, it was crucial to determinewhether the drugs at issue were beneficial or harmful, and we can still seethis concern echoed in the comments of the second-centurycejurist Gaius9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 146"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Magic in Greek and Roman Law147(quoted earlier), whose distinction between medicamentaand harmful drugsneatly parallels the case of the Roman matrons.59Thus the logic of pair-ing the poisoner together with the assassin in the Cornelian law was clearenough: in both cases the means by which someone was murdered wasclandestine or in any case not obvious, and the threat of such crimes tothe state in 81bcewas serious enough for Sulla to warrant expanding thereach of the permanent court.There are many more cases involving poisoning attested in Roman history after 81bce, which give a reasonably, although not exactly, clearpicture of how the Cornelian law was broadened over time to incorporatemagical activity. It is important to remember, however, that Roman lawwas regularly subject to revision and expansion as new trials occurred, asearlier laws were modified by later statutes, and ultimately as jurists, bothpagan and Christian, weighed in to update and elucidate a given statute’smeaning.60Nevertheless, what we witness in the subsequent revisions tothe Cornelian law and to cases prosecuted under it is an attempt byRoman authorities to rein in behaviors that threatened the tranquility of the state. The devil was in the details, however, and what Romanauthorities considered to be threats to that tranquility were increasinglydefined in terms of a normative notion of religious behavior (religio). Theconcept of religio(not quite translatable as our modern term ‘religion’)referred to the proper, state-sanctioned honors traditionally paid to thegods.61In contrast, what the Romans referred to as superstitio(not quitetranslatable as ‘superstition’) was conceptually opposed to religio, and meantexcessive or otherwise improper honors and rituals paid to the gods.62Ofcourse the definition of what constituted superstitiowas flawed from thebeginning, since it was a term routinely used by those who considered them-selves religiosi– or the properly observant – to slander others. Now hereis the crux: among the various so-called deviant behaviors covered by theterm superstitio, especially after the first centuryce, magical activityemerged at the forefront. To Romans of the first centuryce, magic wasthe “ultimate superstitio.”63The reasons for this shift in perspective are complex, but they certainlyreceived support from the infamous and very public death in 19ceofGermanicus, adoptive nephew of his uncle, the emperor Tiberius(emperor 14 –37ce). As Tiberius had been adopted by Augustus (emperor31bce–14ce), Germanicus was in a direct line of succession to the throneand had been favored by some to supplant Augustus at his death in 14ce.In 17ce, Tiberius appointed Cn. Calpurnius Piso, with whom he hadserved as consul in 7bce, as governor of Syria, in part as a check onGermanicus, who had been given command of the eastern provinces. In19ceGermanicus entered the imperial province of Egypt without permission9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 147"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"148Magic in Greek and Roman Law– a law that Augustus himself had imposed on senators to protect the vitalsupply of grain to Rome – and offended Tiberius. On his return to Syria,Germanicus found that Piso had tried to thwart some of his arrange-ments, and so ordered him to leave the province. No sooner had Piso leftSyria than Germanicus fell ill, and he maintained to his death that Pisohad poisoned him. The horror of Germanicus’ death, however, was augmented by what was found in his room. As the Roman historianTacitus (56 –ca. 118ce) explains:64In the floor and walls were brought to light remains of human bodies, spells (carmina), curses (devotiones), lead tablets engraved with the name‘Germanicus’, half-burnt ashes smeared with blood, and other magic(malefica) by which it is believed that living souls are dedicated to the infernal powers.The human remains and ashes had no doubt been taken from funeral pyres,while the spells, curses, and lead tablets all point toward binding magicof the kind we examined in chapter 3.65Indeed, the Latin term devotiocanmean the same thing as Greek katadesmos‘binding curse’.66It is almostcertainly the case that Germanicus was poisoned, as the accusers of Pisomaintained later at his trial in Rome before the Senate, but it appears thatPiso was plausibly able to deny the charge of poisoning (veneni crimen).67We see from Tacitus’ account, however, that even if poisoning was the effec-tive means from our point of view of killing Germanicus, it was neverthe-less coupled in a dramatic way with magic. We have, therefore, a very clearassociation in this case between magic and drugs, making it plausible thatby 19cemagic could be prosecuted under the Cornelian law since it prohibited the use of venena‘poisons/magical substances’.68But to theRoman imagination, no matter how you translated it, the venenumwas adangerous thing, especially when shrouded in magic. As Pliny once saidgenerally of Roman attitudes toward magic, ‘there is no one who does notfear being bound (defigere) by frightful imprecations’.69Thus the dual fateof Germanicus. In spite of Piso’s having refuted the charge of poisoning,the senatorial and popular opposition to him was too great, nor wasTiberius sympathetic to his plight, and shortly thereafter Piso ended hislife by suicide.Magiaand Maleficium:Magic and WitchcraftWhen Tacitus describes the other magic (malefica) found in Germanicus’room, he introduces an explicitly Roman concept that will over the next9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 148"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Magic in Greek and Roman Law149century add to the coloring of magic as criminal behavior. The termmagus, borrowed in Latin from the Greek magos, had been in use sincethe 50sbceand retained its primarily neutral reference to Persian magidown to the first centuryce. However, as we saw in chapter 2, both magusand its associated complex of terms, including magia, magicus/a, and soforth, also bore the weight of meaning ‘magic’, ‘magical’, in terms moreclosely associated with the abominable devices found in Germanicus’room. By the second centuryce, alongside magusand the ever-ambivalent veneficus‘poisoner/magician’, we find another family ofterms built around the native Roman concept of maleficium, which originally meant ‘evil deed/crime’. Maleficiumis a noun built from male‘evilly/wrongly’ and facere‘to do’, and the perpetrator of maleficiumis a maleficus/a‘evil-doer/criminal’.In describing the other things found with the dead Germanicus, Tacitususes the plural adjective malefica– uniquely, it might be said, in his writ-ings – in a manner that soon became commonplace to characterize magicand its practitioners. Less than half a century after Tacitus’ death,maleficiumwas used as commonly as magiaand veneficiato mean‘magic’, except that now it carried the taint of intentional harm; the nounmalefica(note the feminine form) was explicitly a ‘sorceress’ or ‘witch’,70and by the third centurycethe maleficus‘magician’ begins to supplantthe magusin the most important Roman law codes.71As medieval and earlymodern authors returned to Roman literary, historical, and legal sourcesto define their own concepts of magic and its increasingly distinct coun-terpart, witchcraft, it was to maleficiumand its cognates that they primarilylooked. Maleficiumbecame the dominant term for medieval ‘witchcraft’and maleficus/a(pl. malefici/ae) the term of choice for ‘witch’.By the seventh centuryce, authors such as Isidore of Seville (560 – 636,bishop 600 – 636ce), who like Pliny the Elder before him wrote on the history of the magi, and following Augustine72understood magic to operate through the intercession of demons, explained that in his day themagi were:73usually called maleficibecause of the greatness of their crimes. They throwthe elements into commotion, disturb men’s minds, and without any drinkof poison (venenum) they kill merely by the violence of a charm (carmen).Note that to Isidore, the more important crime is now incantatory magic,exclusive of poisoning, which diverges from what we have seen in the com-ments of the second-centurycejurist Gaius. Next Isidore quotes Lucan’s(39 – 65ce) poem Pharsalia(6.457) to the same effect, from its famous necro-mantic scene.74He then writes that the malefici:9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 149"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"150Magic in Greek and Roman Lawsummon demons, and dare to brandish such juggleries that each one killshis enemies by means of evil arts (malae artes). They also use blood and victims, and often touch the bodies of the dead.In terms of a Christian theological explanation for magic, now commonlyreferred to as ‘magic arts’ (magicae artes) or ‘evil arts’ (malae artes), Isidoreis naturally quite removed from the explanations current in pagan Rome.But it is not hard to see how an author such as Isidore easily found therudiments of magic and the outlines of magicians (malefici) – the pre-cursors to medieval witches – readily available in Roman literature and his-tory. By the fifteenth century, maleficawas enshrined as the preeminenttheological and legal term for ‘witch’, as evidenced in the publication bythe Dominicans Heinrich Krämer (Institoris) and Jakob Sprenger of the mostimportant witch-hunting manual of the age, the Malleus Maleficarum‘Witches’ Hammer’ in 1486.A detailed history of the Christian theological development of magic intowitchcraft is beyond the scope of this study.75Yet, as we have brieflysketched, much of the groundwork had been laid for this transformationbetween the first and fourth centuriesce. Two important developmentsin this period of late antiquity have yet to be highlighted, and each in itsown way confirmed to medieval and early modern authors that magic wasa legitimate source of concern for the state. The first development con-cerned the most famous trial for magic in the second centuryceinvolv-ing Apuleius of Madaura. Not only was this case notorious in its own day,but the evidentiary basis for Apuleius’ prosecution, and its implicitconfirmation of the existence of magic, was still being discussed amongeducated magistrates preoccupied with witchcraft well into the sixteenthcentury. The second development was more extended than a single case,and it concerned the third-centuryceRoman jurists, especially Paulus,whose commentary and updating of the Cornelian law fortified the legalframework for the prosecution of magic in a manner that lasted for centuries, long after the fall of the Roman Empire.Apuleius the MagusApuleius of Madaura (which is in modern Algeria) was a flamboyantfigure, educated, handsome, and eloquent, with many accomplishmentsto his name: Platonist philosopher, orator, poet, naturalist, and – most troubling – magus.76His trial is only known to us from his Apology, which is almost certainly a revised version of the defense speech he gavebefore the proconsul of Africa, Claudius Maximus, in 158/9ce.77The 9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 150"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Magic in Greek and Roman Law151trial itself took place at the law court in Sabratha, situated about 45 miles west of Oea, which is modern Tripoli, the capital of Libya. The basis for the charges against Apuleius stems from a journey he made to Alexandria, cut short by illness, as a result of which he made a visit to Oea. In Oea Apuleius stayed with an old friend, Sicinius Pontianus, who helped him recover and whose mother was the wealthy widow,Aemilia Pudentilla. After recovering from his illness, and initially with theencouragement of Pontianus, Apuleius married the widow Pudentilla inorder to protect her inheritance for Pontianus, her eldest son, and heryounger one, Sicinius Pudens. The marriage caused tensions amongPudentilla’s relatives, however, especially Sicinius Aemilianus, the brotherof Pudentilla’s first husband, and Herennius Rufinus, who was father-in-law to Pontianus.The details of the family members and their previous legal maneuver-ings are more complex than I have indicated, but the key point is thatAemilianus and Rufinus claimed at trial that Pudentilla had vowed neverto remarry – indeed, she had remained single for almost 14 years. More-over, at approximately 40 Pudentilla was roughly a decade older thanApuleius at the time, which defied the expectation of Aemilianus that she would marry a man her senior. Thus Aemilianus and his croniescharged Apuleius with being a maguswho had used erotic magic to winher affections and, as an opening gambit, they produced a letter to provethe point. Pudentilla had written a letter in Greek in which she claimedthat ‘Apuleius is a magos, and I am bewitched by him and in love’.78In response to this and other charges, Apuleius’ defense speech is masterful and triumphant – the hallmarks of a man who was ultimatelyacquitted.79His oratorical skills are on dazzling display as he cleverlyreverses the arguments of his accusers, challenges their interpretation offacts, mocks their inability to supply witnesses, and generally satirizes theirignorance and ill intentions. Every charge against him he explains away,but it is how he does this that raised the eyebrows of later authors. Ratherthan deny the charges against him, Apuleius instead admits the chargesas if they were facts and then offers a non-magical explanation for them.80As he proceeds, however, addressing his accusers charge by charge, itbecomes clear that Apuleius knows a great deal about magic – so much,in fact, that to a modern reader the conclusion is virtually inescapable thathe was capable of practicing it. The question before his audience at trialwas whether he used erotic magic to woo Pudentilla, and obviously thiswas not proven. But his Apologyleaves the distinct impression thatburied beneath the clever rhetoric and skillful lawyering, we are dealingwith a man whose innocence lay more in the strength of his argumentsthan in the moral clarity of his deeds.9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 151"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"152Magic in Greek and Roman LawThe main charge against Apuleius was a charge of magic (crimenmagiae),81but because of Aemilianus’ efforts prior to the trial to discredithim, the grounds for the charge as Apuleius says several times are largelybased on the calumny or slander that he practiced magic (calumniamagiae).82Not only has Aemilianus charged that Apuleius practicedmagic, he has also characterized that magic as explicitly maleficent. This is brought out in a reading before the court of the document containing the formal charge toward the end of the work, in which the term maleficia(pl. for maleficium) ‘wicked deeds’ is used.83It is alsobrought out in another phrase Apuleius frequently employs to name the charge against him, magica maleficia‘maleficent magic’.84Thisphrase is significant because for the first time in Roman literaturemaleficiaand its cognates, used in an expressly magical sense, arestrongly identified with magus/magiaand their cognates both here and in other writings of Apuleius.85For all intents and purposes, the long history of maleficiumas ‘maleficent magic’ and, later, ‘witchcraft’ beginswith Apuleius.Most commentators agree that Apuleius was charged under the Cornelianlaw on assassins and poisoners, and in a clever allusion Apuleius himselfrefers to the law. In rebutting the claim that he is a maleficent magus,Apuleius argues that magi were originally Persian holy men, descendantsof Zoroaster and Oromazes,86whom one should be inclined to emulate.If, on the other hand, his accusers claim that he is a common maguswhohas the power to communicate directly with the gods to achieve whateverhe wants, then why, he asks, have his accusers entered court without defend-ing themselves? Shouldn’t they be afraid?87His allusion to the Cornelianlaw comes when he adds that anyone summoning an assassin (sicarius)would have come with an escort, while anyone accusing a poisoner(venenarius– like veneficusthis form is also built from venenum) woulddine with more scrupulous care – both types being unlike his accusers whohave taken no pains to protect themselves.88It might seem an excessivelybold gesture for Apuleius ironically to apply to his accusers the very termsof the statute under which he is being prosecuted, but he can do this becausehe has not actually been charged with ‘poisoning’ veneficium. In more thanone place Apuleius states clearly that he has not been indicted forveneficium,89which reveals that by this time cases like his that involvedmagic not explicitly tied to the use of drugs could also be prosecuted underthe Cornelian law.90In addition to Apuleius’ rhetorical skill, this last example affords us aglimpse of one of his favorite tactics. As we have noted, on the one handRoman authors as early as the 50sbcedown to the first centurycecon-tinuously used the term magusto refer to Persian magi, for whom they9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 152"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Magic in Greek and Roman Law153reserved respect just as the Greeks had before them. On the other hand,the self-serving man who styled himself as a magusand preyed on the super-stitious had been regarded by many civilly minded Greeks and Romansas contemptible. Apuleius does not deny that he is a magus; instead, he highlights the positive and most traditional interpretation of the term.Then he says that the same kind of invidious claims made against vulgarmagi were also commonly made against philosophers – among whom, of course, he numbers himself – men who were not, contrary to popularopinion, irreligious.91Here Apuleius uses a key term in Latin: thesephilosophers were not irreligiosi– which means they were religiosi, the termfor those who were properly observant of the traditional gods and cultsand the diametrical opposite of magical practitioners, or the superstitiosi.Apuleius allies himself with these earlier philosophers, among whom henames traditional philosophers – including Anaxagoras and Democritus– along with several other legendary men – including Epimenides ofCrete, Orpheus, Pythagoras, Empedocles – who were strongly associatedwith magic but remained above moral reproach. Among them he adds,curiously, Ostanes, who was a notorious magician,92and Socrates and Plato,names that were so distinguished in philosophy that either Apuleiushoped they would extinguish all doubt about the character of the precedingfigures or introduce a red herring that would lead his listeners astray. All of these were men who inquired into nature with greater care and honored the gods more intensely, Apuleius says, but who were wronglycalled ‘magicians’ magiby the people.93As we learn through Apuleius’ defense speech, his accuser Aemilianushad based his charges of maleficiaon several instances of questionablebehavior. They included Apuleius’ attempt to purchase certain kinds offish; his enchantment of a slave boy who collapsed and then recovered;his keeping of certain secret objects wrapped in linen and kept among thehousehold gods of his friend, Pontianus; his performance of nocturnalsacrifices; his commissioning and veneration of a wooden figurine; andhis marriage to Pudentilla accomplished through incantations (carmina)and magical drugs (venena). For each of these charges Apuleius providesa non-magical explanation, which turns instead on his interest in philo-sophy, natural investigation, or pious religious observance. Moreover, allof the charges can be seen as concocted in the face of Aemilianus’ andRufinus’ true motives, which were according to Apuleius to lay claimthrough their children to Pudentilla’s dowry.An examination of the charges against Apuleius will show how eachinstance admitted of more than one explanation, even against the back-drop of Aemilianus’ and Rufinus’ questionable motives. Among the rarefish Apuleius was supposedly seeking was the lepus marinus‘sea-hare’,9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 153"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"154Magic in Greek and Roman Lawwhich was actually not a fish but a poisonous mollusk.94In typical fashion Apuleius readily admits to having his slave (Themison) seek toacquire this mollusk as well as rare fish in an effort, as he claims, to further his naturalistic investigations as Aristotle and Theophrastus haddone before him.95However, the lepus marinuswas well known to Plinythe Elder from Italian and Indian waters as poisonous to the touch, anddoing so immediately caused vomiting and disorders of the stomach.96Plinyadds elsewhere that the lepus marinusused as a ‘poison’ venenumcan beserved in food or drink, and a man who has died from this poison reeksof the mollusk’s smell, which gives observers the first hint that his deathwas caused by veneficium. At the very sight of the mollusk, pregnantwomen are seized with nausea and vomiting and their pregnanciesinevitably end in abortion.97Thus whatever Apuleius’ actual motives in seek-ing to acquire this mollusk, it is doubtful that he could have claimed igno-rance of the mollusk’s well-known pharmacological properties. Indeed,Apuleius never addresses these properties directly; instead, his defenseswitches gears and focuses on two other fish he supposedly sought whosenames carried sexually suggestive meanings. He dismisses out of hand hisaccusers’ claim that he sought these fish, based on their names alone, touse as erotic magic – and yet contemporary uses of fish and other sea crea-tures in Roman magic, including erotic magic, were well known.98The enchanted slave boy who collapsed in Apuleius’ presence, sup-posedly after Apuleius had recited a charm, is explained away with a perversely generous amount of magical detail. To the claim that Apuleiusenchanted the boy, he asserts that his accusers should have added the chargethat he also used him for divination.99He further acknowledges the depthof his reading in magic and divination by citing several examples of thevery common practice in late antiquity of using children as mediums.100Typically a suitable child, usually a young boy, was blindfolded while a divinity was invoked, then the blindfold was removed and the boy gazedeither into a lamp’s flame or a bowl of water, which was sometimesinfused with oil. The divinity then appeared in the flame or on the surface of the liquid and reported the prophecy.101More remarkable thanApuleius’ knowledge of this procedure, however, is that his explanationfor why the boy (named Thallus) collapsed was that he was an epileptic –more in need of a doctor than a magus, quips Apuleius.102But to readersfamiliar with Greek magical tradition this point should raise more ques-tions than it answers. For as we have seen in the Hippocratic treatise On the Sacred Disease, epileptics in particular were the favored patientsof itinerant religious specialists, including magoi. We then learn thatApuleius was sought out by others on behalf of epileptics – later in thedefense we hear that a freeborn epileptic woman had also been brought9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 154"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Magic in Greek and Roman Law155to him for help and that she too collapsed.103He claims that his know-ledge of epilepsy was again derived from reading the philosophers –Plato, Aristotle, and Theophrastus, in particular – although he acknow-ledges having read the medical writers and poets on the subject too.104Mostsuspicious of all, however, in my view is that Apuleius says that the freeborn woman was brought to him for treatment by her physician(medicus).105Now however learned a philosopher Apuleius might have been,he was decidedly not a physician. Furthermore, the rivalry between academic physicians and magoiruns back at least to the late fifth and earlyfourth centuriesbce, as we saw in chapter 2, and is attested memorablyin On the Sacred Disease. Roman-era physicians, such as Soranus, Galen,Rufus, and Marcellus, certainly had knowledge of magic and occasionallyoffered it as a remedy for a given illness (as we saw in chapter 4). But oneconceivable reason why a physician would have brought an epilepticpatient to Apuleius was that the physician had exhausted all of the tradi-tional medical options at his disposal. We may note here the common saying in antiquity that when the remedies of the physicians fail, every-one resorts to sacrificers and seers, incantations and amulets106– with the unexpected twist that here we have the physician himself appealingto Apuleius’ unconventional services. Whether the epileptic woman wasthought to suffer from demonic possession, which was a phenomenon wellknown to Apuleius and his contemporaries,107is plausible, and it fits withthe prevailing popular understanding of epilepsy as a divine or demonicinvasion.108Nevertheless, it is hard to escape the conclusion that it wasfor Apuleius’ magical, and not his medical, services that he wasapproached, even if his accusers mistakenly connected incantations with the epileptics’ collapse.The charges of possessing objects wrapped in linen are also dismissedby Apuleius in less than transparent terms. Aemilianus claimed thatApuleius kept some unknown objects, wrapped in linen, with the laresorhousehold gods of his friend, Pontianus. On the grounds that he had not seen them, Aemilianus unfortunately asserted that the objects weremagical.109He thus leaves himself wide open to attack by Apuleius as aresult, because Apuleius had left the wrapped objects in plain view inPontianus’ home, and yet no one had bothered to unwrap them. When itcomes to explaining what the objects were, however, they appear to havebeen votives. In a famous passage, Apuleius explains that he has been initiated into many mystery cults in Greece, and had been given many souvenirs and symbols by various priests.110He then alludes to initiates ofthe cult of Dionysus present in his audience, who within the privacy oftheir homes silently venerate objects, performing a ritual obeisancewhich they are bound by the strictures of the mystery cult not to reveal.9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 155"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"156Magic in Greek and Roman LawHe is no different than them in their worship, and he adds importantlythat out of his ardor for truth and duty to the gods he has learned manycults, rites, and ceremonies – actions evocative of religioand nothing more.111But then, in one of the most interesting passages of the Apology,because its implications reverberate for his accusers, audience, andjudge, as well as for modern readers, Apuleius directly and consciouslyembroils the proper observance of religiowith magic. The issue is whatmay seem to others as magical:112Thus, in a case of magic, anything at all that people have done can be heldagainst them. You have attached a written vow (votum) to the thigh of a statue:so you are a magician (magus), or else why did you do so? You have madea silent prayer in a temple to the gods: so you are a magician, or else whatdid you ask for? Or, conversely, you have notmade a prayer in a temple: so you are a magician, or else why did you notask the gods? The same could be said if you have deposited a gift, made a sacrifice, or taken homea sacred branch.In the same way, he concludes, objects sealed or stored someplace orwrapped inside the house could be called ‘magical’ and be transferred fromthe storeroom to the forum and into the courtroom. The balance that hasto be struck here is no less than monumental, and it speaks to the rangeof practices with which every Roman was intimately familiar. To be moreprecise, it is not just a matter of one person’s magic or superstition beinganother person’s religion, but rather that the ritual practices which theyshare are inherently ambiguous. This is a point on which I have insistedthroughout this book, insofar as, terminology aside, we have concen-trated on understanding how ‘magical’ practices have to be situatedwithin a larger ritual and cultural context. Apuleius’ strategy is to call atten-tion to the underlying normative judgment of what is acceptable in therealm of religioas the deciding factor in what is therefore judged unac-ceptable, superstitious, and magical. To anything that is contrived by his accusers as magical, Apuleius adds that he will counter that it is eitherfraudulent, serves as a remedy (remedium), fulfills a religious purpose, or that it has been commanded in a dream.113Common practice and themost widespread custom will be his benchmark. But in all this there is morethan a little prevarication, because in the end Apuleius chooses to insistthat his objects have sacred meanings derived from the mystery cults inwhich he has participated – meanings which he is therefore religiouslyboundto keep secret.As to the performance of nocturnal sacrifices, the written testimony wasoffered by a landlord, Julius Crassus, who alleged that Apuleius and hisfriend Quintianus had repeatedly celebrated the sacrifices in Crassus’9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 156"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Magic in Greek and Roman Law157home, where Quintianus rented a room. At the time, Crassus himself was in Alexandria, but when he returned home to Oea he found bird feathers in the hall and the walls defaced by soot. His slave informed him that Apuleius and Quintianus were responsible.114Nocturnalsacrifices made for private rather than public purposes, especially in thecontext of mysteries, had been a source of concern for Roman legislatorssince the Republic and they remained subject to imperial prohibition well into the fourth centuryce.115Generally the concern was that suchsacrifices contributed to superstitio, not religio, with implications for the maintenance of order in the body politic, and thus the state had aninterest in maintaining its monopoly over public sacrifice. Apuleius’defense in this instance is aided by the fact that Crassus was a known tippler, who notoriously accepted small fees from clients to lie on theirbehalf, and thus his argument is an attack on Crassus’ character, as well as on Aemilianus who suborned him. As in the case of some of theother charges, the details about what really happened are hazy, nor do weknow exactly which type of bird feathers were found.116Nonetheless,Apuleius’ defense once again puzzlingly rests on the shortcomings of his accusers, not on a clear explanation of why soot and feathers were found in Crassus’ house.We turn finally to Apuleius’ wooden figurine, which he commissionedto have carved by a known artisan, Cornelius Saturninus. Apparently indirect answer to questions about the figurine posed by the judge, Maximus,Apuleius testifies that he asked Saturninus to carve a figurine of any godhe wanted, from any material he wanted provided it was wood, to whichApuleius would address his regular prayers.117It is important to stress atthe outset that Apuleius couches this whole request in the context of hiscustomary (ex more meo) – and therefore religiosus– prayers, to which no one should attach any suspicion. We learn that Saturninus first triedto carve the figurine from boxwood, but meanwhile, Apuleius’ stepsonPontianus, desiring to have the figurine made for him, acquired some ebony– a wood known for its durability – from an unknown lady, and askedSaturninus to use that instead. The god Saturninus supposedly chose tomake was Mercury (Hermes).118Further claims made against Apuleius in the episode include secretly having the figurine made, which of course he denies since Saturninus was known and summoned to court; requesting a special wood, which heattributes to Pontianus; and thirdly that the figurine resembles a frightfulcorpse or skeleton, which he disproves by presenting the little Mercury tothe judge Maximus for his inspection. But we must be cautious here forseveral reasons. First, it is not at all clear that the Mercury presented toMaximus is the same figurine in question.119But even if it is a substitute,9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 157"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"158Magic in Greek and Roman Lawwe have seen in chapter 3 the extensive role Mercury (Hermes) plays inGreek magic, and not only as an underworld figure who can be addressedin curse tablets and binding spells. More significantly the Greek magicalpapyri prescribe erotic binding spells addressed to Hermes, as well as recipesfor fashioning figurines of Hermes from beeswax or dough to be used asmagical aides in business or in divination, as we saw in chapter 3.120Thecorrespondences between these magical recipes and Apuleius’ figurine aretoo close to be accidental.121It is probable that Apuleius revealed thesedetails knowing that his audience would fail to grasp their magicalsignificance. The first and most significant detail is that in an erotic bind-ing spell in PGMaddressed to Hermes, it is said that Hermes’ preferredwood is ebony,122the very wood which Apuleius claims his stepsonPontianus sought for the artisan to make the figurine. The next is that theMercury figurine presented to Maximus wears a mantle,123which corre-sponds to the description in PGMfor fashioning a prophetic Hermesfigurine, which must also wear a mantle.124More interesting is thatApuleius says he usually carries his Mercury with him wherever he travels, and that on feast days he offers incense, wine, and occasionallyan animal victim, to the figurine.125The audience is to infer from Apuleiusthat these offerings and especially the sacrifice are made publicly, lest his actions attract the taint of superstitio, but this is never clearly stated.In PGMwe find a Hermes spell for increasing business – since Hermes governs all commercial transactions – which requires that after a beeswaxfigurine of the god is fashioned, a cock is to be sacrificed to him, a drinkoffering made of Egyptian wine is to be poured, and a lamp that is notcolored red is to be burned.126These details are strikingly close to thosegiven by Apuleius and make it virtually certain that his Mercury figurinewas used in magical rites. Moreover, to seal the Hermetic link betweenApuleius’ figurine and the Greek magical papyri, Apuleius allegedlyaddressed his figurine as basileus‘king’, which recalls a demonic figureby the same name that appears in several magical spells.127There is no need to insist on the general point that figurines were venerated by Romans, as they had been by the Greeks before them – some-times in the context of pious observance, as with their household gods (lares,penates), and sometimes in notoriously magical contexts, as when theemperor Nero toward the end of his life acquired the figurine of a girl, whichhe venerated and to which he made sacrifices in the belief that it coulddivine the future for him.128The main issue, as Apuleius would have hisaudience believe, was that his treatment of the Mercury figurine, along withall of his other activities, was conducted in the context of proper, and evenbanally normal, religious observance. However, the evidence as I have presented it weighs heavily against this interpretation, and renders all 9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 158"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Magic in Greek and Roman Law159the more rational the judgment of later authors that Apuleius was,indeed, a skillful and capable magus.Among the most important of these later authors was Augustine, whoaccepted that Apuleius practiced ‘magic arts’ (magicae artes) and showed‘no desire to be innocent except by denying actions that cannot be performed by an innocent man’.129Consistent with his own theory ofmagical operation, to Augustine Apuleius could only have accomplishedhis magic through demons.130In the Apology, Apuleius himself argues forthe existence of daemones(Greek daimones), as Plato had before him,131as intermediary divine powers situated between gods and men that govern divination and the miracles of magicians.132But the Greek daimDnand Augustine’s Christian demon with its theological implications for thespread of evil are two distinct entities, and can only be superficially com-pared.133Nevertheless, Augustine devotes a chapter to refuting what he callsApuleius’ worship of demons (cultus daemonum), arguing instead thatdemons are bent on harm and that the less educated multitude has cultivated their worship out of a longstanding tradition of superstitio.134Moreover, we know that in Augustine’s lifetime Apuleius was still highlyregarded as a magician among pagans, and was often compared to the notorious magician and miracle-worker Apollonius of Tyana. The magicof both men was compared by pagan writers, to the horror of Augustine,to the miracles of Jesus.135Apuleius’ reputation both for magic and for hisstorytelling abilities only grows throughout the Middle Ages – two of hisstories, for example, are translated into Italian by Boccaccio (1313–75) inhis Decamerone– but it is not to his literary talent that I wish primarily to point. A detailed study of Apuleius’ treatment by medieval and early modern demonologists – men who may be broadly defined as canonlawyers, theologians, jurists, philosophers, physicians, and magistrateswho wrote about demons in the context of magic and witchcraft136– has not been written. Nor is such a task before us. But it is of more thanpassing interest that Augustine’s judgment of Apuleius as a fully fledgedmagician stands the test of time. As late as the sixteenth century, forexample, we find Apuleius still cited by authorities on witchcraft as prooffor the existence of magic in Roman antiquity.137The Opinionsof Paulus and Later Law CodesWe turn finally to a major example of how the scope of the Cornelian law on assassins and poisoners was extended by Roman jurists in the thirdcenturyceto incorporate a wider range of magical activity.138This shift in interpretation, which can be attributed to a multitude of factors9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 159"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"160Magic in Greek and Roman Lawincluding actual trials, senatorial decrees, imperial rescripts (viz. points oflegal clarification, relevant to ad hoc cases, that were officially issued bysitting emperors), and the updating and further elucidation of theCornelian law by lawyers and legal scholars, took time to develop and canalready be partially glimpsed in the trial of Apuleius in 158/9ce. But it wasin the formulation of the early third-centurycejurist Julius Paulus, in hisSententiaeor Opinions, or in works attributed to him, that the groundworkwas laid for all future prosecutions for magic under Roman law. After citing the Cornelian law, Paulus adds an extensive set of further con-siderations, of which I quote only the most relevant:13914. Those who give abortifacients or love philtres, even if they do not act withmalice aforethought, nevertheless because it sets a bad example: humilioresare relegated to the mines, honestioresto an island with partial forfeiture of their property; but if as a result a woman or a man has died, they are punished with the supreme punishment. 15. Those who perform, or arrangefor the performance of, impious or nocturnal rites, in order to enchant(obcantare), magically bind (defigere), or restrain (obligare) someone, shallbe crucified or thrown to the beasts. 16. Those who sacrifice a man orobtain omens from his blood, or pollute a shrine or a temple, shall bethrown to the beasts, or, if honestiores, be capitally punished. 17. It is agreedthat those guilty of the magic art (magicae artis) be inflicted with thesupreme punishment, i.e. to be thrown to the beasts or crucified. Actual magicians (magi), however, shall be burned alive. 18. No one is permittedto have in their possession books of the magic art; and if anyone is found tohave them in their possession, the books shall be publicly burnt and theirproperty confiscated; honestioresshall be sent to an island; humiliorescapitally punished. Not only the profession of this art, but also its know-ledge (scientia) is prohibited. 19. If a man has died from a medicine(medicamen), which was given for health or as a remedy (remedium), the onewho gave it, if honestior, is relegated to an island; a humilior, however, ispunished capitally.By way of background, it is first important to note the Roman legal dis-tinction between honestiores, or persons of upper class, and humiliores,or persons of lower class. Although no legal definition of these terms hasbeen found, we can clearly see how marked the differences are in crimi-nal law with milder penalties for honestiores, often involving the partialconfiscation of property and relegation to islands, in comparison with thevariously brutal death penalties meted out to humiliores.Paulus brings several important strands of legal thinking together in thisopinion, beginning with the use of love philtres and abortifacients, twocommon venena.140Note here that intent is less at issue than the outcome,as in Greek law: if a person dies, the act is treated as a capital crime with9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 160"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Magic in Greek and Roman Law161the supreme penalty for both honestioresand humiliores, whereas if nodeath results milder sanctions differentiated by class apply. Intent is considered in section 19, on the other hand, when death results from theadministration of medicine. In contrast to abortifacients and philtres,here the law acknowledges the inherent utility of medicaminaand is thusin a case of death less punitive in its treatment of honestiores. In section15, nocturnal rites of the kind for which Apuleius was accused are nowexplicitly coupled with other classes of magic, including incantations andbinding magic. This means that by the third century, the array of bindingspells accomplished through the writing of lead tablets, papyri, and fashioning of figurines discussed in chapter 3 were all punishable bydeath. The matter of human sacrifice is somewhat harder to clarify, andprobably attached to the activities of numerous Jewish and Christiansects, upon which Roman emperors had for some time looked with suspicion.141The reason for the prohibition of divination through humanblood is also not entirely transparent, although such charges are notunknown. There is the case of the first-centuryceholy man and miracle-worker, Apollonius of Tyana, who was charged before the emperorDomitian (emp. 81–96ce) with sacrificing human beings – and notablyone Arcadian boy – for purposes of divination; however, the authenticityof this charge cannot be proven.142Roman authorities had fervently managed popular divination since thetime of Augustus, when he is said to have burned all Greek and Romanprophetic books that were not considered to contain genuine Sibylline oracles. The true Sibylline oracles were thenceforth preserved in state-controlled oracular books.143The Roman state protected its monopoly ondivination, and especially forbade any divination that predicted the deathof an emperor. There are many examples found in the law codes that attestan almost zealous concern with restricting divination (haruspicina), theactivities of prophets (hariolus), astrologers (mathematicus), and those ofthe caster of natal horoscopes (genethliacus).144By the third and fourth centuries, magic and divination had become more closely aligned and therestrictions placed on both activities were often grouped together underone rubric in the law codes.145We can observe this alignment even in Paulus,insofar as the same strict prohibition is applied to the possession of magical books, which like divinatory books are also to be burned.Of the punishments specifically directed toward magi– that they are to be burned alive like their books – we come to one of the most impor-tant capital sentences issued with respect to the legislative history ofmagic. In the second centuryce, we do find an obscure reference to burn-ing a pharmakisin the only surviving rhetorical exercise of Hadrian of Tyre, which accords in some respects with the sententiaeof Paulus given9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 161"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"162Magic in Greek and Roman Lawabove.146However, the exact legal context to which the speech refers is obscured by the fact that the hypothetical scenario – that of a womanwho was convicted of ‘magic’ (pharmakeia) but could not be burned, and another woman who undertook to burn her and succeeded, withHadrian justifying the burning – finds no parallels to my knowledge in anyother source. Still, the general emphasis of Hadrian’s speech on acquir-ing the tekhnBof pharmakeiaas implying ill intentions on the part of the acquirer seems to align with Paulus’ mention of scientiaof the arsmagicaabove.147Neverthless, because Hadrian’s exercise predates Paulus,our ability to identify the relevant legal precedent that would have formedthe context of his speech is hampered.Burning alive was not an uncommon punishment in itself, and, as wemight expect, we also find it levied against seers in later legislation, as inthe Theodosian Code,148which was published by the emperor TheodosiusII in 438ce, and in the Codeof Justinian,149which was promulgated in 529.The emperor Diocletian (emp. 284 –305), who proscribed the Manichaeansas a subversive foreign cult, also specified burning alive for the leaders ofthat sect, with lesser penalties for their followers.150It goes without sayingthat burning alive was reserved for individuals in the state who were per-ceived to be a serious threat to the maintenance of order, and who werebelieved, as we find in another imperial rescript issued by ConstantiusAugustus (d. 361) in 357, to disturb the course of nature and to ruin thelives of innocent people.151Interpretationes ChristianaeConstantius was the third son of Constantine I (‘The Great’, emp. 306 –37ce), by whom the official imperial religion of Rome was unified inChristianity in 325, at the council of Nicaea. Under the Christian em-perors, the demonic underpinnings of pagan magic and divination are given a more substantial base in the law codes, and in the fifth centurywe begin to find anonymous Christian interpretations attached to ear-lier, pagan Roman laws. Formally called an interpretatio‘explanation,signification’, each explanation usually adds operational detail to themagic or divination proscribed in a given law. As one example, consideran interpretatioin the Theodosian Codefound in section 3, in book 9, title 16, which bears the general rubric: On Magicians (maleficus) andAstrologers (mathematicus) and others suchlike. We begin with the law itself,in which can be found some of the same emphases in the opinion of Paulus,given above, as for instance the equally vehement focus on punishing the knowledge (scientia) of magic arts as well as the practice of them.

However, no criminal charges are to be attached to reme-dies (remedia) sought for human bodies, or for rural districts for fear of protecting the mature grape harvests from rainstorms or from violent hailstorms. By these remedies neither the safety nor the reputation of anyone is harmed, but their activities bring it about that neither divine gifts nor the labors of men are destroyed.This is a remarkable passage. On the one hand, a clear distinction is made between harmful and libidinous magic – the latter of which was acharge frequently directed toward any group, and notably toward non-Christian religious sects, whose activities took place in secret – and agrarian magic. Concern with protecting the grape harvest – since wineremained an important Roman commodity – can be found in manyRoman and medieval Greek agricultural handbooks, such as in the tenth-century Geoponicamentioned in chapter 4.153Similarly, as early as Cato‘The Censor’ (234 –149bce), we find in his treatise on agriculture themention of helpful incantations used to heal dislocations or fractures, presumably in farm animals.154On the other hand, such a distinction inmagic – which is not found in our Greek sources – does not last within thelaw codes, and this suggests that the Theodosian Codehere preserves anolder, Roman attitude toward traditions of agrarian magic that wereviewed as relatively harmless.In any case, this section of the law is immediately followed by an interpretatio:Interpretatio: Let magicians (malefici) or enchanters (incantatores) or instigators of storms, or those who through the invocation of demons (invocatio daemonum) disturb the minds of men, be punished with everykind of penalty.For the anonymous author of this interpretatio, the prevailing theory of how magic is accomplished could not be more at odds with what thelaw code itself says. A new operational dimension to magic has beenadded that depends on demons, which as we saw in Augustine representsthe most significant shift in the Christian effort to explain the efficacy ofpagan magic. More examples like this can be found: in later sections ofthe same rubric on magicians and astrologers, we find interpretationes9781405132381_4_005.qxd 30/10/2007 12:12 Page 163"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"164Magic in Greek and Roman Lawthat specify demons as either the agents for divination or as the honoreesof nocturnal sacrifices.155Although a detailed examination of this transi-tion as it is reflected in the law codes would extend beyond the scope ofthis study, these anonymous interpretationesgive us direct insight into howChristian authorities adapted a demonic worldview to pagan Roman law.They deserve further research, not only on the grounds of legal history,but especially with regard to the agency and perceived human abilities theseconstructions of demons exhibit.The Medieval InheritanceI want finally to turn to the key implication of Roman laws as they wereaccumulated and applied across the eastern and western parts of the formerly unified empire. By tradition Roman law was accretive, and earlier compilations were subsumed within later ones, often after due purging of inconsistencies and rectification of conflicting provisions.Some 90 years after the appearance of the Theodosian Code, the emperorJustinian (emp. 527– 65ce) ordered the preparation of a comprehensivecollection of all imperial laws, including those in the three major existingcodices, of which the Theodosian Codewas one,156as well as more recentlaws. Written in Latin, his Digestaor Digestwas issued in 529,157andrevised and reissued in 533, and its practical aim was to reduce the number of lawsuits and to be used in the famous law schools of Beirutand Constantinople. In the eastern, Byzantine empire less use was madeof the laws until a Greek version appeared between the ninth and tenthcenturies (called the Basilica). In the western part of the empire, however,Justinian’s laws held force for two centuries, in parts of both Italy and NorthAfrica. After the expansion of Islam in the seventh century, the Digestwas lost for a time until it was rediscovered in the eleventh century. Fromthen, the Digest, now more broadly known as the Corpus Juris Civilis(Corpus of Civil Law), was gradually accepted, subject to local variations,as the basis of legal education, and criminal and civil jurisprudencethroughout Europe, with the exception of Britain where a different tra-dition of common and statutory law prevailed. In the later Middle Ages,within the Catholic church the Corpusgreatly influenced the developmentof canon law, which unlike criminal and civil law dealt primarily with eccle-siastical rules for the regulation of faith, morals, and discipline.The implications for magic were profound. In a history that has beentreated by many authors, magic remained a source of, at times, intenseconcern for both religious and civil institutions throughout the Middle Ages and the early modern period.

I have beenreading and thinking about magic the better part of twenty years, and inthat time I have yet to find an absolutely airtight explanation for any givenmagical object or practice. Instead, as more attention is paid to the ritualcontext, cultural and historical background, and the interpretive possibil-ities for understanding a magical object or action, it seems that a grasp ofits essential qualities recedes. A more modest concluding statement is thusin order: what I hope to have shown in this book is that by asking ques-tions not only about what Greek magic is, but in particular about how magicdoes whatever it does and who is affected by it, we may gain some insightinto what its practitioners thought it was. After all, magic remains peren-nially interesting to scholars and lay persons alike not because theybelieve it to be true, but precisely because they fail to understand how others could believe it to be true. And this very attitude characterizes indifferent ways the attacks on magic by the Hippocratic author of On theSacred Diseaseand Plato. If my interpretations of Greek magic have at allbeen persuasive, however, I hope to have offered several alternativeapproaches to this issue. For a historian of magic, it is less important whe-ther magic is true or real than which cultural constructs allow it to exist.Only within that framework can we approach an understanding of whatmagic looks like and how people interact with it in a given culture, at a particulartime and place.We paid a good deal of attention in chapter 1 to general cultural constructs that bear on magical practices and magical thinking. These con-structs, drawn for the most part from disparate cultures, help us to see how key notions of sympathy, analogy, agency, and participation inform9781405132381_4_006.qxd 30/10/2007 12:13 Page 166"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Conclusion167how an outsider ought to approach magical practice in any culture, not justin an ancient one. The task then becomes to identify, in the present case,which specifically Greek constructs of sympathy, agency, and so forth areat issue in a given magical practice. These are generalizable constructs thatcan be applied to any culture’s magical practices. With the particularexample of the Azande offered by Evans-Pritchard, I hope to have shownthat as outsiders to a magical tradition more often than not we ask ques-tions about causality and efficacy, which from a native point of view arefor the most part irrelevant to their practices and concerns. Instead, it isthe key notions outlined above that invite one, as close as the evidencewill allow, “inside” the heads of magical practitioners. And it is notewor-thy to recall that even when Evans-Pritchard directly asked his infor-mants about their rationale for a given practice or belief, they wereunable to articulate it much beyond the Zande constructs which healready knew to be active.Understanding specific Greek constructs then becomes crucial, as it wouldfor any given cultural and historical context, and the example of Homericincantations is a case in point. Homer was arguably the most significantarchaic Greek poet from the point of view of both Greeks and Romans,but this in itself does not explain why his verses were used as incantations.Vergil was equally significant to imperial Romans, yet his verses tend onlyto have been used for divination. To offer an explanation for this differ-ence, as we have seen, we need to situate Homer in a late antique, Greco-Egyptian context, in which both the rhythm of the hexameter and key termswithin individual verses were believed to have therapeutic properties. Butas to why Homer and not other epic poets were the preferred source ofincantations, we need also to grasp how Neoplatonist authors elaboratedon the sympathetic connections between his verses and the divinity theysought to reach through them.Other examples are the binding and animation of figurines, which I seeas flowing from the set of ritual attitudes generally toward statuary sharedby both Greeks and Romans. Not that they are exactly alike, but it is suchritual interactions that regard statues as social agents – as humans, or atleast as partaking of human qualities – which inform the magical use offigurines. I do not claim to have exhausted the interpretive possibilities ofbinding figurines, and while some readers will take issue with my claimthat binding them is to anger them which in turn motivates retributive actionon their part, I am nevertheless certain that magical figurines inhabitedthe same moral universe as statues and inanimate objects generally.Hence we should be able to translate some of the moral attributes fromone realm of activity to the other, and vice versa, because it is culturallyconsistent to do so. In the same way, the rites for animating erDtescan 9781405132381_4_006.qxd 30/10/2007 12:13 Page 167"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"168Conclusionbe better understood as transferring the affection of a lover to the figurines,which in turn transfers that affection to the beloved, because the figurinesthemselves are social agents. The lavish gifts, flowers, fruit, and wingedofferings are needed not only because they invoke analogies with Eros, butalso because erDtesare in effect young boys who need to be persuaded to do one’s bidding. Like children, they have a mind of their own.Conceptions of Greek magic in its main forms and language used todescribe it were developed in the fifth and fourth centuries bce, especiallyin the hostile writings of the Hippocratic author of On the Sacred Diseaseand Plato. We have seen how the Hippocratic author, as well as other writers interested in magic before him, such as Gorgias, strongly imbuesmagic with a purificatory strain. The issue of correct purification, with anacceptable theology, seems to have lain at the heart of the disputebetween the Hippocratic author and the itinerant specialists with whomhe likely competed for business. However, I do believe the Hippocraticauthor’s arguments are misplaced to the extent that he fails to recognizethat epilepsy, his main subject, was thought to result from magical bind-ing. Plato, who is for the most part uninterested in magic, nevertheless usesit as a vehicle to admonish Athenian citizens who fall prey to the envy oftheir neighbors in believing magic to be real. As an extension of his con-cern for tranquility in the body politic, his ideal state enacts laws that checkthese private disputes on the one hand, and check the ambitions of edu-cated men who purvey magical remedies on the other.Where definitions of magic and its effects are most at issue is in Greek,and then later Roman, law and jurisprudence. The ambiguity of terms likepharmakonand venenumplagued defendants and jurists alike, aswhether by trial or careful reasoning attempts were made to distinguishintent from the nature of ‘drugs’ generally. In later centuries, the empha-sis on determining intent recedes into the background as both the drugsthemselves and a broadened and negative conception of magic moregenerally take center stage. In order to have a fuller grasp of this shift in perspective, we delved into late Roman law both to show how it reliedon earlier Greek precedents in its interpretation of magic and to fore-shadow, through compilations like Justinian’s Digest, the hardening of medieval Christian minds toward pagan magic. While the definition ofmagic would change – not least owing to the puzzling case of Apuleius –and eventually be grafted onto myriad forms of medieval heresy, for late Roman jurists it was ostensibly in the service of protecting the people that private, nocturnal sacrifices, impious rites, the charmingaway of crops, poisoning, divination from human blood, and magic’spower to disturb the minds of the masses which made magic imperativeto punish.9781405132381_4_006.qxd 30/10/2007 12:13 Page 168"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Conclusion169The key point to take away is that ancient Greek magic was an expres-sive and creative realm of human activity, and to that extent it remainsopen to new scholarly interpretation. The methodological approach to magicadopted in this book tries to appreciate magic’s basic cultural metaphors,as well as how those metaphors can change as circumstances and usersdictate, without falling prey to the temptation to regard magic as a primarily rhetorical or symbolic exercise. Part of coming to terms with individual Greek practices involves accepting that magic was not static,that such practices necessarily changed over time, and that they were operative within the same understandings of causality and agency thatinformed daily ancient life. Depositing a curse tablet in a grave withinstructions for an invisible entity, for example, simply made no sense in a world in which such invisible entities did not already play a signifi-cant role as respondents to human needs. They were part of the extendedcommunity, with due obligations and responsibilities, even if some Greeksthemselves expressed ambivalence about dealing with them. But it is ultimately modern audiences, with their often deeply felt but little under-stood anxieties about “magic,” that refuse to accept how helpful a handfrom the grave could be at times. Yet if the reader can now sympathize,even reluctantly, with that perspective, then this book will have gonesome way toward revealing how Greek magic speaks to basic and time-less human needs – because, like the Greeks, we all need help from thegrave now and then.9781405132381_4_006.qxd 30/10/2007 12:13 Page 169"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"NotesINTRODUCTION1 An excellent overview of recent scholarship can be found in Fowler and Graf 2005, with bibliography at pp. 286 – 87.
