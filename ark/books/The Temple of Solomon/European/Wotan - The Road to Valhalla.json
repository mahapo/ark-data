This book could not have been written without those great skalds of the Viking Age whoshowed us the road to Valhalla: Eyvindr skáldaspillir, the Eiríksmál poet, and Egill Skalla-Grímsson. To them and their fellows I am endlessly grateful; also, to Snorri Sturluson, whosewritings preserved so much of Wotan’s lore. In more recent times, I owe special thanks toHector Munro Chadwick and Jan de Vries, whose work has inspired much of my own. Great thanks are also due to those living folk who helped with the research and writing ofthis book. The thesis research on which Wotan is based could not have taken place withoutthe kindness of those notable scholars, Professor Dr. Karl Hauck and Dr. H.R. Ellis-Davidson(to whose excellent book The Road to Hel the title of this work pays homage) and theassistance of my Cambridge supervisor Paul Bibire. In addition, I must thank Freya Aswynn,Diana Paxson, Jim Lovette, Melodi Lammond, Jennifer Holliman, William West, GarmanLord, and Mrs. Virginia Clarke, as well as all those modern-day followers of the Norse godswith whom I have spoken and worshipped for the past twelve years, and Dr. Stephen EdredFlowers (Edred Thorsson), whose writings have been one of the chief forces leading to arevived interest in Wotan and the forgotten treasures of native Scandinavian culture. Finally, I must offer my own thanks to Wotan himself--Valhalla’s lord, god of death andmemory, who gives the mead’s gold to his true thanes, that their staves be more lasting thanthe runes carven on memorial stones.

He simply disappearedwhen the times turned against him, and remained invisible . . . working anonymously andindirectly. Archetypes are like riverbeds which dry up when the water deserts them, butwhich it can find again at any time . . . The longer it has flowed in this channel, the morelikely it is that sooner or later the water will return to its own bed. (Jung, C.J., Essays on Contemporary Events (London: Ark, 1988), p. 20) It’s like comparing Sal Mineo with James Dean. They were both in the same movie, RebelWithout a Cause, but only one of them car-smashed his way into permanent Valhalla.(comparing Franz Kline with Jackson Pollock in “Reactivating Kline’s Impact”, by RobertHughes, Time, Jan. 16, 1995, p. 46) In the dark woodland of the Northern European consciousness, a figure waits: an old man,wrapped in a blue-black cloak. His broad-brimmed hat hangs low, hiding one eye; a sharpmetal point glints at the tip of his staff, and two ravens croak from the branches of the ash-treeabove him. He beckons: in his hand he holds an ancient drinking-horn, and the scent that risesfrom it is honey and alcohol, strong enough to set the head spinning with a single whiff. He isa grim one, this old man; his spear is streaked with blood, and the hounds that crouch at hisside look more like wolves than dogs. Yet the gift he offers is enough to overcome fear, forthe brave . . . for those who are not afraid to die. For a long time, Westerners have had little time for figures such as this graybeard - thechimerical archaisms of a religion stamped out by force a thousand years ago, living on onlyas shadows in the stories of the poor and uneducated. The gods and goddesses of anagricultural people seem incongruous amid computers and cars, Concord jets and CD players:forty years ago, the thought that the ancient tribal deities of Northern Europe might haveanything to teach an educated Westerner would have been considered laughable. And whyshould this god, his worship long forgotten and his name known only through myths that arefar less a part of common Western culture than those of the Greeks or Jews, be of interestnow, when he has not been seen as a living part of existence for so long? Yet, as the pace of technology speeds onward and few physical achievements seemimpossible, our outlook on many things has begun to change. Monotheism is no longerconsidered the natural pinnacle of spiritual philosophy, as it was only a generation ago; thecustoms and spiritual practices of traditional peoples are less often seen as ‘primitive, chaotic,pagan activities that should be replaced by Christianity, the only civilized religion’,1 andbeginning to be recognised as valuable elements of living cultures. And, as we begin to recognise the value of other worldviews than that of the monotheistic,technological, progress-oriented West, we have also begun to recognise what the West haslost in the process of becoming what it is. Technology is not enough to satisfy the cravings ofthe spirit for understanding and expression: as we look around the world we have made, weare coming to realize that something is missing and to seek for it--sometimes looking at othercultures which have not been fully assimilated to the Western way of thinking, borrowingsnatches of thought from Native Americans, Orientals, Siberian shamans, Australianaborigines, and other traditional peoples in order to fill the gap we feel in our own society;sometimes looking into European folk-tales for the understanding that can be gleaned fromthe remnants of the organic traditions onto which the progressive rationalism of modernWestern society has been grafted. At the same time, we are experiencing an upswing inreligious activity, both christian and non-christian. This upswing has both heartening andfrightening elements, as charities and environmental action on the part of various religiousgroups are balanced by murder and dirty politics in the name of closely related groups: both,however, stem from the same deep desire to re-spiritualize modern life. This trend was notedby Jung earlier in the century, when he described the loss of traditional spirituality and thepsychological reactions attendant upon it as a specific malady of the West:"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5 A Pueblo chieftain once confided to me that he thought all Americans (the only whitepeople he knew) were crazy, and the reasons he gave for this view sounded exactly like adescription of people who were possessed. Well, perhaps we are. For the first time since the dawn of history we have succeeded in swallowing the whole of primitive animism into ourselves, and with it the spirit that animated nature . . . Now, for the first time, we are living in a nature bereft of gods. No one will deny the important role which the powers of the human psyche, personified as “gods”, played in the past . . . Even though nature is depsychicized, the human conditions which breed demons are as actively at work as ever. The demons have not really disappeared but have taken on another form: they have become unconscious psychic forces. This process of reabsorption went hand in hand with an increasing inflation of the ego, which became more and more evident after the sixteenth century. Finally, we even began to be aware of the psyche, and, as history shows, the discovery of the unconscious was a particularly painful episode. Just when people were congratulating themselves on having abolished all spooks, it turned out that instead of haunting the attic or old ruins the spooks were flitting about in the heads of apparently normal Europeans. (Essays on Contemporary Events, pp. 67-68) As if in direct response to Jung’s diagnosis, expressions of the desire to retrieve what hasbeen lost are growing more and more commonplace. It is almost impossible to go into anybookstore today without seeing books purporting to teach shamanism, the wisdom of theNative Americans, or the general mishmosh of philosophies and beliefs going by the name“New Age”. Some of these efforts are genuinely valuable sources of information; some arelaughable; some appear to be snake oil designed to make money off the gullible.Nevertheless, they all share a single characteristic: their presence is a response to theincreasing interest of Westerners in not only learning about traditional forms of spirituality,but in incorporating the wisdom of tribal peoples into their own lives. The Western-raisedperson of European descent who sits in a sweat lodge, goes on a vision quest, or attends a$200 seminar on the practice of shamanism is seeking something that is not a part of thesociety in which she or he has grown up: he or she has made the conscious realization thatcomplete emotional and spiritual fulfillment is not possible within the bounds of that society.The same is also true of the woman who leaves her Baptist church to join a Wiccan coven, theman who supplements or replaces his Catholicism by seeking initiation as a priest of theorishas, and the couple who turn away from Lutheranism in order to follow the gods of theirScandinavian ancestors. Whether the choice of means for seeking it is a wise choice or notdepends on the people and the circumstances: however, it is the common recognition that thissearch is necessary that begins to show what is lacking in Western society. Even more significant is the tremendous success of such works as Iron John and WomenWho Run With the Wolves - books based on the analysis of traditional folk-tales as models fordefining ourselves and discovering what is lacking: as Clarissa Pinkola Estés describes theprocess for using these works, “We contact the wildish Self through specific questions, andthrough examining fairy tales, folktales, legends, or mythos”.2 The effectiveness of thesebooks, and their strength, stems from several different factors, chief among which is theirgrounding in stories which, though preserved as children’s tales, represent something fardeeper than an evening’s amusement. In fact, these stories serve as blueprints embodying theunderstanding of a traditional culture as to the fullness of human nature: how to recognisewhen necessary elements are lacking or undeveloped, how to find or bring out what ismissing within oneself - in short, how to gain a fulfillment towards which our society todaydoes not offer any guidelines, and the process of reaching which it hinders in many ways. Trying to live without such blueprints has not only hindered Westerners, but, indeed, seemsto have done us psychological injury, an injury which is becoming more and more apparent astime goes by. On the one hand, traditional values seem to be rapidly failing: divorce rates are"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6rising, child abuse seems rampant, and our city streets are swiftly becoming grounds for openwarfare. Perhaps most significant of all, our society’s willingness to care for its old peopleand value their knowledge is disintegrating before our eyes. At the same time, many forms ofhatred - racism, homophobia, rabid isolationism, religious intolerance - all of which springfrom fear like the heads of a hydra - are not only on the rise, but making themselves felt assignificant factors in political activity. But what, exactly, is it that has been lost, and how can it be regained? The first thing that can easily be observed is that any traditional society has, over manygenerations, evolved mechanisms for dealing with crises and changes of all sorts, both on anindividual and on a group basis. Such societies have specific, prescribed rituals designed tointegrate all processes: pregnancy and birth, puberty, the stresses of labour and fighting,marriage, divorce, menopause, the recognition of age, and finally death and grief. To somedegree, every society has certain rituals for these purposes: in the West today, however, manyof them (for instance, puberty and adulthood rites, the reintegration of soldiers from war topeacetime society, divorce, menopause, and age) are not part of our society, while the othersare quickly disintegrating. To give a fairly mild example: in rural Finland, a mother would give birth in the sauna,where she and her child would then be confined until the rite of “churching”, which purifiedboth from the birthing process. As well as the hygienic advantages (the sauna being thenearest thing to a sterile environment available), this confinement encouraged rest andpromoted the bonding between mother and baby during the most vulnerable time for both, inan environment specifically designed to be warm, clean, pleasant and non-stressful, while theconcluding ritual acted to mark the end of this period of separation, returning the recoveredwoman to normal life. In contrast, Westerners usually give birth in the stressful environmentof a hospital, with no special consideration given during or after the birth to anything but thephysical requirements of the mother: even the vestigial rituals of passing out cigars at theconclusion of the birthing process and sending out birth announcements are dwindling. In traditional societies, the crucial period of puberty is especially hedged about withrituals and social mechanisms designed to smooth the difficult passage from childhood toadulthood. For instance: an African youth traditionally undergoes certain tests and initiations,after which he is accepted into the ranks of men, at which point not only does his perceptionof himself change, but the way in which he is perceived and treated by others--parents andpeers alike--must change as well. The energies of young men are then directed in othersocially acceptable ways--hunting, raiding, participating in athletic contests--until they areready to take wives and settle into the next stage of life; sexual activity is also allowedappropriate outlets. At the same time, the young man is also expected, indeed required, tointernalize the spiritual realities underlying his society and thereby to become integrated, notonly with the living members with whom he is immediately interacting, but with the stream oftradition defining his entire social context and personal understanding of the world. In contrast, Western adolescence, lacking clearly defined rites of passage, is typified byrebellion and anti-social behavior. These problems are usually direct expressions of the youngperson’s growing need to assert his or her independence, to be accepted as an adult in asociety where there is no clear sign of the transition from childhood to adulthood; where infact she or he can expect to be treated as a child long after reaching physical maturity; wherethe acceptable outlets for his or her energies and sexual desires are either minimal orexcessive; and where no solid guidance for personal spiritual experience is given--where, infact, direct spiritual experience is looked upon with suspicion as certainly indicating oddnessand possibly showing psychological instability. An acute analysis of the situation is given bySomé Malidoma in his book Of Water and the Spirit, in which he describes his return to histribe after a Western upbringing and his late initiation into manhood. In general, the absence of a ritual framework in which to conduct life produces a feeling ofalienation: a lack of self-definition in terms that are generally recognised as valid.Appropriately, the first theme that comes out strongly in nearly all books on traditional (orpseudo-traditional) spirituality, overtly or subtly, is that of the need for self-definition andself-empowerment. Iron John and Women Who Run With the Wolves use their folktaleframeworks to trace specific stages of individual development, against which the reader canmeasure him- or herself and, armed with the knowledge of which, she or he can bring out his"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7or her own internal Wild Man, witch, and other figures of power. Most forms of traditional(or even pseudo-traditional) spirituality offer similar processes. Spiritual exercises for findingone’s own “power animal” or “animal guardian” are particularly common: through the natureof this creature, one can discover one’s own innate power and the image through which toexpress it at the same time. More than that, however, such self-definition offers a visible link to a whole traditionalway of being. A person whose power animal is a bear, for instance, can obviously identifywith the strength and self-confidence of the bear; if that person is heavy, the physical traitwhich may previously have been a source of distress can now be experienced as a source ofpride and power. But more than that: the bear has a tremendously rich folklore and strongplace in the religions of the Native Americans and many other traditional cultures. Using hisor her bear as a focus, the person who has this beast as a power animal can read NativeAmerican tales of the bear as a healer, herbalist, teacher, or warrior; she or he can identifywith the bear slain and worshipped in the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala; the bear who isthe totemistic animal and greatest beast of power among some of the Ob-Ugric and Saamitribes;3 a bear-woman can seek out her links with the Jungian bear-goddess/Earth Mother,4and so forth. The discovery of a power animal, therefore, provides not only self-definition,but a place for the discoverer within a complete spiritual tradition, which in turn validifies theimportance of his or her self-discovery. Similarly, the identification of internal “characters” orpersonality elements with characters in traditional folktales provides an anchoring point forthe subject’s self-definition, and allows him or her to achieve further personal identificationwith major cultural archetypes. Another frequent element in traditional spiritual practices and those practices derived fromthem is the confrontation with one’s “shadow side”, or the initiatory process through whichone faces and overcomes a personification or personifications of one’s own fears. Themethods may vary, as do the beliefs in the degree of objective reality of the imagesencountered during these processes. However, the methods and purposes are, in the end,nearly identical: to guide the person undergoing the process into becoming a fully integratedhuman being who knows his or her own powers and, thus, has confidence in his or her controlover his or her life. Useful and necessary as this personal work is, however, it fills only part of the requirement- the answer to the questions that drive us all to some degree. It is in the renewed enthusiasmfor religion that the other side of the equation is filled: the search for the spirituality andpowers within is balanced by the search for the spirituality and powers without. Or, to put itanother way: the need for self-definition is complemented by the need for external meaning, ameaning which is most often codified in terms of, or experienced as the presence of, thesupernatural. In traditional societies, the supernatural and the natural cannot be separated: they form asingle order. As Malidoma Somé describes, . . . let’s say that you want a particular job. In the West, you do the linear thing and apply to the person in charge. In Africa they say that if you want a job, go demand it, then let the job come and get you. Q: Demand the job from whom? A: From where it is--from the spirit. The African would go and see the shaman first, because the spirit gives you the job, not the employer - he’s just a human being, that is, a spirit who doesn’t even know he’s a spirit. So you must ask spirit, who actually sees where the job is, and will bring the job to you.5 Holding to this order creates a particular sense of wholeness: that the individual is one withhis or her society, and both are balanced and integrated successfully with the worlds beyond. That integration leads to the final security: if the Other worlds and this world arecontinuously interacting and in proper balance; if the living can help and communicate withthe dead and the dead with the living, then death loses much of its terror--it becomes, not a"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8leap into “The undiscovered country, from whose bourn / No traveller returns”,6 but a passageof life which can be smoothed by appropriate rituals, both during and after the death process,into the road to a land which is well mapped-out and understood. Thus, in traditionalsocieties, the ultimate trauma--death--becomes not the end, but the crown of life: it is thepoint at which the meaning of life is fully defined. In the modern Western world, however, death has largely ceased to be seen as a necessaryand often welcome gateway to the Otherworld through which everyone must pass in time.Rather, it is an alien and frightening thing, a foe to be overcome by regular exercise, gooddiet, and improved medical technique. In a study of the social attitudes towards death anddying in Northern Ireland, Lindsay Prior particularly observes the “clinicalization” of deathand its increasing divorcement from human causes or factors, especially the emotional andphysical: “Death is primarily regarded as an illness and an aberration rather than somethingwhich is natural and inevitable.”7 Even the rituals by which our grandparents were able torecognise the presence of death and come to terms with it are swiftly disintegrating and notbeing replaced: in “the processes which intervene between physical death and disposal of thebody . . . There is, for example, no role for . . . a priesthood, a community, or kinshipgroups...they are superfluous to the system which discovers, defines, and allocates the causesof death.”8 As well as removing the human factor from the process of death and dying, modern societyis also geared to removing the awareness of death from humans. In this regard, Prior mentionsthe isolation of the mortuary from the hospital, noting that, “This isolation of the mortuary notonly signifies the separation of functions which are performed within it, but further expressesthe isolation of death. The modern mortuary is no longer a part of life . . .”9 Nils-ArvidBringéus discusses the transition from memento mori--”Remember that you shall die” to fugamortis--the flight from death, comparing the prevalence of images of death and reminders ofmortality in churches of earlier times to their complete absence in modern religion. Even inSweden, where death is much less of a taboo subject than it is in the United States--wherestate-authorized funeral homes and suppliers of gravestones stand in the heart of town besideother businesses--Bringéus observes that the word death is avoided altogether on funeralannouncements, replaced by “N.N. has left us”; that in the bereaved home, there is no sign ofa death having taken place; and that, indeed, many adults have not seen a death anywhere butthe television screen.10 The modern world, rather than dealing with death as it did in the dayswhen death was very much a daily experience, has done its best to shove it beneath the rug,which deprives both the dying person and the mourners of a clear ritual framework by whichdeath can be understood, the prospect of the individual’s transition between realms faced, andthe process of grief and memory experienced and dealt with. As a whole, Society at large has transformed itself in the past 100 years or so from a death- recognising and honoring society into one that repudiates and generally disavows not only death and dying, but aging, as well. This has occurred largely through industries that remove the dying from the home and that minimize the difference between the stilled bodies of the dead and the active bodies of the living and through psychologically-naïve religious philosophies that actually cause more suffering for those grieving and dying . . . The slow and largely unsuccessful hospice, death and dying, and elder-honoring movements have not achieved enough critical mass to influence social structures enough to permit a shift in consciousness that could result in significantly more supportive beliefs and practices for the dead and dying. (Jim Lovette, Celtic Wiccan Elder and gay psychotherapist, e-mail interview, Nov. 4,1995). This situation, and the need for such a ritual framework, has been heightened in recentyears by the AIDS crisis, which has restored some of our understanding of the frailty of life at"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9the best of times, and made us aware that the young are as vulnerable as the old. Especially inthe communities where the greatest devastation has taken place, such as San Francisco, newrituals have been created in order to deal with the grieving process: as Lovette has observed inhis worship and practice as a psychotherapist, “Certain sub-cultures and communities haveallowed for the emergence of death-positive rituals and practices, specifically, the gaycommunity in facing HIVD/AIDS and the women’s community, with chronically inadequateand discriminatory health care, cancer, abortion, and many other problems.”11 These tend tobe, by and large, pagan, New Age, and/or Eastern in flavour: Lovette mentions specificallythat “The pagan and Wiccan communities are substantial resources in many gay and women’scommunities, depending on their visibility and availability”.12 For example, Starhawk’sSpiral Dance, held at Halloween every year, includes both the reading of the names of thosewho have died during the year, with the refrain ‘What is remembered, lives” repeated afterevery name, and a portion of the ritual involves dancers who are made up, in the tradition ofmediaeval danse macabre art, as dead people in graphic stages of decomposition. The samerite also includes the chanting of a paganized form of the traditional English “LykewakeDirge”, a song about the journey of the soul through the trials of death and its judgement, withits repeated lines, This aye nicht, this aye nicht, Every nicht and all, Fire and sleet and candlelight, May Earth receive thy soulwhich, in modern San Francisco, evoke the image of the candles carried every year in theAIDS memorial procession and those set on the AIDS shrine in the middle of the UN Plaza.Among other traditional customs, Lovette also mentions candle-lighting, the performance offavourite melodies shared by the dying and the grieving, planting trees, shrubs, and flowers,gathering for a party (rather than a more solemn memorial, the changing of one’s living spaceor personal appearance to mark the loss, and the bringing of flowers, noting particularly herethat “Flowers, either brought to the scene of a tragic accident resulting in loss of life, to thehospital or bedroom of the dying, or used in ritual grieving meetings, are common. Indeed,flowers buried with the dead date back to pre-historic human culture, and can be viewed as anincredible reminder of the circle of life”.13 More modern customs that he observes aredonating money or volunteering time or other resources in memory of the dead, paying moreattention to one’s own health after the death of a significant other, and, quite commonly, aheightened political awareness or increased political activism, “especially in the morepoliticized terminal illnesses”, all of which fulfil the function of bringing some meaning to thelife and death of a loved one through creative, active memorialization. All of these reasons offer arguments for seeking understanding in traditional cultures withwhich to fill out the lacks of the Western world. However, as we are discovering, there arecertain problems with seeking out our own definition and understanding of ourselves and ouruniverse in cultures which have no direct relationship to our own. Comprehending suchcultures requires the adoption of a completely alien worldview; it often calls for anunderstanding of concepts which cannot be expressed in any Western language, which arecompletely foreign to the patterns of thought imprinted in us from the time we begin to speak.While it is possible for someone of European descent to be genuinely accepted into a NativeAmerican or African tribe, for instance, such acceptance calls for a long and difficultrenunciation of white thought and ways--of the whole of Western life. On the other hand,attempts to take up the most convenient or desirable elements of a native tradition and leaveothers results in an uneasy and ill-fitting accommodation, which does not, in the end, providethe seeker with a new and complete culture, but alienates him or her from both the society ofbirth/native acculturation and the society from which piecemeal enlightenment is sought. In the process of searching for oneself, one’s integration into society, and ultimately one’splace in the cosmos, it is clearly far easier to learn from traditional folktales with which onehas grown up and which stem from cultures that have been major contributors to one’s own"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10than to partially fit oneself to ways of thought that are all but incomprehensible to aliens.However, the Western mindset is geared to forgetting that Europe had a living, thriving,religion and folk-culture of its own, which was similar in many important respects tocurrently surviving traditional societies. The native tradition of Northern Europe, inparticular, is usually seen by those who have not studied it as the last threshold of “primitive,chaotic, pagan activities”, as the Scandinavian countries were not only the last to bechristianised, but had a profound effect on christian Europe during the last centuries beforetheir own religion was extirpated. As a result of this, the most common Western image ofViking Age Scandinavia is of bloodthirsty, illiterate raiders, who were not merely uncivilized,but the chief menace to civilization: except as a symptom of the Dark Ages, most historybooks have little to say of the Norse until they had settled elsewhere and converted - untilthey had become Normans, French-speaking christians, preserving of their origins only whata romantic historian might speak of as “the driving vitality of the Northmen”. The experienceof one graduate student at Texas Women’s University is not, unfortunately, untypical: Well, my history of Medieval Europe class was the class I was referring to. The teacher's specialization is ecclesiastical history (if that doesn't say it all), and he picked for our text this ridiculous book by N. Cantor. Cantor treats the whole Middle Ages throughout Europe as if there were no religions there but the Abrahamic ones. He even spends pages retelling the stories of the Old and New Testaments (in case no one has ever heard them, I guess). Meanwhile the book (therefore the class) ignores the existence of any culture besides the Roman one from 300 C.E. on. When I brought up in class the fact that all religions of the time should be represented if one was going to be, the teacher ignored me completely. When the book came to the barbarians, Cantor compared them to \"marauding urban street gangs\" that only donated their bloodline to Europe, and even that wasn't worth it. I protested this chapter as well, only to get the response, \"Well Jennifer, the author is Jewish, so what do you expect?\" I told him I expected supplementary texts that clarified the information, but was told there would be none. Then he showed Kenneth Clark's \"Civilisations\" video called \"By the Skin of our Teeth\" that said the Germanic tribes had no regard for life, no sense of permanence, and only kept craftsmen around for weapons . . . A lot of it is the same in other classes. In the mythology class I surveyed four different groups, and no one (including me) got any information on Norse mythology because the prof. spent half the semester on the Greek and Roman stuff we already know . . . (The professor in) my religion class at TWU . . . says that polytheistic religions are a stage in the religious process and therefore not as sophisticated as monotheism. (Jennifer Holliman, e-mail interview, Oct. 24, 1995). Yet it is precisely that abused and forgotten native tradition--the religion of the Vikings,the Anglo-Saxons, the Goths and Vandals--which, in Northern Europe, was the embodimentof the elements that Western civilization has lost and for which many are seeking sodesperately elsewhere. Malidoma Somé asks, “Why is it that the modern world can’t dealwith its ancestors and endure its past?”14 At least part of the answer lies in the fact that a largeportion of the modern world--the descendants of the Norse, Anglo-Saxons, and Germanictribes people--are not aware of their ancestors, or their past: they have only a dim image ofhorned helmets and bloody axes, of tribes of barbarians who were not part of the cultureWesterners believe themselves to have inherited by right, but rather its enemies, who onlyappear, at best, as footnotes in classes on Western history. For Northern Europeans to dealwith their ancestors and understand their past--let alone enduring it--they first have to learnwho these ancestors were and where their past came from. Though not a shamanic culture, as most of the traditional cultures surviving today are, thenative religion of the North has many characteristics in common with Native American andAfrican tradition. Every person was thought to have a fylgja, or fetch, often perceived as asemi-independent animal spirit whose nature embodied that of the person it was attached to.Ancestor-worship was regularly practiced; the spirits of departed kin were often thought to"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11look after their descendants. The future was made known, and matters in the Otherworlds,often made clear, through dreams. As with most traditional cultures, the stones, the streams,and every part of nature was inhabited, by beings called land-wights--beings whose goodwilland comfort were so important that the laws of heathen Iceland required that “men should nothave head-prowed ships in the harbour, and if they had, then they should take off the headbefore they came in sight of land, and never sail towards the land with gaping heads oryawning snouts so that the land-wights were frightened by them”15 (the belief in these wightsis still current in Iceland among a large percentage of the population). Like most traditional cultures, also, the Germanic peoples made limited use of writing. Thesurviving examples of their native runic alphabet are chiefly memorial stones and statementsof ownership or manufacture (Ketill made a good comb; Thorkell owns this axe), althoughgraffiti and short messages scratched on bones and sticks were not uncommon, and both thearchaeological and literary corpora contain a number of examples of magical runicinscriptions as well. However, they had a tremendously highly developed oral culture: thepoetry of the Viking Age skalds (often professional poets attached to the retinues of kings ormajor noblemen) is at least as formally structured and complex of image and conception asanything written in christian Europe during the same period, and in several instances possiblymore so; and competitions of poetic skill were fit for warriors to engage in, as seen in thescene in Orkneyinga saga where the jarl Rögnvaldr Kali challenges a man named Oddi tomake a verse about a wall-hanging in the hall - adding that Oddi would have to make hispoem after the jarl had spoken his own on the subject, in the same span of time, and not usingany word that the jarl had used (Oddi succeeded). The Norse verse-convention of the kenning,or riddle-image, was based in large part on knowledge of the religion: for instance, sinceÓðinn was a god especially associated with death in battle, and Yggr, “The Terrible”, was oneof his by-names, the slain could be called “the fair barley of Yggr”, 16 while poetry itself isreferred to by a number of kennings describing the god’s theft of the mead of inspiration, suchas “the stream of the gladness-rock (heart) of Mím’s friend (Óðinn)”.17 And, just as it had its professional poets, Northern Europe also had its professionalmagicians and priests, and its own native forms of magic. From the time of Tacitus to the endof the Viking Age, the Germanic peoples were known for their attention to the words of theirprophetesses, or spae-wives: like some of the great medicine people of the Native Americans,Germanic prophetesses such as the Veleda, through their visions, were able to guide andadvise their warleaders in their resistance against the Roman invasions. Visionary tranceswere not uncommon; the saga of Erik the Red describes a professional prophetess callingforth and interrogating spirits about the future. A practice which also took place was “sittingout”: sitting alone on a high place at night, perhaps either to see visions or speak with spirits. Although much of this lore was lost with the conversion to christianity, much alsosurvived in folk culture. A number of the traditional motifs in the Märchen, or “fairy stories”such as those collected by the Brothers Grimm, are repeated in the Norse tales of gods andheroes. For instance: the story of Sleeping Beauty, pricking her finger on a spindle to sleepfor an hundred years and be awakened only by the destined hero who can force his way pastan impassable barrier is told in the Eddic poem Sigrdrífumál, where the valkyrie Sigrdrífa (thesame figure as Wagner’s Brünnhilde) is pricked with a sleep-thorn by Óðinn (Wotan) andmust sleep until the hero Sigurðr (Siegfried) forces his way past a wall of shields, or in someversions, a ring of fire, to awaken her. It is no exaggeration to say that the native religion ofNorthern Europe is still a strong, if largely unseen, thread running through the culture ofNorthern Europe; and that the road to understanding opened by analysing our folktales inregards to what they show us of our lives and needs leads inevitably back to that native origin.In the search for understanding--of ourselves, of our proper relation to our society, and of ourspiritual existence and goals--the way to recover what has been lost is to go back to the pointwhere it was lost: the point at which what had been a traditional culture, where the individualwas completely integrated with his or her society, god/esses, and the natural world, ceased tobe such and, instead, became a part of the christian West. And in the traditional culture of Northern Europe, the first step on that road, and its greatestchallenge, is the meeting with the old man at the edge of the wood--the old, one-eyed god,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12whom the Vikings knew as Óðinn, the English as Woden, and the Germans as Wotan--andleads on to a hall which is still very much a part of our cultural expression, whose name,alone of all the halls of the gods, is a part of our everyday vocabulary: Valhalla. Wotan’s history is a long and impressive one. His name stems from a proto-Germanic *Woðanaz, a word related to the German word for fury (Wut), the Gothic word for frenziedpossession (woþs), the Icelandic adjective óðr, “raging”, and the archaic English wood,meaning “insane”. At its very root, this word stems from an Indo-European word for “voice”,which also developed into the Latin vates and Irish fáith, words describing inspired priestsand poets, and supplied the name of the Norse mead of poetry, Óðrœrir - “Stirrer ofInspiration”. However, the form from which the god’s name is derived separated from theword for voice or inspiration perhaps five hundred years before the beginning of the CommonEra: as far as we can know, he was always, “The Frenzied One”, or perhaps, in the older formWod, simply “Frenzy”. This name, *Woðanaz, developed into the German form Wotan orWodan, the Anglo-Saxon Woden, and the Old Norse Óðinn (usually rendered in English asOdin): there is no doubt that the same god was referred to by these dialectal forms of hisname, and little doubt that his cult was substantially the same among the branches of theGermanic people where he is known to have been worshipped. Whether the Goths knew agod bearing the name that would have become Wodans in their tongue or not is a questionthat is unlikely to ever be solved, since only the faintest shreds of lore about Gothic religionsurvived their conversion. But they were at least aware of his original force, woþs, as apossessive frenzy: in his translation of the Bible into Gothic, Ulfila uses this word for theGreek daimonizomenos and daimonistheis, words which imply the presence of a possessingdaimon. Moreover, the use is in a context showing certain characteristics known from the cultof Wotan: the possessed man demonstrates a physical frenzy similar to that of the god’sberserks, he dwells among the tombs, and his ability to break his fetters is reminiscent of thegod’s special might of binding and loosing. Thus, even if the Goths were not familiar with thedeity, they were at least familiar with his root force. The question of where and when Wotan’s cult began and how it spread has yet to besettled. The range of theories includes everything from seeing him as a native Scandinaviangod since the earliest days to interpreting him as a Roman import who came to the Germanictribes when they adopted the idea of writing and developed the runes that are associated withhim in Norse literature; discussing the various possibilities is, unfortunately, quite beyond thescope of this book. However, we are reasonably sure that the god was worshipped at thebeginning of the Common Era, and probably for some time before that, by the Germanictribesmen fighting against Rome, who offered up their captive enemies to him. The Anglesand Saxons who made their way over to Britain in the fifth century when the rising waters ofthe North Sea threatened their Continental homelands drew the authority of their royal linesfrom his place at the head of their dynasties: even today, Queen Elizabeth II and QueenMargrete of Denmark can both trace their lineage back to him. Wotan was one of the mostpowerful and active gods of the Viking Age, on whom the fierce Northern warriors called notonly for victory in battle, but also for the skills of poetry and magic, rune-writing andknowledge of lore. After his people were subjugated by christian kings, Wotan lived on as a shadowy demon-figure, leader of the spectral horde called the Furious Host or Wild Hunt, and general sign ofill-omen. But his career was not over when his worship ended. As soon as the expansions ofthe nineteenth century led nations to look within themselves and seek to define their owncultures, their own strengths and characters, he appeared again: dominating the music of aturning century as he had once dominated the poems of the Vikings, firing the imagination inthis new age as he had once fired that of the old--standing on the opera stage as the chiefprotagonist of Richard Wagner’s Ring Cycle, the wise, furious, but ultimately doomed god, inwhich incarnation he is best known today. Even the worship of Wotan has not stayed dead. For the last twenty-five years, smallgroups of people in Iceland, England, and America have lifted horns of ale and mead to thisgod after the manner of the Saxons and Vikings. Not only that, many of these groups, such asthe Ásatrúmenn of Iceland and the North American-based Ring of Troth, have achieved legalrecognition, and their numbers are swelling swiftly. The reasons for Wotan’s particular endurance, of all the gods in the Norse pantheon, can"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13sometimes be hard to fathom. In the tales of the North, he is often portrayed as grim,bloodthirsty, and cruel--the only god who we know to have regularly received humansacrifice, from the first reports we have of his worship among the Germanic tribesmen to theend of the Viking Age. His heroes and heroines are brutal folk--berserks, raiders, werewolves,and murderers of children; he himself is an oath-breaker and betrayer, more often to be seencreeping about disguised as an old low-life than sitting dignified in his godly seat; and hisblood-brother and best friend is Loki, the trickster of giant race who, in the end, helps to bringabout the doom of the gods. He has over an hundred and eighty heiti, or by-names, includingsuch ominous titles as Helblindi (Hel-Blinder or Death-Blinder), Báleygr (Funeral Pyre-Eyed), Skollvaldr (Ruler of Treachery or Cunning), and Geiguðr (The One Swinging On TheGallows); this prevalence of alternate names may not only show his penchant for disguisesand dominant role in Norse poetry, but may also have derived from a certain fear of speakinghis true name aloud, lest it draw his attention.18 The more closely he is examined, the darker Wotan appears. Although he is called upon bywarriors, and characteristically thought of as a god of battle, he does not take part in battlehimself: his blessing is the arc of his spear--cast over, not those who shall win, but those whoare doomed to die, seen as sacrifices to him. His knowledge comes from necromancy andjourneys to the realm of the dead; even the mead he drinks is brewed from the heartblood of amurder victim and gotten by the breaking of one of the solemnest oaths known to the Norse,the vow on the holy ring. And the very hall where he sits as a god, his own home, is calledValhalla--the Hall of the Slain, where he gathers his chosen dead. He is an ominous figure,who does not lend himself easily to understanding or love. Yet this god was one of the favourite deities of Northern Europe for at least a thousandyears that we know of, and probably for some time before Tacitus wrote. Once, this mighthave been attributed to the perceived dark and bloody-minded character of Germanic culture,with allusions to the furor Teutonicus. However, the time is long past when the Northernpeoples could fairly, through ignorance or misunderstanding on the part of modern scholars,have been dismissed as violent barbarians in this manner. We know now that the Germanicsuccesses in the Migration Age, often caricatured with the image of dirty, fir-clad hordessweeping down on Rome, stemmed from their ability to adapt, learn, and make treaties. Ashas been observed, the Germanic peoples were far more dangerous to Rome as her gueststhan her foes; the Vikings owed more to the technological superiority of their ships and theirresearches in the natural science of navigation than to their possession of a culture morebattle-focused than others in the Dark Ages. We first see Wotan appearing as a Germanic battle-god in the writings of the Romanhistorian Tacitus, who described how the Chatti and Hermunduri, before a battle, made a vowto sacrifice the entire defeated army, men, horses, and booty alike, to “Mars andMercurius”.19 Tacitus’ Mercury is generally taken to have been Wotan, as the equivalencebetween the two was maintained from a very early period until the end of the Viking Age: forinstance some two or three centuries after Tacitus wrote, when the god-names of theweekdays were translated into Germanic forms, “Mercury’s Day” became “Wotan’s Day”, or,as it still survives in English, Wednesday. The cult of Mercury as Tacitus describes it isgenerally consonant with what we know about the cult of Wotan: the Roman historianmentions, for instance, that “of the gods, (the Germanic tribesmen) give a special worship toMercury, to whom on certain days they count even the sacrifice of human life lawful”.20Tacitus’ description of the aftermath of the battle of Teutoberger Wald, where Varus’ threelegions were destroyed by Arminius the Cheruscan and Rome’s ambitions to conquerGermany were fatally crushed, also shows significant similarities to the vow of the Chatti andHermunduri:21 the defeated warriors are not merely taken prisoner or slain, but dedicated asreligious sacrifices, in a manner largely characteristic of the cult of Óðinn as described byViking Age and mediaeval Norse sources. Hard by lay splintered spears and limbs of horses, while human skulls were nailed prominently on the tree-trunks. In the neighbouring groves stood the savage altars at which (the Cheruscans) had slaughtered the tribunes and chief centurions."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 Survivors of the disaster . . . spoke of the tribunal from which Arminius made his harangue, all the gibbets and torture-pits for the prisoners . . .”22 In these earliest accounts of his cult, Wotan appears chiefly as a battle-god, giver ofvictory to his chosen ones. But as a battle-god, he is a rather peculiar figure: he is not awarrior, not to be compared to Mars or other war-gods. It is the host of the enemy that isdedicated to him, not the host of his worshipper that receives his blessing, and once thatdedication has been made, he must receive his sacrifice, whether on the field of battle or inthe hallowed groves afterwards. The Norse sources also seem to show us a perception of the slain as sacrifices givendirectly to Óðinn. In verse 12 of Hrafnsmál (“The Speech of the Raven”) the poet Thórbj_rnhornklofi has a raven telling a valkyrie about one of King Haraldr Hairfair’s successful battle,at the end of which, “The slain lay there on the sand, dedicated to the one-eyed dweller inFrigg’s embrace; we rejoice over such doing”. Helgi trausti Óláfsson boasts that, “I gaveÓðinn the strong son of Thórmódr; I gave the ruler of the gallows Óðinn’s sacrifice, and thecorpse to the ravens”. This belief is emphasized by the casting of the specifically Óðinnic spear to openhostilities. The fullest account is given in Styrbjarnar þáttr: before his battle with Styrbjörn,King Eiríkr the Victorious goes to the temple of Óðinn and offers his own life as a sacrificewhich the god may take after ten years, if only Óðinn will grant him the victory. After thisprayer, a tall man with a broad hat comes up to Eiríkr and gives him a reed, telling him to castit over Styrbjörn’s army with the words, “Óðinn have you all!” Eiríkr does so; Styrbjörn’shost immediately goes blind and an avalanche falls over them, killing them all.23 In TheBattle of the Goths and the Huns, thought to be one of the oldest poems in the Norse corpusor at least to preserve a quantity of ancient material,24 a similar, though less immediatelydevastating, scene takes place. The old Gizurr Grýtingaliði, a rede-giver and strife-stirrerwho, if he is not Óðinn himself in one of his many disguises, at least appears as a stronglyÓðinnic figure,25 rides up to the Hunnish army and says, Your host is frightened, and fey your leaders, Above you fly battle-flags-- Óðinn is angry with you! . . . So Óðinn lets his shot fly, as I said before (verses 27-28).26 For the spear as a sacrificial instrument, we have both literary records and iconographicevidence: the account of Odin’s own self-sacrifice by means of hanging and stabbing in theEddic poem Hávamál, with the corresponding sacrifice of his worshipper King Vikar inGautreks saga, is confirmed as stemming from Viking Age practice by the Lärbro St.Hammars I picture stone, carved on the Swedish island of Gotland in probably the ninthcentury. This stone shows scenes of battle surrounding a human sacrifice: one man,recognisable as a warrior by his shield, is hung from a tree, another lies on an altar beforehim, and the robed priest who is performing the sacrifice holds a spear. The interlaced tripletriangle appears a number of times on stones of this sort, and in modern Norwegian weavingthe pattern is known as a valknut--the knot of the slain; it is often thought to be a sign ofÓðinn, perhaps associated specifically with Óðinnic sacrifice. Thus, we can say that in his most usual form as a god of battle-victory, Wotan appears notas a war-god, but as a god of death: his function is generally to give victory by default to thesurviving side. The name by which his handmaidens were known, valkyries--”Choosers of theSlain”--and some of his own titles, such as Valthögnir (Receiver of the Slain), Val-Týr (Godof the Slain), and Valkjósandi (Chooser of the Slain--a masculine form corresponding to thefeminine valkyrja, or valkyrie), bear this out, as, ultimately, does the road which leads to hisown hall--Valhalla, the “Hall of the Slain”,27 where he receives the dead. Yet there is more to this god, to the complex character which has fired so manyimaginations up to the present day. The god of battle-death, the giver of berserk blood-lust, isalso the giver of inspiration: the Vikings, who appear as the archetype of barbarism in"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15Western culture, were also notable poets, and many of their poems began by referring toÓðinn’s winning of the mead of poetry and his gift of that same mead to the composer of theverses. At the same time, it comes as no surprise that many--perhaps most--of the same poemsdealt with the subject of battle-death: with Óðinn’s choices of heroes to fell, the sacrifices ofslain men made to him, and his reception of the best in his own hall. As well as the giver of poetry, Wotan also appears as the chief god of wisdom and magic,and it is in this form that he often exerts the greatest fascination. The shadow of this aspecthas survived particularly strongly in the twentieth century through the works of Tolkien: bothGandalf the Gray, the old wizard with his broad hat and his staff, travelling about in disguiseto learn from all he comes across and revealing himself at the most vital moments, andSaruman the White, the deceptive, slippery, untrustworthy wizard looking down from his hightower to stir his strife and brew his plots, appear to have been shaped by the images of Wotanas the wise magician in the Norse literature with which Professor Tolkien was so deeplyfamiliar. Much of the romanticism of the runes stems directly from their connection with thegod: it is the literature dealing with his use of them to waken the dead, to help in birthing, tobedazzle the minds of men, and for various other purposes that gives the clearest picture oftheir magical character, making it easy for many folk to overlook the large body of evidencethat shows the runes as primarily a means of mundane communication. Wotan’s runes,immortalized in poetry and fiction from the Viking Age to the present day, are the potentmysteries of the old enchanter, far more fascinating than the everyday inscriptions such as“Thorkell owns this comb.” But like the blood-brewed mead of poetry, the god’s mental crafts cannot be separatedfrom his character as a death-god. According to Hávamál, he learned the runes through hisown death, dangling hanged and stabbed with his own spear for nine nights as a sacrifice tohimself. He is also a necromancer, who learns his lore and gets his knowledge of things tocome from the severed head of the giant Mimir or from the dead he awakens to talk to him,such as the seeress whom he calls forth at the gates of Hel in Baldrs draumar. The sameravens who feed off the corpses rotting on the battlefield or dangling from the gallows asWotan’s sacrifices are another source of his great knowledge: known as Huginn and Muninn,“Thoughtful” and “Mindful”, they fly over the world every day to return to him with news ofthe doings below. It is in the relationship between the mysterious powers and gifts Wotan offers and theworld of death from which they spring--between the god as receiver of battle-sacrificed livesand the god as the giver of the mead of poetry through which the slain are foreverremembered--that something of the depth of the Northern understanding of death and life, andthe integration of one into the other, can be seen. The core of this understanding is summedup by certain words the god is said to have spoken, which are often thought to express theguiding spirit of the most tumultuous and powerful age of his worshippers. According to theEddic poem Hávamál (The Words of the High One) 76-77: Cattle die, kinsmen die, you yourself shall die. But words of fame never die, for him who gets them well. Cattle die, kinsmen die, you yourself shall die. I know one thing that never dies, how each dead man is judged.The road to Valhalla, then and now, is the road to undying memory and fame, bought at theprice of a good death--the sacrifice to Wotan, in return for which he offers his highest gift. In analysing Norse religion and the culture of which it was an integral part, a variety ofsources has to be used. Our chief literary sources are the Poetic and Prose Edda’s--the first acollection of mythical and heroic poems, the dates of which are generally thought to rangefrom approximately the eighth century C.E. to the twelfth; the second a systematicpresentation of Norse mythology written down by the Icelandic author, historian, and politicalfigure Snorri Sturluson circa 1220-21 as an instructional text and attempt to keep the fading"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16art of skaldic poetry alive. It is from Snorri that we get most of the popular images and talesof Norse mythology; however, both his own christianity and his desire to present a coherentand consistent literary work can be shown to have strongly influenced his retelling of thereligion of his forebears. As well as the Eddas, the sagas written down in Iceland (chiefly overthe course of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries) often contain references to religiouspractices, or descriptions of the activities of the gods, most particularly Óðinn. Because of thelate date of their writing--ranging from two to four hundred years after the conversion of theIcelanders, which took place in the year 1000 C.E.--and the strong antiquarian interest ofeducated Icelanders in their heathen past, there is considerable discussion as to howaccurately the sagas portray Norse religious custom and beliefs; however, many of themythological details that appear even in the latest and most literary sagas do appear to havegenuine heathen origins. The contemporary native references to Norse religion appear chiefly in the poetry of theskalds, which ranges back as early as the beginning of the ninth century, and in the occasionalmention of a god or practice in the memorial runestones, which were carved from roughly thethird century until well into the christian period. These references, while undoubtedlyauthentic reflections of the beliefs of their time, are made problematical as guides to thereligion both by their brevity and by the difficulty of interpreting the meaning of many of theinscriptions. Germanic religion was also described occasionally by historians from other cultures.Tacitus is the earliest and fullest of these sources, particularly in his Germania, meant todescribe the culture and practices of the Germanic tribes to educated Romans, and perhaps toremind his readers of the continuing presence of a “German menace” across the Rhine. Othernotable historians and commentators include Procopius, Adam of Bremen, the archbishop ofHamburg who, in the eleventh century, wrote a lengthy description of the great temple atUppsala and the rituals practiced there, and the English priest Wulfstan (late tenth--earlyeleventh century), whose treatis De Falsis Deiis described and condemned the heathenpractices of the Norse in no uncertain terms. The problem with such sources is that, althoughthey contain varying amounts of material which can be shown to be genuine (for instance,Tacitus’ description of the peculiar hairdo of the Suebi--the “Swabian knot”--was verified in1948 by the discovery of a male head adorned with such a hairdo in a bog at Osterby),28 theyare largely based on second-, third-, or fourth-hand information, perhaps filled out with acertain amount of literary license, and therefore cannot be considered to be absolutelyreliable. Archaeology supplies more authoritative material, both in the form of direct physicalrepresentations of religious beliefs such as appear, for instance, on the Gotlandic picturestones, and in the evidence that can be gathered from grave goods and excavation of culticsites. However, it must be remembered that the items left behind by the dead are subject to awide variety of interpretations. For instance, a picture stone that one researcher sees asshowing a dead man’s reception in Valhalla may be taken by another as memorializing asuccessful battle. The ships that appear so frequently on the same stones can be interpreted asshowing the belief that the Otherworld lies across a large body of water or a scene from amyth or heroic tale in which ship-travel is important; they may be read as memorials to a deadseafarer, a man who died at sea, or one who died across the ocean; or they may be seen assimply a standard artistic motif with no direct association to the deceased--assuming, indeed,that these stones are all memorials to the dead. Likewise, it is difficult to tell whether a horsein the grave means that the dead man was meant to ride to the Otherworld, that he wasexpected to need a steed in the Otherworld, or that he or one of the gods or goddessesreceived the horse as a sacrifice requesting a blessing or propitiating the intended recipient. All of these sources, and the flaws in each, must be considered in any analysis of Norsereligion in order to come closer to the thoughts of those who practiced it in the early days. Inseeking to find out, not only what the Scandinavians of the Viking Age believed, but how it isrelevant to our own time and what we can recover from the folkways of Northern Europe, theuse of anthropological methods and psychological analysis is also useful. By these means, looking closely at what the traditional native culture of Scandinaviabelieved about death and life, about memory and art, we shall take the horn the old man"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17Wotan offers us.

It is bred inevitably by the first recognition of death, perhapswhen a child’s pet goldfish floats belly-up in its bowl or a turtle ceases to crawl about itstank; it continues to trouble throughout the hazards and heartbreaks of adolescence. Intimes of war this question reaches the chief rank of importance: it has been said that “thereare no atheists in foxholes”, a saying which surely applies as much to the hope ofsomething beyond death as to the rule of luck and the whim of fate--or the gods--in thethick of battle. In middle age, one is likely to begin burying parents and friends, and towonder about their fate; as one grows older, the gates of the grave seem to widen beforeone. In any culture, it is the exceptional person who rejects all belief in Otherworld andafterlife, declaring the cessation of cerebral activity to be the end of all being. Just as all people wonder about the fate of the soul after death, so all religions have ananswer--or several answers--to the question. Some of the most common elements aretravelling to a land of peace, plenty, and bliss (assuming that one has lived well and/or beengiven proper death-rites), or, alternatively, either going to a realm of punishment, joining ahost of evil spirits, or wandering lost in desolate places (if one has lived badly and/or notreceived appropriate death-rites); going to a general realm of ghosts and shades; continuingto exist as a spirit worshipped and fed by one’s descendants; being reborn, either as ananimal of some appropriate sort or as a human being; if one has committed some greatmisdeed or failed to do something that one ought to have done, being bound to earth as arestless ghost until a living person can carry out the action necessary to release the dead.Nearly all religions include at least a positive and a negative alternative, though thedetermination between the two may range among anything from the careful weighing of theheart seen in ancient Egyptian belief (the outcome of which could be affected both by deedsperformed during life and by the performance of appropriate rituals by family and therelevant professionals after death) to the various alternatives offered by different forms ofchristianity (such as the Catholic requirement of last rites to cleanse the soul versus, forinstance, the Baptist insistence that accepting Christ as a personal saviour is the necessaryritual to get into Heaven, or the Calvinist doctrine of predestination). Even christianity, with its strong emphasis on judgement and an Otherworldlydestination for the soul, was by no means able to root out the belief in various forms ofghosts, both harmful and helpful. Rather, a syncretization of beliefs took place, so that, forinstance, in the Balkans, a child conceived during a church holy period or one who is theillegitimate offspring of illegitimate parents, is likely to become a vampire, as is a Greekperson who is ill-tempered or a great sinner. In Scandinavia, the restless dead include the“guilty dead” (persons who moved boundary stones, committed perjury, stole communionwafers or called on the devil, and sinners in general), the “solicitous dead” (those who hadleft a task or promise unfulfilled, mothers dying in childbirth or the engaged who diedbefore marriage, and so forth), the “unsatisfied dead” (those not buried properly oraccording to their wishes, those overly grieved or unmourned), the ‘avenging dead’ (thosebadly treated, enchanted, or murdered), and the “disturbing dead”, or poltergeists.Pentikäinen observes that the walking dead are usually explained within christian terms assinners who have breached christian norms or broken taboos, while the “innocent dead”“reflect the intimate relationship between living and dead members of a family . . . Thesame is suggested by legends and memorates in which the dead person appears in asolicitous role to caution or express sympathy with the living . . . ” The phenomenon ofdead family members appearing to warn or comfort the living is attested to in folkloreworldwide, and need not necessarily be a survival of Scandinavian belief as such, though itsstrong presence in the native religion suggests the possibility of continuity. The restless dead are, however, unusual: their roaming emphasizes the normal beliefthat “people who have died a natural death and are properly provided for by their relatives"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19reach the land of the dead”. And it is, for better or worse, these lands or Otherworldly fatesthat are inclined to shape the character of the religion. A religion which offers a choicebetween infinite bliss and infinite pain in the afterlife, for instance, has a stranglehold onthe activities of its worshippers so long as they accept the official terms regarding thejudgement of their souls. Earthly responsibility becomes less important than spiritualresponsibility: the abandonment of family, position, and possessions--casting away treasureon Earth in order to lay up treasure in Heaven--becomes a positive good. Likewise, such areligion has a necessary interest in defining sin and virtue so that its worshippers will knowprecisely which actions lead to which afterlife result and what they must do in order to gaina place in the preferable destination. In a culture where one’s hope of a good afterlife isbased on the offerings made after death by one’s descendants, on the other hand, the mostimportant thing in life is to keep on good terms with one’s family, fulfilling allresponsibilities towards them properly so that they, in turn, will fulfil their responsibilitiesof burning incense or setting out food and drink for the dead. The native beliefs of Scandinavia show, more or less simultaneously, the full range ofafterlife fates. However, the images which are most familiar to us, the two halls Valhallaand Hel, are those which seem to replicate the christian Heaven and Hell most closely--indeed, the christian place of punishment draws its name in English, German, and theScandinavian languages from the name of the Germanic underworld: Hell, the “place ofconcealment”. To understand how the Norse thought about death and its relationship to life,it is necessary to look closely at these two realms, and especially Valhalla--how it wasreached, and what entry into it meant.1. Valhalla and Hel The name “Valhalla” is better known in Western culture than that of its lord Óðinn orWotan. It has, in fact, become an archetype for the barbarian afterworld: a Paradise towhich entry is not gained by virtue, but by bravery, where the warrior-dead fight all dayand drink all night. This is the image shown to us by Snorri Sturluson, writing ca. 1220C.E., in his dialogue between the king Gangleri and the god Hár (Wotan in a very thindisguise): (Gangleri) You say that all those men who have fallen in battle from the time of the heavens’ raising are now come to Óðinn in Valhöll . . . What do the Einherjar (Óðinn’s chosen warriors) have to drink that lasts them as fully as the food, or is water drunk there? (Hár) You ask wondrously, that All-Father should bid kings or jarls or other powerful men to himself and give them water to drink . . . There is a goat called Heiðrún, who stands on top of Valhöll . . . and from her udders runs that mead, with which she fills a cauldron every day; it is so big that all the Einherjar become fully drunken from it . . . (Gangleri) But how do the Einherjar pass their time when they are not drinking? (Hár) Every day, when they have clad themselves, then they arm themselves and go out into the yard and battle together and fell each other; that is their play; and when meal- time approaches, then they ride home to Valhöll and set themselves down to drink, as is said here: All the Einherjar in Óðinn’s hall, hew each other each day; the slain they choose, from slaughter ride, sit the more gladly together.(Edda Snorra Sturlusonar. Finnur Jónsson, ed. Copenhagen: Nordisk Forlag, 1931, pp.42-44). Earlier, Snorri has informed us that to Hel’s realm “were sent . . . men dead of sicknessand of old age”, setting up the sharp popular distinction between the battle-paradise for thefew and the gloomy afterlife for the many--in which the name of the hall is Rain-Wet, thedish is called Hunger, the knife Starvation, the serving-man and maid are named Slow-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20Walking, the threshold Stumbling-Block, the bed Sickbed, and the curtains Gleaming Bale. The name Valhalla itself--probably “Hall of the Slain” (though, as will be discussedlater, other interpretations are possible), as contrasted to Hel (“Concealment”; theunderworld)--seems to support such a distinction, as do the two skaldic poems in which itappears: Eiríksmál, telling of how Óðinn greeted Eiríkr Blood-Axe with his train of felledfoes, and Hákonarmál, which describes the reception of the battle-fallen Hákon the Good inthe same hall. The belief that the only hope for a happy afterlife for a Norseman lay throughdeath on the battlefield has also shaped the views of popular culture. For instance, in thefilm The Vikings, based very loosely on the saga of Ragnar Loðbrók, when Ragnar isthrown into the wolf-pit, he asks for a sword, saying that he can only get into Valhalla if hedies with a sword in his hand--returning us, again, to the paradise of the barbarians whovalue nothing except bravery and fighting skills. But was that the case among the Norse? We do not know how much the sagamen of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries knewabout the religion of their forebears, but we do know that they had other examples ofafterlife beliefs to draw on. On the one hand, well-educated Icelanders such as Snorri wereaware of Classical literature (in the prologue to the Prose Edda, for instance, Snorri tracesThórr’s lineage back to Priam of Troy) as a model for pagan beliefs. On the other, by theperiod of the sagas, a certain amount of christian contamination of the native culture hadalready taken place, so that, for instance, the description of a heathen hof (temple) given bythe composer of Eyrbyggja saga is described in terms of, and looks suspiciously like, achristian church, complete with “a chamber similar to the choir in churches now, and therestood a stall in the middle of the floor like an altar”. Snorri’s perception of the Norse afterlife seems to follow the Greek model. He often uses“Valhöll” as a synonym for either the bright world of the gods itself or as the name of thechief hall in that world, in a manner reinforcing the apparent Valhöll-Hel dualism. Forinstance, when Snorri describes the entrance of the jötunn (giant) Hrungnir into the realm ofthe gods, Hrungnir first passes through the gates of Ásgarðr, then is asked by all the godsinto Valhöll, where Freyja is the only one who dares to keep serving him drink after he hashad too many and begins to make threats, and Thórr finally has to be called as an enforcer. His gloomy description of the underworld Hel, inhabited by those who are not taken upspecifically by the gods, seems to reflect the melancholy character of Hades, the shadow-lands in which it is worse to be a king than it is to be a slave upon the living earth; though itcould also be argued that christian semantic contamination of the native word for theunderworld influenced Snorri’s portrayal of Hel as a decidedly unpleasant place. The sense of a heathenized Heaven/Hell dualism appears especially clearly in Brennu-Njáls saga. When his temple is found burnt, the notable heathen hero Hákon jarl remarksthat “the man who has done this shall be cast out of Valhöll and never come there”. Thistext is clearly an antiquarian’s attempt to fit heathen names to the foreign dualism ofchristianity: “Valhöll” has suddenly become, not the Hall of the Slain, but the afterlifedestination for good heathens. Looking on these texts, the question, then, comes inevitably to us: what, if any, of thesurviving traits that we associate with “Valhalla” are really a part of Norse belief, and howmuch was cobbled up by antiquarians and modern fantasists. The difficulty of dating theearlier texts makes the question hard to judge; but when the sources that seem likelier tostem from the heathen era are analyzed, the view of the afterworld that appears is morecomplex and deeper than that given by Snorri and the Njáls saga composer.2. Cosmos and Afterlives The most complete description of the Norse cosmology is found in the Eddic layGrímnismál. Here, Valhöll is only one of the many halls in the realm of the gods. Each godand goddess has a private land and/or hall, carefully listed: Thórr’s hall Bilskírnir in theland Strength-World; Ullr’s land Yew-Dales, Freyr’s land Elf-World, Sunken-Bencheswhere Óðinn drinks with the goddess Sága, Valhöll in World-of-Gladness, Skaði’s hallThrymheimr, Baldr’s land Breiðablik, Heimdallr’s Heaven-Berg, Freyja’s Army-Meadow,"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21Forseti’s Glitnir, Njörðr’s Nóatún, and the thickly vegetated land where Víðarr lives.Indeed, though Valhöll is the most intensively described, it is not even presented as thegreatest hall: Óðinn observes that, “I think that Bilskírnir has five hundred and forty doorsabout it; of those houses which I know to be raftered, I know that the greatest is mykinsman’s.” Separate halls for different deities are also mentioned in other sources: forinstance, Frigg’s dwelling Marsh-Halls appears in stanza 36 of the Eddic poem Völuspá;Snorri mentions the hall Seat-Roomy for Freyja. The godly realm as a whole does not even seem to have been confined to the singleworld Ásgarðr. Many of the halls or the lands in which they lie have the second element -heimr, “world”--for instance, Álfheimr (Elf-World), Thrúðheimr (Strength-World),Gladsheimr (World of Gladness), and Þrymheimr--names implying that the realms theydescribe are separate in the same sense as the more clearly identified Jötunheimr (Etin-World), Vanaheimr (World of the Vanir), Niflheimr (World of Mists), and Muspellheimr.Skaði’s hall is certainly not only outside Ásgarðr, but in the world of the giants, for theverse mentions that she inherited it from her father, the jötunn Thjazi who had previouslyabducted the goddess Iðunn. Supporting this diversity of view, Hákonarmál, which can bedated with reasonable reliability to the latter part of the tenth century and attributed to anapparently staunchly heathen poet, speaks of the “green worlds of the gods”. Besides the worlds of the gods and Hel, the Scandinavian afterlife also offered severalother options. It was not uncommon for the dead to be perceived as dwelling in holymountains, a belief which has persisted among the Saami, and for certain families to havetheir own hill-homes. The dead were also sometimes believed to continue life within theirburial mounds. This view is apparently one which, though it cannot be traced from theStone Age through the Viking Age with unbroken continuity, appears to have been ofconsiderable significance during most of Scandinavia’s past, reappearing at regularintervals from the stone chamber-tombs of the Farming Stone Age to the house-shapedcremation urns of the Bronze Age to the burial customs of the Viking Age and the laterliterature: for instance, in Laxdæla saga, a man named Gestr observes, as a prophecy of theday when he and his friend Ósvífr shall be laid in the same grave, that “it shall be a shorterway between my dwelling-place and Ósvífr’s, and then it will be comfortable for us to talk,if we have leave to talk then”. Even travelling between worlds was apparently an option:the Eddic hero Helgi Hundings-Bane rides back and forth between Valhalla and his burialmound, while Högni Gunnarsson and his friend Skarpheðinn see Högni’s father Gunnarrof Hliðarend resting in his howe with lights burning about him and chanting poetry, butlater when Högni goes to avenge his father, he tells his mother that he is taking Gunnarr’sthrusting-spear “to my father, and he shall have it in Valhöll and bear it at the Weapon-Thing”. The Norse also, apparently, believed in various forms of rebirth. The prose tag to theheroic lay Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar states simply that “Helgi and Sváva were bornagain”: the pair of lovers seem to be reincarnated once as Helgi Hunding’s-Bane andSigrún, of whom it is then said at the close of Helgakviða Hundingsbana II, “That was thebelief in old times, that men were reborn, but now that is called an old wives’ tales. It issaid that Helgi and Sigrún were reborn. He was then called Helgi Haddingjaskaði, and shewas Kára, Hálfdan’s daughter, as it is said in the Song of Kára.” There is also someevidence for rebirth within the family line, often connected with the naming of a child aftera deceased kinsperson or person whom one wishes to honour--a practice which is still alivein modern times. H.R. Ellis cites a number of saga examples for dying persons requestingthat their names be passed on, as, for instance, in Svarfdæla saga, where Karl, expectinghis death in battle, says to his wife Thórgerðr, “I wish, if you bear a son, that you let him benamed after me”. The most eerie and powerful description of rebirth as a significant element in Norsebelief, however, is found in Flateyjarbók. The dead king Óláfr Geirstaðaálfr appears in adream to a man called Hrani, telling Hrani to break into his mound and take his ring, belt,and sword to the pregnant queen. The child who receives these items is also named Óláfr. He later converts to christianity, ultimately becoming St. Óláfr as a reward for his bloodyefforts to convert his countrymen. Nevertheless, to his apparent dismay, the belief that he"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22was the original Óláfr reborn, persisted: when the king was riding by the old mounds, oneof his followers asked, ‘Say to me, lord, if you were buried here’. The king answered him: ‘Never has my spirit had two bodies and never will it have, neither now nor upon the day of Resurrection. And if I said otherwise there would be no right belief in me’. Then the king’s man said, ‘Men have said that when you came to this place before you spoke thus: here was I, and here fare I’. The king answered, ‘I have never said that and I shall never say that’. And the king was much disturbed in his soul and spurred on his horse and fled most swiftly from that stead.” Through all its varying forms, however, the most significant characteristic of theGermanic afterlife is the sense of unity with the family: to die is to join one’s kinfolk, andnot only in the sense of being reunited with the dead, but of continuing to have an effectupon the living. This is not, of course, unique to the Germanic peoples: most societies whohave preserved their native beliefs perceive the dead as continuing to interact with theliving. The belief in the continuity of kinship stands out especially strongly in the Germanicculture, however, because it dominates so many aspects of the afterlife. For instance:rebirth of the soul or separate aspects thereof most commonly takes place within the familyline; Eyrbyggja saga and Landnámabók both mention hills into which certain clans die; andwhen Sigmundr (Siegmund) lies dying on the battlefield, ready to set out on the road toValhöll, he states that, “I must now go to visit my kinfolk who have gone before me”. The unity between dwelling with the dead kin in the afterlife and continuing to guide theliving kin (and the discordance between this belief and that of official christianity--asopposed to folk christianity, which restores the afterlife to the place where dead kin wait fortheir family members) was expressed with a special clarity by King Radbod of Frisia nearthe beginning of the eighth century C.E. On the brink of conversion, (Radbod) still hesitated and he told the bishop to swear by his oath about where the dead kings and princes of the Frisians had their dwelling: in that heavenly kingdom, that he was to get if he would believe and be baptized, or in infernal damnation, about which the bishop spoke very often. To this the man of God answered, “Do not be mistaken, noble prince! By the side of God is the throng of his chosen ones. But your ancestors, the princes of the Frisians, who died without having received the sacrament of baptism, have truly received the sentence of damnation . . . “ As the untrusting duke, who had already stepped up to the font, heard this, he pulled his foot back from the source of grace, and said that he could not get along without the fellowship of all his predecessors, rulers of the Frisians before him, and that he did not want to sit in the celestial kingdom with a little pack of beggars. And, therefore, he could not give the new faith any fealty and he would rather stay with the one to which he, along with the whole of the Frisian race, had held fast.(Vita Vulframmi episcopi Senonici, in Passiones Vitaeque Sanctorum Aevi Merovingici.B. Krusch and W. Levison, eds. Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores RervmMerovingicarvm, 5. Hannover: Bibliopolii Hahniani, 1910), p. 668). It seems that to Radbod, the fellowship of his forebears was not merely something to lookforward to in the afterlife (though clearly he did), but also of great meaning to his livingrulership. The full importance of this connection between the dead and the living--especially in terms of rulership--will be discussed in the next chapter: for now it issufficient to observe that death, to the early Scandinavians, was not a process of separation,but of greater integration with the whole community.3. Grímnismál and the Architecture of Valhalla Between the various halls of the gods, the life in the grave, and the possibility of rebirth,we can see a considerable diversity in the character of the Scandinavian afterlife--a"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23diversity which further begs the question of why Valhalla so captured the imaginations, notonly of the modern era, but of the immediate successors of the Norse religion. Part of the answer, or at least a signpost towards it, may be given by the Eddic poemGrímnismál (“The Words of Grímnir”). In this poem, Óðinn has come in disguise, callinghimself Grímnir (the Masked One) to test a favourite of his, Geirroðr and win an argumentwith his wife Frigg. Frigg, however, has warned Geirroðr to beware of the stranger, andthus Óðinn is seized and hung in chains between two fires for eight nights. On the ninth,Geirroðr’s son Agnarr brings the god a horn of drink. Óðinn then describes the world andhalls of the gods to Agnarr, lingering on Valhöll for several stanzas. The list of halls andattributes ends with a sudden rush of action: after a long recounting of his various by-names, Óðinn reveals himself to Geirroðr with the fateful words--”Now you may seeÓðinn!” Rushing to take his guest from the fire, Geirroðr falls on his sword and dies--seeing Óðinn, in truth, in a manner which may explain why Valhöll is described in suchdetail: not only is it the hall known best to the god, but it is the hall upon which his foster-son will soon have the chance to gaze. The hall is easily recognised by those who come to Óðinn: (spear)shafts are the rafters, the hall is thatched with shields, and the benches are strewn with byrnies. The hall is easily recognised by those who come to Óðinn: a warg (wolf or outlaw) hangs before the western door, and an eagle hovers above . . . Andhrímnir (the cook) lets Sæhrímnir (the boar), best of flesh, be seethed in Eldhrímnir (the cauldron), though few know what the Einherjar feast on. Battle-accustomed, glorious Host- Father (Óðinn) feeds Geri and Freki (his wolves); but weapon-stately Óðinn lives on wine alone. Huginn and Muninn (Óðinn’s ravens) fly over the mighty earth every day; I fear for Huginn, that he not come back, but I look more for Muninn. Thundr roars loudly; Thjóðvitnir’s fish sports in the flood; the river roars loudly, the battle- slain think it too strong to wade. That which stands on the holy fields, before the holy doors, is called Valgrind (Slain-Gate); those gates are old, and few know how they may be locked. Five hundred and forty doors: so I know to be in Valhöll; eight hundred Einherjar go out of one door, when they fare to battle the Wolf. The goat who stands on Host-Father’s hall is called Heiðrún, and bites off the limbs of Læraðr (sometimes thought to be the World-Tree); she shall fill a cauldron with the shining mead, that drink will never be exhausted. The hart who stands on Host- Father’s hall is called Eikthyrnir, and bites off the limbs of Læraðr; and drops fall from his horns into Hvergelmir (the well at the deepest root of the World-Tree), to which all waters wend their way. Shaker and Mist (valkyrie-names) I wish to have bear a horn to me; Skeggjöld and Striker, Shrieker and Battle-Fetter, Loudness and Spear-Striker, Shield-Strength and Rede-Strength and God-Inheritance, they bear ale to the Einherjar. (Grímnismál 9-10, 18-22, 23-26, 36). The age of Grímnismál, like that of most Eddic poems, is not known; however, thedescription of Wotan’s hall as being shingled with shields goes back to the beginning of theninth century, when the first skaldic poet of surviving memory, Bragi the Old, used thekenning “Svölnir’s (Óðinn’s) hall-penny” for a shield. Much of it, especially the long list ofÓðinn’s by-names, appears to be a vehicle for the memorization of the basic lore necessaryto write skaldic poetry, suggesting that much of the material could have been passed downover time. However, the Óðinnic frame story lifts it from the simple ranks of the þulur, orpoetic lists. Instead of a dull recitation of knowledge, Óðinn’s intervention makes the lore avehicle for both Geirroðr’s death beneath his eye and the succession of Agnarr to thekingship, giving the account of the Otherworld and the names which reveal the manyaspects of the god--from “Wished-For” and “Victory-Father” to “Death-Blind”, “Terrible”,and “Slayer”--a peculiarly poignant and powerful quality. Within the lore-list, this juxtaposition of magnificent and terrifying qualities stands outespecially in “Grímnir’s” description of Valhöll. At first, Óðinn’s dwelling seems to showthe best of a noble hall of the Viking Age. The pork is cooking, the mead is endless, womencarry horns of ale about, and the hall is full of strong men ready to defend their lord in"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24battle; the hall’s ruler sits drinking a precious imported drink as he feeds the hounds at hisfeet. However, the hounds are wolves named “Greedy” and “Ravenous”, kin to thedevouring death-hounds who appear throughout the Indo-European world, and in OldNorse poetry there is only one kind of meat that feeds wolves--the flesh of the slain on thebattlefield. Instead of beams, the hall is raftered with spear-shafts, and shingled withshields, and chain-mail strews the benches in place of soft golden straw; instead of hawks,the hall’s lord sends out ravens . . . his loyal warriors are dead men, ghosts doomed toendlessly refight the battles that killed them, and the women who bear them drink are, astheir names describe, the same fierce and bloody spirits who ride out to choose those whoshall fall in fight. The hall itself lies beyond a roaring river: a good defensive fortification,but also one of the most typical signs by which the land of the dead can be known. In short, Valhalla can be seen as a fine and lordly hall, or it can be seen as a stylizationof a battlefield after the fight: covered with broken shields, spears, and byrnies, and peopledwith dead bodies, on whom the wolves and ravens feed and among whom--to a Norse eyelooking through the gray mists of sunset--the dark Choosers of the Slain walk: in fact, it isboth. Thus we can see that the distinction between the bright home of the gods and thedreary halls of Hel is not clear, as the later sources would make it, but rather difficult to sortout. The similarities between Valhalla and Hel become even clearer when the chiefdescriptions of Hel aside from Snorri’s Edda are considered. The Eddic poem Baldrsdraumar speaks of the reception that has been prepared in Hel for Óðinn’s son Baldr: thebenches are strewed with rings, and the seating platform a flood with gold; the mead isbrewed and a shield lies over the shining drink. Likewise, in Eiríksmál, Óðinn (presagingthe coming of Eiríkr Blood-Axe) dreams that he bade the benches to be strewn, the beer-cups cleaned, and the valkyries to bear wine as though a prince were coming. Thegeographies of Valhalla and Hel mirror each other as well: both lie over fierce rivers, bothare guarded by certain gates (Valgrind, “Gates of the Slain”, in Valhalla; Helgrind orNágrind, “Death-Gates” or “Corpse-Gates”, in Hel). The author Saxo Grammaticus, whose Gesta Danorum (“Deeds of the Danes”) is amassive, if often confused, compendium of heroic and godly legends written in ornate(sometimes to the point of illegibility) Latin, also offers interesting material in regards tothe relationship between Valhalla and Hel. In fact, Saxo’s accounts of the Otherworldcombine otherwise separated elements of the halls of the dead: for instance, when his heroThorkillus journeys to the land of the giant Geruthus, Thorkillus is received in a hall whosearchitecture is similar to that of the spear-raftered Valhöll of Grímnismál, but the floor ofwhich is made of snakes, recalling the serpent-woven Underworld hall described inVoluspa 38 and also the description, in the Anglo-Saxon poem Judith, of Hell as the“wyrm-hall”. The hall stinks frightfully, but is filled with rich treasures--a thinly disguisedgrave. Another of Saxo’s heroes, Hadingus, is taken to the Underworld by a strange womanalong a mysterious road. At first she shows him fresh herbs (it is winter on Earth) and saysshe will take him to the land where they grow--a land which may be compared to the ‘greenworlds of the gods” mentioned by the valkyrie Skögul in Hákonarmál 13. She leads himthrough a dark cloud and to a bridge above a river that seethes with weapons; the bridgecould lead either to Valhöll or Hel, but the river of weapons is described as part of theUnderworld in Völuspá 36: A river falls from the east - among poison-dales - of saxes and swords ; Slíðr it is called.After this, they see two armies battling: the woman explains to Hadingus that these arethose who died in battle in life, doomed to fight again every day until the end of the world.They come to a wall, but though the woman tries, she cannot leap over it: she then chopsoff the head of a cockerel and tosses head and body over the wall, whereupon it comes tolife and is heard crowing on the other side. H.R. Ellis compares this to the funeral rites of aRus (Swedish Viking) chieftain along the Volga, in which the slave-girl who was to be"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"25sacrificed to accompany her master to the Otherworld decapitated a cockerel and flung thepieces into the boat in which she and her master were to be burned. The fresh herbs, thebattle, and the resurrection of the cockerel seem to point to the realm of the gods; thecontext, and some of the elements, better describe Hel. It could be argued that Saxo, as a christian writer, could be expected to lump Valhöll(and/or the other godly halls and worlds) and Hel together into a single “infernal” realm: hecannot be taken as a clear authority on Scandinavian afterlife beliefs. However, it can alsobe argued that his inability to tell the difference between the various aspects of the Norseafterlife could have stemmed from a lack of strong distinction in the original beliefs.Thorkillus’ visit to Geruthus is especially interesting: Saxo never identifies that land as theland of the dead, but the pertinent characteristics are there. This suggests that he may haveused the received elements of his story without understanding them, so that he couldinterpret the world of the dead as a world of monsters; but also that the original sourcesmay not have clearly codified the distinctions between the different elements of theafterlife, so that the spear-hall and the snake-hall, the hoard of treasure and the stench of thedead, either could be lumped together with ease or were originally elements of the samegrave.4. Above the Clouds, Beyond the Waters Even the location of Valhalla (and the worlds of the gods in general) is not as clear as itseems at first. Snorri’s imagery is nothing but confusing: he describes the World-Tree ashaving “one root . . . with the gods, and a second with the rime-thurses (frost-giants) . . . butthe third stands over Níflheimr . . . The third root of the ash stands in heaven and under thatroot is a well which is greatly holy, which is called Wyrd’s Well: there the gods have theirdeeming-stead. Every day they ride thence up over Bifröst; that is also called God-Bridge.”Snorri’s difficulty here may have stemmed from his efforts to reconcile received poetictradition with his cosmological ideas: Grímnismál 31 gives a slightly variant form, statingthat: Three roots stand on three ways, beneath the ash Yggdrasil. Hel dwells beneath one, under another, rime-thurses, beneath the third, human men. The dead Helgi Hundingsbane rides through the air in his travels between Valhalla andhis burial mound--over the “wind-helm’s bridge”. To this, Neckel compares particularlythe words of the valkyries in Darraðarljóð, a poem with, according to Njáls saga, aparticularly interesting provenance. Before the Battle of Clontarf (fought between the Norseand Irish in 1016), a man by the name of Dörruðr went out and “saw, that twelve peoplerode together to a certain hut and turned in there together. He went to the hut and lookedinside, and saw that it was women inside and they were weaving. Men’s heads were theweights, and the guts of men for warp and yarn, a sword was for the beater, and an arrowfor the shuttle. Then they spoke a certain verse . . . “ a prophecy of battle, in which thewomen identify themselves as valkyries, which ends with the statement, Bloody clouds sweep through the heaven, the air shall be dyed with the blood of men . . . Let us ride horses hard without saddles, with drawn swords, forth from here.Neckel takes the description of the air being dyed with blood as suggesting that the road ofthe dead leads through the sky. This, thus far, fits with Snorri’s Upper World-MiddleWorld-Underworld division. However, an alternate, and perhaps older and more compelling, image of the geographyof the Otherworld, is offered by a number of other sources: rather than being a heavenly"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26realm, Valhalla is reached by crossing the water. Grímnismál, for instance, tells us that therealm (or realms) of the gods lie beyond the waters: not only is there the great flood Thundrflowing around Valhalla, but there are also the rivers which the gods ride the fiery God-Bridge over to reach their deeming-stead by Yggdrasil (and which Thórr must wade). Inanother Eddic poem, Hárbarðsljóð, Thórr is coming home from Jötunheimr and must crossa river that is too great for him to ford in his usual fashion at that spot: the poem consists ofhis dialogue with Óðinn, who has disguised himself as the ferryman. The waters that lie between life and death appear in the spiritual realities of more folkthan the Norse. The best-known river of the dead is the Greek Styx, with its old ferrymanCharon; the Celts believed that one means of reaching the Otherworld was by sailing westover the ocean or crossing a lake. Outside of the Indo-European sphere, H.R. Ellis alsocites the sending of corpses out in funerary ships from as far afield as North Borneo andPolynesia, observing that in both cases, “we have evidence for the belief in a journey to theland of the dead, reached in the first case along a river, and in the second across the sea”. In American folk christianity, “crossing the Jordan” or “crossing the river” is equivalent togoing to Heaven, as seen, for instance, in a number of folk hymns, as described by GeorgePulla Jackson in his analysis of white spirituals. “Now the wayworn pilgrim stands onJordan’s banks . . . He may travel by air as the prophet did, in a chariot. But the usualmeans of transportation is the boat or ship.” The trend may be easily seen in a fewexamples such as “Poor Wayfaring Stranger”, I’m going to meet my mother, She said she’d be there when I come, I’m just going over Jordan, I’m just coming over home,the Appalachian hymn, “The Good Old Way” (“Come sail with me, all Christ’s goodfriends . . . We’ll gather there on the further shore to meet with our kin who have gonebefore”), and a couplet which appears in variant forms in, for instance, “Swing Low, SweetChariot” and “Michael, Row The Boat Ashore”: The river is deep and the river is wide (Coming for to carry me home), There’s milk and honey on the other side (Coming for to carry me home).Interestingly, the former of these has been adapted by followers of Wotan today, with verylittle damage to either the concept or the cosmology, as “Swing Low, Sweet ValkyrieMaiden”, and includes the Grímnismál-inspired verse, The river roars loud and the river is wide, (Coming for to carry me home) There’s mead and fighting on the other side (Coming for to carry me home). (Anonymous: overheard at the house of Wotan-priestess Freya Aswynn, Aug. 25, 1995).The same image of crossing the water to the blessed land is found in the belief of AmericanWiccans, as shown, for instance, in the song “Set Sail” in Starhawk’s Spiral DanceSamhain ritual. “Set sail, set sail . . . over the waves, into the night . . . follow the twilight tothe West, where you may rest.” A number of traditional folksongs throughout Northern Europe also preserve the passageover water to the Otherworld, whether by crossing a bridge or other means. The Englishsong “Lykewake Dirge” includes the verse, From Whinny-muir when thou mayst pass, Every night and alle;"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"27 To Brig o’ Dread thou comest at last, And Christ receive thy saule. (William Dallam Armes, ed. Old English Ballads and Folk Songs. New York: theMacmillan Company, 1910, p. 56). In travelling to Elfland, Thomas the Rhymer and his guide have to ford rivers: O they rade on, and farther on, And they waded through rivers aboon the knee, And they saw neither sun nor moon, But they heard the roaring of the sea (Armes, Old English Ballads and Folk Songs, p. 48). Similarly, the C version of the Swedish ballad “Sorgens Makt” has the dead lover leadinghis beloved over a bridge into a cemetery: And they went all over a bridge, And the young man he wept, and the maiden she laughed. (Bengt R. Jonsson, ed. Sveriges Medeltida Ballader, vol. 1. Stockholm: Almqvist &Wiksell, 1983, p. 436). The folk-belief that the undead cannot cross running water may also be related to thisoriginal geography of the Otherworld: the earthly running water may stand for the waterthat parts the world of the dead from the world of the living, which is not easily passed. Death is, of course, the final journey into the unknown--and understanding it as avoyage into uncharted waters must have rung especially true for a sailing people, who,whenever they put forth from shore, could hope to make land again, but never be sure of it.The link between voyaging and death in the minds of the Norse is expressed clearly by theold warrior Flosi at the end of Njáls saga: “Men say that this was Flosi’s end: that he faredout, when he had become old, to seek out house-timbers, and he was in Norway that winter.And that summer he stayed on late. Men advised him that his ship was not seaworthy. Flosisaid that it was good enough for an old and death-doomed man, and got on the ship and leftthe harbour, and nothing was heard of this ship afterwards.” Whether the scene distantlyechoes a memory of funerary ships set adrift, reflects a belief in the land of the dead lyingacross the sea, or relates to other religious and/or literary traditions (such as, for instance,the theme of the old in heathen times voluntarily committing suicide?), the Icelanders whoheard it--perhaps thinking of the day when the planks of their own boats might split to letthe cold waters in--must have felt a shudder of icy awe at Flosi’s open-eyed choice to setsail into the darkness. The prose description of the death of Sinfjötli, the eldest son of Sigmundr (Wagner’sSiegmund), presents an especially poignant view of the way over the waters to Valhalla andÓðinn’s role as death-god. Sigmundr’s pride has led him to foolishly advise his son to drinka poisoned drink rather than show fear, whereupon “Sinfjötli drank and was thereupondead”. Sigmundr lifts his son’s warm body in his arms and “bore him a long way in hisembrace, and came to a firth both wide and long, and there was a little boat and a man in it.He offered Sigmundr passage over the firth. But when Sigmundr carried the corpse out tothe ship, then the boat was fully-loaded. The man said that Sigmundr should go around thefirth. The man pushed the boat off and was gone from there.” The ferryman is, of course,Wotan (whose by-names Farmaguð and Farmatýr, both meaning “Cargo-God”, may wellrefer to him as the ferryman of the dead); the next time Sinfjötli was heard from, he wasdwelling in Valhalla as an honoured hero, bidden by Óðinn to give greetings to the recentlyslain Eiríkr Blood-Axe. But it was not only heroes of legend that followed the way over the water to Valhalla.Although that most pervasive image of a burial in barbarian splendour--a burning ship setadrift on the sea--is actually rare in literature, appearing most notably in the description ofthe funeral of Óðinn’s son Baldr, various sorts of boat-burial are found in the Norththrough different periods. The first of these on the Swedish island Gotland from the late"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28Bronze Age to the early Iron Age: it was usual for the early Gotlanders to place uprightstones in the outline of a ship around the remains of both cremated and inhumed dead.Although no connection can be demonstrated between the Gotlandic burials and thosewhich followed them several hundred years later, from about 500 C.E. onwards, boat-burial suddenly became an important part of funeral ritual throughout much of Scandinavia.This period is often called the Vendel Age because of the multiple ship-burials fromVendel, Sweden, the forms of which stand as a clear signpost to the Otherworld. The dead Vendel chieftain would be dressed in full war-gear, a shirt of chainmail drapedover his cold shoulders and a sword girded at his side; the helm on his head was wrought asa mask to terrify his foes, its dome plated with images of heroes and mighty beings aidingmen in battle. Those who buried him dragged his ship up onto the land; they led his horses--perhaps walking calmly, perhaps stamping and tossing their heads at the scent of death--tothe boat, slaughtering them there and laying them on the starboard side with heads to theprow. Horses and hounds and hawks; the weapons of a man, spear and shield and sword;and more than that: the dead man was given cauldrons and cooking utensils and, in onegrave, a joint of beef and a ham, for he would need to eat where he was going. As for thechieftain himself, as his armour and weapons suggest, he was not laid peacefully to sleep.In the two graves where human remains survived, both men were seated upright, one in achair, one in the stern of the ship with his steed beside him--gazing out over the dark waterswhere he was to sail, one might say. One of the more vexing questions in dealing with horse- and boat-burials is always thatof knowing whether the means of transport was meant to be used in getting the dead personto his or her destination in the Otherworld, or was simply something that would be neededin the next life, as in this. However, the Vendel burials may be contrasted in this respect tothe later (Viking Age) Norwegian ship-burials in Oseberg, Gokstad, and Tuna. All three ofthe latter have special burial chambers, that in the Oseberg ship even including a bed; theOseberg ship was, indeed, carefully moored to a large rock to keep it from sailinganywhere. The implication here is not that the ship itself was the means of the voyage to theOtherworld, but that the dead chieftain (or queen, in the Oseberg burial) would desire his orher ship in the hereafter for the same uses as it found in earthly life, just as the Osebergqueen also wanted her sledge, her wagon, her tapestries, her servant, and her servant’scooking implements. The Viking Age, however, did not lose the image of the voyage over the waters. As wellas the literary sources mentioned above, one of the most common images on the Gotlandicpicture stones is that of a ship crossing the waves. These picture stones are generallythought to have been chiefly set up between 700-800 C.E., and were probablycommemorative of the dead. One of the oldest ones shows a rider and has the simple runicinscription, “Frawawardar was slain on horseback”; some of the later ones include runicinscriptions such as “God help Rodfos’ soul! God betray those, who betrayed him” -- theHeathen concept of a runestone’s curse on the foe surviving into the christian era. Theirstyle is simple, but imaginative, mixing scenes from battle with scenes of heroic and godlylegends. The most common focus, however, is what appears to be violent death and thefallen man’s good reception in the afterlife, perhaps, as Sune Lindqvist suggests, combinedwith exhortations to revenge embodied by the illustrations of legends in which revengeplays such a significant part (for instance, Völundr/Wayland’s smithy is shown with thedecapitated bodies of the sons of the king who had the smith hamstrung, while revenge isalso one of the chief motivators throughout the Völsung/Nibelung legends). The association between the ship and the way to Valhalla is clearest on the Tjängvide Istone. The lower half of the stone is occupied by a ship in full sail; the upper part shows abattlefield with a spear passing over a dead man; a man riding to a hall on an eight-leggedhorse, greeted by a woman with a horn of drink; and warriors fighting outside the hall, witha dog or wolf below them. The combination of the ship and the rider seated on Wotan’seight-legged horse has led to the suggestion that, especially on the island of Gotland, theroad to Valhalla was seen as comprising, first a sea-faring, then a journey by horse from thecoast to the god’s hall. As according to human custom of the time, the arriving guest wasespecially honoured by having the lord’s horse sent to fetch him at the shore. Other"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"29versions of the ship/reception by a woman with a horn of drink motif are Lillbjärs III, ArdreVIII, Halla Broa IV, and Klinte Hunninge I, among others. These stones, particularly ArdreVIII and Tjängvide I, present the strongest argument for seeing the ship as intrinsically partof the journey to the Otherworld rather than an artistic motif, reference to an heroic legendinvolving sailing, or other such options: as the other frames seem to be telling a story with aspecific memorial/Otherworldly reference, it is not unreasonable to take the ship as part ofthe same procedure that leads from the battlefield to Valhalla. Of the picture stones which seem to detail the process of battle, perhaps the mostfascinating is Lärbro St. Hammars I, which shows several scenes of battle, including onefight between the crew of a landing ship and a party of warriors headed by a woman with atorch on-shore. The thing that makes this stone unusual, however, is that the aftermath ofthe battle includes the sacrifice of the defeated prisoners in the typical Óðinnic manner:hanging and spearing. This takes place beneath an emblem of three interlocked triangles--asign which appears on other stones such as Lillbjärs III and Lärbro Tängelgårda I to markthe central rider. Though we do not know if the Norse had a name for the sign itself, it hassurvived as a Norwegian textile design called the valknut--knot of the slain--and is ofteninterpreted as the mark of Wotan, especially in the context of heroic death. If thisinterpretation is accurate, then, for instance, Lillbjärs III, which has only the ship, the rider,and the woman in common with the more explicit “Sleipnir” stones (Tjängvide I, ArdreVIII), could be clearly labelled as showing the dead man’s welcome in Wotan’s hall, andstrongly intimate that these images were specifically intended to chart the pathway toValhalla. Lastly, Saxo gives us a description of the road to Wotan’s hall which covers both waterand air. When “Othinus” takes his fosterling Haddingus to his own home, he lifts the youngman up onto his steed, then covers Haddingus’ eyes with his cloak, telling him not to lookdown. Haddingus does anyway, and sees the ocean far beneath the horse’s hooves. “To rideover air and water” is something of a stock phrase in describing supernatural transportabilities: Freyr’s boar, and the women of the Helgi poems, for instance. But one may easilyimagine that if Valhalla lies beyond the waters, then it may be reached either by ship--or byriding over the “wind-helm’s bridge”, as the dead and those who lead them between theworlds may do.5. Wotan’s Children: Valkyries and Einherjar (Siegmund is keeping watch over his sister Sieglinde, who has collapsed at the end of their wild flight from Hunding’s house. The valkyrie Brünnhilde appears and speaks tohim) (Brünnhilde): Siegmund! Look at me! I am the one, whom you shall soon follow. (Siegmund): Who are you there, that appears so fair and grave? (Brünnhilde): Only those hallowed to death meet my gaze--who gazes on me must part from life’s light. On the battlefield alone I appear to the noble ones: he who sees me, I choose as the slain! (Siegmund) He who follows you--where do you lead the hero? (Brünnhilde) To Walhall, where the one that chose you waits--to Walhall you shallfollow me. (Siegmund) In Walhall’s hall, will I find the Father of the Slain alone? (Brünnhilde) The blessed host of fallen heroes will embrace you with high and holy greetings. (Siegmund) Shall I find Wälse, my own father, there? (Brünnhilde) The Wälsung shall find his father there. (Siegmund) Shall a woman greet me joyously there? (Brünnhilde): Wish-maidens rule there--Wotan’s daughter will truly bring you drink. (Siegmund): You are fair, and I recognise Wotan’s child as holy . . .(Wagner, Richard. Die Walküre. Mainz: B. Schott’s Söhne, 1899. Act II, scene iv. pp.153-157). Despite Richard Wagner’s best efforts to capture the terrifying beauty of Wotan’s"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30daughters, the valkyries of Norse belief have experienced a not entirely complimentaryrevival in modern culture. As a seemingly infinite number of caricatures suggest, the word“valkyrie”, especially in the Wagnerian context, immediately summons an image of a fatwoman with long blond braids trailing from under a preposterously winged helmet as shelets out glass-breaking soprano screeches. This image is played upon devastatingly byEnglish fantasy-humourist Terry Pratchett: “Even shorn of her layers of protective clothing,Lady Sybil Ramkin was still toweringly big. Vimes knew that the barbarian hublander folkhad legends about great chain-mailed, armour-bra’d, carthorse-riding maidens whoswooped down on battlefields and carried off dead warriors on their cropper to a glorious,roistering afterlife. Lady Ramkin could have been one of them.” While the shrieking and howling may have been characteristic of the valkyries the earlyGermanic people believed in, as suggested by the name Göll (Screamer), the other aspectsare not. The word “valkyrie” means “Chooser of the Slain”, and also appears as the OldEnglish wælcyrge, suggesting that these beings were known both to the Norse and theAnglo-Saxons. There are two obvious interpretations for the title “Chooser of the Slain”:one, that the valkyries choose who shall die in battle, or two, they choose who, out of theslain, shall be brought to Valhalla. Both seem to fit the functions of the valkyries asdescribed in Norse literature: for instance, Hákonarmál begins before Hákon’s last battle,with the words, Gauta-Týr sent Göndul and Skögul (two valkyries) to choose among kings, who, of Yngvi’s clan, should fare with Óðinn and be in Valhöll.The use of the term “to choose the slain” appears in various ways in other context. InGrímnismál 14, it is explained how Freyja chooses half the slain every day for her own hall,while Óðinn owns the other half--in this case, picking over the dead is the most probableinterpretation. In Vafþrúðnismál 41, the expression is used for the daily activities of theeinherjar, and seems to be a poetic phrase for “to slay”. In regards to the valkyries,however, they seem to perform the double function of arranging battles (apparently atWotan’s will) so that the correct people will live and die, and of identifying Wotan’s ownamong the dead on the battlefield. The process of identifying the valkyries is, however, complicated by the confusionbetween the human, or demihuman, women described as “valkyries” in the prose of theheroic poems (the swan-maidens who marry the smith Völundr/Wayland and his brothers,and the thrice-reborn woman who accompanies the three Helgis) and the use of the word inthe skaldic and mythological poems exclusively to describe Óðinn’s battle-spirits. Thelatter are exclusively Óðinnic: several of their names, indeed, are feminine versions of hisown by-names, and one of his by-names is Valkjósandi, the masculine form of “valkyrie”.Wotan’s maidens have no romantic interest: the earliest Norse use of the word “valkyrie”,in the skaldic poem Hrafnsmál (ca. 900 C.E.), tells us that I thought the valkyrie to be wise, men were never beloved by the keen-eyed one.The tragedy of the valkyrie Sigrdrífa, better known as Wagner’s Brünnhilde, of course, isthat she is punished for disobeying Wotan by being stripped of her position as a valkyrieand, as a final seal to her loss of that place, she is forced to fall in love and marry, asdescribed in the prose of Sigrdrífumál: “Óðinn stuck her with a sleep-thorn in revenge forthis and said that she should never again deal out victory in battle and said that she must bemarried. ‘But I said to him, that I swore an oath in answer to this that I should never bemarried to a man who was able to be afraid.” In contrast to this, the “valkyrie-brides” of the Eddic prose are all romantically involved:for instance, the Helgi-woman’s romantic relationship with her hero, whom she guides and"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31magically protects, is the center of her existence. Nor does she actually choose death for herhero: rather she is unaware of his approaching doom and bewails it piteously afterwards.Finally, she has neither a connection with Óðinn of any sort nor access to Valhalla: Sigrúncannot follow her dead husband over the “wind-helm’s bridge”, but must sit beside hismound, hoping that he may ride back to her. In short, since the word “valkyrie” is neverused for these women in the poetry, but only in the explanatory prose given by the latethirteenth-century scribe, it can probably be safely taken that the original form of the Norsevalkyrie was that seen in the skaldic and mythological poems--the fierce, chaste worker ofWotan’s will. The scribe’s confusion is likely to have stemmed from the way in which theHelgi-women, in particular, were able to ride as spirits over air and water to magicallyprotect their beloved in battle, assisted by the image of the host of women riding from amountain among streaks of lightning, with blood-sprinkled byrnies and flashing spearsgiven in Helgakviða Hundingsbana I, 15. When the “valkyrie-brides” (a term in itself impossibly contradictory) are put aside, webegin to get a clearer picture of Wotan’s maidens. They are often associated with ravens inNorse poetry: Hrafnsmál consists entirely of a valkyrie interrogating a raven about thedeeds of the king Haraldr Hairfair (who, according to a rather late and garbled reworking ofthe Grímnismál tale in Flateyjarbók, was a guest/fosterling of Óðinn in his childhood) --aninterrogation which begins with the promising words, How is it with you, raven? From whence have you come with bloody beak so early in the day? Bits of meat hang from your claws, the stench of carrion comes from your mouth I think you spent the night near where you knew the dead to lie.In kennings, ravens are usually described as belonging either to Wotan or to valkyries: theyare Óðinn’s hawks and the swans of the Hanged One or of Yggr; the hawks of Gunnr,Hlökk, and Hildr, and so forth. The Anglo-Saxon poem Exodus also describes ravens aswælceasiga--they, too, pick over the dead on the battlefield as the valkyries do. In regardsto this, Tolkien’s suggestion that the “valkyrie”-word “derived partly from the actualcarrion-birds of battle, transformed in mythological imagination”, is an attractive theory--the more so when the valkyries are compared to Celtic raven-goddesses of battle such as theMorrigan--but difficult, if not impossible, to prove. However, a relationship in image aswell as function is certainly present both in Exodus and in the Norse sources regardingravens and valkyries: both are seen as dark creatures that delight in the blood and carrion ofthe battlefield, who can foretell the turnings of war, and who take their share from the fieldwhen the slaughter is over. In human life, therefore, valkyries are figures of terror, as characterized by their bloodyweaving in Darraðarljóð, their close relationship to the carrion-birds of battle, and theirvery nature as Choosers of the Slain, handmaidens of the god of battle-death. LikeBrünnhilde in her first appearance to Siegmund, they may be stately, riding above the fieldhorsed and in full armour with their spears in their hands, but they are pitiless deemers ofdeath: the best comfort they can give is shown by Skögul’s words to the newly slain Hákon,when he asks if he did not deserve better from the gods, “We ruled it thus: that you held thefield, and your foes fled” (Hákonarmál 12). In Valhalla, however, they play a differentrole, welcoming those whom Wotan seeks to honour with horns of drink. With thesefigures, as much as any, we see the transformation of the gory battlefield into the lordlyhall. Where queens and noblewomen would bear the mead about at earthly feasts, speaking,as the queen Wealtheow does in Beowulf, words of welcome and wisdom, the only womenwho frequent the bloody field of the slain are Wotan’s wish-daughters, transmuted from theshrieking ghosts who ride over the slaughter and choose the deaths of those below into thestately greeters of the honoured guests. Those guests themselves, the einherjar, or Single-Champions, comprise a wider range"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32than simply men fallen in battle. Loki uses the title “einheri” mockingly when speaking ofThórr (Lokasenna 60); and in Grímnismál 51, Óðinn speaks of the einherjar as though theywere of godly rank: Geirroðr has won the enmity of all the einherjar together with Óðinn,just as the dísir (family goddesses) are angry with him (53). As mentioned earlier, Sinfjötliis one of the heroes in Valhalla, even though he was poisoned rather than dying in fight: inhis case, the deciding factors may have included his deeds, his lineage, or the high regard inwhich he was held after his death--here, it must be remembered that while modern folkmight consider Sinfjötli, like Sigmundr, Sigurðr (Siegfried), and the rest of the characters inthe saga, a pure fiction, or at best loosely based on a dim memory of a Migration Ageprince, the Norse believed him to have been an historical figure, and the accounts of legendgenerally accurate. In short, it is clear that to be one of the einherjar means something particular and specialbeyond simply having died in battle. What exactly it may have implied will be discussedfurther in the next chapter, when I look at the poems describing the respective receptions ofEiríkr Blood-Axe and Hákon the Good into Valhalla, among the ranks of the einherjar. Fornow it will be sufficient to look at their condition and activities in Wotan’s hall. Like everything else in Valhalla, the einherjar appear in two ways. First is the horde offallen warriors who live on bloody, with shattered byrnies, under a roof of shields andspears--the dead men on the battlefield, who rise each day to do battle again (this imagereceived a rather peculiar revival in the film “Erik the Viking”, near the end of which allthose who have died in the course of the film appear with their wounds shown in full andgruesome detail, but observe grimly that they are the lucky ones). Secondly, we see theranks of princes, dwelling in honour and happiness within Wotan’s lordly hall. Accordingto Gustav Neckel, the first group are the ghosts of the dead, for whom Valhalla isinseparable from the half-life within the burial mound; the second are heroes raised to therank of half-gods. Hákon, who comes to Valhöll covered with blood and mistrustful ofÓðinn, shows one aspect of the einherjar; Eiríkr Blood-Axe, arriving in glory as a king withfive kings behind him, can be seen as showing the second. And yet, like the other aspects of Valhalla, the two forms of the einherjar cannot easilybe separated from each other. Eiríkr’s condition is not actually described in Eiríksmál, sothat one could as easily see how, as Lee Hollander put it, “Eric draws nigh-- . . . we mayfill out the picture after Hákonarmál--bleeding from deep wounds and pale unto death”, asfollow Neckel’s vision of the king in glory and good health. The use of the word heill(healthy/blessed) in welcoming Hákon into Valhalla, on the other hand, suggests--whetherit is meant literally or simply as a greeting, carries the idea that Hákon is being welcomedto health and happiness after his bloody death, perhaps even as the einherjar who fight allday are healed again for their feasting every evening.6. The Everlasting Battle The Everlasting Battle is best known to us as the characteristic daily activity of theeinherjar in Valhalla, but is by no means limited to that hall. The best-known version, andthe oldest, is the story of Högni, Hildr, and Heðinn. Briefly told: Högni’s daughter Hildrruns off with Heðinn; Högni and his men pursue them, meeting on the island Hoy (one ofthe Orkneys). Under the guise of trying to reconcile the two men, Hildr inflames themfurther to battle. At the end of the day, both sides are dead; Hildr then magically bringsthem back to life so that they will do battle again. According to Snorri, it is said that theywill continue this until Ragnarök. The later and more corrupt version in Sörla þáttr adds thefigure of the valkyrie Göndul (perhaps Freyja in disguise) as the wakener of the dead,putting the ultimate blame for the conflict on Freyja and Óðinn and ending the battle withthe intervention of one of Óláfr Tryggvason’s christian followers; but Snorri’s version ofthe story accords better with that of the skald Bragi, which, being composed in the earlyninth century, cannot be taken as either degenerate or garbled in the way that post-conversion accounts of the legend might be. Bragi leaves out the awakening of the dead,but his description of Hildr as “the goddess who heals bloody wounds”, and “witch amongwomen”, suggest that he knew the story. Interestingly, the scene from the legendary battleBragi is describing is actually shown on an elaborate shield which he is praising: thus,"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"33when he tells us that “This battle may be seen on Svölnir’s (Óðinn’s) hall-penny”, he issetting it within an Óðinnic framework--literally, under the very shingles of Óðinn’s roof. However, it appears in other contexts as well. In Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar, a man by thename of Thórsteinn Uxafótr dreams that he is led into a burial mound and witnesses a battlebetween two companies, one red-clothed and fair of appearance, one ugly and dressed inblue-black. The blows given by the fighters to each other heal almost as swiftly as they aregiven; only the blows Thórsteinn deal, presumably because he is a living man, have alasting effect. A similar folktale “Sundered Today, Whole Tomorrow”, was collected in Sweden in1943 from an informant born in 1873: There was a man, who asked for lodging in a house on a Holy Thursday or Easter night. That night the old woman of the house took something out of a horn and smearedherself, and so she climbed up on the stove and sat herself on a broom and said, “Here up and here out and off to Snake Farm!” So she went up through the chimney, and so he thought he would follow after. He tookhis walking stick and would ride upon it. “Here up and here down,” he said, but thencame the old woman’s maid and taught him what he should say, and so it bore him awayto Blåkulla. There the old women were enjoying themselves and struck at each other and said, “Sundered today and whole tomorrow.” But then he said, “Sundered today andsundered tomorrow and sundered for all eternity.” And when the old women came homethey were all wounded, and that could never be healed.(Svenska Folksägner. Bengt af Klintberg, ed. Stockholm: Norstedts Forlag 1972, pp.227-28). Whether or not the story reflects a degenerate form of the Valhalla belief, it certainly stemsfrom the Eternal Battle motif--complete with the outside intervention--and is altered only inthat the participants are witches rather than dead men. However, Jacqueline Simpsoninterprets “Snake Farm” as the christian Hell, “since Satan can take on the form of aserpent”, while snakes are one of the elements in the Germanic realm of the dead, asmentioned above--their presence in a stylized depiction of the grave being obvious; so thatthe image of a host of battling dead is not obscured by the later Swedish witch-folklore. The Högni and Hildr story was also known in North Germany, but its German rendition,the epic poem Kudrun, while retaining the motif of battle and healing, tones the magico-religious elements down in typical mediæval German form. Just as Nibelungenliedmarginalizes Siegfried’s dragon-slaying, downplays the magical elements of Günther’swooing, and diminishes Brünnhilde from a disgraced, but still awe-inspiring, valkyrie to aburlesque Amazon, so Kudrun stops the fight before the deaths of the chief participants,and takes great care to normalize the healing. Instead of being done by the young womanwho instigated the fight, the healing is done by the older man Wate, who learnt the art“from a wild woman”. It is mentioned that he could almost raise the dead (verse 542), buthe is specifically stated to use natural means (530), and there are still a great many slain lefton the field when he is done (545). The motif of the Everlasting Battle itself also exists inCeltic stories such as Culhwch and Olwen and The Death of Muircertach Mac Erca, whilesimilar ghostly battles took place in Marathon, as described by Pausanius in GraeciaeDescripto and after a fight between Romans and Scythians, as told about in Vita Isidori. Nevertheless, although the Everlasting Battle is not exclusive to the north, its associationwith a deity is, and in particular, its attribution to his hall. The situation in Valhalla isdifferent than that in most of the other versions of the story: the hosts of Heðinn and Högni,for instance, do not sit down to feast together after a hard day’s fight. In Grímnismál, thefeasting of the einherjar is shown as central to the Valhalla experience; in Vafþrúðnismál,the daily reconciliation of the heroes is as important an identifying characteristic ofValhalla as is their endless fighting. This seems to accord with the welcome and, perhaps,"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34healing of Hákon: the einherjar experience their deaths--but also recovery, and feastingafterwards, every day. The reconciliation of the einherjar is part of the perception ofValhalla as a pleasant godly hall: even the ferocious valkyries appear, in this context, as thebearers of the drink representing welcome and fellowship. However, the characteristics which would have led to the Everlasting Battle becomingpart of the Óðinnic afterlife are both early and well-documented: most particularly, Wotan’sreception of the battle-dead, which would make him the obvious figure to associate withtheir continued combat, but also his delight in the battles of men. The practice of buryingweapons and war-horses with the dead also suggests that they were expected to need thesethings in the afterlife--that the burial-weapons were not only adornments, but tools thatwould serve for battles in the world beyond. This idea is, naturally, not unique to theGermanic peoples, nor even the Indo-Europeans; nor does it necessarily mean that all menburied with battle-gear are einherjar, even in Viking Age Scandinavia. The generalevidence of grave-goods, as well as the descriptions which make it clear that the halls of thegods were very similar to the halls of their worshippers, seem to imply that life within themound, or in the god-worlds, was expected to go on as usual, including eating, drinking,riding--and, of course, fighting. Nevertheless, if an afterlife which includes fighting is notquite the same as the Everlasting Battle, the road from the former to the latter is not too far;and when the beliefs that led to the burial of weapons are combined with the name “Hall ofthe Slain” and the emphasis on Valhalla as a warrior’s afterlife (if not necessarily limited tothose who died fighting), the appearance of a slightly modified form of the EverlastingBattle motif as an integral part of Valhalla seems not only natural, but inevitable. Life leadsinto death, and we can expect death to reflect life in its chief particulars, if changed in thoseodd ways that are often encountered in the Otherworld.

For instance: in aDanish cemetery with 240 adult skeletons, 100 were in the 20-35 age group, while 140were in the general range of 35-55, with only two of those demonstrably having passed 55.It would have been difficult, if not indeed impossible, for a child in this period to grow toadulthood without experiencing the death of a family member or close friend, which ismuch likelier to be the norm in modern Western society. Stephen King--a novelist whosepopularity is at least partially due to his close investigation and accurate rendition ofmodern American society and behavior--makes a very similar observation in Pet Sematary:his protagonist’s best friend, Jud, who is in his eighties, comments to the much younger(mid-thirties) doctor, “Well, we come from a different time . . . We was on closer terms with death. We saw the flu epidemic after the Great War, and mothers dying with child, and children dying of infection and fevers that it seems like doctors just wave a magic wand over these days . . . We knew it as a friend and as an enemy . . . In those days you didn’t need to take a course in college to study death, hot-spice, or whatever they call it. In those days it came into the house and said howdy and sometimes it took supper with you and sometimes you could feel it bite your ass.” As it was in old Jud’s day, so it was--and even more so--for the folk of the Viking Age.Each and every early Scandinavian, like anyone in an agricultural world, had ampleopportunity to see for him- or herself that “Cattle die”--of course they must: hopefullybutchered as the winter’s supply of meat, or by starvation, freezing, or accident in worsetimes. Likewise, they all knew that “kinsmen die”: everyone had lost a few kinsmen--andquite possibly helped to wash the bodies, lay them out, and dig the graves--and expected tolose more. From there, it was only a short step to the inevitable conclusion, “You yourselfshall die”. Keeping this in mind may have raised the degree of awareness of thesupernatural--folk watched for omens, interpreted dreams, and waited for the sureknowledge of being fey (the psychic recognition that death is about to be upon one)--butalso made it easier to live life a little more securely, having resolved that what could not beavoided could be met with a strong heart, and being aware that the territories beyond werenot uncharted, but rather could be known and trusted. This firm belief in the necessary andduly timed death survived in Icelandic communities as far away as Canada, as seen in theIcelandic-Canadian proverb, “Ekki verður feigum forðað né ófeigum í hel komið”--the feycannot be saved, nor the un-fey forced into the land of death. In contrast, although images of violent death are frequently presented by the media today,the context is that of something unexpected and shocking--and, unfortunately, evensensational. The element of personal contact, either in regards to a personal connection withthe deceased or a strong reason to identify with them, is usually lacking: in fact, the contextin which the media present newsworthy disasters, all of which are by definition unusualevents and most of which take place in foreign countries, tends to intensify rather thanlessen the sense of the watcher’s detachment from the concept of death by violence. Thedegree of this detachment becomes especially clear when an event does break through thebarrier of the media: in such cases, most Westerners have no preparation for dealing withtragic disaster affecting people who could be themselves--let alone people they mightknow. The Oklahoma bombing, for instance, was a trauma almost beyond Americancomprehension, whose overwhelming emotional repercussions are still going on, precisely"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"37because it was one of the few such events in modern history in which ordinary Americans,going about their business in their quiet hometown, were slaughtered (and, moreover, bythe hands of compatriots). Still, death from right-wing or terrorist bombs is not yet afrequent occurrence in America: the response of shock to an unusual catastrophic event isvery different from the personal understanding of the inevitability of death. Thediscrepancy between the presentation of unusual death and the experience of ordinary deathwas brought out by an American study done in 1971, which found that a child in the USwould, by the age of 14, probably have seen an average of eighteen thousand killings ontelevision, whereas, “the average American will reach the age of 40 before encountering adeath of someone close to them.” The AIDS epidemic and the rising level of crime inAmerica have probably lowered the latter figure somewhat; but that the former figure hasgone down is, to say the least, unlikely. The comparative rarity of personal experience of death in our times, combined with thestrong social emphasis on avoiding thinking about or actively denying the inevitability of anatural death at all costs--particularly the perception of death-denying euphemisms such as“passed away”, “at rest”, and so forth as being more appropriate and tactful in the contextof a funeral than “died” and “dead”--is one of the contributing factors in making death moredifficult to deal with when it occurs. Part of the immense trauma caused by the AIDSepidemic is that it came as a betrayal of modern expectations of lifespan (and its twin, ourfaith in modern medicine). The painful gap between expectation and reality appears especially clearly when gaywritings from the late seventies are compared with those a decade later, as in the Tales ofthe City series. In the second book, More Tales of the City (originally published as a serialin the late seventies) Archibald Gidde and a friend are discussing, semi-seriously, plans fora gay old folk’s home, in the confident expectation that, “‘There are - and this isconservatively speaking - one hundred and twenty thousand practicing homosexuals withinthe city limits of San Francisco . . . Those one hundred and twenty thousand homosexualsare going to grow old together, Arch. Some of them may go back to Kansas or wherever thehell they ran away from, but most of them are gonna stay right here in Shangri-la, cruisingeach other until it’s pacemaker time.” Gidde’s death is reported in the sixth book, Sure ofYou, no more than ten years later, after he has already outlived many of his friends andcontemporaries. Even in his obituary, the attempt to deny Gidde’s role as a victim in acontinuing crisis goes on: he is reported as having died of liver cancer, to which gay activistThack responds with appropriate scorn. “‘Liver cancer . . . How tired is that? . . . He was aworm in life, and he’s a worm in death.’” The general denial of death as a physical reality in modern Western society iscomplemented by the spiritual denial of death which has been the mainstay of christianityvirtually since its foundation. The rhetoric of Jesus of Nazareth--“He that believeth in meshall not die, but have everlasting life”, supported by the Resurrection myth and thewritings of the Apostle Paul, led to very specific doctrines presenting death as a temporaryinconvenience (at least for the virtuous), emphasizing Christ’s triumph over death, “Odeath, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?” and promising resurrection in theoriginal flesh for the faithful (a doctrine leading to much concern among, for instance,literal-minded Victorians, who took great precautions to protect their deceased from illegalexhumation and dissection lest the unfortunate victims find themselves missing importantorgans on the happy day). Even the aspects of earlier christianity which seem, to the modern eye, to dwell on deathto the point of being offensive to current sensibilities --for instance, the memento moriimagery of the late Middle Ages, which included such images as graphic depictions of burstabdominal cavities with maggots crawling about in them--differ strikingly from theconceptions of death normally maintained by traditional peoples. The christian mementomori was not meant to recognise death or honour its importance as both a physical andspiritual phenomenon; it was meant to demonstrate, in the strongest terms possible, theweakness and perishability of the flesh, warning christians that they should mortify theirbodies (and all earthly goods and desires, which would also perish in the end) and tend totheir spirits, which would never suffer the indignity of death (that the memento mori alsoundoubtedly served as a means of relieving the fears and concerns of a particularly death-"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"38fraught time says little about its religious function and much about the human capability toadjust to even the most horrifying traumas by means of artistic expression). By denying not only the inevitability, but the very presence of death, industrializedWestern society has simply handicapped its members. Without the awareness of death as anecessary and natural part of life, it becomes difficult for us to deal with the deaths of thosewe love and even more difficult to deal with the realization that we ourselves must die--letalone to appreciate death in the manner of traditional peoples, for whom it can be both thecrown of this life and the initiation into the next. Ironically, virtually the only guideline modern Americans have for both the personalpreparation for death--recognising it in its often gruesome forms and imagining ourselvesundergoing the same processes--and, at the same time, for reassuring ourselves of theexistence of a realm or realms beyond this which guarantee the continuance of somethingof ourselves after death--is horror fiction and films. Short of deliberately seeking out booksof pathology and mortuaries, very few Westerners are likely to observe a dead body asanything other than a waxwork doll, with rouged cheeks and eyes carefully glued shut,artfully arranged in the “Doesn’t she look natural!” position. The British Manual of FuneralDirecting explicitly states that “The aim of the funeral director or his assistant (whendealing with the corpse) should be to attain a natural position”; those bodies on which thesigns of death cannot be hidden are the “bad remains”, which are presented to mournersonly in closed coffins. The horror genre, on the other hand, frequently requires a directconfrontation with the realities of death and decay--and with the belief that something otherthan blood flow and brainwaves separates the dead from the living; while if a work in thisfield is effective in the slightest way, the reader/viewer must identify with the possibility ofexperiencing death (or worse). As Stephen King has commented in an astute observation onhis own genre, “(Horror is) a rehearsal for death. It’s a way to get ready . . . I also think thatsome of horror’s current popularity is due to the failure of religion . . . Horror fiction,supernatural horror fiction, suggests that we go on.” Even this mode of preparation,however, is distanced from us by its very nature: “It’s only a book. It’s only a movie.”Likewise, the reassuring imminence of the supernatural can also serve as a distancingeffect: if there are no vampires lurking in their hiding places, no ghosts trying to delivertheir dying messages--if the supernatural in the book or movie must be dismissed altogetheras a fantasy, then its comfort goes away at the same time as its terror, when the covers closeor the theatre lights come up (or the reader wakes up from a subsequent nightmare). If not usually a welcome guest, Death, of course, was a common visitor in the VikingAge, coming in through many windows and doors. Sickness was not uncommon: forinstance, Eyrbyggja saga and the two chief sources on the Greenland and Americansettlements, Grœnlendinga saga (Saga of the Greenlanders) and Eiríks saga rauða (Eiríkrthe Red’s Saga), describe contagious and fatal diseases striking Iceland and Greenlandrespectively. However, death by sickness could neither be explained rationally, foreseen bynon-supernatural means, nor prepared for in normal ways: its mystery, especially in casesof epidemics, led to a sense of it as being unnatural, as we see in the Icelandic andGreenlandic materials, where the diseases have a strong supernatural element to them of asort which is typical for beliefs concerning the undead. The corpses of the Greenlandsettlers killed by the plague sit up, move, and sometimes speak. In both cases, the livingcan see the dead coming back to fetch more of the living. The Greenland plague wasattended by a host of the dead somewhat resembling both folklore of the Wild Hunt andmediæval images of the dance of death: And one evening Sigríðr desired to go to the outhouse, and stood beside the outerdoor. uðríðr followed her, and they opened the outer door. Then Sigríðr cried out loudly.Guðríðr said, ‘We have gone out carelessly, and you should not be here where the cold ison you, and we should go home as fast as possible’. Sigríðr answered, ‘There is nogoing to the dwelling: here is now the host of all the Brummie’s before the door, andThorsteinn, your husband, and there I also recognize myself, and there is much grief inseeing this’ .. Thorsteinn was gone then. She though that he went before and had a whip in his hand"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"39and would drive the host along. Afterwards they went in, and before morning came, thenshe was dead, and a coffin was made for the corpse.(Eiríks saga rauða. Einar Ól. Sveinsson and Matthias Þórðarson, eds. Íslenzk fornrit 4.Reykjavík: Hið íslenzka fornritafélag, 1935, pp. 214-215. The Icelandic troubles are heralded by a dead woman walking, followed by a “Moon ofWyrd” circling a certain farm’s main sitting room counter clockwise. The chief attack ofthe epidemic begins with the death of the farm’s shepherd, apparently by some sort ofsupernatural agency. Then, It was one night, when Thórir Wood-Leg went out to his outhouse and back the other way; and when he wanted to go in, then he saw that the shepherd had come in front of the door; Thórir wanted to go in, but the shepherd did not want him to; then Thórir wanted to walk away, but the shepherd sought after him and grabbed him and cast him against the door; he took that ill, but he got back to his room and was bruised blue-black. After this he took sick and died; he was also buried at the church there; afterwards they were both seen together, the shepherd and Thórir Wood-Leg; and folk were all terrified of this, as might be expected.” After this, folk begin to die in earnest. The sickness is not ended until the ghosts havebeen banished by the peculiarly Icelandic means of summoning them to a legal court “forhaving come without leave into a dwelling and depriving folk of both life and health . . .The door-court was held and the charges spoken and all formulae carried out as at a Thing-court”, after which the ghosts depart, no more people die, and Thuríðr, who is ill, becomeswell again. Although this takes place after the conversion, the source of the procedure is one Snorrigoði (Snorri the Priest; although the title goði was used primarily to mean “chieftain” inIceland, the goði of the heathen period was responsible for keeping up the local temple andperforming certain communal rituals). Snorri himself had been a heathen goði for sometime before the conversion (which appears to have been skin-deep at best); and though achristian priest is sent, the christian priest has nothing to do with the effects of law-court orthe process of banishment--his only role is to sprinkle holy water and sing psalms after theghosts have already departed. Thus, in Snorri’s solution, we may still observe one of thecharacteristics contributing to the health of native Norse society: the dead are subject to lawin the same manner as the living; the supernatural and the natural are ultimately governedby the same rules, and the Otherworld, as noted in the previous chapter, can be understoodin terms of this world. When the power of the whole community (perhaps, one mightimagine, implicitly including those dead kinsmen who are not acting out of turn?) isbrought to bear, a pack of ghosts can no more be allowed to trespass and cause injury thancan a pack of outlaws. The individual element is also strongly present in maintaining thejudgement of the court: instead of abandoning the farmstead, its young owner Kjartan hiresnew servants in the spring to replace the dead ones, and continues to farm on that spot, thusreinforcing and maintaining the effect of the law-court (and winning the admiration of hiscontemporaries). Sickness, then, was a matter of fear and supernatural remedy. Death by old age, on thecontrary, was rare, and when it did occur--if the sagas can be trusted--it was usually met ina well-spirited and dignified manner--prepared for carefully and accepted with clearforeknowledge. The death of the old in the sagas is, indeed, one model for the “good death”or the “appropriate death”--that is to say, “a death that someone might choose for himself--had he a choice”. Their keen awareness of their approaching end seems to have made, ingeneral, the old of the Viking Age able to choose and face death in the manner most fittingto their lives. This is not uncommon among traditional peoples, especially those living inharsh environments. For instance, among the Alaskan Inuit, a man would normally fix theday of his own death, whereupon he would tell his life story to his kin, pray, instruct hisfellow tribesmen on important matters, and then set out onto the icecap. Even long aftertheir christianization, the rigors of Saami herding life required similar sacrifices on the part"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"40of the elderly. Hugh Beach describes an account told to him by the elderly Swede NevadaLarsson of something that happened when Larsson was a child: one springtime, during theSaami migrations, an old man who was too weak and tired to keep up with the trek “wentout on the lake, cut a hole in the ice and jumped in. The lake had thawed and frozen overagain, however, and so when he jumped he did not drop far before hitting another layer ofice. He was stubborn and sat down on the bottom layer with the water to his shoulders andwaited until he froze to death . . . Old Saami in the past had traditionally ended their ownlives rather than become a burden.” Even now, “For many Saami . . . used to a totallydifferent life, death is far preferable to a long decline at the nursing home.” A similarpractice appears, though reduced to a rather fantastic and humorous form, in the NorseGautreks saga: a certain family is so miserly that, whenever they feel that their fortunes arediminished by such trifling things as an extra guest at dinner, one of the older members willgo to a certain cliff called Ættarstapi (Kin-Cliff) and leap off. It may be suspected that thisaccount preserves memories of a rather grimmer reality: famines were not uncommon inScandinavia, and the long winters were often difficult to survive after a thin year, so thatthose who had outlived their chief usefulness might well have spared their younger andhealthier kin the burden of feeding them in bad times. While the Scandinavians were not unusual among traditional peoples, their sense of theworthiness of accepting and even choosing death at an appropriate time seems remarkablewithin their context. When we see that this attitude towards death is not that of a marginal(but perceived as exceptionally spiritual) tribal people such as the Inuit, Native American,Saami, or Australian Aboriginal, but rather that of a Northern European culture in therelatively recent past, it brings home the awareness that the West did not need to lose itsunderstanding of the cycle of death and life. Like the aged Inuit, Flosi’s choice to set sail in an unseaworthy boat at the end of thesummer gives him full power over the end of his life and the last memory that survives him.When the cantankerous and difficult Egill Skalla-Grímsson reaches the end of his life, hewishes to go out with a bang, scattering his hoard of silver about at the national Thing andseeing how much strife and fighting he can cause: while this might not be seen as the modelof a well-adjusted person, it is perfectly characteristic for Egill, who has been makingtrouble and enjoying fights since his early childhood. Dissuaded from this course of actionby his family, he gets revenge on them by taking two of his son’s thralls out with him,burying the hoard, and (in spite of being blind and in his nineties, with bad circulation)killing the thralls; satisfied that no one will get the better of him even in death, he is thenable to die relatively peacefully. Sigurður Nordal goes even farther in interpreting Egill’slast wishes, arguing that Egill is actually emulating his patron Óðinn in these activities: “hewants to. . . egg men on against each other after Óðinn’s example, in order to get him afollowing, though he himself is unable to kill.” Perhaps so. Probably the best of all the non-violent “good deaths” in the sagas, however, is that ofthe old matriarch Unnr Deep-Thinking. After the death of her husband and son, she gathersher clan and people together and leads them from Scotland to Ireland. Choosing hergrandson Óláfr as her successor in her old age, Unnr arranges a great feast at which sheannounces his inheritance. After that Unnr stood up and said that she would go to that chamber, where she waswont to sleep; she bade, that everyone have the chambers which might be most pleasingto them, although the chambers must be divided among all the folk. Folk say thus, thatUnnr had been both high-spirited and strong; she went swiftly out of the hall, and wordswere found among the folk, that she was a worthy woman. Folk drank that evening untilthey thought it time to go to sleep. But the day after Óláfr feilan went to the sleeping-chamber of Unnr his kinswoman, and when he came to the chamber, Unnr was sittingup on the pillow; she had died there. After that Óláfr went out into the hall to tell thetidings; folk thought a great deal of it, how Unnr had held her worth until her dying day.Now all was drunken together: Óláfr’s wedding and Unnr’s arvel. (Laxdæla saga, pp. 12-13) Although the chances of having the opportunity to deal with one’s own death in old age,"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"41both among the Norse and among the other tribal peoples mentioned, was relatively rare, itstill happened often enough that there was a clear societal sense of an appropriate response:disposing of one’s goods as one wished them to be disposed of, and leaving a memoryfitting to the life one had lived. In contrast, even the best of circumstances for a death inWestern society--at least, when death occurs outside the context of the most ritual-conscious religions (such as the highly conservative elements of Catholicism)--usually canbe met only by an improvised response. An example of such a response is given by HaimHazan: . . . one of the members of a day centre for Jewish elderly people . . . was determined to celebrate his ninety-fifth birthday. He was well aware that his death was imminent, and, although his doctors maintained that his hours were numbered he insisted on goingahead with the celebration, which he attended connected to an oxygen tank. During theparty, he announced that he was donating a sum of money so that the other members ofthe day centre could continue celebrating his birthday until he reached the age of onehundred. He did not mention his impending death. When he had finished his speech hewas taken to a side room, where he died. This event had an enormous impact oneveryone present. Clearly the man wished to think in terms of time after his biological death, and he succeeded in fulfilling his desire in the most practical sense by guaranteeing thecontinued celebration of his birthday long after his physical departure. (Old Age: Constructions and Deconstructions. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,1994, pp. 72-73) Here, the celebration of the birthday replaces the distribution of money and/or goods tothe heirs; it also fulfils something of the same purpose as the repetition of the Kaddish (theJewish prayer recited after the death of a loved one, said twice a day for the first elevenmonths afterwards and then on all holy days) in the man’s native tradition. The samemotivation is present as in the last arrangements of Unnr and Egill, or of the elderly of theother traditional peoples mentioned above: to finish off life by setting in motion a finaleffect upon the living, which will continue after biological death. However, Hazan’sexample represents a rarity--an idiosyncratic response to impending death, rather than oneestablished and supported by societal norms. Sickness and the unusual condition of old age aside, the Norse were chiefly faced withthe prospects of death by accident--drowning was particularly common in Iceland, forobvious reasons--and, most commonly of all, death related to what might be called theoccupational hazards of gender: violence for men, childbirth for women. It is unfortunatethat we have little except archaeological evidence describing this latter cause of death.Perhaps this may be partially due to the generally masculine perspectives of the sagas: weknow a great deal about the last words of men killed in fight, about how they conductedthemselves and were expected to conduct themselves when dying of their wounds, but wehave only a few hints regarding women who died of childbirth, such as the account inVölsunga saga of how the mother of the hero Völsungr had difficulty getting pregnant, thenbore the child in her womb for an unlikely six years, eventually feeling the approach of herdeath and bidding that the child be cut out. Her death appears to be a necessary element inthe typically unusual birth of a hero. However, this motif is seldom repeated. The sagas arealso chary of adding extraneous detail, and it may be that since a child without a mother tocare for it was likely to die or be set out unless a foster-mother could be found, the deathsof women and their newborns were generally of little interest in regards to overall plotlines. In this regards, it may be noted that a large percentage--possibly the majority--of thedominant women in the sagas are mothers of adult sons and hence past the dangers ofchildbearing. The absence of oral/written materials regarding death by childbirth when compared tothose on the heroism of facing death in battle may also reflect the lesser need of culturalreinforcement for women to bear children in the normal pattern of life, as opposed to thecultural encouragement required for men to deliberately choose to risk their lives in battle."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"42 Here, with this deliberate assumption of risk and acceptance of the possibility of death,we see a setup strongly leading to the glorification of the “good death”, defined in theViking Age as the ability to meet one’s end knowingly and without fear, as expressed bySigurðr (Siegfried) to the ex-valkyrie Sigrdrífa (Brünnhilde): I shall not flee though I know myself death-doomed, I was never born with cowardice. (Sigrdrífumál 21). The ideal of the “good death”, and the distinction between that and a “bad death” appearsnowhere so poignantly as in Völsunga saga’s account of the death of Högni (Hagen). Afterthe capture of Högni and Gunnarr (Günther) by Atli (Attila), Atli tries to force Gunnarr togive up the secret of where the Rhine’s treasure is hidden. Gunnarr replies that he will notanswer until he holds his brother’s heart in his hands, and Atli orders that Högni’s heart becut out. Högni said: “Do as you like. Gladly will I await whatever you wish to do, and that shall be seen, that my heart is never timid, and I have proven hard trials before” . . . Then a rede-giver of Attila the king spoke, “I see better counsel. Let us rather take the thrall Hjalli, and spare Högni” . . . The thrall heard and cried out loudly and ran away, where- ever he might expect shelter. He said that he had drawn an evil lot from their strife, and himself to pay for it. He said that it was an ill day, when he should die and lose his good life and his pig-keeping. They grabbed him and drew their knives towards him. He cried out loudly before he felt the edge. Then Högni spoke, as strong men do when they come in mortal danger, so that he interceded for the life of the thrall, and said that he did not wish to hear the shrieking, and that it was easier for himself to play out that game . . . (Eventually the heart of the thrall is cut out anyway, but Gunnarr recognises by its cowardly quivering that it is not the heart of his brother) . . . Now, following the incitements of King Attila, they went to Högni and cut out his heart. And his strength was so great, that he laughed while he suffered this torment. (Völsunga saga, pp. 99-100). Although legendary rather than historical, this tale stood as a paradigm of properbehaviour in the face of suffering and death: though Högni and Hjalli are killed in the samemanner, Hjalli’s death is shameful and, due to the poor figure he cuts, distressing toeveryone around him, but Högni’s death stands as the heroic crown to an heroic life. The“good death”, whether taking place in old age (rarely) or long before the end of thepotential natural lifespan (usually), was not only seen as a cultural ideal, but as somethingwithin the control of the individual--for no matter how hideous the means of dying, it wasthe personal response to death which made all the difference. As a natural development of the “good death”, the folk of the Viking Age--or at least thesaga characters who expressed the ideology of Scandinavian culture--also seem to havecultivated what christian writers of a later date called the Ars moriendi: the art of dying.There is, of course, a great difference between native Norse and christian concepts of thisart: while the christian Ars moriendi consisted of such things as confession, properbehaviour for family members and priests attending the dying, ways of recognising andmeeting deathbed temptations; the Norse art of dying was characterized chiefly by a showof hardiness, staunch acceptance of facts, and, ideally, a certain grim humour and skill withwords, as seen by Thórgrímr in Brennu-Njáls saga: a member of a band of men who havecome to slay the noted hero (and currently outlawed) Gunnarr of Hliðarend, Thórgrímr goesto see if Gunnarr is in his house. As he returns to the band, another man asks if Gunnarr isin, whereupon Thórgrímr replies, “‘You may know that, but I know this: that his thrusting-spear was at home.’ After this he fell down dead.” Grim wit seems to have been the mosteffective means of dealing with the reality of one’s own death (Interestingly, thisphenomenon has recently made a resurgence with the “AIDS humour” prevalent in thecommunity of those dying of AIDS and their caregivers: though the humour may seem sickand unfeeling to outsiders, it provides a necessary outlet for those who must daily deal with"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"43their own deaths and those of their friends). As observed by Celtic Wiccan Elder and gaypsychotherapist Jim Lovette, I combine (the deathbed scene and AIDS humour) because I think they are so closely related. The primary factor that sets up deathbed scenes is the relationship to both the families of origin and of creation. If the relationships are generally positive and supportive, the dying person can generally be expected to have more freedom to uniquelygrieve. This support can translate into permission for expressions ranging from socialgatherings or adventures to small or large Hollywood-esque depictions, ribald/risquewit, bawdy singing, dancing, drag/costumes, etc., ad infinitum, with the dying person aseither the central organizing person or focus. Generally, individuals are coping withsuch pervasive and profound financial and psychological stresses that their friendsprovide entertainment or re-creation for their diversion, resulting in explicitly strongerinterpersonal bonds during a time when those bonds are most challenged. Humor generally is used by all humans during periods of intense psychological stress as a primary, compensating means of sanity-maintenance. It relieves stress and allows for therecognition of loss in ways unique to the culturally- and relationally-specific expressionsof humor. This permits individuals to move into acknowledgement of the profundity of change facing them and the dying individual. (Jim Lovette, e-mail interview, Nov. 4, 1995). Nevertheless, both the Norse and christian ideals are alike in elevating the “gooddeath” to its role as the final expression of a good life. One may compare the ideal of thechristian literature (as summarized by Robert Kastenbaum)--”There is an art to dying aswell as to living. The two, in fact, are intimately related. One should live each day asthough it might be the last. Furthermore, this should not lead to immoderate or self-indulgent behaviour: the sure prospect of death must surely inspire us to the highest plateauof moral rectitude. And in life’s final scene one will face such fear, such agony, and suchtemptation that it will require all the purity, strength, and faith one can bring to the crisis” --with two of the high literary examples of the art of dying in the Old Norse corpus. The first,Hjálmarr’s Death-Song, is a poem supposed to have been spoken by the hero Hjálmarr, afriend of the romantic saga-figure Arrow-Oddr, as he lay dying. His reference to “the lasteagle I feed” turns around the poetic convention of referring to the slaying of foes asfeeding the eagle: having fed the birds of prey on the corpses of others, he is now ready tofeed them on his own flesh. Sixteen wounds have I, slit is my byrnie, all is dark before my eyes, I cannot see to tread. Angantýr’s blade has struck against my heart, the keen weapon, hardened with poison . . . A raven flies from eastward, from the high gallows-tree, after him flies the eagle. This will be the last eagle I feed, thus he shall drink my blood. The second, Krákumál, is the poem supposedly spoken by Ragnar Loðbrók (a semi-historical character, involved in the sack of Paris, but unlikely to have done most of thefantastic things mentioned in his saga--on which the movie The Vikings was very looselybased) from a pit of poisonous serpents where he had been cast by the English king Ælle.After a lengthy (27 stanzas--one may only observe that the venom of the European adder isnot particularly virulent) recounting of his life and deeds, beginning each stanza with theline, “We hewed with blades”, Ragnar at last concludes with the triumphant account of hisdeath: We hewed with blades. The warrior has carried out fifty-one host-battles."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"44 Least of all guessed I, that it should befall me (who, young, took blade to redden it) that another king should overcome me. The gods must invite me, One should not complain of dying.  I am joyous at ending, the goddesses bid me home, who, from Herjan’s hall, Óðinn has sent to me; gladly shall I, in high-seat, drink of ale with Æsir: all hope of life is gone, laughing shall I die. Through the legendary mouth of Ragnar, we are furnished with the last necessary piecefor making one’s own death a “good death”: the belief in an afterlife worthy of dying wellfor. The Norse view of a “good death” in battle as one way into a good afterlife can, here,be contrasted starkly to the Iroquois view: “Iroquois beliefs as recorded in later eras madedeath in battle a frightful prospect, though one that must be faced bravely if necessary. Theslain, like all who perished violently, were excluded from the villages of the dead, doomedto spend a roving eternity seeking vengeance.” Much of the difference between the twomay be attributed to the fact that the chief purpose of Iroquois warfare was to win captivesand thus replenish the tribe: the loss of men in battle lessened the tribe’s chance of survival.Among the Norse, on the other hand, a man’s readiness to die in battle increased thesurvival chances of his family and clan, since the consequence of losing a fight was notadoption into another tribe, but death or, worse, the dishonour to self and kin of beingenslaved. Death by violence was likely, could well be necessary, and had to be facedregularly both as a prospective end for oneself and a frequently occurring end for friendsand family members. It was, therefore, necessary for those who faced it to feel that dyingbravely and well was pleasing to gods, clan, and society, and a gateway to a good worldbeyond. The concept of dying in battle as the passage to a better afterlife is not, of course, uniqueto Scandinavian belief. It has been used, to immediate military and political effect, by twoof the largest religions in the world today: Islam and christianity. The latter has largelyabandoned the promise of entrance into Heaven for those who die in holy wars; regardingthe former, however, the belief is still of immediate impact. The jihad, or holy war, has been part of Islamic belief since the foundation of thereligion; the description of the Paradise waiting for the fallen exists already in the Koran:“Let those who would exchange the life of this world for the hereafter, fight for the cause ofGod; whoever fights for the cause of God, whether he dies or triumphs, We shall richlyreward him . . . The believers who stay at home--apart from those who suffer a greatimpediment--are not the equals of those who fight for the cause of God with their goodsand their persons. God has given those that fight with their goods and their persons a higherrank than those who stay at home. God has promised all a good reward; but far richer is therecompense of those who fight for him.” The reception of the slain man is pleasant: “feasting on fruit, and honoured in thegardens of delight. Reclining face to face upon soft couches, they shall be served with agoblet filled at a gushing fountain, white, and delicious to those who drink it. It will neitherdull their senses nor befuddle them. They shall sit with bashful, dark-eyed virgins, as chasteas the sheltered eggs of ostriches” --the cool green land desired by desert-dwellers; anheightened idealization of pleasures to which only the very richest could have aspired inlife. To those who truly believe, whether in the Dark Ages or now, there is no hope betterthan to die in such a holy war, as an episode from Muhammad’s own life makes clear:"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"45 ‘By him who holds Muhammad’s soul in his hands,’ (Muhammad) said, ‘not one who fights this day, if he has borne himself with steadfast courage, if he has gone forward and not back, shall meet his death without Allah’s bringing him to paradise!’ Umayr ibn al-Humàm, who was eating a handful of dates, heard this and shouted out: ‘Fine! Fine! Have I only to get myself killed by these men to enter into paradise?’ He threw away his dates and, grasping his sword, plunged into the thick of the battle and soon was killed. This belief made it easier for Islamic leaders to raise military forces from the end of theseventh century, when Muhammad urged his soldiers on with not only the hope of theafterlife awaiting, but with the guarantee that those who took part in battle should reaphigher rewards than those who did not, through the modern age, where the possibility ofjihad is a serious potential weapon of legitimate Islam and a terrifying incitement to thelunatic fringes of that religion. For official christianity, the evolution towards not only sanctioning, but actively blessingand encouraging, battle was a much longer and more troublesome one. The Dark Agespractice of conversion by the sword was supported by the Church: Charlemagne’sgenocidal war against the Saxons (including the mass slaughter of 4,500 Saxon prisoners inone day) was generally approved, since one of his official purposes was to destroy theirnative religious culture by forcibly baptizing those who could be baptized (in someinstances, after clubbing them on the head to prevent resistance) and killing the rest. TheMainz pontifical and Ottonian Ordo (ca. 960) gave the king/emperor the explicit duty ofsuppressing non-christian nations and supporting missions, by means of force if necessary. However, the encouragement of violent conversion was a very different thing fromgranting blanket indulgences to all those who participated in the process of slaughteringtraditional religionists or the supporters of heterodoxical views. The former was cloakedwith the shamefaced admission that the use of violence to spread christianity was, at best, anecessary evil; the latter made it a positive good. The concept of promising Heaven, or atleast general absolution, to those who fought against the enemies of christendom, firstseems to have come up in the ninth century, with the proclamations of Pope Leo IV in 853and Pope John VIII in 878. Thereafter, however, nothing similar was proposed until theeleventh century, when the Church’s involvement with military operations to protect itsterritory increased under Gregory VII, who is often given credit for making the “militiaChristi” a physical reality of warfare. Nevertheless, the First Crusade was met with mixedfeelings: a religion with a nominally non-violent ideology was suddenly placed in asituation where an active call to militarization seemed to be to its best advantage. Thesolution, for the time being, was to emphasize the concept of the crusader as a pilgrim(albeit a specialized and martial sort), with all the relevant duties and rights. It was not, however, until the time of the Second Crusade that the uneasy marriage ofChrist and Mars was finally reconciled in a comfortable fashion--by the “New Knighthood”of Bernard de Clairveaux, the orders of military monks such as the Templars, Hospitallers,and Teutonic Knights who, in theory, united all the spiritual advantage of reclusivemonastic orders with the bravery, strength, activity, and honour of secular chivalry. Thecombination of a new warrior-religious ideology with the granting of indulgences to thosekilled on Crusade and major temporal privileges offered to all participators provided astrong social impetus for major political leaders to attempt the reclamation of the HolyLand, probably assisting to a great degree in the prolongation of one of the most costly anddestructive phenomena of the Middle Ages. In modern christianity, although mainstream churches no longer offer the promise ofHeaven to those who die in holy wars--and are turning away from the encouragement of“righteous violence”--the belief is finding a disturbing new upsurgence in the radical right-wing fringe. Such activities as violence against family planning clinics and doctors whoperform abortions--for instance, the Dec. 1984 bombings of a clinic in Penascola, Floridaby two couples who called themselves “knights” --are strongly rooted in the background ofa culture which has included a direct linkage between the practice and promotion ofchristianity and the use of violence since the age of the Crusades. As observed by H.E.J.Cowdrey,"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"46 As we look back over nine hundred years to the age of Gregory VII and Urban II, we cannot fail to recognise it as one of the most powerfully formative periods in ourcommon culture, outlook, and institutions. It saw the reversal of a thousand years ofChristian tradition, when the Gregorian papacy accepted warfare without reservationas a meritorious activity, and the profession of arms as a Christian vocation so long asit was directed towards the extirpation of what is alien to Christianity both inside andoutside Christian society . . . The Crusade itself, as a kind of war aimed at propagatingone set of ideas and habits of life, the Christian, as against another set, the Muslim, hasexercised an especial influence on this century. Did not Eisenhower describe his part inthe Second World War in terms of a “Crusade in Europe”? (“The Genesis of the Crusades”. The Holy War. Thomas Patrick Murphy, ed. Columbus:Ohio State University Press, 1976, 9-32, p. 27) On the surface, the Norse belief that death in battle would be rewarded by a goodafterlife (whether in Valhalla, Freyja’s hall, or elsewhere) seems very similar to both theIslamic and christian models, particularly the former. Lamm and Nýlen compare theIslamic image of beautiful women serving fine drink to the warriors fallen in battle to theNorse descriptions of Valhalla, suggesting that perhaps some influence could have occurredvia the Viking roads to the East, on which the Norse frequently came into contact withfollowers of Islam. A closer examination of the uses and reasons for the beliefs, however, makes thedistinction between them clear. For monotheists with a strict dogma, of course, the use ofholy war and the promise of heaven to its slain is--whatever religious validity it may have--chiefly an effective political tool: it arouses the sentiments of a populace that mightotherwise be less enthusiastic, and whips up fighting frenzy to the point of fanaticism. Italso serves as an excuse in case God’s side loses, since it is just as blessed, or even more so,to die a martyr as it is to conquer in God’s name: “Never think that those who were slain inthe cause of God are dead. They are alive, and well provided for by their Lord”. For theearly Scandinavians, the former concept would have been unimaginable: to carry out a holywar, whatever its actual political or economic motives, requires an ideology which believesthat a single means of worship and/or conduct is good, and that those who do not conformto it are evil. The latter--the problem of how to reconcile death in battle with the continuedfavour of the gods--will be discussed later in some detail; for now it is sufficient to observethat among the Norse, the matter was not a question of which side was in the right, but ofthe individual’s relationship with the deities, particularly Wotan. In this context, it is worthnoting that, while the Islamic imagery of Paradise may have reinforced the Norse imageryof the valkyries serving drink in Valhöll to some degree, the cultural expectation that aguest would be honoured by receiving drink from the hands of the hall’s noble women wasfundamental to Germanic society, as demonstrated in Beowulf as well as the numerousNorse examples. Because of the political power of holy war in a monotheistic society, both the Islamicand christian promises of Paradise to those who die fighting are usually restricted tospecific battles sanctioned by chief religious figures--or, at the very least, the “holy causes”of fringe groups. In contrast, no similar value judgements seem to have been made by theNorse: neither the war’s purpose nor the ideologies of the combatants affected the value ofthe individual “good death” in battle. Right and wrong in a social sense were matters to bedecided in law-courts or, in extremes, by ritual single combat: good was largely whatbenefited the community, not an abstract concept to be defended against foreign ideas byforce. The difference could not be greater between the portrait painted in the Chanson duRoland, of Roland and Oliver sending a host of treacherous Arabic foemen to Hell, andHaraldr Hairfair leaving his slain foemen “destined for the one-eyed dweller in Frigg’sembrace” (Hrafnsmál 12), that is, given to the god who may well be Haraldr’s own patron.In a christian or Islamic world, if bloody slaughter were to take place, one side must bydefinition be offensive not only to the other, but to God. In a Heathen world, both sidesmight very well be pleasing to the gods, and favour was not necessarily determined byvictory: Loki, quite likely expressing the opinions of many humans during the Viking Age,"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"47says to Óðinn, “You could never deal out battle among men; often you gave victory to theworse men, to whom you should not have given it” (Lokasenna 22). Indeed, the participantson both sides were assumed to have the same general destination: the only question waswhich of them Wotan would choose to call to himself first--or if it would be simultaneous,as in Eiríksmál, where Eiríkr Blood-Axe boasts that he is followed by five kings (whom hehas slain); he himself is the sixth. The Norse were, of course, by no means above using religious beliefs--particularly beliefsconcerning the afterlife--for political purposes, as is shown in the following poemsEiríksmál and Hákonarmál. The chief difference between this usage and that of Islam andchristianity is that, whereas the promise of Paradise in monotheistic religion (and thecorresponding reassurance of fighting for God’s cause) was used to stir up fighters, theNorse poems were written after the deaths of the chief participants for, among other things,the purpose of making a political statement relevant to the dead man’s successors, in amanner comparable to the role of the political dead in Northern Ireland as described byPrior: “the dead can be, and are, also used for purposes of political legitimation. They canbe used either to legitimise a political movement, or to defend a particular strategy.” Suchusage is part and parcel of a heritage-based society, of which the dead are not the weakest,but the most powerful elements; and among the dead, of course, the strongest are thoseritually enthroned in the hall of heroes--in Valhalla. To understand the memorial poems Eiríksmál and Hákonarmál fully, it is necessary tolook at the story behind them. At this time, Norway was in a state of considerable tumult.Two of the chief players--and causes of the chaos--were the notorious King Eiríkr Blood-Axe and his wife, Queen Gunnhildr, who was said to be a practitioner of the generallymalicious form of mind-altering magic known as seiðr. Eiríkr and Gunnhildr had becomeenemies of Egill Skalla-Grímsson--who was equally famed for his skills at fighting, poetry,and runic magic--by depriving him of a portion of his inherited land. In revenge, Egill setup a nithing pole (“pole of shame”, in this case, a stave with a horse’s head on top andrunes carved on it), turning it against the spirits of the land so that they would have no restuntil they had driven Eiríkr and Gunnhildr out of Norway. This eventually came to pass; theroyal couple, with their several sons, sought sanctuary in the city of York. Norway, meanwhile, was taken over by Eiríkr’s younger brother, Hákon the Good.Hákon had been a fosterling (or hostage) in England during his youth and temporarilyconverted to christianity. This was not met well upon his return, when he refused to do theruler’s duty of taking part in the seasonal feasts of worship which assured the blessing ofthe gods. For a short period of time, his counsellor Sigurðr covered for him with the othergreat men of Norway (interpreting the king’s refusal to drink to Óðinn as a toast to Thórr,and the concurrent sign of the cross made over the horn as the sign of Thórr’s Hammer),and eventually managed to re-integrate the king with his society, whereafter Hákon madethe blessings his position demanded and protected the holy shrines. His reign was generallypeaceable and well thought-of; however, he might have paid more heed to the words of theex-valkyrie Sigrdrífa: “This is my tenth rede, that you never trust those dropped by anoutlaw . . . a wolf is in the young son, though he seems gladdened by gold.” (Sigrdrífumál35) The sons of Hákon’s wolfish older brother would return, and would eventually beHákon’s death. The first of the poems, Eiríksmál--if the later saga description of its writing is correct--was commissioned by Queen Gunnhildr from an anonymous skald, about 950 C.E. It wascomposed as a memorial at the time when Eiríkr’s sons were trying to win Norway backfrom their uncle Hákon the Good. It specifically addresses the question of, “If Eiríkr werethe best leader, favoured by the gods, why did he lose the battle?” thereby providingEiríkr’s sons with an assurance of legitimacy. It also may have been intended to soothe theanxieties of the Norwegian populace in several respects, including their worries about theencroachment of christianity. The Norwegian people still held largely to their nativereligion at this time, and Eiríkr was not popular among them. He had been a nominalconvert to christianity; Turville-Petre comments that, “(Eiríkr) was described by acontemporary poet as the defiler of holy places, and it is plain that he was not a devoutpagan, and may thus have earned the enmity of conservative landowners of Norway”. In the poem, Eiríkr’s death is specifically not a consequence of the gods turning against"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"48him, but rather of Óðinn’s need for him to stand beside the heroes of legend; here the godjustifies himself in an otherwise uncharacteristic fashion. It is, perhaps, also significant thatthis poem is the one in which Valhalla is most like an earthly hall, complete with strewnbenches, washed beer-cups, and the most costly of imported drinks, wine, to be borne to thehonoured guest. All of these things raise the standing of Eiríkr as a leader and emphasizehis legitimacy as a ruler, just as (if Ellmers’ interpretation of the Gotlandic picture stones iscorrect) Wotan’s offer of his own horse for the dead man to ride into Valhalla verifies thehigh standing of the man thus memorialized. (Óðinn speaks) 1.“What manner of dream is this? I dreamed I rose before dawn to ready Valhöll for fallen warriors: wakened the einherjar bade rise up to strew the benches to clean the beer-cups, valkyries to bear wine, as if a prince came. 2. “From the world I expect to come to me certain great men: that gladdens my heart. 3. “What resounds there, Bragi, As if a thousand hurried or a huge host?” (Bragi) “The benches all creak, as Baldr must be coming again to Óðinn’s hall.” (Óðinn) 4. “Foolish words wise Bragi should not speak, for you know something well: they clash before Eiríkr, who shall come in here, the battle-boar in Óðinn’s hall. 5. “Sigmundr and Sinfjötli, rise up quickly, and go to meet the ruler. If you see Eiríkr bid him come in, it is him for whom I now wait.” (Bragi) 6. “Why do you await Eiríkr rather than others?” (Óðinn) “For he has reddened his blade in many lands,"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"49 and borne a bloody sword.” (Bragi) 7. “Why did you take victory from him, if you thought him to be brave?” (Óðinn) “Because of that which cannot be known: the gray Wolf gapes ever at the gods’ dwellings.” (Sigmundr) 8. “Hail now, Eiríkr, you shall be welcome here and, wise one, walk into the hall. This shall I ask: which battle-boars follow you from the edge-thunder?” (Eiríkr) 9. “There are five kings - I ken all their names - I myself am the sixth.” Hákonarmál followed shortly after Eiríksmál (961 C.E.) and was written by EyvindrSkáldaspillir (usually translated as Eyvindr the Plagiarist, though the literal meaning“destroyer of skalds” may imply that his poetry was so good as to give no other skald achance). The most apparent characteristic of the poem is the author’s strong personalfeeling: Eyvindr was the court poet of Hákon the Good, and deeply loved his king.However, there is a strong political element to Hákonarmál as well. It is literally a sequel toEiríksmál: Hákon died fighting the sons of Eiríkr. Having no living heirs of his belovedlord to support, Eyvindr plays directly off Eiríksmál, possibly in order to convince Eiríkr’ssons of the virtue of Hákon’s policies, especially in regards to religion: Hákonarmál showsHákon as doubtful of his place, but emphasizes that his dealings with the holy shrines arewhat has won him his glory. Eyvindr was right to be suspicious of Eiríkr’s sons, who werechristians and went out of their way to destroy Norwegian places of worship--leading,apparently, to prompt retaliation from the gods: as recorded in a fragment of Eyvindr’s,under their rule, it snowed in the middle of the summer and the Norwegians had to keeptheir cattle inside during the summer time as the Lapps did. 1. Gauta-Týr sent Göndul and Skögul to choose among kings, who, of Yngvi’s clan, should fare with Óðinn and be in Valhöll. 2.

The leader spoke thus - he was come from battle, and stood all spattered with blood: “Greatly ill-willing I think Óðinn to be, and fearful am I of his thoughts.” 16. “You shall have all the einherjar’s friendship, receive you ale from the gods! Foe of jarls, you have eight brothers here within, “ said Bragi. 17. “All our gear,” said the good king, “we shall keep ourselves; helm and byrnie shall be warded well, it is good to have gear at hand.”"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"52 18. Because that is known how the king had well warded the holy steads, Hákon was hailed and bidden welcome by ruling mights and gods. 19.

Unbound through the worlds of men the Wolf Fenrir shall fare, before a king as good, comes to take his empty place. Both in their political function and their personal expression of feeling, the two“Valhöll” memorial poems show the development of a certain form of traditional belief toits highest point: the belief that a person who was sufficiently powerful or worthy in lifebecomes, in death, not only a worthy companion of the gods, but a being of power in his orher own right. As Jan de Vries has observed, it is clear that from the Stone Age onward,death was seen as intensifying the characteristics of the dead. A murderer or evil sorcerermight become a greater danger to the community in death than in life; but a chieftain, aleader, protector, and/or advisor of the clan, would equally become a greater help to thecommunity as a local or tribal protective spirit. This belief is not, of course, unique to the Germanic peoples. Cultures practicing“ancestor-worship” include, for instance, not only some Native American and Africantribes, but also modern Japan: as an article in the Herald Tribune recently observed, “WhileJapan is one of the most technologically sophisticated countries in the world, many peopleworship their ancestors as divinities and believe that each big tree or rock is also home to agod”. The belief in the power and activity of the dead is, however, one of the oldest--perhaps the oldest continuous element in Scandinavian religion--and is vital in anydiscussion of what death and different forms of honour for the dead meant. As mentioned briefly in the previous chapter, the relationship between the dead and theliving in Scandinavia was not one of separation, but one of community--of the familyextended to take in all its generations, from the first to the last. It was quite common for theburial place of the first homesteader to stand near to the house on his land, where hecontinued to receive offerings placed there by his family members and to be seen as theembodiment and guardian of the family “luck”. Both shards of the belief and the culticpractice of setting out food on special nights, such as Yule, kept alive even into thetwentieth century: although the dead ancestor had dwindled into a household sprite--thered-capped Swedish tomte or Danish nisse, similar to the Scottish brownie--he was notforgotten. As well as being the root of a family’s luck, and the embodiment of its connection withthe Otherworld, the mound or ceremonial burial place was also of tremendous importanceto the whole community, especially when it was the mound of a leader or other persongreatly respected by his or her fellows. From the Stone Age onward, burial edifices werechief sites of religious gatherings. This sense of the leader’s burial mound as a communityholy place strengthened in the North, rather than weakening: some of the greatest moundswere raised during the Migration and Vendel Ages, in the major centres of both religiousand political power (most notably, the three great mounds at Old Uppsala, but also, forinstance, those at Lejre and Sutton Hoo). The perception of death and the active dead ascentral, both spiritually and physically, to the community was precisely the opposite ofmodern perception and practice: Prior, for instance, observes the emphasis on segregating"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"53the dead from the living with, at the very least, high walls and forbidding gates and, whenpossible, the building of cemeteries outside, rather than inside, of the city. The concept ofholding regular meetings in a burial ground would seem, to say the least, macabre andmorbid to most Westerners; but to the native people of the North, there was no more logicalplace to perform religious rites, hold important speech, and receive good counsel than thatplace on the border between themselves and the mighty and powerful ones who had gonebefore them. There are several explicit references to a king in the mound continuing to work on behalfof his people--doing the same job for the land as a whole that the tomte or nisse does for thefarmstead. Flateyjarbók mentions how, after the burial of Óláfr at Geirstaðr, “Then thatrede was taken, that they made blessings to King Óláfr for good harvest and called him theElf of Geirstaðr.” Hálfdanar saga ins svarta mentions that, since Hálfdan’s reign had beenso prosperous and his folk placed so much trust in him that his body had to be divided upand laid in howes at Hringaríki, Raumaríki, Vestfold, and Heiðmörk. Snorri gives asimilar, if rather garbled, description of the secret burial of Freyr (here euhemerized from agod into a Swedish king), who received “tax money” poured into his mound for a long timeafter his death. The burial mound--especially that of the clan-father --in fact, seems to have been thechief focal point of a king’s authority: and that authority was gained specifically by sittingupon the mound, as seen by the proverb, “to sit on a howe (burial mound) like a king” andby the various saga-instances in which the action of sitting on the mound is directlyconnected with the claiming of succession. This deed certainly functioned on one level as astatement of identity; but more, it seems to have had a specific religious function--thefunction of allowing the ruler to speak with the wisdom of his dead ancestor within themound when he gives out his judgements from its height. As cultic leader and holder ofsacrificial feasts for his community, the ruler also had a particular relationship with therealms of the dead. In his person, he linked the gods, the dead, and the living, and wasresponsible for maintaining good relationships between them: and the ancestral moundseems to have been one of the chief focal points for this intersection of the worlds. Evennow, although the rulers of Sweden have long since forsaken Old Uppsala and a christianchurch stands where the gilded roof of the heathen place of worship once glimmered, it ispossible to gaze up at the three great mounds through the branches of the ancient ash-treethat stands beside them, and see--with the sight of the mind, if nothing else--the kingstanding on the middle mound in his figured helm, staring wide-eyed from his height intothe river-mist below and calling out his words into the wind that howls around the holyhowes. It takes little more imagination to feel the awe that must have come over the folklistening to him, seeing in him not only the living ruler, but the ghosts of his great forebearsspeaking through him, all the way back to the god Yngvi-Freyr, father of his line. As a being of special might, a dead hero or king naturally had a place in the world of thegods as well as the world of humans: and this is the belief that seems to have inspired andinformed the receptions of Eiríkr Blood-Axe and Hákon the Good in Valhöll, especially thelatter. Hákon is given ale by the gods--that is to say, he is taken up as an honoured guest inthe godly community. The idea that his entrance into Valhöll is also his admission to theranks of the holy powers fits well with the characterization of the einherjar in Grímnismál:like the dísir (family goddesses), they are beings whose favour is important to living men. The idea of humans being worshipped in their graves or even taken up among the godsis surprisingly common in the North: most notable is the description in Rimbert’s Vita S.Anskarii of how, when missionaries first brought the cult of Christ to Birka, the gods cameto one of their worshippers, saying that if the folk thought there were too few of them, theywould rather raise the late King Eiríkr of Sweden to godly rank than see their peopleworshipping a strange deity who spoke against them. From this point of view, Wotan’s hall appears to be taking on a new and special roletowards the end of the Viking Age. It is not only the hall of the dead, it is the hall of theespecially honoured dead, of the dead who have been taken up among the gods and whosenames and deeds will continue to be mighty among the living. Interestingly, it is at this timethat the name Valhalla--Hall of the Slain--first appears in skaldic poetry as a name for"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"54Óðinn’s hall: the name is inseparable from the receptions of Eiríkr and Hákon. The tenth-century Valhalla is, in fact, the most elaborate Scandinavian development of the age-oldworship of dead heroes: it explicitly describes Wotan’s choice of the best for his own, andpresents the recently slain as the equals of the greatest heroes of legends. From a political point of view, the purpose of the deification of a dead leader or hero isclear. It offers a sense of continuity: often, perhaps, the direct continuity of the new rulersitting on the forebear’s mound and speaking with the voice of the dead; but also thecontinuity expressed by subsequent ritual activities (offerings, memorial stones and poems,and so forth) showing the continued importance of the dead person and seeking his or hercontinued assistance. This feeling of continuity was certainly embodied locally by thebarrow in which the hallowed body is entombed--but may also have been expressed over awider area by the account of a mighty king’s reception among the einherjar in Valhalla.The expansion of political bodies in Scandinavia from the realms of provincial kings tolarge nations may, indeed, have contributed to the importance of the belief in Valhalla: theruler’s burial mound might be far away, part of what was perceived as a different land (cf.the desire to have four different howes for Hálfdan inn svarti), but if he were known to bedwelling in Valhalla with gods, heroes, and kings, then his power was as immediate in oneland as in another. The importance of the political element in expressions of afterlife-belief is, however,always based on the presence of a personal element: if the death and subsequent fate of aruler/hero were not expected to bear a great emotional impact, then the whole processwould become irrelevant. The ties between ruler and folk were, however, often close andpersonal, the death of a good king expected to bring sadness--a mourning which, in itself,served as a tribute to his previous (and continuing) power. In Eiríksmál, this aspect isminimalized, perhaps because of the circumstances of its composition (a memorialcommissioned from a relatively uninvolved professional, the poetic equivalent of atombstone purchased from a funeral home). In Hákonarmál, on the contrary, Eyvindr’spersonal grief makes Hákon’s reception in Valhalla all the more poignant. Eyvindr himselfhad to hear of the death of his lord--perhaps even see the shattered shield and sunderedbyrnie, the beloved body of his king all spattered with blood, as the skald describes in hispoem. The poet is, perhaps, answering his own sorrow with Skögul’s words to Hákon: hereminds himself that Hákon’s death was not in vain, for though the king died, he won thebattle. Eyvindr’s dark view of Óðinn is equally as personal. Although it is to Óðinn that heowes the art of poetry, since it is Óðinn who won and deals out the mead of inspiration, andalthough Eyvindr expects the god to receive Hákon well, it is also at Óðinn’s choice thatthe valkyries rode to take Hákon--and “to fare with Óðinn”, as Eyvindr makes clear in thefirst stanza, is to die. In Eyvindr’s poem of mourning, we can feel both that something great has passed fromthis earth and that Hákon’s death was worthwhile. Hákonarmál gave--and still gives--itshearers the same sense of ultimately tragic triumph that has made the legend of King Arthurso dear to many through the ages: a mighty struggle was fought here for a good cause, andthough the beloved hero fell with weapons in hand, he did not lose altogether; but with hisdeath, an age of glory has passed. The reality of the artist’s feeling, of course, does notlessen the political usefulness of the work: rather, it increases it, in that it lets those whoexperience his telling also experience his grief over his loss, the comfort offered by thehero’s reception in the Otherworld, and his forebodings about what will come afterwards.The Arthurian materials have been used for every political purpose possible over the lastseveral centuries--the first widely popular incarnation of the legend, Geoffrey ofMonmouth’s rendition, being in fact an outright and bold-faced work of propaganda againstKing Stephen (Geoffrey was a staunch supporter of Queen Matilda in the English civil warat that time). Hákonarmál, and indeed the belief in Valhalla as a whole, can be seen asfitting into a similar mould: what one mourner feels for a fallen hero standing at Wotan’sgates, many are likely to feel--that heady mixture of sorrow and hope, of grief and relief,offered with the einherjar-ale; and the corresponding belief in the worth of Hákon’s cause(and apparently, from Eyvindr’s account, the protection of the gods and holy places) andthe worthlessness of Eiríkr’s temple-breaking sons. To win one’s way into Valhalla, then, is to die a “good death”, but it is also something"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"55more. It is to be enshrined in holy memory, to have one’s reception among the gods foreverestablished by the words of a poet--one who may perhaps have been taken as speaking witha certain spiritual authority. Although poetry was not necessarily magical or religious in itspurpose or operation, it was perceived as a divinely inspired skill, a gift specifically givenby Óðinn; and something of this respect for the craft itself might perhaps have carried overto the subject matter, when a poet spoke of the way to the Otherworld and the fate of thedead.

(Grímnismál 20) What is remembered, lives. (Starhawk, from the Spiral Dance memorial liturgy) Among the Norse, as with many traditional cultures, the past was not seen as somethingdead and gone, powerless to shape the present--or worse, something that should be cutloose as quickly as possible. Rather, it was alive and growing, the strongest force known toNorthern thought: it was the might of Wyrd. The word Wyrd is a past form of a root verb“to become”: it can also be roughly translated as “that which has become”. However, it isusually translated as “fate”; its use is generally in the sense of inescapable destiny. Thepower of Wyrd was known to all the Germanic peoples--for instance, the Old High Germanpoem Hildebrandslied has the hero Hildebrand lamenting “Woe-Wyrd”, which has broughthim into a situation where he must fight his own son to the death or betray his sworn oaths,and even the christian Anglo-Saxon poems recognise Wyrd as a force that cannot bedenied. However, the only direct personification of Wyrd that has survived is in the Norsepoetry: the three Norns who stand by the Well of Wyrd beneath the World-Tree, where thegods also hold their council. Urðr (Wyrd) one is called, the second Verðandi - they carve on staves-- Skuld hight the third; they laid down laws, they choose life for the bairns of men, they speak destiny (Völuspá 20). Snorri describes them further: every day Urðr, Verðandi, and Skuld take the water from theWell and mix it with mud, sprinkling it over the World-Tree to heal the damage done to itby the four stags that gnaw at its bark and the many wyrms chewing at its roots. Two swansswim in the well; two bees fly above it. Although the three Northern Norns are sometimes compared to the three Grecian Fates,their characters and means of action are different. Unlike Clothos, Lachesis, and Atropos,each of whom has a different job (one spinning the life-thread, one measuring it, and onecutting it), the Norns work together, carving rune-staves and setting the destinies ofhumans. The names of the second and third Norns do not, as they are sometimes interpretedto do, indicate “present” and “future”: “Verðandi” means, roughly, “Becoming”, and“Skuld” can be best translated as “Necessity”. They are, clearly, reflections from, orperhaps aspects of Wyrd, the embodiment of the living and ever-growing realm of “thatwhich has become”. The very way in which the Germanic peoples thought about time is strikingly differentfrom the conceptions of modern thought: they did not perceive a set past, present, andfuture, but rather thought in a binary manner: there was “that which has become” and “thatwhich is becoming”. This view of time is reflected in the basic structure of the Germaniclanguages. Even in modern English, there is no true future tense, as there is, for instance, inLatin. To speak of the future, a modal auxiliary must be added: you can say, “I went to thestore” or “I go to the store”, but to indicate that this lies in the future, it has to be somethinglike, “I shall go to the store”. These modal auxiliaries can indicate something that isestablished as necessary to occur, “should”, or that is desired to occur, “will”, but the future"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"58is not a set thing: it is merely a shadow cast by that which has already happened--by Wyrd.Bauschatz compares the Germanic view sharply with Augustine’s definition of tripartitepast/present/future created time, in which the desire is to rid oneself of the past--to be “bornagain”--and press forward to a glorious future at the side of Christ, observing thedifficulties of reconciling the two. It is also clear . . . that the Christianization of the pagan Germanic peoples eventually must have created very great conceptual problems for them. The temporal reorientation towards the future, which the Christian conception stresses so strongly, involved a 180-degree wrench away from the past towards a future that did not even exist prior to Christianity . . . Repentance and absolution involve a moment in which the sins of the past are confronted, repented of, and, in effect, washed away. The absolved individual at this moment enters a state of grace; the past disappears, and he is born anew. How the Germanic peoples must have struggled with the idea that the past could ever disappear! Even after christianization, the Well of Wyrd--the embodiment of the active force ofthat-which-has-become--remained the source of world-shaping might: after his conversion,the skald Eilífr Goðrúnarson wrote, “Thus has Rome’s strong king set his might over therocky bergs; he is said to sit southwards at Wyrd’s well.” The names had changed: it wouldtake christianity much longer to root out the basic beliefs and destroy the worldview of thenative Scandinavian culture. With a worldview based, first and foremost, on the prevalence of Wyrd, the intensity ofthe importance set on memory by the Germanic peoples can be understood: memory is themeans by which Wyrd can be known and the shapes of Becoming and Necessity--Verðandiand Skuld--seen in her reflection. Another aspect of the great Well of the Norse is Mímir’sWell--the well guarded by the jötunn Mímir, whose name stems from a word for“Memory”. The great seeress of Völuspá says that, “I know, Óðinn, where you hid youreye, in the famous Well of Mímir. Mímir drinks mead every morning from Slain-Father’spledge” (Völuspá 28). Snorri tells us that Óðinn gave his eye for a draught from the Well ofMímir, in which all wisdom is kept; but the seeress’ words can be read as telling us a littlemore--that Wotan’s hidden eye is not lost or given away, but merely concealed; and that,gazing ever into the Memory-Well, it is one of the chief sources of his might. Later in theseeress’ prophecy, she speaks of Óðinn going to seek counsel from Mímir’s head (verse 46)as the end of the world nears. Thus, memory is that which explains the moment ofbecoming and shows what must necessarily follow on: it is the key to the whole of being. It is, thus, not surprising that, of Wotan’s two ravens, it is Muninn--the one whichremembers--for whose safety the god fears most when he sends them out over the worlds insearch of news. To be without, not only personal memory, but the cultural memory oflegends and history, or the family memory embodied by the knowledge and worship of theforebears who are still present as guiding spirits or reborn in the descendants who bear theirnames, would have been an unthinkable horror to the early Scandinavians, just as it still isto tribal peoples such as the Dagara today. Nevertheless, after the many generationsfollowing the conversion, those memories were indeed lost, to a greater or lesser degree, bymost descendants of Germanic people. The results of that loss are observed by MalidomaSomé from his own tribal perspective--a perspective having a great deal in common withthat of the early Germanic peoples: “It is my belief that the present state of restlessness thattraps the modern individual has its roots in a dysfunctional relationship with the ancestors.In many non-Western cultures, the ancestors have an intimate and absolutely vitalconnection with the world of the living. They are always available to guide, to teach, and tonurture . . . Most importantly -- and paradoxically -- they embody the guidelines forsuccessful living -- all that is most valuable about life.” Modern American society carries the Western/christian separation of the past and pushtowards the future to its farthest extremes. A portion of this attitude has been intrinsic in theideology of the country since its founding: the desire to leave the Old World behind, tocreate a new society and press on into new frontiers. A portion of it stems from the shortduration of Western settlement in America: in most parts of the U.S.A., for instance, a"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"59building that is an hundred years old is an historical monument. In Europe, such a buildingis hardly worth noticing. The most decisive blow to the modern Western sense of any sort of continuity with thepast, however, has probably been the pervasive effect of television, which, to a considerabledegree, acts to block family communication and to shift the interest of its viewers from thereal to the entertaining. In his chilling study of the effects of television among the Dene (aNative Canadian people, who had only recently gotten access to TV), Jerry Manderobserves, among other things, the near-total breakdown of the storytelling tradition whichhad been a vital and universal part of the Dene culture for over five thousand years--themeans of transmitting not only the tales themselves, but the sense of community theyembodied and the spirituality which they taught. In a visit to a school in the town of Rae, towhich television had only come two years previously, “I began by asking the kids abouttheir TV viewing habits . . . every home now had one . . . I asked how many of the childrenhad parents who attempted to control the viewing by setting times or selecting programs, orby turning it off altogether at a certain hour. Only two kids raised their hands. I asked howmany of their families were still telling stories at night. There was no response. Televisionhad apparently taken over in Rae, suddenly and totally.” The general American ignorance of even recent American history is appalling: as arecent article in the International Herald Tribune observed, according to a study by theNational Assessment of Educational Progress, “More than half of American high schoolseniors lack basic knowledge of U.S history . . . And they are unable to use their spottyknowledge to reason, analyze, or back up opinions”. The general American ignorance ofworld history is in even worse condition, going beyond appalling to unbelievable. And theabsence of a past, as Malidoma Somé observes, is, effectively, the absence of both a solididentity and a solid spirituality. The ability to remember, on the other hand, may be considered one of the chief hallmarksof a living, healthy culture. It is no surprise that most traditional cultures have specialfigures who are designated as the chief keepers of the tribal memory, as, for instance, arethe elders of the Dagara and the shamans of the Buryat, Yakut, and Kazak Kirgiz. TheGermanic peoples, being a generally settled agricultural culture with a large-scale socialsystem, had both the economic surplus and the motivation to support a class of professionalpoets who could not only recite old tales, but also regularly compose new poems for thepurpose of memorializing their patrons--the latter being apparently the chief duty of theNorse court skald. Although Germanic heroic poems often contain supernatural elements,their primary purpose is as memorials of persons and events: the earliest accounts ofGermanic vocal performance, given by Tacitus in his Germania and Annals, show thatGerman composition was largely narrative and commemorative (the tale of the godMannus, father of the three great Germanic tribes; the deeds of Hermann the Cheruscan; therecollection of the visit of “Hercules”). In his study Anglo-Saxon Oral Poetry, Opland alsocites Jordanes’ History of the Goths description of the poetry or songs of the Goths aseulogistic, as well as several other sources listing this as the chief orientation of earlyGermanic oral poetry. The early songs of memory fulfilled a number of practical purposes. They served toinspire living warriors with the deeds of those who had gone before, thereby preservingcultural continuity by preparing men to live up to the deeds of their forefathers. Tacituscomments that “They further record how Hercules appeared among the Germans, and onthe eve of battle, the natives hymn, “Hercules, the first of brave men.”” Such songs orpoems taught men how to handle themselves in battle, in victory, in defeat, and in death. The use of memorial songs, epic poems, and legends as cultural paradigms, however,was not limited to the field of battle. As seen so poignantly in Hákonarmál, the memorialwas not merely about death: it was a summing up of all that was worthy in the deadperson’s life. Dying after his last battle, Beowulf speaks his own memorial--a paradigm fora good ruler: “I held this folk, fifty winters . . . . . . On earth I abode"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"60 the time shaped for me held well what was mine, never sought treacherous quarrel nor swore I many oaths unrightly. For all this I may -- though sick with life-wound -- have joy”.(lines 2731-40). He then calls for Wiglaf to heap up the treasure he has won in his mortal fight with thedragon, that he may see it before his death, and concludes, “Tell my battle-friends to raise a howe, bright after bale-fire at the sea’s headland: it shall stand to remind my folk, lifted high on Whale’s Ness so that sea-travellers shall call it afterwards Beowulf’s Mound when the ships over flooding waves drive from afar” (lines 2802-08). The social function of memorials, then, can be seen as going far beyond exhortations tomake a good death: they also define what is good in life--what is worthy of remembrance. At the same time, memorials serve as the specific link between the living and the dead.As mentioned in the previous chapter, the memorial poem for the hero going to Valhalladefines his afterlife. It is not only the description of his reception among the gods, but thevehicle bearing him there--his own ship of words crossing the dark waters of death. Thesame may well have been true of the Gotlandic picture stones, which appear to depictvisually what Eyvindr and the Eiríksmál composer depicted in their poetry: death and thepathway to the Otherworld, the greeting at the door of Wotan’s hall, and the reception intothe company of heroes. The connection between Eyvindr and Hákon the Good did notbreak with Hákon’s death. Rather, the skald whose duty had been to tell the deeds of hisking in life was able to continue that duty after Hákon fell--understanding that even thoughHákon no longer trod the earth of this world, his being continued, not only undiminished,but made greater by his passage into Valhalla. The act of creating a memorial, particularlyone which describes the dead person’s continuance into the afterlife, is also the act ofpreserving the relationship between the dead and the living, even as it eases thatrelationship onto a different plane of interaction. The memorial is also the means of preserving the existence of the dead past the memoryof the living. Without memorials of some sort, as our forebears knew, names and deeds arequickly forgotten: but a song or tale that endures, or a carven stone, is sure to keep the deadperson’s name known and living, and the more who hear or see it, the better. For thisreason, memorial stones were often placed near roads rather than on burial mounds--andusually raised by the relatives of the deceased as a last act of love, as described by Wotan inHávamál 72: A son is better though he be born after the man is gone; seldom memory-stones stand near the road, unless kinsman raise them for kin.At the same time, memorials of those long-gone also served the living, by keeping themaware of what had gone before and constantly reminding them of their roots--of the essenceand pattern of their being. This was true both in regards to great heroes of legend/the distantpast (historical accuracy is not necessarily to be sought over five hundred years of long-distance transmission of an oral tradition) and in regards to one’s own personal family. Folkof good lineage could, indeed, commission poems detailing the most important informationabout their clan: names, chief deeds, deaths, and places of burial. Such a poem isYnglingatal (Tally of the Ynglings), which recounts the history of a line of early Swedishkings, apparently tracing their eventual migration from the area around Uppsala and Vendel"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"61to Norway, as a few sample verses show:(5) That was in early days, when the sword-bearers reddened the earth with their drighten, and the land-army bore bloodied weapons from Domaldi’s body, when the harvest-greedy Swede-clan should sacrifice the foe of Jóti.(6) And I have often asked wise men about Yngvi’s corpse, where Dómarr was borne onto the roaring bane of Hóalfr (funeral pyre); now I know that the sickness-dead descendant of Fjölnir was burned beside the Fyris . . .

(35) And the descendant-branch of Thórr’s strength had thrived greatly in Norway; Óláfrruled in elder days over Upsa’s wide land and Vestmar, together with Grenland’s folk,like to the gods.(36) Footwork should bring the friend of men to Fold’s (Earth’s) rim; the battle-brave army-king lies in a howe at Geirstaðr.This poem both supports and supplements the cult of the dead, especially the aspect of thecult which focuses on the burial place: even when the Ynglings no longer dwell beside theriver Fyris, in their holy hold at Uppsala, they know where their dead are laid and how theydied--and thus they know who they themselves are, and everyone who hears the poem canbe duly awed by the mighty weight of Wyrd the descendants of Domaldi and Óláfr (amongthe many other great kings whose line ultimately led back to the god Freyr, or Yngvi) bear. On a personal level, the active forging of the memorial link between the living and thedead was one of the most important and constructive means of dealing with grief,particularly in cases where there was no chance to seek either legal or personal redress(death by accident or sickness, for instance). The Germanic peoples were keenly aware ofthe need for the bereaved to express grief, as seen in the First Lay of Guðrún. After thekilling of Sigurðr, Guðrún will not weep: the women of the court know that she must findan expression for her grief, and rehearse their own sorrows at her until one of them advisesher to kiss her husband as if he were still alive. She embraces Sigurðr’s corpse, and hertears are able to flow at last, after which she is able to regain control of her own life, evenphysically escaping from the unreasonable demands of her family for a time. Brynhildr,however, will not weep; instead, she kills herself, and her body is burned beside Sigurðr’s.The contrast between the two--the sane Guðrún who is able to mourn appropriately and thedisturbed Brynhildr whose response to Guðrún’s cry of grief (as described in Völsungasaga) is wild laughter and for whom the sole conceivable response to Sigurðr’s death issuicide--could not be greater, nor could it better express the Northern understanding of theneed to mourn. As observed by Lovette, it is usually the presence of the ritualized memorial whichmakes it possible to express and direct grief: “Some of the most significant psychologicalfunctions of ritualized memorials are the granting of permission to grieve, healthmaintenance through provision of basic daily activities of daily living that can be neglectedor inappropriately attended (eating, dressing, solace through companionship, feeling, etc.),the mental land marking of the significance of the loss by community, affirmation ofcontinuity of life for the bereaved, a public valuing of the deceased’s importance, andprovision of space for moving in and out of grieving. The global psychological product isthe provision of emotional containment for the bereaved and “good enough” incorporationof loss, allowing for the re-emergence of the non-grieving and emotionally stable self” -- asis the case with Guðrún, who, in due course, becomes a notable heroine in her own right(unlike her weak Wagnerian incarnation, Gutrune, whose natural mourning is abbreviatedand pushed aside by Brünnhilde’s lengthy eulogy of Siegfried and the old world which hasjust come to an end)."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"62 We know that the Norse, as well as recognising the vital importance of expressing grief,were directly aware of the therapeutic quality of memorialization--much as Lovettedescribes it--from an example in Egils saga. Here it must be noted that the saga was writtensome three hundred years after most of the events in it, serving as a lengthy proseframework to the poems (which themselves are not universally accepted as attributable tothe persons traditionally credited for composing them). What is relevant here, however, isthe process of grief, anger, and final acceptance of death expressed by the memorial poemitself and the sagaman’s perception of both the power of memorializing and the emotionalprocess undergone by the bereaved. Thus, whether the account is taken as fact, as fiction, or(perhaps most sensibly) as something in-between, it can in any case be read as directlyexpressing a function and process which were understood by early Scandinavians, andwhich, as other examples have already shown us, were a vital part of the maintenance ofmental health in a culture and environment in which the awareness of death wascontinuously present. According to the saga, in the course of his long life, Egill has already seen the deaths ofhis parents, brother (killed fighting for the English king Æthelstan), and eldest son (whohad died of a fever), and borne up under these usual burdens as well as anyone mightexpect of a stoic Viking. However, when his second and favourite son, Böðvarr, is drownedat sea, Egill goes himself to see the corpse, which he then takes up and sets on his knee,riding back to the burial mound of his father, where he also lays his son. After burying hisson, Egill shuts himself up his sleeping closet and lies there without food or drink, readyinghimself for death. At last, on the third day, his daughter Thórgerðr, having been sent newsof her father’s situation, comes to the house, saying that she has not eaten her evening meal,nor will she until she comes to Freyja, “I know no better advice than my father’s; I will notlive after my father and brother.” Egill then lets her into the sleeping closet. After a whilehe hears her chewing and wonders what it is. Thórgerðr says that she is chewing seaweed toshorten her life. “It is bad for one?” Egill says. “Very bad,” she answers. “Will you eat?”The seaweed, as Thórgerðr had known full well it would, makes them thirsty; they then callfor drink, and are given milk instead of water. Then Thórgerðr says, “What shall we now take for counsel? These plans are now at an end. Now I wish,father, that we lengthen our life, so that you may make a memorial poem after Böðvarr, andI shall carve it on a piece of wood, and after that we shall die, if it seems best to us. I expect that it will be a long time before your son Thórsteinn makes a poem after Böðvarr, and it will not do if he does not have a funeral feast, though I do not expect us to sit at that drinking when his memory is toasted.” Egill said that it should not be expected that he would be able to work, although he would try it, “and I may be able to try it,” he said . . . And this is the beginning of the poem.1. Greatly unwilling am I to move my tongue or the air-weight of songs’ steelyard; there is no good hope of Viðurr’s (Óðinn’s) theft (poetry), nor does it come gladly forth from the hiding-place of soul. 2.

The therapy offered to Egill by the act of memorializing his son and thereby workingthrough his own feelings about, not only his grief, but his own impending death isespecially relevant because of the circumstances. Although folk of the Viking Age arelikely to have had much less emotional investment in young children than we do, due to thehigh mortality rates, the attachment to an adult child was at least as strong--perhapsstronger. An Icelander’s adult child was not only the embodiment of his parents’ hopes forthe future, he was also, as verse 12 describes, an ally and assistant in every respect--political, personal, and in terms of daily activity. Egill’s unrestrained and suicidal responseto Böðvarr’s death is little different from the responses of parents today who lose theirchildren: “The typical experience of parental grief after a child’s death closely resembleswhat is considered to be “unresolved” or “abnormal” grief after the deaths of others”. Hisdecision that there is no point in living further suggests a deep sense of failure--he could notprotect his son from death, and he cannot take revenge upon the sea. The memorial poem,as the saga explicitly states, offers Egill a reason to continue to live: it is the last gift he cangive to his son, and he, the famed poet, is the only one who can do it properly. In addition to the social and spiritual functions discussed above, the act of making amemorial also--as told to us by Egill’s words, echoing from more than a millennium deepin the Well of Wyrd--serves to redefine the bereaved survivor in the face of an immediateconfrontation with death, and prepare the survivor for meeting his or her own end. Theawareness of his own impending death is heavier than usual for Egill, because, for the oldViking as for a modern parent, “The death of a child multiplies the losses to self usually feltafter the death of any close person. This is true not only because of the numerousinvestments placed in the child, but because mourning for the child means mourning for theself as well, since parental attachment is built upon a mixture of love for the child and self-love”. To Egill, this feeling was further intensified because so much of the individualidentity of the early Scandinavian was bound in with family-identity. His personal sense ofexperiencing the “mutilation” felt by a parent losing a child is projected onto his ownfamily, which he envisions as a rotting tree in stanza 4, then, in stanza 6, with the terriblypoignant image of a pasture surrounded by a protective wall of rough Icelandic stone (the“kin-garth”), in which a wave has broken a gaping hole that can never be filled. Therefore,he is mourning not only Böðvarr, but also his parents, his brother, his previously lost sonGunnarr--and, most of all, himself. While Egill does not follow the precise outline of the Kubler-Ross “five stages” ofterminal acceptance--denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance --his generalpersonal progression in the course of the poem is not too far different. He begins byrecounting his state of shock and psychological numbness: it is nearly impossible for him,great poet that he is, to even begin to speak, let alone to compose. This is followed almostimmediately by anger: he rages against Rán and Ægir, the two giants (wife and husbandrespectively) who personify the sea, especially in its wilder and harsher aspects. He would"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"67take revenge against them if he could: they are living beings who have treated him cruelly,and it is his nature to fight back. After another interlude of recounting his losses, Egillcalms himself by considering what he has gotten in return for his services to Óðinn--to thegod of death, who he sees as having claimed his kin. Although this is not “bargaining” inthe classic sense--Egill is neither asking Óðinn for any further favours nor promisinganything--it is closely related: the bargain has already taken place, and Egill considershimself to have come out well. And indeed he has: the gift of poetry which Óðinn gave himhas indeed been “bettering for ills”, being the vehicle of his self-analysis and emotionalhealing. Lastly comes acceptance: the aging man sees Hel, the embodiment of theUnderworld, standing on the headland, and can say that he awaits her “glad, with a goodwill, and unfearing”. This process is partially helped, of course, by the poet’s genius and capability of self-analysis and self-expression. It is also, however, strengthened by the presence of a strongcultural and religious framework which gives Egill a setting in which to place the whole ofhis experience of grief and thus integrate the life-shattering trauma which he has justsuffered. Skaldic poems frequently refer to the art of poetry itself in terms of the holy drinkwhich Wotan stole from the etins and gave to humankind: in both Höfuðlausn (Head-Ransom) and Arinbjarnarkviða (a poem in honour of his friend Arinbjörn), Egill speaksproudly of bringing Óðinn’s mead with him. Now, it appears in a sorrowfully ironiccontext: instead of bearing the gift of the gods, Egill finds it hard to come by--and yet theact of describing the mead of inspiration itself seems to open the tap. The image of the“ship of the dwarf” (a kenning for the poetic mead, referring to an episode in its history)fades neatly into the Norse account of the creation of the world, which explains that the seais the blood which flowed from the wounds of the proto-giant Ymir; and this, in turn,becomes the waves that roar beneath the burial mound of Egill’s father and son--the “boat-house” from which Skalla-Grímr and Böðvarr have begun their faring to the Otherworld. This pattern continues throughout the poem: the religious/cosmological balances thehuman and gives it both perspective and meaning. As Sonatorrek began with the creation ofthe world, so it concludes with its end: the final kenning for Óðinn is “the foe of the Wolf”,referring to the last battle when the Wolf Fenrir shall devour the god, and Egill calls Hel“the sister of Tveggi’s foe”--that is, the sister of Óðinn’s enemy, which is Fenrir. He thusruefully reminds himself that even his god must die someday: the world goes on and Wyrdworks as she must. Having thus placed the deaths of his kin, and his own death, into thenecessary pattern of being, Egill is able to accept them and continue. This, too, is part of thebasic function of memorialization in dealing with grief. The act of memorializing allowsdeath to be integrated into a pattern, ideally a pattern which provides support andreassurance both in a social context--as Thórgerðr’s words make clear, by composing amemorial poem, Egill has now done a socially proper and expected thing, as a less giftedman might have done by, for instance, having a runestone raised after the dead--and in areligious context: that is to say, a context which simultaneously aligns the microcosm andthe macrocosm (the world began with Ymir’s death and ends with Wotan’s; the deaths ofEgill’s kin, and of the poet himself, are equally inevitable and part of the process of being)and offers individual reassurance (Egill’s sons have been taken up by Óðinn; they dwellwith their kinfolk). In the lengthy history of memorial-making, there have been few effortswhich have achieved this goal so effectively and so beautifully. In modern times, the process of memorialization by setting the dead into the context ofthe past has not been entirely lost, though the forms in which it appears vary a great deal.One of the best examples can be seen in the Battlefield Park in Vicksburg, Mississippi.Among the states’ monuments to their dead stands the “Temple of Fame”, a massivebuilding modelled after the Roman Pantheon, with the names of all the Illinois soldiers whotook part in the Vicksburg campaign inscribed upon sixty bronze tablets. Even though theraisers of that monument were most unlikely to have been Classical pagans, the message isclear: those who fought there have been judged in terms of the great ones of earlier times,and found worthy. The use of individual creativity in memorialization as a means of both making a worthymonument for the dead and healing the living is especially notable today in the great AIDSQuilt, a massive collection of memorial panels made by the friends and loved ones of those"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"68who have died of AIDS. The Quilt has become a national symbol of the link between thedead and the living. It is one of the most direct and active mass recognitions of the need ofthe dying to know that they will be remembered--the cry “Remember my name!” couldhave sprung as easily from the heart of any fallen Viking as from that of an AIDS sufferer--and of the survivors to express the worth of those who are lost. Regarding the particularform this memorial has taken, as one of the original contributors to the first display inWashington, DC, Jim Lovette notes that, Quilts have been traditional in many American and other cultures, providing a link to our immediate ancestors and to a repository of highly charged socio cultural symbols and ideas. The thought of being comforted is strongly linked to quilts, as the metaphors of being warmed, made safe, and prepared for a period of time when we are most vulnerable is associated with quilts. The direct transfer of the energy in these metaphors is smooth and fluid, resulting in virtual identification with the Quilt on an enormous scale, which is the primary reason for its popularity and success. The creativity permitted by making, displaying, and seeing a specific quilt is psychologically one of the most intensive and effective healing methods to arise from the fight against AIDS. The memorial services of people whose lifestyles do not necessarily find mainstreamacceptance, whether for religious, sexual, or political reasons, are also particularlyinteresting in the context of creative memorialization, as they are often composed by theimmediate friends and local co-religionists of the deceased. From his extensive experienceas both a Celtic Wiccan Elder and a gay psychotherapist living in San Francisco, JimLovette observes that, while the general absence of personal preparation for death inWestern culture causes most people to default to the usual death and dying rituals ofwhatever religious tradition they were raised in, the communities in which such specificterminal illnesses as HIVD/AIDS and breast cancer have brought a heightened awarenessof mortality have tended to develop individual styles of anticipatory grieving and death/dying rituals, attempting to address the loss of the self or of significant others. These grieving styles range from the eccentric to the mundane and have been shaped heavily by non-Western and non-Judeo-Christo-Islamic philosophies. The resulting rituals have therefore been influenced largely by esoteric, New Age, tribal, pagan, Eastern, and Wiccan beliefs and practices. In particular, such rituals often include portions of older memorial poems, which serveto place the dead in the context of the ancient religion and world-view--and also, likeEgill’s references to the winning of the mead of poetry at the beginning of Sonatorrek, helpto provide a framework which can control and direct otherwise inexpressible feelings ofgrief. As described by Melodi Lammond, (Jerry’s funeral service) was very eclectic. Nearly everything in it was from an ancestraltradition, but there were a lot of different traditions involved..Jerry’s lover was a Pomo Indian, and he taught the women a traditional Pomo mourning chant. A member of the circle who was African had his head ritually shaved. Jerry’s daughter covered all the mirrors in the house, which is a Jewish tradition, even though they were not Jewish. I wrote a piece based on the lament of Deirdre for the sons of Oishin (an Old Irishlament). I was too upset and freaked to write anything completely original, although I often do write original pieces. I just couldn’t do this. Then I realized that other people had been through this before . . . I remembered reading the lament in a historical novel, andrealized that with just a few changes in the words, it would fit the deceased. I left most ofthe original imagery in, but also translated some of it into modern terms, because I feltthat as a Wiccan high priest and union organizer, Jerry had walked between the past"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"69and the present. Also, the idea was to mourn and express our grief for this person, notthe one who had died two thousand years before. (personal conversation, Oct. 30, 1995) One of the few exceptions to the “homemade” character of neo-Pagan burial rites--thefuneral service offered by the Ring of Troth in their handbook Our Troth (full text inAppendix 2)--is an attempt to recreate something similar to what a Viking Age funeralmight have been like, based on archaeological, literary, and folkloric sources.Characteristically for modern Germanic heathenry, the ritual itself is preceded by a citationof its sources so that those who perform it can fully understand the ritual actions and thus,presumably, come closer to their forebears: the formal affirmation of the unity of past andpresent is also a formal affirmation of the continuing link between the living and the dead.When I saw this ritual performed, at Midsummer of 1994, it was slightly altered in that thedeceased, Lionel Hornby, had already been cremated: his widow Freya Aswynn and theirfriends performed the rite around a six-foot replica of a Viking boat, which they then set onfire and launched at Maldon, the site of one of the most famous battles of the Saxons andVikings (commemorated in the Old English poem The Battle of Maldon, a portion of whichwas quoted during the funeral service). Freya wanted to send Lionel off in this mannerbecause he was “the last of the Saxons”, to be ranked with both the kings of Sutton Hooand Vendel (buried in their ships) and the Anglo-Saxon leader Bryhtnoth, who had let theViking host cross the causeway in order to allow a fair fight (Bryhtnoth lost, but his name isremembered and the name of the Viking leader forgotten, while to one of his men isattributed the statement that summed up the ideal mood of the Germanic warrior: “Soulshall grow the harder, heart the keener, bravery the greater, as our strength grows less”). The usage of archaic imagery in order to create a context and framework forunderstanding and integrating a death can also be particularly useful in times of nationaltragedy. My wife and I moved to Uppsala, Sweden two days after the sinking of the Estonia(which took place on September 28, 1994. The final official death toll was slightly undernine hundred), at which time the country was still in a state of tremendous grief and shock.Although we had not lost anyone on the ferry ourselves, both the scale and circumstancesof the catastrophe itself and the distress of those around us affected us very profoundly: inparticular, I was haunted by the recurring image of Ingvi-Freyr, the national god of theSwedes and father of the Yngling line, standing by the great mounds at Old Uppsala andweeping for his lost children. Eventually I was able to find a place for these feelings bywriting a song in which I described the Estonia’s sinking as an early Scandinavian wouldhave seen it (full text in Appendix I), adapting lines both from the Eddic poem Hávamáland, in the verse below, from Sonatorrek: If men could bear swords to sea as their foe, Ægir would brew no more ale. His bride has slit the strands of our clan, been bane to our mothers beloved, and death to our children dear.The sorrow is still with me, but I was able to sleep at night again, and whenever I performthe song, I feel that I have done what I can: I am keeping the memory alive, lest those whodied be forgotten--or carelessness allow another such tragedy. The overlap of personal and national memorialization is, no doubt, as old as the firsttribe who buried their dead together: though today it may be faced with certain difficulties,it still continues to be a matter of considerable significance, not least of all politically. At itsbest, national memorialization yet serves the purpose it did in the earliest days: to unify, toexemplify, and to allow an appropriate outlet for private feelings within the context of thelarger group. On the greatest scale, we find national monuments such as WestminsterAbbey in Britain and the less well-known, but nevertheless impressive, Walhalla inGermany. The latter is a hall set up in the early part of this century to honour Germanheroes and persons of accomplishment, beginning with Hermann the Cheruscan (whodefeated the Romans at the Battle of Teutoberger Wald in 9 C.E., thereby saving Germany"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"70from the fate of occupied Gaul) and the Veleda (a German seeress of roughly the sameperiod, whose advice guided the tribe of the Bructeri to victory over the Romans) to literaryfigures such as Goethe and Schiller. Towering high on a hilltop, lined inside with the bustsand names of the chief creators of German history and culture, it is an awesome edifice. Westminster Abbey is even more overwhelming: the chief burial place of the kings andqueens of England from the time of Edward the Confessor onward, it has also been thecoronation stead for every English sovereign since William the Bastard (or Conqueror)onward (except for Edward V in the fifteenth century and Edward VIII in the twentieth),thus maintaining a living continuity between the royal dead and their successors (even theservice itself, though it has been elaborated on since, can be directly traced back to St.Dunstan’s coronation of King Edgar in 973, which was probably based on earlier services).The Abbey became even more significant, however, in the eighteenth century, when,“burial in the Abbey seemed appropriate for anyone, irrespective of birth or rank, who hadmade a notable contribution to the life of the nation and perhaps to the welfare of thehuman race as a whole”. Among those who lie there now are Rudyard Kipling, CharlesDarwin, Ernest Rutherford, and David Livingstone. Memorial plaques also stand to, amongothers, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill, whose inscription is particularlytelling both in what it says--and in what it does not need to:   REMEMBER  WINSTON CHURCHILL  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WISHES OF  THE QUEEN AND PARLIAMENT  THE DEAN AND CHARTER PLACED THIS STONE  ON THE TWENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF  THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN  15 SEPTEMBER 1965Westminster Abbey serves, in quite a literal sense, as Britain’s Valhalla: the hall of thehonoured dead, whose deeds will be remembered as long as the Abbey--and Britain--stand. This is shown, above all, by the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey,whose inscription reads,  BENEATH THIS STONE RESTS THE BODY  OF A BRITISH WARRIOR  UNKNOWN BY NAME OR RANK  BROUGHT BACK FROM FRANCE TO LIE AMONG  THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS OF THE LAND  AND BURIED HERE ON ARMISTICE DAY  11 NOVEMBER 1920, IN THE PRESENCE OF  HIS MAJESTY KING GEORGE  HIS MINISTERS OF STATE  THE CHIEFS OF HIS FORCES  AND A VAST CONCOURSE OF THE NATION  THUS ARE COMMEMORATED THE MANY  MULTITUDES WHO DURING THE GREAT  WAR OF 1914-1918 GAVE THE MOST THAT  MAN CAN GIVE LIFE ITSELF   FOR GOD  FOR KING AND COUNTRY  FOR LOVED ONES HOME AND EMPIRE  FOR THE SACRED CAUSE OF JUSTICE AND  THE FREEDOM OF THE WORLD THEY BURIED HIM AMONG THE KINGS BECAUSE HE  HAD DONE GOOD TOWARDS GOD AND TOWARD"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"71   HIS HOUSEAt the time of the Unknown Warrior’s internment, he served as a focal point of themourning of all those Britons who had lost loved ones in World War I--especially thosewhose sons, husbands, or fathers were buried in unknown graves in foreign lands.Reaffirming the unity of the present with the past, as well, King George V gave aCrusader’s sword from his own private collection, which was attached to the top of thecoffin --thus setting the Unknown Warrior, and all the British dead, in the same rank as themen who were at that time seen as the paragons of chivalry. On the day of his burial, “KingGeorge V unveiled the Cenotaph . . . and stood in silence for two minutes; a silence whichwas to be observed throughout the country and the empire . . . By the end of the day, over200,000 people had passed the Cenotaph and had also visited the Unknown Warrior’s finalresting place at the Abbey to pay their respects, and over 10,000 wreaths were laid at thenew, unveiled Cenotaph. The nation mourned; cities, towns, and villages, all who had senttheir men in their country’s hour of need, mourned their passing.” Today, the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior stands as a symbol of the British people: italways bears fresh flowers, and all heads of foreign states making official visits to Londoncome to Westminister Abbey to lay a wreath upon it. It is the only stone in the Abbey onwhich no one is allowed to tread. Even now, a long lifetime after the burial of theUnknown Warrior, it is not easy to gaze upon his grave and remain unmoved: the slab ofblack marble bears a huge freight of the dead, made known only as a gathered host of theslain, through the stone that names the war they fell in--but sets them among the kings andgreat ones of their land, in England’s own Valhalla. To most, if not all, folk today, there is little difficulty in honouring the UnknownWarrior, or letting his grave serve as a memorial to all those who fell in the Great War. Butwhen his epitaph is read closely--and understood, as it should be, as a fairly exact andliteral description of how the British felt about the war at the time, including the deliberateequation of the Unknown Warrior with the Crusaders by means of King George’s gift of theCrusader sword--it raises a more difficult problem of the modern day: the problem ofmemorializing those who fought and fell in battles that are harder to construe as havingbeen “for the sacred cause of justice and the freedom of the world.” This problem existsprecisely because of the nature of the memorial: it serves to honour what is good, toencourage what is desired, and to affirm the ideal pattern of the world--by either positivereinforcement, as seen in the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, or negative reinforcement, asin, for instance the Holocaust memorials, which condemn the Nazi regime even as theycommemorate its victims. War memorials throughout Europe and America reflect this: it isdifficult to find, for instance, a World War I monument for someone who did not die, notonly bravely and well, but for a cause defined in the memorial as good. A similar usage canbe found in Northern Ireland, where “the political dead are regarded as symbolising thestrongest and most vibrant elements of the political culture. To remember the dead is toapprove of the dead, and to approve of the dead is to condone the elements of the ideologywith which they are now associated.” The most blatant recent example of the problem of separating the soldier from his causecame at the fortieth anniversary of the end of World War II, when President Reaganproposed to lay a wreath in a World War II cemetery in Bitburg, Germany--a cemeterywhere, it turned out, a number of soldiers that had fought in the Waffen-S.S. were buried.After forty years, most Americans were ready to concede that perhaps all German soldiershad not been Nazi ogres--that many, probably most, had been drafted into a war for whichthey were not responsible and fought for a regime whose horrors were, by and largeunknown to them; and that some reconciliation with the dead could take place. The issuewas, however, still a very sensitive one on both sides. In America, the idea of an officialmemorial recognition of men who had actively supported the Nazi regime was beyond whatliving memory could accept: the House voted resoundingly against the wreath-laying (390to 26), and the Senate also passed a voice vote against it. In contrast, a German publicopinion poll showed that 72% of West German adults thought that Reagan should go aheadwith the ceremony--an attitude expressed most strongly by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, to"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"72whom the symbolic reconciliation of the Western world with Germany’s recent past wasclearly a matter of the most intense concern, both on political and personal levels. Theintention of the wreath-laying, and its apparent meaning to the German public, was toofficially recognise the humanity of the German war dead, as made clear in Reagan’sspeech: “The crimes of the S.S. must rank among the most heinous in human history. Butothers buried there were simply soldiers in the German army . . . The evil world of Nazismturned all values upside down. Nevertheless, we can mourn the German war dead as humanbeings, crushed by a vicious ideology.” A large percentage of the American public,however, was not prepared to make that recognition: the wounds, especially for Holocaustsurvivors, were too deep, the memories too strong. Interestingly, the question was not a matter of the deeds of the soldier buried in thespecific grave, nor even of the history of the Waffen-SS men buried there, but simply oneof image. The SS men in question were elite fighters, not concentration-camp guards; it isexceedingly unlikely likely that the soldier on whose grave Reagan laid the wreath or anyof his companions in the graveyard had been directly involved with any of the chiefhorrendous atrocities for which the Nazi regime is known. It was, however, the politicalsymbol that mattered: the desired message of an historical reconciliation with the vastmajority of Germans who had been innocent of the appalling deeds of their government andwho themselves had been among the chief victims of the war’s fighting could not betransmitted to Americans by a wreath laid in this particular cemetery, regardless of how thesoldier himself had fallen. The general American sentiment regarding the matter wasexpressed by a statement in the Los Angeles Times, “Those who protest the Bitburg trip donot seek to give offence. Their wish is only that the President of the U.S. do nothing thatcould be interpreted as memorializing or dignifying the agents of Nazi criminality.” Reagan’s response to the concerns was to schedule a memorial trip to Bergen-Belsen, atwhich he concluded with the statement, “We are the witnesses”, and, similarly, to promisethe survivors of the Holocaust (in regards to the wreath-laying at Bitburg), “Many of youare worried that reconciliation means forgetting . . . But I promise you, we will neverforget.” Some might consider this the highest point in Reagan’s career as President. For arare and powerful moment in the modern world, it became clear that memory is the onlycoin of lasting worth, the only comfort and the only recompense. Seen in this light, it islittle wonder that the visit to Bitburg stirred such a furor: the act of memorialization, forthat moment, served both to awaken the past and to define the ideals and beliefs of thepresent, thereby shaping the way for what would follow afterwards. A different answer to the problem of memorializing dead soldiers without necessarilyglorifying their cause is offered by the Vietnam memorial--a huge wall of black marblebearing only the names of the dead. Despite the original controversy over its design, thestrength of this memorial lies in the open space it leaves for personal response: it neithercondones nor condemns the war, so that the viewer can, as she or he chooses, see the namesof heroes who died keeping the world safe for democracy, of unnecessary sacrifices to anunjust and stupid conflict, or anything in between; while those who fought in the war andsurvived are not subjected to unnecessary romanticism or pious sentiments--only the list ofnames. By deliberately avoiding political usage, the Viet Nam memorial opens itself tofulfil its personal purpose more fully. Every day, offerings are left beside the lists of names--flowers, war medals, even cans of beer. If not a Valhalla, the memorial has become ashrine: a gateway to the other world, where the dead can receive their due. In this sense, theVietnam memorial is closer to a Norse understanding of the proper way to honour the fallenthan to the memorials set up after World War I, for instance: a judgement upon the cause offighting is far less important than how the individual who fought and fell is remembered, sothat however history may choose to view the battle, the soldier himself is known by thelegacy of his own personal deeds. The use of memorialization--particularly artistic memorialization--as a means of dealingwith grief and the recognition of death can easily be seen as a human universal. To theNorse (and the ancestors of the English, Germans, and Dutch), it was literally the linkbetween this world and the ones beyond. Living memory and afterlife expectations werehardly to be distinguished from one another: the process of memorialization was also theprocess by which the deceased travelled the road to Valhalla."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"73 Neckel, Walhall Gods and Myths, pp. 142-43.

Frühmittelalterliche Bildüberlieferung und die organisierte Kult, p. 487."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"75Chapter V: Wotan--Death, Runes, and Poetry Having considered Valhalla and its roots in the need to deal with death and grief throughmemorialization, it is now time to turn again to its lord: to one-eyed Wotan in his broad-brimmed hat. “What distinguishes the historical Valhalla from Hel is, shortly stated,Óðinn”; and indeed, the god himself can hardly be separated from his hall. For as Valhallais the Hall of the Slain, Wotan is the Father of the Slain (Valfather) and the Receiver of theSlain (Valthögnir), and he is also the one whom the Norse skalds had to thank for the gift ofpoetry by which they enshrined their holy dead within his hall. To fully understand whatthis meant to the Norse, it is necessary to delve deeper into the god’s nature--to see him asthey saw him, both awesome and terrifyingly dark, giver of victory and song, and claimerof lives in return. As discussed in the first chapter of this book, Wotan’s role as a battle-god is specificallythat of a god of death in battle, who receives the slain as his own sacrifices; and it is thisrole which he obviously fulfils in regards to Valhalla. Egill Skalla-Grímsson’s Sonatorrekshows him as a more general god of death, bearing up, for instance, the sickness-deadGunnarr; and blamed for breaking troth with Egill in regards to the death of Egill’s sons.Wotan also seems to reveal himself as a god of death--perhaps even a personification ofdeath--in Grímnismál, where his threat to Geirroðr, “Now you shall see Óðinn!” saysnothing other than, “Now you shall die!” Several of Wotan’s attributes in the Norse sourcesalso provide us with the clear image of his role as a death-god--and, perhaps, a member ofthe host of the dead himself. How the Norse understood, and felt about, Wotan wasexpressed directly by how they described him: wandering through the wilderness in hisblue-black cloak, sacrificial spear in his hand and his face half-hidden by his low-hanginghat, riding on a many-legged gray horse, followed by ravens and wolves--perhaps with themark of the hangman’s noose to be seen beneath his beard, as hinted at by his by-namessuch as “Hanged One” (Hangi). The first mark by which a Norseman would have known Wotan from any ordinarymounted wayfarer is, of course, his peculiar steed, the eight-legged gray Sleipnir. A numberof theories have been advanced regarding Sleipnir’s multiple legs, some of which wouldpoint directly to a specific relationship between Sleipnir and Wotan as death-god. H.R.Ellis-Davidson, for instance, suggests that the eight legs may signify the four pallbearerswho carry the dead, comparing the Norse image of the eight-legged horse to an Indian dirgewhich sings of the funeral bier as the horse with eight legs and four heads. Höfler likewiseargues for the eight legs as representing four humans, but perceives Sleipnir as the “horse”of traditional folk-masquerades, which, according to his theory, are related to the folkloreof the Wild Hunt and to the cult of Wotan as, not only god of death, but specifically leaderof the frenzied dead who ride out during stormy nights in autumn and winter (especiallyaround the Yule season). Mis-legged horses, as well as appearing in German Wild Huntfolklore, are also often taken as signs of death or ill-omen: North German and Danish folkbelief both include tales of the Helhest, or “death-horse”, which “has three legs and oneeye, and when someone sees it, he shall die”, or else goes around in times of plague. Alternate interpretations, however, include an influence from neighbouring shamaniccultures, since the eight-legged horse is attested in Siberian shamanism (Nancke-Krogh, forinstance, compares a shaman’s many-legged hobby-horse from northern Mongolia and aneight-legged bronze horse ornament from Russia on which the legs are formed by hangingbells); Sleipnir as a symbol of the winds, with his eight legs corresponding to the eightdirections of the Northern map; or the eight feet simply showing Sleipnir’s unusual speed.The plethora of plausible explanations makes it difficult, if not impossible, to single out anyone as an indicator of Sleipnir’s character--or Wotan’s. More significant is Sleipnir’s gray colour. Turville-Petre observes that the dead GuðrúnGjúkadóttir (Wagner’s Gutrune), when she appears in a dream to a post-conversion"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"76Icelander, is mounted upon a gray horse, as is the woman who appears in a dream to foretellthe death of Gísli the Outlaw. In Icelandic folktales of the Black Death, the plague takesthe shape of a man and woman riding gray horses or of a gray bull. Brennu-Njáls sagaincludes a frightening vision of a pitch-black man on a gray horse riding through fire andshooting a fiery shaft as a token of the catastrophic events to come: whether this man ismeant to be Óðinn or not, the imagery is certainly reminiscent of Óðinn (whose nameappears nowhere in the saga); and if he is not Óðinn, he is certainly dead, as his colour andthe repetitive staves of his verse (in Icelandic literature, it is typical for dead persons torepeat the last lines of their poetry) make clear. The Norse word for gray, grár, is also usedmetaphorically to denote spite or malice. Sleipnir’s colour, thus, is the colour of a death-horse, the gray shadow bringing forth the terrifying quality of his rider--whose appearanceon horseback bodes a coming war, as seen, for instance, in the tale of the Smith of Nesjar: That same winter (1208 C.E.) after Yule, before the beginning of summer, a smith lived in Nesjar. That was one evening, when a man came riding and asked him for lodgings and asked him to make horseshoes. The farmer said he could well do that: they got up when it was a long time until dawn, and started to forge. The farmer asked: “Where were you last night?” “In Melðadal”, said the guest: that was north in Telemark. The smith said: “You must be the greatest liar-man, because no one could have travelled all that way.” Then he went back to forging, and could not forge as he wished. The guest said: “Forge as you yourself wish to fare”, and the horse-shoes became larger than he had seen before, but when they carried them to where he had the horse, then they shoed it. Then the guest spoke thus: “You are a foolish man,” he said, “and unwise: why do you ask nothing?” The smith said, “What sort of man are you? or from whence have you come? or where shall you fare?” He answered, “I have come from the North over the land, and I have long dwelt in Norway, but I expect now to fare eastwards to Sweden, and I have long been on shipboard, but now I must go about by horse.” The smith said, “Where do you expect to be by evening?” “Eastwards in Sparmörk”, he said. “That must not be the truth”, the farmer said, “forthat can hardly be reached in seven days’ ride.” He mounted then upon the horse; thefarmer asked, “Who are you?” He answered, “Have you ever heard Óðinn spoken of?”“I have heard him named,” the farmer said; “Here you may now see him”, the guest said, “but if you do not trust that which I have said to you, you may now see my horse leap over the wall.” The horse backed up: then he turned the spurs to the horse and pricked him on; the horse leapt over the wall, and never came down, so that he (the smith) never saw him again. Four nights later there was a great battle . . . between King Sörkvir and King Eiríkr. The smith told this tale to Jarl Filippó that same winter in Túnsberg . . .(Fornmanna sögur, vol. 9. Sveinbjörn Egilsson and others, eds. Norræna fornfræðafélags,1828-37, pp. 55-56.) In spite of his disbelief, the smith is spared from death, probably because he has doneÓðinn a favour--a common motif in folktales of the Wild Hunt, and also frequentlyappearing in Scandinavian folktales of the Black Death, where Plague rewards the man whohas carried her across the river either by sparing him, or, if he is already doomed to die,giving him a quick and easy death. Wotan’s blue-black (blár) cloak was another sign of his dark and terrifying nature in theminds of the Norse. Blár is a colour associated directly with death, especially with the evildead. For instance, in Eyrbyggja saga, the body of the undead Thórólfr Twist-foot isdescribed as “blár as Hel” and big as an ox, while the same description also appears for themalicious corpse Glámr in Grettis saga. Such descriptions were based on observed reality:the darkness of skin and gross swelling are well within the range of normal symptoms ofdecay, while the tendency to interpret such signs as supernatural, especially if the personhas died under abnormal circumstance (violence, accident, an unfamiliar illness), is alsousual, as discussed extensively by Barber: “it is these people . . . who are apt to lieundiscovered long enough to develop into monsters, growing in size, changing colour,"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"77shedding their skin--in short, undergoing all the diverse changes that we have seen in the‘vampires’”. When the dead appear in the supernatural world, the dark hue of the decayingbody may have appeared symbolically as dark clothes, as in the case of Guðrún Gjúkadóttirin Sturlunga saga, for example. In the human world, blár and black were used as mourning clothes among the Norse. Here, as with the other Indo-European peoples who followed this usage, the purpose wasprobably that of identification with the dead--whether, as Ranke suggests, to symbolicallyshare the experience of death with the deceased, or, as is more often the case in folklore, toprevent the jealous dead from dragging the living back with them. Unique to the North, however (as far as we know), was the custom of wearing blue-blackfor the purpose, not only of acknowledging death, but of actively dealing it out. Thispractice may have gone back to a very early time in the Germanic world: Tacitus speaks ofthe Harii as blackening their shields, dyeing their bodies, and attacking on dark nights: “bysheer panic and shadowy effect they strike terror like an army of ghosts”, an activity whichRanke interprets as imitating the dead and perhaps thus assuming their powers. In thesagas, wearing blue/blue-black clothing is specifically a sign of the intention to kill, asnoted, among others, by Hermann Pálsson: “The image of Hrafnkell on both occasionsriding in blue clothing is all we need to know about his mood and intention, for in the sagasblue clothing is customarily worn by killers”. The hero Víga-Glúmr (Battle-Glúmr), quitepossibly an hereditary worshipper of Óðinn, is given a blár cloak and inlaid spear by hisgrandfather in Norway; when he kills his enemy Sigmundr, Víga-Glúmr’s brotherThórsteinn recognises what his sibling has been up to by the combination of “both cloakand spear” (ch. 8, p. 28) before he sees the blood in the inlay-work on the spearhead.Interestingly, the cloak is the article most often referred to in this context. Of course, as theusual outer garment, it would be the most immediately visible and thus the obvious choicefor announcing one’s intentions to the casual observer (or the saga-audience, as the casemay be). However, the cloak, especially a hooded one such as Víga-Glúmr’s, is alsosignificant because it conceals the wearer’s body and, at times, face--as would beappropriate if the garment were indeed seen as a means by which the bearer identifiedhimself with the dead and the powers of the realm of death. “Now you may see Óðinn”: as the Norse saw him, a terrifying figure, whose imageencompasses both the dead and the force of death--riding to herald war on his ghastly grayhorse, swathed in his blue-black cloak, holding the spear which dooms his battle-sacrifices,followed by carrion-beaked ravens and bloody-mouthed wolves. He is a god to be fearedand propitiated, certainly--but worshipped out of love, for himself and his gifts?God of Runes and Magic Óðinn shifted shapes. His body lay then as if sleeping or dead, but he was then a bird or an animal, a fish or a wyrm, and fared in a moment to faraway lands on his errands or those of other men. He was also able to slake fire with a single word or calm the sea or turn the wind in any direction he willed . . . he woke up dead men from the earth or sat himself beneath hanged men . . . He was able to achieve all these accomplishments with runes and those songs which are called galdrar . . . Óðinn was accomplished at that skill from which the greatest power followed, which is called seiðr, and practiced it himself, and with this he was able to know the fates of men and things unset, and also how to cause the deaths or soul-loss or ill luck of men, and also how to take from men wit and life-force and give it to another (Ynglinga saga, pp. 18-19). Throughout his wanderings among his people, Wotan seems to have two chief guises. Onewas spoken of more fully in the first chapter: the god of battle-death and sacrifice, thearmed and armoured god who sits in Valhalla among his heroes, watchful against the end ofthe world. The other, at first glance, seems to have very little to do with Valhalla or heroicdeeds: this is the ancient wizard wandering between the worlds in his endless search forwisdom, who we see in several of the Eddic poems. In “The Dreams of Baldr”, for instance,"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"78Wotan rides down Hel-road to call a dead seeress forth from her grave; though shestruggles against him, complaining of her long sleep, in time she must tell him all he wishesto know. Vafþrúðnismál shows him, ever-greedy for lore, going in disguise to the hall ofthe jötunn Vafþrúðnir--a journey of peril from which Frigg fears he will not return. Óðinnwagers his head against Vafþrúðnir’s in a riddle-game; having found the answers he seeks,he wins by asking the jötunn the one unanswerable question: “What did Óðinn whisper inthe ear of his son Baldr on the funeral pyre?” Like the unlucky Geirroðr, Vafþrúðnirrecognises his guest--and loses his life. Most of all, however, the image of Wotan as seeker of wisdom, willing to go to anylengths in order to get the power of knowledge, is summed up in one of the best-knownpassages of Hávamál: at the climax of his lengthy recitation of lore and advice, he reveals, I know that I hung on a windy tree, nights all nine, gored by a spear, given to Óðinn, given, self to myself. On that tree of which no man knows, from what roots it rises. With no bread they heartened me nor with drinking horn, I pried downward, I took up the runes, roaring I took them, I fell afterwards from there . . . This image--the long-bearded god hanging on the ancient tree, struck through with hisown spear, to find the hidden lore of the runes through his own pain and death--has struckmany as the deepest and most meaningful face of Wotan. It is ironic, then, that over the pastcentury both the age and the Northern origin of the ordeal of the runes have beenquestioned more thoroughly than any aspect of the god’s existence. Óðinn’s self-sacrifice on the windswept tree hangs, both geographically and spiritually,between two equal and opposite poles. Eastward stands the Siberian shaman: beating on anadorned drum (similar to the drums used by the Saami, whom the Norse both respected andfeared for their magical skills), and clad in a costume which might perhaps resemble a bird,reindeer, or bear, jingling with iron pendants. In due course, he may climb into the whitebranches of the birch-tree that, for him, embodies the cosmos; by doing this, he travelsthrough the worlds, where he may seek out the spirits that dwell in the various realms--likeÓðinn on the World-Tree (if indeed, as most interpretations would have it, that is the treeon which the god hangs). More importantly still, it is only through the initiation of deaththat the shaman finds his own powers: in a visionary trance, he experiences the rendering ofhis flesh, the sundering and re-forging of his bones. Often this is preceded by an sicknesswhich has put him in grave danger of physical death; both during and after his initiation, itis not uncommon for him to use means such as extreme heat, extreme cold, and pain inorder to raise his own spiritual powers. Could the shaman’s gaining of power through deathand suffering have influenced the figure of Óðinn hanging on the tree? This has beenargued extensively since the nineteen-twenties, since the similarity between Óðinn’shanging on a tree which might be the World-Tree and the shamanistic means of travellingbetween the worlds by climbing a birch-tree was first observed, followed quickly bycomparisons of the transformative ordeals of initiation, which can be summed up mostneatly by Buchholtz’s observation that “(Óðinn’s ordeal) is the most impressive example infavour of shamanism . . . the ecstasy first creates the godly.” However, far to the South stands a figure whose ordeal is, in many of its particulars, anear-perfect reflection of Óðinn’s. Like the Northern god, he hangs on a tree; like theNorthern god, he is pierced with a spear, and receives no bread to comfort him or strongdrink to numb his pain; his death, too, is couched in terms of a sacrifice, and, like Óðinn(according to later interpretations of the Southern legend) he descends to the Underworld,then comes back in full godly power. This is, of course, the central figure of christian"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"79mythology: the crucified and resurrected Jesus of Nazareth. The close similarity betweenthe two legends was noticed by the Danish scholar Sophus Bugge as early as the 1880’s: though the popularity of his theory has long since been superseded by the theory of ashamanic origin for Óðinn’s ordeal, Bugge’s arguments have yet to be convincinglydisproved. Not only does Bugge consider the apparent resemblance between the suspendedand stabbed deities, but he closely studies the similarities of language between Hávamál138-39 and Germanic descriptions of Christ’s death, mentioning particularly the commonuse of the Germanic “gallows”-word for translating ‘cross”; also the “windy tree”, thedescriptions of the sacrificed god as “wounded”, and, most telling from Bugge’s point ofview, the concept of a god sacrificed to himself. The chief argument against Bugge’s theory is that “we know now that the practices ofhanging a victim on a tree and stabbing it with a spear are intimately connected with thecult of Óðinn and do not need an explanation from christian legends.” However, Buggedoes not ignore the native evidence for hanging and stabbing as a means of sacrifice withinthe cult of Óðinn; instead, he argues that the existing association between hanging/stabbingand the god made it particularly easy for the christian idea of a deity sacrificed to himself tobe assimilated into Germanic belief, most probably--in his view--in the northern BritishIsles, where the two religions were in frequent contact. As further evidence for theoverlapping perceptions of Óðinn and Christ in northern Britain, Bugge cites a folk balladfrom Unst (Shetland): Nine days he hang pa de rütless tree; for ill wis da folk, in’ güd wis he. A blüdy mael (hole) wis in his side - made wi’ a lance ‘at wid na hide. Nine lang nichts i’ da nippin rime hang he dare wi’ his naeked limb. Some, dey leuch (laugh); Bit idders gret (weep).As Turville-Petre observes, “If the myth of the hanging Óðinn did not derive from thelegend of the dying Christ, the two scenes resembled each other so closely that they cameto be confused in popular tradition”. What we cannot know, however, is if this song (asBugge believed) represented a genuine conflation of the cult of Óðinn and the cult of Christin the heathen period, or if it, like many manifestations of folk christianity in areas whereelements of traditional religions survived strongly, is merely a substitution of the publiclyaccepted name and mythic framework for the original heathen belief. Between Asiatic shamanism and Middle Eastern religion filtered through Germanic and/or Celtic coverts, it is difficult to determine which, if either, might have influenced Óðinn’srune-winning ordeal. Both the shaman’s initiation and the christian myth show strongsimilarities to the legend of Óðinn on the tree; both also, however, differ from it insignificant--indeed, crucial--points. The first difficulty in seeing Óðinn as a shaman lies in the lack of evidence for full-blown shamanism among the Germanic peoples. Shamanism is, in general, characteristic ofnomadic peoples--most often hunter-gatherer tribes, but occasionally pastoralists orhorticulturalists; it normally gives way to organized, “cultic” religion as part of the processof adaptation to a settled agricultural lifestyle of the sort which the Germanic peoples haveenjoyed since the latter part of the Stone Age. While many Norsemen (and women)demonstrated some skills typical of the shamanic complex (for instance: berserks werecapable of reaching, occasionally at will, a state of excitation in which they showedsuperhuman physical strength and sometimes could not be harmed by fire or sharp objects;a number of characters in the sagas--other than the example cited for Óðinn above--are ableto shift shapes and roam about as animals while their bodies lie asleep; the Greenlandseeress in Eiríks saga rauða is able to summon spirits and ask them about when a faminewill end ), none of them demonstrate anything resembling the various range of capabilitiestypical of a tribal shaman, nor are there any figures in the Norse sources who perform the"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"80central social role of the shaman among a traditional people.” Where shamans exist, theyare the centre of the native community . . . (The shaman) is, so to speak, the regulator of thesoul of the group or tribe, and his function is to adjust, avert and heal defects, vacillations,disturbances, and diseases of this soul.” In other words, his duty is to act as spiritual leaderfor the tribe and intermediary between it and the spirit-world, to heal illnesses of body andsoul, to ensure the proper relationships between the dead and the living, and in general toensure that all goes well by keeping this world and the Otherworld in balance andcommunication. In regards to the specific ordeal of hanging/experiencing death to learn the runes, Óðinnis not, so far as we know, undergoing an initiation which is typical in any way: within theGermanic context, his experience has no predecessors and is never repeated. The shaman,in contrast, is not alone in his experiences: every tribe has its own shaman, and while theinitiation may vary depending on the individual, the elements are consistent and, within ageneral framework, expected. Further, as Jere Fleck has pointed out, Óðinn’s tree-death isnot typical for shamanism: the usual shamanic death-initiation is one of dismembermentand reconstruction. The shamanic tree-climbing, on the other hand, is associated not withinitiation, but with the journey to the Otherworld, usually the upper world: shamans are nothanged. Finally, there is the sacrifice itself and the terms in which it is put, together with the wide-ranging body of evidence for the combination of hanging and stabbing as a means ofhuman sacrifice: Óðinn is slain in just the same manner as his own human offerings. Onecannot, for instance, interpret the scene on the Hammars I stone as showing a shamanicinitiation. The story of King Víkarr in Gautreks saga is even more telling: Víkarr is set upfor a symbolic sacrifice of a sort which looks a great deal like an initiation--since his mendo not want to slay him, they have put a noose of soft calf-gut around his neck, and a reedis ready to be cast at him in place of a spear. However, Óðinn has already arranged matters:at the moment when his hero Starkaðr says, “I give you to Óðinn” and throws the reed, thefrail plant becomes a spear and the yielding calf-gut a stout rope. Thus the god gets hissacrifice--and there is no chance of Víkarr returning from the Otherworld as a shaman. Thelanguage of Hávamál also shows that the composer saw Óðinn’s ordeal as falling into thesame ritual-religious sphere as that of ordinary sacrifices to him: the phrase “gefinn Óðni”--given to Óðinn--indicates precisely that. As the late Hector Munro Chadwick observes,“The bearing of the story related in Gautreks s. 7 (the story of Víkarr) . . . on Háv. 138 isobvious. The nature of the connection between the two passages ought to be equally clear,namely that we have in both cases a picture of the ordinary ritual of sacrifice to Óðinn.” None of these things argue against Bugge’s view of a christian origin for Óðinn’s ordeal:the concept of a god sacrificed to himself is, if anything, easier to fit into this context.However, the situations and result are drastically different. Jesus is said to be dying for thesins of a tainted world, suffering the worst of human pains, including rejection by hisheavenly father (“My god, my god, why have you forsaken me?”); neither knowledge norpower are among his motives. Óðinn’s ordeal is, so far as we can tell, undergone for thespecific purpose of learning the knowledge he can only achieve through death and gainingthe power that he can only achieve through receiving the mightiest of all sacrifices--thesacrifice of the god that he already is. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with Óðinn’sworld as there is with Jesus’: the Northern god has nothing to set to rights, he has only tofurther learning and growth (first his own, then that of those he teaches). Nor is there anyreason to think that the concept of a godly sacrifice, even a god sacrificed to himself, wasbeyond the comprehension of the Norse. A god that can be killed can be sacrificed, afterall--the slain Baldr is even specifically referred to as heilagr tafn--“holy sacrifice”, in UlfrUggason’s Húsdrápa (a description of an interior mural depicting Baldr’s ship-funeral,written ca. 983). And the sacrifices which seem to have been associated most with specificgods are the sacrifices of the creatures which themselves embody the power of the deity:swine and horses for Freyr, for instance--and warriors, particularly his own heroes, forWotan. It is, therefore, no great leap to see the god choosing to sacrifice himself to himself. This choice is entirely in keeping with everything we know of Óðinn’s character, withthe risks he takes and the prices he pays: for access to Mímir’s well, he gives up one eye; to"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"81win the mead of poetry, as described below, he must break an oath sworn on a holy arm-ring; he is willing to hazard his head to gain Vafthrúðnir’s lore--and to give up his life togain the knowledge of the runes and the strength he receives from the sacrifice of self toself. Precise details of external influence on this latter deed, whether Siberian or MiddleEastern, will perhaps never be ascertained. But if either, or both, were part of the inspirationleading ultimately to the Northern poet’s description of the winning of the runes, theGermanic worldview transformed any such influences beyond recognition, by setting theminto the traditional context of ritual sacrifice to Óðinn and providing a motivation typical ofthe god. His death by hanging itself is especially significant because, in the Norse sources,the corpses of hanged men are specifically identified as the sources of wisdom. There is noway to tell whether such hanged were originally sacrifices, or whether any dangling corpsewould do, but it is safe to say that these dead men are not themselves shamans, nor in anyway related to christian myth, and that it is perhaps more reasonable to seek the most directorigins of the god’s ordeal in immediately attested native belief. As Turville-Petre observes,“Óðinn, swinging on the tree of the world, was in the company of the dead, sharing thewisdom which only they possess . . . If wisdom could be won from a dead delinquentswinging on the gallows, how much more could be gained from Óðinn after he had passedthrough the world of death . . . There is no way to master all the wisdom of the dead but todie.” We can fairly safely state that, in the Norse view, whatever outside influences may havebeen present, that Óðinn almost certainly experienced genuine death, and as not merely adead man, but that special kind, a hanged man (and a sacrifice to boot), he was able to lookdown into the Underworld and take up (or “understand”: the Norse phrase can be translatedeither way) its “runes”. It might, perhaps, even be speculated that he was able to bringhimself back to life with them just as he boasts later in Hávamál 157 that . . . if I see up on a tree a wavering hanged corpse, So I cut and colour the runes, that the man may walk and talk with me.The distinction between a god of the dead and the dead in his keeping is not necessarily aneasy one to make, and, as discussed above, Óðinn shares certain telling characteristics withthe dead. With this as a signpost to Wotan’s own nature, his right to raise up heroes and call themto himself grows clearer. He can challenge others to die, because he himself has died: he isnot only the god of death, but himself the greatest of the mighty dead. But what of the mysterious “runes” themselves--this root of Wotan’s power, so it seems?Some things can be known for certain: first, that the “rune”-word probably did notoriginally refer to the letters of the Germanic alphabet (usually referred to as the “futhark”--the name comes from the first six letters of the runic alphabet: F, U, Th, A, R, K). Theorigin of the word is unclear, perhaps being related to the German “raunen” (whisper);probably having something to do with speech. The earliest inscription using the word, theEinang stone (Norway ca. 300 C.E.), reads only “GudagastiR coloured the rune”--herereferring to the whole inscription. It is not until the fifth century or so that the word seemsto be used to indicate the individual staves, with the phrase runorunu “a run of runes” or“a row of runes” appearing on the Björketorp and Stentoften stones. Still, the older meaningof rune = phrase may have survived in the Norse: over six hundred years after the carvingof the Einang stone, if the verse and saga can be trusted, Egill Skalla-Grímsson says, “Icarve a rune on the horn” (for the purpose of revealing a poisoned drink), perhaps referringto his verse or a portion thereof. C. Fell has observed that in Old English, the “rune”-wordcan mean “discussion”, “counsel”, and “knowledge”, as well as “secret”; the frequent usagein christian contexts suggests that if it were part of the terminology of Anglo-Saxonreligion, it was only so in the general sense that all religions have “mysteries”,“knowledge”, or “significant sayings”, and was unlikely to have been intrinsically"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"82associated with native magical or religious practices. In general, “rune” seems most likelyto have originally indicated a “significant saying”, whether its chief effect was meant to befelt in this world or another. The question of whether the rune-staves themselves were originally seen as magical tools, or simply as letters, has received a great deal of discussion, which is far outside the scope ofthis book. Like the tree on which Wotan won them, we can say of the runes that “no oneknows from what roots they rise”: their shapes (vertical and slanting strokes only, withhorizontals strictly avoided) show that they were developed chiefly for carving on wood,but none of these original wooden inscriptions have survived; all our earliest examples ofrunic inscriptions are on stone and metal. Unless and until some hitherto unknown stavessurface, say from a peat-marsh in Germany, we will not know if the first runesters werecarving charms and curses, deep god-lore, merchants’ tallies, or personal communicationssimilar to the mediaeval rune-stave from Bergen which reads, “Gyða says you should comehome” (Gyða’s husband was apparently at a pub; the other side of the stave is covered withillegible scratches, possibly meant to say something along the lines of, “Thórólfr says Gyðashould shut up”). We do know that, by the sixth century or so, there was some use of runes for magical, as well as memorial, purposes. A fairly common form of adornment at this time, which oftenseems to have been seen as a form of amulet, was the type of pendant known as a“bracteate”. These bracteates were originally inspired by the design of Roman coins, many of which showed images that also meant a great deal within the Germanic culture (a man onhorseback, sometimes carrying a spear, which might have been easiest for the Northernersto interpret as Wotan but could also have been read, for instance, as any of the great heroes;a wolf suckling a pair of children--several of the great dynasties of the North, such as theEast Anglian Wuffings, or “Wolfings”, were said to be descended from or in other waysassociated with wolves). Native Germanic artists, however, quickly claimed the images astheir own, transforming the realistic Roman artwork into their own elaborately stylizedfigures--active, swirling, chimerically hypnotic shapes bordering on the abstract. Many ofthese bracteates are inscribed with runes, some of which seem to have specifically magicalor religious purposes, such as Darum I, which shows the bust of a man with upraised handsand reads frohila laÞu--FROHILA LAÞU (“Frohila invites”)--a formula generally taken tosuggest the invitation of gods or other mighty beings to bring weal to the wearer --or thebracteate from Sjælland which reads, “I am called Hariuha, wise about dangers: I give auja(a word which appears elsewhere in runic inscriptions and can be interpreted as “goodluck” or protection)”; the formula alu, ALU, which appears to be from the same root as the“ale” word, is also found several times, and appears, like AUJA, to mean “good luck” or“protection”. In addition to these examples, where the power could reasonably be seen as lying in theword rather than the staves, there are a number of bracteates with so-called “nonsenseinscriptions”--some of which are clearly garbled by illiterate goldsmiths, others of whichleave the possibility open for seeing power in the runestaves themselves. The names of therunes, which were probably established at least by the fifth or sixth century (since many ofthem are consistent in Old English and Old Norse), have also led some to speculate as totheir possible cultic or magical uses. Often, interpretations based on this theory have beentaken to absurd extremes; but in some cases, speculations about a connection between runicnames and runic magic have reasonable backing. For instance: the F-rune, f, has thereconstructed name *fehu, “wealth” (Old English feoh, from whence comes our modern“fee”, and the Old Norse fé; the latter also implies herd animals, a measure of wealth in theold days, and is still used in Modern Icelandic for “sheep”). In the seventh century, a mannamed Haduwulfar carved a stone (the Gummarp stone) to read, “Haduwulfar placed threestaves: fff”--clearly a charm to bring fruitfulness and prosperity. In Viking Age literature, in contrast, we have a great deal of evidence, not only for magicbeing carried out by means of words or phrases written in runes, but for magic in the stavesthemselves. The valkyrie Sigrdrífa advises Sigurðr of a great many uses for runes, all ofwhich involve carving and some of which name specific staves."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"83 You shall ken victory runes if you will have victory, and rist them on hilt of the blade, some on the guard-ring, some on the hilt-plate, and two times name Týr (the name of a rune-stave as well as a god). You shall ken ale-runes if you wish that another’s woman not betray your troth, if you trust; you shall rist them on horn and on back of the hand, and mark Nauðr (a rune-name) on your nail . . . These are beech-runes, and those are warding-runes, and all ale-runes, and mighty runes of main. he who knows them unconfused and undestroyed, shall have them for good, for use, if you take them, until the doom of the gods. The poem Skírnismál includes a runic curse made operant by the carving of the runethurisaz (Þ) and “three staves--perversion, loathing, and lust”, and cancelled by scraping therunes off (verse 36). Given the available information, it is quite easy to suspect adevelopment from rune = significant phrase (Einang stone, preserved in Old English) torune = stave transcribing such a phrase (Björketorp stone) to rune = sign with its own name,which may be used as an abbreviation for the name--as in the Stentoften stone, which reads“Haduwolfar gave j (the J-rune jera--“harvest”)”--to rune = embodiment of the power ofthe name (Gummarp stone) to rune = a sign which can be used to bring all thecharacteristics associated with its name into an operant inscription (Sigrdrífumál,Skírnismál), with the older meanings surviving beside the younger. It should also be remembered that in the Viking Age and the period immediatelyfollowing, even if rune-staves could be seen as magical, they did not have to be magical:we have a great many simple inscriptions ranging from “Ketill owns this comb” and “Gyðjasays you should come home” to a few graffitos which would not be out of place on thewalls of any men’s room frequented by sailors, such as one of the Bergen inscriptionswhich plays on the repetition of the word “fuþ”--the first three letters of the futhark, butalso a coarse slang-word for the female genitals. The distinction seems to have lain in whatwas done during the carving: runes intended to have some effect beyond simplecommunication were coloured (with blood, according to the sagas) and chanted over. Indeed, while runic poetry is by no means necessarily magical, runic magic appears tohave almost always been poetic. Snorri tells us in Ynglinga saga that Óðinn taught hisaccomplishments “with runes and those songs, which are called galdrar (magical songs)”. When Egill Skalla-Grímsson receives with suspicion the horn of drink brought to him byhis enemies Queen Gunnhildr (Eiríkr Blood-Axe’s wife) and Barðr, he “drew then his knifeand stuck it in his palm; he took the horn and carved runes on it and reddened them inblood”. The carving and colouring of his “rune” go together with his speaking of a versedeclaring, in good magical fashion, what he is doing and the effect it must have, as indeed itdoes: I rist the rune on the horn, I redden the spells in blood, I choose the words at the root of the wood of the wild beast’s ear (the drinking horn). I drink, as I will, feast-ale of the well-gladdened bondsmaids, let be known what lies for me in the ale that Barðr signed!"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"84 The horn burst asunder and the drink fell down into the straw. A similar description appears in the saga of the famous outlaw, Grettir the Strong. Grettirhas wounded an old witch in return for her wish that all his luck and happiness turn fromhim; as revenge, the woman goes to the beach across from the island where Grettir is holedup and finds an uprooted stump, on which “She let a little flat place be shaved . . . then shetook her knife and risted runes on the root and reddened them in her blood and sang galdrarover them. She went backwards and widdershins around the tree and had there manymighty utterances over it. After that she let the tree be pushed out into the water and spokethus: that it should drive out to Drangey, and be all harm to Grettir.” Grettir later tries tochop the tree up; his axe slips and hits his leg, and the wound becomes infected andweakens him so that when his enemies come for him, they are finally able to kill him. Thewitch’s use of magic to harm a man who is too physically strong for any other man(including her own foster son), let alone an old woman, to meet face to face, is notsurprising in any genre of mediaeval literature. What is more interesting is that the sametechnique of chanting over bloodied runes was also used, in an honourable and admirablecontext, by one of the strongest and fiercest of warrior Vikings to protect himself againstthe weapons of those who did not dare to face him outright. This is a reversal of theexpected perception of magic as the last resort of the weak or socially displaced; it is also,perhaps, a telling observation of the equal importance of mental, spiritual, and physicalskills in the Northern culture--especially the highly respected skill of word-craft. The direct association between songs and magical staves also appears, literally, in the aleSigrdrífa brings Sigurðr, which is “full of might and mainstrength glorious / it is blendedwith songs and staves of liking, / good galdrar and pleasure-runes” (Sigrdrífumál 5). Laterin the poem, Sigrdrífa speaks of the mighty runes she has taught Sigurðr as being scratched,scraped off, and mixed into “the holy mead” to be sent out through the worlds; it is notstated that this mead is the mead of poetry, but the leap would not be too far. Speech in general could also be spoken of as “staves”, suggesting that the unity of thewords (and the power behind them) with the runic letters in which they could be writtenwas firmly set in the Norse mind. Such a usage, again in a magical context, appears faraway from Sigrdrífa’s holy mountain shimmering with dawn-fire. Rather than dawn, thetime is sunset: the site is a burial mound in which twelve undead berserks dwell, and thefire that burns around it is the unearthly fire of the barrow. Instead of a man awaking anarmour-clad woman, it is an armour-clad woman, the warrior-maid Hervör, who comes tocall forth her dead father Angantýr and demand the sword of power, Týrfingr, which is herinheritance (and may have at some point come to embody the leadership of her tribe). Shedoes so with a mighty curse, “Hail thee, Angantýr! Hervör wakes you, the only daughter of yourself and Sváva. Bring from the howe the hard-edged blade, that which Sigrlami sought from the dwarves. Hervarðr, Hjörvarðr, Hrani, Angantýr! I waken all of you, wide roots beneath, with helm and byrnie, with harshest sword-edge, with shield, shield-rim, and spear-point red . . . Hervarðr, Hjörvarðr, Hrani, Angantýr! So be to all of you, inside your rib-cage, as if you mouldered in mound of ants, unless you bring me the blade forged by Dválin; unseemly ‘tis for dead men dear weapons to bear.”At last the corpse within the barrow answers her: “Hervör, daughter, why do you call so,"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"85 full of foul staves? you fare towards ill, you have grown mad, miswitted as well, wildly thinking to wake up dead men.”Here, though no runes are carved, the “staves” are still present in the verses that Hervör hasspoken (Angantýr argues with her for some time, prophesying that the sword will be thedestruction of her descendants in days to come, but neither the sight of the dead manstanding before her, his dark words, nor the unearthly flames between the world daunt herwill; and at last he brings out the blade for her). Wotan’s gift still provides the power to linkthe living and the dead, as Hervör makes clear when she tells her reluctant father that “Sowould the god let you rest, whole in your howe, if you did not hold Týrfingr with you”--“the god” here surely being none other than Wotan, who boasted in Hávamál 157 ofknowing that song by which, with the carving and colouring of runes, he can make a deadman walk and speak. That this unity of runestaves, poetry, and magic was a matter of more than literature isshown to us, ironically, by the churchman Hrabanus Maurus--a member of the court ofCharlemagne, that great promoter of cultural genocide against heathens. In De InventioneLinguarum, along with many other alphabets, Hrabanus Maurus provides a (slightlygarbled) variant of the runes, mentioning their connection with “songs” and “incantations”,together with, in the “A” version of the manuscript, “divination” and “pagan rites” (theseare left out of the “B” version--which may have had an English redactor, since the runicalphabet apparently had no connection with either of these things in England at that time). Wotan’s own words in Hávamál, too, bring the three together: . . . I took up the runes, roaring I took them,  I fell afterwards from there. Nine mighty songs got I from the well-known son of Bölthorn, Bestla’s father, and I got a drink of the dear-bought mead sprinkled from Óðrœrir. Then I began to grow and to become wise, to wax and to do well: word from word to word on led me, work from work to work on led me. Runes you shall find . . . The runestaves, the mighty songs, and the mead appear here as the threefold source ofÓðinn’s power; Peter Buchholtz even suggests that the three gifts can be seen as offering amagical fulfilment corresponding to the god’s threefold torment (hanging, spearing, andstarvation/thirst). Further, these verses (and the ones immediately following about thepower and recommended usage of the runes--see Appendix I) both connect the episodes ofthe winning of runes and mead to each other and lead directly into the final section of thepoem, in which Óðinn lists his magical songs and their uses. Although doubt has been caston the original structure of Hávamál, this section--which is set aside by a large red capitalletter in the manuscript--seems well-unified in concept and progression. The magic of therunes seems, then, to be the magic of the staves through which the might of the poetry ismade clear, sung over and reddened in blood: even as the runes give Wotan the tool forbringing his songs forth, it is his poetic and sorcerous craft which imbues them with theforce that separates the “very great staves, very powerful staves, which Fimbulþulr (Wotan)coloured and the great powers made and Hroptr-of-the-gods (Wotan) carved” (Hávamál142) from the ordinary letters in which Vikings scratched graffiti on their gnawed bonesafter a good dinner or identified the owners of combs and boxes. Finally, it hardly seems coincidental that a considerable portion of our surviving runic"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"86inscriptions are specifically on memorial stones for the dead. Stone is, of course, far morelikely to survive the ravages of the years than bone or wood, on which the majority ofinscriptions were probably carved. Nevertheless, from the early Migration Age onward,runestaves were inextricably connected, to the Northern mind, with the creation of a lastingmemory: Óðinn observes himself in Hávamál 72 that, A son is better though he be born after the warrior is gone. Seldom memory-stones stand near the road, unless raised by kinsman for kin.Indeed, the typical runestone inscription reads something like “Thórsteinn and Helga raisedthis stone after Ketill their father”, perhaps with a brief epigraph such as, “a good man” or“he fell in the east with Yngvi”, or with the dead person’s position named. The importanceof these memorials is shown by the fact that, at least by the end of the Viking Age and forsome time into the christian period, there were a number of professional carvers ofrunestones, and even recognisable schools of runestone art. Though their letters were,perhaps, mysterious even to some of the folk who paid to have the stones carved, theassurance that the names of their kin (and their own) would be remembered was enough.God of Poetry “I did not get Ygg’s booty (poetry) under a hanged man” boasts the Bishop BjarniKolbeinsson in Jómsvíkingadrápa. Here the christian poet is subverting the heathenconvention of describing poetry in terms of the mead of inspiration that Óðinn won andattributing his own craft thereby to the god. As I have discussed in earlier chapters, poetrywas one of the most important gifts of the Northerners--it was the chief mechanism formemorializing heroic deeds and deaths; it was the means by which name and fame lived on.That it should stem directly from Valhalla’s lord is little surprise, given that the poet’swords and the Hall of the Slain are so interwoven that there is hardly any parting one fromthe other; where it came from, and how it was one, tell us more of Wotan’s right to hold itand deal it out. According to the Prose Edda, and backed up in many particulars by kennings from olderpoetry, after the war of the two godly tribes of the Æsir and Vanir (which seems to haveended in a draw with an exchange of hostages, whereby the Vanic god Freyr and his fatherNjörðr’s came to live with the Æsir), the two tribes sealed their treaty by chewing berriesand spitting into a pot, from which arose a being called Kvasir, the wisest of all wights(Kvasir’s name seems to be derived from a word for a berry-fermented drink; Simekobserves that “In archaic cultures, the method for the production of such a drink was thatthe berries were chewed (as a communal practice) and then spat into a vessel”). Kvasir was murdered by a pair of dwarves, who brewed mead out of his heartbloodmixed with honey and put it, according to Snorri, in the cauldron Óðrœrir (“Voice-Stirrer”)and the two vessels Boðn (“Vessel”) and Són (“Reconciliation”). The dwarves are, ofcourse, typically the greatest smiths of the Germanic world, so their role as makers here isnot surprising. It is also, however, interesting that the dwarves are not only associated withthe underworld, in which they live and work, but, rather than being characterized largely asnatural beings associated with rock, ore, and so forth, are often associated specifically withthe dead. Dwarf-names listed in the Elder Edda include Dáinn (“Dead One”) and Nár(Corpse); other telling names include Bláinn (“Blue-Black One”) and Eggmóinn (“Slain bythe Sword”). According to Snorri, the dwarves were made out of the maggots crawling inthe dead flesh of the giant Ymir. After brewing the mead, the dwarves chanced to murder a giant couple; the couple’s son,Suttungr, responded by putting them out on a skerry at low tide and threatening to let themdrown unless they gave him the mead. They did so; Suttungr took it away and hid itbeneath the mountain Hnitborg, setting his daughter Gunnlöð to guard it. Hávamál and Snorri differ here on what happened next. In Hávamál (see Appendix I)Óðinn came to Suttungr’s hall as a guest, going by the name Bölverkr (Evil-Worker),"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"87impressing the etins with his speech (104), and swearing an oath on a holy ring--perhaps avow of marriage--to Gunnlöð. Snorri adds an episode in which Óðinn/Bölverkr tricks theworkers of Suttungr’s brother Baugi into killing each other, then takes their place and asksfor a drink of the mead as payment. Baugi first bores the hole into the mountain where themead was hidden, then stabs at the snake-shaped Óðinn as he crawls down it (A.G. vanHamel concludes from this that there were at least two original versions: one in whichBaugi was the keeper of the mead who offered Óðinn a sip as payment, saw the god drinkthe whole cauldron, and struck at him as he retreated; one generally following the outline ofHávamál). Snorri continues by having Óðinn get into the mountain by this method, meetGunnlöð, and seduce her into letting him drink from the cauldron. In any case, the hidingplace of the mead is certainly underground and the god must pass through a narrow hole inthe rock to make his escape. Snorri then describes how Óðinn, once free, became an eagle,flying back to Ásgarðr with his booty and spewing it out into cauldrons as he passedÁsgarðr’s walls; Snorri adds that a few drops fell outside for anyone to gather, “and that iscalled the fool-poet’s share”--a reading based, perhaps, on Thórarinn stuttfeldr’scontemptuous reference in one of his verses to an inferior contemporary’s work as “themud of the old eagle”. As a result of this adventure, Óðinn becomes the chief possessor of the mead, sips ofwhich he can grant to those he wishes to favour: he is thus the source of all poetry. Thestory itself seems to come from an Indo-European original describing the theft of a drink ofpower by an eagle, who brings it to the gods. It is interesting, however, to note the elementswhich were specialized by the Norse. In the Vedas, the drink is soma, a drink whichgenerally supplies all forms of power, of which poetry is only one aspect: “Soma is said tostimulate the voice, and to be the leader of poets. Those who drink it become immortal andknow the gods. Soma gives strength to gods and men . . . Indra, filled with soma, conqueredthe monster Vritra, and fortified with it he performed many a mighty feat.” The soma is notkept underground, but in an iron fortress; in one version of the story, the eagle is not any ofthe gods, but in the soma prayers, Indra (a storm-god noted for his strength, similar to Thórrin several respects) is also hailed as an eagle. The elements of the under worldly hidingplace, and the creation of the drink through death and perhaps in the world of the dead, areabsent in the Indian version, while the Norse mead is only the producer of poetry: it doesnot, for instance, fortify Thórr in his battles with giants. The Norse understanding of poetry as stemming from death and as the possession of thedeath-god Wotan is thoroughly understandable when two of its most common purposes areconsidered: the commemoration of battles in praise poems for the living, and thememorialization of the dead. That the Norse were aware of this shows up in thesophisticated interplay of the raven, the valkyrie, and the skald who describes their dialoguein the early tenth century Hrafnsmál. The poem is a praise-poem for Haraldr Hairfair: theraven is telling the valkyrie of Haraldr’s deeds, with special emphasis on his makingofferings to Óðinn in battle. Since Haraldr is still alive, the context is significantly differentfrom that of the Valhöll poems: however, Hrafnsmál can be clearly seen as belonging to thegenre in which a hero’s deeds are reckoned up by either Óðinn himself or, in this case, twoof his messengers.The truly interesting subtext, however, is the unspoken identity of the poet with the twofollowers of battle--the carrion-breathed raven and the bloodthirsty valkyrie. Battle-deadfeed the skald as well as the raven (and Óðinn): the raven eats the corpses King Haraldr hasleft on the field to be received as sacrifices by Óðinn, but the skald expects to be paid byHaraldr for composing the poem about the bodies the king has strewn over the strand. Thedeliberate pun is emphasized by the skald’s nickname: Thórbjörn, called hornklofi--because“hornklofi” is a by-name for a raven. And, indeed, the valkyries questioning suggests thatthe raven should especially know about how skalds fare with Haraldr: I will ask you of the skalds’ state, for you seem to know all well, how the poets fare - you should know it clearly."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"88 Although this is the most direct and obvious way in which Óðinn functions as a god ofpoetry--since most of what we know about his role in this respect comes from thereferences of professional skalds--the concept of poetry (and related word-skills) as being agift from the Otherworld, or the dead, extends much farther. In Celtic tradition, one couldsit on certain burial mounds, as a result of which one would either become a poet or gomad. A similar story appears in the þáttr Þórleifs jarlaskálds: after Thórleifr’s death, (the shepherd) was called Hallbjörn . . . he was most often accustomed to come to Thórleifr’s howe and slept there at night and kept his sheep laid nearby. That once came into his thoughts that he would like to get the words for a certain poem of praise about the howe-dweller and speak it while he laid on the howe. And the reason for this was because he was not a skald and he had never gotten the craft; he did not get the poem and nothing more of poetry came to him but that he made this: Here lies a skald. but he could get no poem more. That was one night like many when he lay on the howe and thought upon the staves if he could get some praise of the howe-dweller. After that he went to sleep and after that he saw that the howe opened and out of it walked a very large and well-adorned man. He walked up the howe to Hallbjörn and said: ‘There you lie, Hallbjörn, and you wish hard for that which is not given to you: to work a praise-poem about me. And it is a fair return that you become set in this accomplishment, and you shall get much more of it from me than most other men, and it is to be expected that you need to struggle no longer over this. I shall now speak a verse for you and if you can take this verse and remember it when you wake then you shall be a folk-skald and work praise-poems for many chieftains and you shall become greatly skilled in this accomplishment.’ Hallbjörn did remember the verse, and became a great skald afterwards, as the deadThórleifr had promised. It is particularly worth noting the constant emphasis on the phrase“getting the craft”, “getting a poem”, etc.: this emphasises the importance of poetic skill asa gift from the Otherworld, whether directly from Óðinn or, as here, from one of his host ofthe dead. The gift of poetry from the dead goes along with the gifts of magic and prophecy alsoheld by the dead. In the Eddic poem Svipdagsmál, when the hero Svipdagr is preparing tomake the dangerous journey into Jötunheimr to woo the maiden Mengloð, he first goes tothe burial mound of his mother, the seeress Groa, and says, “Awake, Groa! Good woman, awake! I waken you at death-door: do you remember how you bade your son to go to your howe? . . . Speak you the spells that will speed my way! Ward and shelter your son! Full of peril, ween I the fearsome journey for one so young of years.”Groa chants spells against all the perils of the road, including high water and storms,capture by foemen, cold, verbal challenges, and the wandering ghosts of christians,concluding, “May your errand no longer ill seem to you, nor hold you from your love. On earth-fast stone stood I inside doors while I spoke these spells for you.”"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"89 A very similar scene appears in Baldrs draumr, when Wotan awakes the dead seeress toexplain Baldr’s dreams: the dead who were wise and mighty in life are yet wiser andstronger in death, and it is their power that must be drawn forth from the Otherworld. Whiletheir awakening is by no means a power limited to Wotan, any more than is the use of runesor magical songs, he is the chief holder of the skill, the figure who is most noted forbridging the gap between the living and the dead so that the two may speak and work uponone another.Wotan Among the Gods Despite Wotan’s dark and furious aspects, he is often seen as chieftain and patriarch ofÁsgarðr, based primarily on Snorri’s descriptions. Here, however, Snorri’s familiarity withClassical mythology betrays him, when he puts Wotan in the same category as Zeus bydeclaring that “Óðinn is the greatest and eldest of the Æsir; he rules over everything, andalthough the other gods are mighty, they all serve him as children their father.” (SnorraEdda, p. 27). Neither in the myths nor in the surviving fragments of religious practice doesWotan appear as able to give orders to other deities, nor do they seem to show him honourbeyond that respect due to his accomplishments. Accounts of heathen temples more oftenput Thórr or Freyr in the chief place: for instance, in Adam of Bremen’s description of thestatues in the great temple at Old Uppsala, it is Thórr whose image is set in the central andhighest place; when Óláfr Tryggvason visits Trondheim in order to vandalize the templesthere, his attentions are directed against the image of Thórr on his first trip, against theimage of Freyr on his second. If Wotan is not the godly ruler and patriarch, that Snorri and most popular books onNorse mythology present him as being, what is his role? Firstly, he is the bringer andteacher of his special crafts: poetry, runes, and magic. As Hávamál 143 describes,apparently in regards to the teachers of the runes to the various wights of the worlds (ifthese are not names taken by Wotan among the different beings): Óðinn among the gods, but Dáinn (“Dead One”) for the alfs,  Dvalinn for the dwarves,  Ásviðr for the etins,  I carved some myself. A similar description appears in Sigrdrífumál 18: after Óðinn’s learning of the runes, hescrapes them into the holy mead to send out and, These are with the gods these with the alfs, some with the wise Vanir, some with human beings. While many of the gods and goddesses have magical skills, Óðinn appears to be the chiefmagician among the gods--a role which may be quite ancient and widespread, as it appearsin an Old High German charm for a horse with a wounded foot: Wodan and Phol fared to the wood, then the lord’s horse broke its foot. Then chanted Sinthgunt, Sunna her sister, Then chanted Frija (Frigg), Folla her sister, Then chanted Wodan as well he was able, Thus be the bone-sprain, thus be the limb-sprain, thus be the blood-sprain, bone to bone limb to limb blood to blood so be the binding.Many other versions of this charm appear, including one with Jesus as the master magician;"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"90in all cases, the chanting of less-able wights, deities, heroes, or saints as the case may be, isclimaxed by the working of the most powerful sorcerer. As well as a magician and poet, Wotan is also a traveller. It is he who goes down to thegates of Hel or into Jötunheimr in search of information; it is also he who appears onMiddle-Earth most often and has the most direct dealings with human beings. While this isusually for his own purposes--raising up and collecting his heroes or causing strife--it canalso be seen that he is the god with the most immediate interest in the human realm. Thórr’sbattles are always on the supernatural plane, whether he is fighting giants or the MidgardSerpent; he is seldom seen walking upon the earth. Wotan, in contrast, wanders in and outof the sagas, advising his heroes and arranging things as they should go. Unlike Thórr, whoalways travels with a friend or two (usually Loki and his human servants Thjálfi andRöskva), Wotan goes alone on his quests. What is remarkable is that, although many of his activities seem to be those of personsnormally set slightly apart from their society (when they are not downright anti-social),Wotan seems to be, if not quite the Jupiter-like patriarch often envisioned from Snorri’sdescription, a god well-integrated into the community of gods. He is the husband of Frigg,who seems to deal chiefly with domestic matters and keeping the peace in the hall (as shedoes in Lokasenna, where she reminds Óðinn and Loki that no one wants to hear about thehorrible things they did in their youth). He is also the father of Thórr, the mighty-theweddefender of gods and men alike, who, more than any other deity, seems to embody thesocial norms of the Viking Age: honest, straightforward, physically strong, possessed of anintelligence more practical than abstract, with a strong sense of propriety and responsibility.Óðinn is not above teasing his son (as happens in Hárbarðzljóð, where he appears indisguise and taunts Thórr until the latter is ready to hit him with his Hammer); but there isnever any indication of active conflict between them, nor that one considers himself theeffective superior of the other. Part of the ease of Wotan’s integration into the godly community probably stems fromthe importance of his chief function: as death-god, he holds a very special place in therelationship between the dead and the living which is one of the mainstays of Norse (or anyother traditional) religion. Death, the dead, and the powers stemming from the world of thedead were not something to be carefully pushed aside or hedged off: they were, as has beendiscussed already, a vital part of the psychological and spiritual wholeness of Scandinavianlife. A second element, however, can also be seen in the presence of Wotan’s blood-brotherLoki. A giant who has sworn blood-brotherhood with Wotan and is therefore admitted tothe ranks of the gods, Loki appears, most of the time, as a classical Trickster figure similarto the Native American Coyote (and, often, not all that dissimilar from Wile E. Coyote inthe Roadrunner cartoons). He typically gets the gods into trouble, then gets them out of it,often improving their situation in the process but suffering some pain and embarrassmenthimself as a result of his tendency to over-elaborate his clever plans. It is Loki, for instance,who cuts off the hair of Thórr’s wife Sif: to make up for it (and save his life), he gets somedwarves to forge hair of real gold for her, plus Freyr’s ship Skíðblaðnir, which can run overboth water and air and be folded down small enough to fit in a pocket, and Óðinn’s spearGungnir. Then, thrilled with his own success, Loki bets his head against the dwarf Brokk’sthat nothing better can be forged. Brokk’s brother promptly forges Freyr’s boarGullinbursti, which can run over water and air as well as land and shines like the sun,Óðinn’s ring Draupnir, which drops nine gold rings of weight equal to its own every ninthnight, and Thórr’s hammer Mjöllnir. The gods decide that Brokk’s offerings are the best;Loki gets out of losing his head by arguing that he said nothing about his neck andtherefore Brokk cannot touch it, but the dwarf gets his own back by sewing up Loki’s lips. Like Wotan, Loki is often involved in getting things from the Otherworld for the gods(though sometimes he is responsible for their loss in the first place); like Wotan, he isverbally skilled and often considered to be untrustworthy. Unlike Wotan, however, Lokifrequently appears as a humorous figure, often the originator of jokes and just as often theirbutt. And unlike Wotan, Loki is always perceived as something of an outsider--as the Lordof Misrule, the Trickster-clown whose inversion of social norms helps to reinforce thestructure of society, and who therefore must eventually be cast out or otherwise suppressed."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"91In “The Problem of Loki”, de Vries, having made an extremely strong case for the originalrole of Loki as culture-hero, comments that, “Othin is certainly rather the positive, and Lokithe negative side of the culture-hero type. This is already evident in the tale of theirrobberies: Othin steals the mead from the giants and for the benefit of mankind, but Loki onthe contrary steals Iðunn from the gods to deliver her into the power of the demons. This is,indeed, exactly the contrast between the culture-hero and the trickster-deceiver”. By embodying the humorous and undignified on the one hand (at one point, in order tomake the giantess Skaði laugh, Loki ties one end of a rope to a goat and the other to histesticles), and, on the other, the forces of treachery and destruction (he is the father of theWolf Fenrir, the Midgard Serpent, and the goddess Hel, and fights against the gods at theworld’s end), Loki takes a certain amount of the shadow from Wotan. His presence clarifiesthe line between the insider and the outsider: though Wotan may steal, break oaths, andbetray in order to serve his various purposes, his long-range goals and basic functions can,in the flickering light shed by Loki, be seen as directly constructive; whereas with Loki’spranks, though the outcome is often constructive, there is a sense that mischievous humouris always verging on long-range disaster. Loki’s presence helps to keep Wotan’s placeamong the gods clear and firmly set; by scrambling roles and social norms in his ownperson, Loki, like other traditional Tricksters, makes it possible to keep the roles and rulesof godly society sharply delineated.Wotan and his Heroes “Greatly ill-willing I think Óðinn to be, and fearful am I of his thoughts . . . ” (Hákonarmál 15) “Here are many come against us together now . . . but I cannot recognise Óðinn here; yet I have the strongest suspicion that he must be rising up against us, the false and untrothful son of Herjan . . . ” (Hrólfs saga kraka ok Bjarkarímur. Finnur Jónsson, ed. Copenhagen: Møller, 1904, p.105) These latter words, according to legend, were spoken by the were-bear Böðvar-Bjarki inhis last battle beside his liege-lord Hrólfr kraki; in the Latin version of Bjarki’s verses, thebear-hero speaks of his desire to fight with the betraying god in person. The god’s ill-favour here is easy to explain: Óðinn has helped Hrólfr and his band with good advicewhen they risked their lives by guesting with their enemy King Aðils in Uppsala, but whenhe met them again and offered them strange-looking weapons of black iron, they refusedthe gift. Yet Hrólfr is not alone in the band of Wotan-heroes who fall before their god. SaxoGrammaticus tells the tale of Harald War-Tooth, charmed against the bite of iron by thegod and always eager to make offerings to him--who, in his last battle, is brought down bythe hand of the god himself. Óðinn disguises himself as the king’s charioteer, telling theaged and blind Harald “with a small smile upon his face” that Harald’s enemies have linedup against him in a svínfylking (swine-wedge) arrangement. This formation had been taughtto Harald by Óðinn, and by this news, he knows that the god has turned against him. Óðinnhimself cannot withdraw the invulnerability against sharp edges he has given Harald--so,when the time has come, he turns around and clubs Harald to death. Wotan’s heroes live chancy lives. On the one hand, they get the help and guidance of thegod, his manifold gifts and the promise of victory while it pleases him, and it is good tohave his favour: as Freyja explains to the etin-woman Hyndla, “Let us bid Host-Father in good heart to sit! He pays out and gives gold to his followers he gave to Hermóðr helm and byrnie and to Sigmundr a sword to receive. To some he gives victory and wealth to some,"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"92 wisdom to many and man-wit to men, he gives winds to sailors, word-skill to skalds, he gives manfulness to many warriors”(Hyndluljóð 2-3). On the other hand, the god’s heroes know that in the end they will see him come againstthem, to claim their lives as his own booty: to embrace Wotan is to embrace death, to takeup one’s place in Valhalla. The choice of being a Wotan-hero is often the choice ofAchilles: a short and glorious life, or a long and peaceful one--though sometimes with athird option that was not given to the Greek hero: a long life bright with victories, butlacking peace, and fuller than usual of trouble and pain . . . the hero sharing in thesufferings the old god himself feels, paying the same prices he pays for what he is driven byneed to do. The sharp distinction between the Wotan-hero and the ordinary person is brought out bythe story of Starkaðr in Gautreks saga. The young Starkaðr is on the island with KingVíkarr when the omens direct that the king be sacrificed, and a mock sacrifice, asmentioned above, is therefore planned. Starkaðr’s foster-father, an old man calledHrosshárgrani (Horse-hair Mustache), takes him to a house on another island where thereare many people gathered. There, Thórr and the old man--Wotan--set to shaping Starkaðr’sfuture in a manner similar to the magical duelling of the fairies who shape the future ofSleeping Beauty--each unable to directly undo the work of the other, but doing their best tocounteract blessings and curses. Thórr cursing him (since he holds an ancestral grudgeagainst Starkaðr, who is the grandson of a giant by the same name) and Wotan blessinghim. Thórr says that Starkaðr shall have no descendants; Wotan grants him a lifespan thricenormal; Thórr adds that he shall do a nithing-work (dastardly deed) in each lifespan. Wotansays that Starkaðr shall have the best weapons and clothes; Thórr says that he shall neverhold land; Wotan says that he shall always have riches; Thórr says that his gold will neverbe enough to meet his needs. Wotan states that Starkaðr shall always have victory in battle;Thórr, that he shall receive a grievous wound in every fight. Wotan says that he shall makepoetry as fast as he can speak; Thórr says that he shall remember none of it. Wotan saysthat Starkaðr shall be a friend to princes and the best folk; Thórr adds that the commonpeople shall always hate him. With his fate thus set, Starkaðr returns to his war band andperforms the first of his nithing-works: the slaying of his friend King Víkarr in the mock-sacrifice. Barred from ordinary peace or contentment, he then wanders for two hundredyears, collecting scars and leaving tales, doing Wotan’s work where-ever he goes--not acomfortable fate, but a fate of greatness nevertheless. The ancient, gray-haired Starkaðr,who is still as eager for battle at the end of his long journeying as he was at the beginning,often seems to echo Óðinn as he urges men such as the young prince Ingeld on to battle andrevenge: if he is not an avatar of the god, he at least seems to represent him and do his workin Miðgarðr. However, the essence of the relationship between Wotan and his heroes is nowhereexpressed as fully as in the death of Sigmundr the Völsung. Like Starkaðr’s, Sigmundr’scareer has been long and tumultuous. It begins when a one-eyed man in a broad cloakenters his father’s hall and drives a sword into the tree that holds the hall-roof up--a swordwhich, it turns out, can only be drawn by the young Sigmundr. Thereafter, his heroic stringof successful battles shadowed by more than a decade of lurking in the woodland to takerevenge on his sister’s husband who had slain their father and brothers (during the course ofwhich he fathers a son, Sinfjötli, on his sister and later turns into a werewolf with the boy).Then, after he has regained his place as a warleader, he loses Sinfjötli to his first wife’spoison. Undaunted, Sigmundr weds again, but is ambushed by an unsuccessful suitor of hisnew wife Hjördís. In the battle, (Sigmundr) had both arms bloody to the shoulders. But when the battle had gone on for some time, then came into the fight a man with a wide hat and blue-black cloak. He had one eye and a casting-spear in his hand. This man came against King Sigmundr and brandished the spear before him; and when King Sigmundr hewed"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"93 against him, the sword struck on the spear, and it broke asunder in two parts . . . Hjördis came among the slain after the battle at night, and came to the place where King Sigmundr lay, and asked if he could be healed. But he answered, “Many live when there is little hope of it, but my luck has turned from me, so that I will not be healed. It is not Óðinn’s will that I draw sword again, since now it is broken. I have had my battles as long as it pleased him . . . You are carrying a boy-child. Rear him well and carefully, and that boy shall be the best and most famed of our clan. Ward well also the sword’s pieces. From them shall be made a good sword, which shall be called Gramr and our son shall bear it and carry out many great works with it which shall never grow old, and his name shall live while the world lasts. Content yourself with that. But I am weary with my wounds, and I must now go to visit my kinsmen who have gone before me”. (Völsunga saga, pp. 28-29). Sigmundr’s view of the god who gave him his sword, guided him in his long waiting forrevenge, took up the body of his son, and has now taken his life, is very clearly the view ofa thane (an oath-bound member of a warband) to his drighten (the leader of the warband, orcomitatus). The leader of the warband seals his pledge of responsibility to his men with thegifts he gives them. In an earthly warband, these gifts are usually gold arm-rings (a leaderwas typically described as a “ring-giver”), byrnies, helms, and weapons; with the swordWotan gives Sigmundr, the god also gives the promise of victory and luck. In return, thethane gives his loyalty and help--and, when the time comes, he lays down his life in battlefor his drighten. The death of a Wotan-hero is more than an ordinary death in battle for one’s lord,however: it is, after all, Wotan’s choice as to who shall fall, and Wotan who gains by thedeaths of his followers as well as by their foes. They can, in fact, be seen as holy sacrifices--a relationship made explicit in the death of King Víkarr, who, according to Hálfs saga okHálfsrekka, was given to the god only shortly after his conception, but allowed to grow anddo battle until Wotan chose to take him as a sacrifice. The death of the hero HelgiHunding’s-Bane is presented in a similar manner: “Dagr, the son of Högni (whom Helgihad killed in order to win Högni’s daughter Sigrún as his bride), made an offering to Óðinnfor avenging his father. Óðinn lent Dagr his spear. Dagr found Helgi, his kinsman, at theplace which is called Fetter-Grove. He went against Helgi with the spear. Helgi fell there.”When Dagr tells his sister Sigrún what she has done, she curses him, to which he replies, “Óðinn alone shaped all ill, because among siblings strife-runes he bore.”The “Fetter-Grove” of this poem has often been associated with the holy grove of theSemnones which Tacitus talks about, a place given to the “god who rules all” where humansacrifice is practiced, and which “no one enters . . . unless he has been bound with a cord”. For Helgi to be killed with Óðinn’s spear in a grove whose name hints strongly at anassociation with the god, and to be received in Valhalla afterwards, suggests that, indeed,his death is an offering to Óðinn. A similar scene appears in the German version of the story of the Völsungs andNibelungs. While the Norse Sigurðr is murdered in his bed by a half-brother of Gunnar andHögni (very possibly introduced to save the honour of the two epic heroes), his Germanincarnation, Sigvrit (Siegfried), is speared from behind in a woodland by Hagen. In thisversion of the story, not only is Hagen an older advisor to Gunther whose counsel is usuallyharsh and martial, but sensibly cautions; but according to Continental tradition (as told inthe Latin epic poem Waltharius and the lengthy Norse rendition of German heroic tales,Thiðriks saga), he is also one-eyed, having lost the other in a duel with his blood-brotherWalther of Aquitaine. Questions can fairly be raised as to how much memory of Wotanmight have survived to the time of Nibelungenlied’s composition (early 1200’s; it bridgesthe gap between heroic epic and chivalric romance), or whether the poet(s) or hearerswould have recognised the image of the wise warrior with graying hair, single eye, andupraised spear as reflecting Wotan. It can, however, be observed that the roots of the story"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"94reach back at least to the Migration Age (an older origin has been argued for someparticulars), and that thus, while it cannot be claimed that the death of Sigvrit inNibelungenlied is told as a sacrifice to Wotan (a thought which might have horrified thepoet), it is possible that the oral sources on which the poem was based could, indeed, havepreserved a sacrificial memory. The death of Siegfried has often been compared to the death of Wotan’s own son Baldras described by Snorri Sturluson in the Prose Edda and alluded to in Völuspá (a verydifferent version of the story is told by Saxo Grammaticus). Both heroes are renderedinvulnerable (Siegfried by bathing in the blood of the dragon, Baldr by virtue of his motherFrigg demanding an oath from everything in the nine worlds not to harm him); both,however, have one fatal flaw in their protection (a linden-leaf stuck to Siegfried’s shoulder-blade, leaving that spot uncovered; Frigg forgot to ask an oath of the mistletoe, since shethought it was too weak to do Baldr any harm). In both cases, the weak spot is discoveredby a clever ruse (Loki disguises himself as an old woman and interrogates Frigg; Hagengets Siegfried’s wife to mark the vulnerable spot on Siegfried’s tunic for him, telling herthat he wants to be able to protect the hero’s back in battle); in both cases, a harmless gamebecomes the opportunity for the killing (Hagen challenges Siegfried to race to a certainstream after a day’s hunting and spears him in the back there; when the gods are laughinglythrowing weapons at the invulnerable Baldr, Loki puts the arrow of mistletoe in the hand ofBaldr’s blind brother Höðr and aims it). A clear connection between Siegfried and Baldr cannot, perhaps, be proven (though itmay be suspected). However, Baldr’s death has several elements which may, again, hint ata Wotanic sacrificial original. The most direct of these is Úlfr Uggason’s description of himas a holy sacrifice in the verses of Húsdrápa (8-9) describing Óðinn’s place in the funeralprocession: Well-known Hropta-Týr (Óðinn) rides to his son’s wide bale-fire . . . There I know that valkyries follow the wise victory-tree (warrior) and ravens, to the holy sacrifice’s blood. The image of Wotan, valkyries, and ravens faring together towards the blood of a sacrificeis a sight more typical of a battlefield than of a mourning procession--and one whichsuggests that Wotan has more in mind than mourning. Regarding Snorri’s description ofBaldr’s death itself, the seemingly harmless shaft which suddenly becomes fatal appearsboth in the death of King Vîkarr (where, again a third party becomes the unwitting agent ofthe subject’s doom) and in Styrbjarnar þáttr, where, after King Eiríkr the Victory-Blessedhas sacrificed to Óðinn for victory (and promised the god his own life in return), Óðinngives the king a reed to cast over Styrbjörn’s host; as Eiríkr speaks the words, “Óðinn haveyou all!”, the reed becomes the spear that designates the enemy army as sacrifices, whichthe god promptly takes. The name “Höðr” means “warrior”, and the “blind warrior” caneasily be seen as another form of Wotan, who also goes by the names “Blindi” (Blind),“Tvíblindi” (Twice-Blind), “Helblindi” (Death-Blind), and “Gunnblindi” (Battle-Blind). That this version of Baldr’s death may well be ancient is supported by the “Three-GodBracteates” from Denmark, which the noted German scholar Karl Hauck interprets asrepresentations of the slaying. The bracteate from Fakse (Denmark) shows a man with aring in his left hand and a half-broken twig jutting down from his solar plexus; he standsinside a roughly sketched enclosure. Behind him stands a man with a spear; before him, awinged man wearing a feminine skirt and holding a ring. A bird of prey hovers over hishead. The man with the spear can easily be seen as Wotan: the other as Loki--who is knownto have borrowed Freyja’s falcon-hide (Thrymskviða, Haustlöng) and also to have disguisedhimself as a woman on several occasions, including the events in connection with Baldr’sdeath. The bracteate from Beresina-Raum shows the same grouping, except that the figurein feminine garb stands within the semi-enclosure and holds the twig up--the shot has notyet been fired. The one from Gummerup has the foremost figure holding a sword as well asa ring; the twig is shooting overhead--perhaps, again, suggesting the sacrificial dedication."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"95 Karl Hauck interprets the ring which Baldr is holding as Draupnir, Wotan’s armringwhich he put on his son’s funeral pyre, and suggests that here, it appears as the symbol ofBaldr’s sacrifice. According to Hauck, it is possible that in the oldest version of the story(as it appears on the bracteates), Wotan gave Baldr the ring while Baldr was still alive, tomark him out for doom. The fenced enclosure is particularly interesting because, in the areafrom which these bracteates stem, a number of place-names go back to an original“Óðinn”s enclosure”, in which the particular term for “enclosure” seems to describe aconstruction of wood. In Snorri’s version of the story, immediate vengeance cannot betaken on Höðr because the slaying occurred in a “peace-stead”--a term which mightlikewise refer to a specific holy enclosure. The bird of prey may, as Hauck suggests,represent a baleful battle-wight whose appearance is a sign of Baldr’s doom, or it may beone of Wotan’s birds ready, like the ravens of Húsdrapa, to take its part in the sacrifice. But why should Wotan sacrifice his own beloved son in this manner? And why, if Baldris a sacrifice to his father, is his place readied in Hel instead of Valhalla? The answer isgiven in Völuspá 62 after the old world has been destroyed, a new one rises from the sea,and, Then shall unsown acres grow, all bales be made better, Baldr shall come; Höðr and Baldr shall dwell in Hroptr’s (Óðinn’s) victory-abodes, well, the slain-gods, would you know more, or what?Although Wotan himself has fallen in his fight against the Wolf Fenrir, Baldr’s earlierdeath--and safe housing in Hel--make it possible for him to come back after Ragnarök andtake his father’s place: for Wotan, in effect, to live again in his son. Just as Sigmundr iscontent to pass to Valhalla in the knowledge of Sigurðr’s coming birth and deeds, so theprophecy of the seeress answers the question of why Wotan does as he does. Thisknowledge, one may speculate, may also have something to do with the UnanswerableQuestion with which Wotan defeats the etin Vafþrúðnir in their riddle-game(Vafþrúðnismál 54): What did Óðinn say, before climbing on the funeral pyre, himself in the ear of his son?There is one secret that we know Wotan and Baldr share: the secret of passing into theworld of the dead to rise again more powerful, the secret by which the soul survives thedeath of its body (and, indeed, the very body of the cosmos) to come forth again. ThusBaldr, the hope of the gods, is reborn after Ragnarök, in the time when the survivors of thecatastrophe gather again, and judge of the mighty Miðgarð-Wyrm, and remember there of the great doom, and of Fimbultýr’s (Óðinn’s) ancient runes. There, afterwards, wonderfully, gold gaming-pieces in grass they find, those which in eldest days they had owned.The deaths of the gods are not wasted, for they are remembered: Wotan’s might, and that ofthe rest, lives on in the new world, and for that all the pain of Baldr’s death--and the deathsof all the other heroes who fall while doing the deeds of honoured memory, and the deathof Wotan himself--are, in the end, worthwhile. The new world bears its own Valhalla: theroad there is the dark road trodden by Baldr, as by his father before him. Neckel, Walhall Gods and Myths, pp. 142-43.

Some would say that the Norse godsmet their doom at the turn of the last millennium, when their children were forced by theirown rulers to turn away from the ways of their own culture and join christian Europe. Thelast great stead of heathenry to hold out, the temple at Old Uppsala, fell in the year 1100C.E.: thereafter the gods survived, if they lived at all, only in folk-stories, peasant charms,and garbled memory. The same had happened in Gaul, in Germany, in the British Isles: bythe year 1200, European religions survived only in Eastern Europe and among the Saami inthe far north of Scandinavia. However, when gods have been part of a people’s life for generations without counting,woven into the very words they speak--and, even more, when those gods have been thechief inspiration and source of their most prized art-form--the sprinkling of holy water andswinging of censers is seldom enough to get rid of them completely. Yet this feat hadlargely been managed over a few generations throughout most of Europe. The difference inIceland was made by two factors: first, the near-total dependence of skaldic poetry on anextensive knowledge of theological trivia, which required the preservation of myth if poetrywas to exist; second, the strange circumstances in which its conversion took place. In the year 1000 C.E., Iceland--a colony for whom survival was, at best, never easy--found itself torn from within, as well as threatened from without by Norway, its chief linkto the European mainland. The cause: Óláfr Tryggvason, a Norwegian king best known forinflicting frightful tortures on those who opposed him or refused to convert to christianity,had sent missionaries to Iceland and given his full support to the conversion (not to mentionthreatening to mutilate or kill those Icelanders visiting in Norway at the time), with theresult that Icelandic society was about to split asunder. At the Althing of 1000, however,both sides agreed that Iceland would have to live under one law, and the choice was turnedover to one Thórgeirr the Lawspeaker, himself a heathen. Thórgeirr is said to have gone“under the cloak” for a day and a half while he meditated on this. What he thought, or whathappened there, is unknown. Some speculate that his meditation may have actually been asoul-journey similar to that of the Northern Asian shaman, during which he sought out thegods and mighty spirits in order to find out what was best for Iceland. Or perhaps he mayhave entered a trance in order to peer into the Well of Wyrd: to see what must happen, andwhat should arise from it. Then again, he may simply have wished to be let alone while hecarefully weighed the words of those who had spoken to him and the worth of keeping theEuropean trade-roads open, balancing old troth to the gods against the peace and survival ofIceland’s people. In any case, when Thórgeirr came out from under the cloak, he had ajudgement: Iceland should become christian, but heathen practices should still be allowedin private. Unlike Norway, where Óláfr Tryggvason was later succeeded by the even morebrutal Óláfr the Stout (St. Óláfr), Iceland’s conversion took place with relatively littlebloodshed--without persecution, without officially sanctioned murders, and without activeattempts to wipe out traces of heathen religion. The Icelandic interest in preserving their history began to become apparent not long afterthe conversion. Íslendingabók (“Book of the Icelanders”), a history of the settlements, waswritten by Ari the Wise ca. 1130; and it is this book which tells of Thórgeirr’s going“under the cloak” and his subsequent decision. By the lifetime of Snorri Sturluson, thereseems to have been a great deal of antiquarian interest--indeed, a fascination with theHeathen past. The poems and tales of the gods were still common currency, and a briefoverview of any of the sagas is likely to show several examples of things done in the olddays “after ancient custom”. Heathen temples are described in great detail in Eyrbyggjasaga and Kjalnesinga saga, as are elements of heathen ritual--though there is muchdiscussion as to whether or not these descriptions preserve authentic memory of nativeshrines, or whether they are an antiquarian’s fantasy about his ancestors. Snorri Sturlusonhimself, of course, represents the flowering of the antiquarian fascination with"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"99Scandinavian religion: the desire to preserve the memory of the ancestral troth, codify it inunderstandable terms, and explain it being a vital part of the identity of the Icelanders, whowere, and are, still quite proud to be the descendants of strong Vikings and explorers. This interest continued throughout the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The Eddicpoems were written down, as were the histories of kings, stories about the settlement ofIceland (some chronicles, such as Sturlunga saga, continuing right up to the period inwhich they were written), and, finally, stories about heroes of old days and translations ofheroic tales from other lands (such as Þiðriks saga, a collection of German legends, andKarlamagnús saga, the saga of Charlemagne). In these stories, the presence of theScandinavian gods often appears both as part of the plot and as a means of setting the scenefirmly in the days of antiquity. Interestingly, the gods seldom appear directly in the sagas ofIcelanders, perhaps because those stories were a little too close to home--Egill Skalla-Grímsson, for instance, speaks about Óðinn regularly, but never sees him face-to-face. Thegods are more often present in the sagas of kings; and Óðinn, particularly, is a major actorin several of the fornaldarsögur, the “sagas of ancient times”--perhaps because, as the sagasgrew more literary and moved farther away from the daily activities of Icelandic life, itbecame safer to treat directly with the gods. However, even the most prosaic Icelandicfamily sagas contain skaldic verses, such verses often being included in order to validatethe authenticity of the prose framework describing the circumstances of their composition;and most of our surviving skaldic poems were preserved in this manner, which, in turn,preserved much valuable religious information. As Jónas Kristjánsson observes, “muchscaldic diction is closely connected with pagan religious beliefs . . . It is natural therefore toconsider all this under one head and to conclude that, like pictoral art, poetry was ahandmaid of religion--a connection that remained unbroken throughout the pagan period,no matter whether the subject-matter of the scaldic verse concerned the gods directly or not.Names of gods and valkyries had two-fold significance: in kennings they come in phrasesreferring to men and weapons and battle, and so serve one purpose; but at the same timethey serve another by inevitably drawing attention to the origins of the imagery in Heathenbelief and to the existence of the pagan deities and their intervention in human affairs--afterall, poetry itself was a gift from Óðinn.” A similar opinion was expressed more poetically in the late tenth century by Hallfrøðrvandræðaskáld (Troublesome-Skald, so nicknamed by Óláfr Tryggvason because he provedrather difficult to convert). Hallfrøðr observes sadly, The whole kindred of mankind have shaped poems for Óðinn’s favour, I remember the all-worthy occupation of our fore-fathers; but unwillingly--for Viðrir’s (Óðinn’s) rule suited the skald well-- I set foeship towards Frigg’s husband for we serve as Christ’s thralls.(These wistfully Heathen sentiments did not go over well with the king, and Hallfrøðr wasforced to make a second verse renouncing and speaking more sharply of his gods). Indeed,between the skalds, Snorri, and the sagas one might say that it was through the power ofWotan, god of poetic inspiration, that the memories of the Norse gods were preserved--thegod of life and strength drawn from death keeping his clan safe through the long years. A brief budding of interest in the old ways of Scandinavia took place in Sweden in thelate fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, with the “Storgoticism” (Great Gothic)movement founded by Johannes Magnus and taken up by Johannes Bureus. This movementseems to have been a reaction against the dominance of Classical culture and in favour of aspiritual identity for the “Gothic” or Scandinavian peoples (the Gothic tribes originated insouthern Sweden). However, this movement, though led by illustrious men (JohannesMagnus was the last Catholic Archbishop of Uppsala, and Johannes Bureus was the tutor ofKing Gustav Adolphus), was never large, nor was it long-lasting. A true, widespread revival of interest in native Northern religion did not really begin to"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"100occur until the nineteenth century, when a combination of the desire to define cultural andnational identity with the Romantic movement’s emphasis on internal spiritual discoverybegan to impel both scholars and artists to seriously look into the folklore and myth of theNorthern countries. Two key figures of the Teutonic revival were Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm, whosecollections of folktales have played a tremendous part in reintroducing native lore toEuropean and European-derived cultures. Jakob Grimm was also a serious philologist,folklorist and student of Germanic literature and mythology. Although dated and, bymodern standards, unreliable in many particulars, his great work Deutsche Mythologie(Teutonic Mythology) represents an early and rather brilliant attempt to link the folktalesand popular beliefs of the Northern countries with the mythological literature ofScandinavia. However, the Märchen or fairytales which he and his brother collected are ofparticular importance in this regard, as they represent the folk preservation of archetypesand of a traditional understanding about the way in which the human psyche functions: thestory of “Iron John”, for instance, has been explained by Robert Bly as a powerful guide tothe process of attaining manhood. In this way, the prevalence of the Grimm fairytales in modern culture has provided acertain psychic foundation: as in the case of “Iron John”, the basic elements of spiritualmaturation and initiation are frequently observable in these tales. Most of them start with ayoung man or a young woman who, with little preparation, finds him- or herself in asituation of danger or difficulty, able to rely only on her or his native abilities and whatassistance his or her actions have earned along the way. Proper conduct (honesty, open-handedness, kindness) is strongly reinforced: a gift of food to a hungry stranger is rewardedwith the advice necessary to avoid peril; disentangling a bird from a snare brings its help ina moment of need. On the opposite side of the coin, greed, cruelty, dishonesty, and so forthare punished in ways which are often toned down for modern sensibilities or deletedentirely (wicked stepmothers are forced to dance in shoes of red-hot iron or rolled downhills in barrels studded with spikes; the witch in “Hansel and Gretel” is roasted in her ownoven; the eyes of the wicked stepsisters in “Aschenputtel”, the German Cinderella, areplucked out by doves). Although good and evil are usually delineated quite sharply in thesestories, the moral code is not a christian one. The christian deity plays no part in the Grimmtales; responsibility, repayment, and vengeance when appropriate are the determiningvalues. The Northern antecedents of some of the Grimm stories can be directly identified. Manyfigures of the Northern spiritual world walk through the pages of these “fairytales”: thegiants, elementally huge and strong, keepers of much-desired treasure that can be won justas Wotan won the mead of poetry from their kingdom; people enchanted into the shapes ofbeasts and birds that can speak in human tongues and give advice; the dwarves, plotting andcrafting their smithwork in their underground halls. The tale of Sleeping Beauty, forinstance, includes the Scandinavian belief in “norns” or spirit-women who gather around anewborn in order to set its fate. “There are many norns, who come to every child that isborn to shape its life . . . Good norns from good kindred shape good lives, but those menwho have bad lives, they are ruled by ill norns.” The working of the “fairies” over SleepingBeauty is very similar to the working of Óðinn and Thórr over Starkaðr: none can takeaway the gifts or curses of another, but they can add their own to neutralize or mitigatewhat has already been spoken. Finally, as observed before, the plot itself is in many waysidentical to the story of Siegfried and Brünnhilde: in both cases, a small prick by a fateditem causes enchanted sleep (Sigrdrífumál has Óðinn sticking the valkyrie with a “sleep-thorn”); the woman is surrounded by an impenetrable barrier--thorns for Sleeping Beauty, awall of shields (Sigrdrífumál) or flame (Völsunga saga)--which only the destined man cancross; in due time, he makes his way through and awakens her. Similarly, we see the initiatory journey of the Bear’s Son--the strong, but oftenbumbling, youth who descends into the underworld, does battle with a monster for itstreasures, is betrayed by his comrades above, who attempt to abandon him, but makes hisway out by himself and ultimately triumphs--repeated in the story of the hero Beowulf(whose very name, “bee-wolf”, is a kenning for the honey-loving bear) and also echoed inthe stories of Siegfried. The tale of the Bear’s Son can be, and has been, seen as an heroic"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"101exemplum and as the retelling of a shaman’s journey into the Underworld; it could also beread as a metaphor for the exploratory journey into the dark cave of one’s ownunconscious. In all these cases, this tale, like many of the other Grimm stories, shows thedeep psychological and spiritual understanding expressed in what has survived of theNorthern tradition. But of the great minds of the nineteenth century who were inspired by the old tales ofthe North--who, one might say, tasted the drops of Wotan’s mead for the first time incenturies--undoubtedly the most powerful and most effective in bringing the gods back to arenewed life was not a scholar in anything but the most amateur sense of the word. He wasa composer and musical innovator who found in mediaeval German and Scandinavianliterature tales great enough to give his tremendous imagination free rein--Richard Wagner,through whose vision Wotan found his voice and raised his spear again. It is throughWagner’s Ring cycle that Wotan and his fellow gods have become best known in themodern world; it is Wagner’s Wotan who speaks for the old world--and dies with it. In following his own artistic vision, Wagner made a number of changes in his sources.The building of the walls of Ásgarðr by the giants and subsequent contract dispute, whichin the Norse myth is solved by Thórr breaking the builder’s skull, serves in Wagner as themeans by which the Ring comes into the hands of the giants, while the human tragedieswhich lead to Fáfnir’s theft of the hoard and metamorphosis into a dragon in the Old Norsesources are absent in Wagner. Most blatant, however, is Wagner’s treatment of the end ofthe story, and the world. To him, the death of Siegfried is the signal for the finalcatastrophe--the flames of Siegfried’s funeral pyre set Valhalla alight. Ironically, the loyalHagen, whose first concern in both the Norse sources and the German Nibelungenlied is forGünther, becomes Günther’s slayer in Götterdämmerung. In all the earlier works, Gutrune(Guðrún/Kriemhild) goes on after Siegfried’s death to marry Attila the Hun; Günther andHagen are then decoyed to Attila’s court and killed together with the flower of theBurgundian nobility--lovers of Wagner’s music can hardly forgive him for ending thewhole story where he did, when he might have given us another entire opera in the cycle! Wagner’s desire, however, was to show Wotan as a tragic hero: a god who is trapped byhis own power and ambition, and by the laws he himself has made and is bound to uphold,into bringing about his own end and the end of the world he has made. His portrayal of thegod is often sympathetic, even heart-rendingly so: Wotan is doomed to betray his humantwins Siegmund and Sieglinde; he is forced to punish his beloved daughter Brünnhilde fordoing his true will. When Wotan plaintively asks Mime during their riddle-game (speakingof the Wälsungs Siegmund and Sieglinde), “Which was that kindred to whom Wotanshowed himself cruel, though its life was most beloved to him?” (Siegfried, Act I, scene ii)Wagner shows us a more human side of the god: the sorrow Wotan feels when he mustbring about the deaths of the heroes he loves, and the way in which he is constrained by hisown wyrd to act--in Wagner, because his spear is the upholder of law; in the Norse sources,because he cannot change the doom that is already laid in the Well of Wyrd, but must dohis best to work around it so that a new world can be born and the might of the gods canlive again. In this respect, Wagner was very much a man of his own time: his most beloved vision,whether expressed light-heartedly, as in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, or with fulldramatic seriousness, as in the Ring Cycle and Parsifal, was of the young hero whoovercomes the old and established powers. In the Ring Cycle, it is Siegfried, unconstrainedby any ancient laws, bargains, or betrayals, who at last breaks the power of the gods--Siegfried, who shatters Wotan’s spear with his father’s reforged sword, as Wagner perhapsenvisioned his own art shattering the old world and creating one wholly new. For Siegfriedto be the hero Wagner demanded, he had to be completely free from the god’s self-madebindings: he had to prove his absolute freedom, and release the god as well, by breaking theemblem and source of Wotan’s power. The concept is late nineteenth-century rather thanHeathen: the idea of casting off the might of the old, of facing and destroying theembodiment of what has gone before and shaped the present situation, could never haveoccurred to a Norseman of the Viking Age--any more than the notion that a human beingcould break Wotan’s spear. It is less, however, in Wagner’s reworking of the plots for his sources than in his music"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"102and imagery--especially the scenes drawn directly from Norse religious literature--thatWotan’s force truly strides forth upon the stage: and this is where the god still touches thesoul today. When Wotan goes in night and wind to awaken the ancient prophetess Erda andcall her up from the depths (Siegfried, Act III, scene i), those watching see something,perhaps, very close to what the Norse would have seen upon hearing the poem upon whichthe scene is based, Óðinn rose up, the ancient Gaut, and upon Sleipnir the saddle laid. Hence rode he downwards into Misty-Hel, he met that hound from Hel that came. He was bloody about the breast, at Galdr-Father barked he long forth rode Óðinn, the earth-ways thundered, he came to the high gates of Hel. Óðinn rode then before eastern door, where he knew lay the völva’s tomb, he began to speak spells of the slain, till the corpse rose and spoke to him (Baldrs draumar 2-4). Wotan’s riddle-game with the dwarf Mime, a contest inspired by Vafþrúðnismál, showsanother side of the god--the wily Wanderer, creeping about in disguise to learn and workhis will. And Wotan stands in all his ancient, awesome and terrible strength as the god ofbattle-death in Siegmund’s fight with Hunding, stretching out his spear to shatter the hero’ssword and claim Siegmund’s life for his own (though, alas, Siegmund is cheated of hismagnificent last words by the demands of stage drama). If the Ring Cycle was not meant asa Bühnenweihfestspiel, or ritual drama, in quite the same way as Parsifal, at least we cansay that in his best moments, Wagner manages to evoke Wotan and bring his might forthfor humans to feel as they did in the ancient days when his voice howled in the snow-ladenwinter winds and roared above the storms of battle--or sang through the words of the skaldwithin the firelit hall. Unfortunately, Romanticism and radical artistic vision were not the only forces workingupon Western Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, nor were they theonly ones which engaged the power of ancestral symbols. In addition to Grimm’s scholarlyand Wagner’s artistic works, a number of small extremist political parties and journals alsoadopted the names of Norse gods and heroes in order to give their views a veneer oflegitimacy in the context of Germanic culture. And, of course, it was one of those partiesthat eventually devoured Germany beneath the emblem that had been the sign of holy andmagical power on the bracteates of the Migration Age, on runestones, and on tapestriessuch as that with which the Oseberg queen was buried--the swastika. The depth of the tainton that emblem, even in the most innocent contexts, can perhaps be seen in this relativelyfrivolous example: even as a dedicated researcher in early Germanic religion, it took me avery long time of gazing at amulets and fine metalwork made some fifteen hundred yearsbefore the Nazi banner was ever raised before I could see the symbol without a shudder--nomatter that it had set on those pieces by craftsmen who had nothing else in mind than goodluck and the blessing of the gods, who had no concept of nineteenth- and twentieth-centuryideas of racial identity, let alone of racial genocide. The question of the degree to which elements of the Nazi party were inspired by nativeGermanic religion and culture is a difficult one to answer. The anti-Semitism of the Naziphilosophy is relatively easy to trace to its origins, which have nothing to do with Wotan,Germanic religion, or native Northern European culture--no Jews (or any other race) arevilified in the sagas, nor is there any suggestion that the early Teutonic peoples wereparticularly conscious of the concept of race. Rather, the blame can be laid directly uponteachings of christianity, from the Church Fathers to mediaeval Europe. As Rabbi Dr."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"103Cohn-Sherbok observes in The Crucified Jew: Twenty Centuries of Christian Anti-Semitism, he foundation of European anti-Semitism was set by such writings asAugustine’s “Tract Against the Jews”, which argues that the Biblical denunciations againstIsrael’s iniquities apply strictly to the Jews, while the divine promises for the nation ofIsrael were meant to indicate the christian Church; that the Jews are, in fact, the enemies ofGod. Other tracts in a similar vein--the Patristic Adversos Judaeos tradition--includeCyprian’s Three Books of Testimonies Against the Jews, Ephrem’s Rhythm Against theJews, Aphrahat’s Demonstrations Against the Jews, and Hippolytus’ Expository TreatiseAgainst the Jews, as well as a great many more works in a similar vein, which place theblame for Christ’s death specifically upon the Jews and identify them as a people whomgood christians should consider accursed. Good christians took this up eagerly: Crusaderson their way to the Holy Land warmed up their sword-arms by slaughtering European Jews,as in the great massacres of Speyer (May 3, 1096), Worms, and Mainz, which preceded theFirst Crusade, the similar incidents throughout France and Germany at the beginning of theSecond Crusade, and the butchering of the Jewish populations of London, York, Norwich,Stamford, and Lynn as a prelude to the Third Crusade. In 1290, the Jews were brutallyexpelled en masse from England; rumours of ritual murder, well-poisoning, and otheratrocities became common, finding a place even in the best of literature with Chaucer’sappalling “Prioresse’s Tale”, which shows a band of Jews--by nature identifiable with thedevil, as is made explicit by the Prioresse’s lines, “Oure firste foo, the serpent Sathanas, /That hath in Jues herte his waspes nest” --killing a small child and hiding his body in aheap of dung (and exults appallingly in the punishments meted out to them).

During the mid-fourteenth century, while the Black Death raged, matters became evenworse: the Jews were accused particularly of poisoning wells and causing plague by othernefarious means. The first massacres took place in France in 1348, and spread from therethroughout Europe; “In all, sixty large and one hundred and fifty smaller communities arebelieved to have been exterminated and three hundred and fifty massacres of variousdimensions took place.” The chief cultural motivation behind these massacres seems tohave been the general Church presentation of the Jew as demonic or even as Antichrist,which had festered in Europe for some time; Ziegler observes that “The Black Deathconcentrated this fear and hatred of the Jews into one burning grievance which not onlydemanded vengeance but offered the tempting extra dividend that, if the Jews could only beeliminated, then the plague for which they were responsible might vanish too.” The hostility of late mediaeval christianity against the Jews was taken up and furtheredenthusiastically by the Protestant movement, as shown in Martin Luther’s pamphlet, “Ofthe Jews and their Lies”, in which the author comments that “The Jews, being foreigners,should possess nothing, and what they do possess should be ours,” offering a fully plannedsolution which would be taken up with a vengeance later, First, that their synagogues or schools be set on fire, and what will not burn should be heaped over or covered with earth so that no one may ever be able to see a stone or cinder of it. And this should be done for the honour of our Lord and of Christianity in order that God may see that we are Christians . . . Secondly, that their homes likewise be broken down and destroyed . . . Thirdly, that all their prayer books and Talmuds in which such idolatry, lies, cursing, and blasphemy are taught be taken away. Fourthly, their rabbis must be forbidden under threat of death to teach any more . . . Fifthly, that passport and travelling privileges should be absolutely forbidden to the Jews, for they have nothing to do on the land . . . Sixthly, that usury be forbidden"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"104 to them . . . Seventhly, let the young and strong Jews and Jewesses be given the flail, the axe, the hoe, the spade, the distaff, and spindle, and let them earn their bread by the sweat of their noses(Walter Bienert. Martin Luther und die Juden: Ein Quellenbuch. Frankfurt: EvangelischesVerlagswerk, 1982, pp. 149-150). Indeed, Martin Luther’s suggestions, offered here to the “overlords who have Jews inyour domain . . . so that we may be pure of the Jewish burden” lacked only the inscription“Arbeit Macht Frei” (“Work Makes You Free”) over the door of the labour camp. Badenough for their own time, Luther’s words are a bone-chilling prophecy of horror fulfilledto the reader of the post-Holocaust age. Neither Wotan nor the Heathen past of theGermanic peoples can be blamed for European anti-Semitism, which was by no meansconfined to Germany. Rather, it can be clearly observed that even in the late nineteenth andearly twentieth centuries, “The Christian age-old conception of the Jew as a demonic andevil force animated Christian consciousness and evoked considerable resistance toproposals for the acceptance of Jewry as equal citizens in the modern world”. Anti-christian as much of the Nazi philosophy was, many of the most appalling crimes of theThird Reich were solidly rooted in the long-term doctrines and practices of christianity,from its early days on through the twentieth century. Nevertheless, such activities as Himmler’s attempt to de-christianize his SS men byreplacing Christmas with a solstice celebration and church ceremonies such as marriage andbaptism with his own rituals certainly gave the impression of a strong neo-Pagan influence,especially to outsiders. Runes were used as emblems, their jagged spikes giving a dramaticflair to badges and rings. The most notorious of these uses, of course, was the doubleSowilo-rune (s) or “lightning-bolt” of the SS (the term “lightning-bolt” for this rune isactually a misnomer: the name of the rune is “Sun” in all the rune-poems). To this day, theS-rune remains almost as tainted as the swastika: in the German edition of StephanGrundy’s novel Rhinegold, which includes several runic inscriptions, the standard S-formof the Sowilo rune had to be replaced with a sporadically occurring alternate form. Otherexamples of runic use by the SS included the Viking Age rune Hagall, “Hail” ( ) as thesign for the Lebensborn foundation, which encouraged the reproduction of the “raciallysound” outside the normal bounds of marriage. An interesting, if somewhat eccentric, contemporary English book, Germany Possessed(by one H.G. Baynes, published in 1941), actually argues that the conditions in Germanywere due to the uncontrolled powers of Wotan, the embodiment of the furor Teutonicus,raging through the souls of his people. The tone of this rather peculiar work is that of achristian Englishman ascribing the political situation to the awakening of a pagan madnessfrom the barbaric past. Interesting as the social attitudes revealed by Germany Possessedmay be, Bayne’s view of the psychic underpinnings of the Third Reich was a response tothe pomp and pageantry of the Nazi regime--not to its substance. In fact, neo-Paganism was far too strange for most racists of the nineteenth andtwentieth centuries (with a few exceptions such as the odd mystic Guido List, who alsotaught the eighteen-stave “Armanen Futhark”, a new runic alphabet revealed to him duringa temporary period of blindness). A much more popular form of religion was “Ario-christianity”: the belief that Jesus had not been a Jew, but really a blond-haired, blue-eyedIndo-European, and that therefore christianity belonged properly to the German people.This belief was put forth by, among others, Jörg Lanz, producer of an Austrian magazinecalled Ostara, which enjoyed a surprisingly wide circulation, well out of proportion to theactual value of its contents. Hitler himself, as his table-conversations show, had little patience with any form oforganized religion: Providence and Destiny were as far as he was willing to go. In MeinKampf, he roundly thrashed the neo-Germanists: it is entirely out of harmony with the spirit of the nation to keep harping on that far-off and forgotten nomenclature which belongs to the ancient Germanic times . . . I had to warn followers repeatedly against those wandering scholars who were"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"105 peddling German folk-lore and who never accomplished anything positive or practical . . . we considered the friendship of such people as not only worthless, but even dangerous to our young movement. The neo-Pagans fared even worse in Hitler’s estimation, for a very revealing reason, The impression which I often get, especially of those so-called religious reformers whose creed is grounded on ancient Germanic customs, is that they are the missionaries and protégés of those forces which do not wish to see a national revival taking place in Germany. All their activities tend to turn the attention of the people away from the necessity of fighting together in a common cause against the common enemy, the Jew. The chief interest in the rites of the Germanic past stemmed from Alfred Rosenberg andHeinrich Himmler, but in a highly edited form. The chief purpose of the research supportedby Himmler’s Ahnenerbe was not to retrieve the ancestral past, but to make it fit with theNazi ideology. An example of this is shown, for instance, by the rather amusing treatmentof Bronze Age women’s costume by historical researchers of the Third Reich. SinceGermanic women were supposed to be chaste by racial nature, the Egtved Girl, who wasburied in only a short blouse and rather revealing string skirt, was always shown wearing along and dignified woven skirt--“but as the corded skirt was after all a fact, one couldsometimes see it sketched in as an overskirt above the long one!” The SS solstice rites and family rituals were chiefly a product of the fantasies ofHimmler and Rosenberg: in an address to his Grüppenführers in November of 1936,Himmler seriously explained how, in the days of their forefathers the period between thespring festival and the summer solstice had been a time when the youth of each village,each Gau, engaged in contests for the selection of the fittest. They were tested intellectuallyin the wisdom of theirforefathers, and physically in games and races, both girls and boys. Then it was usual for the youth of each year group to dance and skip with one another to the solstice festival. There marriages were sealed . . . I propose that the sporting contests of the SS, which we will hold every year, always take place between Easter and the summer solstice. Then at the summer solstice the prize-giving will take place . . . As the leader of the SS, Himmler was able to enforce their solstice celebrations.However, he had relatively little success in convincing his men to abandon their traditionalchristianity in favour of his newly created rituals and symbols. “The SS-women hungered,before Christmas, for the christian festival gleam--every year a stream of “Yulecandlesticks” and “Yule plates” flowed from the Allacher factory to the SS families . . . Inactuality, Himmler”s neo-pagan customs remained limited to paper.” It must also be observed that, in his SS religion, Himmler made no attempt to revive theactual gods and goddesses of the Germanic peoples. Quite the contrary: his chiefinspirational text, which he claimed to have with him constantly, was the Bhavad-Gita; hissources a mixed bag including “the Bhavad-Gita, the Eddas, the Vedas and the Rig-Vedas,the sayings of Buddha, the Vesudi-Magga, the Book of Purity, and some astrologicalworks.” The religion Himmler compounded from this eclectic collection was amonotheistic one, arranged by Herr Gott (Lord God)--or “Got”, as the SS took to spellingthe word--“allegedly the old Germanic spelling, but it was chiefly useful, probably, todistinguish the SS God from the conventional Christian Gott”. His spiritual mentor, a mangoing by the assumed name of Karl Maria Weisthor (actually Karl Maria Willigut), hadcreated his own religious history based on sources revealed through his ancestral memory(to which, as a self-described descendant of ancient Aryan priesthoods, he of course hadaccess) -a decidedly peculiar vision of history with little affection for Wotan, whose clearlydefined and undeniable character was difficult to reconcile with the chief elements of"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"106Ariosophist philosophy. According to Willigut, Around 12,500 B.C. the Irminist religion of Krist was proclaimed, becoming the universal faith of the Germans until it was challenged by the schismatic Wotanists. In 9600 B.C. a climax occurred in the continuous wars between the two religions. Baldur-Chrestos, a holy prophet of Irminism, was crucified by Wotanists at Goslar . . . The Wotanists ultimately succeeded in destroying the Irminist sacred centre at Goslar in 1200 B.C. and the Irminists founded a new temple at the Externsteine near Detmold. But this was taken by the Wotanists in 460 before being finally sacked in its corrupt form by Charlemagne during his campaign against the pagan Saxons in the ninth century. To finally mark the incompatibility between SS philosophy and the historical Germanicpast, in his booklet The Schutzstaffel as Anti-Bolshevik Battle Organization, Himmleractively denied that a true polytheistic religion had ever existed among the earlyNortherners: all that there was and is on this earth was created by God and animated by God. Foolish, malicious and brainless people have created the fable, the fairytale that our forefathers worshipped gods and trees. No, they were convinced, according to age-old knowledge and age-old teaching, of the Godly order of this whole earth, the entire plant- and animal-world. For all Himmler’s attempts to revive what he believed to have been the glory of ancientdays--his Round Table at Castle Wewelsburg, his black-clad Teutonic Knights with theirfeudal motto “Meine Ehre heißt Treue” (My Honour is Loyalty)--his beliefs about earlyGermanic religion were fundamentally as false and ridiculous as his belief in theWelteislehre (the teaching that all events in the cosmos stemmed from the endless strugglebetween the heat of the sun and the massive quantities of ice in space) as a valid scientifictheory. Wotan and his kindred cannot be blamed for either the ideology or the actions of theThird Reich: they were not so much as invited to take part in the “reawakening of theGerman folk”, not even by those Nazi leaders who were farthest gone in their own peculiarbrand of pseudo-“Germanic” mysticism! Nevertheless, the Nazi use of early Germanic imagery and their emphasis on all things“folkish” inevitably contaminated the general perception of the Germanic deities after thewar. Wotan, Thórr, Freyja, and the rest. They fell under the same shadow as the swastika,the runes, and those folk traditions which the Nazis encouraged--a shadow which is onlynow beginning to fade slightly, and in some cases to grow darker, as with the runicalphabet, which it is now technically illegal to display openly in Germany. I first realizedthe extent and longevity of this shadow at the age of sixteen, as an exchange student in1983, when I asked a fellow student who was studying to be a professional dancer if sheknew any German folk dances. She immediately replied, “Oh, no, that is Nazi stuff.” Somenine years later, when Stephan Grundy’s novel Rhinegold (which retells the saga of theVölsungs) was published in Germany, he was told several times that “A German couldnever have written this book and gotten it published in Germany--it’s all right for anAmerican to have done it, because you are not tainted by the memory of Nazism”. Thename Wotan, in particular, is often singled out: in the German translation of Grundy’snovel Attila’s Treasure, when the alternate title Wotan’s Curse was suggested, it was madeclear that the Scandinavian form “Odin” would be acceptable in a book title, but not theGerman “Wotan”, specifically because it might awaken memories of the Third Reich.Wagner’s works are tolerated because they are, after all (and in spite of their misuse in theNazi era), a major contribution to world culture; new works in the same general field are amuch touchier matter. Even in the academic community, research into early Germanicreligious beliefs has often seemed to carry a certain stigma, which has only lifted in recentyears. Jung’s sharp observations in his essay “After the Catastrophe”, though somewhatblunted by time, German achievement, and the melding together of a greater Europe, have"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"107not entirely lost their sting--least of all within the German conscience. If a German intends to live on good terms with Europe, he must be conscious that in the eyes of Europeans he is a guilty man . . . The German can hardly expect other Europeans to resort to such niceties as to inquire at every step whether the criminal’s name was Müller or Meier . . . If a German is prepared to acknowledge his moral inferiority or collective guilt before the whole world, without attempting to minimize it or explain it away with flimsy arguments, then he will stand a reasonable chance, after a time, of being taken for a more or less decent man, and will thus be absolved of his collective guilt, at any rate in the eyes of individuals. This is, more or less, the course taken by most modern Germans: because of the corruptuses made of the Germanic heritage during the Nazi era, everything associated with thatheritage is now, to a large degree, shied away from as a sign of “moral inferiority orcollective guilt”. And what Jung says about the Germans here holds doubly true for theGermanic gods: though Hitler condemned the neo-Pagans and Himmler’s mysticism had noplace for Wotan, Thor, or Freyja, there are few people who bother to enquire as to whetherHimmler’s deity went by the name “Wotan” or “Got”. In the popular mind, it is image, notsubstance, which survives, with the result that Wotan, once reviled together with hisworshippers by the leaders of the Nazi party, is now seen by many as a god chieflyassociated with the worst elements of German nationalism. With this blight--undeserved as it may have been--upon the religion of the North, itsnext development in the modern age is all the more surprising. Wotan is worshipped today:offerings of beer, wine, and mead are poured out to him. Indeed, there are a number ofsane, rational people, with jobs, houses, and families to look after, who call on Wotanregularly and will swear that he has helped them--that they have personally felt hispresence, perhaps even seen him in a dream or vision. The religion of the North has, in fact,come back alive and well after its long silence. The number of folk who follow it is small,but includes a surprising selection. At least two major figures of the revival hold doctoratesin Germanic culture; other professions include medical doctors and professional computerprogrammers. As an example of the general diversity: the nine-person administrativecouncil of the Ring of Troth in 1996 was made up of a lawyer, a librarian, two full-timeprofessional novelists, a legal secretary, a union representative, a pensioner, a doctoralresearcher, and an ex-cop--and this varied body conducted the vast majority of itsorganizational business over e-mail. The history of the revived religion has not been particularly smooth. In the early 1970’s,the Icelander Sveinbjörn Beinteinssen (recently deceased) and the American StephenMcNallen independently and almost simultaneously founded organizations for the purposeof furthering the religion of “Ásatrú”--of those who are “true to the gods”. Ásatrú wasrecognised as an official religion in Iceland with relatively little trouble, and continues to bepracticed there today. McNallen’s organization, the Ásatrú Free Assembly, was morefraught with strife and frequently bedevilled by racists and other forms of extremists. Itdissolved in 1987, to be replaced at the close of that year by a group called the Ring ofTroth; another organization, the Ásatrú Alliance, also formed out of the shatters ofMcNallen’s group. Both are currently still in existence. The Ring of Troth is considerablylarger and more active; in fact, it is the largest official Ásatrú organization in existence(numbering around three hundred and fifty members, including quite a few in Canada, theUnited Kingdom, and Australia, as well as some scattered through the rest of NorthernEurope). In addition to a quarterly journal, the Ring of Troth has published its own massive(711 pp.) handbook, Our Troth, and has a clergy training handbook in the works. It has alsolately added both a general newsletter and one which deals specifically with clergy issues--recent subjects of discussion in this newsletter have included pre-marital counselling andthe theological problem of reconciling agricultural feasts and symbolism with apredominantly non-agricultural lifestyle. Perhaps in response to the problems which dogged the Ásatrú Free Assembly, the Ringof Troth states outright in their official material that racism, sexism, and homophobia arenot permitted within their organization--an attitude which is supported in their practice (for"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"108instance, four of the nine members of the administrative council in 1996 were women) andtheir published materials. Our Troth includes a lengthy conceptual analysis demonstrating,with extensive literary and historical references, that the idea of “race” as it exists in thetwentieth century was not a familiar concept to the Northern people, and that racism, theideologies of racial purity and racial superiority, etc., have no place within the practice ofthe religion. The Troth’s journal, Idunna, has several times printed articles by the openlygay Godman (certified Troth priest) William Karpen, discussing the ritual use of cross-dressing and the possibility that homosexuality may have held a special place in thepractice of early Scandinavian religion. The records of the smaller organizations have, byand large, not shown them to be so tolerant, which, according to many Troth members, isone of the things attracting people to the Ring of Troth in particular. It is interesting to note that Wotan, in particular, seems to be a dominant influence in theprocess of the revival. The early days of Ásatrú in America were coloured by StephenMcNallen’s rhetorical declarations that Wotan was also the god of science and technology,his spirit guiding the spaceships of today as it guided the longships of yesteryear. The term“Odinism” was synonymous with “Ásatrú”, as seen, for instance, with the small groupscalled the “Odinic Rite” (England) and the “Odinist Fellowship” (America); one of theearliest, self-published efforts at presenting a revived Norse theology was entitled TheReligion of Odin. It was not until the early 1990’s that “Odinism” and “Odinist” as generaldescriptions of the Northern religion began to lose popularity, perhaps because the religionas a whole was reaching a wider range of people who were correspondingly interested in awider range of deities (ironically, the persons whose writings were, in large part,responsible for this extended awareness--Edred Thorsson, Freya Aswynn, and myself--areall dedicated worshippers of Wotan). The founder of the Ring of Troth, Dr. Stephen Edred Flowers (better known to his fellowworshippers as Edred Thorsson, author of several books on runic magic and Germanicreligion), makes it clear in his writings that he considers Wotan to be the most important ofthe gods. WISDOM is watched over by Woden. This is the hidden lore and powers welling up from the darkest depths of our souls and hovering high over our heads, shining beyond the clouds, and leading us on into the unknown. This is the mysterious force that has the ability to hold all things together, ruled by those who can see and understand the whole. Above all, wisdom must be preserved, for in it are the wells of all memory; if it and only it survives, all other parts of the whole may be regenerated. From this is derived our sense of adventure, our curiosity about the unknown, our seeking and questing character. Indeed, a disproportionate number of the chief figures in the revival of the Northernreligion identify themselves as followers of Wotan. Among the most notable of these arethe leader of the revival in Britain and Holland, Freya Aswynn (author of Leaves ofYggdrasil); Kveldulf Gundarsson, Warder of the Lore of the Ring of Troth (in charge of theclergy training programme, and responsible for writing a great deal of the Troth’s publishedmaterials; author of Teutonic Magic and Teutonic Religion, and editor of Our Troth);renowned novelist Diana Paxson (among other works, she has written the Westria series;The White Raven; and, most recently, the “Wotan’s Children” trilogy--The Wolf and theRaven, Dragons of the Rhine, and Lord of Horses--based on the story of the Völsungs andNibelungs); and several others such as Garman Lord, self-declared (and recently crownedby his group in an elaborate ceremony) King of the Theodish Rice (an Anglo-Saxon wordmeaning “realm”, pronounced ree-chuh). In response to my question, “Do you think thatWotan has played more of a role in the revival of the Germanic religion than other gods?”Garman, who has worshipped Wotan (or, in his Anglo-Saxon idiom, Woden) since late1976, observes, To my own mind, and in my own experience, Woden has purposely taken it upon himself to be the trailblazer and stalking horse for the contemporary revival. He was the inspiration of most of the early pioneers, and in the old days of the revival"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"109 you hardly ever heard any other god’s name much seriously mentioned except perhaps Thor, who was often almost a comic-book god to many. We started out as a Woden cult, and then after seventeen years he was done with us, and turned us over to Ing Frea (Frey). I believe that he often recruits followers for other gods, and that he is the reason why we have been brought into contact with so many other gods lately. This appears to be a frequently-held belief among followers of Wotan; a similar opinionwas expressed by Freya Aswynn and by Diana Paxson. In this respect, I have several timesheard Paxson compare Wotan to Eshu, the orisha (Afro-Caribbean deity) who is usuallycalled on first in santeria ceremonies because it is his responsibility to open the way for theother gods. She also observes that, even in the rather distorted histories of SaxoGrammaticus, one of Wotan’s notable characteristics is that he insists that worship be paidto all the deities, rather than seeking it chiefly for himself. Another follower of the god,William West, suggests that perhaps the god’s early influence as the significant player helping to move the religion from near-forgotten obscurity to the active and growing status that it holds today . . . speaks to Woden’s ability to reawaken a sense of wonder in the minds of men, or to his gift of intellect and reason to mankind, thereby sparking the first flames of the reawakening in the minds of the inspired . . . heavily influencing the early revival through runecraft and wonder. Those who worship Wotan generally tend to view him as a being independent ofhumankind, though they perceive his nature in different ways. In her novel Brisingamen,Diana Paxson makes the interesting observation that the way in which a deity manifestshim- or herself may often be directly shaped by the way in which she or he is called: onescene has Freyja beginning to manifest as the Lady of the Woodland, when the maninvoking her forces her to change her appearance by calling upon her as Lady of Love.Humans, according to this point of view, assist in shaping their gods: the process ofreligious evolution is a mutual one. In contrast, Garman Lord expresses the opinion that notonly is Wotan independent of humanity, but, “So far, I can no more figure out exactly whatkind of beings the gods really are than the family dog can conceive of exactly what ilk hisowners really are.” Garman’s attitude is not common in Ásatrú as a whole, nor is it shared by most ofWotan’s worshippers. The image of the god as an ultimate forefather (as, for instance,according to the Anglo-Saxon and some Scandinavian royal genealogies) and occasionallyharsh, but essentially caring, teacher is brought up far more often; one memorablecomparison I have heard likens him to a crafty old grandfather who gives his ten year-oldgrandson a cigar to smoke, then laughs and says, “I told you so” when the boy makeshimself sick with it. As for the general relationship between humans and gods, Icommented in Our Troth on what seems to be the most common conception, To us, the god/esses are our eldest kinfolk, to whom we give the greatest love and respect . . . Most folk of the Troth . . . know the god/esses as real and mighty beings, as free-standing and individually aware as we are (or more so!) . . . They are mightier than we are (though not omnipotent), wiser than we are (though not omniscient), and probably more complex of character than we are. Although they are greater than we, however, there is no doubt that we are (or can be, if we are honourable and strong), worthy of them, in much the same way as children can be worthy of great parents and grandparents . . . Thus the worship we give our god/esses is not a matter of moaning about their highness and our lowness, but literally “worth-ship”: we honour them for what they are and have given us, and seek to bring forth that in ourselves which mirrors them. (Our Troth. KveldúlfR Gundarsson, ed. Seattle: Ring of Troth, 1994, p. 56). Stephen Flowers takes this philosophy of potential equality between humans and godseven farther, with what he calls the “Odian” path, an interesting combination of Gnostic"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"110and Germanic elements. According to his terminology, an “Odinist” is someone whoworships Wotan as a god; an “Odian” is one who seeks to become as much like the god, innature, power, and wisdom, as possible. His view represents an extreme in modern Nordicreligious philosophy, though one which is not entirely outside the general stream ofthought, nor does it seem to be entirely alien to the cult of Wotan, in which the god and hisheroes often seem to overlap in curious ways. The modern worshippers of Wotan, though well aware of his darker and grimmeraspects, generally seem to have little problem with them. Regarding the question ofwhether he betrays his heroes, Garman Lord comments, It always makes me feel somewhat rueful to see and hear the scornful ways in which Woden is so often referred to as a troth breaker. I would just like to say that he has always been faultlessly honourable and kind and a good friend to me, even at times when he has gotten me in trouble. I don’t buy into the troth breaker dialectic, and suspect that any kind of man can call himself a Woden-worshipper if he wants to, and there are some Woden worshippers who doubtless get the Woden they deserve. Freya Aswynn offers a different, and perhaps more traditional, view--certainly onestrongly coloured by the accounts of Wotan in Icelandic literature. She recognises thatWotan is a god of death, and that by wearing his sign, the interlocked triple triangle knownas the valknut, she is courting her own doom--but she considers it worthwhile: “How couldOdin possibly betray me? I’ve already given myself to him; I’m marked with the valknut,so that he can take me whenever he wants. Of course he’ll take me, but my life is so little inreturn for all that he’s given me. That’s not betrayal, that’s fair exchange. He gets me, but Iget him as well, and that’s all I’ve ever wanted--to be with him, to actually be a part of him.He’s such a lovely god!” In a later e-mail interview, Freya adds, “It is my hope that at theend of this life He will cloak me in His radiant being and take me unto Himself.” A similar, if somewhat more cautionary, perspective is taken by William West, whonotes that, “the path of Woden is not for everyone. While one is blessed with great giftsfrom the god, it is also true that there are dark aspects to his character, and some ofWoden’s gifts come only with great personal sacrifice.” West cites a violent altercationwith his brother as typical of the Norse observation (not uncommon in both sagas andEddic poetry) that Wotan often turns kinsman against kinsman. He also mentions receivingWoden’s mark only slightly thereafter, under rather unusual circumstances, I worked, at the time, for a school for “at risk” teens. My job was to provide mentalhealth team support to the teaching staff. Essentially what this means is that when astudent became frustrated and angry in the classroom, it was my job to deal with theexplosive behavior. Oftentimes this included physical restraint and there were timeswhen the job was extremely stressful. However, I never felt myself to be in any realdanger despite the daily threats that come with working with this population. On one occasion, though, correlating almost exactly with my entry into the Troth’s early clergy training program, I had been trailing a rather gentle-natured, extremely likeable young man whom I had never considered any sort of a physical threat to anyoneI had worked with . . . The student had left the classroom and I had followed him, attempting to talk with him and encourage him to go back to class . . . I followed the student into the large tin building we had converted to a gym. I confronted him verballyat a distance of approximately 30 feet about his contradictory ideas and behaviors andmade the very distressing mistake of turning my back to him. When I turned around Isaw the enraged student for only a rushed fraction of a second, then it hit me. Somethinghad struck me directly in the left eye with enough force to knock me to the ground . . . Apparently the student had picked up a piece of brass left on the ground after a repairhad been started and not finished to the lock/knob assembly on the gym’s door. He had thrown this piece of brass at me with considerable force. An ambulance was called and as I awaited my ride to the hospital it occurred to me that this had been a visitation from the god that I had dedicated myself to. It seems to me"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"111that the angry teen had acted as a vehicle for Woden and he had come to mark his own. Vision in the injured eye was slow in returning. For several months the pupil in theeye was frozen in a contracted position so that night vision was near impossible throughthe eye and a strange visual effect haunted me after twilight where one eye would focusand the other remained dark. The vision did return to normal but there are times,especially when I am tired, when the pupil gives me trouble. It usually returns to normalafter I’ve slept. So the question as to whether it is worthwhile for modern Westerners to worship Woden is a difficult one. I think that it is certainly worthwhile for those that choose in aninformed manner to answer Woden’s calling, as the path is blessed with the gold of wisdom gained from following the trail of the great wanderer. But this wisdom is not always pleasing and is often terribly challenging. A stable and secure life is not always easily maintained by the Wodenist, as I have come to find out. If one chooses to answer Woden’s calling, let him first be prepared for all that it entails. Gift does, after all,demand gift.(William West, e-mail interview, Dec. 12, 1995). By and large, Wotan’s character as a god of battle is less apparent in the practices of hisworshippers than is his character as a god of magic, wisdom, and poetry. It is notuncommon for followers of Wotan to practice some form of martial art or mediaeval-stylefighting (I, for instance, hold a black belt in Shotokan karate, and another Wotanistformerly on the Troth’s High Rede has a black belt in kendo), but neither does it seem to berequired, and many Wotanists have little or no interest in physical combat; nor does thereseem to be a particular preponderance of Wotan’s followers among the Ásatrú members ofthe armed forces. In contrast, the most outspoken worshippers of Wotan in the modern eraare, to a man (and woman), all practitioners of runic magic, and several of them alsoparticipate in prophetic trance-work (spae-craft). According to Freya Aswynn, It’s a question of what is needed . . . Odin does what is needed. These days, the battles are on a different plane of being. If I stuck my spear into an enemy on the street, they’d lock me up. Instead we battle with words and with magic, because those are the forces that have real power now. Those are the forces that really affect people. Odin is the god of communication, he adjusts to the times--he’s the god of the Internet! ... Sure, there are still plenty of battles, and he still takes his pick of the slain. But what he needs his worshippers for now is a very different war: the war to reclaim what we’ve lost, and transform Western culture. Odin doesn’t need Siegfried’s big muscles and thick head today, he needs the clever little buggers who can tell people about him and make them listen. There also seems to be a clear-cut relationship between both Wotan and writing and Wotanand academic work. All the major published works on the modern practice of the Germanicreligion and magic have been written by Wotanists; Diana Paxson I are full-timeprofessional writers; while Edred Thorsson and I both hold doctorates in Germanic studies. The two priestesses Freya Aswynn and Diana Paxson, in particular, are living disproof ofthe idea that the worship of Wotan is a matter chiefly for macho men whirling twelve-pound swords about their heads. Both women are enthusiastic dedicants of the god--thoughFreya Aswynn’s dedication is exclusive, while Paxson works closely with many membersof the Germanic pantheon, including Wotan’s wife Frigg, a goddess who seems particularlyfitting to Paxson’s calm nature and motherly demeanor. The two are a fascinating study ofopposites. Aswynn, a native Dutchwoman, is tall, almost skeletally thin (though with asurprising strength in her wiry limbs), with a long tail of tarnished golden hair falling downher back like the plait of a horn-bearing woman from the Viking Age picture stones. Hervoice is a strong mezzo-soprano, its cigarette-roughened rasp lending her words an edge ofpower and urgency, like the words of a prophetess whispered straining through the smokeof her holy fire. Freya Aswynn’s mood is mercurial--a description she would leap on withglee, “Mercurius” being the standard Latin translation of “Wotan”--and her manner utterly"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"112unrestrained. Though in her forties, she has the unlined face and slim, lanky body of ateenager; the impression of youth is heightened by the expression of absolute delight anddevotion that comes over her when she speaks about her god. Occasionally, whenoverwhelmed by enthusiasm, Freya Aswynn will let out the ear-splitting shriek of“OOOOODIIIINNN!” which is apparently her trademark--a habit which, now and again,leads to ejection from public places. Her intensity often unsettles those who do not shareher dedication: most modern Westerners find it difficult to know how to react when theirhostess grasps the rune-carved shaft of a spear and, shaking it aloft, declares that her life islived only for Wotan’s sake and that she is ready for the god to take her whenever hechooses. In spite of appearances, however, the shrieking valkyrie is also a practical Dutchhousewife: she has successfully managed a housing cooperative for many years, and whenvisiting as a house-guest for any length of time, leaves the home that has offered herhospitality tidier and better-scrubbed than it has ever been. Not only is Aswynn’s relationship with Wotan intense, it is unique, a surprising rebirthof an element of religion belonging to the eldest days. Her love for her god was rituallymarked in its fullness on November 9, 1993, through a rite based on a combination of sagicand historical references describing priestesses or priests as married to the deities theyserved and the theories of noted Dutch scholar Jan de Vries about the sacrificial origins ofcertain Danish customs and beliefs surrounding the Last Sheaf (the cutting of which marksthe end of the harvest and is marked by a diversity of folk practices and superstitionsthroughout Europe). The rite itself was largely conducted as a recreation of a Germanicwedding, including the presence of a Kinsman on Wotan’s side and a Kinswoman onFreyja’s, recounting the gifts that each brought to the wedding; the god himself wasembodied for the wedding by a Wotan-priest in a state of ecstatic trance. The essence of theritual beyond the social forms of the wedding was spoken by the Kinswoman and presidinggoði (priest): Kinswoman: I weep because my kinswoman must wed with the Old One--my fair sister Freya must be bound with the Last Sheaf, reaped with  Ygg’s barley and hung to waver in the winter storm. So Earth sighs at her daughter’s loss, though she herself has known the love of the wind-raging god who rides above her bare fields and scatters the seeds from the sheaf.  Goði: Ørlög (fate) has been laid and wyrd been turned: the gift goes willingly. With her own hands the Old One’s bride braided her hair into the dry stalks of grain; with her own hands she bears the Sheaf here--bridegroom and bride, gift and giver and god in one. None shall hinder Hárr’s harvest; Galdr-Father gets his share of all that is felled, and sweeps up what is sworn to him. Now let your oaths be sworn upon the hallowed Sheaf, before the holy harrow: Wodan and Freya, speak your troth!  (unpublished ritual, written by Kveldulf Gundarsson). Freya Aswynn wears Wotan’s wedding ring and considers herself sworn to him alone, ashis chaste priestess and his valkyrie. Like Brünnhilde in the Ring cycle, she can say to thegod, “Who am I, if I am not your will?” (Walküre, Act I, scene ii) --this is her sole reasonand motivation for existing, a dedication worthy of the heroes and heroines of the oldestNorse poetry. She is a remarkable woman. Diana Paxson--likewise remarkable in her own way, but not nearly so startling on firstimpression--is an American in her fifties. Of middle height, built in a solid German fashion,with curly dark hair and bright blue eyes, Paxson could easily be a housewife from theBlack Forest or Bavaria. Her behavior is perfectly proper in all settings, from taking teawith elegant and venerable English academics to hosting the riotous party held every NewYear at her home and writers’ sanctuary, Greyhaven. When dressed for public appearance,in her neat dark blue suit and sensible shoes, Diana Paxson resembles nothing so much as amaternal Lutheran minister or Episcopalian priest, exuding a calm built up over many years"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"113of raising a family and keeping a household of temperamental artists running smoothly. Hertremendous creativity (in addition to being a successful professional novelist, Paxson wasone of the founders of the Society for Creative Anachronism, and has since founded severalneo-Pagan religious organizations; she has also contributed a great deal to the Ring ofTroth’s clergy training programme and current organization, and, in addition to herinternational prominence, is the chief representative of the Northern tradition in the SanFrancisco/Northern California area) is not apparent on the surface. It is not until one speakswith her that one realizes the extent of her considerable intellect and deep understanding ofthe subjects with which she deals. Although Diana Paxson considers herself chiefly dedicated to Wotan, her maincontribution to the revival of the Northern religion has been her tremendous efforts towardsrediscovering the techniques of trance by which Scandinavian seeresses were able to utterthe prophesies of which even Wotan stood in awe. As described in the saga of Eiríkr theRed, Diana has a special high seat to sit in; members of her group Hrafnar (the Ravens)sing trance-inducing songs consisting of modern words set to traditional Norwegian folkmelodies, such as the haunting “Summoning Song” (words by Tom Jonsson and WilliamKarpen) with its hypnotic refrain: Make plain the path to where we are, A horn calls clear from o’er the mountain, The gods to gladden from afar. And mist rises on the meadow. The gods to gladden us below, A horn calls clear from o’er the mountain . . . Paxson’s techniques have been adopted by many other groups, including Freya Aswynn’s,but the high level of performance quality which Hrafnar has reached is seldom, if ever,matched: to attend one of their prophetic sessions, with the seers and attendants in fullNorse dress, is truly to experience a timeless moment in which one feels that the oldwisdom and crafts of the Vikings have never died. With this as a background to the worship of Wotan today, it may fairly be asked: to whatdegree is his character as god of death recognised and/or incorporated into practice--do hisworshippers gaze up to Valhalla? The ages of the Wotanists I have discussed here currentlyrange from early thirties to mid-fifties (Diana Paxson); their standard of living is generallymiddle-class, and all of them appear to be in good health. Barring accident or unexpecteddisease, they can all easily expect from twenty or thirty to fifty or more years of life. It iseasy to offer one’s life in return for a god’s gifts, if death does not appear imminent: buthow does the religion of Wotan as it is practiced now actually deal with death? Is theancient understanding of the native Scandinavians a part--even a small part--of the modernworld in any sort of real sense or practice? Most of my own studies of Wotan and Germanic religion in general have focused on theunification of the dead and the living; my writings over the past few years also includeseveral memorial poems and essays, and Freya Aswynn affectionately calls me “the priestof death”. My funeral rituals in Our Troth and Teutonic Religion are based on a strongawareness of the value of traditional practices in responding to the death of a loved one. As far as the practical effectiveness of the worship of Wotan in dealing with death,however, it was Freya Aswynn, describing the death of her man Lionel Hornby, whopresents the most immediate and relevant view of the role Wotan can play today in dealingwith death and grief. As she tells it, Lionel had been sick for some time--his liver was packing up on him, and he had some other health problems. We were all afraid, me especially since I know something about medicine, that he was going to have three or four months dying painfully in hospital. ButOdin told us that he would only live one more harvest, maybe two if he looked after himself carefully and stopped drinking spirits; and Odin promised to take him peacefullywhen his time came. He was an old man, he had done a lot in his life, and he was ready"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"114to go on to the next thing. That was in August of 1993. In November, at my wedding with Odin--where Lionel stood as Odin’s Kinsman and gave me away, because he knew that this was what Ineeded and he wouldn’t live much longer Odin told Lionel to enjoy himself while hecould, because his wyrd was set. He seemed in good health and spirits. Then, at thebeginning of January, Lionel was sitting in his chair watching the telly. He was halfasleep, and he looked up at me, and he said, “Love, I think this is it.” Then the phonerang and I went to answer it. When I came back, he was still sitting there, peaceful andhappy. But he was dead. And he had one eye open, and one eye shut--Odin’s sign thathe had kept his promise to us. Odin is the god of death, but not just death in battle: hebrought Lionel a good and an easy death at home, just as Lionel wanted it to be. And, when it come to the end, dying right is the most important thing about life--isn’tit? (personal interview, June, 1994). Lionel’s ashes were sent across the causeway at Maldon on his flaming ship with the ritefrom Our Troth, Wodan, we call thee! From Walhall’s seat, send ravens winging their way. Well thou know’st pathways the worlds between - ferryman, fare to this shore! A burden waits for thy boat. Saddled the gray steed stands on the shore, readied for dead to ride, Wodan’s wish-daughters wait with bright drink, where heroes are gathered in hall, where swords are shining flames. Wodan, we call thee! Wrap thy dark cloak over thy son’s keen eyes. Carry him onward to kin in thy home, where benches are brightly strewn, where einherjar share the ale.(Our Troth, p. 536). In readying for Lionel’s death, in meeting it, in mourning him, and in holding the last ritesfor his remains: Wotan stood by the shore with open sail and bridled steed, to guide Lionelacross the waters to Walhall and to bring Freya and the rest of the household who mournedhim back to set their feet firmly on Midgard’s earth. As in earlier days, the old man at the edge of the wood still has his gift to offer: thewisdom of life and death and memory, as it was known by a traditional people for whomdeath was often but a heartbeat away, life a treasure to be prized--but not too greatly, for ifhoarded too long without worthwhile use it became worthless--and memory theshimmering bridge between the two, by which the dead might live again and the livingmight measure the worth of a good death. In closing, I will let myself sip of the old man’s mead: it is not, I think, a betrayal of theNorse poets who retold the legends of Continental heroes several hundred years lateraccording to their own understanding, if I slip into a fanciful dream of what might havebeen, of a matter that we will never know the certain truth of. If, as has been suggested,Thórgeirr truly spoke with the gods--if Wotan’s eye glimmered against the darknessbeneath his cloak, if he heard the whirring of Frigg’s spindle or the rustling of Freyja’sfalcon-cloak as he set his dilemma before them--time has shown how good their advice tohim was. Many of the poems of the Viking Age skalds were composed outside of Iceland;some of the Eddic poems may have been as well. But the vast bulk of what we know aboutthe religion of the North was written down and preserved in Iceland, where the Heathen"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"115past was not something to be eradicated and replaced with christian culture as soon aspossible, but rather a source of the greatest pride--partially, perhaps, because Iceland’s mostnotable export was her skalds, and skaldic poetry could not well exist without a closeknowledge of Scandinavian religion. Iceland’s antiquarians of the thirteenth and fourteenthcenturies did their best to save what could be remembered of the tales and poems of thegods, and it is because of this that we have a clearer picture of the Norse religion than wehave of any other European faith. Perhaps Thórgeirr gazed into the dark depths of the Wellof Wyrd, where the religions of the continental Germans and the Anglo-Saxons had alreadybeen reduced to scattered shards; perhaps he saw there a golden hoard of poems and tales,that could bear to be sunken in the water for the sake of future generations who could bringthem up. It is certain that when Thórgeirr returned to his own home in the north of Iceland,he did not take an axe to the carven images through which the might of the gods dwelt withhim. Instead he bore them carefully to a mighty, glacier-fed waterfall above a deep lake,and there he cast them over--to sink like the treasure of the Rhine, perhaps to rise again.Those falls are called ‘Goðafoss” even today--“Waterfall of the Gods”. If Wotan had wrapped Thórgeirr in his own cloak, carrying the Lawspeaker on Sleipnir’sback to the roots of the World-Tree even as his body lay still beneath the shroud of earthlycloth--if Thórgeirr had dismounted at the foot of Yggdrasill’s great trunk where the Well ofWyrd stands, if he had looked into those endlessly deep waters, down to the glinting star ofWotan’s lost eye--what might he have seen shadowed forth by the Norns? First, Wyrd, the eldest: the sound of axe-blows rising from the water, drowning out theweeping of widows; the sight of a great and hallowed pillar, the Irminsul of the Saxons,toppling and breaking, and a bloodied cross raised in its place. The whispering of kings, aflash of parchment with Latin letters on it--the advantages of conversion, to English kingswho wished to ally their lines with the power of the Frankish kingdoms, the administrativeefficiency of Rome. Nothing has changed: on the one hand, treaties and favour; on theother, brutally violent sacrilege, to be done by outsiders for those who refuse to do it forthemselves. Second, Verðandi: more frightful images these, beneath the towering mountain crags ofNorway. The king Óláfr Tryggvason--a tall man, well-built and fair to look on, with longflowing hair--sits quietly watching his captive, one Eyvindr kinnrifi. Eyvindr is tied on hisback: a brass brazier stands on his naked belly. It is beginning to glow from the coalswithin, its round foot scorching Eyvindr’s flesh black. Still he will not convert, not forfreedom and the king’s favour, nor to save himself pain. His charred skin splits open first:his guts tumble out like a tangle of sausages. Another man, large and heavy-built, known bythe name Rauðr the Strong, stands before Óláfr. He, too, is restrained--it takes several menand a great weight of iron. One end of a metal horn is forced halfway down his throat; theking signals, and an adder is poured slithering into the horn. It will not go all the waythrough to the flesh at the other opening of the tube, so the outer end is heated until it does.Óláfr’s reign will not outlast the year--so Verðandi knows--but he is the first, not the last, ofthe tyrant-convertors of Norway. Thus matters stand: now Skuld, the youngest Norn, casts her shadows above the othertwo. Thórgeirr sees a man in late middle age sitting with a quill-pen in hand, writing--pulling at his silvering hair, perhaps, as he struggles to make some sense of thecontradictory jumble of poems and tales, words and songs, which he knows to be thefoundation of his beloved art of skaldcraft. Trying to fit all these things into a coherentmythology, his vision dimmed a little further by his Classical models and christianupbringing, he undoubtedly makes some errors: nevertheless, he is able to set down andexplain a vast number of things that otherwise would have been forgotten. His name isSnorri Sturluson, and he is a man of many crafts: literary man, historian, active politician,and antiquarian whose love for the old days comes through clearly in his work: even hisbooth at the Thing is called ‘Valhöll’. Snorri is followed by a parade of other figures. They move as vague shadows throughthe Well’s waters, their names long forgotten--but the calf-bound manuscripts in theirhands glimmer gold, the red initial letters gleaming from the pages like garnets in thefirelight. One of these will someday bear the name Codex Regius, another Hauksbók: butmore important are the names of the poems within their pages: Völuspá, Grímnismál,"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"116Vafþrúðnismál, and all the other ‘Eddic lays” that recount the doings of the gods andheroes, songs which Snorri had only time and space to quote a few scattered verses from.Other manuscripts are named after men or peoples: Egils saga Skalla-Grímssonar; Eiríkssaga rauða, Völsunga saga--the saga of Egill Skalla-Grímsson, the saga of Eiríkr the Red,the saga of the Völsungs. In these stories, too, memories of the gods glow like banked coalsunder ash. And one of these glowing manuscripts, whose pages strain to hold torrents of red goldand the ancient writhings of a dragon within (Thórgeirr might have seen as he sat gazinginto the far-cast shadows of Wyrd, the scratching of his heavy woollen clothes and the littleitchy bites of fleas and lice long-forgotten), catches a gust of wind, flaring up into a ring offire around a mountaintop where an armour-clad maiden sleeps, where Wotan’s single eyeflares again from beneath his broad-brimmed hat as he strikes his spear on the ground andcries out in a voice that sends a cold ripple of well-water up the spine, Wer meines Speeres Spitze furchtet--durchschreitet das Feuer nie! Who fears the point of my spear--shall never tread through the fire! That might have been enough for Thórgeirr: both a promise and an answer to him. But ifhe gazed longer, he would see more. In the land across the sea, the land that BjarniHerjólfsson sighted, but did not land on, a small group gathers in a grove of trees biggerthan any Iceland has yet sprouted, ringing themselves around a large boulder of redsandstone which is carven with the shapes of intertwined wyrms with runes inscribedwithin their ribbon-bodies. Their clothes are half-familiar, half-strange, a mixture of stylesfrom Northern and Saxon and Eastern lands; yet it is a rich gathering, for many of them arearmed with swords as well as axes and spears, and several of the women are adorned withrope upon rope of amber that glows gold in the early morning Sun. It is a man who stepsbefore the harrow-stone--a short, broad-shouldered man, with long flaxen hair and a close-cropped reddish beard. Taking a horn of mead in his hand, he raises it and speaks wordswhich are well-known to Thórgeirr: the words spoken by the valkyrie Sigrdrífa as sheawakens from her long sleep. Hail, Day! Hail, ye Day’s sons! Hail, Night and her daughter! Look down upon us here with loving eyes, and give victory to those sitting here! Hail the gods! Hail the goddesses! Hail to need-giving Earth! Goodly speech and human wit may you grant to we, the mighty, and hands of healing, while we live. Then, having watched Skuld shadow almost a thousand years of what should become,Thórgeirr might hear the mocking words of the seeress of Völuspá--“Would you knowmore, or what?” And he might take the cloak from his head, blinking against the mistysummer brightness; and, knowing that he was not destroying, but saving, make his way upto the Law-Rock above the plain of tents and the bustling of folk in their best and brightestclothing, there to speak the decision that would lay down the first layers upon whichSkuld’s foreshadowing could be built. Though the signposts along the road to Valhallawould be hidden for a time, they would not be destroyed: one day Wotan’s spear wouldpoint the path to the shimmering bridge again--to the heroes’ holy hall.

KveldúlfR Gundarsson)Ynglingatal is one of our older skaldic poems, attributed to the ninth century skald Þjóðólfrór Hvíni. It recounts the deaths and burial places of the Ynglings, traditionally consideredto be the royal line of Sweden, descended from Ingvi-Freyr. 1. The word of the doomed, that came to Fjölnir, was fore-gone where Fróði dwelt; thewindless sea of Svigðir’s spears (ale) should overcome the prince.2. Yet the day-cloud hall-watcher of Dúrnir’s descendents deceived Sveigðir, that the proudkinsman of Dusli ran after the dwarf into the stone, and the bright, jötunn-settled hall ofSökmímir and his folk opened for the ruler-boar.3. And the witchly wight caused Vanlandi to visit Vilji’s brother (Óðinn?), that the troll-born Grímhildr should tread the foe of the host of men; and so burned the gift-mild who thenightmare had tormented on the bank of Skúta.4. And the descendant of the sea (fire) was able to swallow Vísburr’s will-fortress (breast),when the desirers of the kingdom incited the forest’s harm-thief (fire) against their father,and the glow’s baying hound bit the all-ruler in the eagle-ship.5. That was in early days, when the sword-bearers reddened the earth with their drighten,"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"118and the land-army bore bloodied weapons from Domaldi’s body, when the harvest-greedySwede-clan should sacrifice the foe of Jóti.6. And I have often asked wise men about Yngvi’s corpse, where Dómarr was borne ontothe roaring bane of Hóalfr; now I know that the sickness-dead descendant of Fjölnir wasburned beside the Fyris.7. I tell no deception, that Glitnir’s Gná (Hel) had Dyggvi’s corpse for joy, for the horse-dísof the Wolf and Narfi should choose the king-man; and Loki’s maid had the all-ruler ofYngvi’s folk to play with.8. I have heard that Dagr, eager after fame, should travel according to death-word, when thewise one of the slain-twig (warrior) came to Vörvi to avenge his sparrow.9. And the host of the prince bore that word on the eastern ways from battle, that the rulershould be overcome by Sleipnir’s hay-thief.10. That wonder tell I, if Agni’s armi had thought Skjalf’s actions natural, when Logi’s dísheaved the ruler aloft with the gold necklace, he who should tame the cool horse of Signý’sman (the gallows) by the Taur.11. Alrekr fell there where a brother’s weapon became Eiríkr’s bane, and it is said thatDagr’s kinsmen slew each other with steed’s bridles; none had heard of it before, thatFreyr’s offspring had used a bridle in war.12. And he who slew Alfr, the warder of the véstallr, lay slain, when the jealous rulerreddened a sword in Yngvi’s blood.13. That was not to be told, that Bera should whet the slayers to battle, when the twobrothers unnecessarily became each others’s bane out of jealousy.14. Jörundr, who died a long time ago, was bereft of his life in Limafirð, when the high-breasted linen-rope Sleipnir (gallows) should bear Goðlaugr’s bane; and Hagbarðr’s stringwent around the throat of the army’s lord.15. In former times, old age overtook Aun at Uppsala, and the life-desiring should receive ababe’s nourishment for another time.16. And he brought a horn’s point to his mouth, when the destroyer of his ætt drank, lyingdown, from an ox’s horn; the hoary-haired eastern king could not hold the horn up.17. And the clan-fellow of Týr fled the kingdom before Tunni’s might, but the ox reddenedits head-sword in Egill’s blood.18. Which earlier in the east had long-born its eyebrow-altar (or temple), but the woodlesssword of the gorer stood in the heart of the descendant of Skilfings.19. Óttarr fell, mighty, under the claws of the eagle, before the weapons of the Danes, thebattle-goose trod him with bloody feet, borne from afar, at Vendel.20. I have heard it said that the works of Vátr and Fasti became a tale among the Swede-folk, that Fróði’s island-jarls had slain the battle-promoters.21. Yet I have heard that a witchly wight should take away Aðil’s life, and the death-greedykinsman of Freyr should fall from the horse’s back.22. And the ruler’s son’s brains became blended with gravel, and Ali’s death-blessed foe"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"119should die at Uppsala.23. I know that Eystein’s end followed, his closing of life, at Lófundr, and it was said thatJutlandish men burned the king inside among the Swedes.24. And the devouring sickness of the meadow-seaweed (fire) ran over the ruler in the fire’sship, where the timber-fast house, full of men, burned over the king.25. That was rumoured, that the folk of Sysla had sacrificed Yngvarr, the Estonian armyattacked the light-skinned king at the harbour’s heart (stone; the place name Steinn); andthe eastern sea sings Gymir’s song for the pleasure of the Swedish king.26. Önundr was beaten down with the harm of Jónakr’s children (stones) under Heaven-Fells, and the foe of the Estonians was pressed weightily; the bastard’s doom (stones) cameto hand, and so the promoter of Högni’s corpse was slain with stones.27. And Ingjaldr was trodden, living, by the overturner of rye (fire) at Ræning, when thehouse-thief stood against the god-kin with fire’s feet.28. And all the folk saw the fate of the most crucial among the Swedes, that he himselfshould be the first to bring the end of his brave life.29. And at the harbour, the elm-tree’s wolf (fire) swallowed the corpse of Óláfr, who hadploughed the wood, and Fornjót’s glowing son loosed the clothing of the ruler of theSwedes; so the kinsman of Lofði’s clan turned from Uppsala a long time ago.30. Everyone has heard that peaceable men should miss Halfdan, and the protection-Naumaof the stone-caster (Hel) took the folk-king at Þótinn; and Skereiðr sorrows over the bonesof the byrnie-alf in Skíring-Hall.31. But Eysteinn, before the mast, fared to the maid of Býleistr’s brother (Hel), and now theinviter of heroes lies under the sea’s bones at the end, where Vaðla’s ice-cold stream comesto the sea by the Gautish ruler.32. And Hveðrungr’s maid (Hel) bade the leader, third in the Thing, from the world whichHalfdanr, who dwelt in Holt, had enjoyed the life doomed for him by the Norns; and thevictory-having one buried his prince at Borre afterwards.33. The greatly laden Goðrøðr, who lived a long time ago, was met with treachery, and theperson who wished to be ruler used cunningness against the king when he was drunk.34. And the deceitful thrall of the Æsir bore a deceitful winner above the ruler, and theprince was stabbed at the ancient bank of Stíflusund.35. And the descendant-branch of Þrór’s strength had thrived greatly in Norway; Óláfrruled in elder days over Upsa’s wide land and Vestmar, together with Grenland’s folk, liketo the gods.36.

Note that Our Troth uses Old German nameforms: Wodan for Wotan, Frija for Frigg, Fro Ing for Yngvi-Freyr, Thonar for Thórr) As spoken of in the chapter on \"Soul, Death, and Rebirth\", the burial customs of ourforebears varied greatly. In Scandinavia, the common practice was to bury the dead inmounds; mounds were also raised over those who had been burnt, as was the case with thegreat howes at Gamla Uppsala, for instance. During the first few hundred years of theCommon Era, the Germanic tribes had largely lost this practice: the dead were both burntand buried (though burial was more common, and the only form used by some tribes, suchas the Burgundians). Among many tribes, the dwelling above the ground was replaced by awooden chamber below the ground; this was the case with the Alamanns, for instance, whobuilt quite elaborate chambers. The Franks commonly buried their dead in neat rows, notunlike the layout of most cemeteries today; they, too, sometimes built wooden burialchambers beneath the ground. While the Goths knew two words that seem to describemound burials - hlaiw (from the common Germanic word for a mound, which itself mayoriginally mean \"dwelling\") and aurahjom (\"heap of gravel\"), they had largely lost thispractice in the course of their migrations: Gothic graves are normally flat. Another form ofcemetery was the urnfield (Grundy, The Cult of Óðinn: God of Death?). Some Anglo-Saxon graves are marked by postholes or beam-slots at the corners of thegrave, suggesting that small huts or shrines were raised over the individual graves; othersare surrounded by penannular or ring-shaped ditches, some of which have preserved stake-holes that show that the grave was originally ringed by a fence. The gap in penannularfences was sometimes marked by a larger post-hole, which may have held something suchas one of the god-staffs with a head carved at the top which ibn Fadlan described for theRus on the Volga (Wilson, Anglo-Saxon Paganism, pp. 53-63). If a true wo/man's bodymust be buried in a secular (or even, gods help us, a christian) cemetery, the setting up ofsuch a covering structure, small ring of stakes, and/or god-post is one way in which thegrave could be set apart as hallowed. Another common form of burial among the Anglo-Saxons was the cremation/urn burial,"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"131and quite large urnfields have been found. The pottery containers were often decorated withholy emblems such as swastikas and Tiwaz-runes; pots from Lovedon Hill and Spong Hillbore runic inscriptions (Wilson, pp. 147-49). Wyrms and animal figures were notuncommon; one pot from Caistor-by-Norwich shows a large dog or wolf apparentlybarking at a retreating ship, and it has been suggested that this has something to do with theevents of Ragnarök, with the wolf being Fenrir and the ship being that steered by Loki. Burning and burial were both known in the Viking Age; because Snorri says in Ynglingasaga that Óðinn introduced the custom of burning, and given the reference in ibn Fadlan'saccount to the dead man's Lord sending the wind to fan the flames of his pyre and take himstraight away to \"Paradise\" (see \"Soul, Death, and Rebirth\"), it is usually taken thatcremation is more fitting for the followers of Wodan (and perhaps the other Ases as well),while burial, especially howe-burial, is more fitting to the Wans - Snorri specificallymentions that Freyr introduced the custom of mound-burial. The Icelandic sagas seldommention cremation otherwise; this likely stems from the simple fact that, even at the time ofthe settlement, the \"woods\" that covered Iceland were little scrub birches, and the amountof wood needed to burn a human body would have been prohibitive except in cases where adraugr was a major threat to the community. Given this range, it follows that the most common means of burial in the West today -flat inhumation and cremation - are both well-set within the traditions of the Troth. Theonly modern custom which is not particularly fitting is that of scattering ashes; this wasdone only when there was reason to think that the dead person would walk again (oftenbecause he had been walking and making trouble) - and even then it was not alwayssuccessful, as the story of Þórólfr Twist-Foot from Eyrbyggja saga shows. Cremation urnswere usually buried, or at least those which have survived have all been from burials. Thismeans of dealing with the dead offers the simplest way of carrying out the traditionalpractice of keeping the kin by the stead; it is unlikely that one will be allowed to bury abody in a mound in the backyard, but there is no difficulty, legal or otherwise, in heaping asmall howe over a cremation urn and grave-gifts. The setting of runestones or memorial picture-stones was deeply important to Northernbeliefs about the dead, as it was through these that the dead could be remembered forever.As Hávamál 72 says, \"Better to have a son, though he be born after the warrior is gone;memorial stones seldom stand by the road, unless raised by kinsman for kin.\" It was by nomeans definite that the stone had to be set on top of the burial as a grave-marker. Somerunestones, such as the Eggjum stone, were set within the mound, and apparently meant toaffect the dead or protect them from anyone who might break into the grave (but nothingstops an archæologist!). Others, such as the Swedish group commemorating the men who\"fell in the East with Ingvi\", memorialize folk whose bodies are far away. The Gotlandicpicture-stones are not generally found in association with actual graves, either; and theyseem to be not only memorials (and some of them bear runic inscriptions making it clearthat they are), but some of them also appear to describe the expected afterlife of the deadman. Runestones can be set upon the grave as markers, and if the body must be buriedamong other folk, this probably should be done. They can also be put up on your own landsor at public gathering places. In the old days, stringent curses were often carved into thestone against anyone who should break or disturb it, and (what with one thing and another)this is not a bad idea now. We would also advise against setting smaller or less firmly-rooted stones where vandals or thieves can get hold of them - odd as it may sound, peoplehave had small runestones stolen in the past few years. Limestone is probably the idealmedium for a runestone, being soft enough to carve with relative ease, but durable enoughto hold its images for a long time - most of the Gotlandic picture stones, for instance, arelimestone. A Troth Elder should be able to design a fitting runestone or picture-stone atneed. As far as the carving is concerned, anyone with moderate artistic skill and a littlepractice should be able to execute it. However, if there is some doubt, it should beremembered that there is a fairly strong body of evidence to the effect that the craftsmenwho actually did runic inscriptions (as on bracteates or runestones) were not necessarilyrunemasters themselves, which suggests that a mundane stonecarver can be hired ifnecessary. If you do this for a runic inscription, you do need to oversee the person carefully,as a lot of the staves look an awful lot alike to non-runesters. This is thought to be one"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"132explanation for the great number of surviving \"nonsense inscriptions\". The raising of therunestone, and whatever rites seem fitting to that, was usually done nine months to a yearafter the death. Likely the most common element in all Germanic burials - from the eldest days to theend of the Viking Age, from Scandinavia to Italy - was the setting of grave-goods. Thispractice (beginning at the dawn of humanity and common to many more peoples than ourown) was based on the belief that the dead still lived in some way, and would need not onlyfood and drink, but weapons, tools, and all those things they had enjoyed in their lifetimes.Grave-goods were given to both the burned and the buried; Snorri tells us (and we canprobably trust his account of the belief, though we may be dubious about what he says of itsorigins) that Óðinn decreed \"that everyone should come to Valhöll with the same wealththat he had on the bale-fire; and he should also enjoy that which he had hidden in the earthhimself\" (Ynglinga saga, ch. 8). Sometimes the goods themselves were cremated, andsometimes set in the grave with the urn after the body had been burnt. The description ofBeowulf's funeral has both: Beowulf's pyre is \"hung with helm, with battle-boards, withbright byrnies\" (lines 3139-40), and Wiglaf says earlier that the treasure must \"melt withthe brave-one...the fire shall eat it\" (3011-14); but when the cremated body is buried, it isalso told how \"they placed in the barrow arm-rings and jewels, all that treasure which thefierce men had earlier taken from the hoard (3163-65). Food and drink, especially apples and hazelnuts (filberts, to Americans), were veryusual, and perhaps the most meaningful of gifts (see \"Things and their Meanings\"). TheOseberg queen was sent off with a bucket and a chest full of wild apples, as well as grain,loaves, and meat. Food was still given to the mound-dead until modern times, although thislikely stems from the worship of the alfs rather than an awareness of dead humans needingfood (see \"Alfs\"). The dead were usually buried (or burnt) with those things which they had used in life,fully dressed in their best clothing. Usually they were laid on their backs; the Anglo-Saxonfolk buried face-downward are suspected to have been considered dangerous or disgracedin some way (Wilson, pp. 80-86). Women had their spinning and weaving implements, aswell as cooking utensils - the frowe of the Oseberg ship-burial had a fully equipped kitchen.Men had weapons and armour (some weapons have also been found in female graves);Egils saga Skalla-Grímssonar mentions the burial of smiths with their tools, which issupported by archæological finds. Both sexes were buried with jewelry, with fine goodssuch as glass cups or drinking horns; it was thought shameful for someone of good standingto be sent to the mound without some treasure. Animals, especially horses but also dogs,hawks, and farm animals, were very often laid in the mound with their owners. Some ofthese, such as pigs, sheep, and cattle, were probably meant for the dead to eat in theOtherworld; the horses, hounds, and hawks suggest that riding and hunting would be donein death as in life. One of the most definitely religious practices particularly associated with cremation/urnburial in the Viking Age was the setting of an iron ring with Þórr's Hammer pendants,miniature firesteels, and other such small iron emblems (one ring, from Torvalla, Sweden,has what appear to be a spear, hammer, and sickle, which may have been meant as emblemsof Óðinn, Þórr, and Freyr) on top of the urn. This was probably meant to ward the deadfrom all the dangers of the Otherworld. Hammers and minature fire-steel pendants of silverare also common, as are Hammers of amber; some of the latter sort from Gotland seem tohave been made for the sole purpose of burial, as they show no sign of wear (Roesdahl andWilson, From Viking to Crusader, p. 190). Small images of other sorts were also put incremation graves: one from Kungsängen (Sweden), ca. 800 C.E., held both a little bronzefigure of a man with a bird-horned helmet (often thought to have some connection with thecult of Wodan, as hinted at by the Torslunda matrices in which the bird-horned dancer isone-eyed) and another of a man in a wolfskin who is apparently biting a snake, which maypossibly refer to a scene from Völsunga saga. Such images were found in the graves of folkof both genders: a woman's grave from Birka, for instance, had a small mounted warrior,another horseman, a woman's image, and a miniature strike-a-light (Roesdahl and Wilson,p. 277). The Anglo-Saxon graves were also rich in amulets, including quartz crystals,amethyst, horses' teeth, and, for women, cowrie shells (Meaney, Anglo-Saxon Amulets and"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"133Curing Stones); quartz crystals in various polished and unpolished forms were commonamulets/grave-goods throughout the Germanic world, as were also sundry animals' teeth(especially boar-tusks) and claws (especially bear-claws), beads, and stones. The equipping of the dead person with the means of faring from one world to the nexthas been spoken of in \"Soul, Death, and Rebirth\". As well as boats, wains, and horses, thedead could also have \"Hel-shoes\" sewn onto their feet. These shoes, like the stone-mooredboats mentioned in the earlier chapter, served two purposes: they kept the dead shod on thefaring to the Otherworld, and also kept them from getting up and walking about in theMiddle-Garth. In modern times, if the dead cannot be buried in a full-size vehicle, a model of a ship,wain, or car might be laid in the grave or burnt for the dead person. Otherwise, the bodyshould be readied with a warm coat or cloak, warm and sturdy walking shoes or boots, andperhaps a staff: it is a long, cold, and wet way to the lands of the dead. In Norway, at the moment of death, a window or door was supposed to be opened; if thedeath-struggle was especially long, a hole might be made in the roof or someone mightclimb onto the roof to call the dying person out through chimney or smokehole(Christianssen, \"The Dead and the Living\", p. 19). It was sometimes thought dangerous tobring the body out through a window or a door, as the dead might remember the way backin (especially if they were the sort of folk who were likely to walk again, such as berserks,shape-shifters, magic-workers, and the generally obnoxious); Egill Skalla-Grímsson, whosefather was a berserk, had a hole broken in the wall of the house through which Skalla-Grímr's corpse could be carried out. In Denmark, houses were sometimes built with akeyhole-shaped \"corpse-door\" which was usually bricked up, and opened only for the sakeof bringing the dead out. Interestingly, many rune-stones and picture-stones are shaped likelarge keyholes, which may suggest that the memorial stone itself could have been seen asan embodiment of the doorway between life and death. It was also usual to keep an overnight watch by the body with candles burning. In olderdays, this called for some bravery, as if the corpse were going to walk again, this wasusually the time when it would sit up and perhaps even speak, as Þórsteinn Eiríksson doesin Eiriks saga ins rauða and as also occurs in Icelandic folktales. In the latter case, worsehappenings are prevented by the watcher - one maiden breaks her needle and sticks thepieces into the soles of the dead man's feet, while another watcher, a strong man, physicallyforces the corpse down. In some parts of rural Britain today, it is still common (as it was everywhere in NorthernEurope through the beginning of this century) for the women of the family to wash and layout the corpse. It is, and was, thought of as the final act of love shown to the kin. After death, it was common to hold a wake around the coffin with much merriment anddancing; special beer might be brewed for the funeral (Christianssen, \"The Dead and theLiving\", pp. 28-ff). Christianssen also mentions how \"In some districts (Romerike) the opencoffin was left in the room where they were eating and - as reported by an eyewitness - theold women used to say in a plaintive voice: 'now you have had your last meal with us'\" (p.34). In the last century, the dead person was given a parting cup, the velfarskål (fare-welldraught), which had a ritual of its own. In Vrådal, the coffin was placed on the sledge orcart which would bring it to the cemetery, and \"A bowl of ale was placed on the coffin,between two lit candles, and the contents were poured into smaller cups and handed tothose present, to relatives first....(in) Seljord, it is added that the one who led the horse onleaving touched his hat, saying in the name of the deceased, 'Farvel og takk for meg'(Farewell and thank you)\". In Telemark and Setesdal, the ritual extended to someone(usually a relative) giving a longer speech in the name of the deceased, offering thanks andsometimes even answering questions about why he had died or if anyone had been unkindto him. Small wooden drinking cups were put in the bowl to float on top of the ale, and ifany relatives were not able to be there, some of the ale was saved for them (Christianssen,pp. 34-36). Christianssen is dubious about the heathen origins of this custom. However,given the character of the Northern soul as something that passed, at least in parts, to thekin at the time of death, it seems not unlikely that it might have been believed that the deadperson was literally able to speak through a relative, to share in the drinking and expresshis/her thanks, and so forth."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"134 After the dead were buried, a feast was held at which the arvel (inheritance-ale) wasdrunk. If the dead person had been the head of the household, the next head of thehousehold would ceremonially go up to sit in the high seat. The various shares of aninheritance could be dealt out at this time; in today's terms, the will would be read and suchthings as the dead had wanted to leave to specific people would be given to them. Toastswould be made to the dead person, and the deeds of his/her life would be spoken of. Thiswas a time of merriment: Grønbech quotes the \"English priest in the 10th century\" assaying, \"You shall not take part in the cries of rejoicing over the dead; when invited to afuneral feast, forbid the heathen songs and the loud-voiced peals of laughter, in which folktake delight\" (II, pp. 184-85). Dressing in dark colours or pale colours for mourning goes back at least to Indo-European times. It is likely that the traditional dark or pale mourning-clothes may actuallyhave been meant to imitate the dark or pale colouration of the dead (see \"Hella\" for a fullerdescription of these two colours in relationship to death). The black, blue-black, or whitemourning garb thus strengthened the sense of the oneness of the dead and the living: for thetime that the living mourned, they shared a world with their dead kinswo/man or friend.This is especially meaningful during the burial rites, for this border-period when the deadare not quite gone and the living are dressed as the dead is the time when the two can touchmost closely. It may also perhaps have been thought that for the living to imitate the dead toa degree would keep the dead from dragging them on their faring as companions, a fearwhich is usually strongest when the dead come back from the grave, but which is always inthe awareness of traditional peoples (Ranke, \"Indogermanische Totenverehrung\", pp. 113-131). According to Ranke, this border-time usually lasts for thirty days after death. For Troth practice, a general model might be as follows: if the body cannot be laid outat home, it is sent to a professional undertaker for preparation, with strict instructions aboutthe clothing and jewelry if the dead person is to be buried in traditional or ritual gear. Thelich is then brought back to the home and fully equipped with any weapons, tools, or ritualjewelry that will go with him/her. The wake is held in the evening; someone, preferably arelative, sits up with the body all night by candlelight. The next day, the velfarskål shouldbe done (as described above, complete with the farewell-speech if any of the close kin orfriends are willing) beside the hearse before the coffin is driven to its last resting place, andthe rite done at the graveside. If the body is to be burned, the rite may either be done beforethe velfarskål and all gifts placed within the coffin to be burned with it (assuming that thiscan be cleared with the crematorium), or it can be done when the urn is buried and the giftsplaced in the mound about the urn.Burial RiteThe folk are gathered about the coffin (which is still open) or urn. They should be dressedin dark colours. The Elder holds a Hammer amulet or iron ring with Hammers, miniaturefiresteels, and so forth, and three apples - wild apples, if possible. There is a bowl withwater drawn from a hallowed spring at dawn, before sunrise. There is also a horn withenough drink to fill it three times. The blessing-twig should be mistletoe, yew, or from afruit- or nut-bearing tree, preferably an apple. All gifts that are going in the burial should beready to go.I.

Wotan-Blessing (rep. from Our Troth) This rite was written in order to recreate the spirit of a Viking Age sacrifice to Wotan ina manner practical for a time and place in which prisoners of war and other such people areno longer regularly offered to the gods. The subsitution of a figure for a living being isbased on folk customs such as the Swedish subsitution of pig-shaped cakes for the oldheathen Yule boar. Care should be taken with this ritual, as even a symbolic humansacrifice is, in a sense, a self-sacrifice, and certainly likely to draw Wotan's attention.Though short, the ritual is both dramatic and effective, as demonstrated by its recentsuccessful performance at Ecumenicon 1995 (assisted by the Raven Kindred, who supplieda realistic life-sized dummy for the sacrifice).You will need a hornfull of mead, cider, or wine, a blessing bowl, a knife or spear (if youhave one), and a deep blue candle; if recels are burnt, they should be a mixture of juniper,mugwort, and ash wood or leaves (remember that yew is poisonous, whether eaten orburnt). The gift for Wodan should be a small human figure (something biodegradable, suchas bread) with a noose lightly wrapped around his neck. Before beginning the rite, youshould sit for some time with this figure in your hands, feeling might and main flowthrough you into him until he seems alive. At this time you may even sprinkle him with adrop of water and give him a suitable name. Any of the Ás- or Os-names are fitting (such asÁsmundr, Ásbjörn, Osmund, Oswald), since these names show one given to the god, as heis about to be. In this rite, we will speak of him as Aswald. To make the gift, you will either need to go outside to a tree or bring a branch in andfasten it up to use as a hanging-tree for Wodan. If the latter, be sure that there is a wide trayof earth underneath it to catch the drips when you pour the contents of the blessing-bowlover your sacrifice.I. Hammer-Rite.II.
