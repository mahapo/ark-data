These were decades of political transfor-mation and economic prosperity, and there is a perceptible effusion ofcult activity throughout the region. State cults received special emphasisand I will argue that they played a central role in the successful devel-opment of a regional political identity that was vital for the ThessalianLeague during these years of territorial expansion and consolidation.There is, for example, considerable evidence for the adoption of a com-mon Thessalian calendar by new members of the League, for the estab-lishment of new regional festivals (e.g., the Eleutheria at Larisa), and forthe elaboration or reorganization of older cults (e.g., that of Athena Itoniaat Philia). I will also demonstrate, however, that older religious traditionsof memberethnecontinued to be maintained in these newly ‘Thessalian’territories that in some cases assumed new significance by encouragingthe persistence of a local, cultic identity beside a regional, political ideal.In Chapter One, ‘Histories’, I introduce the fundamental issues of polit-ical geography and cultural identity in ancient Thessaly. In the Archaicperiod, the two central plains of Thessaly were divided into four districts(tetrads) for administrative purposes. Tetradic Thessaly was inhabited byThessaloi who may have exercised some form of hegemony in the Archaicand Classical period over the neighboring territories (often described asperioikoiin modern scholarship) of Perrhaibia, Magnesia, and AchaiaPhthiotis. The residents of the latter were regarded as politically and cul-turally distinct from the Thessaloi. Some such relationship may also havewith theethneof the Spercheios valley further to the south (Malis, Ainis,Oitaia, Dolopia). From this foundation, the chapter traces the local his-tories of these regions beginning with the Archaic and Classical periodsof Thessalian ascendency and concluding with the formal incorporationof the Thessalian League into the Roman province of Achaia in . Spe-cial emphasis falls on politics and society from , when T. QuinctiusFlamininus reorganized the Thessalian League at the end of the SecondMacedonian War, to . These  years witnessed the independence andsovereignty of many territories previously subordinate to Thessaly in theArchaic and Classical period and their subsequent incorporation into theThessalian League."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"introductionChapter Two, ‘League Sanctuaries’, explores in detail two Thessaliancults—those of Athena Itonia and Zeus Eleutherios—and their relation-ship to the development of a regional Thessalian identity during the Hel-lenistic era.1The primary sanctuary of Athena Itonia was located nearthe modern village of Philia in rural, western Thessaly. Although shehad received cult at this site since the early Iron Age, there is no evi-dence that Athena Itonia was perceived as a central goddess of the Thes-salian state until the second century, when her sanctuary at Philia wasreinvigorated after the Flamininan settlement in . The decision toelevate this particular sanctuary at this time seems to have been bothstrategic and sentimental: It lay near the mythic invasion route of Thes-saloi from southern Epiros and staked a strong claim to territory that inrecent decades had been the site of friction among Macedonia, Aitolia,and Athamania. Zeus Eleutherios was, by comparison, a new cult for theregion established in Larisa after the renewal of the Thessalian Leaguein . The foundation elevated the prestige of the new capital city ofthekoinonand deliberately evoked the Hellenic patriotism of the Per-sian Wars. The Thessalians, conspicuous medizers, could here be recastas instrumental in this most recent liberation of Greek territory from for-eign domination. The Eleutheria, a festival with athletic and cultural con-tests, attracted participants from throughout the Greek world. A handfulof peculiar equestrian events in the program (e.g.,aphippolampas,aphip-podromas) reflect local tradition and may have been open to Thessaliansalone.While the ultimate function of Greek calendars was to keep time,such mechanisms could acquire profound ideological significance, espe-cially at times of calendar reform. Such a process of calendar assim-ilation and dissemination throughout the territories of the ThessalianLeague is traced in Chapter Three, ‘The Thessalian Calendars’. The cal-endar used by the Thessalian League after its refoundation may havebeen based on the state calendar of Larisa. The chapter charts the rel-atively swift adoption of this calendar throughout the tetrads and thenfollows its spread to the formerperioikoias they entered the League.The unmistakable trend is toward greater uniformity. Some regions,like Perrhaibia and Ainis, appear to adopt the league calendar rela-tively soon after their entrance into the League; others, like Malis and1For a recent study of the politics of several local sanctuaries in second-centuryThessaly (Apollo Kerdoios at Larisa, Athena Polias at Phthiotic Thebes, and ArtemisPanachaia at Halos), cf. Freitag ."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"introductionAchaia Phthiotis, retained local calendrical traditions well over centuryafter becoming politically Thessalian.The varying speed with which the Thessalian calendar was adoptedwithin the League’s newly gained possessions represents in somemeasurethe resistance of local religious identities to a regional political ideal. Sucha tendency may also be reflected within the Delphic Amphictiony of thelater Hellenistic period, for it is there alone that the complete Archaic-Classical spectrum ofperioikoiis visible. Chapter Four, ‘InternationalReligion’, explores the ideological significance of membership in theDelphic Amphictiony at this date and charts the institution’s historyca. –. In , Augustus installed the new colonial foundation ofNikopolis as the dominant member of the Amphictiony by reallocatingthe votes of the Thessalianperioikoi.Theseperioikoiwere now regarded asThessalian from the perspective of Delphi as well. The chapter concludeswith a consideration of the broader network of international religionwithin which the Hellenistic Thessalian League participated.In ‘Conclusion and Postscript: Ainian Futures’ the argument of thepreceding chapters is summarized and reviewed: state religion was animportant apparatus of the Thessalian League and proved vital in the gen-eration of a regional Thessalian identity. At the same time, however, cultcontinued to provide a suitable venue for the contestation of this identity,whether locally or abroad. As a coda to the work as a whole, I offer a casestudy of Ainis and the subsequent religious and political history of theAinianes within the Thessalian League during the Roman Empire. TheAinian experience illustrates remarkably well how the tension betweenlocal and regional conceptions ofethneandkoinacould continue to beplayed out in the language of cult.The monograph is heavily dependent on inscriptions. In most cases,the citation of individual editions or the quotation and translation ofpassages is sufficient for the purposes of the argument. In the ‘EpigraphicAppendix’, I publish new editions of and commentaries on a group ofvictor lists associated with the Eleutheria. These inscriptions providecrucial insight into this festival which was one of the focal points of thestate religion of the Thessalian League in the post-Flamininan period.Many of these texts have not received significant critical attention sincethe  publication ofIG., however, and it has proven possible toglean more from them via autopsy.22The lists were, moreover, presented inIGin a jumble with other victor lists from"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"introductionThe two foundations of modern scholarship for the history of Archaicto Roman Thessaly are O. Kern’s Inscriptiones Thessaliae(IG.)and F. Stählin’s Das hellenische Thessalien.3Kern’s corpus, whichfurnishes the epigraphic basis for all research on the region, made asystematic analysis of Thessalian social and political institutions pos-sible.4Stählin, a practitioner of the traditional art of historical geog-raphy, put Thessalian topography on a relatively firm basis. Althoughnot all of the readings of the former or the identifications of the latterhave been universally endorsed by later generations of scholars, theirwork continues to be the source of much productive disagreement. Theearly generations of archaeologists working in Thessaly deserve mentionhere as well, especially A.S. Arvanitopoulos and N.I. Giannopoulos. Bothscholars excavated tirelessly and published prolifically, and both madeimportant contributions to the study of Thessalian epigraphy, topog-raphy, and history.5The influence of two contemporary giants in thestudy of ancient Thessaly (and much else besides) is felt throughout thepresent volume: Christian Habicht and Bruno Helly. Both can be seento continue the work of Kern and Stählin. Habicht has tended to focuson the politics of the Hellenistic period,6while Helly and theéquipethessaliennebased at the Institut Fernand Courby, Lyon, have taken aLarisa, an arrangement which continues to produce misunderstandings in scholarship,e.g., Miller , p. : ‘These games [the Eleutheria] were apparently not open toother Greeks; only citizens of Larisa participated. An inscription from about the timeof Christ lists the events and the names of their winners (IG., ). Many of these arestandard competitions of the gymnikos agon: stadion and diaulos races, the pyx, andthe pankration, for both men and boys. There were also competitions for trumpetersand heralds. Competitions in literary composition and rhetoric were held, but none inmusic—a significant difference with the Panathenaia: a torch race for boys, the apobates,and cavalry marksmanship, as well as a cavalry charge, an infantry charge, and infantrymarksmanship and archery ... It is curious that the Eleutheria did not seem to have anyof the standard horse races’. Nearly every claim in this passage is incorrect.It is hoped thatthe arrangement of these inscriptions offered in the present volume will help to provideamoresecurebasisforfuturestudyofthefestival.3Major advances in the study of Thessalian history must also be ascribed to Kern andStählin’s predecessors, especially H.G. Lolling, who conducted important topographicand epigraphic research in the region. See Habicht a and Habicht b.

F. Hiller vonGaertringen could comment in  on the topic of Thessalian religionthat ‘eine klare, die Tatsachen gebende Sammlung der Kulte fehlt noch’,and this remains largely true today.8While there are a number of use-ful monographs and article-length studies focusing on individual cults,divinities, or sanctuaries,9there are no grand regional studies the equalof F. Graf’sNordionische Kulteor M. Jost’sSanctuaires et cultes d’Arcadieor any of R. Parker’s fundamental studies of Attic religion. The presentwork, with its focus on a subset of cults organized by official, state actorsin a relatively restricted chronological frame, will not fill this void. But bydrawing together strands of the political and religious history of Thessalyin the Hellenistic period, it may perhaps stimulate further synthesizingstudies on Thessalian religion.The central argument of the present study, that official state cult simul-taneously fomented and fragmented the development of a regional Thes-salian identity in the later Hellenistic period, can be seen to fall withinthe general camp of identity studies. J. Hall’s importantEthnic Identityin Greek Antiquityput the study of ethnicity in the ancient Greek worldon a far firmer methodological basis than it had previously been. Fol-lowing Hall, the essential components of an ethnic group are now rec-ognized to be a shared myth of descent and a shared claim on a territo-rial homeland, and neither is explicit in the case of Hellenistic Thessaly.For earlier periods, there are scattered literary references to an ethniceponym, Thessalos, from whom one may assume all ethnic Thessalianswere able to claim descent. Similarly, there are traditions of a Thessalianmigration across the Pindos. On both accounts, then, in the Archaic andClassical period, there is good evidence that there was a group of ‘ethnic’7E.g., Helly  on the social and political organization of Archaic Thessaly, andDucat  on Thessalianpenestai.8Hiller von Gaertringen , col. .9E.g., Daffa-Nikonanou  on Demeter cult with special attention to votives;Chrysostomou – and Chrysostomou – on Zeus cult; Chrysostomou on Ennodia cult; Hatzopoulos  on ‘initiation’; Graninger  on ArtemisThrosia and ‘initiation’; Kilian-Dirlmeier  on the votives from the sanctuary ofAthena Itonia at Philia.

As Thessaly and the territories of the former Thessalianperioikoibegan to cycle out of the Macedonian and Aitolian orbit in thelater Hellenistic period, the dynamic between the ethnic group and thepolitical collective had shifted. The Thessalian League now commandedconsiderably greater territory than that inhabited by the ethnic Thes-salians of the Archaic and Classical period, and while there are indica-tions that those living within the territories of this renewed, expandingkoinonbecame politically Thessalian, some may have retained their ear-lier, perioikic ethnicities.The present study, with its emphasis on identities grounded in cult,focuses rather on what Hall terms secondary indicia of ethnicity, thatclass of attributes which may very well attend upon an ethnic group, butneed not, and which may be present among other groups that were notproperly ethnic. While such indicia may indeed appear marginal and sec-ondary from the perspective of the formal study of ethnicity, they arecompelling objects of research in their own right. It is now generallyaccepted that there were in effect different types of identity in antiquity towhich individuals could simultaneously subscribe with no inherent con-tradiction. This recognition of so-called ‘tiered’ identity has been a pro-ductive development in recent scholarship and has opened up new andpotentially fruitful areas of inquiry.10In the case of later Hellenistic Thes-saly, membership in the Thessalian League did not translate into mem-bership in the Thessalianethnos, for many individually distinctethnepar-ticipated in the Thessaliankoinon. It is the relationship of these two tiersof identity in the language and practice of cult that forms the central focusof this work. Such questions have tended to be asked of the Early Iron andArchaic periods, but they are just as appropriate in later periods, for thesedynamics continued to influence group formation despite the emergenceof large territorial empires like those of the Diadochoi and their epigonesor Rome.10Cf. the programmatic treatment in Morgan ,passim,especiallyp.:‘Farfrombeing distinct and alternative forms of state,poleisandethnewere thus tiers of identitywith which communitiescouldidentifywith varying enthusiasmandmotivation at differ-ent times. And to these may be added extra-community class or interest bonds ... Under-standing the chronological development of, and balance between, often highly localizedtiers of place and broader notions of people and/or geography in the construction of polit-ical identities is a particularly important challenge’."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"chapter oneTHESSALIAN HISTORIES‘And so it comes to pass, as I have saidbefore, that the boundaries and thepolitical organizations of tribes andplaces are always undergoing changes’.1IntroductionThe Hellenistic history of Thessaly captures in microcosm the tensionsand paradoxes which characterize the broader experience of the region.A first-tier power in northern Greece throughout much of the Archaicand Classical periods, Thessaly had probably exercised some form ofhegemony over the neighboring territories (perioikoi)ofPerrhaibiatothenorth, Magnesia to the east, and Achaia Phthiotis to the southeast. Suchcontrol also periodically extended further south to Malis, Ainis, Dolopia,and Oitaia in the Spercheios valley. Philip II of Macedon establisheda controlling interest in Thessaly, however, and throughout the earlyHellenistic period, Thessaly and her formerperioikoiendured a seriesof new rulers, at times Macedonian, at times Aitolian. At the conclusionof the Second Macedonian War in , Rome imposed a reorganizationof Thessaly as akoinon,or‘federalleague’,andseemstohavenurturedits development so that it might serve as a potential counterweight to theremaining major hegemonic powers of central and northern Greece—thekingdom of Macedon and the Aitolian League. Perrhaibia and Magnesiawere similarly reorganized in , and Ainis and Oitaia soon followed,most probably at the conclusion of the Third Macedonian War in .Theperioikoihad gained an autonomy not known for several centuries.Overthecourseofthenextyears,however,mostofthesenewly1Str. .., trans.

By the time of the Augustan organizationof Achaia as a province in , Thessaly had regained something of herArchaic stature, as had her former dependents.The present chapter will sketch in broad outline the topography andhistory of this region, beginning with Homer and continuing down tothe time of Augustus. Emphasis will fall most heavily on the periodof the second and first centuries, but since the work accomplished inthose years had much deeper roots in Archaic and Classical history, anaccount of those earlier periods must precede. The goal is not to pro-vide an exhaustive political and military history of Thessaly, but moresimply to introduce this complex and unfamiliar cast of regional actors.Theethneof central and northern Greece have largely been ignoredin modern historiography, yet their story is worth telling, illustrativeas it is of the perils of an existence seemingly ever on the marginsof the great powers of mainland Greece. The reasons for their relativeinconspicuousness in traditional histories of the period are not hard toseek: Hellenistic federalism is systematically underestimated and under-appreciated in contemporary scholarship. The issues of political andreligious identity that lie behind the formation of such federal struc-tures have been similarly discounted, especially for the centuries afterChaironeia, and there is little sense that being Ainian or Oitaian orMalian mattered in the same was that it mattered to be Greek or Roman.Inevitably, one is unable to do little more than to sketch, for histor-ical details are thin, and even these will not be exhaustively treatedhere.The second, related goal is to provide an overarching narrative of ter-ritorial expansion and contraction. Theseethne, with the exception of theThessalians proper, for the most part lacked the resources to play a com-manding role in the politics of mainland Greece. But for a brief windowduring the second and first centuries, many of these territories could anddid win a political autonomy that matched their cultural individuality.This too, however, was to be relatively short-lived, as traditional patternsof dominance and subordination were reasserted throughout this periodand each of theseethnebecame integrated within the Thessalian League.Against this background, subsequent chapters will develop an accountof the religious changes that occurred within this transformed politicalframework."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"thessalian historiesTetradic Thessaly before the Macedonian AscendencyIt is conventional in modern studies of the political topography of ancientThessaly to distinguish between Thessaly in a ‘broad sense’ (the greatplains plus surrounding mountainous hinterland plus the Spercheiosvalley) and Thessaly in a ‘narrow sense’ (the great plains alone). Thisformulation, however clumsy, serves a useful purpose and will largelybe followed in the present work.Thessaly in the narrow sense consists of a pair of large plains encom-passing some , square miles and watered by the Peneios River andits tributaries. This Thessaly extends to some extent into the foothills ofthe massive mountains which encircle it on all sides: the Pindus to thewest, Othrys to the south, and Ossa, Pelion, and Olympus to the eastand northeast. To the north is the upland river valley of the Titaresos,which drained the western slopes of Olympus and the eastern slopes ofKamvouni. Access to the sea is somewhat restricted, with good harborageavailableonlyintheareaofthePagasiticGulf.Theelementsofthistopog-raphy, if not exactly unique for the mainland or Aegean Greek world,are nevertheless combined in such proportion and written on so grandand dramatic a scale that it is legitimate to speak of Thessaly as ‘anotherGreece’.2There are no Thessalians in Homer. Phrased in a less misleading way,there are no Thessaloi, although a host of epic’s most significant char-acters have roots in the region. Rather, in the Homeric poems a plu-rality of different kings rule in the plains, commanding allegiance fromvery diverse populations, some clearly city- or settlement-based, somegrounded in broader territory. One need not project such a vision ontoearly Thessalyor to assumethat such descriptionsnecessarily correspondin some measure with early Thessalian history, yet it is curious how theimage of a large territory, diverse and varied in its political organization,so well captures the experience of the region.3In the Classical period,2The memorable formulation of J. Pouilloux, among the greatest scholars of Thes-salian history, archaeology, and topography: ‘La Thessalie est une autre Grèce, parfoisoubliée, celle des cavaliers, non des marins.’3Should one approach the Catalogue of Ships in historical perspective, however, itis notable that very many of the sites mentioned by Homer have in fact produced Pro-togeometric or Geometric remains. This is not to say that Homeric geography is per-fect, for there are some intriguing omissions in the Thessalian portion of the Catalogue,especially Larisa. In the final analysis, it may be that what Homer offers is a vision of apre-ethnos ethnos,anethnos in statu nascendi. See Morgan , pp. – for discus-sion on related lines.

To distinguish the narrow Thes-saly of the Thessaloi from the broader Thessaly of theperioikoi,Iwillusethe adjective ‘tetradic’. For it was the plains of the Thessaloi which a mys-terious myth-historical lawgiver-reformer figure in Thessalian traditionknown as Aleuas the Red allegedly divided into four sub-regions knownas tetrads.5A sixth-century date is often assumed for this activity, andthe tetrads were known already to Hellanicus.6The purpose of such aland division was essentially administrative and likely made the muster-ing of military forces more efficient. Aleuas seems to have further sub-divided the tetrads intokleroiupon which he imposed infantry and cav-alry recruitment quotas.7These tetrads, Phthiotis in the southeast, Thes-saliotis in the southwest, Hestiaiotis in the northwest, and Pelasgiotis inthe northeast,continued to function throughout the Classical period andinto the first century.8That a figure like Aleuas could be imagined to effect such a territorialreform implies the existence of some form of regional government. TheAristotelian circle was able to produce a constitution of the Thessalians;somesuch structure is epigraphically attested in the fourth century and isassumed on the basis of literary sources to have been functioning duringwere likely considerable. That there was no unified vision of the region in so fundamen-tal and panhellenic a text as Homer meant that Thessalian ethnogenesis would dependon bases other than epic.

These elites drew their power primarily from large estates inthe plains, well-suited both to agriculture and stock-rearing, which wereworked by a curious group known as thepenestai,whoperhapsper-formed a role in Thessalian society analogous to that of the helots inSparta.15Despite the apparently peripheral location of these elites in thenorth of mainland Greece and bordering Macedon and Epiros, they werein some basic respects well within the cultural mainstream of the greaterGreek world. Sophists and poets, like Anacreon, Simonides, and Gorgias,enjoyed Thessalian patronage.16Nor did Thessalian elites avoid the goodfood, strong drink, and fast horses for which their counterparts in south-ern Greece were known.17And, most significantly, the tendency towardfaction and stasis was as pronounced in Thessaly as elsewhere. The pol-itics of individual Thessalian city-states may have been often dominatedbylargeandpowerfulclans,someofwhichseemtohaveattaineddynas-tic status, but their supremacy was ever-challenged from within.Thessaly was an early member of the Delphic Amphictiony and seemsto have been a burgeoning power of northern Greece with territorialambitions in the central Greek world in the sixth century.18Astringofsignal defeats at the hands of the Phokians and Boiotians as well as theexpulsion of the Peisistratids in Athens marked the end of this phase ofexpansion. The region medized under the leadership of the Aleuads atthe time of the Persian Wars. Although nominally supportive of Athens,the region was not a major theatre of operations in the post-Persian Warperiod or during the Peloponnesian War.

The foundation of the region, much as Homer described,remained politically fragmented and hence unstable, and the chaos ofcivil war in the region attracted the interest of a series of outsiders:Boiotia, Athens, and eventually Philip II of Macedonia.In summing up the narrative presented thus far on the topic of tetradicThessaly in the Archaic and Classical period, we may justifiably inquireinto the basis of a Thessalian identity and how such an identity couldbe transferred into unity of action, however ephemeral. The Thessalians,with their claim of descent from Thessalos and their claim to commonancestral territory in western Greece, can be seen to meet both of J. Hall’scriteria for an ethnic group in Greek antiquity. Other features furthershaped this identity. Steady, persistent opposition to the two major cate-gories of dependent population in the region, thepenestaiand theperi-oikoi, was doubtless a factor, as was the tradition of conflict with Phokisfurther to the south. Internally, there was a regional governmental struc-ture, however informal, which commanded loyalty from the Thessalians,and from time to time a titular head of this League, who, if the examplesof Aleuas and Jason (to say nothing of Philip II) are at all representa-tive, had the potential to command loyalty as well. Classical Thessalianhistory, especially the fourth century, is filled with examples of divisionwithin the League and opposition against strong executive leadership tobe sure, but it is the potential that such institutions held for organizingand mobilizing communal efforts and resources that is most significant.Regional cult likely had a role to play as well, a point to be considered ingreater detail in Chapters Two and Three, as did Thessalian interests atDelphi, to be considered in greater detail in Chapter Four.Perioikic Thessaly before theMacedonian and Aitolian Ascendency20The ThessalianPerioikoiIn the mountainous hinterlands of the great Thessalian plains lie theThessalianperioikoi, literally the people who ‘lived around’ Thessaly.20For theperioikoi, the older studies of Kip  and Busolt –, vol. ,pp. –, remain fundamental."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"chapter oneThere were three main groups: The Perrhaiboi to the north, the Magne-sians to the east, and the Phthiotic Achaians to the southeastand south.21The present section will sketch the history of these three groups, but itwill be useful to note at the outset two political and religious factorswhich were shared by the Thessalianperioikoiin antiquity and henceallow them to be considered together. First, they were each members ofthe Delphic Amphictiony, allegedly from a very early date; second, eachmay have fallen occasionally into a subordinate relationship with tetradicThessaly over the course of the Archaic and Classical periods. The first ofthese commonalities, their inclusion within the Delphic Amphictiony,will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter Four. It is adequate to noteat this point only that theseethnewere sufficiently well-organized andnetworked among one another to join together in the administration oftwo of the most prominent sanctuaries in central Greece over the courseof the Archaic period: Apollo’s Delphiantemenosand that of Demeter atAnthela. However peripheral and marginal they may appear in modernperspective, indeed even from the perspective of the fifth century, it iscertain that they had not always been such.It is their relationship with tetradic Thessaly, about which they ‘dwelledaround’, that commands our attention at this moment. From an Amph-ictionic perspective, after all, these perioikicethne,andthoseoftheSpercheios valley, were the equals of the Thessalians. It is uncertainwhether this status reflects an earlier political order, however ephemeral.For by the late Archaic or early Classical period, these three groups ofThessalianperioikoiseem to have been brought into a dependent politicalrelationship with tetradic Thessaly.

Thelocus classicusis Herodotus .., where the Thessaliansare depicted offering Iolkos to Hippias to rule in as tyrant followinghis expulsion from Athens. Iolkos belonged to Magnesia later in theClassical and Hellenistic periods, and it is likely that it was part ofMagnesia at the time of the offer to Hippias.24() TheperioikoicouldbeassessedtributebytheThessalians.Forexam-ple, Xenophon can claim that Jason of Pherai ordered theperi-oikoito pay tribute as it had been assessed in the era of Skopas.25Skopas, like Aleuas the Red, is thought to have been one of the partlymyth-historical early executive leaders of Thessaly, often dated tothe sixth century. It is entirely possible that Jason invented thisdetailof Skopas’ career to justify his own current measures, but that sucha claim could even be made in the s about an earlier period issignificant.Inaddition,StrabocouldclaimthattheLarisanshadreceived tribute from Perrhaibia before Philip became hegemon ofThessaly.26() Some sources assert that Magnesia and Perrhaibia were sources ofthepenestaiwho worked the large estates of tetradic Thessaly.

Xenophon’s Jason could claimin the s that when Thessaly was united under atagos,theperi-oikoiprovided light armed troops to the army.28Again, how deepinto Thessalian history such tradition can be traced is uncertain.Some perioikic forces appear fighting alongside the Thessalians dur-ing the Peloponnesian War.Despite this scattered evidence for the subordination of the Thessalianperioikoito Thessaly, it must be concluded that such subordination neednot indicate the presence or absence of a formal regional political andcultural order in theperioikoi. They were well capable of maintainingsuch an organization whatever their status relative to the Thessalians.The chronology and mechanics of this transformation from auton-omous to dependentethneare unfortunately difficult to capture. TheThessalian offer of Iolkos to Hippias ca.  would presumably mark aterminus ante quem, for Magnesia at least, while the original member-ship of each of theseethneon the council of the Delphic Amphictionymay well provide aterminus post quemof the eighth century or there-abouts. Aristotle refers to revolts of thepenestaiwhich ‘originally’ (κατ’%ρ)\u001eς) occurred because the Thessalians were at war with their neigh-bors, the Magnesians, Phthiotic Achaians and Perrhaibians.29While sucha detail provides insight only into late fourth century perceptions aboutthe sources of penestic unrest, it is surely significant that a stage of armedconflict between Thessaly and herperioikoiis envisioned in the dis-tant past. But the Thessalians did not necessarily ‘master’ theirperioikoiin a manner analogous to the Spartan establishment of supremacy inLakedaimonia or Messenia as it is conventionally envisaged, and in somecases, it may be more accurate to see the relationship between Thessalyand herperioikoias a kind of hegemonic alliance.30Most significant forthe purposes of this argument, whatever the character of their depen-dency, the Magnesians, Phthiotic Achaians, and Perrhaibians remainedviable, salient cultural, political, and religious entities throughout theArchaic and Classical periods.

In the Home-ric Catalogue of Ships, however, in addition to the core area betweenOlympus and Kamvouni, they are also associated with territory extend-ing into Epiros: ‘... the Perrhaibians, who are steadfast in war, who setup homes about Dodona with its difficult winters, and who work fieldsabout the lovely Titaresos [River]’.32Beyond Homer, however, literarysources are not of especial importance. The Perrhaibians belonged tothe Delphic Amphictiony, splitting a block of two votes with the Dolop-ians in the fourth century, and they medized like the Thessalians atthe time of the Persian Wars. Strabo indicates that in the mid fourthcentury the Perrhaibians were paying tribute to Larisa, but all of Per-rhaibia need not have been continuously under the command of theThessalian League through this period.33The Argead kings of Macedo-nia, for instance, are known to have had considerable interests in theregion and appear to have negotiated with Larisa on one occasion andJasonofPheraionanotherduringthelatefifthandearlyfourthcen-tury about territorial concessions in the region.34Whatever the situationof Perrhaibia in macro-political perspective, it is extremely likely thatthey had organized themselves in some sort of league by the first halfof the fourth century at the latest.

Like Perrhaibia, Magnesia borderedMacedonian territory, and there are telltale signs of some shared cultural,especially cultic, features between the two regions.40The political historyof Magnesia in the Classical and Archaic period fits the general mold ofthe other Thessalianperioikoi: Magnesia commanded a two-vote blockwithin the Delphic Amphictiony, but was in some subordinate relation-ship with tetradic Thessaly by , when Magnesian Iolkos was offeredto Hippias by the Thessalians.

Such interest was conditioned by several importanttopographic factors: Major routes from the south and southwest intoThessaly ran through the Spercheios valley, and the Othrys massif is notnearly as forbidding an obstacle as the Pindus in the west or Olympus andKamvouni in the north. Moreover, the centripetal pull of Delphi directedThessalian interests into this region throughout history. As in the case ofthe Thessalianperioikoi, however, a politically dependent relationship onThessaly did not completely subsume the cultural and political identityof theseethne.

Ainian coinage begins in thefourth century, and the Ainianes appear as independent actors throughmuch of this period; for example, they forged a treaty with the Spartansin  and were allied with Boiotia at the battle of Mantinea in .51Malis comprised essentially the lower Spercheios valley, borderingAchaia Phthiotis to the north, Ainis to the west, and Lokris (later Oitaiaand Lokris) to the south and southeast.52At various periods of its his-tory Malian territory also extended along the north shore of the Maliangulf as far as Echinos. Although the Malians go unmentioned by Homer,a narrative of Malian migration and territorial conquest seems to havebeen in circulation by the fifth century at the latest, although it appearsin our sources in less detailed form than that of the Ainianes.53Therewas located within Malian territory at Anthela a famous sanctuary ofDemeter. The Delphic Amphictiony, of which the Malians were mem-bers, may have had its origins in an earlier Amphictiony which adminis-tered only this Demeter sanctuary; the cult located there seems to havebeen prominent in central Greece during the Archaic period.54It is notclear whether the Malian relationship with this cult was as vexed as thatof the Phokians with Pythian Apollo at Delphi.

Delphi fell underAitolian control and as a result the Aitolians took a proprietaryinterest inthe Delphic Amphictiony. Aitolia was able to parlay the good will fromtheir service on behalf of Greece into a series of increasingly bold ter-ritorial acquisitions from the s down into the s.

At the celebration of the Isthmian Games in , afamous decree was read aloud; while associated in name with the RomanSenate, it bore the fingerprints of its chief architect, Flamininus.90Thedecree stated that: ‘The Senate of Rome and Titus Quinctius the pro-consul having overcome King Philip and the Macedonians, leave thefollowing peoples free, without garrisons and subject to no tribute andgoverned by their countries’ laws—the Corinthians, Phocians, Locri-ans, Euboeans, Phthiotic Achaeans, Magnesians, Thessalians, and Per-rhaibians’.91Flamininus was subsequently mobbed by those in atten-dance who desired to shake his hand or hail him as ‘savior’.92Afterthe festival, Flamininus entertained envoys from Greek cities, leaguesand kingdoms and made the following revisions and clarifications withregard to Thessaly: Phthiotic Achaia, freed under the initial terms of thedecree, was given over to Thessaly, while the status of Pharsalos andPhthiotic Thebes was kept separate (Aitolia had made claims to bothcities previously); the Dolopians were also freed at this time.93This sig-nal moment in the history of northern Greece heralded the arrival offree and independent Magnesian, Perrhaibian, and Thessalian Leagueswhich began to administer their own affairs for the first time in or more years. Ainis, Oitaia, and Malis remained under Aitolian con-trol.Our historical narrative splits at this point into two parallel tracks:the first concerns the fragmentation of greater Thessaly into a pluralityof free and autonomous Leagues over the course of the second century;the second, the subsequent incorporation of each of these independentpolities into the Thessalian League.Thessaly had been freed in , but there remained the rather seriousbusiness of ensuring that Thessaly would remain free. This was no easybet, and Flamininus, together with a group of ten commissioners, would90Cf. Eckstein , who has argued that these arrangements were most likely notthe deliberate plan of the Romans, but are to be attributed to Flamininus himself who,like many adventurous Roman generals of the Middle Republic operating outside of Italy,appears to have had considerable authority in the management of war and the negotiationof peace.91Polyb. ...

For theyhad been thrown into confusion not only by the faults of the times andthe king’s [Philip V] lawless and violent behavior, but also by the rest-less character of the people, which from the earliest times down to thepresent day has never conducted a meeting or an assembly or a councilwithout dissension and rioting. He chose the senate and the magistratesmainly on the basis of the census and strove to make that element in thecommunity more influential which found it advantageous to have every-thing peaceful and quiet’.95Livy refers to pluralcivitatesin this passage, afact which suggests that Flamininus was concerned with the local, citygovernments of Thessaly in  and that these governments had per-haps been in a state of disorder since the Isthmian declaration and thepresumed withdrawal of Macedonian garrisons. The presence of Romantroops in such numbers and for such a duration must have been a boonto anti-Macedonian elements in the cities of Thessaly and some of thechaos and confusion observed by Livy may be associated with newly pro-Roman factional recriminations against pro-Macedonians. The solutionfor Flamininus was the establishment of a new census and its rigorousapplication, together with the restriction of some magistracies and coun-cil positions to members of the higher census classes. Little can be saidabout census classes in Thessaly, whether before or after Flamininus, butit is worth noting the pronounced aristocratic and oligarchic characterof government at the level of both the city-state and the League in theArchaic and Classical periods. Flamininus does not seem to have devel-oped new magistracies at the local level, though; there is ample evidenceto suggest that the local Thessalian governing tradition remained intact—what differed perhaps was the number of citizens who had access to it.94Appointment ofdecem legati: Liv. ...95Livy ..–, trans.

Nevertheless, it is a fair assumption that Perrhaibiansand Thessalians alike were in similar states of flux and a fragmentaryinscription from Thessalian Metropolis records the prescript of a Flamin-inan letter to the community which doubtless contained similar prescrip-tions.97The inscription must belong to the s, like the Chyretiai let-ter, but little more can be said. Although the contents of this letter areunknown, the clear implication is that Flamininus, as Livy suggests, wasinvolved with politics at the local level in Thessaly and Perrhaibia morebroadly. The Chyretiai inscription thus emerges as a possible templatefor the kinds of problems he faced throughout these newly independent,formerly Macedonian regions.Following the prescript which contains the address of Flamininus,described here as consul, to thetagoiand city of Chyretiai, the letterproper begins with an expression of hope on the part of Rome to appearhonorable and not open to slanders. The target of this opening sen-tencewaslikelytheAitolianLeague(anditspartisans)whichhadbeenunhappy with their treatment in the Roman settlement after the SecondMacedonian War. The inscription continues: ‘Whatever properties havebeen lost by you in land and buildings, of those (now) belonging to thepublic (domain) of the Romans, all of them we give to your city ...’.98Sucha sentiment would seem to make most sense in the immediate aftermathof the Second Macedonian War, when former Macedonian holdings inGreece had been handed over to Rome but before the status of thesepossessions had been clarified by Flamininus’ Isthmian Declaration. Atthe same time, however, it is not certain that even after the Isthmian96IG.,  (Sherk , pp. –, no. ).97Mentioned atBullÉp, no.  andSEG, .

In closing,the letter addresses a related, but different, set of property issues: ‘Butall those who have not recovered what belongs to them, if they notifyyou and if it is the truth they seem to be speaking, and if you conductyour investigation in accord with my written decisions, I decide it isjust (for their property) to be restored to them’.99This statement takesup a more contentious issue, properties whose ownership is disputed.Given the fractious recent history of Chyretiai, one may imagine thatafter the commutation of Roman property to Chyretian property, theremay have been several claimants to a given territory. Cases of this sortwere to be handled bypolisofficials, perhaps thetagoithemselves, whowere to investigate the claims and adjudicate matters in accordance withguidelines set up by Flamininus. There were likely many such lettersissued to the cities of Thessaly and Perrhaibia, perhaps Magnesia aswell.Later epigraphic evidence suggests that, in addition to his interven-tions into the politics of individual cities, Flamininus was equally occu-pied with those of thekoinon.

There is no evidence of a direct,primary assembly of Thessalians, although asynedrion, which is assumedto be representative, is attested. The League began to mint coins early inthe second century and this coinage became dominant within the regionafter the revolt of Andriscus and the Achaian War in the s.103Local,city issues are unknown in this period. Inscriptions cast some furtherlight on the activities of the League.

A commoncalendar seems to have been established as well, a pointwhich will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter Three. Many of theinscriptions issued by the League are honorary, very often for foreignerswho are recognized for their benefactions or service to the League.Such evidence, revealing as it may be for the culture of euergetism inthe later Hellenistic period, gives little sense about how the ThessalianLeague functioned. One inscription is distinctive, however, for the wealthof detail and unique insight which it provides. The inscription, discoveredin Larisa and dating perhaps to the third quarter of the second century,reveals a federal structure that is as impressive in its ability to organizeand motivate its member cities as it is in its keenness to please itsRoman benefactors.104Quotas and delivery schedules were imposed bythe general of the League upon each tetrad, although it is clear fromthe text that individual cities within the tetrads were responsible for thecosts associated with their transport.

Six eponymousstrategoiof the Perrhaibian League areattested ca. –, and one must assume that the office was annual,like that of the Thessalian League.106The prerogatives of these Perrhaib-ian generals are again difficult to grasp, as is the structure of the Leaguemore broadly. The League does seem to have minted coins, and it is pos-sible that there was a federal calendar. Beyond these bare facts, however,little more is known.Magnesia too formed a proper league in the aftermath of the Isthmiandeclaration. But Philip V was able to reacquire the region after his serviceto Rome during the Syrian War107and thus it is conventional to distin-guish between this first, short-lived Flamininan League, and the so-called‘Second Magnesian League’ which was created in the aftermath of theThird Macedonian War, when Rome further altered the political bound-aries of central Greece.108From that point, the history of the MagnesianLeague begins to follow its own trajectory, for the Magnesians alone ofthe former Thessalianperioikoiresisted incorporation into the ThessalianLeague during the second and first centuries.

It is possible that the Dolopians were at thattime formally included within the Thessalian League.This brief consideration of Dolopia and Magnesia has carried our nar-rative down to  when, in addition to the removal of these two terri-tories from Macedonian control and the refoundation of an autonomousMagnesian League, Aitolia was also stripped of some territory, includ-ing the territory of Oitaia and Ainis, both of which appear to have beenrefounded askoinaas well. To these I now turn.An Oitaiankoinonseems to have existed already ca. . The chiefevidence is an inscription which records honors awarded to one Kas-sander, son of Menestheos, from Alexandria Troas by a stunning arrayof Greek polities, among which are several former members of the Aito-lian League, including the Dorians, East Lokrians, and Ainians.110Man-umission decrees of the Oitaians are no longer dated by Aitolian gen-eral in the post- period, but by local Oitaian officials. An obviousinference is that Oitaia, previously administered by the Aitolian League,had become independent after the Third Macedonian War. Some indi-cation of the structure of thekoinonis offered by a group of inscrip-tions recording the Phokian city of Drymaia’s repayment of a loan tothe Oitaian League; the series is securely dated to the late s andearly s.111The League’s eponymous officials are a college of three‘boularchs at Oite’ and a second college of three or fourhierothytai.Theloan was for the not inconsiderable amount of  mnas and reflectswell on the wealth commanded by this young league. By , how-ever, Herakleia Trachinia, and very likely all the territory commandedby the Oitaian League, had been forced into the Achaian League; whenRome called for the release of Herakleia, the Herakleians and Oita-ians revolted from the Achaian League. In , the Achaian League,109For Perseus’ activities in Dolopia in the s, see Chapter Four.110Two virtually copies of the inscription are known: one from Alexandria Troas(IAlexandreia Troas(SIG3A)), the second from Delphi (FD.,  (SIG3B)).111IG., –.

There is thus uncertainty about thestatus of Herakleia Trachinia and the Oitaian League in the aftermath ofthe Achaian War, and it is possible, as I will discuss below, that Oitaia wasincorporated into the Thessalian League at this time.The Ainianes most likely remained under Aitolian control until afterthe conclusion of the Third Macedonian War in . The evidence fortheir independence at this time is circumstantial, but persuasive. Likethe Oitaians, the Ainianes are mentioned in the decree for Kassanderson of Menestheos, and it stands to reason that they, like the Oitaians,had been freed from Aitolian control after Pydna.114The administrativecenter of this league was in Hypata and the Ainianes vigorously embracedtheir new autonomy. A college of five Ainiarchs was the eponymousbody.115This Ainian League embarked on an ambitious foreign policyandextendedgrantsofproxenytocitizensofCorcyraandStratos,aswell as the Thessalian cities of Larisa and Krannon; a Metropolitan,perhaps from Thessaly, is also numbered among these honorands.116Thelatest extant document published by the Ainian League is the base of anhonorary statue awarded to a Licinius Lucullus ca. –.117ReintegrationFlamininus’ Isthmian declaration was a signal moment in the history ofthe central and northern Greek mainland. Thessaly, Magnesia, AchaiaPhthiotis, Perrhaibia, and later Dolopia, were each declared independentand autonomous.

Excessive territorial fragmenta-tion could have the opposite effect intended by Flamininus’ initial procla-mation, especially since Macedonia and Aitolia still maintained an inter-est in the region. In the case of Achaia Phthiotis, Aitolia continued tolay claim to Phthiotic Thebes and Pharsalos after the conclusion of thewar with Philip, and Flamininus seems to have respected the urgency ofthis claim, if by deferring. Certainly in the current climate, it would havebeen relatively easy for Aitolia to reacquire a newly independent AchaiaPhthiotis from bases in those two cities. The politics of such a maneuverwould be more difficult if that territory belonged to a Thessalian Leaguewhose leadership was almost certainly as hostile to Aitolia as it was toMacedonia.Thus Flamininus’ first move was not just to free Thessaly, but to aug-ment its territory, and over the next  years, the Thessalian Leaguewould steadily increase in size. While the motives behind this reintegra-tion are never as clearly indicated by our evidence as we would like, thefollowing three considerations were likely central in each case:() (Tetradic) Thessaly had a traditional political interest in these terri-tories stemming from the Archaic and Classical period.() Thessaly emerged as a staunch Roman ally following the SecondMacedonian War and was a natural recipient of territorial benefac-tions from Rome as a result.() Aitolia and Macedonia lingered as threats in the early decades ofthis period, sometimes quite severely so, and a strong Thessaly wasin the interests of Rome.The experience of Malis is instructive. The territory remained in Aitoliancontrol at the conclusion of the Second Macedonian War and was notfreed by Flamininus at the Isthmus. With its strong citadel at Lamia andexcellent harborage on the Malian Gulf at Phalara, whoever controlledMalis possessed a strategic foothold in central Greece. It is therefore notsurprising that the region emerged as a flashpoint in the Syrian Warfought by Rome with her Macedonian allies against Antiochus III and118Polyb. ... Cf. Liv. ..–. Neither Polybius nor Livy discusses the motiva-tion for the changed status of Achaia Phthiotis. The Lokrians and Phokians had also bothtechnically been freed by the Isthmian declaration only to be subsequently incorporatedinto the Aitolian League (Polyb. ..). Pharsalos and Phthiotic Thebes were not to beincluded within the Thessalian League, however."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"thessalian historieshis Aitolian allies. To encourage eager Macedonian participation in theconflict, Rome had informally promised Philip V that he could retain anyterritory which he captured from Aitolia during the war.119When Philipwas on the verge of taking Lamia by siege in winter , Glabrio orderedthe Macedonian king to withdraw.120Glabrio subsequently took the cityin . The city was not returned to Aitolia under the terms of the treaty between Aitolia and Rome, and by /, the city of Lamia wasdating its decrees by the generals of the Thessalian League.121A second phase of Thessalian expansion most likely took place inthe s. A series of manumissions from Pythion in Perrhaibia is datedby generals of the Thessalians. The earliest of these inscriptions mostlikely dates to ca. –/, a fact which suggests that Pythion, and byextension Perrhaibia as a whole, was then under Thessalian control.122Although no sources explicitly discuss the date of this development,Kramolisch has cogently argued for , following the Achaian War.123Motives are uncertain. Good precedent for such expansion existed inthe cases of Malis and Achaia Phthiotis, both of which had previouslybeen incorporated into the Thessalian League. The Thessalian League hadmoreover proved itself a steady, if not particularly efficient, ally of Romein the years since the Flamininan refoundation and thus was a suitable119Cf.

Although the revolt of Andriskos in  had indeed beensevere, Roman hegemony in northern Greece was not seriously chal-lenged. Nevertheless, given the geography and former history of Per-rhaibia, pro-Macedonian sentiment in the region was likely to be quitestrong and potentially destabilizing in the event that another Antigonidpretender appeared.A more circumstantial case can be made for the Oitaian League’s incor-poration into the Thessalian League at this time as well. The key evidenceis a fragmentary decree of the Thessalian League which calls for its con-tents ‘to be announced in all the cities of Thessaly and to be publishedin the marketplaces of Melitaia and Herakleia’.124Such instructions sug-gest that Herakleia Trachinia was a member of the Thessalian League atthe time of the decree’s publication. The orthography of the decree andthe formulae deployed therein are consistent with a date in the secondcentury.125Historical circumstances make a post- date likely, but thequestion must remain open.126The third and final phase of territorial expansion took place probablya century later. The Ainian League is last certainly attested ca. –.127Theterminus ante quemfor Ainian entrance into the Thessalian Leagueis less certain. A manumission from Hypata dated to the s ce uses thestrategosof the Thessalian League as eponymous official and is the earli-est uncontroversial evidence for the entrance of Ainis into the ThessalianLeague.128It is possible that some elites from Hypata held the general-ship of the Thessalian League, perhaps as early as the s bce, and cer-tainly by ce.129While this broad chronological range would support124Helly  (SEG, ), a reedition ofIG., , l. –:!μ π\u001eσαις τα\u0019ς|κατ\u001dΘεσσαλ\u0019αν π#λεσιν,κα %ναγρα|-=ναι τ#δε τ4 ψ\u0006-ισμα κα !ν τ=ι|%γ\u000eρ1[ι]τ ν8Ηρακλε[ιωτ ν]κα Μελιτ[αι]|[.ων].125Helly , p. .126Polyb. ..– notes that after Skarpheia a Thessalian Philon, perhaps a memberof an elite Larisan family and later general of the League in / (cf.

Ainian elites appear precocious by comparison.Augustus andProvincia AchaiaThessaly’s role in the broader narrative of Rome’s confrontation andengagement with the Hellenistic East grows smaller in the decades afterthe Achaian War.

Kallet-Marx has persuasivelydescribed a significant shift in Greek and Roman attitudes toward theexercise of Romanimperiumin the east in the aftermath of the Mithri-datic wars. The initial encounters with Mithridates had demanded themaintenance of a more extensive Roman military presence in the East,which in turn demanded more money with which to pay this military.The East was to be the source of these moneys, and it is in the wake ofa Hypatan inscription (IG., ) the name of a Thessalian Leaguestrategosas eponymand redating the inscription to the s bce (for the general, restored as Italos, son ofPhiliskos, from Gyrton, cf.

They were thus initially both importantcenters for the state religion of the renewed League and focal points forthe development and extension of Thessalian identity within the politicalorder of Flamininan Greece. Both would continue to play such a roleover the course of the second and first centuries. The sanctuaries are apeculiar pair: thetemenosof Zeus Eleutherios was almost certainly anew foundation in the League’s capital city; Athena Itonia, by contrast,had been worshipped since ca. , and perhaps even earlier, at a ruralsite in southwestern Thessaly—the tetrad Thessaliotis—near the modernvillage of Philia. The latter was a distinctive figure in the panthea of thecentral and northern Greek mainland, while the former enjoyed a nearpanhellenic status. The union of the two in state religion was distinctlyThessalian and acutely reflects the League’s challenges and aspirations inthe later Hellenistic period.21Of the earlier Thessalian League, only one decree published under its authority isknown, a fourth-century award of proxeny which is unfortunately unprovenanced. I havesuggested at Graninger  that the major sanctuary of Ennodia at Pherai was a likelyvenue for publication.2Such a union may have been fully realized on the coinage of the second and first-century Thessalian League. The striding Athena promachos figure, helmeted and holdingshield and spear, is prominent on the reverse of nearly every issue from this period and isuniversally identified as Athena Itonia (cf., e.g.,SNGThessaliapl. –, no. –). Theportrait of a bearded figure wearing an oak crown on the obverse of the majority of theseissues is consistent with the iconography of Zeus (cf., e.g.,SNGThessaliapl. , no. –), and it is an easy inference that he would have been recognized as Zeus Eleutherios.Axenidis a, vol. , p.  has suggested that the cult image of Zeus Eleutherios housedwithin his temple in Larisa may have provided the model for this image."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"chapter twoInthecaseofAthenaItonia,thedecisiontoelevatethePhiliasanctuaryto federal status at this time was as strategic as it was sentimental. It laynear the mythic migration route of Thessaloi from southern Epiros andstaked a strong claim to territory that in recent decades had been thesite of friction between Macedon and Aitolia. The cult and sanctuary ofZeus Eleutherios also looked to history both recent and past. This newfoundation evoked the Hellenic patriotism of the Persian Wars and castthe Thessalians, conspicuous medizers in that earlier conflict, as nowinstrumental in both the Macedonian defeat in the Second MacedonianWar and the attendant liberation of central and southern Greece fromforeign domination. But this spirit of panhellenism had a strong localinflection, as the inclusion of some epichoric events in the agonisticprogram of the major penteteric festival celebrated at Larisa in ZeusEleutherios’ honor suggests. The Larisan setting for the cult, moreover,provided religious reinforcement to the city’s status as capital of theFlamininan Thessalian League.Before describing the history of these sanctuaries in detail, it will beuseful to begin with a preliminary query: What are federal sanctuar-ies? A simple answer to this deceptively simple question is that a federalsanctuary is any sanctuary which is patronized by a federal league (orapparatus thereof). There should be evidence, for example, of substan-tial and repeated investment there in the form of dedications, publica-tion of important league documents, festival administration, or sanctu-ary improvement conducted in the name of the federal league in ques-tion. This is a rough definition, for there really can be no one and pre-cise definition that would suggest the variations to be found over theentire category; nevertheless, it may suffice for identifying many exem-plars of this category of sanctuary throughout the Greek world. This isnot to imply that all federal sanctuaries functioned the same or evensimilarly, for there is abundant evidence of strong diachronic inter- andintra-regional variation. But the fundamental need or desire of fed-eral polities to express themselves in cult or cultic contexts remainsunchanged.Any discussion of federal sanctuaries is thoroughly, if implicitly, boundto assumptions about the character ofethnosreligion. Few white whalesin the modern historiography of ancient Greece have been as disruptiveas theethnos, and the reverberations from the debates surrounding its‘essence’ substantially impact the present work. This is not the place tonarrate evolving modern scholarly conceptions of Greekethnein anygreat detail, but I hope that a crude sketch of the status quo and recent"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"the federal sanctuarieschallenges to it will prove useful for the studies which follow.3For earliergenerations of scholars, Greece had two shapes—the one organized andgoverned under the rubric of thepolis, the other, less sharply defined,and assumed to be more primitive in development and backward in ori-entation, was theethnos. Among the myriad differences between thesetwo modes of organization, special emphasis was laid on how thepoliswas organized around an urban center and drew much of its authorityfrom an ideal of citizenship rooted in institutions, while theethnos,witha population spread sparsely over large tracts of countryside, drew whatauthority it had from participation in a common cult located at a solitaryrural shrine: ‘the unity of the tribe remained alive and generally acknowl-edged, particularly when supported by a common centre of worship ofthe tribal god’.4Challenges to this long dominant model of the Greekethnosand itspolar opposition to the Greekpolishave been mounted on a variety ofcritical lines. In general, the terms of this binary analysis have begunto fragment, if not collapse altogether. Just as there were many varietiesofpolis, each reflecting essentially local circumstances of topography,population, and economy, so, too, no twoethnewere alike. To regardeitherpolisorethnosas a unitary phenomenon is a mistake. And, indeed,from a material perspective, it is unsettling how closely sites associatedwith pre- or proto-poleiscan resemble those found within pre- or proto-ethne.5A second important line of criticism has recognized thatethnewere in no sense backwaters, but fully implicated in the major culturaland economic developments of the Archaic and Classical period. Theforms of political organization adopted in such regions are increasinglyviewed not aspolis-style institutions that had been ‘nipped in the bud’,but as institutions that were especially well-suited to the local challengesof landscape and prevailing habitation pattern in eachethnos-area. Thisis above all the case for Classical and Hellenistickoina,wherethebondsofethnosidentity were crystallized via more formal political institutions.3For an excellent overview of earlier scholarly approaches to theethnos, see McIner-ney .

The symbolic construction of Philia as afederal sanctuary by the Thessalian League thus emerges as the productof a potentially contentious process of selection rather than inertia.It is appropriate to begin with the mythologies of this particular hy-postasis of Athena and the etymologies of her epithet. A Thessaliangoddess Itonia was a topic of discussion as early as Hecataeus, althoughdetails of his account unfortunately do not survive.9More information isgleaned from theThebaikaof Armenidas, a work which Jacoby dates tothefifthcentury,wheretheThessaliancityofItonosandAthenaItonisarealleged to have been named after Itonos, son of Amphictyon.10Adoubleassociation is exposed, first with the hero Itonos, secondarily with theThessalian city of Iton (or Itonos).

This Amphictyon, the eponymous hero of the Delphic Amph-ictiony (not the homonymous king of early Athens), was worshippedalongside Demeter Amphictyonis at Anthela already in the fifth century,and as the epithet of that goddess suggests, he may have been perceived ascentral to the establishment of the cult in the sacred time of myth.12J. Hallhas recently demonstrated how the mythical descendants of Amphictyonmay track the spread of membership in the Delphic Amphictiony. Amph-ictyon’s three sons Malos, Itonos, and Physkos, can be linked closely withethnein the area of the Spercheios valley and neighboring Anthela: Maloswas eponym of the Malians, Physkos a central hero of the Lokrians, andItonos a major figure in Phthiotic Achaia.13The next stage in the Amphic-tionic genealogy witnessed the birth of Ion and Lokros (by Physkos) andBoiotos (by Itonos), and by extension, the subsequent incorporation ofIonians and Boiotians (and Lokrians) into the Amphictiony. Thus Itonos’lineage immediately thrusts us into a much broader ambit, taking in theSpercheios valley to the south, the grand sanctuaries at Anthela and Del-phi, and indeed, through his subsequent siring of Boiotos, to the northernborders of Attica.A pair of daughters are also associated with Itonos: Athena (almostcertainly a ‘foster’ child from Olympos) and Iodama. The genealogistSimonides records a curious tale about them: ‘... Itonos had two daugh-ters, Athena and Iodama, who in contention during a battle in arms,advanced against one another in strife, and that Iodama was killed byAthena’.14The tale contains elements also present in the of a better-knowntradition of Athena and Pallas, which may have had a near panhelleniccurrency.15Athena is here revealed as a martial goddess, albeit one whosestrengths are not governed subtly bym ̄etisbut are brutish and destructiveof the family.The familial nexus of Itonos, Iodama, and Boiotos allows the goddess’militant character to be gleaned in broader perspective.

In the historical era, thissanctuary would become a principal sanctuary of the Boiotiankoinonand site of the annual festival of the Pamboiotika: ‘And so Koroneia isnear Helikon founded upon a height, and the Boiotians after the TrojanWar returning from Thessalian Arne took it, when indeed they alsotook Orchomenos. After conquering Koroneia, in the plain before itthey established a sanctuary of Athena Itonia homonymous with theThessalian, and they called the river flowing alongside it the Kouarios,which sounds similar to the one in Thessaly. But Alcaeus calls it theKouralios ...’.17It is unclear what historical reality, if any, lay behind thistradition. What is significant, however, in this ‘Boiotian’ passage is itsevidence for a discourse that links Athena Itonia, Boiotia, and Thessaly,and its redeployment and elaboration of elements from Athena Itonia’sThessalian setting. Here Athena Itonia is a figure of conquest whosecult marks the entry of the migrating Boiotians into their historicalhomeland.

Schachter has made the attractive suggestion that ‘Iodama’sfire’ was the equivalent of the hearth fire for the Boiotian League.19If it is in a Boiotian context that Athena Itonia appears most fully devel-oped in our literary sources, it is equally clear that, at the level of dis-course, all roads lead to Thessaly—her murder of Iodama, her genealogi-cal associations with the hero Itonos, and her corresponding geographicconnections with the homonymous city. Her direct linkage with the con-quest of Boiotia by the Boiotoi likely had northern parallels, for as wehave seen, the Thessalians too were imagined as invaders.

In the long dominant, primitivist model of Archaicethne, there ought to have been a sanctuary of such a goddess whichserved as the capital for the Thessalianethnos, and it is not surprisingthat historians and archaeologists have long occupied themselves withthe search for just such a sanctuary. The surviving literary, epigraphic,and archaeological evidence, however, poorly suits such a model ofethnosreligion, several Procrustean attempts notwithstanding.

By isolating the key variables of chronology and con-stituency, however, it will be possible to impose order on these unrulydata.The PharkadonTemenos(?)At .., Strabo writes:3στι δ\u0015 κα Φαρκαδaν !ν τG= 8Ιστιαι:τιδι,καbε5δι’α0τ ν2Πηνει4ςκα2Κ\u000eυρ\u001eλι\u000eς·cν2Κ\u000eυρ\u001eλι\u000eςbυεςπαρ\u001dτ4 τ=ς QΙτων\u0019ας QΑ\"ην1ς 6ερ4ν ε\u0003ς τ4ν Πηνει4ν !\u001f\u0019ησιν.Radtplausiblyunderstandsα0τ νto mean ‘the inhabitants of Pharkadon’.22Adiplo-matic English translation might read: ‘Pharkadon is also in Hestiaio-tis, and through them flow the Peneios and the Kouralios, of which theKouralios, after flowing past the sanctuary of Athena Itonia, emptiesinto the Peneios’.

Thereare several complicating factors, however. First, the Sofatidikos can alsobe plausibly described as flowing by the Athena Itonia sanctuary nearPhilia ca. km to the south. Strabo’s description is topographically pre-cise not in absolute terms, but relative terms, and would seem to allowfor either reading. Second, there is some toponymic overlap with Strabo’sdescriptions of Athena Itonia sanctuaries in Achaia Phthiotis and in Boi-otia, and it is possible that he is simply mistaken in this instance.24Noadditional literary, archaeological, or epigraphic evidence supports (orrefutes) this testimony.25Given these complicating factors, the existenceof atemenosof Athena Itonia in thechoraof Pharkadon is best regardedas merely possible.The PelasgiotidTemenosPausanias describes what may be a second sanctuary of Athena Itonia inThessaly: ‘[Pyrrhus], after overpowering the native troops of Antigonusand his Gallic mercenaries, pursued them to the coast cities, and him-self reduced upper Macedonia and the Thessalians. The extent of thefighting and the decisive character of the victory of Pyrrhus are shownbest by the Celtic armour dedicated in the sanctuary of Itonian Athenabetween Pherai and Larisa, with this inscription on them: “Pyrrhus theMolossian hung these shields taken from bold Gauls as a gift to Ito-nian Athena, when he had destroyed all the host of Antigonos. It is nogreat marvel. The Aiakidai are warriors now, even as they were of old”’.2623For these identifications, cf.

For an important study of Strabo’s Thessaly, seeHelly .

He won a great victory over AntigonusGonatas and his Gallic mercenaries and proceeded to overrun Thessaly.He commemorated the victory by dedicating battle spoils at a Thessaliansanctuary of Athena Itonia. The dedication is also mentioned by Plutarchand Diodorus Siculus, but only Pausanias describes the sanctuary withany topographic precision: ‘between Pherai and Larisa’ in the Thessaliantetrad of Pelasgiotis.27No further literary, archaeological, or epigraphicevidence supports (or refutes) Pausanias’ testimony, and many scholarshave assumed that the periegete was simply in error and suggested thathe meant either the Philiatemenosor thesanctuaryin Phthiotic Achaia.28Assuming error in Pausanias is not as easy as it once was, however.In a recent treatment of Pausanias’ topographic accuracy, K. Pritchettassembled the  most egregious errors allegedly committed by theperiegete and successfully defended him in all but four cases.29Moreover,Pausanias claims to have visited Larisa, and he discussesThessalikaatseveral other places in the text.30In short, there is no reason to doubtPausanias’ testimony on this matter.While Pyrrhus’ control over Thessaly would be ephemeral, the politicsof this dedication offers insight into both the status of Athena Itoniawithin Thessaly and the Pelasgiotid sanctuary of the goddess. Pyrrhusclearly links his own descent with the Thessalians by way of Neoptolemus,son of Achilles, who was regarded as the founder of an Epirote royal line.τ4 !π\u0019γραμμα τ4 !π’α0τ\u000e5ς·τ\u000e\u001aς \"υρε\u000e\u001aς 2 Μ\u000eλ\u000eσσ4ς QΙτων\u0019δι δ ρ\u000eν QΑ\"\u001eνfα|Π,ρρ\u000eς%π4\"ρασ.ων!κρ.μασενΓαλατ1ν,|π\u001eντατ4νQΑντιγ#ν\u000eυκα\"ελaνστρατ#ν.\u000e0 μ.γα \"α\u000fμα·|α\u0003)ματα κα ν\u000fν κα π\u001eρ\u000eς Α\u0003ακ\u0019δαι.

Thus, ‘betweenPherai and Larisa [Kremaste]’ would mean Itonos in Phthiotic Achaia. But the two citiesare not a natural pair, and their coupling here would be forced.29Pritchett –, vol. , p. .

Pyrrhus doubtless hoped toinspire contemporary Thessalians to follow the example of their forbearsby revolting from Macedon. Who was Pyrrhus trying to reach with thisdedication? The Epirote did not go to one of the canonical centers ofThessalian power like Larisa or Pherai, but to a rural sanctuary betweenthe two, and possibly used by both. Pyrrhus seems to have wantedto reach a regional audience. While it is unlikely that this audienceoverlapped completely with the Thessaloiqua ethnos, the inclusivenessof Pyrrhus’ dedication does not rule out such a possibility. One mightsuggest that Pyrrhus ideologically constructed thistemenosas anethnossanctuary of the Thessalians, rightly or wrongly. If he was mistaken,that such a mistake could even have been made nevertheless suggestssomethingaboutthestatusofthegoddessingeneralandthissanctuaryinparticular. In the final analysis, however, it is not Thessalian perceptionsof this sanctuary which are exposed by Pausanias, but those of Pyrrhushimself. As valuable as such testimony may be, it reflects at best theassumptions of an outsider in a particular historical circumstance whomade skillful political use of cult in an attempt to capitalize upon a recentvictory. Indeed, Pyrrhus had attempted to pry Thessaly away from theAntigonids on two earlier occasions in the late s.31Those efforts failed,as would this one.The KrannonTemenos(?)Itonia were celebrated locally at Krannon in the fourth century, as Po-lyaenus describes: ‘During the festival of the so-called Itonia, whichall of the people of Krannon celebrate, [Deinias] merged his troops inthe city with the tax-collectors from the city, and by opposing sober toinebriated men, he killed more than , citizens and became tyrantof the Krannonians’.32Although Polyaenus does not specifically mentiona sanctuary of Athena Itonia in Krannon, the festival here described,31Possibly in , during the succession crisis after Cassander’s death (cf. Hammondand Walbank , p. , n. , and Errington , p. ) and probably again in /(Hammond and Walbank , pp. –).32Polyaen. ., trans.

Given the festival’s appeal to all of thepeople of Krannon, it is difficult to imagine a lengthy procession to theputative Itonia sanctuaries near Pharkadon, between Pherai and Larisa,or at Philia. But, in truth, the festival could have taken any number offorms. Polyaenus’ account is vague. What emerges most clearly, though,is that the festival is framed in terms of thepolisof Krannon and not theThessalianethnos.The Itonos (Phthiotic Achaia)TemenosThere is literary evidence that a city known variously as Iton or Itonoswas located in Phthiotic Achaia and that a sanctuary of Athena Itonia waslocated nearby.33In the Homeric catalogue of ships, an Iton is describedas ‘mother of flocks’ and contributes to the contingent of Protesilaus.34The remaining members of Protesilaus’ forces hail from Phylake, Pyrasos,Antron, and Pteleon, and each of these four toponyms have been veryplausibly associated with known settlements of the historical period:Pyrasos, Antron, and Pteleon were located in Achaia Phthiotis on thePagasitic coast; Phylake, though located several kilometers inland fromPyrasos, was also in eastern Achaia Phthiotis. Given these facts, oneassumes that Homeric Iton was imagined to be located in eastern AchaiaPhthiotisaswell.Such a topography well suits Strabo’s description of the area in theThessalian section of his geography: ‘the Krokian Plain is in themesogaiaof [Phthiotic] Thebes, bordering the foot of Othrys, through which theAmphrysos flows. Itonos is above this ...’35He elsewhere observes thatItonos was  stades distant from Halos, another major city in PhthioticAchaia.36The Strabonic stade is generally estimated at  meters, whichwould give a rough figure of , meters (.km, ca. . miles).37This again squarely situates Itonos in the region of Achaia Phthiotis. Thetopographies of Strabo and Homer cohere. Beyond Homer and Strabo,though, the settlement is mentioned only occasionally in literary sources:33Henceforth Itonos, unless explicitly described by a source as Iton.34Hom.Il. ..35Str. ...36Str. ...37Cf.

And, indeed, there issome slight trace of cult in honor of the latter associated with the set-tlement. Again Strabo: ‘... Itonos, where there is the sanctuary of Itonia,from which there is also the sanctuary of Itonia in Boiotia, and the Kouar-ios river’.40Earlier generations of topographers and archaeologists haveattempted to locate both settlement and sanctuary, with no success. Yetthe literary testimony, however scattered, cannot be rejected or deemedmistaken.41The character of the Itonia cult at Itonos is unclear, although Strabo’sinference that the legitimately pan-Boiotian sanctuary of Athena Itoniaat Koroneia was somehow descended from this Itonos sanctuary hasspawned much informed speculation.42Traditions of Boiotian migrationfrom Thessaly were widespread in antiquity, and within the frameworkof the primitivistethnos, it was reasonable to assume that the function ofKoroneian Athena Itonia for the Boiotianethnoswas analogous to thatplayed by Athena Itonia from Itonos for the Thessalians. The greatestsingle obstacle to such an interpretation, although rarely recognized assuch, is again topographic. For, while the specific location of Itonos isunknown, the general neighborhood is clear: near the Krokian plain inAchaia Phthiotis. From the Classical period at least, this territory wasformally inhabited by the perioikic Phthiotic Achaians, a group that wassocially and politically distinct from the Thessaloi of tetradic Thessaly.That a major sanctuary of the Thessalians should be lodged in perioikicterritory comes at the very least as a surprise, and it is difficult to produce38Anon.de incredibilibus [excerpta vaticana].39E.g., Diod.

Twofragmentary inscriptions from third-century Kos refer to the city, as doesa third-century decree from Larisa. The earliest of the three, now datedon historical grounds to ca. –, details the dispatch of Koan ambas-sadors to Itonos where they are to announce the award of a crown to theThessalianethnosin thanksgiving for an earlier gift of grain made by theregion to Kos in time of need.43A second fragmentary Koan inscription,to be discussed in greater detail in Chapter Four, dated to ca. –,may be a general regulation concerning the dispatch and reception ofthe-oroi.44One group of Koan theoroi are designated as ‘chosen/elected for(i.e., to go to) Itonos’.45There is reference in subsequent lines to Thessaly(and Argos), and so it is again clear that Itonos is viewed by the Koansat least as somehow significant to Thessaly as a whole.46On the basis ofthe limited evidence in our possession, one can surmise that the like-liest venue for such announcements at Itonos would by the sanctuaryof Athena Itonia, and indeed Segré has supplemented this in the earlierinscription. But such testimony, suggestive as it may be, does not yet pro-vide evidence of the status of this sanctuary from a Thessalian perspec-tive.probative and his identification is not widely accepted today). The bellicose character ofAthena Itonia’s iconography and her youthful exercise with Iodama certainly suit such afestival. It is an interesting and plausible suggestion which opens the possibility that Itoniawas a figure of veneration for the Phthiotic Thebans at least, and perhaps more broadlyin Achaia Phthiotis as well. Note, however, that these are not Itonia, but Hoplophania,and if Robert’s suggestion is correct, then it is possible that these were distinct festivalshonoring the goddess.43IG.., . Cf.

There is similarly indisputable epigraphicevidence that, at various points in the third century, Koans officiallyregarded Itonos as especially significant to the Thessalians as a collective.Of Thessalian perceptions of Itonos, we are ill-informed, but it stands toreason that the Koans, like Pyrrhos at the Pelasgiotidtemenos,didnotact randomly.

Characteristic of the Archaic periodwas the extensive dedication of metal votives, including pins, fibulae,and figurines, as well as prestige items such as tripods, weapons, andspits.56Some of this material was likely fabricated on site, including theweapons—a distinctive feature of the Philia sanctuary.57There were alsosome relatively exotic imports, including materials from as far away asLuristan in central Asia and the central Balkans.58The greatest period ofvotive activity at Philia took place ca. –.59Votives were likely hungfrom trees within a grove in thetemenos.6054Walls: Pilali-Papasteriou and Papaefthymiou-Papanthimou ; Figurines: Theo-charis , p. ; Theocharis , p. ; Theocharis , p. .

It may never-theless be useful to put forward an alternative reading of the history ofthe Itonia sanctuaries at Itonos and Philia. As I have argued in the intro-duction to this chapter, a sanctuary’s status vis-à-vis a political or ethniccollective is not static and unchanging, but always has the potential toshed older layers of meaning and acquire new ones, as the circumstancesof its constituents change. The votive record of the Philia sanctuary isastonishing, particularly in its Early Iron Age and Archaic phases, butthere is absolutely nothing within that record that suggests this was a orthe sanctuary of the Thessalianethnosat that time. Whether there wasaThessalianethnos, self-consciously perceived, at this date is moreoverquite uncertain. Over the course of the Classical and early Hellenisticperiod, votive activity at the site declines sharply, suggesting perhaps thatthe function of the sanctuary had shifted. The earliest inscription fromthe site, dating to ca. –, is not a federal decree nor does it in anyway claim to represent theethnosof the Thessalians. It is an emphaticallysupra-polis,butsub-ethnosdocument, attesting to the establishment ofsympoliteiabetween Thamiai and Metropolis.

This does not con-fer ‘capital’ status upon the Athena Itonia sanctuary by default, for thesedocuments reveal nothing of Thessalian perceptions of this sanctuary,but only those of Koans and Mytileneans.Whichever interpretation one adopts, one must accept that the post-Flamininan Thessalian League was a conscious, deliberate actor andthat its patronage of the Athena Itonia sanctuary at Philia, whether thatsanctuary had from time immemorial been sacred to the Thessalians orif its catchment had previously been sub-regional, was by design. Thissanctuary had to be (re)made into a symbolic center of the new federalleague.Philia in Later Hellenistic ThessalyAgainst the background of thelongue duréeof the Philiatemenossketch-ed above, the early second century emerges as a period of transitionchiefly because documents of the Thessalian League began to be pub-lished there at that time—a practice which was to continue into the thirdcentury ce. I have suggested that the presence of this new category of evi-dence does indeed mark a new function for thetemenosbeginning aboutthe time of Flamininus’ reestablishment of the Thessalian League, that ofa principal federal sanctuary of the League.

All of western Thessaly had revolted from Macedonianrule on the occasion of Demetrius II’s death in , and there is intrigu-ing epigraphic evidence for conflict between pro-Macedonian and pro-Aitolian factions at Trikke in Hestiaiotis.78Amynander, king of Athama-nia ca. –, a region of the southern Pindus, must also be taken intoconsideration. Despite the small size of his kingdom, Amynander provedadept at negotiating the new realities of power in mainland Greece andcertainlyhadterritorialambitionsinThessaly.79Therewasthuseveryrea-son to suspect that western Thessaly would continue to be contentiouswith the addition of an autonomous Thessalian League as a new territo-rial competitor in . Thessalian League investment in the Philia sanc-tuary must be seen as a vital claim on this area and a clear sign to net-tlesome Aitolian, Macedonian, and Athamanian neighbors that this wasnow Thessalian land.The site’s epigraphic record in the later Hellenistic period, mentionedbriefly above, gives a clearer sense of how the sanctuary may have func-tioned as a federal sanctuary. Decrees honoring League benefactors couldbe published there, and it was an appropriate venue for erecting hon-orary statues for said benefactors.80For such gestures to be regarded aslegitimate honors, a festival audience must be assumed. The summermonth of Itonios, the first month of the year in the League calendar,was certainly the time of the Itonia. Given the presence of the monthname in the Thessalian calendar, one assumes that this was an annualfestival. And it is plausible that the Itonia were a ‘dispersed’ festival; theLeague would have conducted federal Itonia at Philia, but this need nothave excluded the simultaneous (or sequential) conduct of Itonia at othersanctuaries in Thessaly, whether these were administered bypoleis,aswasthe case in fourth-century Krannon, or some other organization.81Themost significant inscription yet recovered from Philia, tentatively datedto ca. –, offers some small insight into this federal Itonia.82The78Helly .79Cf., e.g.,IG., , a donation of ten talents made by the Athamanian kingAmynander to the city of Melitaia for (re)building a gate and wall.

The central role of the League general leaves nodoubt that these particular Itonia were federal.The content and timing of this decree warrant comparison with an-other significant event which may also have taken place at the Philiasanctuary. Polybius, discussing Perseus’ initial moves upon ascending tothe Macedonian throne, observes that he ‘began to aim at popularity inGreece, calling back to Macedonia fugitive debtors and those who hadbeen banished from the country either by sentence of the courts or foroffences against the king. He posted lists of these men at Delos and Del-phi, as well as at the temple of Itonian Athena, not only promising safetyto such as returned, but the recovery of the property they had left behindthem’.83Polybius connects Perseus’ recall of debtors to Macedonia withan attempt to win popularity among the Greeks at large. Indeed, muchof central and northern Greece had begun to slip into an economic cri-sis in the s and Perseus’ very public treatment of his own country-men represented one popular solution. And win influence Perseus did:Aitolia, Thessaly, and Epiros seem to have been favorably disposed to theAntigonid early in his reign, and Aitolia, perhaps Thessaly as well, soughtPerseus’ assistance in confronting their own economic problems in thattroubled decade.84Selection of venue for publication impacted the speedand effectiveness with which Perseus’ program could be implemented.Delphi and Delos are obvious choices for such a display. The sanctuaryof Athena Itonia requires more explication. Which sanctuary did Poly-bius mean? The sanctuary at Boiotian Koroneia and that at ThessalianPhilia are the best candidates, and scholars have been split. Reasonablearguments can be advanced for both. In Boiotia and the Boiotian League,Perseus had strong allies, particularly at Thebes, and he would conclude83Polyb. ..–, trans.

There is moreover a pronounced inter-est in the ‘ancestral’ borders of Macedonia during Perseus’ reign, and thedistinction between Thessaly and the core Macedonian heartland furthernorth had been nearly elided over the course of a century and a half ofMacedonian control. It is tempting to see Perseus taking advantage of thecurrent economic crisis to make a symbolic reassertion of Macedonianpower at the southwestern frontier of the earlier, third-century Antigonidkingdom. The question cannot be solved in the current state of evidence.With Rome’s success during the Third Macedonian War, their reduc-tion of the revolt of Andriscus, and their victory in the Achaian War, theneighborhood of Philia grew less fractious and competitive, a fact whichmay be revealed in the upward trend in votive activity in the first century.Otherwise, the epigraphic record suggests that the function of the sanc-tuary remained consistent throughout this period. Given the profusionof manumission inscriptions in Thessaly at this time, it is tempting tospeculate that manumissions took place at Philia as well, although directevidence for this in the Hellenistic period is lacking.86Zeus Eleutherios at LarisaUnlike Athena Itonia, Zeus Eleutherios was a new figure in Thessalianreligion. The earliest evidence for his cult in the region dates to thes and is centered in Larisa.

Given the valence of other,earlier foundations of Zeus Eleutherios cults in the Greek world, sucharguments for a  foundation date make good intuitive sense. There isno compelling reason to doubt their validity, but positive proof remainswanting.The special circumstances of Thessalian liberation, in particular, thehigh profile of Rome and the influence of Flamininus in reorganizingThessalyin the years after the Second Macedonian War, must have playeda significant role in determining the character of this particular ZeusEleutherios. There was probably no shortage of suitable divinities tolaud after Kynoskephalai and around whom narratives of recent gloryand promised future success could have been established. One can thusregard the establishment of the Larisan cult as deliberate (again perhapsbearing the fingerprints of Flamininus), and err on the side of expan-siveness in reading the significance of the cult for the newkoinon.Inwhat follows, I examine two historical paradigms which appear to haveexerted a strong influence over this new foundation—the foundation ofa cult of Zeus Eleutherios at Plataia after the Greek victory there in thePersian wars and the funeral honors awarded Pelopidas after his death atKynoskephalai in —before turning to a broader consideration of thecult and its associated festival, the Eleutheria.Plataia, Pelopidas, FlamininusThe Thessalians were conspicuous medizers at the time of the PersianWars and thus could not participate in subsequent recollection of thatglorious Greek success.88There is some evidence, however, that suggeststhat the Second Macedonian War was ideologically constructed, after thefact, as an iteration of the Persian Wars. Compare, for example, the elegiactestimony of Alcaeus of Messene: ‘Both Xerxes led a Persian host to theland of Hellas, and Titus, too, led there a host from broad Italy, but theone meant to set the yoke of slavery on the neck of Europe, the other toput an end to the servitude of Hellas’.89Flamininus’ actions in the Second88E.g., Hdt. ...

But the macro-political environment had changed—whereXerxes sought to enslave a previously free Greece, Flamininus, within therhetoric of the epigram, intended to free a Greece that had fallen into aservile condition. The individual most currently responsible for Greece’sstatus, Philip V, is unmentioned, but the association between him andXerxes is unmistakable. Philip had actually accomplished what Xerxeshad only imagined, and Flamininus’ reversal is thus doubly sweet, a trueliberation.90Against this backdrop, replete with Persian War imagery, the establish-ment of a cult of Zeus Eleutherios in Larisa acquires an important layer ofmeaning. Flamininus’ Isthmian proclamation was predicated on Romanvictory in the Second Macedonian War. Much of the campaigning tookplace on Thessalian soil, including the climactic battle at Kynoskephalai,and thus this new liberation had by extension a strongly Thessalian color.Thessaly could now be recast as instrumental in the liberation of Greece.As I will argue below, the panhellenic significance of the victory was insome measure mirrored by the panhellenic aspirations of the cult andfestival.It is therefore not surprising that this new cult foundation at Larisa hadan explicit parallel from the Persian War era, for a cult of Zeus Eleuthe-rios had been established in the neighborhood of Plataia in , afterthe Greek victory there.91The history of the cult and its associated fes-tival, the Eleutheria, is amply attested in literary and epigraphic sources,although it is no less problematic for being so. A complete rehearsal ofthe evidence is not warranted here, but a brief developmental outline maybe useful. In the aftermath of the victory, perhaps in fulfillment of a vow,perhaps simply in thanksgiving or to commemoratethe Greeks’ stunning90See Walbank , p. , n. . Walbank , p. , n. , and p. , n. , has attractivelysuggested that Philip had already been at work attempting to paint the invading Romansas new Persians, thus reviving the traditional anti-Persian role of Macedonian kings.Alcaeus’ epigram can in this light be seen to anticipate just such a charge on the partof the Macedonians.91The most comprehensive discussion of the cult of Zeus Eleutherios at Plataia andthe festival of the Eleutheria celebrated there is Schachter –, vol. , pp. –, whocollects the primary sources and provides an overview of earlier scholarship.

Patronageof the cult and festival varied over time, and one may glimpse variousappropriations of this comparatively pure Persian War ideology by sup-porters and opponents of Macedonian hegemony on the Greek mainlandin the fourth and third centuries to Roman emperors of the first and sec-ond centuries ce.Another layer of history recalled by the establishment of this cult andfestival looked to a later era—the mid fourth century—when anothermajor battle fought at Kynoskephalai with Thessalian freedom at stake.In , the Theban general Pelopidas led a joint Thessalo-Boiotian forceto victory over Alexander of Pherai. Thessaly had been a cornerstonein the development of Boiotian policy in northern Greece after thebattle of Leuktra in .92By , Pelopidas, responding to a ThessalianLeague (perhaps narrowly Larisan) entreaty to intervene in the civilwar being fought against Alexander of Pherai, appears in Thessaly, firstnegotiating with Alexander, then campaigning against him.

In the oath which the Athenians are to take to cement the alliance,they are to swear to oppose anyone who overthrows the electedarchonof the Thessalian League or imposes a tyrant in the region. Alexanderof Pherai is the obvious referent, but one senses that this inscription isdirected against the broader circumstances which had engendered theregional conflicts of the preceding half century. That there was a formalconstitution at this time cannot be in doubt, although one can do littlemore than speculate as to its general shape. The division of the region intothe four tetrads of Aleuas is attested in this dossier, and that Thessalianmilitary forces were organized accordingly is suggested by the presenceof a college of fourpolemarchs,oneforeachtetrad,amongtheoathtakers. There is reason to suspect that the institutional reformation ofthe Thessalian League was at root a reorganization of Thessalian militaryforces, both infantry and cavalry. Again, Pelopidas’ hand, though notspecifically attested, is not hard to perceive.In , Pelopidas was again in Thessaly, leading a coalition of Thes-salian and Boiotian forces against Pherai and her allies. Pelopidas’ sidewould emerge victorious, although the general died in the encounter. Atthis point Thessalian sentiment toward the Theban general is clearest.93The dating of this reorganization is vexed.

From the cities, too, when tidings of these thingsreached them, came the magistrates, accompanied by youths and boysand priests, to take up the body, and they brought trophies and wreathsand suits of golden armour’.96Cornelios Nepos supplements this accountby observing that all of the Thessalian cities set up bronze statues inhonor of Pelopidas and made substantial gifts of land to his children.97Αt Delphi a fragmentary statue base is preserved with an inscribeddedicatory epigram indicating that the Thessalians had dedicated a statueof Pelopidas made by Lysippos: ‘After destroying Sparta ... with praise...manytimes...toerect...Boiotian.Pelopidas[sonofHippokles,Theban] the Thessalians dedi[cated to Pythian Apollo].

Yet,once recalled, the differences between the outcomes of the two battles ofKynokephalai may have overshadowed the similarities. Pelopidas’ deathduring the battle ensured that the Thessalian League would not growpast its infancy, and that regional civil war would continue. The ultimateoutcome would be the intervention of Philip II and his probable electionasarchonof the Thessalian League which inaugurated over  yearsof Thessalian subordination to Macedonian rule. Flamininus’ victory in, if not on the same battlefield then certainly in the same area,101would in some ways put the finishing touches on Pelopidas’ northernproject, albeit in radically altered political circumstances.Despite the regional, Thessalian significance of a second battle atKynoskephalai, and the plainly panhellenic aspirations of the establish-ment of a Zeus Eleutherios cult in Larisa, victory in the Second Macedo-nian War can only be described tendentiously as narrowly Thessalian orGreek. For this was a predominantly Roman victory, fought primarily byRoman forces led by Roman generals. In , Livy depicts Roman ambas-sadors appearing before the council of the Thessalian League, wheremutual courtesies were exchanged—the Romans for Thessalian supportduring the Second Macedonian War and the War with Antiochus, theThessalians for the gift of their freedom.102Responsibility for Thessalianfreedom and autonomy lay at the feet of Flamininus most of all, and itwould be surprising if his memory was not honored in some way at theEleutheria in Larisa.

In some ways,Rome was just another Hellenistic kingdom, Flamininus another (effec-tive) general. While Plutarch presents an image of Greeks who are raptand rapturous upon hearing his Isthmian proclamation,103the truth ofthe matter is that such sentiments were a commonplace in interstate rela-tions.104Was this a case of empty rhetoric, or could Flamininus actuallydeliver? The following years would see him intervening directly in Thes-salian affairs with great benefits to the region. Over the course of severalextended stays, he put the Thessalian League on a firm institutional foot-ing and helped adjudicate in what must have been an endless series ofmessy legal disputes.

No other sanctuary of the god is attested in Thessaly. Unfor-tunately, the site of the sanctuary is not precisely known. A. Tziaphalias,however, has made a plausible, if circumstantial, case that the sanctuarywas near the so-called ‘free agora’ of ancient Larisa, where rescue exca-vations have exposed a number of architectural members of Hellenisticdate suggestive of a large, public building of the Doric order, togetherwith bases for votive offerings and an inscription with a preserved publi-cation clause mentioning the sanctuary of Zeus Eleutherios.106Much of103Plut.

Fragments of seven Eleutheria victor lists dating to the second andfirst centuries are preserved, and these provide important insight into thecharacter of the festival.108Several commemorative or honorary inscrip-tions celebrating victorious competitors at the Eleutheria are known fromthroughout the Greek world, the latest of which suggests that the festivalcontinued to be celebrated ca. ce, if not later.109I begin with a consideration of some preliminary issues—the date,sponsorship, and periodicity of the festival—before offering a system-atic analysis of the festival program. I have argued above that the cultof Zeus Eleutherios was initiated in Larisa in the wake of the successfulconclusion of the Second Macedonian War and Flamininus’ reorganiza-tion of the Thessalian League. It is logical, though not strictly necessary,that the Eleutheria would have been closely connected with this originalcult foundation.

A fragmentary eighth list (Epigraphic Appendix ) may also be associatedwith the festival.109E.g.,IG, , a Megarian inscription dated to post- and mentioning victories inboxing and pankration; Zachos , pp. –, no.  (SEG, ), an inscriptionfrom Nikopolis dated to the end of the first century ce and honoring a Nikopolitan forwinning the boysstadionat Larisa ([\\π]#λις \\ Ν[ει]|[κ]\u000eπ\u000eλειτ ν|Νεικ\u001eν\u000eρα|Τ\u0019τ\u000eυνεικ\u0006|σαντα !ν|Λαρ\u0019σσGη πα[\u0019]|δων στ\u001e|δι\u000eν).Stadionraces were part of the agonisticprogram of the Kaisarea and the Po[seidon]ia, both of which were apparently sanctionedand supported by thekoinon,inthefirstcenturyce(IG., b); and so it is possiblethat Nikanor’svictorydidnot take place at the Eleutheria.Nothing further isknown aboutthe Kaisarea or the Po[seidon]ia.

Inclining to the earth their clinch-holdat the top, bent easily downward, they overthrew the brute’s mightystrength’.128Some Classical issues of Larisa depict either a horsemanpursuing a bull or an individual actual grasping the horns of a resist-ing bull.129Finally, a series of first-century Larisan inscriptions lists thenames of individuals who ‘have hunted the bull’ during the tenure ofa particular priest.130Spectacles known astaurokathapsiaare known tohave come into vogue in the Aegean in the Hellenistic and Roman periodand Thessalians were regarded as expert practitioners.131On the basisof these scattered testimonia concerning possibly parallel activities, onemay presume that the bull-hunt was a team competition posing consid-erable risk to the participants and considerable staging challenges to thefestival organizers.132125See Gallis , pp. –; Axenidis b, pp. –; Ziehen ; Nilsson, pp. –.

If we are correct to assume that they occu-pied a single day of the competition, then they probably took place in thesame venue, a venue that was most likely distinct from those of the otherthree days of theagon—theatre, stadium, hippodrome.Individuals travelled from all over the Greek world to compete in theEleutheria. Closer analysis reveals, however, that only the melic and gym-nic events display so broad a geographical range of victors. In both theThessalian triad and the equestrian contests only Thessalians are vic-torious. Were these events closed to outsiders? The question is impos-sible to answer, given the current state of evidence.

Two victorlists preserve the full panoply of six equestrian victors. In the earlierlist, dated to ca. –, one victor is known to have served as generalof the Thessalian League (Theodoros of Atrax), another belonged to afamily which produced League generals (Aristokles of Larisa), and a thirdwas the father of a Thessalianhieromnemonat Delphi (Thrasippos ofLarisa).143In the later list, dated to ca. –, one victor likely servedas general of the Thessalian League (Klearchos of Larisa), and anotherbelonged to a family which most probably produced League generals(Timasitheos of Larisa).144That the social and economic class whichsponsored participants in equestrian contests also produced politicalleaders provides some insight into the conservative character of theThessalian constitution imposed by Flamininus.145The women victors in these contests—two of the twelve total—alsocall for some comment.146While neither is otherwise known, and theirancestry is not clear, one can assume safely that they, too, belonged towealthy, influential families.147Another Thessalian woman of the Hel-142Those individuals listed as victors in the equestrian contests were the owners of thehorses and chariot teams and were not actually responsible for conducting the horses inthe competition proper.143See Epigraphic Appendix  (IG., ), with commentary and full prosopographicanalysis.144See Epigraphic Appendix  (Arvanitopoulos , pp. –, no.  (McDevitt, pp. –, no. )), with commentary and full prosopographic analysis.145Recent scholarship on the politics of horses has tended to focus on the Archaic andClassical periods.

If these casescan be regarded as broadly representative, the participation of Thessalianwomen in equestrian events at the Eleutheria was not exceptional orotherwise novel.It was not just the equestrian victors who were distinctive in Thes-salian politics, but the victors in the Thessalian triad also. A full com-plement of victors in these contests is known from two victor lists datedto the first half of the first century. Of these six victors, three had excep-tionally close connections with the generalship of the Thessalian League:Petraios of Gyrton, victor in theaphippolampas, held the office of gen-eral, while Demetrios of Larisa, victor in theaphippodromas,andthesonof Leontomenes of Pherai, victor in theaphippolampas,eachbelongedtofamilies which produced generals.150Thus, in preserved Eleutheria vic-tor lists, half of the victors in the Thessalian triad had direct or famil-ial contact with the generalship of the Thessalian League. At one level,this is not surprising. Horses were central to each event in the Thes-salian triad and there was a close connection between political powerand equestrian competition throughout much of Greek history. The par-ticularly Thessalian character of these three events is distinctive, though,as is its setting within the broadly ‘panhellenic’ agonistic backdrop of theEleutheria. The festival was a centerpiece of the official state religion ofthe Thessalian League which emphatically recalled the ‘panhellenic’ vic-tory, understood in Thessalian and Flamininan terms, at Kynoskephalaiin . Theagonof the Eleutheria, and above all the Thessalian triad’sposition within it, reflected in microcosm the festival’s foundation nar-rative as reconstructed earlier in this chapter. In this light, it is easy to seethey competed only indirectly, through their animals, riders and charioteers,and becausesuperiority might be represented as reflecting resources alone’.

The sample of preserved victor lists represents two chronologicalperiods: The earlier group, comprised of two lists, can be dated to ca. –;151the later group, containing the remaining five lists, can be datedto ca. –.152Comparison of the two groups yields some interestingresults:() The dating formula is more elaborate in the later group. While theearly dating formula seems to have consisted of the name of theagonothetealone,153the later formula adds the name of the priest ofZeus Eleutherios.154Perhaps his role within the festival had grown,whether as officiant, financial backer, or both.() In the early lists, victors from the city of Larisa are designated aseitherΘεσσαλ4ς %π4 Λαρ\u0019σηςorΛαρισα5\u000eς.155The later victorlists, by contrast, uniformly describe a Larisan victor asΘεσσα-λ4ς %π4 Λαρ\u0019σης τ=ς Πελασγ\u0019δ\u000eς.156While this added layer ofspecification may have drawn attention to the ‘Pelasigian’ prehis-tory of Larisa, a more prosaic need was also satisfied. Since the fullinclusion of Larisa Kremaste (located in Phthiotic Achaia) withinthe Thessalian League in the s or s, there were now twolocations whence ‘Thessalians from Larisa’ might originate.157Thusthe changing political topography of the League would seem to bereflected in the ethnic formulae of the victor lists.() Most significantly, the two groups of lists show some variation in theorder and presence of events.

Per-haps the epigraphic habit in Larisa shifted within the chronologicalconfines of this early group of victor lists. If so, then the Thessaliantriad victors in Epigraphic Appendix  may have been listed laterin the inscription, while those in Epigraphic Appendix  may havebeen present in their more accustomed location. The victors in theseevents may even have been listed on a separate stele. It is equallywell possible that the Thessalian triad was not a part of the Eleuthe-riaagonin its earliest stages and that it was introduced at a laterdate.160The question must be left open.As a coda to this discussion of the Eleutheria, I note that another frag-mentary victor list indicates that a dramaticagonmay have taken placein Larisa and attracted international participants by the time of our sec-ond group of Eleutheria victor lists.161Such anagonmay have been partof the Eleutheria proper, or it may have been housed within a differentfestival altogether.ConclusionThe sanctuaries of Athena Itonia at Philia and Zeus Eleutherios at Larisaemerge as the two most prominent sanctuaries of the Thessalian Leaguein the second and first centuries. The topography of the two sites withinthe region as a whole suggests that political and territorial issues wereas important as the gods who would be awarded state cult. Larisa’s sta-tus as political capital of the League was certainly part of the Flamin-inanprogram;theLeaguecouncilmetthere,andtheestablishmentofa League sanctuary with a prominent penteteric festival there doubtless158Epigraphic Appendix  (IG., ).159Epigraphic Appendix  (IG., ).160One may speculate about the relationship between the Stena, probably founded inthe wake of the Third Macedonian War, and the Eleutheria. The Thessalian triad wascommon to both festivals, and it is possible that competition between the festivals was atleast partially responsible for their sharing of these events.161Epigraphic Appendix ."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"chaptertwohelped to legitimize this status. If Flamininus was in some sense finish-ing the work which Pelopidas started, it is important to remember thatThessalian regional politics had been exceptionally unstable at the timeof the Boiotian general’s reforms, and that localpolisrivalries were quitecapable of undoing even the most balanced settlement. By contrast, Philiain southwestern (tetradic) Thessaly was far removed from political cen-ters of power, yet it helped to claim for Thessaly this important terri-tory that had been perennially disputed by Aitolia, Macedonia, and mostrecently, Athamania. The young League’s center and periphery were thuswell defined by these selections. At the same time, the use of these sanc-tuaries as federal space helped to integrate the Thessalian League at thelevel of both politics and cult in the broader Aegean and eastern Mediter-ranean world. There is an international presence in both locations, wherenon-Thessalian benefactors were honored, non-Thessalian athletes com-peted, and non-Thessalian cities senttheoroi.The former Thessalianperioikoiand newest members of the ThessalianLeague have been conspicuously absent from the preceding discussion.With the exception of the new rubric ‘Larisan from Pelasgis’ in theEleutheria victor lists, the evidence to hand does not allow perioikicparticipation at either sanctuary to be reconstructed. Certainly there is noevidence that Zeus Eleutherios or Athena Itonia became figures of cult atthe local level among theperioikoi, and, indeed, the Thessaly on displayat Philia and Larisa appears as one strongly filtered through a tetradiclens. In Chapter Three, I will consider the development of another aspectof the state religion of the Flamininan Thessalian League, the officialLeague calendar, and explore how varying rates of acceptance of thisinstitution among new members of the Thessalian League may indicatethe existence of a tier of local, cultic identity which expressed differencefrom the regional political ideal. If all members of the Thessalian Leaguewere somehow Thessaloi from the perspective of Philia and Larisa, thepersistence of local calendar traditions among theperioikoiin the laterHellenistic period suggests that there could be distinct, local inflectionsof this developing regional identity."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"chapter threeTHE THESSALIAN CALENDARSIntroductionOn November , , the National Convention of the new FrenchRepublic put into effect a calendar that attempted to restructure pro-foundly the popular experience of time. The year was to be divided intotwelve thirty-day months, with the addition of five festival days at the endof theyear and a sixth everyleap-year. Newmonthnames were coined. Inplace of the traditional months of the Gregorian calendar, month namesnow recalled the natural year and were stripped of historical or religioussignificance: Vendémiaire (‘vintage’), Brumaire (‘mist’), Frimaire (‘frost’),Nivôse (‘snow’), Pluviôse (‘rain’), Ventôse (‘wind’), Germinal (‘seeds’),Floréal (‘blossom’), Prairial (‘meadows’), Messidor (‘harvest’), Thermidor(‘heat’), and Fructidor (‘fruits’).1Each month was to consist of three ten-day weeks, with ten hours in each day, one hundred minutes in each hourand one hundred seconds in each minute. The crowning touch was theabandonment of the Christian Era altogether. September , , theday that the Republic was proclaimed, was now regarded as the first dayof a new epoch, henceforthto be regarded as New Year’s Day,  Vendémi-aire (by auspicious coincidence, the day of the autumnal equinox as well).History had begun anew, albeit temporarily. Aggressively secular, hyper-rational, and deeply unpopular, this calendar had been abandoned byJanuary , , when at the Emperor Napoleon’s urging the Gregoriancalendar was reintroduced to France and its territories.While the French Republican calendar was ultimately a failure, themetaphysical realignment that it attempted reveals the enormous pow-er of the calendar both to inculcate its users into a particular ideologyand to forge a shared identity. As E. Zerubavel has observed: ‘Temporal1Zerubavel , p. . Cf. Ibid., pp. –, ‘The new calendar was to symbolizethe centrality of natural phenomena to the life of the new society, thus expressing thebelief of the French Enlightenment in the need for man to be in harmony with Nature’."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"chapter threearrangements are closely related to group formation, since a temporalorder that is commonly shared by a group of people and is unique tothem functions both as a unifier and as a separator. On the one hand,in accentuating the similitude among group members vis-à-vis others,the calendar helps to solidify in-group sentiments and thus constitutesa powerful basis for mechanical solidarity with the group. At the sametime, it also contributes to the establishment of intergroup boundariesthat distinguish, as well as separate, group members from “outsiders” ...’2Citizens of the First Republic were thus in some sense unified by (amongother things) their allegiance to a new temporal order and set apart asdistinct, not only from their contemporary European peers, but also fromthe earlier generations of theancien régime.While evidence about calendar change in Greek antiquity is unfortu-nately not as full as it is for late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-centuryFrance, the intention of the French Republican calendar and Zerubavel’sincisive comments on the relationship of group identity to mechanismsof time can help us to be more sensitive to the possible implications ofcalendar modifications in antiquity.3In the case of late Hellenistic Thes-saly, the need is especially pressing, for the convolutions of politics lefttheir mark on the calendar, and this could only have reverberated morebroadly through the cultural and religious life of the region.4Before theSecond Macedonian War, it is likely that most of the city-states of greaterThessaly, from the Spercheios Valley to Perrhaibia, utilized local city cal-endars which were independent of one another. Given the shared histor-ical experience of many of these cities, in some cases many month nameswere also shared, but on the whole, these were distinct, local institutions,several dozen in number; by the time of Augustus’ incorporation of theThessalian League into the province of Achaia, one calendar was in usethroughout the region.2Zerubavel , p. . Cf. Stern , p. v: ‘The calendar provides an essential pointof reference for interpersonalrelations and time-bound communal activity. It determineshow time is lived and utilized in the community, and sometimes shapes the community’sdistinctive identity. The calendar is also a way of conceptualizing the dimension of time,and hence, of “making sense” of an important facet of lived human experience’.3For discussion of the mechanics of lunisolar calendars in Greek antiquity, see nowHannah , pp. –, and Hannah , pp. –.

Nilsson influentially observed that ‘the names of [Greek] monthsappear in sharp contradistinction to the world-wide method of nomen-clature in that they all, in so far as they are explainable, are derived fromfestivals’.5The evidentiary record, though fragmentary, does not con-tradict such a conclusion and morphological analyses of Greek monthnames demonstrate such relationships again and again. Two basic pat-terns of derivation are prevalent. Months of the Ionian calendars almostalways end in -:νor -ι:ν(e.g., Attic, and other,QΑν\"εστηρι:ν). Thisform is analyzable as an original genitive plural of a festival name in -ια(festival names are regularly neuter plural),6and it is possible to recon-struct the linguistic relationship between month name and festival nameas follows:() The full, ‘original’ expression of a month name will have beenμ\u0006ν/με\u0019ςplus a genitive plural of the festival name ending in -:ν/-ι:ν(‘month of festival x’).() Over time, there was an ellipse ofμ\u0006ν/με\u0019ςand the genitive pluralstood alone, although it was still in some sense dependent upon thisunexpressedμ\u0006ν/με\u0019ς(‘[month] of festival x’).() Finally, the genitive plural in -:ν/-ι:νcame to be regarded asa nominative singular of the month name in question and wasdeclined accordingly (‘month x’, e.g., nominative singularQΑν\"εστη-ρι:ν,genitivesingularQΑν\"εστηρι ν\u000eς).In other calendars of the Greek world (including Thessaly), month namesend in -ι\u000eς(e.g., Lakonian, and other,Καρνε5\u000eς). This appears to be anadjective formed from the name of a festival and it doubtless followed asimilar line of development to what was has been suggested for the Ioniancalendars.7The governing assumption is that the festivals in question would havebeen celebrated during the month of their name. It necessarily followsthat, given the essentially lunar character of Greek lunisolar calendars,5Nilsson , pp. –. Certain federal calendars which used a sequence ofordinal numbers to indicate the sequence of months (e.g., ‘First’, ‘Second’, ‘Third’, etc.)prove the rule insofar as they do not fit Nilsson’s pattern. These cases will be discussedbelow, as will other problematic examples.6Cf. Parker , p. , n. .7Trümpy , pp. –."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"chapter threethese ‘month festivals’ will not have been tied to the solar year in a mean-ingful way.8Thus, even the barest sequence of month names can pro-vide some useful insight into the kinds of festivals celebrated in a givenlocality. As the month festivals of the city of Athens reveal quite clearly,however, there is no guarantee that these month festivals were espe-cially prominent or significant in the religious life of the community.The twelve months of the Athenian calendar (and their associated monthfestivals) were: Hekatombaion (Hekatombaia), Metageitnion (Metageit-nia), Boedromion (Boedromia), Pyanopsion (Pyanopsia), Maimakterion(Maimakteria), Poseideon (Poseideia), Gamelion (Gamelia/Theogamia/Hieros Gamos), Anthesterion (Anthesteria), Elaphebolion (Elaphebo-lia), Mounichion (Mounichia), Thargelion (Thargelia), Skirophorion(Skira/Skiraphoria). While most of these twelve festivals are indepen-dently attested in ancient literary and epigraphic sources, many remainmysterious and were likely small scale celebrations with little direct pub-lic involvement. For every Anthesteria, Thargelia, or Pyanopsia, therewere Maimakteria, Metageitnia, or Boedromia. It is possible, however,that these twelve festivals had originally been significant at an earlierperiod in Archaic Athenian history, hence their original association withcalendar months. Cult and festivals evolve over the course of time andconvention probably maintained the original association of the festivalwith the month, longafter someofthesefestivals ceased toplay an impor-tant role in the life of the community.9The Hellenistic and Roman vogue for honorary month names is re-lated to the issue of month festivals and in general provides additionalsupport for Nilsson’s hypothesis. The earliest such honor appears to havebeen issued in honor of Demetrius Poliorcetes by the Athenians, who8One possible exception, observed by Nilsson , p. , is the month Heliotro-pios, attested at Illyrian Apollonia, Epidamnos, and possibly Dodona (cf. Trümpy ,pp. –). The month name implies a month festival of the Heliotropia, which Nils-son suspects never took place. He associates the month name with the summer solstice,instead. This analysis is accepted by Trümpy , p. . The winter solstice would seemas likely a candidate, but one inscription mentioning Heliotropios indicates thattheoroifrom Magnesia on the Maiander were present in Apollonia and Epidamnos requestinga festival upgrade for the Leukophryenia andasyliafor the sanctuary and city duringthat month (IMagnesia–, dated to ca. ). Such travel is more comprehensible inthe summer rather than the winter (cf. Wilhelm , p. ). The two other possibleexceptions to this ‘rule’ observed at Nilsson , p. , Dithyrambios and Poesios fromPerrhaibian Gonnoi, will be considered below.9Cf. the lucid discussion at Trümpy , pp. –."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"the thessalian calendarsrenamed Mounichion Demetrion in honor of their ‘savior and bene-factor’.10The practice is better attested outside of Athens, where hon-orary months with corresponding honorary festivals occur throughoutthe Hellenistic and Roman East. In Laodikeia on the Lykos and Smyrna,for example, there are attested Antiocheia which took place in the monthAntiocheon; Demetrieia in Demetrion are known from Euboean Histi-aia.11Other months which clearly honor Hellenistic monarchs are wellknown and it is very likely that festivals in their honor would have beencelebrated at this time.12Individual months could carry associations that extended far beyondtheir eponymous month festivals, however. Hesiod warned his audi-ence of ‘the month of Lenaion, evil days, ox-flayers all of them—avoidit, and the frosts that are deadly upon the earth when Boreas blows’.13Anacreon associates clouds and savage storms with the month Posei-deon.14Some authors make more substantial claims on the types of activ-itiesthatwereappropriatetoagivenmonth.TheexampleofDemetriusPoliorcetes is again illustrative. In , fresh from a successful cam-paign in the Peloponnese and after securing Greek recognition for hisleadership of the League of Corinth, Demetrius sent advance word toAthens that he would like to participate in all stages of initiation at theEleusinian mysteries. Plutarch continues: ‘Now, this was not lawful, andhad not been done before, but the lesser rites were performed in themonth Anthesterion, the great rites in Boedromion; and the supremerites (the “epoptica”) were celebrated after an interval of at least a yearfrom the great rites. And yet when the letter of Demetrius was read, noone ventured to oppose the proposition except Pythodorus the torch-bearer, and he accomplished nothing; instead, on the motion of Stra-tocles, it was voted to call and regard the current month, which was10Plut.Demetr. .. Cf. Scott , pp. –; a not unproblematic example, asMikalson , pp. –, notes that Attic inscriptions of the period continue to useMounichion. Demetrion is not epigraphically attested in Athens as a month name.11Cf. Habicht a, p. , n. .12For a full conspectus of these honorary months, cf.

The lesser rites at Agra were then performedfor Demetrius; after this Mounichion was again changed, becoming Boe-dromion instead of Anthesterion, and Demetrius received the remain-ing rites of initiation, and at the same time was admitted to the high-est grade of “epoptos”’.15Plutarch’s anecdote reveals that the months ofthe Athenian calendar were closely associated with major festivals whichwere to take place in them. In the Athenian religious mind, the monthAnthesterionsignaled, among other things, the time of the lesser myster-iesatAgra.InthecaseofBoedromion,aclearrelationshipwiththegreatmysteries at Eleusis (Mysteria) is marked. The Athenians were able tomeet Demetrius’ extraordinary demand and maintain theirnomosonlyby twice changing the name of the current month. Were the calendar lessof a factor in Athenian life, presumably Demetrius could have receivedall three stages of initiation without these temporal gymnastics. As it was,Anthesterion, and Anthesterion alone, was the time of the Lesser Mys-teries, Boedromion, that of the Great Mysteries.The same dynamic is at work in an important inscription from Chalkisin Euboia which relates to the hiring oftechnitaifor the Dionysia andDemetrieia festivals that were to be held in the Euboian cities of Chalkis,Karystos, Eretria, and Oreos.16These festivals had been scheduled inaccordance with local custom for specific days in a specific month. Giventhe hazards of travel and the distances involved, it was foreseen that thesetechnitaimight arrive late vis-à-vis the traditional calendar date for theDionysia or Demetrieia. The inscription thus makes allowances for boththe intercalation of individual days and, if needed, months.17Here toowe find Greek cities taking important precautions to ensure that religiousfestivals take place at the appointed times.Such external associations were not solely religious, however, but ex-tended to other areas of human experience, including war.

The Macedonian army was distressed at the timing of thecampaign, for it was Daisios in the Macedonian calendar and it was notcustomary for the kings of Macedon to go on campaign then. Alexan-der responded by proclaiming that the current month of Daisios was tobe renamed Artemisios, another Macedonian month which presumablylacked such a stigma.18This solution appears to have satisfied the rank-and-file and Alexander would proceed to win a signal victory. Nonethe-less, there is a speciousness to the complaint that allegedly caused thechange in name, and, indeed, there were several other non-calendricalreasons to avoid battle asserted by the Macedonian army at this stage.19What is important is that such a complaint could have been made at alland that Alexander could have taken it seriously enough to alter the nameof the month. Such a course of action implies that these beliefs aboutappropriate activities in a given month could be widespread and influen-tial among the populace.Finally, returning to Zerubavel’s observations on the French Republi-can calendar, mechanisms of time-keeping could be vital instruments oflocal self-definition. Greek calendars, like coinage and dialect, for exam-ple, could be powerful markers of difference among communities andunity within them. One gains some small perspective on this potential ofthe calendar by reading the numerous synchronisms deployed in Clas-sical and later epigraphy—‘in the month Hermanios as the Skarpheiansreckon ... in the month Hippeios as the Thronions reckon’.20Such for-mulations allow one to infer that a diagnostic characteristic of a nor-mative Athenian at that point in antiquity was their use of the Athe-nian calendar. Of course the calendar will not have been as central tothis Athenian’s social and political makeup as, for example, membership18Plut.Alex. .–. Hamilton , p. , suggests that ‘this prohibition was probablyconnected with the need to get in the harvest at this time’.19Loosely parallel to this problem, Pritchett , pp. –, tabulates the festivalswhich hampered campaigning in Greek antiquity. Plutarch’s description of Alexander’ssolution may in fact be an extension of the practice observed by Pritchett, viz., movingfrom a prohibition against campaigning during certain festivals (or during certain timesof the month) to a prohibition against campaigning during the month in which thatfestival took place.20FD., , l. –, from Delphi, dated to ca. –:!μ μην 8.Ε.ρμαν\u0019ωι,HςΣκαρ-ε5ς dγ\u000e[ντι], ...!μ μην 8Ιππε\u0019ωι,Hς Θρ\u000eνιε5ς dγ\u000eντι."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"chapter threein a tribe or participation in the Panathenaia, but it will have helpedmarked him as distinctively ‘Athenian’ as opposed to ‘Delphian’.As much potential as the calendar had to mark difference betweencommunities, there was equal potential to mark similarity. It has longbeen observed that some months are especially common in ‘Dorian’communities, others in ‘Ionian’ communities. C. Trümpy’s recentUnter-suchungen zu den altgriechischen Monatsnamen und Monatsfolgen,whichtabulates all of the known month names from Greek calendars, hasargued that the similarities visible in Ionian calendars are due to the exis-tence of a commonUrkalendarused by all Ionians in prehistory, beforethe so-called Ionian migration (which Trümpy, not unproblematically,regards as fact).21J. Hall, as part of his ongoing reevaluation of ethnic-ity in Greek antiquity, has recognized the same calendrical similaritiesas Trümpy, but has cast this evidence in a very different light: ‘What isharder to establish is whether these correspondences are due to a com-mon historical inheritance or whether, say, the names of the Athenianmonths have been borrowed from those in use at Miletos ...’22For Hall,the category ‘Ionian’ had little to do with issues of historical and biolog-ical descent. The contingencies of the present were rather more pressingin determining whetheror not a given community self-identified as such.From this perspective, the adoption of month names broadly viewed as‘Ionian’ could be an act of conscious emulation and an attempt to claimmembership for one’s community within a broader identity-based net-work.Individual month names thus communicated significant informationbeyond the month festival celebrated within it, and even seemingly banalalterations to the calendar like changing month names should not betaken lightly. Against this background, I now consider the history of thecalendar traditions of those territories that would come to be adminis-tered by the later Hellenistic Thessalian League, with special focus on thesecond and first centuries. This was a period of intense change and twodevelopments are especially noteworthy. First, it is possible that the citycalendar of Larisa was adopted as the calendar of the Thessalian Leaguein the wake of Flamininus’ reforms; whatever the ultimate source of thecalendar, though, it is very likely that it was part of the constitution whichFlamininus gave to the Thessalians. Second, as the League expanded,21Trümpy , pp. –.22Hall a, pp. –."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"the thessalian calendarsthis calendar was put into use with varying speed by the League’s newmembers, a fact that may suggest that adoption of the common Thes-salian calendar by newly Thessalian territories was not mandated by theLeague. While the use of a common calendar by all of the members ofthe Thessalian League could have played an important role in generatinga common and inclusive Thessalian identity, extended periods of adher-ence to local calendar traditions may indicate that new members of theLeague desired to maintain their local, religious identity alongside theirnew political identity.Building a Regional Thessalian CalendarOver the course of the second century, beginning most likely with theFlamininan reforms of the s, there is inescapable evidence that theoriginal, tetradic membership of the reorganized Thessalian League be-gan to use a common calendar. One can reconstruct the twelve monthsof this calendar and their order on the basis of inscribed manumis-sions and League orpolisdecrees. Synchronisms, usually in Delphianinscriptions, have additionally made it possible to roughly correlate thesemonths with the solar year. The new year for the Thessalian League beganin summer with the month Itonios (equivalent to modern June/Julyor August/September).23Itonios was followed by Panemos (July/Augustor September/October), Themistios (August/September or October/November), Agagulios (September/October or November/December),Apollonios (October/November or December/January), Hermaios (No-vember/December or January/February), Leschanorios (December/Jan-uary or February/March), Aphrios (January/February or March/April),23The variable relationship with the solar year evidenced by, for example, Phyllikos’range of dates as May/June or July/August, is based on a pair of Delphian synchronismsthat give different Delphian equivalents for the same Thessalian month:SGDI, datedto ca. –/, makes Thessalian Thuios correspond to Delphian Endyspoitropios(equivalent to Attic Mounichion, modern April/May), whileFD., , dated to ca. ,makes Thessalian Thuios correspond to Delphian Busios (equivalent to Attic Antheste-rion, modern February/March). The motivation for such a shift is unclear. Samuel ,p. , observes that ‘the most reasonable hypothesis would explain the variant equationsas arising from a lack of permanent accord between the two calendars [Thessalian andDelphian]. The Thessalian calendar must have been entirely independent of the Delphianin the second century bc so that coincidences between months changed over a period ofabout forty years’. Cf.

Every approach must be provisional. Among the pre-Fla-mininan calendars of tetradic Thessaly, only those of Larisa and Pharsa-los can even be partially reconstructed. The months Hippodromios,Panemos, Themistios, and Thuios are known from Larisa;26Dipsios isknown from Pharsalos.27Each of the four months from Larisa is alsoattested in the later League calendar. Such a high degree of correspon-denceindicatesattheveryleastthatthetwocalendarswererelated.GivenLarisa’s prominent position in the political and cultic landscape of theFlamininan Thessalian League, it is even possible that the two calendarswere identical.28Dipsios, however, is attested only at Pharsalos and, curi-ously, on a Linear B tablet from Pylos.29Unlike the Larisan months, itwould have no future in the common calendar of the Flamininan Thes-salian League. Early second-century evidence from Kierion and Skotussaamplifies this picture. At both locations, while the calendar in use broadlyagrees with that of the standard calendar of the Thessalian League, therewas a lingering difference: another month is in use, Iuggios.30The monthis not described as intercalated in either location, and at Skotussa, it24Although the spelling alternates in Thessaly between Thuios and Thuos, I use Thuiosthroughout this chapter.For the alteration, visible already in early epic (\",ωvs.\"υ\u0019ω)seeChantraine , p. .25For the Thessalian months, see Samuel , pp. –; Trümpy , pp. –.

The adoption of the League calendar throughout the regionrequired members of the League to adjust or perhaps even abandontheir earlier calendar traditions, and Flamininus and his advisors mayhave played a mediating role betweenkoinonandpolison this issue.33Ifthe sole purpose of a common calendar was to facilitate administration,however, it is worth noting that several contemporary Greek leagues,when faced with this same problem, made different choices. For example,31Both months probably hosted festivals sacred to Dionysus. For Iuggios, see Hesych.s.v.QΙυγγ\u0019ης, where the word is regarded as synonymous with Dionysus. Cf. Trümpy ,pp. –. For Thuios, see below.32Pouilloux , p. . The Kierion text does not allow for the reconstruction ofeven a partial sequence of months. The order of months in the Skotussa text, which differsradically from that of thekoinoncalendar, can best be attributed to scribal indifference.This same inscription suggests that, in Skotussa at least, the first month of the year wasnot Itonios, but Panemos. It is entirely possible that while the new year began in Itoniosfrom the perspective of thekoinon, the new year in Skotussa, from the perspective of thepolis, officially began in Panemos.33It remains quite likely that, while the template of the regional calendar may havehad its roots in the local calendar of Larisa, many of these months may have been inuse already throughout the region. Given the observed similarities among the calendarsof northwest or Ionian Greece, or, as we will see, among the calendars of PhthioticAchaea and Malis, it would not be surprising if the Archaic and Classical city-calendarsof Thessaly also shared some month names."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" chapter threebeginning in the second century, the West Lokrian League reveals that acommonfederal calendar with neutral, utilitarian, and aggressively secu-lar month names (e.g.,Πρ τ\u000eς‘First’,Δευτ.ρ\u000eς‘Second’,Τρ\u0019τ\u000eς‘Third’)was used alongside the local calendars of the member cities. While theselocal calendars overlap in many cases, the divergence among the city cal-endars as a collective is sufficient to show that they were formally dis-tinct.34Similar federal calendars are attested for the Phokian and Acha-ian Leagues and local calendars continue to appear alongside the federalcalendar for some time in both regions before falling out of use in gen-eral.The example of the West Lokrian, Phokian, and Achaiankoinasug-gests that while there was a clear imperative for federal leagues to oper-ate within a unitary temporal framework, there was at the same time aninterest on the part of member cities in maintaining their local calen-dar traditions. These calendars still mattered, whether for purely prac-tical purposes or more generally to preserve local identity in the face ofregional political pressures. Thessaly is somewhat distinct both in its pref-erence for a regional calendar which had clear associations with cult andin the relatively swift ascendency of this regional calendar over local cal-endars. Such observations lead naturally to an inquiry into the signifi-cance of the months and month-festivals of the Thessalian League calen-dar. What divinities and festivals gained a regional orientation as a resultof this calendar reform?Itonios transparently refers to a festival of the Itonia celebrated inhonor of Athena Itonia, one of the patron deities of the renewed League.Both goddess and festival are well attested in literary and epigraphicsources. In the case of the festival, it is nearly certain that there were bothfederal celebrations of the Itonia held at the Philia sanctuary and localcelebrations elsewhere in the region.35Despite having an exceptionally broad distribution among the calen-dars of the Greek world, Panemos as a month name is morphologicallyheterodox and lacks a satisfactory etymology.36In Thessaly, it was pre-sumably the month of the Panemia, although in this case the festivalname would appear to be derived from the month name—the reverse ofwhat is expected.

It was as Petraios that Poseidonwas most renowned in Thessaly.

Hellyb, pp. –, has recently offered a new etymology of Homole, the mountain fromwhich the settlement Homolion took its name, and hence the month Homoloios. Hellyidentifies Homole as a spur on the southern slopes of Ossa, not the northern as it is oftenregarded, and sees in the word Homole a reference to the topography of the region. It isthat part of southern Ossa ‘which has the same slope’ (‘qui a le meme versant’).64The cult is attested at Boiotian Thebes (IG, ; dated to ca. –) and Eretria(IG., , dated to ca. ), for example, and the month Homoloios is present in thecalendars of the Boiotian League, Aitolian League, Eresos, and Kyme (cf. Trümpy ,pp. –, –, –). If the cult was originally a kind of peak cult localizedat Thessalian Homole, it later became unmoored from its surroundings and spread tolarge areas of north-central Greece and Aeolis in Asia Minor. In this sense, then, and ona much smaller scale, it may be seen to mirror the spread of the cult of Zeus Olympios,which perhaps also began as a peak cult but eventually grew to panhellenic proportions,chiefly through the prestige of Olympia in Elis (cf.

Alacunose passage of Strabo may discuss the cult of Apollo Phyllios atThessalian Phyllos which is possibly associated with the month name.67The god is otherwise unattested in Thessaly in this aspect, however.68To sum up: While there may have been a common, baseline calendartradition to which many of the cities of tetradic Thessaly subscribed, localvariation in the pre-Flamininan and early post-Flamininan period wasmost likely the norm. By the third quarter of the second century, however,a single calendar appears in use throughout tetradic Thessaly, and earlierevidence strongly suggests that much of this calendar was already in placesoon after the Thessalian League’s refoundation in .

The month names ofthis calendar suggest that the governing festival cycle honored divinitiesthat were well known for the most part throughout the region and notspecific to one city or sub-region alone.69It is striking in broader perspec-tive just how pan-Thessalian this calendar appears. Whether the calendarwas directly inherited from the earlier calendar of Larisa or a completelynew creation, it is reasonable to assume that the decision to use this cal-endar was influenced by Flamininus and his advisors, if not directly madeby them.

Hadromios may suggest that a festival with a race ofsome sort took place at that time, while Euonios and Hagnaios are almostcompletely opaque.72A series of manumissions from the first and secondcentury ce suggests that the full calendar of the Thessalian League wasthen in use: Apollonios, Aphrios, Phyllikos, Agagulios and Leschanoriosare all newly attested; Homoloios and Thuios continue from before; nomonths not attested in the League calendar are known at that time. It isreasonable to conclude that Phthiotic Thebes was using the calendar ofthe Thessalian League during the first century ce.The impression given by other cities in Phthiotic Achaia, though frag-mentary, fits the pattern of Phthiotic Thebes.

Lykeos probably andApellaios certainly are associated with Apollo. Riddling Geustos is sharedwith Lamia. The Boukatia of Boukatios are perhaps to be associated witha Bouphonia-type festival.

But such evidence is consistent with the paradigm of PhthioticThebes, and it is more likely that Echinos too maintained a calendar inde-pendent of the Thessalian League into the first century and adopted theLeague calendar only during the Roman period.To sum up: Malis and Achaia Phthiotis were the earliest territories tobe incorporated into the Thessalian League. Neither region appears tohave had a regional calendar tradition. Rather, independent, local cal-endars were the norm. Their political and territorial incorporation intothe Thessalian League did not immediately extend to the calendar in use.The best known calendars from these regions, Melitaia, Lamia, Echinos,and, above all, Phthiotic Thebes, share a number of significant charac-teristics.

Second, in the Roman era, only months shared with the Thes-salian League calendar are in use. The clear implication is that the calen-dar of the Thessalian League had been adopted by that time.The evidence assembled above admits of two possible reconstructionsof the transition between local and regional calendar. Since all Malianand Phthiotic Achaian calendars known in any detail from the secondand first century share an often significant portion of their months withthe Thessalian League, it is possible that this situation represents anintermediate stage in a gradual period of transition from what had beenwholly independent local calendars in, for example, the third century,to a single regional calendar in complete conformity with that of thegoverning political structure in, for example, the first century ce. But itis equally possible that there was already considerable overlap among thecalendars of tetradic Thessaly, Malis, and Achaia Phthiotis in some earlierhistorical period, and that at some point in the late first century, perhapsatthetimeofthecreationoftheprovinceofAchaia,theremainingmonthsoftheLeaguecalendarwereputintouseinthosepreviouslyperioikic territories. The second of these two alternatives is on balancemore likely given the extent to which different regions in the Greek worldshare month names; whether this is due to conscious emulation or toprehistoric migrations, it is in any case clear that the calendar of theThessalian League was not actively in use at the local level in a largeterritory politically administered by the League during the second andfirst centuries. Such a finding in turn suggests either that the League didnot impose the federal calendar upon newly ‘Thessalian’ states or thatit was completely unsuccessful in doing so. If the genesis of a regionalThessalian calendar in the aftermath of the Second Macedonian Warhad opened up the possibility for entwining the political and religiousidentities of the member cities of the League, the Malians and PhthioticAchaians can be seen to have rejected this possible outcome and to haveretained their local calendars.Next in chronological order after Achaia Phthiotis and Malis in termsof its incorporation into the Thessalian League is Perrhaibia. Freed byFlamininus in , the Perrhaibians appear to have been organized as afederalleaguesoonthereafter,mostlikelybyFlamininus;theleague’ssub-sequent history was difficult, marked by later Macedonian and Romaninvasions.

Such use was perhaps a reflection of the territory’s moreformal constitution as a league after , which in turn may reflect thestrength of earlier traditions of regional government. Also unlike theMalians and Phthiotic Achaians, evidence strongly suggests that the Per-rhaibians adopted the calendar of the Thessalian League soon after theirincorporation into thatkoinon.The use of a common Perrhaibian calendar in the first half of the sec-ond century is indicated by an inscription which records the settlementof a boundary dispute between the cities of Mondaia and Azoros. Thebeginning of the inscription reads: ‘When Hippolochos son of Alexipposof Larisa was general of the Thessalians for the second time, on the thirti-eth of Themistios as the Thessalians reckon, and when Demetrios son ofDemainetos of Gonnoi was general of the Perrhaibians, on the thirtiethof Dios as the Perrhaibians reckon ...’86The language of the inscriptionmentions the Perrhaibian and Thessalian institutions of the eponymousstrategosand regional calendar in tandem, suggesting that the Perrhaib-ians, like the Thessalians, were organized as a league with a common cal-endar which, on the Thessalian model, member cities presumably madeuse of for official purposes.In addition to Dios, a series of months is attested in a variety of Per-rhaibian cities during the time of the independent Perrhaibian League:Artemisios, Dithyrambios, Poesios, Xandikos, Hyperoios.87While themonth Daisios, attested at Gonnoi in a late third-century inscription,does not technically belong to the independent Perrhaibian League, thelarge number of Macedonian months attested in independent Perrhaibia85See Chapter One.86IG.2.,  (SIG3), l. –, from Corcyra, dated to ca. : [στραταγ\u000e]\u000fντ\u000eςΘεσσαλ ν|[μ\u0015ν 8Ιππ\u000e]λ#)\u000eυ τ\u000e\u000f QΑλε\u001f\u0019ππ\u000eυ|[τ4 δε,τ]ερ\u000eν Λαρισα\u0019\u000eυ,μην4ς|[HςΘε]σσαλ\u000e dγ\u000eντι Θεμιστ\u0019\u000eυ,|[sμ.ρ]αι τριακ\u001eδι,Περραι\u0018 ν δ\u0015 στρα|[ταγ\u000e]\u000fντ\u000eςΔημητρ\u0019\u000eυ τ\u000e\u000f Δημαιν.|τ\u000eυ Γ]\u000eνν.ως,μην4ς κα\"aς Περραι\u0018\u000e|[dγ\u000e].ντι Δ\u0019\u000eυ,sμ.-ραι τριακ\u001eδι.87Artemisios: e.g., Arvanitopoulos , pp. –, no.  (McDevitt , p. ,no. ), from Chyretiai, dated to ca. –.

Ifthere is any outside influence visible here, it is rather from Macedoniato the north. Artemisios, Dios, Daisios, and Xanthikos (surely relatedto Perrhaibian Xandikos)89are all known from the Macedonian calen-dar: Artemisios clearly reflects an Artemisia, Dios perhaps a festival inhonor of Zeus, and Xandikos was likely the month of the Xandika, whichincluded a purification ceremony for the Macedonian army.

While the perioikic south continued to maintaintheir local calendars, the perioikic north appears to have assimilatedrather quickly to the new temporal community of the Thessalian League.From the host of possible explanations that present themselves, twoare especially attractive. First, the Thessalian League’s political centerof gravity was unquestionably Larisa at this time, and Larisa seems tohave enjoyed a traditional hegemonic relationship over Perrhaibia inthe Classical period.93Although the Perrhaibians were now politicallyThessalians and hence notionally equal to the other members of theLeague, perhaps the dynamics of the earlier, dependent phase of therelationship reasserted themselves here. Second, Perrhaibia’s proximityto Macedonia and the Macedonian flavor of the calendar(s) in use mayhave had some ambiguous resonances that the Perrhaibians wished toavoid. What is certain, amidst this speculation, is that Perrhaibia presentsanother model of calendar adoption, antithetical to that of the PhthioticAchaians and Malians.The evidence in the remaining territories is very thin indeed. Nocommon calendar of the Dolopians is known, but months shared withthe Thessalian calendar may be in use there as early as the secondcentury.94The Oitaians are known to have used a common calendar inthe second century, and a single month, Apellaios, is known from it.95A mysterious month name from second-century Herakleia Trachinia isknown, Eatos.96The calendar of Herakleia was possibly identical withthat of the Oitaians. Neither Dolopia nor Oitaia have furnished evidencefor the calendar in use during later periods. Finally, several monthsare known from the second-century calendar of Hypata in Ainis.97TheHypatan calendar may also have been identical with that of the Ainianes.An imperial-era inscription makes use of a Thessalian month and itis likely that the Thessalian calendar was in use in Ainis following theregion’s entrance into the Thessalian League.9893See Chapter One.94IG., , a manumission from Ekkara (?) or Angeiai (?), mentions Thuios andPhyllikos.95SGDI.96SGDI.97SGDI, Artemitios and Arno[–], of uncertain significance.98IG., : Themistios."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"chapter threeConclusionThis chapter has describeed two stages in the geographical expansion ofthe calendar of the Thessalian League: the first stage is represented by theadoption of a common regional calendar throughout tetradic Thessalysoon after the refoundation of the League in ; the second stage ismarked by the spread of this regional calendar into the territories of newmembers of the Thessalian League: Perrhaibia, Achaia Phthiotis, Malis,Oitaia, Ainis, and Dolopia. I have demonstrated that the geographicalexpansion of the Thessalian League and that of the calendar of theThessalian League were not chronologically coterminous.While the first,tetradic stageseems to have been accomplished with little difficulty, someevidence for local calendrical idiosyncracies persists decades after theLeague’s refoundation. Outside of the tetrads, we find a broad rangeof responses to the Thessalian calendar. In Perrhaibian Pythion thereis compelling evidence for use of the Thessalian calendar shortly afterthe putative incorporation of Perrhaibia into the Thessalian League. Thecases of Phthiotic Thebes, Melitaia, Lamia and Echinos in the territoriesof Malis and Achaia Phthiotis to the south could not be more distinct.There we find local calendars still in use a century or more after theirpolitical incorporation into the Thessalian League. It is not until theRoman period that the Thessalian calendar is fully in use there.This regional Thessalian calendar had a foundation in the regionalreligion of the tetrads, which on occasion was shared with some of theformerperioikoi. While there is no evidence that new month festivalswere widely celebrated in newly Thessalian territory (or celebrated atall—an objection which, we must admit, can be made of the tetrads aswell), one must assume that the popular experience of time had beenaffected by this transition. Given the interpretive framework sketchedat the beginning of this chapter, we may conclude that there was rathermore at stake in the longstanding rejection of this regional calendarby the Phthiotic Achaians and Malians, or its speedy acceptance by thePerrhaibians.

The preceding two chapters have traced therelationship between cult and the establishment of a regional Thessalianpolitical identity in the second and first centuries from the perspectiveof both the two major federal sanctuaries of the Thessalian League andthe League’s common calendar. The picture that has emerged thus farhas been varied, with cult now reinforcing Thessalian political identity(particularlyinthecaseoftheLeaguesanctuaries),nowperhapsoffer-ing an alternative to it (particularly in the case of the local calendars).The present chapter looks at the same set of issues from the perspectiveof international religion, for major international sanctuaries offered animportant supplement to domestic venues for the cultic expression ofpolitical identity. Membership in amphictionies and sendingtheoroitosanctuaries of this type were two of the chief ways in which Greek statesbecame entwined in a network of international religion in antiquity, andin the following pages, I will consider the travels of Thessalian partic-ipation in such a system.6I begin with Thessalian interests in the Del-phic Amphictiony before shifting to consider the travels of Thessaliantheoroibeyond Delphi.

While thevery etymology of the word remains in doubt, the attested amphic-tionies seem to have been constituted by several communities whichshared in the administration of a common sanctuary.8Most famousamong these and by far the best attested is the Pylaio-Delphic Amph-ictiony (henceforth referred to as ‘the Delphic Amphictiony’ or simply‘the Amphictiony’), an association of several communities charged withthe administration of the sanctuary of Demeter Amphictionis at Anthela(or ‘Pylaia’) and that of Apollo Pythios at Delphi.9It is possible that theranks of the ‘original’ Amphictiony were filled byethnesurrounding theAnthela sanctuary, and that by  when the Pythia was reorganizedas a penteteric festival under Amphictionic administration, this Amph-ictiony expanded to include the Delphian sanctuary and accordingly7The comparative weakness of earlier incarnations of the Thessalian League, orindeed, its complete absence—as is often suspected for the third century (cf. Polyb...)—may be partially responsible for this image.8Etymology: Hall , pp. –, with further bibliography; for a general over-view of amphictionies and salutary discussion of their functions, see Tausend , pp. –, esp. –.9Hence the cumbrous moniker ‘Pylaio-Delphic’."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" chapter fourincorporatedethnein the neighborhood of Delphi into its membership.10Such a reconstruction is likely enough, but stands far short of constitut-ing a history of the Amphictiony. This can only begin in earnest in thefourth century when our literary sources begin to provide details aboutAmphictionic membership and the epigraphic record begins to illumi-nate Amphictionic prerogatives.11This fourth-century Amphictiony was made up of twelveethneofnorthern and central Greece and onepolis;thesemembershadtheprivi-lege to send representatives, known in Amphictionic parlance ashierom-nemonesor ‘sacred remembrancers’, to semiannual meetings that tookplace in the autumn and the spring, with each meeting including sessionsat both Anthela and Delphi.

See Lefèvre ,pp. – and Sánchez , p. . As a result, the Oitaians appear to have lacked formalrecognition at Delphi as an independent Amphictionicethnosat this time, despite beingwell within the Amphictionic orbit. The Oitaian position within the Amphictiony wasthus mediated via their capital city of Herakleia, and this overall arrangement has more incommon with the hybrid Ionian or Dorian membership on the Amphictiony (see below)than that of the northernethne.14The East Lokrians sent onehieromnemon, and the West Lokrians the other.15Athens dispatched one Ionianhieromnemon, the cities of Euboia the other.16The metropolitan Dorians, viz., Dorians who lived in the territory of Doris in centralGreece, dispatched one Dorianhieromnemon; Dorians of the Peloponnese appointed theother.17Cf. the overview of memberethnein Lefèvre , pp. –."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"international religionnemonesby lot.18Alongside thesehieromnemones, our sources occasion-ally mention other officials, also dispatched by memberethne,knownaspylagoroi,19a title which seems to mean ‘those who speak at thePylaia’, who may have possessed special judicial and political exper-tise;20their numbers varied from session to session. Since so many ofthe memberethneof the Amphictiony were within the political ambitof tetradic Thessaly over the course of the Archaic and Classical period(Perrhaibia, Magnesia, Phthiotic Achaia, Dolopia, Malis, Ainis), it is pos-sible that the Thessalians exercised an influence within the Amphic-tiony which exceeded their formal representation by twohieromnemones.Thessalians are certainly important in Amphictionic mythology, and onenotes as well that Thessalianhieromnemonesare traditionally set at thehead of the lists ofhieromnemoneswhich often accompany Amphictionicdecrees.One might assume that alterations to this geographic arrangement ofhieromnemonesandpylagoroiwere regarded as anathema to tradition,but the historical record indicates that change was regular. Some schol-ars have suggested not implausibly that the fourth-century list describedabove was the product of considerable evolution,21and changes in mem-bership are attested as beginning at the conclusion of the so-called ThirdSacred War in . At this time, the Phokian right to send twohierom-nemoneswas stripped from them and awarded to the Macedonian kingPhilip II and his successors.22The Aitolians would in turn over the18Lefèvre .

Further transformations were to take place in the sec-ond and first centuries that will be discussed in some detail below.At their semiannual meetings, thehieromnemonespossessed from thefourth century onwards a relatively stable core of prerogatives:25man-agement and protection of the territories administered by the sanctuariesat Anthela and Delphi; maintenance and upkeep of monuments in bothsanctuaries; organization and oversight of the festival market, especiallyat Anthela; honoring Demeter at Anthela and Apollo at Delphi, togetherwith the other divinities who received cult in the two sanctuaries; andadministration of major festivals conducted therein, especially the pen-teteric Pythia. The legislative and judicial functions of the Amphictiony,and the processes by which laws were passed and judgments enacted, aremore nebulous by contrast.

There were presentalready in the fifth century the beginnings of a trend which would laterintensify, especially in the later Hellenistic and Roman periods—theglorification and idealization of this work as not simply synonymouswith panhellenism in practice, but indeed among the highest heightsattainable by Greeks working together.26In contrast to the actual, hardpower exercised by the Amphictions in matters of cult, market, and23The correlation between the territorial expansion of the Aitolian League and thegrowing number of Aitolianhieromnemoneswithin the Amphictiony was first observedat Beloch , a fundamental study.

Modern scholarship recognizes four ‘sacred wars’ fought overthe course of the Archaic and Classical periods that impacted the con-trol and administration of the sanctuary of Pythian Apollo at Delphi.28The First, about which there was little agreement in antiquity and noconsensus today, may have arisen from an initially localized conflictbetween Delphi and Krisa/Kirrha over access to the sanctuary and con-trol of its possessions and territory. Different sources present a host ofdifferent allies for the Delphian cause, and the end result of the con-flict was the destruction of Krisa/Kirrha, perhaps in the first decades ofthe sixth century, and the introduction, perhaps solidification, of Amph-ictionic control over the sanctuary.29The Second, meagerly attested,took place ca.  during the so-called First Peloponnesian War, whena Spartan army is alleged to have gained control of the sanctuary andhanded it over to the Delphians. A Spartan retreat was followed byan Athenian advance, and the sanctuary was subsequently returned tothe Phokians.30The Third, the ‘mother’ of all sacred wars, is of some-what uncertain chronology but probably dates ca. –. It witnessedPhilip II, king of Macedon, entering into a dispute between the Amph-ictions and the Phokians. The latter had seized control of the sanc-tuary and were spending liberally from its treasures. Philip took theside of the Amphictions, subsequently defeated the Phokians in bat-tle, and won for himself representation on the Amphictiony (again attheexpenseofthePhokians,whowereexcludedfromthecouncilas27Cf.

Apollo offered no shortage of pretexts, and in thecontext of broader Greek or Mediterranean power struggles, the Amph-ictiony was rarely, if ever, the most influential voice in defining Apollo’sinterests.When the dust had settled (and, often enough, before), the Amphic-tiony could be utilized by the victors to justify and legitimate the out-come of such conflicts. This is most explicit during Delphi’s Aitoliancentury, from roughly the s to , when the Aitolian League pro-jected its proto-hegemony over central Greece through traditional andnovel forms of cult at Delphi and by dominating Amphictionic mem-bership. The presence of Philip II within the Amphictiony too had previ-ously made Macedonian territorial acquisitions in northernGreece morepalatable to the major powers of central and southern Greece.39And ifthe fact of Roman predominance on the Greek mainland was alreadywell established by the time of Augustus’ accession, it is also true thathis victory in the Roman civil wars marked a distinct stage in the formal-ization of Roman control over Greek territory—the creation of a provin-cial order south of Macedonia. The Amphictiony again played a centrallegitimizing role for this new arrangement as Augustus’ city foundationat Nikopolis, which commemorated his victory at Actium, was receivedwithin the Amphictiony and awarded ten positions on the council.40Thecircumstances of the Aitolian, Macedonian, and Roman acquisitions ofinfluence within the Amphictiony may differ in individual details, butthis should not obscure their essential similarities. In each case, monu-mental political re-ordering on the Greek mainland was accompanied byre-ordering within the Amphictiony.The preceding background sketch helps to contextualize the eventsof the s and s, when the political and military fault lines divid-ing Aitolia, Macedonia, and Rome extended throughout much of cen-tral and northern Greece. While Glabrio and Aemilius Paullus tend toreceive the most credit for ending Aitolian and Macedonian hopes forhegemony over central Greece, it was the Flamininan settlement in thecultivating the sacred plain of Apollo at Kirrha is occasionally referred to as a ‘Fifth SacredWar’ in modern scholarship; cf.

Over the course of the first half of the secondcentury, the Amphictiony would come to mirror this territorial trans-formation in its membership. At the conclusion of the Roman War withAntiochus (Syrian War) in , the Amphictiony returned to its mem-bership ca. ; after the ultimate battle of the Third Macedonian War atPydna in , the membership would resemble quite closely that of thepre-Third Sacred War Amphictiony.Roman ‘Sacred Wars’Although the Second Macedonian War did not have an immediate, dra-matic impact on the Amphictiony, it prepared the ground for subsequenttransformation of that institution. Aitolia remained a Roman ally afterPhilip V’s defeat at Kynoskephalai in , albeit increasingly disgruntled,and continued to control the Amphictiony. Aitolian control of Phokisseems to have been formally sanctioned by Rome after  and Aito-lian representation on the Amphictiony increased as a result from ninevotes to eleven.41By , however, disenchantment with the Flamininansettlement had led the Aitolians to break with Rome and ally with Anti-ochus III, king of the Seleucid kingdom. A war with Rome soon followedwhich resulted in the defeat of the Aitolo-Seleucid alliance. The event hadparticularly grave consequences for Aitolian territorial holdings and, byextension, their supremacy within the Amphictiony. The most impor-tant Roman general during the war, M’. Acilius Glabrio, wintered inPhokis in /, by which time the eventual defeat of the Aitolians andSeleucids was no longer in doubt. He busied himself not simply with41Polyb. ..;CID, ."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"international religionplanning for the spring campaign, but also with specifically Delphianissues. All could see that an Aitolian defeat would result in a vacuumin authority at Delphi and within the Amphictiony.Initially, citizens of Delphi seem to have won the most influence withGlabrio. Plutarch could regard the Roman general as a friend of Delphion a par with Flamininus and Aemilius Paullus, and with good reason.42An important letter of Glabrio’s was published in the sanctuary and indi-cates that he confiscated Aitolian-held properties in the neighborhood ofDelphi and returned them to thepolisand ‘the god’. The same monumentreveals that Glabrio had dealt with an initial wave of legal challenges tothese confiscations, and that he had instructed the Delphians to set upa court to arbitrate anticipated future disputes.43The work represents aconcrete first step in undoing nearly a century of Aitolian influence inthe region, and would have provided sufficient reason for the Delphiansto honor their newest benefactor with a monumental statue.44There was more. The Delphians may have sensed an opportunity toreduce the power not simply of Aitolia, but of the Amphictiony with-in which the Aitolians had wielded so much power. Glabrio’s letter42Plut.Sull..–. Flamininus had dedicated his long shield, silver bucklers, and agold crown at Delphi after his victory at Kynoskephalai (Plut.Flam. .–). Cf.

Clearly theDelphians imagine that the Thessalians will attempt to reassert them-selves within the Amphictiony and to resume their traditional posi-tion of influence within that body. Such fears were legitimate. The Aito-lians had used the Amphictiony as a way to control and dominate localDelphian politics, and so the Delphians were in no mood to exchangeone master for another. It is possible, perhaps likely, that Glabrio hadalready received at Delphi that winter a Thessalian delegation claimingas much; and it was certainly no stretch for Glabrio or the Delphiansto imagine Thessalian envoys at Rome debating Amphictionic preroga-tives before the Senate. Doubtless other Amphictionic voices were heardas well at this time, and the Amphictiony may even have dedicated theirown honorary statue for Glabrio within the sanctuary.46But Glabrio’s let-ter reflects the ambition of Delphi to curtail not simply the expansiveusewhichtheAitoliansmadeoftheAmphictionybuteventhecustom-ary Amphictionic functions of sanctuary and festival management.47Bydefault the Syrian War had become a kind of Sacred War, and Rome itsarbiter.The initial victor would appear to have been Delphi, and indeed theDelphians promptly sent an embassy to Rome to gain official Senatorialconfirmation of Glabrio’sad hocarrangements.

As in Glabrio’s letter,while the overall target is the Amphictiony, one can distinguish betweenthe relationship of this institution with thepolisof Delphi in periodsof relative normalcy and during the recent Aitolian domination.49Theclause guaranteeing Delphian autonomy clearly targeted the Aitolian-dominated Amphictiony, but Delphian control of the sacredchoraandharbor would have intruded upon the traditional prerogatives of theAmphictiony, and thus the phrase ‘from the beginning’ may appeal toa status quo before the Amphictiony began its administration of the Del-phian sanctuary, conventionally about the time of the First Sacred War.50Such concessions at a time of institutional instability and transition musthave severely threatened the finances of the Amphictiony and presagedthe institution’s rapid decline at Delphi.5148FD.,  A, l. –; B, l. –.

The initial Delphian embassy which secured the con-cessions mentioned in Postumius’ letter had been murdered while returning to Delphiand the letter lost; the event forced the Delphians to send a subsequent embassy tosecure (again) confirmation of Glabrio’sad hocarrangements, and much else besides(e.g., M. Fulvius Nobilior (cos. ), then pursuing a siege of Same, was, upon its com-pletion, directed to investigate the murder of the Delphian envoys; the Aitolians wereordered to stop removing property from Delphi, and to return what they had taken;and the Delphians were further encouraged to remove undesirables from their town andchora).49Rousset , pp. –, adds an important, additional layer of context. This newdispensation of authority effectively secured Delphian access to the sea and offered it amore formal boundary with Aitolian-controlled Lokris to the west; and to Rome, theactions of the Amphictiony, within which Aitolian proxies were still numerous, probablyseemed much less predictable than those of the city of Delphi.50Lefèvre , p. .

In / the Amph-ictiony could honor a Thessalianhieromnemon, Nikostratos of Larisa, fordisplaying great energy in helping to return the Amphictiony to its pri-mordial condition; for ensuring that the Pythia of / was conductedappropriately; and for undertaking an embassy to Rome where he spokebeforetheSenateonAmphictionicbusiness.52The embassy to Rome can-not be disentangled from the restoration of the Amphictiony to its ‘orig-inal’ condition, and on his return to Greece, Nikostratos addressed theDelphians about Rome’s decisions and cryptically ‘invited the Delphiansto preserve their goodwill towards all the Greeks and not to do anythingcounter to the previous resolutions of the Greeks’.53Nikostratos’ embassyto Rome will certainly have won sanction for this organization of theAmphictiony, and the tone of the decree suggests that such an arrange-ment was counter to the wishes of the Delphians.What did Nikostratos’ Amphictiony look like? What were its preroga-tives? The earliest evidence is an Amphictionic decree of  which setsaside certain areas of Apollo’shiera chorafor grazing by Apollo’s sacredcattle and horses.54The Senate had previously awarded oversight of sanc-tuary territory to the city of Delphi, but this decree shows the Amph-ictions comfortably exercising power in this domain.55One may inferthat Nikostratos’ mission to Rome was at least partially concerned withthe restoration of this Amphictionic privilege, and if Nikostratos hadsecured concessions from Rome regarding Amphictionic management ofthe sanctuary’s territorial holdings, he may very well have won in addi-tion the reinstatement of Amphictionic management of, and access todues from, Delphi’s sacred harbor. The matter of membership is moreclear. The ‘traditional’ Amphictiony on display in this decree is at leastpartially that of ca.  vintage, after Philip II’s successful prosecutionoftheThirdSacredWar:twohieromnemonesfrom the Macedonian kingand votes’ (the text is fragmentary; cf.CID ad loc.).

Delphian fears in  about Thessalianintervention at Rome on behalf of the Amphictiony had been well-founded. Macedonian, Aitolian, and Thessalian factions seem to havebeen somewhat evenly balanced in the Amphictiony in , however, andthere is no evidence that Nikostratos’ mission impacted Delphi’s auton-omy as apolis.61This last point was very likely the most critical complaint56Cf.

The ‘Malians’ send one hierom-nemon, as do the ‘Herakleians’. Later Amphictionic lists use the ethnic ‘Oitaians’. TheHerakleian-Oitaian contingent in  belongs in a slightly different category than thoseof the Ainianes, Lokrians, or Dolopians. Herakleia was still a member of the AitolianLeague in , and itshieromnemon, Phaineas son of Nikias, unlike those of the Ainianesand the Lokrians, did not come from the Aitolian heartland, but from an elite Ainian fam-ily based in Sosthenis.

The net result for Delphi may have beena virtual return to the Amphictiony of Philip II and Alexander in bothmembership and priorities, and while short of what they had temporarilyattained from Glabrio and Spurius Postumius, this was a certain improve-ment over the Aitolian-era Amphictiony. If the order of Amphictionicethnein the  list is any indication, the Delphianhieromnemonesmayhave attained through these negotiations a temporary position of greaterprestige within the Amphictiony. The Delphians are listed first in thedecree, the Thessalians second, and in official Amphictionic documentsof the later Hellenistic period, Delphians and Thessalians seem to alter-nate between first and second position. In the fourth-century Amphic-tiony, it is the Thessalians who invariably appear first in these lists ofhieromnemones, with the Delphians usually appearing third, after therepresentatives of the Macedonian king.But the Pandora’s Box opened by Glabrio cannot be considered closedby . The Macedonian king Perseus, much like his father Philip V,had made Delphi a centerpiece of Macedonian policy in central andsouthernGreece and he dexterously exploited the sanctuary to maximizehis influence in those regions.62We have already considered in ChapterTwo Perseus’ publication of notices of debt-amnesty for Macedonianexiles at Delphi, Delos, and a sanctuary of Athena Itonia. Accordingto Polybius, the gesture was designed to win favor among mainlandand Aegean Greeks, and to this end it may be considered a success.63Perseus dedicated several large pillar monuments at Delphi in the sintended to advertise his munificence, and perhaps that of Macedoniamore broadly.64Rather more spectacular and potentially threatening toRome was Perseus’ combination of a military mission in Dolopia65with62Cf. Miller , pp. –.63Polyb. ..–.64Plut.Aem. Paul. . mentions an unfinished monument designed to hold a goldequestrian statue. Polyb. ..– and Liv. .. mention several pillars.

Another seems to have been used by Perseus to (re)publish documentsadvertising a tendentious, pro-Macedonian version of earlier Delphian history (for theinscription, seeCID, ).

Livy .. has Perseus claim"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"international religiona visit to Delphi in , both to offer sacrifice in fulfillment of a vowand to consult the oracle.66The inescapable symbolism of the gesturewas balanced with a practical, demonstrative purpose: Macedonia underPerseus’ leadership was part of the broader religious community of main-land Greece and, at a time of contracting Aitolian influence, his presenceat Delphi with an army offered a none-too-subtle reminder of the con-tinuing power of the Macedonian state. At a closed-door meeting of theRoman Senate in , the Attalid king Eumenes could list Perseus’ armedtheoriato Delphi among other indicators of the Macedonian king’s men-acing intentions.67Such testimony prompted Rome to send a letter toDelphi that detailed the threatening behavior of Perseus and was pub-lished within the sanctuary of Apollo.68Delphi thus emerged as a symbolic front in the buildup to the ThirdMacedonian War and Rome seems to have deployed ‘sacred war’ rhetoric.Although the major campaigning took place further north, it is not sur-prising that Aemilius Paullus visited Delphi soon after his victory atPydna in . While there, he converted one of Perseus’ dedications inthe sanctuary into a monument commemorating Perseus’ defeat. Thepost-war settlement of Macedonia by Rome terminated for good theAntigonid kingship and divided the traditional territory of Macedoniainto four separately administered republics. Amphictionic membershipwas adjusted accordingly.

TraditionalAmphictionic prerogatives squared with traditional Amphictionic mem-bership. A pre-Third Sacred War status quo had been reached.Thessalian VariationsAs the Amphictiony developed throughout the first half of the sec-ond century and reacquired its original contours—contours that wereremarkably in keeping with the spirit, if not the letter, of the Flamininanterritorial reorganization of central and northern Greece—the characterof that Flamininan reorganization had itself begun to shift. As discussedin Chapter One, Rome seems to have supported the peaceful territorialexpansion of the Thessalian League. Achaia Phthiotis entered the Leaguealready in the s, and Malis followed in the s; Perrhaibia joinedin the s, as perhaps did Oitaia. The conservatism of the Flamininansettlementwasthusephemeral,whilethatoftheAmphictionywascon-siderably less so.In the case of the Thessaloitout court, the honorary decree for Nikos-tratos70makes it clear that the Thessalian League had selected him ashieromnemon. Other Amphictionicethnethat were politically consti-tuted as independentkoinaalso most probably selected their ownhieromnemonesin a similar fashion. But when the Phthiotic Achaiansand Malians joined the Thessalian League, they continued to enjoy inde-pendentethnosrepresentation within the Amphictiony.

There thus arises a gap at Delphi betweenAmphictionic Thessaloi and the expanding Thessalian League. In thefinal analysis, however, such a gap may have been only apparent. Thosewho had access to positions of power within the Thessalian League werefor the most part residents of tetradic Thessaly—Thessaloi from the per-spective of the Amphictiony. It was not until the Imperial period that res-idents of the previously perioikic territories of Perrhaibia or Ainis found70CID, ."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"international religionthemselves holding high office within the Thessalian League. For thesecond and first centuries, the Thessaloi and the Thessalian League arecoterminous categories not simply from an Amphictionic perspective butalso as practical political reality.Subsequent Amphictionic lists suggest that the Thessaloi usurped onoccasion the rights of neighboringethneto sendpylagoroito meetingsof the Amphictionic council. A substantial if fragmentary dossier datedto the last quarter of the second century details a messy dispute betweenrival factions within thepolisof Delphi over mismanagement of sanctu-ary possessions.The Roman senate, the proconsul of Macedonia, and theAmphictiony each became involved, and a varied record of their interac-tions was inscribed on the orthostates of the temple of Apollo within thesanctuary.71There is a list of the members of the Amphictionic council inattendance, and quite exceptionally this list includes not just the namesof the expected twenty-fourhieromnemones,butalsothoseofforty-eightother individuals, who can only bepylagoroi.Intwocasesitisclearthatresidents of tetradic Thessaly were serving aspylagoroiforethnewhoseterritories formally belonged to the Thessalian League, but which contin-ued to send their ownhieromnemones: two citizens of Gyrton served aspylagoroifor ahieromnemonfrom Phthiotic Thebes in Phthiotic Achaia;andacitizenofPheraiservedaspylagorosfor ahieromnemonfrom Per-rhaibia.72Athens offers relatively certain evidence thathieromnemonesandpylagoroifrom that city at least were appointed by distinct meth-ods.

Northern Magnesia, according to Kip, may have united with Perrhaibia andthe region as a whole would be known from an Amphictionic perspective as ‘ThessalianMagnesia’. While the now broadly accepted hypothesis of Kramolisch  concerningthe end of the Perrhaibian League (cf. Chapter One) obviates some of Kip’s argument,the recognition that the curious bifurcation of Magnesia attested atCID,  mayhave had a domestic, Magnesian basis, did advance scholarly understanding of thepossible political implications of this (still only clerical) event. In particular, Kip adducedIG., a, an honorary decree for Demetrios, son of Aitolion, from Demetrias, ageneral of the Magnesian League. The inscription details a period of faction borderingonstasisthroughout the region that Demetrios managed to quell; the cities of Magnesiawere thus put into a state of concord. Letter forms broadly suggest a second-centurydate for this decree. There are unfortunately no details in the inscription which can bemore closely located in a political context. The relevance of the decree for our purposesconsists in the contentious image of Magnesia which it presents.

Thecurrent state of evidence does not allow a clear answer, but a plausi-ble case can be made for individual announcements of the festival ineach of the communities listed, and likely in many others besides.81Itis another question whether every city whosetheorodokoiare listed insuch catalogues sent festival-attendingtheoroiof their own to the fes-tival that had been announced. A recent comparison of coinage recov-ered during the Nemea excavations with the Nemeantheorodokoicata-logue sheds some light on the problem: ‘When the geography of thesetheorodokoiis plotted on a map and compared with the provenience ofcoins found from afar at Nemea, there is a striking correlation: eventhough distant mints are often represented by a single coin in the finds,in  of  cases in which a town known to mint bronze during theth century bc is represented in thetheorodokoilists, a coin turns upat Nemea’.82Similar analyses have not been conducted for other sanctu-aries that have producedtheorodokoicatalogues, but if the Nemea pat-tern holds, and there is no reason to suspect that it is somehow excep-tional, then it is quite likely that a majority of the cities listed in thetheo-rodokoicatalogues sent festival-attendingtheoroi.

Over the course of the Hellenistic period, however, a newset of international festivals developed which added greater complexityto these established theoric networks. In some cases, completely new fes-tivals were established; in others, older, local festivals were upgraded sothat they might acquire prestige equivalent to that enjoyed by the ‘bigfour’ festivals of the mainland at Nemea, Isthmia, Delphi, and Olympia.97Motives varied. R. Parker has observed that the new or expanded fes-tivals belonged largely to the eastern Greek world, and may reflect thebroader re-centering of political and cultural power characteristic of theHellenistic period.98J. Ma has usefully applied the concept of ‘peer polityinteraction’ to the evidence, suggestingthat thedevelopment of thesefes-tivals and their announcement throughout the Mediterranean world bytheoroiwere part ‘of a mesh of strong horizontal connections of collab-oration, assertion and recognition [among cities] ... eminently desirable... in a world of powerful vertical pressures tending toward integrationand subordination’.99Local conditions also need to be accounted for.100Evidence for these festivals is again distinct from that of either thetheo-rodokoicatalogues or the Gonnoi decrees which appoint local and honorforeigntheorodokoi, and make provisions for the departure of localtheo-roito foreign festivals. Nevertheless,the image of Thessaly as a collectionofpoleisis maintained, although there are occasional intrusions of anethnosdiscourse.Inthefirsthalfofthethirdcentury,thepolisof Kos began to enlargeand improve its famous sanctuary of Asklepios. Such architectural embel-lishment assumed a festival dimension in , when the Koans cele-brated the first penteteric Greater Asklepieia. There had probably pre-viously been an annual festival honoring the god which attracted a pre-dominantly local audience.101These local Asklepieia may then have been97For a conspectus of these festivals, cf.

In prepara-tion, Kos had dispatched festival-announcingtheoroithe previous yearin  asking a range of Hellenistic cities, leagues, and monarchs toacceptthenewfestivalandtorecognizetheinviolabilityofthesanctuaryand occasionally of those who travelled there to participate. An archiveof several dozen affirmative responses to this mission has been recov-ered from the Koan sanctuary of Asklepios. This group of stelae con-stitutes the earliest such archive of festival acceptances known from theHellenistic world. Several decrees from Thessaly are numbered amongthem: Gonnoi in Perrhaibia, Homolion in Magnesia, Phthiotic Thebesin Phthiotic Achaia,102each of which is in koine, and two other veryfragmentary inscriptions in Thessalian dialect from unspecified, pre-sumably tetradic, Thessalian cities.103There also survives a fragmen-tary Koan decree concerning the dispatch and reception oftheoroidatedto ca. – that may have been motivated in some measure by theattempts to upgrade the Asklepieia in .104The content of the decreesof acceptance, when apprehensible, is normative, and on the basis ofthis most lacunose dossier, Thessaly appears again as a collection ofpoleis.There are hints, however, in the decrees from these varied Thessaliancities that the Koantheoroiappealed to a broaderethnosidentity whichoverlapped with that of the individualpoleis. So, for example, in theGonnoi decree, the Koantheoroiareallegedtohaveemphasizedthesyn-geneiaandphilialinking Kos not simply with Gonnoi, but also with theethnosof the Perrhaibians broadly construed. A clause in the Homo-lion decree indicates that thetheoroimade similar claims about the rela-tionship between the Koans and Magnesians. One of the fragmentarydecrees from tetradic Thessaly suggests that theethnosof the Thessalianscould also be invoked by thesetheoroiin their attempt to win acceptance102IG.., , a fragmentary opisthographic stele containing at least four decreesof acceptance; in addition to the three perioikic cities mentioned above, Megara was alsoincluded.

This need not implythat such arguments were not in fact made.106In their decree of accep-tance, Gonnoi reaffirmed these ethnic ties in somewhat startling fash-ion: ‘Resolved by the city of Gonnoi: let there be friendship and alliancefor all the Perrhaibians with the city of Kos, just as there was even fromthe beginning’.107It is possible that the cutter of the decree erred andinscribed ‘alliance’ (συμμα)\u0019αν)for‘kinship’(συγγ.νειαν), for the Koantheoroiseem only to have mentioned ‘friendship and kinship’.108If cor-rectly inscribed, however, such an alliance certainly had no specific, con-temporary historical referent.109The phrase seems to reflect an escalationof the language of kinship at the level of theethnoson the part of Gonnoi.The Koans had mentioned onlysyngeneia, but the Gonnoians ‘correct’their guests with the specification ofsymmachia.ThePerrhaiboiwereofcourse in no position to declare or reaffirm as a legitimate political actoran ancestral alliance with Kos, nor would the city of Gonnoi have beenable to speak on its behalf had the Perrhaiboi been organized formally asa league or the equivalent in . It is difficult to see what the Koans couldhave gained from such a formulation. Their initial arguments were gearedtoward winning an acceptance of the enlarged Asklepieia, and nothingbesides. Gonnoi, however, may have seen some symbolic gain in electingto present itself in a leadership position vis-à-vis the Perrhaiboi and inadvertising this ‘status’ both at home and abroad.110105IG.., , l. .

When viewedthrough the lens of international religion, Thessaly appears as a regionof cities, and it isquacitizens of a city rather than members of aneth-nosorkoinonthat these Thessalians are incorporated into this systemof religion. This image would change in the decades after the Flamini-nan reforms, when the Thessaliankoinonbecame the dominant actor ininternational cult (outside of Delphi). This need not imply that individ-ual cities ceased to be prominent within this network, only that collectiverepresentation of the Thessaliankoinonassumed a greater prominencethan had ever been the case.Soon after , the Mytileneans appear to have invited the Thes-salian League to dispatchtheoroiand sacrifices to the festival of theAsklepieia.119The Thessalian League agreed, and there survives an earlysecond-century Mytilenean decree honoring the League for doing so.120117IMagnesia (Helly , vol. , no. ; Rigsby , pp. –, no. ).118IMagnesia (IG.2., ; Rigsby , pp. –, no. ).119For Asklepios cult at Mytilene, see Shields , pp. –, and especially Rieth-müller , vol. , pp. –.120IGsuppl.,  (Labarre , pp. –, no. ).

The profile of individual Thes-salian cities on the same stage declines by contrast. Some of this discrep-ancy is certainly due to the nature of the extant evidence. From the post-Flamininan era, there survive neithertheorodokoicatalogues like thosefrom Delphi, Argos, or Epidauros, nor archives of festival acceptancescomparable to those from Kos or Magnesia.135The possibility that thisimage has some grounding in reality should not be entirely dismissed.Dispatch of representativetheoroion behalf of all members of the Thes-salian League would have spared considerable expense on the part ofindividualpoleisand brought greater prestige to thekoinon.Inthefinalanalysis, it may be safest to assume that some prosperous Thessalian citiescontinued to dispatchtheoroiand that the Thessalian League was merelyan addition to this already rich palette.The final new festival offers a more direct comparison with the Koanand Magnesian archives of festival acceptances, and so may provide thebest evidence yet for the evolving Thessalian presence in Hellenisticinternational religion.

To do so, it hasbeen necessary to consider first Thessaly’s Archaic, Classical, and earlyHellenistic history. Early incarnations of the Thessalian League lack adistinct profile in the realm of cult. Some of this impression may bedue to the character of the preserved evidence, some to the relativeweakness and instability of theLeague in its opening centuries.Whateverthe reason, the contrast with the later Hellenistic League is striking.In these years a strong league emerged under Roman patronage thattook a leading role in cult, both at home and abroad. The League’sfounding of a cult of Zeus Eleutherios in Larisa celebrated this newhistory of the League and, most probably, Rome’s leading role within it,while the League’s reinvigoration of the cult of Athena Itonia at Philialooked to a more ancient past. The spread of a unified regional calendarlikewise organized the passage of the year around festivals honoringdivinities in a sometimes very ‘Thessalian’ aspect. Thessalian Leaguetheoroitraveled far and wide to represent the League in international cultcontexts.Against this narrative of unity and the expression of shared Thessalianidentity in the language of cult, it is possible to read another narrative,one of fragmentation and disjuncture. There is no hint of participation inthe cults of Athena Itonia or Zeus Eleutherios by new League members,the non-tetradicperioikoi, and this fact mirrors the political leadershipof the Thessalian League at this time. While the League calendar gainedacceptance throughout the tetrads relatively quickly, someperioikoiper-sisted in their epichoric calendar traditions deep into the first century.And although the Leaguetheoroiwere major players within the networkof new international festivals in the later Hellenistic period, the conser-vatism of the Delphic Amphictiony allowed all of the new Thessaloi rep-resentation to participate as distinct, independentethne. The persistentpolyvalence of cult thus complicated, indeed contested, this Thessalianidentity in precisely those arenas where it had been asserted.Thedynamismofthesetwinnarrativesdoesnotfadeinwiththefullincorporation of the Spercheiosethneinto the Thessalian League and the"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"conclusion and postscript: ainian futuresinclusion of the League withinprovincia Achaia.Asacodatothepresentstudy, I offer a brief case study of Ainis, the last of theperioikoidescribedin this work to enter the Thessalian League.1The religious history ofAinis in the later Hellenistic and Roman periods indicates the continuedvibrancy of the individual religious traditions of the Thessalianethne.After joining the Thessalian League in the first century bce and becomingpolitically invisible, theethnosof the Ainianes nevertheless remainedsalient in cult and, over the course of the first and second centuries ce,there are indications that the political center of gravity of the ThessalianLeague began to shift southwards, from Larisa to Hypata.ButIbeginatanearlierperiod.Theelaboratemigrationtraditionofthe Ainianes discussed briefly in Chapter One,2and to which I shallsoon return, represented one strategy by which the Archaic and Clas-sicalethnosforged a link with its Homeric past. Other outlets were avail-able. The pseudo-Aristotelian ‘On Matters Wondrous to Hear’ recountsan Archaic dedication allegedly made by Herakles in Ainis: ‘In the coun-try called Ainian, in that part called Hypate, an ancient pillar is said tohave been found; as it bore an inscription in archaic characters of whichthe Ainianes wished to know the origin, they sent messengers to Athensto take it there. But as they were traveling through Boiotia, and dis-cussing their journey from home with some strangers, it is said that theywere escorted into the so-called Ismenion in Thebes. For they were toldthat the inscription was most likely to be deciphered there, as they pos-sessed certain offerings having ancient letters similar in form. There hav-ing discovered what they were seeking from the known letters they tran-scribed the following lines: Herakles dedicated a sacred grove to CytheraPhersephassa,/Whendriving theflocksof Geryon and Erythea./Thegod-dess Pasiphassa subdued him with desire for her./Here my newly wedErythe brought forth a son Erython;/then I made a gift of the plain inmemory of our love under a shady beech-tree’.3In this rich passage someAinianes attempt to implicate themselves in the career of a more broadly1Magnesia, which had been founded (or refounded) as akoinonas part of theFlamininan reorganization of central Greece in the s and had remained independentcontinuously since the conclusion of the Third Macedonian War in , was formallyincorporated into the Thessalian League at the time of Diocletian.2Hom.Il. .–; Str. ...

Such a visit is otherwise unknown in the mythology ofAinis, but the exceptionally well-traveled Herakles was popular in Greekepichoric traditions. Communities large and small throughout the Greekworld advertised that Herakles had dedicated there his weapons or thoseof his enemies, perhaps a lock of his hair.4So, while it is useful toobserve the Ainianes participating in this broader trend, there is nothingespecially novel about this visit. What is uncharacteristic, however, is therole of Thebes, whose participation is crucial to the story. The sanctuaryof Apollo Ismenios was distinguished at least from the time of Herodotusas a repository of archaic dedications and Herakles was a leading figurein Theban cult.5TheSpartanfoundationofHerakleiaTrachiniaintheSpercheios valley, just east of Ainis and from its origins inimical to it, withits heavily Dorian and Heraklid associations, surely rendered Herakles amore contentious figure in the region than he had previously been.6Itmay therefore not be too far off to see this story, whatever its origins, ashaving had an ideological flavor early in the fourth century (if in factit was in circulation by then), perhaps suggesting some sort of looseaffiliation of Ainis and Thebes.Imagined Ainian pre- and proto-histories continued to develop intothe Imperial era. Plutarch’s perplexingGreek Questionsare twice occu-pied withAinianika. He asks the puzzling question: ‘What is the “beg-gar’s meat” among the Ainianes?’7His response begins: ‘Many have beenthe migrations of the Ainianes’. There follows a lengthy discussion ofthese movements, which take the Ainianes from Thessaly west to Epirosand thence to the south and east, where, through a combination of reli-gious scruple and cunning, they win a new homeland in the Spercheiosvalley after a winner-take-all Homeric duel fought between the Ainianking, Phemios, and the Inachian kind, Hyperochos. Phemios slew Hype-rochos with a stone and the Inachians were driven away as a result.In commemoration of the deed, Plutarch describes elaborate cult per-formed in the vicinity of Phemios’ stone that involved setting aside a4Cf.

Later in theGreek Questions, Plutarch revisits the Ainianes, this time describing anexceptional procession leading from Ainis to Epiros: ‘What is the rea-son that the maidens who escort those who lead the ox from the Aini-anes to Kassiopaea chant, until they reach the boundary, “May ye neverreturn home to your dear fatherland”?’8Following a recapitulation of themigration legend described earlier in the work, he concludes: ‘Hence itseems probable they pray to the gods not to return again to their oldfatherland, but to remain here where they are prosperous’.9Althoughneither cult is otherwise attested, there is no reason to doubt their his-toricity. Plutarch connects each cultic act with Ainian migrations fromnorthern Greece, which suggests that such an interpretation was reason-able at this date, whatever the original purpose of these rites. As recentscholarship reminds us, migration traditions are more productively readas a means to justify a current division of territory and, often enough,the attendant subjugation of bordering populations, rather than accu-rately reflecting any real historical change of residence.10In the contextof the late first or early second century ce, however, we ought perhaps tothink that the actual need for such codifications of the territorial statusquo will have passed or at least become far less pressing that they mayonce have been. While one can do little more than speculate about thefunction of such a tradition and such cult in this era, at the very least,it must have assisted in the continuation of an Ainian identity. For it isPlutarch’s emphasis on the Ainianes as a group which is most strikingabout these passages. By the time of theGreek Questions, Ainis had beenfully subsumed in the Thessalian League for at least  years; Ainianeswere no longer referred to as Ainianes in public documents, but as Thes-salians; they used the Thessalian calendar and coinage; they renamedtheir local officialstagoi, in apparent imitation of the common Thes-salian practice. Perhaps most significantly, Ainis was no longer presenton the Amphictionic council at Delphi as a discreteethnos.Ifevertherewas a time when Ainian identity might begin to wither, it would seemto be in the post- period, yet we get the opposite impression fromPlutarch.8Greek Questions (Mor.  B–C).9Cf.

They are Hellenes in the truestsense of the word, for they trace their descent from Hellen, the son ofDeukalion’.11This claim on the Hellenic genealogy is further elaboratedby a concurrent claim on Achilles, embodied first in the Ainian worshipof Achilles’ son, Neoptolemus, at Delphi: ‘As for the sacrifice and sacredmission, the Ainianes send it to Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles, onceevery four years to coincidewith thePythian Games,which,as you know,are being held at the moment’.12The Thessalians, recognizing Ainiandescent from Achilles, renounce claim to Neoptolemus’ cult.13Is this depiction of the Ainianes historically accurate? While the Ain-ian sacrifice to Neoptolemus at Delphi is otherwiseunattested, G. Rouge-mont and J. Pouilloux’s investigations suggest that there could be somesmall historical kernel in this account.14T. Whitmarsh gives cause forcaution in his demonstration of Heliodorus’ continual interest in iden-tity, specifically Greek versus non-Greek, and it is entirely possible thatHeliodorus is playing a learned game with Ainian, Thessalian, and, ulti-mately, Greek identity, and creating something that has little relationshipto a historical reality.15But as J.A.O. Larsen has shown,beginning alreadyin the first century ce and continuing into the third century ce, Hypata,the most prominent city of Ainis, was home to a burgeoning elite thatfilled important posts within the Thessalian League, the Delphic Amph-ictiony, and, in time, the Panhellenion.16While Larisa remained power-ful within the Thessalian League and continued to serve as the seat ofthe federal assembly, one could argue that Hypata had in fact become the11Aithiop. ...12Aithiop. ...13Aithiop. ...14Rougemont ; Pouilloux ; Pouilloux .15Whitmarsh .16Larsen ."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":" conclusion and postscript: ainian futuresmore dominant city from a broader Mediterranean perspective. If thereis an historical basis to Heliodorus’ account, it is possible that this episodein theAithiopikareflects this contemporary reality rather than the Clas-sical past. Multiple readings then become possible. Perhaps this elite inHypata was attempting to distance itself from its Thessalian contempo-raries by advertising its Ainian heritage; by making exclusive claims onAchilles; by stressing their position within the Hellenic genealogy; andby taking a conspicuous lead in the program of the Pythia. At the veryleast, whether Heliodorus’ account of the Ainianes is historically accu-rate or complete fabrication, the prominence of these Ainianes in thiswork suggests that the idea of Ainis continued to have currency at thisdate, now some several centuries after their incorporation into the Thes-salian League.17In the logic of the procession, Ainis and the Ainianes aresimultaneously Thessalian and more elect than the Thessalians; a beauti-ful synthesis, and one at which our laconic Hellenistic inscriptions maypoint to in the case of other Thessalianethne.17Cf.

The document in any case belongs to the earlier stages of the fes-tival’s history. Two points are of special interest. First, in later periods, vic-tors from Larisa are designated as haling from ‘Pelasgian’ Larisa, presum-ably to distinguish the city from Achaian Larisa (better known as LarisaKremaste) in previously perioikic Phthiotic Achaia. The absence of sucha distinction in this inscription, and in Epigraphic Appendix  (IG.,), may reflect the fact that Larisa Kremaste still lay outside the Thes-salian League at this time. Second, the order of festivals diverges fromlater lists where victors in the special, Thessalian component of the festi-val (bull-hunt,aphippolampas,aphippodromas) were listed immediatelyafter the musical victors. In the present inscription, athletic victors fol-low directly upon the musical victors. Such evidence may indicate merelyan evolving epigraphic habit at Larisa. More substantially, it may sug-gest either that the Thessalian triad had not yet been introduced in thefestival at this time or that those events may have taken place later inthe competition. The small geographic range of victorious participants(only Thessalians and Boiotians are represented), is most likely acciden-tal; the contemporary Epigraphic Appendix  preserves a different rangeof events revealing a much broader geographic catchment for the festival:Thasos, Kyme, Magnesia on the Maiander, Kerkyra, and Syracuse are allrepresented.Line : Theagonothete, Androsthenes son of Italos from Gyrton, hasbeenplausiblyidentifiedastheindividualofsamenameandethnicknown from Eusebius to have served asstrategosof the Thessalian Leaguein /.2Given the prominence of the family, however, it is not impos-sible that a homonym from a later generation filled the office.

Nam adhucnemo sciebat cuius in dei honorem illi ludi quorum habemus latercula vic-torum Larisae celebrati essent.’38So Kern wrote in , excited to finallyassociate a god with (some of) those Larisan victor lists known to him atthe time.There are several chronological indicators. Kern thought the letterforms consistent with the early first century.39Preuner noted that thephrase ‘twenty ... contest’ (l. –) suggested a date range ca. –.40If the festival was not immediately initiated in , and given the extentof Flamininus’ activities in Thessaly as late as  (reflecting the generaldisorder of the region), this range of dates could be pushed slightlylater.41In his research on Boiotian victor lists ca. –, Gossage hassuggested a publication date of ca. – for this inscription, based onthe presence of Stratios in a relatively securely dated victor list fromthe Ptoia at Akraiphia, and what is likely his brother, Philoarnos, alsoa trumpeter, in a relatively securely dated victor list from the Mouseia atThespiai.42Gossage appears unaware of Preuner’s arguments, however,and one imagines that thefloruitof a trumpeter was considerably longerthan that of a sprinter or pankratiast. A date ca. – seems not unlikelyfor the present inscription.Line : Kramolisch identifies theagonotheteof this inscription withIsagoras, son of Pherekrates, from Larisa.43This Isagoras was awardedproxeny by the Delphians in / and is on record as atagosof Larisaabout the turn of the first century.

As discussed in Chapter Two, when com-bined with the prosopography of the inscription, this admission pro-vides strong evidence that the Eleutheria were a penteteric festival. Likethe Olympia, and increasingly many other festivals in the Hellenisticand Roman period that seem to have taken the Olympia as a model,iterations of the Eleutheria were numbered sequentially.45If the ordi-nal has been interpreted correctly, then it would seem to draw attentionto the establishment of the festival and the concomitant refoundation oftheThessalianLeagueintheaftermathoftheSecondMacedonianWar,events which continued to loom large in the region more than a centurylater.Line : Kern’s!ν\u0019κωνis probably correct and certainly approximatesthe sense of what is required.

Kramolisch , pp. , , offers another, less likely possibility:that this individual was Isagoras son of Nysandros, from Larisa, general of the ThessalianLeague ca.  and ahieromnemonin Larisa ca.  (Giannopoulos , pp. –, no.A (McDevitt , p. , no. )).

The ethnics ofvictors are never listed in Stena victor lists. Since no preamble has beenpreserved which could provide an internal means of dating the documentaccurately, recourse is made to prosopographic links between this mon-ument and another, more securely dated inscription,IOropos, thatcertainly postdates the Mithridatic war and Sulla’s benefactions to theAmphiareion at Oropos ca. .69It is likely that the present monument isslightly later in date thanIOropos (see commentary on l. ), hencethe ‘post ’ date suggested above. The letter forms are broadly consistentwith such a date.Line , : Diotimos son of Pantalkes is victorious in two competi-tions for boys. The name Pantalkes is very rare, attested only at Pharsalos(IThessEnip–), and Helly’sΘεσσαλ4ς %π4 Φαρσ\u001eλωνis a reason-able supplement for the victor’s ethnic.68Helly  plausibly reconstructs boys’-youths’-men’s pentathlon (l. –), boys’-men’s dolichon (l. –), boys’-youths’-men’s stadion (l. –), boys’-men’s diaulon (l. –), boys’-men’s hippion (l. –), boys’-youths’-men’s boxing (l. –).69IOropos l.  mentions a contestε0αγγελ\u0019α τ=ς 8Ρω[μα\u0019ων ν\u0019κης], whichis most likely related to the announcement of the Sullan victory over Mithridates in and thus offers a firm terminus post quem for both the Oropian inscription andthe present Eleutheria victor list. Cf. Schachter –, vol. , p. , n. , with furtherbibliography. But the point is not uncontroversial; see, e.g., Etienne and Knoepfler ,p. , n. , who argue, somewhat unconvincingly, that the contest refers rather to theSenate’sprotection of the sanctuary from the publicani in  and their de factoratificationof Sulla’s benefactions.

Since this monument commemorates victories at the Eleutheria, itmust date after . I have suggested in Chapter Two that the shift in"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"epigraphic appendixrepresenting the ethnic of Larisan victors from simply ‘Larisan’ or ‘Thes-salian from Larisa’ to ‘Thessalian from Larisa of Pelasgis’ may in partreflect the full and official inclusion of Larisa Kremaste of Achaia Phthi-otis within the Thessalian in the s or s. The lettering appears closeto the cluster of victor lists dated to the first half of the first century.84Kern’s schematic drawing and majuscule transcription of the stoneinIG. suggest strongly that the inscription was preserved at leastpartially on the top and the right—there is room for no text prior toline  on this stone. If this is the beginning of the list of victors inthe musical-gymnic portion of the Eleutheria, then crucial informationabout the date of the festival, theagonothete, etc., must have been sup-plied on a crowning member which would have been attached to thetop of the stele (as was perhaps also the case in Epigraphic Appendix ).Since it is now possible that there was also a series of dramatic con-tests at the Eleutheria (see Epigraphic Appendix ), one cannot ruleout the possibility that victors in those contests were inscribed on ste-lai separate from those recording victories in the musical-gymnic com-ponent, and that there is here preserved the beginning of just such astele. Whatever events were listed here, there is some occasional com-pression of, e.g., ethnics and contest headings, on the model of Epi-graphic Appendix . Lacuna length to the right is indeterminate. Line offers a very rough idea, where the lacuna contained  letters of the vic-tors ethnic in addition to his father’s name; – letters total for thatlacuna is plausible, which would give an overall line length of – let-ters.Line : The name Themistion is attested here for the first time inLarisa.85.Victor List from a Dramatic Festival at LarisaFragment of grey-white marble, broken top, right, bottom, and back; pre-served left.

The certain restoration of the first ethnic in the inscription as‘Thessalian from Larisa Pelasgis’ finds parallels in the corpus of victor listsfor the Thessalian Eleutheria. There is an economy in assuming that theEleutheria also featured dramatic contests. There is no room, however,to fit a sequence of dramatic events within the most likely reconstructionof a normative Eleutheria victor list; the progression visible there, withone conspicuous and early exception, is () melic contests, () Thessaliantriad, () gymnic contests, () equestrian contests. Dramatic events thusmust have been inscribed on separate stelai. Alternatively, it is possiblethat the dramaticagonwas part of, in effect, a second festival which may"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"epigraphic appendixhave immediately preceded or followed the Eleutheria, or that such a fes-tival existed and was completely distinct in duration from the Eleuthe-ria.None of the individuals mentioned within the inscription can beidentified with any certainty and prosopography cannot help to date theinscription. The style of lettering and layout of the inscription are exactlyparallel with Epigraphic Appendix –; the relatively well-establishedchronology of those inscriptions suggests that a date ca. – wouldnot be too far off the mark."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHYAdrimi-Sismani, V., A.
