[{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"iVotive Body Parts in Greek and Roman ReligionThis book examines a type of object that was widespread and very popular in classical antiquity – votive offerings in the shape of parts of the human body. It collects examples from four principal areas and time periods: Classical Greece, pre- Roman Italy, Roman Gaul and Roman Asia Minor. It uses a compare- and- contrast methodology to highlight differences between these sets of votives, exploring the implications for our understandings of how beliefs about the body changed across classical antiquity. The book also looks at how far these ancient beliefs overlap with, or differ from, modern ideas about the body and its physical and conceptual boundaries. Central themes of the book include illness and healing, bodily fragmentation, human- animal hybridity, transmission and reception of traditions, and the mechanics of personal transformation in religious rituals.JESSICA HUGHES is a Lecturer in Classical Studies at the Open University.

This was a collaborative, multi- disciplinary project aimed at tracking how beliefs about the human body changed over time and space between the Neolithic and the present day. I joined the team as a postdoctoral student in late 2005, immediately after completing my PhD in Roman Art at the Courtauld Institute. I owe a great deal to all my col-leagues on the Leverhulme project, and especially John Robb, Oliver Harris, Katharina Rebay- Salisbury and Simon Stoddart. Most of all, I owe an enor-mous debt of thanks to Robin Osborne, who read and commented on every chapter of the book, and who was the most inspiring and generous postdoc-toral mentor I could have hoped for.Whilst writing up my research project I have benefited from being part of a vibrant Department of Classical Studies at the Open University, and I thank all my colleagues there for providing such a supportive and fun environment to work in. I am particularly grateful to Emma- Jayne Graham, Helen King, Janet Huskinson and Phil Perkins, who have each commented on versions of these chapters and enthusiastically shared their knowledge about ancient bodies and archaeology. Beyond the OU, I have also benefited from presenting material at different seminars and conferences. Special mention must go to the participants in the seminar on Ex- Voto: Votives across Cultures organised by Ittai Weinryb at the Bard Graduate Center in New York in 2010, and the Bodies of Evidence conference organised by Emma- Jayne Graham and Jane Draycott at the British School in Rome in 2012. Further formative encounters happened in the context of the Memoria Romana project directed by Karl Galinksy. Although my work on that pro-ject addressed a different topic (Roman spolia), the time that I spent delv-ing into the literature on Memory Studies shaped much of my subsequent thinking about votives, and the many ways in which these objects intersect with cultural and autobiographical memory.Many other people have helped me bring this book into being. Three of my past teachers need special thanks: John Murrell at the John Henry Newman School in Stevenage, Mary Beard at Newnham College in Cambridge and "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"xivAcknowledgementsxivPeter Stewart, who was my PhD supervisor at the Courtauld Institute in London. I am grateful to all those colleagues who have contributed to The Votives Project website that Emma- Jayne and I set up in 2014, and especially to Jean Turfa and Urmila Mohan, who have answered many of my ques-tions about votives and material religion. I am indebted to Michael Sharp at CUP for his patience and encouragement, to the anonymous CUP review-ers for their thoughtful critiques of the first version of my manuscript, and to Jane Robson and Clare Owen for invaluable help with copyediting and production. I also received help with photographs from Ian Armit, Michelle Berger, Julie Charmoillaux, Benedetto De Martino, Nancy De Grummond, Yvonne De Rosa, Dan Diffendale, Myriam Fèvre, Crestina Forcina, Anna Laine, Daria Lanzuolo, Lucio Lazarese and Georg Petzl.Votive offerings are profoundly rewarding objects to work with, partly on account of the sense of intimacy that they bring to the study of history and the way in which they make us reflect on the practical, personal and emotional challenges faced by individuals in the past. During the last few years these objects have given me daily reminders about the transience and frailty of human existence, but also about the strength and tenacity of fam-ily bonds and friendships. In addition to those already mentioned, I am ever thankful for the presence in my life of Linda, Jon and Nick Hughes, Susan Zacharias, Alida Ferrara, Bruno and Ambra De Martino, and of course my husband Benedetto and our daughters Alice and Micòl. Finally, I would like to record my respectful gratitude to the men and women who first dedicated these votives to their gods, and who have unknowingly given me a precious glimpse of their world, and of other worlds beyond that one.newgenprepdf"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"111 Introduction: Fragments of HistoryThere was a temple filled with various ornaments, where the barbarians of the area used to make offerings and gorge themselves with meat and wine until they vomited; they adored idols there as if they were gods, and placed there wooden models of parts of the human body whenever some part of their body was touched by pain.1 Gregory of ToursThe typical forms of the ex- voto, such as the anatomical forms, have practically never evolved – neither in size, nor in the choice of materials, nor in the techniques of manufacture, nor even in the ‘style’ of figuration, which it would be better to qualify as a formal insensibility to any affirmation of style – from Greek, Etruscan or Roman Antiquity, to what we can still observe today in the Christian sanctuaries of Cyprus, Bavaria, Italy or the Iberian Peninsula.2 George Didi- HubermanOn Easter Monday in 1450, in the small town of Sant’Anastasia near Naples, a young boy lost a ball- game and, in a fit of pique, hurled the ball at an image of the Madonna that was painted into a nearby roadside shrine.3 These events would hardly have gone down in history, had not the image – to the amazement and horror of those gathered – begun to bleed profusely down its left cheek. In the years that followed, a sanctuary was built on the spot, which became, and remains, one of the most important sites of pilgrimage in the whole of Catholic Europe. The bleeding face was the first miracle of many. Over the centuries, countless numbers of the faithful have been saved from death and disaster by the Madonna dell’Arco: evidence of these events can be seen today in the huge accumulation of ex- votos displayed in the sanctuary and its adjoining museum, which was inaugurated in the Jubilee year 2000. While the dedications include many different kinds of objects (crutches, medical instruments, degree certificates, photographs, clothes, 1 Gregory of Tours, Vitae patrum 6.2 De sancto Gallo episcopo. Translation James (1985), 53– 4. 2 Didi- Huberman (2007), 7. 3 For an introduction to the history of the sanctuary and the miracles performed there, see Giardino and De Cristoforo (1996). "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"2Introduction: Fragments of History2hair), two types of votive gift predominate: the painted wooden tablets, which depict the intercession of the Virgin in the varied disasters of life, and the metal body parts which represent the part of the body that has been (or hopefully will be) healed from illness. These latter line the walls of the sanc-tuary’s corridors, elaborately arranged on panels for the visitor’s contempla-tion (Figure 1.1). Almost every part of the body is represented, including eyes, ears, hands, mouths, hearts, legs and the ‘dissected’ torsos which plot the internal organs in relief on the surface of the chest and stomach.These votive body parts are not unique to the Madonna dell’Arco sanc-tuary, nor even to the Catholic faith. They are found at sanctuaries of dif-ferent creeds all over the world, from Orthodox churches in Greece to Hindu temples in southern India.4 Moreover, the practice has deep his-torical roots: ‘anatomical’ votives are found at least as far back as classical antiquity, when model body parts in metal, marble, wood and terracotta were dedicated in the sanctuaries of the gods of Greece and Rome. Like the later Christian offerings, these ancient models often appear to have Figure 1.1 Ex- voto body parts on display in 2011 in the sanctuary of the Madonna dell’Arco, S. Anastasia, near Naples. 4 For examples of votives from a range of geographical and cultural contexts, see Francis (2007) and Weinryb (2016). "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"3Introduction: Fragments of History3been dedicated in thanks or expectation of a bodily healing miracle: this, at least, is the reading suggested by the tiny handful of literary texts which mention the practice, as well as by the occasional inscriptions found on the objects themselves, their frequent archaeological findspots in sanctuaries of ancient healing deities, and comparison with similar objects from later periods such as the Catholic ex- votos from the sanctuary of the Madonna dell’Arco.5 Other body parts were no doubt appropriated for other reasons besides healing, although in most cases it is impossible to reconstruct the stories behind their dedication. Crucially – following what Day has described as the ‘dissolution of the link between offering and dedicant’ – the vast majority of viewers in antiquity would also have been left to won-der at the narrative behind many of the votives that they saw in sanctuar-ies, thereby creating an intimate relationship between dedicant and deity from which all other viewers were excluded.6This book aims to track how and why the anatomical votive cult devel-oped and spread in classical antiquity, and to shed light on some of the varied meanings that these objects held for their ancient users and viewers. It is structured around four case- studies of anatomical votives from dif-ferent chronological and geographical contexts – four discrete snapshots, which are then woven together to construct a ‘moving picture’ of the ana-tomical votive cult in the ancient world. Chapter 2 looks at the early ana-tomical votive cult in fifth- and fourth- century bc Greece, exploring how these objects might be tied to emergent views of the body in the Classical period. Chapter 3 then moves across the Mediterranean to examine votive body parts in the sanctuaries of Republican central Italy, focusing on how and why these clay models differ from the votives studied in the previous chapter. After this, Chapters 4 and 5 use the examples of Roman Gaul and Asia Minor to investigate how the anatomical votive cult developed away from the classical ‘centre’, in each case again considering how these mani-festations of the ritual relate to the material discussed in earlier chapters. This comparative approach leads to an understanding of the votive cult that is flexible and mutating: in this sense, it differs from the picture painted in the work of earlier scholars (including Didi- Huberman, cited above), who 5 For a discussion of the evidence relating votives to healing, see Schultz (2006), 100– 9. Most literary texts mentioning anatomical votives are Christian and later in date than the practices they describe. In addition to the passage from Gregory of Tours (above, n. 1), see Theoderet Graecarum affectionem curatio 8.64; Augustine De civitate Dei 6.9 (on parts of the body dedicated in temples of Liber and Libera for the hope of successful ejaculation); 1 Samuel 5.6– 6.12 (on anatomical votives dedicated by the Philistines – see further discussion below). 6 Day (1994), 40. "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"4Introduction: Fragments of History4have preferred to see the longevity of the anatomical votive cult as evidence of a long and unbroken continuity in bodily beliefs and practices.Anatomical votives are challenging objects to work with, partly on account of the difficulties involved in counting and dating them accurately (the contextual archaeological evidence is often frustratingly scant), but also because they challenge some of our most deep- rooted modern beliefs and ideas about how the body was represented and perceived in classi-cal antiquity. It is important to state at the outset that this book does not attempt to present an exhaustive account of all the extant archaeological evidence for anatomical votives across the ancient world. The goal, instead, is to focus on a relatively small number of deposits, as well as on individual objects from within those deposits, and to start thinking about how this material might be interpreted in the light of the shifting social and cultural background against which the votives were dedicated. ‘Interpretation’ here often means looking beyond the original, often irretrievable intention of the dedicant, to consider instead what these objects might reveal about the more tacit beliefs held by those who used and viewed them. In part, this involves looking closely at which body parts were represented in particular contexts, and also at how these parts were represented. My approach also involves acknowledging that anatomical votives do much more than simply indicate sick parts of an individual’s body, as has normally been assumed.7 In fact, another central theme of the book is that of fragmentation, and over the pages that follow I will demonstrate how, in the material forms of these votives, physical suffering became intertwined with other ideas and images centred on the broken or ‘rebuilt’ body – from sickness and sacrifice to human- animal hybridity and the creation of the ancient ‘body politic’.Scholarship on Votive OfferingsUntil recently, anatomical votives have remained on the margins of classi-cal scholarship. Model body parts do not generally appear in standard text-books on ancient art, nor in books about the representation of the classical body, and for most of the last century the discussion of anatomical votives was dominated by historians of medicine and religion. One of the earliest 7 To give one typical example: in his publication of the votives from Corinth, Carl Roebuck notes that the votives ‘should probably [...] be regarded as thank offerings for the cure of some ailment of which the general nature or location is indicated by the part represented’. Roebuck (1951), 117. Other publications acknowledge the fact that anatomical votives may have been dedicated before healing, as a request for a future miracle, but the underlying assumption is still the same: the form of the votive, which isolates the body part from the context of the whole body, serves (only) to illustrate the part of the body that was (or had recently been) malfunctioning.

"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"6Introduction: Fragments of History6His book was then cited in one of the earliest studies devoted entirely to the anatomical votives: the 1746 thesis by Johann Jakob Frey titled Disquisitio de more diis simulacra membrorum consecrandi: ad illustrandum cap. VI prio-ris libri Samuelis (‘A thesis on the custom of dedicating images of limbs to the gods: to illustrate Chapter VI of the first book of Samuel’).9 Frey’s sub-title referred to the Old Testament story in which the Philistines dedicate golden models of their anuses (or, according to some interpretations, their buttocks) after they had been punished by God with a plague, following the theft of the sacred Ark of the Covenant.10 This biblical narrative is analysed in the final chapter of Frey’s text, where he focuses on diagnosing the disease suffered by the Philistines.11 The rest of his book ostensibly fills in some of the background to this story by discussing the origins and various aspects of the anatomical votive ritual in pagan and early Christian antiquity, from the role of body parts in the cults of Asklepios, Minerva and Diana, to the continued use of such objects by the Franks and Germans.12 Notably, one of the passages discussed by Frey would prove extremely useful to later schol-ars who wished to argue that anatomical votives worked to ‘substitute’ the real body of the dedicant: this was a section of Aelius Aristides’ Hieroi Logoi (Sacred Tales) which describes how the god Asklepios appeared to the sick Aristides in a dream, instructing him to dedicate a (real) finger as a pars pro toto offering on behalf of his whole body; when Aristides complained that this was too great a demand, he was allowed to dedicate a ring instead.13 We will return to consider this passage in Chapter 5 of this book.The next significant study of anatomical votives was a 1902 mono-graph written by Cambridge schoolteacher, W. H. D. Rouse, Greek Votive Offerings: An Essay in the History of Greek Religion.14 Rouse classified ancient votive offerings according to the motives for which they appeared 9 Cf. Pezold (1710), another early dissertation on ‘human body parts consecrated to gods’. 10 1 Samuel 5.6– 6.12. 11 Later discussions of this passage would also focus on retrospective diagnosis. The disease suffered by the Philistines has variously been interpreted as dysentry, bubonic plague and bacillary dysentry, which can lead to piles. See Josephus Antiquitates Judaicae 6.3, Harris (1921), Shrewsbury (1949), Lust (1990), Freemon (2005). For more on this passage see Schultz (2006), 187 n. 37 and Aejmelaeus (2007), 250– 2: Schultz notes that ‘The Masoretic commentary on the Hebrew text of Samuel (written perhaps as early as the eighth century AD and designed to promote stability of the Hebrew text) indicates that ofolim ought to be replaced with tchorim, “hemorrhoids”).’ Aejmelaeus suggests that the Greek εὶς τὰς ἕδρας is a ‘euphemistic circumlocation’ according to which buttocks were made to stand for emerods. Aejmelaeus (2007), 250– 2; see also Lust (1990).

This last cate-gory was then subdivided into ‘images of the deliverer’, ‘person delivered’, ‘act or process’ and ‘miscellaneous’. Like other scholars before and after him, Rouse took it for granted that the anatomical votives portrayed the body of the mortal worshipper rather than the deity, and placed them alongside other images of the ‘person delivered’ which took the form of ‘whole body’ reliefs and portrait statues.15 He enumerated the types of body part found in Greek sanctuaries, and briefly considered how these might reflect ancient epidemiology. For instance, in relation to the body parts mentioned in the inventory inscriptions from the Asklepieion at Athens, Rouse commented that: ‘The favourite disease in Athens during the fourth century seems to have been bad eyes: votive eyes, in ones and twos, make up two- fifths of the whole number. Next to the eyes come the trunk: this may betoken inter-nal pains, or it may include various segments of the body which would tell different tales if we could see them.’16 Rouse also indicated how the votives might fit into a Winckelmannian paradigm of classical art history as a history of decline, remarking that ‘this custom [of dedicating body parts] shows how low the artistic tastes of the Greeks had already fallen’.17Rouse was certainly not alone amongst his contemporaries in seeing the votive body parts as objects of historical interest rather than aesthetic appeal, and other studies from around the turn of the century focused on how the votives might be used as diagnostic tools for ancient illnesses. Studies of this kind were often written by physicians who had an interest in the his-tory of their discipline, and were published in journals of medicine whose readership consisted primarily of other doctors. In 1895, for example, Dr Luigi Sambon published a two- part illustrated article in the British Medical Journal titled ‘Donaria of Medical Interest in the Oppenheimer Collection of Etruscan and Roman Antiquities’, which described and illustrated a series of ‘instruments of surgery, pharmaceutical appliances, and painted tablets with miraculous healing’, as well as ‘the most interesting and least known of the donaria’, models of the limbs and viscera.18 Sambon picked out a hand-ful of votives which he saw as reflecting ancient knowledge of human anat-omy and pathology, including the models of phalli suffering from phimosis 15 Cf. Recke (2013), 1074: ‘The most important basis, from which all interpretive approaches proceed, is the recognition that the anatomical votives, as well as the relevant statues and heads, do not depict the deity revered, but rather mortal men.’ 16 Rouse (1902), 212. On these inscriptions, see the discussion in Chapter 2 of this book. 17 Rouse (1902), 210– 11. On Winckelmann and classical art history see Potts (1994); Harloe (2013). 18 Sambon (1895); cf. Rouquette (1911).

These last Sambon regarded as evidence of uterus septus, a congenital malformation in which the uterus opening is divided by a longitudinal wall, which he suggested may have been seen as associated with twin pregnancies.19Medical history approaches would continue to dominate scholarship on anatomical offerings for the rest of the century, and normally involved scholars analysing the votives for visual signs of illnesses. Anatomical votives appeared in the context of more general studies of art and medi-cine, such as Höllander’s 1912 study of Plastik und Medizin, and Grmek and Gourevitch’s 1998 book on Les maladies dans l’art antique, as well as in later archaeological publications of particular sites, which sometimes included sections on votives and retrospective diagnosis. Miranda Green’s 1994 pub-lication of archaeological material from the sanctuary of Dea Sequana near Dijon (on which see Chapter 4 below) uses the anatomical votives to diag-nose a series of illnesses suffered by pilgrims to the site, including goitre, trachoma, arrested hydrocephalus, Paget’s disease, Bell’s Palsy, ulcers, infec-tive osteitis of the skull, neuralgia, tuberculosis, leprosy, rickets, diabetes, osteomyelitis, poliomyelitis, post- traumatic Achilles tendinitis, Marfan’s syndrome, gout, and a small umbilical hernia.20 Others have taken a slightly 19 Phimosis: Sambon (1895), 148.

For example, in a study of terracotta votives from Etruria, Tim Potter took the large number of genitals in urban centres of Italy as evidence for a correspondingly high incidence of sexually trans-mitted diseases, and the high numbers of limbs in rural areas as reflecting the greater risk of accidents in an agricultural environment.21One refreshing deviation from these medical- historical studies appeared in 1935, when an Italian historian of religion named Adalberto Pazzini wrote a paper on ‘Il significato degli “ex voto” ed il concetto della divinità guari-trice’. Pazzini’s work reflected the contemporary anthropological interest in subaltern cultures, and he drew comparisons between the ancient anatom-icals and the modern Italian Catholic uses of ex- votos, which he attributed with a commemorative (‘pro memoria’) function. Unlike his history of med-icine colleagues who focused on identifying the symptoms suffered by indi-vidual dedicants, Pazzini was interested the broader ‘mechanics’ of ancient votive religion – that is, how and why the original users thought that these objects worked to heal the body. Drawing on contemporary anthropological theory, and in particular on the notions of sacrificial substitution and sym-pathetic magic, Pazzini constructed a complex argument which can be summarised as follows: in antiquity, bodily illness was perceived as pun-ishment sent by the gods; a person suffering sickness realised that they needed to expiate their transgression in order to appease the god and cure the disease; for this reason they dedicated a votive offering, which functioned as a ‘substitute’ offering for the real limb (which would other-wise have continued to suffer or waste away). Pazzini drew heavily on the Philistines passage from the Book of Samuel already singled out by Frey, which wove the anatomical votives into precisely this pattern of transgres-sion and expiation. The aforementioned passage from Aristides’ Hieroi Logoi was also useful to Pazzini, since it showed the logics of substitution 21 Potter and Wells (1985). For other examples of this approach see Roebuck (1951), 114– 15 (cited above, on the high numbers of eye votives found in the Asklepieion at Athens); Bernard and Vassal (1958); Marinatos (1960), 30; Chaviara- Karahalio (1990); Chaniotis (1995). A critique of this approach is Kuriyama (2000), who points out that similar morphologies are produced by a variety of diseases, while the tastes and the disproportionate interests of consumers in certain pathologies will have led to them being over- represented by ancient artists (the popular figure of the ‘hunchback’ is one good example). Furthermore, as Tim Potter has warned, features that appear pathological to modern viewers may not, in fact, have been recognised as such in antiquity, but may have been used instead as a means of personalising otherwise anonymous offerings through reference to the dedicant’s distinctive but healthy bodily features. Potter and Wells (1985). He suggests comparing the evidence from skeletal remains to build up a more accurate picture of ancient illness. "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"10Introduction: Fragments of History10(in this case, a ring being accepted instead of a real finger) at work in the ancient healing sanctuary.A number of book chapters and articles on votives have appeared over the years since Pazzini’s study was published, and interest in the topic has intensified over the past two decades.22 This is in part due to the systematic excavation and publication of new material, particularly from sites in central Italy, but also because these objects dovetail neatly with broader intellec-tual trends such as the rise in interest in gender and ‘the body’ as fields of analysis and, more recently, the development of the discipline of ‘material religion’.23 Alongside the continuing healthy interest in retrospective diag-nosis, the recent scholarship has also produced more oblique and creative perspectives on the relationship between the votives and the human body. Two contributions need singling out here, since they have certain themes and approaches in common with the current study. The first is Nicholas Ry n e a r s o n’s 2003 article ‘The Construction and Deconstruction of the Body in the Cult of Asklepios’, and the second is Alexia Petsalis- Diomidis’ work on Asklepios and Aelius Aristides. Both these scholars have suggested that the visual form of the votive might have other functions besides that of sim-ply indicating the location of illness and/ or cure. Focusing on votives from Classical Greek Asklepiea, Rynearson has perceptively argued that the frag-mented form of the anatomical votive served to contain as well as localise the illness, and that it contrasted with the whole, healed body of the dedicant.24 He suggests that this was a specifically ‘Asklepian’ form of representation, which finds parallels in inscriptional evidence from healing sanctuaries, namely the iamata inscriptions from Epidauros (see Chapter 2 below for further discussion). Petsalis- Diomidis has also engaged with the notion of fragmentation, suggesting that by classifying the body in parts the patient regained control over the sick body; her work also shifts focus away from the individual dedicant and onto later visitors to the sanctuary, exploring 22 An excellent sample of recent work in English can now be found in the collection of papers edited by Jane Draycott and Emma- Jayne Graham, Bodies of Evidence: Ancient Anatomical Votives Past, Present and Future, which had its genesis in a 2012 conference at the British School at Rome. I am very grateful to the editors and individual contributors for allowing me to read drafts of these chapters whilst I was preparing the final version of this book.

As Fay Glinister has neatly summarised:While it is certainly valid to attribute a healing connection to many anatomical terracottas, it is worth remembering that other, quite varied interpretations of these terracottas are possible. For example, although male genitals (and the much rarer female external genitals) may be connected with venereal diseases, or with aspects of fertility, they could also relate to rites of passage (e.g. puberty: examples are often infantile). Heads or half- heads could be associated with medical problems such as headaches or ear, nose and throat complaints, but they could also simply represent the worshipper. Feet could symbolize pilgrims, pilgrimages, or secular journeys; hands could represent prayer, or the power of a god. Ears could imply the willing-ness of a god to listen to human requests ... And so on.26In fact, some of the most interesting work on anatomical votives has been devoted to exploring alternative meanings for these objects, by carefully recontextualising them within their particular cultural and religious con-texts. Already in 1997 Joan Reilly suggested that the models of truncated female bodies represented on Attic grave stelai were anatomical votives ded-icated not at times of illness, but rather at the potentially dangerous moment of menarche, the first menstrual period (Figure 1.4).27 Attilio Mastrocinque has proposed that some of the head models from Italic sanctuaries might be seen as related to archaic Italic rituals of consecrating heads to the chthonic gods of the underworld.28 Georgia Petridou’s recent study of eye- models found in sanctuaries of Demeter and Kore reflects on the innate ambiguity and polyvalency of these objects, which she argues can be understood not only as references to a physical, opthalmological cure but also as ‘mementos of the intense visual experiences their dedicants may have had as part of 25 Esp.

In several places, the focus is shifted away from the dedicant and onto the effects that these objects had on their viewers, and how they may have accumulated additional, sometimes unin-tentional layers of meaning through their juxtaposition with other objects. I also develop Pazzini’s earlier triangulation of votives, punishment, and expiation. Inscriptions on the Lydian votive stelai discussed in Chapter 5 explicitly demonstrate the dedicant’s understanding that the sick body part has been punished by a god, and that the stele is being dedicated in recompense for a transgression; meanwhile, the visual imagery of votives from other parts of the ancient world brings them close to the imagery of mythical punishments. Thus, whilst I acknowledge that Pazzini’s complex theory is far from watertight or rigidly applicable, many of the interpre-tations offered in this book also make connections between votives and divine punishment.The book also picks up and develops the theme of fragmentation which other scholars have already identified as a fruitful area of analysis.30 One central aim is to force readers to recognise the shocking, unsettling, even violent qualities of the anatomical votives – qualities that tend to be sup-pressed in academic discussions of these objects. I argue throughout that these votives always have the potential to disturb, alarm, even disgust their 29 Petridou (2017), 111. 30 On fragmentation and the body in antiquity and later historical periods see Elsen (1969) (1969– 70); Pingeot (1990); Most (1992); the essays in Renaudin (1992); Nochlin (1994); duBois (1996); Kristeva (1998); Petrone and D’Onofrio (2004); Ferris (2007); Tronzo (2009); Adams (2017). "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"14Introduction: Fragments of History14viewers, by presenting them with pieces of a body that appears to have been dismembered. As we shall see, some of the votive body parts evoke violence more strongly than others; in fact, we might imagine the votives in this book arranged along a ‘dismemberment spectrum’ ranging from the lifesize fleshy coloured terracotta models at one end (‘strong’ images of dismemberment, which become even stronger when they are viewed collectively), to minia-ture metal offerings or images safely contained within ornate marble relief frames at the other (‘suppressed’ images of dismemberment). These latter, ‘suppressed’ examples disavow the threat of dismemberment by distanc-ing the body part from reality, but they do not dissipate it entirely. Instead, images of isolated body parts can always be seen in these potentially violent terms; even portrait busts – a deeply naturalised form of partial representa-tion that few of us would automatically associate with violence – can sud-denly be reassessed as images of decapitation, as Pliny’s famous description of the triumphal portrait head of Pompey bleakly demonstrates.31In addition to drawing attention to the ominous, unsettling qualities of the votive body parts, this book also seeks to demonstrate that the fragmen-tary form of the votives was a deeply meaningful form of representation, one which gave these objects multiple levels of symbolic meaning. At the most basic level, votive body parts drew the god’s (and the mortal view-ers’) attention to a particular part of an individual’s body – often a part that was sick, or had recently been healed. But the votive body parts were so much richer than this, and their fragmentary form meant that they could simultaneously reflect other aspects of the broader ancient discourse about human bodies (and their disassembly into pieces). It might help to remind ourselves here that the representation of the body in parts is not the only (nor indeed the most ‘natural’) way of indicating a particular part of the human body. Figure 1.6 depicts a pair of votive figurines from the site of Neapolis in Sardinia, which have been interpreted as images of sick peo-ple, dedicated for similar purposes as the votive body parts studied in this book.32 They belong to a much larger series of over 220 figurines dating from the fourth century bc and are thus roughly contemporary with the Classical Greek anatomical votives discussed in the next chapter of this book. Like the isolated votive body parts, these figurines successfully draw the viewer’s attention to one specific part of the body; however, unlike the 31 Pliny NH 37.14- 16 on the triumph of 61 bc. Cf. Beard (2007), 35, who notes that ‘the head of pearls in his greatest triumphal procession already presaged Pompey’s humiliating end’ (he was to be beheaded in 48 bc).

While the basic ‘localisation’ function of the votives is a constant throughout all historical periods, we will see how fragmentation often endows these objects with further symbolic reso-nances, helping them to communicate and dramatise scenarios such as the breakdown of the body in illness and its remaking as a whole or healthy body (Chapter 2), the formation of human- animal hybrids and the sym-bolic enactment of metamorphosis (Chapter 3), the conflict of gods versus mortals, or even mortals versus mortals (Chapter 4), and the symbolic vis-ualisation of an ‘imagined community’ or ‘body politic’ (Chapter 5).One important difference between this book and the earlier studies lies in the comparative approach adopted here, and the wide chronological and geographical scope that this involves. Most existing studies (with a few exceptions, such as the 1981 survey of votive body parts from across the ancient world by F. T. van Straten) have focused on anatomical votives from one particular site or region. This site- specific approach does have some advantages – for instance, it allows for the detailed cataloguing of votive objects in a single deposit, and shows how the anatomicals from that deposit fit into a particular constellation of objects and architecture. But at the same time, this approach does not bring out how far anatomical votives differ from place to place, and as a consequence it frequently underplays the unique properties of votives at the site in question. In fact, the liter-ature on anatomical votives often stresses the startling continuity of ana-tomical votives across time and space – not only within antiquity, but also throughout later history, and across different creeds and cultures. David Freedberg, for instance, dwells on the votives’ ‘striking internal consistency’ as a category, while Maria Fenelli (commenting on the Etrusco- Italic mate-rial discussed in Chapter 3 of this book) highlights their ‘surprising con-tinuity of forms’.33 Other studies of votives bear such titles as ‘The Formal Continuities between Ancient Donaria and Modern Ex- votos’ and ‘Traces of Cultural Continuity between Paganism and Christianity‘, again empha-sising notions of endurance and tradition.34 Some scholars have even seen the votives as evidence of universal cognitive frameworks: we hear them described as ‘very primitive ideas, rooted deep in a human, all- too- human essence across every time and every country’, while others note that ‘these 33 Freedberg (1989), 153; Fenelli (1975a), commenting on the ‘sorprendente continuità di forme’. 34 Capparoni (1927), original title ‘La persistenza delle forme degli antichi “Donaria” anatomici negli “ex- voto” moderni’; Rossi (1986), original title ‘Tracce di continuità culturale fra paganesimo e cristianesimo’ (my translations).

As this book will demonstrate, however, this empha-sis on continuity belies the many differences between the ancient anatom-ical votives – differences which can help us to reconstruct how the votives were adapted and modified to fit different craft traditions, as well as chang-ing beliefs about the human body and mortal– divine relations. We find votive body parts being represented in different materials – amongst them clay, stone, wood and precious metals – and at different scales (miniature, lifesize, and even colossal – see Figure 1.7). The range of body parts repre-sented also changes as we move around the ancient world: for instance, as we shall see, ancient Greek deposits include no representations of the inter-nal organs, while deposits from Roman Gaul include ‘novel’ representations of heads stacked one on top of another. Besides the claims made about frag-mentation, then, the other central contention of this study is the following: that tracking the differences between anatomical votives is useful, that it can highlight and help us to understand the unique qualities of votives at particular sites, and that, in showing how different populations received and reshaped the votive tradition, it can give us some valuable insight into changing beliefs about the ancient body.The juxtaposition of the following four case- studies is thus intended to make the reader notice and contemplate the differences between anatomi-cal votives, and to reflect on how their visual properties (the techniques of manufacture, materials, scale, iconography, the modes in which they were displayed and then disposed of, and so on) might tie into broader social and religious beliefs about bodies and material culture in those particular 35 The first citation is from Schlosser (1911), 72: ‘Es sind im Grund wieder ganz primitive Vorstellungen, die tief in menschlichen, allzumenschlichen Wesen aller Zeiten und Länder würzeln.’ I use the English translation of Didi- Hubermann (2007), 7– 8.

As already intimated, I pay particular attention to the types of body parts that appear in each of the case- studies, noting which body parts get introduced or phased out of the votive repertoire as the custom of dedi-cating anatomicals spreads around the ancient Mediterranean. Here, I have drawn on comments made by Mary Beard in her 2002 article ‘Did the Romans have Elbows?’, in which she used the example of the Roman arm to remind us that ‘different cultures classify (or construct) the “same” natural world in very different ways; that different societies choose to see (or to make significant) categories and distinctions that are literally invisible to o t h e r s ’.36 Beard focused her study on the different linguistic divisions of the parts of the arm in English, French and Latin, but it is not too hard to see how the comparison of visual representations of body parts across cultures might reveal similar discrepancies in ‘how the body’s naturally unbroken surfaces were given cultural boundaries’ in different places and periods.37 As this book will show, tracing these patterns in relation to anatomical offerings has the potential to reveal deep- seated cultural beliefs about how the human body could and should be divided, as well as signalling overlaps with other bodily discourses and practices.This is not, of course, a comprehensive history of votive offerings from antiquity: other deposits of anatomical votives exist in other parts of the ancient world, and these will hopefully provide material for future inves-tigations. Here, the selection of case- studies was driven in part by the strikingly different visual qualities of these groups of votives (their mate-rials, sculptural techniques and iconography) as well as by the availability of reliable publications – although the material in the first two chapters is significantly better known and more intensively studied than that in the latter two. One caveat about this broad scale of analysis is that it inevitably downplays the diversity within each unit of comparison: a different set of stories could be told of change within each of the four regions and time periods studied here, and indeed other existing studies focus in narrower detail on each of the areas under analysis here.38 It is also important to note that, although these four case- studies are presented as discrete data sets, the boundaries between them are permeable: anatomical votives and the peo-ple using them travelled along networks of cultural exchange, which may also help to explain why several of themes that emerge from the individual case studies also resonate across the other chapters. 36 Beard (2002), 48. 37 Beard (2002), 48. 38 For a discussion of the impact of scale on historical accounts of change, see Robb and Pauketat (2013). "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"22Introduction: Fragments of History22The next chapter of this book considers a selection of the clay, marble and metal anatomical votives that were dedicated in Greece during the fifth and fourth centuries bc. The votives studied here are not the earliest known examples (some Minoan votives date from as early as 2000– 1500 bc) but it is in this period that the anatomical cult becomes widespread, and these Classical sites provide us with our earliest relatively secure archaeological contexts. In this chapter, I explore the reasons behind the votives’ growth in popularity in this era, suggesting a number of congruent historical fac-tors that might have combined to provide a fertile background for their reintroduction, including changing votive habits, the introduction of new approaches to healing the body, and the proliferation in this period of images and texts that explored the deconstruction of the body into its con-situent pieces. After this, I move on to explore what these Classical Greek votives – many of which were found in sanctuaries of Asklepios or other healing deities – might reveal about contemporary understandings of the sick and healed body. And I argue that a focus on fragmentation can open up a whole range of possible new resonances for the votives, including the evocation of the physical disintegration of the suffering body, the construc-tion of healing as a process of reintegration of the previously broken body, and the materialisation of links between illness and divine punishment.Chapter 3 moves across the Mediterranean to look at votives from cen-tral Italy in the Hellenistic or Republican period (the fourth– first centuries bc). The material in this chapter is probably the most well- known of all ancient votives: thousands of terracotta body parts have been excavated from sanctuaries in the regions of Etruria, Latium and Campania, and these objects have generated a great deal of interest amongst archaeologists and historians over the past two or three decades. Focusing on the novel rep-resentations of internal organs, which were absent from the Classical Greek deposits, I explore how these terracotta objects might be seen to reflect longer term visual traditions of representing and understanding the human body. I compare the internal votive models to the strong local traditions of representing animal innards in context of sacrifice and extispicy (the ritual use of animal entrails for prophecy). These rituals made the internal organs both salient and familiar to Etrusco- Italic populations, and also provided visual prototypes for the votive models which depicted the human vis-cera. The overlap between votives and animal sacrifice also introduces the themes of human- animal hybridity and metamorphosis, suggesting a new perspective on how both individual objects and the assemblage as a whole impacted on ancient visitors to the Etrusco- Italic sanctuary. This material also prompts us to consider possible reasons for the non- representation of "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"23New Approaches23inner organs in Classical Greek contexts, drawing attention to the different Greek and Etruscan ideas about how the body could and should be repre-sented visually, and intimating further possible differences in the religious and medical views of the two cultures.Chapter 4 focuses on votive body parts in Roman Gaul. Current evi-dence suggests that the anatomical votive cult was imported into Gaul by the Romans after the annexation of the province in the mid- first century bc, with the practice of dedicating anatomicals soon being adopted by local Gallic communities. As such, the transmission of votives to Gaul has often been described in terms of a one- sided process of ‘Romanisation’ – which might be taken to imply the dissemination of a central, Classical body image to ‘marginal’ populations who lacked their own traditional ways of repre-senting the body. This chapter uses the votive evidence to problematise this simple narrative of transmission, partly by highlighting differences between Gallic and Italic assemblages, but also by drawing attention to some striking resemblances between the Gallic votives and earlier objects and practices from pre- Roman Gaul. Noting these continuities with earlier local tradi-tions allows us to explore how the new votive cult may have mapped onto or reconfigured existing bodily practices in the area, and indicates some of the additional (and potentially discrepant) meanings that these fragmentary objects may have held for their dedicants and viewers. For instance, I dis-cuss the possibility that the anatomical votives may have been appropriated for reasons of conflict and violence, drawing attention to similarities with the Gallic ‘head cult’ and noting the presence, in the votive deposit, of other objects which remind us that the sanctuary could be a space for expressing conflict as well as healing.Chapter 5 takes us onwards and eastwards to the Roman provinces of Lydia and Phrygia, to a group of free- standing marble stelai that were ded-icated in rural sanctuaries there during the first, second and third centuries ad. These stelai are somewhat different to the other objects studied in this book, since they bear inscriptions that recount complex narratives of trans-gression, punishment and propitiation. These detailed textual commentar-ies give us an unprecedented opportunity to hear the voices of dedicants of votive body parts, removing some of the ambiguity and anonymity that characterises the votives studied in the previous chapters. I look at how the images of body parts relate to the written texts on the stelai, identifying a number of ‘meta- narrative’ themes that resonate across the whole group of stelai. The foremost of these themes is that of the ‘body politic’ – the notion that the body part image served to link its dedicant to his or her wider community, which was symbolically analogous to a whole, macrocosmic "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"24Introduction: Fragments of History24human body composed of many interrelated parts. The body politic is, of course, a much older theme in ancient literary tradition, and one that might be seen as applicable to the votive material discussed in earlier chapters, too. In fact, the discussion of Chapter 5 brings out some further elements of continuity with earlier Classical beliefs, such as the links between human illness and divine punishment and the notion of inherited trangression. In this way, the material of this final chapter gestures back to the first case- study of the book, whilst simultaneously looking forward to a Christian world in which anatomical offerings would continue to be used as conduits for a new sort of divine healing."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"25252 Fragmentation as Metaphor: Anatomical Votives in Classical Greece, Fifth– Fourth Centuries bcIn his 1953 book The Discovery of the Mind in Greek Philosophy and Literature, Bruno Snell described what he saw as a fundamental change in representations of the human body between the Archaic and Classical periods.1 In Homeric literature, Snell noted, the body had been described as a collection of individual limbs, denoted by plural nouns such as guia (‘the limbs as moved by the joints’) and mele (‘the limbs in their strength’); instead, by the fifth century, the body had become the soma – a singu-lar phenomenon, perceived as a totality. Snell argued that this same shift between an Archaic ‘body multiple’ and a Classical ‘body singular’ could be traced in the visual arts too: for while Classical artists of the fifth century represented the body as ‘an organic unit whose parts are mutually corre-lated’, the figures on earlier Geometric vases were ‘nothing but μέλεα καὶ γυῖα, i.e. limbs with strong muscles, separated from each other by means of exaggerated joints’.Snell’s neat picture of change is complicated by the votive body parts studied in this chapter, which indicate that the Classical body was also sometimes conceived as a collection of separate limbs and other body parts. Anatomical votives became widespread as dedications throughout Attica and the rest of the Greek mainland during the fourth century bc, although some examples may date from as early as the last quarter of the fifth cen-tury. These models were made from marble, clay or metal, and they seem to have been particularly common dedications in sanctuaries of Asklepios and other healing deities, although several other gods and goddesses also received anatomical votives from their worshippers. This chapter aims to provide some background to these Classical Greek models, exploring the broader cultural contexts for the growth and early popularity of the ana-tomical votive cult. After introducing a selection of votives from two of the largest and most important Asklepieia, I consider how these objects might relate to other emergent ways of seeing and representing the human body as a system of closely interlinked but ultimately detachable parts. I then offer 1 Snell (1953), 6– 8. For a more recent study of the Homeric body, see Gavrylenko (2012). "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"26Fragmentation as Metaphor26an interpretation of the anatomical votives which builds on their visual appearance as bodily fragments. In particular, I suggest that the fragmen-tation of the body in the sanctuary gave visual form and social meaning to the otherwise intensely personal experience of illness; I also argue that this symbolic dismemberment played a dynamic functional role in the process of healing, which was metaphorically conceived as the reintegration of the dedicant’s broken body.Gifts to the Greek GodsVotives in the shape of human body parts appeared in Greece much ear-lier than the Classical period.2 Miniature clay body parts were already being used in the Middle Minoan period (2000– 1650 bc) at sites such as Petsofa, Mount Juktas, and Palaikastro on Crete (Figure 2.2).3 These tiny clay body parts were moulded by hand, and were often pierced, as though for suspension from a cord or nail. Most of these models represent human heads and limbs, but we also find arms attached to a portion of the trunk and a group of male half- figures that were split along a vertical section from head to groin. These early anatomical models are often presumed to have a healing significance, like many of their later Greek counterparts.4 However, other possibilities have also been raised. Martin Nilsson won-dered whether these Minoan miniatures might be related to the cult of the Mistress of the Animals, who is represented on Geometric vases with the detached parts of animal bodies (particularly legs and heads, which also appeared on Minoan gems).5 And he tentatively suggested that these Minoan objects might have been dedicated in the context of ‘fire festivals’ that formed one element of the cult of the Greek Mistress of the Animals, noting that the votive body parts had been thrown onto a bonfire and burnt together with statuettes of both wild and domestic animals. Such an interpretation is – as Nilsson himself admitted – necessarily specula-tive, but it does alert us to the possibility that these objects were used for purposes other than bodily healing. It also highlights the juxtaposition of 2 On Greek anatomical votives see Rouse (1902), 210– 16; Forsén (1996); Rynearson (2003); Cole (2004), 171– 4; Forsén (2004).

There are a few examples of anatomical votives dating to intervening periods, such as the miniature metal body parts from the Archaic Temple of Artemis at Ephesos (see Figure 5.6 below), but this does not necessarily support the idea that the anatomical votive ritual ‘survived’ into Classical Greek times, as opposed to being ‘reinvented’. And in fact the Minoan and Classical votives are visually quite different, with the later offerings being much closer to lifesize, and normally taking the form of marble reliefs (see Figures 2.3 and 2.4). Some Classical- era clay offerings were recovered from the sanctuary of Asklepios at Corinth, but again these are closer to life-size, and represent a much wider range of body parts in comparison to Figure 2.1 Map of Greece showing main sites discussed in the text.

These Corinthian votives, which will be discussed further below, are amongst the earliest examples of Classical anatomicals, and date to between the last quarter of the fifth and the last quarter of the fourth century bc.

However, other gods without an explicit connection to healing also received offerings of body parts, such as Herakles Pankrates, Artemis Kalliste and Ariste, and Eros and Aphrodite. The reader is referred to Forsén’s comprehensive catalogue for an illustrated discussion of this material: here, the discussion will focus on the two sanctuaries which have furnished us with most of our evidence for anatomical votives in the Classical period – the Asklepieia of Corinth and marble dedications is the Asklepieion on the south slope of the Acropolis in Athens (49 pieces). Indeed, it has been suggested that the Greek anatomical votive cult originated in Attica ‘in the period of the great building programmes and the flourishing sculptors’ workshops [fifth– fourth centuries bc]’. Chaniotis (1998). This is possible, but at the same time it is worth noting that many of the Attic votives can be dated to later eras: of the 49 votives from the Asklepieion at Athens, for instance, only two have been dated to the Classical period, while all 23 marble votives found at the nearby site of Zeus Hypsistos have been dated by inscription to the period between the first and third centuries ad.

Both sanctuaries were developed in the last decades of the fifth century bc, in a phase of expansion of the Asklepios cult from the god’s ‘birthplace’ of Epidauros.The cult of Asklepios was imported into Athens from Epidauros in the 420s bc, when the plague of Athens and the ongoing Pelopponesian War had greatly reduced the city’s population.7 There are few structural remains 7 On the introduction of Asklepios to Athens see Aleshire (1989), 8– 12; Garland (1992), 116– 35; Clinton (1994), 17– 34; Parker (1996), 175– 85; Wickkiser (2008), 67– 72.

The other side of the relief depicts an interior space occupied by Asklepios and Hygeia, a column, surgical instruments and votive offerings. This space may have provided a space for suppliants to sleep – incubation was a characteris-tic of the cult of Asklepios, and its use at Athens is suggested by the passage this time: the phenomenon of ‘rational’ physicians turning away patients who were suffering from chronic ailments, and contemporary Athenian civic policies of expansion, especially in regard to the acquisition of new territory. As she argues in the conclusion to her study on Asklepios, Medicine and the Politics of Healing in Fifth- Century Greece, ‘the importation of Epidauros’ most famous god presented a convenient step toward bringing Epidauros under Athenian control, a goal expressed by Athens repeatedly in the 420s in its attempts to take Epidauros by force.’ Wickkiser (2008), 107.

The body parts were dedicated by both men and women throughout the whole period rep-resented by the inventories; they have been studied by van Straten (whose 1981 list of types and quantities is reproduced in Table 2.1) and by Sara Aleshire in her two monographs on the Athenian Asklepieion.15Aleshire argued in her 1991 study that the order of the inventory inscrip-tions might be used to reconstruct how the votive offerings were displayed in the interior of the temple.16 It seems that the votives were hung on the rafters and ridge beam of the roof, and in rows on the bottom half of the temple walls; the upper portion of the walls, Aleshire concludes, was proba-bly filled by frescoes or paintings on boards. The anatomical votives appear to have been mixed together with the other types of offerings, although certain types of dedication seem to have been concentrated in certain areas of the interior.17 For instance, the typoi seem to have been located mainly on the left wall, while the anatomical votives appear to have clustered in the bottom two rows of votives on the right wall. The more valuable offerings such as vases, crowns and jewellery were displayed on the rafters, while a number of small objects (eight sealstones and a gold typos) are described as located in the hand of the cult statue itself. This vision of the divinity ‘taking’ his offerings may have reassured viewers of the god’s receptivity to their own votive gift, and his participation in the contract that it marked.In addition to the metal votives mounted on the walls of the Asklepieion temple, other votives were displayed around the sanctuary outside.

Large deposits of votives were found in the drain channel of the early sanctuary, in the western well north of the temple and in the packing against the foundations of the abaton (‘dormitory’) build-ing.27 These deposits contained many terracotta figurines and body parts, together with coins, lamps and pottery fragments which could be dated to between the last quarter of the fifth century and the last quarter of the fourth century bc.

After firing, they were covered with slip; in some cases, painted colour was then added to a base of white sizing. This was sometimes used to indicate gender: the penises were for the most part painted red, while breasts were left white, a schema which corresponded to the gendered Contrastcoloristik of contemporary vase painting.28 The majority of the Corinthian votives are highly naturalistic, with their size, colour and three- dimensional modelling functioning to narrow the perceptual distance between ‘real’ and ‘repre-sented’ bodies. The occasional striking departure from realism is found, too, such as the blue pubic hair on one of the penis models, a hand painted partly red and partly black, and gilded models of the eyes and male genitals.29 This use of unrealistic colours, gilding and body markings might be intended to 24 Roebuck (1951), 10– 12.

The heads and chests have flat bases, indicating that they may have rested on shelves in the temple, or even on the floor. Most of the smaller body parts (including the breasts, male genitals, eyes and ears) are mounted on relief plaques, which are pierced for suspension in the corners or at the top. The arms and hands and most of the legs and feet are also pierced, perhaps for suspension from the walls or ceiling of the temple. The lack of oxidisation around the holes suggests that leather thongs rather than metal nails were used for this purpose. Roebuck notes that ‘it is likely that suspension against a wall was normal, for frequently only one side of the hand shows details and some of the arms are flattened on the inner side’.30 Figure 2.7 Terracotta votive breasts from the Asklepieion at Corinth, late fifth– fourth centuries bc. 30 Roebuck (1951), 116.

"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"40Fragmentation as Metaphor40Changing Beliefs about the Human BodyWhat factors might help us to understand the (re)appearance and subse-quent spread of votive body parts in Classical Greece? One relevant con-text must surely be the growth and development of the cult of Asklepios, which provided a formal religious framework for divine healing and for the dedication of votive offerings intended to initiate or commemorate those healing events. According to mythical tradition, Asklepios was the son of Apollo and a mortal woman, who had received his medical training from Cheiron the centaur. Asklepios had appeared as a (mortal) healer in Homer’s Iliad, but it was not until the fifth century that his worship became widespread in the Greek world.32 While there has been a considerable amount of debate about the origins and dissemination of the Asklepios cult, most scholars agree that the sanctuary at Epidauros – the god’s legendary Figure 2.8 (cont.) 32 Homer Iliad 2.729– 32. On Asklepios see Edelstein and Edelstein (1945), and LIMC II, 863– 97 (entry by Bernard Holtzmann). "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"41Changing Beliefs about the Human Body41birthplace – played a crucial role in the early phase of expansion and devel-opment.33 In the second half of the fifth century bc, a number of other city- states imported the cult and built new sanctuaries to Asklepios, amongst them Corinth and Athens, and it is at these sites, as we have seen already in this chapter, that the earliest Classical anatomical votives have been found.The rapid growth in Asklepios’ popularity in the fifth century provided, then, the background to the new votive offerings dedicated in relation to illness and healing. Certainly, our understanding of the anatomical votives is enhanced when we consider them against the background of Asklepian worship, as Nicholas Rynearson has demonstrated in his 2003 article on ‘The Construction and Deconstruction of the Body in the Cult of Asklepios’. Rynearson identifies some convincing conceptual parallels between the ana-tomical votives and other elements of the nascent cult of Asklepios, namely the famous group of iamata inscriptions from the Asklepieion at Epidauros – the narratives of miraculous cures which were inscribed on stone stelai in the fourth century bc and displayed within the Epidauros sanctuary.34 As we shall see in more detail below, the iamata stelai describe healing events that took place while, or shortly after, the worshippers slept in the sacred aba-ton; the cures are often performed by Asklepios himself, who is described cutting out sick eyes, removing spearheads from jaws, and evicting worms and leeches from the patients’ bodies. Rynearson uses these two types of evidence (the iamata and the votive body parts) to reconstruct a specifi-cally Asklepian view of the body, in which illness and cure were both under-stood as strictly localised phenomena. In other words, just as the fragmented visual form of the votive effectively contained the illness and cure within one discrete part of the body, so the written texts of the iamata inscriptions often presented the god working directly on a single body part, such as a diseased eye or jaw. Rynearson further contrasts this Asklepian body image with the contemporary Hippocratic, humoral view, in which the human body was seen as a whole and integrated system, and in which the role of the healer was ‘to restore the proper proportion, mixture or movement of the body’s h u m o r s ’.35 33 For the spread of the Asklepios cult from Epidauros, see Melfi (2007). Her interpretation contrasts with that of Riethmüller (2005), who gives the Asklepios cult a Thessalian origin. See Riethmüller (2009) esp. 229– 40 with Renberg (2009). 34 LiDonnici (1995).

Melfi (2007), 35, who notes the paucity of both anatomical votives and votive reliefs, and comments that this shows the singularity of the Epidaurian version of the cult of Asklepios. "},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"42Fragmentation as Metaphor42However, even though the cult of Asklepios forms part of the background for the votive body parts, it cannot by itself explain their genesis. This becomes clear when we look at other developments in dedicatory practices during the Classical period. Anthony Snodgrass has pointed out that there was an abrupt shift in the nature of dedications at the end of the Archaic period, which he characterises in terms of a dichotomy between ‘raw’ and ‘converted’ offer-ings.36 ‘Raw’ offerings are defined in this context as unmodified objects of secular use, such as weapons of war, vessels and jewellery, which may have been used for some time before their dedication, ‘Converted’ offerings, on the other hand, are defined as objects commissioned and produced specifically for the purposes of dedication, such as inscribed plaques, statuettes – and anatomical votives. It is not the case that all Archaic offerings were ‘raw’, and all post- Archaic offerings were ‘converted’; nevertheless ‘the overall balance between “raw” and “converted” appears to have undergone a reversal in the early fifth century’.37 Snodgrass also notes that ‘converted’ offerings by their nature require a greater financial outlay than raw ones, since the dedicant pays for the materials and for the professional labour needed to transform those materials into an offering; he therefore suggests that this shift might be related to broader socio- economic factors, such as the decline of the egalitar-ian ethos of the early polis, and the increasing use of the sanctuary as an arena for competitive self- display in the Classical period.38 Ultimately, Snodgrass’s analysis reminds us that the anatomical votives were not an isolated phe-nomenon, and that they should be seen in the light of a contemporary taste for offerings that were made especially for dedication. But again, ‘converted’ offerings could take many forms, even within the narrower context of the healing sanctuary. The iamata inscriptions at Epidauros, for instance, men-tion amongst the offerings left by worshippers a silver pig, a snake, a goose, an athlete, horses and a chariot.39 The particular choice of form for the anatomi-cal offering therefore also requires explanation.In fact, when we look at other texts and images from the late Archaic and Classical periods it becomes apparent that the relationship between the whole body and its parts was a more general source of fascination and sym-bolism for contemporary writers and artists. One particularly compelling 36 Snodgrass (1989– 90); Osborne (2004), 2. 37 Snodgrass (1989– 90), 292. 38 Snodgrass (1989– 90), 293. He also suggests that the dedication of raw offerings signalled the subordination of private interest to public in the new democratic constitution (the same period saw the abandonment of costly offerings in private graves). 39 For the offerings mentioned in the iamata see LiDonnici (1995), 44, table 1. Other objects in the list appear to belong to Snodgrass’ category of ‘raw’ offerings: a ladder, a medicine bottle, an operating table and a cup. "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"43Changing Beliefs about the Human Body43literary example comes from the work of the philosopher Empedocles who in his work On Nature recounted an early stage of human evolution in which ‘many neckless heads sprang up, bare arms wandered bereft of shoul-ders, and eyes wandered alone, destitute of faces’.40 Empedocles described how these isolated body parts wandered about on their own for a time, before spontaneously combining to form whole, complex beings. This ver-sion of the evolution of the human species echoed Empedocles’ theory of human foetal development, wherein separate, fully formed body parts came together inside the mother’s womb to create an individual body – which in turn, we might note, echoed aspects of new contemporary processes of statue production (cf. Figure 2.10 below).41Other Classical bodies- in- parts appear in the sphere of political rhetoric, in the form of explicit analogies between human society at large and the individual human body. As Roger Brock has explained, these analogies fall into two broad categories: some describe the anatomy of the human body in terms of a city or state (‘the political body’), while others describe the city or state in the anatomical terms of the human body (the so- called ‘body poli-tic’).42 These complex and interrelated metaphors have a long post- Classical history, and constitute a rich source for uncovering ancient ideas about physiology and politics alike. Here, they simply provide another example of Classical thinkers exploring the body as a whole system which is divided into elements that are simultaneously discrete and interacting. Perhaps the best- known Classical version of the ‘political body’ metaphor occurs in P l a t o’s Timaeus, where the body is divided up into three parts (head, chest/ heart, and abdomen/ groin) whose functions mirror the tripartite structure of the city- state.43 Meanwhile, early representations of the polis or state as a human body appear in two fifth- century oracles cited by Herodotus. The 40 Empedocles frag. B57. See Sedley (2003). 41 For Empedocles’ theory of embryology see Aristotle De generatione animalium 722b 9; Plutarch De sollertia animalium 946E. For further discussion of the relationship between Empedoclean embryology and zoogony see Gemelli Marciano (2005), esp. 383– 6. 42 See Brock (2000) and (2006): he describes how the evidence for ‘the polis as body’ considerably antedates ‘the body as polis’, and how, while the former is widespread in Greek literature, the latter has a much more particular and specialised distribution. Brock (2006), 351. See also Squire (2015). 43 Timaeus 70ab. We learn that ‘the divine soul is located in the head and the mortal soul in the chest, the former separated and quarantined from the latter by the neck’, with the torso further partitioned by the diaphragm into male and female quarters. As Brock (2006), 356, has pointed out, ‘Plato’s model of monarchy in the body is less physiological than psychic, since it is grounded fundamentally on the right of the soul to rule the body.’ However, ‘occasionally he expresses this principle in physical terms, drawing on his belief in the head as the seat of conciousness’. Contra this ‘superficial analogy’ of the Body Politic, which ‘still exerts considerably influence in modern school of sociology’ see Delanda (2006).

The iconic statue of the Doryphoros by Polykleitos and the name vase of the Foundry Painter might be used as examples here (Figures 2.9 and 2.10). The Doryphoros is conventionally seen to embody the principles of Polykleitos’ famous Canon, which drew on the Classical doctrine of symmetria – that is, ‘the commen-surability of one part to another, and of all the parts to a whole, in an artis-tic design’.46 The earlier ‘Foundry Vase’ also documents an interest in how statues were literally constructed from pieces.47 On the right- hand side of the detail shown in Figure 2.10 we see a sculptor working on an incom-plete bronze statue whose head lies on the floor, while models of human hands and feet hang on the wall above. These hanging body parts closely assimilate the anatomical votives that we see on later vases and relief- sculp-tures (cf. Figures 2.8, 2.11), and this ambiguity may have been enhanced by their proximity to the votive pinakes (‘tablets’) hanging underneath the long curving horns by the furnace. Meanwhile, the headless statue- in- progress is depicted in the new ‘naturalistic’ style, and its depiction on the vase height-ens the ambiguity between art and life: the statue’s hands are outstretched as if to shield it from the blow of the craftsman’s hammer, while the disem-bodied head on the floor is placed so that it appears to look up between the older man’s legs. The boundary between art and life was another central topos in Classical art, and one that holds great relevance for the anatomical votives too, as we shall see later in this chapter.48 44 Oracle to Argives: Herodotus 7.148. 3.

The votive body parts have been displayed in approximately the ‘cor-rect’ order, with the result that they both mirror and fragment the body of the woman kneeling beside them. Moreover, the visual similarities between the two bodies force the viewer to contemplate the relationship between them – the votive head turns to face in the same direction as the dedicant; likewise, the pair of disembodied arms mirror the dedicant’s ‘real’ arms in their gesture of supplication.This relief is deeply significant in the present context, because it shows that people in antiquity – in this case the sculptor and/ or the commissioning 51 One much later (first– third century ad) votive image of the abdomen and thigh area from the sanctuary of Zeus Hypsistos on the Pnyx in Athens is virtually identical to the version on the relief, indicating a conservatism in types over the centuries that separate the two examples.

All anatomical votives can always potentially be seen as fragments, but this relief unambiguously shows the votive body parts as corresponding to the ‘real’ parts of a dedicant’s broken body.52 Anyone who looked at the relief would have been encouraged to read the other ana-tomical votives on display in the sanctuary in the same light, that is, as representing pieces of a disaggregated body or bodies. The rest of this chap-ter will explore the resonances of such fragmentation in the context of the ancient Greek healing sanctuary.Fragmentation as MetaphorSomewhat surprisingly, scholars working on the votive body parts have never explored the possibility that the fragmentation of the body might have been understood as a metaphorical representation of the body in illness and pain.53 In discourses on illness in our own society, the fragmentation meta-phor looms large. Even a cursory glance through autobiographical accounts of suffering like those collected in Arthur Kleinman‘s The Illness Narratives shows how frequently the metaphor is evoked. Patients often describe their bodies or their identities as ‘broken’ and ‘shattered’, or as ‘split apart’.54 One of Kleinman’s patients says of his body that what he needs ‘is a kind of glue to hold the pieces together’.55 Similar vocabulary is used in theoret-ical writing about illness. Eric Cassell, for instance, explains that ‘Suffering occurs when an impending destruction of the person is perceived; it con-tinues until the threat of disintegration has passed or until the integrity of the person can be restored in some other manner.’56 The imagery of frag-mentation is also evoked in modern visual representations of illness. In Frida Kahlo’s 1944 painting The Broken Column, the image of the broken 52 Subtly different interpretations of this scene might be offered. For instance, the dedicant might have had a succession of illnesses in different parts of her body; or the votives might represent parts of different bodies, dedicated by a succession of worshippers. But whatever the story behind the scene, the similarities between the individual votives and the body of the kneeling woman remain – the same would also be true even if the (now fragmentary) relief was originally much larger and included other body parts. 53 I follow Sontag in my use of the term metaphor: ‘By metaphor I mean nothing more or less than the earlier and most succinct definition I know, which is Aristotle’s in his Poetics (1457b). “Metaphor,” Aristotle wrote, “consists in giving the thing a name that belongs to something else.’ ” Sontag (1989), 5. 54 Kleinman (1988), 37 and 61. 55 Kleinman (1988), 61. 56 Cassell (1991), 33. "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"49Fragmentation as Metaphor49column bears a direct relation to the pathology of the sufferer, transposing and dramatising the real rupture of Kahlo’s spine.57 Meanwhile, a painting by George Dergalis titled Anguish, which featured in a 1989 exhibition of ‘Headache Art’, shows the subject’s face broken into three kaleidoscopic segments, reproducing something of the experience of migraine, including the sensation of violent splitting, the distortion of normal vision and the dissolution of personal identity.58Perhaps it is because the fragmentation metaphor is so prominent in modern accounts of illness that scholars have been reluctant to pursue its relevance to the ancient votive material, presuming it to be too banal and ahistorical an observation to make explicitly. On the other hand, it is often true that the more banal a metaphor appears, the more pressing the need for its interrogation. Susan Sontag’s work has demonstrated how meta-phorical representations of illness – no matter how natural and appropriate they may seem at first sight – always distort the stark biological ‘facts’, often infusing disease with a moral or ideological component.59 Moreover, the symbolic fragmentation of the body can also be perceived in texts about illness from the Classical period, a fact that serves to mitigate any fears that in reading the votives as metaphorical images of illness we are simply retrojecting aspects of the modern discourse onto the ancient evidence. We might invoke, for example, Thucydides’ famous description of the Athenian plague of 430 bc:Suddenly and while in good health, men were seized at first with intense heat of the head, and redness and inflammation of the eyes and the parts inside the mouth, both the throat and the tongue immediately became blood- red and exhaled an unnatural and fetid breath. ... In a short time the disorder descended to the chest, attended by severe coughing. And when it settled in the stomach, that was upset, and vomits of bile of every kind named by physicians ensued ... If they passed the crisis, the disease went into the bowels, producing there a violent ulceration. ... It attacked the privates and the fingers and toes, and many escaped with the loss of these, although some lost their eyes also.60In this passage, the description of the plague is formulated as a consecutive list of symptoms localised on the sufferers’ bodies. The verbal enunciation of the subject’s body parts here leads to an ‘imaginary’ fragmentation that ‘undoes’ the body in a similar fashion to the much later poetic genre of 57 Fundacion Dolores Olmedo, Mexico City, DF, Mexico. 58 Reproduced at Morris (1991), fig. 1, with discussion at pp. 10– 11. 59 Sontag (1978). 60 Thucydides 2.49.

A pessary relieved these symptoms, but there was pain in the head, neck and loins.’ On the tenth day there were ‘severe pains in the legs; pain again at the stomach; heaviness in the head’.63 Another man lying sick in the gar-den of Delearces ‘had for a long time heaviness in the head and pain in the right temple’. On the fourth day he suffered from ‘sweat about the head and collar- bones, spleen enlarged, pain in the direction of the thigh, and ten-sion, soft underneath, of the right hypochondrium’. The ninth day brought ‘squinting of the right eye; tongue dry’; the fifteenth day ‘pain in the knees and legs’; the twenty- seventh day ‘pain in the right hip’; and the twenty- ninth day ‘pain in the right eye’.64In these descriptions, the sufferers’ bodies are figuratively dismembered and redistributed through the written text. This narrative technique may be seen to reflect the passivity of the patient in the hands of the physician, mir-roring in words the physical breakdown of the ill body and the sensation of fractured identity. It is interesting to note that similar anatomical lists are used to describe disturbed, disordered bodies in other genres of ancient text. For instance, some Greek and Roman defixiones (‘curse tablets’) list the various parts of the body that are to be bound, stabbed, chilled, twisted or transformed to lead. As Henk Versnel has explained in an illuminating study, some of these texts specify ‘the parts of the body that may help their owner to gain an advantage over the author of the curse’ (most commonly the hands, feet and tongue, as well as the soul and mind), while others offer longer lists of virtually every part of the human body.65 Versnel cites 61 On the blason and its capacity to fragment the (female) body see Michelson (1984); Pacteau (1994), 25– 31 and 57– 72; Sawday (1995); Vickers (1997), with further bibliography on the French anatomical blazon at n. 3. 62 On the Epidemics see Langholf (1990). For the relationship between Thucydides’ description of the plague and the Hippocratic texts see Craik (2001), with bibliography at n. 1. Jouanna describes the Hippocratic principle of classifying diseases a capite ad calcem (from head to foot). For instance, the nosological treatises Diseases II and Internal Affections ‘begin with diseases of the head, moving on to diseases of the throat and nose; next come the disease of the breast and back’. Jouanna (1999), 145. 63 Epidemics book 1, case 5. 64 Epidemics book 3, case 3. 65 Versnel (1998), citation on p. 218. Most of the ‘anatomical curses’ discussed by Versnel date from post- classical times, but some examples from Classical Greece are also included, e.g. DTA 77 and DTA 89, both from Attica.

In turn, Page duBois draws attention to the figurative dismemberment of the body in Sappho’s Poem 31, in which the lover her-self ‘sees the disorder in the body in love, sees herself objectified as a body in pieces, disjointed, a broken set of organs, limbs, bodily functions’.67 The ‘emblasoning’ of the sick body in the texts of Thucydides and Hippocrates therefore provides just one more example of a widespread ancient fashion for representing the dysfunctional, troubled body – a literary conceit that was, I would argue, given visual form in the anatomical votive assemblage, where the normal proportions of the body were collapsed, and the order and relationship of its parts reconfigured.The discussion so far has suggested that the fragmentary form of the ana-tomical votives might be seen to correspond to representations of illness in written texts from the fifth and fourth centuries bc, thereby indicating one additional layer of meaning that would have been available to the dedicants and later viewers of the anatomical votives. This observation may be rele-vant to anatomical votives in other periods too, for as we have already seen, the representation of illness as fragmentation is not a uniquely Classical phenomenon. However, the form of the anatomical votives also overlapped with other aspects of the Classical discourse on illness and healing, in par-ticular the representation of illness as a punishment inflicted by a deity, and the process of healing as one of reintegration following disassembly.A succinct illustration of the link between bodily fragmentation and divine punishment is found in a number of rather gruesome red- figure vases which were produced in Athens at the beginning of the fifth century bc, and which illustrated the dismemberment (sparagmos) of the Theban king Pentheus by the bacchants of Dionysus. These vases represent a strik-ing departure from the normal Greek iconography of death, where the whole, beautiful body is shown at the ‘pregnant moment’ just before suffer-ing any irrevocable physical mutilation (cf. Figure 3.19).68 One red- figure 66 Cited at Versnel (1998), 224, n. 22. 67 DuBois (1996), 60. 68 For a selection of examples and discussion see Cohen (2000).

On another vase dated to c.480 bc and attributed to the painter Douris, Dionysus is shown in the company of bacchants, one of whom waves a lower leg, while another two each hold thick chunks of human thigh. On the opposite side of the vase, another bacchant waves Pentheus’ other lower leg, while her two companions prepare to rip his head and torso right down the middle (Figure 2.13).69At this point, we might return to the votive relief from the Asklepieion depicted at Figure 2.11, to note the striking parallels between this scene and the vases representing Pentheus’ dismemberment. Both the vases and the relief show a human body dismantled into parts. In appearance, these parts are very similar – in fact, the closest Classical parallel we can find to the ‘head and shoulders’ shape in the Asklepieion relief is the image of Pentheus’ torso shown on the vase painted by Douris.

These vases incite their viewers to mentally reconstruct the shattered jigsaw of Pentheus’ body – in the one shown in Figure 2.13 this would have necessitated the viewer turning the vase over in his or her hands, since here the king’s body is dis-tributed all over the vase’s surface.The parallels between these images of Pentheus’ death and the votive relief from the Athens Asklepieion have some far- reaching implications. On one level, they give further support to the argument that votive body parts in the relief would have been perceived as evoking dismembered parts of a previously whole body: for not only does the choice and arrange-ment of the votives within the relief conjure up the image of a fragmented ‘body- in- pieces’, but the representation also borrows the established visual language of the mythical sparagmos. Perhaps more importantly, the overlaps between the scenes remind us that the dismembered body had a particular cultural and religious meaning for ancient viewers – one that involved the recognition of divine power over the mortal body, and implications of divine retribution.71 Pentheus was dismembered because he had offended Dionysus – while the sparagmos was undertaken by the women of Thebes, it was motivated by the god himself. Other sparag-mos myths follow the same thematic structure, whereby the protagonist incites divine anger, and the god subsequently sets in motion a sequence of events which culminate in the mortal’s dismemberment. For instance, the hunter Actaeon angered Artemis, either because he boasted that he was a better hunter than she was (this is the version recorded in Euripides’ Bacchae) or because he had gazed upon her naked body, after which the goddess turned him into a stag, and he was ripped to pieces by his own hounds.72 Hippolytus, likewise, offended Aphrodite by valuing his chastity 70 On the relationship between fragmentation and beauty, see Pacteau (1994). 71 We might also remember this sanctuary’s topographical location just to the west of the Theatre of Dionysus. Dionyus himself was closely connected to sparagmos – being both agent and object of dismemberment; meanwhile, the myths associated with sparagmos would have been enacted within the space of the theatre, in close proximity to the Asklepieion sanctuary and the images of corporeal fragmentation that it contained. 72 Euripides Bacchae 336– 40.

Even more importantly, the disarticulation of the body in these sparagmos myths was framed as a punitive measure against a mortal’s contravention of divine will. It should not be too difficult to see how this form of representation ties into contemporary beliefs about the origin and meaning of sickness. Throughout antiquity, sickness and disease were often rationalised as punishments sent by the gods. One of the earliest and most famous examples is the plague at the start of Homer’s Iliad, dispatched by Apollo after the Greeks took his priestess hostage, but such beliefs per-sisted into and well beyond the Classical period, where they coexisted with more ‘rational’ approaches to human illness.74 At the sanctuary of Asklepios at Epidauros, for instance, an inscription set up by the priests of the sanctu-ary in the second half of the fourth century bc records the story of a certain Echedorus, who took money from his friend Pandarus to make a dedication to the god. But instead of handing the money over to Asklepios, Echedorus kept it; the god subsequently punished him by transferring Pandarus’ facial marks onto Echedorus’ own face.75 For the Classical Greek viewer who knew their mythology, this belief that illness was a form of divine punishment would have been consolidated in the healing sanctuary, whose surfaces were scattered with ‘dismembered’ parts of the human body. 73 Euripides Hippolytus 1239. Seneca’s Phaedra (1105– 13) contains a chilling account (albeit much later than the material discussed in this chapter) of how Hippolytus’ servants searched the fields for his scattered body parts. 74 Homer Iliad 1.9ff. Other Archaic examples are at Homer Odyssey 4.377ff. and Hesiod Works and Days 238ff and 260ff. Besides the Epidaurian iamata, Classical- era evidence for such beliefs can be found in the form of mythical narratives, curses and oracles. For the oracles, see Parke and Wormell (1956); for myths where transgression leads to madness, see Mattes (1970), 36– 49; for myths in which sexual transgression is punished by blindness, see Devereux (1973); for more on blindness and madness as a punishment in myth, see Buxton (1980), esp. 30– 4.

On the Near Eastern material, where the connection between illness and divine punishment is even more prevalent, see von Siebenthal (1950). Chapter 5 below explores the connection between illness and punishment in relation to the Lydian- Phrygian propitiatory stelai. 75 IG IV2 1, 121; LiDonnici (1995), 91 [A7], ll. 66– 8.

"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"56Fragmentation as Metaphor56Healing as ReintegrationThe story of Echedorus cited above is one of more than seventy stories pre-served on a series of large, now- fragmentary stelai from the Asklepieion at Epidauros.76 As briefly discussed above, these narratives are known as iamata (‘miracle’) inscriptions; they were written down in the fourth cen-tury bc on blocks of stone displayed within the sanctuary. Most of the iamata tales record success stories – dreams or visions in which supplicants witnessed the epiphany of the god and their own miraculous healing: like the votive offerings left by visitors, then, these inscriptions functioned as permanent material testimonies of the god’s healing power. While so far in this chapter I have focused on how fragmentation was used as a metaphor to give visual form and social meaning to the otherwise intensely personal experience of illness, a closer reading of these Epidaurian healing narratives suggests that corporeal fragmentation may also have played a functional role in the curing of the sick body. For in a number of cases, the process of healing is explicitly connected with the physical dismantling and reassem-bly of a fragmented body:A man from Torone, leeches. When he was sleeping, he saw a dream. It seemed to him that the god ripped open his chest with a knife, took out the leeches and gave them to him in his hands, and sewed his breast together. When day came he left having the animals in his hands, and had become well (hygies egeneto).77Arata of Lacedaimon, dropsy. For her sake, her mother slept here, while she remained in Lacedaimon, and she sees a dream. It seemed to her the god cut off the head of her daughter and hung the body neck downwards. After much fluid had run out, he untied the body and put the head back on the neck. Having seen this dream she returned to Lacedaimon and found on her arrival that her daughter was well (hygiainousan) and that she had seen the same dream.78Aristagora of Troezen. Since she had a worm in her belly, she slept in the temenos of Asklepios in Troezen and she saw a dream. It seemed to her that the sons of the god, while he was not there but was in Epidauros, cut off her head, but they couldn’t put it back again so they sent someone to the Asklepieion, so that he would return. Meanwhile the day overtakes them and the priest clearly sees the head removed 76 IG IV2 1, 121– 4; Edelstein and Edelstein (1945), 221– 37; Dillon (1994); LiDonnici (1995); Rhodes and Osborne (2003), 532– 42. All translations here are taken from LiDonnici (1995). Pausanias (2.27.3) saw six stelai at the site: these presumably included the four that are preserved today. The four stelai are labelled A to D. A and B (IG IV2 1, 121 and IG IV2 1, 122) contain large sections of extant text, while C and D are more fragmentary. Here I follow LiDonnici’s consecutive numbering of the tales across the stelai. 77 LiDonnici (1995), 95 [A13]. 78 LiDonnici (1995), 101 [B1].

It seemed to her that the god had returned from Epidauros and put the head on her neck, and after that cut open her belly, took out the worm and sewed it together again, and from this she became well (hygies egeneto).79In these stories, the restitution of the patient to health is explicitly equated with their physical reconstitution into whole bodies, which prefigures their departure from the sanctuary as healthy beings. Just like the metaphors that align the broken body with the ill body, these tales offer a normative representation of health as wholeness. But here the fragmented body is not simply equated with the ill body; rather, the act of (albeit temporary) dis-memberment plays a vital role in the process of healing itself. On one level this is a practical measure: the disarticulation of the body facilitates the removal of some hostile agent (leeches, fluid, worms). Nevertheless, the sig-nificance of the operation goes above and beyond its immediate practical uses. The wholesale removal of the head is an unnecessarily drastic measure for the expulsion of liquid or small creatures, and I would argue that this hyperbolic imagery of dismemberment and reintegration serves a symbolic purpose, through enacting on another, metaphorical level the transforma-tion undergone by the individual during their visit to the healing sanctuary. This idea finds support in another of the Epidaurian iamata, where the frag-mentation and reintegration of the ‘body’ has no practical value.The goblet. A porter, upon going to the Temple, fell when he was near the ten- stadia stone. When he had gotten up he opened his bag and looked at the broken vessels. When he saw that the goblet from which his master was accustomed to drink was also broken, he was in great distress and sat down to try to fit the pieces together again. But a passer- by saw him and said: ‘Foolish fellow, why do you put the goblet back together in vain? For this one not even Asclepius of Epidaurus could put to rights again.’ The boy, on hearing this, put the pieces back in the bag and went on to the Temple. When he got there he opened the bag and brought the goblet out of it, and it was entirely whole (hygie); and he related to his master what had happened and had been said; when he [the master] heard that, he dedicated the goblet to the god.80Fred Naiden describes the episode of the broken pot as a ‘morality tale’ whose purpose was to confound sceptics, thereby rationalising the citation of such a miracle amongst all the other narratives of bodily illness and cure.81 However, 79 LiDonnici (1995), 103, [B3]. 80 LiDonnici (1995), 93 [A10]. 81 Naiden (2005), 86. Dillon rightly describes the whole group of iamata as aretalogiai which ‘demonstrated that the god was all powerful, that he expected thanks for cures, and that his sceptics had been proven wrong’. Dillon (1994), 257. "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"58Fragmentation as Metaphor58when the broken pot is read alongside the stories that show healing as the reintegration of a previously broken body, the tale acquires an obvious structural significance. In Classical times, the image of a clay pot frequently served as a metaphor for the human body.82 The miraculous mending of the broken pot thus provides an analogy for the mending of the pilgrims’ bodies recorded in the same stele. The significance of the allegorical rep-resentation would not have been lost on other visitors to the sanctuary. The pot in its reconstituted state is described as hygie – ‘healthy’. The same word occurs at the climax of most other tales on the stelai, including the three mentioned above. Moreover, the jeer of the anonymous passer- by, that ‘not even Asklepios’ could make the pot whole again, affirms that Asklepios’ acknowledged claim to fame was precisely that – making things whole again.In the Epidaurian iamata, then, one of the ways in which the process of healing was represented was as the disassembly and subsequent remaking of the patient’s body.83 We might see a similar narrative laid out in the relief from the Asklepieion at Athens (Figure 2.11), where the juxtaposition of the two female bodies – one broken, one whole – can be read as visualising the transition from sickness to health that was being solicited or commem-orated by the dedicant. In turn, the relief ’s juxtaposition of the whole and fragmented bodies would have been mirrored in the juxtaposition of the viewer’s own body with the assemblage of individual anatomical votives displayed within the Asklepieion; this ‘multimedia’ representation may have prefigured, or re- enacted, the viewer’s own personal transition from a state of illness to a state of health. The individual votive body part can thus be seen to play a functional role in the healing process, not (only) through processes of sympathetic magic or substitution, as has previously been suggested, but because the bodily fragmentation that it symbolises sets the whole process of healing in motion.This use of bodily dismemberment to enact the transformation of an individual’s status offers a new perspective on a very old theme in scholar-ship on Greek myth and ritual; that is, the symbolic use of dismemberment 82 DuBois (1988), 46– 9, 57– 9, 132– 6; Sissa (1990). Cf. Henderson (2002), 22: ‘Amphorae, however, insist on their bodily existence in the round: if their “ears,” the handles, halve the expanse between neck and belly, nevertheless bands of belting and studding symbolically hoop the whole circumference and truss the girth into shape.’ 83 This was not the only way in which healing was represented. Other tales record healing being achieved through the act of incubation alone (as in the case of the five- years- pregnant woman who slept in the sanctuary then gave birth immediately afterwards: LiDonnici (1995), 85 [A1]) or using the gods’ snakes as intermediaries (as in the tale recorded at LiDonnici (1995), 97 [A17], in which a man’s toe is healed after being licked by a snake; here we might compare the healing of Wealth in Aristophanes’ Ploutos 410– 12, 633– 747). "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"59Healing as Reintegration 59in rituals of initiation. One early statement of this idea is found in Jane Harrison’s 1912 study Themis: The Social Origins of Greek Religion, which begins with the discussion of a Greek hymn which had been rediscov-ered in 1904 in the sanctuary of Dictaean Zeus at Palaikastro on Crete.84 The hymn describes a baffling sequence of events, including marching, rejoicing and the stealing and hiding away of a child; it was addressed to the Kouros, and was thus presumed by scholars to describe a ritual of adolescent initiation. In reconstructing the details of this ritual, Harrison sought the help of two different types of source: first the combined myths of the young Zeus, Zagreus and Dionysus – all of which involved the theft of the young protagonist, their violent death and their subsequent res-urrection in whole bodies – and secondly the ‘primitive’ rites of adoles-cent initiation observed by Victorian ethnographers in Africa, America, Australia and the South Pacific Islands, which involved the simulation of the neophyte’s dismemberment followed by his reconstitution and rebirth as a new, fully socialised adult being. For Harrison, these mythological and ethnographic sources made the content of the Palaikastro ritual clear: ‘Young Men who have been initiated themselves and will initiate others, will instruct them in tribal duties and tribal dances, will steal them away from their mothers, conceal them, make away with them by some pretended death and finally bring them back as new- born, grown youths, full members of their tribe.’85 Inspired by Van Gennep, whose study of Les Rites de Passage had appeared three years earlier, Harrison ultimately postulated that ‘myths ... which embody the hiding, slaying and bringing to life again of a child or young man, may reflect almost any form of ini-tiation rite’.86In today’s intellectual climate, scholars are reluctant to accept Harrison’s reconstruction of this ancient passage ritual. This reluctance derives, in part, from a deep- running distrust of the comparative methodology that she used and the evolutionary view of human development which this methodology reflected. Meanwhile, recent work has problematised the whole concept of initiation, or at least ‘its use as an explanatory paradigm for a large area of ancient religion and culture’.87 Others remain convinced that dismemberment did play a part in ancient rituals, and in those of the 84 Harrison (1927 [1912]).

We can thus positively conclude that the Classical Greeks did use the image of dismemberment to symbolise and actualise rites of passage, albeit in relation to healing rather than initiation into the mys-tery cults. Any use of similar imagery in contemporary initiation rituals would only have underscored, for viewers of the anatomical votives, the transformative powers of human bodily dismemberment.ConclusionThis chapter has looked at the Classical Greek evidence for anatomical votives, focusing on the material from the major Asklepios sanctuaries at Athens, Corinth and Epidauros. It has explored how and why anatomical votives (re)appeared in Classical Greece, calling particular attention to the fact that this form of representation emerged alongside other ways of experimenting with the imagery of the parted body, including medical texts which enumerated the parts of the sick body, artistic depictions of real and represented bodies- in- pieces, literary metaphors of the body politic and philosophical theories about human evolution and foetal development. Although there are clearly impor-tant distinctions to be made between these different genres, it is also striking that they broadly coincided in time: ultimately, the visual and textual sources introduced here suggest that the imagery of the human body- in- pieces proved exceptionally ‘good to think with’ in the fifth and fourth centuries bc.Replacing the anatomical votives alongside other sorts of ‘deconstructed’ bodies has also suggested some new ways in which they might be interpreted. I have concentrated here on how the votives resonate with textual descrip-tions of illness as bodily breakdown, and also with images of sparagmos, which was another dominant way of visualising divine– mortal relations in the ancient world. However, we must assume that the votives were multi-valent images, and that further meanings would also have been generated from similarities and juxtapositions with other types of bodies- in- pieces. 88 E.g. in the context of a more general study of reflections of Dionysiac cult in Euripides’ Bacchae, Richard Seaford argues that we can perceive in the death of Pentheus ‘a pathetic hint of joyful rebirth, not only in the mother’s recomposition of the body, but in the passage in which Dionysos predicts Pentheus’ triumphal return (963– 70)’. Seaford (1981), 267. "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"61Conclusion61Modern viewers of votive body parts are often struck by their apparent Freudian or Lacanian qualities, and the Empedoclean texts discussed here raise the possibility that ancient viewers may also have made a connection between the fragmented body parts and an early stage of human develop-ment – a connection which may, in turn, have constructed the sanctuary as a space with maternal and preternatural resonances.89 Neither can we rule out the possibility that ancient writers themselves may have been influ-enced by viewing the votives. Roger Brock reminds us that ‘the elements that shape Plato’s imagery can be varied and complex’.90 Is it possible that Plato’s vivid image of the ‘feverish’ Athenian body politic, described in chapter 8 of his Republic, owed something to the votive images of the sick citizenry that he saw strewn around the local healing sanctuaries?91After the Classical period had ended, anatomical votives remained a feature of ancient Greek material religion right through until Roman Imperial times. In Athens, marble body parts continued to be dedicated in the sanctuaries of Asklepios, but also appeared in the sanctuaries of Eros and Aphrodite on the north slope of the Acropolis, of Zeus Hypsistos on the Pnyx, as well as at the shrines belonging to the Heros Iatros, Artemis Kalliste and Ariste, Artemis Kolainis, and Herakles Pankrates.92 Findspots outside Athens in the Hellenistic period include the Asklepieia at Epidauros, Eleusis and Piraeus, as well as the sanctuaries of Artemis Kyparissia at Sparta, Aphrodite Neleia at Demetrias and Artemis Ennodia at Pherai.93 However, rather than pursuing the later Greek trajectory of the anatomical votive tradition, this book will instead move across the Mediterranean to Italy, to pick up on how this tradition was transformed in a very different cultural context. 89 For examples of modern connections between votives and psychoanalysis see Albano, Allison and Abel- Hirsch (2010), 13 (the catalogue of an exhibition Psychoanalysis in which anatomical votives were presented as examples of wish- fulfilment); also contemporary artist Christie Brown’s piece titled E x Vo t o s, which is reproduced and discussed in Brown and Hughes (2012). 90 Brock (2006), 352. 91 Plato Republic 8.556e: ‘Just as a sickly body needs only a slight push from outside to become ill, and sometimes even without any external influence becomes divided by factions within itself, so too doesn’t a city that is in the same kind of condition as that body, on a small pretext – men brought in as allies from outside, from a city under an oligarchy, by the members of one party, from a city under a democracy, by members of the other – fall sick and do battle with itself, and sometimes even without any external influence become divided by faction?’ 92 Eros and Aphrodite: Forsén (1996), 57; Zeus Hypsistos: Forsén (1996), 70; Heros Iatros: Forsén (1996), 56; Artemis Kalliste and Ariste: Forsén (1996), 57; Artemis Kolainis: Forsén (1996), 58; Herakles Pankrates: Forsén (1996), 59. 93 Epidauros Asklepieion: Forsén (1996), 83; Eleusis: Forsén (1996), 82; Piraeus: Forsén (1996), 77; Artemis Kyparissia at Sparta: Forsén (1996), 84; Aphrodite Neleia at Demetrias: Forsén (1996), 87; Artemis Ennodia at Pherai: Forsén (1996), 88.

The votives have also been used to reconstruct ancient anatomical knowl-edge, to retrospectively diagnose illnesses suffered by people in this area and to explore interactions between different communities living within ancient Italy.The current chapter builds on all this work, but adopts a slightly dif-ferent approach, which is driven by the questions of how and why these Etrusco- Italic terracotta body parts differ from the Classical Greek votives that were the focus of the previous chapter. The relationship between the Greek and Italic anatomical votives has conventionally been seen in terms of a straightforward influence, according to which the custom of dedicating 1 See also the distribution map at Comella (1981): note, however that ‘the geographical limits of this practice, defined by Comella and accepted by other scholars, have now come under significant criticism from other scholars, Schultz (2006), 99; see also Glinister (2006), 14– 23.

And it is true that the historical scenario of trade and other types of contact between Greece and Italy in this period, coupled with the strong formal similarities between Greek and Italic body part models, make for a convincing narrative of continuity and influence in the anatomical votive tradition. At the same time, though, there are some important differences between the Greek and Etrusco- Italic votives, not least in the range of body parts that were represented in each place. As we saw in the previous chapter, the votives from Classical Greece all represented ‘external’ body parts: that is, those limbs and other body parts which could be seen and touched from the outside. The Italian depos-its, instead, are full of images of internal organs represented both singly and in groups, suggesting that these populations had radically different views of the human body and its physical and conceptual boundaries.Figure 3.1 Map of Italy showing main sites discussed in the text.

I will then discuss how the Etrusco- Italic terracottas relate to older votive traditions in both Italy and Greece. The chapter makes the following general claim: focusing on the ‘new’ votives that get introduced in a particu-lar place can lead us to a better understanding of the tradition as a whole, by forcing us to notice and question the presence of these new objects in one context and their corresponding absence in another. Specifically, in this case the presence of internal organs in Italy highlights the relatively limited range of votives in Greece, prompting us to consider (a) why Greek artists did not make votive models of internal organs, and (b) why Etrusco- Italic artists did do so. In the first instance, I suggest that the absence of inner organs in Greek deposits can be connected to a constellation of interlinked cultural factors, including constraints operating within the sphere of visual representation, religious regulations about the pure and ‘bounded’ body, and the dominance of medical views in which the organs played a relatively limited role. In Italy, meanwhile, the presence of internal organs is explained primarily in refer-ence to the strong local traditions of animal sacrifice and extispicy, as well as a particular ‘taste’ for visual representations showing the deconstructed body, Figure 3.3 Display of votives from the sanctuary of Nemi, including a hand, foot, two uteri, a bust, three heads, a portion of a face and a ‘dissected’ figurine. "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"67Introducing the Votive Evidence67and a relatively relaxed approach to the boundaries between humans and ani-mals. In this last respect, I will also suggest that these internal organ votives form part of a wider aesthetic of human- animal hybridity, evident in other objects in the Etrusco- Italic assemblage, as well as in the sanctuaries’ framing architecture. The final section of this chapter will explore the close conceptual relationship between hybridity and metamorphosis, demonstrating the rele-vance of these concepts for dedicants and viewers of the anatomical votives.Introducing the Votive EvidenceTerracotta body parts have been found at more than 130 sanctuary sites through-out west– central Italy, primarily within the regions of southern Etruria, Latium and Campania.3 These sanctuaries range from small rural sites to large urban ones, and they ‘belong’ to a diverse collection of gods and goddesses, most of whom are not normally considered to be archetypal healing deities.4 This broad spread suggests that virtually any deity could be approached with requests for healing, with worshippers often dedicating votives at their local sanctuaries rather than going on long pilgrimages to specialised ‘medical’ venues.The anatomical votives’ main period of use seems to stretch from the fourth to the early first century bc, although terracotta heads were already being used as dedications in the fifth century bc, and in some sanctuaries votive body parts continued to be displayed well into the Imperial era.5 It is difficult to reconstruct a more precise chronology for the anatomical votives, partly because, unlike the marble reliefs from Greece, they very rarely have written inscriptions which might aid dating on epigraphic grounds. Only a handful of the Italian terracotta body parts have inscriptions: a leg model from Tarquinia engraved with the words alce:vel:tiples (‘Vel Tiples dedi-cated’); two uterus models from the territory of Vulci incised with vei (‘to [the Etruscan goddess] Vea’); a heart from Lavinium inscribed SEN[- ] IA. 3 List of sites at Fenelli (1975b), 206– 52; Steingräber (1981), 216– 53; Comella (1981), 717– 803.

Other studies of the votives have taken a more panoramic view across different sites, such as the 1975 article by Maria Fenelli and the 1981 follow- up by Comella, both of which include maps indicating the geographical spread of the votives, as well as tables in which the anatomical votives are indexed by type.10 These publications have brought to light the similarities between the contents of the various deposits across the regions of Etruria, Latium and Campania (often abbre-viated to ‘ELC’ in the votives literature), which are shown to contain the same broad categories of offering, including the model body parts, heads and busts (often considered separately from other body parts in the lit-erature), animal figurines and models of swaddled babies (Figure 3.4).11 6 Turfa (2004a), 363 nos. 301– 4.

Despite having all this information at our fingertips, though, statistical study of the votives remains problem-atic: as Turfa has reminded us elsewhere, ‘the only thing we can be sure of is that we do not have 100% of any given deposit/ set of offerings of Late Etruscan/ Latin cult’.13Two assemblages from opposite ends of Etruria can be used to exem-plify some of the similarities and differences between the various sites with votives. The site of Gravisca in south Etruria has already been sin-gled out by several scholars working on votive offerings, in part because it is one of the few sites where votives seem to have been preserved in situ of their dedication.14 Gravisca was a port sanctuary which belonged to the Etruscan town of Tarquinia, and from its earliest phases in the sixth century bc it was used by both Greek and Phoenician traders. Originally, the site was dedicated to Aphrodite, who was later joined by Hera and Demeter; by the fourth century these goddesses had been replaced by their local Etruscan versions, Turan, Uni and Vei respectively. The earliest small shrine was augmented over time, and by the end of the fifth century bc the sanctuary had developed into a large cult complex consisting of five different buildings, subdivided into rooms or spaces (Figure 3.5). It was during this phase of the sanctuary’s life that worshippers began to dedicate anatomical votives.images are found together; and Cazanove (2013).

Another site where votives seem to have been preserved in situ of their dedication is the sanctuary of the Thirteen Altars at Lavinium, where anatomical votives and terracotta figurines were found on top of the altars and on the platforms which separated them (these have been dated to the fourth and third centuries bc, using archaeological stratigraphy and stylistic analysis of the heads: see Fenelli (1975a), 214).

The high number of female body parts – breasts, female heads, vulvas and uteri – is immediately striking, as is the corresponding absence of specifi-cally male body parts such as phalli. In fact, Gravisca belongs to a relatively small group of twenty- one sanctuaries in which we find exclusively ‘female’ offerings: as Celia Schultz has pointed out, these sanctuaries provide some archaeological evidence to support the much greater volume of literary evi-dence for exclusively female cults in antiquity.16 The high quantities of uteri WellBCAFigure 3.5 Plan of the sanctuary at Gravisca, after Comella (1978), plate 1. 15 Turfa (2004a), 365, no. 315, with further bibliography (she lists 17 swaddled babies, 13 statuettes, 9 female heads, 2 ears, 19 arms/ hands, 8 legs/ feet, 5 breasts, 2 female external genitalia, 297 uteri, 122 hearts); Schultz (2006), 192 n. 80. 16 Schultz (2006), 116– 19, using the statistics gathered in Fenelli (1975a) and Comella (1981).

Approximately a quarter of the deposits throughout Italy might be termed ‘gender exclusive’ – i.e. deposits in which the offerings are either exclusively female (containing breasts and uteri but no phalli), or exclusively male (containing phalli but no breasts or uteri). Another quarter contains types of both genders, while more than half of the deposits in Italy have no gender- specific votives. "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"72Under the Skin: Republican Italy72are particularly noticeable, as is the iconographic variation between these models – sixty- three main types, according to the 1978 study by Annamaria Comella.17 This variety in depictions of the womb has been discussed in a recent study by Rebecca Flemming, who notes thatsome shapes and styles do dominate Comella’s uterine typology, with variations on the ‘almond shaped’ (a mandorla), ‘furrowed’ (scanalature), ‘pear- shaped’ (a pera), and ‘egg- shaped’ (ovoide) providing multiple examples which combine to make up around two- thirds of the assemblage. Still, the differences between, and to some extent within, these forms are striking: differences in respect to the overall shape of the main body of the womb, its decoration and structure – which include not just ‘furrows’ but also overlaid bands, cords, even ‘straps’, as well as buttons, crests and other protuberances – to the configuration of its mouth and neck, to size, and presentational style, that is the mode of display.18The impressive variety of the womb models of Gravisca is mirrored at other sites in Etruria, and must somehow be connected to an uncer-tainty about what this normally hidden organ actually looked like.19 The absence of a real, fleshy prototype for comparison and verification pur-poses meant that artists were free to innovate and experiment in their depictions, and to draw symbolic analogies with other types of bodies and objects. And we might assume that one consequence of the juxtapo-sition of all these different uterus types in the sanctuary at Gravisca was to reinforce the uncertainty and mystery surrounding the body inte-rior, which was implicitly constructed as endlessly variable, and even volatile.Besides the intrinsic interest of its gendered assemblage, Gravisca also gives a fleeting glimpse into dedicatory practices at Etrusco- Italic temples. The votives were not found in a deposition pit, as is the case with most other sanctuaries, but rather placed throughout the cult complex, clustering around altars or statue bases, and also inside a well. The space labelled ‘A’ on the plan at Figure 3.5 was a courtyard built on top of the older sanctuary of Aphrodite, and it contained two limestone structures which may have been altars or bases for statues. A large number of votives were found clustered around the southernmost of these structures, including models of swaddled babies, 17 Comella (1978), 67– 81, pls. XXXI– XXXVI. 18 Flemming (2017), 117. Flemming explores how the various features of the wombs might reflect different medical beliefs about the body and argues convincingly that these objects might productively be compared with representations of the womb in Greek Hippocratic texts, which had a wide circulation in this period. 19 Flemming (2017) discusses the neighbouring site of Fontanile di Legnisina, where 300 uteri have been sorted into 48 main types. See Ricciardi (1988– 9), 171– 89.

Room B in this building also contained two statue bases, and votives had accumulated around these too: here the types included swad-dled babies, statuettes, the head of a silenus, arms, hands, vulvas, legs, breasts, many uteri, internal organs, and cipetti. In the room marked C in the neigh-bouring building, 222 uteri were found in the northern and central parts of the room, under a layer of fragmentary roof tiles. This room has been asso-ciated with Demeter, partly on account of a series of votive statuettes repre-senting two draped females sitting in an aedicula, who have been identified as Demeter and Kore, and partly because the room also contained a circular thesmophoric altar of the type found in sanctuaries of Demeter in Greece. The large numbers of uteri found in this room suggest that Demeter had a particular connection to this body part, and, by extension, may have been associated with female reproductive health.The ‘clustering’ of certain types of body part within the sanctuary at Gravisca echoes the situation at the Athens Asklepieion, where, as we have seen, the inventory inscriptions suggest a careful arrangement of votives according to type. At Gravisca, where three deities were worshipped, the evidence suggests that each of the goddesses attracted her own type of ded-ication – couples and cipetti for Aphrodite in Room A, uteri for Demeter in Room C, and perhaps swaddled babies for Hera in Room B. Whether or not the dedicatory practices at Gravisca were representative of other sites in the region is hard to know, since most other votive assemblages are not found in situ of their original places of deposition. This is the case with the Figure 3.6 Drawings of some votive uteri from Gravisca, showing Comella’s main types of (from left to right) ‘furrowed’ (a scanalature), ‘almond shaped’ (a mandorla), ‘egg- shaped’ (ovoide) and ‘pear- shaped’ (a pera).

Recent icono-graphic and material analysis of the many heads found at Tessennano has suggested that they came from a local workshops in operation in Tuscania.22 While the overall numbers are similar to those at Gravisca (approximately 569 terracotta objects, plus 14 small bronzes), the categories of body part depicted are different: 9 male half- heads, 108 adult male heads, 45 adult female heads, 8 ‘masks’ (sections of the face representing the eyes and nose), 21 breasts, 10 limbs, 80 feet, 22 hands, 148 male genitals, 31 uteri, 5 vulvas, 12 ‘polyvisceral’ terracottas (representations of multiple internal organs), 2 ears, and 5 representations of the horizontally segmented trunk (Figure 3.7).23As this list shows, several types of body part (heads, ears, hands, breasts, female genitals and feet) are shared between the two sites of Gravisca and Tessennano, and both sites also had models of swaddled babies. Such over-lap in votive types is typical of the deposits in the Etrusco- Latial- Campanian region, and has consequently been seen as evidence for a broader ‘cultural koine’ stretching across these regions of central Italy.24 At the same time, each one of the ELC votive deposits has certain characteristics that make it different from those at other sites.25 In the case of Tessennano, the deposit stands out partly on account of its distinctively ‘male’ character. We find at Tessennano more than twice the number of male as female heads, and a large proportion of images of male genitals, generally the non- erect penis plus scrotum. In this sense, the Tessennano deposit is very different to the more ‘female’ site of Gravisca. Moreover, at Tessennano we also find some typologically unusual objects, such as the segments of lower bodies, as well 20 On Tessennano see Sarchioni (1959); Unge Sörling (1994); Costantini (1995); Söderlind (2002), and the review of this book by Turfa (2004b); Turfa (2004a), 365, no. 317. 21 On the excavations see Costantini (1995), 145– 6.

Crucially, the dedication of animal body parts in the Etrusco- Italic sanctuaries demonstrates that a similar approach was taken to human and animal bodies – both in terms of illness and healing, and in the way in which the body is visually disassembled into its constituent pieces. We will return to discuss this point in more detail later on in this chapter.The Origins of the Anatomical Votives in ItalyThis discussion of the assemblages of Gravisca and Tessennano has given us some insight into the nature of the Italian votive assemblages, and has indicated 28 Ancient sources confirm that patients did sometimes see themselves as occupied by animals, although most of these sources come from Greek contexts. See e.g. Hippocrates Epidemics 5.86 and the Epidaurian iamata at LiDonnici (1995), 95, [A13] and 103 [B3]. Pliny comments that snakes could breed in a man’s bone marrow (Natural History 10.188; cf. Plutarch Cleomenes 39; Ovid Metamorphoses 15.389). Another passage of Pliny suggests a further possible interpretation of these objects. ‘There is a record,’ he writes in Natural History 11.97, ‘that when a person at Volterra named Caecina was performing a sacrifice, some snakes darted out from the internal organs of the victim – a joyful portent.’ It is not entirely implausible that this votive object might be connected in some way to the narrative preserved in Pliny’s later text, e.g. by deliberately invoking the story in an attempt to harness its positive valence. Alternatively, the story could have been invented in response to this or similar votive objects – which may have intrigued and perplexed ancient viewers as much as modern ones. 29 Söderlind (2004), 293, no. 77 (‘39 animal figurines including 1 hoof of a cow, cows, 1 bull, 1 pig and 1 bird’). Söderlind’s study reveals that cows are the most common species represented in figurine form, followed by pigs and then horses. On the partial animal representations see Söderlind (2004), 278; Recke (2013), 1081 n. 9; Pesetti (1994), 96– 100 (for the finds from Capua); Pensabene (2001), 373, no. 350 (a bovine hoof from Palestrina); Cazanove (2013).

In what follows, I take a step back and momentarily consider the Etrusco- Italic votives in their wider, pan- Mediterranean context – a broadening of scale which allows us to identify the differences between the Etrusco- Italic material and the Classical Greek votives considered in the previous chapter.Where did the anatomical votive ritual in Republican central Italy come from? The tradition of dedicating images of body parts is attested in earlier periods at sites further up the Italian peninsula, in the Veneto and other regions of northern Italy (Figure 3.10). Small numbers of model body parts dating to between the seventh and fourth centuries bc have been found at Este and Villa di Villa in the Veneto, as well as at the sites of Adria, Figure 3.9 Bovine hoof from Pisaurum (Pesaro).

In the deposit from Villa di Villa, we find votive body parts in the form of thin bronze plates, decorated with repoussé dots which form the outlines of faces, legs, arms, as well as lower body sections which appear to have been made by cutting miniature statuettes in half.31 Images of a leg and a foot dating to the fifth century bc were found together with bronze figurines and clay vessels at the ‘santuario delle acque’ in Marzabotto, the site of a presumed healing cult centred on a well and basin containing healing waters.32 Another deposit from Marzabotto yielded two arms and four legs, one of which was topped with the image of a bird (note that a similar object was found at the more northerly site of Adria).33Figure 3.10 Miniature metal votive plaques from the sanctuary of Reitia, Este. c.700–400 bc. 30 See Turfa (2004a), 364, nos. 305– 9, and the introduction in Maioli and Mastrocinque (1992), 13ff. 31 Maiolo and Mastrocinque (1992), 115– 16, D1– D4.2, s.v. ‘Ex- voto anatomici’.

Figure 3.7).35 At the same time, how-ever, there are also many points of difference between the two data sets, besides their chronological and geographical distance. The miniature size and shiny metal appearance of the earlier metal votives would, for example, have distanced them from the reality inhabited by their users and viewers. Douglass Bailey has outlined some of the psychological effects that minia-turism can have on viewers and handlers of objects: these include empow-erment, the creation of accessible alternative worlds and alternative world views, and an alteration in understanding and comprehension of the thing represented, which arises from the necessary reduction of detail in the miniature object.36 The large, three- dimensional and often flesh- coloured terracotta offerings from Republican central Italy would have had a very different impact on their viewers, drawing them into a relationship predi-cated on identification rather than distance – on an intrusion into the ded-icant’s world, rather than an escape from it.37As several other studies have already noted, the Etrusco- Italic terracottas find much closer parallels with the Greek votives from Corinth, which are also mould- made from terracotta, and which also represent the body at or near lifesize.38 The vast majority of the human body parts represented in Corinth appear in the Etrusco- Italic deposits, too; moreover, Matthias Recke has noted that the animal parts in Italy find a counterpart in a goat’s hoof from the Corinth Asklepieion.39 Meanwhile, Alexandra Lesk has drawn 34 Glinister (2006). 35 Cf. the nine examples moulded in terracotta found at the Latin colony of Cales: Ciaghi (1993), 185– 7. 36 Bailey (2005), 26– 44; cf.

Most notably, while the Etrusco- Italic deposits include most of the body parts that are represented in Corinth (legs, arms, heads, breasts, male genitals, ears, eyes, hands and feet), they also include many representations of the inner body – both individual organs like the hearts and uteri, as well as ‘polyvisceral’ representations of the organs on a plaque or figurine. In contrast, as Bjorn Forsén has explained:inner organs only occur very seldom in Greece – the only known cases are a dubious stomach/ uterus/ bladder from Corinth, and two (possibly modern?) clay plaques from Kos depicting the lungs and the uterus/ bladder. Additionally, the heart is mentioned five times and the bladder once in the Athenian inventories, and the uterus twice in the Delian.44The ‘dubious stomach’ was identified by Roebuck, although in reality this fragmentary piece is very difficult to interpret.45 Moreover, as Rebecca 40 Pierced breast: Comella (1978), pl. 30, 154 (DIV 2).

The majority are uteri, which are attested in their ‘hundreds (if not thousands)’ according to the most recent study.47 In addition to the Graviscan wombs that have already been discussed, we find models of lar-ynxes, hearts and intestines represented in a variety of formats, including types which Jean Macintosh Turfa vividly describes as ‘barrel- like coils’ and ‘amorphous piles of sausage’.48 And as well as these single organs, we also find assemblages of internal body parts such as the trachea, lungs, heart, spleen, liver and intestines.49 Like the uteri and the other single organs, these ‘polyvisceral’ representations are characterised by their great variety, which precludes our modern attempts at classification.50 Some examples display a roughly symmetrical arrangement of organs on a teardrop- shaped plaque (Figure 3.11); others show the organs stacked up in a three- dimensional, irregular conical shape, often with the tra-chea folded over on top of other organs (Figure 3.12).51 Perhaps the most striking models, at least for a modern audience, are those which show the organs in the context of a ‘dissected’ human body (Figures 3.13 and 3.14; cf. the female figurine shown in Figure 3.3).52 These ‘open torsos’ 46 Flemming (2017), 123. 47 Flemming (2017), 113 notes that ‘It is reported, for example, that c. 6,000 votive uteri and swaddled infants were found at the Italic Temple in Paestum.’ See Greco (1988), 79. 48 Turfa (1994), 226.

Were they, like anatomical images from later periods in history, made by looking at Figure 3.11 ‘Polyvisceral plaque’ in terracotta, now in the Wellcome Collection. 53 As Jean Turfa has noted, ‘the tear- drop shaped incision is not in the correct area, but generally over the waistline or higher, although abdominal organs are shown, almost in a telescoped view’.

The scholarly consensus is that the Etrusco- Italic images do not normally reflect a real- life tradition of human dissection in Italy, but were instead based on ‘opportune’ sightings of animal and human bodies in situations such as sacrifice, battles, accidents and – in the case of the uterus – prolapse or even post- mortem Caesarean section.55 Of these, animal butchery and sacrifice, together with the associated rituals of extispicy (the examination of the entrails) and haruspicy (the examination of the liver) must have pro-vided particularly frequent opportunities to examine the internal body.56 Indeed, some medical historians have identified the shapes of animal organs within the polyvisceral models, giving support to the hypothesis that these objects were made in reference to animal bodies.57 The ‘transplanting’ of ani-mal organs inside votive models that were apparently meant to represent the human body constitutes another sort of hybrid representation to place alongside the model with the snake (Figure 3.8). It may also indicate that the insides of animal and human bodies were seen as commensurate, or at least similar enough for knowledge about one category to be applied to the other.Of course, in practical terms, we do not need to imagine that the votives’ makers were physically present at animal sacrifices, since the organs of these beasts were commonly represented in the visual arts, and these representa-tions may themselves have provided inspiration for the human votive mod-els. Particularly close parallels are found in three- dimensional models like 55 For further discussion of this issue see Turfa (1994) and Flemming (2017). The hypothesis of Caesarean section is that of Turfa (1994), 227– 30. Her argument centres on the fact that these models contain details that do not appear in most animal species (e.g. a single ‘neck’, which differs from the bicornuate uteri of pigs, cows, dogs and horses), and that may therefore have been made in reference to human organs; she also notes that some model uteri have anomalous features such as rounded knobs, which she proposes may be schematic representations of fibroid tumours, two cervices, or extra appendages, the latter perhaps representing a congenital malformation. The evidence for post- mortem Caesarean section is, however, quite late: it comes from the lex regia de mortuo inferendo, which – although attributed to the regal period of Rome’s history – was recorded in Justinian’s Corpis Iuris Civilis in the sixth century ad (Digesta 11.8.2 Marcellus 28 dig.). Moreover, we need to consider the possibility that these representations may have been deliberately unrealistic and stylised, and may have been shaped by the desire to create symbolic links to other, non- biological objects. In this regard, Veronique Dasen and Sandrine Ducaté- Paarmann have pointed out that the shape of many of the votive uteri echoes that of a vase or jar, perhaps signalling a possible overlap with Greek medical texts which conceptualise the uterus as a vessel (Dasen and Ducaté- Paarmann (2006), 248; for the uterus as a vessel see King (1998), 26, 34– 5). This raises the possibility that the representation of the uterus with a single rather than double neck might be intended to underline and enhance an intentional analogy, rather than to reflect anatomical reality. For a theoretical discussion of visual analogy see Stafford (1999). 56 By the time of the late Republic, Cicero could claim that ‘nearly everyone uses entrails in divination‘. De divinatione 1.10.

One late fourth- century bc mirror from Vulci – another place rich in ana-tomical votives – shows the Greek seer Calchas represented in the guise of an Etruscan haruspex, examining the detached liver, lungs and trachea of the sacrificial animal (Figure 3.16).59 This scene is typical of Etruscan representations of haruspicy and extispicy insofar as it depicts the organs as detached from the animal’s body, in contrast to later Roman practice in which the organs were examined exta adhaerentia – that is, still attached to the animal’s body.60These images of extispicy, then, provide possible prototypes for the anatomical votive models; they also help us to understand why Figure 3.15 Terracotta liver from Falerii Veteres, c.300 bc. 58 For the terracotta liver from Falerii see Meyer (1985), 107; Van der Meer (1987), 153, with a picture on p. 154 (no. 71).

At a very basic level, objects like the Vulci mirror attest to the centrality of the inner body in Etruscan divine– mortal rela-tions. According to the logic of extispicy, the will of the gods mani-fested itself materially on the animal interior, which by extension was perceived as a dynamic and volatile microcosm. The animal organs were targeted by the gods, and needed special ritual attention by mortals: in this sense, it is unsurprising that the inner organs also featured heav-ily in contemporary understandings of the human body, where they appear to have played a central role in models of illness. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the rituals of extispicy depended on the variety of the internal organs, and on identifying the ways in which any one example differed from a normative model. This gives some useful con-text for the great variation between the uteri, and between other votive internal organs, in the sense that the votive models were both made and Figure 3.16 Etruscan cast bronze mirror depicting Calchas examining a liver. From Vulci. "},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"90Under the Skin: Republican Italy90viewed by people who expected anomalies and variations in the innards, and who saw these features as central to divine– mortal communica-tions. From the surviving votive evidence it is hard to say much more than this, but again, drawing attention to the prominence of variation in Etrusco- Italic ritual perhaps makes it less surprising that the votive models of internal organs were iconographically so diverse, and might help us to understand why craftsmen apparently did not prioritise con-formity or accuracy when they were making the internal votives – unlike artists producing anatomical illustrations in later, medical contexts.The polyvisceral images also relate closely to the theme of fragmentation explored in the Introduction and Chapter 2 of this book. This is partly on account of their often- graphic depiction of corporeal disassembly, which is particularly emphatic in the case of the ‘dissected’ torsos – some of which, as already mentioned, depict the broken ribs and stitches in the skin around the opening. Moreover, the fact that these polyvisceral votives depict a multiplicity of organs rather than a focused portrait of a single body part challenges the dominant interpretation of anatomical votives, according to which the fragmentary form of these models is a visual device to pinpoint physical ailments.61 These polyvisceral votives certainly drew attention to the general torso/ intestinal area, but then so did the other ‘unopened’ stom-ach or torso representations that are also found in sanctuaries across these regions (Figure 3.17). The fact that the polyvisceral images depict several locations within the body forces us to accept that more is at stake here than the simple localisation of illness on the body. The historian Pierre Decouflé took the richness and (over)complexity of these images to indicate that they may have belonged to upper- class dedicants, or to members of an intellectual elite.62 Even if this were true – and we have no way of verify-ing his hypothesis – I would argue that the visual complexity of the poly-visceral votives also enabled them to carry additional symbolic meaning, through analogy with other forms of bodily representation. Matthias Recke has already suggested that the opened torsos may have intimated an act of (mortal or divine) surgery through which the dedicant would have become well again.63 The dissected torsos may also, I would suggest, have evoked the 61 See Introduction, n. 7. Some scholars have interpreted the polyvisceral models as dedications by sufferers of malaria: see e.g. Fabbri (2004– 5). 62 Decouflé (1964). 63 Recke (2013), 1078, on the Ingolstadt torso with suturing. Cf. the Epidaurus iamata discussed in the previous chapter, where Asklepios is sometimes envisaged as a surgeon; this interpretation of the polyvisceral votives thus highlights some communalities in the view of the healing process between Greece and Italy, despite the visual differences between the anatomical votives from these places.

Noting the presence of internal organ votives in Italy highlights the absence of such representations in Greece – an absence which becomes even more compelling when we consider that (a) Greek artists would presumably have had similar opportunities to observe the insides of animal bodies in the contexts of sacrifice and butchery, and (b) Greek scene is supported by a column decorated with a vegetal wreath – an architectural reference that again serves to locate divine punishment within the physical space of the temple. 65 Whether or not human sacrifice was actually practised in pre- Roman Italy – and this is a question that has long divided scholars – it did play a central role in local mythical and aetiological narratives, and was also frequently represented in Etruscan art. For human sacrifice in Etruscan culture see Jannot (2005), 39– 42; Torelli (1981); Bonfante (1984). For human sacrifice in Iron Age and Roman Europe see Green (2001); for Greek antiquity see Bremmer (2007), esp. 55– 80. 66 The foundation narrative of the sanctuary of Nemi saw Diana’s cult there as an offshoot of the cult of Tauric Artemis, who, in the words of James Frazer, ‘could only be appeased with human blood’. Frazer (1922), 6. The Greek mythological siblings Orestes and Iphigenia provide the link between the two cults, with Orestes rescuing Iphigenia from her role as Artemis’ priestess at Tauris (where she was expected to sacrifice humans), and fleeing with the cult statue of Artemis to Nemi. For sources see Green (2007), 201– 7. 67 A large group of polyvisceral votives was found in the temple of Dea Fortuna in Volsinii (Bolsena, in Etruscan territory) together with statues of haruspices and several sacrificial implements, including knives, altars, and pincers for extracting viscera.

"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"93Two Different Views of the Body93writers show a profound awareness of the inner structures of the human body.68 Medical writers give detailed accounts of the appearance and func-tion of the internal organs, and the Epidaurian narratives also include inter-nal as well as superficial problems. Texts in other genres also employ a rich vocabulary for describing the inside of the body, with tragedians in par-ticular revelling in accounts of gushing blood and sticky entrails. As Ruth Padel has shown with her study of fifth- century ideas of bodily interiority, splanchna (innards) play a crucial role in Greek culture – they function as the site of consciousness, as well as of emotions like anxiety, fear, grief, and sometimes love and desire.69One possible reason for the insistent exteriority of Greek votives has been suggested by Sandrine Ducaté- Paarmann in a 2007 book chapter on ancient images of the human embryo.70 Ducaté- Paarmann attributes the absence of votive uteri in Greece to a general feeling of disgust which is documented in Greek literary accounts of the human interior. Aristotle famously complains that ‘it is not in fact without great disgust that we see what composes the human species: blood, flesh, bones, veins and similar p a r t s ’.71 Later Greek sources also contrast the beauty of the outside of the body with the ugliness of what is inside: examples here include Boethius’ rhetorical question about the body of Alcibiades (‘would not that body ... so gloriously fair in outward seeming, appear altogether loathsome when all its inward parts lay open to the view?’), and Lucian’s comment about colossal, ‘ugly on the inside’ cult statues of deities.72 Ducaté- Paarmann also reminds us that images of violent deaths in Greek art only very rarely repre-sent the actual permeation of the human body: most commonly, we find the ‘pregnant moment’ before the skin is ruptured (see the example at Figure 3.19, an Attic red- figure vase depicting the death of Actaeon).73Other scholars have observed similar restraint in Classical Greek depic-tions of the animal body. In his book Hiera Kala, Folkert van Straten demon-strates how in their depictions of animal sacrifice, Greek artists show an 68 On Greek rituals of hepatoscopy from animal organs, see Collins (2008).

"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"94Under the Skin: Republican Italy94overwhelming preference for ‘pre- kill’ moments, such as the procession to the altar and the wreathing of the animal, whose body at this point was still whole and bounded.74 In comparison with these scenes, depictions of the actual sacrifical killing and butchery are noticeably under- represented. While ‘post- kill’ scenes were entirely absent from marble votive reliefs, a small number of vase- painters did depict butchery in the context of extis-picy; however, Robin Osborne has since suggested that these vases were made with an Etruscan export market in mind, noting that all those with a recorded findspot come from Etruria (eight out of twenty- two Greek vases showing extispicy).75 Meanwhile, in his study on Greek hepatoscopy, Derek Collins notes how ‘curiously, no model livers have been found in Greece’.76 Again, as we have seen, model livers are found in Etruria, and this has led scholars to assert that the knowledge of hepatoscopy passed from Babylon directly to Etruria, bypassing Greece entirely. (As a side point, if we consider that internal organs were apparently never depicted in Classical Greek art, we might be dissuaded from taking the absence of model livers in Classical Greece as hard evidence that Babylonian traditions were unknown there).At any rate, the marked contrast in attitudes to the internal organs in ancient Greek visual and literary sources is quite striking, and dovetails with modern theories about the ‘body multiple’, according to which the body can exist in distinctive forms which are produced by, and inextricable from, their own particular contexts.77 In this sense, another context that may have been particularly problematic (in terms of the representation of the inner body) was that of the Classical Greek sanctuary. Many of the reli-gious regulations that survive from the Greek world concern the purity of worshippers, while the entrances of sanctuaries were frequently marked by perirrhanteria – water basins which were used by visitors for ritual puri-fication prior to entering within the temenos (sacred precinct).78 The fol-lowing categories of body were considered impure, and were thus often excluded from the sanctuary: dead and decaying bodies, living bodies that had been in contact with corpses, bodies that had recently been sexually active, post- partum bodies, and the bodies of breast- feeding or menstru-ating woman. Although the logic of impurity is far from transparent, one factor that unites these different categories of excluded bodies is the notion of unboundedness – the threat of bringing internal fluids or substances like 74 Van Straten (1995). 75 Osborne (2001), 283. 76 Collins (2008), 325; Burkert (1992), 46, with bibliography. 77 Mol (2002). 78 See Parker (1983); Cole (2004); Osborne (2011), 158– 84.

A special ritual concern with policing the boundary between the inside and outside of the human body might, then, provide another context for the absence of votive models of internal organs in the Classical Greek sanctuary.Yet another possibility is that the dominant view of the body in operation in the Greek healing sanctuaries did not give prominence to the internal organs. The Epidaurian narratives, for instance, represent the body not as an assemblage of solid organs contained within the skin – but rather as a vessel full of liquids.Erasippa from Kaphyiai [problem]. This woman had [pain?] in her stomach and was burning up with fever, and she couldn’t keep anything down. Sleeping here, she saw a dream. It seemed to her that the god rubbed her stomach and kissed her, and after that gave her a phiale in which was a drug, and told her to drink it and then to throw up. When she had thrown up, her little robe was filled with it. When day came she saw the whole little robe full of horrible stuff which she had thrown up, and from this she became well.79In the tale of Erasippa described here, Asklepios gives the patient a drug that makes her vomit copiously; in other iamata narratives, blood, mucus and pus are ejected from the body.80 In some instances, the divine surgeon adds liquid to the body, for instance by pouring drugs in liquid form into the eye to restore a blind person’s sight.81 The iamata inscriptions thus tes-tify to an understanding of the body interior that is dominated by liquids rather than organs, and in which the cure of the patient is linked to the regulation of liquids inside the body. A similar view is expressed in cer-tain ‘rational’ medical writings, and perhaps most famously by those texts in the Hippocratic corpus which describe illness as an imbalance in the body’s humours. Most famously, the author of Nature of Man describes how ‘the body of man has in itself blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile; these make up the nature of his body, and through these he feels pain or enjoys health’; according to this view, the role of the Hippocratic physi-cian – similar to that of Asklepios at Epidaurus – is to intervene to bring a 79 After LiDonnici (1995), 115 [B 21]. 80 Blood: LiDonnici (1995), 107 [B7], where the floor of the abaton is covered in blood after a surgical operation; LiDonnici (1995), 115 [B23] where a man’s feet bleed after having been bitten by the snake.

The author of On Ancient Medicine, for instance, divides the body’s structures into two categories: the first type are shaped like cupping vessels, which allows them to ‘attract, and be filled with, a liquid that is foreign to them’, while the second type are spongy, which means they can ‘drink up especially the juices around them, and become hardened and enlarged by the accession of juices’. The stomach is filled with a liquid that it evacuates every day, while the spleen ‘drinks up and receives a fluid into itself ’. The sacred and med-ical texts cited here suggest a Greek imagery of the body interior that was dominated by formless liquids rather than solid organs, thereby raising the possibility that Greek artists did not even consider internal organs as possi-ble candidates for inclusion in the anatomical votive repertoire.Permeable BoundariesThe discussion so far has focused on Classical Greece, and has explored how the more limited range of the votives represented there might tie into wider beliefs about bodies in that culture. In the case of the Etrusco- Italic votives, it is harder to perform this kind of analysis, given the absence of textual sources and written laws that might tell us more about local atti-tudes to the human body. It is, however, possible to comment on the effects that the addition of the internal organ votives would have had on the expe-rience of visitors to the sanctuaries in which they appeared, and also how they might relate more obliquely to other visual images that viewers would have seen around them. I would argue in particular that the depiction of human interiority in the sanctuary (a) reorganised the lived experience of the body and (b) forced the viewer to recognise the fundamental similari-ties between human and animal bodies.In the first instance, it is enough to imagine the experience of visitors to the Etrusco- Italic sanctuaries, who would have been confronted by votive 82 Hippocrates, Nature of Man 4. King (2013) revisits the influential four- humour theory outlined in Nature of Man, reminding us that this was not the only view of the body in fifth- and fourth- century bc Greece. Cf. also Brock (2006), 355, where he notes that ‘failures in the body’s internal harmony are not always a matter of imbalance: sometimes Hippocratic writers conceive of illness as being caused by the separation of an element which, as it were, falls out of solution’. "},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"97Permeable Boundaries97images of the human body in pieces – not only the disconnected limbs and heads that would have been visible in Greece, but also the internal parts, lying around the surfaces and the altars and statue bases. These lat-ter objects would have brought the interior of the body into the exter-nal world, making visible and tangible parts of the body that normally were concealed. This in turn would have resulted in a ‘flattening out’ of the structures of the human body, an effect which drastically altered the nor-mal lived experience of the body, in which the internal organs were barely perceptible. To understand this better, we can turn to the modern ‘sensory homunculus’ images which attempt to represent the human somato- sen-sory system, or ‘the body in the brain’ (Figure 3.18).83 These schematic diagrams represent the proportion of the cerebral cortex occupied by each bodily area (in other words, the neurons that fire when that particular body part is moved, touched, in pain, and so on). As the diagram demonstrates, most of the cerebral cortex is occupied by body parts that are externally visible, and particularly by the most sensitive areas such as the hands and the lips. Instead, the entire intra- abdominal area occupies a proportionally tiny area, tucked into the bottom left- hand corner of the diagram together with the pharynx. In practice, this means that we have a very limited ability to recognise and localise sensation inside the body, and that we are rarely aware of the internal body’s presence – particularly when we are feeling healthy and functional. However, the proportions of this somato- sensory representation are turned upside down by the Etrusco- Italic votive assem-blages, where the internal organs are numerous and salient. For sick view-ers, the exhibition of internal organs in the sanctuary may have reflected a sudden consciousness of the inner body’s existence, or a more general disruption of how the body normally felt and functioned.84 And for all viewers, regardless of whether they were sick or healthy, the models of innards would have marked the sanctuary out as a distinctive space within the landscape – a space in which familiar ways of experiencing the body were disrupted and even inverted.Secondly, the votive models of internal organs forced viewers to recog-nise and reconsider the relationship between human and animal bodies, in part by showing the striking similarity of their physical interiors. As already mentioned, the internal organs that appeared within the ‘open torso’ mod-els were formally indistinguishable from the animal organs that were seen, held and represented in the context of sacrifice, often in very close phyical proximity to the anatomical votives. In the case of isolated organs such as 83 Discussed at Schott (1993). 84 See Leder (1990) for the ‘dys- appearing’ body in illness.

This ambiguity would in turn have given a pow-erful message about the equivalence or even interchangeability of the two types of body, which in other parts of ancient life were kept at much greater conceptual distance.86This ambiguous ontological status of the internal organ votives becomes particularly significant when we remember that other types of votive from the Etrusco- Italic deposits also challenged the boundaries between human and animal bodies. Earlier in this chapter we encountered the votive mod-els of animal body parts, which appeared at Tessennano and at several other sites throughout the ELC area and beyond (Figure 3.9). As well as indicating a shared approach to the health of human and animal bodies, these objects created an infinite array of possible hybrid bodies through their juxtaposition with the human anatomical votives. Meanwhile, other votive objects appear to have intentionally represented hybrids. The clearest example is the pair of polyvisceral plaques from Tessennano in which the trachea (of a human, or perhaps another beast) was modelled into a snake’s body and given pellet eyes, thereby fusing the bodies of two different spe-cies (see Figure 3.8). Other votive objects from different parts of the ELC region have also been interpreted in terms of hybridity: amongst the wombs from Gravisca, for instance, are examples decorated with undulating crests across their tops, which some scholars have seen as assimilating the bodies of fish or fantastic marine creatures.87 And in addition to these possible human- animal hybrids, Britt- Marie Fridh- Haneson has noted that some 86 See Hughes (2010) for further discussion of this point. 87 Comella (1978), pl. 36, nos. 211 and 212. The analogy with a fish is made at Baggieri (1999), 27. Baggieri and colleagues note that aquatic symbolism is also evident in another series of wombs with a ‘plaited’ decoration akin to that of a bag or wineskin – they suggest that such symbolism may have its root in the fact that the gravid uterus is filled with amniotic fluid. At the same time, the specific analogy between the uterus and a fish could recall ideas found in the Greek medical writings, in which the womb was seen as an animate being that could move around the body. Plato’s Timaeus expresses the idea that the womb was a wild creature (agrion), which moved around the female body causing diseases; this idea was repeated by authors of the Roman period, such as the second- century ad writer Areteus of Cappadocia, who called the womb ‘a living thing [zoon] inside another living thing’. Plato Timaeus 91a– d; Aretaeus On Acute Diseases 2,11. The Hippocratic text Diseases of Women 1,7 attributes the movement of the womb to the shortage of moisture. See King (1998), 222– 5. This visual connection between the womb and a moving creature raises the possibility that such objects may have been seen in relation to illness as well as fertility. In more general terms, each of these symbolic visual analogies also problematises our attempts to see the form of votive offerings as evidence for ancient anatomical knowledge, since they suggest that eccentric visual characteristics may result, not from mistaken ideas about human anatomy, but rather from the desire to make deliberate symbolic connections to other ideas, bodies and objects. On the use of Greek medical texts as tools for understanding the Italic votive material see Flemming (2017).

As a preface to this exploration, it should perhaps be said that it is important not to overstate the relevance of these themes, since the types of object drawn on here do not appear in every Etrusco- Italian votive deposit. On current counts (which are almost certainly incomplete) we know of forty polyvisceral images and nine sanctuaries with model animal body parts, while the snake models from Tessennano are completely unique to that deposit. All the same, it does seem that animality and hybridity were prominent themes at some sanctuaries, and that these themes could be per-ceived across more than one type of object. Again, we cannot know precisely how this imagery would have been interpreted and experienced by its orig-inal viewers, but one possibility has been raised by Vedia Izzet in relation to the hybrid creatures which often appeared on the antefixes of Etruscan sanctuaries, and which thus constituted part of the framing imagery for the votives discussed here. Izzet suggests that the vision of ‘dual- natured’ beasts like the Gorgon, satyrs, maenads and the bull- headed Acheloos functioned as metaphors or ‘templates’ for the encounters between mortal and divine spheres that took place within the sanctuary:All these creatures are, in some senses, between categories and transcend them, or, in the language of structural anthropology, they are all liminal ... The gorgon is half woman, half beast; the satyr half man, half beast; Achéloos half man, half bull; and the maenad half mad, half sane. By virtue of belonging to neither and both categories simultaneously, these figures are ideal for mediating between one world and another, in this case religious and non- religious, and temple and non- temple.89Another possible interpretation might draw on the capacity of hybrid images to invoke change and transformation, which, by extension, would have helped to construct the Etrusco- Italic sanctuary as a space in which the transformation of the dedicant’s own body was possible. This interpre-tation draws on the strong conceptual overlap between hybridity and met-amorphosis, and on the ambiguity between visual images of hybrid and metamorphic bodies.90 Figures 3.19 and 3.20 offer simple visual illustrations 88 Fridh- Haneson (1987). 89 Izzet (2000), 45– 6. 90 Sharrock (1996). "},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"101Permeable Boundaries101of this concept. Viewers familiar with the myth of Actaeon will recognise Figure 3.19 as a synchronic snapshot of a longer, diachronic process of metamorphosis; to viewers unfamiliar with the myth, however, this image could easily be ‘mistaken’ for the representation of a ‘stable’ human- animal hybrid being attacked by dogs and men. Meanwhile, Figure 3.20 shows a sequence of images from a 1999 artwork by the contemporary visual art-ist, Daniel Lee. Here, each image represents a stage of human evolution as imagined by Lee, starting with the fish form and moving through reptiles and simians to finish with a human body. In this work, a diachronic pro-cess of bodily transformation is broken down into a number of individual snapshots, each of which, when taken in isolation, might be seen as a stable hybrid creature. Although these ancient and contemporary images of meta-morphosis belong to very different visual traditions, they each demonstrate Figure 3.19 Attic red- figure krater showing the death of Actaeon.

This same ambiguity would have marked the hybrid imagery in the Etrusco- Italic votive deposit, and would even have been heightened by their lack of narrative context (i.e. they did not appear in the context of a well- known myth or illustrate a recognisable scientific hypothesis). The meta-morphic, slippery quality of many of these objects might also have been underlined by their evocation of physical movement – that is, the slithering of the open- eyed snake, the swimming of the ‘fishy’ uterus, or the heavy plodding of the bovine lower limbs.This interpretation of the Etrusco- Italic votives as embodying metamor-phosis dovetails with some other recent discussions of the material which also bring out the themes of boundary- transgression, change and move-ment. Emma- Jayne Graham has pointed out that many of the votive models of swaddled infants show the feet as unbounded, a technique which is con-trary to the advice about swaddling given by the medical writer Soranus.91 She suggests a number of possible resonances of the image of the unbound feet that are specific to the sanctuary context, including parental hopes for the future physical mobility of a child, the association of bare feet with 91 Graham (2014), 35.Figure 3.20 Origin, Daniel Lee (1999). "},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"103Permeable Boundaries103religious piety and the more conceptual evocation of movement from one state to another. Meanwhile, in their discussion of some votive uteri which are shaped like vessels, Sandrine Ducaté- Paarmann and Veronique Dasen note that vessels in Etruscan iconography are frequently associated with birth, death and rebirth – all stages which involve the movement between ontological and social categories.92 In this way, the ‘hybrid’ votives dedi-cated in the sanctuary may have continued the work performed by the sanctuary architecture (see Izzet’s reading, cited above), through utilising the body to create a specially demarcated ritual space in which boundaries were transgressed, and in which it was possible for bodies and objects to move between one state and another.The votives from central Italy are, as we have seen, unannotated and her-metic. We cannot know why they were dedicated, and in this way they help to create an exclusive, intimate relationship between the dedicant and deity who was being approached. At the same time, however, we do know that many of the situations in which votives were offered could be described in terms of change and transformation. Ancient textual sources confirm that votives were often dedicated in order to mark transitional moments in people’s lives – ‘rites of passage’ like birth, puberty, sickness, marriage, retirement and death.93 The widely accepted modern interpretations of the Etrusco- Italic terracottas also frequently associate them with moments of transition and transformation – most commonly the moment of bodily healing, but also conception and birth. In these latter instances, the transi-tion commemorated by the uteri and swaddled babies might be understood as a move from non- life to life, or alternatively as the ‘bringing into being’ of a mother – a change in personal status and identity that involved a profound remapping of social and familial relations. The models of swaddled babies have been associated with other rites of passage too: Graham, again, has argued that they may have been ‘associated with the successful negotiation 92 Dasen and Ducaté- Paarmann (2006). 93 The Greek Anthology contains many epigrams that describe or invent votives dedicated at times of transition, including adolescence (e.g. 6.309, on ‘toys of boyhood’ dedicated to Hermes Phocles), marriage (6.280, on a girl’s toys and hairband dedicated to Artemis before her wedding), childbirth (6.271, on shoes and a gown dedicated to Artemis by a couple in thanks for her help with an easy labour), retirement (6.210, on a courtesan’s dedication of her sandals and mirror to Cypris; 6.204, on a carpenter’s dedication of his tools to Athena ‘on ceasing from his calling’) and death (6.254, Statyllius dedicating his clothes, false hair, shoes and flute to Priapus ‘when Time was about to drag him down Hades’ path’). On the relationship of epigrams to real votive objects, see Platt (2003) (on epigrams about the Knidian Aphrodite); Petsalis- Diomidis (2016). Cf. also the following example from the Roman world: ‘boys were accustomed when they left their boyhood, to dedicate their bulla to the di lares, just as girls dedicated their dolls’. Ps. Acr.

"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"104Under the Skin: Republican Italy104of a distinct passage of life in which the body of an infant emerged from the period of swaddling in an appropriate state to become a member of wider society’.94 The final section of the previous chapter suggested that the fragmented form of Classical Greek anatomical votives might have helped to mark or even enact this transformation in the dedicant’s status. Here, I would suggest that for these ancient Italian dedicants who went to the sanctuary to ask for (or commmemorate) a transition in status or identity, the imagery of hybridity that confronted them there may have performed a similar function.ConclusionThe Etrusco- Italic body parts studied in this chapter have provided us with a valuable opportunity to address the theme of change and continuity in the anatomical votive tradition, and to explore some of the symbolic res-onances of the ancient votive imagery from this area. While these Italian votives have often been seen as the ‘descendants’ of the Classical Greek material considered in Chapter 2, here I have suggested that, even if the Etrusco- Italic votives did derive from earlier Greek prototypes, the commu-nities of central Italy actively adapted the offerings, transforming them to reflect their own visual traditions, religious frameworks, and ideas about the human body. In particular, the new range of votive types reflected the sali-ence of the internal body in Etrusco- Italic religion, and the central role that it played in the ongoing conversation between mortals and gods. Looking at these votive images of innards has in turn brought out the themes of sacrifice, hybridity and metamorphosis, and has indicated how the votives on display in the sanctuary continued to shape the experience of later visi-tors. The ‘open torso’ images have also provided some particularly graphic examples of fragmentation, giving further support to the hypothesis that the ancient anatomical votives not only served to localise physical illness, but also invoked and responded to other contemporary discourses about the broken and fragmented body.This chapter has also demonstrated how looking at votives in a com-parative framework has the potential to deepen our understanding of the whole anatomical tradition. Identifying the differences between the Greek and Etrusco- Italic assemblages led us to ask not only why internal organs were added in Italy, but also why they had been absent in Greece. In the 94 Graham (2013), 226. "},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"105Conclusion105latter case, I have drawn attention to a number of possible reasons why innards were not dedicated in Greek sanctuaries, which include sacred reg-ulations about purity, the limitations of what was perceived as ‘represent-able’ in the new Classical art, and medical views that were in operation in both ‘rational’ texts and the healing sanctuary. Of course, these factors are difficult to disentangle from one another, and it is likely that we are facing a constellation of interlinked beliefs rather than any one single obstacle. The point about the limitations of Classical art may seem convincing on its own, but the visual conventions of Greek figural art undoubtedly reflect more deep- seated cultural beliefs, which seem to have been particularly stringent in the religious context of the sanctuary. In this way, although it is hard to pinpoint any single reason for the addition or suppression of certain votive types, the discussion here indicates how the range of anatomical votives in any one context reflects much broader features of the society in which they were produced, further demonstrating the importance of these objects as historical sources.By the first century bc, the use of votive body parts in Italy had all but died out, and healing vows were now commemorated in the form of writ-ten inscriptions. The reasons for the demise of the anatomical votive cult are still unclear: the spread of Greek medical knowledge throughout the Italian peninsula and the development of new medical technologies have been suggested as relevant factors, as have broader socio- economic changes in the populations of worshippers attending sanctuaries, and new ways of perceiving and representing personal identity.95 But whatever the reasons for the demise of the votive cult in Italy, elsewhere in the Roman Empire it only grew in popularity. In the next chapter, we move away from the centre of the classical world to the provincial hinterland of Roman Gaul, where we encounter yet another dynamic remaking of the anatomical votive tradition. 95 For votives being superseded by Greek medicine, see Blagg (1983), 46; Potter (1985), 40; Girardon (1993), 31; Söderlind (2002), 346– 58 (we might note, however, that physicians and votives coexisted in Greece). On votives reflecting changes in social status see Arthur (1991), 46– 7; Lesk (2002), 195. On votives and new forms of identity, with a particular focus on permeability and distributed personhood, see Graham (2017). "},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"1061064 The Anxiety of Influence: Anatomical Votives in Roman Gaul, First Century bc– First Century adOur third case study takes us to Roman Gaul, and to the wooden, metal and stone votive models of body parts that were dedicated there from the mid- first century bc onwards. Of all the anatomical votives studied in this book, these Gallic objects are perhaps the most challenging to interpret – partly on account of the complexity of the cultural background from which they emerged.1 Scholars generally agree that the practice of dedicating anatom-ical votives was introduced to Gaul by the Romans during or shortly after the conquest of the province in 58 to 51 bc, and that the Gallic votives were thus closely related to the Etrusco- Italic terracottas studied in the previous chapter of this book. However, many aspects of this process remain unclear, and anyone hoping to investigate this material is faced with some difficult questions about the identity of the votives’ users, their reasons for adopting the cult and how these objects related to existing local practices of visually fragmenting the body, which happened primarily in spheres of conflict and aggression.Despite these difficulties in interpretation, the Gallic votives offer us another extremely valuable opportunity to explore aspects of continu-ity and change in the anatomical votive tradition. This chapter begins with an introduction to the two earliest- known assemblages of anatom-ical votives in Gaul, which were found at the sanctuary of Dea Sequana at the source of the Seine in Burgundy, and the ‘Source des Roches’ at Chamalières in the Auvergne (see map at Figure 4.1). After this, I give a brief account of earlier Gallic practices involving the fragmented body, in order to illustrate how far the adoption of anatomical votives in Gaul constituted a shift in indigenous approaches to the parted body. The second half of the chapter looks in more detail at the transmission and 1 It is worth noting here that the terms ‘Roman’ and ‘Gallic’ are retained for convenience, as a way into beginning to verbalise the complex relationship between material culture and identity at these sites. However, underlying my usage of these terms is the expectancy that the interpersonal and intergroup relationships that the votives helped to construct were more nuanced and varied than this simple binary opposition might suggest. As Greg Woolf has summarised, ‘Gallic identities were opposed during an early – but brief – formative period; thereafter that opposition was supplanted by more familiar Roman contrasts, between rich and poor, educated and uneducated, military and civilian and so forth.’ Woolf (1998), 206.

This entails acknowledging and exploring the chronologi-cal gap between the Etrusco- Italic and Gallic material, as well as drawing attention to how the votives from these two areas were visually different. My analysis of the ‘new’ features of the Gallic votives focuses on some of the model heads which are strikingly similar to older, pre- Roman rep-resentations discussed in the earlier part of the chapter.

Stone votives representing parts of the body clus-ter in the region of Burgundy in central-eastern France; notable findspots include the shrine of Essarois which grew around a small tributary of the Seine, the shrine of Sainte- Sabine on the banks of the River Ouche and the urban spring- sanctuary of Apollo Moritasgus at Alesia.4 Wooden sculptures have also been found in a number of sanctuaries around Gaul, most com-monly at sites where the presence of water has aided their preservation.5Votives made from all three of these materials have been found at the sanctuary of Dea Sequana at the source of the Seine, which is located about thirty kilometres to the north- west of the modern city of Dijon.6 The earliest building at the Seine sanctuary, the fanum temple, was constructed around the middle of the first century bc, and the sanctuary was progressively monumentalised until eventually it spread over four terraces (Figure 4.2).7 2 On the role of water in Gallic religion see Bourgeois (1991) and (1992). 3 On these metal votives see Cazanove and Joly (2011), 667; Fauduet and Rabeisen (1993); Fauduet (2010), 252– 8; Joly and Lambert (2004).

These correlations could possibly be connected to changing fashions, and scholars have sug-gested that the wooden votives – which have been dated by dendrochro-nology to between 30 bc and ad 30 – may have been gradually replaced by stone.10 Alternatively, it may be that certain materials were seen as par-ticularly suitable for representing certain body parts, perhaps on account of their symbolic qualities.

Many of these stone figures are depicted carrying objects, including round ‘talismans’, bags, animals and fruit, which may all have represented offerings (or, in the case of ani-mals, sacrifices) destined for the goddess.12 As well as these adult and child figures, we also find stone models of swaddled babies (Figure 4.4).13 The wooden figurines often show a simple, plank- like body surmounted by a much more detailed head (Figure 4.5).14The most numerous body parts from the Seine sanctuary are the isolated models of heads, which number 193 examples.15 The style of the heads var-ies from the highly realistic to the schematic; most of the wooden heads are represented at a scale somewhere between half- and full lifesize, and the majority of examples appear to have been roughly carved from logs, with the contours of the face following the natural shape of the wood, and with details such as the eyes, nose, mouth and hair carved using a chisel. As well as the single heads/ busts, there are also seventeen examples of wooden ‘stacked’ heads – long pieces of wood into which a series of two, three or four heads have been carved in a vertical line (Figure 4.6).16 Some examples consist simply of a cylindrical branch into which rough facial features have been incised, while in others the heads are moulded and separated by spin-dly necks. Claude Bourgeois has suggested that these plural head images may have been offerings made on behalf of group (perhaps a family), or alternatively that they may have been used to symbolise the intensity of the single dedicant’s prayer through the device of multiplication.

Scholars have wondered whether this lack of monumentalisation might reflect a deliberate choice to preserve the natural character of this sacred site – a choice that might also be reflected in the exclusive use of wood for the votives that were dedicated there.34 Alternatively, the proximity of this site to the settlement of Augustonemetum may have made the construc-tion of extra facilities such as accommodation or vendors’ stalls unnec-essary (the frequent use of the site by local people might also help to explain why such a large number of votives were dedicated over a rela-tively short period).A comprehensive catalogue of the votive material from Chamalières has been published by Anne- Marie Romeuf and Monique Dumontet, and Table 4.2 summarises their data. Anatomical offerings make up the vast propor-tion of the finds: 1,790 legs and feet were found alongside 390 hands and arms, 140 heads and busts (three examples of which are of the ‘stacked’ type attested at the Dea Sequana sanctuary), 35 lower half- bodies, 18 polyvis-ceral plaques, 6 or 7 plaques with breasts, and a single pair of eyes in bronze attached to a wooden background.35 These types of anatomical votive are all familiar from the Seine sanctuary discussed above, although the rela-tive proportions of body parts represented at each site are rather differ-ent. While at the Seine the part most commonly represented was the head, the majority of the offerings from Chamalières are limbs; and while fifty- three polyvisceral representations were discovered at the sanctuary of Dea Sequana, only eighteen examples were found at Chamalières. Perhaps the most noticeable difference between the two sites, however, is the material in which the votives appear: in contrast to the wood, bronze and stone at the Seine, almost all the offerings at Chamalières are made from wood (the few exceptions include a single pair of bronze eyes, mounted on a wooden plaque, and a lead curse tablet).The wooden sculptures from Chamalières have been categorised into three styles, which correlate closely with the type of wood used.36 The objects carved in beech are the most numerous and stylistically homogene-ous; these appear to have been carved in series, and the styles of body part vary comparatively little.37 Oak seems to have been reserved for the finer and more ‘classicising’ pieces, while the small number of objects made from 34 Romeuf (1986); Green (1999), 98– 100. 35 For in- depth discussion of finds see Romeuf and Dumontet (2000), 62– 96. 36 Romeuf and Dumontet (2000), 114– 17. 37 Romeuf and Dumontet (2000), 114.

Most of the men are dressed in a tunic or traditional cape, while most of the women wear a cloak draped over a long tunic.40 One-third of the figures are shown carrying objects, which are probably to be interpreted as offerings – these include round or rectangular objects, corn, pinecones, purses, bunches of grapes, a bag and a bird.41 In terms of gender, the full- length statues present a male– female ratio of 65– 35, and the isolated heads reflect a similar distribution.42 The heads sometimes depict the tops of the shoulders, or alternatively just the neck (Figure 4.13), and like the full- length figures they sport a range of hairstyles.43 Three groups Table 4.2.

Of the models of lower bodies, most are shown wearing belts and tunics, but some are naked, and in four cases the genitals are shown – of these, one is male, and three are female (Figure 4.15).The models of legs, which are always shown bare, are by far the most numerous objects in the deposit; most examples show the entire leg and foot from the top of the thigh down to the toes (Figure 4.16).45 The arms are generally bare (84 per cent), although some examples are covered with a sleeve to the wrist (16 per cent) while 22.5 per cent hold a round offering (Figure 4.17).46 The organs depicted on the polyvisceral plaques have been identified as the trachea, oesophagus, heart, stomach, lungs, diaphragm, intestines and kidneys (Figure 4.18).47 Six or seven plaques represent female breasts, and, as mentioned above, one pair of bronze eyes was found, mounted on a wooden plaque.48 Romeuf and Dumontet note that the pau-city of eye models at Chamalières contrasts with the prevalence of this body part at other sites in Gaul and throughout the ancient world, and connect this imbalance to the fact that it is difficult to carve eyes in wood. Instead, they propose, images of eyes may have been painted on the flat wooden plaques found amongst the other, anthropomorphic offerings, which number more than a thousand.49 Some of these plaques still bear traces of 44 Romeuf and Dumontet (2000), 75; cat. nos. 459, 460, 461. 45 Legs and feet: Romeuf and Dumontet (2000), 80– 5, cat. nos. 829– 1551. 46 Arms and hands: Romeuf and Dumontet (2000), 78– 9, cat. nos. 504– 828. 47 Romeuf and Dumontet (2000), 85.

This version becomes significant in the context of the healing sanctuary, because it essentially inverts the process of bodily reparation that is normally associated with anatomical offerings – a process in which ‘crooked’ (or more generally anomalous) body parts become ‘straight’ and mended.From Pre- Roman to Roman Gaul: Changing Approaches to the Fragmented BodyChamalières and the Seine are the earliest assemblages of anatomical votive offerings currently known in Gaul, and as such they offer us some crucial insight into how Gallic beliefs and practices changed over a longue durée. Olivier de Cazanove and Martine Joly have already discussed how the adoption of the anatomical votives forms part of a wider change in the nature of Gallic votive offerings during the period just after the Roman conquest, when weapons, animal bones and amphorae were gradually replaced by brooches, coins, inscribed altars and anatomical votive offer-ings.56 However, as well as indicating new religious regimes, the anatomical votives also attest to changing understandings of the human body. Before we look in more detail at how and why these changes occured, this chapter will briefly review some of the evidence for pre- Roman treatments of the body in Gaul, focusing here on the theme of bodily fragmentation. Putting the anatomical votives in the context of these older representations and practices is worthwhile, not only because it can help us to reconstruct some of the resonances of the later anatomical votives, but also because it draws attention to how far the adoption of these offerings constituted a shift in Gallic ways of dividing the body into its constituent pieces.When we look at the disarticulation of the human body in pre- Roman Gaul, we see a wide array of regional and chronological variation, which is nevertheless undercut by one recurrent theme – that is, the separation of 55 On the ritual of evocatio deorum see Gustafsson (2000). 56 Cazanove and Joly (2011), 666, with further bibliography for these different votive types. Cf. Aberson (2007). Indigenous Gallic practices focus on rituals of dedicating enemy weapons to the gods, as attested by passages from ancient authors (cf. Caesar Gallic Wars 6.17 and Tacitus Annals 13.57). Cazanove and Joly also note that some Greco- Gallic votive inscriptions from the second– first centuries bc found in the south of France include the word bratoudekantem (‘for favours received’), but they acknowledge that these inscriptions might be seen as evidence of Romanisation.

Some of the most vivid images are found in the work of the Greek writers Diodorus Siculus and Strabo, who describe Gallic practices of head- hunting in the context of inter- group warfare.When their enemies fall [the Gauls] cut off their heads and fasten them about the necks of their horses; and turning over to their attendants the weapons of their opponents, all covered with blood, they carry [the heads] off as booty, singing a paean over them and striking up a song of victory, and these first- fruits of battle they fasten by nails upon their houses, just as men do, in certain kinds of hunting, with the heads of wild beasts they have mastered. The heads of their most distin-guished enemies they embalm in cedar- oil and carefully preserve in a chest, and these they exhibit to strangers, gravely maintaining that in exchange for this head some one of their ancestors, or their father, or the man himself, refused the offer of a great sum of money. And some men among them, we are told, boast that they have not accepted an equal weight of gold for the head they show, displaying a barbarous sort of greatness of soul; for not to sell that which constitutes a witness and proof of one’s valor is a noble thing. Diodorus Siculus 5.29.4– 558In addition to their folly, they have a barbarous and absurd custom, common how-ever with many nations of the north, of suspending the heads of their enemies from their horses’ necks on their return from battle, and when they have arrived nail-ing them as a spectacle to their gates. Posidonius says he witnessed this in many different places, and was at first shocked, but became familiar with it in time on account of its frequency. The heads of any illustrious persons they embalm with cedar, exhibit them to strangers, and would not sell them for their weight in gold. However, the Romans put a stop to these customs, as well as to their modes of sac-rifice and divination, which were quite opposite to those sanctioned by our laws.

In fact, both authors appear to have been drawing on a common source – the work of Greek writer Posidonius, who lived from c.135 to 51 bc, and who visited Gaul in the period just before the Roman conquest.60 Posidonius appears in Strabo’s text as an eyewit-ness who gradually became desensitised to viewing severed heads; Strabo himself dubs the practice ‘barbarous and absurd’, while Diodorus recog-nises parallels with the Greco- Roman custom of displaying animal heads as hunting trophies. In other texts, we find records of Romans coming into direct contact with head- hunting: Livy, for instance, recounts the decapi-tation of the Roman general Postumius by the North Italian Gaulish tribe of the Boii in 216 bc, and the siege of Clusium in Etruria in 295 bc, after which the victorious Gauls ‘came into sight, with heads hanging at their horse’s breasts or fixed on their lances, and singing their customary songs of triumph’.61The extent to which we can take these texts as documentary descrip-tions is limited: not only are they written by foreign observers rather than local practitioners, they are also inevitably shaped by the broader literary context in which they appear.62 However, there is also a wealth of material evidence – both iconographical representations and osteological remains – which can help us understand the range of ways in which human heads were treated in the context of Iron Age warfare. The image of a male warrior juxtaposed with human heads is found at several sites throughout France, on a wide variety of objects including coins, sculpted reliefs and pottery. One ceramic fragment found in a late Iron Age grave at Aulnat in the Auvergne – very close to the sanctuary at Chamalières – demonstrates how this evidence can nuance the picture painted by the classical texts.63 The fragment shows a mounted warrior with a severed human head tied around the neck of the horse – at first sight, a seductively close visual illustration of 60 On Posidonius and the extent of his travels, see Kidd (1999). Cf. also Nash (1976). 61 Clusium: Livy 10.26. Postumius: Livy 23.24. 62 The barbarian head- hunt was an established literary topos in antiquity: cf. Herodotus’ description of Scythian head- hunting at Histories 4.63– 6. Francois Hartog has convincingly shown how Herodotus constructed this description in such a way as to prioritise the depiction of Scythian Otherness. For example, Scythian head- hunting is presented by Herodotus as a highly individualistic pursuit; this contrasts strongly with Classical Greek warfare, which is characterised in the same text by a respect for the fighting order of the phalanx, and the relatively ‘democratic’ division of the weapons amongst all those who helped win the battle – regardless of how many warriors they had killed individually.

However, archaeologists have reconstructed the large ovoid vessel to which this frag-ment belongs, enabling us to put this horseman back into a bigger picture. This reveals that the armed rider was pursuing, not human enemies, as the literary descriptions might lead us to expect, but a group of wild and domestic animals. Thus, while the ‘life- cycle’ of severed heads according to Strabo and Diodorus has them being tied immediately to the horses, then taken home and nailed to posts before being embalmed and displayed, this pot implies that the dead heads may in fact have been mobile and in action for much longer.Isolated heads also appear in monumental sculpture, often in juxtaposi-tion with images of huntsmen or warriors. Some of the earliest representa-tions – dated as early as 800 bc according to some scholars – come from Saint- Michel- de- Valbonne near the modern town of Hyères in Provence, from a hill that was later the site of an Iron Age sanctuary.64 Two freestand-ing sandstone pillars are carved with schematic outlines of human heads: one of the pillars shows five isolated heads arranged so as to surround the schematic outline of a horse and rider, while the other shows a line of three heads in a vertical row.65 Other images of mounted warriors and isolated heads have been identified at the sites of Glanon and Mouriès, while two more stone pillars showing groups of heads come from the oppidum of Entremont near the Greek colony of Marseille.66 One of these Entremont pillars was found reused in a building of the mid- second century bc, but has been dated from much earlier – possibly as early as 500 bc (Figure 4.21).67 Measuring just over 2.5 m in height, it depicts on one of its four sides an arrangement of twelve near- lifesize heads, the lowest of which is turned upside down. The second block from Entremont has two of its sides decorated with two columns of heads, and a third side decorated with two incised ears of wheat.68 The meaning of these Entremont pillars is more ambiguous than other representations where severed heads are juxtaposed with warriors, and some scholars have seen the pillars as evidence of an ancestor cult, or as linked to human and agricultural fertility as opposed 64 Brun (1999).

Outside Provence, there is a wealth of osteo-logical evidence from other regions: cranial fragments frequently appear in settlement sites in Languedoc, west of the Rhône, while skulls and cervical vertebrae found at the sanctuary site of Gournay in northern France show clear signs of decapitation and subsequent display.74Even the small selection of examples discussed here clearly demonstrates that the head- cult in Gaul was not a monolithic phenomenon, but was instead subject to many regional and chronological variations. Despite this heterogeneity, however, these pre- Roman practices share certain features, which differentiate them collectively from the anatomical votive cult which followed them. Perhaps most obviously, the anatomical votive cult repre-sents a shift in focus away from the head and onto other parts of the body. As the data from the Seine and Chamalières have indicated, the head did feature in these later assemblages, but here it appeared in the context of 69 On ancestor cult, see Benoît (1975); Arcelin and Rapin (2003), 190– 1, Armit (2012), 99.

In this way, while in pre- Roman Gaul the head functioned as the priviliged pars pro toto symbol of the person, the anatom-ical votives entailed a more comprehensive dismemberment of the body into several different parts – not only the head, but the arms, legs, genitals and internal parts too.Other differences between the pre- and post- Roman views of the body concern the question of ‘whose body’, and the context in which the body was divided. Despite some subtle differences in interpretation, the schol-arly consensus is that the earlier Iron Age images represent heads taken from dead bodies – whether these be of an ‘in- group’ (ancestors) or ‘out- group’ (enemies). In contrast, although the visually fragmented form of the anatomical votive always allows space for ambiguity, these objects are normally assumed to relate to the living bodies of their dedicants, which they symbolise by a complex strategy of metonymy. And while most of the earlier Gallic head images seem to relate to the spheres of aggression and warfare, most of the anatomical votives are to be connected to the diametrically opposed sphere of bodily healing. Further subtle differences relate to the places and modes of display, and the identities of the objects’ intended audiences. The anatomical votives were explicitly addressed to the gods, while in most cases it seems that the aggressive displays of human heads may have had the primary function of structuring and rein-forcing human social relations. However, this distinction is not entirely clear- cut: many of the older head pillars and warrior images may have had a religious function too, while the later anatomical votives would also have been contemplated by mortal viewers, playing – so the rest of this chapter will argue – a central role in constructing human relationships and identities.From Italy to Gaul: Colonising the Body?How can we explain these shifts in the modes and contexts for bodily division? The introduction of anatomical votives in Gaul has traditionally been seen in relation to the Roman conquest, and the importation of older Etrusco- Italic traditions.75 Indeed, one of the most striking features of these Gallic deposits in the context of this book’s investigation is the reappearance of types from the Etrusco- Italic deposits studied in the previous chapter of 75 See e.g. Deyts (1994), 5; Cazanove (2009); Cazanove (2013), 24– 5.

Heads and busts, eyes, breasts, arms and legs, hands and feet, and internal and genital organs – all of the human body parts that appear in Gaul are, as we have seen, attested in earlier Italian assemblages. It is particularly noteworthy that models of internal organs and swaddled babies appear in Gaul, since these types are otherwise unique to Etrusco- Italic contexts; the Gallic material also includes models of animal limbs (Figure 4.19), as well as depictions of the human lower body which, as Romeuf and Dumontet have noted, are similar to those seen at ELC sites like Tarquinia, Paestum and Tessennano (Figure 3.7).76The formal similarities between the Italic and Gallic votives, then, cou-pled with the historical scenarios of Latin colonisation and Roman con-quest, have led most scholars to conclude that the practice of dedicating anatomical votives was brought over to Gaul from Italy. As Greg Woolf has commented in relation to the material from Dea Sequana and Chamalières, ‘the fact that the ex- votos were of wood and their watery contexts have cer-tainly encouraged the search for iron age origins, but at neither site has any indication been found that cult preceded the reign of Augustus, and the rites involved are perfectly comprehensible in terms of Roman ritual tra-ditions’.77 William Van Andringa has described the adoption of votives as a ‘decisive phase of acculturation ... a Romanisation of cults’, while Veronique Rey- Vodoz sees them ‘as clear signs of the Gauls’ openness to the new reli-gious practices that formed part of conceptual baggage of the new [Roman] p o w e r ’.78 In this way, the votives have been seen as part of the more general influence of Rome on Gallic customs and beliefs – evidence of a process of ‘Religious Romanisation’, similar to that proposed by some scholars for the diffusion of terracotta votives in central Italy.79 76 Romeuf and Dumontet (2000), 75, with n. 51; cf.

One example is found in the work of the Roman poet Lucan, who records that Julius Caesar ordered the destruction of a shrine at Marseille where the trees were sprinkled with the blood of human sac-rifices.81 Similarly, talking about the Gallic tradition of collecting enemy heads, Strabo comments that ‘the Romans put a stop to these customs, as well as to their modes of sacrifice and divination, which were quite opposite to those sanctioned by our laws’.82 Pliny claims that Tiberius rid Gaul of human sacrifice as well as ‘their druids and all kinds of bards and healers’; he adds that ‘it is impossible to imagine how much is owed to the Romans for suppressing these atrocities, according to which the most religious rite was to kill a man, and the healthiest practice was to devour him’.83 The archaeological record may also preserve traces of Roman interventions in body- centred religious practices, as at the Iron Age sanctuary of Ribemont- sur- Ancre in the Somme, which had been set up in the early part of the third century bc.84 At this site, more than eighty headless corpses had been hung around the walls, while the dismembered remains of around 200 indi-viduals (mostly young men) were placed in a central enclosure along with weapons. This structure, and its display of what has been interpreted as a series of battle trophies constituted of the mortal remains of enemies offered to the gods, appears to have been dismantled at the time of the Roman con-quest and replaced with a Roman- style temple. Meanwhile, the Entremont warrior statues were deliberately and comprehensively destroyed in the late second century bc, probably by the Roman army.85 These examples sug-gest that the Roman intrusion into Gaul involved the active suppression of bodily practices which had a long history in that area, and which may have that ‘recognizably Roman forms of religious activity were widely adopted in precisely the same period as an older ritual tradition was being in part abandoned, as sanctuaries were taking on a markedly new physical form, and as the gods were being given new names and, for the first time, faces. The inevitable conclusion is that Roman religion had an attraction for Gauls that was also based on the primary function of religion, to make sense of the world and of human experience of it. Whether or not the term conversion is used to describe it, a revolution in practice and belief had occurred in Gaul.’ 80 See for instance Bernault (2006). 81 Lucan Pharsalia 3.372– 417. 82 Strabo Geography 4.4.5. 83 Pliny Natural History 30.4. 84 Armit (2012), 197– 201; Cadoux (1984a) and (1984b); Brunaux (2004). 85 Armit (2012), 190– 2. "},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"143Colonising the Body?143been central to the construction of power relations within Gallic society. Conceptually, then, the importation of the Etrusco- Italic anatomical votive cult to Gaul might be placed alongside more aggressive forms of Roman intervention in earlier Gallic concepts of the body.There is, however, more than one problem with this apparently straight-forward scenario. The first problem is chronological, for there is a hiatus between the demise of the anatomical votive cult in Italy and the appear-ance of the cult in Gaul. In Italy, the widespread use of anatomical votives appears to decline in the later second century bc before ceasing altogether in the first century bc.86 Meanwhile, according to current data, the earliest Gallic votives – those from Chamalières and the Seine – have been dated to the first half of the first century ad. Of course, it may well be the case that future archaeological discoveries will fill in this gap by bringing to light later examples of votives in Italy or earlier examples in Gaul. Another pos-sible solution has been suggested by Olivier de Cazanove, who points out that while the production of anatomical terracottas ceased in Italy during the first century bc, at certain sanctuaries the votives may have been visible until much later.87 As noted in the previous chapter, votives in Etrusco- Italic sanctuaries were normally cleared from display at periodic intervals, but this may not always have been the case, particularly once the numbers of visitors and new dedications had begun to dwindle. At the Porta Nord sanc-tuary at Vulci, for instance, the votives date to the third and second centu-ries bc but were found in association with a Domitianic coin and lamps of the second century ad, which indicates that they had been buried at some point during the Imperial period; meanwhile at Ponte di Nona near Rome it appears that the Republican period votives may have been buried as late as the fifth century ad.88The evidence presented by de Cazanove raises the possibility that the Gallic votives were descended from an Etrusco- Italic votive cult that was still visible at the time that the Gallic votives began to be made – but that was no longer practised. This is an intriguing scenario, for there is a signif-icant difference between the idea that the Romans came into Gaul and car-ried on with their traditional practices which were then emulated by Gallic people and the idea that the Romans in Gaul deliberately ‘resurrected’ what was essentially an outmoded, fossilised ritual.89 In this latter case, we can 86 See conclusion of Chapter 3 above, with references. 87 Cazanove (2008) and (2017). 88 As noted by Glinister (2006), 20. For Ponte di Nona see Potter and Wells (1985), 38. For Porta Nord, see Pautasso (1994). 89 Again, Woolf discusses how Rome provided models for Gallic cult ‘by accident or design’: ‘But perhaps it is more likely that to begin with the creation of new cults in the communities of "},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"144The Anxiety of Influence: Roman Gaul144only wonder about the motivations for such a revival. One possibility is that the votives were being used by Romans to reaffirm their own religious and cultural identity in the destabilising context of the colonial encoun-ter.90 Alternatively, it may be that the incoming Romans viewed anatomical votives as a more acceptable alternative to older Gallic practices involv-ing real human body parts, such as the aggressive display of enemy heads already discussed in this chapter. Such suggestions can only ever be hypo-thetical, but it is nevertheless important to acknowledge that the archaeo-logical material raises such conundrums, which force us to think through possible ways that the evidence might relate to a historical reality.From Italy to Gaul: Reception and TransformationApart from this chronological hiatus between the Roman and Gallic offer-ings, we also need to acknowledge how far the votive cult was transformed in the process of its reception by Gallic craftsmen. The full- length portraits of dedicants are the clearest examples of this, since they are represented wearing local Gallic styles of costume and hairstyle. Simone Deyts has already dis-cussed the extreme schematicism of some of the wooden sculptures from the Seine, and their stylistic relationship with earlier Celtic models. She compares the wooden statues from the Seine with Central European stone statues like the ‘warrior’ from Holzerlingen, showing how both sets of images are charac-terised by rectilinear facial features and arms shown in shallow relief against a columnar body.91 It might also be argued that the stone and wooden votive statuettes from Gaul recall older visual traditions of separating the head from the body. Earlier in this chapter, I argued that the votive body parts represent a fundamental move away from this ‘binary’ form of division; at the same time, some of the full- length statuettes from Chamalières and the Seine seem to have retained elements of this earlier exaltation de la tête, particulary those examples which contrast a simple, plank- like body with a far more detailed, almost portrait- like head (e.g. Figure 4.5).92Roman Gaul was more haphazard, by simple imitation of the cults practised by the Romans in their midst or in neighbouring coloniae and at the altar, and in the light of the advice and reactions of Roman officials and residents.’ Woolf (1998), 222– 3. 90 As Chris Gosden has written, ‘colonial cultures were created by all who participated in them, so that all had agency and social effect, with colonizer and colonized alike being radically changed by the experience.’ Gosden (2004), 25. 91 Deyts (1966a), 199. 92 Some of the anthropomorphic stelai found at Chamalières show a distinct separation of the head and the body. Cf. Vatin (1972), 42, who notes of statues reproduced at his pls. 4(a) and (e): ‘The head is proportionally tiny, worked with great care at the end of a long and slender bar of wood’. "},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"145Reception and Transformation145Besides the full- body statuary, the models of body parts from Italy and Gaul also indicate subtly different understandings of how the human body was to be divided into its constituent pieces. The range of body parts repre-sented in the Gallic deposits is narrower than in Italy, and does not include the ‘smaller’ body parts such as noses, tongues, ears, hearts, fingers, teeth, penises and wombs that appear in such large quantities on the Italian penin-sula.93 In Gaul, with the exception of the eye models, smaller body parts are kept within the more globalising representations of larger bodily regions. Internal organs, for instance, are found in the context of polyvisceral rep-resentations, while male and female genitals appear either on full- length or half- body statues. Furthermore, even those body parts that are attested in both Italy and Gaul are often iconographically quite different. Arms are always represented singly in Italy, while at the Seine sanctuary we find pairs of arms shown together, holding out a round offering (Figure 4.11). Like some of the single arms which also hold out offerings (Figure 4.17), these are ‘self- reflexive’ representations, ‘offerings depicting offerings’, which deflect attention away from the arm itself, and onto the act of dedication. Rather than simply presenting a disembodied, decontextualised body part, these objects instead inscribe the body part into a broader ritual context, while also retaining a sense of how the body part belongs to, and functions within, the wider context of the human body.Another distinctive feature of the Gallic material is the frequent rep-resentation of the same body part in multiple forms.94 One stone relief from the Seine represents three breasts in a row (Figure 4.9); another polyvisceral representation from this site appears to show the same anatomical motif repeated three times, while a similar polyvisceral relief from Chamalières shows a double anatomical motif.95 A stone relief from the Seine depicts a row of six legs, while another shows twin heads, placed side- by- side, and one of the bronze plaques is decorated with four eyes.96 Meanwhile, the 93 As noted by Deyts (1994), 5. 94 Deyts (1994), 83 notes that ‘Ce phénomène de repetition ... se rencontre fréquemment dans les sanctuaires de sources’; this claim is echoed at Romeuf and Dumontet (2000), 86. ‘Plural’ dedications of more than one body part model are also attested in the Athenian Asklepieion inventories, which record the dedication of four ears by a certain Boidias (1534, 108), of a typos with three bodies by a man named Thallos (1534, 244), and the dedication of a body and two hearts by woman called Mammia (1534, 248).

These multiple representations constitute a further way in which the Gallic votives differ from those found in Etrusco- Italic deposits, where the only ‘repeated’ body parts are pairs of eyes, breasts and testicles – all of which can still be seen as belonging to one individual. Instead, the Gallic multiples complicate the usual association between the anatomical votive and the body of the person who dedicated it, and force the viewer to consider exactly how these objects relate to the body or bodies of the real dedicant/ s. Might they be dedications made by groups of people? Were they intended to be separated eventually, as Roland Martin has wondered in relation to the stacked wooden heads?97 Do they signal the heightened intensity of pain, or hope, or an attempt to maximise the efficacy of the vow, as Claude Bourgeois has suggested?98 These are some of the possible meanings proposed in the scholarship, all of which recognise and try to rationalise the dissonance between these plural objects and other, single body part votives.In fact, these multiple images find echoes in earlier Iron Age art, signal-ling yet another way in which the incoming tradition of dedicating anatom-ical votives may have mapped onto existing techniques of visualising the body. Miranda Green has already noted that multiplication was a common feature of earlier Celtic art, and she suggests that these older images may have been attributed with a ‘magical’ function, which the makers of the later votives then attempted to harness.99 Meanwhile, the stacked wooden heads find very specific visual prototypes in earlier Iron Age art where, as we have seen already, the representation of groups of heads was a common phenomenon. Particularly close parallels are found in the carved stone pil-lars from Var and Entremont which, like the later votives, represent a group of stylised heads arranged in a vertical line, carved in a rough, schematic style, with eyes represented by simple dots or horizontal lines, noses by ver-tical lines, and mouths that are barely indicated (e.g. Figure 4.21). Noting this visual continuity between the Roman- era anatomicals and older Gallic imagery helps to balance the picture of abrupt change in Gallic attitudes to the body presented earlier on in this chapter; it also further nuances our 97 Martin (1963). Bourgeois (1991), 132 opposes this suggestion, on the grounds that it is more difficult to sculpt several motifs on the same background than sculpt motifs individually; furthermore, he points out that one of the anatomical plaques was sculpted on both sides, making it hard to imagine how these representations might eventually be separated.

Furthermore, it also takes us back to the debate about the meaning of these objects, raising the possibility that the stacked wooden heads may have been used to express similar meanings to the ear-lier images that they assimilated so closely. For instance, the stacked- head votives might have been used to evoke the same ideas of fertility that seem to be embodied in the objects like the Entremont bloc aux épis (the pillar which juxtaposes a series of heads with ears of corn); alternatively, these same head votives may have embodied general notions of individual or group success, by harnessing older imagery associated with masculinity and success in battle. One further possibility is that the votive heads had a more literal relationship to the theme of conflict, and that the aim of the dedicant was to hurt an adversary or group of adversaries, rather than to heal his or her own body. This last suggestion would see the heads as serv-ing an ‘incapacitating’ function, and would bring them conceptually closer to the anatomical curse tablets mentioned in Chapter 2, which obsessively list (and thereby systematically dismantle) the parts of the human body.This idea that the head votives might have been used to serve nefarious agendas is worth pressing, even though it goes against normal expectations of what anatomical votives were used for.100 The violent overtones of head imagery would have been hard for contemporary viewers to ignore, par-ticularly given the fact that practices of aggressive head- hunting seem to have increased and intensified during the first century bc, and were thus more than simply a faded memory.101 Severed enemy heads continued to be represented across different media: for instance, a coin of Dubnoreix (an Aeduan leader killed by the Roman army in 54 bc) depicts a man, perhaps Dubnoreix himself, holding a carnyx decorated with a boar’s head in one hand, and a severed human head in another (Figure 4.22).102 Têtes coupées may also appear on the relief sculpture of the Arch of Orange, which was erected by the Romans in the early first century ad.103 Alongside these new 100 Or perhaps because it goes against these expectations – for as Jas Elsner has commented (in relation to visual images of religious resistance in the Eastern Roman Empire) ‘It is important that ... images offer a potential reading as “culturally resistant” rather than an unambiguous one, since one of the problems of opposing a dominant state perfectly capable of religious persecution was that one always needed an alibi to avoid conviction if actually accused of opposition.’ Elsner (2006), 258.

Ultimately, whether we see this object as a private dedication against an unnamed individual, or (as Lambert would have it) a collective act of resistance by the Segovii against the incoming Romans, this defixio pro-vides some clear evidence that the divine patron of the spring was to be approached for purposes of bodily harm as well as bodily healing.

It has offered another example of how the votive cult was dynamically remodelled as it passed around the ancient world, and has argued that the existing narra-tives of transmission and influence fail to capture the complexity of the encounter between the Etrusco- Italic and Gallic imagery. We have seen that the Gallic votives indicate a shift in local ideas about when, why and how the human body should be divided into its constitutent pieces; at the same time, it is certainly not the case that Gauls were passive recipients of the Etrusco- Italic anatomical votive ritual. Instead, they remodelled the iconography of the votives to bring them in line with earlier representations of the body, and used the votives in ways that were consistent with famil-iar practices – whether this meant depositing them in the sacred springs and water sources that were so central in the Gallic sacred landscape, or perhaps even appropriating them as expressions of interpersonal or inter-necine conflicts. Insofar as they drew on and reconfigured both Roman and pre- Roman traditions, then, the votive material studied in this chapter might best be described in terms of a process of ‘hybridisation’ – a process in which (at least) two representational traditions collide to produce a new and highly distinctive way of making the human body visible.The Gallic votives provide a clear example of how anatomical offerings might be used – not only to construct ‘vertical’ relationships between mor-tals and gods – but also to shape ‘horizontal’ relationships between mor-tals.105 In this sense, the interpretations offered in this chapter have been influenced by the fact that the votives were introduced against the back-ground of the colonial encounter. Possible scenarios outlined here include the use of the votives by Romans to reaffirm and stabilise their cultural identity, and the adoption of votives by Gauls as symbols of conflict, or even of resistance. These particular suggestions start out from what is perhaps an overly stable, binary distinction between Romans and Gauls, and clearly 105 This interpretation draws on comments made by Richard Gordon: Gordon (2004a), 196, n. 16. "},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"150The Anxiety of Influence: Roman Gaul150cannot reflect the complex constellation of relationships that would have been formed within the changing socio- cultural background of Roman Gaul: nevertheless, they indicate how votives might be drawn into the ser-vice of personal, political and ideological agendas, as well as strictly reli-gious ones – a topic that will be explored further in the next chapter.Finally, the material in this chapter has also extended this book’s dis-cussion of the theme of fragmentation, by drawing attention to the visual and conceptual overlaps between the votives and existing Gallic practices of violent decapitation. As I have argued in earlier chapters, all anatomical votives have an intrinsically fragmentary quality – while one minute they might be seen as non- violent, autonomous symbols of an absent person, the slightest shift in perspective can transform them into startling images of bodily breakdown and mutilation. Such shifts often depend on the sur-rounding context of a body part: for instance, we are more likely to to rec-ognise the fragmentary nature of an anatomical votive if it is juxtaposed with other body parts (e.g. Figure 2.11), or if – as seems to have been the case in some Italian sanctuaries – it is displayed next to the implements of sacrificial butchery.106 Here, I would argue that the wider cultural context of a body part can also affect the fluidity and ease with which it shifts between a violent and non- violent meaning. Just as we might expect anatomical votives to take on more sinister qualities during periods of violent war-fare, it also seems likely that viewers of the Gallic votives would have been primed to see the votive heads as references to a real or symbolic decap-itation, given the ubiquity of these practices (or at least, representations of these practices) in Gallic culture. Their recognition of the anatomical votive’s fragmentary aspect would subsequently have mobilised that object to symbolise ideas such as conflict, aggression, sacrifice and pain – ideas which could exist independently from, or intertwined with, ideas of bodily sickness and healing. 106 As at Bolsena: see Chapter 3, n. 67.

These ste-lai are inscribed with Greek texts of varying lengths which speak openly of transgression, punishment and expiation; often they also bear figura-tive images, which show mortals and gods, as well as parts of the human body. The generic name given to these stelai has been the focus of some debate: ‘confession inscriptions’, ‘reconciliation inscriptions’ and ‘propitia-tory inscriptions’ are all terms that are regularly used, each of which empha-sises a slightly different aspect of the stelai’s function.1 Here I have chosen to use the term ‘propitiatory stelai’ (rather than ‘inscriptions’), which suits my interest in the materiality of these objects, and in their non- textual as well as their textual elements.2 In fact, one aim of this chapter is to shed some light on the relationship between the written texts of the stelai and the images that accompany them, focusing particularly on those examples which represent parts of the human body. Most of the anatomical votives that we have met so far in this book have been uninscribed, and thus give more limited insight into the specific ritual context for their dedication. The depictions of body parts studied in this chapter are instead attached to long personal narratives, offering an unparalleled opportunity to investigate the various meanings that the imagery of the parted body held in one part of the ancient world. 1 On the terminology used by different authors, see de Hoz (2009), 358, n. 1.

"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"152Punishing Bodies: Lydia and Phrygia152The first section of this chapter gives an introduction to the texts of the propitiatory stelai. I then move on to look at the images that appeared on the stelai, focusing in particular on the group of ‘anatomical’ representa-tions. The early part of this discussion looks at individual stelai, and exam-ines how each of the body parts relates to the inscription it accompanies. Most scholars who discuss these images assume that they reference the sick body of the dedicant, and in the majority of cases this does seem to be true, although occasionally the inscriptions suggest a link with the part of the body involved in a transgression. After considering the individual nar-ratives, I then step back to consider the propitiatory stelai as a whole group, arguing that the images of body parts can also be seen to connect with three broader themes that run through the written inscriptions, including the watchfulness of the gods, the permeability of the human body and the inextricable relationship that was understood to exist between the indi-vidual and the larger social group. In particular, I explore the notion that the body parts might sometimes have been seen as pars pro toto images of their dedicants – who were consequently envisaged as single fragments of a larger social or familial body. As such, the material introduced in this chapter adds another strand to our exploration of fragmentation, indicat-ing some further symbolic – and in this case deeply ideological – reso-nances of the votive body parts from classical antiquity.Introducing the Propitiatory StelaiThe corpus of propitiatory inscriptions compiled by Georg Petzl in 1994 lists and describes 124 examples, and at least twenty more have been found since the publication of Petzl’s book.3 The majority of these objects come from the area of the Katakekaumene in north- east Lydia. In Phrygia, ste-lai have been found in Akmonia and in the sanctuary of Apollo Lairbenos at Hierapolis; meanwhile, a few texts are known from Tiberiopolis in Maionia, and there is also a small group from north- east of Pergamon, on the borders of Mysia.4 The stelai were often erected around the rural or small- town temples that were dedicated to local divinities such as Anaïtis (‘the Mother’), Men, Apollo and Zeus Sabazios, although their original display context can rarely be determined.5 For the most part, the dedicants 3 Chaniotis (2004), 3 records 142 published texts, noting that several more await publication. 4 On the geographical distribution of the stelai see Chaniotis (2004), 3– 4; Gordon (2004a), 179– 81 with maps at figs. 1 and 2; Varinlioğlu (1983), 83. 5 As Mitchell notes, the sanctuary of Apollo Lairbenos/ Lermenos is the only sanctuary with propitiatory stelai to have been excavated or even identified.

A variety of social identities is attested on the stelai. Men, women and chil-dren all appear as dedicants, while some individuals are identified as threp-tai (adoptive children) and others as hierodouloi (‘sacred slaves’).6 Most of the names are Greek, but some are Roman, and a handful of dedicants may even have been Roman citizens.7 Although the Greek of the stelai is shaky and often ungrammatical, Maria Paz de Hoz has used the inscriptions to argue that the inhabitants of this rural area of Asia Minor had achieved at least a basic degree of literacy, which allowed them to read – and in some cases even to write – the texts on the propitiatory stelai.8stelai could be attributed to this site when Mitchell wrote his study. Other stelai were discovered away from their original sanctuary context, sometimes reused as architectural spolia (see for instance Petzl 110, which was found on the wall of a house in Badinlar, in the area of the Katakekaumene), or found on sale (see for instance Figure 5.7 here, which was seen in a shop in Kula, as recorded at SEG 29.1174). 6 On hierodouloi see Mitchell (1993), 193. An example of a stele dedicated by a hierodoulos is Petzl 5; SEG 38.1237 (here Figure 5.9). 7 E.g. C. Antonius Apellas (Petzl 108); Aurelius Stratoneikos (Petzl 76); Aur. Soter(i)chos (Petzl 110); Aur. Trophimos (Petzl 97); C. Lollius (Petzl 119). Gordon has suggested that these dedicants may have been peregrini – tenants on estates that were controlled remotely by city elites from the Hermos- Kogamos valley.

They range from 50 cm to 1 m in height, and most examples are cut down at the bottom so as to be slotted into a supporting stone base, while the top is often formed into a triangular gable adorned with palmette acroteria. These gables sometimes contain symbols of local divinities like the crescent moon and a rose, but at other times they are left empty. Each one of the propitiatory stelai bears a Greek inscription of between three and twenty- six lines in length, con-taining one or more of the following elements: (1) an invocation of the god (2) an account of a transgression committed by the dedicant of the stele, or someone close to him/ her; (3) details of the punishment subsequently sent by a deity, which is often physical or mental sickness, and sometimes even death; (4) reference to the expiation of the transgression, for instance a sacrifice; and (5) a testimony to the greatness of the gods, and sometimes a warning to others who might be tempted to commit similar offences.One representative example of an inscription appears on a stele that was erected in the area of Mons Toma in the territory of Saittai in 194– 5 (Figure 5.2).10 The extant part of the white marble stele is 82 cm tall, and its upper portion bears the (now fragmentary) images of two frontal figures. The fig-ure on the right probably represents the dedicant, Stratoneikos, that on the left a priestess holding a sceptre. The inscription translates as follows:Great is Zeus of the Twin Oaks. Stratoneikos son of Euangelos because of ignorance cut down one of the oaks belonging to Zeus Didymeites. And the god mobilized his own power because he (i.e. Stratoneikos) did not believe in him, and placed him [– ] in a deathlike condition. He was saved from great danger and raised the stele in gratitude. I declare that no one shall ever show contempt for his powers and cut down an oak. In the year 279, on the 18th of the month Panemos.Like many of the propitatory inscriptions, this one begins with a statement of the power of the god (Zeus Didymeites) and then introduces the dedicant (Stratoneikos). We hear that Stratoneikos cut down a tree belonging to the god – presumably one that stood in the sanctuary or sacred grove – and with καί of different functional elements, erroneous infinitive- constructions, and unfinished sentences’: de Hoz (2006), 140. 9 On the chronological distribution see Petzl (1994), vii and 145 (ad 57– 264); Chaniotis (1995), 4, n. 10, where he summarises ‘a precise date is known for fifty- six texts; most of them (thirty- seven texts) are dated to the period of the Antonines; only three texts can be safely dated to the first century’. 10 Petzl 10; SEG 28.914.

As his punishment, the god placed him in a ‘death-like condition’ (isothanatous). The story ends with a power-ful invocation to the viewer, and while the details of the narrative had been recounted in the third person, with ‘I declare’ (parangelo) Stratoneikos takes over to directly warn the viewer not make the same mistakes as he had – an explicit example of the ‘regulatory’ function of the stelai, which worked not only to expiate the past transgressions of those who erected them, but also to modify the future behaviour of those who looked at them.11Other propitiatory inscriptions are equally vivid and spontaneous in their storytelling, and bring these rural village communities back to life for modern readers. Most of the transgressions recorded in the inscriptions are of an explicitly religious nature, such as ritual impurity, perjury against the god, or – as in the case of Stratoneikos above – physical mistreatment of the sanctuary or its contents.12 We hear, for instance, about the acci-dental breakage of another votive stele by a child, the unlawful catching of sacred doves, the illegal herding of cattle on holy ground and the cutting of another sacred tree.13 Other ritual faults include the failure to fulfil a vow, the eating of meat that had not been sacrificed, washing outside the pre-scribed ritual period and, conversely, the wearing of dirty garments inside the sacred area.14 However, we also find ‘secular’ transgressions attested in the inscriptions, such as the failure to pay a loan, the theft of clothes and other property, and lack of respect for one’s mother- in- law.15 The inclu-sion of these ‘unneighbourly acts’, as Richard Gordon has dubbed them, indicates that the stelai worked to construct ‘horizontal’ relations between mortals as well as ‘vertical’ relations between men and gods, and suggests that one aspect of their function was to restore harmony at the level of the community.16 11 Cf. SEG 59.1497 – a stele on which the dedicant declares ‘I was punished on my buttock. I declare that nobody should disregard [the god], because he will find my stele as a (warning) example.’ Translation from Akıncı Öztürk and Tanrıver (2009), 87– 8, no. 2. On the propitiatory stelai as ‘aretological propaganda’, see de Hoz (2006). 12 Chaniotis classifies the transgressions as follows: ritual impurity, damage to sanctuaries and their possessions, the failure to fulfil a vow, refusal to offer services to a god or to attend the mysteries, perjury, unjustified curses and religious offences.

"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"157Introducing the Propitiatory Stelai157One noteworthy feature of the ‘confessions’ recorded on the stelai is that several of the dedicants claimed that they were agnoein – ‘unknowing’ – at the moment in which the transgression was committed. Stratoneikos cut down the oaks because he was unaware of the fact that they were divine property, and similar claims are made in a number of the other stelai.17 Such insistence on the dedicant’s ignorance raises questions about the mechanics of guilt and confession – for if the dedicants did not know that they were sinning at the time of the transgression, when and how did they find out? It may be that the sudden appearance of an illness prompted the dedicant to reflect on their past actions and identify a transgression in retrospect, per-haps with the help of oracles, prophets or dreams.18 The human body might thus be conceived as playing a divinatory or ‘mantic’ role, functioning – like the body of the sacrificial animal – as a medium through which the gods might express their displeasure. In this way, the propitiatory stelai echo aspects of the Etrusco- Italic polyvisceral votives discussed in Chapter 3 of this book, as well as other traditions of body divination recorded in ancient literature and iconography, such as the interpretation of birthmarks, moles and warts and their patterns of distribution on the body.19 Another con-temporary literary source from Anatolia also indicates the mantic potential of the human body. In the fifth book of Aelius Aristides’ Hieroi Logoi, a dead girl is explicitly compared to an animal opened for the purposes of extispicy:But the sum was that all of Philumene’s trouble had been inscribed on her very body and on her insides, as it were on the entrails of sacrificial animals. There also appeared rather a lot of the intestine, and somehow at the same time I saw it. The upper parts were healthy and in good condition, but what was diseased was on the extreme lower end, and it was all exhibited by one who stood by, whoever he was. ...20Returning to the texts of the propitiatory stelai, we find that the punish-ments administered by the deities are often indicated very generally with words like kolazein or nemesein; at other times the illness is mentioned but 17 Later elements of the story that do attribute blame to Stratoneikos; he ‘did not believe’ in the god, and showed ‘contempt for his powers’. Petzl 76 is another case of cutting sacred wood – this time in the grove of Zeus Sabazios and Artemis Anaïtis – in which the dedicant again states that he did not know the trees were the property of the god. Another woman claims she was unaware that she was impure when she entered the sacred area (Petzl 115; cf. Petzl 11 and 34). 18 Oracles and dreams in propitiatory inscriptions: Sima (1999); Chaniotis (1995), 332.

One example of this is the stele of Stratonike.Stratonike the daughter of Mousaios took a loan from Eutychis, one modinos of the holy corn belonging to Axiottenos; however, she delayed paying it until today. After she had been punished by the god in her right breast, she repaid the collected (sum) with all the interest and she praises Axiottenos.22Angelos Chaniotis has studied the diseases attested on the stelai, incor-porating into his analysis both the inscriptions and the visual images of human body parts.23 The body parts that are mentioned or depicted in the stelai analysed by Chaniotis are the eyes (fourteen stelai), breasts (four stelai), legs (four stelai), buttocks (two stelai), arm (one stele) and male genitals (one stele). In addition to these localised physical complaints, three dedicants recount their affliction with mental illnesses. Trophime daughter of Artemidorus, for instance, ‘had been asked by the god to fulfil a service and come quickly, the god punished her and made her insane’.24 Nor is death itself an uncommon punishment – amongst those who died for their sins were a man who failed to give back a neighbour’s pigs, and a woman who had been accused of poisoning her son- in- law.25 In this sense, Stratoneikos the ‘cutter of sacred wood’ was quite lucky: both he and another dedicant Eumenes (who had been caught herding cattle in a sacred grove) were simply put into a ‘death- like state’ from which they were eventually released.26Chaniotis’ study makes a number of keen observations about the types of illnesses attested, as well as their treatment. For instance, he comments on the high proportion of eye disorders mentioned in the propitiatory stelai – a situation which is paralleled at other ancient healing sites such as Athens and Epidauros. Chaniotis’ interpretation of this prevalence of ocular disor-ders is convincing: he suggests that healing sanctuaries naturally attracted patients who were suffering from diseases with no obvious external causes 21 For polla pathontas see TAM V.1.179; for apokatestese see Steinleitner (1913), 59– 60, no. 2.

Moreover, ‘in contrast with other diseases which could be treated by physicians, or at least led to a quick death and thus relieved a person from his sufferings and the relatives from a burdensome care, in the case of blindness only a god could help’.27 Chaniotis also suggests that the primary aim of the expiatory rites recorded in the stelai was to relieve an individual of their transgres-sion, rather than to cure their illness (although, as Justine Potts has rightly noted, the two outcomes must have been inextricably linked in the minds of the dedicants).28 Certainly, the intricate expiatory rituals that we read about in some of the inscriptions often seem at first sight to have ‘nothing to do with healing, neither with practical medicine nor with popular heal-ing methods’, but focus instead on animal sacrifice and food offerings.29 In this way, the approach to illness on the propitiatory stelai is rather different from the earlier Epidaurian iamata discussed in Chapters 2 and 3 of this book, where the intervention of the god often does resemble contemporary, ‘rational’ medical procedures.Viewing the ImagesWhile the texts of the propitiatory stelai have been the focus of intensive study over the last few decades, the visual images carved into the stone have been relatively neglected. One significant exception is Richard Gordon’s work, which has addressed several aspects of the relationship between the stelai’s images and text.30 Gordon focuses primarily on those examples showing images of ‘whole’ gods or dedicants rather than on the stelai rep-resenting parts of the body; all the same, his study represents an important point of departure for the interpretations of the ‘anatomical’ stelai that are offered here. Another new study by Justine Potts (2017) gives some useful background for the propitiatory stelai showing body parts, by placing them alongside other, more conventional anatomical votives from the area and time period.The figurative images that were carved into the propitiatory stelai often represent actors and events mentioned in the written inscriptions, most 27 Chaniotis (1995), 328. 28 Chaniotis (1995), 335; Potts (2017), 35.

For examples of expiation via animal sacrifice and food offerings see Petzl 5 and 6 (both discussed further below). 30 Gordon (2004a) and (2004b).

In the first instance, one example shows the god Apollo Bozenos riding across the frame on a horse; the attribute of the double- axe serves to identify him, but also – as Gordon notes – links him with the idea of violent bodily punishment (Figure 5.3).31 This stele was erected by a woman named Antonia who had entered the sacred precinct wearing a dirty garment. A number of stelai bear a frontal image of the god Men, who dons a Phrygian cap and holds a sceptre.32 Other stelai represent the gods in the form of symbols, such as the double- axe for Apollo, or the crescent moon for Men.Many other stelai depict the mortal whose offence is being propitiated (and who in most cases is also the person responsible for erecting the stele). These figures frequently face out of the stele, raising their right hand in a ritualised gesture which ‘connotes both the act of praising the god and recognition of his or her majesty’ – as well as working to arrest and greet the viewer.33 Occasionally, stelai depict the transgression itself, as is the case with the stele dedicated to Theos Tarsios on behalf of Severus by two mem-bers of his household (threptai – see Figure 5.4).34 Severus had offended the god by obstructing the cutting of branches – perhaps from trees on his land – for the making of sacred crowns. In the image we see a tree in the centre of the relief, flanked by two male figures: Severus is to our right – he raises his hand to stop the figure on the left, who is shown striking the tree’s trunk with an axe. Another stele was dedicated by a woman named Ammias in expiation of some unnamed transgression committed by her young daughter, Dionysias (Figure 5.5).35 Ammias is shown kneeling, while the small Dionysias raises her right hand in the familiar gesture of greeting and adoration. The figures occupy a deep relief ledge, and are placed slightly off- centre. The space to the left of Ammias might be seen as a subtle referent to the divine body – a body that remains invisible to us, although perhaps not to Ammias and her daughter.The examples discussed so far indicate how the propitiatory stelai pop-ulated the sanctuary with an ever- present crowd of gods and worshippers. 31 Berlin Antikensammlung, Sk 680; Petzl 43; Gordon (2004a), 185. 32 Frontal images of Men: Petzl 51, 52 and 61. 33 Gordon (2004a), 185.

Approximately seventeen of the published propitiatory stelai represent single or multiple parts of the human body (Figures 5.7– 5.9 and 5.11 here show some of the best- preserved exam-ples).36 The most commonly depicted parts are legs (9 stelai) and eyes (6), but we also find buttocks (1), breasts (3), an arm and a penis. There is some diversity in how the body parts have been represented: they can appear above or below the text, or embedded in the middle of the inscription. In some examples the body part occupies a sunken niche, while in others it protrudes from the marble surface. The technique used for representing the image also varies: most of the body parts are carved in relief, just like the images of (whole) gods and dedicants, while others are engraved into the surface of the stone in the same manner as the written text. There is a strong correlation between subject and style – every one of the eyes is engraved, while virtually all of the other body parts are represented in relief.37 This special treatment of the eyes presumably arises from the fact that it is rela-tively difficult to carve this body part in relief – engraving on a flat marble surface was perhaps the obvious choice of technique for a sculptor who wanted to differentiate between the pupil, iris and eyelid. At the same time, this special stylistic treatment of the eyes would have meant that they were visually distinctive amongst the other images on the stelai, perhaps high-lighting to viewers the themes of scrutiny and divine omniscience that – as we shall see – lay at the heart of many of the propitiatory inscriptions.The ‘anatomical’ propitiatory stelai bear many similarities with the mar-ble reliefs found at sanctuary sites on the Greek mainland in the Classical and Hellenistic periods, as well as those from other parts of the Roman Empire.38 They also had parallels closer to home, in the sanctuaries of Asia Minor. Some of the earliest anatomical offerings known from the Greco- Roman world come from the Archaic temple of Artemis at Ephesos, which was built towards the end of the eighth century bc (Figure 5.6).

One recently discovered Hellenistic relief from the sanctuary of Apollo Lairbenos or Lermenos – a site with several propitiatory stelai – shows a female breast: the fragmentary inscription translates as ‘Having made a vow, [...] dedicates this to Apollo Lermenos’.41 Another relief from the shrine of Artemis Anaïtis and Men Tiamou is decorated with the image of two legs, and the inscription ‘Meltine raised this sign of gratitude to Artemis Anaïtis and Men Tiamou because of the complete healing of her feet’, while a further relief from the same sanc-tuary, which shows a pair of breasts, proclaims that ‘Alexandra raised this sign of gratitude to Artemis Anaïtis and Men Tiamou because of her b r e a s t s ’.42 Several other examples can be found in the catalogue compiled by Drew- Bear and colleagues of the marble votive reliefs and inscriptions dedicated to Zeus Alsenos and to Zeus Petarenos in a sanctuary near the ancient town of Phyteia in central Phrygia.43 Here, stelai bearing images of body parts – primarily eyes, hands and legs – appear alongside other votive stelai representing divinities and (whole- bodied) dedicants, who are shown both individually and in family groupings.44 Some of these votive 40 On the Demeter sanctuary see Bohtz (1981).

"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"167Viewing the Images167body parts are anepigraphic, but most contain a simple Greek votive for-mula, with the word euchen appearing at the end of most inscriptions. One representative example depicts a pair of eyes over a proportionately much smaller male torso, accompanied by the words Me[ne]non theo euchen (Menenon [dedicated] this to the god).45The nature of the relationship between these simpler euche anatomi-cal votives and the propitiatory stelai with body parts has recently been explored by Justine Potts, who demonstrates that these objects need to be seen as ‘different religious expressions of a common intellectual world’.46 Potts draws attention to the formal and iconographic similarities between these two genres of stelai, noting that they represent the same range of body parts – breasts, legs, eyes, male genitals, and so forth – in very similar ways. She also points out that some of the propitiatory inscriptions ‘self- identify’ as euche vows, and argues that the people who dedicated propitiatory stelai were often the same people who offered the simple vows (this hypothesis is given support by the reappearance of certain names across the two genres of stelai).47 The two types of anatomical image were thus closely related, and Potts suggests that many of the themes attested in the propitiatory stelai – the understanding of illness as a punishment, for example – are poten-tially also applicable to the more conventional anatomical votives which were dedicated in these Lydian- Phrygian sanctuaries. This observation will become important later on in this chapter, when I turn to identifying meta- narrative themes emerging from the propitiatory stelai as a group, insofar as these themes might be seen as equally relevant to the other anatomical votives which were dedicated alongside the propitiatory stelai.Before turning to these meta- narrative elements, however, we can look at the individual examples, to see how the various body parts relate to the personal stories that accompany them. Most previous commentators on the propitiatory stelai have assumed that the body parts represent the illness of the person whose transgression is being propitiated through the dedica-tion.48 And indeed, the texts of several stelai do point explicitly towards this 45 SEG 47.1706. 46 Potts (2017), 33. 47 Potts (2017). 28. Propitiatory stelai using εὐχή: Petzl 122, 66, 42, 84, 90, 91. Potts also reminds us that an earlier palaeographic analysis by Diakonoff (1979) suggests that the same sculptor may have been responsible for both propitiatory and euche inscriptions. Diakonoff (1979), no. 33. Potts (2017), 31. 48 E.g. Chaniotis (1995) automatically counts each body part image into his statistical survey of local illnesses, while Gordon (2004a), 184 says of the stele from Kula which shows two breasts, a right leg and a pair of eyes (Figure 5.11 here) ‘the text of which makes no reference to the physical disorders denoted by images of body parts’; on p. 189 he continues ‘The stele is dedicated, as part of the hieropoiema, a reconcilation with the divinities by ritual means, by two groups of siblings some of whose children must have been so afflicted.’ "},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"168Punishing Bodies: Lydia and Phrygia168Figure 5.7 Marble stele showing a leg and buttock, dedicated by Glykia, daughter of Agrios."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"169Viewing the Images169reading.49 The inscription on a stele dedicated by a man called Diokles, for instance, states: ‘Because I caught the birds belonging to the divinities, I was punished in the eyes, and I inscribed on the stele the miraculous power of the gods.’50 ‘Inscribed’ (graphein) in this context is normally translated as ‘wrote’, but it could equally refer to the inscription of figurative images – indeed, here the image of the punished body part is a striking visual testa-ment to the god’s power over mortals. Another stele dedicated by Glykia on which a leg and buttock is represented has the inscription ‘Glykia, daughter of Agrios, has been punished by Anaïtis from Metro (with a disease) in her buttock; subsequently she sought out the goddess and asked her (what to do) and she dedicated this stone’ (Figure 5.7).51The inscriptions of Diokles and Glykia make it relatively clear that in these cases the body part depicted on the stele belongs to the ailing body of the person whose transgression is being propitiated. By showing the sick body in the form of a fragment, these stelai indicate an element of continuity with the Classical Greek material discussed in Chapter 2, where fragmenta-tion and dismemberment were used in literary texts and visual images alike to represent certain dimensions of the experience of illness. We also find the same connections being made in another source that is much closer to the propitiatory inscriptions in time and space. Again, the text in question is the Hieroi Logoi of Aelius Aristides, where Asklepios appears as ‘Saviour of the Whole’ (soter ton holon).52 In one revealing passage, Aristides con-ceptualises the act of divine healing in the following way:But also limbs of the body, some declare – I mean men and women alike – have been restored to them through the god’s providence after they had been destroyed by nature, and they enumerate, one this, the other that, some of them expressing it by word of mouth, others by their votive offerings. Now for us, he has put together and fastened not part of the body, but the whole frame, and has given it to us as a present, just as of old Prometheus is said to have fashioned man.53At the Asklepieion in second- century ad Pergamon, the healing of ‘limb-less’ suppliants literally involved making the body whole – in fact, the description here suggests the miraculous regrowth of missing arms and legs. Aristides’ own body, on the other hand, was never literally in pieces, but he nevertheless still conceives of his cure as a ‘fastening together’ of his 49 Anatomical stelai specifying that the illness has been sent as punishment: Petzl 5; Petzl 16; Petzl 50. 50 Petzl 50; TAM V.1.264; Buckler (1914– 16). 51 Petzl 75; SEG 29.1174; Chaniotis (1995), 328– 9, table 1.22.

As man was originally moulded from clay by Prometheus, so through the agency of Asklepios has Aristides been ‘re- made’. Crucially, this passage represents the bodies of the dedicants as ill and broken, and the process of health as a process of reintegration. And by showing the ailing body in pieces, the propitiatory stelai implicitly make the same connections between illness and fragmentation, and between health and wholeness.However, while some of propitiatory stelai do seem to represent the sick body, a close reading of the inscriptions indicates that this may not always be the case. One third- century limestone stele was dedicated by Aurelius Soterichos from the city of Motella.54 At the bottom of the stele, etched into the surface of the marble, we see a representation of a pair of legs portrayed as if walking to the viewer’s right, and – to the right of these legs – a pro-portionally much larger penis and testicles. The inscription translates as follows:I, Aurelius Soter(i)chos from Motella, son of Demostratos, was punished by the god. I proclaim to all that no one may enter the (holy) area in an impure state, com-mit perjury or have sexual intercourse/ masturbate. I had sexual intercourse with Gaia inside the (holy) area.55Aurelius mentions three transgressions in this inscription: entering the holy boundary of the sanctuary in an unholy state (anagon anabet’ epi to chorion); perjury (epiorkesi – a common transgression in the propitiatory inscriptions, which may refer to the breaking of an oath) and the perfor-mance of impure acts.56 While these confessions are expressed ‘indirectly’ in the form of general rules, the final line turns the attention back onto Aurelius with his first- person statement ‘I had sex with Gaia in the sanc-tuary’. As the original editors of this inscription have suggested, then, the body parts represented on the stele seem to correspond to parts of the written narrative: that is, the legs could refer to the trespassing into the holy area, while the penis might refer to the sexual act.57 Of course, the same body part could be both the agent of the transgression and the loca-tion of the illness sent in punishment, and in this respect it is worth noting that the targeted punishment of an offending body part is attested in other ancient sources. One version of the myth of Teiresias, for example, tells 54 Petzl 110; SEG 6.251. Cf. Hogarth (1887), 387, n. 16. 55 Translation based on that of Rostad (2006a), 297. 56 On purity rules and sexual abstinence see Parker (1983), 74– 5. 57 Comments at MAMA 4.283; see also Miller (1985), 62.

Raffaele Pettazzoni has offered a similar interpretation of another fragmentary propitiatory stele which shows a bent arm in a recessed panel above the text (Figure 5.8).59 Here, the transgression recorded in the text is the breaking of a small stele belonging to the goddess. The dedicant Metrodoros, Pettazzoni suggests, was punished in the arm, because this was the body part that had been used break the stele.These last two examples already problematise the assumption that the anatomical stelai always represent the ailing part of the dedicant’s body. In other cases, it seems that the body part is capable of supporting mul-tiple meanings. One stele from the territory of Silandos was dedicated by a hierodoulos named Theodoros (Figure 5.9).60 On this upper portion of 58 Apollodorus 3.6– 7. 59 Petzl 78 (= TAM V.1.596); Pettazzoni (1936), 69. 60 Petzl 5 (= SEG 38.1237); Chaniotis (1995), 332– 3; Ricl (1995); Rostad (2006a), 284– 5; Varinlioğlu (1989), 48– 9; Chaniotis (2004), 27– 8 (with further bibliography).Figure 5.8 Fragmentary white marble stele showing an arm, from Sandal (Maeonia), set up by Metrodoros, ad 118– 19.

The text translates as follows:In the year 320, on the 12th of the month Panemos. In accordance with the fact that I was instructed by the gods, by Zeus and the great Men Artemidoros: ‘I have punished Theodoros on his eyes according to the transgressions he committed’. I had intercourse with Trophime, the slave of Haplokomas, wife of Eutykhes, in the praetorium. He removed the first transgression with a sheep, a partridge and a mole. The second transgression: Even though I was a slave of the gods in Nonu, I had intercourse with Ariagne, who was unmarried. He removed the transgression with a piglet and a tuna. At the third transgression I had intercourse with Arethusa, who was unmarried. He removed the transgression with a hen (or cock), a sparrow and a pigeon; with a kypros of a blend of wheat and barley and one prokhos of wine. Being pure he gave a kypros of wheat to the priests and one prokhos. As intercessor, I took Zeus. (He said): Behold! I hurt his sight because of his deeds, but now he has reconciled the gods and written down (the events) on a stele and paid for his trans-gressions. Asked by the council (the god proclaimed): I will be merciful, because my stele is raised on the day I appointed. You can open the prison; I will release the convict when one year and ten months has passed.61This is one of the longest and most unusual of the confession narratives, and its confusing sequence of events and mysterious allusions to councils and prisons have already been the focus of much discussion.62 For our purposes it is enough to note that Theodoros’ transgressions were intercourse with three different women (he was a sacred slave, and therefore perhaps subject to rules of sexual abstinence), one of whom was married; that his punish-ment was directed ‘on his eyes’; and that the story ended relatively well after he propitiated his transgression by offering sacrifices to the gods and raising the stele. In this context, the identification of the engraved pair of eyes as belonging to Theodoros seems fairly secure. However, even though Theodoros’ eyes are mentioned in the inscription, certain aspects of the stele’s design introduce ambiguity.First of all, the stele comprises two actors, both of whom speak in the first person. One is the dedicant, Theodoros, who begins by stating that he has been ‘instructed’ by the gods (presumably to erect the stele). Immediately afterwards – and with no break in the syntax – we hear another voice, which is not introduced, but which we can deduce is that of one of the gods, baldly stating that he has punished Theodoros ‘on his eyes’ for the transgressions he has committed. The presence of a second 61 Translation from Rostad (2006a), 285. 62 See e.g. the commentaries at Petzl (1994), 155– 66, and Varinlioğlu (1989), 37– 40. "},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"174Punishing Bodies: Lydia and Phrygia174speaker on the stele, then, already potentially raises a question mark over whose body is being represented, and this ambiguity only increases when we look at the visual arrangement of image and text on the stele. The eyes are juxtaposed with the crescent – a familiar divine symbol – and they are placed directly over the first word of the inscription: theon (‘of the gods’). At the moment the text begins, then, the image of the eyes is connected to the gods rather than Theodoros, who does not appear until the sixth line of the inscription.63 The engraved style of the eyes may have strengthened the connection to the divine sphere, since on all ‘non- anatomical’ stelai engraving is reserved for divine motifs such as crescent moons, rosettes and hammers.64 Then as the viewer read on further and discovered that Theodoros’ punishment affected his eyes, he or she may have revised the original interpretation of the engraved eyes as belonging to a god: now, in retrospect, the juxtaposition of the eyes with the word theōn could instead serve to underline the direct agency of the gods in Theodoros’ mortal suffering.This reading of Theodoros’ stele suggests that the meaning of single body parts might shift as the viewers read through the accompanying textual nar-ratives. In this case, the image of the eyes oscillated between a divine and mortal ontological status, with this small physical area of the stele thereby becoming a particularly charged zone of encounter and communication between the deities and their mortal worshippers. The association of the eyes with the divine is particularly appropriate in Theodoros’ case, since it underwrites the theme of divine omniscience that underpins his narrative as a whole. In other words, while Theodoros presumably did not have sex with Trophime, Ariagne and Arethusa in full view of the community, his transgressions were nonetheless noticed and punished by Zeus and Men. This point can be extended to incorporate the other propitiatory stelai with eyes, which might also be seen to embody the theme of divine omniscience. Any visitor to the sanctuaries where these stelai were displayed might catch themselves being observed by pairs of unblinking stone eyes as they moved 63 On the divine body and the question of ‘how difficult Greeks found it to imagine a role for a god who did not relate to humankind by being in human form’ see Osborne (2011), 185– 215. Other instances of divine body parts represented in sanctuaries are discussed at Petridou (2009) (divine feet and footprints), and Bruneau (1979) (on ears with the epithet epekoos – ‘who hears prayers’, here from ancient Delos; for more examples of divine ears see van Straten (1981), 83 and Petsalis- Diomidis (2016). 64 See for instance Petzl 18, where the figure of a women, carved in relief, is shown reclining on a couch under an engraved crescent moon, and Petzl 57, where a woman carved in relief stands in a niche, with an engraved crescent and double- axe above her.

This next section will identify another way in which the anatomical representations (here not only the eyes, but all the other body parts too) might be seen as dramatising two other closely related beliefs attested in the stelai’s written texts: the ‘perme-ability’ of the individual body, and the tight interconnections that existed between individuals and their wider social and familial groups. Both these themes are central to one group of inscriptions which emphasise the inher-ited nature of guilt and punishment. The stele of Apollonios provides one good example (Figure 5.10). It shows three frontal figures – two adult men, and between them a young girl – each with their right hand raised, who are annotated with the following story.Great (are) Meis Labanos and Meis Patraeites. Whereas Apollonios, resident in the God’s house, seeing that he had been given a command by the God – when he dis-obeyed, (the God) caused his son Ioulios and his grand- daughter Markia to die and he has made known the manifestations of the gods’ powers by erecting a stele – and from henceforth I offer my praises to you.65Apollonios (who is probably the older, bearded figure represented on the left of the stele) may have been one of the custodians or ‘residents’ who took it in turns to guard the local temple. We are told that he disobeyed the god’s command, although the exact nature of his transgression is left unspecified. The word eulogo (‘I praise’) occupies a visually prominent place in a line of its own, right at the bottom of the inscription. However, this emphasis on Apollonios’ agency in propitiating his transgression belies the much wider implications of his action.

Another stele dedicated to Zeus Peizenos records the case of Diogenes, who ‘had made a vow for the ox, but he did not fulfill it; for that reason his daughter Tatiane was punished in her eyes. But now they propitiated and made the dedication’.68 Yet another long inscription on a stele raised in ad 156– 7 tells of a woman, Tatias, who had been accused of witchcraft against her son- in- law: she ‘raised a sceptre’ in the temple as a means of clearing her name, after which – because she was in fact guilty – not only did she die, but her own son too was mortally wounded when an axe used for cutting vines fell from his hand and struck him on his foot, while he was passing in front of the sacred wood – an accident that plainly demonstrated the god’s agency in bringing the death about.69These examples and several others besides show that the transgressions of individuals often had serious consequences for members of their fam-ily and those around them. That the effects were not necessarily limited to human family members is shown by the story of Hermogenes who, after he had sworn a false oath, suffered the death of his own bull and donkey, before his daughter was also eventually taken from him.70 Other inscrip-tions make the same point in a slightly different way, by acknowledging that the act of propitiation spared the family from misfortune that might other-wise have struck them had the transgression not been propitiated.

A stele from Meonia states that it was set up in ad 162– 3 by ‘Apollonios son of Menodoros on behalf of his brother Dionysios. When he was ritually purified, and did not observe the goddess’ appointed time, she killed him.’72 Another stele from the temple of Anaïtis and Men near Kula records a quarrel about the theft of livestock between two families.73 Two brothers, Hermogenes and Apollonios, refused to give back another fami-ly’s animals after they had escaped and got in with their own animals; when the other family ‘raised a sceptre’, Hermogenes died. We then hear that his brother Apollonios, together with ‘Aphias and her children’ made a confes-sion and raised a stele, an act which Richard Gordon suggests can be linked to their desire to distance themselves from Hermogenes, thereby ‘restoring the moral order’, and re- entering the village community from which they had temporarily been isolated.Each of the stories mentioned here demonstrates an understanding of human transgression and divine punishment as things that could be trans-mitted between members of the kinship group, and even spread to animals. This same belief had been conceptualised in earlier Greek myth and reli-gion as miasma, with myths such as those of Atreus and Oedipus providing powerful mythological examples of how the repercussions of a wrongdoing could ripple over many generations without weakening.74 The major role that kinship links play in the transmission of wrongdoings and punish-ments can help us understand why many of the transgressive parties are shown making reparations to the gods in the presence of their families. For instance, if we return to the relief of Ammias and her daughter Dionysias (Figure 5.5), we might now suspect that the mother’s presence on the stele is partly motivated by the potentially contaminating nature of the child’s wrongdoing. Perhaps Ammias had already been struck by an inherited punishment, or perhaps she was hoping to ward off any future reprisals? Other stelai also represent family members together, often using body lan-guage and clothing to materialise these ancestral links. Looking again at 72 Hermogenes: Petzl 34.

On one level, the fragmented body parts do this by showing the individual not as a bounded, self- governed sys-tem, but rather as a fluid, permeable entity which could merge and combine with other bodies in space.76 Figure 5.11 shows a relief which stood in the sanctuary of Anaïtis and Men Tiamou near Kula. It depicts two breasts, a leg and a pair of eyes engraved on the right; the inscription explains that the stele had been dedicated by several people who were propitating the gods on behalf of their children and livestock.77 It is very likely that the body parts depicted on the stele indicated the location of punishment and illness, although even literate viewers would have found it impossible to know precisely whose body or bodies were represented (six dedicants are named in the inscription, in addition to an unspecified number of children and animals). Instead, the stele presents a generalised image of the body in pieces, which not only reorganises the body into a horizontal jigsaw (breast- breast- leg- eye- eye), but also disa-vows the physical boundaries between the individuals named in the inscrip-tion. In this sense, as well as depicting the sick body, this relief also potentially embodies anxieties about the normal body – that is, the body which is not yet sick, but which is constantly open to moral and physical ‘infection’.Another, slightly different perspective is suggested by a text that was written in nearby Ephesos during the first century ad, which also draws heavily on the imagery of the body in pieces:For the body is not one member, but many. If the foot says, ‘Because I am not a hand, I am not part of the body’, it is not for this reason any the less a part of the body. And if the ear says, ‘Because I am not an eye, I am not a part of the body’, it 75 Cf. also Petzl 12 (SEG 33.1012) from ad 253/ 4 (stele of Klaudia Bassa, dedicated to Zeus of the Twin Oaks ‘having been tormented for four years and not believing in the god’). 76 We might suspect that such beliefs would find confirmation in cases where illnesses were observed to affect members of the same household: for although we would now rationalise such events in terms of bacteria and ‘catching’ viruses, the narratives on the propitiatory stelai suggest that ancient communities might see the spread of illness as the physical manifestation of an inherited transgression, which contaminated individuals via ancestral, family links. For a discussion of the anthropological concepts of personhood, partibility and permeability in relation to anatomical votives (in this case from Hellenistic/ Republican Italy), see Graham (2017). 77 TAM V.1.322 ‘To the Goddess Anaetis and Men Tiamou: Tyche and Socrates and Ammianos and Trophimos, the sons of Ammios, and Philete and Socratia, the daughters of Ammias, having made a sacrifice to propitiate Mater Anaetis for the sake of their children and nurslings, inscribed and set up (this stele).’ Translation from Kloppenborg and Ascough (2011), 269.

If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be? But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just as He desired. If they were all one member, where would the body be? But now there are many members, but one body. And the eye cannot say to the hand, ‘I have no need of you’, or again the head to the feet, ‘I have no need of you’ ... And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honoured, all the members rejoice with it.78This well- known passage from St Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians consitutes one of the most extensive surviving applications of a much older literary topos – that of the ‘body politic’.79 One much earlier ver-sion of this topos was encountered in Chapter 2 of this book, where we saw Plato using the image of the sick body to talk about the corruption of whole community. By the time that Paul was writing, this loose analogy had developed into an elaborate metaphor of the ecclesiastical commu-nity of Christ. Although Paul’s letter emerges from a different religious background to the propitiatory stelai, his words nevertheless resonate with those inscribed votive texts, echoing their latent message about the impor-tance of interpersonal bonds and community. Particularly relevant here is his claim that ‘if one member suffers, all the others suffer with it’ – a claim which echoes the stelai’s own implicit warnings about the impact of indi-vidual transgression upon the rest of the culprit’s family. Paul’s depiction of the individual body parts as autonomous entities with their own voices and opinions also evokes the depiction on some stelai of the ‘transgressive’ body parts, which are alienated from the rest of the body and personified as independent agents of wrong. 78 St Paul, 1 Corinthians 12:12– 26. 79 Plato Republic 8.556e; see supra, Chapter 2 n. 91. In intervening periods the analogy was utilised and developed by several different authors, from Xenophon and Aristotle to Livy and Cicero. In Xenophon’s Memorabilia, Socrates urges reconciliation between quarrelling brothers by citing the harmony of pairs of hands, feet, and eyes, while Aristotle demonstrated the individual’s dependence on the state by saying ‘if the whole body be destroyed, there will be no foot or hand’. Xenophon Memorabilia 2.3 (on which see Brock 2004); Aristotle Politics 1253a. The Roman historian Livy made use of the analogy in the second book of his Histories, where Menenius Agrippa ends a plebeian secession by explaining that the belly (which in this case symbolised the Senate) provides nourishment for the hands and feet (the People). Livy Histories 2.32 (note that here there is a functional relation between the person/ group and the particular body part chosen to represent it). Meanwhile, Cicero wrote that if each part of the body tries to appropriate the health of the others, then the body will die, commenting that such behaviour in men would be equally destructive. Cicero De officiis 3.22. A further example comes from Seneca’s dialogue De ira: just as it is unnatural for the hands to destroy the feet, so the need for harmony, love, and mutual protection causes mankind to protect individuals. Seneca De ira 2.31. "},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"183Imagined Communities183This passage from the letter to the Corinthians thus leads us towards another interpretation of the body parts on the stelai as pars pro toto representations of their dedicants – images which effectively ‘condensed’ the whole person into a single part of their anatomy. In fact, this meto-nymic reading is implicit in every one of the votive offerings we have met in this book, and coexists in productive friction with the symbolism of fragmentation and dismemberment (again reflecting the ‘dual ontologi-cal status’ of the body part, discussed above in relation to Pompey’s por-trait head at Figure 1.5). The pars pro toto interpretation fits particularly well with the material discussed in this chapter, however, partly because of the heavy emphasis placed on the interconnectedness of individuals in the written texts of the propitiatory inscriptions, and partly because the body politic metaphor had particularly wide currency in this period (appearing, for instance, in Paul’s letters to the Colossians, Ephesians and Romans, as well as the Corinthians passage discussed here).80 In other words, although the interpretation of the anatomical propitiatory stelai as a material manifestation of the body politic metaphor requires some logical acrobatics on our part, it may have occurred far more readily to the stelai’s original viewers, for whom this use of the body was a stand-ard literary topos. Even more importantly, another literary text seems to confirm that the pars pro toto reading did occur to people dedicating votives in Asia Minor during this period. Again, the text in question is the Hieroi Logoi, and more specifically the passage in which Asklepios visits Aristides in a dream, first informing him that he is to die within three days, before revealing some ritual measures that Aristides might take to avoid this fate.The god said that it was necessary to cut off part of the body itself on behalf of the safety of the whole. This however would be too great a demand and from it he would exempt me. Instead, I should take off the ring that I was wearing and offer it to Telesphoros. For this would do the same as if I offered the finger itself. Furthermore, I should inscribe on the band of the ring ‘Son of Cronos’. After this there would be salvation.81This passage has already been picked up on by earlier commentators on the anatomical votives: it was highlighted in the oldest monograph by J. J. Frey; Pazzini then incorporated the passage into his argument about sacrificial substitution, while Walter Burkert similarly used it to suggest 80 See Colossians 1:18, 1:24; 2:18– 20; Ephesians 1:22– 23; 4:13; and Romans 12: 4– 5. On Paul’s adaptation of the metaphor see Hicks (1963). 81 Aelius Aristides Hieroi Logoi, 48.26– 8. "},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"184Punishing Bodies: Lydia and Phrygia184that votive offerings represent ‘a kind of ransom from the threat of death’.82 In the present context, the most important thing about this passage is that it demonstrates Aristides’ understanding that his ring, which was a substitute for his finger, was to be accepted by the deity ‘on behalf of [the safety of ] the whole’: that is, as a pars pro toto offering.83 Aristides’ text thus indicates that the pars pro toto interpretation was a plausible one for dedicants in Asia Minor in the second century ad, and, as such, might have been applied to the isolated body part images on the propitiatory stelai (not to mention the simpler euche reliefs with body parts that were encountered in the same sanctuaries).This interpretation of the anatomical images as pars pro toto images which collectively materialised a sort of ‘body politic’ attributes the pro-pitiatory stelai with a powerful ideological function. In many respects, this reading dovetails neatly with Benedict Anderson’s theories about ‘imagined communities’ in much later historical periods, insofar as the anatomical representations position the individual within a larger social group that is known but never actually seen in its entirety – a naturalised community in which real distinctions of gender, age and class are elided to produce the sense of a ‘deep, horizontal comradeship’.84 Here, the precise identity of this community was usefully ambiguous: it could refer to the family (the group with the strongest identity in the written inscriptions), or alternatively it could mean the wider village community (in this respect, it is worth not-ing that some propitiatory inscriptions do show a concern with ‘smooth-ing over’ relations between villagers).85 For literate viewers, or viewers who heard these inscriptions read aloud, the themes of interconnectedness and mutual dependence would already have been suggested by the texts of the propitiatory stelai, which repeated narratives about inherited sin and trans-gression, as well as demonstrating an evident concern for the health and harmony of the wider village community. But for all viewers – including those who could not read the inscriptions – the imagery of the body parts 82 Frey (1746), 4, section III; Pazzini (1935), 118; Burkert (1996), 35– 8. Burkert draws parallels between this passage and an episode recorded in medieval versions of Homer’s Odyssey in which Odysseus is forced to bite off his own finger to rid himself of a deadly finger- ring given to him by the Cyclops Polyphemus: he says ‘by the loss of a member I saved the whole body from imminent death’. See also the discussions in Versnel (1977) and (1981). 83 Cf. Rynearson (2003), 8: ‘Here the logic of substitution of the votive for a part of the living body is explicit. The possibility of the literal fragmentation of the body is raised in order to be displaced onto the votive and thereby negated. Aristides’ ring thus conflates the salvation of the whole body with the sparing of the individual part from amputation; his body remains whole because the part is spared through substitution.’ 84 Anderson (2006 [1983]), 7. 85 E.g. the tale of Hermogenes and Apollonios; Petzl 68 (see n. 73 here). "},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"185Conclusion185would have provided a dynamic visual illustration of these themes, adver-tising the tight- knit links between the individual and the group to which they belonged. In this way, as well as allowing dedicants to communicate with the gods about the welfare of sick body parts, the propitiatory stelai also implicitly warned their mortal viewers about the need to act respon-sibly and to police the actions of others, as strategies for maximising the health and well- being of all parties.ConclusionThis final case- study has given us an unprecedented opportunity to explore the meanings of dedicated body parts in antiquity, thanks to the lengthy inscriptions that appear alongside the anatomical images on the propitia-tory stelai. This chapter has investigated the relationship between image and text on these stelai, with the aim of elucidating the role in which body parts play in individual narratives, as well as suggesting some ways that this anatomical imagery might connect to broader themes that resonate across the whole group of propitiatory stelai. It is clear that most of the stelai with body parts were dedicated by people suffering in that particular part of the body, which may also have been the part responsible for the transgres-sion that had attracted the illness as punishment. At the same time, the body parts on the stelai can be seen collectively to dramatise deeper and more general beliefs about the human body, and the nature of sickness and health. Significantly, despite frequent claims that the propitiatory stelai are exotic and fundamentally ‘unclassical’ objects, many features identified in this chapter resonate with arguments made in earlier parts of this book, in relation to better- known anatomical votives.86 The simple identification of the votive body part as a representation of the sick body part, the direct equating of the sick and ‘unfastened’ body, the conceptualisation of illness as divine punishment, and the potential overlaps between anatomical imagery and the literary metaphor of the body politic – these are all themes which have emerged from looking at earlier anatomical votives, and which find some element of confirmation in the rich narratives that accompany the Lydian- Phrygian body parts.As well as adding another strand to our exploration of continuity and change in the anatomical votive tradition, this chapter has also aimed to contribute to the study of the Lydian- Phrygian propitiatory stelai, by 86 On the perceived strangeness of the propitiatory stelai see Potts (2017), 3 n. 12.

Hopefully, the discussion here has demonstrated that the images on the stelai are at least as interesting as the inscribed texts that accompany them, despite the fact that the texts have been the focus of nearly all the existing scholarly investigations of this material. We do not know how many people could read the lengthy Greek inscriptions on the stelai, but we can be certain that the image of the una-dorned, naked body part was something that would have been recognisable and meaningful to every single one of its viewers. In Lydia and Phrygia, as in other parts of the ancient world, the immediacy and familiarity of the body part image made it accessible to all those who contemplated it, enhancing its efficacy as a medium for delivering more opaque and com-plex messages. Ultimately, it is this dual nature of the votive body part – its unmediated simplicity and its rich multivalency – which have made it so powerful and popular an image throughout history, and which constitute its richness as a document for understanding the human past."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"187187This book has compared votive models of body parts from four different cultural contexts within classical antiquity, with the aim of investigating continuity and change in the anatomical votive tradition. It has explored reasons for the inception and development of this ritual in different parts of the Greco- Roman world, and has argued that looking at these dedica-tions in a comparative framework can help us to reconstruct how ancient people experienced their bodies and the bodies of others around them. The emphasis here has been on highlighting differences between the four case- studies, and in particular the shifting range of body parts represented in the various contexts. In turn, I have considered how the anatomical votives in each of these four cultures fit alongside other non- votive images of the body produced in the same areas, so as to better understand what these objects meant to their original users and viewers. This book thus offers a counter-point to the usual commentary on the anatomical votives, in which these objects are seen as evidence for an unbroken continuity in beliefs about how to represent and treat the human body; it also highlights the agency of users and their power to transform the tradition they ‘inherited’.Each of the case- studies examined in this book thus forms a sin-gle frame in a moving picture of the anatomical ritual in antiquity. But although the emphasis has been on contrast and difference, I have also argued that all votive body parts share one important feature – that is, the capacity to symbolise the fragmentation or disaggregation of the human body. This has allowed us to move beyond the observation that anatomical votives pinpoint parts of the human body that were suffering (or salient for another reason), to recognise that the striking visual image of a trun-cated body part also had other meanings, which drew on contemporary discourses and contexts for the divided body. For instance, the Classical Greek votives resonated with contemporary medical discourses which conceptualised illness as fragmentation and health as reintegration, while the similarities between the votives and older images of divine punishment served to infuse illness with a moral component. In turn, I argued that the Etrusco- Italic votives were best understood in relation to the ‘undo-ing’ of the body in local traditions of sacrifice and haruspicy, while the Afterword: Revisiting Fragmentation "},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"188Afterword: Revisiting Fragmentation188Romano- Gallic material echoed older practices in which the (real) human body was dismantled and displayed in situations of conflict. Finally, the last chapter showed how the propitiatory stelai from Asia Minor not only evoked the fragmentation of the body in illness and divine punishment for mortal transgression, but also suggested the reassembly of these fragments into a hybrid body politic.As well as suggesting new interpretations of these objects, acknowledging the fragmentary nature of the anatomical votives can also help to challenge and nuance some of our conventional ideas about classical art in general, insofar as we normally perceive fragmentation as something ‘accidental’ that happens to an ancient artefact in later stages of its biography. In most of these latter cases, the incompleteness of the object functions as a ‘metaphor of modernity’ (to cite Linda Nochlin), which both symbolises and con-structs our sense of distance from the partially lost world of antiquity.1 The iconic, mutilated body of the Venus de Milo ‘works’ as an image because we know she was originally whole; her missing arm thus (im)materialises the long stretch of time that separates us from the moment of her manu-facture (Figure 6.1).2 The anatomical votives studied in this book threaten this particular construction of historical time and distance, by showing that fragmentation was never a unique preserve of modernity, but was instead central to the way in which ancient people themselves perceived and rep-resented their bodies. In turn, I would argue that the votive body parts can also alter our perspective on those full- bodied images of elite males that are normally hailed as representative of the Classical period (Figure 2.9). Naturalistic statues like the Doryphoros may have emerged from a climate of democracy, but representative images of ancient society they were not; in this respect, the anatomical votive assemblage, with its mixture of bodies of different genders, ages, social backgrounds, and even species, is a far better qualified standard- bearer for a history of ‘The’ Classical body.Finally, talking about the votives in terms of fragmentation also indi-cates how the Greco- Roman body might relate to the bodies of later his-torical periods in which corporeal fragmentation has long been recognised to play a central role. When we look at Christian discourses of healing in the Middle Ages, for instance, we find many interesting points of overlap with the Greco- Roman material examined in this book. During this later period, too, the broken body served as a site of healing, not only in the form 1 Nochlin (1994). 2 On the Venus and fragmentation see Fuller (1980), 71– 129; Squire (2011), 83– 4.

One story recorded by the sixth- century ad bishop Gregory of Tours tells of a crystal chalice that was first broken by a clumsy church deacon and then miraculously mended over-night – a clear Christian reworking of the story of the ‘Epidaurian goblet’ discussed in Chapter 2 above.4 Meanwhile, other sources indicate that the Figure 6.2 Feet of Aurelia del Prete on display in the sanctuary of the Madonna dell’Arco, S.

In the church there is a crystal chalice of marvellous beauty. But once after the celebration of mass, as a deacon carried the chalice to the holy altar, it slipped from his hand, fell to the ground, and was smashed into small pieces. The deacon, pale and white, carefully gathered the fragments of the chalice and placed then on top of the altar; he did not doubt that the power of the martyr would be able to make it whole. After he had spent the night in vigils, weeping and praying, he went to look at the chalice and found it formed and whole (solidatum) on the altar.’ Translation: de Nie (2002), 265.

For a potent example of this we might travel full circle back to the site where this book began – the sanctuary of the Madonna dell’Arco at Sant’Anastasia near Naples. In a room leading off a long corridor lined with anatomical votive offerings, the visitor is con-fronted by an iron cage containing a pair of desiccated human feet that once belonged to a local woman named Aurelia del Prete (Figure 6.2). On Easter Monday in 1589, Aurelia had been on her way to the sanctuary to dedicate a wax ex- voto in thanks for the successful cure of her husband’s eye disease, but for some reason she had flown into a temper and thrown the votive offering onto the ground, blaspheming against the painted image of the Madonna.5 Precisely a year later, her feet spontaneously fell from her body as penalty for her sin; this foundation narrative of the sanctuary confirmed the potency of religious images and the willingness of the Madonna to harm as well as heal. Today, the uncanny juxtaposition of the rotten feet and the sparkling silver ex- votos continues to dramatise this dual potency of the divine, confirming the continued centrality of the fragmented body in dis-courses of healing and well-being. The offerings at the Madonna dell’Arco might be firmly embedded in their Catholic context, but they nevertheless retain echoes of a divine vengeance that is resolutely Classical, and, as such, provide a silent testimony of the slow and incremental nature of change in beliefs about the human body. 5 Toschi and Penna (1971), 42– 3; Giardino and Cristofaro (1996), 16.
