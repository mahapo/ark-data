The topic of my doctoral thesis was decided during a fateful conversation with my graduate mentor in Baltimore. As a result of that meeting, in the late eighties I relocated to Athens to begin work on a corpus of Greek sacred poetry preserved in inscriptions. The memory of my first year abroad is a blurry succession of images which fade into the chaotic background of 1987 Athens. Like Henry Miller, eventually I found peace at Epidaurus. Between visits to the Argolis, the American School of Classical Studies gave me room, board, and a refuge where to collect the pieces of my personal and professional life. As work at Epidaurus progressed, colleagues and friends at the School contin-ued to provide me, on occasion, with material for the forgotten corpus of Greek religious poetry. One morning, an index card with the SEG reference to a ‘hymn’ for the Nymphs from Pharsalus appeared, unsigned, on my carrel in the Blegen Library. I put it away in a file where I kept other similar notes, vaguely wondering what it would be like to work in a cave.The chance to satisfy this curiosity presented itself years later, after I joined the faculty of the University of Florida in Gainesville. Opportunity appeared in the form of an MA student who, as I had done during my gradu-ate years, was looking for a thesis topic and an excuse to flee east. Having decided on a project entitled The Cave of Pantalkes at Pharsala, Brian T. Moore followed me to Thessaly in July 1993 for a three-day survey of the Karapla site and its surroundings. His work, completed the fol-lowing Spring, was the first study of the cave to appear in over half a century. Despite some initial plans to develop the thesis for publication, Brian opted in the end for Law School and a professional career. The fieldwork we car-ried out together that Summer of 1993 thus became the nucleus of this book, not to be completed until much later.I began working again on the Karapla cave in 2005, partly to fulfill a project that continued to intrigue me, partly to seek occasional relief while serving a term as department head. Throughout the five years that I spent in this position I tried to go back to Thessaly as many times as possible without testing the tolerance of my colleagues and family. Work proceeded in fits and starts, but the stark beauty of the Thessalian mountainland and the friendliness of its people provided the cement that my discontinuous research calendar was lacking. At home my daughter grew along with my fieldbooks, relishing in tales of caves, bats, and giant horseflies that attack little girls. An expert at decoding my non-native English, my wife bravely proofread the first draft of this manuscript as it slowly took shape.Despite the small size of the resulting monograph, researching the Karapla cave was a long and complex project that could not have been accomplished without the assistance of many people. I aknowledge them here in no particular order. In Greece: Professor Ioannis Barmpoutis and the Faculty of Forestry and Natural Environment of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Dr. Panagiotis (Takis) Karkanas of the Ephorate of Palaeoanthropology and Speleology of S. Greece in Athens; Dr. Stella Katakouta of the 15th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities in Larissa; Vassiliki (Vasso) Rontiri and Charalambos (Bampis) Intzesinoglou of the 13th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities in Volos; the current Mayor of Pharsala, Mr. Aris Karahalios, and the special archaeologi-cal consultant to the Mayor’s Office, Dr. Vassiliki (Vasso) Noula-Karpeti; Mr. Ilias Dinos of the Aigli Hotel in Pharsala, to whom I am indebted for far more than hospitality; the Director, Professor Emanuele Greco, and the staff of the Italian Archaeological School in Athens; the Directors, Professor Stephen Tracy (2002–2007) and Professor Jack Davis (2007–2012), and the colleagues and friends at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, especially William and Evren Bruce; the Directors, Professor James Whitley (2002–2007) and Professor Catherine Morgan (2007–2014), the Assistant Director, Mr. Robert Pitt (2007–2014), and the staff of the British School in Athens; the staffs of the Hellenic Military Geographical Service and the Institute for Geology and Mineral Exploration (IGME). In France Professor Bruno Helly, Drs. Laurent Darmezin, and Richard Bouchon were a congenial and helpful audi-ence at a seminar on the Karapla cave I held at the Maison de l’Orient et de la Méditerranée; Professor Jean-Claude Decourt also extended friendship and support for my research per epistulas. From the Netherlands Marco Rasi provided timely assistance with a terracotta figurine in Amsterdam.Funding for the project was supplied by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the Center for Greek"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"AcknowledgementsxiiStudies of the University of Florida. I am grateful to both for their continued financial assistance through the years. I am also grateful to the Neikirk family for endowing the Term Professorship which I held during the final stages of the work.Of the many readers whose suggestions were critical in making this a better book, Jennifer Larson is the one to whom I owe the greatest debt—not least for present-ing me with a much treasured copy of her monumental study on the Nymphs. It now features prominently on my shelves, in place of the mangled university copy which I shamelessly returned to the library after many years of abuse.I am also grateful to Brill’s anonymous reader for help-ful advice and especially to Professors Adele Scafuro and John Bodel for welcoming my study in their series. Professor John M. Fossey, Editor-in-Chief of Monumenta Graeca et Romana, offered friendly support at an early stage of the project. Jennifer Pavelko, Tessel Jonquière, Tessa Schild, Gera van Bedaf, and the other editorial staff at Brill provided steady and patient assistance throughout the publication process.Just as the book was reaching its final shape, the dear mentor whom I mention earlier in this preface passed away after a brief illness. It is my hope that in the follow-ing pages readers will be able to catch a glimpse, however small, of Diskin Clay’s human and intellectual legacy.Finally, a very special thanks goes to my fellow trav-eler and field assistant Andrew G. Nichols. A historian and scholar of Ctesias of Cnidus, for the last seven years Nichols was always ready to trade FGrH for the topog-rapher’s boots and accompany me in many seemingly endless ramblings on the goat trails of the northwest Othrys. My apologies to him if in return for his help he has collected more bruises than salary.The author quoted at the beginning of this preface writes of travel literature that it “must satisfy not only the reader’s hunger for narrative fact or fiction, but a more general human hunger for narrative in our lives”. Although based on many transatlantic crossings, the present study is not about travel, and most of the personal experiences which occurred in the course of its making must be omit-ted for the sake of scientific exposition. But even if I do not aknowledge them in the book, I am deeply indebted to all the unnamed friends from Greece, America, and other countries who wrote, with me, the narrative behind it.Gainesville, Spring 2015"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Abbreviations and Other Prefatory Matters AbbreviationsAbbreviations of ancient authors and their works are those found in H.G.

TransliterationIn order to facilitate readers outside the Classical disci-plines, an effort has been made to transliterate Greek in those sections of the book for which knowledge of the original is not strictly necessary. When available, Greek names are rendered by their familiar Latin or English forms (e.g. Φάρσαλος: Pharsalus). Otherwise the translit-eration system recommended for ASCSA publications is used (e.g. Φάρσαλα: Pharsala). The following exceptions apply to ancient Greek:β bη êυ uω ôευ eu ̔ h (aspiration mark, when noted over initial vowels and diphthongs)Turkish names from the Ottoman period are rendered according to current Turkish spelling (Yeni imlâ kılavuzu, 3rd edition 1967). In citations, all names are given as origi-nally printed. TranslationEnglish translations are provided for the ancient and modern texts quoted throughout the book, except in sections 4.1.1–4 and 4.2.1–4, which assume a specialized knowledge of the Classical languages. Unless otherwise noted, the translations are my own. Geographical NamesFor the sake of consistency, the Thessalian toponymy employed by HMGS cartographers is adopted throughout the text. However, since the local reality often proves to be more exuberantly polyonymous than any map or gazeteer can reflect, older Greek and Turkish names are also noted as needed. Thessalian toponyms are subject to changes and permutations within what seem to be relatively short spans of time and accuracy is difficult to achieve. What used to be an oronym in one decade can become a hydro-nym or a district name in the next; not infrequently, place designations retrieved from scholarly articles and other specialized references turn out to be obsolete by the time one tries to retrace them. Readers are asked to approach the matter with an open mind. A similar plea must be made as to the inevitable ambiguity which underlies the use of the names Pharsalus and Pharsala: although the distinction is straightforward in most cases, occasionally ancient and modern tend to overlap in the narrative just as they do in the stratigraphical records.

Thus the Catalog of objects in Chapter 3 of this book is not based on autopsy, but on a study of photographic and archival records kindly placed at my disposal by the Italian Archaeological School in Athens. Whenever a scale was used in the excavation photographs I attempted to provide approximate measurements for the objects discussed.

Priest)Pharsalus is a name deceivingly familiar. As a locus of the literary tradition it is recognizable by most. The physical locus is another matter. Many of us have heard of the place at some point or another in connection with Julius Caesar and the famous battle of 48 BCE. Very few, on the other hand, have any precise knowledge of where Pharsalus is or what it looks like (the present writer certainly had none, until he wandered in the city’s main square on a viciously hot day of Summer 1993).Once a crossroads of important trade routes, in modern times Pharsalus has been confined to an isolated agrarian existence by the rearrangement of the Greek highway sys-tem. The city lies completely outside the tourist circuit. Disfigured by concrete, it has no iconic monuments by which to attract visitors or assert a visual identity of its own. Pharsalus lacks a ‘brand’ image such as the Parthenon or the Theater of Epidaurus.If asked to visualize Pharsalus, the Classically trained person is likely to turn to commonplace imagery about Thessaly: vague vistas of endless plains filled with horses and cereal cultivation come to mind from high school or college. When delving into the literature, the standard ref-erences appear to confirm this mental image. Pharsalus controlled that long tract of the West Thessalian plain stretching along the banks of the Enipeus river. Only when one makes a deliberate detour from the Athens-Thessaloniki superhighway and drives to modern Pharsala across the mountain pass of Eretria does it become appar-ent how imperfect such a perception is.Soon after taking the exit to National Road E65, the west-bound traveller realizes that he is driving at the far edge of a mountain massif which dominates every angle of vision with its vastness, overpowering all other land features in sight. This range, which arches over southeast Thessaly like the eyebrow of a giant, is Mt. Othrys, the mythical lad-der of the Titans. Biased as we are by the iconographical clichés which we mentioned earlier, to most of us it will come as a revelation that Pharsalus, a city of plains and horses, could be associated with such scenery. Yet, as we discover after further inquiry, much of the land ruled by Pharsalus in antiquity was made up by the northwest con-treforts of this range, sharing in many of the physical and cultural characteristics that are peculiar to mountain ter-ritories in ancient Greece. These rugged uplands, which climb up to the foot of Mt. Narthacium and extend as far west as the Alogopati elevations, remain largely unex-plored today. One of the objectives of the present study has been thus to reconsider the cave of the Nymphs on the Karapla hill in light of its little-known geographical set-ting, the mountainous borderland between Pharsalus and Proerna where the Othrys rises one last time before sub-siding into the West Thessalian Plain. For the investigation of this terrain is not only relevant to the reconstruction of the site’s physical features, but also of the cultural and socio-economic associations which made it a dominion of the local Nymphs. As Jennifer Larson writes,The spring might be described as the microhabitat of the nymph; if this is so, the macrohabitat is the mountain, which is regularly defined in both ancient and modern Greece not by a specific height but by its opposition to “the plain”. A “mountain”, oros, need be little more than a hill in terms of altitude. Yet oros carries a consistent range of associations in Greek thought. . . . It is the space beyond, and contrasted with urban areas. It is the setting for many activities of economic importance. To take Attica as an exam-ple, Parnes (like Pelion in Thessaly) was a source of timber and charcoal; Pentelikon and Hymettos were sources of marble; Hymettos was a site for apicul-ture. The economic significance of mountains also lay in in the age-old practice of pastoral transhu-mance . . . Goats and, to a lesser extent, sheep can be grazed well in the rocky scrub and wooded area of the mountain slopes. They share part of this habitat with bees, who are dependent on the wildflowers in the open areas like the slopes of Hymettos. Finally, the hunt took place in the wild mountain spaces, particularly in the pine and oak woods. The nymphs are associated with all of these occupations at some time or another. The activities of herding, beee-keeping, tree cutting, hunting and even quarrying might fall under their purview because of their spa-tial and conceptual ties to the oros (2001, pp. 8–9).If a deceiving sense of familiarity affects our perception of the Pharsalian landscape, the commonly held view of caves as dark, cellar-like spaces beneath the surface of the earth proves equally misleading when applied to the Karapla site. It is again with a feeling of surprise that the modern visitor steps inside the pleasantly lit, ascending corridor of this cave, once echoing with the sounds of a"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"introduction2almost a century now, proves to be, after closer analysis, a literary creation from a time when the historical Pantalces had long been dead. As an example of how Pharsalians recognized and constructed their past, the epigram from the Karapla hill is thus treated in this book as a study in reception rather than historical biography.A brief word on methodology and related matters. For a study of an ancient site, this monograph may seem over-loaded with details on contemporary Pharsalian realities. Methodological issues aside, my main reason for such an approach was the simple realization, when I first started working on the project, of how little is known outside Thessaly itself about this city and its surrounding territory. As noted above, despite its iconic status in our culture, Pharsalus is ultimately a stranger to most outsiders, gen-eral readers as well as professional Classicists. Individuals conversant with German can still turn to the works of early twentieth century geographers such as Stählin or Philippson, but these do not account for any changes that have since occurred in local toponomastics, hydrography, or population, not to mention the even more drastic alter-ations observed today in the socioeconomic and ecologic profiles of the area. It could be argued that as archaeolo-gists working in Greece, we have a responsibility not only towards the local archaeological heritage but also the human and natural landscapes in which this is enframed. By virtue of our profession, which brings us in direct con-tact with the realities of the sites we research, we are well positioned to inform the public of the larger social and environmental issues surrounding culturally ‘forgotten’ areas of Greece. Ultimately a monograph about a cave in the Pharsalian countryside does not seem too strange a place for addressing crucial concerns such as these.Although in some of my arguments I rely on the pres-ent to make inferences about the past, this work cannot aspire to be a fully developed analogical study of the kind described, e.g., by Halstead 2009. I am referring, in partic-ular, to the reconstruction of the cave’s garden proposed in Chapter 2.2.2: what I hoped to offer, there, is rather a working hypothesis which may be used until the future retrieval of specific palynological and archaeobotani-cal data can shed further light on the subject. As to the wisdom of using the modern Thessalian landscape to make deductions about the ancient one, I have tried my best to keep a balanced approach such as that envisioned by S. Isager and J.E. Skydsgaard,These investigations, and others, however, leave us with the fundamental question: to what degree dare we deduce from contemporary conditions to antiquity? [. . .] The geographic determinism that rushing stream. For the educated person, surprise will be accompanied by the realization that such a setting may be incompatible with the classical interpretation of caves as mystic descents, or katabaseis, to the world below. More suggestive of an attic than a cellar—and therefore more suitable for analysis within an anabatic, rather than catabatic, conceptual frame—the Karapla cave demands a careful reconsideration of its natural and architectural layout, largely neglected by former studies. Another rea-son for writing this book was to offer, therefore, a more comprehensive overview of the site’s material features than has been available thus far. Special attention was given to the terrace in the lower level of the sanctuary and the sacrificial area directly above it, with the con-necting stairway which still constitutes the visual focus of the sanctuary, highlighting its upward configuration. In concentrating on these areas, I chose to be guided by ancient eyes, following the lead of the two inscriptions found at the site, which emphasize the same features. To the study of these texts—perhaps the best known among the extant remains from the Karapla cave—a separate chapter is dedicated.Unlike the remote rural world to which they belong, Pantalces and his epigraphical legacy are by no means a foreign entity to the modern Classicist. In the last three decades this interesting Thessalian has been a guest star in several important studies (Yulia Ustinova’s 2009 Caves and the Ancient Greek Mind and Corinne Pache’s 2011 A Moment’s Ornament being two recent titles in a much lon-ger series). Scholarly fascination with Pantalces, however, has even earlier roots. The excitement which the Karapla inscriptions aroused in the academic world upon their appearance in the first issue of SEG can be assessed from the volume of notes and citations that fill their bibliogra-phy in the years between the two World Wars. Although educated classes in both Europe and America had been long acquainted with the charms of Greek epigram, never before had a personality as amiable as the founder of the Karapla cave emerged from the past to describe the life of a rural Nymph sanctuary. In contrast to the faceless por-trait of fellow cave-founder Archedamus of Thera, which stares wordlessly at us from the darkness of the Vari cave, the poetry attributed to Pantalces has almost the familiar ring of live speech:Greetings, you who are coming this way . . .Except that, just as in the other situations which we dis-cussed, in this case too the deceitful arts of Pharsalian witches seem to have been at play. For the intriguing per-sonage whose voice we have been coaxed into hearing for"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"3Introductionallows one to make unmodified deductions from contemporary pre-industrial agriculture to that of the ancient world holds as many pitfalls for the per-son who accepts it as it does for one who deliberately rejects it. [. . .] On the other hand, it is a well-known fact that you cannot grow sugar beets in the Sahara, and those who wish to disregard the later and better-known agrarian history of Greece would do well to abide by this simple rule with all its consequences (1992, p. 6).Several works cited in this book, such as Forbes on the economy of uncultivated land (1996), or Garnsey, Gallant and Rathbone on the Thessalian grain supply (1984), just to mention a few, show how a judicious use of the mod-ern evidence can provide important insight into scarcely documented aspects of the ancient world.Some misgivings could also be expressed about the reliability of literary depictions of woods and caves for reconstructive purposes, or the use of Hellenistic and Late Antique epigram as evidence for cult practice in earlier periods. When available, however, the material evidence seems to mesh well enough with the informa-tion of the written sources, encouraging investigators to be less guarded against the rhetorical nature of literary landscapes or the accuracy of post-Classical poets (see e.g. Mason 1995 on the realism of Longus’ rupestral tableaux; or Larson 2001, p. 228, note 4, on the Greek Anthology as evidence for ancient cult practices). Moreover, in researching sacred caves—or for that matter any features of the ancient Greek territory—it would be risky to draw too definite a separation between the physical locus and the cultural one. Space is recognized and constructed dif-ferently across history (“Like anything else” wrote French sociologist H. Lefebvre, “space is an historical product, in the classical sense of the term”, 1976, p. 31). If ‘literary’ caves are more likely to reflect conventional ideas than actual places, they can still teach us something about ancient perspective. A hypothetical modern researcher who is not conversant with locus amoenus topography, for example, could easily overlook the outer vegetation of a cave in favor of other features which seem more spe-leologically relevant to us. We owe it to a long tradition of stylized cavescapes from antiquity if we know that out-side growth was as essential a part of a cave site as the spe-leothems and galleries of the interior. In conclusion, one could say that the Karapla cave, just as the ancient culture which produced it, is too complex an affair to be captured by a single approach, the examination of a single body of evidence, or a single visit to the site: to quote the words of two eminent landscape historians of our time, “All sources of evidence must be used” (Grove and Rackham 2001, p. 21). Archaeological territories like Pharsalus are as elusive as they are fascinating. We can only hope that in trying to unravel the deceits of the Pharsalian witches we have not succumbed to those of our own mind."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���6 | doi ��.��63/9��9������6�3_003chapter 1Geography and Landscape (Plates I–V, VII–X)1 Overview of the Pharsalian Territory1Greece is changing fast and the most up-to-the-min-ute account of it is, in some measure, out of date by the time it appears.Fermor, RoumeliThe cave site examined in this study is located in south-ern Thessaly, on one of the rocky ridges which bound the southern border of the Pharsalian plain. Today this area falls within the borders of the Larissa peripheral unit, in the municipality of modern day Pharsala.2 In antiquity it belonged to the chôra or territory of Pharsalus, the main city in the tetrad of Phthiotis.3 Situated on a spur of the lower Narthacium range—approximately in the same spot where Pharsala stands today—ancient Pharsalus controlled the middle basin of the Enipeus river and the mountainland to the north and south of it.4 This rugged landscape of mountains and low hills unfolding at the edges of a river valley formed the natural background in which the Karapla sanctuary was established. It therefore seems reasonable, before undertaking a detailed exami-nation of the cave and its immediate surroundings, to begin with a general discussion of the Pharsalian region and its main morphological features, both as they appear to us now (1.1, pp. 4–8) and as they may have appeared in those distant times when the Karapla cult was alive (1.1, pp. 8–11). A section specifically dedicated to the dis-trict where the cave lies will conclude the chapter (1.2).At present the Pharsala municipality extends over an area of ca. 740 km2, incorporating the formerly indepen-dent municipalities of Enipeas in the west, Polydamantas in the east, and Narthaki in the south.5 The territory of ancient Pharsalus is estimated to have been far smaller, 1 For the locations discussed in this and the following sections, see the maps in Plates I–II.2 ΦΕΚ 87, Α, August 2010, p. 1791. 3 Stählin 1924, pp. 135–144; Béquignon, RE Suppl.

Its boundaries can be determined to a reasonable degree of approximation. In the west it was delimited by the adjoining territory of Euhydrium, probably along a line running somewhere in between this site and the road to Larissa. In the east it bordered the territory of Eretria where the Enipeus river enters the plain. In the north it shared with Scotussa the lower slope of the Revenia hills. In the south, where it was bounded by the Achaean domains of Peuma and Proerna, it extended up to the foot of the Narthacium range, encom-passing the highlands west of the upper Enipeus valley.6Geologically the region described above shows the char-acteristic profile of the Sub-Pelagonian zone, with deep-water limestones and other marine sedimentary rocks resting on an ophiolitic subtructure.7 Recent deposits of Holocene alluvium and Pliocene fluvio-terrestrial sedi-ment respectively fill the Pharsalian basin and form most of the lower elevations along its perimeter, including the elongated hill chain that bounds the northern part of the area, the Revenia or Mid Thessalian Ridge.8 In the south, Upper Cretaceous limestones with underlying layers of shales, cherts, marly limestones in fine alternations—a configuration referred to as ‘Schiefer-Hornstein Complex’—form the main ridge of the Narthacium. The ‘Schiefer-Hornstein Complex’ also fills the basins of Rizi and Narthaki in the highlands above town.9 In terms of tectonics, the region is situated in one of the major fault 6 On the size and boundaries of the Pharsalian territory: IACP, p. 702.

There appears to be no specific designation for these hills, although the area is generically known as Alogopati, or ‘Horse Trail’ district.17 A deep pass aptly named Steni, or ‘Narrow’,18 cleaves the Alogopati hills at their farthest northwest point, opening onto the great vistas of the western Thessalian Plain and connecting Pharsalus to the major transhellenic routes that crossed central Thessaly.19Between the two hill systems described above unfolds a natural “amphitheater of gentle and undulating reliefs”20 which skirts the southern Pharsalian basin alongside the ancient road departing from the city’s east gate (now National Road E65). During Ottoman times the region was known as the Chaïdaria valley, emphasizing the asso-ciation of this meadowland to the old Pharsalian suburb by the same name.21 Current topographic maps identify the same area as Mavrochoma, or ‘Black Soil’,22 possibly an allusion to the moist nature of the land, which stands in stark contrast with the barren look of the hills rising above it. Morphologically as well as topographically the Mavrochoma acts as a bridge between the lowlands of the Enipeus floodplain and the high country stretching from the southern end of town to the slopes of the Narthacium.

The Pharsalian hills reach their highest point northeast of the city with Mt. Thronos (or Sourla: 429 masl). 17 The name appears as early as 1886 in Heuzey’s map, where it is used to designate the northermost elevation in the system, now known as Karapla hill; cf. Georgiades 1894, p. 24. The Alogopati reliefs peak at 521 masl with Mt.

Chaïdaria is the westermost of the three oikismoi or develop-ments of the Pharsala municipal unit, the other two being Stathmos and Rizi, respectively to the north and south of town. 22 HMGS General Use Map, 1985 edition, sheet ‘Fársala’ [Plate III].zones of southern Thessaly, thus being prone to seismic activity of varying strength.10Much of the land once controlled by Pharsalus was either mountain or lowland bound by mountains. The southern part of this territory (modern municipal units of Pharsala and Narthaki) is occupied by the contreforts of the lower Othrys,11 while the low country in the north (modern municipal unit of Enipeas) is delimited by the long hills of the Revenia.12 In the east (modern municipal unit of Polydamantas), the minor chain of the Ziragiotis13 guards the routes which connected Pharsalus to the sea.Encircled in nearly all directions by the curving stream of the Enipeus, the lower Othrys forms a self-contained mountainous region projecting into the west Thessalian plain with the promontory of Proerna at Neo Monastiri. The main ridge of the system, which rises approximately 10 km south of modern Pharsala, is officially known today by the historical name of Mt. Narthacium.14 Many Pharsalians still use the local designation Kassidiaris, or ‘Mangy Head’, a word which imaginatively captures the scarred appearance of this karstic landscape, unevenly covered by scrub and deeply scored by cracks and fissures.15 Here, in the southwest reaches of the Othrys massif, the territory of ancient Pharsalus gave way to the domains of Phthiotic Achaia.10 Papadimitriou and Karakostas 2003, p. 402, table 2.

On current maps these reliefs are no longer indicated by a collective name but by the individual name of each peak, e.g. HMGS General Use Map, 1985 edition, sheet ‘Velestínon’. The older denomination Tsiragiotika—from Tsiragi, a village at the east end of the chain mentioned by Leake 1835, p. 452 (most probably the same as Philippson’s Serantzi, modern Perivlepto)—appears to have fallen into disuse since before the 1950’s.14 On the uncertain identification of this ridge with the ancient Narthakion oros (X.

The western one, named after the village of Rizi, unfolds along the valley of the Chaïdarorema,25 extending in the opposite direction up to the lower slopes of the Alogopati mountainland.In contrast with the mountainous south, the northern part of Pharsalus’ territory was almost entirely occupied by its much celebrated plain.26 After descending from the Othrys ca. 11 km east of town, the Enipeus river makes an ample bend to the west, hewing a gradually widening valley between the Mid Thessalian range and the lower spurs of the Narthacium. Seen from above, this famous district of northcentral Greece appears as a cone-shaped expanse of undulating fields enclosed by hills in all direc-tions but west, where the land fans out into the vast spaces of the Karditsa basin.

Following the city’s transition from a prevalently pas-toral to an agricultural economy in the second half of 1900, Pharsalian hydrography has been deeply altered by the unregulated exploitation of its groundwater resources.33 Consistent with the depletion of the aquifer, many of Pharsalus’ famously plentiful springs34 have now ceased to exist, while the extensive marshes once characteristic to this district have all succumbed to land reclamations with their animal and plant population.35 A distant mem-ory of this hydric wealth—and of the divine powers who once presided over it—can be still discerned in the local toponymy, in names such as Neraida (‘Water Nymph’), and Bougiouk Tsanarlis, from Turkish büyük, ‘small’): Stählin 1924, p. 82; Decourt 1990, pp. 39–40. 30 Modern day Apidanou street, in the west end of town, is partly built over the tract of river that has disappeared.

Precipitation (ca. 500 mm a year) is concentrated in the fall and winter months, but rainstorms of considerable intensity continue to occur from May to September. Since the 1970’s a general transition towards a more arid climate has been known to affect the traditional weather pattern, with further conse-quences for the hydrographic situation described above.37In terms of vegetation the Pharsalian territory belongs to the Ostryo-Carpinion subdivision of the lower Mediter-ranean zone Quercetalia pubescentis, and specifically to the Coccifero-Carpinetum growth area.38 The downy oak (Quercus pubescens), the oriental plane (Platanus orienta-lis), and the common elm (Ulmus campestris) are charac-teristic trees of this countryside, along with smaller plants such as the Mediterranean hackberry (Celtis australis) and the wild pear (Pyrus pyraster). Prickly oak (Quercus coccifera) is the dominant shrub species. Above 200 m, the prevailing vegetation cover is the typical one of Greek regions with a long pastoral history, a pervasive tapestry of maquis and phrygana interspersed with patches of steppe. In the plain, steppe and occasional savanna con-tinue to occupy the areas that have not been reached by agriculture.39 Woodland is rare, usually appearing in the form of gallery forests growing along streams or thickets of overgrown maquis.40Within this natural theater, a most conspicuous absence is that of the animal element, especially in the low country.

Small game, foxes, wolves, and other common animals of the rural countryside are now encountered mostly in the uplands, as is a great percentage of the live-stock reared in the region.41 Once a routine presence in the fields during fallow periods, grazing flocks of sheep and goat now tend to be seen less and less in the plain, as the recent intensification of the agricultural cycle has deprived them of their lower pastures.A reverse tendency is observed in the human demo-graphics of the region, which show a steady decline in the population of the mountain villages to the advantage of the city and the lowland settlements.42 Ever since the Pharsalian economy began to change from a traditional agropastoral system to a cash crop industry, human activi-ties have been progressively re-centering around the plain. The great majority of municipal residents are now engaged in commercial agriculture (cotton, wheat, bar-ley, maize, and vegetables),43 although some subsistence farming is still present, and herding continues to play a reduced role in local economy (caprovids and cattle).44 Other subsistence practices once found in the area, such as those traditionally associated with wetland and riparian settings,45 have instead completely faded out of Pharsalian daily life, along with the environments which supported them.Ethnically and culturally the municipality retains the composite nature that has been one of its enduring char-acteristics throughout the ages.

Coote Lake 1954, p. 174.42 The censuses of 1981, 1991, and 2001 show that between the early 1980’s and the early 2000’s, Pharsala experienced a demographic growth of over 38%, raising from a population of less than 8,000 to one of almost 10,000. Conversely, over the same two decades, the population of rural communities such as Narthaki and Achilleio decreased by a commensurate or even higher percent-age (data EL.STAT.).43 ΕΣΔΦ, pp. 114–120. A few other crops once traditional of this region, such as tobacco (Kriegk 1858, p. 36; Georgiades 1894, p. 25) and sugar beet (Decourt 1990, p. 44), have lost their promi-nence today.44 About one third of the modern population of Pharsala is still engaged in agropastoral activities, according to EL.STAT. data for 2001.

A mixture of long- and short-term migrants, Pharsalian tsinganoi have kept a steady presence along the banks of the Apidanus since Ottoman times, making a living as sea-sonal crop pickers and farm hands.49Overall, the image which the municipality offers today is that of a place in transition, striving to adjust its identity to the socioeconomic changes of the last half century and emancipate itself from its public image as a rural, unin-spiring province at the fringes of modern Thessalian cul-ture.50 The second decade of our century, in particular, has seen the arising of a new wealth of nationally and interna-tionally funded initiatives centered on the revitalization of the municipal seat and its surrounding communities. Especially important, in this effort, is the promotion of the area’s archaeological resources, still unknown to the wider public,51 as well as the protection of the historical land-scape within which such resources are housed.

Pharsala’s pre-nineteenth century fame as a hub of important trade routes (reflected in its Turkish name Çatalca, or ‘Crossroads’) began to dwindle after the city was struck by an epidemic in 1818. The effects of this decline transpire from the descriptions of contemporary tourist guides, in which Pharsala is variously portrayed as a “straggling little town” (Baedeker guide of 1894, p. 225), or a “village . . . much ruined, and in very miserable condition” (Murray 1900, col. 758).

Since then, a remarkable amount of new evidence has been unearthed through rescue excavations; see note 73 below.headsprings of the Apidanus,52 the rehabilitation of rural sites like the Karapla nymphaeum is thus central to the region’s revival, in that it serves a dual function of both natural and archaeological preservation.Having come to the end of this brief overview we can ask ourselves to what extent the territory described above may reflect the one in which the Karapla sanctuary was created, approximately two and half millennia ago. As far as one can tell, except for the now ubiquitous presence of agriculture and the severe degradation of the hydro-logical network, the Pharsalian plain and the surrounding mountainland have not changed much from antiquity. Natural vegetation is likely to have been more substantial, especially along the eastern fringes of the territory, where extensive concentrations of oaks can still be seen to this day. Here, on one of the low hills between Pharsalus and Scotussa, was the oracular grove of Zeus Phegonaeus, or Zeus of the Oakery, considered by some as the predeces-sor of the cult at Dodona.53 Agriculture would not have overpowered the landscape as it does now; the intricate, seemingly endless mesh of cultivated plots that fills the aerial view of the Pharsalian plain is a product of the last few decades.54 In antiquity smaller grids of tilled fields would have coexisted with a natural scenery of grassland, marshes and patches of savanna.55 Pollen analysis shows that the weather in Classical times was wetter than it is n ow,56 with probable consequences on the agroclima-tology of the region. Pharsalus enjoyed a more favorable topography than the rest of the West Thessalian plain, with ample tracts of well-drained hill country stretching 52 On the Municipality’s historical restoration projects for 2011–2014, see ΕΣΔΦ, pp. 201–205. 53 Sch.

If the plain was a natural terrain for horses and cattle, the high country pro-vided pasturage for goats and bees. We may also expect that it contributed, as it still does today, wood for fuel and construction, wild game, and edible and medicinal herbs.61 Another sector of the ‘marginal’ landscape which contributed both food and raw materials were the wet-lands once formed by the Enipeus and its tributaries in the low country.62 As late as the mid-twentieth century, swamps such as those of the Apidanus and the Aïklis were 57 Georgiades 1894, p. 46.

Organized as an oligarchy, the Thessalian elites had control over a vast portion of the land and the herds which grazed on it; the rest was distributed among two other classes of free citizens known as the cavalrymen (hippeis) and the hoplites (hoplitai).65 The enserfed locals (penestai) provided the work force necessary to cultivate the fields and tend the animals, living off the product in excess of their rent.66 As in the other oligarchic states of Thessaly, livestock appears to have been the true focus of Pharsalian economy, not just as a mere substinence strategy but as a wealth- and status-engendering activity of the elites.67 In this instance, too, the variety of terrain 63 I collected this information from private conversations with locals.

Because of its topogra-phy, less fragmented than other parts of Greece, Thessaly was able to support, particularly in the early part of its history, the development of large estates comparable to the Roman latifun-dia.

As in the rest of Thessaly, evidence for human presence in the Pharsalus area begins in the Stone Age.70 The archaeological record from the Helladic and Geometric periods is also significant (note 122 below), although no traces of extensive settle-ments have been recovered to date that could be recon-nected to the epic tradition on Phthia and the kingdom of Achilles.71 Scholars have attempted to identify Phthia with a variety of sites in the Pharsalian territory, but their suggestions remain thus far only theoretical.72 Consistent 68 On the topographical and climatological characteristics which made the Othrys an optimal summer destination for the pasto-ralists of the adjacent plains, see Reinders and Prummel 1998, p. 91 (it is significant that, out of the small handful of testimonies which are available to us on ancient transumhance, two should be associated with this mountain; Reinders and Prummel 1998, pp. 92–94; Cuscuná 2008, pp. 357–359). 69 For the use of ethnographic models in the study of ancient Greek pastoralism as well as a thoughtful assessment of current research on the subject, see Forbes 1995, pp. 325–338.70 Pottery of the Chalcolithic and Neolithic B periods was retrieved by N.

Od. 4, 9); the earlier literature, how-ever, is far from clear on the subject. As Béquignon and others have noted, although Verdelis’ findings in west Pharsalus appear to support Stählin’s identification of Phthia with Agia Paraskevi (1924, p. 136; 1914, p. 17), evidence for a substantial Bronze Age center—as Phthia presumably would have been—is yet to be unearthed.

Koutselir),81 but it is uncertain whether the Pharsalian border did extend this far. As for Makkarai, a locality placed “above Pharsalus” by Stephanus of Byzantium, no convincing identifications have yet been suggested.82Except for these few locations, ancient writers are not otherwise generous with information on Pharsalian topography. Occasional references to the Pharsalian plain appear in the work of historians;83 poets seem to be more interested in the region’s hydrology—especially the Enipeus and Apidanus rivers, usually portrayed in tones far grander than the modest appearance of these streams today would warrant.84 Descriptions of the local relief are even scarcer. The elevations which bound the plain in the vicinity of the city are mentioned in Caesar’s Civil War, but only in a passing manner.85 A brief reference to the Revenia as the ‘Back of Thessaly’, nôton Thessaliês, also appears in 79 As Stählin succinctly puts it, “On the Kassidiaris mountains between Tsatma [modern day Petroto] and Pharsalus there are no known ruins” (1924, p. 170).

In Homer “fair Enipeus” is a veritable lady-killer (Od. 11, 235–240), while to Euripides the Apidanus is “father to the fairest streams’ (Hec. 451–454). Some authors refer to the ‘wild’, ‘threatening’, nature of the Enipeus (e.g. Zonar. s.v. Enipeus) as well as the force of its floods (Luc. 7, 224; Fron. Str. 2, 3, 22). Contrary to modern practice, ancient authors often stress the the superiority of the Apidanus over the Enipeus (e.g. Str. 9, 5, 6; Plin. Nat. 4, 30; see the comments by Perrin 1885, p. 175; Stählin 1924, p. 82). As we saw earlier, a similar pattern is also noted in Ottoman toponomastics (Büyük, or ‘great’ Tsanarlis, vs. Küçük or ‘small’ Tsanarlis). 85 Caes. Civ. 3, 88–99. Two brief references to the steep cliffs where the Pompeians take flight after the first engagement (Civ. 3, an epigram from the Greek Anthology cited by Plutarch.86 Lastly, when we turn to the epigraphical record from the area we find the evocative toponym Makouniai, once used to designate the poppy sprinkled country fields that fill the landscape spreading around Pharsalus and our cave (IThess I, 50, line 3). This region and the river which runs through it, the Louerchos or present-day Chaïdarorema, are discussed in closer detail in the next section.2 The Pharsalian Hill Country: Anatomy of a BorderlandA mountain is in the eye of the beholder. Height is only part of the story.Buxton, “Imaginary Greek Mountains” (adapted)The Karapla ridge, where our cave lies, is an escarpment formed at the rim of a geological fault.87 From the coun-tryside behind Pharsala it runs in a southeast-northwest direction for a little more than 4 km, overlooking the mid-dle Enipeus valley across the Mavrochoma meadow. The name Karapla, ‘Bald Head’ (from karaphla, a metathesized form of phalakra), is a reference to the barren nature of its crestline.88 It reflects the tendency, already encountered in local toponomastics, to anthropomorphize mountains as metaphors of the human head.89 Somewhat paradoxi-cally, during the early twentieth century the same hill 93; 95) effectively capture the rugged look of Pharsalus’ karstic topography. 86 Plu.

HMGS surveyors label the hill Sykies, apply-ing the designation Karaplas to the Chaïdarorema (General Use Map, sheet ‘Fársala’, 1985 [Plate III]). Locally there seems to be no consistency between the use of the feminine form Karapla, ‘Bald Head’, and the masculine Karaplas, ‘Bald Man’. 88 This naming practice has ancient origins: “All barren moun-tains are called ‘Bald Heads’ (Phalakrai)” claims e.g. Stephanus of Byzantium, in discussing a summit of Mt. Ida particularly devoid of life on account of its cold temperatures. The geogra-pher also cites two more localities by the same name in Corcyra and Libya; see St. Byz. s.v. Phalakrai. It is worth noting that in Thessaly, as elsewhere in Greece, Phalakros/Phalakra occur as personal names (e.g. Robert 1938, p. 164); for two examples from the immediate vicinities of the Karapla, see IThess I, 50, lines 23–24 and the comments by Decourt 1990a, p. 175.89 Cf. See e.g. the name Kassidiaris (‘Mangy Head’; modern day Narthacium) at p. 5 above.

The most signifi-cant of these are located ca. 7 km southwest of Pharsala, in a locality aptly called Vrysia, ‘The Fountain Place’.93 Here a stream by the same name cuts a narrow bed between the Karapla and the west Narthacium range, flowing into the plain just north of town (a small marshland, one of the few to survive the massive land reclamations of the last century, marks this spot even in the heat of the summer months).94 No longer active today are the headsprings of the Apidanus in the western outskirts of Pharsala, dam-aged by seismic activity in the mid-twentieth century (p. 6 above).95 Vestiges of another important source connected with the city’s water supply are also recorded at the oppo-site end of town, east of the neighborhood of Varoussi.96 Here, on the old road to Achilleio, Arvanitopoulos identi-fied the remains of an ancient aqueduct fed by a spring called Aï Thanasis.

The remains of the aqueduct are still visible on the south side of the road, opposite the rocky hill where once stood the chapel of Agios Athanasios.

This name was once used to designate a cluster of minor reliefs that rise directly west of the Rizi plateau in the lower reaches of the Narthacium. The highest of these, named Grivas (521 masl), merges with the east end of the Karapla about three and a half kilometers southwest of Pharsala. Today Alogopati is a location (thesis) at the back of the moun-tain, on the slope that faces the Narthacium across the Rizi plateau.Karapla, Grivas, and associated reliefs form the western boundary of a hinterland that stretches from Pharsala to the foot of the Narthacium, encompassing the high country south of town. Within this region we can distinguish three zones showing similar characteris-tics in elevation and terrain. In the west raises the steep meadow of the Mavrochoma, which extends from the outskirts of Pharsala to the base of the Karapla. South-southeast of the city are the contiguous basins of Rizi and Narthaki, formed respectively around the valleys of the Chaïdarorema and Kakletzorema streams. The prevailing type of terrain is highland with hilly/mountainous fringes to the north, south and west. Altitudes range from 200 m, in the southern outskirts of Pharsala, to 350–400 m on the lower slopes of the Narthacium.The differentiation of the territory into mountain and highland corresponds to a difference in geological zones.91 The Upper Cretaceous transgression is observed in the laminated limestone of the hills (Karapla) and the brecci-ated and sub-lithographic limestones of the higher eleva-tions (Grivas). In the highland between the mountains and Pharsala we observe instead a soft belt of radiolarian chert and argillaceous schists dating to the Jurassic and Triassic periods. Under it lies an ophiolite formation (peri-dotites, serpentines and dolerites) which surfaces along the southern perimeter of Pharsala, interspersing with the limestones of Prophitis Ilias and the neighboring hills.This geological structure has a direct effect on the hydrol-ogy of the region. The limestones of the elevated areas form a karstic aquifer limited in depth by the waterproof 90 Giannopoulos 1919, p. 48; cf. 1912, p. 668, and, for a depiction of this landscape consistent with the ‘Green Mountain’ designa-tion, Georgiades 1894, p. 24. Arvanitopoulos, the first archaeolo-gist ever to visit the area, only uses the name Karapla, 1910, p. 182.91 Geological subdivision of the Pharsalian territory: Geological Map of Greece, 1964 edition, sheet ‘Farsala’; cf.

The main waters in this system are the aforementioned Chaïdarorema and Kakletzorema streams, which drain respectively the basins of Rizi and Narthaki. Both main-tain a stable, if not always substantial flow throughout the year, descending into the plain where they merge with the Enipeus.98 Other spring-fed streams include the Aïklis, which skirts Pharsala to the north after curving around the hill of Thronos (Sourla), and, further to the east, the Kotzarmani, a large rema that runs between oak-shaded banks near the village of Ampelia.99 For the rest, this ter-ritory is marked by a number of minor rain-fed streams whose narrow beds trace weedy paths across the sur-rounding countryside. During the winter rains, seasonal lakes are sometimes also formed by runoff water and marshy conditions occur in some areas.Soils are prevalently lithosols formed on limestone bed-rock, with a reddish-brown color and characteristically poor horizon development in the more elevated areas.100 Erosion—the main agent of change in this landscape prior to the arrival of bulldozers—is particularly evident in the countryside west of the city, characterized by the steep, harsh gradients of the Mavrochoma and the Karapla. Karst topography dominates in the upper part of this moun-tain and the rest of the Alogopati reliefs, especially to the south, in the great wasteland of limestone and prickly oak 97 Arvanitopoulos 1910, p. 180; Stählin 1914, p. 7. See note 96 above: on the same side of the road as the aqueduct are also an old fountain (cf. the name ‘Vrysi’ recorded for this location by Hiller von Gaertringen 1911, p. 62) and a number of recently restored early twentieth century waterworks (ΕΣΔΦ, pp. 203–205; Liapis, Ta Pharsala 2013). The site of the spring lies a little further up the street, in an area covered by a small rotunda. 98 Fed by an intricate network of seasonal streams, the Kakletzorema carries a volume of water much larger than its western neighbor. In the elevated areas its aspect and behavior can be compared to those of a true mountain torrent.99 The Kotzarmani, or ‘Great Wood’ stream, takes its name from the extensive gallery forest which runs along most of its course. Similar allusions to the wooded nature of the area east of Pharsala are not uncommon in local toponymy, cf. Dendra, ‘Trees’; Xylades, ‘Woodcutters’; and the examples cited at note 53 above. See also Decourt 1990, p. 22.100 Sivignon 1975, p. 91.that overlooks the gorge of the Vrysias. Other forms of ero-sion, such as gullying, are visible in the lower elevations, as exemplified by the many channels of storm-fed streams that streak the north toe slope of the Karapla and the ‘natural amphitheater’ of the Mavrochoma. These bear testimony to the occurrence of runoff in times of heavy rainfall, despite the absorbing action of the karst. During ordinary rainfall, the porous nature of the bedrock and the mantle of hardy, tenacious scrub which covers most of the uncultivated land significantly reduce the amounts of soil lost to sheet flooding. Not as protected are the increas-ingly larger plots reclaimed for agricultural use, especially in the upper part of the Mavrochoma. Here, when the land is still barren after autumn sowing, the topsoil is exposed to the intense rainstorms of the season.101As for the crops grown in the high country, the slop-ing, well-drained fields of the Mavrochoma are a natural home to moisture sensitive cultivations like wheat and pulses, while the Rizi tableland is extensively planted with cotton. The growth of agriculture in this part of the Pharsalian territory has not been matched by a cor-responding growth in population. For unlike the neigh-bouring basin of Narthaki, which is inhabited by relatively large farming communities such as Dilopho (population: 253) and Narthaki (population: 355), the Rizi plateau is utterly devoid of people except for the small eponymous settlement at the south end of the region, which exhibits a total population of 5 individuals. Given the short dis-tance (8,6 km by main road; 3,8 km if using the dirt path), Rizi farmers prefer to commute from Pharsala, a practice which the development of modern means of transporta-tion has facilitated in most parts of the surrounding coun-tryside. This trend towards a depopulation of the rural areas—presumably to the advantage of the municipal seat102—is illustrated by the following table:101 The introduction of autumn-sown cereal cultivations has increased erosion rates in the Thessalian hill country by as much as 1,7 cm per year (Grove and Rackham 2001, p. 265; con-trast with the earlier practice of sowing cereals in the spring, in order to protect the crops from floods; Garnsey et al. 1984, p. 31, Karagiorgou 2001, p. 16). A tabulation of sheet-flood erosion rates, as calculated on different parent materials during experi-ments conducted by MEDALUS in the early 1990’s, is given by Grove and Rackham 2001, p. 265, table 14.iv.102 ΕΣΔΦ, pp. 96–97 table 10.3."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Chapter 114Table 1 Decrease in the population of rural centers south of Pharsala 1981–2011 (data EL.STAT.)Village (with driving distance from Pharsala)Census 1981Census 1991Census 2001Census 2011Narthaki (13,7 km)961589584355Achilleio (6,0 km)561396344200Dilopho (10,5 km)519399369253In antiquity the uplands described above corresponded to the chôra or In-territory of ancient Pharsalus, while the mountainous zones at their fringe were its escha-tiai or Out-territory.103 The eastern sector of the region was more developed than the western one.

An intensive land survey (prospection serrée) directed by J.C. Decourt in 1986 confirms that the the Rizi plateau was no more populated in antiquity than it is today.105 In this absence of archaeological data, an interesting glimpse into the region’s past is afforded by an inscription found in Rizi in the nineteenth century, IThess I, 50 (= IG IX 2, 234).106 The stone, of a dark variety called sideropetra by the locals, was used as an altar top in the small church of the Presentation of the Virgin.

Other Prehistoric sites in the area of the Narthaki Plateau include Narthakion 1 ,2, 3 and 4 (Decourt 1990, p. 55, fig. 23, nos. 71–73; cf. note 70 above). 105 1990, p. 66. As the French scholar specifies in another publica-tion (1990a, p. 181), the only (alleged) antiquities recently found in this area were a few coins reported by a shepherd. Decourt’s results thus seem to be at variance with Moretti’s earlier hypoth-esis that the Makouniai might have been a settlement of some sort on the Rizi plateau (commentary to ISE 96, p. 64: see also Hatzopoulos 1993, p. 153; 1996, pp. 64–65; and, more recently, Pasqual 2007, p. 176).106 Bibliography and commentary: Decourt 1990a, pp. 163–184; cf.

Τhe city of the Pharsalians granted to those who from the beginning were joined to them in sympolity and most willingly fought on their side (sumpoliteuomenois kai sumpolemeisantessi) the same citizen rights (politeian) as the Pharsalians always had. We also gave them the unculti-vated lands in the Makouniai by the banks of the Louerchos, sixty plethra for each adult, in perma-nent possession. The decision was taken under the leadership of Eumelidas son of Nikasas, Lukos son of Droupakos, Oiolukos son of Mnasippos, Lukos son of Pherekrates and Antiochos son of Dunatos.(Names of grantees follow)One of the questions posed by this inscription concerns the location of the lands which are mentioned in it. It has been suggested that Makouniai is a toponym formed from 107 The first 159 entries in the list contain names followed by the patronymic; with one exception (line 176), all other entries con-tain names only. This distinction—also reflected in the arrange-ment of text, with the last 17 names occupying a column entirely of their own (col. 4)—is likely to mark a difference in social sta-tus. As Decourt notes, the absence of the patronymic identifies the individuals in the second group as slaves, freedmen, or simi-lar category, 1990a, pp. 175–176.108 Larissa: IG IX 2, 517; Phalanna: IG IX 2, 1228 (further bibliogra-phy in Decourt 1990a, p. 176, note 12).

Based on its weight and size, scholars doubt that the slab ever moved too far from its original location. It is agreed that the Rizi countryside, only 4 km south of town, offers a very plausible match for the lands cited above. As righly pointed by Decourt, the existence of a dedicated city gate opening in this direction would point to the relevance of the area in Pharsalian affairs.111 The presence of the Chaïdarorema is also consistent with the reference to a river in line 3 of the decree. Following Stählin, this water-course has been tentatively identified with the inscrip-tion’s Louerchos.112A second, closely related question concerns the identity of the grantees themselves. Neither metics nor mercenar-ies, this group of individuals is presented as a community outside the Pharsalian citizen body but with close, ancient ties to the city.113 Who exactly were they, and where were they settled? Their characteristics appear to match those of the Penests (penestai), a class of unfree laborers who lived in Thessaly in conditions that have been compared to those of Laconian Helots.114 Like the people named in the Rizi inscription, the Penests fought in war alongside the Thessalian army and received farmland in compen-sation for their services. The matter of their location is more complex. As mentioned above, Decourt’s survey of the Rizi plateau has not yielded any evidence for ancient habitation. The French scholar therefore suggests that 109 Heuzey and Daumet 1876, p. 428.

Thus, according to Heuzey, the beneficiaries of the decree are not foreigners, but constitute “a category of Pharsalian residents” in some kind of client relationship to the local oligarchy (Heuzey and Daumet 1876, p. 427). See the commentary by Decourt 1990a, pp. 176–177. 114 Heuzey and Daumet 1876, p. 427; Decourt 1990a, p. 179 and com-mentary to IThess 50, p. 63; Helly 1995, pp. 302–311.

In antiquity this territory was bound at its lower end by a road which linked Pharsalus to a major communication route, the great trans-Thessalian way Thessaloniki-Larissa-Lamia-Corinth.117 A small section of this important road, the course of which appears to have coincided in part with that of the old National Road, is still visible today in Thetidos Street immediately to the northeast of the town market.118 Here west- and south-bound travellers left Pharsalus from a gate near the headprings of the Apidanus.119 Further up the same stretch of city wall, above the small hill of Agia Paraskevi, three more gates opened onto the countryside west and southwest of town; the southernmost of these connected with a path to Rizi120 and perhaps another road which passed between the 115 Decourt 1990a, p. 182. As Decourt observes, the language of the decree differs from that of enktêsis texts: “If the text does not mention the right to purchase homes, would it be too far fetched to conclude that these people already had residences in Pharsalus?” (1990a, p. 177). See also note 105 above.116 Cf. pp. 7–8 above. Decourt himself warns that such comparative ethnographic data ought to be used with a grain of salt (1990a, p. 184); cf.

Especially notable is an area between Agia Paraskevi and the neigh-boring hill of Gyphtovrysi where the Pharsalians, follow-ing in the tradition of their Bronze and Iron Age ancestors, buried their dead on the sides of the main road.122 Cult sites are attested at both ends of the cemetery, a temple of Zeus Thaulios on the summit of Agia Paraskevi and a shrine to an unidentified deity across from Gyphtovrysi.123 Beyond this point no further traces of permanent struc-tures have been found. West of the cemetery stretched an uninhabited countryside bound by hills on one side and marshes on the other. It seems doubtful that the lands between the Chaïdarorema and the site of our cave were farmed in antiquity as they are today. Rather, according to a practice still attested in the late twentieth century, this territory was probably used for grazing, hunting, and other occupations associated with the economy of fringe areas or eschatiai. The economic and demographic map of the region can be approximated from the characteris-tics of the terrain. The presence of fish and waterfowl in the lower valley of the Chaïdarorema, where the swamps formed by this stream merged with those of the Tampakos/Apidanus, is likely to have brought hunters and fishermen 121 A trace of this thoroughfare survives perhaps in the old route from Pharsala to Petroto (formerly Tsatma, Turkish Çatma), clearly marked on Heuzey’s map of 1886. A ‘drivable soft surface road’ in its lower tract, after a certain elevation the Petroto route degenerates into a mule track (HMGS General Use Map, sheets ‘Fársala’, 1985 [Plate III] and ‘Dhomokós’, 1987). 122 Evidence for the continuous use of this area as a burial ground is found from the Middle Helladic to the Hellenistic periods. The Bronze Age is well-documented, starting with two cist tombs dating to 2000 BCE and continuing through the end of the Mycenaean period with a variety of the most representa-tive burial types. On the west cemetery see Verdelis 1948/1949, 1950/1951, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1955 (the so-called ‘Verdelis Tomb’, on the north foothill of Gyphtovrysi, is briefly discussed at p. 88 note 48 below). See also Katakouta 2012; Stamatopoulou and Katakouta 2013. A new comprehensive study of the Pharsalian cemeteries is in preparation by Stamatopoulou.123 Zeus Thaulios: Arvanitopoulos 1907, pp. 151–153; Stählin 1914, p. 7 and 1924, p. 136; Mili 2015, appendix 2, p. 335.

Temple (?) to unidentified deity: ca. 20 minutes west of town, on a property of the Ministry of Agriculture, Verdelis reports a 70 m. long foundation wall, covered at the west end by a cistern, which he tentatively assigns to a temple (1952, p. 203). This may be the same structure as that observed by Gell in 1827 (p. 286, “ruins of a temple”) near the fountain which still stands opposite the Rizi intersection along E65. See p. 18 note 3 below.to this part of the Pharsalian countryside.124 Similarly, the presence of wooded areas upriver—planes and other riparian trees comparable to those growing today in the Chaïdaria district—can be plausibly associated with the activity of woodcutters and charcoal-burners. Lastly, we can expect the phrygana-mantled hillsides of the Karapla to have been a most appropriate domain for the wander-ings of goatherds and their flocks. This sparse universe of travellers, hunters, woodcutters, and herdsmen, set against a landscape of limestone ridges and marshy plains, con-stituted the primary socio-geographical context within which the cult at our cave was established and supported over a span of several hundred years.125 With the disap-pearance of the wetlands and the introduction of large scale cultivation in some areas, this context has under-gone significant physical change in recent times: still, much of the land remains uninhabited and the modalities of human interaction with it continue, for the most part, to be the same. This is especially true of the Alogopati region, the rugged mountainland at the back of the Karapla where Pharsalus bordered with the neighboring state of Proerna. Here, at the far end of the Othrys massif, it is possible for us to get a better understanding of that notion of marginality which ancients refer to in qualifying this kind of terrain. Even if the old territorial borders are long gone, engulfed by those of the present day periph-eral unit, Alogopati remains a world of boundaries. Here is where the plain begins and the Othrys dies, rising one last time in the rocky ridges that skirt the old National Road to Lamia. As at its northeast end, vast marshes once lined the edges of this territory, enclosing the mountain like a moat. At the same time, as we hike the high country within this natural boundary the eye registers a near total absence of directional landmarks. From here to Rizi the land that lies in between is untouched by roads or even paths that can be managed with a regular vehicle.126 Scattered stone 124 Stratigraphic sampling in the area has revealed layers of dark earth that confirm the presence of marshes in connection with the Chaïdarorema (I am most indebted to S. Katakouta for this and other information on the region west of Pharsala). Considered in this light the name ‘Mavrochoma’, used some-times for the district, assumes particularly interesting connota-tions. On the Pharsalian wetlands see pp. 6; 9 above.125 On the openness of this rustic environment to influences from the city, facilitated by the presence of major communication routes, see p. 21 below. 126 The HMGS General Use Map of 1985 [Plate III] records one cat-egory 1 (evvatos, or ‘passable’) mule track ascending the south slope of the Karapla from the W end of the Steni pass to a point SE of our cave. Further south a handful of such trails are shown departing from Vrysia to the summits above the village and the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"17Geography and Landscapecairns provide the only points of reference in this waste-land of limestone and low-growing prickly oak, marking invisible lanes for shepherds and their flocks. The pastoral element is more evident here than most other parts of the Pharsalian territory north of the Narthacium.127 Up to the mid-twentieth century the area was a traditional winter-ing station for transhumant herdsmen, reflecting a prac-tice that may have very remote origins.128The landscape preserved on the southern slopes of the Karapla can give us a better idea of what the land looked like on the other face of the ridge—the one fac-ing Pharsalus—before the changes introduced by agricul-ture. Although its roughness may be suggestive of the old dichotomy between nature and culture, such distinctions should be used with care. This kind of terrain was—and still is—as culturally charged as that of the city and the farmed countryside it borders with. Karst topography, ter-ritorial marginality, and pastoralism are all interconnected aspects of the Nymphs’ socio-geographical domain. The Nymph shrine discussed in the next chapters was located at the far end of the “finely calibrated scale” which existed in ancient Greece between any urban nucleus, with its adjacent farmland, and the uncultivated areas at the edges of its territory.129 A one hour walk from Pharsalus, the Karapla cave stood outside the ‘civilized’ domain of the city and the cropped fields around it, but was still part of an economic and religious continuum which linked the center of this universe to its outer margins. Herding—in Thessaly a means of subsistence but also a source of wealth for urban elites—played a major role in bringing current location (topothesia) of Alogopati. As of this writing a long driveway has been opened at the east end of Alogopati (Bania) to facilitate communication with the local cattle farms.127 See e.g. Cantarelli 2008, p. 30.128 In his extensive overview of semi-nomadic pastoralism in mod-ern day Thessaly, Sivignon refers to the high country between Pharsala and Domokos as “a frequent wintering place”, 1975, p. 31; see also Georgiades 1894, p. 24. On the antiquity of pastoral practices in the area cf. the remarks by Cantarelli 2008, p. 30, who observes that the toponym Proerna—the city which once shared this mountainland with Pharsalus—may be etymologi-cally related to the word for ‘small animal’ (with reference to Chantraine 1968, p. 374 s.v. ernos. Although this root has more applications in the vegetal world, its less widespread use in ref-erence to horned animals fits well with Cantarelli’s point). 129 Barnett 2007, p. 7 (elaborating on Horden and Purcell 2000). the city to the mountain and vice versa; other common activities, such as hunting, also reinforced this link.The apparent contradictions inherent to the cultural construction of the ‘wilderness’ are best captured, per-haps, by the contrasting answers one gets from Greek vil-lagers today when inquiring about certain parts of their countryside.130 I cannot even recount the times that, having asked for directions to some mountain site, I was told in return, ti psachneis? den yparchei tipota ekei pano (‘What are you looking for? There is nothing up there’). The lack of sightseeing opportunities perceived as worthy of a foreigner’s attention does not necessarily mean that the ‘wilderness’ is empty. Outside the small community of Neraida, in the eastern reaches of the Pharsalian terri-tory, I once asked an old lady walking a goat on a leash if the name of her village was related to that of the nearby mountain, the looming Neraiditis.131 No, was her reply, the name came from the Neraides (Water Nymphs) who used to live out there. When she was small she could still hear them at night dancing and playing their instruments, the klarino (clarinet) and the tampourlo (drum).132 Eventually, she concluded, the evils of modern life had driven them away. Having taken a few seconds to readjust to the reality of this conversation, my assistant and I then asked the old lady where she thought the Neraides could be found now. By then, however, our interlocutor had shifted to the more customary response pattern, den yparchoun. As it turned out, our investigation of Thessalian Nymph lore was to last much longer, leading us eventually to the cave site which is the focus of the second part of this book.130 Unpredictable as the results of such conversations usually are, “we all know the strategic importance of the village coffee shop for the surveyor!” (Decourt 1990, p. 24).131 Neraiditis or Meraditis: Philippson 1950, pp. 172; 174. Neraida, for-mer Anabakli, is a village of 140 inhabitants (data EL.STAT. 2011) on the north foot of the mountain.132 Music making and all-night dancing are traditional activities of the Neraides; see e.g. the analogous narratives collected by the Blums during the 1960’ (1970, p. 114, nos. 73–74, also featur-ing drums; 116, no. 82; 118, no. 88).

The elongated mass of the Karapla appears to the southwest as one leaves the Pharsala city limits driving past the hillock of Gyphtovrysi [Fig. 3].Here the road goes over a small tributary of the Apidanus which flows from the highlands south of town. Rising in the vicinity of Rizi, this stream enters the plain after form-ing an ample bend around the foot of Gyphtovrysi. In its mid-course it runs through the plane-shaded district of Chaïdaria, after which it takes the name of Chaïdarorema [Fig. 3].The cave comes into full view near the junction with the Stavros road. An isolated cluster of trees near the top of the hill betrays the presence of underground water in this spot, marking out the position of the site on a hillside otherwise devoid of any significant vegetation [Fig. 4].1 The same source appears to feed also a seasonal stream flowing approximately 150 m northeast of the cave. This small watercourse, which descends to the plain near the intersection of E65 with the road to Rizi,2 is responsible for the other concentrations of trees in the farmland between the plain and the hill. On the north shoulder of E65, opposite the Rizi intersection, is also a fountain shaded by a single plane tree.31 Cf. Heuzey 1886, p. 134. These underground waters are likely to be responsible for another tree-shaded spot at the foot of the hill, ca. 420 m below the site of our cave. The area, now occupied by a water trough and artificial irrigation works, belongs to a farming estate which stands at the west end of the Mavrochoma. On the hydrology of the district see pp. 12–13 above.2 On the route from Pharsala to Domokos, at 18 minutes from Pharsala Gell notes “A river, and a road from l(eft)” (1827, p. 286).3 A fountain is recorded by Gell, albeit on the left side of the road, just before the ascent to the pass of Steni (1827, p. 286. On Steni, see p. 5 above). This is most probably the same as the “good spring” which, according to Murray’s Handbook for Travellers in Greece, lies ca. 25 minutes east of the same pass, and “the copious spring”, named Gouyáva, which the 1894 Baedeker guide to Greece places half an hour west of Pharsala. See Murray 1900, Route 11 (Lamia to Pharsala), col. 758; Baedeker 1894, p. 229. At the same distance from To reach the base of the Karapla one must turn left at the fountain and drive in the direction of Rizi for a little over a half km. At the third roadbend it is then necessary to continue on foot through the fields of the Mavrochoma up to a dirt path which begins at the bottom of the hill (marked on the HMGS General Use Map as a ‘passable mule track’, evvatos imioniki odos) [Plate III]. From an ini-tial elevation of 268 m this path climbs up to 350 m, end-ing immediately west of the cave in the belt of scrubland which girdles the upper part of the Karapla. Gorse and prickly oak dominate the scenery, with wild pears, net-tles, and Christ’s thorns rising occasionally in their midst. The path lies inside a gully that runs through the Karapla crosswise, fanning out in two separate branches near the junction with the Mavrochoma4 [Plates III–V; Fig. 4].Near the top of the hill the incline rises sharply, as the main path disintegrates into a number of minor trails.5 Scattered over the hillside we observe a considerable num-ber of large rocks which were detached from the limestone walls of the summit—another reminder of the effects of erosion on this landscape.6 The increased presence of water in the ground is also indicated by a noticeable tran-town Dodwell reports “some ancient foundations near a stream and a fountain”, 1819, p. 121. 4 The gully already appears in a watercolor by H. Daumet dated to 1861–1863 [Plate V]. The rocky walls of the cave—then still unknown to the academic world—are clearly visible above the word emplace-ment. As shown by this painting, the landscape of the Karapla hill has not changed much from the 19th century.5 The HMGS General Use Map [Plate III] shows the path as continu-ing on to a location at the west end of the ridge, where E65 begins its descent to the great Karditsa basin after crossing the Steni pass. From this point another trail (which I did not have the opportunity to inspect) is shown to climb up the south side of the Karapla in an easterly direction. 6 According to the locals I have spoken to, many of the fallen rocks visible today on Pharsalian hillslopes are a result of the infamous earthquake of April 30, 1954, the most powerful seismic episode ever recorded in the region (Papastamatiou and Mouyiaris 1986; Papazachos 1997, p. 277). It should be noted that at the Karapla the detachment of large fragments from the cliff wall appears to have begun earlier than the mid-twentieth century; see the photographs Archivio Fotografico della Scuola Archeologica Italiana, negativi 324, 327 (= Levi 1923–1924, p. 28, figs. 2, 1), and 326 (unpublished)."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Site19intervention (a change in the soil level of this specific area appears to have occurred during or immediately after the Italian excavations of 1922).11 As the collapsed rocks scat-tered over the hillside also remind us, additional shifting was probably caused by the dramatic seismic events of the mid 1950’s (cf. note 6 above).On both sides of the stairway are inscriptions carved respectively into the north and east faces of the cliff (below, Chapter 4). The inscription facing north (Inscription II: Plate VI: 3; Figs. 46–47) stands at eye level on a large, flat-surfaced rock projecting beside the stairs to the right of the waterfall. The writing on it is weathered and barely visible today to the naked eye. The inscription facing west (Inscription I: Plate VI: 4; Figs. 44–45) is located higher up, above the second step of the stairway, on the wall that rises left of this structure. Despite its elevated position it is clearly distinguishable from ground level [Fig. 13] and in a much better state of preservation than the lower text.Except for the features described above, the lower level of the sanctuary does not present any other rock-carvings or visible alterations. The eroded walls of the cliff are scarred with a large number of holes and crevices of which some, suggestively geometric in shape, could be perfora-tions for the hanging of votives (cf. Chapter 4.3 Cat. nos. 2a, 26 below). However, none bear traces of rust or metal residue that would allow for a positive identification.1.3 The Site (Upper Level)At the top of the stairway is a trapezoid-shaped landing enclosed on all sides except the front [Plate VI: 5; Figs. 16, 20, 25–26].12 Its measurements are approximately 6 × 3 m. The east end of the landing has been rounded into a shal-low apse [Fig. 21] with carefully smoothed walls [Fig. 23], approximately 1,30–1,40 m in diameter. Within this alcove, resting on a stepped area hewn in the floor of the landing, is a tall rocky outcrop with a squared top [Plate VI: 6; Figs. 20–21].13 The approximate height of the outcrop is 1,50 m; 11 A photograph of the stairway taken at the time of the excavation (Archivio Fotografico della Scuola Archeologica Italiana, nega-tivo 324 = Levi 1923–1924, p. 28, fig. 2) shows the first step barely emerging above ground. Writing in the late 1930’s Peek found the ascent difficult enough to postulate damage in the lower steps of the structure (1938, p. 19). 12 Brief descriptions also in Levi 1923–1924, p. 30; Peek 1938, p. 19.13 Cf. Peek 1938, p. 19; Riethmüller 2001, II, p. 294. Neither this rock formation nor the apsidal recess behind it are discussed by Levi, although both appear in the map included with his excavation report (1923–1924, p. 31, fig. 6). Both structures are also carefully recorded in an unpublished photograph at the SAIA archives, showing that the Italian archaeologist had been aware of them sition in the vegetation, which changes from low scrub to thick shrubbery and small to mid-size trees [Figs. 4, 6, 12]. The total walking time from the city to this area, across a distance of ca. 4 km, is approximately 1 hour.71.2 The Site (Lower Level)At the end of the ascent, the dirt gives way to exposed limestone, with high cliff walls rising vertically from the ground. Here, where the slope forms a sort of natural embankment abutting the base of the precipice [Fig. 12],8 the cliff bends inwards, framing a patch of land large enough for a dozen people to gather on it [Plate VI: 1; Figs. 9, 13]. Fallen rocks and prickly oak cover a large por-tion of the grounds, interspersed with elms and wild figs [Figs. 12, 15–16]. At the back of this natural cove, between the east wall of the cliff and a small dried up waterfall,9 are a series of rocky projections which form the steps of a rudimentary stairway [Plate VI: 2; Figs. 13–15, 17–19].10 As the variation in their size and shape suggests, these stairs were hewn in the cliffside following the natural contours of the surface. This is especially evident in the lower part of the stairway, which appears like an uneven assem-blage of boulders flattened on top. Halfway up, where it runs into a particularly rough patch of rock, the stairway continues round the obstacle with a series of smaller, better-formed steps carved closer to the wall [Figs. 17–19]. Damage occurred at the top, where the last step is broken [Figs. 17–18], and at the bottom, where the extant steps seem too far apart from one other [Fig. 14]. The first step is also set at an impossible height [Fig. 13], showing that the ground surface has lowered considerably since the stairs were built. This is due partly to erosion, partly to human On the seismic history of the region: p. 5, note 10 above; Stiros and Papageorgiou 1994, pp. 29–31; Caputo and Helly 2005, pp. 215–216. 7 Time and distance were calculated taking as a starting point the west gate in the old city wall. 8 “A roughly quadrangular terrace, ample, but with a strong incline” Levi 1923–1924, p. 30. Based on this account and the accompanying photograph (p. 28, fig. 1), we must conclude that since the time of the excavation erosion has affected both size and shape of the area. 9 ‘Waterfall’ is admittedly too grand a term for what can be better described as a dank rocky recess covered by moss (partly visible in Fig. 17, upper left). There is no doubt however that in times preceding the foundation of the sanctuary a continuous flow of water sculpted the rocks in this area into the shape that they are now.10 “Six rock-cut steps or climbing holds of variable height”, Peek 1938, p. 19.

Behind it, the corresponding section of the cliff wall has been dug out in the shape of a semicir-cular niche [Figs. 22–24].15 The approximate height of this recess is 0,80 m; its diameter 0,70 m. Immediately to the left, lodged in a large crack in the wall of the cliff, is a trian-gular shelf with a round depression on top [Fig. 24, left].16The entrance to the cave is at the other end of the landing, about 4 m to the right of the area described above [Figs. 26, left]. Here the stone floor shows a more pronounced slope as well as a brittler consistency due to sheet erosion.17 Resting against the west wall of the cliff is a rectangular rock formation which resembles a bench or low dais [Plate VI: 7; Figs. 25–26]. It is freestanding on all sides except the back, where it joins the rear wall of the forecourt with a short left return. Like most of the sur-rounding limestone (e.g. the section of cliff wall in Fig. 10), it shows a characteristically laminate texture. Its approxi-mate measurements are 2,00 (l.) × 0,87 (w.) × 0,74 (h.).Left of the bench-like formation, a fissure in the cliff leads to a roofless vestibule connecting the landing to the cave [Plate VI: 8; Figs. 11; 27–28].18 Upon entering this space one steps into the mouth of an ancient streambed carved into the limestone floor [Fig. 28].19 The bottom of it is lined with a sediment of reddish-brown dirt mixed with small stones. Discoloration marks observed at about waist height on the vestibule’s left wall show, however, that a much larger body of water originally flowed inside (Archivio Fotografico della Scuola Archeologica Italiana, nega-tivo B 329). 14 The stepped area in this part of the landing has been hitherto unnoticed by scholars. The upper step of the structure is visible in the unpublished photograph cited at note 13 above.15 Peek 1938, p. 19; Riethmüller 2001, II, p. 294. Not mentioned by Levi.16 A detailed description of this feature, inclusive of measure-ments, is given by Peek 1938, p. 19. Except for Peek, none of the other authors make any mention of the triangular shelf.17 This strip of crumbling limestone marks the path of the water that washed across the ledge to form the waterfall on the right side of the stairway (p. 19 above). 18 Most scholars do not differentiate between this space and the corridor of the cave proper. Levi correctly notes the vestibular character of the area but omits to report the absence of a roof (1923–1924, p. 30). The sunlight filtering from this overhead opening reaches almost to the upper end of the corridor, giving the interior of the cave a pleasantly bright appearance throught the greater part of the day.19 Levi 1923–1924, p. 32.

Where this mass of streaming water made two sharp returns to the east, the vestibule’s walls are moulded into a double apsed shape [Plate VI: 8–9; Fig. 28].20 The effects of erosion are also visible at the west end of the room, where water has excavated a small sec-ondary channel alongside the right wall [Fig. 29].The cave itself consists of a long vaulted corridor that bores into the cliff at an upward angle [Figs. 32–33, 38]. The corridor has a north-south direction and is laid out on a straight line except at the end, where it veers to the east21 forming a small secondary chamber [Plate VI: 10–11]. At the entrance its height is ca. 9 m, dropping gradually to 3.50 m as one moves deeper into the cave. Its total length, excluding the secondary chamber, is a little over 20 m.22 The secondary chamber is a small elliptical room of 3,90 m (l.) × 3,26 m (h.), accessible through a low round opening [Fig. 41]. It is linked to the main corridor by an elbow-shaped, equally low passage23 whose flat ceiling contrasts with the sharp vaulting observed in the rest of the cave [Fig. 40]. Its measurements are 1,30 m (w.) × 1,70 (h.). Two more openings, which are better described as clefts in the rock than real rooms, are also visible on the cor-ridor’s west wall. One is found in the upper end of the cave, to the right of the elbow-shaped passage [Plate VI: 9c; Figs. 38–39]. It is a natural closet of 0,60 m (w.) × 2,00 m (h.) × 2,6 m (d.), with a shape vaguely reminescent of a Russian church dome. The other occurs in the vestibule down below [Plate VI: 9; Fig. 30]. Much less spacious than the first, it is just a tall gash in the wall. Its measurements are 0,50 m (w.) × 3,50 m (h.) × 1,10 m (d.)Inside the secondary chamber are a tall cave pillar, or stalagnate [Fig. 42], and a bench-like formation under a rocky shelf [Fig. 43].24 Except for these, the site is other-wise devoid of speleothems or any other natural char-acteristics of note. The most remarkable feature is the narrow, winding streambed that water has excavated into the cave’s floor. This channel begins at the back of the corridor, where the stream flowed out of two clefts in 20 On the distinctive configuration of this part of the wall see also Levi 1923–1924, p. 30.21 Not to the west, as erroneously shown in Levi’s otherwise very reliable map (1923–1924, p. 31, fig. 6). The same error in orienta-tion appears in Peek’s account (1938, p. 19).22 Cf. Levi 1923–1924, p. 30. Decourt computes the total length of the cave, inclusive of the secondary chamber, to about 25 m (commentary to IThess I, 73, p. 88). 23 Peek inaccurately refers to this passage as the innermost part of the cave, estimating its width to be less than 1 m (1938, p. 19: see also note 21 above).24 The bench is itself the result of a small cave pillar spreading out at the base."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Site21the threshold of the secondary chamber. After washing down the elbow-shaped passage, the water dropped into the channel forming a small waterfall in an area where the rock still shows a particularly polished surface [Plate VI: 9b; Fig. 37]. From here it followed the natural slope of the floor, descending to the entrance in a series of irregularly spaced bends [Figs. 34–37]. From start to end one counts a total of nine turns, R-L-R-L-R-R-L-R-L. The average width is ca. 0,50 m (with variations up to 1 m near the entrance and down to 0,22 m in the upper part of the cave).2 Interpretation2.1 ApproachGoatherd, on turning the corner of that path where the oaks are, thou shalt find . . .Theocritus, Epigrams (transl. Paton)The approach to the cave described in section 1.1 above takes as a reference E65, the National Road that skirts the Karapla to the north. It is one of many approaches that are possible from this direction, since the visitor can leave the road virtually at any point and begin the ascent through the cultivated fields. From the hillock of Gyphtovrysi to the pass of Steni the cave is always in clear view of anyone travelling on E65. Thanks to the amphitheatrical shape of the region (p. 5 above), a simi-larly unencumbered view offers itself to those travelling through the highlands south of town, especially from the valley of the Chäidarorema. In antiquity the Karapla and the reliefs of the Alogopati mountainland were encircled by two routes which departed from the west side of town, linking Pharsalus to Proerna, Thaumakoi, and the territo-ries of the south (p. 5 above). One of these was the main roadway which, as we have seen, originated at the sources of the Apidanus following approximately the same path as the old ethniki odos. The other was more of a local route which bisected the Rizi plateau in the direction of the Narthacium ridge. Both routes afforded an easy access to the cave through an energetic scramble on the slopes of the Karapla, for we may assume that in antiquity, just as today, a variety of minor trails must have scored the sides of this hill, connecting the open countryside between the two roads.25 As anyone who has ever asked a Greek 25 If the presence of a spring was the primary factor in the develop-ment of the Karapla cult, proximity to these two routes linking Pharsalus with its outer territory is also likely to have played a role: “Both roads and fountains have strong connections with shepherd for directions is aware, such monopatia, or ‘one-person tracks’, are often invisible to the uninitiated. Less clear is the situation at the south end of the area, where the Alogopati reliefs subside into the valley of the Vrysias. Here, in the rugged borderland that divided Pharsalus from Proerna, there are no records of ancient routes or other topographical features that can provide a point of reference. Inconvenient for travellers (who would have had to stray far from the main road without having the site in their view), the southern approach to the cave was still viable for other users of the Greek countryside, such as herdsmen, woodcutters, and hunters.2.2 The Sacred GardenI have a garden which I cultivated with the toil of my own hands . . . if you were to remove the fence around it, you would think that you were looking at a sacred grove.Longus, Daphnis and ChloeBoth inscriptions found at the Karapla cave (Chapter 4 below) attest to the existence of a cultivated area in the sanctuary. Inscription I hints at the early dedication of a laurel tree (line 4). Inscription II refers instead to a plu-rality of plantings (lines 9 and 12), indicating that a fully established garden or grove26 must have existed by the time this text was engraved. As with the majority of such installations, Pantalces’ garden cannot be traced archaeologically;27 we can only surmise about its nature acts of foundation, with the first transformation of an unin-habited landscape into one of human habitation and culture”, Mili 2015, p. 43. As the same author notes, roads and springs are characteristically prominent features of the Thessalian religious landscape.26 In the opening paragraph the term “cultivated area” is more faithful to the epigraphical text, which never specifies whether Pantalces planted a garden (kêpos) or a grove (alsos). The pref-erence given to ‘garden’ in this study is based on comparison with Archedamus’ analogous foundation at Vari; cf. IG I3, 977. As scholars have pointed out, a clear distinction between garden and grove is not always possible; see Birge 1982, p. 1; Bonnechere 2007, pp. 17–19. For an overview of the word kêpos and its application to different forms of planted land, see also Carroll-Spillecke 1989, pp. 11–12. 27 As Bonnechere puts it, “the physical garden remains one of the great unknowns of Greek civilization” (2001, p. 31–32). On the difficulties in studying Greek gardens see also Carroll-Spillecke 1989, pp. 11–12, cf. 79; Osborne 1992, pp. 373–374. The most cur-rent overview on the topic is that by Carroll-Spillecke 1989, who provides a convenient tabulation of all extant literary, epigraphi-cal and archaeological evidence (pp. 89–94, tables A-E). Similar"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"chapter 222on the basis of external evidence and what little informa-tion can be gleaned from Inscriptions I–II.Based on the language of Inscription II (Chapter 4.2.4 below, commentary to line 2) the cultivated plot must have been physically close to this text, i.e. in the patch of level ground which lies directly below the cave at the base of the cliff. Although the term ‘terrace’ is often used in the scholarly publications,28 there is no evidence for terrac-ing in this spot or elsewhere in the surroundings. Given the highly eroded conditions of the hill and the recent tectonic history of the region, one is justified in assuming that a fair amount of soil loss has occurred. Size and shape of the ancient ‘terrace’ are thus difficult to estimate, as are the boundaries of the precinct proper,29 but it is clear that unlike other parts of the site, the grounds below the cave could admit more than a handful visitors at once.At the Karapla cave, native vegetation (line 9, emphuta) and cultivated plants (line 12, taut’ ephuteuse) co-existed under the energetic care of Pantalces. As Inscription II makes clear, this balanced landscape was not mantained without effort. The reference to the gardener’s labors in line 12, while consistent with the conventions of the epi-grammatic genre (commentary to Inscription II, line 12 below), has also a basis in reality. Just keeping the area clear of fallen rocks and encroaching scrub must have required, in itself, a considerable amount of time and effort. The presence of a spring inside the cave, while essential for the health of Pantalces’ plants, must have also favored, as it still does now, the spread of stinging nettle and other undesirable seasonal weeds.The analysis of the soil can help us form an idea of what Pantalces’ garden might have looked like. From a pedological point of view the Karapla can be assigned to the category of Entisols called Orthents, shallow rocky problems also hinder research on sacred groves, on which see the in-depth study by Birge 1982 and the more recent discus-sions by Bonnechere 2007 and Sporn 2010, pp. 554–555. Physical evidence for the planting of sacred trees has been recovered at the sanctuary of Zeus of Nemea (Birge, Kraynak, and Miller 1992, pp. 85–98 = Birge 1982, pp. 86–93) where the existence of a sacred grove is confirmed by Paus. 2, 15, 2–3 and other sources; at the Hephaestaeum in Athens (Thompson 1937, pp. 396–425 = Birge 1982, pp. 64–72), the Asclepieum in Corinth (Roebuck 1951, pp. 40–42 = Birge 1982, pp. 72–78), and the sanctuary of Apollo Hylates at Kourion (Scranton 1967 = Birge 1982, pp. 78–86).28 Cf. Levi 1923–1924, p. 30 (note 8 above), where a natural terrace is intended. For an overview of terracing practices in Greece: Foxhall 1996, pp. 44–67; Grove and Rackham 2001, pp. 112–113.

Rich in calcium, soils formed over limestone and serpentine foundations are basic in pH and therefore toxic to most plants, save for the hardy, adaptable undershrubs found in garrigue and phrygana biomes. There are no reasons to believe that the Karapla’s soil chemistry and geomor-phology have undergone any drastic change over the last three thousand years: the most significant erosional activity in Greece dates to the Pleistocene or earlier, “long before any human impact on the land” (Rackham 1990, p. 110).31 Likewise, botanists agree that the main changes in the natural vegetation of Greece—namely the transi-tion from aboriginal woodland to the widespread steppe and maquis mosaic we see today—occurred in the early Holocene, between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age.32 If so, it is fair to assume that in Pantalces’ time the hill was mantled by a maquis and phryganic vegetation very similar to the one growing there now. The laurel men-tioned in line 4 of Inscription I certainly fits a maquis context. We can imagine this vegetation as a discontinu-ous cover of ligneous scrub, punctuated here and there by small trees or tree-stands. Thick cushions of thorny bush would enmesh with aromatic and medicinal plants to form a scented mosaic of muted greens and browns. In spring and summer, this mosaic would come ablaze 30 USDA, Soil Taxonomy, p. 420–443. On the soils of ancient Greece and their possible religious associations see Retallack 2008 (especially p. 642 on Orthents). On paleopedology and the study of ancient soils in general, see the 1990 book-length study by the same author.31 Contemporary with the last glaciation in Northern Europe, this “gigantic phase of erosion” (Rackham 1982, p. 195) is responsible for the alluvial formation known in Greek geology as ‘Older Fill’. Lesser erosional periods, of a more localized nature, occurred in Classical times producing deposits designated as ‘Younger Fill’. It is worth-noting that, especially in the case of the ‘Old Fill’, climate is proven to have played a much bigger role than ‘defor-estation’ or other forms of human land exploitation. On the allu-viation cycle, according to the model developed by C. Vita-Finzi, see the main study by the same, 1969, and the studies by Bintliff, especially 1975 and 1992.32 Rackham 1990, p. 101.

We can expect spurges and brooms to have dominated the color palette of this landscape as they do now. The scent would have been a blend of thymes, sages, and mints. Theophrastus confirms that most shrubs and herbaceous plants growing on the Karapla today were known in his time and that several were raised in gardens on account of their colors and fragrance.33 Among these we find plants with specific ties to the Nymphs, like violet (Viola odorata) and tufted thyme (Thymus serpyllum),34 as well as many other flowers and herbs traditionally used for wreath-making and the decoration of shrines, such as aster (Aster amellus), rose campion (Lychnis coronaria), chrysanthemum, (Chrysanthemum coronarium), cala-mint (Calamintha incana), and wild marjoram (Origanum majorana).35 Ultimately, Pantalces and all later care takers of the cave had a wealth of options to choose from, if they wanted to ensure a steady rotation of greenery and blooms at the Karapla shrine.As far as we can reconstruct them from the literary texts, three features were considered desirable in a place planted for the gods: running water, shade, and pleasant vegetation.36 Vegetation refreshed the air and provided aesthetic effect. The geographer Pausanias praises the sacred grove of Apollo at Gryneum for its rich assortment of trees, which included both fruit-bearing and decorative varieties:. . . a most beautiful grove . . . with cultivated trees, and all those which, although they bear no fruit, are pleasing to smell or look upon (1, 21, 7 transl. Jones).As Pausanias makes clear, fruitless trees (akarpa) could still be appreciated for their aesthetic value, based on the visual and olphactory delight they could provide.37 33 HP 6, 6–8.

On the role of the natural land-scape in the Greek perception of sacred space: Brulé 2012.37 Cf. Diodorus of Sicily 5, 42 on the woods surrounding the sanctu-ary of Zeus Triphylius. Indeed, as a natural refuge for birds, the trees of a pleas-antly wooded place would not only be appealing to the senses of sight and smell, but that of hearing as well. The legendary grove of the Nysean Nymphs, in Diodorus of Sicily’s Library, may be cited as an idealized version of such environments:Further in there is a cave, circular in shape and of marvellous size and beauty. [. . .] Before the entrance grow marvellous trees, some fruit-bearing, others evergreen, and all of them fashioned by nature for no other end than to delight the eye; and in them nest every kind of bird of pleasing colour and most charming song. Consequently the whole place is meet for a god, not merely in its aspect but in its sound as well (3, 69, 1–2 transl. Oldfather).In addition to this fundamental aesthetic function, the trees and shrubs of a sacred grove had a variety of cultic uses. Both were a handy source for traditional offerings such as fruits and flowers and supplied the primary mate-rial for the wreaths used in the ritual; trees also functioned as stands for the hanging of votive gifts.38As we saw, to fashion a garden that could grow in the thin, alkaline soil of the Karapla, Pantalces had to rely on the hill’s native flora.39 He would have been motivated to do so not only by soil chemistry,40 but also religious rea-sons—namely the need to please the resident deities with the flowers of their own domain.41 Fortunately the local phryganic vegetation supplied enough blooms to satisfy both divine residents and human visitors with all kinds of visual and olphactory delights. Much more problem-atic, in a phryganic setting, would have been the matter of shade and of the leafy trees that could provide it. Broad-leaved trees like planes or thickly crowned trees like 38 Fruit and flower offerings: notes 47, 49 below. Wreaths: notes 34–35 above.

Nat. 16, 59; cf. Thphr. HP 4, 5, 3), religious motivation and hard labor are not enough for cultivating plants outside their habitat.40 On the edaphological knowledge of the ancient Greeks see Bech i Borràs and Gadea Buisán 1999. 41 The natural domain of a deity could be seen metaphorically as his/her garden; see e.g. Dionysus’ cave at Brasiae, in Laconia, where the surrounding plain is referred to as the god’s kêpos, Paus. 3, 24, 4–5."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"chapter 224oaks are not a common occurence in maquis and phry-gana environments. It is no surprise, then, that Pantalces would have chosen laurel as his first planting. Besides its aromatic qualities, laurel has thick, plentiful foliage that can efficiently block the harsh sunlight bouncing off the Karapla’s limestones. The sheltering properties of the lau-rel are exemplified in one of the earliest cave representa-tions in literary history, Od. 9, 182–183, where the Cyclops’ hole is described as a high cave “roofed over with laurels” (daphnêisi katerêphes).Yet what really made a difference in the creation of the Karapla garden was the immanent presence of the Nymphs themselves, in the form of the life-giving water which issued from the rocky depth of the hill and encour-aged the growth of large size plants that otherwise would not have been as readily available in traditional maquis and phrygana conditions. Today, conspicuous amidst a copse of slender elms, a small community of wild figs spread their branches over the sanctuary’s terrace and stairway [Figs. 15–16], casting a thick shade on the cave entrance.42 Their presence on the naked hillcrest of the Karapla is so distinctive that the entire district has been renamed Sykies, ‘Fig Trees’, after them.43 First mentioned by Levi in 1923, their existence goes back to an early date, apparently predating most of the current vegetation at the site.44 How far back, one wonders45? One of the ear-liest attested fruit plants in the Mediterranean,46 the fig 42 To some extent it is possible to retrace the growth of this group of plants from the scholarly publications: see e.g. how Levi’s “small caprifigs” (1923–1924, p. 30) become, in Decourt’s descrip-tion of the early 1990’s, “a magnificent fig tree” (commentary to IThess I, 72, p. 90). 43 Unlike ancient Greek, which differentiates between the domes-tic fig tree, sukê, and its wild relative, erineos, modern Greek uses the same word, sykia, for both varieties. 44 Except for a few references to shrubbery (1923–1924, pp. 28–29 and 32) Levi does not report any vegetation worth of note on the Karapla. The photos taken during the excavations of summer 1922 show indeed a hillside much more arid and devoid of trees than today; see Archivio Fotografico della Scuola Archeologica Italiana, negativi 326, 328; cf. also a 1932 view of the reliefs south-west of Pharsala in Gountoulas and Zacharis 2009, pp. 78–79. Preserved in these documents is a sample of that landscape sometimes referred to as the ‘Greece of Yesterday’ (i.e. Greece before the economic changes of the last thirty years; see Rackham 1990, pp. 87–92; 101–111).45 Writing in the early twentieth century, Weller reports the pres-ence of a fig tree at the Vari cave which had endured at the site for nearly two hundred years (1903, p. 265). 46 Figs were gathered from the wild since the eighth millennium (Dalby 2003, p. 143; see also Zohary and Hopf 2000, map 16). In Thessaly the archaeological evidence for fig consumption dates has symbolic and religious connotations that are appro-priate to the garden of a rustic shrine. Its uses in cult are widely attested throughout the Graeco-Roman world and beyond.47 In myth it is linked to the domain of the Nymphs through one of the Hamadryads, Syce, the epony-mous Nymph of the fig tree (cf. Ath. Deipn. 3, 14).Another fruit-bearing tree that we see on the Karapla today is the ubiquitous gortza48 or wild pear of the Greek countryside—Theophrastus’ achras—attested in the vari-eties Pyrus amygdaliformis and Pyrus pyraster. Like the fig, this plant has ancient religious associations which make it a likely choice for the garden of a cave sanctu-ary.49 An important source of food and timber since the Stone Age,50 the wild pear is often identified in literature with the economy of pre-agrarian or marginal cultures.51 back to the Neolithic (fig pips from Argissa and Sesklo: Kroll 1981, pp. 100; 101 table 1; Zohary and Hopf 2000, p. 163; Megaloudi 2006, p. 65). On the associations of the fig tree with the country-side see e.g. Hsch. s.v. kradophagos: “a fig eater; a dried fig eater. Also used to indicate a rustic (agroikos)”; on its associations with country worship in particular, AP 6, 42; 16, 240–241.47 See the ample body of evidence collected by F. Olck under the heading ‘Sakrale’ in RE VI (1909) cols. 2148–2149, XIX, s.v. ‘Feige’ (also Boetticher 1856, pp. 437–440 et pass. Murr 1890, pp. 31–35 et pass; Megaloudi 2006, p. 66) Fig trees appear in a variety of cultic functions: they provide wood for cult images, branches for pro-cessions, or fruit for food offerings; they also function as stands for the hanging of votives, religious implements, and parts of sacrificial victims (contact with a fig tree was believed to have a tenderizing effect on the meat, Plu. Quaes.Conv. 696e–697a). In Men. Dysc. 393–396, set at the nymphaeum of Phyle, a fig tree on the way to the cave is at the center of a humorous episode with an uncooperative sacrificial sheep.

Like ancient Greek achras, the modern folk name seems to encompass both amygdaliformis and pyraster subspecies of Pyrus (Polunin 1980, nos. 464–464b). Theophrastus differenti-ates between an achras that grows on the mountains, spiny and small (P. pyraster?), from one growing in the plains (P. amygdali-formis?), HP 3, 3, 2. 49 In the AP wild pears are attested in connection to wreath mak-ing (4, 1) and fruit offerings (6, 316), or as stands for the hanging of votives (6, 255).50 Wild pears were collected in Greece as early as the Upper Paleolithic (Franchthi cave, Hansen 1991, pp. 68–69, figs. 30 b–c, plate 12, et pass. See also Megaloudi 2006, p. 63). In Thessaly the archeological evidence for pear trees dates to the Early Bronze Age (specimens from Argissa and Pefkakia: one plant of the Pyrus species, Kroll 1981, p. 101, table 1). 51 Like the acorn, the wild pear was stereotypically associated with the diet of ‘primitive’ peoples, usually mountainfolk; see e.g. Plu. Quaest. Gr. 51, and, for the parallel with acorns, Ael.

On the other hand, the same sources also indicate that this tree could be domesti-cated by grafting,53 thus allowing for that combination of wild and tame elements which Greeks found so desirable in a grove.To the trees considered thus far we may add two other members of the Karapla’s modern day flora, both species of the Ulmaceae family, that would have been most at home in a rural sanctuary. One is the phtelia or common elm (ancient ptelea),54 the tree that now grows in a clus-ter of twenty or so specimens in the terrace underneath the cave [Fig. 12]. The other is the melikoukia or European hackberry (ancient lôtos),55 found in the lower periph-ery of the sanctuary. Elms share the same rich cultural ancestry as figs and pears, appearing in Greek mythol-ogy and cult from an early date.56 Like the fig tree, they have close ties to the world of the Nymphs through one of the Hamadryads, Ptelea.57 They also occupy a place in Thessalian tradition, as attested by the tale of Erysichthon and his defilement of Demeter’s alsos in the Dotium plain (where elms grew together with pear trees),58 and the existence of a Bronze Age center in Achaia named 52 Wild pears are generally portrayed as growing in the rough country at the far edges of the cultivated land (e.g. AP 9, 4, 3), a depiction true to this plant’s real life habits, but their use in orchards is also attested (Longus 2, 3, 4; see citation p. 26 below. Aristotle also recommends the planting of wild pears in proxim-ity to beehives, HA 627b).53 AP 9, 5; see also 4; 6.

Hopkinson’s commentary to the same text stresses the literary nature of Callimachus’ description, 1984, pp. 102–103. Elms and wild pears occur together in Menander’s Hero, set in the rural deme of Pteleon, the ‘Elm Grove’.59 Hackberries are, likewise, an ancient presence in the Mediterranean.60 Their fruit (a bean-size, sugary drupe often confused with the similarly named fruit of the Homeric Lotus-Eaters) was collected by the Prehistoric inhabitants of Greece as far back as the Lower Mesolithic period.61 In historical times, their wood was used for the carving of religious images, the construction of temple buildings, and the making of wind instruments.62The list of trees discussed above is one of various arbo-real combinations that could have been found at the Karapla shrine. In absence of palynological data or other concrete evidence it is impossible to be specific. As far as hypothetical restorations go, it is not an unreasonable one: figs and pears grow spontaneously in close proximity and they can both be cultivated in situ without much man-tainance; with the olive, they make a group of three plants commonly adapted for cultivation from the wild.63 Elms occur also in the company of pears and other fruit trees, as in the examples cited above, or in Vergil’s Georgics, where they are planted in rows for hedging.64 Given its modest Ptelea in Attica (fr. 1, 3 Sandbach; see Capps 1910, p. 5; Gomme and Sandbach 1973, pp. 385; 389).59 IG IX 2, 520, lines 3–4; Plin.

Hackberry was also a staple food of the first agrarian cultures in the Fertile Crescent. Remarkably large quantities of Celtis tournefortii fruit stones appear in the archeobotanical record from the Early Neolithic settlement of Asikli Höyük, Central Anatolia, point-ing to “the substantial collection of these fruits”, Woldring and Cappers 2001, p. 8: see van Zeist and de Roller 1995, pp. 183–184, tables 2–3. Similarly, appreciable numbers of Celtis australis stones have been excavated at Çatal Hüyük, Helbaek 1964, p. 123. The honey-like taste of the Celtis drupe (emphasized in the Modern Greek name, melikoukia) has encouraged identification with the lôtos of Homeric fame (lôtoio . . . meliêdea karpon, Od. 9, 94; the latter, however, has a better match in the so-called Jew’s thorn, Zizyphus lotus; see discussion in Dalby 2003, p. 20).62 Pausanias cites hackberry among the woods used ‘in antiquity’ for the making of xoana, 8, 17, 2; on this tree as a preferred mate-rial for sculpture see also Thphr. HP 5, 3, 7. Hackberry appears with elm and boxwood in the building accounts of the temple of Asclepius at Epidaurus; see IG IV2 1, 102, 44–45 and the relevant comments by Meiggs 1982, pp. 423–430.63 Plu.

No large trees are cited, from which we conclude that size was not as relevant to the making of an alsos as year-round foliage and blooms. The extent of the gardened plot does not seem to have mattered either. Philetas, as an old man, might not have been able to manage a large cultivation.If there is some basis for speculating on the plant vari-eties that once grew at the Karapla sanctuary, little or nothing can be said on the layout itself of the garden and the planting techniques used by Pantalces and his suc-cessors. In his report Levi does not include any data that could shed light in this regard: based on the information at hand, we must dismiss the possibility that any evidence for planting pits—whether dug in the bedrock, as seen at the Athenian Hephaesteum and the sanctuary of Apollo at Kourion, or in the soil, as at the sanctuary of Zeus at Nemea67—may have survived at the Karapla cave site. Yet Inscription II appears to imply a cultivation that would have left a more substantial trace of its existence. Similarly uncertain is the question of whether planting pots were used in the decoration of the sanctuary.68 In this instance, Levi reports the retrieval of a large amount of sherds which he assigns to pottery and rooftiles.69 Regrettably, since all the findings from Levi’s excavation have been lost or mis-placed (pp. xvi above; 36 below), these materials can no longer be re-examined to assess the use of potting vases.2.3 The StairwayOn a path that is steep and slippery, we climb by pushing our feet against a root or rock or a sod or into a rut. These footholds may develop into a pat-tern of rough steps.Templer, The StaircaseFurther information about the landscaping of the cave is given in lines 14–15 of Inscription II. The poem tells us how Pantalces, invigorated by Heracles, cut ‘a way up’ in the rocky flank of the Karapla,66 Cf. the “marvellous trees, some fruit-bearing (karpima), others evergreen (aeithalê)” growing in front of the Nymph cave at Nysa, D.S. 3, 69, 2: full citation at p. 23 above.67 See bibliography at note 27 above.68 On the use of planting pots in ancient gardening see e.g. Gleason 1994, pp. 16–17. 69 Levi 1923–1924, p. 32: See pp. 59 -60 and Chapter 3.3, Cat. no. 60 below.size, it would not be appropriate to compare Pantalces’ garden with the farming estates depicted by Vergil. Rather, if one had to visualize this site based on a literary exam-ple, a better comparandum would be Philetas’ garden in the passage from Longus inscribed at the beginning of this section. Longus’ text deserves to be quoted now in full:Children, I am old Philetas: many a time I have sung for the Nymphs here, played the pipes for Pan over there, and guided an entire herd of cows by music alone. I have come to tell you what I have seen and announce to you what I have heard. I have a garden (kêpos) which I cultivated with the toil of my own hands, ever since I became too old for shepherding. Whatever fruits and flowers each season brings, they are there: in spring, roses, lilies, hyacinths, and two kinds of violets: in summer, poppies, wild pears, and all types of apples: and now, in the autumn season, grapes, figs, pomegranates, and green myrtles. Every morning flocks of birds assemble in the garden, some to seek food, others to sing: for it is thickly shaded by trees, and watered by three fountains: if you were to remove the fence around it, you would think that you were looking at a sacred grove (alsos) (2, 3, 1–5).Philetas’ portrayal shares some notable similarities with that of Pantalces in Inscription II, such as the devotion for the Nymphs and singing skills which are common to both characters. The most obvious parallels, however, are noted in the wording used to describe their garden-ing activities (Chapter 4. 2 below, commentary to line 12). Clearly both Longus and the composer of the Karapla epigram are drawing from the same formulaic repertory to depict a similar theme, the planting and tending of a country garden. Unlike Pantalces’, Philetas’ is not a sacred garden but, as its creator makes a point to let everyone know, it could definitely pass as one. We may therefore rely on his description to understand what features made a rustic kêpos ‘look’ like an alsos—if not in actuality, at least in the projections and the desires that this literary tradition reflects. Besides the three essential elements of the locus amoenus65—running water, foliage, and shade, enriched by the presence of songbirds—particu-lar emphasis appears to placed on a well-planned sea-sonal rotation of fruits and blooms: regardless of the time of the year, Philetas’ garden is always a pleasant place to 65 On the natural characteristics that make up a locus amoenus see, in addition to the classical study by Curtius 1953, pp. 186–195, the bibliography cited by Hopkinson 1984, pp. 102–103, note 4."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The Site27Heracles gave him strength of will, heart, and body, with which he pounded these rocks and turned them into a way up.The reference is to a series of steps, crudely hewn in a recessed area of the cliff, which provide, still today, the only viable access to the cave. The irregularities in the shape and size of the steps, compounded with the effects of erosion, cause this structure to blend in with the natu-ral rock formations around it, disguising its man-made nature.70 Once all growth and detritus are removed, however, the layout of Pantalces’ ‘way up’ becomes apparent—a modified land stair delimited by the cliff wall on one side and the drop of an old waterfall on the other.71 To fashion it, Pantalces used a naturally stepped section of the slope which spreads out at the bottom in a series of massive projecting rocks. These he levelled with his tools, turning them into stair treads (an action effec-tively captured by the verse ‘he pounded these rocks and turned them into a way up’). Near the top, where the angle of the slope increases sharply and no more footholds are present, he continued with a series of smaller, more regu-lar steps carved closer to the east cliff.72 Here Pantalces appears to have worked on the vertical elements of the stair as well (risers).Caves are environments which are not naturally con-figured for human access. Many of them are located on steep cliffsides and have uneven, precipitously sloping floors. In such conditions stairs are indispensable if a cave is to be used on a regular basis. Steps and stairs are thus a recurrent feature of cave shrines, where they are needed to facilitate visitation by worshippers.73 Depending on 70 Undetected by early explorers, Pantalces’ stairway was first noted by Levi during the excavations of July 1922. Levi briefly describes this structure a “steep flight of tall rocky steps” (1923–1924, p. 29), indicating that it functioned as an “access stairway” (1923–1924, caption to p. 28, fig. 2). The architectural nature of the steps escaped Giannopoulos, who refers to them simply as ‘rocks’ (petromata, 1919, p. 48). Likewise Comparetti uses the expression ‘rock heaps’, pietrami, but poses the possibility that the ‘heaps’ belonged to the ruins of an early stairway (1923–1924, p. 147). 71 Architecturally these are the characteristics of an open well stair (i.e. a stair that “does not rest against the walls of the well except on one side only”, Ginouvès et al. 1985, II, p. 201). On modified land stairs see Templer 1992, pp. 1–7.72 “Where the influence of topography becomes insignificant, then stair shape typically takes on a geometry quite different from the meanderings that are usual to modified land stairs”, Templer 1992, pp. 6–7.73 Sporn 2007, p. 45; 2010, p. 568; 2013, p. 206. On the biomechan-ics associated with steps: Hollinshead 2015, pp. 19–24 (this study the layout of the individual sites, stairs may be external or internal, have an upward or downward direction and vary in size and number of steps. Upward flights of steps like the one discussed here (anabaseis) are found, e.g., outside the caves of Daphni in Attica and Aphyte in the Chalcidic paeninsula.74 Downward stairs (katabaseis) also appear outside, as in the cave of Krounia in Thessaly, but are mostly an interior feature:75 the long stepped descent into the cave of Vari in Attica is an appropriate example. This spectacular feat of rock-carving serves also to illus-trate another function of cave stairs. A stairway can be used infact in the manner of a processional way to link different areas of a sanctuary along an established ritual route. At Vari, where the sanctuary loops around a rocky partition in the middle of the cave, a network of down-ward and upward stairs76 guides the visitor through the various cult stations found along this circuit. First a nar-row, steep hanging stair descends from the entrance to a landing engraved with information about the sanctuary and its founder.77 Then, past a corridor equipped with purification facilities, a series of low steps lead down to a spring at the west end of the site.78 From here it is possible focuses on monumental forms, but some of the data in it are relevant to to all kinds of steps).74 Daphni (Aigaleo), Cave of Pan: Deligiorgi-Alexopoulou 1985, p. 50; full description in Travlos 1937, pp. 397–398, fig. 5 and plate A; cf.

One connects the lower part of the room, where a carved image of Archedamus stands next to an altar for Apollo, with a mezzanine occupied by a chapel to Pan and sacella for other deities.80 The other completes the sacred circuit by taking the visitor back to the entrance landing.81A stairway’s practical purpose can be married to a sym-bolic function.82 In caves with a downward orientation or other similar hypogea, stairs can be integrated in ceremo-nies featuring a ritual catabasis.83 This is often the case with underground oracular installations (such as the ady-tum at the temple of Apollo at Clarus, accessed from the pronaos by twin flights of stairs);84 or cave shrines associ-ated with rites of passage (such as the cave nymphaeum at Cyrene, where local brides descended on rock-hewn steps to purify themselves before their wedding night).85 Except as a natural sequel to catabatic ceremonies, the celebra-tion of ritual ascents is not as well documented in cave worship;86 yet it can be quite obvious from the topogra-79 Stepped passageway: Schörner and Goette 2004, pp. 20–21, plate 10: 2, map 3: 13. 80 Stair: Schörner and Goette 2004, p. 25, plate 10: 3, maps 3: 17, 4.

On the stairs, in particular, see p. 586.86 An interesting but ambiguous piece of evidence is Heraclides Criticus’ account of the yearly ascent celebrated by the Magnetes on Mt. Pelium, where a cave of Chiron stood near the precinct of Zeus Acraeus, fr. 2, 8–12 Pfister. Unfortunately the exact role (if any) played by the cave in this ceremony is unclear; cf. Aston 2006, pp. 354–357. On the site see Arvanitopoulos 1911, pp. 305–phy of certain sites that the stairs found in them had an anabatic purpose. A spectacular case in point are the 272 steps leading to the sacred Batu caves near Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia.87 A much smaller, yet intriguing, example from ancient Greece is the shrine of Heracles Buraicus in Achaia. An oracular establishment specializing in astraga-lomanteia or divination by lot, this site has been identified with a cave west of the Vouraikos gorge, in the modern municipal unit of Diakopto.88 The cave is laid out on three levels at the top of a psamite conglomerate cliff overlook-ing the old National Road. Access from the first to the sec-ond level was achieved through a well shaft in the ceiling of the ground floor chamber, probably by means of a lad-der (a detail curiously reminescent of the procedure at the Trophonium in Lebadeia, except in a reversed direction).89 A vertiginous stairway on the outer wall of the cliff then lead the visitor to the third chamber and the roof of the sanctuary. It would be surprising if no ritual meaning was assigned to this upward progression of rooms in the cave, or no symbolic continuity was perceived between it and and the steep ascent from the bottom of the hill.902.4 The Forecourt and Its StructuresOr are you one of the nymphs who dwell on this beautiful mountain? . . .

The substantial amount of votive material retrieved91 here confirms that this was a focal point for visitors; likewise, the lack of any additional archaeological record from the interior of the cave would suggest that little or no cult activity took place beyond the ledge area. Wide enough for three-four people to move comfortably about it, this rocky projection forms a natural forecourt in front of the cave. At each end of the forecourt are cult furnishings carved in the local rock. In the east the stairway leads up to a small apsidal ‘chapel’ obtained from a nook in the cliff. One obvious use of this area was for the display of sacred art. The presence here of the only niche found at the site may hint at the special nature of the exhibits (an image from the early days of the sanctuary?).92 Less clear is the function of the tall squared rock that rises within the cha-pel. The upper part of this formation has been cut in the shape of a trapezoidal altar top, perhaps to provide wor-shippers with a level surface for the deposition of offer-ings. If so, the chapel served also as a sacrificial enclosure: its position at the top of the stairs, consistent with the frequent placement of such installations on high stepped platforms,93 closely reflects the instructions given to the readers in the inscription at the bottom of the cliff, “go up, sacrifice” (anabainete, thuete, line 20). Issuing from the cliff ’s west wall, to the right of the cave opening, is a low rocky outcrop that has been cut into a rectangular block. Peek, the only scholar to take note of this formation, was reminded of a trapeza or offering table.94 From a cultic point of view this type of implement is suited to the kind of ritual acts associated with the worship of countryside gods (which involved the laying out of fruit or other food offerings and small gifts).95 Trapezai cut out of a single, 91 Levi 1923–1924, p. 32. A percentage of the large quantity of votives retrieved at the bottom of the cliff (ibid. p. 32) is also likely to have washed down from the ledge.92 Contrast e.g. the multiple niches carved into the outer walls of the cave at Phyle, Skias 1918, pp. 2–3, 20, fig. 11; cf. Amandry 1984, p. 417, fig. 10.

A rock-hewn structure in the cave of Archedamus at Vari, interpreted by Gill as a cult table of Apollo Hersos (1991, pp. 37–39, no. 8, fig. 17), is identified by Schörner and Goette as an altar (2004, p. 23, plates 11–12).

Concerning the low height, cf. e.g. the dining couches in the so-called Theater Cave at Isthmia, Broneer 1973, p. 38 (0,30 m).98 From Homer onwards, seats and couches are commonly cited in literature as cave furniture, e.g. Od. 12, 317–318; cf. the rocky beds of the Nymphs in Il. 24, 614–616. These cave furnishings constitute a surprisingly widespread and enduring topos: see e.g. how Aen. 1, 167–168,—itself an imitation of Od. 13, 107–109—reappears at the spring of Am Medudja, Tunisia, in a Roman nymphaeum of the fifth century CE see (CIL 8, 23683). Rock-cut benches and seats are attested at a variety of cave shrines, such as, e.g., the School of Aristotle at Mieza (note 106 below), the ‘Cave of the Priests’ at Cyrene (Wright 1957, pp. 301–304), and, in an amphitheatrical arrangement, at Grotta Caruso (F.

Levi observes that the tiles were made of a coarse yellow clay with white granules. He further specifies that they bore decoration in relief, her-ringbone and other linear patterns.101 This material is no longer available for study today, but the likelihood that an architectural roof existed at the Karapla cave is supported by other types of evidence.102As shown in votive art, supplementary roofing was indeed used to cover the entrance of sacred caves. This could take the form of a simple canopy roof or a porch built into an architectural facade; both types are attested in the clay models excavated at Grotta Caruso.103 Self-standing (?) roofed shelters, or skênêmata, are also cited in litera-100 Giannopoulos 1912, p. 668; cf. 1919, p. 48; contra Peek 1934, p. 19, note 3 (who was unaware that at the time of his visit the site had been already cleared and excavated by the Italian Archaeological School; cf. Riethmüller 2001, II, p. 294, note 22). “Numerous roof-tile sherds” are reported by Arvanitopulos at another Pharsalian cave, now lost, on the northeast cliff of the Prophitis Ilias hill (1929, p. 226).101 Levi 1923–1924, p. 32. See Chapter 3.3, Cat. no. 60.102 That the Greeks distinguished between naturally and artificially roofed caves is evident from a fragment ascribed to Dionysius Scymnaeus (Ath. Deipn. 9, 65 = TrGF 76 F 1), which refers to a “self-covered” Nymph cave, numphôn . . . spêlunga . . . auto-stegon. The hapax autostegos (LSJ = autorophos) seems to imply an intrinsic contrast with a roof or cover that does not occur in nature.103 Reggio Calabria, Museo Nazionale inv. Locri-Gr. Car. 359 = Costabile 1991, A 2.1, pp. 68–70, figs. 110–115: as F. Martorano remarks, the strip of lion antefixes along the top edge of this model is suggestive of a tile canopy roof (ibid. p. 68; see also p. 47, where the same structure is referred to as “a small roof used to shelter the sacred cave”). In model inv. Locri-Gr. Car. 358 = Costabile 1991, C 2.1, pp. 84–87, figs. 144–149, the cave is faced by a pedimental porch with female protomae at each end. The models from Grotta Caruso provide important evidence on the development of the architectural nymphaeum from the cave sanctuaries of Greek cult (in the words of H. Lavagne, they constitute the “missing link” in the transition from the artificial caves of the Hellenistic period to the Roman nymphaea of the Late Republic, 1988, p. 149).ture as a source of shade.104 Built on perishable wooden supports, canopy roofs are difficult to trace archaeologi-cally. On occasion, their existence can be inferred from the presence of architectural cuttings in the surround-ing rock or deposits of collapsed rooftiles.105 Roofed por-ticoes leave behind a more substantial archaeological record and are easier to identify. Examples of caves with porticoed annexes are found at the nymphaea of Mieza in Macedonia106 and Cyrene in Libya;107 cuttings for the crossbeams of a roofed structure survive also at the 104 See X. HG 5, 3, 18, where the Spartan king Agesipolis, afflicted by heatstroke, longs for the shady “shelters” (skênêmata) of Dionysus’ cave at Aphyte. The exact meaning of the word skênêma is unclear. That a cabin or another similar form of temporary shelter was implied is confirmed by Pollux, who lists skênêmata among the structures of a military camp along with skênai and kalubai (9, 14). On the use of such installations at religious centers, see two inscriptions from the Asclepieum of Epidaurus detailing the construction of skanamata on the slope of Mt. Cynortium, IG IV2 1, 109, SEG 25, 392, and the relevant com-mentary by Burford 1966, XX–XXI. Burford renders skanamata as “apartment blocks”; Holland, Householder and Scranton prefer to translate “barracks”, retaining the military associations of the term: (undated typescript, p. 1952, no. 164; see bibliography: Holland). A similar difficulty is encountered with the cognate word skana, also used to denote lodging facilities within a sacred precinct. At Epidaurus (IG IV2 1, 393; 400–402), the term refers to the priestly residence in the sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas, a multi-room, multi-function complex in mortar and rubble construction erected by the consul Julius Major Antoninus Pythodorus in the second century CE (Lambrinoudakis, PAAH 1990, pp. 45–48, fig. 1 and plates 10–18; see also 1989, pp. 50–54; 1991, pp. 44–49; 1992, pp. 44–49). A special set of regulations con-cerning the placement, size and furnishings of skanai within a sacred enclosure is found in the so-called ‘Rule of the Andanian Mysteries’ from Messenia, IG V 1, 1390 (= LSCG 65) lines 34–41.105 F.

On canopy roofs in Greek architecture: Ginouvès et al. 1985, p. 172, plates 78, 3 and 79, 7.106 The shrine of the Nymphs at Mieza was part of a complex which also housed the school of Aristotle; see Plu. Alex. 7, 4 (who reports that the complex’s “shaded walkways”, huposkioi peripa-toi, were still standing in his time). The site of this extraordinary compound lies at the foot of Mt. Bermius near modern day Naoussa. Here a low cliff stretching between two natural caves was architecturally altered to receive an L-shaped portico with a slanted roof. Grooves for the roof ’s supports are visible on all three sides of the rocky façade. The area between the two open-ings measures approximately 50 m. in length, but the complex extended much further, incorporating a third cave to the north of the porticoed section.

In either case one would expect to find traces of architectural work in the rock surface above and beside the cave opening, i.e. in the areas where the roof and its supports would have been leaning against. A shed roof would have also left behind some evidence for foundation work, such as post holes on the ledge floor. The absence of any such markings is puzzling;109 one is left wonder-ing whether they could have been obliterated by erosion, or the ancient builders (Pantalces?) simply adopted a roof design that did not require permanent alterations of the environment.110 A similar situation is encountered at the Vari cave in Attica, where scattered remains of a fourth century roof were discovered near the entrance but no corresponding postholes or other architectural cuttings.111Architectural roofs extended the natural cover that a Greek was accustomed to expect at a cave sanctuary.112 108 Bura cave: “A roofed stoa or room, a building in any case appro-priate to an ancient rural sanctuary”, Katsonopoulou–Soter 1993, p. 64; cf. p. 61. For a fuller discussion of this site see p. 28 above. Phyle cave: Skias 1918, p. 20, fig. 11 (the cuttings are visible below the rightmost niche).109 As reasonably pointed out by Riethmüller 2001, II p. 294, note 22. At the aforementioned cave of Krounia, in southeast Thessaly, the excavators found remains of both rooftiles and columnar supports; interestingly, however, no mention is made of archi-tectural cuttings, either on the ground or on the walls. See Agouridis et al. 2006, p. 252; also pp. 250–251 and figs. 2–6.110 Simple tiled roofs, built without any visible alteration to the surrounding rock face, appear today over the entrance of some Orthodox cave shrines. An example not too far from our site is the small grotto of Agia Paraskevi on the north slope of Mt. Ossa, above the modern town of Omolio. Cement-based construction is substantially different, of course, from ancient Greek building techniques.111 Schörner and Goette 2004, p. 53, note 318; see also pp. 12, note 64 and 108. The occurrence of a few rooftile fragments on a sacred site does not necessarily imply the existence of a roof, as spare rooftiles were sometimes used as improvised supports for votives (I owe this information to Bampis Intzesinoglou of the 13th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities in Volos). Much depends on the quantity of the fragments—which in the case of our cave is reported to have been considerable (p. 30 above).112 Lavagne 1988, p. 298 rightly describes the covered walkways (huposkioi peripatoi) seen by Plutarch at Mieza as “monumental facilities which extended and surrounded the cave” (italics mine). Artificial shade appears to have been appreciated as much as natural one; cf. Agesipolis’ yearning for the skiera skênêmata of the cave of Dionysus at Aphyte in X. HG 5, 3, 18, note 104 above. They provided a sheltered space outside the cave proper where visitors could worship or simply stop to peer inside. At caves with underground springs they also functioned in the manner of fountainhouse roofs, preventing debris from falling in the water that collected out front (an appropriate example of such a roof being that of the so-called fountain of Apollo at Cyrene, built outside of a former Nymph shrine).113 The latter function fits well the situation at the Karapla sanctuary, where a small stream trickled out of the cave or formed a pool by the entrance.114 Here, as we have seen, a bench was carved in the rock of the cliff according to a layout frequently used for foun-tains and natural springs. The same basic elements—a roof cover and stone seating, closely connected to a body of water—are present at the cave of Krounia, some sixty kilometers to the southeast, near the border between the peripheral units of Magnesia and Phthiotis (notes 98; 109 above).2.6 The CaveA cursory glance at the interior of the cave is enough to realize that this space could not be used for cult activ-ity. Even in its current dry conditions, it is an environ-ment which allows very little freedom of movement. The water channel which cuts its path through the rocky floor occupies most of the place, leaving almost no room for a visitor to walk by. The steep incline of the floor adds to the difficulty.115 In antiquity, when water streamed down from the source at the back of the cave, the slippery con-dition of the rock surface would have made movement 113 Stucchi 1975, p. 587 and fig. 595. On the sacred grotto or that opens behind, see ibid. pp. 585–589; Wright 1957, pp. 309–310; Settis 1973, pp. 689–693. It was not unusual for sacred caves to be refurbished as fountainhouses in some phase of ther history, a case at point being the above cited nymphaeum of Cyrene—defined by Settis as “a model sequence” in the historical devel-opment from cave to architectural nymphaeum, 1973 p. 689. On this process see also Lavagne 1988. 114 Although the activity of this watercourse is difficult to recon-struct in any historical detail, it is clear that its behavior was subject to seasonal change. When fed by rainwater, it appears to have flowed out of the cave forming a waterfall over the bor-der of the ledge. Brittle and fractured, the bedrock in the middle section of the ledge floor still bears the effects of intense water exposure (p. 20 above). The occurrence of runoff on this nar-row strip of floor would not have necessarily interfered with the sanctuary’s activities; cf. e.g. the situation at Grotta Caruso, where altar and cult statue were actually set up in a pool of water ca. 0,5 m deep (Martorano, in Costabile 1991, pp. 12–13, see also the photos at p. 7, fig. 5; p. 235, fig. 363 and the plans at pp. 8, fig. 6; 10, figs. 9a–b).115 Peek speaks of a “gentle” tilt (1938, p. 19), but the gradient in the inner part of the cave is well above 45 degrees."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"chapter 232within this confined space even more problematic. Yet, in contrast with other caves which have been altered archi-tecturally in order to facilitate human use,116 here no vis-ible attempts appear to have been made to mitigate the imperviousness of the natural setting. The most plausible explanation is that all essential cult activities took place outside the cave proper. As we saw, this is supported by the fact that, with the exception of two isolated sherds, the great majority of votives from this site were retrieved on the ledge in front of the cave entrance and on the terrace immediately below. The likelihood that the ledge was fit-ted originally with a roof also leads to the same conclusion.3 ConclusionsThe geographical position and the type of terrain in which the site is located suggest that the Karapla cave, like the great majority of such installations, was mainly visited by individuals associated with the economy and culture of the oros.117 On the other hand, its proximity to Pharsalus and the fact that it was both visible and accessible from one of the city’s major communication routes facilitated patronage by other categories of the local population.118 Not as easy to assess is the possible use of the cave by Pharsalus’ southwestern neighbor, the bordering city of Proerna. Access to the site from this direction, although unaided by communications or visibility, was by no means impossible. As the topography of many other cave shrines shows, the ancients could go to great lengths in order to worship at such locations.119116 See, e.g., a wall built to provide secure footing near one of the shrines in the Vari cave, at a spot where “so steep is the floor of the cave . . . that it is almost impossible to stand upon it”, Weller 1903, pp. 273–274, fig. 4; cf. plate I, Y. 117 See p. 1 above. For recent perspectives on the oros in Greek cul-ture see the studies by Buxton 1992; Langdon 2000. On moun-tains and the city state: Jameson 1985.118 Sporn 2007, pp. 45–46. Elsner and Rutherford 2005, p. 18. 119 The remote location of most Nymph caves did not seem to deter, for example, the patronage of pregnant women who regularly sought the assistance of these goddesses in childbirth; see e.g. Rakatsanis-Tziafalias 2004, pp. 92–93. Although rare, the occa-sional presence at such sites of large or heavy stone votives which we would consider difficult to transport is also reveal-ing about ancient attitudes on the subject. Within Thessaly an instructive example is that of the inscribed stelai recovered in the nymphaeum on Mt. Ossa, a cave located at an elevation of ca. 1000 masl in a rocky wilderness far more remote and intimi-dating than the Karapla hill (Wace and Thompson 1908–1909, pp. 243–247; cf. Nichols and Wagman 2010, plates 1, 10–11). On ‘spending energy’ as an important part of Greek religious behav-ior, see Naerebout 2003–2004. According to a pattern also attested at the cave of Vari in Attica, Pantalces’ foundation on the Karapla hill con-sisted of two essential acts, the planting of a garden and the outfitting of a natural cave for cult purposes (see Chapter 4.2.4 below, commentary to lines 12, 14–15). Today the most visible vestige of this work is a stairway cut in the live rock of the mountain. This stairway does not stand alone, but is the central feature in a more comprehensive landscaping effort that bridged two distinct regions of the sanctuary. From the sacred garden at the foot of the cliff to the mouth of the cave on the landing above, it marked a trail for visitors to follow, a reduced version, as it were, of the processional ways or hierai hodoi found at larger sanc-tuaries.120 Along its border there were stations where the visitor could find information on the sanctuary’s history, admire the votive art on display, and perform ritual acts. As M. Hollinshead notes, in one of her important stud-ies on monumental steps, “An individual’s experience of a site would be shaped by the pathway (space) and the sequence of perceptions (time) created by a prescribed route of access”.121 A similar landscaping approach, as we saw, was adopted by Archedamus of Thera for his own stairway at the Vari cave.As in Vari, worshippers began their visit at a planted area in the outer part of the sanctuary. We can surmise that this enclosure, which spread over a natural terrace extending along the base of the cliff, was planted with trees and flowering shrubs not unlike those found there today. Here visitors would be greeted by Inscription II, which informed them about the site and its founder, directing them to continue their visit upstairs.From the garden, the stairway climbed up the rocky slope to the upper level of the sanctuary. Because of the roughness of the ascent and the limited space, visitors had to proceed in small groups and go up the stairs one or few at a time.122 High above the third step they could read the original dedicatory inscription by the sanctuary’s founder, carved on the cliff ’s east wall. Upon reaching the top of the stairway they found themselves on a small 120 “As pathways, steps create processional routes toward and within cities and sanctuaries”, Hollinshead 2015, p. 3. It goes without saying that significant differences exist between the proces-sional way to a major temple and the steps to a rural cave shrine; the analogy suggested here is only concerned with the function that such paths seem to have, regardless of scale or topography, in shaping and choreographing the visitor’s experience. On hie-rai hodoi in general: Sinn, ThesCRA IV (2005) pp. 46–50.121 Hollinshead 2012, p. 31; see also 2015, pp. 29–32.122 A similar situation must have also existed at the Vari cave, where visitors had to make their descent into the shrine through a narrow, vertiginously steep stairway open on both sides (p. 27 above)."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The Site33landing stretching in front of the cave. This, as Peek rightly saw, was the sanctuary’s “actual cult space”, the area spe-cifically reserved for sacrifices and other ritual activi-ties. Here was also where some of the oldest and most revered items of the shrine’s votive collection (Pantalces’ original gifts) were likely to be displayed. There seems to have been no differentiation between a sacrificial area proper and a space dedicated to votive exhibits, such as has been suggested, e.g., for the Vari cave.123 As no refer-ences to archaeofaunal remains or ash deposits are found in the excavation records, it is difficult to determine whether animal sacrifice was practiced on the Karapla or just unbloody offerings, such as fruits and flowers, were used. The steepness of the stairs leading to the sacrifi-cial area and the limited space around the ‘altar’ would argue against the former possibility but, as already noted, ancient Greeks were not generally discouraged by terrain conditions which seem unfavorable to us. Even if the pre-cinct’s upper level could be accessed by only a few people at a time, it was still possible for a small sacrificial party to operate comfortably within it, just as it was possible for a small animal to be hoisted up the stairway without too much trouble. As for further activities such as cooking and banqueting, the situation is more elusive: technically, the ledge’s dimensions are compatible with (or, in some cases, even greater than) those of several dining rooms found at other sanctuaries.124 On the other hand, the pre-cinct’s lower level, with its ample and attractively planted terrace, would seem a far more suitable space for parties than a rough rocky shelf projecting several meters above ground.125 As we saw, tents and other similar forms of tem-porary shelter were regularly employed in visits to sacred sites—nor should we exclude that some of the rooftiles found by Levi at the bottom of the cliff wall (Chapter 3.3 Cat. no. 60) could belong to a structure other than the canopy roof placed over the cave entrance.The last station in this sacred itinerary was at the cave’s mouth, where a stream once gushed forth from inside. Originally the water flowed out over the edge of the landing, forming a waterfall to the right of the stair-123 Schörner and Goette 2004; Sporn 2007.124 Cf. e.g. the measurements of the banqueting rooms in the north-east ‘Cult Cave’ at the sanctuary of Poseidon at Isthmia: Broneer 1973, pp. 34–35; or those of the dining facilities at the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore on Acrocorinth: Bookidis and Stroud 1997, appendix I, table 2 (with bibliography at p. 393, note 2). See also the overview on ‘sympotic space’ by Bergquist 1990, pp. 37–65.125 As one might expect, the preparation and consumption of meals at sacred caves had to be adjusted to the topography of the indi-vidual sites: contrast, e.g., the indoor setting of the famous ban-queting scene in Menander’s Dyscolus with the open air ‘picnic’ described in Alciphron 4, 13. way. In Pantalces’ time it is more likely that it stopped near the entrance, creating a pool in the roofless room at the front of the cave. In this spot visitors could refresh themselves and rest on the nearby stone bench, as they would have done, e.g., at the sanctuary of Grotta Caruso, where a large water basin with amphitheatrical seating stood at the cave entrance (probably replacing a natural pool like the one considered here).126 As for the cave itself, the evidence seems to suggest that no cult activities took place beyond its threshold.With its upward orientation and well-lit interior,127 open to the sounds of the surrounding countryside, the Karapla cave defies the common perception of caves as dark, secluded descents to the underworld. Thus, although there have been some attempts to interpret this site as a setting for underground mystic experiences and self-induced trance,128 Pantalces’ shrine fails to display the most two essential features of a such an establish-ment. These, as Y. Ustinova has argued in a recent study, are the all-enfolding darkness and silence which in sub-terranean environments can cause our sensory world to shut off, prompting the neurological system to respond in unusual ways.129 Now, there is no spot in the Karapla cave where one can attain to this state of complete per-ceptual isolation: even in the small room at the far end of the gallery—a space which would otherwise qualify as a perfect adytum in size and shape130—darkness is never complete during the daytime and silence can always be 126 Martorano, in Costabile 1991, p. 9, see also the plans at pp. 8, fig. 6 and 10, fig. 9 b; and the photos at pp. 9, fig. 8 and 11, figs. 12–13. 127 As mentioned in the Introduction (p. 2 above) the cave is more suggestive of an attic than a cellar. On the possible ritual func-tion of attic spaces (and the staircases associated with them) in Greek temple architecture see the very interesting study by Miles 1998–1999. Especially intriguing, with regard to the topic at hand, is the example of the Temple of Concord at Acragas, where the two doorways to the attic have a mysterious ogi-val shape strongly reminescent of a cave entrance (pp. 16–17, figs. 23–24). 128 Ustinova 2009, pp. 33–34. Some of the earlier studies suggest that Pantalces’ description in Inscription II fits the profile of a possessed or inspired individual, but abstain from postulating a correlation between this condition and the physical charac-teristics of the cave: Himmelmann-Wildschütz 1957, pp. 10–11; Connor 1998, pp. 162–163; Bonnechere 2001, pp. 34–37; Larson 2001, pp. 17–18; Pache 2011, pp. 52–55.

It is fair to say that one’s senses could never stay idle at the Karapla cave: rather, the place does enfold its visitors in a variety of sensory experi-ences which in Classical literature were typically associ-ated with the ideal pastoral landscape.132 As we have seen, these are visual, olphactory, tactile, and aural stimuli that arise from the presence of certain natural features: the colors and fragrance of flowering vegetation, shade, and the freshness and pleasant murmur of flowing water—all elements that, with the exception of the last, are still found at the Karapla today. It is seems reasonable to con-clude that when one visited the Karapla cave it was not to achieve a voluntary deprivation of the senses, but to replenish them. This kind of stimulus-rich environment is indeed more consistent with Greek beliefs about altered states and inspiration than the stimulus-poor, ‘ascetic’ cave model adopted by Ustinova in her study. Many nar-ratives ancient and modern attest to the bewitching effect that such picturesque Nymph haunts as springs, woods, and meadows may have upon the human mind: Socrates’ response to the enchanted scenery of the Ilissus, in the beginning paragraphs of the Phaedrus, is an appropriate case in point. Beguiled by the charms of a small nymph grove on the banks of the river,133 in this famous story 131 A recent addition to the sounds of the Pharsalian countryside is the noise of highway traffic from state road E65. Even from a distance of over 1 km, cars and trucks are clearly audible at the rear end of the cave. On the avian fauna of Nymph caves (and its appreciation by the ancients), see the passage by Diodorus cited above, p. 23. This text is also worth noting for its description of a well lit cave interior (3, 69, 3). On cave shrines and natural light-ing: Sporn 2007, p. 44.132 In addition to the aforementioned excerpt from Diodorus, see e.g. the detailed cavescapes by Longus, 1, 4 and Quintus Smyrnaeus 468–490. On the aesthetics of locus amoenus land-scapes, see the bibliography given at note 65 above.133 A textbook example of locus amoenus topography, the riverside setting of this dialogue described in detail in 230b–c: “Soc. By Hera, it is a charming resting place. For this plane tree is very spreading and lofty, and the tall and shady willow is very beauti-ful, and it is in full bloom, so as to make the place most fragrant; then, too, the spring is very pretty as it flows under the plane tree, and its water is very cool, to judge by my foot. And it seems to be a sacred place of some nymphs and of Achelous, judging by the figurines and statues. Then again, if you please, how lovely and perfectly charming the breeziness of the place is! and it resounds with the shrill summer music of the chorus of cicadas. But the most delightful thing of all is the grass, as it grows on the gentle slope, thick enough to be just right when you lay your head on it” (transl. Fowler). As Larson observes, “such a place as this is never without a divine presence, which accounts for the appeal of the landscape, and its strong influence upon the even the level-headed Socrates has to aknowledge, if only in a playful way, the seductive influence that the place appears to have upon him:Soc. Well, my dear Phaedrus, does it seem to you, as it does to me, that I am inspired?Phaedr. Certainly, Socrates, you have an unusual fluency.Soc. Then listen to me in silence; for truly the place seems filled with a divine presence; so do not be sur-prised if I often seem to be in a frenzy (numpholêp-tos . . . genômai) as my discourse progresses, for I am already almost uttering dithyrambics (238c–d transl. Fowler).There is no reason to doubt that, just as Socrates’ ‘unusual fluency’ in the Platonic story, Pantalces’ devotional activi-ties at the Karapla cave may have been inspired by the surrounding environment; but if so, it would have been through the unusual richness of physical sensation, not the lack thereof, that the Nymphs of the place did exert their power over him.134As a freshwater source, the Karapla cave would have been a watering stop for those categories of the Pharsalian population that pursued their occupations in the moun-tains west of town—goatherds, woodcutters, beekepers, charcoal-burners, hunters and general wayfarers. As a religious shrine, it provided a space for human worship-pers to share with the local gods the gifts of their natural domain—especially the pleasantness of year-round veg-etation, a welcome diversion from the treeless monotony of the Pharsalian landscape. In this double function, which involved mainly the outside part of the sanctuary, the Karapla cave was not unlike many other rural shrines of the ancient world. Besides such general characteris-tics, the investigation of the site’s physical layout does not reveal any evidence for a specialized use of the cave, such as an oracular seat or a healing center. For further infor-mation on the Karapla and its cults we need to turn thus to the examination of the votive and epigraphical materi-als found at the site. These will be discussed in the follow-ing two chapters.susceptible observer” (2001, p. 20; cf. Brulé 2012, pp. 35–39). On nympholepsy and landscape see also the recent discussion by Fabiano 2013.134 As their beliefs in the mind-altering power of sound show, Greeks were well aware that sensory stimulation is just as effective as sensory deprivation in triggering possession and other similar religious phenomena.

Inscription II was hardly legible to the naked eye because of the shallow lettering and the weathered condition of the stone. Despite these challenges (or maybe exactly because of them) the new documents from Karapla proved to have an immediate allure for the scholarly world of the time and a number of distinguished Classicists tried their hand at improv-ing Giannopoulos’ readings, especially in the text of Inscription I.3 Inspired by the promise of “tablets, statues, and many gifts” in the longer inscription and the wealth of surface remains scattered in front of the cave, several of these early scholars advocated a prompt archaeological exploration of the site.42 ExcavationsIt seems to be a sacred place of some nymphs . . . judging by the figurines and statues. Plato, Phaedrus (transl. Fowler)The task of excavating the Karapla cave site was under-taken by the Italian Archaeological School at Athens dur-ing the excavation season of 1921–1922. The supervision of the work was entrusted by SAIA director A. della Seta to two junior members of the school, the famed archaeolo-gists D. Levi and G. Bagnani, then at the beginning of their careers.5 The digging, conducted in mid July at the very end of the campaign, took less than a week to complete (17–22/7/1922). Levi and Bagnani opened a total of five trenches, three of which were dug in the terrace directly below the cave and in two areas to the east and west of it. The remaining two were dug inside the cave proper and on the landing before the entrance. Despite the fact that all trenches reached down to virgin soil (i.e. to a depth of over 2 m below the current ground level), only two of them yielded a significant amount of remains.3 For a discussion of the scholarship on the two inscriptions see Chapter 4 below. 4 Giannopoulos 1919; Comparetti 1923–1924, among others.5 Della Seta 1922–1923, pp. 284–285; Comparetti, ap. Levi 1923–1924, p. 27.chapter 3The Votives (Plates XXV–XXXV)1 DiscoveryJust as a dove that is suddenly startled from a cave flies out to the fields loudly flapping her wings . . .Vergil, Aeneid The modern history of the Karapla cave begins in 1912, at the outset of the Balkan Wars, when amateur antiquarian Sotirios Evangelopoulos of Pharsala accidentally came upon the site while hunting for wildfowl on the hills near town. Deeply embedded into a cliff and covered by foli-age, the place had become a nesting place for rock doves.1 Only two years before, the ephor of Thessalian Antiquities Apostolos Arvanitopoulos had walked up to the same spot, where he had noted the presence of inscriptions carved in the walls of the cliff.2 Hindered by the late hour and bad weather conditions, Arvanitopoulos did not notice the passage which opened a few meters above the carvings. Evangelopoulos reported his discovery to the renowned Thessalian archaeologist Nikolaos Giannopoulos, who decided to visit the site while on a reconnaissance trip “in the municipalities of Pharsalus, Scotussa, and Euhydrium”. He and Evangelopoulos made the climb to the cave on August 16. This is how the site appeared to them on that summer day of 1912:The cave lies on the northeast slope of the moun-tain, between very high cliffs. Though sufficiently tall and spacious, it is elongated and of average width, extending into the mountain to a great depth, which we did not measure (Giannopoulos 1919, p. 48).Like most scholars after him, Giannopoulos devoted his attention mainly to the epigraphical findings, recording only basic information on the topographical and archaeo-logical aspects of the site. Following a brief report on the discovery of the cave in 1912, which appeared in BCH of the same year, he went on to publish a full commentary on the text of both inscriptions in AE 1919. The deci-pherment of these documents did not turn out to be an easy task.

This part of the terrace had to be cleared out of the thick shrubbery and the many fallen rocks encumbering it. The second largest collection of material was retrieved at the top of the stairway, on the rocky landing in front of the cave entrance. The cave itself contained almost no find-ings at all. Equally unsatisfactory were the soundings east and west of the terrace, especially that of a small subsid-iary cave approximately 100 m to the west of the main site, which had seemed at first particularly promising. In accordance with the remains found on the surface, the excavated material consisted primarily of small ter-racotta sculpture, pottery, and tiles. Levi produced a descriptive catalog of the objects, based on the excava-tion inventory, which was published in the Italian School’s annals of the following year. Upon the completion of the excavation, the objects were transferred to the Volos Museum, where they are now reported as missing.6 The Catalog included in the present study is based on Levi’s inventory and on the photos preserved in the Archivio Fotografico of the Italian Archaeological School at Athens, files B 322–341 and C 902–911. 3 Catalog of ObjectsFor the sake of simplicity the objects described below are listed in the same order as the original excavation inventory; occasional exceptions and additions are noted. Measurements have been added whenever a photo-graphic scale was available. In absence of a scale, an effort has been made to provide estimates based on comparison with measured items. Such estimates are only intended to be indicative and make no claim to accuracy. Terracottas (1–61)1a–b. Two bird-faced figurines. Excavation Inventory: no. 1.

Pitt-Kethley’s humorous account of her own attempt to see the same objects, 1994, pp. 189–201. [b] Figs. 52: 5, 60: 1, 61: 4. Clay statuette, wholly pre-served. Height: ± 0,033 m. A female figurine similar to the one above. Early Archaic?Both figurines show the characteristic facial traits of the beaked or bird-faced type, where “the features are repre-sented by two blobs for eyes and an unbroken curve for nose and chin” (Higgins 1969, p. 32, no. 1). The head is tilted upwards, as are the eyes, which are oval in shape. The body is cylindrical with an upward taper. The arms, damaged in both figures, are folded over the chest in the act of holding something which is no longer discernible. As the surviving traces show, this item was fashioned from a separate piece of clay pressed into the main figure. Levi, comparing a similar statuette from the Geometric period at the Acropolis Museum in Athens (Winter 1903, I, p. 24, no. 1), assumes that the missing part was an infant. However, in the absence of any other Geometric finds at the cave, he dismisses the possibility of a pre-Hellenic cult at this site (“or even a cult of Cybele, the Μήτηρ Ὀρεία”, 1923–1924, pp. 33–34), suggesting that the two figurines represent instead a case of religious conservatism.Evidence for the cult of eminent female deities with kourotrophic attributes is found throughout the territory of Pharsalus and its environs, beginning in the seventh millennium at the nearby site of Achilleio, ca. 8 km south-east of our cave (Gimbutas et al. 1989, pp. 179–198 and 335), and continuing into historical times on the acropolis hill at Pharsalus (Daffa-Nikonanou 1973, pp. 26–27, 73–78; Mili 2015, appendix 2, pp. 335–336) and at the Demetreium of Proerna (Daffa-Nikonanou 1973, pp. 22–26; 60–73; Mili 2015, appendix 2, pp. 342–343); see also the recently dis-covered Metroum in Pharsalus (Katakouta, forthcoming; summary: Stamatopoulou 2013, p. 47). It is unclear if any major goddesses of the Greek pantheon were venerated on the Karapla. With the possible exception of the two figurines described above (and the seated female with an animal on her lap listed at Cat. no. 32 below), none of the other votives from the cave seem to point in that direc-tion, nor do Cybele or Demeter appear among the local deities celebrated in Inscription II. More likely, Cat. no. 1 a-b are representations of Nymphs, since these deities are often associated with nursing and child rearing in both mythology and cult (LIMC VIII, 1997, pp. 897–898, s.v. ‘Nymphai’; see also the Thessalian evidence cited by Hadzisteliou Price 1978, p. 164).2a–b–c.

A female figure sitting frontally with the hands on her knees. The discernible plastic detail is minimal, possibly because of wear. No foot-rest. Archaic.Cat. no. 3 belongs to a broadly attested type in which the enthroned figure wears a himation over her head and shoulders. Similar terracottas have been found at the aforementioned sanctuaries of Pharsalus and Proerna, and the rural precinct of Ampelia Pharsalon (Daffa-Nikonanou 1973, pp. 68–72, ΠΡ 98–138; 76–77, ΦΑ 31–46; 82–83, ΑΜ 57–69, with discussion at pp. 101–103. On the Ampelia precinct see also pp. 27–28; Mili 2015, p. 336). It is unclear whether these statuettes depict divine or human personalities; their appearance in both sacred and funer-ary contexts, combined with the absence of any specific iconographical attributes, pose a problem of interpreta-tion. The enthroned position is suggestive of some form of female power—goddess, priestess, or deceased ancestor. Within the particular setting of cave shrines, it is difficult to imagine how such figurines could represent anything but the Nymphs themselves. Seated females are a recur-rent feature in the coroplastic art from rural nymphaea; for example, a significant quantity of them, still awating full publication, was retrieved at the Corycian cave (BCH Suppl. 7, 1981, p. 81, fig. 4); also worth mentioning are the examples from Grotta Caruso at the National Museum of Reggio Calabria, especially inv. 240 and 317 (Costabile 1991, p. 94, figs. 161–162; p. 96), which bear a close resemblance to the ones in our Catalog. Outside the terracotta medium, a most impressive specimen of an enthroned female fig-ure is the so-called ‘Cybele’ hewn in the live rock of the cave of the Nymphs at Vari (Schörner and Goette 2004, pp. 26–27, plates 14–16 and map 3, no. 20; LIMC VIII, 1997, p. 748, no. 6, s.v. ‘Kybele’; cf. Connor 1988, pp. 185–187). Vari has also yielded a number of remarkable marble reliefs showing Nymphs sitting inside a cave frame, Athens, National Museum inv. 2011–2012 (Schörner and Goette 2004, pp. 69–74 R5-R6, plates 41–42). For a discussion of the seated figure in Greek art, particularly in the Archaic Period, see the dissertation by Alford 1978. 4. Female figure with diadem.Excavation Inventory: no. 10.

Clay protome of the backless variety intended for suspen-sion, extant in the face only. Maximum height: ± 0,08 m. The figure seems to belong to the well-known type with diadem (stephanê) and veil (krêdemnon). Veil, ears, and neck are missing. Under the στεφάνη the hair is parted in two untextured bands framing the forehead and the temples. The face has an oval shape, with full cheeks and a promi-nent rounded chin. The lips are equally prominent and turned up at the corners in the so-called ‘archaic smile’. Eyes are almond-shaped and outlined in relief; the brows well-marked. These characteristics, reminescent of some korai from the Acropolis Museum in Athens (e.g. nos. 679, 684), or other equally well-known sculptures from the Archaic Period such as the Nike of Delos (Athens, National Museum 21), would safely place our terracotta in the 6th century.

Hair, ear, and diadem match those of other large protomes discovered locally; cf. e.g. the beautiful mask published by Theocharis in 1966 (AD 21, Β ́, Χρονικά, plate 246, now at the Volos Museum, inv. Μ 4520; full discussion and additional photos in Daffa-Nikonanou 1973, pp. 73, ΦΑ 1, and 105–108, plate 5, figs. 3–4; Croissant 1983, p. 355, no. 236, plates 139–140). Late Archaic/Early Classical?The veiled female visage—a woman with krêdem-non and stephanê shown frontally from the chest up—is the most widespread of Greek protomic types, attested across the Mediterranean from Asia Minor to Southern Italy, as well as Punic Africa and Sardinia: in Smyth’s words, “something like a koine: not quite universally popular [. . .], but widely manu-factured [. . .], with local differences less remarkable than the uniformity of development”, 1949, p. 355. As with the enthroned statuettes discussed above, the exact meaning of these votives is not altogether clear, but it is almost universally agreed that they represent divine, rather than human figures. The identity of the godhead seems to vary according to location and archaeological context, which can be cultic as well as funerary, the only seemingly invari-able element being the chthonic aspect common to most offerings (e.g. Daffa-Nikonanou 1973, pp. 112–115; although the earth associations of this type of votive have been recently doubted by Uhlenbrock 1989). Significant lots of such masks associated with the worship of Demeter have been discovered in the second half of the twentieth century within the city of Pharsalus (Daffa-Nikonanou 1973, pp. 73–75, ΦΑ 1–20, plate 5, figs. 3–4; Croissant 1983, nos. 236, plates 139–140; 238–239, plate 140; Mili 2015, especially pp. 122–123), as well as the neighboring sites of Ampelia (Daffa-Nikonanou 1973, pp. 80–81, AM 32–43) and Proerna (ibid. pp. 63–66, ΠΡ 45–52, 59–66, 68–69, 80–82, plate 6, figs. 1–2). The Pharsalian material, in particular, includes some very refined specimens in early Severe Style which point to the existence of an important local workshop, perhaps of Athenian or Phocian origin (Croissant 1983, p. 357). Our Cat. no. 5 shows characteristics peculiar to the protomes from this atelier—especially the rimmed diadem, not attested anywhere else except Cirrha in Phocis (Croissant 1983, nos. 233–234, plate 138; no. 237, plate 139). Cat. no. 4, on the other hand, appears to be sty-listically and chronologically distinguished from no. 5 and the other Pharsalian masks, reflecting an earlier phase in local coroplastic production. Although smaller and far less known than the later specimens from the city deposit, the head from the Karapla cave is a remarkable piece of protomic art. Not surprisingly, Levi, who was writing at a time when no other evidence from the area had yet been unearthed, believed that Cat. no. 4 could stand com-parison with the well-known terracotta masks at the British Museum, remarking that its features revealed “a notably personal and energetic character” (1923–1924, pp. 34–35). The skillful rendering of the figure’s face is in contrast with most Pharsalian protomes of the same size, where plastic detail is usually replaced by painting. For an overview of small protomes found in the region, see Daffa-Nikonanou 1973, pp. 74–75, ΦΑ 11–20 (Pharsalus); 80–81, AM 32–43 (Ampelia); 63–65, ΠΡ 45–52, 59–66, 68–69 (Proerna). Votive protomes appear in connection with Nymph wor-ship at a number of sites, including the Corycian cave (Croissant 1983, nos. 194, plate 123; 199, plate 124; 201–202, plate 124; 204, plate 125; 212, plate 128; 243, plate 142; 248, plate 143; 249, plate 141; 250, plate 143), the so-called ‘cave of Odysseus’ on Polis Bay, Ithaca (Benton 1938–1939, pp. 40–42, nos. 36–38, plates 19–20) and the recently exca-vated Drakaina Cave in the island of Cephalonia (Chatzioti 2009, p. 4, fig. 8); other occurrences are listed by Smyth 1949, p. 354, note 3 (Chrysovitsa, Aetolia: Qulia, a brook Nymph?

Fragment from the upper part of a clay pinax (?) showing the head of a female figure in full frontal view and traces of a pos-sible second figure along the breakline on the right side.

The face has a delicate round shape with a soft, ample chin and a small, full-lipped mouth placed very close to the nose. The hair is rendered as a crown of plastic wavelets framing the upper part of the head from ear to ear. On the ears are small disk pendants. Immediately to the right is a blurred con-vex shape which may be part of another human head, although the traces are too indistinct to be"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"39The Votivesspecific. Levi is reminded of the familiar terracotta type, especially favored by Hellenistic coroplasts, depicting two females sitting or standing closely to each other as in the examples printed in Winter 1903, II, p. 106.Figural groups are common in votive art, especially in the worship of divine pluralities such as the Nymphs. For the most part they are representations of the goddesses them-selves, in configurations of two, three, or more figures, shown in the act of dancing, standing, or sitting. Such groups can also depict human votaries engaged in some form of ritual activity, vz. sacrificing, music-making, danc-ing, or banqueting. In addition to the female couples cited by Levi, the figural arrangement in Cat. no. 6 is remines-cent of some kourotrophic pairs where the child appears on the upper right side of the group, its head aligned with that of the mother; local examples for this kind of scheme are found at Proerna, see Daffa-Nikonanou 1973, pp. 63, ΠΡ 39, 43 and 69, ΠΡ 145; plate 3, figs. 1–3. Rather than a double protome or statuette group, as suggested by Levi, the shallow depth of this relief seems more consistent with a votive tablet. An appropriate Pharsalian com-parandum is a clay pinax from the acropolis hill showing Demeter and Kore sitting side by side within an aedicula enclosure (Daffa-Nikonanou 1973, p. 75, ΦΑ 26, plate 12, fig. 2). Countless deposits of similar pinakes related to the cult of the Nymphs have been found in caves around Greece; for examples and bibliography see Larson’s overview of known Nymph shrines in 2001, pp. 226–267. As for the date of Cat. no. 6, hair and the overall style of the main figure would place this relief in the fourth century (or, at the very earliest, in the late fifth; cf. e.g. the Late Classical heads retrieved by Benton at the Polis cave in Ithaca, 1938–1939 pp. 41–42, nos. 51, 53, 55, plates 19–20).7. Female figure with tall hairdo.Excavation Inventory: no. 13. SAIA Photographic Archive: B 340–341. Bibliography: Levi 1923–1924, p. 35, fig. 14.Figs. 57: 2, 58: 2. Head from a clay statuette broken below the neck and on the upper left side; the nose is also damaged. Maximum height (estimated): ± 0,08. The face, a well-designed oval resting on a tall neck, shows features similar to Cat. no. 6, with a rounded chin and a small mouth drawn in the same serious countenance. Although emphasized by prominent superciliary arches, the eyes are not rendered in plastic detail. The remains of a diadem are discern-ible in the hair, which is drawn up in a tall hairdo.Hair and overall features of Cat. no. 7 easily place this piece in the Hellenistic Period. Levi cites a simi-larly-styled figure at the Louvre (inv. 221 = Winter 1903, II, p. 5, no. 7); comparable hairdos can also be observed on some Hellenistic heads from Proerna, cf. Daffa-Nikonanou 1973, pp. 66–67, ΠΡ 94–98, plate 8, with discussion at pp. 118–120. Recent rescue excava-tions of Hellenistic homes in downtown Pharsala have brought to light large quantities of similar stat-uettes, attesting to the popularity of the genre as well as the strength of the local coroplastic tradition. 8. Male figurine with ivy wreath (Dionysus?).Excavation Inventory: no. 14. SAIA Photographic Archive: B 340–341; C 907–908a–b, cf. 911. Bibliography: Levi 1923–1924, p. 35, fig. 15.Figs. 57: 3, 58: 4, 63: 1, 64: 2, 65: 2; cf. 59. Head from a clay statuette broken below the neck. Maximum height (estimated): ± 0,08. The face of this figure has an oval outline comparable to Cat. no. 7 but features of a somewhat more emphatic design, such as well-defined eyes and a straight long nose. The mouth is small, as in nos. 6–7, but with the corners turned up in a slight smile. The most notable attributes are the shaggy hair framing the figure’s forehead and the leafy ivy wreath flaring at its temples, which would identify Cat. no. 8 with a satyr or perhaps, as Levi suggested, Dionysus himself (no further clues on this point are provided by the shape of the ears, indis-cernible under hair and wreath). Style and iconogra-phy argue for a date in the Late Classical or Hellenistic Periods. On the rendering of the wreath in particu-lar, cf. a Tanagra figurine at the British Museum shown in Higgins 1986, pp. 136–137, fig. 164, with dis-cussion at p. 123. For a comparable representation of Dionysus, cf. a figurine of the god from Myrina, now at the Louvre, Ammerman 1990, p. 40, fig. 27.Dionysus is closely associated with the Nymphs in both mythology and cult. The Nymphs commonly appear in the god’s iconography as his nursemaids or as participants in his mountain revels (LIMC VIII, 1997, -s.vv. ‘Nymphai’ and ‘Nysa I, Nysai’; Larson 2001, pp. 36–37, 91–96). Conversely Dionysus and his semiferal entourage of Satyrs and Silens are habitual neighbors of the Nymphs in cave shrines. The evidence for this cultic contiguity is abundant; the aforementioned nymphaeum at Aphyte in Macedonia, on the grounds of a major Dionysiac precinct, is one of many examples of how these deities can share the same"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"40chapter 3religious space (p. 27, note 74 above; see also Sporn 2013, pp. 203, 205, 206, 207–208, 209). Although his name does not appear in the local epigraphic record, Dionysus’ pres-ence on the Karapla hill may be inferred from a sympotic reference in Inscription II; see discussion in Chapter 4.2 below. The god was worshipped together with the Nymphs in the nearby city of Atrax; cf. a 3rd century BCE dedica-tion by the local poet Astioun now at the Archaeological Museum in Larissa, SEG 45, 554 (see p. 92 below).

Maximum height (estimated): ± 0,075. Only the middle portion of the mask is preserved, from the neckline to the base of the nose. The face appears to have been an elongated oval resting on a tall neck, with a gently prominent chin and a small, full-lipped mouth turned up at the corners. One ear and part of the headdress are visible to the left. What Levi reports as “a form of the so-called klaft” is a veil as in Cat. nos. 4–5 above (on the iconography of the Egyptianizing veil in Greek protomic art see Uhlenbrock 1989, pp. 142–145); as for the slight swell-ing discernible next to the figure’s temple, it is more likely to be a lock of hair than a fold of fabric.

Despite the advanced state of wear one can still make out such details as the tall diadem with veil and the hair framing the figure’s forehead (somewhat confusingly described by Levi as “tall crown of hair”; the suggestion that this piece could perhaps belong to a relief has also no apparent explanation). The only discernible feature on the face is a swelling corresponding to the nose. Based on the attire, Cat. no. 11 could be assigned to the Late Archaic or Early Classical period.12.

Cat. no. 13 shows the standard number of eight bands; part of one ear is visible beneath the last bandelet to the left. Since no rear view of this head is included in the photo-graphic record, we have no way of telling whether the coif ended with a coil, i.e. in the manner of late fourth century Melonenfrisuren, or a bun, character-istic of later Hellenistic fashion.

The figure shows the crisply outlined fea-tures of Archaic sculptures, with emphatic cheek-bones, a strong nose, and the mouth turned up at the corners in the characteristic smile. Worth noting is the plastic rendition of the eye, with the round pro-jecting pupil which gives the figure an unusually intense gaze. [c] Figs. 52: 2, 61: 2. Fragment from the head of a female statuette, preserved in the face only. Maximum height: ± 0,061 m. The features of this visage—oval outline, long straight nose, and a ‘rosebud’ mouth set above a gently rounded chin—recall those of Cat. nos. 6–7, arguing for a Late Classical or Hellenistic date. The careful design of the statuette, also evident in the treatment of the eyes and the superciliary arches, is proof of the high level of refinement achieved by the Pharsalian coroplasts of the fifth and fourth century.18.

The face is a broad, featureless oval. The hair is parted at the forehead and arranged over the shoulders. According to Levi the figure appears to be reaching at her neckline with the right hand, in a pose similar to the Archaic statuette from Corfu shown in Winter 1903 I, p. 96, no. 8 (cf. no. 7). The traces in the photo from the SAIA archive are too faint to allow further study. Levi suggests to assign Cat. no. 25 to the same period as no. 2, i.e. the late Archaic age.26.

SAIA Photographic Archive: B 334; C 910. Bibliography: Levi 1923–1924, p. 37, figs. 28–28a. Of the four ‘Silenic beards’ listed in Levi’s catalog only two are preserved in the photographic record. The frontal configuration of the two recorded pieces would support their identification as small masks:[a] Fig. 51: 3. Fragment from the lower half of a male clay mask, bearded. Maximum height: ± 0,04 m. Based on what we can see in the photograph, Cat. 28 [a] appears to have been a mask of the solid type, with a flat back. The ogival shape of the beard is consistent with Silenic representations from the Late Archaic and Early Classical periods; see e.g. a terracotta mask at the Museo Provinciale Campano di Capua, no. 99 (LIMC VII, 1994, p. 1126, no. 168, plate 772, s.v. ‘Silenoi’) or the well-known black-figure neck amphora at the Staatlichen Museen in Berlin, F 1671 (ibid. p. 1121, no. 112, plate 764).[b] Fig. 67: 1. Fragment from the lower left half of a male clay mask, bearded. Maximum height (esti-mated): ± 0,038 m. Although Levi describes it as ‘pro-filed’, it is clear from the photograph that this beard belongs to a frontal face similar to [a] above. Part of the lower lip and the moustache are preserved. The beard hairs are rendered as wavy vertical incisions. Votive masks of a size comparable to Cat. no. 28 (i.e. approximately 0,10 m high in their complete form) have been retrieved a few kilometers southwest of our site in the territory of Proerna, see Daffa-Nikonanou 1973, p. 66, ΠΡ 92–93, plate 11, figs. 1–2, with discussion at pp. 130–131. All Proernan examples are depictions of Dionysus, sug-gesting that Cat. no. 28 [a-b] may also have represented this god, and not his ferine followers. Dionysus is of course the quintessential Maskengott of the Greek pantheon; on the use of masks in Dionysiac cult and iconography see the overview in LIMC III (1986) pp. 424–429, nos. 6–61, plates 296–301, s.v. ‘Dionysos’. 29.

Levi, who assigns the fragment to a pinax, fails to report the broad, unworked strip of clay which can be seen projecting from the bottom of the relief (a tenon-like feature?). Also omitted in Levi’s des-crip tion is a tall curved enclosure which frames the figure as in a niche—a feature strongly reminescent of a cave entrance in frontal view. Cf. the raised bor-der in Cat. no. 26 above, which lends itself to a simi-lar interpretation. As for the use of the cave frame in Thessalian votive reliefs see e.g. the plaque from Phtelia cited in the commentary to Inscription II below, lines 5–6 (Volos, Archaeological Museum 573).

The hair is parted on the forehead in two bands. The face, in a fair state of preservation, has large eyes emphasized by well-marked superciliary arches, a small mouth, and a rounded chin. Overall the style of the figure would justify Levi’s dating to the Archaic Age.The sculptural type of the hydrophore—a standing female figure represented in the act of holding a water vessel on her head—is well attested across the Greek world, especially continental Greece and Southern Italy. Usually found in the proximity of water sources, hydro-phore votives may have been associated with purification ceremonies. The type appears in three basic variants, all documented in Thessaly and the Pharsalian territory: (a) figures holding the vessel with one hand; (b) figures holding the vessel with both hands; (c) figures balanc-ing the vessel with no hands. Besides the Karapla cave, the hydrophore holding the vessel with two hands is also attested at Pharsalus (Daffa-Nikonanou 1973, p. 76, ΦΑ 30), Proerna (ibid. p. 69, ΠΡ 9–11), and Ampelia (ibid. pp. 79–80 ΑΜ 23–26). All finds from these sites show traits charac-teristic of the Severe Style (see the discussion in Daffa-Nikonanou 1973, pp. 88–89), except for our no. 30, which may well be the earliest known hydrophore in the area.31.

A female figure sitting on a wingback throne with a small fawn in her right hand. Head and upper body are covered in a cloak which she keeps pinned to her chest with the left hand. Three horizontal creases are visible in the fabric. The hair is parted on the forehead and combed down the sides in a simple, graceful fashion. Except for nose and eyes (which are only discernible in faint outline), the remainder of the face is weath-ered beyond recognition; fig. 59 is an artist’s restora-tion. Date: Early Classical?A nearly identical version of this statuette is listed by Daffa-Nikonanou among the findings from the Pharsalian acropolis, 1973, p. 75, ΦΑ 27, plate 4, fig. 2. Although they reflect a local type not encountered outside Thessaly (Daffa-Nikonanou, ibid. p. 99), the two figurines share a general relationship with the representations of Artemis, particularly some enthroned images associated with the Attic cult of Artemis Brauronia (Brauron, Archaeological Museum K 2646: LIMC II, 1984, p. 671, no. 665, plate 498, s.v. ‘Artemis’). The presence of a markedly Artemisian attribute such as the fawn may indeed be an indication that Cat. no. 33 and its companion were representations of this goddess (a Pharsalian cult of Artemis is confirmed by the dedication of a certain Hageisareta inscribed in local dialect, IThess I, 66). As protectors of maidenhood and female puberty, Artemis and the Nymphs oversaw very similar domains of influence and it would not be surpris-ing to find them side by side in a setting like the Karapla cave. Artemis does not appear in Nymph worship as fre-quently as Pan or Hermes, but parallels for her presence in the rocky abodes of these deities are not completely lacking as it has been sometimes argued (e.g. Larson 2001, pp. 107–110): an appropriate example is the aforemen-tioned nymphaeum of Grotta Caruso in S. Italy, where the existence of ritual practices for Artemis is attested by the statuette of a woman carrying the image of the goddess in procession (Locri, Antiquarium, inv. 580 = Costabile 1991, pp. 192–194, 5.3, fig. 309) as well as the terracotta figurine of a fawn (National Museum of Reggio Calabria, inv. no. unknown = Costabile 1991, pp. 192–194, 5.3, fig. 310). Daffa-Nikonanou also considers the possibility that Cat. no. 33 and the Pharsalian figurine may depict a local deity with powers and iconographical attributes similar to Artemis (1973, p. 99).

A male figure dressed in a knee-long chitoniskos, sit-ting in left profile but with the upper body turned to face the viewer. Head and feet are missing. Part of the chair is visible in the lower half of the relief. The figure is shown in a relaxed posture, leaning back in its seat while holding a kylix with both hands. The date is uncertain: perhaps Early Classical? See dis-cussion below. Levi, who in his time could find no parallels for Cat. no. 34, was rightly puzzled by this unusual piece, expressing doubts even as to its gender. The retrieval of an almost identical relief from the Demetreium of Proerna (Daffa-Nikonanou 1973, p. 72, ΠΡ 173, plate 10, fig. 3; cf. ibid. ΠΡ 174) has since confirmed that the figure in the image is a male, enabling the restoration of the head and other missing parts. The two reliefs appear to reflect a figural type not attested anywhere else. The presence of a kylix and certain postural details such as the figure’s backward ‘slouch’, particularly evident in the Proerna relief, would point to the representation of a banqueteer or a reveller, although the enthroned position seems incongruous with conventional depictions of either subject (banqueteers are shown reclining on couches, as in Cat. no. 35 below, while comasts stand or walk unsteadily, as in a terracotta group from the nymphaeum of Grotta Caruso in S. Italy now at the National Museum of Reggio Calabria (inv. 134 = Costabile 1991, pp. 175–176, 4.7, fig. 282). Based on the drap-ery and other stylistic details, Daffa-Nikonanou believes that the Proerna relief could be assigned to the time of the Severe Style (1971, p. 124).35. Reclining figure.Excavation Inventory no. 58. SAIA Photographic Archive: B 334. Bibliography: Levi 1923–1924, p. 38 fig. 35.Fig. 51: 6. Clay Statuette, broken in the lower half. Maximum height: ± 0,05 m. Maximum width: ± 0,086 m. Upper torso from a figure reclining on its left side. Only the head, part of the chest, and the right arm are extant. The figure, which appears to be unclothed, wears a tall headpiece with the hair loose over the shoulders. The right arm rests along the right side. The head is tilted to the right. Except for the projection of the nose, no other facial features are discernible. The date is uncertain: perhaps early fifth century (see discussion below).The closest parallel for Cat. no. 35 is once again a statuette from the nearby site of Proerna (Daffa-Nikonanou 1971, p. 70, ΠΡ 151, plate 4, fig. 5) showing the reclining figure with a kylix in its right hand. The gender and meaning of these images are unclear: Levi and Daffa-Nikonanou iden-tify the mysterious banqueteer as female, but the possibil-ity that its torso may be unclothed would rather point to a male, perhaps an unbearded Dionysus (or a local hero associated with him; cf. the parallels cited in Guarducci 1962). Regrettably, the clay surface in both statuettes is too worn out to allow any definitive pronouncement. Reclining statuettes of similarly ambiguous interpretation have been found at Corinth and a small handful of other sites (Robinson 1906, pp. 168–170, no. 20, plate XII; Stillwell 1952, p. 104, note 3). Scholars who support their identifica-tion as females have suggested that they could be repre-sentations of courtesans (Sieveking 1937) or the goddess Aphrodite (Robinson 1906)—two possibilities that would account for the presence of nudity. In most cases, how-ever, the bodies of the figures display an ephebic spare-ness that leaves room for ambiguity. For the occurrence of the same figural type at other Nymph caves, see e.g. a stat-uette from Grotta Caruso now at the National Museum of Reggio Calabria, inv. 626 = Costabile 1991, pp. 134–137, 5.3,"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"46chapter 3fig. 220). Based on stylistical grounds, Daffa-Nikonanou proposes to assign the Proerna figurine to the early fifth century BCE (1971, p. 104); most likely Cat. no. 35 belongs to the same period.36. Cloaked figure.Excavation Inventory: no. 59. SAIA Photographic Archive: C 909. Bibliography: Levi 1923–1924, p. 39, fig. 36.Fig. 66: 5. Clay statuette, headless and chipped along the front bottom edge. Maximum height (esti-mated): ± 0,08 m. A figure of unknown gender, tightly enveloped in a cloak. The left flap of the cloak forms a vertical ridge running through the middle of the figure; additional creases in the fabric are visible around the neck and the shoulders. It is unclear if the figure is sitting, as Levi suggests, or squatting. Posture and drapery are reminiscent of some squat-ting figurines of Hermes from Boeotia where the god is also completely enfolded in a cloak; see especially the example in Higgins 1954, p. 222, no. 834, plate 114 (from Lake Copais, now at the British Museum). Date uncertain: perhaps fifth century, as the Boeotian statuette?37. Dancing female figure.Excavation Inventory: no. 60. SAIA Photographic Archive: B 333; C 906. Bibliography: Levi 1923–1924, p. 39, fig. 37. Figs. 50: 2; 62: 1. Lower half from a clay relief (?), also broken along the bottom. Maximum height: ± 0,046 m. A female figure in a flowing gauzy dress, partially preserved from the hips downwards. The figure is shown as moving swiftly to her right, perhaps in the act of dancing (rather than ‘running’, as suggested by Levi). The fabric of her dress clings closely to her left leg, which is flexed at the knee. The rest of the gar-ment unfurls in a series of sweeeping s-shaped folds. Movement and drapery are reminescent of many Attic Nymph reliefs from the Classical and Hellenistic periods where the goddesses appear in dancing tri-ads lead by Hermes. For a comprehensive treatment of this figural type and its antecedents see Edwards 1985; a close parallel for the figure in our fragment is e.g. the middle Nymph in a late fourth century relief now in the Treviso Museum, ibid. pp. 634–637, no. 58, plate 26. Cat. no. 37, as Levi surmises, is likely to be from the same period, although an earlier date is also possible. 38. Fragments of drapery.Excavation Inventory: no. 61.

Height: ± 0.015 m. A youth leaning with his left elbow on a support of unidentified nature (a rock or a tree according to Levi). The figure is nude except for a cloak covering his back from the left shoulder to the right hip. Portions of this cloth are visible on both sides of the figure, draped over each forearm. The off-center posture, with the out-thrust right hip and flexed left leg, are characteristically Praxitelean features which point to a date between the fourth and third centuries. The Neo-Praxitelean type of the leaning ephebe is attested across the Hellenistic world in a broad range of variants. In southeast Thessaly it appears to have been as popular as anywhere else, as shown by Cat. no. 40 and another very similar statuette from the sanctuary of Demeter at Proerna (Daffa-Nikonanou 1973, p. 71, ΠΡ 168, plate 9, fig. 4, with discussion at pp. 123–124). 41.

Head, feet, and most of the arms are missing. The stump of the right arm suggests that this limb was extended, perhaps in order to hold an object which survives in part along the lower left edge of the fragment (a cloak, or some other kind of hanging drapery?). Regrettably the view preserved in the photograph does not allow us to discern any details about the other arm. Faint traces alongside the neck and shoulders area seem to indicate that the figure had some kind of head cover, or that it wore its hair long. The date may be Hellenistic (cf. nos. 40–41 above). Levi identifies Cat. no. 42 as a ‘nude youth’ although there is really no evidence for the gender of this figure other than its vaguely ephebic aspect. If female, Cat. no. 42 could be a ‘boyish’ Aphrodite comparable to British Museum 2494 (Burn and Higgins 2001, p. 173, no. 2494, plate 82), which shows a very similar body type and posture. If male, the range of possibilities widens considerably: youths with the right arm raised appear in a large number of variants, as illustrated by the examples collected in Winter 1903, II, pp. 244, no. 2; 252, no. 10; 357, nos. 6–7.43.

Levi believed that Cat. no. 43 could be a fragment from a male figure; however, both the position of the right hand, characteristic of the female offer-bearer type, and a certain fullness in the statuette’s upper chest would be more com-patible with the representation of a woman. Countless parallels for this type of figurine—a female votary hold-ing a flower, fruit, or other similar offering to her chest—can be found across the Greek world, including locations within a short distance from our cave, such as Proerna and Ampelia (Daffa-Nikonanou p. 62, ΠΡ 27–34; p. 80, ΑΜ 27–31, plates 1–2, with discussion at p. 90).44.

Fragment from a clay statuette, bro-ken on the top, bottom, and right sides; part of the left side appears to be preserved. Maximum height: ± 0,08 m. A young boy, nude, holding onto the arm of a larger figure to his left. The child is shown in a three-quarter view but his head is turned to face the viewer and slightly tilted up. The child’s feet and all of the second figure except for the right arm are missing. Faint traces of the child’s eyes, nose, and mouth are discernible on a full, youthful face. Above the forehead is a thick roll of curls (or perhaps a wreath?), worn smooth. The marked s-curve in the body is suggestive of a date in the Hellenistic Period. As Levi convincingly suggests, Cat. no. 44 may have been part of a group of Eros and Aphrodite similar to the one shown in Winter 1903, II, p. 252, no. 6. The offer-ing of such images to the Nymphs has parallels in other areas of the Greek world; see e.g. ΙΜΤ Κaikos 963 (from Mysia). Clay figurines of Aphrodite, Eros, and other sub-jets of erotic nature were also retrieved in large quanti-ties at the Locrian nymphaeum of Grotta Caruso in S. Italy (Costabile and Tropea in Costabile 1991, pp. 127–150: see especially a statuette of Eros dedicated inside a votive cave model, inv. 508 = ibid. pp. 142–143, fig. 230; cf. pp. 59–60, fig. 91. The votive doves in Cat. no. 57 below would be another indication for the presence of Aphrodite and her associates in the cults of the Karapla hill. In Pharsalus the goddess was worshipped as Aphrodite Peitho (IThess I, 67; Mili 2015, pp. 174–175); a figurine of Eros is also listed among the findings from the acropolis hill (Daffa-Nikonanou 1973, p. 77, ΦΑ 51, plate 12, fig. 1, with discussion at p. 131).

Lower trunk and legs are missing. The creature has a round, protruding belly and a characteristically Silenic visage with a bald forehead, round eyes, and a snub nose. The influence of Socratic portraiture (see discussion below) is sugges-tive of date in Hellenistic or Roman times.Although Levi describes Cat. no. 48 as “Pan playing the double flute”, the distinctive ‘Socratic’ traits of this statu-ette leave no doubt as to its identity as a Silen. Variants of the same figure—a Silen with Socratic features, seated or squatted, shown in the act of playing the double aulos—appear in the archaeological record of major nymphaea such as Phyle (Rhomaios 1906, cols. 108–109) and Grotta Caruso (Tropea and Costabile in Costabile 1991, pp. 161–164, nos. 6–8, 11–12, figs. 261, 265; see also nos. 1–5, 9–10, 13–16 for further variations on the type). A figurine similar to ours is also listed by Daffa-Nikonanou among the votive terracot-tas from the Demetreium of Proerna (p. 72, ΠΡ 176, plate 10, fig. 6; discussion at pp. 128–129). On the popularity of the pot-bellied, squatting Silen type from the Archaic period onwards see LIMC VIII (1997) pp. 1114, s.v. ‘Silenoi’. 49. Seated Pan. Excavation Inventory: no. 72. SAIA Photographic Archive: B 332, 335–336; C 909. Bibliography: Levi 1923–1924, p. 40, fig. 44. Figs. 49: 4, 52: 12, 53: 10, 66: 6. Clay statuette, broken on the bottom. Maximum height (estimated): ± 0,088 m. Pan, pot-bellied and ithyphallic, sits with his legs crossed (?) playing his syrinx. The lower part of the legs is missing. The god has rounded ears and a pair of small horns growing from the top of his skull. Facial features, beard, as well as the syrinx which he holds up to his mouth with both hands, are weathered almost beyond recognition. The date is uncertain. The stiff posture would point to a the ear-lier part of the Classical Period.As Levi observes, Cat. no. 49 belongs to a figural type widely attested in votive art. Seated Pans—with their legs up, crossed, or dangling—appear in the terracotta deposits of many Nymph shrines, including the caves of Phyle (Rhomaios 1906, col. 109), Penteli (Zoridis 1977, p. 9, plate Z: δ), Eleusis (Travlos 1960, plate 42 β), and Grotta Caruso (Tropea and Costabile in Costabile 1991, pp. 152–161, nos. 1–9, 12, 31, figs. 245–250, 255). Beyond the coroplastic medium, the type is also common in relief and full-round sculpture (Wagman 2000, pp. 38–41, notes 35–37; cf. Edwards 1985, pp. 68–70; LIMC VIII, 1997, s.v. ‘Pan’). In Thessaly the only example of a seated Pan com-parable to Cat. no. 49 is found in a relief from Scotussa showing the Goat God in the company of three Nymphs (Volos, Archaeological Museum inv. Λ 764 = Heinz 1998, pp. 314–315, no. 254, plate 195, with discussion at pp. 142–143). Otherwise, all other evidence for Pan in Thessalian sacred art appears to be concentrated in the hill country southwest of Pharsalus, at the Karapla cave (see Chapter 4.2 below, commentary to Inscription II, lines 5–6, 18) and the nearby city of Proerna; see a clay statuette from the"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"49The Votiveslocal Demetreium showing the god with a poppy flower in his hand, Daffa-Nikonanou 1973, p. 72, ΠΡ 175, plate 10, fig. 4.

As for the markedly pastoral character of the lands between Pharsalus and Proerna, an aspect which would be consistent with Pan’s presence in the area, see pp. 16–17 above. 50.

These sites yielded significant quantities of animal figurines, includ-ing statuettes and miniature reliefs of pigs, goats, cattle, horses, and turtles. Doves and other animals appear in the votive deposits of many Nymph shrines, e.g the Corycian cave (Amandry 1984, p. 403), Pitsa (EAA 6, 1965, pp. 200–206, s.v. ‘Pitsa’), Daphni (Travlos 1937, p. 406, no. 24, fig. 26), and Ithaca (Benton 1938–1939, p. 42, no. 60, plate 22, no. 60), among others. The dedication of doves at these sites may have been associated with ritual practices for Aphrodite (cf. e.g. the dove sacrifices performed at the Athenian Aphrodisia, IG II2, 659 = LSCG 39, pp. 73–74; Simon 1930, pp. 48–51); for the possible presence of the goddess on the Karapla Hill see also Cat. no. 44 above (35, 42?). Based on comparison with dated material from Boeotia (e.g. Burrows and Ure 1907–1908, p. 295, no. 260), Daffa-Nikonanou assigns the doves from Proerna and Ampelia to the Late Archaic Age. The figurines in Cat. no. 58 are likely to be from the same period. 58. Fragments from various statuettes.Excavation Inventory: no. 87. SAIA Photographic Archive: no records available.

To the left are traces of other letters (ΒΑ?) and an object of uncertain nature which is possibly the Macedonian helmet visible on better-preserved specimens of the same coin.Cat. no. 67 belongs to a well-known coin series ascribed to the Macedonian dynast Antigonus II Gonatas. Most numismatic references also concur in identifying the fig-ure on the reverse with Pan, based on the role that this god is said to have played in Antigonus’ early military successes (battle of Lysimacheia: e.g. Mørkholm 1991, p. 134; see however Pritchett 1974, pp. 32–34). Although Levi challenges this assessment, claiming that the tail and the human legs are more suggestive of a satyr than the Goat God (cf. Mionnet 1806, p. 581, no. 854), the frequent presence of a pedum on other coins from the same series is clearly in support of the commonly accepted identifi-cation with Pan. This deity appears to have had a special significance for Antigonus, as shown by another coin emis-sion by the same king, the well-known silver tetradrachm with Pan’s head within a Macedonian shield (Head 1911, p. 231, fig. 143; Mørkholm 1991, no. 430). Cf. also the hymn to Pan composed for Antigonus by the poet Aratus (Vita Arati 3= Scholia in Aratum vetera p. 15 Martin. Cf. Vita 1 = ibid. p. 9). A group of 25 coins of the same type as Cat. no. 67 were retrieved at New Halos on the Pagasetic gulf (ca. 45 km southeast of our cave) in the area of the so-called SE Gate; see Reinders 2003, pp. 232–233. Stone Objects (68; see also 77 below)68. Fragment from a large female figure. Excavation Inventory: ?SAIA Photographic Archive: no records available. Bibliography: Levi 1923–1924, p. 33.In Levi’s words, “a fragment of tooled stone, appar-ently from a female garment, attesting to the exis-tence of a large cult image or perhaps a more substantial votive offering”. No further information is given as to the size of the fragment, the type of stone, or other details. With few exceptions (namely the items studied by Marcadé at the Corycian cave, 1984, pp. 307–337, nos. 7–8, 10–21), stone statuary is extremely rare at Nymph shrines, and even rarer are statues that can be identified as cult images within any degree of plausibility (Larson 2001, p. 230; Sporn 2007, pp. 51–54 and 2010, pp. 564–565; see also Mylonopoulos 2010 on the issues concerning the distinc-tion between ‘cult’ and ‘votive’ images). Based on Levi’s meagre description it seems unlikely that Cat. no. 68 would have contributed any new evidence to this latter question; nonetheless, the presence of a large stone sculpture at a site like the Karapla cave is a fact worth noting. Pliny HN 34, 68 credits the fifth century sculptor Telephanes for a much-praised statue of the Nymph Larissa, but does not provide any information as to the size and function of the work (on Telephanes’ possible association with Pharsalus, see Lavva 2001, pp. 85–98).4 Appendix: Unpublished Objects Unpublished Objects from Photographs in the SAIA Archive (69–75)69.

The hair is rendered as a continuous band of small curls framing her forehead and temples. The face shows the graceful features typical of Hellenistic female figurines—a long, straight nose set above a small mouth and a round, prominent chin. The remaining anatomy is not as straightforward— possibly on account of the veil enveloping the fig-ure’s upper body or simply as a result of wear. Immediately below the neckline it is possible to see two small swellings, round and set close together, which could be interpreted as breasts except for their implausibly high position. The sloping of the shoulders also seems slightly odd. One wonders if these idiosyncratic traits in the lower part of the fig-ure could be due to the fact that Cat. no. 71 was per-haps a small bust. Without autopsy or additional photographic evidence it is difficult to assess the situation.72. Hydrophore. Excavation Inventory: ?SAIA Photographic Archive: B 333; C 906.

Given the remote location of most Nymph caves, portability may have been an additional factor affecting the size and/or material of the votives. Thus, it should come as no surprise if the votive deposits from most country shrines consist primarily of pottery and terracottas (figurines, plaques), with moderate quantities of small to medium-sized stone objects (reliefs, inscribed stelae), and even fewer quan-tities of metal gifts ( jewelry, miniatures, domestic and cultic apparatus). Similarly we should not be surprised if some sites appear to ‘specialize’ in a specific votive cat-egory, with certain types of gift occurring in significantly larger quantities than others, or display what we may call ‘personalized’ archaeological profiles, due to the presence of atypical artifacts inseparably linked to the specific per-sonalities of local donors and supporters.10 The size and variety of each shrine’s collection were largely dependant on local tradition as well as the peculiarities of local geog-raphy, economy, and demographics. Nonetheless, one must be careful not to overstate the localized character of cave cults, as on occasion we do come upon sites that present us with a collection of transregional scope and size. The cave of the Corycian Nymphs near Delphi is a significant case in point.11Reconsidered in this context, the artifacts from the Karapla cave no longer seem ‘scarce’ or ‘humble’, but prove to be consistent, overall, with the archaeological yield from most Nymph shrines and the devotional nature of the god-desses’ cult. In the preceding pages the many references to comparable findings in Pharsalus, Ampelia, and Proerna, show that the Karapla terracottas are representative of a local coroplastic tradition that had already reached a considerable level of refinement by the time the cave was given a new landscaped form in the early 5th century BCE. Common artifacts from this period include statuettes, plaques, and especially protomes. Except for a few bird figurines and silen masks (Cat. nos. 57; 28), nearly all are female representations—depictions of the Nymphs and 10 Such tendencies towards ‘specialization’ and ‘personalization’ are apparent, for example, at the nymphaeum of Kafizin on Cyprus, where the bulk of the votives consists almost solely of pots decorated with the portrait of the cave founder, Onesagoras (Mitford 1980). 11 Cf. Sporn 2007, pp. 61–62; 2010, p. 558. On the link between the Corycian Nymphs and Delphic Apollo: Amandry 1984, pp. 398–401; cf. 1981, p. 29. Even when we take its proximity to Delphi into due account, the Corycian cave stands as a powerful reminder of how deceptive it can be to interpret cave shrines as “only the objects of humble or strictly local piety” (Sourvinou-Inwood 1998, p. 3, criticizing views expressed by de Polignac 1984).effect of damping their enthusiasm. With its allusions to the wealth and beauty of the shrine’s votive collections, Inscription II had created expectations which Levi’s cat-alog simply could not match. The disappointment sur-rounding the results of the excavation is exemplified by the words with which A. della Seta, then Director of the Italian Archaeological School at Athens, concludes his report on the School activities of 1921–1922:It is almost sad that grounds overlooking a plain which witnessed one of history’s greatest battles only yielded such scarce remains of the humblest folk religion (1922–1923, pp. 284–285).Yet when we reconsider the Karapla collection in light of the material from all other Nymph caves excavated since the 1920’s it is apparent how misguided della Seta’s assessment was. Excavations have confirmed that, far from being a literary construct, the practice of honoring the rural gods with small, inexpensive gifts was as much a reality of Greek religious life as were the statues and mon-umental precincts of the major deities. This devotional tradition of the “rustic votive” (Larson 2001, p. 227) was not confined to country folk but extended to all strata of the Greek population, urban as well as rural, irrespective of wealth or social status.7 Naturally infused with the pres-ence of the deity, sacred woods and caves did not require the use of cult images as manmade shrines usually did.8 The pace itself of rural religion, with its emphasis on fre-quent, spontaneous offerings as opposed to more widely spaced, organized ones, did not support elaborate dedi-cations. Perishable offerings (flowers, greenery, and first fruits from the surrounding environment), were the most common gifts alongside amateurish creations in wood, stone, or clay.9 Commercially manufactured objects, espe-7 What J.M. Redfield writes about clay plaques could be extended to a large number of equally small dedications, “To present a pinax, it seems, was something like lighting a candle to the Madonna—a modest act in which the rich came down to the level of the humble” (2003, p. 352). Modesty in votive gifts is recommended by Plato: “As regards votive offerings to the gods, it is proper for a reasonable man to present offerings of reasonable value” (Lg. 955e, transl. Bury).

Traditional icono-graphical types, such as hydrophores (Cat. nos. 30–31, 72) or enthroned goddesses (Cat. nos. 3, 69), appear alongside more unusual subjects, such as the single female figure enclosed within a cave frame (Cat. nos. 26 and 29). The most notable product is unquestionably Cat. no. 4. Rightly praised by Levi for its artistic quality, this small protomic mask foreshadows the well-known series of Classical pro-tomae discovered in Pharsalus in 1966. The latter kind of luxury protomae12 make their own appearance at the cave around the mid-fifth century (Cat. no. 5), suggesting that the shrine was not only patronized by the nearby peas-antry, as has often been assumed, but attracted a more diverse clientele consisting of both city and country folk as well as people from different economic backgrounds (the presence of fragments from a large size stone image, Cat. no. 68, and a metal vase, Cat. no. 66. is also instructive in this regard). The recurring similarities with the types, if not the quantities, of votive objects recovered from the votive deposits of the Pharsalian acropolis, indeed rein-force the view that the socioeconomic profile of some of the Karapla visitors may not have been too much unlike that of the people worshipping at this more centrally located precinct. From the later part of the fifth century through Hellenistic times, small to medium size statuettes and reliefs prevail as the most common form of votive art at the site. As in the previous period, good quality sculptures appear next to products of more modest artistic value. Regrettably the fragmentary condition of most pieces does not allow any detailed analysis. During this time we also note a more balanced distribution between female and male representations, as opposed to the near-totality of female images recorded for the Archaic Period [Charts 2–3]. Levi has advanced the suggestion that the various ephebic figures in Praxitelean style found at the site (Cat. nos. 40–42; cf. Levi 1922–1923, p. 42) could be depictions of Pan, but there really is no evidence in support of this possibility. The Goat God is otherwise well represented on the Karapla hill, with conventional figurines of very plain craftmanship (Cat. no. 49), as well as images of a more sophisticated conception (Cat. no. 50). Of all the remaining divinities depicted, or possibly depicted, in the Karapla collection (Artemis: Cat. no. 32? Aphrodite: Cat. nos. 42? 44? Hermes: Cat. nos. 51, 19? 36? Dionysus: Cat. nos. 8? 28?), Dionysus and his retinue of Silens and Satyrs are otherwise the most prominent, according to a pattern noted in other Nymph shrines across the Greek 12 On the high quality of the Pharsalian protomae see e.g. Stamatopoulou 2007a, p. 324. world. Dionysiac figures appear early at the cave (Cat. no. 28), continuing into Classical and Hellenistic times with some statuettes of notable artistic skill (Cat. no. 8). As in the previous period, the Nymphs are the subject of most images, appearing in a variety of conventional attitudes: standing, dancing, or engaged in some form of ritual activ-ity. And as before, it is often difficult to distinguish them from their worshippers. The latter problem is also encoun-tered in the study of the male representations. The ephe-bic figurines mentioned above (Cat. nos. 40–42) could be images of a youthful god or daimon, or of young human votaries, possibly connected with a coming of age ritual.13 Worth noting, among so many depictions of adolescence, is the one adult male figure in the entire Catalog (Silens excepted), the enigmatic seated man with a kylix in his hands (Cat. no. 34).Chronologically, the votives are distributed across sev-eral hundred years from Archaic to Hellenistic and Roman times. A number of objects date to the late sixth-early fifth century BCE, suggesting that the cult was in exis-tence before the shrine was landscaped and architectur-ally enriched in the first half of the fifth century (Chapter 4.1 below). The presence of two kourotrophic figurines in Geometric style, Cat. no. 1 a-b, could even push the ori-gins of the worship farther back in time;14 however, as Levi observed, in the absence of other Geometric remains at the sanctuary, it would be imprudent to use this material as evidence for early dating . Based on the dilapidated condition of the extant pieces,15 it seems reasonable to conclude that, in addi-tion to the gifts of perishable material, a good portion of all other votives in the Karapla collection was also lost to the ravages of nature and humankind. As we have seen, the majority of the items were on display outside the cave proper, in the open air section of the sanctuary. Given the sloping, exposed nature of the site, it is not difficult 13 Ephebic figurines similar to Cat. nos. 40–42 appear at the Sanctuary of the Chthonic Nymphs at Cyrene, posing the same problem of interpretation; see Micheli and Santucci 2000, pp. 172–178, nos. 614–881, plates 40–46; cf. pp. 98–99, figs. 13–14. The Libyan nymphaeum also yielded several statuettes of clothed males—including bearded ones—which are not attested at our site. See the discussion by Santucci, ibid. pp. 81–115, who believes that these images represent of the local Nymphs.14 A well-known passage from Plutarch on the Lelantine war (Arist. fr. 98 Rose) attests to the prominence of Pharsalus in Late Geometric times. The archaeological evidence for this period consists mostly of burials in the city’s west cemetery, on which see above, p. 16, note 122. 15 Cf. especially the pottery, apparently too fragmentary to be properly inventoried (Cat. no. 60)."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"56chapter 3to imagine the ruin brought upon these artifacts by the storms of the Thessalian wet season (p. 7 above) after the shrine was no longer maintained. Occasional seismic events (pp. 4–5; 18, note 6 above) and centuries of unregu-lated human and animal use played their own part in the degradation of the cave’s archaeological patrimony. Yet, when we think of the depleted state of other Thessalian cave shrines, such as the aforementioned sites of Krounia and Mt. Ossa, the fact that Levi was still able to unearth a substantial votive deposit in the terrace below the cave speaks a lot about the size of the original collection. The relative absence of any figured pottery or sufficiently pre-served stone sculpture among the material which has survived has long kept scholars from appreciating the Karapla objects for the light that they shed on local coro-plastic tradition. Thanks to the mid-twentieth century discoveries in Pharsalus town, Ampelia, and Proerna we are now able to re-examine Levi’s findings in their proper context. The future publication of the several hundreds terracottas unearthed in rescue excavations at Pharsalus during the last twenty-five years16 should enrich this con-text even further. 6 Charts16 p. 10, note 73 above.

This area occupies a recessed part of the wall enclosed above and to the right by a raised edge. Some of the text in the right margin of the inscrip-tion runs over this natural frame (lines 2–4). Except for these few letters, which are shallow and almost no longer visible today, the rest of the inscription is neatly cut and free of damage. The lettering shows the characteristic wavering 1 Della Seta 1922–1923, p. 284; Levi 1923–1924 p. 27.

After Φ Decourt reads a right-angled oblique which he prefers to render as a dotted Ν.5–6: although no physical damage appears to have occurred, the last two lines of the inscription defy any attempt at interpretation. Line 6 ends impossibly with a pi, while the remaining ten letters in the text stubbornly resist organization in coherent word sequences. As shown in the next section, much ink has been spilled in trying to make sense of this part of Inscription I. The third letter in line 5 is debated: some editors read a tilted delta as in line 3 (Giannopoulos, Comparetti, Moore), others (Hiller, Peek, Maas, Gallavotti, Decourt) prefer to print rho. “For the rho in the shape of French capital D” Decourt invites to compare IG IX 2, 151: the sign in line 5 has however the same markedly angular quality of the delta in line 3, of which is almost an exact replica.5 At the end of the line, the letter previously printed by Giannopoulos as an epsi-lon is better restored as a xi on the evidence of Peek’s squeeze (although Peek himself prefers to interpret this sign as a punctuation mark). After this sign, past an inter-vening space, Decourt believes he can discern the traces of an additional epsilon but the reading, as he admits, is far from certain. Some debate also arises over the first let-ter in line 6. Interpreted by most as a phi, this sign does not show as deeply cut a crossbar a s the phi in line 4, prompt-ing Peek to consider theta as a more plausible option.6 There can be no doubt that Inscription I shows a num-ber of puzzling aspects. The relatively good quality of the lettering seems in contrast with the way this engraver repeatedly runs over the right margin of the inscription 5 A rho of the kind described by Decourt is not listed in Jeffery’s table of Thessalian letterforms (1990 p. 96, fig. 29), nor was I able to find evidence for it elsewhere. The alleged D-shaped rho in IG IX 2, 151 belongs to an early reading of the inscription discarded by Hiller in favor of the widely attested delta by the same shape ( Jeffery 1990, p. 96, fig. 29: δ2). See Α̣ ΝΟDΥ (Ἀνόδου[ν]?) for AD 4 (1901) p. 7, no. 11 ΙΝΟΡΟΥ in IG IX 2, 151, line 1. 6 1938, pp. 21–22.(three times in a text of only six lines). While ON at the end of line 2 can be explained as the correction of an over-sight, there seems to be no evident reason for the textual overflow at the end of lines 4–5. With all the space avail-able to him, we cannot but wonder why our mason has resorted to using the unpolished surface to the right of the inscriptional field. A further reason for puzzlement is the way the text apparently breaks off in the last line. Since there is no evidence for physical damage we must con-clude that this was also the text which presented itself to readers in antiquity. Were the ancient visitors of the sanc-tuary as perplexed as we are? Very likely one of the reasons for the engraving of Inscription II was to provide pilgrims and passersby with a guide to the interpretation of these ancient carvings. Similar initiatives were not unknown to the managers of Greek sanctuaries, who encouraged visi-tor interest in ‘sacred relics’ and the traditions associated with them. A pertinent example is that of the inscriptions in “Cadmean letters” seen by Herodotus on some votive tripods at the shrine of Ismenian Apollo in Thebes:7 these texts, which named mythological heroes Amphitryon and Laodamas among the dedicators of the tripods, appear to have been a later addition by Ismenium officials—evi-dently for the purpose of educating onlookers about the origin of the votives. “Perhaps” writes J.W. Day, “early in the sixth century, the local authorities inscribed them, proba-bly as labels to explain an oral tradition that had grown up about the tripods. The link between the real dedicators’ names and their offerings had disappeared—a serious diminution of renown in a society which valued competi-tive display very highly”.8 In the case of Inscription I, the 7 “I have myself seen Cadmean writing in the temple of Ismenian Apollo at Thebes of Boeotia engraved on certain tripods and for the most part looking like Ionian letters. On one of the tripods there is this inscription: ‘Amphitryon dedicated me from the spoils of Teleboae’. This would date from about the time of Laius the son of Labdacus, grandson of Polydorus and great-grandson of Cadmus. A second tripod says, in hexameter verse: ‘Scaeus the boxer, victorious in the contest,  gave me to Apollo, the archer god, a lovely offering.’ Scaeus the son of Hippocoon, if he is indeed the dedicator and not another of the same name, would have lived at the time of Oedipus son of Laius. The third tripod says, in hexameter verse again: ‘Laodamas, while he reigned, dedicated this cauldron  to Apollo, the sure of aim, as a lovely offering’ ” (Hdt. 5, 59–61 transl. Godley).8 1994, p. 40. The characterization of these texts as ‘labels’ is Stephanie West’s: “Dedicatory inscriptions are an early and obvious applica-tion for writing, and we need feel no surprise if the guardians of the Ismenion decided to add such dedications to objects tradition-ally associated with local heroes, not, probably, with any intention to deceive the visitor, but rather as the curator of a museum might attach informative labels to the objects in his charge”, 1985, p. 292."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"59The Inscriptions: inscription ibuilder of the Karapla cave did not forgo to sign his work, but the omission of any other information and the obscu-rities in the second half of the text created the need for an additional inscription revealing the full story of the sanc-tuary and its founder.Another aspect of Inscription I which calls for com-ment is its position. With all the inscribing surface avail-able at the site, it is unclear why this text should have been engraved ca. 3 m above ground. A plausible answer is that it had to be physically near the ‘work’ it was associatedOn the reception of early alphabetic inscriptions by the later Greeks see also the discussion in J. Boardman’s study on ‘the archaeology of nostalgia’, 2002, pp. 93–95.with (line 3 τόδ’ ἔργον). This, as it will be argued below, was probably the stairway that climbed up to upper level of the sanctuary immediately to the right of the inscrip-tion. It is reasonable to assume that Pantalces carved the dedication after the construction was completed, work-ing from the middle steps of the stairway. Even from this elevated position, however, access to the inscriptional panel appears very limited today [Figs. 13–14]. We must conclude that either the area has undergone some physi-cal change from antiquity or a scaffold was used.9Pantalces dedicated this work to the goddesses. The laurel. . . 9 At the cave of the Nymphs of Phyle, a large number of cuttings for the insertion of votive displays are placed at a height of well above 2 m from the ground. Especially striking is the placement, high up in the curvature of the cave entrance, of a rock-cut inscrip-tion recording the dedication of a votive image to Pan by a certain Trophimianus and his partner (IG II2, 4829: full citation at p. 63 below). The elevated position of these markings confirms that lad-ders or scaffolding were used by the stonecutters employed at the site. For a physical description of IG II2, 4829 see Skias 1918, p. 19 (who does not report, however, on the exact height of the inscrip-tion from the ground).1.2 Text and Translation Παντάλκε̄ς ἀνέθε̄κε θεαῖς τόδ’ ἔργον. τὰν δὲ δάφ⟨ν⟩αν5 ΑΕΔΑΠΑΞ Φ̣ ΑΝΠ3 τόδ’ ἔργον legit Peek: τόδ[ε τὸ ἄντρον] Giannopoulos, τὸ δέ[νδρον] Comparetti. 4 τὰν δὲ δάφ⟨ν⟩αν e lectione ΔΑΦΑΝ supplevit Peek: τὰν δὲ δάφ[ναν] Giannopoulos, τὰν δὲ δάφν̣[αν] Decourt, τάνδε δ’ἀφάν Gallavotti. 5–6 versus Pelasgicis notis scriptos aexistimavit Giannopoulos: emendaverunt ἆ[ι] ἑδ’ ἀπ’ ἀέ[θλον] | Φάν[ι]π[πος] Comparetti, ἀε(ρ)ρ’ ἄ(π)παξ | Φανῆ ̣ ι ̣ vel Φανῆτι Gallavotti, ἄερ’ ἀπάξ[ας] | ὁ ἀνπ(ελουργός) Hiller, ἄερ’ Ἀγαθάνγ(ελος) Maas apud Peek, ἄερ’ Ἀθ̣αν⟨ί⟩ππα ≠ Peek, ἄε⟨ι⟩δ’ ἅπαξ | ΦΑΝΠ Moore, ἄερ ἅπαξ Ε | ΦΑΝΠ Decourt."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"60chapter 4scholar to address the question of Inscription I’s alleged metrical nature is B.

Unattested in the literary sources, Παντάλκης appears only once more in an agonistic inscription from nearby Larissa, IG IX 2, 529, lines 7 and 21, Διότιμος Παντάλκου. Outside of Thessaly we hear of a C. Claudius Pantalces in a Roman epi-taph of the first or second century CE (CIL 6, 15622 = Solin 2003, p. 140). As in the rest of Greece, compounded names beginning with παντ- or παν- are not lacking in Thessaly, see e.g. the conceptually similar Παντάπονος also attested at Larissa in the patronymic adjectives Πανταπόνειος, SEG 35, 606, line 2, and Πανταπονεία, IG IX 2, 571, line 2; SEG 35, 591, line 8 (LGPN III B, s.v.

Much less frequent in Thessalian onomastics are the occurrences of αλκ- in the second part of compounds; see the isolated example of Πολ]ύαλκος in a dedication from Pharsalus of the early 4th century BCE, IThess I, 77, line 3 = LGPN III B, s.v. Πολύαλκος (versus the various appearances of Πολυάλκης elsewhere, e.g. IG II2, 1818, line 11, and 12481; IMilet I 3, 147, line 100). On the identification of Thessalian anthroponyms in general, see García Ramón 1999, pp. 523 ff. and 2007, pp. 65–66).Pantalces, ‘The All-Powerful’, is almost too perfect a name for the vigorous builder described in Inscription II not to raise some suspicion as to its historical authentic-ity; see e.g. Comparetti 1923–1924, p. 152. On the opposite side of those who believe Pantalces to be a fictional char-acter, is however an overall majority who recognize in him the vivid and convincing reflection of a real personality; see e.g. Powell and Barber 1929, Larson 2001 and, more recently, Pache 2011. In fact there is nothing suspicious about the name of the dedicant in Inscription I, just as his ‘portrait’ in Inscription II has very little to do with the his-torical Pantalces. The two inscriptions, as it will be argued below, are best studied as independent (if intertextually linked) documents.×‒⏑‒× (‒⏑⏑‒⏑⏑‒ ×‒⏑‒×) differs from Gallavotti’s “hem+reiz” (‒⏑⏑‒⏑⏑‒ ×‒⏑⏑‒×).14 1994, p. 15.1.3 Metrical ConspectusThe question of whether or not we can regard this text as metrical depends on the more general issue of where we draw the dividing line between prose and verse in Greek inscriptions.10 I provide here the rythmical scheme of Inscription Ι followed by an overview of the main schol-arly offerings: ‒ ‒ ‒ ⏑ ⏑ ‒ ⏑ ⏑ ‒ ⏑ ‒ ‒ ‒ ⏑ ‒ ‒ 5 ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ ‒ ‒If lyric metres are to be considered for the identification of metrical inscriptions, the first three lines of our text (‒ ‒ ‒ ⏑ ⏑ ‒ ⏑ ⏑ ‒ ⏑ ‒ ‒) show an obvious affinity with Aeolic rhythm, namely with the verse known in antiquity as logaoedic (or Praxillean, from one of its variants used by the 5th century BCE Sicyonian poetess Praxilla).11 The basic form is (⏔) (‒⏑⏑) ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑‒ ⏑‒‒.12 Scholars agreeing with this view include Peek, Gallavotti, and Moore.Not as straightforward is the rhythm in the second half of the inscription, the metrical analysis of which neces-sarily varies according to the restorations adopted by indi-vidual scholars. Peek, who rearranges lines 5–6 to read implausibly ἄερ’ Ἀθ̣αν⟨ί⟩ππα, presents us with a sequence consting of one epitrite followed by an iambic sequence and a spondee. By reading the same lines as ἀε(ρ)ρ’ ἄ(π)παξ Φανῆ ̣ ι ̣, Gallavotti obtains an equally implausible sense but improved metrical results, with a rhythm very much akin to that of the first half of the inscription, ‒ ⏑ ⏑ ‒ ‒ ‒ ‒ ‒ ⏑ ‒. In the reconstruction proposed by the Italian Classicist, Inscription I is interpreted as consisting of an elegiambic couplet with catalexis in the second verse (‒‒ ‒⏑⏑‒⏑⏑‒ ⏑ ‒‒ | ‒⏑⏑ ‒‒ ‒‒ ‒⏑ ‒˰).13 The most recent 10 At one end of the debate we find scholars like P.A. Hansen who would not recognize as metrical any inscriptions down to 400 BCE which were not composed in dactylic hexameters, pentam-eters, or iambic trimeters (1975). A less strict editorial attitude is advocated by C. Gallavotti, who interprets many of the texts excluded by Hansen as composed of lyric cola (1979). For the problems with Gallavotti’s analyses see Hansen 1984, and, for a sensible assessment of Hansen’s own work (from an epigra-phist’s point of view), the review by Day 1985.11 Heph. p. 24, 8 Consbruch.

West’s analysis of this verse, D"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"61The Inscriptions: inscription igrowing at the base of the cliff and the massive rock-hewn stairs leading up to the cave. Inscription II confirms that this was also the situation in antiquity. This text describes the foundation of the Karapla sanctuary as the result of two basic landscaping acts, the planting of a sacred grove (line 12) and the building of a stairway to the cave (line 15). If the depiction of the former is formulaic, the construction of the stairs is portrayed in a strikingly expressive style: could it be possible that this ‘way up’ to the shrine, cut into the live rock of the hill, is the ἔργον which Pantalces’ dedication refers to?The placement of the inscription halfway up the ascent to the cave, on the cliff wall directly above the stairway’s third step, certainly supports this hypothesis. A simi-lar situation is found in the cave of Archedamus at Vari, where a rock-cut stairway in the west chamber of the cave is ‘signed’ with the builder’s ‘signature’ engraved near the landing step (IG I3, 978 = Schörner and Goette 2004, p. 50, no. 7, plate 34, map 3: g). The centrality of these stepped structures in the architectural and cultic layout of both sites is undeniable: at Karapla as well as Vari the stairs facil-itate the worshipper’s access to areas of the temenos oth-erwise difficult to reach; moreover, they serve in the way of sacred paths, routing the worshipper’s visit through the different ritual stations found at each shrine—chapels, altars, offering tables, votive displays (p. 28 above). At the Karapla this second aspect is made explicit by Inscription II, which ends with an invitation for the visitors to go up the stairway and use the facilities of the upper sanctuary to sacrifice and enjoy themselves (lines 20–22). In light of these considerations, it seems thus reasonable to conclude that stairs constituted a dedication no less plausible than other architectural structures. For the offering of architec-tural works to the Nymphs, also qualified as ἔργα, see e.g. a Sicilian inscription from Catania, IG XIV, 453, face A.1, βαιὸν ἐμὲ Νύμφαις ἔργον κάμ[εν - - - - - - -] | οὐ γάρ μοι σθεναρὴν χεῖρ’ ἐπε [- - - - - - -] | ἀλλ’ ἐν ἐμοὶ καμάτων εὗρεν τέλ[ος, εὗρε δὲ τύμβον] | ἀγχόθι λαινέης αὔλακος ὑδρο[φόρου], | τὴν αὐτὸς ποίησεν ἐς ἠέρα πολλ[ὸν ἀείρας] | νᾶμα φέρειν καθαρὸν ἐνναέται[ς Κατάνης]. | Ἐννοΐου. Nymphs are often associ-ated with the building of waterworks, cf. e.g. an inscrip-tion from Megara of 408–412 BCE, IG VII, 93, Ἑρκόλιον τὸν ἔπαρχον ἀνέστησαν Μεγαρῆε̣[ς] | παντοίω[ν ν]η̣ ́σω<ν> καὶ πόλεων φύλακα. | τείχεα δείματ̣ο κ̣αὶ π̣ [όρ]ον ἔμπεδον ὤπα<σ>ε Νύμφ[αις], | ἄστεα καὶ βουλὰς πλη̣ ̑σε̣ βροτῶν σοφίῃ. 4–6 τὰν δὲ δάφ⟨ν⟩αν | ΑΕΔΑΠΑΞ | Φ̣ ΑΝΠIt is the nearly unanimous opinion of scholars that the second half of Inscription I concerns the offering of a lau-rel by a dedicator other than Pantalces. However, except for the words τὰν δὲ δάφ⟨ν⟩αν or τάνδὲ δάφ⟨ν⟩αν in line 4, 2–3 ἀνέθε̄κε | θεαῖςPantalces uses the simplest of dedicatory formulas (ὁ δεῖνα ἀνέθηκε τῷ δεῖνι), offering no information as to the nature of the dedication or the circumstances which prompted it. He even omits to identify by name the “goddesses” honored by his gesture. While not unparalleled, this dis-regard for specifics seems slightly at odds with the well-known propensity of private cult founders for carefully documenting their deeds (see e.g. Van Straten 1993, pp. 260–261 on Artemidorus of Perge). Evidently Pantalces had no reason to be concerned about ambiguity: a cult of the Nymphs must have existed at the cave long before he introduced the architectural improvements which we see there today. Not only were these goddesses the primary spirits of the place; they also were the only female plu-rality that would qualify as θεαί in the group of divinities listed in Inscription II. As for the nature of the dedication, the use of deictic τόδ’ implies that it could be identified by its spacial relationship to the inscription (commentary to line 3 below). For this type of dedicatory language, which relies on context as much as verbal communication, we can compare a votive statuette of Pan from the Epidaurian Asclepieum bearing the inscription τῷ θεῷ | Δαρδάνιος (IG IV2 1, 466): in this case the fact that the text is inscribed on the object itself leaves no doubt on the nature of the dedication; not as straightforward, on the other hand, is the identity of the dedicatee, who could be Pan him-self or Asclepius. For another example of dedicatory text where the Nymphs are simply referred to as θεαί, see the dedication of a screen or door (?) from the Nymph cave of Budrasc in Cyrenaica, SEG 9, 727, τὰς θυρίδας | Ζώπυρος | ἀνέθηκε ταῖς | θεαῖς.3 τόδ’ ἔργονOpinions differ as to what Pantalces’ dedication might have been. Giannopoulos, who does not read any letters beyond τόδ’, understands this demonstrative to mean the cave itself, 1919, p. 51. Stählin believes instead that τόδ(ε) indicated a pinax placed directly above the inscription (in an area of the rock where he identified a cutting for the insertion of a votive, 1924, p. 144). Along the same lines, Croenert proposes to restore τόδ’[ἀμεμφὲς ἄγαλμα], while Comparetti prefers τὸ δέ[νδρον], from comparison with Inscription II, line 12 ὅσπερ ταῦτ’ ἐφύτευσε. The retrieval of the word ἔργον at the end of the line makes it clear, how-ever, that a plant or other natural object would be unlikely. τόδ’ ἔργον must refer to a manmade votive, or, in a broader sense, to the overall refurbishing of the cave, as suggested by Decourt, IThess I, 73, p. 90. It is possible, however, to be more specific. Today the two landscape features that dominate the sanctuary’s view are the small elm wood"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"62chapter 4clumsy scribal correction, namely the inscriber’s attempt to correct an oversight like the one already noted in line 3 (pp. 57–58 above). According to Peek’s reconstruction, after inadvertedly omitting part of the second word in line 5 our mason was compelled to inscribe the missing letters in the space below, thus creating the illusion of an additional line of text. Restored to their proper position, these four letters complete the final word of the dedication—the personal name ΑΘ̣ ΑΝΙΠ(Π)Α followed by a punctuation mark resembling a xi, τὰν δὲ δάφ⟨ν⟩αν ἄερ’ Ἀθ̣αν⟨ί⟩ππα ≠ “Athanippa raised the laurel”. Unlike other scholars Peek is not as firmly convinced of the existence of a second human votary. Athanippa, he observes, could also be one of the θεαί, the Nymph of the spring who presided over the growth of local vegetation, 1938, p. 22). Of the many restorations considered above, Peek’s is arguably the most appealing. τὰν δὲ δάφ⟨ν⟩αν ἄερ’ Ἀθ̣αν⟨ί⟩ππα offers a plausible sense without resorting to abbreviations or grammatical eccentricities. Similarly plausible is the epigraphical argument which, for all its apparent convolutedness, is founded on observable fact (this mason’s proven tendency for messy self-corrections). Yet problems persist: for to obtain the reading Ἀθ̣αν⟨ί⟩ππα, one must postulate two additional scribal errors, phi for theta at the beginning of line 6 and the omission of the iota in the third syllable. Are we really ready to believe that this inscriber was so incompetent as to insert errors even when he was correcting himself ? In printing the present text I follow the prudent approach of J.C. Decourt, who shies away from any attempt to restore the final line of the inscription (commentary to IThess I, 72, p. 89). As for line 5, I am more hesitant than the French scholar to print ΑΕΔΑΠΑΞ: ἄερ’ ἅπαξ. As we have seen, the palaeographical argument for reading ΑΕΡ in place of ΑΕΔ is far from solid. Also, even if ἀείρω appears in votive contexts, the fact that it is normally used in texts of poetic nature makes it seem somewhat out of place in an inscription like ours (for an epigraphical par-allel, contrast e.g. IG XII 3, 349 = CEG I, 456, Εὐμάστας με ἄηρεν ἀπὸ χθονὸς hο Κριτοβώλο). Finally, the adverb ἅπαξ does not appear to provide any acceptable sense with ἄερ’. 1.5 ConclusionsIt is easy to read if you know what it says.E. Vanderpool, quoted by Lang, Agora XXIIn absence of physical damage it is hard to imagine what would have caused an ordinary six-line dedication like Inscription I to degenerate, in mid-text, into a seemingly incoherent word jumble. Blaming it all on the inscriber’s the text of the last two lines is very hard to break down into coherent units of meaning. Most editors agree that a verb ruling δάφ⟨ν⟩αν is to be recognized in the first three letters of line 5, interpreting ΑΕΔ as ἄερ’ (from ἀείρω, “to raise, lift, hence to present, offer” Decourt, commentary to IThess I, 72, p. 89; see also Peek 1938, p. 21 who suggests comparison with Pi. N. 8, 40–41, ὡς ὅτε δένδρεον . . . ἀερθεῖσ’ . . . πρὸς ὑγρόν αἰθέρα). A similar consensus exists about the restoration of the next world, restored by the majority as the adverb ἅπαξ, ‘once’ (“at the same time as” Decourt, on the evidence of E. IT 528). The true hapax in this text lies however in the last line of the inscription, as the let-ter sequence Φ̣ ΑΝΠ does not appear anywhere else in the Greek language. What does the sentence, ‘carried up/raise the laurel once’, mean? And who—or what—is Φ̣ ΑΝΠ, the presumed subject of ἄερ’? As the restorations listed in the apparatus show, it is difficult to improve the sense of lines 5–6 without introducing significant changes to the text. A widespread assumption is that the ancient inscriber, either by accident or voluntarily, left some words incom-plete: this is essentially the underlying theory behind restorations such as Comparetti’s τὰν δὲ δάφ[ναν] ἆ[ι] ἑδ’ ἀπ’ ἀέ[θλον] Φάν[ι]π[πος], “the laurel which Phanippus enjoyed after the contest”; Maas’ τὰν δὲ δάφ⟨ν⟩αν ἄερ’ ἅπαξ Ἀγαθάνγ(ελος), “Agathangelus carried up the laurel once”; or Hiller’s, τὰν δὲ δάφ⟨ν⟩αν ἄερ’ ἀπάξ[ας] ὁ ἀνπ(ελουργός), “the gardener uprooted and carried up the laurel”. Not all scholars believe that Inscription I is incomplete or obscured by abbreviations. Gallavotti for example retains the text of the stone as it is, reading τάνδε δ’ἀφάν ἀε(ρ)ρ’ ἄ(π)παξ Φανῆ ̣ι ̣, “and he (Pantalces) carried up this struc-ture all in one piece for Phanes”. Such reading, however, is based on Gallavotti’s highly questionable interpretation of certain words—namely ἀφή, used here in the unparalled sense of ‘structure’, and ἄπαξ, preposterously explained as a syncopated form of ἀπόπαξ (itself a very rare term, only attested in Hesychius). Anomalies of this kind indeed mar the majority of restorations proposed for lines 4–6: in their effort to restore meaning to this unyielding text, scholars resort to making up new words (Comparetti: ἑδ’ for an unspecified form of ἥδομαι; Hiller: ἀπάξ[ας] for ἀποπάξας) or populating the text with implausible vine-yard growers (Hiller: ὁ ἀνπελουργός) and Orphic gods (Gallavotti: Φανῆ ̣ι ̣). The editor of the inscription’s editio princeps, Giannopoulos, even considered the possibility of mysteric formulae (1912, p. 669) or ritual utterances in a Pre-Hellenic language (1919, p. 51). Overall, no one has suc-ceeded in providing a text that reproduces the simplicity and directness of the first half of the inscription.For W. Peek the problems in the second half of Inscription I arise not from an obscure abbreviation but a"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"63The Inscriptions: inscription iis the most plausible. Inscription II has all the appearance of a ‘visitor’s guide’, intended to provide—among other things—some sort of aid to the understanding of the ven-erable carvings preserved in Inscription I. By retracing the thread of intertextual connections which link this poem to the earlier text it might be possible to reconstruct, thus, how much of lines 4–6 were the ancients able to read (or believed they were): one could argue, for example, that Pantalces’ portrayal as an ἀοιδός is likely to have been inspired by the letterstring ΑΕΔ in Inscription I, under-stood as a form of ἀείδω—much the same way as ΔΑΦΑΝ, in the preceding line of this text, was probably responsible for the various references to planting found throughout the poetry. It is doubtful whether ancient readers were more successful than us in piecing together these disiecta membra into a logically and grammatically coherent sen-tence: rather, such fragments seem to have been loosely employed as ‘thread’ for the foundation tale presented in Inscription II. For speculation’s sake we can try to recon-struct the readings that inspired the character of Pantalces ἀοιδός. An often neglected element in most studies about Inscription I is the letterstring ΑΠΑΞ, almost certainly to be restored as ἅπαξ. Despite various scholarly attempts to stretch its meaning, ἅπαξ in this context does not lend itself to translations such as ‘in the same occasion’ or ‘at the same time’. A quantitative adverb used to denote a single occurrence in time or a single act in a series (in con-trast with related adverbs such as δίς, τρίς, τετράκις), the term is appropriate to the language of agonistic inscrip-tions and laws. One may compare, for example, an agonis-tic inscription from Caria listing the accomplishments of a young pancratiast named Aristomachus (IMag 181, lines 14–16),15ἐστεφόμην ἄεθλον κύδιμονΟὐράνια — Ἴσθμια δίς, παίδων μὲνἅπαξ, τὸ δ’ ἅπαξ ἀγενείων I was crowned with glorious victory at the Ouranian games. At the Isthmian games (I was crowned) twice: once in the youths’, once in the boys’ class,or a lease from Amorgus regulating the use of land at the sanctuary of Zeus Temenites (IG XII 7, 62, lines 8–11),16ἀμπέλους δ[ὲ] | [σκ]άψει δίς, τὸμ πρ[ῶ]το[ν μ]ηνὸς Ἀνθε[σ]τηριῶνος, τ[ὸν] δεύτερον | σκαφη[τὸ]ν [μηνὸς] Ταυρειῶνος πρὸ εἰκάδ[ος]· | συκᾶς ἅπαξ.15 Extensive commentary by Moretti in IAG 71, pp. 198–206.16 Commentary: Rhodes and Osborne in GHI 59, pp. 282–286.clumsiness seems unrealistic. But if lines 5–6 are not cor-rupted or abbreviated, what is it that prevents us from understanding them? This question, which does not appear to have a satisfactory answer, prompts another, related question: could such a text have been more com-prehensible to the ancients than it is to us? From comparison with other foundation inscriptions one would expect the sentence Παντάλκε̄ς ἀνέθε̄κε θεαῖς τόδ’ ἔργον to be followed by a statement about the motive and circumstances of the dedication (for example, IG I3, 980 informs us that Archedamus’ work at the Vari cave was done at the explicit suggestion of the Nymphs, 3–4 φραδαῖσι Νυμφο̑ν). Ancient dedicants had at their disposal a rich formulaic repertoire for all kinds of votive scenarios: dedications inspired by dreams, visions, or oracles; dedi-cations offered in fulfillment of a vow; dedications offered in thanksgiving. Yet no trace of such an expression can be discerned in these lines, even in a corrupted form. Rather, it would appear that the second half of the inscription contained the statement of another sacred act, presum-ably the offering of a laurel. Furthermore, the word order seems to suggest that the two parts of the text may have been structured in a simple chiastic pattern (subject-verb-object : object-verb-subject). This kind of formal arrange-ment would have been appropriate to the description of two separate but complementary sacred actions, such as the furnishing and the planting of a rural shrine. A rupes-tral inscription from the well-known nymphaeum at Phyle records the dedication of a votive image to Pan where the supervision of the sculpture’s setup and that of the accompanying sacrifices appear to be the charge of two different individuals (IG II2, 4829: cf. p. 59, n0te 9 above):ἀγαθῇ τύ[χῃ]· | Τελ[εσφόρος] ? | ΚΛ....

The sacrifice was supervised by Trophimianus.However, if Pantalces ever had an associate in the land-scaping of the Karapla cave, the commemorative epigram in Inscription II makes no mention of it. There could be two reasons for this: that the epigram’s author, like us, could not read the second part of the dedication and had therefore to rely on the first three lines, which only men-tion Pantalces’ name; or, alternatively, that the same indi-vidual could read the dedication throughout and did not find there any names of additional people involved in the cave’s foundation. As suggested above, the first possibility"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"64chapter 4θύεν τῶι βουλομένωι ἐπὶτελεστῶν ἀγαθῶν.Whoever wishes to is allowed to sacrifice for the ful-fillment of good things.When reconsidering Inscription I in this light, one won-ders if an ancient reader could have interpreted ΑΕΔΑΠΑΞ | ΦΑΝΠ as a liturgical prescription of some kind—namely an invitation to approach the cave intoning a certain chant (ἄε⟨ι⟩δε), followed by instructions concerning the number of repetitions (ἅπαξ) and the relevant musical notation (ΦΑΝΠ: g-f ́-b-a?).19 That chants and refrains were used in Greek cult to accompany ritual gestures is shown, for example, by a sacred law from Epidaurus detailing the daily liturgy at the Asclepieum,20 IG IV2 1, 742, lines 5–10:εἶτ’ ἐν Ἀφροδισιδείωι ὁμοίω[ς - - - - - -][- - - - - - - ὁ π]υρφόρος ἐπιβοᾷ ἑκάστου λύχνου [- - - - - -][- - - - - - - -τ]ῷ τῆς ἱερᾶς λυχνίας πρὸς τ- - - - - - - - - -][- - - - - - - - -]Ι̣ου ἐν τῇ ἀρκτῴῳ θύρᾳ, β ́ ἐν τῇ - - - - - - - - -][- - - - - - - -]ου, β ́ πρὸς τῷ λουτρῷ, α ́ πρὸς [- - - - - - - - -]Likewise, then, in the precinct of Isis and Aphrodite . . . the lamp bearer invokes . . . of each lamp . . . the sacred lampstand in the direction of . . . at the north gate . . . twice at the . . . twice in the direction of the bath, once in the direction of . . .and by two other inscriptions from the same site, which preserve the texts of such chants as well as instructions about their execution,21 IG IV2 1, 133’ col.

Around the fig trees (he shall dig) once.Based on the words which they could recognize—the noun δάφνα and a form of the verb ἀείδειν near the adverb ἅπαξ—it would not be surprising if the ancients thought that this obscure text concealed a reference to a poetic contest once won by Pantalces (particularly since Pantalces’ work at the cave could be construed as a thank offering for such a victory). A similar possibility was con-sidered, in more recent times, by B. Moore, who noted the palaeographical merits of the reading ἄε⟨ι⟩δ’ ἅπαξ, but was unable to reconcile the palaeography with the grammar.17 As Moore admits, a present stem like ἄε⟨ι⟩δ’ does not coordinate well with ἀνέθηκε in the first half of the text. Moreover, unless we are willing to embrace the theory of an abbreviated word (and possibly a second dedicant) in the last line of the inscription, the letterstring ΦΑΝΠ remains unaccounted for. On the other hand everyday users of the Karapla shrine might not have been as preoc-cupied with grammar as a modern day classicist, and it is quite possible that they were just content with a partial understanding of the text, accepting obscurity as natural in (what was perceived to be) an old document. The fre-quent occurrence of ἅπαξ in legal contexts also prompts us to consider another possibility: on occasion, foundation inscriptions such as ours include, after the information on the dedicant and the circumstances of the dedication, a ritual prescription or a set of instructions for prospective users of the sanctuary. This is the case, for example, of IG I3, 987, a 400 BCE dedication from New Phalerum record-ing the establishment of a shrine to the river god Cephisus by a woman named Xenocrateia. In this inscription, the text of the foundation proper is followed by a short state-ment authorizing the public use of the site for sacrificial activities (lines 6–7),1817 1994, pp. 26–27.18 LSCG Suppl. 17; ample discussion in Purvis 2003, pp. 15–32. See also lines 16–19 in the foundation inscription of the Archilocheium in Paros, LSCG 180 (although E. Lupu has recently expressed skepticism on the interpretation of this text as a sacred law, NGSL p. 35, note 162)."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"65The Inscriptions: inscription iReturning now to our text. The hypothetical readings explored above illustrate how, whether or not the final lines of Inscription I were actually concerned with music, they could have been construed as such based on the par-tial identification of words like ἀείδειν and ἅπαξ (accord-ingly, a non-lexical sequence like ΦΑΝΠ could have been interpreted in the same context as musical notation). Recent studies suggest that partial or abbreviated read-ings of inscribed texts were not uncommon among visi-tors to ancient sanctuaries, especially when dealing with oddly shaped or inconveniently located monuments, or letterforms of unfamiliar style.23 Presumably individuals with previous epigraphical experience and sufficient edu-cation would have been able to supplement the hard-to-read parts, as long as the ‘core’ vocabulary and syntax24 of the inscription were understood. The formulaic char-acter of votive texts facilitated this process significantly. In our case it seems highly probable that the portrayal of Pantalces ἀοιδός in Inscription II originated from a reading strategy of this sort, applied to the final lines of Inscription I. The Epidaurian examples given above confirm that somebody conversant with the vocabulary of liturgical records could have easily seen an affinity between our inscription and those texts. Regrettably I am unable to suggest a restoration compatible with this inter-pretation which would not leave too many questions unanswered, musically and otherwise.23 On the reading of inscribed dedications: Day 2010, pp. 26–284 (especially pp. 39–40 on ‘partial readings’).

The pi’s have verticals of even length. Other dis-similarities include H, Ω for Ē, Ō (contrast Inscription I, 1 ΠΑΝΤΑΛΚΕΣ; 2 ΑΝΕΘΕΚΕ). Except for some inconsis-tencies in the notation of Ω (6 ΑΠΟΛΛΟΝΙ: 16 ΑΠΟΛΛΩΝ; 14 ΕΔΟΚ: 19 ΔΩΚΕ, 16 ΔΙΔΩΣΙ), the fully developed use of these and other Ionic letter forms shows that this text was engraved some time after the end of the fifth century.25 Palaeographical analysis and comparison with other inscriptions from the region (e.g. IThess I, 58; 63; 64; 74; 79; 91) would point to a date anywhere in the fourth century—perhaps even in the first quarter of the third—but it is very difficult to be specific. Based on a conserva-tive assessment of the evidence we could estimate that the engraving of Inscription II took place about one hun-dred years after the original dedication of Pantalces in the Early Classical Period; the possibility of a later date, how-ever, should to be entirely dismissed. continues to be attested well into the third century, e.g. IThess I, 50, line 1 ἔδουκε; line 2 ἐδούκαεμ.2 Inscription II2.1 Epigraphical OverviewKarapla hill (Pharsala), in the same location as Inscription I above [Plate VI: 3]. Hexametric epigram, engraved at eye level (about 2 m. from the ground) on a flat-faced spur of limestone extending from the base of the cliff [Fig. 50]. The text of the inscription, laid out in a single column, is enclosed within a rectangular panel which has been roughly cleared out in the rock [Fig. 51]. Dimensions of the panel: 0,80 × 1,10 m. Average letterheight: 0,02–0,03 m. Average interline: 0,05 m. The lettering, although not incompetently executed, is shallow and shows the same lack of sophistication observed in the preparation of the inscribing surface. The overall impression is that of a non-professional effort very much like Inscription I; the epi-graphical hand, however, is quite different. This engraver does not cut letters as deeply nor does he tilt the hori-zontal elements of his alphas and deltas. The obliques in his kappas connect with the vertical in middle, not the upper section of the bar as do those by the Inscription I 25 On the tardy appearance of Ω in the Thessalian epigraphical record: Jeffery 1990, pp. 96–99.

As Peek saw, however, the traces in the squeeze (two verticals joined by a middle horizontal) are clearly those of an eta. The last discernible lettertraces before the lacuna belong to a nu (a vertical connecting on top to a downpointing oblique; the upper end of the second vertical is also visible above the break).21 ΔΕ: followed by all later editors except Peek, Giannopoulos does not read the epsilon (although the letter can be distinguished without any difficulty in the AE 1919 plate). ΕΠΙ̣Λ̣ΗΣΙ̣Σ̣ : this word is clearly discern-ible on the squeeze, confirming Peek’s reading against Giannopoulos’ palaeographically and lexically implau-sible ἔξαρσις. Carved on a particularly uneven area of the rock, the epsilon is slightly distorted but still readable, as is the following pi. Iota and lambda survive respectively in their bottom and top portions; eta is complete. The first sigma and second iota, although faint, are equally discern-ible. Only the final sigma is a barely recognizable smudge.22 [4–5]: between ΔΕ and ΠΟΛΕΜΟΙΟ is a letter-sequence disfigured by the weathering of the rock surface. On the squeeze after a gap of two letters it is possible to see traces of a rounded sign followed by some faint verti-cal marks. Peek reads: [. .]ΡΗ, but the rounded letter vis-ible after the lacuna is too large to be the loop of a rho. More appropriately Giannopoulos prints an omikron. At the end of the line survive the upper left part of a nu—two obliques converging at the top, which Giannopoulos assigns to a lambda—and possibly an iota. Peek prints: N[I]; all other editors follow Giannopoulos.23 ΚΗ: as Peek saw, these letters are clearly visible below NỊ in the preceding line. The remaining space before and after ΚΗ is uninscribed.2 ΤΥΧ[1–2?]: the first three letters of this word are clearly legible below ΘΕΟ̣ Σ̣ , confirming Peek’s reading against Decourt’s suspicions of “an aberrant addition” (commen-tary to IThess I 73, p. 91). As for the markings which Peek read as an upsilon, they are more likely to be the product of nature than a chisel (they are thinner and shallower than real lettergrooves). To the left of chi are confused traces of what could be an alpha and a nu. 3 Π̣ Ρ̣ ΟΣΙΟΝΤΕΣ: after ΧΑΙΡΕΤΕΤΟΙ, all editors read a pi followed by a letter of uncertain identification (alpha: Giannopoulos, Decourt; rho: Peek). Here the stone forms a natural indentation which Giannopoulos believed to be a chip in the inscribed surface (1919 p. 51. Inside this recessed area Peek was able to read the letter sequence ΟΣΙΟΝΤΕΣ, of which the fifth, sixth, and seventh letters are no longer legible today. ΑΠΑΣ: Gannopolous, followed by Decourt, only reads the second alpha; but as Peek saw, all four letters are clearly legible on the stone.8 ΕΣΤΙ: epsilon and sigma are faint on the squeeze but clearly legible in the photograph. Τ[..]: after the tau is a letter, illegible in both the photograph and the squeeze, which Giannopulos and Peek read as an omikron. Hondius and Decourt prefer instead to restore [A]. Next are the remains of two oblique strokes which could belong to a delta (Giannopoulos; Decourt, with dot) or a chi (Peek). 9 ΠΟΛΛ[.]: the last letter of the line is no longer leg-ible. Alone among the editors of this text, Peek prints Giannopoulos’ restoration πολλ[ά without bracketing the alpha. 10: All dotted letters in this line are very faint in both the photograph and the squeeze.11: Eroded by water, the epsilon, pi and iota of Ε̣ Π̣ Ι̣ΣΣΚΟΠΟΝ are almost illegible in the squeeze but can be discerned clearly enough in the photograph. 12 ΕΞΕΠΟΝ̣Η̣ ΣΑΤΟ: the first epsilon, dotted by Giannopoulos and other editors, is not visible on the pho-tograph but can be read in the squeeze. As with the letters directly above and below them, the nu and the eta are now almost obliterated by erosion. 13 Η̣ Μ̣ ΑΤΑ: eta and mu are also severely damaged by water; see comments to lines 10–12 above. 14: Letters 1–8 (ΗΡΑΚΛ̣ ΕΗΣ) and 18–26 (Χ̣ Υ̣ ΝΑΡΕΤΗΝ) of this line are not visible in the photograph.15 ΛΥΘΟΥΣ̣ : the sigma, legible in the photograph, is now damaged and does not show up in the squeeze The following tau is also very faint."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"68chapter 4God.

The Nymphs who tread these lands endowed Pantalces with a noble heart and made him their overseer: he is the one who planted this place and toiled over it with his hands; and they rewarded him in return with bountiful living through all of his days. Heracles gave him strength of will, heart, and body, with which he pounded these rocks and turned them into a way up; Apollo, his son, and Hermes gave him health and prosperity for his entire life; Pan laughter, mer-ryment and just excess; Chiron gave him knowledge and musical skill.

The technique is more reminescent of Homeric than Hellenistic versification,27 pointing to a date in the late Classical Period; this evidence, on the other hand, seems inconsistent with the extended epigrammatic length, which would rather place the inscription in late Hellenistic or even Roman times (see section 2.4 below). As it will be shown further on in the commentary, the Homeric resonances noted in the versification are part of a more extensive, deliberate epicizing scheme traceable throughout the entire text. ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑|⏑ ‒‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒‒ ‒‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑|⏑ ‒‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑5 ‒‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒|‒ ‒‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒‒ ‒‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑|⏑ ‒‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒‒ ‒‒ ‒‒ ‒|‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒‒ ‒‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑|⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒|⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑10 ‒⏑⏑ ‒‒ ‒|⏑⏑ ‒‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒|‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒‒ ‒‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑|⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒‒ ‒|⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒|‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑15 ‒‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒|‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑ ‒‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑|⏑ ‒‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒‒ ‒‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑|⏑ ‒‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒|‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑ ‒‒ ‒‒ ‒⏑|⏑ ‒ ‒‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑20 ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒|⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑ ‒‒ ‒‒ ‒⏑|⏑ ‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒|⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒‒26 A few inscriptions from the cave of Archedamus at Vari appear to contain a rudimentary mixture of prose and verse; see Schörner and Goette 2004, pp. 42–44, no. 1 (IG I3, 980); 44–46, no. 3 (IG I3, 982); 51–54, no. 8 (IG I3, 977). Artemidorus’ own col-lection of inscribed poetry from Thera (IG XII 3, 421–422; IG XII 3 Suppl. 1333–1350), although more extensive, is hardly better in terms of quality: “A striking example of poor yet plentiful, epi-graphic verse, from the mid-third century BC, is the series of poems inscribed at the sanctuary of Artemidorus of Perge on Thera [. . .]. It is hard to imagine that Artemidorus paid a profes-sional to compose these. If he did, he was badly swindled” (Bing and Bruss 2007, p. 4, note 19; cf. van Straten 1993, p. 261. I did not have access to P. Bing’s paper “Precinct of Epigrams: the Sanctuary of Artemidoros of Perge”, presented at the 142nd "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"70chapter 4Peek was so seduced by the combination of literary and real life idyll encountered at the Karapla shrine that in order to make Pantalces the author of this supposedly rustic poetry he was ready to compress the wide chrono-logical gap—one hundred years or so—which separates Inscription I from Inscription II: a true epigraphical ady-naton that would hardly stand scrutiny today. In fact, as J.C. Decourt perceptively observed, the Karapla epigram is the product of careful and painstaking work (“un poème très travaillé”, commentary to IThess I, 73, p. 91). In the same vein, P. Bonnechere has judged this text to be “full of subtleties and souplesse” (2001, p. 36). The beginning and close of the epigram are conceived in the form of a direct address to the reader: lines 3–4 wel-come incoming visitors, 20–22 invite them to complete their visit by taking the stairs up to the cave. Within this frame the main body of the poem unfolds with the tale of the sanctuary and its founder, articulated in two parts: lines 5–9 describe the site and the deities worshipped in it; 10–19 explain how the same deities inspired Pantalces to found and guard the sanctuary and what rewards they gave him in return. Transitions from one thematic section to the other are regularly marked by δέ (5, 10, 13) except at the close, where the return to the direct address is indi-cated by the more emphatic ἀλλά (20). The metrical text is preceded by a two-line heading with expressions of good wish (1–2). Heading (lines 1–2)1 Θεός‘God’ or its plural, ‘gods’, is a formulaic word which appears in the headings of decrees and other official documents, alone or—as always in Thessaly—in combination with expressions of good wish such as τύχη ἀγαθή, or simply τύχη, ‘good fortune’ (see commentary to line 2 below). It is generally referred to as the ‘invocation’ (e.g. Rhodes and Osborne in GHI, p. xix) but its meaning is uncertain: scholars have variously interpreted it as a consecration formula (Larfeld 1902, p. 591, who somewhat inconsis-tently also calls it an ‘appeal for good fortune’; Guarducci 1967–1978, II, p. 43), or an indication that religious rites have taken place in connection with the actions described in the inscription (Woodhead 1981, p. 39; cf. Rhodes and Osborne in GHI, p. xix; on the prayers recited at the open-ing of council and assembly meetings in Athens, see e.g. Dem. 19, 70; Ar. Thesm. 331 ff.). More convincingly R. Pounder has argued for an apotropaic function of the word (1984, pp. 243–250). According to Pounder, this type naïve poem by Pantalces, constructor and dedicator of a local shrine to various deities”.

Its length would assign it to the category of the so-called epigramma longum, an ‘amplified’ epigrammatic format occasionally attested in inscriptions from the late Hellenistic Period onwards.28 In terms of style, the use of short sentences and simple paratactic structures, combined with the absence of elaborate diction, give the poetry a flavor remi-nescent of certain carmina popularia.29 Peek, whose study of 1938 still remains the most detailed stylistic assessment of Inscription II, effectively captures this ‘feeling’ in the following statement:If the whole does not turn out to be monotonous, but there is a prevailing impression of movement and variety, this is accomplished by the structure of the individual components [of the poem], the many two-and multi-part constructions, sequences, and parataxes. In twenty lines we find only one partici-ple. Besides the naïvete of the matter-of-fact exposi-tion, it is this airiness of the short phrases which gives the poem its unique uncultivated feel (Unbeholfenheit), one may say idyllic charm (p. 25). Yet it might be unwise to overstate the ‘naïve’ character of the composition.30 Not unlike the nympholepts of old, 28 The term epigramma longum, borrowed from Martial (I, 110; II, 77; VI, 65), is used by scholars today to designate epigrams of fifteen verses or more; see Szelest 1980, pp. 99–108 and the papers dedicated to this epigrammatic form in Morelli (ed.) 2008, especially Garulli’s study on inscriptional epitaphs, ibid. II, pp. 623–662.29 See e.g. PMG 848–849; 851–852; 854–856; 869. 30 References to the naïvete of the Karapla epigram are found throughout the early scholarship on this text: see e.g. Powell and Barber 1929, pp. 55–56, “The guardian, happily named Pantalces, describes the shrine in a simple and naïve way, with genial self-satisfaction . . .

Lhôte 2006, p. 343. 2 τύχ[α]In its full or abbreviated form, the expression of good wish τύχη (ἀγαθή) is also a common element of decree or law headings; for an example specifically related to the cult of the Nymphs, see e.g. a sacred law from Marathon of the first century BCE, SEG 36, 267 = NGSL 4, ἀγαθῇ τύχῃ· ἐπὶ Θεο|φήμου ἄρχοντος· vvv | Πυθαγόρας καὶ Σωσι|κράτης καὶ Λύσανδρος | οἱ συνέφηβοι Πανὶ καὶ | Νύμφαις ἀνέθηκαν. <Α>|ἀπαγορεύει ὁ θεός· μὴ | [ε]ἰσφέρειν χρωμάτιν[ον] | [μ]η̣ δὲ βαπτὸν μηδὲ Λ..| [—5–6—]ΕΙΣΠ[—6–7—]). Purpose and meaning are the same as those of the Latin expression quod felix faustumque sit (QFFQS). Unlike θεός/θεοί, the formula τύχη (ἀγαθή) and its variations are widely attested outside the sphere of official documents. For their appearance above poetic texts, see especially a stele at the Museumslandschaft Hessen Kassel containing the paean to Hygieia by Ariphron of Sicyon and other hymns, inv. SK 61 = IG II2, 4533.Peek’s restoration τύχ[α] in this line is likely but not definitive, since in Thessalian documents the spelling in –η is no less frequent than the one in –ᾱ (at Pharsalus: IThess I, 51; multiple occurrences at Gonnoi, see Gonnoi II, pass.). Equally uncertain is the restoration of the case: besides the nominative, τύχη (ἀγαθή)/τύχα (ἀγαθά) is also commonly attested in the dative and accusative—the lat-ter being especially popular in the Doric speaking areas of Central Greece (out of a total of 230 occurrences, 210 show the spelling in α). On the cult of personified Good Fortune in Thessaly see Heinz 1998, pp. 320–323, nos. 266?, 268, 270, and 278, with discussion at pp. 79–80. Text I Lines 3–4: Welcome AddressAccording to epigrammatic custom, Inscription II ‘speaks’ to its readers in the manner of a real life encounter. Opinions vary as to the identity of the speaking voice: most scholars like to believe that the speaker is Pantalces himself, but the chronological discrepancy between Inscription II and Inscription I makes this a very unlikely possibility. Alternatively Ph. Borgeaud has suggested that these verses could be the utterance of a god, the name-less θεός of the heading (1995, p. 295; see commentary to of heading is not linked in meaning with the text which it precedes, but is concerned with the inscription as a mon-ument. Specifically, the expression θεός/θεοί places the stone on which it is inscribed under the protection of the gods against theft, removal, or other disturbance (theft: Guarducci 1967–1978, III, p. 341; removal: ibid. p. 363). In its earliest and fuller form it may have included imprecatory content, cf. θιoσόλοιον = θιὸς ὄλοι ὄν? in the wall inscription of the laws from the temple of Apollo Delphinius at Dreros, Buck 1955, p. 313, no. 116 (= BCH 61, 1937, pp. 333–348: for the alternative restoration θιὸς ὀ λωΐος, i.e. θεός ἀγαθός, see Ehrenberg 1943, p. 15, after Guarducci 1939). Pounder traces the roots of this epigraphic practice to the Near East, citing the example of Babylonian kudurru stones (a type of boundary marker, carved with apotropaic curses and images of protecting gods, which had the function of placing land-grant property under divine protection; King 1912, introduction, p. x). The formula θεός/θεοί has been discussed mostly in the context of government records, namely laws and decrees, but its occurrence above the text of an epigram seems to challenge the commonly held assumption that its use was restricted to that type of inscription. Further appear-ances of this expression (with or without any additional text) on objects of so disparate a nature as vases, metal tablets, bricks, and rooftiles seem to confirm that θεός/θεοί must have been, at least originally, a private formula with a wide number of applications. P. Traywick, who offers an extensive review of this material in his 1968 dissertation on the inscriptional use of θεοί and ἀγαθὴ τύχη, compares the unspecific nature of this expression to that of libation rituals:The heading θεοί, which seems to have been in order wherever there was writing, and elsewhere, may be compared with the practice of pouring libations, in order wherever there was drinking, and on many other occasions. This was a very unspecific effort on the part of men to remain in an inoffensive relation-ship with the gods (p. 111)There appear to be no other examples for the placement of θεός/θεοί over a poetic text. A possible parallel is the well-known hydria from Vari showing Sappho in the act of reading a scroll (Athens, National Museum 1260: in the top part of the scroll the word ΘΕΟΙ is legible above a pas-sage of uncertain restoration but inequivocably metrical nature. See Edmonds 1922, pp. 1–14; Traywick 1968, pp. 87–90). Otherwise worth noting is the use of the formula in documents related to the spheres of healing and proph-ecy—two domains commonly associated with caves: in"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"72chapter 4interpreted as sermo homericus, appropriate to the epiciz-ing style of epigrammatic poetry (cf. the Homeric genitive πολέμοιο in line 22 below); on the other hand, τό, τά are also the regular plural forms of the definite article in the Doric dialect (cf. Ἀσκλαπιοῦ in line 7 below). As the edi-tors of SEG 1 rightly observe, we have an “exordium dori-cum in hymno ceteroquin epico”. 3–4 ἅπας θῆλύς τε καὶ ἄρσην,| ἄνδρες τε ἠδὲ γυναῖκες ὁμῶς παῖδές τε κόραι τεThe inscription “welcomes all the world with a com-prehensive greeting”, Powell and Barber 1929, p. 56. Cf. χαίρετε πάντες, ὅσοι παροδεύετε in a funerary epigram from Scythopolis, Palestine (QDAP 8, 1938, 59 = GVI 1221). In our text, the all-inclusive character of the initial address is expressed through a three-step progression from general to specific, articulated in two interlacing series of gender and age opposites (Male-Men-Boys: Female-Women-Girls, and Men-Women: Boys-Girls). The series of gender oppo-sites stretches across the first two lines of the poem with a light sense-enjambement (Male: Female, // Men: Women, Boys: Girls); by contrast, age opposites are neatly con-tained within one line, in two symmetrical couples facing one other from either end of the caesura (Men: Women / Boys: Girls). In all couples of gender opposites the male element precedes the female, except for the first couple of the series, ἅπας θῆλύς τε καὶ ἄρσην, where the order is reversed for the sake of chiasmus (θῆλύς / ἄρσην : ἄνδρες / γυναῖκες = ABBA; see Peek 1938, p. 23) as well as rhyme (ἅπας θῆλύς). A rhyming scheme in –s can be traced throughout the entire passage (προσιόντες, ἅπας θῆλύς, ἄνδρες, γυναῖκες, ὁμῶς, παῖδές; see also the occurrence of the sibilant in mid-word in ἄρσην), with the only excep-tion of the first and last words, χαίρετε and κόραι τε, which echo one other at the beginning and at the end of the sec-tion in a ring composition frame. Rhetorical effects aside, this complex diversifica-tion by gender and age may be a reflection of the actual sociodemographics of the cult. The Nymphs oversaw various aspects of both male and female life from child-hood to adult age; as a consequence, their veneration was spread across all categories of the Greek population. Representations of Nymph worship in votive art confirm indeed that these goddesses enjoyed the devotion of the social groups mentioned in our text. The use of juxtaposed gender opposites gives a ‘legal’ ring to these lines: for the pair ἄρσην/θῆλυς, see especially a sacred law from Thasos of the early 5th century BCE, IG XII 8, 358, Νύμφηισιν κἀπόλλωνι Νυμφηγέτηι θῆλυ καὶ ἄρσ-|εν ἃμ βόληι προσέρδεν· ὄϊν οὐ θέμις | οὐδὲ χοῖρον. | οὐ παιωνίζεται. | Χάρισιν αἶγα οὐ θέμις οὐδὲ χοῖρον. | Ἀ̣ ρ̣ιστ̣οκρά̣της Ἔρωτος; for ἀνήρ/γυνή, lines 1–2 above). A specific identification is not needed for the poetry to be effective. The ancients were used to being addressed by the disembodied voices of hundreds of epi-grams speaking from tombstones, votives, or other objects (see e.g. Tueller 2008, especially pp. 150–154; Livingstone and Nisbet 2010, pp. 22–30). In very general terms we could say that the voice in Inscription II is that of a tour guide—a lapidary equivalent of those live cicerones who sometimes assisted visitors of ancient shrines with infor-mation on local history and tradition (e.g. the ἐξηγήται of Olympia, attested in IvO 64, lines 19–20, and thirty other inscriptions; see also Jones 2001, pp. 33–39 for a discussion of ancient guides in periegetic literature): stylistically, the deployment of catalog verse structures throughout the whole poem, starting from the very first lines, seems coherent with the didactic character of such a persona. This ‘guide’ we shall now follow as it extends its genial welcome to the men, women, and children who came to worship on the Karapla hill.3 χαίρετε τοὶ προσιόντεςA variation on the greeting χαίρετε οἱ παριόντες found in funerary epigrams (GVI 1209, 1212; cf. 1216; 1210). The choice of προσ- (movement to) over παρ- (movement by) is due to the fact that the expected reader, here, is not the occasional passerby of grave inscriptions (Tueller 2008, especially pp. 14–15, 32–35, 36–42, 44–46, 65–94), but someone who is deliberately moving towards the sanctu-ary with the purpose of visiting it (προσιόντες . . . χῶρον δ’ εἰς ἱερὸν, see discussion below). This is also apparent from the end of the poem, where the visitors are encouraged to resume their progress, interrupted in order to read the inscription (lines 20–21 below, ἀλλὰ . . . ἀναβαίνε[τε], θύετε, εὔχεσθε εὐφραίνεσθε). On this use of πρόσειμι see the dedi-cation of another sacred installation to the Nymphs from the Pontus Euxinus, Studia Pontica III, 96, ταῖς μεγάλαις θε-|αῖς Νύμφαις, Λ. Ἰ(ούλιος) | Κορνηλιανὸς | Κέλερ ἐποίει. | οἱ προσιόν-|τες τούτωι | τῷ τόπωι | ἁγνῶς | πρόσιτε.

The formula χαίρετε τοὶ προσιόντες is designed to fill the first half of the hexameter (‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑); grammatically, however, προσιόντες reaches across the boundaries of the formulaic construct to form a broader syntagma with χῶρον δ’ εἰς ἱερὸν in line 5 and ἄντρον in line 7 (cf. οἱ προσιόντες τούτωι τῷ τόπωι in the aforemen-tioned inscription from the Pontus, lines 5–7). τοί for οἱ, with a slight demonstrative value (‘you there’) can be"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"73The Inscriptions: inscription iihalf of line 3; cf. LSJ, s.v. δέ, II.2. Peek’s χωρόνδ’ (obviously a typographical error for χῶρόνδ’, with enclitic -δε denoting motion towards a place, as in οἶκόνδε, θύραζε [= θύρασδε] et sim.), although theoretically possible even in combination with the preposition, is unnecessary as well as unattested. All editors after Giannopoulos print εἰς instead of εἷς, as the numeral here is manifestly inappropriate to both the grammar and the sense of the passage.The wording in this line echoes the language of bound-ary inscriptions, see e.g. a horos stone with lex sacra from Ithaca, IG IX 1, 654, ἱερὸς ὁ χῶρος τῆς | Ἀρτέμιδος. τὸν ἔ-|χοντα καὶ καρπού-|μενο[ν] τὴ̣ν μὲν δε-|κάτην | κατ̣αθύειν ἑ-|κάστου ἔτους, ἐκ δὲ τοῦ-|περιττοῦ τὸν̣ ναὸν ἐ-|πισκευά[ζ]-ειν· ἐὰν δέ τις | μὴ ποιῇ ταῦτα, τῆι | θεῶι μελήσει; and, for the use of the same vocabulary in a poetic context, IGUR III, 1155, lines 79–81, κλῦτε περικτίονες καὶ γείτονες ἀγροιῶται. | ἱερὸς οὗτος ὁ χῶρος, ἀκίνητοι δὲ θέαιναι |καὶ πολυτίμητοι καὶ ὑποσχεῖν οὖας ἕτοιμαι. From this initial reference to the sanctuary’s general grounds (cf. the equally general τῶνδ’ . . . χώρων in line 11 below) the focus of the poetry gradually narrows on the cave itself, according to a progression 5 χῶρον . . . ἱερὸν > 7 ἄντρον > 8 δ]ῶ[μα] which cleverly directs the reader’s attention to the architectural improvements introduced by the sanctuary’s founder. 5–6 Νύμφαις καὶ Πανὶ καὶ Ἑρμῆι, | Ἀπόλλ⟨ω⟩νι ἄνακτι, ⟨καὶ⟩ Ἡρακλεῖ καὶ ἑταίραιςAfter the caesura in 5, in the next two and a half lines the inscription goes on to introduce the various gods wor-shipped at the sanctuary, listing them in triads accurately framed within discrete metrical units. First come the Nymphs, Pan and Hermes, a triad occupying the paro-emiac of the fifth verse (‒ ‒‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒‒); then, in the follow-ing line, Apollo, Heracles, and the unidentified ἑταίραι, with Apollo in emphatic position at verse beginning as the sole occupant of the hemiepes (‒‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑). The order in which the deities are listed may reflect the hierarchy of the local cult. In line 5, Νύμφαις καὶ Πανὶ καὶ Ἑρμῆι is in fact a reversal of the sequence traditionally found in dedications, where the Nymphs are almost always placed after these gods (after Pan: IG II2, 4646; 4827; 4875; 4994; IG XII 5, 248; SEG 31, 815 and 36, 267; MDAIA 67 (1942) pp. 61, no. 105; 67, no. 115; 68, no. 116 b; IGR I, 5, 1152; IDelos 1839. After Hermes: IG I3, 986; IG II2, 4546. On the Nymphs as subordinates of the main pastoral gods see also Larson 2001, p. 97. Exceptions are rare: IG I3, 955; IG VII, 3092; IMT 566). The eminent role of the Nymphs at the Karapla cave is also confirmed by Inscription I as well as the cult artifacts found at this site (see especially Cat. nos. 3 and 69 a-b above, three statuettes showing the goddesses in a symbolon treaty between Athens and Troezen dating to after 400 BCE, IG II2, 46, line 26 [-- ἄ]νδρα ἢ γυναῖκα [--]. The inclusive ideology of our inscription has been recently examined by E. Aston in a paper entitled “ ‘Welcome, Visitors’: Religious Inclusivity in a Pharsalian Cave-Cult” (AEThSE 4, Volos 15–18 March 2012).II Lines 5–9: The Sanctuary, its Gods, and its FurnishingsIn the next five lines the epigram goes on to list the dei-ties worshipped on the Karapla hill (5–7) and the shrine’s most notable attractions (8–9). As this section reveals, the deployment of catalogic structures in the first half of the poem is based on an incremental pattern (visitors are organized in pairs: males-females, men-women, boys-girls; gods in triplets: Nymphs-Pan-Hermes, Apollo-Heracles-Heterae, Chiron-Asclepius-Hygieia; and votive gifts in quadruples: plantings-tablets-statues-gifts). A distinction also seems to be made between the first two triplets of gods (Nymphs-Pan-Hermes and Apollo-Heracles-Heterae), who are said to own the general grounds, and the last (Chiron-Asclepius-Hygieia), who are more specifically associated with the cave proper; the overall complex with its votive collections, on the other hand, is indicated to be the common property of the whole group. If this odd terri-torial arrangement has any explanation beyond the attain-ment of a certain stylistic effect (vz. the gradual revelation of the sanctuary’s layout in a three-stepped progression land / cave / architecture and artwork; see relevant com-mentary below) it is not a forthcoming one: caves are not the exclusive dominion of healing powers such as Chiron, Asclepius, and Hygiea, but also of oracular forces like Apollo and Heracles, and especially of countryside gods like the Nymphs, Pan, and Hermes. As becomes apparent in the next section, however, the intent of the epigram is not so much to offer a coherent theology of the Karapla cults but to construct, rather, a credible and appealing aetiological tale where the foundation of the sanctuary is suitably explained in light of the local pantheon. 5 χῶρον δ’ εἰς ἱερόνThe first reference to the sanctuary itself, emphasized by its position at the beginning of verse and by its self-contained metrical structure as a hemiepes (‒‒ ‒⏑⏑ ‒). Framed between the list of projected visitors in lines 3–4, and the list of local deities in lines 5–7, χῶρον δ’ εἰς ἱερόν binds grammatically with both, functioning as a bridge between the two first catalogic sections of the epigram. The particle δέ marks the return to the syntagma inter-rupted by the visitors list in lines 3–4, resuming the parti-cipial τοὶ προσιόντες . . . χῶρον δ’ εἰς ἱερόν initiated in the first"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"74chapter 4Ἀπόλλ⟨ω⟩νι ἄνακτι: “a major cult figure in every period of Thessaly’s history” (Graninger 2006, p. 47; cf. Heinz 1998, p. 49. Also: Mili 2015, appendix 1, nos. 16–77 et pass.), Apollo stands out in our text as the only deity to receive an epithet. No supporting evidence exists, on the other hand, for a special worship of Apollo at the Karapla cave (on the Apollinean cult at Pharsalus in general see IThess I, 64–65). The prominent position assigned to him in line 5 could thus be the result of formulaic convention (Decourt, com-mentary to IThess I, 73, p. 91), e.g. Hom. Il. 1, 36, Ἀπόλλωνι ἄνακτι, τὸν ἠύκομος τέκε Λητώ, or a reference to his domi-nant role over the Nymphs, cf. Φοῖβος ἄναξ Νυμφῶν on an inscribed votive altar from Didyma, IDidyma 82, line 1. In the latter case the epithet would have sexual as well as musical implications. The worship of Apollo as cho-rus leader of the Nymphs, Νυμφηγήτης, is well attested throughout Greece, especially Attica (where he and the goddesses appear in the sacred calendar of Erchia as recip-ients of goat sacrifices during the month of Gamelion, SEG 21, 541, col. V.1, lines 40–47, — ὀγδόη(ι) ἱστα-|μένο, Ἀπόλλ-|ωνι Νυμφη[γ]-|έτει, Ἐρχιᾶ-|σιν, αἴξ, Δłł.|— Νύμφαις,ἐπ-|ὶτο̑ αὐτοῦ β-|ωμοῦ, αἴξ : Δ. v); see also IG XII 8, 358 in the com-mentary to line 4 above, and, for the presence of a similar cult in Thessaly, a dedication to Apollo Musagetes in an unpublished inscription from Larissa, SEG 47, 746. Their subordinate role as Apollo’s dance (and sexual) partners does not prevent the Nymphs from ranking above this god in the hierarchy of local cult. Once again, the example of the above cited lex sacra from Thasos is instructive, with the placement of the Nymphs in first position before Apollo Numphegetes, νύμφηισιν κἀπόλλωνι Νυμφηγέτηι, IG XII 8, 358, line 1. Scholars who find it difficult to reconcile Apollo with a chthonic setting explain his appearance in caves as a byproduct of his relationship to the Nymphs (see e.g. a possible dedication of a cave to this god in a Hellenistic inscription from Thasos, BCH 91, 1967, pp. 583–585, no. 31, fig. 8, [----]Ν Ἀπόλλωνι | [---- σ]πήλαιον and the accompany-ing comments by the editor, who refers to the occurrence as “exceptional”). In fact Apollo’s frequentation of caves is by no means restricted to Nymph shrines: see e.g. a joint cult of Apollo, Heracles and Hermes Σπηλαῗται reported by Pausanias at a cave near Themisonium in Phrygia, 10, 32, 5–6. Cases where the god is the only dweller of the cave are recorded as well: in the same section of book 10, Pausanias goes on to describe another grotto near Magnesia on the Meander, where an ancient cult image of the god had the power to grant ἰσχὺν ἐπὶ ἔργῳ . . . παντί (10, 32, 6: on the identification of the place as Lydian Hieracome, see Ustinova 2009 pp. 120–121). And in the very city of Athens, an aptly named Apollo Ὑποακραῖος occupied a cave on an enthroned position—“a natural expression of power”, Connor 1988, p. 186: contrast the Scotussan relief at the Volos Museum mentioned at p. 48 above, where it is Pan who appears in a seated position beside a group of stand-ing Nymphs). For the rest, the text of the epigram con-forms to traditional religious iconography. By grouping the Nymphs with Pan and Hermes within the boundaries of the paroemiac, the anonymous poet succeeds in creat-ing what we could call a ‘pinax in verse’ (cf. line 9 below), a literary reproduction of the familiar type of votive relief in which these three deities are shown enclosed in an arched cave frame; cf. e.g. Athens, National Museum 1859 = LIMC I (1981) p. 23, no. 186, s.v. ‘Acheloos’ and the many examples collected in Edwards 1985. Throughout Greece, Pan and his father Hermes are traditional companions of the Nymphs in religious iconography and worship. From the early fifth century onwards, Pan is especially a regu-lar presence in the shrines of these goddesses, appearing either as their associate (‘visiting god’ Sporn 2010, p. 207) or the chief deity of the cult. As we have seen, in Thessaly a configuration of this second kind may have existed at Scotussa. Otherwise, with the notable exception of the Karapla cave and the one statuette from Proerna men-tioned above, the Goat God’s presence in Thessaly is not as substantial as in other parts of Greece, particularly in the epigraphical record (cf. Mili 2015, appendix 1). An interest-ing case, in this regard, is that of the nymphaeum on Mt. Ossa explored by the British School in 1908, which, in spite of its proximity to a peak of the mountain associated with Pan in the literary tradition, failed to yield any evidence for this god (as noted by Wace and Thompson 1908–1909, p. 246 and note 2; on Pan’s connection with Mt. Homole at the northeast end of the Ossa see Theoc. 7, 104). By con-trast, the Ossa cave accounts for a very large percentage of the overall epigraphical evidence on the Nymphs from Thessaly (cf. Mili 2015, appendix 1, nos. 353–361).Far better attested across the region than Pan is Hermes (Mili 2015, appendix 1, nos. 307–311 et pass.). Although the status of this god in Thessalian religion is not alto-gether clear, his cult seems to have implied more than the simple devotional practices associated with Pan and the Nymphs (the existence of a month named after him in the Thessalian calendar may point, for example, to an annual festival in his honor: Graninger 2006, p. 47; cf. Trumpy 1997, pp. 216–244). For the most part he appears in funer-ary contexts as Hermes Chthonius, or, less frequently, Eriunius, ‘The Helper’: only at Pharsalus we find him in his unique aspect as Bruchalius, or ‘Bellowing’ Hermes—an epithet possibly reflecting the importance of the pas-toral element in the area (Decourt in IThess I, 69: contra Avagianou 1997, pp. 207–213, Dettori 2000, pp. 27–33)."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"75The Inscriptions: inscription iiother divinities from lines 5–7 reappear without excep-tion in the following section. At the nymphaeum of Nea Heracleitsa in Thrace (ancient Oysime), the term ἑταῖροι designated the members of a sacred society who met in the cave to make sacrificial offerings and consume ritual meals, see Bakalakis 1938, p. 90, 1 [Ν]ύ̣μφαις ἀνέθηκέ μ̣[ε ὁ δεῖνα] | [καὶ ο]ἱ ἑταῖροι ⁝ Διοσκουρίδ[ης], | [Στρ]άτων ⁝ Σωσιμένης ⁝ Φάνις̣, | [Σ]ῶ̣σις : Θαλίαρχος : Ἀλκίμαχος [.] | [Ἡ]ρ̣ογείτων.7 Χίρωνος τ’ ἄντρον καὶ Ἀσκλαπιοῦ ἠδ’ ὙγιείαςThe second step in the aforementioned progression from general to specific: 5 χῶρον . . . ἱερὸν > 7 ἄντρον > 8 δ]ῶ[μα]. The transition to the cave proper and the next divine triad is marked by a grammatical shift which seems to imply a distinction between gods of the χῶρον and gods of the ἄντρον: “Lines 3–4 tell us whom the area—the chôrion (sic)—is sacred to: the nymphs, Pan, and Hermes. On line 5, however, there is a change of case—dative to genitive—and a break in sense, as we are told that the cave is ‘of ’ Chiron, Asclepius, and Asclepius’ daughter Hygieia. At this stage, it seems plausible to suggest that a distinction is being revealed, with the nymphs, Pan, and Hermes having a general authority in the area, and the cave itself being especially the territory of Chiron, Asclepius, and Hygieia” (Aston 2006, p. 360). Like Apollo in line 5, Chiron is here the sole occupant of the hemiepes (–– –– ‒|), his name standing in eminent position at verse beginning. The wholly spondaic rhythm of the colon, unique in the poem, would also appear to underscore the Centaur’s importance. The reasons for this emphasis are unclear. Chiron’s presence in a Pharsalian grotto, so far away from his own cave shrine on Mt. Pelium (Plu. Quaes.Conv. 647a; Heraclides Criticus fr. 2, 8–12 Pfister: see p. 28, note 86 above and commentary to line 9 below), could be explained perhaps in light of Pharsalus’ association with Achilles and the kingdom of Peleus (p. 6, note 30 above; see also Moustaka 1983, pp. 60–63; Stamatopoulou 2007, pp. 223, 229, note 40 and 2007a, pp. 329–330, note 136; Mili 2015, p. 176). In addition to music, hunting, and athletics, Chiron’s mentorship of the Pharsalian hero is known to have included the teaching of herbal medicine (Hom. Il. 11, 831), a craft that has deep associations with the Thessalian land and is reflected in the region’s later repu-tation as a place of magic and witchcraft (Mili 2015, pp. 285–295). Healing is the link which also reunites Chiron with Asclepius, the second member of the divine triplet in line 7 and the centaur’s most famous student in the healing arts. Another Thessalian hero from the northwest part of the country (Tricca: Hom. Il. 2, 729–732; Str. 9, 5, 17. Cf. Aston 2004, especially pp. 22–32; Riethmüller 2005, the north slope of the Acropolis hill (immediately to the west of Pan’s: for a review of the sources and the topog-raphy, see Travlos 1971 pp. 91–95, plates 115–122). Some form of subterranean setting, natural or artificial, is also a recurrent feature in the god’s oracular establishments, including Delphi. Finally—not to stray too far from our Pharsalian location—we have the evidence of a votive relief from Phtelia (Trikala) showing Apollo and his sister Artemis worshipped in a cave by a group of human devo-tees (Volos, Archaeological Museum 573 = LIMC II, 1984, p. 298, no. 959, s.v. ‘Apollon’: according to Heinz 1998, pp. 241–242, no. 127, the two deities are represented under an overarching tree).Ἡρακλεῖ: although Heracles is not attested anywhere else within the territory of Pharsalus, the hero had shrines in nearby cities such as Cierium (IThess I, 15) and Scotussa (SEG 25, 661). Thessaly was one of the lands ruled by his royal descendants, the Heraclidae; his special associa-tions with the mythology of the region are also evident at Pherae, Pagasae, and Mt. Oeta (see e.g. Moustaka 1983, pp. 66–67; Heinz 1998, pp. 75–76; for the god’s cult throughout Thessaly: Mili 2015, appendix 1, nos. 290–305 et pass.). On the Karapla hill he appears in a twofold role as archetypal figure of ἥρως κτίστης and grantor of physical strength. As the poetry makes clear (lines 14–15), Heracles played a role of great importance in the establishment of the sanctu-ary—second only to that of the Nymphs: for no divine character could have been more suited to assist a mortal κτίστης named Pantalces, the ‘All-Powerful’. Prompted by onomastics as well as the massive nature of the stonework found at the site, this symbolic parallelism between divine and human founder, protector and protégé, is effectively exploited by the epigram’s author for the construction of the sanctuary’s aition, providing the inspiration for some of the most original verses in the text (below, com-mentary to lines 14–15). καὶ ἑταίραις: there is no reason to assume, as most scholars do, that the unnamed deities at the end of the line are exclusively Heracles’ associates. The hero has ties with goddesses traditionally worshipped in groups (on his specific connection with the Nymphs see e.g. a Hellenistic dedication from Apameia, Bithynia, IApameia 138, θεῷ Ἡρακλεῖ καὶ Νύμφαις, cf. 139); but so do Apollo, Pan, and Hermes. As to the identity of the enig-matic ἑταίραι, a reasonable suggestion is that they are the Nymphs themselves (thus Decourt, who supports the traditional association with Heracles, IThess I, 73, p. 92), although a second reference to these goddesses appears redundant after Νύμφαις in the preceding line. Some scholars prefer to read ἑταίροις over the stone’s ἑταίραις (Giannopoulos 1919, p. 51), but of these presumed ‘fellows’ of Heracles we never hear again in the poem, while all"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"76chapter 418–19. For the use of the feminine caesura, see lines 3–4, 6, 8, 12, 16–17, 19, 21. The term δῶμα is used to indicate a cave inhabited by Nymphs in both epic and epigrammatic poetry, e.g. Od. 5, 6, ἐν δώμασι νύμφης; Studia Pontica 3 (1910) 26, Νύμφαι ἀκοσμήτοις ἐνὶ δώμασι ναιετάουσαι. If Peek’s text is correct, a close parallel for our our inscription is found in the nearby Thessalian city of Atrax, in an epigram com-memorating the foundation of a hilltop sanctuary for the Nymphs, ZPE 14 (1974) p. 21, I, plate 1, fig. I, [εἰπόν, τίς τόδε δῶμ]α̣ καὶ ἀ̣[ντί]α πᾶν ἐπόνη̣ [σεν], | [στήσας σὺν πολλ]οῖς θύμασιν ἀνθέματα,| [ὄχθαισιν Πηνειοῦ ὑ]πὸλ̣ λόφον ἀνθεμ[ό]-ε̣[ντα],| [ἧι ποσὶ δινοῦντ]α̣ι Να̣ΐδε̣ς̣ ἁβρόπεπλοι (full text and translation at p. 92 below). In this particular case, the term δῶμα refers to the stepped pathway that Pantalces hewed in the live rock of the cliff (line 15 below, τούσδε λίθους τύπτων ἐπόησ’ ἀναβαίνειν), but it may also be inclusive of a rudimentary architectural structure which appears to have been annexed to the cave proper. Fragments of rooft-iles were noted by the early visitors to the site on the small terrace below the cave entrance. As the interior of the cave was occupied in antiquity by a small stream, it seems per-fectly plausible that a subsidiary roof was added to house the basic functions of the cult (see Chapter 2.2.5 above). The fact that the majority of the archaeological remains were found outside the cave confirms this hypothesis. Karapla is not an isolated example. At cave sanctuaries it was often the case that the natural setting of the site had to be altered architecturally in order to comply with cul-tic needs. Inscriptions found at these locations emphasize the construction skills of their founders (the second half of our epigram accordingly praises the efforts of Thessalian Pantalces as a builder and a planter of sacred groves; see lines 10–19 below). Especially instructive in this regard is the comparison with the dedications of Archedamus of Thera at the cave of Vari on the Hymettus, where explicit architectural terminology is used for describing the outfitting of the sanctuary, IG I3, 977 b, 2–3 Νύνφαι<ς> ἐχσοικοδόμεσεν and IG I3, 980, 5–7 τἄντρον ἐξηργάξατο. See also Wagman 2011, pp. 748–751.8–9 ἱαρωτά τ’ ἐν αὐτῶι, | ἔμφυτα καὶ πίνακες καὶ ἀγάλματα δῶρά τε πολλ[ά] Whether they print: ἱαρωτά τ’ or: ἱαρώτατ’, all editors of Inscription II are unanimous in interpreting this word as an adjective modifying ἔμφυτα in the following line. Stylistically, however, the enjambement thus generated appears unjustified; contrast lines 21–22 below, κακῶν ἐπίλησις ἁπάν⟨των⟩ | ἐνθάδ’ ἔνεστ’, where such a device is purposefully applied to reinforce deixis. A preferable alternative (adopted by Connor in his English translation of 1988, p. 163; see also Larson 2001, p. 17) is to punctuate I, pp. 91–98), Asclepius is a much more widespread presence in cult than his teacher, with Asclepiea in all major centers of Thessaly (Semeria 1986, pp. 932–935; Riethmüller’s catalog lists evidence for worship at 26 sites besides our cave, 2005, II, pp. 143–314, nos. 143–176; cf. Mili 2015, appendix 1, nos. 175–201 et pass.). In Pharsalus the divine physician had a precinct at the east end of town, on the site of the modern metropolis of Agios Nikolaos; Stählin 1914, p. 7 and 1924, p. 141; Semeria 1986, pp. 934–935; see also Riethmüller 2005, II, pp. 291–293, no. 146 (who misunderstands however the topography of the area). Residents of the Varoussi neighborhood still refer to a rock-cut site south of the church as ‘Asclepius’ couch’ (Stählin’s “Fels mit Heiligtum bei Dexameni”, 1924, p. 138, fig. 9: l; cf. 1914, p. 7). In agreement with the arrangement reflected in this verse, the Pharsalian Asclepieum appears to have included the worship of personified Health, Hygieia, as attested by a votive relief of the Hellenistic period showing the goddess in the company of her father (Volos, Archaeological Museum 261; cf. Mitropoulou 1994, p. 492 VI, A, b). As in the rest of Greece, the two deities appear together in most Thessalian representations; one exception is a statue of the Hygieia Hope type now at the Volos Archaeological Museum, inv. Λ 268 (Mitropoulou 1994, p. 498; see also a dedication to Hygieia alone from the Larissa area (McDevitt no. 409 = AE 1933, Χρονικά, p. 2, 5).8 τούτων ἐστὶ τ[ὸ δ]ῶ̣[μα] ἅπαν Mildew stains and the weathering of the stone have disfig-ured the lettering in this section of the inscription. The res-torations τόδ’, ὦνα Πάν (Giannopoulos) and τ[ά]δ̣’, ὦνα Πάν (Decourt, commentary to IThess I, 73, p. 90, after Hondius ap. SEG 1, 248) are unmetrical as well as incongruous: what is an address to Pan doing in the middle of a speech, oth-erwise addressed from start to end to the visitors of the site? (χαίρετε τοὶ πα̣[ριόντες, line 3; ἀναβαίνετ[ε], θύετε, line 20; εὔχεσθε, εὐφραίνεσθε, line 21). Editors who support this restoration also read ἱαρώτατ’ instead of ἱαρωτά τ’ in the second half of the line, depriving the text of a perfectly sound Thessalian idiom (below, commentary to lines 8–9). As ἱαρωτά τ’ ἐν αὐτῶι implies, the word missing in the lacuna had to be another designation of space, like χῶρον in line 5 or ἄντρον in line 7. Peek’s τὸ χω⟨ρί⟩ον ἅπαν works well in this sense, but still fails to fit the metre. I propose to restore τ[ὸ δ]ῶ̣[μα] ἅπαν, which fits the traces on the stone (ΤΟΥΤΩΝΕΣΤΙΤ[..]Ω[.]ΑΠΑΝΙΑΡΩΤΑΤΕΝΑΥΤΩΙ: p. 67 above) as well as the missing metrical positions in this hexameter ‒‒ ‒⏑[⏑ ‒⏑ ]| ⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒‒, mutilated in its second and third biceps. Stylistically, the hiatus between δ]ῶ̣[μα] and ἅπαν is consistent with the extensive use of this feature throughout the poem, cf. lines 3, 5–9, 11–12, 16,"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"77The Inscriptions: inscription iimediate between the untamed wild and the carefully tended field of grain or pruned orchard. The garden might exhibit signs of planned improvement, such as a built fountain, but it was ideally a natural spot that already serendipitously possessed everything needed to appeal to human tastes and comforts” (2007, p. 58). The use of the Thessalian idiom ἱαρωτά—in a text oth-erwise not overloaded with regional traits—may have been intended to emphasize the local character of the cave’s ornamentation. The word ἱαρωτός is attested only once more in an inscription from Crannon of ca. 168 BCE, IG IX 2, 461 b, lines 36–38 [τόνε τὸ] [ψάφισμ]α ὀνγραφεῖ ἐν κίονα λιθίν[αν] [καὶ τ]εθ⟨ε⟩[ῖ] ΑΚΡΟΥΝ ἐν τοῖς ἱαρουτοῖς (i.e. “in the consecrated territory of the city”, Hoffmann 1893, II, pp. 38–39, no. 54; cf. Wilamowitz, IG IX 2, 461 b in app.). On ου for ω in Thessalian, see IG IX 2, p. 337, Indices, X. Exempla Sermonis Thessalici). ἱαρός or ἰαρός beside ἱερός are regular forms in Thessaly, where they appear later than in other West Greek dialects; see Buck 1955, p. 24. καὶ πίνακες καὶ ἀγάλματα δῶρά τε πολλ[ά]: the contents of the sanctuary—plantings, tablets, statuary—may be listed here in the order which visitors would see them as they made their progress from the planted area to the upper level of the shrine. Tablets would appear first, affixed by nails on trees or the walls of the cliff (cf. Chapter 3.3 above, Cat. nos. 2 a; 26); statues and figurines, probably displayed under cover on the ledge in front of the cave entrance, would become visible to incoming worshippers as these went up the shrine’s stairway. For a full discussion of the site’s layout see Chapter 2. Overall the information contained in this line is in agreement with the archaeo-logical record, which confirms that the great bulk of the cave’s votive collection (Chapter 3. 3, Cat. nos. 1–54; 57–58; 69–75) was made up by πίνακες and ἀγάλματα. These numbers may not seem enough to justify the expression δῶρά τε πολλ[ά] (see e.g. della Seta 1922–1923, p. 285, who refers to the Karapla findings as “scarce remains”); how-ever we should not forget that among the ‘many gifts’ were also a fair quantity of objects made of perishable material. Wooden tablets and figurines—such as the well-known panel paintings from the Pitsa cave (EAA 6, 1965, pp. 200–206, s.v. ‘Pitsa’) or the Νυμφέων ποιμενικὰ ξόανα cited in AP 9, 326—must have stood next to the clay ones. Toys, many of which were made of wood, were an equally common dedication in marriage and coming-of-age rituals for both sexes (AP 6, 280; 282; 309; discussion in Rouse 1902, pp. 249–251. On the offering of dolls to the Nymphs see Cat. no. 55 above and the observations by Larson 2001, pp. 101–120). A large number of additional articles fashioned out of organic materials (farming, hunting, and fishing equip-ment; household items; musical instruments; etc.) would after ἐν αὐτῶι, intending ἱαρωτά as a nominalised adjective followed by a list of appositives. Cf. a similar arrangement in line 3 above, τοὶ προσιόντες, ἅπας θῆλύς τε καὶ ἄρσην. Hanfmann (who reads: ἱαρωτά τ’ ἐν αὐτῶι ἔμφυτα, “and the sacred plants that grow in the cave”) believes that Pantalces might have kept a medicinal garden at the site, “perhaps in order to imitate the Chironion on Pelium” 1941, p. 486 (an idea also entertained by Decourt, IThess I, 73 p. 92). Chiron was closely associated with botanical medi-cine, as was his cultplace on Mt. Pelium—a mountain “rich in medical remedies” according to Heraclides Criticus, fr. 2, 8–12 Pfister, ἐπ’ ἄκρας δὲ τῆς τοῦ ὄρους κορυφῆς σπηλαῖόν ἐστι τὸ καλούμενον Χειρώνιον . . . τὸ δὲ ὄρος πολυφάρμακόν τέ ἐστι καὶ πολλὰς ἔχον καὶ παντοδαπὰς δυνάμεις τάς τε ὄψεις αὐτῶν γινώσκουσι καὶ χρῆσθαι δυναμένοις. Close ties with the world of medical plants also show Apollo, Hermes, Heracles and above all, Asclepius (Murr 1890, pp. 226–228; 232–233; 217–221; 225–226; on Asclepius see also Delatte 1936, p. 102); but whether the presence of a herb garden at our cave can be postulated on these grounds is doubtful—as doubtful is the assumption that such an establishment existed at the cave of Chiron on Pelium. We know that first fruit offerings in the form of roots and wild grasses (ῥίζαι γάρ εἰσι καὶ βοτάναι, Plu. Quaes. Conv. 647a, 1) were made to Chiron by the Magnesians; the use of cultivated herbs, on the other hand, is not recorded. For a modern ethno-botanical perspective on the topic, see Brussell 2004; on Thessaly’s reputation as a ‘Land Rich in Herbs’: Mili 2015, pp. 259–299 (especially 290–292).ἔμφυτα: based on line 12 below, ὅσπερ ταῦτ’ ἐφύτευσε, most scholars interpret this word in the sense of ‘plant-ings’, arbitrarily transferring to it the meaning of φυτεύειν (or rather, ἐμφυτεύειν: for the use of ἐμφυτεύω in refer-ence to temple gardening, see a sacred law from Amorgus, IG XII 7, 62, lines 34–35: ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ἐμφυτ[εύ]-|[σηι] τὰ φυτά, ἀποτεισάτω ἑκάστου δραχμήν). Thus, e.g., Decourt, who finds the “shift from ‘natural’ to ‘cultivated’ ” to be a semantically acceptable transition (IThess I, 73, p. 92). Other critics (Connor 1988, Larson 2001) adopt a more prudent stance, translating ἔμφυτα as φυτά, ‘things which grow’—presumably in contrast with the inani-mate objects also dedicated as gifts at the cave. In fact, by emphasizing natural growth over cultivation, ἔμφυτα (τὰ κατὰ φύσιν ὑπάρχοντα, Lexicon Patmense p. 153) appears to draw an intentional distinction between forms of veg-etation native to the cave and the embellishments added by Pantalces (line 12 below, ὅσπερ ταῦτ’ ἐφύτευσε καὶ ἐξεπονήσατο χερσσίν). The harmonious juxtaposition of natural and landscaped environments was a desideratum in the Greek conception of sacred space. As Larson writes, “to the Greeks, a ‘garden of the nymphs’ was a space inter-"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"78chapter 4δυνατὸς ἀεί τινος ἀγαθοῦ παραίτιος γίνεσθα̣ι ̣, κατὰ κοινόν | τε καὶ κατ’ ἰδίαν ἑκάστωι ἡμῶν εὔχρηστον παρεχόμενος αὑτὸν τοῖς χρείαν ἔχουσιν· | ἵνα οὖν κ[αὶ] Μάγνητες ε̣ὐ̣[χά]ρ̣ι ̣σ̣ τ̣ο[ι ὄντ]ες | φαίνωνται καὶ τιμῶντες το[ὺ]ς̣ ἀ[νδραγαθή]σ̣ αν[τας, δεδόχθαι τοῖς] | συνέδροις ἐπ[α]ι[νέ]σα̣ι ̣ τε [Πολ]ε[μαῖον Ἁρ]-π̣ αγ[ίωνος Καλυ]-|δών[ιον] ἐπ̣ ὶ [τούτοις] καὶ δεδόσθαι αὐτῶι καὶ ἐκγόνοις παρὰ τῶν | Μαγνήτων [προξ]ενίαν καὶ τἆλλα τίμια καὶ φιλάνθρωπα ὅσα | καὶ τοῖς ἄλ[λοις προ]ξένοις ἡμῶν ὑπάρχει.Otherwise the qualification ἀνὴρ ἀγαθός is ordinarily bestowed upon Thessalians fallen in battle, as in a fifth century epitaph from the countryside northwest of our cave, IG IX 2, 255 = CEG I, 117, [μνᾶμα τό]δ’ ἁ μάτε̄ρ Διοκλέαι ἔσστασ’ Ἐχεναὶς | [πολλὰ γο]ο̑σα ὅτ’ ἀνο̄́ρο̄ς ὄ̄λετο ὂ̄ν ἀγαθός. | - - - -]ολεα τεὸς ἀδελφεὸς ἔσστα Γέλο̄[νο?]ς. | [πᾶς δὲ κα]τοικτίρας ἄνδρα ἀγαθὸν παρίτο̄ (commentary in Lorenz 1976, pp. 46–2).Considered in this light, the designation of Pantalces as ἀνὴρ ἀγαθός in line 10 proves to be more nuanced than it may have seemed at first. On one hand we are reminded of the official language used to recognize distinction in service—casu quo, ‘outstanding’ service on behalf of the Nymphs—on the other, the phrasing seems to suggest an ‘ennoblement’ similar to that of the heroic dead, confer-ring on Pantalces’ deeds an unmistakebly epic resonance. This epic frame of reference, mantained throughout the rest of the poem, is consistent with local tradition, as the Pharsalian elites traced their ancestry to the quintessen-tial epic hero, Achilles (commentary to line 7 above; cf. pp. 87–88 below). Rather than some kind of peasant sage or holy man, as it has been hitherto assumed (e.g. Decourt, commentary to IThess I, 73; Connor 1988), Pantalces appears to have been commemorated by his countrymen as one of the noble dead, using iconographical conven-tions proper of upper class ideology. ἐποιήσα⟨ν⟩τ’ . . . εἶναι: cf. ἐπόησ’ ἀναβαίνειν in line 15. The use of ποιεῖν with the infinitive—which has respect-able epic antecedents, e.g. Od. 23, 258–259, ἐπεὶ ἄρ σε θεοὶ ποίησαν ἱκέσθαι οἶκον—is well-suited to convey the ‘trans-formative’ power of an encounter with the Nymphs (the term is borrowed from Pache 2011). Interaction with the goddesses is portrayed in the literary and epigraphical evi-dence as an experience of varying intensity: from the feel-ings of well-being associated with certain types of natural landscape (the loci amoeni of pastoral literature) to rav-ing madness and even death, the Nymphs were thought capable of eliciting various kinds of psychophysiological responses in human beings. Within these altered states, grouped under the label of nympholepsy, were some compulsive forms of devotionalism involving extended have also filled the displays of a country shrine: their exis-tence we can only surmise from literary descriptions and the evidence of extant sanctuary archives; cf. the indexes to Rouse 1902, pp. 394–408.III  Lines 10–13: Pantalces’ Tale: His ‘Investiture’ by the Nymphs and Aition of the SanctuaryIn the couplet that follows, readers are introduced to the founder of the sanctuary, Pantalces, and the story of how he was chosen by the Nymphs to oversee their grounds. Although only two lines long, the section is important in that it establishes the theme of Pantalces’ ἀνδραγαθία, fur-ther elaborated in the remainder of the poem through the symbolic associations of the gifts bestowed upon him by the other cave gods. 10–11 ἄνδρα δ’ ἐποιήσα⟨ν⟩τ’{α} ἀγαθὸν Παντάλκεα Νύμφαι | τῶνδ’ ἐπιβαινέμεναι χώρων καὶ ἐπίσσκοπον εἶναιἄνδρα . . . ἀγαθόν: following a semantic evolution parallel to that of ἀρετή, from its original use in reference to mili-tary valour and aristocratic status, during the fifth century BCE the expression ἀνὴρ ἀγαθός came to denote worthi-ness in a broader sense, particularly in connection with services rendered to the state (e.g. trade-related services; see Engen 2010, pp. 121–123). Official recognition of these virtues was crystallized in the formulae ἀνδραγαθίας ἕνεκα or ἀρετῆς ἕνεκα καὶ ἀνδραγαθίας, found in over a hundred inscriptions from Attica (Veligianni-Terzi 1997) and other regions. As D. Whitehead writes, the abstractification of the Homeric ἀνὴρ ἀγαθός into ἀνδραγαθία was born from a “need to find . . . an agathos-abstract free from the elit-ist and necrological baggage of the past that aretê brought with it” (1993, p. 61; cf. 1983, p. 61). The class implications of this terminology did not entirely disappear with the new practice: the politically charged preface to Isyllus’ paean in IG IV2 1, 128, is an example of how ἀνδραγαθία was inter-preted in an oligarchic context such as Epidaurus ca. 300 BCE, δᾶμος εἰς ἀριστοκρατίαν ἄνδρας αἰ προάγοι καλῶς, | αὐτὸς ἰσχυρότερος· ὀρθοῦται γὰρ ἐξ ἀνδραγαθίας (lines 3–4). In Thessaly, where aristocratic forms of government sur-vived well into the fourth century BCE—along with the ideologies and traditions which supported them—we can expect these phraseologies to have also retained some of its original elitist connotations. Significantly, ἀνδραγαθία and καλοκαγαθία appear within a few lines from one other in a proxeny decree of the Magnesian League from the late second century BCE (SEG 32, 613), ἐπεὶ Πολεμαῖος Ἁρπαγίωνος Καλυδώνιος, ἀνὴρ καλὸς καὶ ἀγαθός, | εὐνόως διακείμενος πρὸς πάντας Μάγνητας πειρᾶται καθ’ ὅσον ἐ-|στὶν"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"79The Inscriptions: inscription ii[ἄλλα πολλ]ά), and appears to have headed a college of seers (μαντιάρχης? Mitford 1980, no. 258 b.1, Ὀνεσα[γόρου· ἀγαθῆι] vac. τύχῃ· μαν̣ζιαρχήσαντος). A hieratic function may also be implied in Archedamus’ cryptic self-reference as ὀ<ρ>χεστὲ[ς] in IG I3, 977.12 ὅσπερ ταῦτ’ ἐφύτευσε καὶ ἐ̣ξεπονήσατο χερσσίνὅσπερ . . . ἐφύτευσε: the use of the emphatic relative pro-noun, combined with deixis (ταῦτ’), effectively redirects the readers’ attention from the text of the poem to the physical world around them. The focus is on the the area immediately surrounding the inscription, a terraced part of the hill which Pantalces adapted as a sacred garden or grove (ἐφύτευσε καὶ ἐ̣ξεπονήσατο χερσσίν). A few lines later, the same syntagma is deployed to call attention on the steep stairway, cut by Pantalces in the live rock of the cliff (τούσδε λίθους τύπτων ἐπόησ’ ἀναβαίνειν, line 15), which leads from this terrace to the cave proper. Description is kept to the essential: all the text does is ‘point’ at these two landscape features (ταῦτ’, line 12; τούσδε λίθους, line 15), leaving the appreciation of the details to the visitors themselves. The main concern is to identify the author of the work and the divinities for whom the work was done. In this the Karapla inscription follows a traditional scheme widely attested in inscribed epigrams; see e.g. Day 2010, pp. 6–7 et pass.ἐ̣ξεπονήσατο: cf. the above cited dedication to the Nymphs from Atrax, ZPE 14 (1974) p. 21, I, line 1, [εἰπόν, τίς τόδε δῶμ]α̣ καὶ ἀ̣[ντί]α πᾶν ἐπόνη̣ [σεν]. In our text the use of the deponent form πονέομαι is an archaism, see LSJ, s.v. πονέω, πονέομαι, A (on πονέομαι with the accusative, ibid. A, II; for an epigraphic example, see e.g. a Carian funerary epigram from Rhodian Peraea, IRhodB 209, ὅτ’ Ἄρεος ἔργα ἐπονεῖτο). χερσσίν: on -σσ- see commentary to line 11 above, ἐπίσσκοπον. The expression ‘to labor with one’s hands’, is common in epigrammatic poetry, with both epigraphical and literary examples; see e.g. GVI 1425, <μν>αμεῖον τόδε σεῖο πατὴρ ἐπόνησεν ἑαυτο[ῦ] χερσὶν, πᾶσιν ὁρᾶν, σᾶς ἀρετᾶς ἕνεκεν; AP 6, 61, line 6, χερσί σε ταῖς ἰδίαις ἐξεπόνησε Χάρις. 13 ἀντίδοσαν δ’ αὐτῶι βίον ἄφθονον ἤματα πάνταLine 13 marks a thematic transition from the story of Pantalces’ ‘investiture’ to the catalog of blessings bestowed upon him by the cave gods, with ἀντίδοσαν introducing the key motif of the next section (δίδωμι is a culturally ‘charged’ word which can denote human as well as divine giving, thus encompassing the entire range of this exchange-based relationship; see LSJ, s.v. δίδωμι, 2–3). This concept of reciprocity also appears in the inscriptions of other cult founders, such as Onesagoras of Cyprus (. . . Ν]ύμφη . . . periods of withdrawal from society and complete self-dedication to the goddesses’ worship (the classic study on the topic is that by Connor 1998; see now the remarks by Versnel 2011, pp. 129–130). In Pantalces’ case, since the events are presented through the lens of a later aetiologi-cal narrative, the encounter with the Nymphs is rational-ized as a form of ennoblement by which the founder is granted the virtues proper of an ideal κτίστης (cf. Schirripa 2009, who sees abduction narratives in Nymph lore as a “precise metaphor for heroization”, p. 83).Νύμφαι | . . . ἐπιβαινέμεναι: ἐπιβαινέμεναι is an epi-cism modeled on Homeric ἐπιβαινέμεν, Od. 9, 101, νηῶν ἐπιβαινέμεν ὠκειάων; cf. A.R. 1, 705–706, γαίης τε καὶ ἄστεος . . . | . . . θαρσαλέως ἐπιβαινέμεν. On the example of Il. 14, 226 and Od. 5, 550 some scholars take ἐπιβαινέμεναι to signify a descent of the Nymphs from up high (‘to inter-vene in Pantalkes’ life’, Pache 2011, p. 54, following a previ-ous idea by Decourt, commentary to IThess I, 73, p. 92); this interpretation is incompatible however with the grammar of the passage, since ἐπιβαίνειν in the sense of ‘landing’, ‘lighting upon’ would require an accusative of place (LSJ, s.v. ἐπιβαίνω, III; cf. Peek 1938, p. 24, who had independently considered the possibility of correcting the stone’s τῶνδ’ . . . χώρων into τ⟨ό⟩νδ’ . . . χῶρων). There is in fact nothing wrong with the meaning provided by the ordinary genitive construction—“the Nymphs who tread these places” being an image well-suited to the local-ized character of the cult. τῶνδ’ . . . χώρων looks backward to χῶρον δ’ εἰς ἱερὸν in line 5; for the deictic element cf. τούσδε λίθους in line 15 below (also: ταῦτ’ line 12; ἐνθάδ’ line 22). καὶ ἐπίσσκοπον: as confirmed by its later usage in ecclesiastical administration, ἐπίσκοπος is a word with both bureaucratic and sacred overtones, used to denote state officers (e.g. in a Rhodian decree of the 1st century BCE, καὶ τοὶ συνάρξαντες | πρυτάνιες, γραμματεὺς βουλᾶς, | στραταγοί, ταμίαι, ἀστυνόμοι | ἀγωνοθέται, γυμνασίαρχοι, | ἐπίσκοποι . . ., IRhodM 20, lines 5–9) as well as tute-lary gods (χώρας τοῖς πολισσούχοις θεοῖς, | πεδιονόμοις τε κἀγορᾶς ἐπισκόποις, A. Th. 271–272); for the spelling cf. line 12 χερσσίν; further examples of –σσ- for -σ- can be found in IG IX 2, p. 337 (Indices, X. Exempla Sermonis Thessalici). Pantalces’ appointment may be compared to similar ‘offices’ mentioned in the inscriptions of other cult found-ers: Artemidorus was ‘priest’ of his own rock-cut sanctu-ary in Thera (IG XII, 3, 1345, lines 3–5, ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσι | . . . . | . . . ὅσοις ἱερεὺς τέμενος κτίσεν Ἀρτεμίδωρος), while the Cypriot Onesagoras, builder of a nymphaeum near Kafizin, served as ritual barber and tithe collector (Mitford 1980, no. 46, lines 1–3, ἀγαθῆι τύχηι· | Νύμφηι Ἀδελφῆι [Ὀνησ]-α̣γ[ό]ρας Φιλουνίου κου[ρεὺς] | [ὁ] δεκατηφόρος ἐμή τε καὶ"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"80chapter 414–15 Ἡρακλέης μὲν ἔδ⟨ω⟩κ’ ἰσχὺν ἀρετήν τε κράτος τε | ὧιπερ τούσδε λίθους τύπτων ἐπόησ’ ἀναβαίνεινPossibly two of the most successful verses in this poem (“besonders hübsch” Peek 1938, p. 24, who also praises the poetic quality of lines 18 and 19). ἰσχὺν ἀρετήν τε κράτος τε effectively encapsulates the Greek ideal of physical prowess applied to the attainment of excellence. This ideological construct is most appropriately personified by Heracles, the quintessential athlete and questing hero of Greek myth. The quest for ἀρετή plays an important role in Herculean mythology and symbolism, as shown by the well-known parable of Prodicus of Ceus, in which the hero, confronted at a crossroads by the opposite personi-fications of Ἀρετή and Κακία, bravely choses the difficult but glorious path of the former over the easy but undistin-guished one of the latter (X. Mem. 2, 1, 21–34). It has been recognized that, with their emphasis on “individual glory and solitary accomplishment”, Heracles’ athletic pursuits reflect an aristocratic value system (Gregory 1991, p. 148; for a full discussion of the topic see Csapo 2005, pp. 304–315). Not surprisingly the hero is attested as a patron of gymnasia and aristocratic clubs: an illustrative example is the gymnasium of Cynosarges in Athens, where Heracles was served ritual meals with a fraternity of highborn indi-viduals known as the ‘half-breeds’ (νόθοι) of Cynosarges (Polem. Hist. FHG 3, 78; see Humphreys 1974, pp. 88–95), and similar institutions are attested at various Thessalian locations (e.g. the Ἡρακλεισταί of Atrax: AD 34, 1979, Χρονικά, p. 226, no. 20 = Heinz 1998, pp. 303–304, no. 237; cf. Mili 2015, pp. 124–125; see also, at Pherae, the god’s asso-ciation with the ὑλουροί, or ‘forest wardens’, the officials charged with the mantainance of the countryside, AD 33, 1978, pp. 318–324 = Heinz 1998, pp. 304–306, nos. 238–239; cf. Mili 2015, pp. 123–124). Considered in this light, Heracles’ tutelage confers to Pantalces’ labors a distinctly heroic aura through the implicit comparison with his own ἄθλα. Line 14 thus reinforces the motif of the founder’s ἀνδραγαθία discussed in connection with the ‘investiture’ story (above, line 10), deploying concepts and iconography proper of aristocratic aesthetics. ἰσχὺν . . . κράτος τε: ἰσχύς and κράτος are conceptually akin terms (Theoph. Ant. Ad Autol. 1, 3, ἴσχυν ἐὰν εἴπω, κράτος αὐτοῦ λέγω) linked to one another also in medical writing, e.g. Aret. CD 2, 6, 1, ἐς ἰσχὺν καὶ κράτος τοῦ σώματος. As god-given ‘gifts’ we find them again in Classically inspired Christian literature: Ph. De providentia fr. 2, 38, ὁ Θεός . . . ἰσχὺν καὶ κράτος δίδωσι τοῖς τὰς φύσεις ἀρχικοῖς. τούσδε λίθους τύπτων ἐπόησ’ ἀναβαίνειν: literally “pound-ing these rocks he made them go up”, i.e., “he turned them into a stairway” (τούσδε λίθους refers to a series of [ἀ]ρετῆς ἕνεκεν ὁ̑ν χ[ρυσὸ]ν ἀντιτεί[νεις, Mitford 1980, no. 291, line 1–5; cf. Pache 2011, p. 68), or Artemidorus of Perge (ἡ δ’ Ὁμόνοια θεὰ βωμοῦ χάριν ἀνταπέδωκε | τὸν στέφανον παρὰ τῆς πόλεως μέγαν Ἀρτεμιδώρωι, IG XII 3, 1341–1342, lines 3–4). On the da quia dedi, do ut des arguments in Greek prayers and cult poetry, see Pulleyn 1997, pp. 16–38; Furley 2007, 124–127. Another recurring theme which is introduced in line 13 is that of Pantalces’ life-long prosper-ity (cf. αἰῶν’ εἰς τὸν ἅπαντα . . . βίον ἐσθλόν in line 17 below). βίος ἄφθονος is a ‘life of means’, see e.g. Ath. Deipn. 7, 12, 21 = Philetaer. PCG VII, fr. 13, θνητῶν δ’ ὅσοι ζῶσιν κακῶς ἔχοντες ἄφθονον βίον, ἐγὼ μὲν αὐτοὺς ἀθλίους εἶναι λέγω; cf. also Hdt. 2, 121a; TrGF iii, 196. This belief in the Nymphs’ power to grant a comfortable life is also reflected in Menander’ Dyscolus, where Pan and the goddesses reciprocate the attentions of Cnemon’s daughter by engineering her marriage to a wealthy urbanite (Dysc. 36–44); the most striking illustration of the concept is found, however, at the nymphaeum of Kafizin in Cyprus, where a nameless Nymph was worshipped by an association of local busi-nessmen (Mitford 1980: see also Larson 2001, pp. 257–258; Pache 2011, pp. 55–69). ἤματα πάντα: the formula—one of several Homerisms found throughout the text—frames the description of the Nymph’s ἀντίδοσις in a heroic sce-nario, recalling similar lifelong privileges granted to the heroes of the Trojan cycle; cf. Od .4, 209–211, ὡς νῦν Νέστορι δῶκε (sc. Zeus) διαμπερὲς ἤματα πάντα | αὐτὸν μὲν λιπαρῶς γηρασκέμεν ἐν μεγάροισιν, | υἱέας αὖ πινυτούς τε καὶ ἔγχεσιν εἶναι ἀρίστους.IV Lines 14–19: The Rewards Granted to Pantalces by the Cave GodsThe tale of the cave’s foundation continues with the cata-log of the rewards received by Pantalces in return for his devotion. The ‘gifts’, which include material goods as well as physical and moral qualities, are assigned according to each god’s specific domain. The nine godheads introduced in lines 5–7 reappear in this section in a different arrange-ment, individually (Heracles, Pan, Chiron) or in new groupings (Apollo, Asclepius, Hermes, Hygieia), depend-ing on their sphere of influence. The concept of divine ‘giving’, first introduced by ἀντίδοσαν in line 13, forms the key motif of this section, with three variants of the verb (14 ἔδ⟨ω⟩κ’, 16 δίδωσι, 19 δῶκε) occurring at brief intervals from one another. The pattern is strongly reminiscent of folk-tale structure: it is tempting to see a similarity between the gods of the Karapla foundation story and the appo-sitely named ‘donors’ of Propp’s analysis, the supernatural patrons who traditionally assist the hero in the fulfillment of his quest (Morphology of the Folktale, 1968)."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"81The Inscriptions: inscription iiingly υἱὸς τοῦδε is “Heracles’ son” in Borgeaud 1995 (p.295: the original French edition of 1993, p. 276, reads “le fils de celui-ci”). As mythology and internal symmetry require, the unnamed god is Asclepius, cited by his full name at line 7 with Hygieia and Chiron. The understated manner of Asclepius’ second appearance—all the more surprising in a line dedicated to the healing motif—could simply be a matter of metre. His subordination to Apollo is almost a formulaic trait: in Burkert’s words, “Asklepios is always the son of Apollo who is himself accorded the epithet Doctor, Iatros” (1985, p. 147). Interestingly Hygieia is also brought back in an oblique manner: unlike all other deities in the poem she reappears here not as the bestower of a gift but as the gift itself, according to a motif also noted in the paean of Isyllus (Ἀσκλα|πιὸν . . . δωτῆρ’ ὑγιείας, IG IV2 1, 128, lines 51–52. Asclepius himself is invoked in hymnic poetry as μέγα δώρημα βροτοῖς, ibid. line 53; cf. IG II2, 4514, line 20). For an interpretation of Hygieia as “a useful means of representing Asklepios’ ‘product’” see Stafford 2000, p. 167. καὶ Ἑρμῆς: the regrouping of this countryside god with two medical deities such as Apollo and Asclepius may be explained in light of Thessalian cult, which emphasized Hermes’ mediatory role between life and death (Hermes Chthonius). Alternatively Hermes may be present here as Eriunius, ‘The Helper’, a faculty which gives him jurisdiction over the granting of βίος ἐσθλός, ‘good livelihood’. On this notion of ‘good’ or ‘respectable’ revenue see e.g. Hes. Op. 633–634, ὥς περ ἐμός τε πατὴρ καὶ σός, μέγα νήπιε Πέρση, | πλωίζεσκ’ ἐν νηυσί, βίου κεχρημένος ἐσθλοῦ); the belief in Hermes’ power to facilitate finan-cial gain is encapsulated in a graffito from the Caseggiato degli Aurighi in Ostia, ̔Ερμῆ δίκαιε, κέρδος ̔Εκτίκωι [δί]δου, Solin 1972, pp. 194–195). Such a reference to mate-rial wealth—the second one after βίον ἄφθονον in line 13—is not incompatible with the healing theme of the section. Health and financial security were two of the three most desirable blessings which the gods could bestow upon a Greek, the third one being relief from war or strife (see commentary to lines 21–22 below). Requests for a lifelong grant (αἰῶν’ εἰς τὸν ἅπαντα, cf. 13 ἤματα πάντα) of one, two, or all three of these conditions constitute the focus of most extant Greek prayers: cf. IG II2, 4473, lines 19–20, ἐς αἰ[εὶ θ]άλλειν | ἐν βιοτῇ σὺν τερπνοτάτῃ Ὑγιείᾳ, and the additional examples cited in the commentary to line 22 below. For a general discussion of the subject see the study by Versnel 1981 (especially the section on ‘Gebetsegoismus’, with ear-lier bibliography, pp. 17–21).18 Πὰν δὲ γέλωτα καὶ εὐφροσύνην ὕβριν τε δικαίανγέλωτα καὶ εὐφροσύνην: two words frequently used in com-bination, especially to denote festive merrymaking (exam-ples range from Homer to Late Antiquity and beyond, boulders, immediately to the left of the inscription, fash-ioned by Pantalces into a rudimentary flight of stairs; for a full discussion of this structure, see Chapter 2 above). Ἀναβαίνω, ‘to be upward bound’, is an appropriate verb for stairs, see ἀνάβασις = κλίμαξ in Ginouvès et al. 1985, II, p. 197 (other similarly coined terms for ‘stairs’ include ἀναβαθμός, ἀναβασμός, ἀναβάθρα). In light of these consid-erations, Larson’s translation, “he smote the stones and made a way up”, 2001 p. 17, is preferable to Connor’s “he struck these stones and built them up”, 1988 p. 163 (italics mine). The general sense of the passage is that given by Comparetti, “He [sc. Pantalces] . . . was able to complete the other, no less Herculean task of levelling out, blow by blow (τύπτων), that harsh and unyielding rock, so as to facilitate the access, or climb (ἐπόησ’ ἀναβαίνειν), to the sacred cave”, 1923–1924’ p. 152; on Pantalces “leveller of rocks” (“spianatore di . . . rocce”), see also p. 151. Rock is an appropriate building material for a nymphaeum, cf. the above cited dedication to the Nymphs from Atrax ZPE 14 (1974) p. 21, I, lines 5–6, Ν[α]ϊά̣[σ]ιν Νύμφαισι . . . [δ]ῶ̣[μά] τ̣ε̣ ἵδ̣ρ̣[υ]σ[ε π]έ̣τ̣ρ̣οις. Indeed, whether they inhabit a spring or a cave—two natural milieus often found in close contiguity—Nymphs appear to be inti-mately associated with the live rock of the Greek moun-tains: in vase-painting they are shown near rock-piles (as in the depiction of the Ismenian Spring in a calyx crater at the Louvre, N3157), while in prayers they are addressed as νύμφαι πετραῖαι, “Nymphs of the Rocks” (as in Aegisthus’ sacrificial prayer in E. El. 805). Like other human activi-ties that took place in a mountain setting, stone-quarrying fell under the tutelage of the goddesses; cf. the Nymph cults associated with the marble quarries of Penteli (Zoridis 1977; Wickens 1986, pp. 202–211, no. 39) and Paros (Bodnar 1973; Larson 2001, pp. 179–181). An awareness of the special connotations of live rock transpires from the inscriptions of other founders of rupestral shrines; see e.g. Artemidorus’ dedication of a stone-hewn dolphin in his privately mantained precinct outside the town of Thera, IG XII 3, 1347, πέτραι ἐν ἀκαμάτηι δελφῖνα θεοῖσιν ἔτευξεν | εὔνουν ἀνθρώποις νενομισμένον Ἀρτεμίδωρος (Palagia 1992, fig. 48 c, van Straten 1993, fig. 27).16–17 Ἀπόλλων δὲ δίδωσι καὶ υἱὸς τοῦδε καὶ Ἑρμῆς | αἰῶν’ εἰς τὸν ἅπαντα ὑγίειαν καὶ βίον ἐσθλόνApollo and Hermes reappear in these verses in the com-pany of an unnamed deity referred to as Apollo’s son. With very exceptions (Pache 2011, p. 54: see now Mili 2015, pp. 145 and 177), most existing English translations of Inscription II fail to render line 16 correctly: Connor (1998, p. 163), followed by Larson and Aston (2001, p. 17; 2006, p. 360; see also Bonnechere 2001, p. 35 and note 23) impos-sibly identifies Apollo’s son as Hermes; even more surpris-"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"82chapter 4293–296; Halliwell 2008, pp. 307–331, especially 322–325). Long before it was discussed in Aristotle’s books, this par-ticular aspect of social etiquette constituted a concern of early aristocratic society, the Homeric suitors providing the oldest and most iconic example of offensive hilarity of all Greek literature. Not surprisingly sympotic self-control is an important principle in Theognis’ praecepts about the proper conduct of the 6th century gentleman: ‘Ἐν μὲν συσσίτοισιν ἀνὴρ πεπνυμένος εἶναι.’ | πάντα δέ μιν λήθειν ὡς ἀπεόντα δοκεῖ. | εἰς δὲ φέροι τὰ γελοῖα—θύρηφιν καρτερὸς εἴη— | γινώσκων ὀργὴν ἥντιν’ ἕκαστος ἔχει (308–311). More than a hundred years later the concept continued to live on as part of the social anxieties of Late Classical city sophisticates; significantly we find echoes of it in an anon-ymous elegy roughly contemporary to our epigram, IEG 27, lines 1–4 (fourth century BCE): χαίρετε συμπόται ἄνδρες ὁμ[......· ἐ]ξ ἀγαθοῦ γὰρ | ἀρξάμενος τελέω τὸν λόγον [ε]ἰ̣ς ἀγα̣[θό]ν̣. | χρὴ δ’, ὅταν εἰς τοιοῦτο̣ συνέλθωμεν φίλοι ἄνδρες | πρᾶγμα, γελᾶν παίζειν χρησαμένους ἀρετῆι. That a motif so closely associated with the lifestyle of urban elites should appear in a rural context such as ours is a fact which com-mands attention. To be sure, opportunities for commu-nal drinking must not have been completely absent in the Pharsalian countryside, nor should we expect that all guests at Pharsalian symposia could claim a blue-blooded lineage (e.g. Ar. V. 1270–1274 with the comments by Ducat 1994, pp. 15–17, and Mili 2015, p. 117), but overall it is reason-able to assume that the aesthetics of jesting and drinking held little interest for the scattered mountainfolk of the Karapla hill. Peasantry is traditionally depicted in Greek literature as lacking in both humour and table manners (on the humourlessness of the ἄγροικος: Arist. EN 1128a, 9; EE 1234a, 5, with the discussion by Cullyer 2006, pp. 191–196; cf. Borgeaud 1995, p. 294; Halliwell 2008, p. 322. On the ἄγροικος at dinner: Anaxandr. PCG II, fr. 1; Antiph. PCG II, fr. 69; see also the overview by Konstantakos 2005, pp. 11–21). Rather, this portrayal of Pantalces as a fun yet proper banqueteer was more likely to appeal to the city crowd that attended the banquets of the local notables and had a better grasp of the issues involved. Thessalians were notorious in Greece for the wild nature of their par-ties, which are routinely described in Late Classical litera-ture as a rowdy mix of opulence and immoderate behavior (e.g. Theopompus, who specifies that Pharsalians were the worst of all: FGrH 115, F 49 and 81; cf. Mnesim. PCG VII, fr. 8: on these perceptions about Thessaly, see Pownall 2009; also: Stamatopoulou 2007a, p. 327; Richter 2011, p. 24; Mili 2015, pp. 175 and 262–266). Line 18 thus calls into question the common assumption that the poetry in Inscription II was mostly the product of a localized peasant culture, suggesting that the urban element in the demographics Od. 20, 8, γυναῖκες / ἤϊσαν, αἳ μνηστῆρσιν ἐμισγέσκοντο πάρος περ, / ἀλλήλῃσι γέλω τε καὶ εὐφροσύνην παρέχουσαι; Lib. Decl. 48, 1, 56, νῦν γὰρ ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ μοι τὰ πράγματα καὶ ᾠδαῖς καὶ γέλωτι;). Convivial cheer, such as it would occur at the cave after a sacrifice (cf. the progression θύετε/εὔχεσθε/εὐφραίνεσθε in lines 20–21 below and, for a famous illustration of the revelries that could take place in caves, the final act of Menander’s Dyscolus) was under the tutelage of Pan and the Nymphs, who received regular prayers at banquets and wedding parties; see, e.g., an Attic drinking song cited by Athenaeus where the Goat God is asked to bless the banqueteers with his own laughter, ὀρχηστὰ βρομίαις ὀπαδὲ Νύμφαις,| γελάσειας ὦ Πὰν ἐπ’ ἐμαῖς | †εὐφροσύναις ταῖσδ’ ἀοιδαῖς αοιδε† κεχαρημένος (Deipn. 15, 50 = PMG 887) and another version of the same prayer in Ar. Thes. 976–979, Ἑρμῆν τε νόμιον ἄντομαι | καὶ Πᾶνα καὶ Νύμφας φίλας ἐπιγελάσαι προθύμως | ταῖς ἡμετέραισι | χαρέντα χορείαις. Laughter and mirth have however a neg-ative side, as they can degenerate into hubris, particularly if fuelled by wine: Ὁ οἶνος, εἰ καιρίως καὶ μετρίως ποθείη, ἅτε τιμηθείς, εὐφροσύνης αἴτιος γίνεται. Εἰ δὲ παροινηθείη, ἀμύνεται τὴν ὕβριν, καὶ δίκας ἀπαιτεῖ τοὺς ὑβρίσαντας, γέλωτα καὶ αἰσχύνην, καὶ κωμῳδίαν, καὶ μώλωπας αὐτοῖς προξενῶν (thus Isidore of Pelusium, Epist. 1272, writing in the fifth century CE, but the concept of objectionable laughter is already found in Homer; cf. the shameless con-duct of Penelope’s housemaids in the above cited passage from the Odyssey). Pan’s help is crucial for keeping hubris within acceptable limits, since this god has the power to both soothe or exacerbate excessive behavior: Pan can use laughter to bring gaiety among the assembled gods (h.Pan. 45–47, πάντες δ’ ἄρα θυμὸν ἔτερφθεν ἀθάνατοι . . . Πᾶνα δέ μιν καλέεσκον ὅτι φρένα πᾶσιν ἔτερψε) or drive an unfortunate parasite to a paroxystic fit (POxy III, 413, line 173, τάλας, δοκῶ πανό̣λημπτος γέγονεν ὁ παράσιτος· τάλας, γελᾷ; cf. Borgeaud 1988, pp. 107–108). Considered in this light, ὕβρις δικαία in the second part of the line can also be linked to the sympotic sphere as the climactic element in a trico-lon depicting the progressive stages of revelry: laughter, euphoria, excess. Stylistically ὕβρις δικαία is very effective in capturing the reader’s attention with its oxymoronic force (on the legal implications of sympotic ὕβρις see e.g. Murray 1983, pp. 268–270). Odd as the comparison may seem, the closest parallel for this striking hapax is found in Aristotle’s Rhetoric, in a passage where the philosopher describes the inclination of upper class youths for banter as ‘educated excess’, φιλογέλωτες, διὸ καὶ φιλευτράπελοι· ἡ γὰρ εὐτραπελία πεπαιδευμένη ὕβρις ἐστίν (1389b, 11–12: technically Aristotle’s comment is not about sympotic jesting, but the conceptual and sociocultural contexts are similar; Fisher 1992, pp. 91–92, note 41; Borgeaud 1995, pp."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"83The Inscriptions: inscription iiastic arrangement of long and short syllabic sequences (ἀναβαίνετ[ε]/θύετε: εὔχεσθε/εὐφραίνεσθε = ABBA), gives these lines the feeling of a live conversation.τύχαις ἀγαθαῖς: cf. τύχ[α] in the heading of the inscrip-tion, line 2 above. Expressions of good wish can frame the text of a document both at the beginning and the end (see, e.g., a foundation text of AD 209–210 from Parthicopolis in Macedonia, IGBulg IV 2265, lines 1, ἀγαθῆι τύχηι, and 25, εὐτυχεῖτε). ἀναβαίνε[τε]: i.e. ‘take the stairs’ to the sacri-ficial area of the sanctuary (Chapter 2.2.4 and 2.3, p. 32); cf. line 15 above, τούσδε λίθους τύπτων ἐπόησ’ ἀναβαίνειν. As J.C. Decourt observes (commentary to IThess I, 73, p. 92) the resulting contrast between human ἀναβαίνειν in lines 15, 20 and divine ἐπιβαίνειν in line 11 may have been an intentional effect. θύετε πάν⟨τ⟩ες: πάν⟨τ⟩ες recalls ἅπας θῆλύς τε καὶ ἄρσην in line 1 of the opening address (also placed in the second hemistichium). When considering the rural location of the shrine and the local character of its cults it is tempting to smile at these assumptions regarding the volume of incoming visitors. Yet the votive deposits found in many nymphaea confirm that the rus-tic nature of these cultplaces did not preclude regular frequentation by city folk and that often such visits could take the form of group excursions (as with the famous sac-rificial expedition described in Menander’s Dyscolus; see Larson 2001, pp. 229–231). We shall also note that πάν⟨τ⟩ες is not meant to emphasize so much the quantity of pass-ing worshippers as the unrestricted character of the cult (a sense which I attempted to convey by the translation “let everyone be free to sacrifice”). Similarly the aforemen-tioned foundation inscription of Xenocrateia from New Phalerum grants freedom to sacrifice to everyone who wishes to do so, θύεν τῶι βουλομένωι ἐπὶ | τελεστῶν ἀγαθῶν (IG I3 987, lines 6–7; cf. p. 64 above). As Purvis notes, on occasion such encouragements to sacrifice also appear in state cult regulations (see, e.g., a fourth century BCE decree from Colophon concerning the building of walls, ἐπιτελῶγ γενομένων τῶν ἀγαθῶν πρόσοδον ποιήσεσθαι καὶ θυσίαν | καθότι ἂν τῶι δήμωι δόξηι, AJP 56, 1935, p. 362, col. I, line 20 ) “. . . but usually in addition to precise rules for sac-rifice” (2003, p. 17). Following Nock (1958, p. 418), Purvis dismisses the possibility that lines 20–21 of our inscription should be interpreted as a sacred ordinance in verse. Yet, even if we cannot call them a lex sacra in the strict sense of the word, it is highly likely that these lines were meant to pass on some form of instruction about the proper proce-dure to be used in the shrine. Rather than a random series of sacred acts, ἀναβαίνετ[ε], θύετε, εὔχεσθε, εὐφραίνεσθε appear to be steps in a structured ritual sequence. This sequence is shaped by religious custom as well as topog-raphy: prayers (εὔχεσθε) and feasting (εὐφραίνεσθε) are of the Karapla cult might have been larger than has been hitherto assumed. 19 Χίρων δ’ αὐτῶι δῶκε σοφόν τ’ ἔμεν[αι] καὶ ἀοιδόνLast in this catalog of divine ἀντιδόσεις, Chiron’s ‘educa-tion’ of Pantalces completes the founder’s heroic portrayal by implicitly assimilating him to the illustrious circle of the Centaur’s legendary tutees. Chiron was well-known in Greek myth for his mentorship of divine and semidi-vine youths, including two of his own cultmates on the Karapla hill, Heracles and Asclepius (in whose company he also appears in a bronze group of the 3rd century CE at the British Museum; BM 1242 = LIMC III, 1986, p. 246, no. 101, s.v. ‘Cheiron’). As Padgett notes, the musical teach-ings of Chiron reflect a distinctly elitist model which is in line with the already noted ἀγαθὸς ἀνήρ motif running through the poem: “Like the sons of the aristocracy, his pupils learned to play the lyre, and indeed, it has been noted that his ‘curriculum’, designed especially for mythic heroes, is more in harmony with the schools of the music teacher and the gymnasium instructor than with the teacher of letters” (2003, p. 20). On Chiron’s prerogative over the granting of σοφία, cf. IG II2, 4473, lines 11–12, τὸν δ’ ἀνὰ Πηλιάδας κορυφὰς ἐδίδαξε [τέ]χνη[ν τε καὶ σο]φίαν Κένταυρος (referring to the rearing of Asclepius). V Lines 20–22: Closing Address to VisitorsIn the closing verses the epigram resumes the direct address interrupted by the long narrative section on the santuary and the story of its foundation. Enriched with this knowledge readers are now encouraged to complete their visit by moving on to the upper level of the sanctuary, where they can sacrifice, pray, and enjoy themselves. Our ‘guided tour’ comes to an end as no further directions are necessary: once on the stairway, visitors will be directed in their next steps by the natural topography of the site. The epigram closes with a promise of peace and well-being for all those who enter the precinct. 20–21 ἀλλὰ τύχαις ἀγαθαῖς ἀναβαίνε[τε], θύετε πάν⟨τ⟩ες | εὔχεσθε, εὐφραίνεσθεἀλλὰ: the transition to the epigram’s close is marked by a stronger adversative than all other thematic shifts in the text. This second address to the readers is organized as a series of paratactically arranged imperatives extending from the second half of this line to the first half of the next. The imperatives are organized in pairs, each correspond-ing to a self-contained metrical unit (20 ἀναβαίνε[τε], θύετε πάν⟨τ⟩ες: |⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑⏑ ‒⏑, a paroemiac, and 21 εὔχεσθε, εὐφραίνεσθε: ‒‒ ‒‒ ‒⏑|, a hemiepes).

HG 4, 3, 7–8—an occur-rence which took place in the immediate neighborhood of our cave) as well as civic strife (the στάσις which lead to the ascent of Polydamas, X. HG 6, 1, 2; cf. Gehrke 1985, p. 126). Similarly, around the end of the same century, the unfavorable outcome of the Lamian war, marked by the defeat of Meno IV at the hand of Polyperchon in 321 BCE, ushered in for the Pharsalians a long period of economic and social decline that culminated with the population shortages of the late Hellenistic Period (Asheri 1966, pp. 30–31; Stamatopoulou 2007, pp. 225–226: see pp. 14–15 and note 108 above). As Borgeaud puts it, πολέμοιo τε νίκη could be understood in light of “the oppressive climate of domestic war that reigned at that time in Thessaly” (1995, p. 295). Nonetheless it would be imprudent to dis-miss entirely the possibility of a literal reading ‘victory in war’: military success had its own place among the desid-erata of ancient Greek life, see e.g. the other Attic scolion PMG 888, ἐνικήσαμεν ὡς ἐβουλόμεσθα | καὶ νίκην ἔδοσαν θεοὶ φέροντες | παρὰ Πανδρόσου †ὡς φίλην Ἀθηνᾶν†, and, for the conceptual framework, X. Hipparchicus 8, 7, καὶ μὴν τό γ’ ἐν πολέμῳ νικᾶν πολλῷ ἐνδοξότερον ἢ πυγμῇ· μετέχει μὲν γάρ τι καὶ ἡ πόλις ταύτης τῆς δόξης· ὡς δὲ τὰ πολλὰ ἐπὶ τῇ τοῦ πολέμου νίκῃ καὶ εὐδαιμονίᾳ οἱ θεοὶ τὰς πόλεις στεφανοῦσιν, ὥστ’ οὐκ οἶδ’ ἔγωγε τί προσήκει ἄλλ’ ἄττα μᾶλλον ἀσκεῖσθαι ἢ τὰ πολεμικά. Nor are the Karapla cave and its cults neces-sarily incompatible with military ideology, as mantained by Peek (1938, p. 25): indeed we shall note that at least two of the deities listed in our epigram have traditional asso-ciations with the world of war, namely Apollo and Pan. In agreement with the epic ‘color’ observed in the rest the poetry, the epigram ends with a Homeric genitive. Second declension genitives in -οιο also appear in regular Thessalian usage, see IG IX 2, p. 338 (Indices, X. Exempla Sermonis Thessalici). 2.5 Conclusions (Pantalces: Construction of a Cult Founder)Caves invite heroic activity.Boardman, The Archaeology of NostalgiaThere can be no doubt that one of the main reasons for the enduring interest of scholars in the Pharsalian cave is Pantalces himself, the ancient builder whose personality continues to exercise a fascination from behind rock-cut words on the Karapla hill. For in contrast to other known founders of local Nymph cults, such as Archedamus and Onesagoras, Pantalces’ epigraphic legacy is not limited to prosaic cult records but includes a poetic account, in traditional accompaniments to sacrifice (θύετε); here we found them adapted to the distinctive configuration of the Karapla site (ἀναβαίνετ[ε]), with each ‘step’ in the sequence corresponding to a transition in the shrine’s physical layout (ἀναβαίνετ[ε]: stairs; θύετε, εὔχεσθε: altar; εὐφραίνεσθε: terrace? See Chapter 2.2.4 above). Such ‘informal’ cultic prescriptions are not unknown to the epigrammatic genre, see e.g. a funerary inscription from Stratonicea, GVI 985, line 9, ὡς ἥ̣[ρῳ | π]έ̣λ̣[αν]ον̣ πυρ̣ί μο[ι θ]έτε καὶ σ[τε]-|[φ]ανοῦτε.21–22 κακῶν ἐπίλησις ἁπάν⟨των⟩ | ἐνθάδ’ ἔνεστ’, ἀγαθῶν δὲ [δόσις] πολέμοιo τε νίκηThe poem ends with one final catalogic structure listing the blessings that await visitors inside the precinct. First comes “forgetfullness of all evils”, a construct inspired by Hom. Od. 4, 221, κακῶν ἐπίληθον ἁπάντων; cf. Pi. P. 1, 46, εἰ γὰρ ὁ πᾶς χρόνος ὄλβον μὲν οὕτω καὶ κτεάνων δόσιν εὐθύνοι, καμάτων δ’ ἐπίλασιν παράσχοι. The second desideratum, ἀγαθῶν δὲ [4–5] must have been a symmetrical opposite of the first, e.g. ‘abundance of good things’ or some similar concept (cf. an Ἐπιτελεία τῶν ἀγάθων listed with Δίκα and Ὁμονοια among the city gods of Mytilene in a decree of the fourth century BCE, SEG 36, 750, lines 7–8). Giannopoulos restores [λάχ]ο[ς], ‘allotment’; I prefer to print [δόσις] on comparison with κτεάνων δόσιν in the Pindaric passage cited above, noting that this choice would be themati-cally more suited to the motif of divine ‘giving’ found in the central part of the poem (13 ἀντίδοσαν, 14 ἔδ⟨ω⟩κ’, 16 δίδωσι, 19 δῶκε). Not as transparent, instead (at least to a modern readership), is the continuity of thought between the first two items in the series and the last, “victory in war”, unless an alternative translation is adopted, per-haps “victory over war”, with πολέμοιo understood as an objective genitive: cf. “Besiegung des Krieges” Peek 1938 p. 25; “a halt to war” Borgeaud 1995, p. 295. Peace or relief from conflict appear alongside health and abundance as a common request in prayers, see e.g. the Attic scolion to Athena PMG 884 (Παλλὰς Τριτογένει’ ἄνασσ’ Ἀθηνᾶ, | ὄρθου τήνδε πόλιν τε καὶ πολίτας | ἄτερ ἀλγέων ⟦τε⟧ καὶ στάσεων | καὶ θανάτων ἀώρων, σύ τε καὶ πατήρ) and, for an epigraphical parallel, the lex sacra accompanying Isyllus’ paean to Asclepius, (ἁγνῶς πομπεύειν καὶ ἐπεύχεσθαι πολιάταις | πᾶσιν ἀεὶ διδόμεν τέκνοις τ’ ἐρατὰν ὑγίειαν, | τὰν καλοκαγαθίαν τ’ Ἐπιδαυροῖ ἀεὶ ῥέπεν ἀνδρῶν | εὐνομίαν τε καὶ εἰράναν καὶ πλοῦτον ἀμεμφῆ, | ὥραις ἐξ ὡρᾶν νόμον ἀεὶ τόνδε σέβοντας, IG IV2 1, 128, 21–25). As in these texts from Attica and the Argolid, the reference to peace in our epigram is likely to have been inspired by a period of uncertainty or crisis in local history. The early fourth century is known to have been a difficult time for Pharsalus, with years marred"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"85The Inscriptions: inscription iia simple but competent epigrammatic style, of the sanc-tuary, its gods, and Pantalces’ special relation to each of them.31 The advantage that this ‘portrait in verse’ has over the pictorial representations we possess of Archedamus and Onesagoras is the immediacy of the medium: unlike the mute portraits of the two other cave founders, marked in so many ways by the ‘otherness’ of a different time and culture,32 the hexameters of Inscription II speak to us in familiar tones, recreating the illusion of a live voice. But whose voice is that which we are enticed into hearing? A considerable number of scholars, stretching the lim-its of the palaeographical evidence, are eager to believe that the epigram was composed by Pantalces himself, some decades after he completed the work dedicated in Inscription I:He might have begun his work as a young man with the shorter inscription and composed the longer one as a valedictory, summarizing his achievements and making it clear that he expected the cave to be main-tained for posterity (Larson 2001, p. 18, after Peek 1938, p. 25).At the opposite end of this spectrum are others who even doubt the historical authenticity of the founder’s figure, suggesting that Pantalces, ‘The All-Powerful’ could be a figment of local lore inspired by the formidable rock- cuttings surviving at the site: [Pantalces’] very name, which expresses that insu-perable might that he takes after Heracles, gives the impression of having been deliberately invented for the purpose (Comparetti 1923–1924, p. 152).31 On the epigraphic record from the Vari cave: Schörner and Goette 2004, pp. 42–59 (inscriptions), 60–77 (inscribed reliefs), 95–100 (graffiti on ceramic). From the cave at Kafizin: Friis 1953; Mitford 1980; Masson 1981.32 Beginning with W. Gell in 1805 (Binyon 1900, p. 194, nos. 26, 37, 38), the rock-cut relief of Archedamus in a chiton with mason’s tools in hand has been reproduced in many drawings and photo-graphs. For a comprehensive pictorial survey on this unusual artifact see Schörner and Goette 2004, pp. 31–41, plates 10: 3–11: 1–2 and 22:1 (Gell, drawing), 23: 2 ( J. Jackson, drawing), 25: 1 (L. Ross, drawing), 27: 1 (H.G. Lolling, engraving), 28: 1 (E. Curtius and J.A. Kaupert, engraving). On the bearded visage—presum-ably a portrait of Onesagoras?—which appears on the pottery from Kafizin see Mitford 1980 pass. and the comments by Pache 2011, pp. 60–66.As Himmelman-Wildschütz was the first to point out,33 however, it is highly unlikely that inscriptions I and II could be the work of the same author—be he a true his-torical character or an ingenious counterfeiter. Rather, these texts seem to reflect two chronologically and quali-tatively different occasions in the cave’s history, i.e. the original landscaping of the sanctuary (by a Pantalces whose name, when considered per se, offers no reasons for suspicion)34 and the poetic celebration of this distant event by a later sanctuary patron. This interpretation is supported not only by the substantial differences in the lettering and spelling of the two inscriptions—far too extreme to be ascribed to the same engraver—but also the absence, in Inscription II, of any personal references or other information that would necessarily imply Pantalces’ authorship.35 Indeed, as we shall see in the next section, what has been interpreted as the autobiographic memoir of a rustic sanctuary founder at the end of his career is a literary fiction crafted at a time when all memory of the historical Pantalces had been lost. J.C. Decourt was the first to recognize a ‘heroic’ under-current in the depiction of Pantalces at lines 10–19 of Inscription II:We perceive . . . a barely sketched, very discrete attempt, first to elevate (ἀναβαίνειν) Pantalces to the level of human being par excellence, ἄνδρα ἀγαθόν, then to the rank of hero, equipped with all the moral and physical qualities, and protected by numerous divinities. A hero that does know toil (ἐξεπονήσατο), surely, yet one that definitely rises above the human measure.36Noting the absence of genealogical references—a fact which would prevent this text from qualifying as heroization 33 Himmelman-Wildschütz 1957a, p. 17. Other scholars who do not support the single author theory are the inscriptions’ latest edi-tor, J.C. Decourt (commentary to IThess I, 73, p. 91) and H.S. Versnel (2011, p. 120). C.O. Pache’s recent study on the poetics of nympholepsy is ambiguous on this topic, although a reference to Pantalces’ “self-presentation” (2011, p. 52) presupposes a view similar to Larson’s et al. 34 On the name Παντάλκης see commentary to Inscription I above, line 1.35 Citing Hdt. 1, 30; 32 as an example, Himmelman-Wildschütz questioned also the possibility that an individual would contra-dict all rules of religious piety by publically boasting about such god-granted privileges as those listed in lines 10–19 of Inscription II (1957a, p. 17, note 10).36 Decourt, commentary to IThess I, 73, p. 92."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"86chapter 4in a technical sense37—Decourt concludes however that Pantalces was never fully heroized at the cave. The found-er’s portrayal in Inscription II shows the traits of an ideal shepherd-philosopher, reminiscent of certain creations of later pastoral literature, but this idealization does not go beyond the human level (“he is never presented as a ‘hero’ in the strict sense of the word . . . and remains, therefore, a shepherd”, 1995 p. 93). Nor, according to Decourt, did the reputation of the cave and its cults ever extend beyond the nearby villages and the local shepherd population: for him, the epigram in Inscription II is ultimately the result of “a religion that is at once popular and relatively refined in its expression” (commentary to IThess I, 73, p. 94).Decourt’s penetrating reading of lines 9–10 is crucial to the understanding of this composition. His identification of the subtle heroic theme that underlies the literary por-trait of Pantalces—even in the absence of explicit, full-scale heroization and of any material evidence associated with hero cult—introduces a new angle from which to analyze this unusual poetry. However it is difficult to follow the French scholar in all of his conclusions. For example, we have no real reason to assume that Pantalces was a shep-herd, much less that his portrait in Inscription II reflects the values and beliefs of a pastoral community.38 It is true—as has been discussed in the previous chapters—that the socio-economic milieu of the cave was made up by cat-egories associated with the world of the oros (p. 32 above). These included on the other hand a fair representation of city-dwellers, commuters or people who ventured to the mountain for occasional errands, e.g. a hunting expedi-tion or a pilgrimage:39 such bourgeois interactions with the 37 Decourt commentary to IThess I, 73, p. 93. On genealogy in Greek culture and society see especially Thomas 1989, pp. 173–195. 38 In his aforementioned study of 1995, for example, P. Borgeaud calls the Karapla cult a “rural cult for the use of city-dwellers”. Borgeaud likewise identifies the passersby addressed by Inscription II as “the visiting city-dweller” (p. 295). The rural set-ting of most Nymph caves did not imply, necessarily, rural demo-graphics and economics. At the nymphaeum of Kafizin on Cyprus, the founder of the cult himself, Onesagoras, appears to have been a barber by profession (κουρεύς). The inscriptions found at this site (by Onesagoras and his business associates, a group of flax and linseed merchants referred to as the ‘company of Androclus’) reflect concerns which are unmistakebly bour-geois in nature. See Mitford 1980; Masson 1981; Pache 2004, pp. 55–70. Larson calls the Kafizin cave a “religious locus for commercial enterprise” 2001, p. 258.39 Cf. Larson 2001, pp. 226–231. Elsner and Rutherford 2005, pp. 18–19 also comment briefly on local pilgrimage to Nymph caves and oreibasia. A substantial number of graffiti related to ancient and modern pilgrim activities have survived at the cave of rural countryside are famously illustrated in Menandrean comedy.40 For all we know, Pantalces could have been a hunter who decided to honor the local Nymphs following a particularly meaningful encounter with the goddesses on the Karapla hill. Or a returning visitor from the surround-ing district, pilgrim or picnic goer, someone who knew and cherished the cave from its pre-architectural phase.41 Since the historical Pantalces who engraved Inscription I left no indication about his family, profession, or social status, it is impossible to know with certainty.42 Epigraphically, the omission of personal information in a dedicatory inscription is not unusual.43 More surprising is instead its absence in a document like Inscription II, where it would have been relevant to the aition of the cave and the commemoration of its founder. Himmelmann-Wildschütz, in his important study of 1957, surmised that Pantalces may have been a familiar enough figure, at the local level, to require no detailed referencing.44 The oppo-site is more likely to be true, namely that at the time of the epigram’s composition very little knowledge had sur-vived at the cave about its founder. In all probability, the author of Inscription II had to recreate Pantalces’ char-acter and the circumstances of the cave’s foundation on purely autoschediastic grounds, working from the scanty data in Inscription I and the visual evidence he had at hand. Following the lead of Inscription I, which alludes Melidoni (Tallaeum Antrum) in Crete; Tzifopoulos and Litinas 2009; Tzifopoulos 2011.40 Traditionally cited plays, in this regard, are the Dyscolus and Hero. The Dyscolus is our main literary source on the patronage of rural cults by city folk (and the excessive forms that such devotion could take: cf. Handley’s commentary to lines 262–263 and the relevant remarks by Elsner and Rutherford 2005, p. 18). Both plays offer examples of city-dwellers venturing to the coun-tryisde on hunting trips. Hero: p. 50, note 58. 41 Caves could be sought by city dwellers as an alternative setting for drinking parties in the heat of summer; for an example in the immediate neighborhood of Pharsalus see the story of Pulydamas at p. 91 below.42 Generally speaking, the use of poetic koinê rather than the local parlance (ἀνέθεκε for ὀνείθεκε, 2) does not seem to mesh well with the herdsman hypothesis. On the other hand, in the absence of adequate evidence on the literacy of the region, such arguments must be used with caution.43 Cf. e.g. another rock-cut dedication at the west end of Pharsalus (from the hilltop precinct of Zeus Thaulios, no longer visible today; cf. p. 16 above and note 76 below), Δὶ Θαυλίωι |ἀνχιστῶν οἱ περὶ Παρ-|μένισκον (IThess.

O. 3, lines 13–18):. . . ἐλαίας, τάν ποτε Ἴστρου ἀπὸ σκιαρᾶν παγᾶν ἔνεικεν Ἀμφιτρυωνιάδας, μνᾶμα τῶν Οὐλυμπίᾳ κάλλιστον <ἀέ>θλων, δᾶμον Ὑπερβορέων πείσαις Ἀπόλ- λωνος θεράποντα λόγῳ· πιστὰ φρονέων Διὸς αἴτει πανδόκῳἄλσει σκιαρόν τε φύτευμαξυνὸν ἀνθρώποις στέφανόν τ’ ἀρετᾶν.. . . the olive which once the son of Amphitryon brought from the shady springs of the Danube to be the most beautiful memorial of the Olympian con-tests, when he had persuaded the Hyperborean peo-ple, the servants of Apollo, with speech. With trustworthy intentions he was entreating them for a shady plant, to be shared by all men and to be a gar-land of excellence in the grove of Zeus which is hos-pitable to all (transl. Svarlien).In the rest of the epigram, which never rises again to the quality of line 15 but is rather formulaic in both style and content, a number of epicisms and Homerisms woven into the poetry give further epic flavor to Pantalces’ tale. The anonymous poet would have been predisposed to this epic interpretation of local history by the cultural context in which he was raised. The belief in their city’s heroic roots—through its identification with Phthia and the kingdom of Achilles—provided Pharsalian artists and craftsmen with a special propensity for looking at the past through the lens of epic. Evidence for this epicizing trend can be found, from the Early Iron Age onwards, in many areas of Pharsalian material culture. Famous vases discovered locally, such as the Sophilus dinos or the calyx crater in the manner of Exekias,47 confirm the local elite’s 47 Both vessels represent scenes from the aftermath of Patroclus’ death at Troy. The well-known dinos by Sophilus from Ktouri (Athens, National Museum 15499: Beazley ABV pp. 39–40, no. 16; Paral. 18) depicts the hero’s funeral games; the calyx crater from to the dedication of architectural work (ἔργον) and a live plant (δάφ[ναν]), the anonymous composer chose to rep-resent the foundation of the sanctuary as the result of two landscaping acts—the building of a stairway (τούσδε λίθους τύπτων ἐπόησ’ ἀναβαίνειν) and the planting of a gar-den (ταῦτ’ ἐφύτευσε καὶ ἐξεπονήσατο χερσσίν). We can be almost certain that these were also the most prominent features of the sanctuary in his time: still today, the small elm grove at the base of the cliff and the powerful rock-cut steps leading up to the cave are the two visually out-standing elements in an otherwise unchanging scenery of scrub and naked rock. From such a felicitous marriage of epigraphy and landscape the ‘construction’ of Pantalces was born. Epigraphy contributed to this creation beyond the mere transmission of information: we can expect that a name like ΠΑΝΤΑΛΚΕΣ (‘The All-Powerful’), carved in an old fashioned letterstyle above the massive steps of the stairway, made quite an impression on the ancient com-poser, as it doubtlessly did on most contemporary cave patrons, conjuring up images of a bygone epic might.45 It is this kind of highly evocative context that provided the inspiration for a line like τούσδε λίθους τύπτων ἐπόησ’ ἀναβαίνειν he pounded these rocks and turned them into a way up.To the Greek mythopoeic mind, carving shrines out of rocky wastes and bringing them to life with trees was often the work of gods and heroes. Pantalces’ foundation on the stony side of the Karapla could thus be perceived as a distant mirror of similar superhuman efforts, such as Apollo’s foundation of the Ptoan oracle (also a cave?46 Pi. fr. 91 a Snell-Maehler):προ[.]ινηθεὶς ἐπῇενγᾶν τε καὶ <– –> θάλασσαν 45 In Pache’s words, “Space . . . becomes the repository of memories and stories, and the initial encounter [sc. between nymphs and cave founder] lives on in the imagination of the visitors to the site” (2011, p. 38). 46 The precinct of Apollo on Mt. Ptoum included an artificial cave (μυχός?) found during the excavations of the École Française at the site, see Guillon 1953, pp. 96, 137, 140–141, plate xiv; Ustinova 2009, pp. 113–116; Friese 2013, p. 231. In another fragment Pindar refers again to the Ptoan sanctuary as κευθμών, ‘recess’: καί ποτε τὸν τρικάρανον | Πτωΐου κευθμῶνα κατέσχεθε κοῦ[ρος] (91 b Snell-Maehler; on the interpretation of this text see Guillon 1953; Wagman 1986; Olivieri 2004)."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"88chapter 410–13; 44–49: especially worth-noting are the ‘catalog’,51 performed in both the ‘old fashioned’ and ‘modern’ styles, and the ‘epic encomium’):οἱ νενεικηκότες | ταυροθηρίᾳ· Μᾶρκος Ἀρρό<ν>τιος. | καταλογ[ῇ π]αλαιᾷ· Φίλων Φίλωνος | ὁ νεώτερος.

In the epic encomium: Amometus son of Philoxenides. In the modern catalog: Philon son of Philon, the Younger. In the epigram: Amo metus son of Philoxenides.In light of these considerations it is not surprising that our poet, when called to recreate a distant event of regional history such as the foundation of the Karapla sanctuary, would frame his tale in epic terms, particularly since the physical evidence at hand—a set of massive rock-carvings bearing the signature ‘Pantalces’ in early lettering—did so conveniently lend itself to a heroizing interpretation. If these clues hewn into the local rock provided the ini-tial inspiration for Pantalces’ portrait, the remainder of his personality was modeled on conventional motifs bor-rowed from encomiastic and funerary poetry. For another important factor in determining the register of the poetry, was the fact that the cave founder had been dead at the time of the composition:52 even more so than a ἥρως 51 A poetic form associated, like the encomium, with funerary or memorial functions (Hsch. s.v. καταλέγεσθαι· ὀδύρεσθαι τὸν τεθνεῶτα, but apparently without musical accompaniment, ibid. s.v. καταλογή· τὸ τὰ ᾄσματα μὴ ὑπὸ μέλει λέγειν). The ’old-fash-ioned catalog’, καταλογὴ παλαιά, appears in two other similar inscriptions from Larissa, SEG 53, 550, lines 14–15 (honoring the dead at the ‘battle of the gorge’), and IG IX 2, 532, lines 11–12 (honoring the dead in an unidentified military engagement). On the distinction between ‘old-fashioned’ and ‘modern’ catalogs see Bouvier 1975, p. 259; Petrovic 2009, pp. 208–209. On the cata-logic elements in our epigram, see commentary at pp. 72–73; 180 above.52 For Peek the language and content of lines 10–19 of the epigram argue for Pantalces still being alive at the time of the composi-tion (1938, p. 25). Expressions such as ἤματα πάντα (13), αἰῶν’ εἰς τὸν ἅπαντα (17), and the like, simply indicate a continuing situa-taste for artwork with Homeric themes. The anachronis-tic use of Mycenean tomb designs in Pharsalian funerary architecture of the sixth / fifth centuries BCE is especially revealing about the desire of such elites to connect with the epic past.48 It seems reasonable to assume that this trend permeated local poetry as much as it did archi-tecture or the other crafts. Not much is known about Thessalian poets and their work,49 but a first century BCE inscription from Larissa, concerning memorial games for the dead in an unspecified military operation,50 appears to confirm a fondness for epic forms (IG IX 2, 531, lines the so-called Verdelis Tomb in Pharsalus’ west cemetery (Athens, National Museum inv. 26746: Beazley ABV p. 148, no. 9) is a close replica of an Exekias original at the Agora Museum showing the fight for Patroclus’ arms (AP 1044: Hesperia 6, 1937, pp. 469–486).

Ειδικές παραγγελίες και τοπική αριστοκρατία”, and, for a summary of the conference: Stamatopoulou 2011, p. 79.48 “A notable and recurrent feature of Thessalian elites is their deliberate wish to associate with the past by choosing to build tholos tombs similar in appearance to those of Late Helladic III C, and often in close proximity to them” Stamatopoulou 2007a, p. 316; see also a discussion of the evidence at pp. 328–330. The best known example of this trend in Pharsalian funerary archi-tecture is the so-called Verdelis Tomb in the city’s west cemetery, a late sixth / early fifth century replica of a Mycenaean tholos tomb built over an earlier burial of the Late Helladic II B. Excavated by N. Verdelis in the early 1950’s (PAAH 1951, pp. 157–163; 1952, pp. 185–195; 1953, pp. 127–132; 1954, pp. 153–155), today this remarkable monument is believed by many to have been a heroum (Stamatopoulou 2011, p. 79). The discovery, in the tomb’s dromos, of the aforementioned vase depicting the fight over the body of Patroclus (note 47 above) has even prompted some scholars to suggest that the site may have housed a cult of Achilles (e.g. Marzolff 1994, p. 267; contra Mili 2015, p. 176, note 177). 49 For a survey of the epigraphic evidence see Bouvier 1975.

Among the living I had quite a wonderful time, lots of fun, and Dionysus was always my friend . . . the fruit that feeds men well . . . But after forty-seven years of good life I, Aphrodisius, lie now with the dead.Valor and sympotic congeniality are twin aspects of the heroic persona amply documented in funerary iconography.55 It is no accident that Pantalces’ portrayal begins with a reference to his strength and ends with ref-erences to his abilities as a banqueteer and a musician (or rather a bard, ἀοιδός, in accordance with the epic flavor of the poetry). Beyond the two examples discussed above, endless par-allels could be cited for the qualities that Pantalces shares with the epigraphical dead. His ‘special’ relationship to the deities of the cave is no less conventional than the other themes. Just as each of Pantalces’ moral and physical pre-rogatives is traced to the tutelage of a corresponding deity, so the warrior Archus and the reveller Aphrodisius are depicted respectively as protégés of Ares and Dionysus. Where the composer of our epigram shows his original-ity is in the ability to adapt such broad rhetorical themes to local reality. The deities listed in Inscription II may or may not have been all recipients of actual worship at the cave, but they doubtlessly belong to the religious world of Thessaly.56 Most importantly, the main quality which Pantalces’, and the majority of such encomia, are predi-cated upon—nobleness, a condicio sine qua non for heroic commemoration—is traced in this case to the founder’s interaction with the spirits of the place. In an interesting variant of the traditional motif, it is the Karapla Nymphs who ‘make’ Pantalces an ἀγαθὸς ἀνήρ. The transforma-tive power of contact with these goddesses is a common theme of many folktales in both ancient and modern 55 An apt example of the relevance of the banquet in funerary and heroic iconography is the type of sculptural votive known as Totenmahl reliefs; see Rouse 1902, pp. 20–23 and the wide-rang-ing studies by Thönges-Stringaris 1965 and Dentzer 1982.

Nor is the treacherous enemy celebrated by a poet’s lips: you are. For Ares of the beautiful horses is fond of you,while in another epitaph from the Athenian Agora, wine-loving Aphrodisius fondly reminesces about the εὐφροσύνη of his former dolce vita, βίος ἡδύς (IG II2, 13151 = GVI 1301, lines 1–7):[βαιὸν ἐ]π̣ ι ̣στήσας στήλῃ κανθόν, παροδε[ίτα τῇ]-[δε ἐν τ]ῷ τύμβῳ γνώρισον ὅσσα λέγω· ἦ ν[ύ ποτε][ἐν ζ]ωοῖσιν ἐγὼ βίον ἡδὺν ἄθρησα πάση[ς γ’ εὐ]-tion in life without any implications as to the relative time of the narrative (i.e. without qualifying the situtation as ‘current’ or ‘past’). One could argue indeed that only the dead are in a posi-tion to speak of life ‘as a whole’, since they can look at it objec-tively from the ‘outside’. References to a former life of continuous, unbroken well-being are far from unusual in the narratives of the deceased; see e.g. the epitaph of Aphrodisius cited below, [ἐν ζ]ωοῖσιν ἐγὼ βίον ἡδὺν ἄθρησα πάση[ς γ’ εὐ]-|[φρ]οσύνης ἐντὸς ἐὼν γ[λυκ]ε̣ί̣[ης (IG II2, 13151 = GVI 1301).53 Cf. the use of ἥρως as ‘deceased’ in Thessalian epitaphs of Hellenistic and Roman times, especially in the formula ἥρως (χρηστὲ) χαῖρε; for two examples from the area of Pharsalus and vicinities, see IThess I, 104 and 107. Discussion in Lattimore 1942, pp. 97–99. I am indebted to Laurent Darmezin and the other participants of a seminar I gave in Lyon in 2005 for a helpful dis-cussion of the funerary aspects in this poetry. 54 Stressing the rhetorical nature of such motifs is not to deny the value of epitaphs as biographical documents; see Bodel’s lucid discussion on the topic in 2001, pp. 30–41. On the other hand, as the same author repeatedly warns, “epitaphs attest commemo-rative habits rather than demographic realities” (ibid. p. 36)."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"90chapter 4one.59 Physical prowess and proper sympotic etiquette are traits more plausibly associated with the culture of urban elites than the pastoral world. The composer of our epi-gram crafted a character consistent with contemporary Pharsalian views about the city’s past, which, shared as they may have been by different strata of the local popu-lation, had their original roots in aristocratic ideology.60 The perception of Pantalces as a happy rustic is a modern construct, not an ancient one.61As to the circumstances which prompted the engraving of the epigram in Inscription II, the following possibilities might be considered. The composition could be the effort of a competent amateur, a private dedication much like Pantalces’ own. Or it could be the work of a professional hired specifically for the purpose, in connection with a special occasion at the sanctuary. The second hypothesis, although supported by the use of the heading θεός (con-sidered unusual for a private dedication, cf. commentary to line 1 above), seems unlikely on grounds of style; see below, p. 93. In either case the object of such an engraving was to provide the sanctuary with an ‘official past’ for visi-tors to refer to. The need for this kind of testimony could be taken as indirect proof for the relevance of the sanctu-ary in local cult. As we have seen, proximity to the city and visibility from two important communication routes extended the patronage of the Karapla cave beyond the local shepherd population. If it is sufficiently clear that Inscription II reflects an effort to restore the sanctuary’s memory, what remains to be established is who might have been responsible for a cultural operation of this sort, either by composing and engraving the epigram himself or hiring professionals to perform these tasks. Was it an especially devout patron? An individual or a group of peo-ple in charge of the cave’s upkeeping?62 The lack of offi-cial records weighs against the possibility that the Karapla 59 Contrast e.g. the epigraphic materials on shepherds and their world assembled and discussed by Robert 1949, especially pp. 152–160 (Hellenica VII, ‘Épitaphe d’un berger à Thasos). 60 The particular epigrammatic form chosen—the so-called epi-gramma longum—may also be suggestive of upper class models. On long epitaphs as “factor of social distinction”, see the discus-sion by Garulli 2008, pp. 626–632.61 On the perception of the ἄγροικος in Greek culture see the afore-mentioned studies by Borgeaud 1995, Konstantakos 2005, and Cullyer 2006.62 Cf. the tradesmen that held meetings at the aforementioned nymphaeum of Kafizin in Cyprus, note 38 above. At Pharsalus we have evidence for a neighborhood association by the name of Ἀγυιᾶται (IThess I, 74–75; Mili 2015, p. 133 and appendix 3, p. 351.) and a kinship group known as Ἄγχιστοι (IThess I, 62; Mili 2015, pp. 90–91: cf. note 43 above). Greek culture.57 Using Inscription I as a basis for devel-oping a similar narrative about Pantalces and the local Nymphs, our poet was able to craft, simultaneously, both an aetiology for the sanctuary and a noble status for its founder.58 Mutually explanatory, the two accounts—that of the κτίσις and that of the ἥρως—were woven together into a tale effectively integrated into the physical land-scape of the sanctuary. After reading Inscription II, pil-grims could turn to Inscription I to catch a closer glimpse of the founding hero commemorated in the epigram. We can imagine that they approached these ancient carvings with reverence, as they ascended the stairs to the cave, but is probable that, just like us, they would only be able to decipher them partly (see section 4.1.5 above). Disappointing as it is to renounce a biographical read-ing of Inscription II, we must conclude that this docu-ment, albeit longer and seemingly richer in detail, sheds no more light on the historical Pantalces than does Inscription I. It does present us, on the other hand, with an interesting study in reception, showing how Pharsalians would reflect upon and construct their past. If the founder of the Karapla cave had indeed been a shepherd, as some scholars suggest, he was certainly not memorialized as 57 For a broad overview of the material ancient and modern see Larson 2001, pp. 61–90. On the transformative power of Nymph encounters see Pache 2011.58 It should be remembered that Nymphs are closely associated with both foundation myths and heroic genealogy (see e.g. the examples discussed in Larson 2001). Although not properly the son of a Nymph, according to our epigram Pantalces was none-theless enpowered by the goddesses with the same founding prerogatives as a Nymph-born hero. In this sense the narrative of Pantalces’ investiture by the Nymphs is essential in framing the larger narrative of the cave’s foundation within the local heroic tradition. The epigrammatic form and the epigraphic medium contributed in no small measure to a reception of Pantalces in heroic terms; mutatis mutandis, we could apply to our text what Day writes of funerary epigrams, “Metrical epitaphs and funer-ary iconography offered . . . a kind of substitute funeral. Viewers and readers ‘in the know’ would recognize that a deceased war-rior, for example, was being represented as the ἀνὴρ ἀγαθός into whom the rites of a grand funeral would have transformed him” (Day 1994, pp. 70–71). The nexus between cult places like the Karapla cave and their foundation stories is appropriately described by Pache: “There is also a deep connection between stories and space, and remembering can itself be a matter of both time and space . . . encounters with the supernatural in the form of female deities lead to the creation of sacred space, which becomes, in turn the focal point of a cult that aims at remembering and reenacting the extraordinary moment that led to its creation” (2011, pp. 9–10)."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"91The Inscriptions: inscription iithe famed pancratiast Pulydamas of Scotussa, indeed shows that it was not unusual for local aristocrats to hold their revels in caves, especially in the heat of summer (6, 5, 8–6, 6, 1):ἐς σπήλαιον γὰρ οἵ τε ἄλλοι τῶν συμποτῶν καὶ ὁ Πουλυδάμας ἐσῆλθεν ὥρᾳ θέρους, καί πως οὐ κατά τινα ἀγαθὸν δαίμονα ἡ κορυφὴ τηνικαῦτα τοῦ σπηλαίου κατερρήγνυτο, καὶ δῆλα ἦν ὡς αὐτίκα ἐμπεσεῖσθαι καὶ χρόνον οὐκ ἐπὶ πολὺν ἔμελλεν ἀνθέξειν· γενομένης δὲ αἰσθήσεως τοῦ ἐπιόντος κακοῦ καὶ τρεπομένων ἐς φυγὴν τῶν λοιπῶν παρέστη καταμεῖναι τῷ Πουλυδάμαντι, καὶ ἀνέσχε τὰς χεῖρας ὡς ἐπιπίπτοντι ἀνθέξων τῷ σπηλαίῳ καὶ οὐ βιασθησόμενος ὑπὸ τοῦ ὄρους. τούτῳ μὲν ἐνταῦθα ἐγένετο ἡ τελευτή.It was summertime and Pulydamas and his drinking companions went to a cave. Luck was not on their side: somehow the cave’s roof began to crack and it became clear that it would collapse quickly and could not hold out much longer. As soon as they became aware of the impending disaster, the others turned and ran away. Pulydamas instead decided to stay, holding up his hands in the belief that he could contain the cave’s collapse and would not be crushed under the mountain. It was thus that he met his end there.66If Pantalces’ character in Inscription II is an embodiment of the ideals and practices of such a group, the praise of his musical skill could also be self-referential, suggesting that one of the members was responsible for the composi-tion of the epigram.67 On the other hand if a company like 66 Cf. D.S. 9, 14–15. Pulydamas’ failure to prevent the cave’s collapse with his strength offers an interesting contrast with Pantalces’ effective use of the same power in building up the Karapla cave. On the extensive lore about Pulydamas see Paus. 6, 5, 4–7. As in Pantalces’ case, Pulydamas’ deeds were collected in an inscrip-tion which the periegete might have used for his account.

The corpus of the Attic scolia mentioned above (PMG 884–917) is adequate evi-dence for the level of poetic competence shown by the cultured participants of ancient banquets. Whcile Athenians may have been no match for the Thessalians, when it came to intellectual and artististic refinement, it would seem that the affluent youth of Thessalian cities had just as much access to a good literary education as any of their Attic counterparts (an apt example being that of Meno (III) of Pharsalus, the title character of the well-known Platonic dialogue, who disported himself with such personalities as Gorgias and Socrates, Pl. Men. 70b et pass. On the presumed Thessalian indifference for matters of the mind, shrine was supported at any time by the state; rather, it appears that the cult retained its original private char-acter throughout its history.63 This is not to say that the cave was not patronized by a broad community of wor-shippers, including urban folk of both status and means. Contrary to the hasty pronouncements of earlier scholar-ship, some of the votives found during Levi’s excavations at the site are of a quality that seems to imply a reasonably upscale patronage (Chapter 3.5 above). Even more to the point, as we have seen, the commemoration of Pantalces in Inscription II reveals a number of motifs consistent with the ideology and aesthetics of the local upper classes and their entourage. It is thus possible, for example, that a society of sacred banqueteers such as the ἕταιροι from the nymphaeum of Nea Heracleitsa in Macedonia64 met also on the Karapla hill—a hypothesis which would further explain the sympotic references in our epigram as well as the presence of Dionysiac elements in the sanctuary’s votive art.65 A tale related by Pausanias about another heroized Thessalian and close neighbor of Pantalces, 63 On the legal and financial implications of privately founding and managing a cult, see e.g. Purvis 2003, pp. 10–13 (cf. 31 on the specific topic of cave shrines).64 Bakalakis 1938, pp. 81–97: an annotated text of the relevant inscription (SEG 18, 278) is given at pp. 94–96, fig. 14, [ἀπ’ Αὐλ[ῶνος] | συνπόται | εὐξάμ̣[ε]ν̣οι ̣ | πελαν̣[οῦ] | μνημε̑ον | ἔθηκα (on the vowing of the sacrificial cake called πέλανος, see Jameson 1956; on the use of foodstuffs in Nymph worship, p. 29 above). A similar (or perhaps the same) company of Nymph worshippers, referring to themselves as the ἕταιροι, appears on another inscription from this site, Bakalakis 1938, pp. 90–94, figs. 12–13; see the brief overviews by Larson 2001, p. 239 and Sporn 2013, p. 209. To be sure, the fact that Inscription II reveals elements of an aristocratic worldview does not necessarily mean that it was dedicated by a member of the aristocracy. We can expect that the members of the knightly, hoplitic, and even Penestic, classes who so often accompanied the Pharsalian gentry on the battle-field or at the dinner table, shared some of the same cultural codes. On the interesting overlap between upper class and lower class roles that is sometimes encountered in Thessalian society, see e.g. Mili 2015, pp. 58–59, 265–266.65 Meshed with the funerary motifs discussed above we also find, in Inscription II, a variety of moral, aesthetical, and political themes commonly encountered in convivial poetry. Besides the already noted reference to laughter and self-control, placed under Pan’s purview as in PMG 887, there are striking correspon-dences on subjects like health (ὑγιαίνειν μὲν ἄριστον ἀνδρὶ θνητῶι, PMG 890, 1), wealth (τὸ . . . πλουτεῖν ἀδόλως, PMG 890, 3), political strife (ὄρθου τήνδε πόλιν τε καὶ πολίτας | ἄτερ ἀλγέων ⟦τε⟧ καὶ στάσεων, PMG 884, 3–4) and victory in conflict (ἐνικήσαμεν ὡς ἐβουλόμεσθα | καὶ νίκην ἔδοσαν θεοὶ φέροντες, PMG 888, 1–2).

By Astioun. As I have pointed out elsewhere, this poetry shows remarkable analogies with our text.73 Like the Karapla epigram it celebrates in epigrammatic style the building of a shrine to the local Nymphs. On the other hand, since the builder of this establishment is very much alive at the time of the dedication (indeed he has just recovered from a bad illness) here the encomiastic element is dra-matically reduced to the advantage of the ecphrastic one: the praise of the foundation—and of its natural setting—clearly prevail over the praise of the founder. Another significant difference is that in this case the author of the poetry has made sure to sign his work, identifying himself as Astioun son of Soos. Known also for another inscrip-tion to the Nymphs and Dionysus (SEG 45, 554), the son of Soos appears to have had a personal involvement in Nymph worship.Could it be that a local poet like Astioun, a Pharsalian with an equally strong devotion to the Nymphs, composed (and perhaps inscribed, of his own initiative) the epigram 73 Wagman 2011. Thematic and linguistical affinities between the Atrax and Karapla epigrams: 1 τόδε δῶμ]α (cf. 6 [δ]ῶ̣[μά]): 8 τ[ὸ δ]ῶ[μα], 1 ἐπόνη̣ [σεν]: 12 [ἐ]ξεπονήσατο, 2 σὺν πολλ]οῖς θύμασιν ἀνθέματα: 8–9 ἱαρωτά . . . δῶρά τε πολλ[ά], 4 [ἧι ποσὶ δινοῦντ]α̣ι Να̣ΐδε̣ς̣ ἁβρόπεπλοι: 10–11 Νύμφαι | τῶνδ’ ἐπιβαινέμεναι χώρων, 5 ἀγλαοε̣[ι]δ̣έ̣α̣ χῶρον: 5 χῶρον δ’ εἰς ἱερὸν, 6 ἵδ̣ρ̣[υ]σ[ε π]έ̣τ̣ρ̣οις: 15 τούσδε λίθους τύπτων ἐπόησ’.the Nea Heracleitsa banqueteers had held regular meet-ings at the Karapla cave, one would expect to encounter a tangible trace of their activities on the site, particularly in terms of tableware or cooking utensils.68 An intriguing reference to ‘various fragments’ from drinking cups and large Attic amphoras is found indeed in Levi’s report of 1923–1924;69 regrettably, this material is no longer avail-able for closer study. When we consider the hypothesis of a professional poet, we have at our disposal a more extensive body of evi-dence. Despite all the ink that has been poured to under-score the personal and unique character of the poetry in Inscription II, this composition in fact seems to be rooted in an established local tradition. Revealing on this point is the aforementioned existence at Larissa of poetic com-petitions in the ‘epic encomium’ and the ‘epigram’, i.e. the two literary styles reflected in the Karapla epigram (IG IX, 2, 531, lines 44–45, 48).70 Equally instructive is the fact that in this inscription the same poet is listed as winning both specialties: Amometus son of Philoxenides could be used as an example of the kind of specialist that would have been hired to commemorate the founding of the Karapla sanctuary and immortalize the personality of its founder in a style consistent with the heroic past of Pharsalus. The involvement of such professionals in cult-related events is not unknown to the religious reality of the region: we could compare the Karapla poem with a very similar com-position from the nearby city of Atrax,71 where the estab-lishment of a sacred structure for the Nymphs (δῶμα)72 is also commemorated: see e.g. Richter 2011, p. 24; Mili 2015, p. 262; on the interest of 4th century Thessalian elites for rhetoric and philosophy: Sprawski 2005, pp. 45–46). 68 Good times—εὐφροσύνη—usually leave a material trail: on the evidence from Nea Heracleitsa see Bakalakis 1938, pp. 88–91, figs. 8–11. 69 “Nor there was lack of fragmentary cups and even large Attic amphoras, coated with a shiny black finish, and sometimes with traces of painting” (1923–1924, p. 32; cf. Chapter 3.3 above, Cat. no. 60). Remains from this black-coated ware can still be spotted in the terrace below the cave (Cat. no. 76, fig. 68).70 On ἐγκώμιον and ἐπίγραμμα in IG IX 2, 531 see the aforemen-tioned study by Petrovic 2009, who underlines the “commemo-rative character of these genres” (p. 208).71 Peek 1974, pp. 19–25, plate 1: 1.

The Karapla epigram is an example of how such a memo-rial was created, and how the story of a small country shrine and its founder became part of the greater epic tale of the city of Pharsalus.76 Open air rock-cut shrines are found at both the east and west end of Pharsalus, in the Varoussi and Agia Paraskevi neighbor-hoods (Varoussi: p. 76 above; see also an unpublished precinct on the small hill of Agios Athanasios, Wagman and Nichols 2012. Agia Paraskevi: p. 16, note 123 above). At least one more sacred cave is known within the Pharsalian territory (reported by Arvanitopoulos below the acropolis walls in the northeast cliff of Prophitis Ilias; now lost? 1929, p. 226). Large amounts of sherds near another such grotto on the Plaka ridge—opposite the Karapla across the Steni pass (p. 5 above)—suggest that a religious cult may also have been housed in this location. A brief study of this site, hitherto unpublished, is in preparation by the author and A.G. Nichols. 77 As Pache notes, “what begins as a personal relationship between the nymphs and Pantalkes becomes a community ritual as pil-grims continue to commemorate both nymphs and nympho-lepts . . . The nympholepts project their encounter with the divine through the creation of artifacts (cave, sculptures, vases, inscriptions) that become the focus of attention for other visi-tors to the caves and help transform the original nympholept into a figure of cult”, 2011, pp. 69–70. On privately founded Nymph caves standing at the intersection between space and memory cf. ibid. pp. 101–111. at the Karapla sanctuary?74 The use of the word ἀοιδός—slightly incongruous, even in a composition so deliber-ately epicizing as ours—may then be taken as a disguised reference to the profession of the author. Regrettably, unlike for the Atrax epigram, we do not have in this case a signature that would confirm such a possibility. Based on style alone the hypothesis that a professional epigramma-tist may be behind the poetry from the Karapla hill seems, at least on surface, a tenuous one. Even a cursory com-parison with the Atrax epigram or other verse inscriptions signed by professionals75 brings into focus the disparities—especially in vocabulary and diction—which separate our poem from such compositions. On the other hand, as observed at the beginning of this section (pp. 69–70), the nameless author of Inscription II displays a metrical skill and an overall ‘souplesse’ that place his work well above the amateurish poetry generally found at similar sites. To conclude: even if it bears no real association to the historical Pantalces and cannot be used to illuminate the mysterious personality behind Inscription I, the epigram in Inscription II still constitutes an important testimony on the commemorative practices that were in use in cen-tral Thessaly for small sacred foundations like the Karapla cave or the Atrax δῶμα. Hewn into the rock of the local 74 Just as they hired the work of fine Attic potters (note 47 above), Thessalian notables were known as patrons of the poetic arts. On the commission of epigrams in particular cf. the two short dedications composed by Anacreon for Echecratidas and his family, AP 6, 136; 142 (FGE, ‘Anacreon’ VII, pp. 138–139; XIII, p. 142). On these compositions and the topic of Thessalian poetic patronage in general see Stamatopoulou 2007a, pp. 327–328 with the relevant bibliography. 75 For a collection of inscriptional epigrams bearing the author’s signature see the study by Santin 2009.

In this com-posite landscape of massive mountain ranges and spread-ing river plains the cult of the Nymphs found a congenial home, continuing the nature cults of Thessaly’s great Stone Age civilizations into historical times. Yet, if almost every corner of ancient Thessaly is linked, in legend, to a particular Nymph or group of Nymphs, the material trail left in the region by these goddesses is much scarcer than what mythology would lead us to expect.1 Nymphs do not appear much in Thessalian inscriptions; except for coins, which corroborate the testimonial of myth, their pres-ence in the local archaeological record is just as minimal. Despite the wealth of cave formations in the area, only a few have been identified to this day as Nymph shrines.2 In this shortage of evidence the Karapla cave site constitutes a crucial resource for the study of Thessalian religion and our knowledge of the area in general.Located at the southwest edge of the Pharsalian terri-tory, on one of the rocky elevations which form a natu-ral boundary with the neighboring state of Proerna, the Karapla cave belonged to that type of topographic and socioeconomic terrain which Greeks referred to as ‘outer margins’ or eschatiai.31 For a comprehensive discussion of Thessalian Nymph lore see Larson 2001, pp. 163–168; for summaries of the archaeological evi-dence, ibid. pp. 238–239; Heinz 1998, p. 77. Inscriptions: Mili 2015, p. 22, table 1.3, and appendix 1, nos. 244, 353–362. Coins: Moustaka 1983, pp. 47–52; 120–127; Mili 2015, pp. 42–43; 291, note 173.2 Currently the only other cave site in Thessaly which can be safely associated with Nymph worship is Zar Trypa on Mt. Ossa (Wace and Thompson 1908: p. 32 note 119 and p. 74 above). The still unex-plored ‘Chironion’ on Mt. Pelium (Arvanitopoulos 1911: p. 28, note 86 above) may also have housed a cult of the goddesses. All remaining Thessalian cave shrines are either dedicated to other deities (cave of Zeus Meilichius at Goritsa: Te Riele 1972) or cannot be assigned with certainty (Pharsalus, Prophitis Ilias: Arvanitopoulos 1929, see note 76 above. Pharsalus, Plaka ridge: p. 93 note 76 above. Krounia: Agouridis et al. 2006, see p. 27 note 75 above. Scopelus, Panormos: Sampson 2000. For a current assessment of the evidence: Mili 2015, pp. 41–42.3 We may compare the cave’s position on the geographical and reli-gious map of Pharsalus with that of the later xoklisia, or outlying churches, still in use in the Orthodox world. Not surprisingly, quite a few of these establishments are housed within caves. For a modern archaeological perspective on xoklisia and the ‘location grammars’ which govern their placement in space see the stimulating study by Nixon 2006. On the use of caves as church sites see e.g. the examples collected in Crete by Faure 1979; see also the general overview by Skouras 1985.This rugged borderland of phrygana-mantled lime-stones was no more inhabited in antiquity than it is now. Except for the faraway sounds of grazing herds and the occasional sighting of a peasant looking for kindling or wild salad grasses, the only presences in the area were the Nymphs associated with the nurturing waters of the Narthacium aquifer. Today a memory of these natural forces survives in the toponymy of the region, in designa-tions such as Neraida or Neraiditis. The centrality of the aquifer in local culture is also evident in the names of countless villages and small towns, which often point to the existence of a fountain or a spring.4In the late Archaic Age an organized cult of the Nymphs appears to have developed around the spring in the Karapla cave. During the first half of the fifth century the site was enriched with a number of architectural fea-tures by a man named Pantalces, an unknown individual mythologized by later generations of worshippers as the original founder of the sanctuary.The marginal nature of its location did not mean that the cult itself was marginal. On the contrary, the Karapla cave appears to have had closer ties to the urban ele-ment than has been hitherto assumed, being part of a larger network of Pharsalian cults which also included a Demetreium (?) on the acropolis hill and the rural shrine of Ampelia Pharsalon.5 Especially significant in this regard are the female protomae found at both our cave and the acropolis site (Chapter 3.3 above, Cat. nos. 4–5), as well as at the nearby city of Proerna. The quality of these dedications, along with evidence for expensive gifts such as stone statuary (Cat. no. 68) and bronze vases (Cat. no. 66), likewise call into question current preconceptions about the sociodemographics of the cult. A further indica-tion that the clientele of the Karapla cave was not limited to passing peasantry but included visitors from town is also found in the poetry inscribed at the site. As shown in Chapter 4 of this study, the long metrical inscription which greeted visitors at the sanctuary’s entrance reflects a number of motifs consistent with the ideology and aes-thetics of the city upper classes and their entourage. Most 4 On the prominence of springs in the Thessalian religious landscape: p. 21, note 25 above.5 See Mili’s recent remarks on the extent of Pharsalus’ ‘religious land-scape’ and the correlated nature of its cults, 2015, pp. 178–179.

One can only guess at the nature of the plantings, but it is likely that they were a mix of flowering shrubs and wild fruit trees from the same phryganic vegetation which still grows in the area, carefully selected in order to ensure foliage and blooms all year round. As the inscription con-firms, the other major feature of the site was the stairway, which dominated the view with its impressive bulk and allowed visitors to access the upper part of the precinct while browsing the rich assortment of votives displayed along the way. We can expect that the signature inscrip-tion of Pantalces, engraved high above the third step, was one of the main highlights—if not the centerpiece—of a visitor’s experience at the shrine. Like the powerful stone-work they were associated with, these ancient markings continued to stimulate the imagination of generations of worshippers, inspiring the foundation tale preserved in Inscription II. Memory played as important a role at the sanctuary as worship did. Placed at an intersection between past and present, city and wilderness, aristocracy and peasantry, the cave on the Karapla hill functioned as a nexus where these different worlds could converge and ‘overcome conflict’. Its story, which I have attempted to reconstruct in the preceding pages, is mirrored in the myriad of similar tales, ancient and modern, that underlie the rocks, waters, and trees of the Greek landscape:ΤΑ ∆Ε∆ΡΑ 7 ΕΥΚΑΠ [—], ΤΑ ΑΝΘΗ, ΤΗ ΒΡΥΣΗ ΚΑΙ ΤΟ ΕΡΓΟ ΠΡΟΣΤΑΣΙΑΣ, ΤΑ ΧΑΡΙΖΩ ΣΤΗΣ ΠΑΝΑΓΙΑΣ ΤΗ ΧΑΡΗ [the name of the dedicant follows].The seven eucalyptus trees, the flowers, the well, and the work of supervision, I give in gratitude to the Panagia.6 6 From “a wooden table fixed at a eucalyptus tree somewhere in Crete”; photo sent to H. Versnel by A. Chaniotis (Versnel 2011, p. 120, note 1).striking among these is the reference to ‘justified excess’ (hubrin . . . dikaian, line 18), a theme that does not seem to makes much sense outside the urban value system within which it originated. A literary autoschediasma composed several generations after the sanctuary’s foundation, Inscription II, as we have seen, is unlikely to be of value for reconstructing the character of the historical Pantalces. This document does show on the other hand that the founder’s reception in later Pharsalian culture was that of a figure sharing a legendary status and an iconography comparable to, if not technically identifiable with, that of the heroized dead. Whoever the obscure dedicant of Inscription I may have been, he was not memorialized as a shepherd or a holy man but as a founder/ancestor—an individual endowed with a noble spirit, wealth, physical prowess, health, a musical education, and proper ban-queting etiquette.From Inscription II we also learn that the Karapla cult was an inclusive one, open to all categories of the local population. The nature of the votives retrieved at the site appears to be consistent with this evidence. The powers of the cave bestowed their protection on Pharsalians of both genders at the critical stages of the male and female life cycle (puberty, marriage, childbirth) as well as in times of illness and other crises. There is no explicit indication for mantic activities at the site, although we can expect that the Karapla Nymphs, like most deities associated with underground water, must have been endowed with dual prerogatives of healing and prophecy. Likewise there is no evidence that the inner part of our cave was ever used as an adytum or a place of subterranean seclusion. Filled with natural light for most of the day and upwardly ori-ented, the enclosed part of the precinct did not lend itself to catabatic experiences. The near total absence of lamps or any other findings in the interior of the cave also sup-ports this conclusion. In Inscription II the repeated ref-erences to the shrine’s well-tended landscape emphasize the outdoor nature of the setting: a pleasantly verdant spot beneath a rocky cliff, with stairs leading to a holy"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"conclusion96Table 2 Chronological conspectus (many dates are approximated or speculative)neolithic• Middle Neolithic female figurine Volos Museum M 168, 5100–4400• Late Neolithic pottery, 4300–2800helladic• Middle and Late Helladic burials, 2100–1060• Thessalian migrations, 1200–1100geometric• Protogeometric and Geometric burials, 1050–700• Lelantine war: Cleomachus of Pharsalus, ca. 700Early worship at cave?archaic• Early city walls, 600–500• Rule of Echecratidas II, 560–540• Olympic victory of Phaedrus (stadium), 556Archaic votives• Rule of Antiochus, 520–490 ◯ Anacreon and Simonides at Antiochus’ court?• Olympic victories of Agias (pancratium ) and Telemachus (wrestling), 484• Second Persian war.
